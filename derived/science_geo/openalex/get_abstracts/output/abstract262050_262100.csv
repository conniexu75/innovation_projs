https://openalex.org/W2008599922,"Asthma is caused by a combination of poorly understood genetic and environmental factors. We have systematically mapped the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the presence of childhood onset asthma by genome-wide association. We characterized more than 317,000 SNPs in DNA from 994 patients with childhood onset asthma and 1,243 non-asthmatics, using family and case-referent panels. Here we show multiple markers on chromosome 17q21 to be strongly and reproducibly associated with childhood onset asthma in family and case-referent panels with a combined P value of P < 10(-12). In independent replication studies the 17q21 locus showed strong association with diagnosis of childhood asthma in 2,320 subjects from a cohort of German children (P = 0.0003) and in 3,301 subjects from the British 1958 Birth Cohort (P = 0.0005). We systematically evaluated the relationships between markers of the 17q21 locus and transcript levels of genes in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines from children in the asthma family panel used in our association study. The SNPs associated with childhood asthma were consistently and strongly associated (P < 10(-22)) in cis with transcript levels of ORMDL3, a member of a gene family that encodes transmembrane proteins anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum. The results indicate that genetic variants regulating ORMDL3 expression are determinants of susceptibility to childhood asthma."

https://openalex.org/W1972412818,"Understanding the large-scale structural network formed by neurons is a major challenge in system neuroscience. A detailed connectivity map covering the entire brain would therefore be of great value. Based on diffusion MRI, we propose an efficient methodology to generate large, comprehensive and individual white matter connectional datasets of the living or dead, human or animal brain. This non-invasive tool enables us to study the basic and potentially complex network properties of the entire brain. For two human subjects we find that their individual brain networks have an exponential node degree distribution and that their global organization is in the form of a small world."
https://openalex.org/W2116945806,"Visual word recognition has been proposed to rely on a hierarchy of increasingly complex neuronal detectors, from individual letters to bigrams and morphemes. We used fMRI to test whether such a hierarchy is present in the left occipitotemporal cortex, at the site of the visual word-form area, and with an anterior-to-posterior progression. We exposed adult readers to (1) false-font strings; (2) strings of infrequent letters; (3) strings of frequent letters but rare bigrams; (4) strings with frequent bigrams but rare quadrigrams; (5) strings with frequent quadrigrams; (6) real words. A gradient of selectivity was observed through the entire span of the occipitotemporal cortex, with activation becoming more selective for higher-level stimuli toward the anterior fusiform region. A similar gradient was also seen in left inferior frontoinsular cortex. Those gradients were asymmetrical in favor of the left hemisphere. We conclude that the left occipitotemporal visual word-form area, far from being a homogeneous structure, presents a high degree of functional and spatial hierarchical organization which must result from a tuning process during reading acquisition."
https://openalex.org/W2115569429,"The cortex contains multiple cell types, but studies of attention have not distinguished between them, limiting understanding of the local circuits that transform attentional feedback into improved visual processing. Parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory interneurons can be distinguished from pyramidal neurons based on their briefer action potential durations. We recorded neurons in area V4 as monkeys performed an attention-demanding task. We find that the distribution of action potential durations is strongly bimodal. Neurons with narrow action potentials have higher firing rates and larger attention-dependent increases in absolute firing rate than neurons with broad action potentials. The percentage increase in response is similar across the two classes. We also find evidence that attention increases the reliability of the neuronal response. This modulation is more than two-fold stronger among putative interneurons. These findings lead to the surprising conclusion that the strongest attentional modulation occurs among local interneurons that do not transmit signals between areas.

These findings lead to the surprising conclusion that the strongest attentional modulation occurs among local interneurons that do not transmit signals between areas. Cortical neurons differ from one another in important ways, including their neurochemical properties, patterns of connectivity, laminar distribution, gene expression patterns, and developmental origin (Markram et al., 2004Markram H.

Neurosci. 2006; 7: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). It is unknown whether different classes of neurons play distinct roles during performance of an attention-demanding task. This question must be answered if we are to understand the biological underpinnings of attention, but it has remained unresolved because many of the properties that distinguish neurons from one another are invisible to the extracellular recording electrodes that are used to record neuronal responses in behaving animals. To determine whether attention modulates neuronal responses generically across visual cortical neurons or differs by class, we exploited observations made in anesthetized animals and cortical slices, where different types of neurons can be distinguished on the basis of morphology and protein expression. These intracellular recording studies have found that parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic interneurons with the morphology of basket cells and chandelier cells have short-duration action potentials, whereas excitatory pyramidal neurons have longer-duration action potentials (McCormick et al., 1985McCormick D.A.

This difference is due, in part, to the expression of different classes of K+ and Na+ channels that differ from one another in their kinetics (Martina and Jonas, 1997Martina M. Jonas P.

The duration of the extracellular spike waveform is directly related to the duration of the intracellular waveform (Henze et al., 2000Henze D.A. Borhegyi Z. Csicsvari J. Mamiya A. Harris K.D.

This has made it possible to distinguish fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons from pyramidal neurons in extracellular recordings in the hippocampus (Fox and Ranck, 1981Fox S.E. Ranck J.B.

Fast-spike interneurons and cerebral feedforward inhibition in awake sensory neocortex.Cereb. Cortex. 2003; 13: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). A recent study validated the utility of the classification in cortex by showing that known pyramidal neurons in macaque frontal eye fields (those which can be antidromically activated by stimulation of the superior colliculus) have broad spike waveforms (S.Y. Shin and M.A. Sommer, 2006, Soc. Neurosci., abstract). Two other studies, in prefrontal and somatosensory cortex of the rat (Bartho et al., 2004Bartho P. Hirase M. Monoconduit L. Zugaro M. Harris K.D. Buzsaki G. Characterization of neocortical principle cells and interneurons by network interactions and extracellular features.J. Neurophysiol. 2004; 92: 600-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar) and the inferior temporal cortex of the macaque (Tamura et al., 2004Tamura H. Kaneko H. Kawasaki K. Fujita I. Presumed inhibitory neurons in the macaque inferior temporal cortex: Visual response properties and functional interactions with adjacent neurons.J. Neurophysiol. 2004; 91: 2782-2796Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), have further confirmed that narrow-spiking neurons are inhibitory, as indicated by short-latency dips in the cross-correlation of action potential times recorded simultaneously from pairs of neurons. We therefore examined whether action potential widths in area V4 are distributed bimodally, and if so, whether attention-dependent response modulation varies between narrow- and broad-spiking neurons. Neurons were recorded from area V4 in two rhesus macaques performing an attention-demanding task, which is described in detail below. Including any multiunit activity in our analysis could have resulted in averaging waveforms, thus obscuring differences in the population. Therefore, our V4 sample included only units that had been clearly isolated from one another and from multiunit activity, based on clear clustering in the principle components of the waveforms on each electrode (Offline Sorter, Plexon, Inc.). In addition, we required that units exhibit a clear spike refractory period. In total, 218 single units were isolated (142 from Monkey A, 76 from Monkey B), of which 160 were significantly driven by the stimuli in the task (108 from Monkey A, 52 from Monkey B). We examined the distribution of spike waveforms in order to determine whether it was bimodal and could therefore be divided into narrow- and broad-spiking subpopulations. For each neuron, all recorded action potentials were aligned by their troughs and averaged. Figure 1A shows the mean waveforms (±1 standard deviation) for two neurons recorded simultaneously on the same electrode. Across our sample, waveforms had similar biphasic shapes but varied in duration, defined here as the time in μs between the waveform trough and peak (Bartho et al., 2004Bartho P. Hirase M. Monoconduit L. Zugaro M. Harris K.D. Buzsaki G. Characterization of neocortical principle cells and interneurons by network interactions and extracellular features.J. Neurophysiol. 2004; 92: 600-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Figure 1B shows the mean waveforms of all neurons. The height of the waveforms has been normalized to aid in comparing action potential widths. All but nine neurons, which appear separately in the inset, had waveforms with a downward voltage deflection followed by an upward voltage deflection with a clear peak. Except where noted, these nine neurons were excluded from further analysis. The distribution of waveform durations, shown in Figure 1C, was significantly bimodal according to Hartigan's dip test (p = 0.0030) (Hartigan and Hartigan, 1985Hartigan J.A. Hartigan P.M. The dip test of unimodality.Annals of Statistics. 1985; 13: 70-84Crossref Google Scholar, Mechler and Ringach, 2002Mechler F. Ringach D.L. On the classification of simple and complex cells.Vision Res. 2002; 42: 1017-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The distribution was still significantly bimodal when limited to recordings in which only one neuron was isolated per electrode (see the Supplemental Results in the Supplemental Data available with this article online and Figure S2). Narrow- and broad-spiking neurons were separated on the basis of the two modes of the bimodal distribution, with narrow-spiking neurons defined as those ranging in duration from 100 to 200 μs and broad-spiking neurons defined as those ranging in duration from 201 to 500 μs. In Figure 1, Figure 2, those neurons that exhibited significant visually driven responses are indicated in red and blue, for narrow and broad waveforms respectively. Visually nonresponsive neurons are indicated in gray. We validated this classification by confirming that other physiological properties of the cells differed systematically between groups. Intracellular studies have found that narrow-spiking inhibitory interneurons have higher firing rates than broad-spiking excitatory neurons when stimulated by current injection (McCormick et al., 1985McCormick D.A.

Response to contrast of electrophysiologically defined cell classes in primary visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6936-6945PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, our narrow-spiking neurons exhibited much stronger stimulus-evoked responses than did our broad-spiking neurons (median 28.6 Hz compared to 12.2 Hz, Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.001). Narrow-spiking neurons also exhibited a higher level of spontaneous activity when no stimulus was present in the receptive field (RF) (median 9.4 Hz compared to 4.6 Hz, Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.001). Intracellular studies also find that the repolarization of the membrane potential following a spike is slower among broad-spiking pyramidal neurons (McCormick et al., 1985McCormick D.A. Connors B.W. Lighthall J.W. Prince D.A. Comparative electrophysiology of pyramidal and sparsely spiny stellate neurons of the neocortex.J.

Inhibitory postsynaptic potentials carry synchronized frequency information in active cortical networks.Neuron. 2005; 47: 423-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). In the extracellular signal, which resembles the negative derivative of the intracellular membrane potential, this gives both a broader and shallower peak following the initial trough (Henze et al., 2000Henze D.A. Borhegyi Z. Csicsvari J. Mamiya A. Harris K.D. Buzsaki G. Intracellular features predicted by extracellular recordings in the hippocampus in vivo.J. Neurophysiol. 2000; 84: 390-400PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this we find that broad-spiking neurons exhibit a shallower waveform peak relative to the trough (mean ratio 0.89 for broad-spiking neurons compared to 1.11 for narrow-spiking neurons, Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.001). Finally, intracellular studies have estimated that roughly 70%–80% of cortical neurons are broad-spiking pyramidals (Connors and Gutnick, 1990Connors B.W. Gutnick M.J. Intrinsic firing patterns of diverse neocortical neurons.Trends Neurosci. 1990; 13: 99-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar, Markram et al., 2004Markram H. Toledo-Rodriguez M. Wang Y. Gupta A. Silberberg G. Wu C. Interneurons of the neocortical inhibitory system.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 793-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1948) Google Scholar). We found that 152 of 209 neurons (72.7%) had broad spike waveforms in our V4 sample. The monkeys performed an attention-demanding multiple-object tracking task adapted from a paradigm used in humans (Pylyshyn and Storm, 1988Pylyshyn Z.W. Storm R.W. Tracking multiple independent targets: Evidence for a parallel tracking mechanism.Spat. Vis. 1988; 3: 179-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar, Sears and Pylyshyn, 2000Sears C.R.

Tracking multiple targets with multifocal attention.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2005; 9: 349-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The behavioral paradigm is depicted in Figure 2A. Monkeys maintained fixation on a central point while mentally tracking two of four identical Gabor stimuli, as all the stimuli moved along independent randomized trajectories. After an initial period of 950 ms of motion, all stimuli paused for 1000 ms before continuing along their trajectories. During this pause, one of the stimuli was positioned within the RF of the neuron under study. Sensory conditions were matched to ensure that the set of paths followed by the stimulus that entered the RF were identical across attention conditions (see Experimental Procedures). Therefore, any difference in response across cueing conditions can be attributed to the attentional cue. The most well-established form of attention-dependent response modulation is an increase in firing rate when attention is directed to a stimulus within a neuron's RF (for reviews, see Treue, 2003Treue S. Visual attention: The where, what, how and why of saliency.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 428-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, Reynolds and Chelazzi, 2004Reynolds J.H. Chelazzi L. Attentional modulation of visual processing.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 611-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Consistent with these earlier findings, the average firing rate during the 1000 ms pause period was increased by 22.9% for attended stimuli compared to identical unattended stimuli, averaged across the population of all 160 visually responsive neurons, including eight visually responsive neurons of the nine with nonbiphasic waveforms (see Supplemental Results and Figure S1). The magnitude of this attention-dependent increase in firing rate is consistent with earlier studies that have used Gabor stimuli (McAdams and Maunsell, 1999aMcAdams C.J. Maunsell J.H. Effects of attention on orientation tuning functions of single neurons in macaque cortical area V4.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 431-441PubMed Google Scholar). We examined whether this attention-dependent response increase differed between classes. Figure 2B shows the average response of the 109 visually responsive broad-spiking neurons for attended (dark blue) and unattended (light blue) stimuli. The response begins when the stimulus enters the RF, about 400 ms prior to the pause period, and also continues about 400 ms after the pause as the stimulus leaves the RF. There was a modest but significant increase in the firing rate with attention (mean attended = 13.9 Hz, unattended = 12.2 Hz, Wilcoxon signed rank test, p < 0.001). Figure 2C shows the average firing rate of the 43 visually responsive narrow-spiking neurons for attended (dark red line) and unattended (light red line) stimuli. The most noticeable difference between the two classes is the much higher firing rate of the narrow-spiking neurons. The lower response of the broad-spiking neurons, in blue, is included for comparison. The increase in absolute firing rate, in spikes/s, among narrow-spiking neurons (mean attended 34.6 Hz, unattended 28.6 Hz, Wilcoxon signed rank test, p < 0.001) was significantly larger than that of the broad-spiking neurons (Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.001). However, the percentage increase did not differ significantly across the two populations, with a median increase of 21.1% among broad-spiking neurons compared to 28.0% among narrow-spiking neurons (Mann-Whitney U test, p = 0.578). To visualize the distribution of effects in the two populations, we computed a rate normalized attention index for each unit, defined as (A − U)/(A + U), where A and U are, respectively, the firing rate above baseline for an attended and unattended stimulus averaged over the 1000 ms pause period. The distribution of AI indices is summarized in Figure 2D for broad (blue)- and narrow (red)-spiking neurons. Scatter plots of the AI indices versus waveform duration are provided in Figure S3. In Figure 2D, those neurons with individually significant modulations are indicated in black. Both distributions were significantly shifted to the right of zero, indicating that attention tended to increase firing rate in both populations (Wilcoxon signed rank test, p < 0.001 for broad-spiking, p < 0.001 for narrow-spiking). However, the effect of attention on broad-spiking neurons was variable, with some neurons showing significant attention-dependent increases in firing rate and others showing significant decreases. Attention had a more consistent effect on the firing rates of narrow-spiking neurons. All 27 narrow-spiking neurons whose firing rate was significantly modulated showed an attention-dependent increase in response. Thirty-eight of the 47 significantly modulated broad-spiking neurons showed increases. This difference in the proportion of significant positive and negative attentional modulation was significant according to a bootstrap test (p = 0.021). Response variability affects how reliably information is encoded by neuronal signals. An attention-dependent reduction in response variability could, therefore, enhance sensory processing of behaviorally relevant stimuli. To quantify response variability, we computed the Fano factor, the ratio of spike count variance to mean spike count. Figure 2E shows the average Fano factors of broad-spiking neurons for attended (dark blue) and unattended (light blue) stimuli. The Fano factor showed a modest, but significant, reduction with attention (mean attended = 1.31, unattended = 1.43, Wilcoxon signed rank test, p < 0.001). Figure 2F shows the average Fano factors of narrow-spiking neurons for attended (dark red) and unattended (light red) stimuli. The reduction among narrow-spiking neurons (mean attended = 1.31, unattended = 1.60, Wilcoxon signed rank test, p < 0.001) was significantly stronger than that of broad-spiking neurons (Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.001). The percentage decrease was also significantly stronger among narrow-spiking neurons, with a median decrease of 18.9% as compared to 7.9% among broad-spiking neurons (Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.001). The distribution of AIs for Fano factor is shown in Figure 2G for broad (blue)- and narrow (red)-spiking neurons. Each population separately showed a significant reduction in AI indices (Wilcoxon signed rank tests, p < 0.001). We considered whether the stronger reduction in Fano factor for narrow-spiking cells might be a consequence of the fact that they exhibit much stronger stimulus-evoked responses than broad-spiking neurons. This explanation is plausible, as previous studies in early visual areas have shown that the Fano factor is smaller among neurons with higher firing rates (Kara et al., 2000Kara P. Reinagel P. Reid R.C. Low response variability in simultaneously recorded retinal, thalamic, and cortical neurons.Neuron. 2000; 27: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). At higher firing rates, intervals between spikes become short, ultimately approaching the lower limit imposed by the spike refractory period, resulting in less variable spike timing. This relationship between spiking variance and rate for a model neuron is illustrated in Figure 3A. For a purely Poisson process, the variance in spiking would increase in exact proportion with the mean rate, resulting in a mean-variance relationship that falls along the line of unity (dashed line), but when we incorporate a relative refractory period, the variance in spiking begins to saturate at high firing rates (solid line). A substantial reduction in Fano factor occurs at high rates for a given percentage increase (dark red versus light red point) compared to an identical increase at lower rates (dark blue versus light blue point). Thus, an increase in firing rate with attention could plausibly produce a large reduction in Fano factor if it occurred in the saturating region of this curve. To test this, we examined the relationship between spiking variability and rate for broad- and narrow-spiking neurons (Figures 3B and 3C). For each neuron we computed ten paired samples of the mean spike count and spike count variance (one sample for each of the 100 ms periods during the pause) for both the attended and the unattended conditions. We divided these data into the eight firing rate intervals indicated by vertical gray lines in Figure 3B and 3C. We then computed the mean spike count variance within each interval. For broad-spiking neurons there was a modest saturation in variance with increasing rate (Figure 3B), consistent with the model neuron (Figure 3A). Variance decreased only slightly with attention (dark blue attended, light blue unattended) suggesting that the modest reduction in Fano factor found in this class of neurons could, as suggested by the model, be a consequence of the saturation in variance with increasing rate. In contrast, narrow-spiking neurons did not exhibit saturation in spike count variance with increasing rate (Figure 3C). The lack of saturation among these neurons is consistent with observations from intracellular studies showing that fast-spiking cells have shorter refractory periods (Nowak et al., 2003Nowak L.G. Azouz R. Sanchez-Vives M.V. Gray C.M. McCormick D.A. Electrophysiological classes of cat primary visual cortical neurons in vivo as revealed by quantitative analyses.J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 89: 1541-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Further, narrow-spiking neurons showed significant reductions in spike count variance with attention at matched firing rates (dark red, attended; light red, unattended; asterisks indicate a significant reduction in variance within a given firing rate range, Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.05). Since firing rates were matched, this attention-dependent difference in response variance cannot be attributed to differences in firing rate. As described in the Supplemental Results, we also tested whether reductions in Fano factor were significant when firing rate was equated within individual neurons. Consistent with the above analyses, attention-dependent reductions in Fano factor remained significant among narrow-spiking neurons and were significantly stronger for narrow- than broad-spiking neurons (see Figure S4). Thus, the difference between classes in attention-dependent reduction in Fano factor cannot be attributed to differences in firing rate. To determine wheth"

https://openalex.org/W2108954741,"Enterococcus faecalis, a ubiquitous member of mammalian gastrointestinal flora, is a leading cause of nosocomial infections and a growing public health concern. The enterococci responsible for these infections are often resistant to multiple antibiotics and have become notorious for their ability to acquire and disseminate antibiotic resistances. In the current study, we examined genetic relationships among 106 strains of E. faecalis isolated over the past 100 years, including strains identified for their diversity and used historically for serotyping, strains that have been adapted for laboratory use, and isolates from previously described E. faecalis infection outbreaks. This collection also includes isolates first characterized as having novel plasmids, virulence traits, antibiotic resistances, and pathogenicity island (PAI) components. We evaluated variation in factors contributing to pathogenicity, including toxin production, antibiotic resistance, polymorphism in the capsule (cps) operon, pathogenicity island (PAI) gene content, and other accessory factors. This information was correlated with multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) data, which was used to define genetic lineages. Our findings show that virulence and antibiotic resistance traits can be found within many diverse lineages of E. faecalis. However, lineages have emerged that have caused infection outbreaks globally, in which several new antibiotic resistances have entered the species, and in which virulence traits have converged. Comparing genomic hybridization profiles, using a microarray, of strains identified by MLST as spanning the diversity of the species, allowed us to identify the core E. faecalis genome as consisting of an estimated 2057 unique genes."
https://openalex.org/W2017806952,"Background Gene expression profiling has revolutionized our ability to molecularly classify primary human tumors and significantly enhanced the development of novel tumor markers and therapies; however, progress in the diagnosis and treatment of melanoma over the past 3 decades has been limited, and there is currently no approved therapy that significantly extends lifespan in patients with advanced disease. Profiling studies of melanoma to date have been inconsistent due to the heterogeneous nature of this malignancy and the limited availability of informative tissue specimens from early stages of disease. Methodology/Principle Findings In order to gain an improved understanding of the molecular basis of melanoma progression, we have compared gene expression profiles from a series of melanoma cell lines representing discrete stages of malignant progression that recapitulate critical characteristics of the primary lesions from which they were derived. Here we describe the unsupervised hierarchical clustering of profiling data from melanoma cell lines and melanocytes. This clustering identifies two distinctive molecular subclasses of melanoma segregating aggressive metastatic tumor cell lines from less-aggressive primary tumor cell lines. Further analysis of expression signatures associated with melanoma progression using functional annotations categorized these transcripts into three classes of genes: 1) Upregulation of activators of cell cycle progression, DNA replication and repair (CDCA2, NCAPH, NCAPG, NCAPG2, PBK, NUSAP1, BIRC5, ESCO2, HELLS, MELK, GINS1, GINS4, RAD54L, TYMS, and DHFR), 2) Loss of genes associated with cellular adhesion and melanocyte differentiation (CDH3, CDH1, c-KIT, PAX3, CITED1/MSG-1, TYR, MELANA, MC1R, and OCA2), 3) Upregulation of genes associated with resistance to apoptosis (BIRC5/survivin). While these broad classes of transcripts have previously been implicated in the progression of melanoma and other malignancies, the specific genes identified within each class of transcripts are novel. In addition, the transcription factor NF-KB was specifically identified as being a potential “master regulator” of melanoma invasion since NF-KB binding sites were identified as consistent consensus sequences within promoters of progression-associated genes. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that tumor cell lines are a valuable resource for the early identification of gene signatures associated with malignant progression in tumors with significant heterogeneity like melanoma. We further conclude that the development of novel data reduction algorithms for analysis of microarray studies is critical to allow for optimized mining of important, clinically-relevant datasets. It is expected that subsequent validation studies in primary human tissues using such an approach will lead to more rapid translation of such studies to the identification of novel tumor biomarkers and therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2106357405,"The visual cortex represents stimuli through the activity of neuronal populations. We measured the evolution of this activity in space and time by imaging voltage-sensitive dyes in cat area V1. Contrast-reversing stimuli elicit responses that oscillate at twice the stimulus frequency, indicating that signals originate mostly in complex cells. These responses stand clear of the noise, whose amplitude decreases as 1/frequency, and yield high-resolution maps of orientation preference and retinotopy. We first show how these maps are combined to yield the responses to focal, oriented stimuli. We then study the evolution of the oscillating activity in space and time. In the orientation domain, it is a standing wave. In the spatial domain, it is a traveling wave propagating at 0.2–0.5 m/s. These different dynamics indicate a fundamental distinction in the circuits underlying selectivity for position and orientation, two key stimulus attributes."

In motor cortex, waves have been suggested to mediate information transfer during movement preparation and execution (Rubino et al., 2006Rubino D. Robbins K.A. Hatsopoulos N.G. Propagating waves mediate information transfer in the motor cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 1549-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). However, in mammalian visual cortex, while waves have been reported in a few studies (Arieli et al., 1995Arieli A. Shoham D. Hildesheim R. Grinvald A.

USA. 2006; 103: 12586-12591Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the spatiotemporal patterns of evoked waves have not been carefully examined. Since propagating waves determine when and where population depolarization will occur in the cortical network, they may play critical roles in cortical processing (Ermentrout and Kleinfeld, 2001Ermentrout G.B. Kleinfeld D. Traveling electrical waves in cortex: insights from phase dynamics and speculation on a computational role.Neuron. 2001; 29: 33-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, Rubino et al., 2006Rubino D.

Thus, characterizing the initiation and spatiotemporal patterns of the evoked waves in visual areas is important for understanding the population mechanisms of visual processing. Voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) imaging provides a useful tool for visualizing the spatiotemporal patterns of cortical activity. With the improvement of blue dyes (Shoham et al., 1999Shoham D. Glaser D.E. Arieli A. Kenet T. Wijnbergen C. Toledo Y. Hildesheim R. Grinvald A.

In this study, we used VSD imaging to examine visually evoked activity in rat visual cortical areas. Our imaging device offers 17–19 bit dynamic range, allowing us to examine wave dynamics in detail in single trials (Lippert et al., 2007Lippert M.T. Takagaki K. Xu W. Huang X. Wu J.Y. Methods for voltage-sensitive dye imaging of rat cortical activity with high signal-to-noise ratio.J. Neurophysiol. 2007; (in press. Published online May 9, 2007)https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.01169.2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We found that a visual stimulus initiated a propagating wave in V1, which was compressed when propagating to V2. A reflected wave was subsequently initiated and propagated back into V1. Further study showed that the compression occurred at the V1/V2 border. Similar compression/reflection patterns were also observed at the border between mediomedial V2 (V2MM) and retrosplenial dysgranular (RSD) areas. These compression/reflection patterns occur only in evoked waves and not in spontaneous waves, suggesting that the compression and reflection are governed by mechanisms specific for processing visual inputs. VSD signals were measured from V1 and V2 areas of anesthetized rat with a photodiode array (Figure 1A). The visual stimulus was a drifting grating (0.05 cycles/degree, 50w × 38h degrees of viewing angle) presented to the contralateral eye. The drift of the grating (3 cycles/s) reliably evoked a propagating wave in the visual cortex. The evoked wave initiated with a latency of ∼100 ms (99.8 ± 18.2 ms, mean ± standard deviation [SD], n = 115 trials) after the onset of the drifting, and the activity was seen in all optical detectors, with a small time difference between each detector (Figure 1B, traces 1–4). The signal on each individual detector was converted to pseudocolor according to a linear color scale. The pseudocolor images showed that the evoked wave initiated in the monocular area of V1 (V1M) and propagated in both directions to the V1 binocular area (V1B) and to V2. This evoked wave, referred to as the primary wave, was “compressed” in its spatial dimension into a thin band in the middle of the propagating path (Figure 1C). A reflected wave initiated after compression and propagated backward to V1 (Figure 1C). The primary and reflected waves can be identified in the signal traces of individual detectors as double peaks (Figure 1B). Supplemental Movie S1, in the Supplemental Data available with this article online, presents another example showing the spatiotemporal sequence of the compression/reflection. This compression/reflection pattern was reliably observed in different recording trials. Figure 2A shows wave patterns from the same animal produced with identical stimuli (intertrial interval of ∼200 s). In this animal, the compression bands reached the narrowest width (Figure 2A, column c) at 72.7 ± 7.2 ms (mean ± SD, n = 9) after the onset of the primary wave. The compression band then became wider again due to the wave propagating into V2 and the back propagation of the reflected wave (Figure 2A, column d). The location and the shape of the compression band were similar from trial to trial. Movie S2 provides an example from another animal, in which three trials show almost identical location and temporal sequence for the wave compression. We have examined the visually evoked waves in 36 animals, and a similar primary wave, compression band, and reflected wave were observed in all animals. In Figure 2B, representative trials from seven animals all show similar spatiotemporal patterns. In different animals, the locations of the compression and the shape of the compression band varied slightly, probably reflecting individual variability in the neuroanatomy of the visual areas. A similar compression/reflection pattern was observed under visual stimuli with various parameters, including alternation of orientation (0°, 90°, 180°, or 270°), drifting velocity (30–200 degree/s), spatial frequency (0.025–0.3 cycles/degree), stimulus position (Figure S3 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online), contrast (>0.5, Figure S4) and size (>10°, Figure S4), while the probability for initiating the primary wave, the initiation site, and the shape of the compression band could be altered by varying stimulus parameters. Changes in stimulus position altered the location of the primary wave initiation site, consistent with the retinotopic map in V1M (Figures S2 and S3A). The shape of the compression band also varied when the location of the initiation site changed (red and blue lines in Figure S3A). The probability of evoking the wave decreased when either stimulus size or contrast was reduced, with a threshold of 6°–10° and 0.2°–0.5°, respectively (Figure S4). However, once the primary wave was initiated by suprathreshold stimulation, the same pattern of compression/reflection occurred. This was true even when the stimulus was presented at two positions with a large difference in the visual field (Figure S3B, top and middle row). Thus, the wave compression/reflection pattern is the rule rather than the exception. The reliability of the wave compression suggests it may be related to the neuroanatomical structure of the cortex, especially the border between V1 and V2. To test this idea, we used corpus callosum fiber bundles to identify the V1/V2 border. In rats, these bundles are abundant near the V1/V2 border (Olavarria and Hiroi, 2003Olavarria J.F. Hiroi R. Retinal influences specify cortico-cortical maps by postnatal day six in rats and mice.J. Comp. Neurol. 2003; 459: 156-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), so when electrical shocks were applied to the visual cortex contralateral to the imaging side, action potentials may reach the imaging side by the callosal fibers and be visualized with VSD imaging. Indeed, electrical stimulation of a moderate intensity in the contralateral V1M area evoked a localized activity on the imaging side (Figure 3B). The activity loci on the imaged side were fixed when the stimulation site was fixed, and the poststimulus latency of the activity was short and fixed (22.4 ± 2.6 ms, mean ± SD, n = 12 trials from three animals), indicating that electrical shock evoked the activity on the imaging side via callosal fiber bundles. In the same animal, visually evoked waves (Figure 3A) compressed adjacent to the activity evoked by contralateral electrical shocks (Figures 3C and 3D), suggesting that the compression occurred near the V1/V2 border. We next examined if compression occurs at borders between other visual areas. Indeed, a second compression often occurred (observed in 11 out of 36 animals) along the propagating path (Figure 4A). The location of the second compression (Figure 4C) was more medial to that of the first compression (Figure 4B), and probably at the border between V2MM and RSD areas. Between the two compressions there was a narrow gap, which correlated well with the V2MM area (Figure 4C). While the onset time of the second compression was more variable from trial to trial, the location of the second compression was fixed. Multiple compressions suggest that wave compression is associated with the border between visual cortical areas. The compression of the primary wave started as an abrupt slowing of the wave leading edge. As shown in Figure 5, the primary wave was initiated by the visual stimulus and quickly expanded into the entire V1 area (Figure 5A, first two images) at a propagation velocity of 50−70 mm/s. When reaching the V1/V2 border, the leading edge of the wavefront had an abrupt slowing (the velocity around the V1/V2 border was about 5 mm/s). Meanwhile, the trailing edge of the wave was still in V1 and maintained a higher speed (50–70 mm/s). As a result, a thin band of compressed activity formed along the V1/V2 border (Figure 5B). The compression and the resulting thin band sustained for a relatively long time compared with the time taken for the initial propagation within V1. In order to analyze the abrupt slowing of the wave, we present the data in another form of pseudocolor map, the X-T map (Figure 5C), in which the signal on a row of detectors along the propagating direction is displayed against time. In the X-T map the slope of the leading edge is proportional to the propagating velocity, and slowing of the wavefront can be identified as a reduction in the slope. Wave compression can be clearly seen as a thin horizontal stripe at the V1/V2 border (Figure 5C), indicating a nearly zero propagating velocity for about 35 ms during the course of the wave compression. We assumed that inhibition in local circuits may play a role in the control of velocity. To test if wave compression can be modulated by GABAA inhibition, we applied bicuculline, a GABAA receptor antagonist, to the cortex. The bicuculline was applied epidurally with a low concentration of 3–5 μM, which is below the threshold of interictal-like spikes (5–10 μM). At low concentration, bicuculline can completely abolish the wave compression without significantly changing the speed of wave propagation within V1 (Figure 6), suggesting that inhibition in the local circuit plays a major role in the wave compression. Compression bands reappeared after bicuculline was washed out (data not shown), suggesting that elimination of the compression band does not require a permanent change in the cortical circuit. Under low dose of bicuculline perfusion, the propagating velocity across the V1/V2 border was the same as that within V1 and V2 (Figure 6B), suggesting that changes in the excitatory connections at the border do not play a major role in the compression. Reflected waves, while more variable, were observed in most trials (86%, 168/194) following the compression, and they originated near the compression band (Figure 1 and Figure 5C). Since corpus callosum afferent fiber bundles are concentrated near the borders between visual areas, we wanted to determine if the reflected waves were initiated via the callosal fibers by the activity on the contralateral side of the cortex. Locally applied lidocaine or CNQX to the contralateral cortex significantly suppressed the local EEG response on the contralateral cortex, but it did not block the reflected wave (Figure S5), suggesting that the input from contralateral cortex is not a major contributor to the reflected wave. Thus, the reflected waves are likely to originate ipsilaterally; they may be feedback waves from higher visual areas. Both evoked and spontaneous cortical activities manifested as propagating waves. The spontaneous activities have also been referred to as “UP states” (Petersen et al., 2003bPetersen C.C. Hahn T.T. Mehta M. Grinvald A. Sakmann B. Interaction of sensory responses with spontaneous depolarization in layer 2/3 barrel cortex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 13638-13643Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). It is difficult to distinguish evoked events from spontaneous events in a recording from a single site. However, the spatiotemporal pattern of these two types of events differed markedly. Figure 7 shows wave patterns of two evoked events and six spontaneous events from the same animal. The evoked waves were initiated in V1, compressed near the V1/V2 border, and had a reflected wave (Figure 7A). In contrast, the six spontaneous events all initiated from different locations and propagated across the cortex with various directions (Figure 7B). Compression and reflection were not observed during these spontaneous waves. To further elucidate the difference between evoked and spontaneous waves, we examined a large number of spontaneous and evoked events. Figure 8A shows the distribution of initiation sites of 20 evoked events and 123 spontaneous events from one animal. The initiation sites of the evoked events were clustered in the V1M, while the spontaneous events started at various locations, many of which were from outside of the imaged area. Since the evoked waves underwent compression at the V1/V2 border, their overall propagating velocity might be slower than that of spontaneous waves. The velocity of 89 evoked and 354 spontaneous events in five animals was examined (Figure 8B). We recorded the peak time for a wave to reach each detector and calculated the SD of the peak time for all detectors (Figure 8B, left). A larger SD indicates either a longer delay between initiation site and other locations or a slower wave, while smaller SD indicates shorter delay or a faster wave. (This method simplifies the calculation of the velocity because propagation direction vectors can be ignored.) The distribution of SDs showed that most of the evoked events had large SDs compared with the spontaneous ones (Figure 8B, right, p < 0.001, t test); while SDs of 80% of spontaneous events were between 0–20 ms, 80% of evoked SDs were between 20–40 ms. The principal findings of this study are as follows: (1) visually evoked activity in rat visual cortex manifests as a wave propagating from V1 to other visual cortical areas. (2) The evoked wave is compressed at the border between visual areas, and a reflected wave is initiated after the compression. The compression and reflection occur robustly and reproducibly in different trials and in different animals. (3) GABAergic inhibition near the border between V1 and V2 plays a major role in the wave compression. (4) The compression and reflection occur in visually evoked waves, but not during spontaneous events, suggesting that the compression/reflection pattern is governed by a mechanism associated with visual processing. Studies on visual processing have emphasized the receptive fields of individual neurons and the input-output relationship at the single-cell level. Spatiotemporal dynamics due to interactions in large networks, while important to the integration of information at the system level, are much less understood. In this report, we have observed complex and highly reproducible wave patterns, which imply that an internal mechanism organizes the activity at population level. To our knowledge, such intriguing patterns have not been reported in the previous studies of cortical waves. This is probably because the wave compression/reflection pattern is not time-locked to the onset of stimuli and may be blurred when averaging multiple trials. Thus, visualizing waves in single trials using blue VSDs (Shoham et al., 1999Shoham D. Glaser D.E. Arieli A. Kenet T. Wijnbergen C. Toledo Y. Hildesheim R. Grinvald A.

In mammalian sensory cortex, sensory-evoked propagating waves were found in previous imaging studies using blue dyes (Derdikman et al., 2003Derdikman D. Hildesheim R. Ahissar E. Arieli A. Grinvald A.

During these waves, neurons in layers II–III depolarize for a few millivolts above the resting potential (Petersen et al., 2003bPetersen C.C. Hahn T.T. Mehta M. Grinvald A. Sakmann B. Interaction of sensory responses with spontaneous depolarization in layer 2/3 barrel cortex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 13638-13643Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), and thus the firing probability is modulated. Multiple peaks in VSD signal (e.g., Figure 1, traces 1 and 2) during the primary and reflected waves suggest biphasic responses in the spiking of individual neurons (see Figure 4 of Roland et al., 2006Roland P.E. Hanazawa A. Undeman C. Eriksson D. Tompa T. Nakamura H. Valentiniene S. Ahmed B. Cortical feedback depolarization waves: A mechanism of top-down influence on early visual areas.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 12586-12591Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). As a common feature, sensory-evoked waves robustly initiated from the location of cortical afferents and propagated over a large area. Due to the propagation, a time delay is spatially distributed over the cortical area as determined by the propagating velocity. On a population scale, such delayed activation is different from the synchrony on a millisecond scale between active neurons. Wave compression/reflection observed in this report suggests an even larger time delay, in that the depolarization in V2 is ∼30 ms after V1 is activated (Figure 5C). The reflected wave, in contrast, would allow V1 and V2 to be depolarized together within 10 ms following the compression. This distinct temporal pattern provides a mechanism for simultaneously depolarizing neurons in several visual areas. Neurons in two different visual areas may simultaneously increase their firing probability during the wave, within a particular period after receiving a visual stimulus, thus facilitating the information exchange between these areas. Feedback waves traveling from areas 21 and 19 toward area 18 and 17 were recently reported by VSD imaging in ferrets (Roland et al., 2006Roland P.E. Hanazawa A. Undeman C. Eriksson D. Tompa T.

https://openalex.org/W1996314349,"Synaptogenesis requires recruitment of neurotransmitter receptors to developing postsynaptic specializations. We developed a coculture system reconstituting artificial synapses between neurons and nonneuronal cells to investigate the molecular components required for AMPA-receptor recruitment to synapses. With this system, we find that excitatory axons specifically express factors that recruit the AMPA receptor GluR4 subunit to sites of contact between axons and GluR4-transfected nonneuronal cells. Furthermore, the N-terminal domain (NTD) of GluR4 is necessary and sufficient for its recruitment to these artificial synapses and also for GluR4 recruitment to native synapses. Moreover, we show that axonally derived neuronal pentraxins NP1 and NPR are required for GluR4 recruitment to artificial and native synapses. RNAi knockdown and knockout of the neuronal pentraxins significantly decreases GluR4 targeting to synapses. Our results indicate that NP1 and NPR secreted from presynaptic neurons bind to the GluR4 NTD and are critical trans-synaptic factors for GluR4 recruitment to synapses."

However, the mechanisms that enable precursors to sense and respond to such gradients are poorly understood.

The BDNF gradient stimulates endocytosis of TrkB and associated signaling molecules, causing asymmetric accumulation of signaling endosomes at the subcellular location where BDNF concentration is maximal.

However, the mechanisms that lead to polarization and directional migration in response to extracellular cues are not well understood. Chemotaxis is critical for neural development, as neural precursors travel long distances from proliferative zones to reach correct positions for mature function. At particular stages in development, precursors travel in predictable directions and along defined axes. While early precursors migrate tangentially along a rostral-caudal or circumferential path, both cerebral and cerebellar precursors migrate radially at defined developmental stages. Neurons of the cerebral cortex travel outward from the ventricular zone to the cortical layers, while cerebellar granule cell precursors (GCPs) travel radially inward from a proliferative zone in the external granule cell layer (EGL) and traverse the molecular layer to reach the internal granule cell layer (IGL) (Hatten, 1999Hatten M.E.

During radial migration, precursors often migrate along glial “tracks” that restrict migration decisions to a simple range of choices: cells can remain stationary, move forward, or move backward (Nadarajah et al., 2001Nadarajah B.

Precursors move relatively slowly during radial migration, so migration of GCPs from the EGL to the IGL occurs over the course of several days in vivo (Bellion et al., 2005Bellion A. Baudoin J.P.

Once GCPs reach the IGL, migration ceases. Together these attributes make it possible to examine the mechanisms that regulate radial migration of GCPs in vitro, in vivo, or in organotypic cultures. Cytoskeletal changes required for radial migration include remodeling of the microtubule network that surrounds the nucleus and extends forward to a centrosome. In addition, changes of the actin cytoskeleton and associated myosin motors enable the leading process to move forward and the trailing process to retract as the cell migrates. These cytoskeletal changes are regulated by intracellular molecular components that orchestrate cell polarity (Bielas and Gleeson, 2004Bielas S.L. Gleeson J.G.

In order for cells to move in the appropriate direction in vivo, extracellular cues must regulate these polarity molecules. Among the possible attractive cues are neurotrophins (Borghesani et al., 2002Borghesani P.R. Peyrin J.M. Klein R. Rubin J. Carter A.R. Schwartz P.M. Luster A. Corfas G. Segal R.A.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 4272-4280PubMed Google Scholar). Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is an extracellular factor that regulates neural precursor migration. In vivo, neural migration is abnormal in the cerebral and cerebellar cortex of mutant mice that lack or overexpress BDNF, and BDNF can stimulate migration of precursors in tissue culture system (Borghesani et al., 2002Borghesani P.R.

However, it is not known whether this ligand is involved in movement per se or in the directionality of the response. Here we show that a gradient of BDNF exists in the developing cerebellum and this gradient both orients and stimulates migration of GCPs. Correct orientation of migration depends on TrkB-dependent secretion of BDNF by GCPs and subsequent accumulation of activated TrkB receptors in endosomes located in or adjacent to the leading process. We identify Tiam1/Rac and PI (3, 4, 5) P3 (PIP3) phospholipids as critical components in the chemotactic response to BDNF and demonstrate that these components colocalize with TrkB in signaling endosomes at the leading process. Thus, TrkB-regulated BDNF release and localized endocytosis of BDNF/TrkB constitute mechanisms that enable GCPs to establish an intracellular gradient of signaling components steeper than the shallow extracellular BDNF gradient so that GCPs migrate directionally. In bdnf−/− mice migration of GCPs from the EGL to IGL is impaired (Borghesani et al., 2002Borghesani P.R. Peyrin J.M. Klein R. Rubin J. Carter A.R. Schwartz P.M. Luster A. Corfas G. Segal R.A. BDNF stimulates migration of cerebellar granule cells.Development. 2002; 129: 1435-1442PubMed Google Scholar). An extracellular factor such as BDNF might stimulate migration with or without providing a directional cue. As an in vivo gradient is needed for a factor to provide a directional cue, we investigated the distribution of BDNF protein in the developing cerebellum. We examined BDNF concentrations in lysates of EGL and IGL microdissected at postnatal day 7 (P7), when GCPs are actively migrating. As shown in Figure S1A in the Supplemental Data (available with this article online), BDNF concentration is 2-fold higher in IGL than in EGL. Taken together with previous studies of BDNF expression using in situ hybridization and immunostaining (Borghesani et al., 2002Borghesani P.R. Peyrin J.M. Klein R. Rubin J. Carter A.R. Schwartz P.M.

Localization of brain-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA to neurons in the brain by in situ hybridization.Exp. Neurol. 1990; 109: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), these results indicate that regulated expression of BDNF in vivo generates a gradient that increases along the migratory path from the EGL to the IGL. To investigate the role of BDNF as a chemotactic factor for neural precursors, we established an in vitro real-time migration assay (Figure S1B) wherein GCPs from P6 mice are exposed to an exogenous BDNF gradient and observed by time-lapse microscopy. As shown in Figure S1B, BDNF loaded into the agarose plug diffuses into the medium, creating a gradient of BDNF as validated by ELISA (Figure S1C). Using this system, we traced the migratory paths of individual GCPs during 2 hr of data acquisition under control conditions, when exposed to a BDNF gradient, or when exposed to a uniform distribution of BDNF. For each condition, we superimposed the paths of each GCP from four experiments on a common origin to generate the composites in Figure 1A. While both uniform BDNF and a BDNF gradient increased the percentage of cells that migrate compared with control, the gradient had a greater effect (Figure 1B). Furthermore, cells migrate in a random direction in control or uniform BDNF condition, but preferentially migrate toward the BDNF source in the gradient condition (Figure 1C and Movie S1 in the Supplemental Data). Thus, BDNF promotes migration most effectively when presented as a gradient, and it provides a directional cue for movement. Mathematical modeling of chemotactic responses indicates that basal migration can be modeled by a random walk; chemotactic responses can be modeled as a biased random walk with high coefficient of nonrandomness (μ) (Shreiber et al., 2003Shreiber D.I. Barocas V.H. Tranquillo R.T. Temporal variations in cell migration and traction during fibroblast-mediated gel compaction.Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 4102-4114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 1D, the BDNF gradient significantly increased μ compared with control or uniform BDNF conditions, without significantly altering other attributes of migration, such as velocity or duration (Figure S2). Thus, BDNF functions as a chemotactic factor, converting the stationary state or random walk of precursors under basal conditions into a directed random walk that is oriented toward the BDNF source. BDNF has two receptors, TrkB and p75NTR, both of which are expressed by GCPs and could be involved in BDNF-induced chemotaxis (Carter et al., 2003Carter A.R. Berry E.M. Segal R.A. Regional expression of p75NTR contributes to neurotrophin regulation of cerebellar patterning.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 22: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, Klein et al., 1990Klein R.

To distinguish the receptor pathway or pathways required for BDNF-induced migration of GCPs, we used both pharmacologic and genetic approaches. We find that K252a, an agent that prevents Trk kinase activity (Tapley et al., 1992Tapley P. Lamballe F. Barbacid M. K252a is a selective inhibitor of the tyrosine protein kinase activity of the trk family of oncogenes and neurotrophin receptors.Oncogene. 1992; 7: 371-381PubMed Google Scholar), markedly inhibits directed migration of GCPs (Figure 1E). Treatment with K252a not only reduces the percentage of migratory cells, but also reduces directional movement of GCPs toward the BDNF source (Figure 1F). K252a also prevents GCP migration in an organotypic slice culture (Figure 1G), demonstrating that this Trk inhibitor can prevent migration in response to endogenous neurotrophin. We validated that K252a, at the dose used, prevents BDNF-induced activation of TrkB and its downstream signaling components (Figure 1E). Because GCPs express p75NTR as well as TrkB, and p75NTR is implicated in Schwann cell migration (Bentley and Lee, 2000Bentley C.A. Lee K.F. p75 is important for axon growth and schwann cell migration during development.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7706-7715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we tested migration of GCPs from p75NTR exon III mutant mice (Lee et al., 1992Lee K.F. Li E. Huber L.J. Landis S.C. Sharpe A.H. Chao M.V.

BDNF increased both migration and directed movement of p75 mutant cells (Figure 1H). Taken together with previous in vivo analyses of various TrkB (Medina et al., 2004Medina D.L. Sciarretta C.

Neurosci. 2003; 22: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) mutants, these data demonstrate that TrkB, but not p75NTR, mediates BDNF-induced chemotaxis of GCPs. A chemotactic response requires polarization of the intracellular cytoskeleton, resulting in elongation of a leading process directed up the gradient. The leading process features prominent actin filaments. As shown in Figure 2A, in response to BDNF stimulation GCPs extend a leading process toward the source of BDNF; this leading process contains abundant actin filaments that can be visualized with fluorescent phalloidin. TrkB receptors are localized in the leading process (Figures 2A5–2A8) and oriented toward the BDNF source (Figure 2B). Moreover, TrkB receptors concentrated in the leading process are activated receptors and can be visualized using anti-phospho-Trk (anti-pY490) (Figure 2C). These results indicate that TrkB is activated and relocalized in response to a BDNF gradient. Other receptors expressed by GCPs do not accumulate in the leading process, as shown by immunostaining with antibodies to CXCR4 (data not shown), a chemokine receptor expressed by GCPs (Klein et al., 2001Klein R.S. Rubin J.B. Gibson H.D. DeHaan E.N. Alvarez-Hernandez X. Segal R.A. Luster A.D.

We find that TrkB also relocalizes in response to uniform BDNF stimulation. However, under these conditions, the probability that TrkB will accumulate at the side of the cell facing the agarose plug is equal to the probability that TrkB will accumulate at the opposite side of the cell (in control and uniform conditions, the agarose plug is loaded with vehicle) (Figure 2B). This is in striking contrast to localization of TrkB in response to a gradient, where TrkB is more than twice as likely to accumulate at the side of the cell facing the agarose plug that is the source of BDNF rather than at the opposite side of the cell. These data indicate that polarized localization of TrkB receptors to the site of maximal BDNF concentration may be an important component that determines the directionality of the chemotactic response. The migration assay used here enables us to distinguish a directed migratory response from a generalized increase in motility, and so is appropriate for studies of BDNF-induced chemotaxis. However, GCPs extend a relatively short leading process when migrating along a laminin substrate instead of a radial glial fiber. To determine whether TrkB is also localized to the more elaborated leading processes of GCPs migrating along glial fibers, we examined TrkB distribution in GCP-Bergmann glia cocultures stimulated with BDNF. As shown, TrkB (red) is seen at the front of the GCP soma (green) and also in the leading process of this migrating cell (Figures 2D and 2E). Thus, when GCPs are migrating on a laminin substrate or along a Bergmann glial fiber, TrkB receptors localize to the leading processes of GCPs moving in response to BDNF stimulation. Furthermore, in the presence of a BDNF gradient, TrkB receptors preferentially localize to the cellular site where BDNF is at a maximal concentration. TrkB receptors in the leading processes of stimulated GCPs have a punctate distribution and appear to be inside the limits of the plasma membrane. Therefore, we asked whether these puncta represent endosomes, using an antibody against α-adaptin, an endocytic component enriched in early endosomes (Gonzalez-Gaitan and Jackle, 1997Gonzalez-Gaitan M. Jackle H. Role of Drosophila alpha-adaptin in presynaptic vesicle recycling.Cell. 1997; 88: 767-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, Takei and Haucke, 2001Takei K. Haucke V. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis: membrane factors pull the trigger.Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 385-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). As shown, internalized TrkB receptors colocalize with α-adaptin and other early endosomal markers after BDNF stimulation (Figure 2F), indicating that these receptors are located in an endosomal compartment. To determine whether redistribution of TrkB to endosomes in the leading process also occurs in vivo, and therefore might orchestrate radial migration during development, we examined the localization of TrkB in GCPs as they migrate from the inner EGL toward the IGL. Our results reveal that TrkB receptors are enriched in punctate structures within a crescent or extended process at the front of GCPs (Figures 3A1–3A4). The identity of these cells as GCPs was verified by the expression of Zic, a marker of the granule cell lineage (Aruga et al., 1994Aruga J. Yokota N. Hashimoto M. Furuichi T. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K.

Donor-matched human oral and dermal fibroblasts were used as models of nonscarring and scarring fibroblast phenotypes, respectively. Phenotypic differences in these two fibroblast populations were assessed and related to differences in HA synthesis and assembly. The two fibroblast populations showed intrinsic differences in their response to the profibrotic cytokine, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGFβ1), in that oral fibroblasts were resistant to TGFβ1-driven myofibroblastic differentiation. In dermal fibroblasts, differentiation was associated with an induction of HA synthase (HAS1 and HAS2) transcription and assembly of pericellular HA coats. In comparison, resistance to differentiation in oral fibroblasts was associated with failure of induction of HAS1 and HAS2 transcription and failure of pericellular coat assembly. Furthermore, inhibition of HA synthesis in dermal fibroblasts significantly attenuated TGFβ1-mediated differentiation. Interleukin-1β stimulation resulted in induction of HAS1 and HAS2 transcription but did not induce phenotypic differentiation or induce HA coat assembly. In addition, neither overexpression nor down-regulation of HAS1 (the isoform uniquely deficient in nonscarring oral fibroblasts) influenced phenotypic differentiation. In conclusion, inhibiting HA synthesis modulates TGFβ1-dependent responses in these cells preventing fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation. Moreover, HA pericellular coat assembly, rather than HAS isoform expression, appears to be associated with phenotypic differentiation.

Progressive fibrosis of superficial tissues and internal organs can result in an array of clinical conditions ranging from disfigurement and progressive disability to end-stage organ failure and death. Fibrosis is a key component of numerous chronic diseases, including pulmonary fibrosis, chronic kidney disease, liver cirrhosis, and congestive cardiac failure, well known causes of worldwide death and disability (1Green F.H.

Despite this, there is a marked paucity of effective therapies targeting this process placing a considerable burden on health services. Fibrosis can be considered as a form of aberrant wound healing in which there is progression rather than resolution of scarring. It results from unabated fibroblast activity leading to excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) 3The abbreviations used are:ECMextracellular matrixRTreverse transcriptionHAhyaluronanHASsynthaseTGF-β1transforming growth factor-β1ORFopen reading frameFBSfetal bovine serumPBSphosphate-buffered salineFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateBSAbovine serum albuminsiRNAshort interfering RNABisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol4MU4-methylumbelliferoneQCRquantitative PCRα-smaα-smooth muscle actinBNSbasic nucleofector solutionIQRinter-quartile rangeILinterleukin. 3The abbreviations used are:ECMextracellular matrixRTreverse transcriptionHAhyaluronanHASsynthaseTGF-β1transforming growth factor-β1ORFopen reading frameFBSfetal bovine serumPBSphosphate-buffered salineFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateBSAbovine serum albuminsiRNAshort interfering RNABisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol4MU4-methylumbelliferoneQCRquantitative PCRα-smaα-smooth muscle actinBNSbasic nucleofector solutionIQRinter-quartile rangeILinterleukin. causing disruption of normal tissue architecture and function. Fibroblasts are central to both the healing and the scarring processes and have distinct phenotypes depending on their site of isolation (7Clark R.A.F. Molecular and Cellular Biology of Wound Repair.2nd Ed. Plenum Publishing Corp, New York1995: 3-50Google Scholar). When activated, they undergo a number of phenotypic transitions and eventually acquire a contractile “myofibroblastic” phenotype characterized by the expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-sma) (8Gabbiani G. J. Pathol. 2003; 200: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). These myofibroblasts are responsible for closure of wounds and for the formation of the collagen-rich scar. In addition, their presence in tissues has been established as a marker of progressive fibrosis (9Desmouliere A. Darby I.A. Gabbiani G. Lab.

The cytokine transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is recognized as a mediator of wound healing, and its aberrant expression has also been widely implicated in progressive tissue fibrosis (9Desmouliere A.

Hyaluronan (HA) is a ubiquitous connective tissue glycosaminoglycan synthesized by HA synthase enzymes (HAS) of which three vertebrate genes have been isolated and characterized as follows: Has1, Has2, and Has3 (16Meyer M.F.

Wight T.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1004-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), and it therefore plays an important role in wound healing. In addition, it is involved in mediating cellular responses to TGF-β1. For example, our recent studies in epithelial cells have demonstrated that HA modulates TGF-β1 signaling following interaction with its receptor, CD44 (32Ito T. Williams J.D. Fraser D.J. Phillips A.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25326-25332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 33Ito T. Williams J.D. Fraser D. Phillips A.O. Am. J. Pathol. 2004; 164: 1979-1988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated previously that phenotypic conversion of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts is associated with major changes in the production and metabolism of HA (34Jenkins R.H. Thomas G.J. Williams J.D. Steadman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41453-41460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Specifically, they have been shown to accumulate larger amounts of intracellular and extracellular HA and to assemble larger HA pericellular matrices. However, the functional significance of the alterations in HA turnover associated with the myofibroblastic phenotype remains unclear. Healing of both oral mucosal and dermal wounds proceeds through identical stages of inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling of ECM. However, wound healing in the oral mucosa is clinically distinguished from dermal healing in terms of both its rapidity and lack of notable scar formation. Previous in vitro work has demonstrated that oral mucosal fibroblasts show increased migration, experimental wound re-population, and ECM re-organization compared with dermal fibroblasts (35Stephens P. Davies K.J. al-Khateeb T. Shepherd J.P. Thomas D.W. J. Dent. Res. 1996; 75: 1358-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 36Stephens P. Davies K.J. Occleston N. Pleass R.D. Kon C. Daniels J. Khaw P.T. Thomas D.W. Br. J. Dermatol. 2001; 144: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Consequently in trying to understand fibrosis, we have used dermal and oral mucosal fibroblasts as models of scarring and nonscarring fibroblast phenotypes, to identify the processes that underlie scar-free healing. In this study we first compared TGF-β1-dependent phenotypic regulation of the two fibroblast populations. Second, we compared the HA synthetic machinery both at base line and following TGF-β1 activation. Finally, we assessed the role of HA in influencing differences in cell behavior. The data presented here demonstrate that the different fibroblast populations show crucial differences in their response to the pro-fibrotic cytokine, TGF-β1. In addition, we have demonstrated that inhibiting HA synthesis modulates TGF-β1-dependent responses in these cells preventing fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation. Materials—All reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise stated. PCR and QPCR reagents and primers were purchased from Invitrogen and Applied Biosystems (Cheshire, UK). Cell Culture—Four donor-matched samples of dermal and oral mucosal fibroblasts were obtained by biopsy from consenting adults undergoing routine minor surgery, and ethical approval for the biopsies was obtained from the South East Wales Research Ethics Committee. The cells were isolated as described previously (36Stephens P. Davies K.J. Occleston N. Pleass R.D. Kon C. Daniels J. Khaw P.T. Thomas D.W. Br. J.

The cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, and fresh growth medium was added to the cells every 3–4 days until confluent. The cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 48 h before use in experiments, and all experiments were done under serum-free conditions unless otherwise stated. All experiments were undertaken using cells at passage 6–10. Immunocytochemistry—Cells were grown to 70% confluence in 8-well Permanox chamber slides. The culture medium was removed, and the cells washed with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). For immunostaining of α-sma, the cells were fixed in acetone/methanol (1:1 v/v) for 5 min at room temperature. For staining of phalloidin, intended for visualization of filamentous actin, the cells were fixed in 3.5% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS, pH 7.3, for 5 min at room temperature. Following fixation, slides were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 20 min prior to a further washing step with PBS. Subsequently the slides were incubated with the primary antibody diluted in 0.1% BSA/PBS for 2 h at room temperature. Dilutions were as follows: murine monoclonal anti-α-sma clone 1A4, final dilution 1:30; FITC-conjugated phalloidin, final dilution 1:50. Following a further washing step, slides were incubated with the appropriate conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature as follows: FITC-rabbit anti-mouse IgG (DAKO, Cambridgeshire, UK) diluted 1:40 in 0.1% BSA/PBS. Cells were then mounted and analyzed by fluorescent microscopy. Conventional Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—RT-PCR was used to assess HAS1 and α-sma mRNA expression in oral mucosal and dermal fibroblasts. The cells were grown to confluence in 35-mm dishes and washed with PBS prior to lysis with Tri-reagent and RNA purification according to the manufacturer's protocol. RT was performed using the random hexamer method. 1 μg of RNA was added to 1 μl of 100 μm random hexamers, 2 μl of 10× PCR buffer, and 2 μl of 0.1 m dithiothreitol. The solution was heated to 95 °C for 5 min followed by 4 °C for 2 min. 1 μl of (40 units/μl) ribonuclease inhibitor RNasin (Promega) and 1 μl of (200 units/μl) Superscript were added to each sample and mixed. The solution was incubated at 20 °C for 10 min, 42 °C for 40 min, and then 95 °C for 5 min on a Gene-Amp PCR System 9700. As a negative control RT was performed with sterile H2O replacing the RNA sample. PCR was carried out in a final volume of 50 μl/sample, 2 μl of RT product, 37.25 μl of sterile H2O, 25 pmol of each primer, 3 μl of 10 mm dNTPs, 5 μl of 10× PCR buffer, and 0.25 units of AmpliTaq Gold. Thermal cycling was carried out using the GeneAmp PCR System 9700. Amplification was carried out using a cycle of 94 °C for 40 s, 55 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 60s. As a negative control, PCR was performed with sterile H2O replacing the cDNA sample. PCR was simultaneously done for β-actin as a standard reference gene. After PCR, one-tenth of the PCR mixtures from the target gene and β-actin samples were mixed and separated by flatbed electrophoresis in 3% (w/v) NuSieve-agarose gels (Flowgen Instruments Ltd., Sitting-bourne, UK), stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 mg/ml), and photographed using a Chemi Doc™ gel documentation system (Bio-Rad).

PCR was simultaneously done for ribosomal RNA (primers and probe commercially designed and purchased from Applied Biosciences) as a standard reference gene. The comparative CT method was used for relative quantification of gene expression. The CT (threshold cycle where amplification is in the linear range of the amplification curve) for the standard reference gene (ribosomal RNA) was subtracted from the target gene CT to obtain the ΔCT (ΔCT). The mean ΔCT values for similar samples were then calculated. The expression of the target gene in experimental samples relative to expression in control samples was then calculated using Equation 1, 2−(ΔCT(1)− ΔCT(2)) (Eq. 1) where ΔCT(1Green F.H. Chest. 2002; 122: S334-S339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) is the mean CT value calculated for the experimental samples, and ΔCT(2Chapman H.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 148-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) is the mean ΔCT value calculated for the control samples. Generation of HAS1-overexpressing Clone—HAS1 open reading frame (ORF) was a gift from Dr. Andrew Spicer (Texas A&M University, College Station, TX). Standard PCR was done to reproduce the ORF using Pfx50 DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) to increase the fidelity of the PCR product. The primers used in the reaction included sites for the restriction enzyme EcoRI. The ORF was inserted into the vector (pCR3.1) using a standard ligation reaction with Promega T4 DNA Ligase. Amplification of the cloned vector was done via bacterial transformation (JM109-competent Escherichia coli, Promega). The integrity and orientation of the HAS1 ORF were confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion (EcoRI) and sequencing (data not shown). Transient transfection was performed with the aid of Nucleofector technology (Amaxa Biosystems) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol for transfection of primary mammalian fibroblasts. Oral mucosal fibroblasts were grown to 70% confluence in T75 flasks. The medium was then removed, and the cells were harvested by trypsinization (solution containing 0.05% trypsin and 0.53 mm EDTA). Once the cells detached, the resulting cell suspension was treated with an equal volume of FBS to neutralize the protease activity. Cell counting was performed using a hemocytometer, and cell numbers were adjusted to a final concentration of 0.5 × 106 cells/ml. The cells were then centrifuged (100 × g for 10 min), and the resulting pellet was resuspended in basic nucleofector solution (BNS) (Amaxa Biosciences). The cells were transfected either with HAS1-pCR3.1 or pmaxGFP (green fluorescent protein) DNA. The utilized concentrations were 100 μl of BNS to 1 μg of DNA. The solution was then transferred to an Amaxa certified cuvette and placed in the nucleofector. Nucleofection was carried out for 5 s according to the pre-specified program designed for mammalian fibroblasts, and the cells were subsequently transferred to either 35-mm dishes or 8-well Permanox chamber slides containing pre-warmed medium supplemented with 10% FBS. The pmaxGFP vector was used as a positive control. Two negative controls were performed as follows: 1) 0.5 × 106 cells in 100 μl of BNS containing 1 μg of DNA but without application of the program, and 2) 0.5 × 106 cells in 100 μl of BNS without DNA but with application of the program. The cells were incubated in medium supplemented with 10% FBS for 24 h followed by a 24-h incubation in serum-free medium prior to experimentation. pmaxGFP transfection was performed in parallel and used to calculate transfection efficiency (41.3% following 48 h and 39.1% following 96 h) (data not shown). HAS1 siRNA Transfection—Transient transfection of dermal fibroblasts with specific siRNA nucleotides targeting HAS1 expression was performed using siPORT Amine transfection reagent (Ambion Ltd., Huntington, UK) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 3 μl of transfection agent was diluted in 25 μl of Opti-MEM reduced growth medium (Invitrogen) and left to incubate at room temperature for 10 min. Meanwhile, the specific HAS1 siRNA oligonucleotides were diluted in Opti-MEM reduced growth medium to give a final concentration of 20 μm in a total volume of 25 μl. The transfection agent mixture and siRNA mixture were then combined and incubated at room temperature for a further 10 min. The newly formed transfection complexes (50 μl) were dispensed into empty wells of either 24-well culture plates or 8-well Permanox chamber slides. To each well, 4.5 × 104 dermal fibroblasts were then added so that the total volume in each well was 500 μl. As a control, cells were transfected with negative control siRNA (a scrambled sequence that bears no homology to the human genome). The cells were then incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 24 h in medium supplemented with 10% FBS followed by a 24-h incubation in serum-free medium prior to experimentation. Visualization of Pericellular HA by Particle Exclusion Assay—The exclusion of horse erythrocytes was used to visualize the HA pericellular coat. Formalized horse erythrocytes were washed in PBS and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 7 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in serum-free medium at an approximate density 1 × 108 erythrocytes/ml. 500 μl of this suspension was added to each 35-mm dish containing subconfluent cells and swirled gently for even distribution. The dishes were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min to allow the erythrocytes to settle around the cells. Control cells were incubated with 200 μg/ml bovine testicular hyaluronidase in serum-free medium for 30 min prior to the addition of formalized horse erythrocytes. On settling, the erythrocytes were excluded from zones around the cells with HA pericellular coats. This is viewed under the microscope as an area of erythrocyte exclusion. Zones of exclusion were visualized on a Zeiss Axiovert 135 inverted microscope. Because of the elongated shape of the cells, the exclusion zone at some areas of the cell was not visible. Therefore, the width of the exclusion zone was calculated at the widest point of the cell (usually the nucleus). Analysis of 3H-Radiolabeled HA—Cells were grown to full confluence in T75 flasks. The culture medium was then removed, and the cell was washed with PBS. Metabolic labeling was performed by incubation with 20 μCi/ml d-[3H]glucosamine hydrochloride for 24 h. The culture medium was then removed, and the cells were washed with PBS. The wash and medium were combined to form the conditioned medium extract. The conditioned medium extract was then treated with an equal volume of 200 μg/ml Pronase in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.05% sodium azide for 24 h. To remove any CD44-associated HA, the cells were treated with 10 μg/ml trypsin in PBS for 10 min at room temperature; this was designated the trypsin extract. The trypsin extract was then treated with an equal volume of 200 μg/ml Pronase for 24 h. The cells remaining in the culture flask were incubated directly with 100 μg/ml Pronase for 24 h. The supernatant was decanted and designated the cell extract. Each extract was passed over DEAE-Sephacel ion exchange columns equilibrated with 8 m urea in 20 mm BisTris buffer, pH 6, containing 0.2% Triton X-100. This removed any low molecular weight peptides and unincorporated radiolabel. HA was eluted in 8 m urea buffer containing 0.3 m NaCl. Each sample was split in two, and the HA was precipitated with 3 volumes of 1% potassium acetate in 95% ethanol in the presence of 50 μg/ml of each HA, heparin, and chondroitin sulfate as co-precipitants. The first half of each sample was resuspended in 500 μl of 4 m guanidine buffer and analyzed on a Sephacryl S-500 column equilibrated with 4 m guanidine buffer. To confirm that the chromatography profile generated was the result of radiolabeled HA, the second half of each sample was digested at 37 °C overnight with 1 unit of Streptomyces hyalurolyticus hyaluronidase (ICN Pharmaceuticals Ltd.) in 200 μl of 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 6, containing 0.05% sodium azide, and 0.15 m sodium chloride. The sample was then mixed with an equal volume of 4 m guanidine buffer and analyzed on the same Sephacryl S-500 column equilibrated with 4 m guanidine buffer. To produce the chromatography profile, the 3H activity for each half of the sample was normalized and corrected for dilution, and then the hyaluronidase-resistant counts were subtracted. The chromatography profiles only depict hyaluronidase-sensitive activity in each fraction plotted against fraction number. The column was calibrated with [3H]glucosamine hydrochloride, Mr 215; [35S]chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans, Mr 25 × 103; decorin, Mr 10 × 104; and [35S]versican, Mr 1.3 × 106. Cytotoxicity Assay—Cytotoxicity of 4-methylumbelliferone (4MU) was assessed by the commercial alamarBlue™ assay (BIOSOURCE), which is designed to measure cell viability and number. The assay utilizes an oxidation-reduction indicator that fluoresces in response to chemical reduction of growth medium resulting from cell growth and metabolism and demonstrates a linear relationship between the magnitude of fluorescence and cell number and viability. For this assay, subconfluent dermal fibroblasts were incubated for 24 h in serum-free medium alone or serum-free medium containing 1, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, or 0.2 mm 4MU. Following 24 h, 10% alamarBlue was added to the medium for 1 h at 37 °C. 100-μl aliquots of the conditioned medium was removed and added to a clear 96-well plate, and fluorescence was measured in a FLUOstar Optima™ fluorescence meter (BMG LABTECH, Inc., Durham, NC), excitation wavelength 540 nm and emission wavelength 590 nm. Statistical Analysis—The results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. when normally distributed and median ± interquartile range (IQR) when not normally distributed. The unpaired Student's t test was used for analysis of normally distributed data. For nonparametric data, the Friedman test was used for global comparison of different groups followed by the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test for subgroup analysis. All data were analyzed using software (SPSS 14.0 Chicago, IL), and p < 0.05 was considered significant. Oral Fibroblasts Are Resistant to TGF-β1-mediated Myofibroblastic Transformatio"
https://openalex.org/W2006537950,"It is well known that pain attracts attention and interferes with cognition. Given that the mechanisms behind this phenomenon are largely unknown, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and presented visual objects with or without concomitant pain stimuli. To test for the specificity of pain, we compared this modulatory effect with a previously established modulatory effect of working memory on visual object processing. Our data showed a comparable behavioral effect of both types of modulation and identified the lateral occipital complex (LOC) as the site of modulation in the ventral visual stream, for both pain and working memory. However, the sources of these modulatory effects differed for the two processes. Whereas the source of modulation for working memory could be attributed to the parietal cortex, the modulatory effect of pain was observed in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), an area ideally suited to link pain perception and attentional control."

Now this signaling nucleotide has been shown to act as an endogenous regulator of intracellular Ca2+ in a wide variety of cell types from plants to animals, participating in the regulation of cell functions (3Lee H.C.

In some fractionation studies, NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ stores were shown separable by density centrifugation from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), one of the important intracellular Ca2+-storing organelles that is sensitive to cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) and d-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)IP3) (IP3) for Ca2+ release. In other studies, it was found that the NAADP-sensitive stores are resistant to thapsigargin, an inhibitor of Ca2+-ATPase in the ER or sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). These results indicate that NAADP-induced Ca2+ response may not be from the ER/SR stores (7Genazzani A.A. Galione A. Biochem.

Accumulating evidence shows that this NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ store is unique and distinct from that of IP3- and cADPR-sensitive Ca2+ stores (9Cancela J.M. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Nature. 1999; 398: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 10Churchill G.C. Galione A. J. Biol.

More recently, we have reported that NAADP has no direct effect on those reconstituted RyR/Ca2+ release channels from the SR of coronary arterial smooth muscle and that a lysosome-associated Ca2+ regulatory mechanism via NAADP contributes to ET-1-induced Ca2+ mobilization in these arterial cells (11Zhang F. Zhang G. Zhang A.Y. Koeberl M.J. Wallander E. Li P.L. Am. J. Physiol. Heart. 2006; 291: H274-H282Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition, ET-1-induced vasoconstriction of coronary arteries was dependent on an intact NAADP-lysosome signaling pathway. It is concluded that a novel Ca2+ store associated with the lysosome that can be mobilized by NAADP is significantly implicated in the vasomotor response to ET-1 and thereby in the regulation of vascular tone. This lysosome-associated Ca2+ store in arterial myocytes is functioning as a Ca2+-triggering mechanism as confirmed in lysosomes of the sea urchin egg and pancreatic acinar cells (9Cancela J.M.

Functionally, lysosomes have originally been found to act as cell defenders to destroy foreign invaders, such as bacteria, and digest waste materials within the cells. It is generally accepted that TRP-ML1 (transient receptor potential-mucolipin1)-mediated control of lysosomal Ca2+ levels plays an important role in proper lysosome functions. TRP-ML1 is a nonselective cation channel that is permeable to Ca2+ as well as to Na+ and K+, which is widely expressed and resides in the late endosomes/lysosomes. The mutations of TRP-ML1 channel can cause mucolipidosis type IV disease, which is characterized by accumulation of lipids and membranous material in lysosomes, leading to developmental abnormalities of the brain and impaired neurological, ophthalmological, and gastric function (13Kiselyov K. Chen J. Rbaibi Y. Oberdick D. Tjon-Kon-Sang S. Shcheynikov N. Muallem S. Soyombo A. J. Biol.

Lysosomal function currently has been extended as a Ca2+ store targeted by NAADP for Ca2+ release in a growing body of different cells. Similar to the nonselective cation channel properties of TRP-ML1, pharmacological evidence demonstrated that NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ release channel could also be blocked by L-type calcium channel inhibitors (diltiazem and dihydropyridines) and potassium channel blockers, including tetrahexylammonium (16Genazzani A.A.

Lysosomes are reported to be abundant in the kidney and liver (20Bainton D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 66s-76sCrossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). It has been shown that extracts from rat liver can catalyze NAADP synthesis by exchanging nicotinamide of NADP+ for nicotinic acid, and these extracts also have the ability to inactivate NAADP (21Chini E.N. Dousa T.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 22Mandi M. Toth B. Timar G. Bak J. Biochem.

The NAADP-evoked Ca2+ release response has also been shown in microsomes from hepatocytes. The NAADP-elicited Ca2+ release, however, cannot be blocked by the inhibitors of either IP3 or ryanodine receptors (23Churamani D. Carrey E.A. Dickinson G.D. Patel S. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the cross-desensitization of IP3 and cADPR did not occur in liver microsomes, which suggested that the NAADP-mediated Ca2+ release was not through ER/SR Ca2+ stores (22Mandi M. Toth B. Timar G. Bak J. Biochem. J. 2006; 395: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the present study, we characterized a lysosomal NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ release channel in liver cells and tested whether this channel was identical to TRP-ML1. First, we isolated and purified lysosomes from rat liver by percoll gradient centrifugation and reconstituted the lysosomal NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ release channels into a planar lipid bilayer. Then, we determined the biophysical and pharmacological characteristics of these channels. Our results demonstrated that the lysosomal NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ release channels are present in rat liver hepatocytes, and that these lysosomal NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ release channels are mediated by lysosomal TRP-ML1, which are different from RyR and IP3RCa2+ release channels on the ER/SR.

Briefly, male SpragueDawley rats weighing 250–280 g, were fasted for 18 h and decapitated, and the livers were rapidly removed and cleaned with homogenization buffer (pH 7.4), which contained (in mm) 250 sucrose, 20 Tris-HCl, 1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 Na3VO4, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, and 40 ml of HEPES with 1 tablet of complete proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Germany). The livers were excised, minced well with scissors, suspended in 4 volumes of homogenates buffer, and homogenized first with 20 strokes by hand in a Dounce homogenizer, followed by 2 strokes in a Potter-Elvehjem tissue grinder rotating at 800 rpm. The homogenates, termed liver homo, were centrifuged at 600 × g, 4 °C for 10 min, and the postnuclear supernatant was added 0.01 volume of 100 mm CaCl2 stock solution to a final [Ca2+]of 1mm, then incubated at 37 °C, for 5 min. Every 2.7 ml of incubated mixture was layered on 22.3 ml of iso-osmotic (0.25 m sucrose) Percoll at a density of 1.08 g/ml in a Beckman type 45Ti rotor tube, and centrifuged at 60,000 × g, 4 °C for 15 min. After centrifugation, 4 fractions of solution from the bottom of the tube was carefully collected and pooled, termed homo percoll, then centrifuged in Beckman 32Ti type SW rotor tube at 100,000 × g,4°Cfor 1 h. A broad turbid layer (termed: lyso layer) in the bottom of the tube was carefully collected and diluted with 2 volumes of homogenization buffer; the remaining supernatant solution above the broad turbid layer (termed: upper layer) was discarded. Then, the diluted lysosome suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min, and the pellet was washed twice by centrifugation under the same conditions. The washed pellet was finally suspended in the resuspending solution (0.9% NaCl, 0.3 m sucrose) with 100 μm PMSF, and used as the purified lysosomal fraction. Biochemical Identification of Lysosomes—Acid phosphatase is one of the acid hydrolases that normally resides in lysosomes. It is a classical marker for the identification of lysosomes in subcellular fractions. The purity of the prepared lysosomes from liver was determined by the acid phosphatase assay kit from Sigma, and the acid phosphatase activity was represented by the conversion of 4-nitrophenyl phosphate to 4-nitrophenol and measured by spectrophotometer at 405 nm. Liver plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, and liver homogenates were used as controls.

Briefly, the liver homogenate from lysosome fraction isolation process was centrifuged at 1000 × g, 4 °C for 10 min. The nuclear pellet was discarded, and the postnuclear supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 10,000 × g,4°C for 25 min to obtain the postmitochondrial supernatant. The postmitochondrial supernatant was further centrifuged at 78,000 × g, 4 °C for 15 min. The microsomal pellet was collected and subfractionated by discontinuous sucrose density centrifugation. The microsomal pellet was first resuspended in sucrose solution to a final mixture contained 53% sucrose and 1–2 mg/ml microsomal protein; then 10 ml of this mixture was overlaid with 10 ml of 34% sucrose, then 10 ml of 30% sucrose, followed by 8 ml of 0.25 m sucrose and centrifuged at 78,000 × g for 16 h at 4 °C in a swinging bucket rotor (Beckman type SW-27). All sucrose solutions were buffered with Tris-HCl (5 × 10–3 m, pH 8.0). After centrifugation, the endoplasmic reticulum fraction at the top of 53% sucrose layer and the plasma fraction at the top of 34% sucrose layer were collected respectively, washed with Tris-HCl buffer (5 × 10–3 m, pH 8.0) and harvested by centrifugation at 78,000 × g, 4 °C for 90 min. Each of the fractions was then suspended in a convenient volume of Tris-HCl buffer for use. The purity of endoplasmic reticulum preparations was analyzed by the cytochrome c reductase (NADPH) assay kit from Sigma. Eukaryotic NADPH-cytochrome c reductase is a flavoprotein localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, which is widely used as an endoplasmic reticulum marker. Cytochrome c reductase (NADPH) activity was represented by the reduction of cytochrome c in the presence of NADPH and measured by spectrophotometer with a kinetic program at 550 nm, 25 °C. Plasma membrane identity was determined by the alkaline phosphodiesterase activity, which was used as a marker enzyme for the plasma membrane with a method described previously (27Wisher M.H. Evans W.H. Biochem. J. 1975; 146: 375-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 29McCoy K.D. Ahmed N. Tan A.S. Berridge M.V. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1970; 47: 604-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Identification of lysosomes was further determined by Western blot analysis using an antibody of LAMP2 (lysosome-associated membrane protein 2), a lysosomal specific marker, with the method described previously (32Yi X.Y. Li V.X. Zhang F. Yi F. Matson D.R. Jiang M.T. Li P.L. Am. J. Physiol. Heart. 2006; 290: H1136-H1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The existence of TRP-ML1 in lysosome was also detected with corresponding antibody. Furthermore, the plasma membrane protein, caveolin, was examined to rule out the contamination possibility of plasma membrane in purified lysosomes. During probing, the concentrations of antibodies were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. LAMP2 and TRP-ML1 antibodies were purchased from Abcam®, and Caveolin antibody from BD Transduction Laboratories, respectively. The corresponding bands for LAMP2, TRP-ML1, and caveolin were visualized at 110, 65, and 24 kDa, respectively. Reconstitution of Lysosomal Channels into the Lipid Bilayer and Biophysical Characterization of the NAADP-activated Ca2+ Release Channels—The purified lysosomal membranes from rat liver were reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers with the method described previously (11Zhang F. Zhang G. Zhang A.Y. Koeberl M.J. Wallander E. Li P.L. Am. J. Physiol. Heart. 2006; 291: H274-H282Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 33Li P.L. Tang W.X. Valdivia H.H. Zou A.P. Campbell W.B.

Heart. 2002; 282: H1304-H1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine (1:1) (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) were dissolved in decane (25 mg/ml) and used to form a planar lipid bilayer in a 250-μm aperture between two chambers filled with cis and trans solutions. After the lipid bilayer was formed, lysosomal membrane preparations (40–60 μg) were added to the cis side solution. The force of driving the lysosomal NAADP channel-containing membranes into the lipid bilayer and promoting their fusion was the electrochemical gradients of Cs+ between the cis and trans side. The success rate for reconstitution of lysosomal Ca2+ release channel was about 60% of paintings. However, the success rate was dependent on the quality of the lysosomal preparations and the concentrations of frozen stored aliquot lysosomal preparations. High quality and high concentrations of lysosome preparations could ensure higher success rates in reconstitution of the lysosomal channels into the lipid bilayer. In these reconstitution experiments, Cs+ was used as the charge carrier. Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon instruments) was applied for the bilayer potential control and currents recording. Data acquisition and analysis were performed with pCLAMP software (version 9, Axon Instruments). The channel open probability (NP0) in the lipid bilayer was determined from 3 to 5 min recordings, and all lipid bilayer experiments were performed at room temperature (∼20 °C). The Ca2+ release channel activity was detected in a symmetrical 300 mm cesium methanesulfonate and 10 mm MOPS solution (pH 7.2). To establish current-voltage relationship of lysosomal NAADP-activated Ca2+ release channels, the single channel currents were recorded, while holding potentials were varied from–40 to +40 mV in steps of 20 mV. Pharmacological Characterization of NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ Release Channels—First, we investigated the dose effects of NAADP on the reconstituted lysosomal Ca2+ release channel activity; Second, we examined the effects of various plasmalemmal Ca2+ channel activators on the reconstituted lysosomal channels and then addressed whether NAADP-induced activation can be blocked by any Ca2+ channel inhibitors or blockers. A low concentration of Rya (2 μm) and 1 μm IP3 were used as activators of RyR and IP3R, and a concentration of Rya (50 μm) and 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborate (2-APB, 100 μm) as blockers of these SR/ER Ca2+ channels. Three different blockers of cell membrane voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel, diltiazem (100 μm), verapamil (100 μm), nifedipine (100 μm), and a non-selective Ca2+ channel blocker, amiloride (1 mm) were used. Bafilomycin A1 (Baf, 100 nm), an ATP-dependent vacuolartype proton pump inhibitor was used to test whether the activity of these reconstituted lysosomal channels is associated with the ATP proton pump on lysosomes, In addition, the effects of pH on the NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ release channel activity was examined in the presence of 10 nm NAADP. All of these compounds were added into the cis solution, and currents were recorded at holding potentials of +40 mV. Planar Lipid Bilayer Analysis of NAADP Effect on ER RyR/Ca2+ Release Channels—The preparation of ER-enriched microsomes from rat liver and reconstitution of these ER membranes into a planar lipid bilayer were performed by the same protocol described in the lysosomal channel reconstitution section, with cesium used as the charge carrier. The Ca2+ release channel activity was detected in a symmetrical 300 mm cesium methanesulfonate and 10 mm MOPS solution (pH 7.2). The effects of NAADP (10 nm) on the activity of RyR Ca2+ (RyR/Ca2+) release channels of the ER were determined, and the positive control with cADPR (10 nm) and its antagonist of Rya (50 μm) were used to validate the experimental condition. All doses of these compounds were based on previous studies (11Zhang F. Zhang G. Zhang A.Y. Koeberl M.J. Wallander E. Li P.L. Am. J. Physiol. Heart. 2006; 291: H274-H282Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 33Li P.L. Tang W.X. Valdivia H.H. Zou A.P. Campbell W.B. Am. J. Physiol. Heart. 2001; 280: H208-H215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and all compounds were added into the cis solution, with currents recorded at a holding potential of +40 mV. Identity of NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ Release Channels—Because both NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ release channel and TRP-ML1 present in lysosomes, previous studies demonstrated that they shared similar pharmacological properties (14Raychowdhury M.K. Gonzalez-Perrett S. Montalbetti N. Timpanaro G.A. Chasan B. Goldmann W.H. Stahl S. Cooney A. Goldin E. Cantiello H.F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 617-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 16Genazzani A.A. Mezna M. Dickey D.M. Michelangeli F. Walseth T.F. Galione A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 121: 1489-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). By using the reconstituted lipid bilayer methods, we further addressed whether the two channels were identical. We used an anti-TRP-ML1 polyclonal antibody (sc-26269, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), which was raised in goat against a peptide mapping at the C terminus of TRP-ML1 of mouse origin, to block the TRP-ML1 ion channel from lysosomes in the reconstituted bilayer. In these experiments, a serial diluted TRP-ML1 antibody was added to the bath solution at final concentrations of 1:5000, 1:500, and 1:50 for 5 min respectively, and then 500 nm NAADP was added. Before and after addition of NAADP, the channel currents were recorded at a holding potential of +40 mV. Normal goat serum was used as the substitute for goat polyclonal TRP-ML1 antibody for control experiments. Statistics—Data are presented as means ± S.E.; the significance of the differences in mean values between and within multiple groups was examined using an analysis of variance for repeated measures followed by a Duncan's multiple range test. A Student's t test was used to evaluate statistical significance of differences between two paired observations. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Purification and Identification of Lysosomes—The purity of lysosomes was demonstrated by determining some marker enzyme activity. As shown in Fig. 1A, the conversion rate of 4-nitrophenyl phosphate to 4-nitrophenyl by lysosome marker enzyme, acid phosphatase, were 0.98 ± 0.25, 15.33 ± 1.23, 0.59 ± 0.33, and 0.40 ± 0.27 μmol/h/mg protein in liver homogenates (Homo), lysosome (Lyso), endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and cell plasma membrane(PM) preparations, respectively. Fig. 1B shows that the reduction of cytochrome c by an ER marker enzyme, NADPH-cytochrome c reductase in the presence of NADPH was almost undetectable in the lysosome preparation. Similarly, Fig. 1C shows that the conversion of sodium thymidine 5′-monophosphate p-nitrophenyl ester to p-nitrophenyl by a cell plasma membrane marker enzyme, alkaline phosphodiesterase. The alkaline phosphodiesterase activity in lysosome preparation was 26.1 and 3.31 times lower than that in PM and Homo preparations, respectively. These results indicate that the isolated lysosomes are highly purified and free of ER and cell membrane contamination. In Fig. 1D, Western blot analysis shows that the purified lysosome (Lyso) fraction was recognized by antibodies against LAMP2, a lysosome-specific protein, and TRP-ML1, a known non-selective Ca2+ release channel, but not by anti-caveolin antibody. In contrast, in cell membrane preparations, neither LAMP2 nor TRP-ML1 were detectable. However, in the ER preparation, there was no protein that could be recognized by any of these three antibodies. Characterization of the Reconstituted Lysosomal Ca2+ Release Channels in the Planar Lipid Bilayer—Fig. 2A shows representative recordings of Ca2+ channel currents at holding potentials from–40 to +40 mV with symmetrical 300 mm cesium in cis and trans solution. Fig. 2B summarizes the relationship of holding potential and the channel current amplitude. It is clear that the channel current increased with the enhancement of holding potential. By calculation, the mean conductance for these lysosomal Cs+ currents was 174 pS with a reversal potential of ∼0 mV. When Cs+ gradients between cis/trans solution were changed from 300/300 mm to 200/300 mm or 300/200 mm, the equilibrium potential correspondingly varied from 0 mV to–9.2 or +9.5 mV, which was almost equivalent to the theoretical value of ±10.2 mV based on the Nernst equation. In addition, the NP0 of these Cs+ c"

PDI-accelerated factor Xa generation was blocked by bacitracin but not influenced by inhibition of vicinal thiols, reduction of PDI, changes in redox gradients, or covalent thiol modification of reduced PDI by N-ethylmaleimide or methyl-methanethiosulfonate, which abolished PDI oxidoreductase but not chaperone activity. PDI had no effect on fully active TF on either negatively charged phospholipids or in activating detergent, indicating that PDI selectively acts upon cryptic TF to facilitate ternary complex formation and macromolecular substrate turnover. PDI activation was reduced upon mutation of TF residues in proximity to the macromolecular substrate binding site, consistent with a primary interaction of PDI with TF. PDI enhanced TF coagulant activity on microvesicles shed from cells, suggesting that PDI plays a role as an activating chaperone for circulating cryptic TF.

TF plays an essential role in hemostasis (1Mackman N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 1015-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) by serving as a hemostatic envelope around blood vessels and tissues (2Drake T.A. Morrissey J.H. Edgington T.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1989; 134: 1087-1097PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, TF is present in blood, and microparticle-associated TF can be localized to thrombi and contribute to local fibrin formation (3Giesen P.L.A. Rauch U. Bohrmann B. Kling D. Roqué M.

Furie B.C. Furie B. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1175-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). TF also has nonhemostatic, signaling functions in angiogenesis, cancer progression, and inflammation that involve regulation of integrins and direct TF·VIIa signaling through protease-activated receptor 2 (5Dorfleutner A. Hintermann E. Tarui T. Takada Y. Ruf W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4416-4425Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 6Belting M. Ahamed J. Ruf W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

We recently showed that cell surface protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) is associated with inactive TF and targets the solvent-exposed, allosteric Cys186–Cys209 disulfide bond in TF to inhibit coagulation while maintaining direct TF·VIIa signaling (8Ahamed J. Versteeg H.H. Kerver M. Chen V.M. Mueller B.M. Hogg P.J. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 13932-13937Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In addition, we found that a strong oxidant can activate TF procoagulant activity specifically when TF is present in a signaling complex with protease-activated receptor 2 and PDI. The thiol dependence of TF activation under these conditions (8Ahamed J. Versteeg H.H. Kerver M. Chen V.M. Mueller B.M. Hogg P.J. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Piro O. Lu L. Broze Jr., G.J. Circulation. 2003; 108: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) that directs TF to low density microdomains (11Sevinsky J.R. Rao L.V.M. Ruf W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). A relatively small portion of total cellular TF is sufficient for procoagulant activity, and various amounts of noncoagulant or cryptic cell surface TF are present dependent on cell type, cellular differentiation, and proliferation (8Ahamed J. Versteeg H.H. Kerver M. Chen V.M. Mueller B.M. Hogg P.J. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 13932-13937Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 12Le D.T. Rapaport S.I. Rao L.V.M.

Location of TF to rafts or caveolae attenuates coagulant activity of TF (11Sevinsky J.R. Rao L.V.M. Ruf W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 14Mulder A.B.

On certain cells, TF may predominantly activate coagulation in cholesterol-rich microdomains (17Mandal S.K. Iakhiaev A. Pendurthi U.R. Rao L.V. Blood. 2005; 105: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Release of TF on microvesicles appears to involve raft domains and is cholesterol-dependent, but TF requires activation dependent on fusion of microvescicles with activated platelets (16Del Conde I. Shrimpton C.N. Thiagarajan P. Lopez J.A. Blood. 2005; 106: 1604-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). In this and other systems (13Bach R.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2006; 26: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) and increased availability of procoagulant lipids are important factors that contribute to coagulation that is initiated by TF. However, interference with redox and thiol pathways can enhance TF activity independent of PS (9Chen V.M. Ahamed J. Versteeg H.H. Berndt M.C. Ruf W. Hogg P.J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12020-12028Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 18Le D. Rapaport S. Rao L.V.M. Thromb. Haemost. 1994; 72: 848-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Mutational elimination of the allosteric Cys186–Cys209 disulfide abolishes TF coagulant function (8Ahamed J. Versteeg H.H. Kerver M. Chen V.M. Mueller B.M. Hogg P.J. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

This disulfide is partially exposed to solvent and becomes buried under the Gla domain of VIIa when the TF·VIIa complex forms (20Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chène C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). The Cys186–Cys209 disulfide further stabilizes an extended loop that contains several residues involved in the binding of macromolecular substrate FX (21Norledge B. Petrovan R.J. Ruf W. Olson A. Proteins. 2003; 53: 640-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Together, these structural features explain why affinity for VIIa is somewhat reduced and substrate FX activation is severely impaired upon breaking of the disulfide (8Ahamed J. Versteeg H.H. Kerver M. Chen V.M. Mueller B.M. Hogg P.J. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 13932-13937Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 19Rehemtulla A. Ruf W. Edgington T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10294-10299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activation of macromolecular substrate FX involves binding to an extended exosite that is formed by TF and a region in the VIIa protease domain distant from the catalytic center (21Norledge B. Petrovan R.J. Ruf W. Olson A. Proteins. 2003; 53: 640-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 22Dickinson C.D. Kelly C.R. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Because these extended contacts are largely unaffected by the zymogen activation of FX to FXa (21Norledge B. Petrovan R.J. Ruf W. Olson A. Proteins. 2003; 53: 640-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), FXa retains a relatively high affinity for TF·VIIa (24Baugh R.J. Dickinson C.D. Ruf W. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28826-28833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 25Shobe J. Dickinson C.D. Edgington T.S. Ruf W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24171-24175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). As a consequence, product release can be a rate-limiting factor in substrate turnover by TF·VIIa. The rate-enhancing effect of PS on these reactions may be caused by facilitated substrate release (13Bach R.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2006; 26: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 26Krishnaswamy S. Field K.A. Edgington T.S. Morrissey J.H. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26110-26120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to changes in PS exposure, TF activity in thrombosis may be regulated by PDI, because PDI is released from activated platelets and found associated with the platelet surface (27Essex D.W. Chen K. Swiatkowska M. Blood. 1995; 86: 2168-2173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PDI, a 64-kDa protein normally found in the endoplasmic reticulum, has both oxidoreductase and isomerase activity, thus facilitating thiol/disulfide exchange reactions during protein folding (28Wilkinson B. Gilbert H.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1699: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). In addition, PDI has chaperone function (29Hayano T. Hirose M. Kikuchi M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and PDI has denitrosylase (30Sliskovic I. Raturi A. Mutus B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8733-8741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and transnitrosylase activity that mediates cellular uptake of nitric oxide (NO) (31Zai A.

Because of the unique extracellular redox environment, cell surface PDI probably performs specific functions that are distinct from endoplasmic reticulum-localized PDI (37Root P. Sliskovic I. Mutus B. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that PDI enhances TF procoagulant activity on microvesicles generated in vitro. In a defined system with purified proteins, we further demonstrate that PDI accelerates macromolecular substrate FX activation of soluble TF that is known to have low procoagulant activity (38Ruf W. Rehemtulla A. Morrissey J.H. Edgington T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2158-2166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our data show that PDI acts on oxidized TF independent of the oxidoreductase activity of PDI. Whereas PDI on cells inactivates the procoagulant activity of TF by NO-dependent pathways, the data presented here indicate that PDI also participates in activating cryptic TF through the chaperone activity of PDI. This study provides new insight into the interaction of PDI with the ternary TF initiation complex. Materials—Bovine PDI, reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione, phenylarsenic oxide (PAO), methyl-methanethio-sulfonate (MMTS), N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), and bacitracin were purchased from Sigma. Bacitracin was repurified by gel filtration to eliminate enzymatic activity that degrades PDI (39Rogelj S. Reiter K.J. Kesner L. Li M. Essex D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 829-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The NO-donor sodium nitroprusside was from Alexis (Carlsbad, CA), and N-(3-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin (MPB) was from Invitrogen. The glutathione-reactive antibody (αGSH) was from Virogen (Watertown, MA). Proteins—Monoclonal antibodies 5G9 and 10H10 to TF and polyclonal rabbit anti-TF cytoplasmic domain antibody have been previously described (8Ahamed J. Versteeg H.H. Kerver M. Chen V.M. Mueller B.M.

Biol. 1998; 275: 873-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Isotype-matched control antibody TIB115 to the viral large T antigen was obtained from ATCC. Soluble TF (TF-(1–218)) was expressed in Escherichia coli, as previously described (42Stone M.J. Ruf W. Miles D.J. Edgington T.S. Wright P.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 43Doñate F. Kelly C.R. Ruf W. Edgington T.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11467-11476Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein was prepared from inclusion bodies, solubilized, reduced, and refolded in 0.8 m guanidine HCl, 0.3 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, in a redox gradient of 2.5 mm GSH and 0.5 mm GSSG. Mutants with an unpaired Cys186 or Cys209 were refolded in the same buffer in the presence of sodium nitroprusside added to 2.5 mm at the beginning of the folding reaction and again 2 h later at the same concentration, based on initial observations that indicated better yield of monomeric mutants under these conditions. Refolded protein was recovered after extensive dialysis and concentrated, followed by gel filtration to separate monomeric mutant from higher molecular weight aggregates and dimers. Removal of the expression tag by thrombin was omitted to avoid degradation of the mutants. Wild-type soluble TF with an attached expression tag were used as controls. The TFK149A/D150A mutant was expressed as a fusion protein with a carboxyl-terminal leucine zipper domain (43Doñate F. Kelly C.R. Ruf W. Edgington T.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11467-11476Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), which was chosen to improve poor refolding efficiency of the mutant. Characterization of this mutant was in comparison with the same construct of wild-type TF. The VIIaDVQA mutant was kindly provided by Dr. Lars Petersen, Novo Nordisk. FX was purified from plasma (44Fair D.S. Plow E.F. Edgington T.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1979; 64: 884-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and VII contamination was eliminated by a subsequent immunopurification step, as previously described (22Dickinson C.D. Kelly C.R. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14379-14384Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Detection of Free Thiols in Wild-type Soluble TF—Free thiol content of soluble wild type was determined by the Ellman reaction using Cys as a standard. The sensitivity of the assay would have detected the reduction of 1% of the allosteric disulfide in TF. Soluble TF was further labeled with polyethylene glycol-maleimide (PEG-mal), which reacts with free thiols to add 5 kDa per modified Cys residue on SDS-PAGE. Typically, soluble TF was labeled with 5 mm PEG-mal at 37 °C for 60 min in the presence or absence of reducing agents or PDI. Control reactions under denaturing (0.8% SDS) conditions showed no appreciable difference in the degree of PEG-mal labeling. In order to remove excess PEG-mal, TF was precipitated with acetone and resuspended in sample buffer for SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with polyclonal anti-TF. Cell Culture and Generation of TF-positive Microparticles—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were passaged in endothelial cell basal medium, prepared with endothelial medium supplement (Cambrex, Walkersville, MD), and transduced with adenovirus encoding TF and protease-activated receptor 2, as previously described (8Ahamed J. Versteeg H.H. Kerver M. Chen V.M. Mueller B.M. Hogg P.J. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 13932-13937Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). After 2 days, cells were transferred to serum-free Medium 199, supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2, l-glutamine, and HEPES to collect released microparticles for 5 h. The supernatant was cleared from cellular debris at 14,000 × g for 10 min. Cleared supernatant was used without further manipulations for FXa generation assays or immunodepletion using Dynabeads coupled with anti-TF 5G9 or isotype-matched control TIB115. TF immunoprecipitated from 1 ml of supernatant was used for Western blotting with immunopurified, polyclonal goat anti-TF, or a rabbit anti-TF cytoplasmic domain antibody (40Dorfleutner A. Ruf W. Blood. 2003; 102: 3998-4005Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Blots were digitized for densitometry by using Scion Image (Scion, Frederick, MD). Chemical Modification of PDI with MMTS/NEM and PDI Functional Assays—PDI (16 μm) was reduced with 1 mm DTT for 1 h at ambient temperature. Reduced PDI was then reacted with 20 mm MMTS for 1 h followed by dialysis against HBS. Efficiency of MMTS modification was determined by labeling residual free thiols with 100 μm MPB for 30 min at ambient temperature, followed by Western blotting to detect biotin incorporation. For NEM modification, reduced PDI was reacted after 4-fold dilution with 1 mm NEM, followed by dialysis as above. Reductase activity of MMTS-treated PDI was measured by an insulin turbidity assay (45Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9627-9632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 800 nm PDI, PDI in the presence of 100 μm PAO or 3 mm bacitracin, or MMTS-modified PDI was added to a solution of 100 mm K2HPO4,2mm EDTA, 500 μm GSH, 75 μm insulin. Changes in insulin turbidity were measured for 20 min at 650 nm in a kinetic microplate reader. Chaperone activity of MMTS-modified PDI was determined by rhodanese aggregation assay with the following modifications (46Song J.L. Wang C.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Rhodanese (1 mg/ml) was first denatured in 5.6 m urea and 10 mm DTT. Rhodanese was diluted 1:100 in 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, to induce protein aggregation. PDI or MMTS-modified PDI (1 μm) were added, and protein aggregation was monitored at 405 nm over a 15-min time period. FXa Generation and Amidolytic Assays—FXa generation assays were performed in HBS (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 5.3 mm KCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2). Typically, 25 nm TF, VIIa, and PDI were used to activate 1 μm substrate FX, and aliquots were quenched in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm EDTA at defined times for a chromogenic assay with Spectrozyme FXa. PDI inhibitors bacitracin (3 mm) and PAO (100 μm) were added at the start of the reaction. FXa generation assays using supernatant containing microparticles were performed with the same VIIa and FX concentrations, and PDI was added as indicated. Amidolytic activity of the TF·VIIa complex was assayed as described before (47Ruf W. Kalnik M.W. Lund-Hansen T. Edgington T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15719-15725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, complexes of the indicated concentrations of TF and VIIa were formed in HBS in the presence of 1 mm Spectrozyme FXa, and conversion of substrate by TF·VIIa was continuously monitored in a kinetic plate reader at 405 nm. All data are presented as means and S.D. from at least three repeat experiments. TF Immunoprecipitation of Reaction Mixtures—25 nm TF-(1–218) and VIIa in the presence or absence of 25 nm PDI were incubated with 1 μm FX at 37 °C, in a total volume of 300 μl for 0, 5, 30, 60, or 90 min. Samples were quenched in 900 μl of 100 mm EDTA in HBS, and TF was precipitated with anti-TF 9C3 coupled to paramagnetic beads at 4 °C. TF, FX/Xa, and PDI in the immuno-precipitate were detected by Western blotting. PDI Enhances TF·VIIa-dependent FXa Generation—In order to characterize the interaction of TF and PDI in a purified system, we expressed wild-type soluble TF or mutants that retained either Cys186(TFC209A) or Cys209 (TFC186A)of the allosteric disulfide. TF has an additional extracellular disulfide (Cys49–Cys57) that is buried and not required for function (19Rehemtulla A. Ruf W. Edgington T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10294-10299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE showed homogeneity of the purified proteins (Fig. 1A). Because the refolding reaction contained glutathione, we addressed whether wild-type or mutants became glutathionated during refolding. Western blotting with anti-glutathione antibody demonstrated that no glutathione was incorporated into wild-type TF or TFC209A, but detectable in TFC186A, indicating that Cys209 is prone to glutathionation (Fig. 1B). Disulfide formation of wild-type TF was confirmed by the Ellman reaction, which did not detect free thiols in wild-type TF. Reactivity of the conformation-sensitive antibody 5G9 to the carboxyl terminus of TF also indicated that the Cys186- Cys209 disulfide was intact. In addition, labeling of TF with PEG-mal, which increases the molecular mass of proteins by 5 kDa for each modified Cys residue, produced a molecular weight shift for only a small percentage of the wild-type soluble TF preparation (Fig. 1C), whereas 50% or more of the soluble TF preparation was modified after reduction with DTT. Note that competition of excess DTT over PEG-mal probably prevented complete modification of reduced TF. In addition, purified bovine PDI or VIIa had no appreciable effect on PEG-mal labeling of soluble TF, indicating that neither the physiological ligand nor PDI promote reduction of TF in solution. The Cys186–Cys209 disulfide is necessary for binding of the VIIa Gla domain to TF, and consistently both soluble mutants showed decreased affinity for VIIa in an amidolytic assay that measures TF-dependent allosteric activation of VIIa catalytic activity. However, no differences were seen at saturating concentrations of mutants (data not shown). Both mutants had low activity in a macromolecular substrate FX activation assay, and the addition of purified PDI had no appreciable effect on FXa generation by the mutants alone or in combination (Fig. 1D), consistent with the accepted view that formation of the disulfide is required for efficient substrate FX binding. Unexpectedly, PDI enhanced substrate FX activation by wild-type soluble TF 5–10-fold. Elimination of VIIa or TF from the reaction showed that PDI was not contaminated with a protease or a cofactor that induced activation of FX independent of TF·VIIa (Fig. 1E). PDI interaction with partially unfolded proteins is influenced by glycosylation, and TF is glycosylated at three N-linked sites in the extracellular domain (42Stone M.J. Ruf W. Miles D.J. Edgington T.S. Wright P.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In order to exclude the possibility that the observed rate enhancing effect of PDI is an artifact of the nonglycosylated preparation of E. coli-derived soluble TF, we analyzed glycosylated soluble TF secreted from yeast or mammalian Chinese hamster ovary cell expression systems (38Ruf W. Rehemtulla A. Morrissey J.H. Edgington T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2158-2166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Stone M.J. Ruf W. Miles D.J. Edgington T.S. Wright P.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). All three preparations had the same basal activity, and in each case PDI enhanced the activity to a similar extent (Fig. 1F). Eukaryotic soluble TF was not refolded but rather secreted from cells. These data also exclude the possibility that the refolding protocol for E. coli-derived TF introduced an artificial inactive state. Although soluble TF has no defect in promoting the allosteric activation of VIIa catalytic activity toward small chromogenic substrates, macromolecular substrate binds to an exosite of the VIIa protease domain that is conformationally labile (23Dickinson C.D. Shobe J. Ruf W. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 959-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 48Ruf W. Dickinson C.D. Trends Cardiovasc.

Chem. 2006; 281: 24873-24888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). One possibility was that PDI accelerated macromolecular substrate turnover by influencing allosteric activation of the VIIa exosite for macromolecular substrate. To address this issue, we first analyzed a mutant of VIIa (VIIaV21D/E154V/M156Q/K188A;VIIaDVQA) that is representative for a series of mutants that do not require allosteric activation by TF and activate FX efficiently in the absence of cofactor (50Petrovan R.J. Ruf W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6616-6620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 51Petrovan R.J. Ruf W.

A. 2001; 98: 13583-13588Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). PDI did not increase the activity of this mutant in the absence of TF but enhanced FXa generation when TF was added (Fig. 1G). These data show that PDI does not influence the allosteric activation of VIIa but rather has a specific effect on TF to enhance turnover of substrate FX. PDI Specifically Targets Cryptic TF—Soluble TF has low activity that can be enhanced by phospholipids (38Ruf W. Rehemtulla A. Morrissey J.H. Edgington T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2158-2166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 53Fiore M.M. Neuenschwander P.F. Morrissey J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 143-149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Increasing concentrations of phospholipids accelerated FXa generation by soluble TF and progressively diminished the rate enhancing effect of PDI (F"
https://openalex.org/W2054812884,"The mammalian DNA glycosylase, NEIL1, specific for repair of oxidatively damaged bases in the genome via the base excision repair pathway, is activated by reactive oxygen species and prevents toxicity due to radiation. We show here that the Werner syndrome protein (WRN), a member of the RecQ family of DNA helicases, associates with NEIL1 in the early damage-sensing step of base excision repair. WRN stimulates NEIL1 in excision of oxidative lesions from bubble DNA substrates. The binary interaction between NEIL1 and WRN (KD = 60 nm) involves C-terminal residues 288-349 of NEIL1 and the RecQ C-terminal (RQC) region of WRN, and is independent of the helicase activity WRN. Exposure to oxidative stress enhances the NEIL-WRN association concomitant with their strong nuclear co-localization. WRN-depleted cells accumulate some prototypical oxidized bases (e.g. 8-oxoguanine, FapyG, and FapyA) indicating a physiological function of WRN in oxidative damage repair in mammalian genomes.

Brain Res. 2000; 855,: 116-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Most oxidized bases in DNA are repaired via the base excision repair (BER) pathway (5Krokan H.E. Nilsen H. Skorpen F.

Mammalian BER consists of two sub-pathways: short-patch (SP-BER) and long-patch (LP-BER) (8Fortini P. Pascucci B. Parlanti E. Sobol R.W. Wilson S.H. Dogliotti E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37,: 3575-3580Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Both pathways are initiated with excision of the damaged base by a DNA glycosylase, followed by cleavage of the DNA backbone by AP endonuclease (APE1) or by the intrinsic AP lyase activity in the case of oxidized base-specific glycosylases (6Mitra S. Hazra T.K. Roy R. Ikeda S. Biswas T. Lock J. Boldogh I. Izumi T. Mol. Cells. 1997; 7,: 305-312PubMed Google Scholar). The strand cleavage by the APE1 generates 3′-OH and 5′-deoxyribose phosphate termini, whereas the AP lyases produce 3′-blocking phosphoribose or phosphate together with 5′-phosphate termini. In the subsequent step in SP-BER, DNA polymerase β (pol β) with intrinsic 5′-deoxyri-bose phosphate lyase activity carries out both 5′-end cleaning and DNA repair synthesis with incorporation of a single nucleotide at the site of the base damage (9Matsumoto Y.

WRN is mutated in the human autosomal recessive disease Werner syndrome (WS) with a number of phenotypes, including premature aging, genome instability, and cancer predisposition (21Martin G.M.

Genet. 1996; 13,: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). WRN has been implicated in various DNA metabolic pathways, including replication, recombination, and repair (23Opresko P.L.

A role for WRN in the repair of oxidative DNA damage is supported by its association with BER proteins as observed earlier, including APE1, pol β, FEN1, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (25Ahn B.

Here, we provide evidence for a novel physical and functional interaction between WRN and NEIL1, whereby WRN stimulates the glycosylase activity of NEIL1. Oxidative stress enhances this association, and depletion of WRN leads to accumulation of oxidatively induced base lesions in cells. Taken together, our observations strongly suggest that WRN plays a significant role in oxidative DNA damage repair via an important association with NEIL1. Cell Cultures and Knockdown Assays—The human colorectal carcinoma line HCT116 (expressing wild-type p53), a generous gift of Dr. B. Vogelstein (The Johns Hopkins University), was cultured in McCoy's 5A modified medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml; Invitrogen). At 70% confluence, the cells were transfected and/or treated with glucose oxidase (GO, Roche Applied Science) at 100 ng/ml for 1 h, followed by washing with and incubation in fresh medium. This treatment did not affect cell viability, as judged by the rate of cell growth. The osteosarcoma cell line U-2 OS was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. U-2 OS cells stably expressing a short hairpin RNA (Ambion) that is not homologous to any known human gene (WT) or a WRN short hairpin RNA (KD) were generated as described previously (34Harrigan J.A. Wilson D.M. Prasad R. Opresko P.L. Beck G. May A. Wilson S.H. Bohr V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34,: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin, and hygromycin B (0.2 mg/ml, Invitrogen). For down-regulation of NEIL1, initially an ON-Target Plus SMART pool set of four (LU-008327-00-0005, Human NEIL1, NM_024608) siRNAs was purchased from Dharmacon and used according to the manufacturer's protocol. This was followed by using each of the individual siRNAs (N1 to N4) to optimize NEIL1 depletion whereby the N3 (J-008327-06) siRNA resulted in maximum effect. Subsequently N3 was optimized at a dose of 80 nm to produce both single and double KD of NEIL1. Total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) to monitor the level of NEIL1 expression by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (Molecular Genomics core facility, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston). Proteins—Full-length NEIL1 and the C-terminal deletion fragments of NEIL1 (NEIL1Δ40 and NEIL1Δ101) were purified as described previously (14Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Boldogh I. Imhoff B. Kow Y.W. Jaruga P.

To examine the domain structure of NEIL1, we carried out limited proteolytic digestion of NEIL1 with endoproteinase Asp-N (Roche Applied Science). Two major non-overlapping domains consisting of N-terminal (residues 1-311) and C-terminal (residues 312-389) fragments were identified by N-terminal sequencing and mass spectroscopic analysis in the Protein Chemistry core facility (University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston). The 78-amino acid C-terminal fragment of NEIL1 was purified as a GST-tagged polypeptide, from which the GST was cleaved by thrombin. WRN wild-type or mutant fragments were cloned into Gate-way pDEST 15 (Invitrogen) or pGEX-KG vectors and expressed and purified in Escherichia coli. Recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged proteins were purified as described previously (35von Kobbe C. Thoma N.H. Czyzewski B.K. Pavletich N.P. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278,: 52997-53006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). K-WRN (K577M) was expressed and purified using the Bac-N-Blue transfection kit (Invitrogen). High titer stocks were made, and the protein was expressed in Sf9 cells. The cells were lysed by freeze-thawing, and the protein was purified on a nickel-agarose column as described previously. Co-immunoprecipitation—HCT116 cells were transfected separately with 1 μg of empty FLAG vector and FLAG-tagged expression constructs for NEIL1 (constructed in pCMV-C-FLAG, Sigma) and OGG1 (constructed in C-terminal pCMV-N-FLAG, Sigma) (36Bhakat K.K. Mokkapati S.K. Boldogh I. Hazra T.K. Mitra S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26,: 1654-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). 48 h post-transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed with cold lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma), and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The cell extracts (2 mg/ml) were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma), washed thoroughly with cold TBS (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl), and assayed for the presence of WRN in the complex by immunoblotting with antibody specific for the C terminus of WRN (Bethyl Laboratories). Oxidative stress on cells was imposed by GO treatment as described previously (36Bhakat K.K. Mokkapati S.K. Boldogh I. Hazra T.K. Mitra S. Mol. Cell.

GST-pulldown Assays—GST-pulldown assays were performed as described previously (26Jr. Brosh R.M. von Kobbe C. Sommers J.A. Karmakar P. Opresko P.L. Piotrowski J. Dianova I. Dianov G.L. Bohr V.A.

Briefly, glutathione-Sepharose beads (50 μl, 50% v/v), alone or bound to 1 ml of GST-tagged WRN polypeptides, were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 100 μg of HCT116 nuclear extract prepared as described previously (39Nada S. Chang P.K. Dignam J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268,: 7660-7667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or purified recombinant NEIL1 (0.1 μg) in 250 μl of buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol). The bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with anti-NEIL1 antibody (Alpha Diagnostics, San Antonio, TX) and anti-GST antibody (GE Amersham Biosciences) for Western analysis. Far Western Analysis—The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10%), transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, treated with 6 m guanidine-HCl, and then renatured with successive dilutions of guanidine-HCl in PBS, 1 mm dithiothreitol (40Jayaraman L. Moorthy N.C. Murthy K.G. Manley J.L. Bustin M. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12,: 462-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). After blocking with 5% nonfat dry milk in blocking buffer (PBS, 0.5% Tween 20), the membranes were incubated with the indicated protein in the blocking buffer for 3 h at 4 °C before immunoblot analysis with corresponding antibodies. Intrinsic Fluorescence Studies—The binding of WRN and NEIL1 was monitored by the decrease in intrinsic fluorescence of WRN HlcRQC tryptophan residues (λex = 295 nm, λem = 300-450 nm) upon titration with NEIL1 peptide78. All binding experiments were performed in buffer A (20 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, and 150 mm KCl, pH 7.5) at 25 °C for an incubation time of 5 min. The fluorescence was measured in a LS50 spectrofluorometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a QS cell of light path 1 cm. HlcRQC (0.25 μm) was titrated with increasing concentrations (0 to 0.25 μm) of NEIL1 peptide78. Spectra were corrected for buffer scattering and sample dilution. The intensity of Raman scattering was recorded (NEIL1p78 contains no tryptophan residues) for the titration by adding NEIL1 peptide78 to the HlcRQC solution, where addition of NEIL1p78 to buffer in a similar manner was served as blank. Each fluorescence spectrum represents an average of five recordings. The RecQC-NEIL1 interaction was analyzed by iterative fitting of the experimental data to the ligand binding equation: y = Bmax·x/KD + x (41Dziewulska-Szwajkowska D. Zmojdzian M. Dobryszycki P.

Acta. 2006; 1760,: 1845-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). KD was calculated from SigmaPlot analysis, whereby we plotted ΔF(F0 - F) versus concentration of the ligand (NEIL1 peptide78) according to the equation, ΔF =ΔFmax·[NEIL1p78]/(KD + [NEIL1p78]). ΔF or (F0 - F) represents the change in HlcRQC tryptophan fluorescence intensity at 345 nm when HlcRQC was titrated, with NEIL1p78; F0 and ΔFmax are the fluorescence values when [NEIL1p78] = 0 and at saturation, respectively, [NEIL1p78] being the concentration of the ligand. WRN Helicase and Exonuclease Assays—Helicase reactions were performed as previously described (29von Kobbe C. Harrigan J.A. Schreiber V. Stiegler P. Piotrowski J. Dawut L. Bohr V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32,: 4003-4014Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, oligonucleotides Bub19T (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.) or Mix 3 (Midland Certified Reagent Co.) were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and annealed to their respective complementary strands, Bub19B (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.) or Mix 4 (Midland Certified Reagent Co.). Sequences of the oligonucleotides are shown in Table 1. Reactions (20 μl) were performed in helicase reaction buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 4 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA) and contained ATP (2 mm), DNA substrate (1 nm), WRN, and NEIL1 as indicated. Samples were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C and terminated by the addition of stop dye (50 mm EDTA, 40% glycerol, 0.9% SDS, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol). Products were run on a 12% native polyacrylamide gel and visualized using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences).TABLE 1Oligonucleotides used in this studyOligonucleotideSequence (5′→3′)aX = 5-OHU or 8-oxo-G; Y = FapyG; bold indicates non-complementary regions.B11(X) USGCTTAGCTTGGAATCGTATCATGTAXACTCGTGTGCCGTGTAGACCGTGCCB11(X) DSGGCACGGTCTACACGGCACAAACAGCCCACGGATACGATTCCAAGCTAAGCB12 (Y) USTGGCGTTCAACGTGCAGTYTCAGCACGTCCCATGGTB12 (Y) DSACCATGGGACGTCACCCACACCACCGTTGAACGCCABub19TGCTTAGCTTGGAATCGTATCATGTAGACTCGTGTGCCGTGTAGACCGTGCCBub19BGGCACGGTCTACACGGACACAACACCCCACCACCCCGATTCCAAGCTAAGCMix3TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTGAGTGTGGTGTACATGCACTACMix4GTAGTGCATGTACACCACACTCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTa X = 5-OHU or 8-oxo-G; Y = FapyG; bold indicates non-complementary regions.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32,: 4003-4014Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, oligonucleotide Bub19T was 5′-end-labeled and annealed to Bub19B. Reactions (10 μl) were performed in helicase reaction buffer (see above), DNA substrate (1 nm), WRN, and NEIL1 as indicated. Samples were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of formamide stop dye (80% formamide, 0.5× TBE, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 0.1% xylene cyanol). The products were heat-denatured at 90 °C for 5 min, separated on a 14% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, and analyzed as before. DNA Strand Incision Assay for NEIL1—NEIL1 substrates used were 51-mer oligonucleotides (purchased from Midland Co.) with the damaged base (5-OHU or 8-oxo-G) at residue 26 (indicated by X, Table 1) and 36-mer oligonucleotides, with FapyG at residue 13 (indicated by Y, Table 1). Oligonucleotides containing FapyG were prepared as previously described (43Haraguchi K. Greenberg M.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123,: 8636-8637Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The damage-containing oligonucleotides, named B11US and B12US, were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase before annealing to the complementary oligonucleotides, B11DS and B12 US (Invitrogen), respectively, containing a C opposite the lesion. DNA strand cleavage at the site of the lesion due to the intrinsic AP-lyase activity of NEIL1 after base excision was assayed by incubation of 32P-labeled X or Y containing substrates with NEIL1 (20 fmol) alone or together with WRN (20-80 fmol) or its fragments as indicated in a buffer containing (40 mm Tris, pH 8, 4 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 μg/μl BSA) at 37 °C for 15 min. After stopping the reaction with 70% formamide/30 mm NaOH, the products were analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis. ATP as indicated was used at a final concentration of 2 mm. The radioactivity was analyzed as before. For enzyme kinetics studies, the oligonucleotides (3.2-125 nm) were incubated with NEIL1 or NEIL1 plus WRN for 4 min at 37 °C. The linear reaction rate, Km, and kcat were calculated by linear regression analysis using SigmaPlot. Quantitation of 8-oxo-G, FapyG, and FapyA—8-Oxo-G was measured as its nucleoside 8-oxo-dG in cellular DNA by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry with isotope dilution technique using 8-oxo-dG-15N5 as an internal standard as described previously (44Hu J. de Souza-Pinto N.C.

FapyG and FapyA were measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry as described previously (45Jaruga P. Speina E. Gackowski D. Tudek B. Olinski R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28,: E16Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Statistical significance was determined by paired t test and analysis of variance. Immunostaining and Confocal Imaging—5 × 104 cells per dish were grown to 50% confluency on glass coverslips (25 mm) in 5% CO2 and at 37 °C. After treatment with and without GO, the cells were washed with PBS, dried, and fixed in acetone-methanol 1:1 (v/v). After exposure to heterologous pre-immune serum (0.1 μg in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.5% BSA; PBS-T) for 30 min, the cells were incubated with primary antibody (rabbit polyclonal anti-NEIL1 or mouse monoclonal anti-WRN), and counterstained with fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 60 min at 37 °C and washed in PBS-T. The cell nuclei were stained for 15 min with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride, 10 ng/ml, and mounted in anti-fade medium (Dako Inc., Carpinteria, CA) on microscope slides. Confocal microscopy was performed on a Zeiss LSM510 META system with the 488 nm line of the argon laser for excitation of fluorescein isothiocyanate and helium-neon 543 nm line excitation of rhodamine, combined with appropriate dichroic mirrors, and emission band filters to discriminate between green and red fluorescence. Images were captured at a magnification of ×60. Co-localization was visualized by superimposition of green and red images using MetaMorph software version 4.6r9 (Universal Imaging Corp.). The co-localization coefficient shows extent of superimposition in the green channel with respect to the red channel. Briefly, the regions of interest were drawn to include the structures after the individual channels were thresholded. Scatter plots were generated, and coefficients of co-localization were calculated (46Boschman G.A. Rens W. Manders E.M. Slater R.M. Versteeg R. Aten J.A.

Identification of WRN as a NEIL1 Interacting Protein—NEIL1 has previously been shown to stably interact with several BER proteins (18Wiederhold L. Leppard J.B. Kedar P. Karimi-Busheri F.

To further elucidate the cellular role played by this enzyme in oxidized base repair we decided to identify other possible NEIL1 interacting partners by co-immunoprecipitation analysis. For this HCT116 cells were transfected with NEIL1-FLAG, OGG1-FLAG, or empty FLAG expression plasmids, and whole cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody beads (Sigma). WRN could be identified as an interacting protein in the NEIL1-FLAG IP but not in the vector IP or OGG1 IP (Fig. 1A) when probed with anti-WRN antibody. Equal amounts of lysates used for pulldown assays are shown as input. The absence of WRN in an OGG1 IP provided an appropriate negative control, as well as evidence for the specificity of the WRN/NEIL1 association. These results indicate the existence of WRN in a complex with NEIL1 in vivo. Direct Association between NEIL1 and WRN: Mapping of WRN Interacting Domain—To test for physical interaction between NEIL1 and WRN, we performed affinity pulldown experiments with various recombinant WRN fragments expressed as GST-fusion polypeptides and nuclear extracts from HCT116 cells.

https://openalex.org/W2077405556,"Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), an important chemokine whose expression is increased during the course of obesity, plays a role in macrophage infiltration into obese adipose tissue. This study was designed to elucidate the role of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) in the induction of MCP-1 during the course of adipocyte hypertrophy. We examined the time course of MKP-1 and MCP-1 mRNA expression and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation in the adipose tissue from mice rendered mildly obese by a short term high fat diet. We also studied the role of MKP-1 in the induction of MCP-1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes during the course of adipocyte hypertrophy. MCP-1 mRNA expression was increased, followed by ERK activation and down-regulation of MKP-1, an inducible dual specificity phosphatase to inactivate ERK, in the adipose tissue at the early stage of obesity induced by a short term high fat diet, when macrophages are not infiltrated. Down-regulation of MKP-1 preceded ERK activation and increased production of MCP-1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes in vitro during the course of adipocyte hypertrophy. Adenovirus-mediated restoration of MKP-1 in hypertrophied 3T3-L1 adipocytes reduced the otherwise increased ERK phosphorylation, thereby leading to the significant reduction of MCP-1 mRNA expression. This study provides evidence that the down-regulation of MKP-1 is critical for increased production of MCP-1 during the course of adipocyte hypertrophy.

These findings have led us to speculate that macrophages, when infiltrated, may participate in the inflammatory pathways that are activated in obese adipose tissue.A previous study with bone marrow transplantation demonstrated that most macrophages in the adipose tissue are derived from the bone marrow (4Weisberg S.P. McCann D. Desai M. Rosenbaum M. Leibel R.L. Ferrante Jr., A.W. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1796-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (7308) Google Scholar). In this regard, adipose tissue expression of MCP-1, a major chemokine implicated in the control of monocyte recruitment to the site of inflammation, is increased during the progression of obesity (8Chen A. Mumick S. Zhang C. Lamb J. Dai H. Weingarth D. Mudgett J. Chen H. MacNeil D.J. Reitman M.L. Qian S. Obes. Res. 2005; 13: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 9Takahashi K.

Diabetes. 2005; 54: 2277-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that increased production of MCP-1 may be an initial event at the early stage of obesity so as to accumulate macrophages in the adipose tissue. Recently, Kanda et al. and Kamei et al. (11Kamei N. Tobe K. Suzuki R. Ohsugi M. Watanabe T. Kubota N. Ohtsuka-Kowatari N. Kumagai K. Sakamoto K. Kobayashi M. Yamauchi T. Ueki K. Oishi Y. Nishimura S.

Investig. 2006; 116: 1494-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1920) Google Scholar) have independently reported that MCP-1 plays a role in the recruitment of macrophages into obese adipose tissue. It is, therefore, important to know the molecular mechanism for increased production of MCP-1 at the early stage of obesity. Recent studies have demonstrated that multiple intracellular signaling pathways are activated in adipocytes during the course of adipocyte hypertrophy in vitro and in obese adipose tissue in vivo. However, how the inflammatory pathways are activated in adipocytes at the early stage of obesity is still poorly understood.Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38 MAPK, and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) are activated in a variety of cellular processes (13Johnson G.L. Lapadat R. Science. 2002; 298: 1911-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (3439) Google Scholar). Once activated by the upstream kinases, e.g. MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK), MAPKs are rapidly inactivated by a family of protein phosphatases such as MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1), an inducible dual specificity phosphatase (14Farooq A. Zhou M.M. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 15Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Sakaue et al. showed previously that MKP-1 plays an essential role in 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation through ERK down-regulation (16Sakaue H. Ogawa W. Nakamura T. Mori T. Nakamura K. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39951-39957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Bost et al. (17Bost F. Aouadi M. Caron L. Even P. Belmonte N. Prot M. Dani C. Hofman P. Pages G. Pouyssegur J. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Binetruy B. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 402-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) reported that mice lacking ERK1 (ERK1-/- mice) are protected from high fat diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. These findings, taken together, suggest that the MAPK pathways play an important role in the adipocyte proliferation and differentiation in vitro and in vivo (18Rosen E.D. MacDougald O.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 885-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar).Here we show that MCP-1 mRNA expression is increased, which is followed by ERK activation and MKP-1 down-regulation in the adipose tissue from mice rendered mildly obese by a short term high fat diet, when macrophages are not infiltrated. We also demonstrate that ERK activation through MKP-1 down-regulation is involved in increased production of MCP-1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes during the course of adipocyte hypertrophy. This study provides evidence that MKP-1 down-regulation is critical for the inflammatory changes in hypertrophied adipocytes at the early stage of obesity, thereby suggesting that MKP-1 activation may offer a novel therapeutic strategy to treat or reduce the inflammatory changes in adipocytes during the progression of obesity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against ERK, phospho-ERK, p38 MAPK, phospho-p38 MAPK, MEK1/2, phospho-MEK1/2, MEK inhibitors PD98059 and U0126, and a p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580 were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against JNK, phospho-JNK, and MKP-1 and a mouse monoclonal antibody against Lamin A/C were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma or Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan).Animal Studies—Four-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories Japan (Tokyo, Japan). The animals were housed in a temperature-, humidity-, and light-controlled room (12-h light and 12-h dark cycle) and allowed free access to water and chow. Five-week-old mice were fed either the standard chow (Oriental MF, 362 kcal/100 g, 5.4% energy as fat; Oriental Yeast, Tokyo, Japan) or high fat diet (D12492, 524 kcal/100 g, 60% energy as fat; Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ) for 15 weeks. They were fasted for 1 h (12:00–13:00) and sacrificed to harvest the epididymal adipose tissue before (n = 10) and 2 weeks (n = 10), 4 weeks (n = 12), 6 weeks (n = 11), 8 weeks (n = 6), and 15 weeks (n = 4) after the experiments. All animal experiments were conducted according to the guidelines of Tokyo Medical and Dental University Committee on Animal Research (No. 0060026).Histological Analysis—The epididymal WAT was fixed with neutral-buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and studied under ×200 magnification to measure the adipocyte area using Win Roof software (Mitani Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) (19Kouyama R. Suganami T. Nishida J. Tanaka M. Toyoda T. Kiso M. Chiwata T. Miyamoto Y. Yoshimasa Y. Fukamizu A. Horiuchi M. Hirata Y. Ogawa Y.

Immunohistochemical study was carried out using 5-μm thick paraffin-embedded sections for macrophage marker F4/80 as previously described (20Suganami T. Mieda T. Itoh M. Shimoda Y. Kamei Y. Ogawa Y.

Differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to adipocytes was described elsewhere (6Suganami T. Nishida J. Ogawa Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2007; 27: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Cells at day 8 and day 21 after the induction of differentiation were used as non-hypertrophied and hypertrophied adipocytes, respectively (6Suganami T. Nishida J. Ogawa Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 2062-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Accumulation of triglyceride in adipocytes was detected by oil red O staining (19Kouyama R. Suganami T. Nishida J. Tanaka M. Toyoda T. Kiso M. Chiwata T. Miyamoto Y. Yoshimasa Y. Fukamizu A. Horiuchi M. Hirata Y. Ogawa Y. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 3481-3489Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).Measurement of Triglyceride Content—Triglyceride content in 3T3-L1 adipocytes was measured as previously reported (22Kamon J. Naitoh T. Kitahara M. Tsuruzoe N. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In brief, 3T3-L1 adipocytes in 35-mm dish were harvested, and cellular lipid was extracted by chloroform-methanol (2:1). After evaporation, precipitation was dissolved in isopropyl alcohol. Triglyceride content was measured using a colorimetric assay kit (triglyceride E-test Wako, Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Quantitative Real-time PCR—Quantitative real-time PCR was performed with an ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System using PCR Master Mix reagent kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as described (6Suganami T. Nishida J. Ogawa Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 2062-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, 19Kouyama R. Suganami T. Nishida J. Tanaka M. Toyoda T. Kiso M. Chiwata T.

Primers used were described in supplemental Table S1. Levels of mRNAs were normalized to those of housekeeping gene 36B4 mRNA.ELISA—The MCP-1, IL-6, and adiponectin levels in culture supernatants were determined by the commercially available ELISA kits (MCP-1 and IL-6, R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN; adiponectin, Otsuka Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan).Immunoblot Assay—Nuclear and cytosolic extracts were prepared by using the Nuclear/Cytosol fractionation kit (Bio-Vision, Mountain View, CA). Separation of nuclear and cytosolic proteins was confirmed by immunoblots with α-tubulin and lamin A/C antibodies, respectively. Whole cell lysates were prepared using buffer containing 50 mmol/liter HEPES (pH7.5), 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 100 mmol/liter sodium fluoride, 1 mmol/liter EGTA, 1 mmol/liter EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mmol/liter sodium vanadate, 2 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Immunoblot assay was performed as described (6Suganami T. Nishida J. Ogawa Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 2062-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Samples (10–20 μg protein/lane) were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride filter membrane (PolyScreen; PerkinElmer, Wellesley, MA). After membranes were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, immunoblots were developed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Piscataway, NJ) and a chemiluminescence kit (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences). The signals were detected with LAS3000 (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan).Generation of 3T3-L1 Adipocytes Stably Expressing Coxsackie-Adenovirus Receptor (CAR)—A mouse CAR-expressing plasmid pcDNA3-CAR (23Hosono T.

The CAR retroviral expression vector (pMRX-CAR) was constructed by ligating the full-length CAR cDNA into the EcoR1 site of pMRX vector (24Saitoh T. Nakayama M. Nakano H. Yagita H. Yamamoto N. Yamaoka S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36005-36012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) and transfected into Plat-E packaging cells (25Morita S. Kojima T. Kitamura T. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar) using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Viral supernatants were harvested from 24 to 48 h after transfection and applied to 3T3-L1 adipocytes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 5 μg/ml of polybrene (Nacalai Tesque) in a final volume of 5 ml. The stable CAR-expressing 3T3-L1 adipocytes (CAR-3T3-L1 adipocytes) were obtained by 2 μg/ml of puromycin (Nacalai Tesque) selection.Adenovirus-mediated Expression of MKP-1—The adenoviral vector expressing mouse MKP-1 (Ad-MKP-1) (26Bueno O.F. De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Tymitz K.M. Witt S.A. Kimball T.R. Molkentin J.D. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 88-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. Jeffery D. Molkentin (University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH), was prepared using HEK293 cells and purified by VIRAPREP adenovirus purification kit (Virapur, LLC, San Diego, CA) as previously described (27Suganami E. Takagi H. Ohashi H. Suzuma K. Suzuma I. Oh H. Watanabe D. Ojima T. Suganami T. Fujio Y. Nakao K. Ogawa Y. Yoshimura N. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 2443-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The GFP adenovirus (Ad-GFP; Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) was used as a control. The CAR-3T3-L1 adipocytes at day 5 and day 18 after the induction of differentiation were transfected with Ad-MKP-1, incubated for 3 days, and harvested to be used for quantitative real-time PCR and immunoblot assay.Statistical Analysis—Data are shown as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t test and analysis of variance followed by Scheffe's test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTSMCP-1 mRNA Expression in the Adipose Tissue from Mice with Diet-induced Obesity—Body weight was increased significantly in mice fed high fat diet for 2 weeks relative to those fed standard diet (p < 0.01) (Fig. 1A). The mice fed high fat diet weighed ∼20% more than those fed standard diet for 15 weeks (29.7 ± 0.3 g versus 34.8 ± 1.9 g, p < 0.05). The weight of epididymal white adipose tissue (WAT) was significantly increased in mice fed high-fat diet for 2 weeks relative to those fed standard diet (0.26 ± 0.01 g versus 0.49 ± 0.04 g, p < 0.01). Histological examination revealed appreciable increase in adipocyte cell size in mice fed a high fat diet during the initial 2 weeks, which reached up to ∼4-fold larger than that in mice fed standard diet after 15 weeks (Fig. 1B). There were no appreciable infiltration of macrophages in the adipose tissue up to 8 weeks after the experiment, after which interstitial cells stained with F4/80, a marker of activated macrophages, appeared in mice fed high fat diet (Fig. 1C). Correspondingly, F4/80 mRNA expression was also increased in the epididymal WAT in mice fed high fat diet for 15 weeks relative to those fed standard diet (Fig. 1D, left). In mice fed high fat diet, MCP-1 mRNA expression was increased as early as 4 weeks and gradually increased up to 15 weeks after the experiment (Fig. 1D, right). These observations indicate that MCP-1 mRNA expression is increased prior to macrophage infiltration at the early stage of obesity.Dysregulation of Adipocytokine Production during the Course of Adipocyte Hypertrophy—To explore the molecular mechanisms underlying adipocyte hypertrophy, we cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes up to 21 days after the induction of differentiation; they exhibited a gradual increase in lipid accumulation from day 8 to day 21 during the course of adipocyte hypertrophy as revealed by oil-red O staining (Fig. 2A) and triglyceride content (Fig. 2B). In this study, insulin-induced glucose uptake was preserved up to day 21 (supplemental Fig. S1).FIGURE 2Changes in adipocytokine expression during the course of adipocyte hypertrophy in vitro.

Expression of IL-6 mRNA was also increased during the course of adipocyte hypertrophy. The IL-6 mRNA levels in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (day 21) were ∼5-fold higher than those in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (day 8) (p < 0.01). By contrast, adiponectin mRNA expression showed significant reduction (up to 30%) during the course of adipocyte hypertrophy (p < 0.01). The MCP-1, IL-6, and adiponectin concentrations in the culture media were roughly parallel to their respective mRNA levels (Fig. 2D). The expression patterns of adipocytokines in hypertrophied 3T3-L1 adipocytes (day 21) were similar to those found in obese adipose tissue. We also confirmed that mRNA expression patterns of adipogenesis-related markers such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ2 (PPARγ2), adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (aP2), fatty-acid transport protein 1 (FATP1), and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα) in hypertrophied 3T3-L1 adipocytes were consistent with those in obese adipose tissue (supplemental Fig. S2). In this study, we used 3T3-L1 adipocytes cultured for 8 and 21 days after differentiation as non-hypertrophied (day 8) and hypertrophied (day 21) adipocytes, respectively.Activation of MAPK Pathways during the Course of Adipocyte Hypertrophy—To explore the role of MAPK activation in the dysregulation of MCP-1 production during the course of adipocyte hypertrophy, we examined phosphorylation of ERK, p38 MAPK, and JNK in 3T3-L1 adipocytes during the course of adipocyte hypertrophy. Immunoblot analysis revealed that phosphorylation of ERK and p38 MAPK is increased in hypertrophied adipocytes relative to non-hypertrophied adipocytes (Fig. 3A). In this study, there was no significant induction of phosphorylation of JNK during the course of adipocyte hypertrophy (Fig. 3A). Treatment of hypertrophied adipocytes with MEK inhibitors, PD98059 and U0126, for 24 h significantly reduced MCP-1 mRNA levels (Fig. 3B left, p < 0.01) and secretion in the culture media (Fig. 3B right, p < 0.01). Moreover, the effect of the MEK inhibitors on MCP-1 mRNA expression was observed as early as 6 h after the treatment (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, phosphorylation of ERK was increased in the nuclear fraction rather than in the cytosolic fraction from hypertrophied adipocytes (Fig. 3D, p < 0.01). We also confirmed that phosphorylation of MEK is increased in hypertrophied adipocytes (Fig. 3E, p < 0.01). On the other hand, no such inhibitory effect was observed when treated with a p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580 (Fig. 3, B and C). These observations suggest that increased mRNA expression and secretion of MCP-1 in hypertrophied adipocytes are due at least in part to MEK-ERK activation.FIGURE 3Role of MAP kinases in MCP-1 mRNA expression in hypertrophied adipocytes.

Interestingly, we detected substantial amounts of MKP-1 mRNA and protein in non-hypertrophied adipocytes, which are markedly down-regulated in hypertrophied adipocytes (Fig. 4, A and B, p < 0.05). There were no obvious changes in MKP-2 and MKP-3 mRNA levels during the course of adipocyte hypertrophy (Fig. 4A). We also observed that MKP-1 mRNA expression is significantly down-regulated in the adipose tissue from mice fed high fat diet for 2- and 4-weeks relative to those fed standard diet (Fig. 4C, p < 0.05). In addition, phosphorylation of ERK was significantly increased in the adipose tissue from mice that received 4-, 6-, 8-, and 15-week high fat diet relative to those fed standard diet (Fig. 4D, p < 0.05). These observations, taken together, suggest that MKP-1 is down-regulated in hypertrophied adipocytes, which is accompanied by ERK activation in vivo.FIGURE 4Changes in MKP-1 expression during the course of adipocyte hypertrophy in vitro and in vivo.

Because hypertrophied 3T3-L1 adipocytes are difficult to transfect with plasmid- or even virally encoded genes, we generated CAR-3T3-L1 adipocytes as described under “Experimental Procedures.” There was no obvious difference in lipid accumulation between CAR-3T3-L1 and 3T3-L1 adipo"
https://openalex.org/W2055501861,"S-Thiolation is crucial for protection and regulation of thiol-containing proteins during oxidative stress and is frequently achieved by the formation of mixed disulfides with glutathione. However, many Gram-positive bacteria including Bacillus subtilis lack the low molecular weight (LMW) thiol glutathione. Here we provide evidence that S-thiolation by the LMW thiol cysteine represents a general mechanism in B. subtilis. In vivo labeling of proteins with [35S]cysteine and nonreducing two-dimensional PAGE analyses revealed that a large subset of proteins previously identified as having redox-sensitive thiols are modified by cysteine in response to treatment with the thiol-specific oxidant diamide. By means of multidimensional shotgun proteomics, the sites of S-cysteinylation for six proteins could be identified, three of which are known to be S-glutathionylated in other organisms."

https://openalex.org/W2084332644,"Multiple sclerosis (MS), an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, manifests itself in numerous forms and stages. A number of brain metabolic alterations have been reported for MS patients vs. control subjects. However, metabolite profiles of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are not consistent among the published MS studies, most probably due to variations in the patient cohorts studied. We undertook the first investigation of highly homogeneous MS patient cohorts to determine characteristic effects of inflammatory MS plaques on the CSF metabolome, including only patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) with or without inflammatory brain plaques, and controls.CSF obtained by lumbar puncture was analyzed by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. 27 metabolites were quantified. Differences between groups of control subjects (n = 10), CIS patients with (n = 21) and without (n = 12) inflammatory plaques were evaluated by univariate statistics and principal component analysis (PCA). Seven metabolites showed statistically significant inter-group differences (p<0.05). Interestingly, a significant increase in beta-hydroxyisobutyrate (BHIB) was detected in CIS with vs. without active plaques, but not when comparing either CIS group with control subjects. Moreover, a significant correlation was found, for the first time, between CSF lactate concentration and the number of inflammatory MS brain plaques. In contrast, fructose concentrations were equally enhanced in CIS with or without active plaques. PCA based on all 27 metabolites yielded group-specific clusters.CSF metabolic profiles suggest a close link between MS plaque activity in CIS patients on the one hand and organic-acid metabolism on the other. Our detection of increased BHIB levels points to a hitherto unsuspected role for this compound in MS with active plaques, and serves as a basis for further investigation. The metabolic effects described in our study are crucial elements in the explanation of biochemical mechanisms involved in specific MS manifestations."
https://openalex.org/W2033846769,"An emerging theme in cell signaling is that membrane-bound channels and receptors are organized into supramolecular signaling complexes for optimum function and cross-talk. In this study, we determined how protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation influences the scaffolding protein Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor 1 (NHERF) to assemble protein complexes of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a chloride ion channel that controls fluid and electrolyte transport across cell membranes. NHERF directs polarized expression of receptors and ion transport proteins in epithelial cells, as well as organizes the homo- and hetero-association of these cell surface proteins. NHERF contains two modular PDZ domains that are modular protein-protein interaction motifs, and a C-terminal domain. Previous studies have shown that NHERF is a phosphoprotein, but how phosphorylation affects NHERF to assemble macromolecular complexes is unknown. We show that PKC phosphorylates two amino acid residues Ser-339 and Ser-340 in the C-terminal domain of NHERF, but a serine 162 of PDZ2 is specifically protected from being phosphorylated by the intact C-terminal domain. PKC phosphorylation-mimicking mutant S339D/S340D of NHERF has increased affinity and stoichiometry when binding to C-CFTR. Moreover, solution small angle x-ray scattering indicates that the PDZ2 and C-terminal domains contact each other in NHERF, but such intramolecular domain-domain interactions are released in the PKC phosphorylation-mimicking mutant indicating that PKC phosphorylation disrupts the autoinhibition interactions in NHERF. The results demonstrate that the C-terminal domain of NHERF functions as an intramolecular switch that regulates the binding capability of PDZ2, and thus controls the stoichiometry of NHERF to assemble protein complexes.

In particular, the cytoplasmic domain of CFTR binds to the scaffolding protein Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor-1 (NHERF) (20Wang S. Raab R.W. Schatz P.J. Guggino W.B. Li M.

As a member of a family of proteins that contains two or multiple copies of PDZ domains (36Donowitz M. Cha B. Zachos N.C. Brett C.L. Sharma A. Tse C.M. Li X. J. Physiol.

Smith A.E. Sci. Am. 1995; 273: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). NHERF assembles the homotypic CFTR-CFTR association, which is thought to increase the channel activities of CFTR (40Raghuram V. Mak D.D. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

NHERF also organizes the heterotypic interactions of CFTR with other channels, receptors, and with intracellular signaling proteins (42Yoo D. Flagg T.P. Olsen O. Raghuram V. Foskett J.K. Welling P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6863-6873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 43Guerra L. Favia M. Fanelli T. Calamita G. Svelto M. Bagorda A. Jacobson K.A. Reshkin S.J.

For instance, NHERF forms multiprotein complexes that include CFTR, ezrin, and PKA, which implies that NHERF and ezrin bring PKA and CFTR into a macromolecular complex for PKA-mediated phosphorylation of CFTR (45Sun F. Hug M.J. Bradbury N.A. Frizzell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14360-14366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In addition, NHERF recruits a multiprotein complex that includes CFTR as well as a β2-adrenergic receptor. This hetero-protein complex transmits signals from the agonists of the β2-adrenergic receptor to stimulate CFTR activities (46Naren A.P. Cobb B. Li C. Roy K. Nelson D. Heda G.D. Liao J. Kirk K.L. Sorscher E.J. Hanrahan J. Clancy J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 342-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Furthermore, NHERF mediates the macromolecular interactions of CFTR with an inwardly rectifying potassium channel, and such interactions may be responsible for coordinated ion transport activities of these channels (42Yoo D. Flagg T.P. Olsen O. Raghuram V. Foskett J.K. Welling P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6863-6873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). NHERF is a phosphoprotein; it was originally isolated from cells in a phosphorylated state (32Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Later studies have identified a number of kinases that phosphorylate NHERF. Hall et al. domain (47Hall R.A. Spurney R.F.

Chem. 1999; 274: 24328-24334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) finds that a G protein-coupled receptor kinase phosphorylates NHERF at Ser-289 in the C terminus. NHERF is phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner by cdc2 kinase at Ser-279 and Ser-301 (48He J. Lau A.G. Yaffe M.B. Hall R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41559-41565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). NHERF is also phosphorylated by PKC in response to extracellular signals such as by the stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors (49Deliot N. Hernando N. Horst-Liu Z. Gisler S.M. Capuano P. Wagner C.A. Bacic D. O'Brien S. Biber J. Murer H. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: C159-C167Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, attempts to identify the PKC phosphorylation sites in NHERF-1 have generated controversial results (50Raghuram V. Hormuth H. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9620-9625Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 51Fouassier L. Nichols M.T. Gidey E. McWilliams R.R. Robin H. Finnigan C. Howell K.E. Housset C. Doctor R.B. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 306: 264-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). More importantly, the effects of phosphorylation on the ability of NHERF to assemble protein complexes, although essential, remain unknown. Phosphorylation is thought to induce oligomerization of NHERF that changes the ability of NHERF to assemble signaling complexes (51Fouassier L. Nichols M.T. Gidey E. McWilliams R.R. Robin H. Finnigan C. Howell K.E. Housset C. Doctor R.B. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 306: 264-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 52Lau A.G. Hall R.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8572-8580Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified the effects of PKC phosphorylation on NHERF in assembling CFTR complexes, using biochemical and biophysical methods. Our results demonstrate that there are intramolecular domain-domain interactions between PDZ2 and the C-terminal domain of NHERF. PKC phosphorylation abolishes the autoinhibitory-like interactions and increases the binding affinity of PDZ2 for its peptide ligand. PKC phosphorylation thus regulates the affinity and stoichiometry of NHERF to assemble macromolecular complexes. Protein Expression, Site-directed Mutagenesis, and Protein Purification—The human NHERF cDNA encoding PDZ1 (residues 11–99), PDZ2-(150–240), the C-terminal domain termed CT-(242–358), PDZ2 plus the C-terminal domain termed PDZ2-CT-(150–358), and the full-length NHERF-(11–358) were subcloned into the pET151/D-TOPO vectors (Invitrogen), respectively. The pET151/D-TOPO vector encodes a V5 epitope plus hexahistidine fusion tag at the N terminus of an expressed protein. Using the pET151/D-TOPO vector, we have also expressed and purified the last 70-residue peptide of human CFTR, termed C-CFTR-(1411–1480), which includes the PDZ-binding motif DTRL at the very C terminus. Fig. 1 summarizes the different constructs of NHERF used in this study. Site-directed mutants in the full-length NHERF and the differently truncated NHERF domains were generated with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All of the expression vectors were subjected to sequence analysis at the DNA Sequencing Facility at Fox Chase Cancer Center. Cell growth and protein purification have been described previously (34Li J. Dai Z. Jana D. Callaway D.J. Bu Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37634-37643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). PKC Phosphorylation Assays and Isoelectric Focusing Two-dimensional Electrophoresis—PKC phosphorylation assays were performed by adding 25 milliunits of PKC (1 μl) to a 20-μl solution containing 1.0 μg of purified protein in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 1.7 mm CaCl2, 0.020 mm ATP, and 14 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The catalytic domain of PKC from rat brain was purchased from EMD Biosciences, Inc. The solution was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The phosphorylation reaction was terminated by adding 20 μl of protein sample buffer. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 10% Nu/PAGE gels (Invitrogen). The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, destained, dried, and exposed to chemiluminescence film (Eastman Kodak Co.) to detect γ-32P incorporation. The chemiluminescence image was quantified by densitometry, using an Epson Perfection V750 PRO digital scanner and a software UN-SCAN-IT Gel from the Silk Scientific. Isoelectric focusing (IEF) two-dimensional electrophoresis was also used to identify PKC-induced phosphorylation in the full-length NHERF. Before electrophoresis, the PKC phosphorylation reaction was performed by adding 25 milliunits of PKC to a 20-μl solution containing 1.0 μg of purified protein, 0.020 mm ATP, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, and 1.7 mm CaCl2. The phosphorylation reaction was terminated by adding SDS sample buffer. The phosphorylated protein was resolved by IEF electrophoresis, using unphosphorylated NHERF as control. The isoelectric points (pI) of unphosphorylated and phosphorylated NHERF were estimated based on the amino acid sequence of the protein and the number of phosphorylated Ser/Thr sites. The pI of unphosphorylated NHERF was calculated using an isoelectric point calculator, assuming pKa = 4.3 for Glu, pKa = 3.7 for Asp, pKa = 10.5 for Lys, and pKa = 12.5 for Asn. The pI values of NHERF with different number of Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites were calculated, assuming pKa1 = 2.12 for the first ionization and the pKa2 = 7.21 for the second ionization of a phosphorylation group. Cell Culture and Delivering Proteins in Mammalian Cells—The BioTrek protein delivery reagent (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to deliver wild-type NHERF, NHERF(S339D), NHERF(S340D), and NHERF(S339D/S340D) in Calu-3 cells. Purified proteins or protein complexes were diluted to 150 μg/ml using phosphate-buffered saline. About 100 μl of the diluted protein solution was transferred to a tube containing the lyophilized BioTrek reagent. The mixture was resuspended and incubated at room temperature for about 5 min. Serum-free medium was then added to the tube to a final volume of 500 μl. The Calu-3 cell line was purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Calu-3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cells were grown in a 6-well plate with 30-mm-diameter wells. When the cell density reached 50–60% confluence, the culture medium was removed by aspiration. The cells were washed once with serum-free medium. After 500 μl of fresh serum-free medium was added to each well, 500 μl of the BioTrek/protein mixture was added dropwise to the cells. The cell culture plate was then incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator for 4–5 h before the immunoprecipitation experiments. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting Experiments—The Calu-3 cell monolayer in a 30-mm-diameter well was washed with phosphate-buffered saline followed by lysis in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer at 4 °C. A mouse anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) was used to pull down the protein complex. About 1.0 μg of anti-V5 was added to 500 μl of cell lysate and shaken in a cold room for 4 h. About 20 μl of agarose beads (G PLUS; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added to the lysate, and the mixture was shaken in a cold room overnight. The beads were then spun and washed three times with 750 μl of RIPA buffer and then resuspended in 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. A mouse anti-hemagglutinin antibody (Invitrogen) was used as a mock primary antibody during immunoprecipitation experiments for negative control to verify the specificity of the antibody used to pull down the protein complex. After electrophoresis, proteins in the SDS-polyacrylamide gel were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by semi-dry blotting. The membranes were then blocked in 5% fat-free milk in TBS-T (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) for 3 h at room temperature. Primary rabbit anti-CFTR antibody (Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel) was used to detect CFTR, and primary mouse anti-V5 antibody was used to detect NHERF. The primary antibody was added to the blots and incubated overnight in blocking solution. The following day the blots were washed three times with TBS-T buffer and then incubated with the secondary antibody (anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase for mouse anti-V5 antibody or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase for rabbit anti-CFTR primary antibody) for 1 h at room temperature and washed three times with changes of TBS-T buffer. The blots were then developed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Pierce) for analysis. The chemiluminescence image was quantified by densitometry, using an Epson Perfection V750 PRO digital scanner and the software UN-SCAN-IT gel. Light Scattering Experiments—Light scattering experiments were performed using a DynaPro Molecular Sizing Instrument (Wyatt Technology Corp., Santa Barbara, CA) with a laser of wavelength 824.7 nm at a fixed 90° scattering angle. The DynaPro was used to perform both dynamic light scattering (DLS) and static light scattering (SLS). DLS measures the hydrodynamic radius of the proteins. SLS determines the absolute molecular mass of a protein, which is independent of the size and shape of a protein. Before light scattering experiments, the sample was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5–10 min to remove dust. Protein concentrations were varied from 0.5 to 3 mg/ml during light scattering measurements. The scattering intensity of the buffer background was subtracted from that of the sample solution. Light scattering experiments were performed at 10 °C. The data were analyzed with the software Dynamics version 6. Surface Plasmon Resonance Binding Experiments and Data Analysis—Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments were performed on a Biacore 1000 instrument (Biacore Life Sciences, NJ) at 25.0 °C. Before the binding experiments, the hydrogel matrix of the BIAcore CM5 Biosensor chips was activated by N-hydroxysuccinimide and N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (Biacore Life Sciences, NJ). The ligand, which is 3 μl of 5 μg/ml C-CFTR dissolved in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2, was injected to coat the activated surface. Uncross-linked ligand was washed away, and uncoated sites were blocked by 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5. The analytes (NHERF or NHERF mutants) were prepared in HBS-EP buffer containing 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% surfactant polysorbate 20. The analyte was injected over the C-CFTR-coated surfaces at a series of concentrations at 50 μl/min for 3 min. At the end of each injection, the sensor chip was regenerated with 4.0 m MgCl2, 50 mm triethylamine, pH 9.15, and HBS-EP buffer. The SPR response curves were obtained by subtracting the background signal generated by injecting the analyte over a control cell without ligand coating to remove the bulk refractive index effects. The nonspecific binding was corrected by subtracting the signal generated by HBS-EP buffer alone. The response curve reached an equilibrium plateau in all cases (shown in Fig. 5A), and the average of the plateau region was taken and plotted as a function of analyte concentrations to obtain the binding curve (shown in Fig. 5B). For monovalent analyte binding, the dissociation constant (Kd) was obtained by fitting the binding curve to a monovalent binding model as shown in Equation 1, RU=CA×maxCA+Kd(Eq. 1) where RU is the response unit when the analyte flows over the ligand-coated sensor chip; CA is the concentration of the analyte, and max is the maximum response unit. The Kd and max values were obtained by nonlinear curve fitting to Equation 1 using the commercial software Origin 6.1 (OriginLab Corp., Northhampton, MA). For bivalent analytes, the three flow cells of a sensor chip were coated with C-CFTR at three different densities by injecting the C-CFTR solution twice to each flow cell at 3 μl of 3 μg/ml, 1 μl of 10 μg/ml, and 3 μl of 20 μg/ml. This operation gave three values of response units of 50, 80, and 400 in the three flow cells, respectively, corresponding to three different coating densities. The analyte was then injected at various concentrations to flow over the C-CFTR-coated chip. After background subtraction, the response unit of the plateau region of each response curve was taken and plotted against the analyte concentrations. The bivalent binding model can be expressed as shown in Equation (see Supplemental Material for the derivation of Equation 2), RU=Am1LKd1+m2L2Kd1Kd2(Eq. 2) where Kd1 and Kd2 are the dissociation constants of the two"

Their function in pathological conditions is unknown. We studied the role of ITAM signaling during rapid bone remodeling induced by acute estrogen-deficiency in wild-type (WT), DAP12-deficient (DAP12-/-), FcRgamma-deficient (FcRgamma-/-) and double-deficient (DAP12-/-FcRgamma-/-) mice. Six weeks after ovariectomy (OVX), DAP12-/-FcRgamma-/- mice showed resistance to lumbar vertebral body (LVB) trabecular bone loss, while WT, DAP12-/- and FcRgamma-/- mice had significant LVB bone loss. In contrast, all ITAM adapter-deficient mice responded to OVX with bone loss in both femur and tibia of approximately 40%, relative to basal bone volumes. Only WT mice developed significant cortical bone loss after OVX. In vitro studies showed microenvironmental changes induced by OVX are indispensable for enhanced osteoclast formation and function. Cytokine changes, including TGFbeta and TNFalpha, were able to induce osteoclastogenesis independent of RANKL in BMMs from WT but not DAP12-/- and DAP12-/-FcRgamma-/- mice. FSH stimulated RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation from BMMs in WT, but not DAP12-/- and DAP12-/-FcRgamma-/- mice. Our study demonstrates that although ITAM adapter signaling is critical for normal bone remodeling, estrogen-deficiency induces an ITAM adapter-independent bypass mechanism allowing for enhanced osteoclastogenesis and activation in specific bony microenvironments."
https://openalex.org/W2040240749,"Regulated secretion is a fundamental process underlying the function of many cell types. In particular, acrosomal exocytosis in mammalian sperm is essential for egg fertilization. Regulated secretion requires SNARE proteins and, in neurons, also synaptotagmin I and complexin. Recent reports suggest that complexin imposes a fusion block that is released by Ca2+ and synaptotagmin I. However, no direct evidence for this model in secreting cells has been provided and whether this complexin/synaptotagmin interplay functions in other types of secretion is unknown. In this report, we show that the C2B domain of synaptotagmin VI and an anti-complexin antibody blocked the formation of trans SNARE complexes in permeabilized human sperm, and that this effect was reversed by adding complexin. In contrast, an excess of complexin stopped exocytosis at a later step, when SNAREs were assembled in loose trans complexes. Interestingly, this blockage was released by the addition of the synaptotagmin VI C2B domain in the presence of Ca2+. We have previously demonstrated that the activity of this domain is regulated by protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation. Here, we show that a phosphomimetic mutation in the polybasic region of the C2B domain strongly affects its Ca2+ and phospholipids binding properties. Importantly, this mutation completely abrogates its ability to rescue the complexin block.

SNAREs are small membrane proteins that form stable hetero-oligomeric complexes consisting of a bundle of four parallel helices. Assembly of trans SNARE complexes between SNAREs from two opposing membranes is a key event for membrane fusion. SNAREs residing on the same membrane can form cis complexes that must be disassembled to render free SNAREs competent for membrane fusion. The exocytotic SNAREs involved in neurotransmission are syntaxin1A and SNAP25 in the plasmalemma, and synaptobrevin 2 (also called VAMP2) in secretory vesicles. These proteins are the targets of botulinum and tetanus toxins, a set of highly specific zinc-dependent endoproteases (2Schiavo G. Matteoli M. Montecucco C. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 717-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar).

Additional proteins that are key for Ca2+-triggered neurotransmitter release include complexins and synaptotagmins (3Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 509-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1870) Google Scholar). Complexins are small cytosolic proteins that bind with high affinity to SNARE complexes (4McMahon H.T. Missler M. Li C. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 111-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), forming an antiparallel α helix that inserts into a groove between the synaptobrevin and syntaxin helices (5Chen X.

Experiments where complexins were deleted or overexpressed have suggested that they play both activating and inhibitory roles, possibly to achieve synchronization of the fast component of neurotransmitter release (5Chen X.

Synaptotagmins can interact with several combinations of SNARE proteins including ternary complexes (3Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 509-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1870) Google Scholar). These proteins are Ca2+ sensors coupling cell stimulation to exocytosis (3Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 509-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1870) Google Scholar). Synaptotagmins are transmembrane proteins with a cytoplasmic region that contains two conserved C2 domains capable of binding Ca2+ and negatively charged phospholipids (10Fernandez I. Arac D.

Shin O.H. Konigstorfer A. Matos M.F. Meyer A.C. Garcia J. Gerber S.H. Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. Rosenmund C. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8438-8446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Robinson I.M. Ranjan R.

Nature. 2002; 418: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). A recent report using purified proteins has showed that the cytoplasmic domain of synaptotagmin I can displace complexin from SNARE complexes in a Ca2+-dependent manner in the presence of membranes (9Tang J. Maximov A. Shin O.H. Dai H. Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 2006; 126: 1175-1187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). An interplay between complexin and synaptotagmin I in neurotransmitter release has been also inferred from the observation that their deletions produce a selective inhibition of the fast synchronous component of release (6Reim K. Mansour M. Varoqueaux F. McMahon H.T. Sudhof T.C. Brose N. Rosenmund C. Cell. 2001; 104: 71-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 18Geppert M. Goda Y. Hammer R.E. Li C. Rosahl T.W. Stevens C.F. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 717-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). A similar effect was observed inducing a local excess of complexin by overexpressing a synaptobrevin/complexin fusion protein in cultured cortical neurons (9Tang J. Maximov A. Shin O.H. Dai H. Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 2006; 126: 1175-1187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Moreover, complexin was found to block SNARE-induced liposome fusion and intercellular fusion caused by flipped SNAREs, and synaptotagmin I released this block in a Ca2+-dependent manner (19Schaub J.R. Lu X. Doneske B. Shin Y.K. McNew J.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 748-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 20Giraudo C.G. Eng W.S. Melia T.J. Rothman J.E. Science. 2006; 313: 676-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). However, no direct evidence has been provided that synaptotagmin can rescue the blockage in exocytosis imposed by an excess of complexin in cells. Therefore, we decided to test the interplay of synaptotagmin with complexin in the acrosomal exocytosis, a particularly well suited model to study molecular interactions during secretion (21Tomes C. Regazzi R. Molecular Mechanisms of Exocytosis, Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, TX. 2006; : 117-147Google Scholar). Mammalian spermatozoa are highly differentiated cells specialized in performing a limited number of functions with high efficiency (22Yanagimachi R. Knobil E. Neill J.D. The Physiology of Reproduction, Raven Press, New York. 1994: 189-317Google Scholar). Sperm can move very fast by means of a flagellum, exocytose the content of their acrosomal granule, and fertilize eggs. Therefore, from the point of view of intracellular trafficking, sperm are specialized in a single membrane fusion event: the exocytosis of the acrosomal granule (AE). Secretion is initiated when a sustained intracellular Ca2+ increase is induced by activation of sperm receptors that recognize specific glycoproteins in the zona pellucida of the egg (23Darszon A. Acevedo J.J. Galindo B.E. Hernandez-Gonzalez E.O. Nishigaki T. Trevino C.L. Wood C. Beltran C. Reproduction. 2006; 131: 977-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). AE depends on Rab3A (24Michaut M. Tomes C.N. De Blas G. Yunes R. Mayorga L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9996-10001Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and neurotoxin-sensitive members of the SNARE family (25Tomes C.N. Michaut M. De Blas G. Visconti P. Matti U. Mayorga L.S. Dev. Biol. 2002; 243: 326-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). According to our present working model, AE proceeds through a sequential set of events initiated when Ca2+ triggers the activation of Rab3A, which in turn leads the NSF/α-SNAP-mediated disassembly of cis SNARE complexes (26De Blas G.A. Roggero C.M. Tomes C.N. Mayorga L.S. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e323Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). SNAREs then re-associate in loose trans complexes until an efflux of intra-acrosomal Ca2+ promotes synaptotagmin VI- and SNARE-dependent membrane fusion (26De Blas G.A. Roggero C.M. Tomes C.N. Mayorga L.S. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e323Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that in permeabilized human sperm, an experimental model with naturally occurring membranes containing all factors involved in physiological secretion, the functional interplay between complexin and synaptotagmin has a central role in exocytosis. This interplay can be modulated by phosphorylation or by a phosphomimetic mutation in the polybasic region of the synaptotagmin C2B domain.

Sperm were resuspended (7 × 106/ml) in ice-cold sucrose buffer (250 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm EGTA, 20 mm Hepes-K, pH 7) containing 2 mm dithiothreitol and divided in 30–50-μl aliquots. Each aliquot was treated as described in the figure legends. The different reagents were added successively without washing. Care was taken to maintain the same incubation times for all tubes in the same experiment. All incubations were carried out at 37 °C. Negative (no stimulation) and positive (10 μm free Ca2+) controls were included in all experiments. At the end of the assay, 10 μl of each sample was spotted on slides and fixed/permeabilized in ice-cold methanol. Acrosomal status was evaluated by staining with FITC-coupled Pisum sativum agglutinin (PSA-FITC). Briefly, spermatozoa that have preserved an intact acrosome show strong label with the fluorescent lectin at the acrosomal region. Cells that have undergone acrosomal exocytosis show no labeling at the acrosomal region or labeling limited to the posterior edge of the granule (ecuatorial staining). At least 200 cells were scored for each condition. For each experiment, acrosomal exocytosis indexes were calculated by subtracting the number of reacted spermatozoa in the negative control (range of 12–28%) from all values, and expressing the resulting values as a percentage of the acrosome reaction observed in the positive control (range of 30–48%). The average difference between positive and negative controls was 14% (experiments where the difference was less than 10% were discarded). Phospholipid Binding—FRET experiments were performed on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50-B spectrofluorimeter exciting at 280 nm and recording the emission spectra from 400 to 600 nm. The experiments were performed at room temperature in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, with 0.01 mg/ml phospholipid vesicles containing 10% dansyl-phosphatidylethanolamine, 25% phosphatidylserine, and 65% phosphatidylcholine, and 1 μm protein, and the corresponding additions of 1 mm EDTA or 1 mm CaCl2. A fluorescence spectra acquired under identical conditions but in the absence of protein was subtracted from the corresponding spectra acquired in the presence of protein (10Fernandez I. Arac D.

NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR experiments were carried out at 27 °C on Varian INOVA500 or INOVA600 spectrometers with samples containing ∼100 μm C2B domains dissolved in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, and 150 mm NaCl. Ca2+ binding was monitored by 1H-15N heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra in the presence of 1 mm EDTA or 1 mm CaCl2. All NMR data were processed with NMRPipe (29Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11548) Google Scholar) and analyzed with NMRView (30Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2677) Google Scholar). Indirect Immunofluorescence—Twenty μg/ml (134 nm) of an anti-complexin I/II antibody was added to the suspension of streptolysin O-permeabilized sperm and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C before spotting on round coverslips. After fixation in 2% paraformaldehyde, sperm were washed once in PBS containing 0.4% polyvinylpyrrolidone (40,000 average Mr, PBS/PVP). The cells were then incubated with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. After washing twice with PBS/PVP, sperm were incubated in 50 mm glycine-PBS overnight at 4 °C. Nonspecific staining was blocked with 5% bovine fetal serum in PBS/PVP for 1 h at room temperature. An Alexa Fluor 488-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (1 h at 20 °C, 6.7 μg/ml in 0.5% bovine fetal serum, PBS/PVP) was used as secondary antibody. Coverslips were washed (3 times) with PBS/PVP between incubations. Finally, cells were incubated 1 min in cold methanol and stained with Hoechst 33258 (20 min at 20 °C, 1 μg/ml in PBS) followed by PSA-FITC (30 min at 20 °C, 50 μg/ml in PBS) and washed with distilled water 20 min at 4 °C. Coverslips were mounted in Gelvatol, and examined with an Eclipse TE3000 Nikon microscope equipped with a Plan Apo ×60/1.40 oil objective and a Hamamatsu Orca 100 camera operated with MetaMorph 6.1 software (Universal Imaging Corp.). Background was subtracted and brightness/contrast were adjusted to render an all or nothing labeling pattern using Corel Draw version 12 (Corel, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada). SDS-PAGE and Immunoblot Analysis—Sperm were washed in PBS and proteins extracted in cold 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and a protease inhibitor mixture (P2714, Sigma). After sonication for 15 s (3 times with 10-s intervals) and extraction for 30 min at 4 °C, the sperm extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 20 min and used immediately or stored at -20 °C. Proteins were separated on 12.5% polyacrylamide slab gels (31Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10474) Google Scholar) and transferred to 0.22-μm nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell GmbH, Dassel, Germany). Nonspecific reactivity was blocked by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with 5% nonfat dry milk dissolved in washing buffer (PBS, pH 7.6, 0.2% Tween 20). Blots were incubated with the anti-complexin antibody (0.2 μg/ml in blocking solution) for 60 min at room temperature. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit-IgG dissolved in blocking buffer was used as secondary antibody (0.25 μg/ml, 45 min at room temperature). Excess first and second antibodies were removed by washing 5 times for 5 min in blocking solution. Detection was accomplished with an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) and subsequent exposure to Kodak X-AR film (Eastman Kodak) for 5–30 s. Statistical Analysis—Data were evaluated using one-way analysis of variance. The Tukey-Kramer post hoc test was used for pairwise comparisons. Differences were considered significant at the p < 0.05 level. Complexin Regulates Acrosomal Exocytosis—We hypothesized that complexin may be part of the membrane fusion machinery involved in AE. Complexin was detected in human sperm extracts by Western blot (Fig. 1A). Although the antibody does not distinguish between isoforms I and II, the electrophoretic mobility of sperm complexin suggests that II is the predominant one. The protein localized to the acrosomal region (Fig. 1B), as it has been shown in sperm of other species (32Redecker P. Kreutz M.R. Bockmann J. Gundelfinger E.D. Boeckers T.M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2003; 51: 809-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 33Zhao L. Shi X. Li L. Miller D.J. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2007; 74: 750-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), consistent with a role in the exocytosis of this granule. When introduced into streptolysin O-permeabilized sperm, nanomolar concentrations of a specific anti-complexin I/II antibody prevented the AE stimulated by 10 μm Ca2+ in a dose-response fashion, suggesting that endogenous complexin is necessary for secretion (Fig. 1C). The effect of the antibody was specific, because it was abolished by preincubation with purified complexin (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, addition of low concentrations of recombinant complexin II, either as a fusion protein with GST or without the GST moiety, inhibited AE. Complexin I was as efficient as complexin II in blocking exocytosis (Fig. 1E). Pre-activated Rab3A can trigger AE in permeabilized sperm in the absence of Ca2+ (34De Blas G. Michaut M. Trevino C.L. Tomes C.N. Yunes R. Darszon A. Mayorga L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49326-49331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), an effect that was also inhibited by an anti-complexin antibody and by recombinant complexin II, suggesting a role for this protein downstream of the small GTPase activation (Fig. 1F). These results indicate that complexin is present in human sperm and that a precise amount of this protein is required for AE. The C2B Domain of Synaptotagmin VI Rescues the Complexin Block—We then set conditions to test whether synaptotagmin could modulate the effect of complexin in AE. In sperm, the C2A and C2B domains of synaptotagmin VI affect exocytosis (27Roggero C.M. Tomes C.N. De Blas G.A. Castillo J. Michaut M.A. Fukuda M. Mayorga L.S. Dev. Biol. 2005; 285: 422-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether the separated domains could rescue the complexin block. For these experiments, subinhibitory concentrations (100 nm) of both domains were added to assays containing inhibitory concentrations (200 nm) of complexin II. Interestingly, the C2B domain efficiently restored exocytosis. In contrast, the C2A domain was ineffective (Fig. 2, top). Rab3A-triggered exocytosis was used to assess whether the effect of the synaptotagmin VI domains on complexin inhibition was Ca2+ dependent. As shown in Fig. 2, middle, no rescue was observed in the absence of Ca2+ with the C2B or C2A domains. If Ca2+ plus Rab3A were used to activate exocytosis, the C2B (but not the C2A) domain relieved the complexin block (Fig. 2, bottom), indicating that the lack of effect in the presence of Rab3A alone was not due to a misbalance caused by an excess of the small GTPase. These observations indicate that the C2B domain of synaptotagmin VI is sufficient to compete the inhibitory effect of complexin in AE. Moreover, rescue is only observed in the presence of cytosolic Ca2+. Complexin II and the Synaptotagmin VI C2B Domain Arrest Fusion at Different Stages of the Fusion Process—We took advantage of the reversibility of the complexin block by displacement with the C2B domain of synaptotagmin VI to investigate the point in the exocytotic cascade where complexin exerts its function.

However, the impact of luteolin on experimental models of colitis is unknown.To address the therapeutic impact of luteolin, NF-kappaB(EGFP) transgenic mice were fed a chow diet containing 2% luteolin- or isoflavone-free control chow (AIN-76), and acute colitis was induced using 3% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). Additionally, development of spontaneous colitis was evaluated in IL-10(-/-);NF-kappaB(EGFP) transgenic mice fed 2% luteolin chow diet or control chow diet. Interestingly, NF-kappaB(EGFP) transgenic mice exposed to luteolin showed worse DSS-induced colitis (weight loss, histological scores) compared to control-fed mice, whereas spontaneous colitis in IL-10(-/-);NF-kappaB(EGFP) mice was significantly attenuated. Macroscopic imaging of live resected colon showed enhanced EGFP expression (NF-kappaB activity) in luteolin-fed mice as compared to control-fed animals after DSS exposure, while cecal EGFP expression was attenuated in luteolin-fed IL-10(-/-) mice. Interestingly, confocal microscopy showed that EGFP positive cells were mostly located in the lamina propria and not in the epithelium. Caspase 3 activation was significantly enhanced whereas COX-2 gene expression was reduced in luteolin-fed, DSS-exposed NF-kappaB(EGFP) transgenic mice as assessed by Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis. In vitro, luteolin sensitized colonic epithelial HT29 cells to TNFalpha-induced apoptosis, caspase 3 activation, DNA fragmentation and reduced TNFalpha-induced C-IAP1, C-IAP2 and COX-2 gene expression.We conclude that while luteolin shows beneficial effects on spontaneous colitis, it aggravates DSS-induced experimental colitis by blocking NF-kappaB-dependent protective molecules in enterocytes."

https://openalex.org/W2050836596,"The ability to respond to natural selection under novel conditions is critical for the establishment and persistence of introduced alien species and their ability to become invasive. Here we correlated neutral and quantitative genetic diversity of the weed Pennisetum setaceum Forsk. Chiov. (Poaceae) with differing global (North American and African) patterns of invasiveness and compared this diversity to native range populations. Numerous molecular markers indicate complete monoclonality within and among all of these areas (F(ST) = 0.0) and is supported by extreme low quantitative trait variance (Q(ST) = 0.00065-0.00952). The results support the general-purpose-genotype hypothesis that can tolerate all environmental variation. However, a single global genotype and widespread invasiveness under numerous environmental conditions suggests a super-genotype. The super-genotype described here likely evolved high levels of plasticity in response to fluctuating environmental conditions during the Early to Mid Holocene. During the Late Holocene, when environmental conditions were predominantly constant but extremely inclement, strong selection resulted in only a few surviving genotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2143630874,"Background Protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) regulate virtually all biological processes. PTKs phosphorylate substrates in a sequence-specific manner and relatively short peptide sequences determine selectivity. Here, we developed new technology to determine PTK activity profiles using peptide arrays. The zebrafish is an excellent model system to investigate signaling in the whole organism, given its wealth of genetic tools, including morpholino-mediated knock down technology. We used zebrafish embryo lysates to determine PTK activity profiles, thus providing the unique opportunity to directly compare the effect of protein knock downs on PTK activity profiles on the one hand and phenotypic changes on the other. Methodology We used multiplex arrays of 144 distinct peptides, spotted on a porous substrate, allowing the sample to be pumped up and down, optimizing reaction kinetics. Kinase reactions were performed using complex zebrafish embryo lysates or purified kinases. Peptide phosphorylation was detected by fluorescent anti-phosphotyrosine antibody binding and the porous chips allowed semi-continuous recording of the signal. We used morpholinos to knock down protein expression in the zebrafish embryos and subsequently, we determined the effects on the PTK activity profiles. Results and Conclusion Reproducible PTK activity profiles were derived from one-day-old zebrafiish embryos. Morpholino-mediated knock downs of the Src family kinases, Fyn and Yes, induced characteristic phenotypes and distinct changes in the PTK activity profiles. Interestingly, the peptide substrates that were less phosphorylated upon Fyn and Yes knock down were preferential substrates of purified Fyn and Yes. Previously, we demonstrated that Wnt11 knock down phenocopied Fyn/Yes knock down. Interestingly, Wnt11 knock down induced similar changes in the PTK activity profile as Fyn/Yes knock down. The control Nacre/Mitfa knock down did not affect the PTK activity profile significantly. Our results indicate that the novel peptide chip technology can be used to unravel kinase signaling pathways in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2039343657,"Population structure can confound the identification of correlations in biological data. Such confounding has been recognized in multiple biological disciplines, resulting in a disparate collection of proposed solutions. We examine several methods that correct for confounding on discrete data with hierarchical population structure and identify two distinct confounding processes, which we call coevolution and conditional influence. We describe these processes in terms of generative models and show that these generative models can be used to correct for the confounding effects. Finally, we apply the models to three applications: identification of escape mutations in HIV-1 in response to specific HLA-mediated immune pressure, prediction of coevolving residues in an HIV-1 peptide, and a search for genotypes that are associated with bacterial resistance traits in Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that coevolution is a better description of confounding in some applications and conditional influence is better in others. That is, we show that no single method is best for addressing all forms of confounding. Analysis tools based on these models are available on the internet as both web based applications and downloadable source code at http://atom.research.microsoft.com/bio/phylod.aspx."
https://openalex.org/W2165059412,"An implicit assumption underpins basic models of the evolution of cooperation, mutualism and altruism: The benefits (or pay-offs) of cooperation and defection are defined by the current frequency or distribution of cooperators. In social dilemmas involving durable public goods (group resources that can persist in the environment–ubiquitous from microbes to humans) this assumption is violated. Here, we examine the consequences of relaxing this assumption, allowing pay-offs to depend on both current and past numbers of cooperators. We explicitly trace the dynamic of a public good created by cooperators, and define pay-offs in terms of the current public good. By raising the importance of cooperative history in determining the current fate of cooperators, durable public goods cause novel dynamics (e.g., transient increases in cooperation in Prisoner's Dilemmas, oscillations in Snowdrift Games, or shifts in invasion thresholds in Stag-hunt Games), while changes in durability can transform one game into another, by moving invasion thresholds for cooperation or conditions for coexistence with defectors. This enlarged view challenges our understanding of social cheats. For instance, groups of cooperators can do worse than groups of defectors, if they inherit fewer public goods, while a rise in defectors no longer entails a loss of social benefits, at least not in the present moment (as highlighted by concerns over environmental lags). Wherever durable public goods have yet to reach a steady state (for instance due to external perturbations), the history of cooperation will define the ongoing dynamics of cooperators."

Dynamic transcription regulation of TPH2 may underlie differences in vulnerability. We identified a transcription element in the TPH2 promoter that resembles the binding motif for RE-1 silencer of transcription (REST; also known as NRSF) transcription factor. REST limits tissue expression of non-neuronal genes through a canonical 21-bp motif called the NRSE (neuron-restrictive silencing element). The NRSE in TPH2 is a novel bipartite variant interrupted by a 6-base insertion. We confirmed that this bipartite NRSE permits transcriptional repression by REST identical to canonical NRSE in rat C6-glioma cells. Synthetic permutations of the motif revealed considerable flexibility in the juxtaposition of the two halves of bipartite NRSE. Computational analysis revealed many bipartite NRSE variants conserved between mouse and human genomes. A subgroup of these was found to bind REST by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Messenger RNAs for TPH2 and potassium channel H6, another gene with a bipartite NRSE, were up-regulated by dominant-negative REST in C6-glioma cells. These findings, which indicate that TPH2 expression is part of the developmental program regulated by REST and suggest that many previously unrecognized genes may be regulated by REST through the novel motif, have implications for the mechanism of REST action.

The NRSE-like element in TPH2 is evolutionarily conserved but distinguished from the 21-bp canonical NRSE by the presence of a 6-bp insertion in the middle of the motif. We demonstrate that this bipartite NRSE (bNRSE) functions as a repressor through REST and that additional functional, evolutionarily conserved bNRSEs with variable insertions are found throughout the genome. Our findings indicate TPH2 is transcriptionally regulated by REST through a novel bNRSE. Moreover, these results have implications for the mechanism of action and the potential transcriptome regulated by REST. Clones—[SCN2a promoters lacking (Null) or including 113 bp of upstream sequence flanking the SCN2a NRSE (SCN113) were reengineered for luciferase reporter from clones kindly provided by Dr. Gail Mandel (31Chong J.A.

Mouse TPH2 promoter and 5′-UT sequences (607 bp) were PCR-cloned from bacterial artificial chromosome RPCI23 151J17 obtained from the Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute (Oakland, CA) using the primers mT2-MluI and mT2-NcoI (primer sequences are available in supplemental Table S1 online). All other NRSE motifs and mutants were synthesized as DNA oligonucleotides engineered with compatible overhangs to permit directional cloning into the polylinker NheI and BglII sites upstream of SCN2a minimal promoter in Null. To test the TPH2 bNRSE in its native context, the mouse 607-bp MluI-NcoI-flanked TPH2 promoter amplicon described above was cloned between MluI and NcoI of GL3Basic. All clones were sequence verified. An expression vector for human REST (REEX1) and dominant-negative REST (Dn-REST; p73) were gifts from Dr. Gail Mandel (31Chong J.A. Tapia-Ramirez J. Kim S.

Trichostatin A (made 1 mm in ethanol) and sodium butyrate (made 1 m in water) were purchased from Sigma. Cell Culture—C6-glioma cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in the recommended media. All transfection studies were repeated at least three times. For a typical transfection 50,000 cells/well were plated in a 24-well plate and transfected in triplicates. Transfection complexes with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) typically contained 0.3 μg of promoter-reporter construct, 0.6 μg of either control (empty vector), Dn-REST, or REST, and 0.1 μg of a 1:1 mixture of pEGFP-C2 (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) to monitor transfection efficiencies by fluorescence and pCMV-Sport-Bgal (Invitrogen) for reference β-galactosidase expression. Trichostatin A (100 nm) or sodium butyrate (5 mm) was added 4 h after transfection. After 48 h, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested with 50 μlof reporter lysis buffer, and 5 μl was assayed in parallel for luciferase (Promega) and β-galactosidase using Galacton-Plus (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Relative luciferase values were corrected for β-galactosidase values. Each experiment was conducted at least three times, and normalized average results across experiments are reported. Puromycin, obtained from Fisher Scientific, was resuspended in water at 2 mg/ml. The puromycin resistance gene was subcloned under the human ubiquitinC promoter in pUS2 backbone (38Kang H.C. Chung B.M. Chae J.H. Yang S.I. Kim C.G. Kim C.G. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 1265-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Two μg/ml puromycin killed >95% of C6-glioma cells in 48 h. Statistical analyses were conducted in Microsoft Excel or Graphpad Prism for Windows PC. Computational Analysis—We searched a locally constructed and publicly available Oracle data base (arrayanalysis.mbni.med.umich.edu/blast/). We initiated the search in mouse (mm6; build 34) because the mouse genome browser in the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) data base contains the most current multispecies alignments (39Kent W.J. Sugnet C.W. Furey T.S. Roskin K.M. Pringle T.H. Zahler A.M. Haussler D. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 996-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (6870) Google Scholar). Sequence output from a search for the 5′-half NRSE in this data base was processed with a PERL (www.activestate.com/) script that searched for a nearby 3′-half motif. Genomic locations for the resulting subset were uploaded to the UCSC mouse genome browser as a custom track, and an intersection table of precalculated “multiz10way” alignments was retrieved. Subsequent PERL scripts were used to parse the human and mouse tracks and limit the set to only those containing 5′- and 3′-half bNRSE matches in both species. To annotate gene locations, PERL scripts were used to compare all matches with the search spaced defined by annotated Ensemble genes (www.ensembl.org). Annotated results of this computational search are shown in supplemental Table S2. Where available, the flanking DNA sequence in the orthologous rat genome was retrieved for PCR primer design in Primer3 (40Rozen S. Skaletsky H. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 132: 365-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (see supplemental Table S1 for primer sequences). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP experiments were performed essentially as described in the ChIP assay kit (Upstate, Waltham, MA). Briefly, ∼5 × 105 cells/antibody were fixed with 2.5% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline, the lysate was cleared by centrifugation, and the chromatin was sheared by sonication to ∼200–1000-bp fragments. Samples were precleared with protein G-agarose/salmon sperm DNA slurry (Roche Applied Science). Antibodies to REST P-18 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or FLAG M2 (Sigma) were added, and antibody/chromatin complexes were collected by incubation with protein G-agarose/salmon sperm DNA slurry. Samples were washed and eluted from resin as per the kit. PCR was performed with the indicated primer pairs (supplemental Table S1) and iQ Supermix (Bio-Rad) for 35 cycles at an anneal temperature of 57 °C. For each result, two separate ChIP assays were run with identical results. Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—was conducted on a MyIQ cycler (Bio-Rad) using AmpliTaq/Syber-Green (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. First-strand cDNA template was made from 1 μgof DNase-treated C6-glioma cell total RNA using iScript reverse transcriptase, oligo(dT)/random hexamer mix, buffer, and the reaction conditions specified in the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Intron-spanning primers for hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT), TPH2, and KCNH6 (listed in supplemental Table S1) were verified to amplify a single amplicon of the correct size and sequence. All PCR reactions were run in triplicate, and the entire experiment was replicated. PCR conditions were 35 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 57 °C for 10 s, and 72 °C for 15 s. 10-Fold serial dilutions of template were used in PCR reactions to estimate amplification efficiencies. Relative expression levels of TPH2 and KCNH6 were normalized to the expression of HPRT according to the method of Pfaffl (41Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25871) Google Scholar). We aligned human, chimp, dog, mouse, and rat TPH2 promoters, revealing a highly conserved 21-bp motif that matched the 5′-half of the consensus NRSE (42Schoenherr C.J. Paquette A.J. Anderson D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9881-9886Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) but lacked identity with the 3′-half (“NRSE-like”). Closer inspection revealed a perfect match to the 3′-half 6 bp downstream relative to its expected location (Fig. 1A). This motif is located in the vicinity of the cloned mammalian TPH2 mRNA 5′-ends (Fig. 1B). To determine whether this NRSE variant would function as a REST silencing element, we engineered a luciferase expression vector for testing NRSE variants based on the previously published rat sodium channel 2a (SCN2a) promoter (20Kraner S.D. Chong J.A. Tsay H.J. Mandel G. Neuron. 1992; 9: 37-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). A “Null” control contained the rat SCN2a minimal promoter. SCN113 contained the 113-bp SCN2a NRSE upstream fragment, and SCN21 contained only the core SCN2a NRSE in the upstream polylinker. SCN21 differs from the earlier report (31Chong J.A. Tapia-Ramirez J. Kim S. Toledo-Aral J.J. Zheng Y. Boutros M.C. Altshuller Y.M. Frohman M.A. Kraner S.D. Mandel G. Cell. 1995; 80: 949-957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar) in two ways: (a) it contains a luciferase reporter instead of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, and (b) the NRSE is introduced as only the core 21-bp motif. A “scrambled” control (Scr21) contained a random 21-bp sequence instead of the 21-bp NRSE (Fig. 2A). To verify our modified constructs, we tested repression activity in rat C6-glioma cells with or without Dn-REST, a dominant-negative inhibitor of REST (31Chong J.A. Tapia-Ramirez J. Kim S. Toledo-Aral J.J. Zheng Y. Boutros M.C. Altshuller Y.M. Frohman M.A. Kraner S.D. Mandel G. Cell. 1995; 80: 949-957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). C6-glioma cells were previously shown to express full-length REST and mediate repression of NRSE bearing heterologous promoters (34Palm K. Belluardo N. Metsis M. Timmusk T. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1280-1296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The truncated version (SCN21) behaved identically to the longer SCN113 (20Kraner S.D. Chong J.A. Tsay H.J. Mandel G. Neuron. 1992; 9: 37-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Both exhibited ∼90% repression in C6-glioma cells and reversed >65% in the presence of dominant-negative REST (Fig. 2B). The Null and scrambled controls exhibited similar levels of reporter.FIGURE 2bNRSE repression of SCN2a minimal promoter-luciferase in C6-glioma cells. A, schematic of reporter constructs tested. See “Experimental Procedures” for further descriptions. B, relative expression of luciferase divided by expression of β-galactosidase (Rel. Luc/B-gal), shown as the mean ± S.E. of triplicate experiments, is normalized to expression of Scr21 in the absence of Dn-REST. T2N607 contains 607 bp of native mouse TPH2 promoter and the 5′-untranslated sequence upstream of luciferase in pGL3basic. C, expression regulation by scrambled control (Scr21), the TPH2 bNRSE (T2N27), and native mouse TPH2 promoter T2N607 in mouse neuro-2A cells in the absence (Control) or presence of human REST (hREST) expression vector. Results are shown as the mean ± S.E. of triplicates normalized to Scr21 in the absence of human REST. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01 compared with control condition by analysis of variance followed by Tukey's post hoc test.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We tested in this reporter the 21 bp “NRSE-like” motif (T2N21) from mouse TPH2 (identical in rat and human) as well as a longer variant including the complete 5′ and 3′ motifs (T2N27). T2N21 exhibited moderate repression activity in C6-glioma cells. However, this degree of repression (typically ∼50% decrease) was much less than that seen with SCN21. T2N27, by contrast, repressed comparably to SCN21, and was comparably derepressed by Dn-REST (Fig. 2B). We call the extended motif a “bipartite NRSE” as distinguished from the “classic” 21-bp NRSE. Given that the 2 bp in the middle of classic NRSE are ambiguous, we refer to the sequence separating the 5′ and 3′-halves as a “spacer,” being 2 bp in classic NRSE and 8 bp in bNRSE of TPH2. T2N21, which contains 4 bp of the 3′-half, in fact, reconstituted 6 bp because of the adjacent “AG” of the BglII site and actually represented a bipartite version of the recently reported consensus motif (43Bruce A.W. Donaldson I.J. Wood I.C. Yerbury S.A. Sadowski M.I. Chapman M. Gottgens B. Buckley N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10458-10463Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), consistent with partial repression by this construct. Neither the 5′-half nor the 3′-half by itself was an effective repressor, although the 3′-half showed some mild repression (Fig. 3B). REST represses or silences gene expression by several mechanisms, some of which involve recruitment of histone deacetylase. To determine whether the silencing activity observed is mediated by histone modification, we tested activity in the presence of trichostatin A, a histone deacetylase inhibitor. As shown in Fig. 3A, 100 nm trichostatin A partially reversed silencing of heterologous constructs containing classic and bNRSEs. As a percentage of basal expression, trichostatin A was equally effective (250–300% increase) in derepressing promoter activity but had no effect on a construct lacking an NRSE. Five millimolar sodium butyrate, another inhibitor of histone deacetylase (44Candido E.P. Reeves R. Davie J.R. Cell. 1978; 14: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar), had a comparable effect on the bNRSE motif (Fig. 3A). T2N27 contains a duplication of the “RG” dinucleotide (Fig. 1A, **) reported to be critical for NRSE function (45Mori N. Mizuno T. Murai K. Nakano I. Yamashita H. Neurobiol. Aging. 2002; 23: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). One GG pair is topographically preserved with respect to the 5′-half NRSE (++), and a second pair is preserved with respect to the 3′-half NRSE (**). We mutated each GG pair to TT separately or in concert in T2N27. Mutation of the first (++) GG pair (T2N27m2) had no effect on silencing activity (Fig. 3B). Mutation of the second (**) GG pair (T2N27m3) markedly reversed repression. Mutation of both pairs (T2N27m2/3) had the same effect as T2N27m3. Near complete derepression was also achieved by a GC to TT mutation (T2N27m1) in the 5′-half motif (Fig. 1, [caret] [caret]). A double mutant containing both functional mutations (T2N27m1/3) was no different from each mutation separately (Fig. 3B). To establish that REST is bound to bNRSE of TPH2 in vivo, we carried out ChIP assays in C6-glioma cells. REST antibody specifically pulled down chromatin fragments containing the SCN2a and the TPH2 promoter, but it did not pull down a fragment of the TPH2 gene 106 kilobases 3′ to the promoter (Fig. 3C). Immunoprecipitates using a control antibody (anti-FLAG) lacked any of these amplicons. We conclude from these findings that REST binds the bNRSE motif in the TPH2 promoter and that the critical RG pair (45Mori N. Mizuno T. Murai K. Nakano I. Yamashita H. Neurobiol. Aging. 2002; 23: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) constrains only the 3′-half of bNRSE-mediated silencing, but mutation of either half-site abolishes repression activity. The bNRSE in TPH2 is located near the transcription initiation site predicted from cloned cDNAs from several mammals (Fig. 1B). To determine whether it is a repressor in its native context, we tested 607 bp of the promoter and 5′-UT of mouse TPH2 (through the ATG start codon) in pGL3-luciferase (clone T2N607). As with the SCN2a reporter constructs, we observed potent repression (∼75%) that was reversed by Dn-REST (Fig. 2B). Conversely, in mouse neuro-2A cells, which lack functional REST, neither the TPH2 bNRSE motif by itself nor the 607-bp TPH2 promoter was repressed, and in fact, they showed enhancer activity relative to scrambled control that was repressed by co-transfection with full-length REST (Fig. 2C). To ask whether the 5′- and 3′-halves of bNRSE are topographically constrained, we tested constructs containing 2-bp step changes in the size of the spacer (Fig. 4A). The 21-bp canonical length (T2sp21) and T2N27 showed the most potent repression, and other sizes showed attenuated responses (Fig. 4B). To determine the orientation dependence, we tested variants in which the 5′- and 3′-halves of the NRSE were inverted or swapped. We tested these in the 21-bp version, in which is it unlikely that the DNA strand could"

https://openalex.org/W2092586500,"We have characterized a rodent-specific gene family designated α-takusan (meaning “many” in Japanese). We initially identified a member of the family whose expression is upregulated in mice lacking the NMDAR subunit NR3A. We then isolated cDNAs encoding 46 α-takusan variants from mouse brains. Most variants share an ∼130 aa long sequence, which contains the previously identified domain of unknown function 622 (DUF622) and is predicted to form coiled-coil structures. Single-cell PCR analyses indicate that one neuron can express multiple α-takusan variants and particular variants may predominate in certain cell types. Forced expression in cultured hippocampal neurons of two variants, α1 or α2, which bind either directly or indirectly to PSD-95, leads to an increase in PSD-95 clustering, dendritic spine density, GluR1 surface expression, and AMPAR activity. Conversely, treating cultured neurons with RNAi targeting α-takusan variants resulted in the opposite phenotype. Hence, α-takusan represents a large gene family that regulates synaptic activity."

Phytanic acid contains a methyl group in position three and, therefore, cannot undergo β-oxidation directly but instead must first undergo α-oxidation to pristanic acid, which then enters β-oxidation. Both these pathways occur in peroxisomes, and in this study we have identified a novel peroxisomal acyl-CoA thioesterase named ACOT6, which we show is specifically involved in phytanic acid and pristanic acid metabolism. Sequence analysis of ACOT6 revealed a putative peroxisomal targeting signal at the C-terminal end, and cellular localization experiments verified it as a peroxisomal enzyme. Subcellular fractionation experiments showed that peroxisomes contain by far the highest phytanoyl-CoA/pristanoyl-CoA thioesterase activity in the cell, which could be almost completely immunoprecipitated using an ACOT6 antibody. Acot6 mRNA was mainly expressed in white adipose tissue and was co-expressed in tissues with Acox3 (the pristanoyl-CoA oxidase).

Methyl-branched fatty acids such as phytanic acid (3,7,11,15-tetramethylhexadecanoic acid) and pristanic acid (2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecanoic acid) are found in ruminant fats, such as dairy products and beef, but are also found in chlorophyll-containing plants and are ingested in the diet. The body cannot metabolize chlorophyll itself, but instead intestinal flora, mainly present in ruminant animals, can cleave off the side chain of chlorophyll, producing phytol. Phytol is then converted to phytanic acid or phytanoyl-CoA depending on if the phytol is metabolized further directly in the intestine or after uptake into cells, respectively (for review, see Ref. 1Jansen G.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 1403-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Phytanic acid containing a methyl group in the third position is first converted to a 2-methyl-branched fatty acid, pristanic acid, via α-oxidation (2Avigan J. Steinberg D. Gutman A. Mize C.E.

Before α-oxidation can take place, the phytanic acid is activated to the CoA ester, which can occur either outside the peroxisome by the long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase or inside the peroxisome by the very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (3Watkins P.A.

This racemization step is carried out by the 2-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) (6Schmitz W. Fingerhut R. Conzelmann E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 38: 2991-2999Google Scholar, 7Ferdinandusse S. Denis S.

After 3 rounds of β-oxidation 4,8-dimethylnonanoyl-CoA (DMN-CoA) is produced, which can then either be hydrolyzed to the free acid or esterified to carnitine for transport to mitochondria for further β-oxidation (9Farrell S.O. Bieber L.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 222: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 10Ofman R. el Mrabet L. Dacremont G. Spijer D. Wanders R.J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These pathways are well described in the literature; however, subcellular localization, activation, and transport of substrates and products are still somewhat unclear. Both α-oxidation and the first three cycles of β-oxidation are entirely peroxisomal processes (8Verhoeven N.M. Jacobs C. Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; 40: 453-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 11Van Veldhoven P.P. Casteels M. Mannaerts G.P. Baes M. Biochem. Soc.

The importance of α-oxidation and β-oxidation is underscored by the diseases affecting either of the pathways, such as Refsum disease, AMACR deficiency, and multifunctional protein-2 deficiency (for review, see Refs. 8Verhoeven N.M.

Also, the importance of the breakdown of phytol to phytanic acid is demonstrated by the occurrence of a disease affecting the microsomal fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase catalyzing the oxidation of phytenal to phytenic acid, causing the Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (15Willemsen M.A.A.P.

In this paper we describe the identification of a novel gene that encodes a peroxisomal acyl-CoA thioesterase specific for phytanoyl-CoA and pristanoyl-CoA that can hydrolyze these compounds to phytanic acid, pristanic acid, and coenzyme A. This phytanoyl-CoA/pristanoyl-CoA thioesterase (Acot6) gene is a member of a gene family of acyl-CoA thioesterases, localized in a condensed cluster on chromosome 12 D3 in mouse, which codes for acyl-CoA thioesterases with localizations in cytosol, mitochondria, and peroxisomes (16Hunt M.C.

Localization of ACOT6 in Peroxisomes—The full-length open reading frame encoding ACOT6 was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from mouse kidney using the following primers 5′-CAT ATG GCG GCG ACA CTG A-3′ and 5′-CAT ATG TTA CAG TTT GCT GTG-3′ (Cybergene AB, Huddinge, Sweden). The product was cloned into the pcDNA3.1/NT-GFP vector (Invitrogen), which expresses the protein as an N-terminal green fluorescent fusion protein, leaving the C-terminal SKL of ACOT6 accessible. The construct was transfected into human skin fibroblasts from a control subject and a Zellweger patient using the calcium phosphate method. Immunofluorescence microscopy was carried out as described previously (19Hunt M.C. Solaas K. Kase B.F. Alexson S.E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1128-1138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Chemical Synthesis of Pristanoyl-CoA and Phytanoyl-CoA—Phytanoyl-CoA and pristanoyl-CoA were synthesized chemically from the respective free acids (Sigma-Aldrich) by first forming the anhydride and in the next step the CoA ester (20Chase J.F.A. Biochem. J. 1967; 104: 510-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Phytanoyl-CoA and pristanoyl-CoA were then purified by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography using a C18 Ultrasphere ODS 5-μm (4.6 × 250 mm) column (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA) with a mobile phase containing 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 5.4, and 38% isopropanol. After 10 min the mobile phase was changed to 58% isopropanol for 40 min. Purified products were then verified by mass spectrometry as described in Westin et al. (18Westin M.A.K. Hunt M.C. Alexson S.E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38125-38132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Expression of Recombinant ACOT6 Protein—The full-length open reading frame for Acot6 was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from mouse kidney using the One-Step RNA PCR kit (Takara Biomedicals, Shiga, Japan) using the primers 5′-GAA TTC ATG GCG GCG ACA CTG AGC G-3′ and 5′-GTC GAC TTA CAG TTT GCT GTG CCT G-3′ (Cybergene AB, Huddinge, Sweden). The addition of an EcoRI and a SalI site (indicated in bold) were used for cloning into the pMAL-C2x vector (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), which results in expression of the protein as a fusion protein with maltose-binding protein. The construct was transformed into BL21(DES3) pLysS (Novagen Inc., Madison, WI), and protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.3 mm isopropyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma-Aldrich Inc.) for 2 h at 37 °Cin LB-media supplemented with 2% glucose, 50 μg/ml ampicillin, and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min, washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and frozen overnight in 50 ml of column buffer (20 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, and 1mm EDTA, pH 7.4). Bacteria were lysed by sonication for 1 min at 5-s intervals and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min. Recombinant protein was purified by affinity chromatography using amylose resin (New England Biolabs), by elution with 10 mm maltose in column buffer. Purity and size of the eluted protein was checked by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining, and protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214321) Google Scholar). Measurement of Acyl-CoA Thioesterase Activity—Acyl-CoA thioesterase activity was measured spectrophotometrically at 232 nm in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4, measuring the cleavage of the thioester bond as a decrease in the absorbance. Various acyl-CoAs were used as substrates, including acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, acetoacetyl-CoA, butyryl-CoA, heptanoyl-CoA, decanoyl-CoA, lauroyl-CoA, myristoyl-CoA, palmitoyl-CoA, palmitoleoyl-CoA, oleoyl-CoA, linoleoyl-CoA, linolenoyl-CoA, arachidoyl-CoA, arachidonoyl-CoA, behenoyl-CoA, branched-chain substrates including pristanoyl-CoA, phytanoyl-CoA, DMN-CoA, 2-methyloctadecanoyl-CoA, the bile acid intermediate trihydroxycholoyl-CoA, and the primary bile acid choloyl-CoA. The pristanoyl-CoA, phytanoyl-CoA, trihydroxycholoyl-CoA, and choloyl-CoA were synthesized in our laboratory, whereas 4,8-dimethylnonanoyl-CoA, behenoyl-CoA, and an aliquot of phytanoyl-CoA were a kind gift from Dr. Ronald Wanders. The other acyl-CoAs were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The effect of free CoASH on ACOT6 activity was tested at concentrations up to 500 μm. The kinetic parameters were calculated using Prism Enzyme Kinetics program using an extinction coefficient of E232 = 4.25 mm–1 cm–1 to calculate the specific activities. Subcellular Fractionation and Isolation of Peroxisomes—For subcellular fractionation experiments, adult male mice on a pure C57Bl6 background (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were used. Mice were fed either a normal chow diet or a diet containing 0.5% (w/w) clofibrate (ICI Pharmaceuticals, Macclesfield, Cheshire, UK) for 1 week, and all mice were fasted overnight before sacrifice. After sacrifice by CO2 asphyxiation and cervical dislocation, liver and kidneys were excised and used directly for subcellular fractionation. Tissues were weighed and placed in ice-cold buffer containing 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 15 mm MES, pH 6.5, minced finely, homogenized, and diluted to a 10% homogenate. Homogenates were centrifuged for 10 min at 500 × gav, and pellets were rehomogenized and re-centrifuged. Post-nuclear supernatants were combined and centrifuged at 4000 × gav for 10 min to sediment mitochondria, which were saved for subsequent measurements. The supernatants were centrifuged at 30 000 × gav for 20 min to obtain the light mitochondrial fraction containing the bulk of peroxisomes. The pellets were washed once by centrifugation and finally dissolved in ice-cold 0.25 m sucrose and 15 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. These fractions were then layered on top of linear 20–45% Optiprep (Sigma-Aldrich) gradients, resting on a 50% Optiprep cushion, and centrifuged for 90 min at 40,000 × gav in a fixed angle rotor, and 1-ml fractions were collected from the bottom of the gradient. The fractions were analyzed for the peroxisomal marker catalase as described in Baudhuin et al. (22Baudhuin P. Beaufay H. Rahman-Li Y. Sellinger O.Z. Wattiaux R. Jacques P. De Duve C. Biochem. J. 1964; 92: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Supernatants obtained after preparation of the light-mitochondrial fractions were centrifuged at 40,000 × gav for 2 h, supernatants were saved as cytosolic fractions, and pellets were dissolved in 0.25 m sucrose and 15 mm Hepes, pH 7.4 and saved as microsomal fractions for subsequent measurements. Immunoprecipitation of ACOT6 in Purified Peroxisomes— ACOT6 anti-sera were produced in rabbits immunized with a peptide with the sequence CQKYLNGEKPARH, which corresponds to amino acids 406–417 of the ACOT6 protein and an N-terminal Cys for coupling of the peptide to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The antibody was affinity-purified by chromatography as described previously (17Westin M.A.K. Alexson S.E.H. Hunt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21841-21848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Pre-immune serum or affinity-purified ACOT6 antibody in various concentrations (in PBS, 0.1% Triton) was added to protein A-Sepharose beads and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The protein A-Sepharose suspension was centrifuged at 10 000 × gav in a microcentrifuge for 10 min, the supernatants were removed, and 100 μg of peroxisomal protein in PBS, 0.1% Triton was added and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C in an orbital shaker. The protein A-Sepharose suspension was spun down, and the supernatants were used for acyl-CoA thioesterase activity measurements as described above. Animals and Treatments for Investigation of Tissue Expression and Regulation of Expression—Adult male wild type (+/+) mice or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα)-null (–/–) mice on a pure Sv/129 genetic background (23Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. Frank Gonzalez and Dr. Jeffrey Peters) were used for RNA isolation and for preparation of protein homogenates. Mice were fed either a standard chow diet or a diet containing 0.1% Wy-14,643 (Calbiochem-Novabiochem) for 1 week before sacrifice. Mice were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation, and cervical dislocation and tissues were excised, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –70 °C. Isolation of Total RNA and Real-time PCR (Q-PCR)—Total RNA from various mouse tissues was isolated using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) and was DNase-treated using RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). The quality of the RNA was checked on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel. Tissue expression was investigated in liver, kidney, heart, lung, spleen, brain, proximal (first 10 cm of small intestine) and distal intestine (last 10 cm of small intestine), brown adipose tissue and white adipose tissue using total RNA pooled from three individual animals. For regulation by Wy-14,643 treatment in liver, three individual animals in each group were used. Synthesis of cDNA was performed with 1 μg of total RNA using TaqMan reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). For Acot6, a specific amplicon was designed using the Primer Express software spanning the exon 2/exon 3 boundary using the primers 5′-ACG CCA TCC TCA GGT GAA AG-3′ and 5′-TCA GGA AAG CAG CCA TCG A-3′ and a probe with a 5′-6-carboxyfluorescein and 3′-dabcyl with the sequence 5′-TGT CTC CAA AGG TGC TGA TCT GTG CC-3′. Q-PCR was performed in single-plex and in triplicate with 18 S as an endogenous control as described previously (18Westin M.A.K. Hunt M.C. Alexson S.E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38125-38132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For tissue expression of Phyh, Amacr, and Acox3, SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems) was used as well as for Acot6 in the comparative tissue expression experiment. Specific primers for Phyh were designed over the exon 4/exon 5 boundary, for Amacr over the exon2/exon3 boundary, and for Acox3 over the exon 5/exon 6 boundary using the primers shown in Table 1. As an endogenous control, a specific amplicon of mouse hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Hprt1) spanning the exon6/exon7 boundary was used, with primers also shown in Table 1. Q-PCR was run as described in Westin et al. (18Westin M.A.K. Hunt M.C. Alexson S.E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38125-38132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) with the change of master mix to SYBR Green Power master mix (Applied Biosystems) and with the addition of a dissociation step to check the specificity of the products. The PCR products were checked by agarose gel electrophoresis. The efficacy of all primer pairs was checked by running Q-PCR on dilutions of the template cDNA, verifying that tissue expression was analyzed in the linear range of the PCR. The average threshold (Ct) values per triplicate were used to calculate the relative amounts of mRNA using the 2–ΔΔCt method according to Applied Biosystems guidelines.TABLE 1Sequences of SYBR Green primers for mouse phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase (Phyh), α-methylacyl-CoA racemase (Amacr), acyl-CoA oxidase 3 (Acox3), acyl-CoA thioesterase 6 (Acot6), and hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Hprt1) for Q-PCRPhyhForward 5′-ACT GCC TTC TCC CCG AGA TT-3′Reverse 5′-TGG GTC CAG TGA AAC ACT CCA-3′AmacrForward 5′-CTA TTT GGC TTT ATC AGG CGT TC-3′Reverse 5′-TTC TCA CCG CTT CTG CCA AT-3′Acox3Forward 5′-TTG AGA AGA TCT ATA GCC TGG AGA TTT-3′Reverse 5′-AGT TCG GTG AGA GCA AAACAG C-3′Acot6Forward 5′-GGT GAA AAG GAC CTC TCG AAG TG-3′Reverse 5′-ATA GTC AAG GGC ATA TCC AAC AAC A-3′Hprt1Forward 5′-GGT GAA AAG GAC CTC TCG AAG TG-3′Reverse 5′-ATA GTC AAG GGC ATA TCC AAC AAC A-3′ Open table in a new tab Western Blot Analysis—Liver homogenates were prepared from control and Wy-treated male mouse, and 50 μg of protein was used for SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described previously (24Hunt M.C.

ACOT6 antibody was produced and purified as described above, and the antibody reactivity was checked against recombinant ACOT6 protein. Identification of ACOT6 as a Novel Peroxisomal Acyl-CoA Thioesterase—We have previously identified a cluster of genes on mouse chromosome 12 D3, which codes for acyl-CoA thioesterases. To date we have characterized 5 of these genes, named Acot1-5. Acot3, Acot1, and Acot2 encode long-chain acyl-CoA thioesterases localized in peroxisomes, cytosol, and mitochondria, respectively (17Westin M.A.K. Alexson S.E.H. Hunt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21841-21848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 25Lindquist P.J.G. Svensson L.T. Alexson S.E.H. Eur. J.

J. 1998; 329: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Acot5 and Acot4 encode a medium-chain acyl-CoA thioesterase and a succinyl-CoA thioesterase, respectively (17Westin M.A.K. Alexson S.E.H. Hunt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21841-21848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 18Westin M.A.K. Hunt M.C. Alexson S.E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38125-38132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This cluster contains a further gene, named Acot6, which shows an identical gene organization to the other genes in this cluster. Based on the genomic sequence, primers were designed to amplify the open reading frame of Acot6 by PCR, and the product was completely sequenced and deposited under GenBankTM accession number AY999300. The resulting protein contains 419 amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass of 46.7 kDa and shows ∼70% sequence identity to the other ACOTs in this gene family. Notably the C-terminal ends serine, lysine, leucine (SKL) strongly suggesting a peroxisomal localization. To examine whether this SKL results in targeting of the protein to peroxisomes, we expressed the protein as an N-terminal fusion protein with green fluorescent protein (GFP), leaving the C-terminal SKL accessible. The ACOT6-GFP plasmid was transfected into human skin fibroblasts and showed a punctate expression indicative of a peroxisomal localization (Fig. 2A). A peroxisomal localization was then confirmed by transfection of the same plasmid into fibroblasts from a Zellweger patient. These fibroblasts lack functional peroxisomes since they have a generalized import defect, and in these cells ACOT6-GFP expression showed a diffuse cytosolic localization (Fig. 2B), confirming that the punctate expression visible in the control fibroblasts is indeed peroxisomal. Identification of ACOT6 as a Peroxisomal Phytanoyl-CoA/Pristanoyl-CoA Thioesterase—Expression of ACOT6 as a fusion protein with a histidine tag or as a fusion protein with thioredoxin failed to produce soluble protein. However, expression of ACOT6 as a fusion protein with maltose-binding protein resulted in soluble protein. After purification by affinity chromatography using an amylose resin, acyl-CoA thioesterase activity was measured on a variety of acyl-CoAs (see “Materials and Methods”), which showed ACOT6 to be active only on pristanoyl-CoA (2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecanoyl-CoA) with a Vmax of 3.20 μmol/min/mg and a Km of 24 μm (Fig. 3). The enzyme was not active on any other methyl-branched substrates, i.e. 2-methyloctadecanoyl-CoA and DMN-CoA, although at this stage phytanoyl-CoA was not available, demonstrating that ACOT6 is highly specific for pristanoyl-CoA. The 2-methyl group in pristanic acid is present in both the 2R and 2S configuration, and it has been shown that the peroxisomal pristanoyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX3) is only active on the 2S stereoisomer (8Verhoeven N.M. Jacobs C. Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; 40: 453-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Therefore, the AMACR is required as an auxiliary enzyme for complete oxidation of pristanic acid (6Schmitz W. Fingerhut R. Conzelmann E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 38: 2991-2999Google Scholar). Because the commercial pristanic acid was chemically synthesized, it is presumed to contain a racemic mixture of 2R and 2S stereoisomers. We, therefore, tested if ACOT6 was active on both stereoisomers by incubation of ACOT6 with the presumed racemic mixture of synthesized pristanoyl-CoA for 30 min, and results showed that ACOT6 hydrolyzed almost 100% of the added substrate, suggesting that ACOT6 has no stereo-specificity for the 2R and 2S isomers (data not shown). Increasing concentrations of free CoASH up to 500 μm showed that ACOT6 activity is not regulated by free CoASH (data not shown), similar to the other members of this gene family. Even using the maltose-binding protein expression system it was very difficult to obtain active ACOT6 protein, probably due to improper folding. To verify that ACOT6 is indeed a peroxisomal pristanoyl-CoA thioesterase, we also performed complementary experiments utilizing purified peroxisomes from mouse liver and kidney from control and clofibrate-treated animals. Peroxisomes were isolated using standard procedures with the final step being gradient centrifugation in Optiprep. When performing the biochemical characterization of recombinant ACOT6 (described in Fig. 3), we did not have access to phytanoyl-CoA, which is not commercially available. Based on the structural similarity to pristanoyl-CoA, we therefore subsequently synthesized phytanoyl-CoA and tested the activity in the purified organelle fractions. Indeed, the activity in purified peroxisomes is very similar with phytanoyl-CoA and pristanoyl-CoA, with Km values of 32 and 35 μm and Vmax values of 176 and 215 nmol/min/mg, respectively, suggesting that ACOT6 could be similarly active on both these substrates (Fig. 4, A and B). To establish whether the peroxisomal phytanoyl-CoA and pristanoyl-CoA thioesterase activities in peroxisomes are catalyzed by ACOT6, we immunoprecipitated the peroxisomal fraction with an ACOT6 peptide antibody using preimmune serum as a control. The anti-ACOT6 IgG immunoprecipitated almost all of the peroxisomal phytanoyl-CoA and pristanoyl-CoA thioesterase activity, demonstrating that ACOT6 is the major phytanoyl-CoA/pristanoyl-CoA thioesterase in peroxisomes (Fig. 4C). As expected, no lauroyl-CoA thioesterase activity was immunoprecipitated with the ACOT6 antibody. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that ACOT6 is a novel peroxisomal thioesterase with a function in regulation of phytanic acid and pristanic acid metabolism. Phytanoyl-CoA and Pristanoyl-CoA Thioesterase Activity Is Highest in Peroxisomes—The important role of peroxisomes in the metabolism of phytanic acid and pristanic acid has been well established (for review, see Ref. 27van den Brink D.M.

https://openalex.org/W2022984307,"The circularly permuted GTPase YlqF is essential for cell viability and is broadly conserved from Gram-positive bacteria to eukaryotes. We previously reported that YlqF participates in the late step of 50 S ribosomal subunit assembly in Bacillus subtilis. Here, we demonstrate that an N-terminal deletion mutant of YlqF (YlqFΔN10) inhibits cell growth even in the presence of wild-type YlqF. In contrast to the wild-type protein, the GTPase activity of this mutant was not stimulated by the 50 S subunit and did not dissociate from the premature 50 S subunit. Thus, YlqFΔN10 acts as a competitive inhibitor of wild-type YlqF. Premature 50 S subunit lacking ribosomal protein L27 and with a reduced amount of L16 accumulated in YlqFΔN10-overexpressing cells and in YlqF-depleted cells, suggesting that YlqFΔN10 binds to the premature 50 S subunit. Moreover, premature 50 S subunit from both YlqFΔN10-overexpressing and YlqF-depleted cells more strongly enhanced the GTPase activity of YlqF than the mature 50 S subunit of the 70 S ribosome. Collectively, our results indicate that YlqF is targeted to the premature 50 S subunit lacking ribosomal proteins L16 and L27 to assemble functional 50 S subunit through a GTPase activity-dependent conformational change of 23 S rRNA.

GTP-binding proteins are highly conserved and play critical roles in various cellular processes. Binding and hydrolysis of GTP results in reciprocal conformational changes of the GTP-binding proteins, and the GTP- and GDP-bound forms define the active and inactive states, respectively (1Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2660) Google Scholar). GTP-binding proteins are also crucial for bacterial growth. The genome of the Gram-positive spore-forming bacterium, Bacillus subtilis, encodes 21 GTP-binding proteins, 13 of which (IF-2, EF-Tu, EF-G, Ffh, FtsY, FtsZ, Era, Obg, YphC, YsxC, YlqF, YqeH, and YloQ) are essential for cell viability (2Kobayashi K.

Three proteins (IF-2, EF-Tu, and EF-G) are components of translation initiation and elongation factors, and their cellular functions are well characterized. The remaining seven belong to a distinct group of small GTP-binding proteins (3Morimoto T. Loh P.C. Hirai T. Asai K. Kobayashi K. Moriya S. Ogasawara N.

These latter GTP-binding proteins have been reported to associate with the 30 S or 50 S subunit, and their depletion results in abnormal ribosome profiles in B. subtilis and other bacteria (5Comartin D.J.

Pol. 2005; 52: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), suggesting that they are involved in the biogenesis of the 50 S or 30 S subunit; however, the precise actions of GTP-binding proteins on the ribosome remain to be clarified.Obg interacts with the 50 S subunit in Escherichia coli and Caulobacter crescentus (11Wout P.

Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In B. subtilis, Obg co-fractionates with the 50 S subunit and interacts specifically with the ribosomal protein L13 (15Scott J.M. Haldenwang W.G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4653-4660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). B. subtilis YphC and YsxC also bind to the ribosome, and when they are depleted from cells, premature 50 S subunit accumulates (7Schaefer L. Uicker W.C. Wicker-Planquart C. Foucher A.E. Jault J.M. Britton R.A. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 8252-8258Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In contrast, E. coli Era interacts with the 30 S ribosomal subunit (13Inoue K. Alsina J. Chen J. Inouye M.

E. coli Era functionally compensates for deletion of the gene encoding the cold-shock adaptation protein RbfA (13Inoue K. Alsina J. Chen J. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), which is required for efficient processing of 16 S rRNA (18Dammel C.S. Noller H.F. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 626-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). E. coli YjeQ, an ortholog of B. subtilis YloQ, is also associated with the 30 S subunit in E. coli, and its GTPase activity is specifically enhanced in the presence of the 30 S subunit (19Himeno H.

Finally, B. subtilis YqeH has been suggested to be involved in assembly of the 30 S subunit (21Uicker W.C. Schaefer L. Koenigsknecht M. Britton R.A. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 2926-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).A recent report has revealed the molecular action of several of these GTP-binding proteins, notably E. coli Era (22Sharma M.R. Barat C. Wilson D.N. Booth T.M. Kawazoe M. HoriTakemoto C. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Fucini P. Agrawal R.K. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 319-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A three-dimensional cryoelectron microscopic map of the Thermus thermophilus 30 S-Era complex indicated that Era binds within the cleft between the head and platform of the 30 S subunit, which overlaps with the S1-binding site. Moreover, Era binding on the 30 S subunit interferes with association of 30 S and 50 S subunits, suggesting that dissociation of Era and incorporation of S1 compose the final step of 30 S subunit assembly and that Era inhibits formation of the translation initiation complex on prematurely assembled 30 S subunits. In contrast, we and others have demonstrated that B. subtilis YlqF is required for the assembly of the 50 S subunit (23Uicker W.C. Schaefer L. Britton R.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 528-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 24Matsuo Y. Morimoto T. Kuwano M. Loh P.C. Oshima T. Ogasawara N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8110-8117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In YlqF-depleted cells, premature 50 S subunit lacking ribosomal proteins L16 and L27 accumulates, and there is a decrease in the amount of 70 S ribosome (23Uicker W.C. Schaefer L. Britton R.A. Mol.

Chem. 2006; 281: 8110-8117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although purified YlqF binds to the premature 50 S subunit (45 S) and not to the mature 50 S subunit in the absence of guanine nucleotide (23Uicker W.C. Schaefer L. Britton R.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 528-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), it can bind stably to the free 50 S subunit in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog GTPγS 2The abbreviations used are:GTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphateIPTGisopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. 2The abbreviations used are:GTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphateIPTGisopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. (24Matsuo Y. Morimoto T. Kuwano M. Loh P.C. Oshima T. Ogasawara N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8110-8117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), suggesting that a conformational change from GTP- to GDP-bound form is important for the dissociation of YlqF from the mature 50 S subunit.Given these findings, we have proposed the following model (24Matsuo Y. Morimoto T. Kuwano M. Loh P.C. Oshima T. Ogasawara N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8110-8117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). First, GTP-bound YlqF binds to the premature 50 S subunit lacking L16 and L27. Next, L16 and L27 are incorporated into the 50 S subunit as a result of YlqF-induced conformational changes in the interface region of the premature 50 S subunit. GTP-bound YlqF is converted to the GDP-bound form through assembled 50 S subunit-dependent GTP hydrolysis, resulting in the dissociation of YlqF from assembled 50 S subunit. However, how the GTPase activity of YlqF is stimulated has not yet been explored.Regulation of the GTPase activity of translation factors such as EF-G, EF-Tu, and IF-2 plays an important role in the progression of each step of translation (25Zavialov A.V. Ehrenberg M. Cell. 2003; 114: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 26Rodnina M.V. Stark H. Savelsbergh A. Wieden H.J. Mohr D. Matassova N.B. Peske F. Daviter T. Gualerzi C.O. Wintermeyer W. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). For example, GTP-bound EF-Tu forms a ternary complex with aminoacyl-tRNA and the ribosome. When a matching codon is recognized, EF-Tu is converted back to the GDP form by ribosome-dependent GTP hydrolysis and releases aminoacyl-tRNA (26Rodnina M.V. Stark H. Savelsbergh A. Wieden H.J. Mohr D. Matassova N.B. Peske F. Daviter T. Gualerzi C.O. Wintermeyer W. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Therefore, elucidation of the regulation of GTPase activity of YlqF is central to understanding how YlqF assists in the organization of the 50 S subunit.We report here that an N-terminal deletion mutant of YlqF (YlqFΔN10) has a dominant-negative effect on the wild-type protein. The GTPase activity of YlqFΔN10 could not be activated by the 50 S subunit, so that the mutant protein could not dissociate from the premature 50 S subunit. Biogenesis of the 50 S subunit in YlqFΔN10-overexpressing cells stopped before the incorporation of ribosomal proteins L16 and L27, indicating that YlqFΔN10 can bind to the premature 50 S subunit but that it cannot assist in the reorganization of 50 S subunit for the incorporation of L16 and L27. Moreover, premature 50 S subunit from YlqFΔN10-overexpressing and YlqF-depleted cells greatly enhanced the GTPase activity of wild-type YlqF compared with mature 50 S subunit purified from 70 S ribosome particles. Unexpectedly, we also found that the free 50 S fraction separated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation caused a similar degree of YlqF GTPase activation as the premature subunits. Furthermore, we found that the mature 50 S subunit activates the GTPase activity of YlqF in low magnesium conditions. Based on these results, we propose a revised model of the role of YlqF in the biogenesis of the 50 S subunit.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains and Plasmids—Bacterial strains, plasmids, and primers used in this study are listed in Table 1. B. subtilis cells were grown in LB medium at 37 °C. When necessary, various concentrations of IPTG, xylose, and/or antibiotics (chloramphenicol and erythromycin at 10 and 0.5 μgml–1, respectively) were added to the cultures. Transformation of B. subtilis cells was performed as previously reported (27Moriya S. Tsujikawa E. Hassan A.K. Asai K. Kodama T. Ogasawara N. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). E. coli DH5α was used for plasmid construction and propagation. B. subtilis strains used in this study were derived from the wild-type strain 168. Strain YM01 (Pspac-ylqF) was constructed by transformation of strain 168 with the plasmid pTM208 (3Morimoto T. Loh P.C. Hirai T. Asai K. Kobayashi K. Moriya S. Ogasawara N. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3539-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) through a single-crossover recombination, resulting in the placement of the full-length ylqF gene behind the IPTG-inducible spac promoter (Pspac). YM02 (Pspac-ylqF, amyE::Pxyl-ylqF) and YM03 (Pspac-ylqF, amyE::Pxyl-ylqFΔN10) were constructed by transformation of strain YM101 with pYM01 and pYM02 plasmids, respectively, through double-crossover recombination. DNA fragments containing the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and the full-length ylqF gene (nucleotides 1–846) or the N-terminal-deleted ylqF gene (nucleotides 28–846) were amplified by PCR with primers 5′-AAAAAGCAGGCTCGAAAGGCGGTGTTCGTGTCAC-3′/5′-AGAAAGCTGGGTCTTACATCGTCGGCTGTTCAA-3′ and 5′-ATGGCAAAAGCAAGAAGG-3′/5′-AGAAAGCTGGGTCTTACATCGTCGGCTGTTCAA-3′, respectively. These PCR products were cloned downstream of the xylose-inducible xyl promoter (Pxyl) on the plasmid pX (28Kawai Y. Ogasawara N. Microbiology. 2006; 152: 1129-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) using Gateway technology (Invitrogen), creating pYM01 and pYM02, respectively. Plasmids pYM01 and pYM02 were transformed into strain YM01, and double-crossover recombination through amyE-up and amyE-down sequences flanking Pxyl and cat on pX resulted in the placement of Pxyl-ylqF or Pxyl-ylqFΔN10 into the amyE locus of the B. subtilis chromosome.TABLE 1Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this studyStrainRelevant genotypeSourceB. subtilis 168trpC2Pasteur stock YM01168 Pspac-ylqF ermThis work YM02168 Pspac-ylqF erm amyE::Pxyl-ylqF catThis work YM03168 Pspac-ylqF erm amyE::Pxyl-ylqFΔN10 catThis workE. coli DH5αsupE44 Δlacu169(ϕ80lacZΔM15) hsdR17 recA1 endA1 gylA96 thi-1 relA1Takara BL21(DE3)pLysSF- ompT hsdSB (rB-mB-) gal dcm Δ(srl-recA)306::Tn10(DE3)pLysSNovagenPlasmidVectorInsertSourcepTMO208(Ref. 3Morimoto T.

After the removal of cell debris by centrifugation, the supernatant was subjected to 15–45% sucrose density gradient centrifugation for 3 hat 285,000 × g. Sucrose gradients were separated into 20 fractions. During fractionation, the absorbance at 254 nm was monitored. YlqF or YlqFΔN10 in each fraction was separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% acrylamide gel and analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-YlqF antibody as described previously (24Matsuo Y. Morimoto T.

Wild-type 168 cells were grown at 37 °C in LB. Cells were collected at A600 = 0.6, and free 50 S ribosome was purified as described previously (24Matsuo Y. Morimoto T. Kuwano M. Loh P.C. Oshima T.

E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS derivatives (Novagen) containing pYM03 or pYM04 were grown at 30 °C in 500 ml LB, and the His6-tagged YlqF and YlqFΔN10 were purified according to the pET system protocol (Novagen) as described previously (24Matsuo Y.

The mixture was applied to a Microcon 100 (Millipore) and centrifuged for 5 min at 3000 × g. The column was washed 3 times with the same buffer by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 12 min. Buffer was added to the filter, and the column was inverted after a 1-min incubation at room temperature. The 50 S subunit-bound YlqF was recovered by centrifugation of the inverted column for 1 min at 3000 × g, and the concentration of YlqF and YlqFΔN10 was determined by immunoblotting with anti-YlqF antibodies.Assay of GTPase Activity—All GTPase activity assays were performed at 37 °C and contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NH4CH3CO2, 15mm Mg(CH3CO2)2, 100 μm [γ-32 P]GTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), YlqF, and 50 S ribosome subunit. The reactions were terminated by the addition of ice-cold water containing 6% charcoal. Next, charcoal was sedimented by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and the amount of free phosphate released by hydrolysis of [γ-32P]GTP was determined by Cerenkov counting of the supernatant.Assay of GTPγS Binding—YlqF or YlqFΔN10 (2.5 μm) were incubated for 10 min in buffer A at 30 °C with various concentrations of [35S]GTPγS (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Protein-bound [35S]GTPγS was collected onto nitrocellulose filters (0.45 μm; Millipore), and its radioactivity was measured with a scintillation counter.RESULTSN-terminal Deletion Mutant of YlqF Displays a Dominant-negative Phenotype—GTP-binding proteins have the characteristic amino acid sequence motifs G1 (G/AXXXXGKT/S), G3 (DXXG), and G4 (NKXD) in the GTP binding domain that are required for the hydrolysis and binding of GTP (1Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2660) Google Scholar). E. coli IF-2 G-motif mutants (V400G and H448E), which have a dominant-negative effect on growth, have been isolated (29Laalami S. Timofeev A.V. Putzer H. Leautey J. GrunbergManago M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The GTPase activity of these mutants is not stimulated by ribosome binding, and they remain bound to the ribosome after formation of 70 S initiation complex, demonstrating that GTP hydrolysis is coupled with its dissociation from the 70 S initiation complex and is important for translation initiation and the recycling of IF-2. YlqF also has the GTP binding domain including the G1, G3, and G4 motifs. To isolate a dominant negative mutant of YlqF, we changed several conserved amino acids in this domain to alanine by site-directed mutation (Fig. 1A), but this did not have a dominant-negative effect.The x-ray structure of YlqF (PDB code 1PUJ) shows that YlqF consists of an N-terminal GTP binding domain (codons 1–177) and a C-terminal YlqF-specific domain (codons 178–282). We aligned multiple amino acid sequences of YlqF from B. subtilis and its orthologs from other Gram-positive bacteria using ClustalW. We found a new highly conserved motif (residues 3–10; I(Q/N)W(F/Y)PGHM) in the N-terminal region (Fig. 1B). To examine whether this region (N10 region) is necessary for cell growth, we constructed a strain (YM103) in which the N-terminal deletion mutation of ylqF (ylqFΔN10) under the control of the xylose-inducible xyl promoter (Pxyl) was placed at the amyE locus and wild-type ylqF was placed under the control of the IPTG-inducible spac promoter (Pspac)atthe native position. YM03 (Pspac-ylqF, amyE::Pxyl-ylqFΔN10) grew on LB containing 25 μm IPTG but not on LB containing 2% xylose, indicating that YlqFΔN10 cannot support cell growth (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, these cells grew poorly on LB containing both IPTG and xylose. A control strain, YM02 (Pspac-ylqF, amyE::Pxyl-ylqF), was able to grow well in all conditions. These results indicated that YlqFΔN10 inhibited cell growth even in the presence of wild-type YlqF.Overexpression of YlqFΔN10 Induces Accumulation of Premature 50 S subunit, and YlqFΔN10 Stably Associates with the Premature 50 S Subunit—We next examined how YlqFΔN10 inhibits cell growth in the presence of wild-type YlqF. To investigate whether overexpression of YlqFΔN10 directly inhibited 50 S subunit biogenesis, we examined the ribosome profile of YlqFΔN10-overexpressing cells by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. YM02 and YM03 cells grown in LB containing 30 μm IPTG and 2% xylose were used as YlqF-overexpressing cells and YlqFΔN10-overexpressing cells, respectively. The level of YlqF increased about 7-fold in the YlqF-overexpressing cells, but their growth was normal compared with the control cells (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, in YlqFΔN10-overexpressing cells, the level of YlqFΔN10 increased about 10-fold, and their growth was significantly impaired.FIGURE 2Effect of overexpression of YlqFΔN10 on cell growth and the ribosome profile.

B, amounts of YlqF inYM02 cells and YlqFΔN10 in YM03 cells grown in LB containing 30 μm IPTG with or without 1% xylose. The amount of YlqF or YlqFΔN10 was determined in cells harvested at A600 = 0.6 by immunoblotting with an anti-YlqF antibody. C, ribosome profiles (panel 1) and the distribution of YlqF or YlqFΔN10 in their overproducing cells (panels 2–4). Ribosome profiles of control cells (dashed line; YM102 cells cultivated in the presence of IPTG only), YlqF-overexpressing cells (gray line; YM102 cells cultivated in the presence of IPTG and xylose) and YlqFΔN10-overexpressing cells (black line; YM103 cells cultivated in the presence of IPTG and xylose) are shown in panel 1. The cells were grown to the exponential phase, and cell lysates were sedimented through a 15–45% sucrose gradient at 285,000 × g for 3 h. During fractionation the absorbance at 254 nm was monitored. Sucrose gradients were separated into 20 fractions, and YlqF or YlqFΔN10 in each fraction was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-YlqF antibody (panel 2, YlqF in control cells; panel 3, YlqF in YlqF-overexpressing cells; panel 4, YlqFΔN10 in YlqFΔN10-overexpressing cells).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next, each of the cell cultures was collected during exponential phase (A600 = 0.6), and cell lysates were separated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The amount of YlqF or YlqFΔN10 in each fraction was determined by immunoblotting with an anti-YlqF antibody. In a previous report, we showed that YlqF co-fractionated with the free 50 S subunit in the presence of GTPγS but not in the presence of GTP or GDP (24Matsuo Y. Morimoto T. Kuwano M. Loh P.C.

In the present experiments guanine nucleotide was not added to the buffer. In YlqF-overexpressing cells, the ribosome profile was normal compared with control cells, and most YlqF was present in the top fraction of the gradient (Fig. 2C). In contrast, the ribosome profile in YlqFΔN10-overexpressing cells was drastically altered, including a decrease in the amount of 70 S ribosome and accumulation of premature 50 S subunit with a decreased molecular weight. Furthermore, strong bands, possibly corresponding to YlqFΔN10, appeared in the premature 50 S subunit fraction, above the background of wild-type YlqF signals (Fig. 2C). These results indicated that YlqFΔN10 remained bound to premature 50 S subunit and interfered with the biogenesis of 50 S subunit.YlqFΔN10 Lacks GTPase Activity and Stably Binds the 50 S Subunit in Vitro—We previous"
https://openalex.org/W2047255220,"Recent reports demonstrate that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, acts as a repressor of type I collagen synthesis. Our data demonstrate that exogenously expressed PPARγ down-regulates collagen expression in a dose-responsive manner in human lung fibroblast cells. Silencing PPARγ using lentiviruses expressing short hairpin RNAs partially reverses interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-induced repression and activates collagen mRNA levels. Previous studies indicate that IFN-γ represses collagen gene expression and induces major histocompatibility complex II (MHC II) expression by activating the formation of a regulatory factor for X-box 5 (RFX5) complex with class II transactivator (CIITA). This report demonstrates that PPARγ is within the RFX5·CIITA complex as judged by co-immunoprecipitation and DNA affinity precipitation studies. Most importantly, occupancy of PPARγ on the collagen transcription start site and MHC II promoter increases with IFN-γ treatment. The PPARγ agonist, troglitazone, sensitizes the cells to IFN-γ treatment by increasing recruitment of PPARγ to collagen gene while repressing collagen expression, and these effects are blocked by the PPARγ antagonist T0070907. PPARγ may mediate IFN-γ-stimulated collagen transcription down-regulation and MHC II up-regulation by interacting with CIITA as well as regulating CIITA expression. Therefore, PPARγ is a critical target for investigations into therapeutics of diseases involving extracellular matrix remodeling and the immune response.

Therefore, PPARγ is a critical target for investigations into therapeutics of diseases involving extracellular matrix remodeling and the immune response. The process of wound healing has been traditionally divided into several stages, including hemostasis, inflammation, cellular proliferation, and remodeling, when collagen is synthesized and fibers are deposited (1Diegelmann R.F. Evans M.C. Front. Biosci. 2004; 9: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar). These stages proceed by a series of overlapping, yet coordinated and highly regulated events highlighted by the interplay of cells, extracellular matrix, and an array of soluble mediators that are necessary to regenerate and remodel tissue. The extent of injury and the subsequent repair depend on the balanced control of matrix remodeling and inflammation. When this process is not regulated properly, there is either delayed healing with destruction of tissues or a fibroproliferative process with overproduction of collagen resulting in scarring, fibrosis, or cirrhosis depending on the organ.

Ligands such as fatty acids, eiconosanoids and oxidized lipids, have been identified that bind to PPARγ and alter its transcriptional activity. The thiazolidinediones class of drugs used in diabetes and dyslipidemias are synthetic ligands that activate PPARγ.

Alternatively, PPARγ may be directly involved in constitutive expression of collagen as part of transcriptional regulation complexes (17Yavrom S. Chen L. Xiong S. Wang J. Rippe R.A. Tsukamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40650-40659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Recent results suggest that PPARγ represses collagen transcription on the minimal COL1A1 promoter (17Yavrom S. Chen L. Xiong S. Wang J. Rippe R.A. Tsukamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40650-40659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Usually PPARγ heterodimerizes with retinoid-X-receptor and binds to a specific DNA response element with a direct repeat separated by a single intervening nucleotide (21Debril M.B. Renaud J.P. Fajas L. Auwerx J. J. Mol. Med. 2001; 79: 30-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). There are no PPARγ response elements in either collagen type I proximal promoter. On the other hand, PPARγ interacts with many proteins in different combinations to alter transcription of several other genes (4Glass C.K. Ogawa S. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that interferon-γ (IFN-γ), an important inflammatory cytokine, represses collagen transcription, in part, through the induction of regulatory factor for X box 5 (RFX5) complex proteins and Class II transactivator (CIITA), and their recruitment to the collagen transcription start site (22Xu Y.

RFX5 and CIITA are important activators of the immune response through transcriptional activation of major histocompatibility complex II (MHC II). In fact, mutations in these proteins cause bare lymphocyte syndrome. Because PPARγ may regulate a subset of IFN-γ target genes (25Welch J.S. Ricote M. Akiyama T.E. Gonzalez F.J. Glass C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6712-6717Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), we decided to investigate whether collagen was a target of PPARγ especially during IFN-γ treatment. In this report, we demonstrate that PPARγ is recruited to a complex with RFX5 and CIITA at the collagen transcription start site and the MHC II promoter during IFN-γ treatment. The IFN-γ-induced repression of collagen and activation of MHC II transcription is enhanced in the presence of PPARγ agonists and reversed by PPARγ antagonists. Finally, silencing PPARγ blocks the IFN-γ-induced collagen repression. Cell Culture Maintenance and Treatment Protocols—Human lung fibroblasts, IMR-90 (IMR, NJ), and human embryonic kidney cells 293FT (Invitrogen) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone) and 1% penicillin G-streptomycin (Sigma). In several studies IMR-90 cells were treated with IFN-γ (Roche Applied Science), troglitazone (Trog, Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA), and/or T0070907 (Biomol). IMR-90 fibroblasts were plated in p150 tissue culture dishes at 4 × 106 cells/dish or 6-well 35-mm culture dishes at 3 × 105 cells/dish, and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum for 16–24 h. Cells were pretreated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.4% fetal bovine serum for 16 h prior to IFN-γ treatment (100 units/ml), Trog treatment (5 μm), and/or T0070907 (1 μm) treatment. DNA Affinity Pulldown Assay—The collagen sequence (COL1A2–25/+30, GenBank™ accession number AF004877) with a HindIII overhang was synthesized as complementary strands and annealed as previously described (26Sengupta P.K. Erhlich M. Smith B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36649-36655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Double-stranded collagen DNA was biotin-labeled by incubating with Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) and biotin-14-dATP (Invitrogen) supplemented with regular dCTP, dTTP, and dGTP at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction mixture was phenol-chloroform-extracted and alcohol-precipitated to remove unincorporated biotin. Nuclear protein extracts from IMR-90 cells were obtained as previously described using 450 mm sodium chloride (22Xu Y. Wang L. Buttice G. Sengupta P.K. Smith B.D. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3912) Google Scholar). The streptavidin beads (Promega, Madison, WI) were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Nuclear proteins (100–200 μg) were pre-cleared by incubating with the washed beads for 30 min at 4 °C on a shaking platform as described previously (23Xu Y. Wang L. Buttice G. Sengupta P.K. Smith B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41319-41332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Pre-cleared nuclear proteins were prepared by capturing the beads on a magnetic stand and removing the supernatant. The supernatant was then incubated with biotin-labeled collagen DNA probe (–25/+30) for 1 h at room temperature in binding buffer (60 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EDTA, 4% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with bovine serum albumin, poly(dI-dC), and sonicated salmon sperm DNA to remove nonspecific binding. DNA·protein complex formed was captured by the magnetic beads and washed extensively with binding buffer supplemented with 0.01% Triton X and 100 mm KCl. The bound proteins were eluted with 1× electrophoresis sample buffer by incubating at 90 °C for 10 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE gels. Plasmids, Transfections, and Luciferase Assays—The col1a2-luciferase construct (pH20) (28Goldberg H. Helaakoski T. Garrett L.A. Karsenty G. Pellegrino A. Lozano G. Maity S. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol.

A larger col1a2-luciferase construct (pGL3-Col-Luc) containing sequences from –357 to +55 bp of mouse col1a2 promoter fused to the luciferase reporter gene was a gift from Dr. Jenny Ting (29Zhu X.S. Ting J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7078-7088Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The human COL1A1 promoter plasmids were all cloned into a pGL2-luciferase vector from the –804hCOL1-luc plasmid described previously (24Sengupta P. Xu Y. Wang L. Widom R. Smith B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21004-21014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Full-length PPARγ construct was generated as previously described (30Liu J. Wang H. Zuo Y. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 5827-5837Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Full-length FLAG-RFX5 and three different isoforms of FLAG-CIITA were kindly provided by Dr. Jenny Ting. Cells were plated at the density of 3 × 105 cells/well in 6-well tissue culture dishes (for IMR-90 cells) or 5 × 106 cells per p100 tissue culture dish (for 293FT cells). Transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were harvested 48 h post transfections, and luciferase assays were performed with a luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Immunoprecipitations—To investigate whether factors interact in vivo, co-immunoprecipitations were performed. Whole cell lysates (IMR-90 or 293FT with transfected constructs as indicated where applicable) were obtained by re-suspending cell pellets in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) with freshly added protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100 μg/ml RIPA). Anti-RFX5 (194, Rockland), anti-PPARγ (H-100 and E8, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or anti-CIITA (7–1H, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies were added to and incubated with IMR-90 cell lysate overnight before being absorbed by Protein A/G-plus agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Precipitated immune complex was released by boiling with 1× SDS-electrophoresis sample buffer. Alternatively, FLAG-conjugated beads (M2, Sigma) were added to and incubated with 293FT cell lysate overnight. Precipitated immune complex was eluted with 3× FLAG peptide (Sigma). Western Blots—Proteins were quantified with the BCA reagent (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and separated by 10% PAGE with pre-stained markers (Bio-Rad) for estimating molecular weight and efficiency of transfer to blots. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) in a Mini-Trans-Blot Cell (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked with 5% milk powder in Tris-buffered saline (TBST) (0.05% Tween 20, 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) buffer at 4 °C for several hours and incubated with monoclonal anti-FLAG (1:5000, Sigma), polyclonal anti-RFX5 (194, 1:1000, Rockland), monoclonal anti-CIITA (7–1H, 1:200) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), monoclonal anti-β-actin (1:5000, Sigma), or monoclonal anti-PPARγ (E8, 1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody overnight. After three washes with TBST, the membranes were incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies, either anti-goat IgG (Sigma), anti-mouse IgG, or anti-rabbit IgG (Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, for another hour at room temperature. Then protein blots were visualized using the Supersignal ECL reagent (Pierce) on a Kodak image station (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Chromatin in control and treated cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 8 min at room temperature, sequentially washed with phosphate-buffered saline, Solution I (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.75% Triton X-100), and Solution II (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA). Cells were incubated in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate) supplemented with protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. DNA was fragmented into ∼500 bp pieces using a Branson 250 sonicator. Aliquots of lysates containing 200 μg of protein were used for each immunoprecipitation reaction with anti-RFX5 (194, Rockland), anti-PPARγ (H-100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-CIITA (7–1 H, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-p300 (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies followed by adsorption to Protein A/G plus agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Precipitated DNA·protein complexes were washed sequentially with RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA), high salt buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA), LiCl buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 250 mm LiCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA), and TE buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), respectively. DNA·protein cross-linking was reversed by heating the samples to 65 °C overnight. Proteins were digested with proteinase K (Sigma), and DNA was phenolchloroform-extracted and precipitated by 100% ethanol. Dried DNA was dissolved in 50 μl of deionized distilled water, and 10 μl was used for each real-time PCR reaction. The primers surrounding the collagen start site for real-time PCR have been described previously (22Xu Y. Wang L. Buttice G. Sengupta P.K. Smith B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49134-49144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). RNA Isolation and Real-time PCR—Cells were harvested, and RNA was extracted using an RNeasy RNA isolation kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Reverse transcriptase reactions were performed using a SuperScript First-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Real-time PCR reactions were performed on an ABI-Prism 7700 sequence detection PCR machine (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The oligonucleotide forward and reverse PCR primers and fluorescent probes are described in previous studies (22Xu Y. Wang L. Buttice G. Sengupta P.K. Smith B.D. J. Biol.

Upon testing, two were determined to knock down PPARγ expression efficiently (clone #2 and clone #4, data not shown). These two clones, along with a non-functional clone (#5) as a control, were transfected into 293FT cells using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Viruses were harvested 48 h post-transfection and used to infect IMR-90 cells. 24 h after infection, IMR-90 cells were treated with 100 units/ml IFN-γ or left untreated for additional 48 h before harvesting. Proteins were extracted using RIPA buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE gel followed by Western blot. RNAs were extracted and analyzed as described before. Statistical Analysis—One-way analysis of variance with post-hoc Scheffe analyses were performed using an SPSS package. p values smaller than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. PPARγ Co-immunoprecipitates with RFX5 and CIITA IV—PPARγ represses COL1A1 gene transcription even on the minimal promoter (17Yavrom S. Chen L. Xiong S. Wang J. Rippe R.A. Tsukamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40650-40659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) raising the possibility that there might be an interaction between PPARγ and RFX5, because the latter binds to the collagen transcription start site and represses collagen synthesis (22Xu Y. Wang L. Buttice G. Sengupta P.K. Smith B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49134-49144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). First, protein extracts from cells transfected with FLAG-RFX5 were immunoprecipitated with a FLAG antibody (M2) or IgG antibody-conjugated beads. PPARγ was co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-RFX5 using specific epitope antibody but not control IgG (Fig. 1A). Next, proteins from human lung fibroblasts were immunoprecipitated by anti-RFX5 antibodies to examine endogenous PPARγ interactions with RFX5. PPARγ was co-immunoprecipitated with RFX5 (Fig. 1B). The secondary anti-rabbit IgG reacts with a nonspecific band in the nonimmune control and the RFX5 serum. In the reciprocal experiment, RFX5 was co-immunoprecipitated using two different sources of PPARγ antibody (Fig. 1C) suggesting that PPARγ and RFX5 are in a similar complex. CIITA is difficult to detect in un-stimulated mesenchymal cells. Yet, CIITA is largely responsible for the IFN-γ-induced repression of collagen transcription, because IFN-γ treatment stimulates CIITA expression, nuclear localization, and occupation on the collagen start site (23Xu Y. Wang L. Buttice G. Sengupta P.K. Smith B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41319-41332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Most importantly, silencing CIITA blocks IFN-γ-induced collagen repression (23Xu Y. Wang L. Buttice G. Sengupta P.K. Smith B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41319-41332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Two isoforms, CIITA III and CIITA IV, are inducible by IFN-γ in human smooth muscle cells (32Butticè G. Miller J. Wang L. Smith B.D. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 472-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and fibroblasts (data not shown). To determine whether individual isoforms might co-immunoprecipitate with PPARγ, these two isoforms were overexpressed in 293FT cells and immunoprecipitated with epitope-specific antibody (M2). PPARγ was co-immunoprecipitated with CIITA IV isoform, but not with CIITA III isoforms (Fig. 2A). Experiments were also performed with CIITA I, which was not expressed in these cells as CIITA III or IV. There was no detectable association of CIITA I with PPARγ (data not shown). To examine endogenous interactions, human lung fibroblasts were treated with IFN-γ and proteins were immunoprecipitated with either an anti-CIITA or an anti-PPARγ antibody. CIITA was detected in IFN-γ-treated extracts along with PPARγ using CIITA antibody that recognizes all CIITA isoforms (Fig. 2B). In a reciprocal experiment with PPARγ antibody, CIITA was co-immunoprecipitated only from IFN-γ-treated extracts (Fig. 2C) suggesting that when CIITA is expressed it interacts with PPARγ in the same complex. PPARγ Represses Collagen Promoter Activity in a Dose-responsive Manner and Enhances CIITA IV Transcription Activity—PPARγ suppresses COL1A1 proximal promoter activity in activated hepatic stellate cells (17Yavrom S. Chen L. Xiong S. Wang J. Rippe R.A. Tsukamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40650-40659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In dermal fibroblasts, PPARγ transient transfection had a small inhibitory effect on COL1A2 activity (16Ghosh A.K. Bhattacharyya S. Lakos G. Chen S.J. Mori Y. Varga J. Arthritis Rheum. 2004; 50: 1305-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that col1a2 promoter activity is repressed by increasing amounts of PPARγ expression in human lung fibroblasts (Fig. 3A). Because PPARγ interacts with RFX5 and CIITA, we addressed whether RFX5 or the isoforms of CIITA might function to repress collagen promoter activity in an additive fashion with PPARγ. PPARγ (0.1 μg) enhanced the repression of col1a2 promoter activity most prominently with CIITA IV (Fig. 3B). This exact pattern was observed using a larger promoter of col1a2 (data not shown) and COL1A1 (Fig. 3C). The collagen genes have RFX5·CIITA binding sites at the transcription start site within a potential initiator site not in the promoter. Mutations in this region may block transcription as well as blocking RFX binding, so using mutations as a method to determine whether PPARγ-dependent transcription is mediated through the RFX5 binding site was not performed. Most importantly, CIITA IV in combination with PPARγ was the best activator of the MHC II promoter (Fig. 3D) as well as the best repressing combination for collagen promoter activity. Because CIITA IV is the isoform that co-immunoprecipitates with PPARγ, CIITA may function with PPARγ to both repress collagen and activate MHC II transcription. PPARγ Agonists Enhance the IFN-γ-induced Repression of Collagen—PPARγ agonists disrupt TGF-β signaling in normal human dermal fibroblasts (16Ghosh A.K. Bhattacharyya S. Lakos G. Chen S.J. Mori Y. Varga J. Arthritis Rheum. 2004; 50: 1305-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and in pulmonary myofibroblasts (19Burgess H.A. Daugherty L.E. Thatcher T.H. Lakatos H.F. Ray D.M. Redonnet M. Phipps R.P. Sime P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: L1146-L1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Because IFN-γ induces CIITA expression and abrogates TGF-β activity, we next used the agonist, Trog (0.5 μm), in the presence or absence of IFN-γ. Without exogenously added PPARγ, Trog had minimal affect on collagen promoter activity (Fig. 4, A and B). However, Trog enhanced IFN-γ-induced collagen repression for all collagen type I promoters tested. To determine if the agonist effect was through PPARγ, cells were pretreated with the antagonist T0070907 for 2 h before IFN-γ and/or Trog treatment. The antagonist blocked the action of Trog on all collagen promoters in the presence of IFN-γ suggesting there is a PPARγ effect (Fig. 4, A and B). Interestingly, without IFN-γ treatment the antagonist activated collagen promoter activity in the smaller (Fig. 4A) but not the larger col1a2 promoter (Fig. 4B). All collagen promoter activity changes were similar with a second an"
https://openalex.org/W1965566942,"Bone resorption by osteoclasts is necessary to maintain bone homeostasis. Osteoclast differentiation from hematopoietic progenitors and their activation depend on M-CSF and RANKL, but also requires co-stimulatory signals acting through receptors associated with DAP12 and FcRγ adaptors. Dap12 mutant mice (KΔ75) are osteopetrotic due to inactive osteoclasts but, surprisingly, these mice are more sensitive than WT mice to bone loss following an ovariectomy. Because estrogen withdrawal is known to disturb bone mass, at least in part, through lymphocyte interaction, we looked at the role of mature lymphocytes on osteoclastogenesis and bone mass in the absence of functional DAP12. Lymphocytes were found to stimulate an early osteoclast differentiation response from Dap12-deficient progenitors in vitro. In vivo, Rag1-/- mice lacking mature lymphocytes did not exhibit any bone phenotype, but lost their bone mass after ovariectomy like KΔ75 mice. KΔ75;Rag1-/- double mutant female mice exhibited a more severe osteopetrosis than Dap12-deficient animals but lost their bone mass after ovariectomy, like single mutants. These results suggest that both DAP12 and mature lymphocytes act synergistically to maintain bone mass under physiological conditions, while playing similar but not synergistic co-stimulatory roles in protecting bone loss after gonadal failure. Thus, our data support a role for lymphocytes during osteoclast differentiation and suggest that they may function as accessory cells when regular osteoclast function is compromised."
https://openalex.org/W2049355403,"Kinase suppressor of Ras 1 (KSR1) is a protein scaffold that facilitates ERK cascade activation at the plasma membrane, a critical step in the signal transduction process that allows cells to respond to survival, proliferative, and differentiative cues. Here, we report that KSR1 undergoes caspase-dependent cleavage in apoptotic cells and that cleavage destroys the scaffolding function of the full-length KSR1 protein and generates a stable C-terminal fragment that can inhibit ERK activation. KSR1 is cleaved in response to multiple apoptotic stimuli and occurs in vivo during the involution of mouse mammary tissues, a morphogenic process requiring cellular apoptosis. In addition, we find that in comparison with KSR1-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts expressing wild type KSR1 (WT-KSR1), cells expressing a cleavage-resistant KSR1 protein (DEVA-KSR1) exhibit reduced apoptotic signaling in response to tumor necrosis factor-α/cycloheximide treatment. The effect of DEVA-KSR1 expression was found to correlate with increased levels of active phosphoERK and could be significantly reversed by treating cells with the MEK inhibitor U0126. In contrast, reduced phosphoERK levels and enhanced apoptotic signaling were observed in cells constitutively expressing the C-terminal KSR1 fragment (CTF-KSR1). Moreover, we find that cleavage of WT-KSR1 correlates with a dramatic reduction in active phosphoERK levels. These findings identify KSR1 as a caspase target and suggest that cleavage of the KSR1 scaffold represents another mechanism whereby caspases down-regulate ERK survival signaling to promote cellular apoptosis.

These findings identify KSR1 as a caspase target and suggest that cleavage of the KSR1 scaffold represents another mechanism whereby caspases down-regulate ERK survival signaling to promote cellular apoptosis. Death by apoptosis is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism whereby diseased, damaged, or unwanted cells are eliminated from an organism. A hallmark feature of apoptosis is the activation of aspartate-directed, cysteinyl proteases known collectively as caspases (1Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6156) Google Scholar). These enzymes can be broadly divided into two groups: the initiator caspases (caspase-2, -8, -9, -10), which mediate the activation of downstream caspases, and the effector caspases (caspase-3, -6, -7), which cleave cellular proteins to induce biological and morphological changes that ultimately result in cell death (2Fischer U. Janicke R.U. Schulze-Osthoff K. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 76-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). In mammals, caspase activation and apoptosis can be triggered either through the engagement of cell surface death receptors (known as the extrinsic death receptor pathway) or by the release of apoptogenic factors from mitochondria (known as the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway) (3Khosravi-Far R. Esposti M.D. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2004; 3: 1051-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 4Riedl S.J. Shi Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar). Apoptosis plays an important role in essential biological processes such as embryogenesis, tissue remodeling, and the immune response, and its deregulation has been linked with a variety of human pathologies including cancer, myocardial ischemia, and neurodegenerative diseases (5Strasser A. O'Connor L. Dixit V.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 217-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar, 6Vaux D.L. Korsmeyer S.J.

In addition, many cancer chemotherapies activate the apoptotic machinery to prevent tumor growth, whereas inhibition of the apoptotic response contributes to the emergence of chemoresistance (8Vermeulen K. Van Bockstaele D.R. Berneman Z.N. Ann. Hematol. 2005; 84: 627-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 9Kabore A.F. Johnston J.B. Gibson S.B. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2004; 4: 147-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, the regulation of apoptosis is critical for ensuring the homeostasis of an organism. As such, the cell has derived various mechanisms to precisely control the balance between survival and apoptotic signaling. For example, caspases not only cleave and activate substrates that contribute to the apoptotic process (e.g. caspases themselves, Bid, MEKK1), they can also cleave certain signaling proteins (e.g. Raf, lamin, focal adhesion kinase) and inactivate their function in cell survival (2Fischer U. Janicke R.U. Schulze-Osthoff K. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 76-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar, 10Widmann C. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7141-7147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). In addition, phosphorylation of specific targets (e.g. Rsk, Elk-1) by prosurvival kinases can promote cell survival, whereas the phosphorylation of other targets (e.g. BAD and caspase-9) can inhibit apoptosis (11Lawlor M.A. Alessi D.R. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2903-2910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Yoon S. Seger R. Growth Factors. 2006; 24: 21-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Seger R. Growth Factors. 2006; 24: 21-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This three-tiered kinase cascade functions downstream of the RasGTPase and is composed of the Raf, MEK, and ERK kinases (13Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers Gibson T. Xu B.E. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3543) Google Scholar, 14Roux P.P. Blenis J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 320-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1927) Google Scholar). Although signal transmission between these kinases is mediated via direct phosphorylation, recent studies have demonstrated the importance of scaffolding proteins in regulating the timing, location, strength, and duration of ERK cascade signaling (15Kolch W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 827-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar, 16Morrison D.K. Davis R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

One such scaffold, kinase suppressor of Ras 1 (KSR1), associates with all the core kinase components of the ERK cascade and is a conserved positive regulator of Ras/ERK signaling (17Morrison D.K. J.

At the membrane, KSR1 coordinates the assembly of a multiprotein complex that colocalizes MEK with its upstream activator Raf and downstream substrate ERK, thus facilitating the phosphorylation reactions required for ERK activation (23Yu W.

Here, we report that KSR1 undergoes caspase-dependent cleavage in apoptotic cells and that cleavage destroys the ability of KSR1 to promote ERK survival signaling. KSR1 is cleaved in response to multiple apoptotic stimuli, and cleavage of endogenous KSR1 is observed in an in vivo apoptotic model system, involuting mouse mammary tissue. Cleavage of KSR1 destroys its ERK scaffolding potential, results in the generation of a stable C-terminal fragment that can inhibit ERK signaling, and correlates with a pronounced reduction in active phosphoERK levels. In addition, we find that in comparison with KSR1-/- MEFs expressing WT-KSR1, cells expressing a cleavage-resistant KSR1 protein (DEVA-KSR1) have elevated phosphoERK levels and reduced apoptotic signaling following TNFα/CHX treatment, whereas cells constitutively expressing the C-terminal KSR1 fragment exhibit increased apoptotic signaling and reduced basal phosphoERK levels. Moreover, the effects of DEVA-KSR1 expression can be significantly reversed by treatment of cells with the MEK inhibitor U0126. From these data, we conclude that alterations in the scaffolding activity of KSR1 can negatively impact ERK survival signaling to facilitate the apoptotic process. Antibodies and Reagents—Antibodies recognizing caspase-3 (clone 46), Bid (clone 40), MEK1 (clone 25), and cytochrome c (clone 6H2.B4) were obtained from BD Biosciences, antibodies to caspase-9 (clone C9), caspase-8 (mouse-specific), and phosphoERK were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA), and antibodies to actin, ERK1/2 (C-14), and KSR1 (C-19 and M-18) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The Pyo epitope tag antibody has been previously described (28Therrien M. Michaud N.R. Rubin G.M. Morrison D.K. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2684-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), and antibodies recognizing either the N-terminal or the C-terminal domains of KSR1 were generated against amino acids 118–248 or 847–861 of murine KSR1, respectively. KSR1 Constructs and Generation of Stable Cell Lines—Pyo-tagged WT-KSR1 has been previously described (29Cacace A.M. Michaud N.R. Therrien M. Mathes K. Copeland T. Rubin G.M. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), DEVA (D529A)-KSR1 was generated by site-directed mutagenesis, and CTF-KSR1 (encoding amino acids 530–873) was generated by PCR amplification. Sequences encoding the KSR1 proteins were subcloned into the pBabe-puro retroviral vector, and stable cell lines were generated by puromycin selection (2.5 μg/ml) of KSR1-/- MEFs (a kind gift from Dr. Robert Lewis, Eppley Cancer Center, Omaha, NE) (18Kortum R.L. Lewis R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4407-4416Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) infected with recombinant retroviruses. Induction of Apoptosis—Apoptosis was induced by serum starvation or treatment with 1 μm staurosporine (EMD Biosciences, La Jolla, CA) or 10 ng/ml murine TNFα (Invitrogen) and 1 μg/ml CHX (Sigma-Aldrich) for the indicated times. In some experiments, cells were treated with 100 μm z-VAD-fmk (Bachem, Torrance, CA) or 10 μm U0126 (Cell Signaling Technology) for 30–60 min prior to and then during stimulation with TNFα/CHX. Cells were then harvested (including those in the medium), washed with PBS, and either examined directly by FACS analysis or lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.15 units/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μm leupeptin, 5 mm sodium vanadate) for immunoblot analysis or lysed in CHAPS buffer (0.1% CHAPS, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.15 units/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μm leupeptin in PBS, pH 7.4) for caspase activity assays. Caspase Activity Assays and in Vitro Caspase Cleavage Assays—For in vivo caspase activity assays, crude lysate (∼100 μg of protein) was incubated with Ac-DEVD-pNA (200 μm final concentration, BIOMOL, Plymouth Meeting, PA), and the rate of pNA release was determined by plotting the change in absorbance at 405 nm over time. For in vitro caspase-cleavage assays, Pyo-tagged KSR1 proteins that had been affinity-purified from 293T cells as described previously (25Muller J. Ory S. Copeland T. Piwnica-Worms H. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 983-993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) were incubated with 200 units of recombinant caspase-3 or caspase-8 (BIOMOL) in caspase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mm dithiothreitol) for 1 h at 30 °C, following which the samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting. The activities of recombinant caspase-3 and caspase-8 were confirmed by measuring the rate of pNA release from Ac-DEVD-pNA or Ac-IETD-pNA substrates (200 μm final concentration), respectively. FACS Analysis—Cellular levels of active caspase-3 or H2A.X phosphorylation were determined by flow cytometry using the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated monoclonal active caspase-3 apoptosis kit I (BD Biosciences) and the H2A.X phosphorylation assay kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA), respectively. Flow cytometry was also used to examine cells for annexin V staining using the Vybrant apoptosis assay kit 11 (Invitrogen) and for TUNEL staining using the Apo-direct kit (BD Biosciences). Data were collected using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using Cell Quest Software. Cytochrome c Release—MEFs were treated with TNFα/CHX, harvested, washed with PBS, and permeabilized for 5 min in PBS containing 100 μg/ml digitonin and 100 mm KCl (Note: control cells were incubated in PBS alone). All cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature and washed twice with PBS. Cells were incubated in blocking buffer (3% bovine serum albumin + 0.05% saponin in PBS) for 1 h with rocking followed by incubation overnight at 4 °C with anti-cytochrome c antibodies at 1:200 with shaking. Cells were washed once with blocking buffer and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) at 1:200 for 1 h. Cells were washed once with blocking buffer and PBS, following which they were subjected to FACS analysis. For immunofluorescence, cells were grown on glass coverslips, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, and stained for cytochrome c as described for FACS analysis except that washes were increased to three times per step. Cells were also stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (300 nm in PBS for 5 min) prior to mounting in Prolong Gold antifade solution (Invitrogen). Analysis of Endogenous KSR1 Cleavage in Involuting Mouse Mammary Tissue and KSR+/+MEFs—For mammary tissue isolation, pups were removed from female C57BL/6 mice on day 7 of lactation, and the mammary glands of the females were then harvested on day 0 and day 3 following removal of pups. Tissue lysates were prepared as described previously (30Thangaraju M. Rudelius M. Bierie B. Raffeld M. Sharan S. Hennighausen L. Huang A.M. Sterneck E. Development (Camb.). 2005; 132: 4675-4685Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). KSR1+/+ MEFs were lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer following treatment with TNFα/CHX for 6 h. Endogenous KSR1 proteins were immunoprecipitated using antibodies recognizing either the KSR1 N terminus or the KSR1 C terminus and examined by immunoblot analysis. KSR1 Is Cleaved in Apoptotic Cells—The caspase-dependent cleavage of anti-apoptotic/pro-survival signaling molecules is an important mechanism for facilitating the onset of apoptosis. Within their substrates, caspases recognize a core tetrapeptide motif (P4P3P2P1) that contains an essential aspartic acid residue required for the cleavage reaction at position P1 (31Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol.

One well defined substrate recognition motif for effector caspases is the sequence DEXD (32Thornberry N.A. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 100-110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and analysis of the KSR1 protein sequence indicates that KSR1 contains a putative caspase cleavage site (DEVD) at amino acid residues 526–529 (Fig. 1A). Significantly, cleavage at the DEVD site would be expected to destroy the ERK scaffolding activity of KSR1 in that cleavage would separate the C-terminal region, which mediates MEK binding, from the N-terminal region, which contains the ERK binding site and the C1 domain required for plasma membrane localization. Therefore, to investigate whether KSR1 is a caspase target, we examined the electrophoretic mobility of KSR1 in cells undergoing apoptosis. For this study, KSR1-/- MEFs stably expressing Pyo-tagged WT-KSR1 (WT-KSR1 MEFs) were subjected to various conditions known to induce apoptosis, including staurosporine treatment, serum starvation, and stimulation with TNFα in the presence of cycloheximide. (Note that because TNFα has been shown to promote survival signaling through activation of the NFκB transcription factor, cycloheximide was added to prevent the synthesis of any protein with anti-apoptotic activity that might be induced as a result of NFκB activation) (33Wajant H. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 45-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1894) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were then prepared and examined by immunoblot analysis using various KSR1 antibodies and an antibody recognizing the pro- and cleaved forms of caspase-3. As shown in Fig. 1B, the appearance of the cleaved/activated form of caspase-3 confirmed that serum starvation or treatment with either staurosporine or TNFα/CHX for 6 h were all capable of inducing apoptotic signaling, although the extent of caspase-3 cleavage did vary. Under these apoptotic conditions, a reduction in the level of full-length KSR1 was observed, as was the appearance of a 42-kDa protein recognized by an antibody directed against the C terminus of KSR1 (Fig. 1B). In addition, only treatment with TNFα in combination with CHX was able to induce apoptotic signaling and the appearance of the 42-kDa protein recognized by the KSR1 C-terminal antibody (Fig. 1C). The molecular weight of this protein is consistent with the predicted size of the C-terminal fragment that would be generated if KSR1 were cleaved at the DEVD site. The 42-kDa protein was not observed in lysates of non-apoptotic cells (untreated or Me2SO-treated, Fig. 1B; CHX alone-treated or TNFα alone-treated, Fig. 1C), and its appearance correlated with the reduction in full-length KSR1, as well as the degree of apoptosis observed in cells (Fig. 1, B and C, and data not shown). Interestingly, using antibodies recognizing various N-terminal regions of KSR1, no stable accumulation of an N-terminal fragment was detected (Fig. 1B and data not shown). Finally, to confirm that cleavage of KSR1 was biologically relevant and not a unique property of the Pyo-tagged WT-KSR1 protein, the cleavage of endogenous KSR1 was examined in KSR1+/+ MEFs. As shown in Fig. 1D, a reduction in the level of full-length endogenous KSR1 was observed in cells treated with TNFα/CHX, as was the appearance of the 42-kDa C-terminal fragment (CTF). Given that TNFα/CHX treatment efficiently induced apoptosis and KSR1 cleavage in the WT-KSR1 MEFs, these conditions were used as the apoptotic inducer in subsequent experiments. TNFα is known to activate the extrinsic death receptor pathway by binding to the TNF1 receptor, thus inducing the cleavage and activation of caspase-8, which in turn cleaves and activates the effector caspase-3 (33Wajant H. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 45-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1894) Google Scholar). In many cell types, however, the ability of the extrinsic death receptor pathway to activate caspase-3 and induce apoptosis is amplified by engaging the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway (34Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3787) Google Scholar, 35Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3078) Google Scholar). Under these circumstances, caspase-8 mediated cleavage of Bid, a Bcl2 family member, promotes cytochrome c release from mitochondria, thereby trigging the cleavage and activation of caspase-9, an initiator caspase that can also cleave and activate caspase-3 (Fig. 2A). To further characterize the apoptotic pathways induced by TNFα/CHX in the WT-KSR1 MEFs, cells treated with TNFα/CHX for a time course of 0–6 h were examined by immunoblot analysis for the cleavage/activation of various apoptosis effectors. As indicated in Fig. 2B, either by the loss of the full-length protein or by the appearance of a cleaved fragment, TNFα/CHX treatment induced the cleavage of caspase-8, Bid, caspase-9, and caspase-3, demonstrating that both the extrinsic and the intrinsic apoptotic pathways were activated. Cytochrome c release was also observed in TNFα/CHX cells, and its release could be blocked by the general caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk, consistent with the model that cytochrome c release is induced by the caspase-8-mediated cleavage of Bid (Fig. 2C). Moreover, the WT-KSR1 MEFs exhibited multiple markers of cellular apoptosis following TNFα/CHX treatment, including exposure of phosphatidylserine on the cell surface (as determined by annexin V staining, Fig. 2D), double-strand DNA breaks (as determined by TUNEL staining, Fig. 2E and Ser-139 phosphorylation of histone H2A.X (36Rogakou E.P.

However, to confirm that KSR1 cleavage does require caspase activity, cells were treated with the general caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk prior to and during TNFα/CHX stimulation. As shown in Fig. 3, z-VAD-fmk inhibited the TNFα/CHX-induced cleavage of caspase-3 (panel A), as well as the induction of DEVD-directed caspase activity (panel B) and the detection of cells containing active caspase-3 (panel C). Moreover, z-VAD-fmk completely blocked the cleavage of KSR1 induced by TNFα/CHX treatment (Fig. 3A). Caspase-dependent Cleavage of KSR1 Occurs at the DEVD Motif—The above findings implicate KSR1 as a caspase target. To determine whether KSR1 cleavage is indeed caspase-mediated and to confirm that cleavage occurs at the DEVD motif, we first generated a KSR1 mutant in which the aspartic acid residue (Asp-529) predicted to be required for caspase cleavage was mutated to alanine (DEVA-KSR1). This construct was then stably expressed in the KSR1-/- MEFs and the effects of TNFα/CHX treatment on WT- and DEVA-KSR1-expressing cells were compared. As shown in Fig. 4A, although TNFα/CHX treatment induced the time-dependent cleavage of WT-KSR1, the levels of full-length DEVA-KSR1 remained constant, and no CTF was observed. Thus, the D529A mutation blocks the generation of the 42-kDa CTF, identifying the DEVD sequence as the site of KSR1 cleavage in apoptotic cells. Because the DEVD sequence is a known recognition motif for the effector caspase-3 (32Thornberry N.A. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 100-110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we next examined whether WT- or DEVA-KSR1 could be cleaved by caspase-3 in vitro. F"

We examined the effects of ligands specific to α-helix F (αHF) of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) on the stoichiometry of inhibition (SI) and limiting rate constant (klim) of RCL insertion for reactions with β-trypsin, tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), and urokinase.

In contrast to SMBD, monoclonal antibodies MA-55F4C12 and MA-33H1F7, the epitopes of which are located at the opposite side of αHF, decreased klim and increased SI for every enzyme. These effects were enhanced in the presence of SMBD. RCL insertion for β-trypsin and tPA is limited by different subsequent steps of PAI-1 mechanism as follows: enzyme acylation and formation of a loop-displaced acyl complex (LDA), respectively. Stabilization of LDA through the disruption of the exosite interactions between PAI-1 and tPA induced an increase in the klim but did not affect the SI. Thus it is unlikely that LDA contributes significantly to the outcome of the serpin reaction. These results demonstrate that the rate of RCL insertion is not necessarily correlated with SI and indicate that an intermediate, different from LDA, which forms during the late steps of PAI-1 mechanism, and could be stabilized by ligands specific to αHF, controls bifurcation between the inhibitory and the substrate pathways.

The formation of a loop-displaced acyl complex (LDA (E-I′; Scheme 1)) was proposed as a limiting step for the reaction between PAI-1 and tPA (31Olson S.T. Swanson R. Day D. Verhamme I. Kvassman J. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11742-11756Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Because LDA forms prior to RCL insertion, enzyme translocation requires disruption of exosite interactions at the PAI-1/tPA interface and dissociation of the primed part of cleaved RCL from the active site of the enzyme (31Olson S.T. Swanson R. Day D. Verhamme I. Kvassman J. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11742-11756Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In contrast to tPA, β-trypsin lacks exosite interactions with PAI-1. As a result, the rate of RCL insertion for the reaction of PAI-1 with β-trypsin is limited by formation of the acyl-enzyme E∼I (31Olson S.T. Swanson R. Day D. Verhamme I. Kvassman J. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11742-11756Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Thus, because of the lack of exosite interactions at the proteinase/serpin interface, the limiting rate of RCL insertion (klim) for the reaction of PAI-1 with β-trypsin is 30 times higher than that for tPA. The substrate pathway (Scheme 1), where proteinase completes the normal catalytic cycle and the hydrolysis of the acylenzyme results in an inactive cleaved PAI-1 with inserted RCL (I*), is an alternative to the inhibitory reaction. The stoichiometry of inhibition (SI = 1 + ks/ki; the number of moles of PAI-1 required for inactivation of 1 mol of proteinase) quantitatively expresses the distribution between the inhibitory and the substrate pathways (Scheme 1) (37Chaillan-Huntington C.E.

On the other hand, the binding of Vn results in an increase in both the rate and SI for the reaction of PAI-1 with thrombin (43van Meijer M. Stoop A. Smilde A. Preissner K.T. van Zonneveld A.J.

Moreover, Vn dramatically enhances the fraction of the substrate reaction between tPA or uPA and complexes of PAI-1 with mAbs (MA-55F4C12, mAb-2) directed against αHF (44Wind T.

Therefore, the binding of Vn and anti-αHF mAbs to PAI-1 affects steps of the serpin mechanism, which contribute to distribution between substrate and inhibitory reactions. To the best of our knowledge the contribution of the 44-amino acid N-terminal SMBD to the effects of Vn on the PAI-1 mechanism has not been studied thus far. To address this question, we have evaluated the effects of recombinant SMBD on the kinetics of RCL insertion and stoichiometry of the reaction of uPA and tPA with PAI-1 or its complex with anti-αHF mAb MA-55F4C12, and compared the results with the data obtained previously for the whole Vn isolated from human plasma (45Komissarov A.A.

According to the Scheme 1, bifurcation between inhibitory and substrate pathways is controlled by LDA; however, disruption of the pattern of the exosite interactions at the PAI-1/tPA interface, which changes significantly klim for the reaction of PAI-1 with tPA, does not affect SI (31Olson S.T.

Therefore, a step of the serpin mechanism, which is likely different from stabilization/destabilization of LDA, contributes to the outcome of PAI-1 reaction. Effects of ligands, with opposite binding sites relative to αHF (recombinant SMBD and anti-αHF mAbs MA-55F4C12 and MA-33H1F7) (52Seiffert D. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol.

Because RCL insertion for the reactions of PAI-1 with tPA and β-trypsin is limited by different steps of the mechanism (31Olson S.T. Swanson R. Day D. Verhamme I. Kvassman J. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11742-11756Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), the effects of mAbs and SMBD on the kinetics and outcome of the reactions with these enzymes were measured and compared. Finally, the possible contribution of the exosite interactions to the effects of the ligands was evaluated. SI values for the reactions of a mutant variant of PAI-1 (glutamate to alanine mutations at the positions 4′ and 5′ of the RCL) with tPA and β-trypsin were measured and compared with the data obtained for wtPAI-1. The results obtained in this study strongly support the major contribution of the SMBD to the effects of Vn on the PAI-1/proteinase reaction and indicate formation of a new transition intermediate (αHF intermediate), which appears at the late steps of the serpin mechanism and probably controls bifurcation between the inhibitory and substrate pathways of the reaction. Proteins and Reagents—Bovine trypsin and analytical grade buffer reagents were from Sigma. Human plasma Vn was from Promega (Madison, WI). SMBD was obtained and characterized as described previously (53Zhou A. Huntington J.A. Pannu N.S. Carrell R.W. Read R.J. Nat. Struct.

The activity of PAI-1 was determined by titrating the inhibitor with proteinase. Concentrations of wtPAI-1 were calculated from absorbance at 280 nm, using an extinction coefficient (ϵ280) of 0.93 ml mg-1 cm-1 and an Mr of 43,000 (55Vaughan D.E. Declerck P.J. Reilly T.M. Park K.

Human recombinant tPA (activase) and uPA were provided by Genentech (San Francisco, CA) and by Abbott, respectively. Two-chain tPA was obtained from the single-chain enzyme by treatment with immobilized plasmin (56Kvassman J.O. Shore J.D. Fibrinolysis. 1995; 9: 215-221Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Mouse mAbs MA-55F4C12 and MA-33H1F7 were selected from the panel raised against the human PAI-1-tPA complex (57Debrock S. Declerck P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1337: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The concentrations of tPA, uPA, and mAbs were calculated from absorbance values at 280 nm, using Mr values of 63,500, 54,000, and 150,000, and ϵ280 of 1.90, 1.36, and 1.3 ml mg-1 cm-1, respectively. All experiments were performed using a 0.05 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4 or 6.2). Effects of SMBD on Kinetics of RCL Insertion Because of the Reaction of Proteinases with NBD P9 PAI-1 and Its Complexes with mAbs—Stopped flow fluorimetry was employed to examine the effects of SMBD on the rate of RCL insertion because of the reaction between proteinases and NBD P9 PAI-1 (10–20 nm) or its complexes with mAbs (45Komissarov A.A.

Briefly, SMBD (30–80 nm) was added either to NBD P9 PAI-1 (15–30 nm) or to its preformed complex with mAb (1.5–2.0-fold molar excess over NBD P9 PAI-1) at least 10 min prior to data collection. Traces of changes in NBD fluorescence emission because of the reaction with proteinase were measured. Measurements were carried out in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 25 °C. The data were analyzed using SigmaPlot 8.0 (SPSS Inc.) for Windows employing the nonlinear least squares Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. Changes in NBD fluorescence emission (excitation at 480 nm, detection through 500 nm cutoff filter) with time were measured. A single exponential equation (Ft = A + B(1 - e-kobst), where Ft is fluorescence emission at t seconds; A is the fluorescence at t = 0; B is the amplitude of the fluorescence change, and kobs is the observed first-order rate constant) was fit to the data using either KinAssist (Hi-Tech Scientific) or SigmaPlot 8.0 software. The quality of the fit was estimated by visual analysis of plots of the residuals (deviation of the fitted function from the data). The values of kobs (average of 5–10 measurements; standard error (S.E.) less than 10%) were measured at concentration of proteinase at least 5-fold higher than that of NBD P9 PAI-1 or its complexes. The values of kobs obtained at different concentrations of uPA, tPA or β-trypsin were plotted against proteinase concentration using SigmaPlot 8.0, and plots were fit by a hyperbolic equation kobs = klim × [E]/(Km + [E]); klim is the limiting rate constant of RCL insertion, and Km is the proteinase concentration ([E]) at half-saturation (kobs = klim/2). Correlation coefficients (r2) were used to estimate goodness of fitting (r2 were ≥0.98 for all the data). Effects of SMBD on Stoichiometry of Inhibition for the Reactions of Proteinases with NBD P9 PAI-1 and Their Complexes with mAb—The SI is the number of moles of PAI-1 (or its complex with ligand(s)) required for the inactivation of 1 mol of proteinase. The SI values for reactions of β-trypsin, tPA, or uPA were determined directly by titration of NBD P9 PAI-1 or its binary (with SMBD or mAb) or ternary (with both SMBD and mAb) complexes with proteinase using either Photon Technology International or Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer as described previously (59Komissarov A.A. Declerck P.J. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43858-43865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, the known amount of NBD P9 PAI-1 (or its complex with ligand(s)) was titrated with small aliquots (less than 2% of NBD P9 PAI-1 volume) of proteinase. An increase in fluorescence emission because of the reaction of NBD P9 PAI-1 with the enzyme was measured and plotted against proteinase concentration. Starting from the equivalence point, the addition of proteinase did not induce changes in the NBD fluorescence. The values of SI (average of 3–5 measurements) were calculated from the amounts of proteinase required to reach the equivalence point as the ratios between the number of moles of NBD P9 PAI-1 present in solution and the number of moles of proteinase required for its complete titration. Effects of SMBD on Stoichiometry of Inhibition of uPA with wtPAI-1 and Their Complexes with mAb—The effect of the SMBD of Vn on the SI for the reaction of uPA with wtPAI-1 and its complexes with MA-55F4C12 or MA-33H1F7 was determined from a decrease in the fluorescence emission of uPA/p-aminobenzamidine (PAB) complex because of the displacement of PAB by PAI-1 (58Bijnens A.P.

https://openalex.org/W2085291234,"Background The primary objective of this study was to make the first step in the modelling of pharmaceutical demand in Italy, by deriving a weighted capitation model to account for demographic differences among general practices. The experimental model was called ASSET (Age/Sex Standardised Estimates of Treatment). Methods and Major Findings Individual prescription costs and demographic data referred to 3,175,691 Italian subjects and were collected directly from three Regional Health Authorities over the 12-month period between October 2004 and September 2005. The mean annual prescription cost per individual was similar for males (196.13 euro) and females (195.12 euro). After 65 years of age, the mean prescribing costs for males were significantly higher than females. On average, costs for a 75-year-old subject would be 12 times the costs for a 25–34 year-old subject if male, 8 times if female. Subjects over 65 years of age (22% of total population) accounted for 56% of total prescribing costs. The weightings explained approximately 90% of the evolution of total prescribing costs, in spite of the pricing and reimbursement turbulences affecting Italy in the 2000–2005 period. The ASSET weightings were able to explain only about 25% of the variation in prescribing costs among individuals. Conclusions If mainly idiosyncratic prescribing by general practitioners causes the unexplained variations, the introduction of capitation-based budgets would gradually move practices with high prescribing costs towards the national average. It is also possible, though, that the unexplained individual variation in prescribing costs is the result of differences in the clinical characteristics or socio-economic conditions of practice populations. If this is the case, capitation-based budgets may lead to unfair distribution of resources. The ASSET age/sex weightings should be used as a guide, not as the ultimate determinant, for an equitable allocation of prescribing resources to regional authorities and general practices."

In many organisms, V(D)J recombination is able to generate a large primary repertoire of highly diversified antigen receptors, and SHM is used to expand and fine-tune antibody specificities after antigen encounter in a process called affinity maturation. In the chicken Ig light chain (IgL) and heavy chain loci, combinatorial diversity is severely limited, and GCV and SHM are employed to diversify the primary antibody receptor pool (reviewed in Ref. 1Reynaud C.A. Bertocci B. Dahan A. Weill J.C. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 57: 353-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the chicken IgL locus, there are 25 pseudo V elements with sequence similarities to the sole functional V region, and they serve as sequence donors in the GCV pathway to create sequence variability. Nontemplated SHM events, which occur at a lower frequency, also contribute to sequence diversity of the primary Ig receptor repertoire (2Parvari R. Ziv E. Lantner F. Heller D. Schechter I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3072-3076Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the chicken B cell line DT40, Ig GCV and SHM have been shown to arise from a common intermediate (3Arakawa H. Saribasak H. Buerstedde J.M. Plos Biol. 2004; 2: E179Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is required for GCV/SHM and is thought to initiate these reactions by deamination of cytosine to generate uracil in DNA (4Arakawa H.

In DT40 cells, the uracils are processed predominantly by uracil DNA-glycosylase (UNG), and the resulting abasic site is channeled into either homology-based repair using pseudo V elements to produce GCV events or error-prone repair to produce SHM events.Little is known about the molecular characteristics that render a gene accessible to AID-mediated diversification processes. Mouse and cell line studies of SHM have demonstrated that transcription is essential, whereas the endogenous Ig promoters and the Ig variable region sequences themselves are not required (9Yelamos J.

Non-Ig genes have also been reported to undergo SHM, albeit at frequencies much lower than Ig genes, and such mis-targeting of SHM is thought to contribute to B cell malignancies (14Gordon M.S.

In addition, despite stable levels of transcription, the mutability of the cassettes was transient and waned in the weeks after integration. Our results indicate that high level transcription is insufficient for stably committing a gene to AID-mediated sequence diversification. Furthermore, the lack of specific targeting information in the cassette is overcome by it being a recently incorporated component of the genome. These results suggest that newly integrated DNA assumes an AID-permissive state similar to that of Ig genes, with implications for how mis-targeting of AID occurs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstructs—The human EF1-α promoter with 1 kb of its downstream intronic sequence was PCR-amplified (EFNHEF, 5′-cttgaaaggagctagcattggctccg-3′; EFLHINR, 5′-ctctagagaagctttcacgacacc-3′) from the pEBB plasmid (19Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar) to replace the β-actin promoter in a puromycin selection cassette flanked by mutant loxP sites (20Arakawa H. Lodygin D. Buerstedde J.M. BMC Biotechnol. 2001; 1: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The resulting EF1α-puro cassette was cloned into targeting vectors L and E. There are two versions of vector L, both flanked by a left homology arm spanning 3.5 kb upstream of the IgL promoter and a 1-kb right homology arm that starts at the IgL leader intron and extending into the J-C intron. Targeted integration of either L construct will insert the EF1α-puro cassette upstream of the promoter; one of the constructs contains a T7 promoter that will replace the endogenous IgL promoter whereas the other preserves the endogenous promoter. The homology arms of construct E include 2.2 kb upstream and downstream of the IgL enhancer, and targeted integration will replace the enhancer with the EF1α-puro cassette. Clones included in this study have the EF1α-puro cassette integrated in either transcriptional orientation. As no phenotypic differences have been observed in clones with different transcriptional orientations in the EF1α-puro cassette, the results are discussed without distinction between the two scenarios.Cell Culture and Transfection—All CL18-derivative clones of DT40 cells were cultured as described previously (21Buerstedde J.M. Reynaud C.A. Humphries E.H. Olson W. Ewert D.L. Weill J.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 921-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Transfections were performed with 25 μg of NotI-linearized plasmid or a BamHI fragment containing the EF1α-puro cassette being electroporated into cells using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) at 580 V and 25 microfarads. 10–14 h after transfection, the cells were seeded at limited dilutions and selected with 0.5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). Stable transfectants were identified 6–8 days after transfection.Southern and Northern Blotting—Genomic DNA was purified, and total cellular RNA was extracted from different cell types using RNA-Bee (Tel-Test), separated on agarose gels, and transferred onto GeneScreen Plus membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Blots were then hybridized with random hexamer-labeled (Roche Applied Science) DNA probes against puromycin, the IgL constant region (CCLF1, 5′-cccaccgtcaaaggaggagctg-3′; CCLR2, 5′-gacagtgacaggtagctgctggccatatac-3′), or GAPDH (CHGAPDHF, 5′-accagggctgccgtcctctc-3′; CHGAPDHR, 5′-ttctccatggtggtgaagac-3′).Flow Cytometry—Surface IgM expression was monitored by staining cells with a phycoerythrin-α-chicken IgM antibody (clone M-1, Southern Biotech) and analyzed on a FACScan (BD Biosciences).Sequence Analysis—Regions of interest were PCR-amplified using high fidelity Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) or Phusion DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) (EF1α, 5EBBP, 5′-gtaagtgccgtgtgtggttcc-3′, and 3EBBP, 5′-gtgtggggaaactccatcgc-3′; IgL, CVLF1-5′-ccatggcctgggctcctctcctcctg-3′, and CLA2-5′-gacagcacttacctggacagctg-3′). Gel-purified PCR products were treated with Taq polymerase, TA-cloned (Invitrogen), and sequenced using the PCR forward primers at the W. M. Keck Facility, Yale University School of Medicine. Two-sample t tests were applied to determine the statistical significance of differences in mutation frequencies between samples using Data Desk 6.2 (Data Description).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONGeneration and Integration of Heterologous Transcription Cassettes—We designed a non-Ig expression cassette (Fig. 1a) composed of the puromycin resistance gene driven by the human EF1-α promoter, which included a 1-kb region of EF1-α intronic sequences downstream of the transcription start site known to contribute to high level transcription (22Wakabayashi-Ito N. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29831-29837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In mammalian systems, SHM occurs at highest levels within 1 kb downstream of transcription start sites (23Rada C. Milstein C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4570-4576Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and thus by separating the puromycin resistance gene from the promoter, we hoped to minimize mutation of the gene and hence the loss of mutated clones during the selection process.The EF1α-puro cassette was incorporated into two IgL targeting constructs. The L construct was designed to insert the cassette upstream of the coding VJ region, whereas the E construct was designed to replace the IgL enhancer with the EF1α-puro cassette (Fig. 1b). Either the L or E construct was electroporated into the CL18 clone of DT40 cells, and stably transfected single cell clones were selected in puromycin, expanded, and analyzed for targeted or random integration by Southern blotting (supplemental Fig. 1, A and B). Southern blotting was also used to determine the copy number of the integrated cassettes, and only single-copy integrants were chosen for subsequent analyses. Curiously, the majority of clones generated were single-copy integrants regardless of whether targeted integration had occurred, possibly implying that even random integrants utilized homology-based mechanisms for construct integration. Northern blots demonstrated that all clones expressed the EF1α-puro cassette, although transcription levels were higher in targeted integrants than random integrants (see below); other clones discussed in subsequent sections were also analyzed by Northern blots to measure expression of the EF1α-puro cassette (see below, and data not shown).Heterologous Cassettes Can Undergo AID-dependent Hypermutation in Ig and Non-Ig Loci—We cultured two targeted L clones (L4 and L6) and three targeted E clones (E7, E8, and E18) for 4 weeks after transfection and sequenced the region 125–650 bp downstream of the transcription start site (the sequenced region is entirely within EF1-α intronic sequences). Both L4 and L6 were generated using the L construct that contained the T7 promoter so that the IgL promoter was replaced to avoid possible promoter competition (Fig. 1b). As there are no homologous DNA elements to the EF1α-puro cassette in the DT40 genome, we expected the majority of sequence variations to arise as untemplated point mutations and not by gene conversion (GCV). Mutations were found in all five clones, and collectively, 39 mutations were observed in 164 sequences analyzed, translating into a mutation frequency of 4.5 × 10–4 mutations per base pair (Table 1, lines 1–5). This is not much different from the combined IgL GCV/SHM frequency in other clones in which the IgL locus was unaltered (see below, 7.5 × 10–4 events per base pair; Table 2, lines 4 and 5, before and after subcloning). 5The “combined IgL GCV/SHM frequency in other clones in which the IgL locus was unaltered” was calculated by dividing the total number of mutation events in clones L1 and L12, before and after subcloning (Table 2, lines 4 and 5), by the total number of sequences obtained for both clones, before and after subcloning. These results indicate that the EF1α-puro cassette can be mutated when integrated into the IgL locus.TABLE 1Mutation profiles of various genes sequenced in different clonesLinesClonesGene sequencedMutationsTotal sequencesMutated sequencesaNumbers in parentheses indicate the percentages of sequences that contained at least one mutation.Mutation frequency (×10-4 mutations/bp)bSequence length is 525 bp.TransitionscPercentages of transition mutations are calculated among all point mutations, not including insertions and deletions.InsdIns indicates nucleotide insertions.DeleDel indicates nucleotide deletions.Mutations at GCp valuefStatistical significance to AID-/- cells is shown.Targeted1L4EF1α-puro8368 (22.2%)4.26 (75.0%)007 (87.5%)0.00612L6EF1α-puro6366 (16.7%)3.24 (80.0%)014 (66.7%)0.0233E7EF1α-puro8286 (21.4%)5.42 (28.6%)016 (75.0%)0.0254E8EF1α-puro9329 (28.1%)5.47 (77.8%)009 (100.0%)0.00265E18EF1α-puro8328 (25.0%)4.86 (85.7%)105 (62.5%)0.0054Random6L1EF1α-puro8306 (20.0%)5.18 (100.0%)008 (100.0%)0.0267L12EF1α-puro212918 (62.1%)13.813 (68.4%)1118 (85.7%)≤0.00018E20EF1α-puro7316 (19.4%)4.34 (66.7%)104 (57.1%)0.0269NF clones (3)EF1α-puro10889 (10.2%)2.28 (80.0%)009 (90.0%)0.01310L clones (3)gTwo clones are targeted L clones; the third is a random L clone.ch.

Open table in a new tab We next asked if the mutability of the EF1α-puro cassette was restricted to the IgL locus by performing a similar sequence analysis of three random integrant clones L1, L12, and E20 after 4 weeks of culture. The L construct used to generate L1 and L12 contained the IgL promoter (Fig. 1b). Interestingly, the three randomly integrated clones also exhibited a substantial accumulation of mutations in the EF1-α puro cassette (combined mutation frequency of 7.6 × 10–4 mutations per base pair; Table 1, lines 6–8 pooled together). To test whether the constructs were being mutated because of a genome-wide mutation phenomenon, we sequenced the endogenous EF1-α gene, reasoning that if the cells had a generally elevated mutation activity, other highly transcribed endogenous genes should become targets as well. This was not the case, as very few mutations were found in the endogenous EF1-α gene (0.45 × 10–4 mutations per base pair; Table 1, line 10), in line with mutation frequencies of non-Ig genes reported previously in DT40 cells (3Arakawa H. Saribasak H. Buerstedde J.M. Plos Biol. 2004; 2: E179Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These data suggest that mutation activity was specific to the transfected constructs.Because the L and E constructs contained IgL locus sequences in the homology arms (albeit nonoverlapping sequences), we wondered if those sequences were contributing to the mutability of the EF1α-puro cassette. To address this, we generated single-copy, randomly integrated clones of the EF1α-puro cassette without any flanking IgL sequences (NF cells). Sequence analysis of three independent clones after at least 4 weeks of culture revealed that the cassettes were mutated at levels higher than those in AID-deficient cells (as described below), although the mutation frequency of the NF construct was lower than L or E (Table 1, line 9). We conclude that the flanking IgL sequences in constructs L and E are not required for the introduction of mutations into the EF1α-puro cassette.As is the case for untemplated point mutations in DT40 Ig variable regions (3Arakawa H. Saribasak H. Buerstedde J.M. Plos Biol. 2004; 2: E179Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), the mutations observed in the EF1-α puro cassette in L, E, and NF clones were almost entirely at GC base pairs, suggesting that AID might be responsible. To test this, the L construct was transfected into AID-deficient DT40 cells (4Arakawa H. Hauschild J. Buerstedde J.M. Science. 2002; 295: 1301-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), and six independent clones were subjected to sequence analysis after at least 4 weeks of culture. We found only three mutations out of 185 sequences, yielding a mutation frequency (0.31 × 10–4 mutations/bp; Table 1, line 11) more than 10-fold lower than that observed in wild-type CL18 cells. We conclude that most of the mutations found in the EF1α-puro cassette in wild-type cells were dependent on AID.Heterologous Cassettes Mutate Only Transiently in Ig and Non-Ig Loci—The above results indicated that the EF1α-puro cassette was mutated regardless of its integration site. This led us to wonder if mutation of the cassette had something to do with it being a piece of DNA recently incorporated into the genome, in which case mutability might be lost after some time in culture. This was investigated by subcloning cells that had been grown for 3 weeks after transfection; randomly chosen subclones were then cultured for 4 additional weeks, which allowed mutations to accumulate for the same amount of time as in the analyses above. Sequence analysis revealed that the random integrant clones L1, L12, and E20 lost their ability to mutate the EF1-α construct after subcloning, with combined mutation levels dropping from 7.6 × 10–4 to 0.42 × 10–4 mutations/bp (Table 2, lines 4–6). Intriguingly, even cassettes integrated in the IgL locus did not mutate after subcloning (Table 2, lines 1–3). We recently observed that the EF1-α promoter has a substantial defect in supporting GCV/SHM of IgL when used to replace the endogenous IgL promoter (13Yang S.Y. Fugmann S.D. Schatz D.G. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 2919-2928Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus the inability of the EF1α-puro cassette to support stable mutation in the IgL locus could be due to a defect in the promoter itself. Nonetheless, any defects in mutation targeting could be overcome during the initial period post-integration.To ensure that the loss of mutability of the EF1α-puro cassette observed after subcloning was not the result of a general defect in AID-mediated diversification, we examined the IgL locus for evidence of GCV/SHM. The CL18 clone carries a frameshift mutation in the IgL variable region that can be corrected by GCV to allow surface IgM expression, and this provides a convenient readout for ongoing GCV (21Buerstedde J.M. Reynaud C.A. Humphries E.H. Olson W. Ewert D.L. Weill J.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 921-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Measurements of surface IgM expression revealed that the L1 and L12 clones gave rise to comparable percentages of IgM+ cells before and after subcloning after 4 weeks of culture (Fig. 2a). Sequence analysis corroborated results from IgM reversion assays and showed that these cells were still capable of performing robust IgL GCV/SHM after they were subcloned (Table 2, lines 4 and 5). These results demonstrate that the loss of mutability that occurs after subcloning is specific to the EF1α-puro cassette and cannot be explained by the loss of an activity or factor, such as AID, required for GCV/SHM.FIGURE 2a, flow cytometric plots showing surface IgM staining on the y axis of clones L1 and L12 (random integrants) at day 28 before and after subcloning. b, Northern blot analysis of expression in clones L4 and L6 (targeted integrants) and L1 and L12 (random integrants) before and after subcloning. The blot was hybridized with probes for puromycin and GAPDH, the latter being the internal control. Quantitation was performed by calculating the puromycin:GAPDH ratio.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It was also possible that the clones stopped mutating the EF1α-puro cassette because of decreased transcription after subcloning. To address this, we performed Northern blots on cells before and after subcloning, and we found that expression of the heterologous cassette was unchanged after subcloning (Fig. 2b, and data not shown). Therefore, the loss in mutability was not a result of changes in expression of the cassette.The Origin of Mutations in the Heterologous Cassettes—We analyzed the distribution and pattern of mutations occurring in the EF1α-puro cassette by combining all mutations recorded before subcloning. Mutations were detected throughout the region sequenced with two 50-bp intervals (400–450 and 500–550 bp from the transcription start site) showing the highest frequencies of mutation (Fig. 3b). This distribution is similar to that reported in mammalian Ig genes and transgenes and does not correlate in any obvious way with the distribution of SHM hot spots (RGYW motifs) in the EF1-α intronic region sequenced (Fig. 3b). In addition, there was a heavy bias for transition mutations at G and C residues (67%; Fig. 3a). This is in sharp contrast to what has been reported for SHM events in the DT40 IgL locus, which are biased toward G to C and C to G transversion mutations (3Arakawa H. Saribasak H. Buerstedde J.M. Plos Biol. 2004; 2: E179Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 24Simpson L.J. Sale J.E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1654-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 25Sale J.E. Calandrini D.M. Takata M. Takeda S. Neuberger M.S. Nature. 2001; 412: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). It is thought that uracil DNA-glycosylase (UNG) recognizes and processes uracils introduced by AID; in UNG–/– DT40 cells, GCV is abrogated, and mutation patterns shift largely toward G/C to A/T transitions, presumably because the uracils remain in the DNA during replication (6Di Noia J. Neuberger M.S. Nature. 2002; 419: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 7Di Noia J.M. Neuberger M.S. Eur. J.

Biol. 2002; 12: 1748-1755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). The pattern we observe is therefore consistent with a model in which mutation is initiated by AID-mediated deamination of C, with replication of the resulting uracil generating G to A and C to T mutations. The high prevalence of G/C transition mutations seen in our EF1α-puro cassette suggests that UNG is not efficiently recruited to the cassette and that the repair pathways that would normally follow AID-mediated deamination of Ig genes were not recruited to the EF1α-puro cassette. This suggests that targeting of AID and targeting of error-prone repair can be dissociated from each other.FIGURE 3a, pattern of mutations found in the EF1α-puro cassette of all L and E clones before subcloning.

Todo K. Takahashi S. Magari M. Ohmori H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: e10Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar); results showed that the unit underwent GCV in the IgL locus but not in a non-Ig locus, suggesting that GCV is limited to Ig regions. There could be two explanations for the differences in the results of that study compared with those reported here. First, the published GCV unit might not have been transcribed strongly enough to be targeted by AID in non-Ig loci. Second, GCV requires the participation of sequence donors, UNG, and homology-based repair, and features of the Ig loci might facilitate this repair pathway. Therefore, even if the GCV unit was targeted by AID when integrated into a non-Ig locus, UNG would not have been recruited efficiently, and GCV would have been inefficient. Our use of direct sequencing enabled detection of AID action even though the normal repair pathways utilized for GCV/SHM of Ig loci in DT40s were not efficiently involved.Our results suggest that DNA newly introduced into cells has properties, acquired or intrinsic, that distinguish it from existing genomic DNA, and such properties allow it to be targeted by AID. Although it is possible that the cassette can be accessed by AID prior to integration, all mutations reported here occurred post-integration. This is because the clones underwent singlecell cloning prior to expansion and sequencing; therefore, the expanded culture all originated from the same cell harboring a single copy of the transfected transgene. Because only unique mutations within a clone were scored, such mutations could only have arisen post-integration. The EF1α-puro cassette might have particular features that contribute to its mutability in these experiments, most notably that it contains a strong promoter. The human EF1-α promoter used here includes most of the sequences from the EF1-α first intron, a region that"
