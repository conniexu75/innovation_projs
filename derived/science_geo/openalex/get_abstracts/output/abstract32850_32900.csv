https://openalex.org/W2027306447,"Staphylococcal enterotoxin B is known to be a powerful T cell stimulant in mouse and man. In this paper we show that, for mice, this is because the protein in association with major histocompatibility complex class II molecules stimulates virtually all T cells bearing V beta 3 and V beta 8.1, 8.2, and 8.3, and few others. Neonatal mice given the enterotoxin eliminate all mature, and some immature, T cells bearing these V beta s, demonstrating that tolerance to exogenously administered antigen can be caused by clonal deletion of reactive T cells. The enterotoxin shares these ""superantigenic"" properties with known self-antigens in mice, Mls-1a and Mls-2a, and a B cell-derived product, a shared property that is unlikely to be coincidental or inconsequential."
https://openalex.org/W2073293904,"Recent studies suggest that the fly uses the inositol lipid signaling system for visual excitation and that the Drosophila transient receptor potential (trp) mutation disrupts this process subsequent to the production of IP3. In this paper, we show that trp encodes a novel 1275 amino acid protein with eight putative transmembrane segments. Immunolocalization indicates that the trp protein is expressed predominantly in the rhabdomeric membranes of the photoreceptor cells."
https://openalex.org/W1557253076,"Isolation and structure elucidation of an acid-resistant fluorescent molecule from human extracellular matrix revealed the presence of an imidazo[4,5-b]pyridinium molecule comprising a lysine and an arginine residue cross-linked by a pentose. Structure confirmation was achieved in vitro by the nonenzymatic reaction of ribose with lysine and arginine residues. The cross-link, named pentosidine, could also be synthesized with isomers of ribose, arabinose, xylose, and lyxose as well as by incubating young human collagen with these sugars at 37 ° C. Pentosidine was found in a variety of human tissues including plasma proteins and red blood cells. Its presence in cells grown in culture strongly suggests ribose or ribonucleotide metabolites as precursors. The unexpected discovery of pentose-mediated protein cross-linking raises new questions concerning the aging process."
https://openalex.org/W1967404701,"Three cellular proteins, including species of 300,000 daltons and 107,000 daltons as well as p105-RB, the product of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene, stably interact with the adenovirus E1A proteins. To help determine the functional basis of these interactions, the regions of E1A that participate in these interactions were mapped using a series of deletion mutants. The 300,000 dalton and the 107,000 dalton proteins interacted with sequences within amino acids 1 to 76 and 121 to 127, respectively. Interaction with the third cellular protein, p105-RB, required the presence of sequences from two noncontiguous regions of the E1A polypeptide chain, amino acids 30 to 60 and 121 to 127. The regions of E1A that are required for these interactions coincided precisely with the regions of E1A that are required for its transforming function. These results suggest that the interactions with these cellular proteins are fundamental to the transforming activity of E1A."
https://openalex.org/W1998279906,"c-Jun, Jun-B, and Jun-D proteins bind to the TPA response element (TRE) either as homodimers or as Jun-Fos heterodimers. We demonstrate that c-Jun and Jun-B nevertheless differ markedly in their ability to activate AP-1 responsive genes. c-Jun is an efficient activator of the c-jun and collagenase promoters, which contain a single TRE; Jun-B is not. Furthermore, Jun-B inhibits activation of these promoters by c-Jun. On the other hand, like c-Jun, Jun-B is an efficient activator of constructs containing multimeric TREs. Using chimeric proteins, we show that the distinct behavior of c-Jun and Jun-B is due to differences in their activation domains. Trans-activation by Jun-B depends on cooperative interactions between adjacently bound factors, while activation by c-Jun does not require such interactions. This differential behavior greatly expands the regulatory potential of the Jun family."
https://openalex.org/W1989247542,"Oncogenically transformed cells show reduced assembly of fibronectin-rich extracellular matrixes and diminished ability to adhere to fibronectin. The molecular bases of these phenotypic alteration are not fully understood. We report here alterations in the spectrum of integrins, including two fibronectin receptors, on oncogenic transformation of rodent cells. Transformation of rat1, NRK, and Nil8 cells by Rous sarcoma virus or by murine sarcoma viruses encoding ras oncogenes leads to reductions in the level of integrin alpha 5 beta 1, which is a well-defined fibronectin receptor, and of two other integrin receptors. In contrast, another receptor, alpha 3 beta 1, which is a polyspecific receptor for fibronectin, laminin, and collagen, is retained by transformed cells. These results provide explanations for earlier results concerning the interactions of extracellular matrix proteins with the surfaces of tumor cells and offer leads to further understanding of the altered adhesive and migratory behavior of malignant cells."
https://openalex.org/W1988568219,"Fos and Jun form a heterodimeric complex that associates with the nucleotide sequence motif known as the AP-1 binding site. Although this complex has been proposed to function as a transcriptional regulator in neurons, no specific target gene has yet been identified. Proenkephalin mRNA increased in the hippocampus during seizure just after an increase in c-fos and c-jun expression was detected. Fos-Jun complexes bound specifically to a regulatory sequence in the 5' control region of the proenkephalin gene. Furthermore, c-fos and c-jun stimulated transcription from this control region synergistically in transactivation assays. These data suggest that the proenkephalin gene may be a physiological target for Fos and Jun in the hippocampus and indicate that these proto-oncogene transcription factors may play a role in neuronal responses to stimulation."

https://openalex.org/W1984361597,"We have cloned the human jun-B gene and determined its sequence and transforming and trans-activating activities. jun-B is less potent that c-jun in transforming and immortalizing primary rat embryo cells in cooperation with activated ras (effects enhanced by c-fos and TPA); unlike c-jun, jun-B does not transform Rat-1A cells alone. However, cotransfection of c-jun and jun-B into primary rat embryo cells with c-Ha-ras results in a significant decrease in transformation compared with c-jun alone, an event reversed by TPA. Cotransfection of c-jun and jun-B with or without c-fos into F9 teratocarcinoma cells results in decreased trans-activation of AP-1 compared with either gene alone. Introduction of jun-B into primary rat c-jun/ras transformants or c-jun into jun-B/ras transformants also results in a decrease in trans-activation. These findings demonstrate that, whereas jun-B and c-jun each participate in AP-1 trans-activation and malignant transformation, interactions between them involve negative regulation."

https://openalex.org/W2081537428,"The regulation and function of two forms of the amyloid β protein precursor (ABPP) that are released into the growth-conditioned medium of the PC12 nerve cell line were examined. Nerve growth factor increases the release of the form of ABPP without the proteaseinhibitor domain relative to the protein containing the protease inhibitor and increases the overall rate of ABPP secretion 2-fold. In contrast, fibroblast growth factor increases the rate of ABPP secretion approximately 7-fold. Both forms of the secreted ABPP molecule are, in turn, able to stimulate adhesion of PC12 cells to substrata to which they are adsorbed about 10-fold more efficiently on a molar basis than laminin."
https://openalex.org/W2075304472,"Although the β-amyloid peptide is an established core component of neuritic plaques that accumulate in Alzheimer's disease, the mechanisms responsible for its deposition are not well understood. We now report that lesions of rat hippocampal neurons cause a time-dependent, long-lasting elevation of immunoreactivity for the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) in neighboring astrocytes, a cell type not normally containing the protein. The increase represents astroglial expression of the protein rather than a scavenging of APP released by damaged neurons. Immunoelectron microscopy confirmed that APP-containing cells are reactive astroglia, both surrounding capillaries and within the neuropil. These results demonstrate that neuronal damage stimulates APP expression in adult brain and suggest that reactive astrocytes may be a source of the β-amyloid that forms neuropathological plaques in Alzheimer's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2093710529,"Seizure causes a rapid and protracted increase in transcription factor AP-1 levels in the brain. The composition of AP-1 nucleoprotein complexes changes with time after seizure as a result of the sequential appearance and disappearance of Fos and several Fos-related proteins. Although these changes occur over an 8 hr time period, they are triggered by 15 min of seizure. Alterations in the levels and composition of transcription factors may represent one of the molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W2078707642,"Cell lineages that give rise to the PNS were studied using the thymidine analog 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) to visualized DNA replication immunocyto-chemically. che precursors of the PNS in the body segments of Drosophila embryos replicate their DNA in a spatially and temporally stereotyped pattern. The sequence of DNA replication within developing sensory organs suggests particular lineage relationships of the cells that constitute a sensory organ, i.e., neuron and associated support cells. In embryos that are mutant for the achaete-scute complex or daughterless, in which most or all of the PNS is missing, no BrdU-labeled cells were found in the appropriate regions, suggesting that these PNS precursors either do not form or fail to replicate. Thus, the BrdU technique allows determination as to whether a mutation affects the PNS precursors or terminal differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2003579974,"Fos protein can trans-activate AP-1-dependent gene expression and trans-repress the c-fos promoter. Although we find that trans-repression is enhanced by coexpression of c-Jun, it does not require any of the AP-1 or ATF sites in the mouse c-fos promoter. A major target for repression is the serum response element (SRE). Fos mutants with an impaired leucine zipper are defective in trans-repression and transformation, suggesting that these functions involve the formation of Fos protein complexes. In contrast, mutations that abolish DNA binding of Fos enhance trans-repression but destroy the transforming potential of Fos. In addition, v-Fos protein efficiently transforms but is unable to trans-repress. These findings point to different mechanisms involved in trans-activation and trans-repression and suggest that trans-repression of the type described here is neither sufficient nor required for Fos-induced transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2063652927,"Using cell-autonomous markers we have traced the origins of prespore cells and two types of prestalk cells (pstA and pstB cells) during slug formation. We show that cell sorting and positional information both contribute to Dictyostelium morphogenesis. The initial pattern established at the mound stage is topologically quite different from that of the slug. Confirming previous studies, we find that prespore cells occupy most of the aggregate but are absent from a thin layer at the base and from the emerging tip. PstB cells are almost entirely localized to the basal region during the early stages of tip formation. Thus prespore and pstB cell differentiation appear to occur in response to localized morphogenetic signals. In the case of pstB cells, these signals presumably emanate from the base and not, as might be expected, from the tip. When first detectable, pstA cells are scattered throughout the aggregate. They then appear to migrate to the apex, where the tip forms."
https://openalex.org/W1595134608,"Abstract In membranes of myeloid differentiated HL-60 cells, the chemotactic peptide N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine stimulates phospholipase C via a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein but does not inhibit adenylyl cyclase. In these membranes, the chemotactic peptide markedly stimulates the cholera toxin-dependent [32P]ADP-ribosylation of two proteins with approximate molecular masses of 40 and 41 kDa, respectively. The radiolabeled proteins comigrate on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels with the two pertussis toxin substrates present in HL-60 membranes, alpha i2 and alpha i3. The effect of the chemotactic peptide is blocked by treatment of intact HL-60 cells with pertussis toxin. Peptide mapping studies using Staphylococcus aureus protease V8 reveal that the two radiolabeled proteins are structurally distinct. Thus, the agonist-activated formyl peptide receptor functionally interacts with two distinct pertussis toxin substrates, most likely with Gi2 and Gi3. As the third Gi protein, Gi1, appears to be absent from both HL-60 cells and from systems that clearly reveal hormonal inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, the results strongly suggest that primary structure alone does not suffice to determine which effector mechanism is regulated by a given Gi-protein."
https://openalex.org/W2065267195,"Using primary cultures of chicken myotubes, we investigated the involvement of protein kinase C and Ca2+ in the repression of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) biosynthesis by electrical activity. Treatment with the Ca2+ channel blocker verapamil or the Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin increased α subunit mRNA levels 11.5- to 15-fold. The effect of tetrodotoxin was abolished in the presence of the Ca2+ ionophore A23187. Dantrolene, which blocks Ca2+ efflux from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, caused only a 1.7-fold increase in a subunit mRNA levels. Down regulation of protein kinase C by prolonged exposure to the phorbol ester TPA or inhibition of protein kinase C by staurosporine led to 8-to 10-fold increases in a subunit mRNA levels. Mature and precursor forms of AChR α subunit mRNA were found to vary in parallel throughout all of these treatments, suggesting that protein kinase C and Ca2+ ions may modulate AChR a subunit biosynthesis at the transcriptional level."
https://openalex.org/W1503071035,"Abstract The Nitella-based in vitro motility assay developed by Sheetz and Spudich (Sheetz, M.P., and Spudich, J. A. (1983) Nature 303, 31-35) is a quantitative assay for measuring the velocity of myosin-coated beads over an organized substratum of actin. We have used this assay to analyze the effect of phosphorylation of various sites on the 20,000-Da light chain of smooth muscle and cytoplasmic myosins. Phosphorylation by myosin light chain kinase at serine 19 on the 20,000-Da light chain subunit of smooth muscle myosin from turkey gizzard, bovine trachea and aorta, and of cytoplasmic myosin from human platelets was required for bead movement. The individual phosphorylated myosin-coated beads moved at characteristic rates under the same conditions (turkey gizzard myosin, 0.2 micron/s; aorta or trachea myosin, 0.12 micron/s; and platelet myosin, 0.04 micron/s; in contrast, rabbit skeletal muscle myosin, 2 micron/s). Myosin light chain kinase can also phosphorylate threonine 18 in addition to serine 19, and this phosphorylation resulted in an increase in the actin-activated MgATPase activity (Ikebe, M., and Hartshorne, D.J. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 10027-10031). Phosphorylation at this site had no effect on the velocity of smooth muscle myosin-coated beads. Protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) can also phosphorylate two to three sites on the 20,000-Da light chain, and this phosphorylation alone did not result in the movement of myosin-coated beads. When myosin that had been previously phosphorylated by myosin light chain kinase at serine 19 was also phosphorylated by protein kinase C, myosin-coated beads moved at the same velocity as beads coated with myosin phosphorylated by myosin light chain kinase alone. Tropomyosin binding to actin also had an activating effect on the actin-activated MgATPase activity through an effect on the Vmax and also resulted in an increase in the velocity of myosin-coated beads."
https://openalex.org/W2035412712,"A 66 kd protein, pl 5.4, was purified from the Triton-insoluble fraction of rat spinal cord. This protein formed 10 nm filaments in vitro. The 66 kd protein was unique, although it shared homology with the 70 kd neurofilament protein (NF-L) and vimentin. An antiserum (anti-66) specific to the 66 kd protein did not cross-react with any of the neurofilament triplet proteins. In the spinal cord, anti-66 intensely stained the axons of the anterior and lateral columns. However, afferents from dorsal root ganglia and the efferents from the motoneurons were negative. In the cerebellum, anti-66 intensely stained most axons. The 66 kd protein was readily detectable in homogenates of forebrain, cerebellum, brainstem, and spinal cord, but was found only in trace amounts in adult sciatic nerves and was not found in extraneural tissues. The 66 kd protein constituted 0.5% of total protein in the spinal cord, whereas NF-L constituted about 1.5%."
https://openalex.org/W1520705833,"Human amnion was solubilized using pepsin and the digest supernatant screened for fragments of fibrillin with a previously characterized monoclonal antibody (Sakai, L. Y., Keene, D. R., and Engvall, E. (1986) J. Cell Biol. 103, 2499–2509). One fragment (PF1), with an apparent molecular weight of 94,000, was isolated and characterized. Two other fragments, PF2 and PF3, were isolated and shown to be fragments of fibrillin by preparing a monospecific antisera to PF2 and a monoclonal antibody to PF3. Immunoelectron microscopy and immunoblotting showed that both antibodies were specific for fibrillin. Electron microscope pictures of rotary-shadowed PF1 and PF2 showed them to be short rod-shaped molecules while PF3 has a crab-like appearance and seems to be an aggregate of several fibrillin chain fragments. Amino-terminal amino acid sequencing of PF1 and PF2 gave single unique sequences. Each of the three antibodies used was specific for one fragment and peptide mapping of PF1 and PF2 showed that there was no significant amino acid sequence overlap. Aggregates of PF3 are described which provided insight into the assembly and macro-molecular structure of fibrillin in microfibrils."
https://openalex.org/W1582114605,"The molecular species of 1,2-diacylglycerol in control and agonist-stimulated rat hepatocytes were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. Twelve species were identified which were increased nonuniformly by 100 n M vasopressin. Most species were increased 2–3-fold, but some (C16:0/C20:4 and C18:0/ C20:4) were increased 3–6-fold. Selectively greater increases in the latter two species were also induced by ATP, angiotensin II, and A23187 ionophore, however, phorbol ester caused uniform increases. Calcium depletion of the cells with chelator resulted in a uniform 2-fold effect of vasopressin on 1,2-diacylglycerol species, with greater increases in C16:0/C20:4 and C18:0/C20:4 being restored by Ca2+ readdition. Comparison of the increases in 1,2-diacylglycerol species caused by the Ca2+-mediated agents with the molecular species present in rat hepatocyte phospholipids supports the concept that phosphatidylcholine is a major source of the 1,2-diacylglycerol that accumulates. In hepatocytes incubated for 5 min to 2 h with 1-0-[3H]alkyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, the label was incorporated mainly into phosphatidylcholine, and subsequent incubation with vasopressin, angiotensin II, ATP, epinephrine, A23187, and phorbol ester caused formation of [3H]alkyl-acylglycerol, but not [3H]alkyl-phosphatidic acid. The time course and concentration dependence of the vasopressin effect were similar to those reported previously for total 1,2-diacylglycerol (Bocckino, S. B., Blackmore, P. F., and Exton, J. H. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 14201–14207). Calcium depletion induced by chelator inhibited the effect of vasopressin, and readdition of Ca2+largely restored the effect. In cells incubated with [14C]lyso-phosphatidylcholine, [3H]phosphatidylcholine, or [14C]phosphatidylethanolamine for 5 or 30 min to label hepatocyte phosphatidylcholine, vasopressin also induced the formation of labeled 1,2-diacylglycerol, but not phosphatidic acid. In contrast, in hepatocytes prepared from rats injected intraportally with [3H]alkyl-lyso-glycerophosphocholine 20 h previously, the hormone induced the rapid formation of both labeled 1,2-diacylglycerol and phosphatidic acid. In summary, these isotopic data indicate that a rapidly labeled pool of phosphatidylcholine is hydrolyzed to 1,2-diacylglycerol and a slowly labeled pool is broken down to both 1,2-diacylglycerol and phosphatidic acid in hepatocytes stimulated by Ca2+-mobilizing agents. It is concluded from both the analyses of molecular species of 1,2-diacylglycerol and the labeling experiments that phosphatidylcholine is a major source of the 1,2-diacylglycerol that accumulates in hepatocytes stimulated with Ca2+-mobilizing agonists and that the mechanisms responsible may involve both Ca2+ and protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1587781511,"Proteolytic degradation of receptor sites on the mitochondrial surface strongly reduces the efficiency of mitochondrial protein import. The remaining residual import still involves basic mechanisms of protein import, including: insertion of precursors into the outer membrane, requirement for ATP and a membrane potential, and translocation through contact sites between both membranes. The import of a chloroplast protein into isolated mitochondria which occurs with a low rate is not inhibited by a protease-pretreatment of mitochondria, indicating that this precursor only follows the bypass pathway. The low efficiency of bypass import suggests that this unspecific import does not disturb the uniqueness of mitochondrial protein composition. We conclude that mitochondrial protein import involves a series of steps in which receptor sites appear to be responsible for the specificity of protein uptake."
https://openalex.org/W1559057202,"Abstract The Gunn rat is a mutant strain of Wistar rat which has unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia as a result of the absence of hepatic UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UDPGT) activity toward bilirubin. The Gunn rat is also deficient in a 3-methylcholanthrene (MC)-inducible UDPGT isoenzyme that has high activity toward phenolic substrates. We have isolated and sequenced a cDNA, designated 4-NP UDPGT, which encodes an MC-inducible UDPGT from normal Wistar rat livers (Iyanagi, T., Haniu, M., Sogawa, F., Fujii-Kuriyama, Y., Watanabe, S., Shively, J.E., and Anan, K.F. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 15607-15614). In the present study, we found that this cDNA detected MC-inducible UDPGT mRNA in the MC-treated homozygous Gunn rat liver. The level of this mRNA, however, was significantly lower than that of normal Wistar livers. The size of mRNA in Gunn rats was identical to that of the functionally mature UDPGT mRNA in Wistar rats, but the MC-inducible UDPGT protein was absent from homozygous Gunn rat microsomes. We therefore made a cDNA library from MC-treated Gunn rat liver mRNA and isolated cDNA clones, using the 4-NP UDPGT cDNA as a probe. Sequencing analysis of these cDNA clones revealed a single base deletion in the coding region. Northern blot analysis of mRNAs from normal Wistar and heterozygous and homozygous Gunn rats livers was performed using specific oligonucleotide probes, and the results confirmed the presence of mRNA containing the single base deletion in heterozygous and homozygous Gunn rats. These data suggested that the defect of the MC-inducible isoenzyme in Gunn rats arises from a -1 frameshift mutation that removes 115 amino acids from the COOH terminus."

https://openalex.org/W1487975069,"Abstract Kinesin is a microtubule-activated, mechanochemical ATPase capable of moving particles along microtubules and making microtubules glide along a solid substrate. In this study we used limited proteolysis to study the structure of bovine brain kinesin, a heterotetramer composed of two heavy (120-kDa) and two light (62-kDa) chains. alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin, and subtilisin all produced a protease-resistant 45-kDa fragment from the kinesin heavy chain. As isolated by gel-filtration chromatography, this fragment contains both the microtubule-binding site and the ATP catalytic site of the molecule. Proteolytic cleavage stimulated microtubule-dependent Mg2+-ATPase activity 4- to 5-fold up to 75-120 mumol ATP/min/mg. Cleavage also increased the affinity of the fragment for microtubules at least 10-fold. Since the purified fragment does not support the gliding of flagellar axonemes, we propose that cleavage of the heavy chain uncouples ATPase activity from its translocator activity, which may require other parts of the molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1561066485,"Abstract The hydrolytic activity of phosphatidylcholine phospholipase D in the synaptosomes from canine brain was examined using a radiochemical assay with 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphoryl[3H]choline as the exogenous substrate. The involvement of G protein(s) in regulation of this enzyme was demonstrated by a 2- to 3-fold stimulation of the basal activity (4.81 +/- 0.44 nmol choline released/mg protein/h) with guanosine 5'-(3-O-thiol)triphosphate (GTP gamma S), guanyl-5'-yl-(beta, gamma-methylene)diphosphonate, aluminum fluoride, or cholera toxin. The stimulation of phospholipase D hydrolytic activity by GTP gamma S was inhibited by 2 mM guanosine 5'-(2-O-thiol)diphosphate. GTP gamma S at the maximum stimulatory concentration (10 microM) had an additive effect on the maximum cholera toxin stimulation of phospholipase D activity. However, the reverse was not true, thus indicating the possibility that more than one G protein may be involved. Furthermore, cholinergic agonists, including acetylcholine, carbachol, and muscarine, were able to increase the phospholipase D hydrolytic activity at low but not maximally stimulatory concentrations of guanine nucleotide. These cholinergic stimulations were antagonized by atropine, a muscarinic blocker. In addition, O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, a protein kinase C activator, was able to stimulate the hydrolytic activity of phospholipase D more than 300% in the presence of 0.2 microM GTP gamma S. However, in the absence of GTP gamma S, stimulation was less than 60%. Our results not only indicate that the receptor-G protein-regulated phospholipase D may be directly responsible for the rapid accumulation of choline and phosphatidic acid in the central nervous system but also reveal that muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-G protein-regulated phospholipase D is a novel signal transduction process coupling the neuronal muscarinic receptor to cellular responses."
https://openalex.org/W1582103124,"MOPC41 immunoglobulin kappa gene constructs have been stably introduced into the mouse germ line to investigate the effects of deleting the conserved intronic sequences on gene expression. Intact kappa genes containing 1.5 kilobase pairs of upstream and 8.5 kilobase pairs of downstream flanking sequences were highly expressed tissue-specifically, raising the total level of kappa mRNA in spleens severalfold in most transgenic animals. This high expression was often accompanied by marked suppression of endogenous kappa gene activity. Transgenes containing a deletion of the matrix association region (MAR) or both the MAR and enhancer were expressed tissue-specifically at mean levels only 2- and 3-fold lower, respectively, than that of intact transgenes. Therefore, while the intronic enhancer and MAR appear to play a quantitative role in gene expression, these sequences are not absolutely essential for transcriptional activation of rearranged kappa genes in a normal developmental environment."
https://openalex.org/W2021438457,"The E. crassus Tec1 element is present in greater than 10(4) copies in the micronuclear genome but is absent from the macronuclear genome. During formation of a macronucleus from a micronucleus, a majority of the Tec1 elements appear as extrachromosomal circles. The circular and integrated forms of Tec1 have been characterized by restriction mapping to produce consensus maps and by sequence analysis of the element's termini. The circular forms are resistant to BAL31 and have the restriction map expected if the element excises at the end of its inverted repeats. DNA sequence analysis of a circular form confirms that the inverted repeats are in a head-to-head configuration. Excision of Tec1 occurs very early during macronuclear development as the DNA begins to replicate to form polytene chromosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1502486752,"G protein regulation of human platelet membrane phospholipase A2 activity was investigated at pH 8.0 and 9.0 by studying the effects of the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue, guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S), and of F-/Al3+ ions on arachidonic acid (AA) release. The membrane acted as the source of the enzyme, the substrate, and the G protein. At pH 8.0, 10 and 100 microM GTP gamma S stimulated AA mobilization at least 6-fold. Optimum AA release conditions required 1 mM Ca2+ and 5 mM Mg2+. Nonspecific nucleotide effect was excluded since similar stimulatory effects on AA release were not observed by ATP, GTP, ADP, and NADP. Although at pH 9.0 the GTP gamma S-stimulated AA release was greater than at pH 8.0, it constituted only 26% of the total. At both pH values the effect of F- (10 mM) in the presence of Al3+ (2 microM) was similar to that of GTP gamma S. The G protein inhibitor, guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate), inhibited the GTP gamma S-stimulated AA release by about 80% at pH 8.0 and by 100% at pH 9.0. To determine a possible contribution to AA mobilization by the phospholipase C and diacylglycerol lipase pathway, the effects of neomycin, a phospholipase C inhibitor, were investigated. 100 microM neomycin did not inhibit the GTP gamma S-stimulated AA release at pH 8.0 and only slightly so (17%) at pH 9.0. At pH 8.0 in the presence of Ca2+ the released fatty acids consisted mainly of arachidonic and docosahexaenoic acids (80 and 8%, respectively). GTP gamma S had no effect on the fatty acid profile but only on their quantity. These results provide evidence of G protein regulation of phospholipase A2 activity in isolated platelet membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1598576258,"Abstract A 40-kDa protein, in addition to the alpha-subunits of Gs (a GTP-binding protein involved in adenylate cyclase stimulation), was [32P]ADP-ribosylated by cholera toxin (CT) in the membranes of neutrophil-like HL-60 cells, only if formyl Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) was added to the ADP-ribosylation mixture. The 40-kDa protein proved to be the alpha-subunit of Gi serving as the substrate of pertussis toxin, islet-activating protein (IAP). No radioactivity was incorporated into this protein in membranes isolated from HL-60 cells that had been exposed to IAP. Gi-alpha purified from bovine brain and reconstituted into IAP-treated cell membranes was ADP-ribosylated by CT plus fMLP. Gi-alpha was ADP-ribosylated by IAP, but not by CT plus fMLP, in membranes from cells that had been pretreated with CT plus fMLP. When membrane Gi-alpha [32P]ADP-ribosylated by CT plus fMLP or IAP was digested with trypsin, the radiolabeled fragments arising from the two proteins were different from each other. These results suggest that CT ADP-ribosylates Gi-alpha in intact cells when coupled fMLP receptors are stimulated and that the sites modified by two toxins are not identical. CT-induced and fMLP-supported ADP-ribosylation of Gi-alpha was favored by Mg2+ and allow concentrations of GTP or its analogues but suppressed by GDP. The ADP-ribosylation did not occur at all, even in the presence of ADP-ribosylation factor that supported CT-induced modification of Gs, in phospholipid vesicles containing crude membrane extract in which Gi was functionally coupled to stimulated fMLP receptors. Thus, Gi activated via coupled receptors is the real substrate of CT-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation. This reaction may depend on additional factor(s) that are too labile to survive the process of membrane extraction."
https://openalex.org/W1522733450,"Abstract Radioisotopically labeled proteoglycans were isolated from a 4 M guanidine HCl, 2% Triton X-100 extract of corneal stroma from day 18 chicken embryos by anion-exchange chromatography. Two predominant proteoglycans in the sample were separated by octyl-Sepharose chromatography using a gradient elution of detergent in 4 M guanidine HCl. One proteoglycan had an overall mass of approximately 125 kDa, a single dermatan sulfate chain (approximately 85-90% chondroitin 4-sulfate, low iduronate content) of approximately 65 kDa, and a core protein after chondroitinase ABC digestion of approximately 45 kDa which also contained one to three N-linked oligosaccharides and one O-linked oligosaccharide. The other proteoglycan had an overall size of approximately 100 kDa, two to three keratan sulfate chains of approximately 15 kDa each, and a core protein following keratanase digestion of approximately 51 kDa which included two to three N-linked but no O-linked oligosaccharides. A larger size, a greater overall hydrophobicity (as measured by its interaction with octyl-Sepharose) and an absence of O-linked oligosaccharides argue that this core protein is a distinct gene product from the core protein of the dermatan sulfate proteoglycan."
https://openalex.org/W1597898037,"A23187 stimulated two enzymatic activities of human neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes), phospholipase A2 and fatty acyl-CoA acyltransferase, which resulted in a stimulated deacylation/reacylation cycle. The incorporation of fatty acids, other than arachidonic or eicosapentaenoic acid, into diacyl and alkylacyl species of choline phosphoglycerides was stimulated by 10-fold by A23187. These fatty acids were exclusively incorporated into the sn-2 position, and [3H]glycerol labeling showed there was no stimulation of de novo synthesis. A23187 also stimulated fatty acid incorporation into other phospholipids, but de novo synthesis accounted for a portion of this uptake. Inhibitors of protein kinase C prevented the stimulated recycling of phosphatidylcholine, and the simultaneous induction of platelet-activating factor synthesis, by inhibiting phospholipase A2 activation. They inhibited [3H]arachidonate release from prelabeled polymorphonuclear leukocytes, but had no effect on in vitro fatty acyl-CoA acyltransferase or acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase activity. Extracts from A23187-treated cells contained a fatty acyl-CoA acyltransferase, which did not utilize arachidonoyl-CoA, that was 2.3-fold more active than that of control extracts. Phosphatase treatment decreased this stimulated activity by 66%. Thus, A23187 stimulated a phospholipase A2 activity that generated both 1-alkyl and 1-acyl lysophosphatidylcholines. A stimulated acetyltransferase used a portion of the alkyl species for platelet-activating factor synthesis, while the acyl species and residual alkyl species were rapidly reacylated to phosphatidylcholine by a stimulated acyl-transferase. Arachidonate, an eicosanoid precursor, was spared by this process."
https://openalex.org/W1520161056,"Abstract Complexes of agonist-bound muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) and guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) were solubilized and isolated from rat heart. Heart membranes were incubated with mAChR agonists or antagonists, solubilized using digitonin and cholate, and subjected to chromatography over wheat germ agglutinin-Affi-Gel. Eluted fractions were precipitated using a cardiac-selective anti-mAChR antibody (Luetje, C. W., Brumwell, C., Norman, M. G., Peterson, G. L., Schimerlik, M. I., and Nathanson, N. M. (1987) Biochemistry 26, 6892-6898). Using samples obtained from membranes initially incubated with carbachol (10 nM, 100 nM, or 1 mM), G alpha immunoreactivity was detected on Western blots probed using antibodies with specificity for G alpha subunits. The G alpha immunoreactivity was not detected when atropine alone (10 nM or 1 microM) or when excess atropine (1 microM) plus carbachol (100 nM) was used during the membrane preincubation. G beta immunoreactivity, when detectable on Western blots, was present in substoichiometric amounts relative to that of G alpha. The G alpha immunoreactivity was not present if GTP was included during incubation of membranes with agonist and following membrane solubilization. Further results indicate that although agonist binding to receptors is rapidly reversed by GTP or GDP (t1/2 less than 10 min), the mAChR-G protein complex is reversed more slowly or not at all. It was also shown that at high agonist concentrations, the cardiac mAChR interacts with both Go and Gi-like proteins. Together, these results demonstrate the utility of an immunoaffinity approach to the purification and biochemical study of receptor-G protein interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1585041126,"Arg252 of fructose-6-phosphate 1-kinase (PFK) from Bacillus stearothermophilus has been proposed to be involved in the binding of the substrate Fru-6-P. We demonstrate here that mutation of this residue to alanine converts the enzyme to a form with characteristics similar to those of its allosterically tight form. The mutant enzyme exhibits a high affinity for its inhibitor phosphoenolpyruvate (a 68-fold difference compared to wild type) and a dramatically decreased Fru-6-P affinity (1500-fold increase in Km). It is more sensitive to inhibition by high ATP concentrations than the wild type, and this inhibition is relieved by ADP, GDP, or higher Fru-6-P concentrations. In contrast, mutation of Arg252 to lysine increases the affinity of the enzyme for P-enolpyruvate by only 2-fold and increases its Km for Fru-6-P by only 50-fold. Sigmoidal kinetics with respect to Fru-6-P in the presence of P-enolpyruvate were observed with Hill numbers of 2.2, 2.4, and 1.7 for wild-type B. stearothermophilus PFK and the Arg252 to lysine and to alanine mutations, respectively. Unlike fructose-6-phosphate 1-kinase from Escherichia coli, in the absence of P-enolpyruvate, B. stearothermophilus PFK exhibits a hyperbolic profile with respect to Fru-6-P concentration. B. stearothermophilus PFK is sensitive to inhibition by high ATP concentrations and competitively inhibited by GDP or ADP. Our data indicate that Arg252 of B. stearothermophilus PFK plays a major role in both Fru-6-P binding and allosteric interaction between the subunits. However, this residue does not seem to participate directly in the catalytic process."
https://openalex.org/W1538643534,"The conserved Pro43 residue of the uncE protein (subunit c) of the Escherichia coli F1F0-ATPase was changed to Ser or Ala by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, and the mutations were incorporated into the chromosome. The resultant mutant strains were capable of oxidative phosphorylation as indicated by their ability to grow on succinate and had growth yields on glucose that were 80-90% of wild type. Membrane vesicles from the mutants were slightly less efficient than wild type vesicles in ATP-driven proton pumping as indicated by ATP-dependent quenching of quinacrine fluorescence. The decreased quenching response was not due to increased H+ leakiness of the mutant membranes or to loss of F1-ATPase activity from the membrane. These results indicate that the mutant F1F0-ATPases are defective in coupling ATP hydrolysis to H+ translocation. The membrane ATPase activity of the mutants was inhibited less by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide than that of wild type. The decrease in sensitivity to inhibition by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide was caused primarily by dissociation of the F1-ATPase from the mutant F0 in the ATPase assay mixture. These results support the idea that Pro43, and neighboring conserved polar residues play an important role in the binding and functional coupling of F1 to F0. Although a Pro residue is found at position 43 in all species of subunit c studied, surprisingly, it is not absolutely essential to function."
https://openalex.org/W1514275127,"Six human T lymphomas and an NK-like cell line were tested for their ability to produce HILDA, one of the two human growth promoting activities for the DA1.a cells. Among them, the HSB2 cell line turned out to be the only one secreting significant HILDA activity (200-400 units/ml) after activation with 50 nM phorbol myristate acetate. Subclones of the HSB2 cell line were obtained by limiting dilution experiments. One of them (2B3) was found to secrete 1,000-5,000 units/ml of HILDA after phorbol myristate acetate activation in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum and 200-500 units/ml in serum-free conditions. 2B3-HILDA was purified from serum-free conditioned medium by a four-step procedure including fast flow cationic exchange at pH 6, concanavalin A chromatography, reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and gel-filtration high performance liquid chromatography. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the purified radiolabeled cytokine revealed a single band of Mr 43,000, which co-electrophoresed with the biological activity. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the first residues of the protein were determined and found to be similar to the equivalent residues deduced from the molecularly cloned cytokine. Isoelectric point determination revealed some charge heterogeneity of HILDA, which focused to pH 8.5-9 after neuraminidase treatment. Carbohydrate content of the cytokine was studied by deglycosylation experiments which showed that the O-linked oligosaccharides represented 2,000-3,000 and that the N-linked sugars account for half of the apparent molecular weight of HILDA."
https://openalex.org/W1530430498,"We have found that tissue plasminogen activator catalyzes the binding of plasminogen (Pg) to immunoglobulin G (IgG) immobilized on a surface. This enhancement is due to the formation of plasmin, since plasmin treatment of immobilized IgG produced a 20-fold increase in Pg binding. Pg binding is lysine site dependent and reversible. The augmentation of Pg binding by plasmin is specific as other proteases produced significantly less or no effect. Immobilized plasmin-treated IgG also specifically binds Pg in plasma. IgG-immobilized Pg is activated by tissue plasminogen activator, and a significant portion of the plasmin formed remains bound to the IgG. The Pg reactive species in a plasmin-treated IgG digest was identified as the Fab fragment by chromatography utilizing the immobilized high affinity lysine-binding site of plasminogen. Specificity of the interaction was further demonstrated by immunoblot-ligand analysis which demonstrated that the plasmin-derived Fab fragment bound Pg whereas papain-derived Fab or plasmin-derived Fc fragments did not. These data suggest that Pg binds to the new COOH-terminal lysine residue of the plasmin-derived Fab. Pg also binds to an immobilized immune complex following plasmin treatment. These findings indicate that surface-bound IgG localizes plasminogen thus extending the spectrum of activity of the plasmin system to immunologic reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1571154070,"Abstract The thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and 3,3',5-L-triiodothyronine (T3) stimulate plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (EC 3.6.1.3) activity in human erythrocytes by a mechanism independent of the cell nucleus. The current studies were conducted to determine the effect of retinoic acid on the extranuclear activation by T4 and T3 of Ca2+-ATPase in the human red cell. The retinoid inhibited basal and T4-stimulatable activity of that enzyme in a dose-dependent manner. At the highest tested concentration (10(-6) M), retinoic acid inhibited basal enzyme activity by 25% and T4-stimulated activity by 72%. A concentration as low as 5 x 10(-10) M retinoic acid shifted the dose-response curve of both T4 and T3 so that the concentration of each associated with maximal enzyme stimulation was 10(-9) M instead of 10(-10) M. Retinoic acid displaced [125I]T4 binding to red cell membranes as effectively as unlabeled T4. Retinol failed to influence either basal or T4-stimulated enzyme activity or to displace T4 binding. These results indicate that retinoic acid can partially block the T4 and T3 stimulation of Ca2+-ATPase in human red cell membranes and suggest a physiologic role for the retinoid as a modulator of this peripheral action of thyroid hormone. They suggest that the red cell membrane is an important site of action for this active retinoid."
https://openalex.org/W1500979731,"Prepro-thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) contains five TRH progenitor sequences and at least six other potential peptides (Lechan, R. M., Wu, P., Jackson, I. M. D., Wolf, H., Cooperman, S., Mandel, G., and Goodman, R. H. (1986a) Science 231, 159-161). Previous studies using radioimmunoassays developed against discrete regions of prepro-TRH have demonstrated that several of the potential peptides are present in rat brain and pancreas (Wu, P., Lechan, R. M., and Jackson, I. M. D. (1987) Endocrinology 121, 108-115; Wu, P. and Jackson, I. M. D. (1988a) Brain Res. 456, 22-28; Wu, P., and Jackson, I. M. D. (1988b) Regul. Pept. 22, 347-360). However, the low level of peptides present in intact tissues has made isolation of the peptides difficult. CA77 cells, a medullary thyroid carcinoma cell line, also express prepro-TRH and display processing similar to that found in tissues. However, peptide content in this tumor cell line is enhanced only 3-fold compared with normal tissues (Sevarino, K. A., Wu, P., Jackson, I. M. D., Roos, B. A., Mandel, G., and Goodman, R. H. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 620-623). To achieve higher levels of expression for facilitating peptide sequencing studies and to see if alternate processing of prepro-TRH could be detected in different cell types, we transfected into 3T3, GH4, AtT20, and RIN 5F cells a cDNA vector under control of the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter. 3T3 and GH4 cells failed to process prepro-TRH beyond cleavage of the signal sequence. Both AtT20 and RIN 5F cells efficiently cleaved the precursor at dibasic sites to generate mature TRH and the non-TRH peptides previously identified in vivo. Peptide content was up to 30 times greater than in hypothalamic extracts and 10 times greater than in CA77 cells. Secretion experiments with transfected AtT20 cells demonstrated that both mature TRH and the non-TRH peptides were secreted via a regulated secretory pathway similar to that utilized by endogenously synthesized peptides. We isolated several of the non-TRH peptides synthesized by transfected AtT20 cells and characterized these peptides by sequential Edman degradation. These studies identified the signal sequence cleavage site and determined that the non-TRH peptides are generated by cleavage at the dibasic sites flanking the five TRH progenitor sequences. Further, we determined that processing occurs at the Arg51-Arg52 site located in the amino-terminal portion of the precursor, the only dibasic site not flanking a TRH progenitor sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1554059072,"Platelet-activating factor (l-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine; PAF) enhances the release of newly synthesized PAF as measured by [3H]acetate incorporation into PAF in human neutrophils. The response was dose-dependent, rapid, transient, and inhibitable by the PAF antagonist BN-52021. The non-metabolizahle bioactive PAF analogue (C-PAF) but not lyso-PAF enhances the release of newly synthesized PAF. Newly synthesized PAF was also released after stimulation of these cells with fMet-Leu-Phe. The human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor potentiates the stimulated release of PAF. The intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA inhibits the rise of [Ca2+]i and the release of PAF but not the Na+/H+antiport activity. PAF release, but not the rise in the intracellular concentration of free calcium, was inhibited in pertussis toxin-treated neutrophils stimulated with PAF. The release of PAF in pertussis toxin-treated cells was also inhibited in cells stimulated with fMet-Leu-Phe or opsonized zymosan. These results suggest that functional pertussis toxin-sensitive guanine nucleotide regulatory protein and/or one or more of the changes produced by phospholipase C activation are necessary for PAF release produced by physiological stimuli. It appears that PAF release requires a coordinated action of receptor-coupled G-proteins, calcium, and other parameters."
https://openalex.org/W1518025416,"Abstract We have isolated clones representing at least three nuclear genes for mitochondrial ribosomal proteins from Neurospora crassa by screening a lambda gt11 cDNA library with an antiserum against a mixture of these proteins. The cDNA and genomic DNA sequence for one of these genes, mrp-3, was determined. The MRP3 protein was purified by immune-affinity chromatography, using a monoclonal antibody probe, and subjected to amino acid sequence analysis to identify the mature amino terminus and a prospective mitochondrial-targeting presequence. MRP3 was identified as the largest, least basic protein detected from the small subunit of ribosomes which had been salt-washed and fractionated on sucrose gradients. However, the mRNA and protein products of mrp-3 were found to be present in excess over those of other N. crassa mitoribosomal protein genes. Using a solution hybridization/S1 nuclease assay, we found three-fold- more mRNA for mrp-3 than for another mito-ribosomal protein gene. In addition, a 30- to 50-fold excess of non-ribosomal MRP3 protein was discovered. The additional protein was localized in mitochondrial membrane fractions; none was detected in matrix fractions after removal of the ribosomes. An immunologically related protein was detected in ribosome and membrane fractions of mitochondria from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The functional significance of this dual localization remains an enigma."
https://openalex.org/W1485243937,"The U3 region of mouse intracisternal A-particle (IAP) long terminal repeats (LTRs) contains several nuclear protein-binding domains. Two of these contain sequences with homology to the SV40 enhancer core. We refer to these two domains as Enh1 and Enh2. The Enh2 domain is an important determinant of promoter activity in vivo. We report here the isolation of nuclear fractions from human 293 and mouse MOPC-315 cells which interact with Enh1 and Enh2. Purification was achieved via DNA-affinity chromatography on a multimerized oligonucleotide representing the Enh2 region from the LTR of the mouse genomic IAP element, MIA14. Glycerol gradient sedimentation suggested a native Mr of approximately 80-100 for the binding component(s) in both crude and affinity-purified fractions. UV cross-linking showed that the binding activity involved two polypeptides within this size range. The affinity-isolated fraction from each cell line was highly purified, as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and in vitro binding analysis. Exonuclease III footprinting showed that the two polypeptides interacted preferentially with the Enh1 and Enh2 domains within a 139-base pair segment from the MIA14 LTR. The polypeptides interacted in a sequence-specific manner with oligonucleotides representing these domains within the IAP LTR and with oligonucleotides containing the enhancer core sequence from SV40 and polyoma virus. Equilibrium binding studies indicated that the apparent dissociation constants for the polypeptides binding to the enhancer core sequence from MIA14, SV40, and polyoma virus were similar. Therefore, this affinity-purified fraction may represent a novel enhancer core-binding component which is distinct from the previously characterized rat CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein, C/EBP."
https://openalex.org/W1557421591,"The catabolic NAD-specific glutamate dehydrogenase of Neurospora crassa is one of the many enzymes regulated by carbon catabolite repression. To achieve an understanding of its regulation, cDNA and genomic clones were isolated. Total poly(A+) RNA from derepressed cells was used for the construction of a cDNA library in the expression vector, λgt11. By screening this library with a polyclonal antiserum against NAD-specific glutamate dehydrogenase, a positive clone with a 0.9-kilobase insert was isolated and the insert DNA sequenced. The insert was shown to code for approximately one-third of the known amino acid sequence, close to the carboxyl terminus. Using this truncated cDNA as a probe, the structural gene was shown to be transcriptionally activated approximately 60-fold during derepression, producing an ∼4.7-kilobase mRNA transcript. N. crassa genomic clones, hybridizing to this cDNA probe, were isolated and the structural gene (on two BamHI fragments) was subcloned in pUC13."
https://openalex.org/W1519486794,"Abstract Cys674 of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase was selectively labeled with N-iodoacetyl-N'-(5-sulfo-1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine without a loss of the catalytic activity, and the steady-state fluorescence anisotropy of this label and its total fluorescence intensity were followed throughout the catalytic cycle. At 25 degrees C, the anisotropy and the total fluorescence intensity increased by 2.1 and 9.4%, respectively, upon Ca2+ binding to the high affinity sites. Upon subsequent ATP binding to the catalytic site, the anisotropy and the total fluorescence intensity decreased by 6.8 and 23.9%, respectively. These drops likely occurred in the enzyme.ATP complex. The extents of changes upon additions of Ca2+ and ATP in the anisotropy, but not in the total fluorescence intensity, were greatly reduced by lowering the temperature. Slight drops in the anisotropy and the total fluorescence intensity occurred upon conversion of phosphoenzyme (EP) from the ADP-sensitive form to the ADP-insensitive form. The anisotropy and the total fluorescence intensity returned to the initial level when EP was hydrolyzed. Mg2+-dependent Pi-induced drops in the anisotropy and the total fluorescence intensity occurred coincidently with EP formation from Pi. These demonstrate that the ATP-induced drops in the anisotropy and the total fluorescence intensity are predominant throughout the catalytic cycle. Most probably, the changes in the anisotropy are due to changes in the rotational diffusion of the label. These findings indicate that ATP binding to the catalytic site induces a relaxed conformation in the microenvironment of the label bound to Cys674."
https://openalex.org/W1507887870,"Abstract Four proteases have been used to assess the topology of the H+-ATPase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae reconstituted into phosphatidylserine vesicles. Limited proteolysis by trypsin and alpha-chymotrypsin inactivates the enzyme and produces stable, membrane-bound fragments. Sequence analyses of these peptides have located the peptide bonds hydrolyzed. The labile bonds are on opposite sides of a central hydrophilic domain containing consensus sequences for the site of phosphorylation and fluorescein isothiocyanate binding of several related ATPases. Limited proteolysis of the ATPase by elastase cuts approximately 50 amino acids from the C terminus, leaving the remaining membrane-bound fragments active. Proteolysis by carboxypeptidase Y in the presence and absence of detergent suggests that the C terminus is on the inside of the vesicle in this reconstitution. A model for the transmembrane arrangement of the polypeptide is proposed. In this model, the C terminus is on the inside of the vesicle, the N terminus is on the outside, the ATP binding region is on the outside, and the polypeptide passes through the membrane a minimum of five times."
https://openalex.org/W2056009909,"IP(s)3, a metabolically stable analog of 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate (IP3), inhibited action potential firing when injected into hippocampal pyramidal cells. This effect was associated with decreased input resistance, a more negative resting potential, outward rectification at depolarized potentials, and an afterhyperpolarization. The response to IP(s)3 was unaffected by antagonists of Na+, Ca2+, and Cl- conductances, but was sensitive to changes in extracellular K+ concentration. The IP(s)3-induced conductance was voltage-dependent, was activated in 10 ms with depolarization, and was blocked by extracellular Ba2+ or intracellular Ca2+ chelation. It was not suppressed by other K+ conductance antagonists. Thus, IP(s)3 may activate a novel K+ conductance in CA1 pyramidal cells. IP3 itself did not elicit this conductance, suggesting it may be rapidly metabolized in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1522975735,"Proteinase A, a yeast aspartyl protease that is highly homologous to the mammalian lysosomal aspartyl protease, cathepsin D, was expressed in Xenopus oocytes and its biosynthesis and post-translational modifications were characterized. While 29-45% of the proteinase A was secreted from oocytes, approximately 37% of the cell-associated proteinase A underwent proteolytic cleavage, characteristic of delivery to a lysosomal organelle. Although proteinase A is not targeted to the yeast vacuole by a mannose 6-phosphate receptor-dependent pathway, 2-5% of the proteinase A molecules expressed in oocytes bound to a Man-6-P receptor column. However, analysis of its [2-3H]mannose-labeled oligosaccharides revealed that 14-23% of these units contain phosphomannosyl residues. A hybrid molecule (H6), in which the propiece and first 12 amino acids of proteinase A were changed to the cathepsin D sequence, was also expressed in oocytes. The binding of H6 to the Man-6-P receptor was approximately 12-fold greater than observed for proteinase A. This increased level of receptor binding could be accounted for by three factors: 1) a small increase in the total amount of phosphorylated oligosaccharides, 2) an increase in the number of oligosaccharides which acquire two phosphomonoesters, and 3) the presence of a greater percentage of oligosaccharides with one phosphomonoester which exhibit high affinity binding to the Man-6-P receptor. These results demonstrate that proteinase A is recognized by UDP-GlcNAc:lysosomal enzyme N-acetylglucosaminylphosphotransferase. However, this interaction is altered by the addition of cathepsin D sequences, resulting in the generation of a higher affinity ligand for binding to the Man-6-P receptor."
