https://openalex.org/W2129316761,Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) has been shown to have certain catabolic effects on fat cells and whole animals. An induction of TNF-alpha messenger RNA expression was observed in adipose tissue from four different rodent models of obesity and diabetes. TNF-alpha protein was also elevated locally and systemically. Neutralization of TNF-alpha in obese fa/fa rats caused a significant increase in the peripheral uptake of glucose in response to insulin. These results indicate a role for TNF-alpha in obesity and particularly in the insulin resistance and diabetes that often accompany obesity.
https://openalex.org/W1981165639,"Carbon monoxide, an activator of guanylyl cyclase, is formed by the action of the enzyme heme oxygenase. By in situ hybridization in brain slices, discrete neuronal localization of messenger RNA for the constitutive form of heme oxygenase throughout the brain has been demonstrated. This localization is essentially the same as that for soluble guanylyl cyclase messenger RNA. In primary cultures of olfactory neurons, zinc protoporphyrin-9, a potent selective inhibitor of heme oxygenase, depletes endogenous guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP). Thus, carbon monoxide, like nitric oxide, may be a physiologic regulator of cGMP. These findings, together with the neuronal localizations of heme oxygenase, suggest that carbon monoxide may function as a neurotransmitter."
https://openalex.org/W2092312916,"A variety of tumors are potentially immunogenic but do not stimulate an effective anti-tumor immune response in vivo. Tumors may be capable of delivering antigen-specific signals to T cells, but may not deliver the costimulatory signals necessary for full activation of T cells. Expression of the costimulatory ligand B7 on melanoma cells was found to induce the rejection of a murine melanoma in vivo. This rejection was mediated by CD8+ T cells; CD4+ T cells were not required. These results suggest that B7 expression renders tumor cells capable of effective antigen presentation, leading to their eradication in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1496717884,"Macrophages can become activated to kill both tumor cells and a variety of microbes. Results here show that synthesis of nitric oxide (NO), a mediator of many macrophage cytotoxic functions, was greatly increased when cells of the mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 were costimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), compared to LPS alone. This increase paralleled increases in cytotoxicity. Northern analysis showed that increased production of NO was preceded by markedly enhanced expression of mRNA for the inducible form of macrophage NO synthase (mac-NOS), which catalyzes the synthesis of NO. Cycloheximide inhibited the induction of mac-NOS mRNA by IFN-gamma and LPS, indicating that expression of this mRNA required de novo protein synthesis. Elevated expression of mac-NOS mRNA was not due to an increase in its stability. Rather, the combination of IFN-gamma and LPS induced a much higher rate of transcription of the mac-NOS gene than did stimulation with LPS alone. These results provide one explanation of why priming and triggering stimuli, such as IFN-gamma and LPS, respectively, synergistically activate macrophages and may be applicable to explaining how IFN-gamma augments NO-dependent microbicidal activity in macrophages as well."
https://openalex.org/W1479762169,"Water channels provide the plasma membranes of red cells and renal proximal tubules with high permeability to water, thereby permitting water to move in the direction of an osmotic gradient. Molecular identification of CHIP28 protein as the membrane water channel was first accomplished by measurement of osmotic swelling of Xenopus oocytes injected with CHIP28 RNA (Preston, G.M., Carroll, T.P., Guggino, W.B., and Agre, P. (1992) Science 256, 385-387). Since water channels are pharmacologically inhibited by submillimolar concentrations of Hg2+, site-directed mutagenesis was undertaken to demonstrate which of the 4 cysteines (87, 102, 152, or 189) is the Hg(2+)-sensitive residue in the CHIP28 molecule. Each cysteine was individually replaced by serine, and oocytes expressing each of the four mutants exhibited osmotic water permeability (Pf) equivalent to wild-type CHIP28. After incubation in HgCl2, all were significantly inhibited, except C189S exists as a multisubunit complex in the native membrane; however, although oocytes injected with mixed CHIP28 and C189S RNAs exhibited Pf corresponding to the sum of their individual activities, exposure to Hg2+ only reduced the Pf to the level of the C189S mutant. Of the six substitutions at residue 189, only the serine and alanine mutants exhibited increased Pf and had glycosylation patterns resembling wild-type CHIP28 on immunoblots. These studies demonstrated: (i) CHIP28 water channel activity is retained despite substitution of individual cysteines with serine; (ii) cysteine 189 is the Hg(2+)-sensitive residue; (iii) the subunits of the CHIP28 complex are individually active water pores; (iv) residue 189 is critical to proper processing of the CHIP28 protein."
https://openalex.org/W1496789829,"Stimulation of nitric oxide (NO) synthase in endothelial cells by Ca2+ influx leads to increased intracellular levels of cGMP. NO synthase from various sources is known to use tetrahydrobiopterin, flavins, and NADPH as cofactors. We studied the effect of interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and lipopolysaccharide on tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthetic activities in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). These stimuli led to an up to 40-fold increase of GTP cyclohydrolase I (EC 3.5.4.16) activity and to increased accumulation of neopterin and tetrahydrobiopterin in HUVEC. Further enzyme activities of tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthesis, i.e. 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase and sepiapterin reductase (EC 1.1.1.153), remained unchanged. NO synthase activity in protein fractions from homogenates of cells treated with interferon-gamma plus tumor necrosis factor-alpha was not influenced as compared with untreated controls. However, interferon-gamma alone or in combination with tumor necrosis factor-alpha significantly increased intracellular cGMP formation in intact HUVEC by 50 and 80%, respectively. These stimuli increased intracellular tetrahydrobiopterin concentrations up to 14-fold. NO-triggered cGMP formation was similarly increased by incubation of otherwise untreated cells with sepiapterin, leading to elevated intracellular tetrahydrobiopterin levels. Thus, cytokines indirectly stimulate the activity of constitutive NO synthase in HUVEC by upregulating production of the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin."
https://openalex.org/W1523858318,"Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a regulated Cl- channel; in secretory epithelia, it is located in the apical membrane where it regulates transepithelial Cl- secretion. Previous studies have shown that cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) can phosphorylate and activate CFTR Cl- channels. We asked whether other kinases would phosphorylate CFTR in vitro and activate CFTR Cl- channels in excised, inside-out patches of membrane from NIH 3T3 fibroblasts stably expressing recombinant CFTR. We found that both Ca(2+)-independent and Ca(2+)-dependent isoforms of protein kinase C (PKC) activated the CFTR Cl- channel. Consistent with this finding, PKC also phosphorylated CFTR in vitro. In contrast, the multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase failed to either activate or to phosphorylate CFTR Cl- channels, suggesting that this enzyme has no direct effect on CFTR. We found that cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGK) (purified from bovine lung) phosphorylated CFTR in vitro. However, cGMP failed to increase the apical membrane Cl- permeability in human airway epithelia, and addition of cGMP, ATP, and cGK failed to activate CFTR Cl- channels. These results suggest that if cGK phosphorylates CFTR in vivo, it does so at sites not involved in CFTR Cl- channel activation. Because cAMP-dependent activation of CFTR Cl- channels and Cl- secretion in intact cells is reversible, we asked whether specific phosphatases can dephosphorylate and inactivate CFTR Cl- channels. Addition of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) decreased PKA-activated current by 67% within 10 min. The phosphatase inhibitor calyculin-A blocked the effect of PP2A. In contrast, neither protein phosphatases 1, 2B, nor two preparations of alkaline phosphatase inactivated PKA-phosphorylated CFTR Cl- channels. The effects of protein phosphatases on CFTR function were paralleled by their ability to dephosphorylate CFTR in vitro. Our data indicate that CFTR Cl- channels can be phosphorylated and activated by PKA as well as by Ca(2+)-dependent and Ca(2+)-independent isoforms of PKC and can be dephosphorylated and thus inactivated by PP2A."
https://openalex.org/W1496281435,"This paper reports an investigation on the minimal requirements for induction of the mitochondrial cyclosporin A-sensitive permeability transition pore (MTP). Energized rat liver mitochondria incubated in sucrose medium take up a Ca2+ pulse but do not show activation of the MTP upon addition of fully uncoupling concentrations of carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxy-phenyl hydrazone (FCCP). Yet, addition of ruthenium red immediately prior to FCCP or inclusion of acetate or low concentrations of phosphate in the incubation medium restore the ability of FCCP to trigger MTP opening. Since ruthenium red, phosphate, or acetate do not induce the MTP per se, they must act upon some additional factor(s) that counteract the increase of pore open probability induced by membrane depolarization (Bernardi, P. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 8834-8839). We show that two key factors determining the overall probability of pore opening are matrix pH and matrix [Ca2+] when the membrane is depolarized. Indeed, in the absence of ruthenium red, phosphate, or acetate the addition of FCCP is followed by fast Ca2+ efflux on the uniporter mirrored by intense matrix acidification following compensatory H+ influx via FCCP. Ruthenium red prevents both Ca2+ efflux and matrix acidification, acetate mainly prevents matrix acidification, and phosphate both slows down Ca2+ efflux and prevents matrix acidification. Taken together, our data indicate that membrane depolarization is both necessary and sufficient to trigger MTP opening when matrix acidification and rapid Ca2+ efflux are prevented. Thus, the wide variety of MTP inducing agents may largely reflect the wide variety of the possible combinatorial effects on the minimal requirements for MTP operation."
https://openalex.org/W1514486148,"Three aspects of the regulation of the human alpha-skeletal actin gene are examined in this study by quantitative analysis of transgenic tissues: level of expression, tissue specificity, and developmental regulation. Previous in vitro and in vivo studies analyzing the 5' end of the gene have indicated that regulation of tissue-specific expression is promoter based. Transgenic mice were produced carrying either a 9.5-kilobase pair (kb) human alpha-skeletal actin gene fragment or a deletion construct with 2.2-kb of 5' sequences of human alpha-skeletal actin linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene. We found that the 9.5-kb transgene was capable of expression in adult skeletal muscle at a level equivalent to that of the endogenous gene in a non-transgenic mouse. The deletion construct was also capable of high-level expression. Both transgenes were expressed in a striated muscle-specific manner and were correctly regulated during development. We conclude that these three parameters of regulation of the human alpha-skeletal actin gene are mediated by sequences within the region -2000 to +239 of the promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1586441814,"We have examined the subcellular distribution of three subtypes of adrenergic receptor by immunocytochemical localization of wild-type and epitope-tagged proteins expressed in Cos-7 and K293 cells. Two subtypes (beta 2 and M alpha 2-10H) are localized in the plasma membrane at steady state in untreated cells, while another subtype (M alpha 2-4H) is found both in the plasma membrane and in a population of intracellular vesicles. Within 15 min following the addition of adrenergic agonists, beta 2 and M alpha 2-10H receptors are differentially sorted; beta 2 receptors are selectively internalized to intracellular vesicles, which are distinct from those containing M alpha 2-4H receptors, while M alpha 2-10H receptors remain in the plasma membrane. Subtype-specific sorting suggests a new class of functional properties that may differentiate the signaling and regulation of homologous G protein-coupled receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1599388734,"There is growing evidence for the direct role of P-glycoprotein mediating multidrug resistance in tumor cells. P-glycoprotein is thought to function as an energy-dependent drug efflux pump. The monoclonal antibody MRK-16 binds to an external domain of P-glycoprotein and partially inhibits drug efflux in multidrug-resistant cells. As an approach toward elucidating the mechanism by which MRK-16 affects drug transport, we undertook the definition of the precise binding site of this antibody. In this study we have mapped the epitope of MRK-16 monoclonal antibody to a resolution of a single amino acid using a series of overlapping synthetic peptides. We demonstrate that MRK-16 recognizes only the class I isoform (MDR1) of human P-glycoprotein and that its epitope encompasses at least two (first and fourth) of the six predicted extracellular peptide loops. These results suggest that the epitope of MRK-16 is discontinuous and that the sequences involved which are separated by about 625 amino acids in the linear sequence must be spatially situated in close proximity in the native protein. Based on these results, we present a model for transmembrane alpha-helical packing of P-glycoprotein in the lipid bilayer. This may have implications for understanding the function of P-glycoprotein in drug transport."
https://openalex.org/W1526272699,"Disproportionating enzyme (D-enzyme, 4-alpha-glucanotransferase; EC 2.4.1.25) has been purified to homogeneity from potato tubers and its activity characterized. The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of maltooligosaccharides from one 1,4-alpha-D-glucan molecule to another, or to glucose. Maltooligosaccharides are effective donor molecules, but short chain amylose and amylopectin may also function as donors. Enzyme activity is not affected by inorganic phosphate, 3-phosphoglycerate, or hexose phosphates. A cDNA clone encoding the enzyme was isolated using oligonucleotide probes derived from partial peptide sequences of the purified enzyme. The identity of the cDNA clone was confirmed by expression in Escherichia coli resulting in D-enzyme activity. The amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA shows significant homology with a 4-alpha-glucanotransferase from Streptococcus. The deduced sequence indicates the presence of an amino-terminal plastid transit peptide of 52 amino acid residues and a mature polypeptide of 524 residues. D-enzyme mRNA is present in leaves, stems, roots, and stolons but is most abundant in developing and mature tubers. The amount of mRNA in leaves increases in response to light and to sucrose added to the medium. These results are discussed in terms of the function of D-enzyme in potato starch metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1590353710,"Chimeric receptors were generated in which structurally defined subdomains of the insulin receptor (IR) and insulin growth factor-I receptor (IGF-1R) alpha-subunits were exchanged between their respective receptor backbone structures. Upon expression in human fibroblasts, nine IR/IGF-1R chimeras were transported to the cell surface, where they formed binding sites with differential properties. One IGF-1R/IR chimera (C3') exhibited to some extent high insulin specificity, demonstrating the presence of major insulin binding determinants within the amino acid 325-524 region of the IR alpha-subunit. Complementation of this region with subdomain 1 (amino acids 1-137) reconstituted full insulin binding potential within an IGF-1R framework. In addition, both the IGF-1R/IR C3' chimera and another chimera (C13') displayed high affinity binding properties for IGF-1, which suggests distinct locations for major insulin and IGF-1 binding determinants in their respective receptors, in agreement with our previous findings (Schumacher, R., Mosthaf, L., Schlessinger, J., Brandenburg, D., and Ullrich, A. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 19288-19295). The binding characteristics of all receptor chimeras correlated directly with the ability of the ligands to regulate their tyrosine kinase activity in intact cells. These results demonstrate direct coupling of ligand binding affinity and capacity for tyrosine kinase activation."
https://openalex.org/W1551176885,"The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) is a cell surface receptor that binds and internalizes several macromolecules including apolipoprotein E-enriched remnant lipoproteins and protease/antiprotease complexes such as activated alpha 2-macroglobulin. Its function has been studied primarily in cultured fibroblasts and in liver. In the current studies, we provide evidence that LRP is present on the surface of primary adipocytes isolated from rat epididymal fat pads. The activity of the receptor increases 2-3-fold within minutes after the adipocytes are exposed to physiological concentrations of insulin as indicated by an increase in the uptake of 125I-labeled activated alpha 2-macroglobulin. There is a corresponding increase in the uptake of [3H]cholesteryl esters from radiolabeled apoE-enriched beta-very low density lipoprotein. The latter uptake was inhibited by an antibody against LRP and by a fusion protein containing the 39-kDa protein, also called receptor-associated protein, a known inhibitor of LRP function. In vivo, rats that had been fed ad libitum accumulated approximately 24-fold more chylomicron cholesteryl esters in their epididymal fat pads than did fasted control animals. We suggest that insulin stimulation of LRP, in a synergistic action with lipoprotein lipase, increases the endocytic uptake of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides from remnant lipoproteins in postprandial adipocytes."

https://openalex.org/W1536958645,"We have isolated a 2287-bp cDNA encoding the 61-kDa calmodulin-stimulated cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (CaM PDE) from a bovine brain library. A large open reading frame within the cDNA encodes a 530-residue polypeptide which is identical to the sequence of the purified protein previously determined by direct amino acid sequencing. Moreover, COS cells transfected with the cDNA express a cAMP and cGMP hydrolytic activity that is stimulated by calcium and calmodulin, confirming that the cDNA represents a mRNA species encoding a CaM PDE isozyme. RNase protection analyses indicate that either 61-kDa CaM PDE mRNA or structurally related transcripts encoding different CaM PDE isoforms are expressed in a tissue-specific manner. Total RNA isolated from brain (cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, hippocampus, cerebellum, and medulla/spinal cord), heart, aorta, liver, kidney outer medulla, kidney papilla, trachea, and lung completely protected a 410-base antisense riboprobe corresponding to sequence encoding a portion of the catalytic domain. Little or no protection was detected using adrenal cortex, adrenal medulla, liver, kidney cortex, spleen, or T-lymphocyte total RNA. Only brain RNA completely protected a 240-base antisense riboprobe corresponding to the 61-kDa CaM PDE amino terminus encompassing a putative calmodulin-binding domain. However, heart, aorta, liver, kidney, trachea, and lung RNA protected 150 bases of this riboprobe suggesting that these tissues express an isoform structurally related to the 61-kDa CaM PDE. Northern analysis of mRNA isolated from brain, heart, aorta, liver, kidney, lung, and trachea revealed that the cDNA hybridizes with a 3.8- and a 4.4-kb (kilobase) mRNA species. Interestingly, Northern blots of bovine cerebral cortex and heart mRNA probed under stringent conditions with antisense transcripts corresponding to either the 5'- or 3'-untranslated sequence of the 61-kDa CaM PDE cDNA hybridized with only the 4.4-kb mRNA from both tissues. Since different, yet structurally similar CaM PDE isoforms are expressed in brain and in heart, this result, in addition to the RNase protection data, is consistent with the idea that the mRNAs encoding these two CaM PDE isoforms are products of an alternately spliced gene."
https://openalex.org/W1511830885,"Serine phosphorylation of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) has been shown to alter its affinity for the insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I and IGF-II) and to modify its capacity to modulate cellular responses to the IGFs. Because of this, we determined the sites of serine phosphorylation. Purification of 32P-labeled IGFBP-1 was followed by digestion with trypsin and endoproteinase Glu-C and radiosequencing of labeled peptides. Three serines were found to be phosphorylated, with Ser101, Ser119, and Ser169 containing 70%, 5%, and 25% of the incorporated 32P, respectively. A mutated IGFBP-1, substituting alanine for serine at positions 98 and 101, was expressed in CHO cells. On nondenaturing gels, the wild type protein migrated as five isoforms (one non-phosphorylated and four phosphorylated). However, in the mutated protein, the most rapidly migrating band (a phosphorylated form) was not present. The cells containing the mutated cDNA incorporated 60% less 32P into immunoprecipitable IGFBP-1. The mutated protein had a 3-fold reduction in affinity for IGF-I compared to the wild type protein. We conclude that Ser101 represents the major site of phosphorylation containing 63% of the total 32P incorporated and that phosphorylation of Ser101 is important for maintenance of high affinity binding for this growth factor."
https://openalex.org/W1623258939,"Osteoclast precursors selectively attach to bone and differentiate into multinucleated cells that function to remodel and resorb it. We have shown previously that attachment of osteoclasts to bone and subsequent resorption are mediated by the integrin alpha v beta 3. 1 alpha,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) enhances osteoclast precursor differentiation in vivo by mechanisms that are still not clearly understood but entail enhanced attachment of cells to bone. This observation raises the possibility that at least one component of vitamin D-induced osteoclast precursor differentiation involves modulation of integrin expression. To test if the steroid modulates the osteoclast integrin alpha v beta 3 (the vitronectin receptor), we examined the effects of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on transcription of the alpha v gene as well as surface expression and function of alpha v beta 3, in chicken osteoclast precursors. Treatment of the cells with 1,25-(OH)2D3 led to a progressive dose-dependent increase in steady state alpha v mRNA levels with enhanced expression evident within 24 h. The effect was receptor-mediated as indicated by the effects of other vitamin D analogs. The increase in alpha v mRNA levels did not reflect decreased message degradation but, as demonstrated by nuclear run-on experiments, was due to accelerated rates of transcription. Most importantly, induction of alpha v mRNA by 1,25-(OH)2D3 was mirrored by higher levels of expression of alpha v beta 3 on the cell surface, as well enhanced attachment to its substrate, vitronectin."
https://openalex.org/W1611881058,"The monoclonal antibody (mAb) 21A6, which specifically inhibits yeast DNA primase activity, has been used to verify whether only one of the two polypeptides of heterodimeric DNA primase (48 and 58 kDa) was responsible for DNA primase function in vitro. Immunoaffinity chromatography of a crude extract from cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae on a mAb 21A6 protein A-Sepharose 6B column allowed the purification of the p48 primase polypeptide in an isolated form. This polypeptide was not derived through the dissociation of the four-subunit DNA polymerase alpha-primase complex, which can be purified from the same extract by affinity chromatography with a mAb recognizing the DNA polymerase alpha polypeptide. Therefore, free p48 was already present in the yeast extract and, possibly, within the cell. Isolated p48, devoid of any detectable p58 subunit, was sufficient for RNA primer synthesis, although free primase appeared to extend RNA primer-monomers to primer-multimers less efficiently. Primase activity associated with free p48 was highly unstable, indicating that although p48 bears the catalytic site, its association with the other polypeptides of the polymerase-primase complex plays an important role in stabilizing enzyme activity."
https://openalex.org/W1521293107,"Thermal stability of the pore-forming domain of colicin A was studied by high sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry and circular dichroism spectroscopy. In the pH range between 8 and 5, the thermal denaturation of the protein in solution occurs at 66-69 degrees C and is characterized by the calorimetric enthalpy of approximately 90 kcal/M. At pH below 5, there is a rapid pH-dependent destabilization of the pore-forming domain resulting in the lowering of the midpoint denaturation temperature and a decrease in the calorimetric enthalpy of denaturation. Circular dichroism spectra in the near and far ultraviolet show that the thermotropic transition is associated with collapse of the native tertiary structure of the pore-forming domain, although a large proportion of the helical secondary structure remains preserved. The present data indicate some similarity also between acid-induced and temperature-induced denaturation of the pore-forming domain of colicin A. Association of the pore-forming domain with phospholipid vesicles of dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol results in total disappearance of the calorimetric transition, even at pH values as high as 7. Since lipid binding also induces collapse of the near ultraviolet circular dichroism spectrum, these data indicate that interaction with the membrane facilitates a conformational change within the pore-forming domain to a looser (denaturated-like) state. These findings are discussed in relation to the recent model (van der Goot, F. G., Gonzalez-Manas, J. M., Lakey, J. H., Pattus, F. (1991) Nature 354, 408-410) which postulates that a flexible molten globule state is an intermediate on the pathway to membrane insertion of colicin A."
https://openalex.org/W1586627930,"Previous studies have documented that streptozotocin-induced insulin deficiency results in a marked decrease in adipose tissue GLUT4 glucose transporter mRNA levels (Sivitz, W.I., DeSautel, S.L., Kayano, T., Bell, G.I., and Pessin, J.E. (1989) Nature 340, 72-74). In this study, nuclear run-on analysis performed on diabetic and insulin-treated diabetic rats demonstrated that the decrease in GLUT4 mRNA occurs via a diabetes-induced decrease in GLUT4 transcription rate. The decrease in GLUT4 mRNA levels could be prevented by treatment of the diabetic animals with the adenosine receptor agonist phenylisopropyl-adenosine (PIA). Under these conditions, PIA completely blocked the elevation of intracellular cAMP levels associated with insulin deficiency. Surprisingly, isolation of primary rat adipocytes from control animals resulted in a rapid decrease (approximately 20-fold) in GLUT4 mRNA levels by 24 h with a concomitant increase (approximately 70-fold) in GLUT1 mRNA levels. This rapid loss of GLUT4 expression did not correlate with changes in adipocyte cAMP levels and was not prevented by treatment of the cells with either insulin and/or PIA. These data demonstrate that the decrease in GLUT4 transcription induced by insulin deficiency in vivo predominantly results from an increase in intracellular cAMP levels. In contrast, although GLUT4 transcription also decreases in adipocytes when removed from their normal physiological environment, this occurs independent of changes in cAMP levels."

https://openalex.org/W1561101579,"Abstract The leukocyte integrin p150,95 (CD11c/CD18) is involved in a number of cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions and mediates signal transduction into the cytoplasm. p150,95 is expressed on cells of the myeloid lineage as well as on certain activated T and B lymphocytes, and its expression is regulated during cell activation and differentiation. Since CD18 is expressed on all leukocyte lineages, the restricted expression of p150,95 must be controlled at the level of CD11c gene transcription. To understand the mechanisms that direct the constitutive and regulated leukocyte expression of p150,95 we have structurally characterized the CD11c promoter region and initiated its functional dissection. The CD11c promoter lacks TATA- and CCAAT-boxes, directs the synthesis of transcripts with heterogeneous 5'-ends, and contains an initiator-like sequence at the major transcription initiation site. Several putative binding sequences for ubiquitous (Sp1, AP-1, AP-2, and NF-kB) and leukocyte-specific (PU.1) transcription factors have been identified in the proximal region of the CD11c promoter which may participate in the regulation of the expression of p150,95. Transient expression of CD11c-based reporter gene constructs indicates that the CD11c promoter dictates the tissue-specific expression of p150,95 and that sequences contained within 160 base pairs 5' from the major transcriptional start site are involved in the tissue-specific and regulated expression of p150,95. DNase I protection analysis on the promoter region spanning from -160 to +40 revealed four regions of DNA-protein interactions (FPI-FPIV), two of which (FPII and FPIV) correlate with the cell type-specific and regulated expression of the CD11c gene."

https://openalex.org/W1534314296,"Ternary complexes of vaccinia virus RNA polymerase containing 3'-OMeGMP-arrested transcripts were purified by native gel electrophoresis. These complexes resumed elongation in situ when gel slices were incubated with magnesium and NTPs. Elongation occurred in the absence of pyrophosphate, suggesting that the blocking 3'-OMeGMP residue was removed via a novel pathway. We show that purified elongation complexes contain an intrinsic nuclease activity that shortens nascent RNA from the 3'-end. RNA cleavage was absolutely dependent on a divalent cation and was stimulated by CTP. The initial 5' cleavage product remained associated with the ternary complex and could be elongated in the presence of NTPs. Multiple stepwise cleavages generated progressively shorter chains. Purified ternary complexes containing 3'-OH-terminated RNAs also displayed nuclease activity. Involvement of the vaccinia RNA polymerase subunit rpo30 in the transcript-shortening reaction is suggested based on sequence similarity of rpo30 to mammalian protein SII (TFIIS), an extrinsic transcription factor required for nascent RNA cleavage by RNA polymerase II (Reines, D. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 3795-3800)."
https://openalex.org/W1580811574,"To define DNA regulatory elements that mediate the response of the keratin 1 (K1) gene to Ca(2+)-induced differentiation, regions spanning the 5'- and 3'-flanking sequences, coding regions, and introns from the human K1 gene were cloned into vectors containing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene and transfected into cultured mouse keratinocytes. A 4.3-kilobase (kb) region located 3' to the K1 gene stimulated CAT activity in response to increasing Ca2+ concentrations from 0.05 mM (basal cells) to 1.2 mM (differentiated cells). The 4.3-kb fragment was also active in human epidermal cells but inactive in NIH 3T3 cells and primary mouse fibroblasts. Deletion analysis localized the activity to the terminal 1682 base pairs (bp) of the flanking sequence which retained Ca2+ sensitivity in epidermal cells but was not active in mesenchymal cells. Removal of a 207-base pair element created an enhancer which was active in both epidermal and mesenchymal cells but was still Ca(2+)-inducible. Further deletions identified two elements which functioned synergistically to give maximal Ca(2+)-sensitive activity. Stably transfected epidermal cell lines expressed CAT under the direction of these elements when grafted onto nude mice to reconstitute an intact epidermis. Previously reported keratin regulatory motifs were not contained in the 1682-bp fragment, but an AP-1 site was identified in one of the synergistic subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1500760344,"Degenerate oligonucleotides were used to selectively amplify yeast genomic sequences related to Ser/Thr protein phosphatases. Among the sequences obtained, clone ST4-2 was found to code for a novel sequence related to previously known phosphatases. A size-selected yeast genomic library was constructed and screened using clone ST4-2 as probe, and one positive clone, named PPG, was isolated. DNA sequencing of a 1.8-kilobase pair fragment of this clone revealed an open reading frame of 1104 base pairs which codes for a 368-amino acid protein. On the basis of its amino acid sequence, the product of gene PPG would be an acidic protein, structurally more related to type 2A than to type 1 or 2B phosphatases, and is characterized by an extension of about 50 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus. The gene, which is located in chromosome XIV, is expressed as a 1.3-kilobase mRNA and is not essential for growth. Haploid mutants carrying a disrupted copy of the gene were able to grow in glucose as well as in other carbon sources, but they accumulated less glycogen than the wild type strain. However, the state of activation of glycogen synthase was essentially identical in wild type and mutant cells. The finding that, in early exponential phase, mutant cells contain higher levels of glycogen phosphorylase a, in addition to a lower amount of total glycogen synthase activity observed in medium-late exponential phase, could account for the difference found in glycogen accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W1597859340,"Extracellular application of ATP and ADP evoked the oscillatory K+ currents (IKCa) resulting from the periodic rise in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) of megakaryocyte isolated from rat bone marrow (Uneyama, H., Uneyama, C., and Akaike, N. (1992) Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 58, 231). The intracellular mechanism of ATP-induced cytoplasmic Ca2+ oscillation was investigated by the use of nystatin-perforated patch-clamp technique. Caffeine and ryanodine, which release Ca2+ from the Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release pool (CICR), and procaine, a blocker of Ca2+ release from CICR, had no effect on the IKCa oscillation in megakaryocyte. Thapsigargin and A23187 activated IKCa irreversibly by mobilizing Ca2+, but under Ca(2+)-free conditions they activated IKCa transiently. Intracellular application of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) also induced IKCa oscillation. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), a strong activator of protein kinase C (PKC), inhibited the oscillation completely. The inhibitory action of PMA was reversed by an inhibitor of PKC, staurosporin. The oscillation of ATP-induced IKCa was disrupted by staurosporin or calmodulin (CaM) antagonists such as W-7 and trifluoperazine, resulting in a transient and successive plateau-like IKCa. These results suggest that Ca2+ oscillation in megakaryocyte is caused by the interaction of both the Ca2+ release from IP3-sensitive Ca2+ pool and the Ca2+ uptake stimulated by PKC and Ca2+/CaM complex. Furthermore, forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase, and isobutylmethylxanthin, an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase, inhibited the frequency, latency, and current amplitude of the oscillation in a concentration-dependent manner. These reagents inhibited IP3-induced oscillation as well as an ATP-induced oscillation. Thus, the ATP-induced [Ca2+]i oscillation of rat megakaryocyte is also modulated by cAMP."
https://openalex.org/W1672901017,"The cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) mediates the transfer of neutral lipids between the plasma lipoproteins. A carboxyl-terminal sequence of CETP was recently shown to form the epitope of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody (TP2) and to be necessary for neutral lipid transfer activity. To determine the role of specific amino acids in the epitope and/or in lipid transfer activity, we made single amino acid substitution mutants between Pro446 and Ser476 by in vitro mutagenesis and expressed the mutants in mammalian cells. The binding of TP2 to CETP was abolished by mutations primarily of polar or charged amino acids that occurred periodically within the sequence between His466 and Leu475 and at amino acid Asp460; however, these mutants had well preserved cholesteryl ester (CE) transfer activity. By contrast, mutants of bulky hydrophobic amino acids in this region (particularly Leu475, Phe471, Leu468, Phe461, and Phe454) showed markedly decreased CE transfer specific activity, but essentially normal binding of TP2. The paradoxical effects on antibody binding and activity could be explained if amino acids determining monoclonal antibody binding and activity are disposed on opposite faces of an amphipathic helix between amino acids 465 and 476. This model was tested by substituting alanine residues for pairs of nonpolar amino acids which would be contiguous on a helix, resulting in low activity mutants equivalent to those produced by deletion of this region. We conclude that the hydrophobic face of a carboxyl-terminal helix of CETP is directly involved in the mechanism of CE transfer, and that TP2 inhibits activity by local sterical hindrance. The general hydrophobic character of this region, imparted by the bulky hydrophobic amino acids Leu and Phe, is important for normal CE transfer."

https://openalex.org/W1533075452,"Elevated glucose transport rates during glucose deprivation are phenomena that have been observed in several different types of cells in culture. We show here that glucose transport rates in 3T3-L1 adipocytes increased by 10-fold within 18 h in response to glucose deprivation, confirming earlier work by Van Putten and Krans (Van Putten, J. P. M., and Krans, H. M. J. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 7996-8001). Mannose and 3-O-methylglucose (a nonmetabolizable glucose analog), but not fructose or galactose, blocked the increase in transport activity. Although the increase in transport was dependent on new protein synthesis, only a small and transient increase in GLUT 1 mRNA (less than 2-fold) was observed. In addition, the level of the normal isoform of GLUT 1 (46 kDa) did not increase. A lower molecular mass isoform (37 kDa) was observed but not until 15 h after glucose removal, the appearance of which was clearly not correlated with the increase in activity. Further, the extracellular glucose concentration required to elicit accumulation of this form (p37) was 2 orders of magnitude less than that required for transport stimulation (5 microM versus 500 microM glucose; p37 accumulation and transport activation, respectively). Interestingly, p37 was seen in the presence of galactose, but not fructose, despite elevated transport activity with either sugar. The p37 isoform was slightly larger than N-glycosidase F-treated GLUT 1 (36 kDa), implying that this form is still glycosylated, albeit incompletely. It is not known if p37 is functional, but the time- and sugar-dependent appearance of the lower isoform suggests that p37 is not responsible for starvation-induced transport but potentially represents an underglycosylated precursor of the normal, 46-kDa isoform of GLUT 1."
https://openalex.org/W2151196709,"We have identified a distinct insulin-responsive element (IRE) located within the pancreatic enhancer of the mouse amylase gene Amy-2.2. A 30-base pair (bp) fragment was previously shown to be sufficient to transfer insulin response to a heterologous promoter. The 30-bp fragment overlaps the tissue-specific pancreatic enhancer that binds the putative transcriptional activator PTF1. To determine whether enhancer and IRE activities could be separated, we introduced three 10-base pair substitutions into the 30-bp region. The mutated regulatory regions were cloned upstream of a heterologous promoter and transferred to transgenic mice. Mutants 1 and 2 retained PTF1 binding activity and insulin response. Mutant 3 retained PTF1 binding, but was defective in insulin response. The results indicate that the IRE is functionally distinct from the PTF1-binding site, although the two overlap physically. In contrast to the wild-type gene, mutant 3 is characterized by constitutive expression in diabetic animals, suggesting that a binding site for a repressor has been destroyed. A nuclear protein with affinity for the IRE was detected in normal and diabetic pancreas. This protein does not bind mutant 3, suggesting that it may be involved in negative regulation of amylase in diabetic pancreas."
https://openalex.org/W1563273606,"Analyzing the mechanisms underlying the capability of the monosialoganglioside GM1 to induce CD4 modulation we observed that GM1 has a dual effect on the CD4 molecule. GM1 treatment of the lymphoma cell line MOLT-3 and CD4-transfected HeLa cells for times shorter than 30 min prevented binding of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) recognizing epitopes located within the first NH2-terminal domains of CD4, but not of the OKT4 mAb, which binds to the region of CD4 proximal to the transmembrane domain. However, no binding of the OKT4 mAb was observed after a few hours of treatment with GM1 in both MOLT-3 cells and HeLa cells transfected with an intact CD4 molecule, but not in HeLa cells transfected with a CD4 molecule lacking the bulk of the cytoplasmic domain, suggesting that modulation of CD4 by GM1 depends on the integrity of the cytoplasmic domain. GM1 treatment blocked binding of several mAbs which recognize epitopes located within the first two NH2-terminal domains of CD4 and did not induce CD4 down-modulation if MOLT-3 cells were preincubated with the OKT4A or the OKT4 mAbs. Immunoprecipitation studies with [35S]methionine-labeled MOLT-3 cells showed that GM1-induced CD4 down-modulation was accompanied by CD4 degradation, and this was preceded by dissociation of p56lck from CD4. GM1-induced CD4 down-modulation, dissociation of p56lck from CD4, and CD4 degradation were unaffected by staurosporine, which, on the contrary, blocked these events in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. These observations demonstrate that the first action of GM1 is to mask epitopes located within the first two NH2-terminal domains; then, GM1 triggers protein kinase C-independent signals which cause p56lck dissociation from CD4 and the delivery of the molecule to an intracellular compartment where it is eventually degraded."
https://openalex.org/W1523525659,"Radiolabeled antithrombin III (ATIII) was incubated at 37 degrees C with purified vitronectin (VN) or fibrinogen-deficient plasma before thrombin was added to initiate complex formation. Incorporation of radiolabeled ATIII was detected using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and autoradiography. The PAGE conditions appeared to be crucial for the detection of VN.TAT complexes. In the absence of SDS, ternary complexes formed instantaneously, whereas in the presence of SDS, only 50% of the TAT was associated with VN after a 60-min incubation. Formation of ternary complexes could be confirmed by gel filtration of the plasma to which thrombin was added. Furthermore, TAT in patient plasmas (disseminated intravascular coagulation and sepsis) was found to bind to heparin-Sepharose, indicating that this endogenously formed TAT was also associated with VN. The amino-terminal region of VN and the thrombin moiety of the TAT complex were found to be responsible for their interaction, which was stabilized by disulfide bridges. These results indicate that in normal plasma all TAT is complexed with VN. This association alters the conformational state of plasma VN, which appears to be responsible for the clearance of thrombin complexes from the circulation."
https://openalex.org/W1635942357,"Src homology regions 2 (SH2) and 3 (SH3) are noncatalytic domains that are conserved among several proteins implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation. Using bacterially expressed fusion proteins containing the SH2 domain of the abl tyrosine kinase, we have quantitated the binding of these domains to the activated epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR). A 35S-labeled abl SH2 fusion protein binds to the human EGFR immunoprecipitated from EGF-treated NIH3T3 cells that overexpress the receptor. This binding is totally dependent on the pretreatment of cells with EGF. The interaction is rapid, reaching 50% of maximum within 1 min, and attaining apparent equilibrium by 10 min. Dissociation of the complex is biphasic with a rapidly dissociating component (t1/2 of less than 1 min), as well as a slowly dissociable component. The 35S-labeled abl SH2 fusion protein specifically binds to the EGFR in a saturable manner and is differentially inhibited by unlabeled fusion proteins containing SH2 domains from phospholipase C, the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, and the GTPase activation protein of ras. To identify residues critical for abl SH2-EGFR binding, six point mutants were constructed in the highly conserved FLVRES motif. Three mutants (V170L, E172Q, and E174Q) display binding affinities similar to that of wild type. However, three other mutants (R171K, S173C, and S175C) have greatly reduced affinity. Interestingly, the binding affinity to the EGFR determined by the in vitro assay directly correlates with the transforming ability of the corresponding v-abl constructs in vivo (Mayer, B. J., Jackson, P. K., Etten, R. A. V., and Baltimore, D. (1992) Mol. Cell. Biol. 12, 609-618). These data indicate that the Arg-171, Ser-173, and Ser-175 are critical for both transformation and abl SH2 domain binding to phosphotyrosine-containing proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1524165230,"The major protein fraction of the protamine-like PL-II* (phi 2B) from the sperm of Mytilus californianus has been sequenced and characterized. Immunological and sequence analyses unequivocally show that this protein is indeed a member of the histone H1 family. Along with proteins of the histone H1 class, the protein also shows cross-reactivity and sequence identity, in its NH2-terminal region, with the major protamine-like protein component of Mytilus sperm: PL-III (phi 1), of smaller molecular mass. Indeed it is the unusual repetitive sequence motif of the NH2-terminal domain of PL-II* that bestows to this protein its protamine-like nature. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy spectroscopy indicates that the protein contains considerable secondary structure: 18% alpha-helix, 21% beta-sheet, 39% turns and bends, 22% random coil. At the higher levels of structure, PL-II* exhibits ionic strength-dependent folding which is indistinguishable from that of histone H5, as monitored by fluorescence anisotropy."

https://openalex.org/W1520730707,"Steel factor (SLF) synergizes with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or interleukin-3 (IL-3) to stimulate proliferation of human factor-dependent cell line, MO7e. To elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying this synergism, induction of immediate-early genes was studied. Treatment of MO7e cells with SLF, GM-CSF, and IL-3 induced/enhanced expression of c-fos, junB, egr-1, and c-myc genes. SLF treatment of MO7e cells led to higher expression of c-fos, junB, and egr-1 genes than did treatment with GM-CSF or IL-3. However, GM-CSF and IL-3 had more prolonged effects on enhancement of the c-myc gene than SLF. Using optimal dosages for cell proliferation, induction of c-fos and junB was greater than additive with SLF plus GM-CSF or IL-3, as compared with each factor alone. Using suboptimal amounts of SLF with optimal GM-CSF or IL-3, induction of c-fos, junB, egr-1, and c-myc genes was greater than additive. De novo protein synthesis was not required for greater induction of these immediate-early genes by the combination of SLF plus GM-CSF. Based on nuclear run-on and actinomycin D experiments, the data suggest that the synergistic effects of SLF plus GM-CSF on the induction of immediate-early genes may be mediated in part at the level of transcription and mRNA stabilization for c-fos, at the level of mRNA stabilization for junB, and at the level of transcription for egr-1."
https://openalex.org/W1564718223,"A mouse mammary carcinoma mutant cell line showing a characteristic alteration of glycosphingolipid (GSL) composition, but with unchanged protein glycosylation pattern, was isolated. Parent cell line FM3A/F28-7 is characterized by the predominance of lactosylceramide (LacCer) and virtual absence of more complex GSLs. Mutant cell line FUA169 was isolated after treatment of F28-7 cells with the mutagen N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine and incubation with anti-LacCer monoclonal antibody T5A7 and complement. FUA169 cells were characterized by a dramatic reduction in LacCer and by the presence of a major ganglioside identified as GM3. They also showed high activity of CMP-sialic acid:LacCer 2,3-sialosyltransferase, whereas F28-7 cells had no detectable activity of this enzyme. In contrast to the difference in GSL pattern, F28-7 and FUA169 showed identical protein glycosylation patterns, as evidenced by Western blotting with various lectins and surface labeling with galactose oxidase/NaB3H4 and periodate/NaB3H4. Thus, FUA169 is identified as a glycosylation mutant with regard to GM3 expression and will be useful for studies of the functional role of GM3. Growth of FUA169 cells, relative to F28-7 cells, showed greater temperature sensitivity and greater inhibitability based on restriction of growth factors, particularly insulin."

https://openalex.org/W1595589562,"A monoclonal antibody (12D11) is presented that binds an epitope on histone H1 only when it is phosphorylated. Skeletal myoblasts, which are cultured in high mitogen medium to induce proliferation and inhibit differentiation, contain histone H1 reactive with monoclonal antibody 12D11, whereas differentiated myocytes and adult skeletal muscle do not. Phosphorylation of H1 at the 12D11 epitope, as assessed by antibody binding, is also induced and maintained in myoblasts cultured in low mitogen medium supplemented with transforming growth factor beta, which blocks differentiation but allows the cells to withdraw from the cell cycle (Olson, E., Sternberg, E., Hu, J., Spizz, G., and Wilcox, C. (1986) J. Cell Biol. 103, 1799-1805; Massague, J., Cheipetz, S., Endo, T., and Nadal-Ginard, B. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 83, 8206-8210). These observations suggest that phosphorylation of histone H1 at the 12D11 epitope is associated with the negative regulation of myoblast differentiation by growth factors."
https://openalex.org/W1540220763,"In mature mammalian muscle, the chloride conductance of the membrane is an important factor in the regulation of excitability. Up to now, no ligand was available for the biochemical characterization of muscle chloride channels. In order to localize and characterize these channels, we have used indanyloxyacetic acid (IAA)-94, a ligand previously used for epithelial Cl- channels (Landry, D. W., Reitman, M., Cragoe, E. J., Jr., and Al-Awqati, Q. (1987) J. Gen. Physiol. 90, 779-798; Landry, D. W., Akabas, M. H., Redhead, C., Edelman, A., Cragoe, E. J., Jr., and Al-Awqati, Q. (1989) Science 244, 1469-1472). IAA induced myotonic responses when microinjected into mature mouse muscle fibers, indicating a blockade of Cl- channels from the cytoplasmic side. Membrane vesicles were prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle and separated by sucrose gradient centrifugation. Fractions obtained (in the order of increasing density) were sarcolemma (SL), T-tubules (TT), sarcoplasmatic reticulum (SR), and triads and mitochondria (TR/M). The fraction enriched for SL was characterized by high specific binding capacity for [3H]saxitoxin (Na+ channel), whereas TT-rich fractions bound [3H]PN 200-110 (dihydropyridine receptor) with high specific activity. Upon patch-clamping of lipid supplemented vesicles, IAA-sensitive Cl- channels were found in the SL fraction but not in the SR. Highest specific activities in electrical diffusion potential sensitive 36Cl transport and [3H]IAA-94 binding were found in the SL. SL vesicles were solubilized with 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1- propanesulfonate and subjected to IAA-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Specifically bound protein was eluted with 100 microM IAA-94 and either analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis or reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles. The eluate contained four polypeptides (specifically bound, mapp 110-120 and 60 kDa; unspecifically bound mapp 67 and 50 kDa) and was highly enriched for IAA-sensitive chloride channels as shown by patch-clamping after reconstitution. The IAA-sensitive 100/280-picosiemens chloride channels of the sarcolemma are likely to be responsible for its major chloride conductance and thereby for the stabilization of resting potential."

https://openalex.org/W1579196088,"Abstract Drosophila Rrp1 protein purified from embryos has four tightly associated enzymatic activities: DNA strand transfer, single-strand DNA renaturation, 3'-exonuclease, and apurinic endonuclease. Copurifying with these activities is a single polypeptide that has an apparent M(r) of 105,000 when estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. To determine if this polypeptide is sufficient for these activities, it has been overexpressed in Escherichia coli. In crude extracts of E. coli cells, an ATP-independent Mg(2+)-dependent strand transfer activity is observed upon activation of the promoter that drives expression of Rrp1. Rrp1 protein purified from induced E. coli cells has electrophoretic, chromatographic, and enzymatic properties similar to those of Drosophila Rrp1 protein. The carboxyl-terminal region of Rrp1 (amino acids 428-679) is homologous to E. coli exonuclease III. Rrp1 deleted for this region cannot carry out DNA strand transfer, but can renature complementary single-strand DNA. The strand transfer activity of this truncated protein can be restored if DNA 3'-exonuclease is provided in trans by pretreating the double-strand DNA substrate with E. coli exonuclease III. This demonstrates a likely role of the exonuclease in the in vitro DNA strand transfer reaction carried out by Rrp1 protein. Such a role is also suggested by an analysis of the polarity of the strand transfer reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1565049236,"The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, the gene responsible for the lethal hereditary disorder cystic fibrosis, codes for a membrane protein functioning as a cAMP-regulated Cl- channel. Evaluation of human CFTR mRNA transcripts from epithelial and nonepithelial cells demonstrated a CFTR cDNA containing a 260-base pair (bp) insertion between the known CFTR exons 23 and 24, introducing a premature stop codon that would result in a CFTR protein shortened by 61 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus compared to that expected from the normal reported human CFTR coding sequences. Sequence analysis of intron 23 of the CFTR gene demonstrated that the 260-bp insertion (named exon 24a), a part of the reported intron 23 and located consecutive to exon 24, is likely generated by an alternative splice acceptor site. The exon 24a+ CFTR mRNA transcripts represented 3-16% of the total CFTR transcripts in epithelial and nonepithelial cells. These observations suggest an unexpected plasticity of expression of the CFTR gene, where alternative splicing of precursor CFTR mRNA transcripts permits the use of an alternative exon derived from a genomic segment previously believed to function as an intron."
