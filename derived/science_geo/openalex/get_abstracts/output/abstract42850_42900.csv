https://openalex.org/W1505072916,"Induction by interferon-gamma of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (a tryptophan degradation enzyme) was examined with 11 human cell lines. The enzyme induction was demonstrated in 7 of the 11 cell lines. The induced enzyme in each of the 7 cell lines was identical to the enzyme purified from human placenta, as evidenced by immunoblot analysis with a monoclonal antibody specific to the placental one. The extent of the induction varied largely with the cell line; a relatively high induction was observed with HEL (lung fibroblasts), NY (osteosarcoma), and A-431 (epidermoid carcinoma). The enzyme induction was dependent on the concentration of interferon-gamma and occurred 12-18 h after addition of interferon-gamma to the cultures. Interferon-alpha or -beta was completely ineffective in this induction. Interferon-gamma inhibited the growth of the 7 cell lines observed with the enzyme induction, and this growth inhibition was accompanied with a complete deletion of tryptophan (less than 1 microM) in the culture medium by the induction of the enzyme. For two of these cell lines, the inhibition was partially reversed by an addition of exogenous tryptophan to the medium not to be depleted. These findings indicated that the growth inhibition by interferon-gamma was in part explained by the tryptophan depletion in the medium caused by the enzyme induction."
https://openalex.org/W2107062893,"The effects of prolactin on lactation and reproductive organs are well known. However, the other possible target organs and physiological consequences of altered levels of circulating prolactin remain poorly understood. In this study, mice were treated with bromocryptine, a dopamine receptor agonist that inhibits pituitary prolactin secretion. Bromocryptine treatment prevented T-cell-dependent induction of macrophage tumoricidal activity after the intraperitoneal injection of Listeria monocytogenes or Mycobacterium bovis. Coincident treatment with ovine prolactin reversed this effect. Of the multiple events leading to macrophage activation in vivo, the production by T-lymphocytes of gamma-interferon was the most impaired in bromocryptine-treated mice. Lymphocyte proliferation after stimulation with mitogens in vitro was also depressed in spleens of bromocryptine-treated mice, and coadministration of prolactin also reversed this effect. Bromocryptine treatment also reduced the number of deaths resulting from inoculation of mice with Listeria; exogenous prolactin significantly reversed this effect. The critical influence of pituitary prolactin release on maintenance of lymphocyte function and on lymphokine-dependent macrophage activation suggests that, in mice, lymphocytes are an important target tissue for circulating prolactin."
https://openalex.org/W1579091371,"Abstract In structure-function studies on bovine rhodopsin by in vitro site-specific mutagenesis, we have prepared three mutants in the cytoplasmic loop between the putative transmembrane helices E and F. In each mutant, charged amino acid residues were replaced by neutral residues: mutant 1, Glu239----Gln; mutant 2, Lys248----Leu; and mutant 3, Glu247----Gln, Lys248----Leu, and Glu249----Gln. The mutant rhodopsin genes were expressed in monkey kidney (COS-1) cells. After the addition of 11-cis-retinal to the cells, the rhodopsin mutants were purified by immunoaffinity adsorption. Each mutant gave a wild-type rhodopsin visible absorption spectrum. The mutants were assayed for their ability to stimulate the GTPase activity of transducin in a light-dependent manner. While mutants 1 and 3 showed wild-type activity, mutant 2 (Lys248----Leu) was inactive."
https://openalex.org/W1494619635,"Type IX collagen is a recently described component of cartilage. This nonfibril-forming molecule is composed of three helical (COL1-COL3) and four nonhelical domains (NC1-NC4) and also serves as a core protein for a single glycosaminoglycan side chain. To understand its spatial relationship with other matrix constituents, a peptide containing a lysine-derived cross-link was isolated and subjected to amino acid sequencing. The results show that type IX collagen is linked to type II collagen by a hydroxypyridinium cross-link. This cross-link connects the central triple helical (COL2) domain of one alpha 2(IX) chain to the amino telopeptides of two alpha 1(II) chains. The cross-link is very close to the glycosaminoglycan attachment site found in the nonhelical NC3 domain of the alpha 2(IX) chain. A model of the resulting assembly suggests that type IX collagen is located at the surface of the fibril with the short COL 3 domain and the basic globular NC4 domain projecting out from the surface of the fibril. The NC4 domain could, therefore, serve as a binding site for other matrix constituents. In this model, the glycosaminoglycan chain of type IX collagen would be located at the gap region of the fibril."
https://openalex.org/W1972928631,"The Bacillus subtilis ribonuclease P consists of a protein and an RNA. At high ionic strength the reaction is protein-independent; the RNA alone is capable of cleaving precursor transfer RNA, but the turnover is slow. Kinetic analyses show that high salt concentrations facilitate substrate binding in the absence of the protein, probably by decreasing the repulsion between the polyanionic enzyme and substrate RNAs, and also slow product release and enzyme turnover. It is proposed that the ribonuclease P protein, which is small and basic, provides a local pool of counter-ions that facilitates substrate binding without interfering with rapid product release."
https://openalex.org/W2124316837,"We constructed genes encoding the DNA binding region of the bacterial LexA repressor fused to the v-fos and c-fos oncogene products. The resulting LexA-Fos fusion proteins activated transcription in yeast. Transcription activation by these proteins was as strong as transcription activation by proteins native to yeast. LexA-Fos fusion proteins only activated transcription of genes when they were bound to LexA binding sites inserted upstream of those genes. Transcription was activated less strongly by similar proteins in which the DNA binding region of LexA was fused to vMyc and cMyc. Transcription was not activated by native LexA or by proteins containing the DNA binding domain of LexA fused to bacteriophage 434 repressor or yeast MAT alpha 2 protein. These results demonstrate that Fos proteins activate eukaryotic gene expression when they are bound to promoter DNA, and thus suggest that Fos proteins exert some of their effects because they stimulate transcription of cellular genes. Regulation of transcription by Fos and Myc proteins in yeast provides a phenotype that may facilitate genetic analysis of the function of these proteins in higher organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2050650077,"Chaoptin is a photoreceptor cell-specific membrane protein. Analysis of chaoptin mutants demonstrates that this glycoprotein plays a critical role in photoreceptor cell morphogenesis. We have deduced chaoptin's primary structure from the cDNA sequence and examined its membrane topology. Chaoptin is largely composed of 41 potentially amphipathic repeats. Remarkably homologous repeats have been reported in both yeast and human, suggesting their general importance as a structural and/or functional motif. Chaoptin synthesized in vitro is associated with rough endoplasmic reticulum microsomal membrane in an integral fashion, consistent with its extraction characteristics in vivo. The resistance to proteolytic digestion of in vitro synthesized and processed chaoptin suggests that it is primarily localized to the extracellular leaflet of the lipid bilayer. These data are consistent with the proposal that chaoptin is involved in the adhesion between photoreceptor cell membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1999881321,"The biosynthesis of von Willebrand Factor (vWF) by vascular endothelial cells involves a complex series of processing steps that includes proteolytic cleavage of a 741-residue propeptide and the assembly of disulfide-linked multimers. Using a model system in which experimentally altered vWF cDNAs are expressed in COS-1 cells, we have shown that the vWF propeptide contains determinants that govern the assembly of vWF multimers. Furthermore, the role of the propeptide (in the assembly process) does not require it to be a contiguous part of the pro-vWF primary structure, since independently expressed propeptide was shown to promote the assembly of mature vWF subunits into multimers. Pulse-chase experiments indicated that the independently expressed propeptide formed a transient association with the mature vWF subunit inside the cell. Thus, it appears that the vWF propeptide segment can act in “trans” to direct the assembly of disulfide-linked vWF multimers."

https://openalex.org/W2008199045,"In an in vitro system for the Drosophila melanogaster male accessory gland, it was found that 10(-9)M juvenile hormone III could accurately mimic the copulation-induced response of increased protein synthesis in glands from virgin flies. Stimulation by this hormone required calcium in the medium. Experiments with tumor-promoting phorbol esters indicated that activation of protein kinase C can also cause the glands to increase protein synthesis. Stimulation of protein synthesis by juvenile hormone did not occur in mutants deficient in kinase C activity. These results suggest a membrane-protein-mediated effect of juvenile hormone that involves calcium and kinase C."

https://openalex.org/W1530899180,"A guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (G protein), with subunits designated as alpha 40 beta gamma, was identified and partially resolved from two other purified G proteins, Go (alpha 39 beta gamma) and Gi (alpha 41 beta gamma), found in bovine brain. The alpha 40 G protein subunit served as a substrate for ADP-ribosylation catalyzed by Bordetella pertussis toxin, as did alpha 39 and alpha 41. alpha 40 was shown to be closely related to, but distinct from, alpha 41 by reaction with various peptide antisera. An antiserum generated against a peptide derived from the sequence of a Gi alpha clone isolated from a rat C6 glioma cDNA library (Itoh, H., Kozasa, T., Nagata, S., Nakamura, S., Katada, T., Ui, M., Iwai, S., Ohtsuka, E., Kawasaki, H., Suzuki, K., and Kaziro, Y. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 83, 3776-3780) reacted with alpha 40 to the exclusion of all other alpha subunits tested. Another antiserum generated against a peptide derived from an analogous region of a different Gi alpha clone from a bovine brain cDNA library (Nukuda, T., Tanabe, T., Takahashi, H., Noda, M., Haga, K., Haga, T., Ichiyama, A., Kangawa, K., Hiranaga, M., Matsuo, H., and Numa, S. (1986) FEBS Lett. 197, 305-310) reacted exclusively with alpha 41. Evidence is given for the existence of another form of alpha 41 that did not react with either of these two peptide antisera. The antisera were used to survey various rat tissues for the expression of alpha 40 and alpha 41."
https://openalex.org/W1492784537,"Choleragen (cholera toxin) activates adenylate cyclase by catalyzing ADP-ribosylation of Gs alpha, the stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding protein. It was recently found (Tsai, S.-C., Noda, M., Adamik, R., Moss, J., and Vaughan, M. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 84, 5139-5142) that a bovine brain membrane protein known as ADP-ribosylation factor or ARF, which enhances ADP-ribosylation of Gs alpha, also increases the GTP-dependent NAD:arginine and NAD:protein ADP-ribosyltransferase, NAD glycohydrolase, and auto-ADP-ribosylation activities of choleragen. We report here the purification and characterization of two soluble proteins from bovine brain that similarly enhance the Gs alpha-dependent and independent ADP-ribose transfer reactions catalyzed by toxin. Like membrane ARF, both soluble factors are 19-kDA proteins dependent on GTP or GTP analogues for activity. Maximal ARF effects were observed at a molar ratio of less than 2:1, ARF/toxin A subunit. Dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine was necessary for optimal ADP-ribosylation of Gs alpha but inhibited auto-ADP-ribosylation of the choleragen A1 subunit and NAD:agmatine ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. It appears that the soluble factors directly activate choleragen in a GTP-dependent fashion. The relationships of the ARF proteins to the ras oncogene products and to the family of guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins that includes Gs alpha remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W1977116834,Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is a glycoprotein essential for gonadal development and steroidogenesis. Recent studies suggest that deglycosylation of FSH results in the formation of antagonistic proteins that are capable of binding to gonadal receptors but that are devoid of bioactivity. Treatment of hypogonadal women with an antagonist of gonadotropin-releasing hormone substantially decreased serum FSH bioactivity with minimal changes in immunoreactivity. Chromatofocusing and size fractionation of the serum samples indicated the secretion of immunoreactive FSH isoforms that are devoid of bioactivity but that are capable of blocking FSH action in ovarian granulosa cells. These findings provide the first demonstration of naturally occurring circulating antihormones. These FSH antagonists may play an important role in the physiology and pathophysiology of the gonads.
https://openalex.org/W1591890983,"The gene encoding the 66-kDa entomocidal protein (P2 protein or mosquito factor) from Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki has been isolated by the use of a 62-mer oligonucleotide probe that encoded 21 amino acids of the P2 protein NH2 terminus. The DNA sequence of the gene, designated cryBI, was unique from the published sequences of other B. thuringiensis genes. However, the amino acid sequence of the P2 protein, as deduced from the DNA sequence of the cryBI gene, was found to contain a sequence of 100 amino acids having 37% homology to a group of B. thuringiensis entomocidal proteins, the P1 proteins. Late stationary phase Bacillus megaterium cells harboring the cloned B. thuringiensis cryBI gene contained large aggregates of the P2 protein, and the cells were highly toxic to both lepidopteran and dipteran larvae. In contrast, Escherichia coli cells harboring the cloned cryBI gene contained very low levels of the P2 protein. DNA blot hybridization experiments showed that certain B. thuringiensis strains contained at least one cryBI-related DNA sequence in addition to the cryBI gene itself."
https://openalex.org/W1608029426,"We have recently shown that vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) is as potent as acetylcholine in inducing the secretion of catecholamines from the rat adrenal medulla. In the present study we have investigated the molecular mechanism involved in the exocytotic secretion of catecholamines by VIP and the effects of VIP on Ca45 uptake and phosphoinositide breakdown and compared them with those of the classical cholinergic agonists. We now show that omission of Ca2+ from the perfusion medium had almost no effect on VIP-induced secretion; however, addition of 1 mM EGTA to calcium-free medium abolished the secretion. Stimulation with VIP did not result in a net increase in Ca45 uptake and it was not modified by a protein kinase C activator, phorbol ester. All these effects of VIP were comparable to those of muscarine. VIP (0.3 to 10 microM) and muscarine (30 to 100 microM) produced time-and concentration-dependent increase (up to 700%) in the production of [3H]inositol phosphates. The production of [3H]inositol phosphates by VIP and muscarine occurred in calcium-free and EGTA medium. The effect of VIP on [3H]IP, [3H]IP2, and [3H]IP3 production was reduced by (1 to 30 microM) VIP antagonist (an analogue of growth hormone-releasing factor, Ac-Tyr1hGRF) and 1 to 20 microM naloxone. Although nicotine produced a brisk secretory response, there was no change in [3H]inositol phosphates. We conclude that inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate generated upon activation of VIP and muscarine receptors is linked to exocytotic secretion of adrenal medullary hormones through release of internal Ca2+ ions."
https://openalex.org/W1647867403,"We have studied the phospholipase A2 activity in fractionated human neutrophils, employing labeled phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylethanolamine as exogenous substrates. We used these phospholipid substrates labeled in the sn-1 position and measured the resulting labeled lysophospholipid forms in order to ascertain the phospholipase A2 specificity. In postnuclear supernatants from resting and A23187-activated cells, the phospholipase A2 activity showed a similar pH dependence curve with two pH optima at 5.5 and 7.5. Extracts from activated cells showed a 3-6-fold increase in enzyme activity. The subcellular distribution of phospholipase A2 activity in resting and A23187-treated human neutrophils was investigated by fractionation of postnuclear supernatants on continuous sucrose gradients. The neutral phospholipase A2 behaved as a membrane-bound enzyme and was mainly localized in the plasma membrane, the azurophilic granule, and in an ill-defined region of the gradient between the specific granules and mitochondria. The phospholipase A2 located in this undefined region showed a higher degree of activation than that located in other subcellular particulates in A23187-treated cells. This specific activation of an intracellular phospholipase A2 activity during cell stimulation indicates that cell compartmentalization may play a role in the formation of cell-activating and/or signal-transducing agents through the generation of arachidonate metabolites. Phosphatidylinositol was a better substrate for the plasma membrane enzyme, whereas phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine behaved as better substrates for intracellular organelle phospholipase A2 activities. The phospholipase A2 with maximal activity at pH 5.5 behaved as a soluble enzyme, and was almost completely localized in the azurophilic granules. Upon cell activation this acid enzyme activity was released in a similar way to beta-glucuronidase, a marker of azurophilic granules. These results demonstrate the different molecular properties of the phospholipase A2 activity, on the basis of its cellular location."
https://openalex.org/W1525904017,"Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-pa) is a serine protease comprising four different putative structural domains with homologies to fibronectin finger-like structures (finger), epidermal growth factor, kringle structures, and the active site of serine proteases. Only the finger and epidermal growth factor domain are each entirely encoded by unique single exons. We assessed the functional contribution of these two structural domains by making mutants precisely deleted for one or both of the relevant exons. The three mutant genes were expressed in monkey cells, and the variant proteins, purified from the culture medium, were characterized for their fibrinolytic activity, fibrinogenolytic potential, and affinity for fibrin. No significant difference in any biochemical property was observed among the variants. All three variants retained a catalytic dependence on cyanogen bromide fragments of fibrinogen which could not be distinguished from the wild-type enzyme. The activities of the variants were also very similar to that of wild-type t-pa, showing no detectable fibrinogenolytic potential in human plasma at activator concentrations of 500 IU/ml, or when their fibrinolytic activity was tested in human plasma using the 125I-labeled fibrin clot lysis assay at activator concentrations of 150 IU/ml or greater. However, the variants were markedly defective in fibrinolysis at low activator concentrations such that essentially no fibrinolysis was detected at 15 IU/ml. Measurement of fibrin binding showed that the variants lacked the high fibrin binding characteristic of wild-type t-pa. These results demonstrate that the fibrin specificity and fibrin-dependent activity of t-pa are independent of the protein's high affinity for fibrin. The implication of these results is that the t-pa variants would be ineffective activators at a physiological concentration of approximately 2 IU/ml but would be expected to behave similarly to wild-type t-pa at the steady-state plasma concentrations of 0.75-1.25 micrograms/ml (approximately 500 IU/ml) currently required for coronary reperfusion in patients receiving t-pa for acute myocardial infarction (Garabedian, H.D., Gold, H.K., Leinbach, R.C., Yasuda, T., Johns, J.A., and Collen, D. (1986) Am. J. Cardiol. 58, 673-679)."
https://openalex.org/W1537552785,"The site of the reaction between plasminogen activators and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) was investigated in cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. In conditioned medium from endothelial cells, two forms of a plasminogen activator-specific inhibitor can be demonstrated: an active form that readily binds to and inhibits plasminogen activators and an immunologically related quiescent form which has no anti-activator activity but which can be activated by denaturation. In conditioned medium, only a few percent of PAI-1 is the active form. However, the addition of increasing concentrations of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) or urokinase to confluent endothelial cells produced a saturable (3.0 pmol/5 x 10(5) cells), dose-dependent increase of the activator-PAI-1 complex in the conditioned medium even in the presence of actinomycin D or cycloheximide. This resulted also in a dose-dependent decrease of the residual PAI activity measured by reverse fibrin autography both in the conditioned medium and cell extracts. Short-time exposure of endothelial cells to a large amount of t-PA caused almost complete depletion of all cell-associated PAI activity. Although there was no detectable PAI activity even after activation of PAI by denaturants or antigen in the culture medium at 4 degrees C without the addition of t-PA, the addition of t-PA at 4 degrees C not only resulted in the formation of 70% of the amount of the t-PA.PAI complex in conditioned medium at 37 degrees C, but also induced PAI-1 antigen in a time and dose-dependent manner in the conditioned medium. Moreover, 125I-labeled t-PA immobilized on Sepharose added directly to endothelial cells formed a complex with PAI-1 in a dose-dependent manner. On the other hand, no detectable complex was formed with PAI-1 when Sepharose-immobilized 125I-labeled t-PA was added to endothelial cells under conditions in which the added t-PA could not contact the cells directly but other proteins could pass freely by the use of a Transwell. All these results suggest that a storage pool on the surface of endothelial cells or the extracellular matrix produced by endothelial cells contains almost all the active PAI-1, and reaction between PA and PAI-1 mainly occurs on the endothelial cell membranes, resulting in a decrease of the conversion of active PAI-1 to the quiescent form."
https://openalex.org/W1530608250,"We report here that both the mouse teratocarcinoma F9 cells and F9 cells induced to differentiate by treatment with retinoic acid contain cell surface glycoconjugates with terminal alpha-linked galactose residues, as shown by agglutination of cells with antisera to blood type B, but not to type A. In addition, both cell types contain high numbers of binding sites for Griffonia simplicifolia-I, a lectin which binds to terminal alpha-linked galactose residues, although differentiated F9 cells contain approximately 50% more binding sites/cell for this lectin. We have also confirmed that differentiation is accompanied by a decrease in the expression of the fucose-containing stage-specific embryonic antigen (SSEA)-1, as evidenced by the fact that F9 cells, but not differentiated F9 cells, are agglutinated by monoclonal antibody to this antigen. Since these results indicate that surface glycoconjugates contain terminal alpha-linked galactose residues, we assayed cell extracts for the enzyme UDP-Gal:beta-D-Gal-alpha 1,3-galactosyltransferase. We have found that F9 cell extracts contain this activity, and differentiation results in a significant increase in the specific activity of the enzyme, from approximately 2 nmol/mg h in F9 extracts to 7 nmol/mg h in RA/F9 extracts. It has been suggested that the loss of the SSEA-1 antigen upon differentiation of F9 cells is due to decreased activity of the enzyme GDP-Fuc:beta-D-GlcNAc-alpha 1, 3-fucosyltransferase. We therefore determined the activities of this fucosyltransferase and several other glycosyltransferases, which included UDP-GlcNAc:beta-D-Gal-beta 1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, UDP-Gal:beta-D-GlcNAc-beta 1,4-galactosyltransferase, and GDP-Fuc:beta-D-GlcNAc-alpha 1,6-fucosyltransferase. We have found that extracts from both cell types contain these enzyme activities; differentiation, however, does not result in substantial changes in any of these activities."
https://openalex.org/W1555708849,"Clostridium perfringens type A enterotoxin (CPE) is a membrane-active cytotoxin. There are a number of recognized early steps in CPE cytotoxicity including binding of CPE to a protein receptor, insertion of CPE into membranes, and CPE-mediated induction of changes in membrane permeability for small molecules such as ions and amino acids. Further support for the existence of these early steps and further characterization of these events are presented in this report. We now report that these early steps in CPE action are largely independent of extracellular divalent cations. It is also shown that 3H-nucleotide release, known to be a later CPE effect, is Ca2+-dependent. A model for CPE cytotoxicity is suggested involving CPE action as a two-step process with Ca2+-independent early steps and Ca2+-dependent late steps."
https://openalex.org/W1550715505,"A novel human liver cytochrome P-450 isozyme (P-450-AA), which catalyzes arachidonic acid epoxidation, has been purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from human liver. As judged spectrally, the newly described isozyme is low spin in the oxidized state, with a soret band at 415 nm and an increased maximum at 451 nm in the CO-difference spectrum. Cytochrome P-450-AA appeared homogeneous as judged by the appearance of a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with an estimated molecular weight of 53,100. Although cytochrome P-450-AA had a relatively low specific content of 10.8 nmol/mg, it possessed a high activity of arachidonic acid epoxidation. The P-450-AA oxidized arachidonic acid in a reconstituted system into the four regioisomeric epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) (5, 6-, 8, 9-, 11, 12-, 14, 15-EETs) at a rate of 2,010 pmol/nmol/min, a rate which is 37-fold higher than that observed with the crude microsomal preparation. Moreover, the purified cytochrome P-450-AA catalyzed the de-ethylation of 7-ethoxyresorufin at the rate of 2970 pmol/nmol/min, whereas other cytochrome P-450-dependent reactions were carried out at 23-2,000-fold lower rates and ranged between 0.3-130 pmol/nmol/min. The amino acid composition is different from that of other cytochrome P-450 isozymes. The NH2-terminal sequence of 20-amino acid residues was compared to that of LM2 and PB2-B2, the phenobarbital-induced forms in rabbit and rats, respectively. Comparison was also made with two forms of human cytochrome P-450, HLc and HLd. There were 7/20 identical residues for P-450-AA and LM2 and 4/20 for P-450-AA and PB2-B2. There were 2/20 identical residues for P-450-AA and HLd, and no identical residues were found for HLc. We conclude that the biologically active EETs, are formed by a distinct and unique P-450 isozyme from human liver and that arachidonic acid can serve as a screen for detection of the novel P-450 isozyme."
https://openalex.org/W1561271179,"The covalent attachment of myristic acid to the NH2-terminal glycine residue of proteins is catalyzed by the enzyme myristoyl CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase (NMT). Using synthetic octapeptide substrates we have identified and characterized an NMT activity in wheat germ lysates used for cell-free translation of exogenous mRNAs. C-12 and C-14 fatty acids are efficiently transferred to the peptides by this plant NMT, but C-10 and C-16 fatty acids are not. Glycine is required as the NH2-terminal residue: peptides with an NH2-terminal alanine were not substrates. Peptides with proline, aspartic acid, or tyrosine residues adjacent to the NH2-terminal glycine were also not myristoylated. Serine in the fifth position reduced the peptide's Km up to 4000-fold. We have chemically synthesized a sulfur analogue of myristate, 11-(ethylthio)undecanoic acid. Its CoA ester is as good a substrate as myristoyl-CoA for both wheat germ and yeast NMT. Peptides linked to 11-(ethylthio)undecanoic acid are less hydrophobic than the corresponding myristoylpeptides. 11-(Ethylthio)-undecanoic acid may, therefore, help define the role of myristic acid in targeting of acyl proteins within cells."
https://openalex.org/W2165672497,"Using 13C and 1H NMR we measured the rate of glycogen synthesis (0.23 +/- 0.10 mumol/min gram wet weight tissue (gww) in rat heart in vivo during an intravenous infusion of D-[1-13C]glucose and insulin. Glycogen was observed within 10 min of starting and increased linearly throughout a 50-min infusion. This compared closely with the average activity of glycogen synthase I (0.22 +/- 0.03 mumol/min gww) measured at physiologic concentrations of UDP-glucose (92 microM) and glucose-6-phosphate (110 microM). When unlabeled glycogen replaced D-[1-13C]glucose in the infusate after 50 min the D-[1-13C]glycogen signal remained stable for another 60 min, indicating that no turnover of the newly synthesized glycogen had occurred. Despite this phosphorylase a activity in heart extracts from rats given a 1 h glucose and insulin infusion (3.8 +/- 2.4 mumol/min gww) greatly exceeded the total synthase activity and if active in vivo should promote glycogenolysis. We conclude that during glucose and insulin infusion in the rat: (a) the absolute rate of myocardial glycogen synthesis can be measured in vivo by NMR; (b) glycogen synthase I can account for the observed rates of heart glycogen synthesis; (c) there is no futile cycling of glucose in and out of heart glycogen; and (d) the activity of phosphorylase a measured in tissue extracts is not reflected in vivo. These studies raise the question whether significant regulation of phosphorylase a activity in vivo is mediated by factors in addition to its phosphorylation state."
https://openalex.org/W1600040228,"Two cDNA clones complementary to interferon (IFN)-gamma inducible mRNAs in human cells were isolated, and one of these, C5-4, was used for studying the regulation of its cognate mRNA by IFNs. C5-4 cDNA hybridized to a 2.2-kilobase mRNA that coded for a 42,000 Mr polypeptide in vitro. This mRNA was induced by HuIFN-gamma as well as by HuIFN-alpha 2 but in different manners: (i) IFN-gamma induced this mRNA greater than 100-fold and this induction was sustained for at least 48 h, whereas IFN-alpha 2 induced it approximately 10-fold but only transiently. (ii) Cells that were pretreated with IFN-alpha 2 (18h) became refractory to induction by IFN-alpha 2 but responded normally to IFN-gamma. (iii) Cycloheximide (50 micrograms/ml) and anisomycin (10 micron or higher) inhibited the induction by IFN-gamma but not by IFN-alpha 2, suggesting the requirement for some newly synthesized, presumably IFN-gamma-induced, protein factor(s) in IFN-gamma-mediated but not in IFN-alpha 2-mediated induction. Interestingly, this inhibition by cycloheximide of the IFN-gamma-mediated induction was overcome by 24 h, whereas a sustained inhibition was obtained with anisomycin. Our results suggest that this release from cycloheximide-mediated inhibition was apparently due to a leakiness in its inhibitory action on protein biosynthesis. As analyzed by nuclear runoff transcription, IFN-gamma induced the transcription of C5-4-specific RNA within 2 h and it was inhibited by cycloheximide, indicating that the newly synthesized protein mediator(s) required plays a role in the transcriptional activation of the C5-4 gene by IFN-gamma. Southern blot analysis indicated that the C5-4 gene is present in a single copy in the genome. The results demonstrate that IFN-gamma and IFN-alpha induced the expression of a common gene through different mechanisms and suggest the involvement of an intermediary mechanism in IFN-gamma-mediated transcriptional activation of certain cellular genes."
https://openalex.org/W1504600712,"In the various subcellular fractions of rat liver 45-75% of the total dolichol was esterified with a fatty acid. The esterification reaction was localized exclusively in the microsomes, and the transferase activity is 3-fold higher in the cation-insensitive smooth microsomes than in other microsomal subfractions. Although fatty acyl-CoAs tested served as substrates, palmitoyl-CoA was the most rapidly utilized. None of the phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine species tested could be utilized to esterify dolichol with a fatty acid, indicating the absence of transacylation. alpha-Saturated dolichols were esterified at a higher rate than their alpha-unsaturated counterparts. Albumin and low concentrations of Triton X-100 activated the esterification reaction, which was not dependent on mono- or divalent cations, ATP, or CoA. The sensitivity of the transferase activity to trypsin indicates localization of the enzyme(s) involved on the outer surface of microsomes (i.e. the cytoplasmic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum), as is also the case for enzymes of dolichol biosynthesis. Transferase activity was detected in all tissues examined but at a much lower level than in liver and testis. The patterns of fatty acids in dolichol esters of different organelles exhibited some specificity. Labeling in vivo indicated that esterification of dolichol may play a role in targeting this lipid from the endoplasmic reticulum to lysosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1524106947,The cysteinyl residues of the acetylcholine receptor alpha-subunit of Torpedo californica were analyzed. All seven cysteines could be accounted for. Three possible disulfide bridges and one unpaired cysteine were indicated. The disulfide linkages were as follows: Cys128 to Cys142; Cys192 to Cys193; Cys412 to Cys418 (Cys222 is unpaired). The identification of cysteinyl residues was accomplished by a modified protein blot procedure. Cysteinyl residues of intact nicotinic acetylcholine receptor were selectively biotinylated with 3-(N-maleimidopropionyl)biocytin and subsequently detected by the 125I-labeled avidin overlay of blotted Staphylococcus aureus V8 proteolyzed alpha-subunits. Two pairs of cysteines (Cys128/Cys142 and Cys412/Cys418) could be demonstrated only after Na(BH4) reduction of the acetylcholine receptor. Cysteine residues 192 and 193 are particularly sensitive to reduction; 0.1 mM dithiothreitol is sufficient.
https://openalex.org/W1570274569,"A panel of monoclonal antibodies has been developed against the T alpha, T beta and T gamma subunits of bovine transducin. Two anti-T alpha antibodies from this panel (TF15 and TF16) and a third one (4A) against frog T alpha (Witt, P. L., Hamm, H. E., and Bownds, M. D. (1984) J. Gen. Physiol. 84, 251-263) were characterized. Each of these monoclonal antibodies recognizes a different region of T alpha and has a specific effect on the function of transducin. The binding of TF15 is reversibly enhanced by treating T alpha with either 1 M guanidinium chloride or, to a smaller extent, by the removal of bound guanine nucleotide. Its epitope is located in a 12-kDa tryptic fragment containing the binding site for the guanine moiety of GTP. Taken together, these results support previous observations that the conformation of T alpha is modulated by the occupancy of the guanine nucleotide binding site. In contrast to TF15, TF16 recognizes only the native form of T alpha. Its epitope resides within the central portion of the T alpha molecule. While T alpha-bound TF16 does not inhibit either pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation, rhodopsin binding, or transducin subunit interaction, it blocks both the light-activated uptake of guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) and the GTP-dependent elution of transducin from photolyzed rhodopsin. These effects are unlikely to be caused by the occupation of the guanine nucleotide binding site by TF16 because this antibody quantitatively precipitates T alpha-GTP gamma S. We propose that bound TF16 locks T alpha in a conformation that prevents the entrance of guanine nucleotide and favors T beta gamma association. In contrast to TF16, the epitope of 4A was mapped to the amino-terminal region of T alpha. This monoclonal antibody blocks pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation, GTP gamma S uptake, and T alpha-T beta gamma association. Moreover, the binding site for 4A becomes inaccessible when transducin binds to photolyzed rhodopsin. These results suggest that the inhibitory effects of 4A are due to a simultaneous steric blockage of both the interaction of T alpha with T beta gamma and their binding to photolyzed rhodopsin. The results obtained from these studies are correlated with the structure and function of T alpha."
https://openalex.org/W1622292584,"Factor VIII-light chain (FVIII-LC) and Factor VIII-heavy chain (FVIII-HC) were isolated separately from human plasma and were without coagulation activity. When FVIII-LC and FVIII-HC preparations were mixed, coagulation activity was generated in the presence of Mn2+, Ca2+, or Co2+. Mn2+ was most effective and with Ca2+ maximal activity was first obtained after 8 days. Bovine Factor X (FX) accelerated recombination and was able to increase the amount of FVIII:C generated up to 10-fold when FVIII-LC/HC were incubated with Ca2+ for 20 h. When recombination was performed in the presence of micromolar concentrations of sulfhydryl reagents, the total amount of FVIII:C generated was increased up to 4-fold and in excess of FVIII-HC it was possible to drive 70% of FVIII-LC into active complex. If FVIII-HC was prepared in the presence of a sulfhydryl reagent it was possible to drive 75% of FVIII-HC into active complex with FVIII-LC in excess. Me2+, which is necessary for recombination, catalyzes disulfide formation, and it is proposed that FVIII subunits have free sulfhydryl groups. The presence of sulfhydryl reagents during purification of FVIII-HC and during recombination retains the individual subunits in a conformation suitable for recombination."
https://openalex.org/W1545396935,"Abstract Protein S, the most abundant protein synthesized during development of the Gram-negative bacterium Myxococcus xanthus, assembles on the surface of the spores. It can be dissociated from the spores using divalent metal chelators and will reassemble on the spores in the presence of calcium. The amino acid sequence of protein S contains regions which have homology to the calcium-binding sites of calmodulin. Protein S was found to bind 2 mol of calcium/mol of protein with Kd values of 27 and 76 microM. Using oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis, the gene coding for protein S was changed in each of two regions of homology to calmodulin (Ser40----Arg,Ser129----Arg), and a double mutant was also constructed. Each mutant gene was then transduced into the genome of a M. xanthus strain from which the wild-type genes had been deleted. All three mutants produced protein S normally during development. One of the mutants (Ser129----Arg) had normal amounts of protein S on its spores, whereas the other (Ser40----Arg) bound much less and the double mutant had virtually none. Analysis of the calcium binding affinities of the purified proteins showed that [Arg40]protein S and [Arg40, Arg129]protein S did not bind detectable quantities of calcium, whereas [Arg129]protein S bound less calcium than the wild-type protein and with a reduced affinity."
https://openalex.org/W1555193743,"Abstract We have generated mutants of M1 RNA, the catalytic subunit of Escherichia coli RNaseP, and have analyzed their properties in vitro and in vivo. The mutations, A333----C333, A334----U334, and A333 A334----C333 U334 are within the sequence UGAAU which is complementary to the GT psi CR sequence found in loop IV of all E. coli tRNAs. We have examined: 1) whether the mutant M1 RNAs are active in processing wild type tRNA precursors and 2) whether they can restore the processing defect in mutant tRNA precursors with changes within the GT psi CR sequence. As substrates for in vitro studies we used wild type E. coli SuIII tRNA(Tyr) precursor, and pTyrA54, a mutant tRNA precursor with a base change that could potentially complement the U334 mutation in M1 RNA. The C333 mutation had no effect on activity of M1 RNA on wild type pTyr. The U334 mutant M1 RNA, on the other hand, had a much lower activity on wild type pTyr. However, use of pTyrA54 as substrate instead of wild type pTyr did not restore the activity of the U334 mutant M1 RNA. These results suggest that interactions via base pairing between nucleotides 331-335 of M1 RNA and the GT psi CG of pTyr are probably not essential for cleavage of these tRNA precursors by M1 RNA. For assays of in vivo function, we examined the ability of mutant M1 RNAs to complement a ts mutation in the protein component of RNaseP in FS101, a recA- derivative of E. coli strain A49. In contrast to wild type M1 RNA, which complements the ts mutation when it is overproduced, neither the C333 nor the U334 mutant M1 RNAs was able to do so."
https://openalex.org/W1558478105,"Abstract The effects of steroid hormones on the synthesis of lactosaminoglycan (LAG)-containing oligosaccharides by mouse uteri are reported. The uterine LAG-containing oligosaccharides were degraded partially by Pseudomonas endo-beta-galactosidase, releasing an oligosaccharide of the apparent structure: Gal beta----N-acetylglucosaminyl(----N-acetylgalactosaminyl)beta 1,3----galactose. A larger fraction of the LAG-containing oligosaccharides bound to pokeweed mitogen than to Datura stramonium lectin, suggesting the presence of highly branched structures. LAG-containing oligosaccharides were resistant to sequential digestion with Pronase, nitrous acid, hyaluronidase, and chondroitinase ABC. These polysaccharides exhibited a Gal:GlcNAc:GalNAc ratio of approximately 1.0:1.0:0.3 and were not fucosylated. The ion-exchange behavior of the LAG-containing oligosaccharides before and after mild acid hydrolysis indicated the presence of sialic acid residues. The LAG-containing glycopeptides were highly resistant to beta-elimination but were released quantitatively by hydrazinolysis, demonstrating an N-linkage to protein. Binding to pokeweed mitogen was markedly enhanced following release of these oligosaccharides from peptides by hydrazinolysis, suggesting that peptide-bound oligosaccharides were partially inaccessible to the lectin. Molecular exclusion chromatography of the oligosaccharides released by hydrazinolysis revealed a broad distribution ranging from Mr 4,000 to 15,000 with a median Mr of approximately 8,000. We extended the above observations by determining how the steroid hormones 17-beta-estradiol (E2) and progesterone affected synthesis of the LAG-containing oligosaccharides in ovariectomized mice. Generally, E2 and a number of E2 agonists stimulated glycoconjugate synthesis; however, chronic E2 treatment or combined treatment with E2 plus progesterone caused the synthesis of most glycosaminoglycans to return to basal levels. In contrast, E2 either alone or in combination with progesterone stimulated synthesis of LAG-containing oligosaccharides in preference not only to glycosaminoglycans but also to other classes of N-linked oligosaccharides. This effect was apparent during both priming and nidatory E2 treatments. Collectively, these data provide the first demonstration of LAG-containing oligosaccharides in uteri and for the hormonally regulated synthesis of lactosaminoglycans. In addition, this is the first demonstration of the ability of steroid hormones to induce the synthesis of certain types of N-linked oligosaccharides in preference to others in the same tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1486367663,"Two T-kininogens (TI- and TII-kininogens) found in plasma of Freund's adjuvant-treated rats were purified by several chromatographic procedures. The isolated TI- and TII-kininogens showed different mobilities on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the absence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, but were indistinguishable in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. They were also indistinguishable in amino acid composition and antigenicity, but differed in sialic acid content. The NH2- and COOH-terminal sequences were determined. In the 30 NH2-terminal residues, 2 were different. The kinin regions in the COOH-terminal portions of the two kininogens have sequences that demonstrate TI-kininogen contains a mixture of two kinin-containing regions, with substitution of 4 amino acid residues, one of which is identical to the COOH-terminal portion of alpha 1-major acute phase protein (Cole, T., Inglis, A. S., Roxburgh, C. M., Howlett, G. J., and Schreiber, G. (1985) FEBS Lett. 182, 57-61) and the other to the COOH-terminal portion of TI-kininogen (Furuto-Kato, S., Matsumoto, A., Kitamura, N., and Nakanishi, S. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 12054-12059), both predicted from cDNA sequences. The amino acid sequence of the kinin-containing region from TII-kininogen is the same as the COOH-terminal portion of TII-kininogen predicted from the cDNA. These results indicate that T-kininogens from the plasma of adjuvant-treated rats consist of a family of kininogens, that is, TI- and TII-kininogens (separable on DEAE-Sephadex A-50), and that TI-kininogen consists of at least two variants (TI alpha and TI beta) which correspond to the alpha 1-major acute phase protein reported by Cole et al. and TI-kininogen reported by Furuto-Kato et al., respectively. Immunoblotting studies with plasmas from non-inflamed and adjuvant-treated rats also indicate that T-kininogen which was previously isolated from non-inflamed rat plasma corresponds to TI-kininogen and that TII-kininogen is newly generated after treatment of rats with adjuvants."
https://openalex.org/W1561096771,"5-Enolpyruvyl shikimate 3-phosphate synthase catalyzes the reversible condensation of phosphoenolpyruvate and shikimate 3-phosphate to yield 5-enolpyruvyl shikimate 3-phosphate and inorganic phosphate. The enzyme is a target for the nonselective herbicide glyphosate (N-phosphonomethylglycine). In order to determine the role of lysine residues in the mechanism of action of this enzyme as well as in its inhibition by glyphosate, chemical modification studies with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate were undertaken. Incubation of the enzyme with the reagent in the absence of light resulted in a time-dependent loss of enzyme activity. The inactivation followed pseudo first-order and saturation kinetics with Kinact of 45 microM and a maximum rate constant of 1.1 min-1. The inactivation rate increased with increase in pH, with a titratable pK of 7.6. Activity of the inactive enzyme was restored by addition of amino thiol compounds. Reaction of enzyme with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate was prevented in the presence of substrates or substrate plus glyphosate, an inhibitor of the enzyme. Upon 90% inactivation, approximately 1 mol of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate was incorporated per mol of enzyme. The azomethine linkage between pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and the enzyme was reduced by NaB3H4. Tryptic digestion followed by reverse phase chromatographic separation resulted in the isolation of a peptide which contained the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate moiety as well as 3H label. By amino acid sequencing of this peptide, the modified residue was identified as Lys-22. The amino acid sequence around Lys-22 is conserved in bacterial, fungal, as well as plant enzymes suggesting that this region may constitute a part of the enzyme's active site."
https://openalex.org/W1557861390,N-2-(Propenal) serine (S-MDA) was synthesized by reacting serine with malondialdehyde (MDA) and was shown to be a 1:1 adduct of the starting materials. The synthetic compound was found to be identical to a metabolite of MDA excreted in rat and human urine. The identity of the metabolite was confirmed by isolation and hydrolysis to yield equimolar quantities of serine and MDA. The presence of S-MDA in urine constitutes direct evidence for oxidative decomposition of phospholipids by lipid peroxidation in vivo.

The RNA of 1.6 kilobases comigrated with that found in rat hypothalamus. Using three radioimmunoassays specific for pro-TRH-derived peptides, we demonstrated that CA77 cells synthesize high levels of immunoreactive TRH and all of the other pro-TRH-derived peptides identified in hypothalamic tissue. The relative levels of the pro-TRH-derived peptides also indicate that CA77 cells process the TRH precursor in a manner similar to hypothalamic tissue. CA77 cells provide a promising model system for further studies of prepro-TRH gene regulation and post-translational maturation."
https://openalex.org/W1595363145,"Limited proteolysis by pancreatic elastase (EC 3.4.21.36) and chymotrypsin (EC 3.4.21.1) was used to study the domain structure and active site of beta-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23) (Escherichia coli). Treatment with elastase resulted in a rapid cleavage between residues Ala-732 and Ala-733. No inactivation accompanied this cleavage suggesting that this bond is in a hinge region of the protein. Some slow cleavages beyond the initial one were observed to occur and were accompanied by inactivation. Treatment of beta-galactosidase with chymotrypsin resulted in cleavages first between Trp-585 and Ser-586 and then between Phe-601 and Cys-602. The first of these cleavages resulted in total inactivation of beta-galactosidase. The presence of monovalent ions or isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside protected against the cleavages but when Mg2+ or Mn2+ was present in the reaction mixture, the bond between Trp-585 and Ser-586 was more susceptible to the action of chymotrypsin. These data demonstrate that the conformation of beta-galactosidase around Trp-585 and Ser-586 is dramatically affected by the binding of ions and isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside. The mutant M15 beta-galactosidase, which is missing residues 11 through 41 and is an inactive dimer rather than an active tetramer, was found to be much more labile to proteases than native beta-galactosidase, but the same initial cleavages were found to occur. In addition, trypsin cleaved the M15 protein between Arg-431 and Trp-432 while native beta-galactosidase was stable to trypsin."
https://openalex.org/W1503391802,"During growth in an arginine-deficient (chemically defined) medium, cells of Streptococcus lactis K1 formed significant amounts of a previously undetected ninhydrin-positive compound. This intracellular compound did not cochromatograph with any of a wide range of amino acids or amino acid analogs tested. However, by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography, the unknown compound migrated close to the recently discovered N5-(1-carboxyethyl)ornithine (Thompson, J., Curtis, M. A., and Miller, S. P. F. (1986) J. Bacteriol. 167, 522-529; Miller, S. P. F., and Thompson, J. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 16109-16115). The purified compound behaved as a neutral amino acid and eluted between valine and methionine in the amino acid analyzer. The results of 1H NMR spectroscopy suggested the presence of a lysine backbone and a coupled methyl-methine unit in the molecule, and 13C NMR showed that there were nine carbon atoms, of which two (C-1 and C-7) were carboxyl carbons. The simplest structure compatible with the physicochemical data was that of an alkylated derivative of lysine. The identity of this new amino acid, N6-(1-carboxyethyl)lysine, was confirmed by chemical synthesis. In vivo labeling experiments conducted using L[U-14C]lysine and [epsilon-15N]lysine showed that exogenous lysine served as the precursor of intracellular N6-(1-carboxyethyl)lysine and that the epsilon-amino N atom was conserved during biosynthesis of the lysine derivative. Of the two possible diastereomers (2S,8S or 2S,8R) of N6-(1-carboxyethyl)lysine, comparative 13C NMR spectroscopy established that the amino acid produced by S. lactis K1 was exclusively of the 2S,8S configuration."
https://openalex.org/W1891214206,"Fibronectin purified from rabbit plasma was radioiodinated, and its interaction with rabbit hepatocytes in suspension was studied. Iodinated fibronectin interacted in a time-dependent fashion reaching plateau at 3 h. The interaction was greater in the presence of calcium than in the presence of magnesium or EDTA. Saturation occurred at about 140 nM fibronectin with about 1,400,000 molecules bound per cell. The interaction could be inhibited by unlabeled fibronectin or fibrinogen but not by the tetrapeptide Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser or by albumin, transferrin, or fetuin. About 50% of the bound iodinated fibronectin was incorporated, in a calcium-dependent fashion, into cross-linked high molecular weight complexes at the cell surface through a mechanism consistent with a cellular transglutaminase-mediated reaction. Iodinated fibronectin which could be displaced from the cell was monomeric in nature, while the cell-associated material remained in high molecular weight complexes. The role of the interaction is currently under investigation, but it is possible that the binding may promote cellular adhesion or facilitate intercellular interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1585039121,"Lysine 94 in the regulatory chain of aspartate transcarbamoylase has been changed to a glutamine residue by site-directed mutagenesis. The resulting enzyme is almost insensitive to the activator ATP and shows a substantially reduced response to the feedback inhibitor CTP. Competition experiments indicate that ATP is still able to bind at low concentrations to the regulatory site of the mutant enzyme, even though no stimulation could be detected. When the nucleosides adenosine or cytidine were used, the saturation curves of the mutant and the wild-type enzyme became indistinguishable. Together these results indicate that lysine 94 is strongly involved in the binding of ATP and CTP by interacting specifically with the triphosphate moiety of these nucleotide effectors. Furthermore, unlike the wild-type enzyme, the inhibitory and stimulatory effects in the mutant enzyme are insensitive to changes in aspartate concentrations, implying that the lysine 94 side chain is also involved in the allosteric mechanism of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1604558239,"We have investigated the effects of insulin and motor denervation on the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase in skeletal muscle. Rat epitrochlearis muscles were denervated in vivo 3 days before the contralateral and denervated muscles were incubated in vitro with 32Pi to label sites in glycogen synthase. The 32P-labeled synthase was rapidly immunoprecipitated from extracts under conditions which prevented changes in the phosphorylation state of the enzyme. When 32P-labeled synthase from contralateral muscles was cleaved with CNBr, essentially all of the 32P was recovered in two fragments, denoted CB-1 and CB-2. Incubating these muscles with insulin decreased the 32P content of each fragment by approximately 25%, indicating that the hormone stimulated dephosphorylation of at least two sites. Peptide mapping by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography was performed to resolve phosphorylation sites more completely. The results suggest that the enzyme was phosphorylated in sites 1a, 1b, 2, 3(a+b+c), and 5. Insulin stimulated dephosphorylation of sites in peptides presumed to contain sites 1b, 2, and 3(a+b+c). Synthase from denervated muscles appeared to contain the same amount of phosphate as enzyme from contralateral muscles, and denervation did not detectably affect the distribution of 32P within the subunit. However, denervation abolished the effect of insulin on decreasing the 32P content of synthase. The results indicate that the insulin resistance induced by denervation involves a loss in the ability of insulin to stimulate dephosphorylation of glycogen synthase."

Three immunoreactive peptides were purified by successive high performance liquid chromatography steps in sufficient quantities for identification by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry. Two peptides were characterized as authentic vasopressin and oxytocin. Their identities were in agreement with the observed immunoreactivities, high performance liquid chromatography behavior, and biological activity. The third peptide was identified as N alpha-acetyloxytocin. The presence of the acetyl group was demonstrated by the molecular mass of the peptide, and the N alpha position was shown to be the modified site by the presence of a blocked NH2 terminus. N alpha-Acetylation of oxytocin may be involved in altering the biological properties of the peptide."
https://openalex.org/W2044273270,"Regulation of the synthesis of membrane-bound and secreted immunoglobulin mu heavy chains at the level of RNA processing is an important element for B cell development. The precursor mu RNA is either polyadenylated at the upstream poly(A) site (for the secreted form) or spliced (for the membrane-bound form) in a mutually exclusive manner. When the mouse mu gene linked to the SV40/HSV-TK hybrid promoter was microinjected into Xenopus oocytes, the mu messenger RNA (mRNA) was altered by coinjection of nuclei of mouse surface IgM-bearing B-lymphoma cells to include the synthesis of the membrane-bound form. An increase in the membrane-bound form was not observed when nuclei of IgM-secreting hybridoma cells or fibroblast cells were coinjected. Deletion of the upstream poly(A) site did not eliminate the effect of B-lymphoma nuclei suggesting that membrane-specific splicing is stimulated. Further, splicing of other mu gene introns was not affected by coinjection of B-lymphoma nuclei. These results suggest that mature B cells contain one or more transacting nuclear factors that stimulate splicing specific for membrane-bound mu mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1562731550,"A characterization is reported of the major cytoskeletal protein, called IEF (isoelectric focusing)-51K, of marginal band microtubule coils from human blood platelets (Kenney, D. M. and Linck, R. W. (1985) J. Cell Sci. 78, 1-22). IEF-51K is a unique biochemical species which is distinguishable from platelet and mammalian neuronal alpha-tubulin and beta-tubulin by 1) its faster mobility on discontinuous sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis corresponding to an apparent Mr 51,000; 2) its more alkaline relative isoelectric point at pH 5.7 compared with that of alpha- and beta-tubulin at pH 5.3 and 5.5, respectively; 3) lack of coincidence in peptide maps prepared with chymotrypsin or Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease; and 4) lack of immunochemical cross-reactivity of polyclonal anti-IEF-51K with alpha- and beta-tubulin and of monoclonal anti-alpha-tubulin and anti-beta-tubulin with IEF-51K. In contrast to its chemical uniqueness, IEF-51K is tubulin-like in some of its properties. IEF-51K is localized in the marginal band of intact platelets by immunofluorescence; it undergoes cycles of microtubule disassembly/reassembly both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, IEF-51K was not extracted from isolated Taxol-stabilized marginal band microtubules by elevated NaCl concentrations (to 0.45 M), conditions that do not disrupt the polymeric structure of alpha- and beta-tubulin. These results indicate that IEF-51K together with alpha-tubulin and beta-tubulin are the major structural polypeptides of platelet marginal band microtubules. The unusual subunit composition of the platelet marginal band microtubule may be related to specialization(s) of microtubule structure and function in the marginal band coil of platelets."
https://openalex.org/W1832473242,"A Fisher rat thyroid cell line was maintained in culture and the cells were labeled with [3H]glucosamine, [35S]sulfate, and [35S]cysteine to examine the synthesis of proteoglycans. 3H and 35S radioactivity from these precursors were incorporated into both chondroitin sulfate (CS) and heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans. CS proteoglycans were almost exclusively secreted into the medium while HS proteoglycans remained mainly associated with the cell layer. Single chain glycosaminoglycans released by papain digestion or alkaline borohydride treatment of either the CS or HS proteoglycans had average molecular weights of approximately 30,000 on Sepharose CL-6B chromatography. Both CS and HS proteoglycans were relatively small and contained only one or two glycosaminoglycans chains. 3H and 35S incorporation into both CS and HS proteoglycans were increased by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in a dose-dependent manner, which is in part explained by an adenylate cyclase-dependent mechanism as indicated by a similar effect in response to dibutyryl cAMP. TSH enhanced the incorporation of 35S into CS from [35S]cysteine about 1.5-fold and that from [35S]sulfate about 2-fold. This result demonstrated that the increased 35S incorporation from the [35S]sulfate precursor reflects an actual increase in sulfate incorporation and is not simply a result from an apparent increase in specific activity of the phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate donor. Analysis of disaccharides from chondroitinase digests revealed that the proportion of non-sulfated, 4-sulfated, and 6-sulfated disaccharides was not altered appreciably by TSH. These results, together with the disproportionate increase in 3H incorporation into CS from [3H]glucosamine, indicated that TSH increased the specific activity of the 3H label as well. Chase experiments revealed that CS proteoglycans were rapidly (t1/2 = 15 min) secreted into the medium and that the degradation of cell-associated proteoglycans was enhanced by TSH."
https://openalex.org/W1606101878,"Aeromonas neutral protease possesses two residues critical to its activity. One has a pKa of 5.5 in both the free enzyme and the enzyme-substrate complex and must be deprotonated for maximal activity. The other, which ionizes at pH 7.1 in the free enzyme and at pH 7.4 in the enzyme-substrate complex, must be protonated for optimal enzyme action. The protease is reversibly inhibited by aminoacyl hydroxamates, peptides containing a phenylalanyl residue, phosphoryl-L-phenylalanylglycylglycine, and by beta-phenylpropionyl-L-phenylalanine. The pH dependence of inhibition by the latter revealed that a residue with a pKa of 5.6 influences inhibitor binding. Compounds containing both a hydroxamido group and a chloroacetyl group are particularly effective in inactivating the enzyme, and inhibition is enhanced by hydrophobic residues. Thus, a 33-fold molar excess of chloroacetyl-N-hydroxy-L-phenylalanyl-L-alanyl-L-alanine amide rapidly inactivated Aeromonas neutral protease. Carbethoxylation experiments resulted in a 90% loss in activity which was fully reversible by hydroxylamine; spectral analysis indicated the involvement of a single histidine residue. Protection against both esterification and carbethoxylation was furnished by the presence of beta-phenylproprionyl-L-phenylalanine. Inactivation experiments suggest that a glutamic or aspartic acid and a histidine residue are responsible for the pKa values revealed by pH dependence studies."
https://openalex.org/W1590125449,"The human T cell hybrid II23 was isolated from fusions between human peripheral blood lymphocytes which had been stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and a subline of the human T cell line CEM called CEM.TET1. This hybrid does not constitutively express detectable levels of interleukin 2 (IL 2) receptors but can be induced to express receptors by stimuli shown to activate T cells. Antibody to CD3 (a component of the T cell receptor) coupled to agarose or PHA (greater than 3 micrograms/ml) induced both IL 2 production and receptor expression on II23 cells. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) induced IL 2 receptor expression on II23 cells but not IL 2 secretion. Because PMA is a known activator of the Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme protein kinase C, proteins of stimulated and unstimulated cells were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis for changes in phosphoprotein patterns. A Mr 70,000 protein with a pI of 6.2 was phosphorylated in hybrids stimulated by PMA, anti-CD3 antibody coupled to agarose or PHA, i.e. by the same stimuli which induce IL 2 receptors on these cells. The immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A inhibited IL 2 release without altering induction of IL 2 receptors or phosphorylation of the Mr 70,000 protein. The 70-kDa protein was located in the cytosol, where it remained phosphorylated for at least 4 h after stimulation. A protein with the same migratory properties on two-dimensional gels was similarly phosphorylated after stimulation of normal peripheral blood T lymphocytes, indicating that the phenomenon was not due to hybridization or transformation. This 70-kDA protein may therefore be involved in the pathway which leads to the transcription and expression of IL 2 receptors."
