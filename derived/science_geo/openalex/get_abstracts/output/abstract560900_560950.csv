https://openalex.org/W2395517506,"From neutral to new Many of the particles in the troposphere are formed in situ, but what fraction of all tropospheric particles do they constitute and how exactly are they made? Bianchi et al. report results from a high-altitude research station. Roughly half of the particles were newly formed by the condensation of highly oxygenated multifunctional compounds. A combination of laboratory results, field measurements, and model calculations revealed that neutral nucleation is more than 10 times faster than ion-induced nucleation, that particle growth rates are size-dependent, and that new particle formation occurs during a limited time window.

These individuals also have a risk of premature cardiovascular disease. The effect of activated monocyte exosomes (Exos) on endothelial cells is unknown. To determine whether Exos from immune-activated monocytes could alter endothelial cell expression and contribute to monocyte/macrophage transmigration and adhesion, we isolated Exos from monocytes stimulated with IFNa, LPS, or both (I/L). We show that monocyte Exos contain different inflammatory microRNA cargo depending on stimulation. When LPS Exos or I/L Exos were added to HUVECs, we found a significant increase in adhesion molecule ICAM-1, chemokine ligand (CCL)-2, and cytokine IL-6 mRNAs and proteins compared with cells treated with IFNα Exos or Exos derived from unstimulated monocytes. Inhibition of transcription factor NF-κB, a common inflammatory cytokine pathway, prevented induction of CCL2, IL6, and ICAM1. Inhibition of TLR4 resulted in differential blockage of the targets. Our results demonstrate for the first time that primary human monocyte Exos enter endothelial cells and cause dysfunction via the TLR4 and NF-κB pathways, which may contribute to heart disease in HIV infection and other diseases involving chronic immune activation.—Tang, N., Sun, B., Gupta, A., Rempel, H., Pulliam, L.

https://openalex.org/W2351208027,"Nanoparticles (NPs) are widely used as components of drugs or cosmetics and hold great promise for biomedicine, yet their effects on cell physiology remain poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that clathrin-independent dynamin 2-mediated caveolar uptake of surface-functionalized silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) impairs cell viability due to lysosomal dysfunction. We show that internalized SiNPs accumulate in lysosomes resulting in inhibition of autophagy-mediated protein turnover and impaired degradation of internalized epidermal growth factor, whereas endosomal recycling proceeds unperturbed. This phenotype is caused by perturbed delivery of cargo via autophagosomes and late endosomes to SiNP-filled cathepsin B/L-containing lysosomes rather than elevated lysosomal pH or altered mTOR activity. Given the importance of autophagy and lysosomal protein degradation for cellular proteostasis and clearance of aggregated proteins, these results raise the question of beneficial use of NPs in biomedicine and beyond."
https://openalex.org/W2404703682,"Soluble forms of the IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) bind to the cytokine IL-6 with similar affinity as the membrane-bound IL-6R. IL-6·sIL-6R complexes initiate IL-6 trans-signaling via activation of the ubiquitously expressed membrane-bound β-receptor glycoprotein 130 (gp130). Inhibition of IL-6 trans-signaling has been shown to be favorable in numerous inflammatory diseases. Furthermore, different soluble forms of gp130 (sgp130) exist that, together with the sIL-6R, are thought to form a buffer for IL-6 in the blood. However, a functional role for the different sgp130 forms has not been described to date. Here we demonstrate that the metalloproteases ADAM10 and ADAM17 can produce sgp130 by ectodomain shedding of gp130, even though this mechanism only accounts for a minor proportion of sgp130 in the circulation. We further show that full-length sgp130 and the shorter forms sgp130-rheumatoid arthritis-associated peptide (RAPS) and sgp130-E10 are differentially expressed in a cell type- specific manner. Remarkably, full-length sgp130 is expressed by monocytes, but this expression is completely lost during differentiation into macrophages in vitro Using genetically engineered murine pre-B cells that secrete different forms of sgp130, we found that these secreted sgp130 proteins are able to prevent trans-signaling-driven cell proliferation of the secreting cells, whereas conditioned supernatant from these cells failed to block IL-6 trans-signaling in other cells. Thus, our data suggest that the different sgp130 forms are released from cells into their immediate surroundings and appear to form cell-associated gradients to modulate their own susceptibility for IL-6 trans-signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2376240640,"Parkinson disease (PD) is second only to Alzheimer disease as the most common human neurodegenerative disorder. Despite intense investigation, no interdictive therapy is available for PD. Recent studies indicate that both innate and adaptive immune processes are active in PD. Accordingly, we found a rapid increase in RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) and eotaxin, chemokines that are involved in T cell trafficking, in vivo in the substantia nigra pars compacta and the serum of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-intoxicated mice. RANTES and eotaxin were also up-regulated in the substantia nigra pars compacta of post-mortem PD brains as compared with age-matched controls. Therefore, we investigated whether neutralization of RANTES and eotaxin could protect against nigrostriatal degeneration in MPTP-intoxicated mice. Interestingly, after peripheral administration, functional blocking antibodies against RANTES and eotaxin reduced the infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells into the nigra, attenuated nigral expression of proinflammatory molecules, and suppressed nigral activation of glial cells. These findings paralleled dopaminergic neuronal protection, normalized striatal neurotransmitters, and improved motor functions in MPTP-intoxicated mice. Therefore, we conclude that attenuation of the chemokine-dependent adaptive immune response may be of therapeutic benefit for PD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2399249239,"Interferon-γ-secreting CD4+ helper T cells are required for antibody access to neuronal tissues in response to neurotropic virus infections. Norifumi Iijima and Akiko Iwasaki investigate the mechanism of antibody-mediated protection within barrier-protected tissues using a mouse model of genital herpes infection. They find that interferon-γ-secreting CD4+ helper T cells are required for antibody access to neuronal tissues in response to challenge with herpes simplex virus 2. These results point to a previously unappreciated role of CD4+ T cells in mobilizing antibodies to the peripheral sites of infection where they help to limit viral spread. Circulating antibodies can access most tissues to mediate surveillance and elimination of invading pathogens. Immunoprivileged tissues such as the brain and the peripheral nervous system are shielded from plasma proteins by the blood–brain barrier1 and blood–nerve barrier2, respectively. Yet, circulating antibodies must somehow gain access to these tissues to mediate their antimicrobial functions. Here we examine the mechanism by which antibodies gain access to neuronal tissues to control infection. Using a mouse model of genital herpes infection, we demonstrate that both antibodies and CD4 T cells are required to protect the host after immunization at a distal site. We show that memory CD4 T cells migrate to the dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord in response to infection with herpes simplex virus type 2. Once inside these neuronal tissues, CD4 T cells secrete interferon-γ and mediate local increase in vascular permeability, enabling antibody access for viral control. A similar requirement for CD4 T cells for antibody access to the brain is observed after intranasal challenge with vesicular stomatitis virus. Our results reveal a previously unappreciated role of CD4 T cells in mobilizing antibodies to the peripheral sites of infection where they help to limit viral spread."
https://openalex.org/W2371433736,"Global control of tuberculosis has become increasingly complicated with the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. First-line treatments are anchored by two antibiotics, rifampin and isoniazid. Most rifampin resistance occurs through the acquisition of missense mutations in the rifampin resistance-determining region, an 81-base pair region encoding the rifampin binding site on the β subunit of RNA polymerase (rpoB). Although these mutations confer a survival advantage in the presence of rifampin, they may alter the normal process of transcription, thereby imposing significant fitness costs. Because the downstream biochemical consequences of the rpoB mutations are unknown, we used an organism-wide screen to identify the number and types of lipids changed after rpoB mutation. A new mass spectrometry-based profiling platform systematically compared ∼10,000 cell wall lipids in a panel of rifampin-resistant mutants within two genetically distinct strains, CDC1551and W-Beijing. This unbiased lipidomic survey detected quantitative alterations (>2-fold, p < 0.05) in more than 100 lipids in each mutant. By focusing on molecular events that change among most mutants and in both genetic backgrounds, we found that rifampin resistance mutations lead to altered concentrations of mycobactin siderophores and acylated sulfoglycolipids. These findings validate a new organism-wide lipidomic analysis platform for drug-resistant mycobacteria and provide direct evidence for characteristic remodeling of cell wall lipids in rifampin-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis. The specific links between rifampin resistance and named lipid factors provide diagnostic and therapeutic targets that may be exploited to address the problem of drug resistance.

The specific links between rifampin resistance and named lipid factors provide diagnostic and therapeutic targets that may be exploited to address the problem of drug resistance. Mycobacterium tuberculosis remains a leading cause of death worldwide from an infectious disease (1.Koul A. Arnoult E. Lounis N. Guillemont J. Andries K. The challenge of new drug discovery for tuberculosis.Nature. 2011; 469: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). The emergence of highly drug-resistant organisms has complicated efforts to control the global tuberculosis epidemic (2.Keshavjee S. Farmer P.E. Tuberculosis, drug resistance, and the history of modern medicine.N. Engl. J. Med. 2012; 367: 931-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). First-line tuberculosis treatment involves four drugs, the two most effective of which are isoniazid and rifampin. Strains resistant to rifampin alone, although once considered rare, now make up a large percentage of monoresistant M. tuberculosis isolates (3.Velayati A.A. Farnia P. Mozafari M. Sheikholeslami M.F. Karahrudi M.A. Tabarsi P. Hoffner S. High prevalence of rifampin-monoresistant tuberculosis: a retrospective analysis among Iranian pulmonary tuberculosis patients.Am. J. Trop Med.

Rifampicin mono-resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa: a significant phenomenon in a high prevalence TB-HIV region.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e77712Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Moreover, resistance to both rifampin and isoniazid constitutes a clinical state of multidrug resistance, which necessitates treatment with a complicated second-line regimen that is both more toxic and less effective than standard chemotherapy (5.Franke M.F. Appleton S.C. Mitnick C.D. Furin J.J. Bayona J. Chalco K. Shin S. Murray M. Becerra M.C. Aggressive regimens for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis reduce recurrence.Clin. Infect. Dis. 2013; 56: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, when identified, multidrug-resistant bacteria can be treated (5.Franke M.F. Appleton S.C. Mitnick C.D. Furin J.J. Bayona J. Chalco K. Shin S. Murray M. Becerra M.C. Aggressive regimens for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis reduce recurrence.Clin. Infect. Dis. 2013; 56: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Multidrug resistance is also a necessary intermediate in the evolution of even more highly resistant forms of M. tuberculosis, including those resistant to most or all available agents. Rifampin resistance is conferred by mutation of its target, the β subunit of the RNA polymerase (RpoB). 2The abbreviations used are: RpoBRNA polymerase BPDIMphthiocerol dimycocerosateSGLsulfoglycolipidESIelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry. In M. tuberculosis, most of the rifampin resistance in clinical isolates stems from amino acid changes at positions 513, 522, 526, and 531 of RpoB, which are near the rifampin binding site. Mutations at positions 531 and 526 are by far the most common and tend to show higher-level resistance (6.Cummings M.P. Segal M.R. Few amino acid positions in rpoB are associated with most of the rifampin resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.BMC Bioinformatics. 2004; 5: 137Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 7.Goldstein B.P. Resistance to rifampicin: a review.J. Antibiot. 2014; 67: 625-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The high correspondence between RpoB mutations and phenotypic rifampin resistance forms the basis of the now widely used “gene expert test,” in which rapid detection of rpoB mutation effectively bypasses the need for cumbersome in vitro culture methods in many situations (8.Boehme C.C. Nabeta P. Hillemann D. Nicol M.P. Shenai S. Krapp F. Allen J. Tahirli R. Blakemore R. Rustomjee R. Milovic A. Jones M. O'Brien S.M. Persing D.H. Ruesch-Gerdes S. et al.Rapid molecular detection of tuberculosis and rifampin resistance.N. Engl. J. Med. 2010; 363: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar). The discrepancy between the number of rpoB mutations observed clinically and in vitro suggests that many rpoB mutations confer a significant fitness cost in vivo. Supporting this idea, secondary mutations have been observed in patients (9.Comas I. Borrell S. Roetzer A. Rose G. Malla B. Kato-Maeda M. Galagan J. Niemann S. Gagneux S. Whole-genome sequencing of rifampicin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains identifies compensatory mutations in RNA polymerase genes.Nat. Genet. 2012; 44: 106-110Crossref Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Thus, genetic mutation of this target is a common upstream event in rifampin resistance generation. Therefore, a more detailed understanding of the consequences of rpoB mutation could potentially provide diagnostic targets and a physiological understanding of mycobacterial adaptation to rifampin resistance as a core part of the multidrug resistance phenotype. RNA polymerase B phthiocerol dimycocerosate sulfoglycolipid electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The mechanism by which rpoB mutations cause rifampicin resistance has been inferred from classic experiments in Escherichia coli that showed that specific rifampin resistance causing rpoB mutations altered aspects of transcription (10.Ezekiel D.H. Hutchins J.E. Mutations affecting RNA polymerase associated with rifampicin resistance in Escherichia coli.Nature. 1968; 220: 276-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 11.Tocchini-Valentini G.P. Marino P. Colvill A.J. Mutant of E. coli containing an altered DNA-dependent RNA polymerase.Nature. 1968; 220: 275-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Transcriptomic analysis of M. tuberculosis after rpoB mutation likewise demonstrates durable transcriptional change in this species (12.de Knegt G.J. Bruning O. ten Kate M.T. de Jong M. van Belkum A. Endtz H.P. Breit T.M. Bakker-Woudenberg I.A. de Steenwinkel J.E.

Bacteriol. 2012; 194: 6441-6452Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, the specific downstream consequences of an altered transcription apparatus on cell physiology, metabolism, and function are less clear. Transcriptional profiling of rifampin-resistant M. tuberculosis demonstrates changes in the expression of genes encoding secreted proteins, and proteomic profiling demonstrates alterations in some enzymes and lipid biosynthetic intermediates in the phthiocerol dimycocerosate (PDIM) pathway (12.de Knegt G.J. Bruning O. ten Kate M.T. de Jong M. van Belkum A. Endtz H.P. Breit T.M. Bakker-Woudenberg I.A. de Steenwinkel J.E.

However, the extent to which rifampin resistance alters PDIM structures or concentrations or controls remodeling of other biochemical components of the multilayered cell wall remains unknown. Cell wall lipids, particularly cell surface polyketides, interface directly with the host and regulate immunogens that are exposed to the host (14.Cambier C.J. Takaki K.K. Larson R.P. Hernandez R.E.

Also, if these candidate cell wall changes can be reproducibly associated with drug resistance phenotypes, then altered lipids might also function as biochemical markers of the drug-resistant state (19.Layre E. Moody D.B. Lipidomic profiling of model organisms and the world's major pathogens.Biochimie. 2013; 95: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Here we hypothesized that characteristic biochemical changes might occur with the acquisition of rifampin resistance in M. tuberculosis. Unlike other antibiotics that target specific chemical targets, such as enzymes that produce mycolic acid or peptidoglycan, the altered RpoB-dependent transcriptional apparatus would be expected to affect nearly any enzyme or regulator of lipid synthesis (7.Goldstein B.P. Resistance to rifampicin: a review.J. Antibiot. 2014; 67: 625-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Because there is no rational way to predict which lipids might be changed, we considered that an unbiased, organism-wide biochemical profiling approach would be most useful. Such analyses are now feasible as a result of the validation of comparative lipidomics platforms that use normal-phase HPLC-MS for separating and rapidly scanning many thousands of lipids in a single experiment (20.Layre E.

Using accurate mass retention time values as addresses, we can align all lipids present in both drug-resistant and drug-sensitive bacteria and generate thousands of intensity ratios for each aligned pair, providing an organism-wide screen for lipids altered in concentration after acquisition of rifampin resistance.

By applying these tools to a panel of isogenic rpoB mutants that represent both common and rare genetic changes seen in patient isolates, we sought to identify the scope of bacterial cell wall changes and identify the particular molecules common to all M. tuberculosis strains that have acquired rifampin resistance. CDC1551 and W-Beijing mycobacterial strains were cultivated in Middlebrook 7H9 broth medium supplemented with oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase, 0.05% Tween 80, and 0.5% glycerol for growth assays, to generate resistance mutants, and to count bacteria. Subsequently, Tween-free medium was used to generate samples for mass spectrometry analysis. Rifampin-resistant strains were selected in the presence of rifampin at a concentration of 2 μg/ml as published previously (24.Ford C.B. Shah R.R. Maeda M.K. Gagneux S. Murray M.B. Cohen T. Johnston J.C. Gardy J. Lipsitch M. Fortune S.M. Mycobacterium tuberculosis mutation rate estimates from different lineages predict substantial differences in the emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis.Nat. Genet. 2013; 45: 784-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Resistant colonies were picked and cultured in the absence of rifampin for subsequent analysis. All rpoB mutations were defined by Sanger sequencing of rpoB as published previously (24.Ford C.B. Shah R.R. Maeda M.K. Gagneux S. Murray M.B. Cohen T. Johnston J.C. Gardy J. Lipsitch M. Fortune S.M.

Serial dilutions of broth cultures cultivated in rifampin-free media were plated onto 7H10 plates supplemented with oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase and 0.5% glycerol to obtain a confluent lawn in 21 days. Cells were scraped into a methanol-chloroform suspension (2:1) for sterilization and lipid extraction with Optima HPLC-grade solvents (Fisher) and clean disposable borosilicate glassware (Fisher, Supelco) with Teflon-lined caps as described previously (20.Layre E.

Dried lipids were resuspended in chloroform and methanol (1:1, v/v), dried, and weighed (Mettler Toledo microbalance) prior to being resuspended in chloroform and methanol at 1 mg/ml. For quality control and to confirm normalization, 150 μg of cell wall lipids was spotted onto a silica thin-layer chromatography plate, developed with 60:35:5 (v/v/v, chloroform:methanol:water), and visualized with cupric acetate and charring. Mass normalization was further confirmed by comparative analysis of total ion current traces from lipid mixtures, ion monitoring of phosphatidylinositol, and continuous infusion of calibrants monitored at m/z 121.050873 and 922.009798 in positive ion mode and m/z 112.985587 and 1033.98810 in negative ion mode. We dried 100 μg of lipid extract under nitrogen and resuspended it at 0.5 mg/ml in solvent A (hexanes:isopropanol 70:30 (v/v), 0.02% (m/v) formic acid, 0.01% (m/v) ammonium hydroxide), filtered or centrifuged it at 1500 rpm for 5 min, and inspected it to assure lack of precipitation prior to transfer to a glass autosampler vial (Agilent) for analysis using an Agilent 6520 accurate mass quadrupole TOF and a 1200 series HPLC system with a Varian Monochrom diol column (3 μm × 150 mm × 2 mm) and a Varian Monochrom diol guard column (3 μm × 4.6 mm). 10 μg of lipid/sample was injected, and the column was eluted at 0.15 ml/min with a binary gradient from 0–100% solvent B (isopropanol:methanol 70:30 (v/v), 0.02% (m/v) formic acid, 0.01% (m/v) ammonium hydroxide): 0–10 min, 0% B; 17–22 min, 50% B; 30–35 min, 100% B; and 40–44 min, 0% B, followed by an additional 6-min 0% B post-run.

Briefly, peaks were deconvoluted and aligned across samples using signal-to-noise ratio threshold of 5, a maximum tolerated m/z deviation of 10 ppm, a frame width of mzdiff = 0.001, a peak width of 20–120 s, and a bandwidth of 5. The aligned output consisted of accurate mass, retention time, and intensity of each peak, exported as .tsv files or Microsoft Excel files for automatic annotation for compound matching within 10 ppm of the calculated mass (20.Layre E.

Automated annotation was confirmed based on retention times, accurate mass, and detection of the naturally occurring length and saturation variants documented in the MycoMap database. XCMS data matrices allowed pairwise comparison using paired Student's t test with multiple testing correction (27.Benjamini Y. Hocheberg Y. Controlling the false discovery rate: a practical and powerful approach to multiple testing.J. R. Stat. Soc. 1995; 57: 289-300Google Scholar). We generated mutants using two genetically distinct strains that were originally derived from patients and now serve as reference strains: the lineage 4 or Euro-American strain known as CDC1551 and the lineage 2 or W-Beijing strain HN878. From larger panels of isogenic mutants in each strain background, we selected mutants corresponding to amino acid substitution at positions 526, 531, and 513 in the rpoB gene. We focused on three mutations, H526Y, S531L, and Q513E, because we had identified them in both genetic backgrounds and because they correspond to the characteristic mutations occurring among clinical isolates during natural tuberculosis epidemics (28.Campbell E.A.

As expected from prior reports, the S531L and H526Y mutations had a minimal effect on bacterial growth compared with wild-type organisms, whereas the Q513E mutation had a small but detectable effect on fitness (Fig. 1A). An altered RNA polymerase might affect the expression of nearly any gene. However, where global profiling has been used, there is poor concordance between changes in transcript abundance and protein or small molecule abundance, presumably as a consequence of layers of posttranscriptional regulation. We therefore used an organism-wide profiling method to globally measure changes in mycobacterial cell wall lipids. Although most lipidomic or metabolomic methods focus on phospholipids, which constitute the bilayers of model eukaryotic cells and most bacteria, mycobacteria produce fewer phospholipids and more types of neutral lipids, including more than 90 subclasses of lipids that are unique to the order Actinomycetales (20.Layre E.

The rapid increase in multidrug-resistant bacterial strains is a problem of great concern to the medical and public health communities. Currently, the emergence of antibiotic resistance outpaces the development of antibiotic compounds (1.World Health Organization Antimicrobial Resistance: Global Report on Surveillance. WHO Press, World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland2014Google Scholar), stimulating interest in novel approaches to treat difficult infections. Therapies that enhance the bactericidal activity of host immune cells (e.g. neutrophils) represent one such alternative. Natural products have garnered substantial interest as lead points for identification of new pharmaceutical agents (2.Newman D.J. Cragg G.M. Snader K.M.

It has been proposed that the potentiation of apoptosis by anacardic acid results from inhibition of genes involved in cell survival and proliferation (9.Sung B. Pandey M.K. Ahn K.S. Yi T.

Given the importance of these pathways in the regulation of neutrophil function and innate immune activities, we investigated the actions of anacardic acid on human neutrophils, with an emphasis on the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), 3The abbreviations used are: NETneutrophil extracellular trapROSreactive oxygen speciesS1Psphingosine-1-phosphateS1PRS1P receptorMRSAmethicillin-resistant S. aureusDPIdiphenyleneiodoniumPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateCNSEcashew nut shell-extractedHBSSHanks' balanced salt solution. reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent, DNA-based structures coated with antimicrobial compounds that entrap and kill pathogens (16.Brinkmann V.

We assessed the ability of anacardic acid, either in a commercial fully saturated form or in its natural cashew nut shell extracted form, to directly kill bacteria. Cashew nut shell-extracted anacardic acid, a mixture of fully saturated, monoene, diene, and triene forms of anacardic acid, exhibited antimicrobial activity against three different Gram-positive bacterial species tested (MRSA, Staphylococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus agalactiae), but not against the two Gram-negative bacterial species tested (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) (Table 1). Commercial fully saturated anacardic acid was also ineffective at killing the Gram-negative bacterial test species but, despite showing antimicrobial activity against S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae, did not kill MRSA. In kinetic killing assays, anacardic acid was found to slow the growth of Gram-positive bacteria down to the lowest concentration tested, one-eighth of the minimum inhibitory concentration (Fig. 1).TABLE 1Minimum inhibitory concentration of anacardic acid against selected bacterial speciesBacterial species and strain testedCommercial fully saturated anacardic acidCashew nut shell extract anacardic acidμmμmS. aureus (USA300-TCH1516) methicillin-resistant>8020S. pyogenes (M49-NZ131)55S. agalactiae (serotype III-COH1)55E. coli (K12-DH5α)>80>80P. aeruginosa (PA01)>80>80 Open table in a new tab Oxidative burst was used as an initial indicator of neutrophil activation. The addition of anacardic acid to freshly isolated human neutrophils stimulated production of ROS over time (Fig. 2A) and in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). Induction of neutrophil ROS production was similar in response to commercial anacardic acid or anacardic acid extracted from cashew nut shells (Fig. 2C). Oxidative burst stimulation by anacardic acid was validated by quenching ROS with the NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium (DPI; Fig. 2D) and assessing ROS production via a flow cytometry-based assay (Fig. 2E). No induction of ROS was observed in response to salicylic acid, the core structure of anacardic acid, revealing that the alkyl chain of anacardic acid is required for activation of the neutrophil oxidative burst (Fig. 2F). Unlike PMA, accumulation of extracellular ROS was not observed upon anacardic acid treatment in a lucigenin-based extracellular ROS assay (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, neutrophil degranulation was not observed in response to anacardic acid treatment, suggesting that anacardic acid does not trigger a general activation of neutrophils (Fig. 3B). Immunocytochemical analysis revealed increased intracellular gp91phox levels in anacardic acid-treated neutrophils (Fig. 3C), but no significant release of the antimicrobial peptide LL-37 was detected (Fig. 3D). Finally, although anacardic acid is known to be a potential SUMOylation inhibitor (15.Pandey D. Chen F. Patel A. Wang C.-Y. Dimitropoulou C. Patel V.S. Rudic R.D. Stepp D.W. Fulton D.J. SUMO1 Negatively regulates reactive oxygen species production from NADPH oxidases.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2011; 31: 1634-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), under the conditions of these assays, no inhibition of SUMOylation was observed (Fig. 3E). Oxidative burst in neutrophils may precede the formation of NETs. We found that stimulation of neutrophils with anacardic acid not only triggered ROS production but also led to NET production (Fig. 4A). NET induction by anacardic was concentration-dependent (Fig. 4B), and addition of the NADPH oxidase inhibitor DPI blocked anacardic acid-induced NET formation (Fig. 4C). Although anacardic acid elicits a similar phenotype of ROS induction and NET formation as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a known PKC activator, anacardic acid treatment does not boost neutrophil PKC activity (Fig. 4D). To identify possible targets for anacardic acid on neutrophils, we utilized the similarity ensemble approach, an in silico platform that relates proteins based on the set-wise chemical similarity among their ligands (17.Keiser M.J. Roth B.L. Armbruster B.N. Ernsberger P. Irwin J.J. Shoichet B.K. Relating protein pharmacology by ligand chemistry.Nat. Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar). Several members of the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) family of G protein-coupled receptors were found to be possible targets (supplemental Table S1). In silico docking confirmed that anacardic acid may bind to this family of receptors, with anacardic acid predicted to bind to the S1P1 crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 3V2Y) at −8.09 kcal/mol. Predicted binding mode shows that the salicylic acid group of anacardic acid can establish hydrogen bonds with S1P1 residues Tyr29, Lys34, and Arg120, in a similar fashion to the phosphate group of sphingolipid mimic ML5 present in the crystal structure, wherein the pentadecyl aliphatic chain fills the large hydrophobic pocket, overlapping closely with the hydrophobic component of ML5 (Fig. 5A). The Tyr29, Lys34, and Arg120 residues are localized in highly conserved regions; amino acids Tyr29 and Arg120 are identical in the S1P1 and S1P4 receptors, whereas Lys34 is instead an arginine in S1PR4 (supplemental Fig. S1), suggesting that K34R should be capable of establishing the key hydrogen bond shown in Fig. 5A. Oxidative burst was blocked by CYM50358 hydrochloride, a S1PR4-selective antagonist but not VPC23019, a S1PR1 and S1PR3 antagonist, suggesting a critical role for S1PR4 in anacardic acid stimulation of neutrophils (Fig. 5B). Nearly complete (∼85%) and concentration-dependent inhibition of neutrophil activation by anacardic acid was observed using the CYM50358 hydrochloride inhibitor (Fig. 5C). Multiple signaling pathways have been implicated in neutrophil oxidative burst and NET production. Likewise, S1P receptors have also been linked to numerous signaling pathways. To assess the mechanism by which anacardic acid stimulates neutrophils, we tested a select panel of kinase inhibitors. We found that neutrophil stimulation by anacardic acid was blocked by inhibiting PI3K, but not by inhibiting Src tyrosine kinase or MEK (Fig. 6A). Consistent with this finding, an assessment of total/phospho-Akt and ERK revealed a significant increase in Akt phosphorylation in anacardic acid-treated neutrophils versus untreated controls (Fig. 6B). The dependence of anacardic acid-induced oxidative burst on PI3K was further confirmed in an assay using the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin, which significantly inhibited anacardic acid-induced increase in ROS (Fig. 6C). We used a NET-biased killing assay to determine the bactericidal capacity of NETs stimulated by anacardic acid, finding that such NETs were capable of killing USA300 MRSA (Fig. 7A), group A Streptococcus (Fig. 7B), and E. coli (Fig. 7C). In these figures, survival is presented as a percentage of compound-only control groups (e.g. without neutrophils). Notably, DNase almost completely reversed anacardic acid-mediated neutrophil killing of MRSA, whereas cytochalasin D had no significant effect, suggesting that such killing occurs primarily through NETs. Confocal microscopy and SYTO green/propidium iodide costaining revealed dead bacteria entrapped in NET structures stimulated by anacardic acid (Fig. 7D). Anacardic acid has long been used as a therapeutic agent in herbal medicine; although the molecular mechanisms underlying its activity are still poorly understood, its ability to modulate superoxide formation led us to investigate its effects on innate immune function and bacterial clearance. In addition to exhibiting direct antimicrobial effects against a series of important human Gram-positive pathogens, we found that anacardic acid enhanced neutrophil antibacterial function by promoting extracellular trap production. NETs are DNA-based structures that have been shown to play key role in pathogen clearance by neutrophils (18.von Köckritz-Blickwede M. Nizet V. Innate immunity turned inside-out: antimicrobial defense by phagocyte extracellular traps.J. Mol. Med. 2009; 87: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 19.Wartha F. Henriques-Normark B. ETosis: A novel cell death pathway.Sci. Signal. 2008; 1: pe25Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). We show that anacardic acid-induced NETs are capable of ensnaring and killing bacteria, which likely contributes to enhanced bactericidal activity of anacardic acid-treated neutrophils in vitro. Using computation approaches and known crystal structures, we identified the G protein-coupled sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors as likely targets of anacardic acid. This complements our previous finding that sphigosine-1-phosphate-related compounds, such as ceramide, can induce NET production in human neutrophils (20.Corriden R. Hollands A. Olson J. Derieux J. Lopez J. Chang J.T. Gonzalez D.J. Nizet V. Tamoxifen augments the innate immune function of neutrophils through modulation of intracellular ceramide.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 8369Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We found that the S1P4-selective antagonist CYM 50358 (21.Guerrero M. Urbano M. Velaparthi S. Zhao J. Schaeffer M.T. Brown S. Rosen H. Roberts E. Discovery, design and synthesis of the first reported potent and selective sphingosine-1-phosphate 4 (S1P4) receptor antagonists.Bioorg. Med. Chem.

The S1P4 receptor is predominantly expressed by immune cells, including neutrophils (22.Kihara Y. Mizuno H. Chun J. Lysophospholipid receptors in drug discovery.Exp. Cell Res. 2015; 333: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar); intriguingly, previous work has shown that mice deficient in S1P lyase, an enzyme that catalyzes degradation of S1P, exhibit features of an inflammatory response that is ameliorated by deletion of the S1P4 receptor (23.Allende M.L. Bektas M. Lee B.G. Bonifacino E. Kang J. Tuymetova G. Chen W. Saba J.D. Proia R.L.

Consistent with investigations using other pharmacological agents to stimulate NET production (19.Wartha F. Henriques-Normark B. ETosis: A novel cell death pathway.Sci. Signal. 2008; 1: pe25Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 24.Rada B. Jendrysik M.A. Pang L. Hayes C.P. Yoo D.-G. Park J.J. Moskowitz S.M. Malech H.L. Leto T.L. Pyocyanin-enhanced neutrophil extracellular trap formation requires the NADPH oxidase.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e54205Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), we found anacardic acid-induced NET production to be both ROS- and PI3K-dependent; this is in keeping with reports describing coupling of the S1P4 receptor to Gα12/13 (25.Gräler M.H. Grosse R. Kusch A. Kremmer E. Gudermann T. Lipp M. The sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor S1P4 regulates cell shape and motility via coupling to Gi and G12/13.J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 89: 507-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), which has been shown to trigger cell death pathways via activation of PI3K (26.Lappano R. Maggiolini M. G protein-coupled receptors: novel targets for drug discovery in cancer.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2011; 10: 47-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Given the diverse array of GPCRs acting through Gα12/13, our findings could help guide future efforts to identify novel and potentially more selective/potent, immune-boosting compounds. Natural products, such as anacardic acid, represent an important resource for drug discovery efforts and can yield not only potential therapeutic agents but also scaffolds on which to develop more potent and efficacious drugs. Our findings reveal a role of the S1P4 receptor as a mediator of NET production and identify anacardic acid as a potential lead compound to boost neutrophil function in innate immune defense. Commercial, fully saturated anacardic acid was obtained from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). Cashew nut shell-extracted (CNSE) anacardic acid was purified as previously described (10.Omanakuttan A. Nambiar J. Harris R.M. Bose C. Pandurangan N. Varghese R.K. Kumar G.B. Tainer J.A. Banerji A. Perry J.J. Nair B.G. Anacardic acid inhibits the catalytic activity of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and matrix metalloproteinase-9.Mol. Pharmacol. 2012; 82: 614-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar); the same preparation of CNSE anacardic acid was used in this study. CYM50358 and VPC23019 were obtained from Tocris Bioscience (Bristol, UK). Unless otherwise noted, all other compounds were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. E. coli (strain K12-DH5α), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (strain USA300-TCH1516), P. aeruginosa (strain PAO1), S. pyogenes (strain M49-NZ131), and S. agalactiae (strain COH1) were used in this study. Human venous blood was drawn from healthy volunteers, with heparin added as an anticoagulant, according to a protocol approved by the local ethics committee. Polymorphprep (Axis Shield, Dundee, Scotland) was used to isolate neutrophils according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, 20 ml of blood was layered on an equal volume of Polymorphprep in 50-ml conical tubes; after centrifugation for 30 min at 600 × g (24 °C, no brakes), the neutrophil layer was collected, resuspended in PBS in a fresh tube, and pelleted via centrifugation at 400 × g (24 °C, no brakes). Supernatant was aspirated, and cell pellets were gently resuspended prior to addition of 5 ml of TC grade H2O (with gentle mixing) to lyse erythrocytes. After 30 s, 45 ml of PBS was added, and the cells were centrifuged at 400 × g (24 °C, no brakes). Neutrophil pellets were gently resuspended in 1 ml of PBS, counted, and kept at room temperature at a concentration of 1 × 107 cells/ml until used in experiments. To assess antimicrobial activity of anacardic acid in solution, bacteria were first grown in sterile Todd Hewitt broth to early log phase (A600 =0.1). Bacterial suspensions (50 μl) were then distributed in 96-well plates and 2-fold serial dilutions of anacardic acid (either commercial or CNSE) were added. Absorbance at 600 nm was measured before and after overnight incubation at 37 °C, and minimum inhibitory concentration values were determined based on the ability of compounds to inhibit bacterial proliferation by at least 80%. Glass tubes containing Todd Hewitt broth with or without anacardic acid or CNSE anacardic acid were inoculated with a sufficient volume of overnight bacterial culture to yield an optical density (600 nm) = 0.1. Cultures were incubated at 37 °C (with shaking), and optical density was monitored over time with a Spectronic 20D+ spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) to assess bacterial growth rates. Neutrophils were resuspended in HBSS (with Ca2+/Mg2+) at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml and added to 96-well plates (2 × 105 cells/well). HBSS and various concentrations of either anacardic acid or CNSE anacardic acid were added to applicable wells to a final volume of 200 μl. Following 2 h of incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO2, 50 milliunits of micrococcal nuclease (in a volume of 50 μl) was added to each well. After 10 min of incubation at 37 °C, EDTA was added to each well (final concentration, 5 mm) to stop the nuclease reaction. The plates were then centrifuged for 8 min at 200 × g, and 100-μl supernatant samples were collected and transferred to a flat-bottomed 96-well assay plate. DNA was quantified using PicoGreen DNA dye (Life Technologies) and a SpectraMax M3 plate reader (Molecular Devices) as per the manufacturers' instructions. NET production was stimulated with anacardic acid or CNSE anacardic acid in 96-well plates as described above. After 2 h of incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO2, the cells were fixed by addition of 16% paraformaldehyde (4% final concentration; 30 min incubation at room temperature). After blocking for 45 min with PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin (2% PBS-BSA) and 2% goat serum, the cells were incubated for 1 h with rabbit anti-human myeloperoxidase primary antibody (1:300 in 2% PBS-BSA; Dako North America, Inc., Carpinteria, CA; product no. A0398) and 45 min (protected from light) with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:500 in 2% BSA-PBS; Life Technologies). The cells were then incubated with 1 μm DAPI for 10 min. The cells were washed three times with PBS after each staining step, all performed at room temperature. The images were obtained using a Zeiss AxioObserver D1 microscope equipped with an LD A-Plan 20×/0.35 Ph1 objective. Neutrophils were plated on glass coverslips in 24-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well, and NET production was stimulated by adding 10 μm anacardic acid and incubating at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 2 h. In parallel, S. aureus bacteria were stained using a LIVE/DEAD BacLight kit (Life Technologies) as per the manufacturer's instructions; after stimulation of NET production, bacteria were added to wells containing neutrophils at an multiplicity of infection of 10 and spun at 1600 rpm for 10 min. To assess the presence of live/dead bacteria in NETs, images were captured using an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope equipped with a 63× objective. Neutrophils (1 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C with gentle agitation in Ca2+/Mg2+-free HBSS plus 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate. Subsequently, the cells were centrifuged at 1600 rpm for 10 min (room temperature), washed with HBSS, and centrifuged again using the same settings. After resuspension in HBSS at 5 × 106 cells/ml with anacardic acid, CNSE anacardic acid, salicylic acid, or PMA with or without the ROS scavenger DPI, cells (100 μl) were either added to a 96-well assay plate to assess fluorescence intensity using a SpectraMax M3 plate reader (485-nm excitation, and 530-nm emission) or 12 × 75-mm tubes for analysis on a FACSCalibur cell analyzer (BD Biosciences). To quantify extracellular ROS, the cells were seeded in black plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well in the presence of 10 μm lucigenin (Sigma-Aldrich) prior to the addition of anacardic acid or PMA. ROS release was determined via quantification of luminescence on an EnSpire Plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the standard luminescence protocol. Neutrophils were seeded in a 24-well plate at a density of 1 × 106 cells/well in HBSS with Ca2+/Mg2+. The cells were then spun for 5 min at 400 × g. Following addition of anacardic acid or PMA, cells were incubated for 30–60 min at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Supernatant samples (3 μl) were then collected and spotted on a nitrocellulose membrane, which was blocked in PBST with 5% fat-free milk for 1 h, washed three times with PBS, and incubated using an LL-37 (1:1000) antibody overnight (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Following three washes, the cells were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody for 1 h prior to membrane development. Total/phospho-Akt/Erk ELISA. Relative levels of total/phospho-Akt/Erk were determined using InstantOne ELISA kits (eBiosciences, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol, with minor modifications. The cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well in HBSS + 5% FBS (total volume, 20 μl) and allowed to equilibrate for 1 h. Anacardic acid, PMA, or HBSS was then added (20 μl of 2× stock) to applicable wells, and the cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The cells were then lysed in lysis buffer provided by the manufacturer with the addition of 50 μl/ml 50× protease inhibitor mixture (cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Mixture Tablets; Roche). Subsequent steps were performed as directed in the manufacturer's protocol, and absorbance at 450 nm was performed using EnSpire Plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The ratio of total/phospho-Akt and -ERK was determined for all treatment groups and plotted as fold change above untreated control samples. Neutrophils were seeded in Nunc LabTek 8-well chambered coverglass slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well. Following addition of 10 μm anacardic acid or vehicle control (HBSS), the cells were incubated for indicated times at 37 °C with 5% CO2 prior to the addition of 16% paraformaldehyde (4% final concentration). Following 1 h of block/permeabilization in 2% BSA-PBS with 2% normal goat serum and 0.25% Triton X-100, fixed cells were washed three times with PBS prior to incubation for 1 h with an anti-NOX2/gp91phox antibody (1 μg/ml in 2% BSA-PBS; Abcam; product no. ab80508). The cells were then washed three times with PBS prior to incubation with an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:500; Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 h in 2% BSA-PBS. Following an additional three washes in PBS, the cells were incubated for 10 min with 1 mm Hoechst-33342-trihydrochloride to stain nuclei. Images were obtained using a Zeiss AxioObserver D1 microscope equipped with a plan Apochromat 63×/1.4 objective. Neutrophils in RPMI + 2% 70 °C heat-inactivated FBS were added to a 24-well plate at a density of 4 × 105 cells/well with or without anacardic acid. After a 4-h incubation at 37 °C (with 5% CO2), 4 × 104 bacteria were added to each well (multiplicity of infection of 0.1), and plates were spun at 1600 rpm for 5 min. After an additional 15-min incubation at 37 °C (with 5% CO2), supernatant samples were serially diluted in 96-well plates containing sterile H2O and plated on Todd Hewitt broth agar plates to determine percentage survival versus inoculum. HeLa cells were plated on sterilized glass coverslips in 35-mm dishes in DME containing 10% FBS. The cells were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and upon reaching 60–80% confluency were transfected with CKAR, a FRET-based reporter for PKC-mediated phosphorylation, using jetPRIME (Polyplus-transfection). Following a 24-h incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO2, the cells were washed with HBSS (Cellgro) containing 1 mm CaCl2 prior to imaging on a Zeiss Axiovert microscope. To assess PKC activation levels, anacardic acid was added to cells, and cyan fluorescent protein, yellow fluorescent protein, and FRET images were acquired and used to calculate the average FRET ratio as previously described (27.Violin J.D. Zhang J. Tsien R.Y. Newton A.C. A genetically encoded fluorescent reporter reveals oscillatory phosphorylation by protein kinase C.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Following the addition of anacardic acid, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, a PKC activator, was added as a positive control. Neutrophils were seeded in 24-well plates in serum-free RPMI with or without anacardic acid. After 2 h, the cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed using radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1% deoxcholic acid supplemented with protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). The BCA assay (Thermo Scientific) was used to determine the protein concentration. Equal amounts of total protein were loaded and separated on 10% or 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk and washed in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) twice for 5 min each. The membranes were subsequently incubated with SUMO-2/3 primary antibody (1:200 in TBST; Life Technologies; product no. 51-9100) at 1 μg/ml in 5% BSA/TBST. Following overnight incubation at 4οC, the membranes were washed and treated with a HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) for 1 h at room temperature. Signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposed on Kodak BioMax light film. AutoDockTools (version 1.5.6) (28.Morris G.M. Huey R. Lindstrom W. Sanner M.F.

The receptor structure (Protein Data Bank code 3V2Y) was prepared by removing non-standard residues, adding hydrogens and charges, and generating the PDBQT file. Anacardic acid three-dimensional coordinates have been generated from SMILES string using OpenBabel (29.O'Boyle N.M. Banck M. James C.A. Morley C. Vandermeersch T. Hutchison G.R.

Cheminform. 2011; 3: 33Crossref PubMed Scopus (4744) Google Scholar), and then AutoDockTools was used to add charges, merge non-polar hydrogens, set rotatable bonds, and generate the PDBQT. A cubic box of 70 points (26.25 Å side) was approximately centered on the crystallographic ligand (x, 5.220; y, 17.347; and z, −9.225), and docking was performed using Autodock 4.2.5.1. Default Lamarckian genetic algorithm settings were used, generating 1000 poses, which have been clustered using 2.0 Å, RMSD, and the lowest energy pose was selected to be analyzed. All statistical analyses described in the figure legends were performed using GraphPad Prism version 5.0. G. B. K., B. G. N., and J. J. P.

However, the mechanism by which CD133 regulates metastasis remains largely unknown. Here, we report that CD133 knockdown inhibits cancer cell migration, and CD133 overexpression promotes cell migration. CD133 expression is beneficial to activate the Src-focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling pathway. Further studies show that CD133 could interact with Src, and the region between amino acids 845 and 857 in the CD133 C-terminal domain is indispensable for its interaction with Src. The interaction activates Src to phosphorylate its substrate FAK and to promote cell migration. Likewise, a Src binding-deficient CD133 mutant loses the abilities to increase Src and FAK phosphorylation and to promote cell migration. Inhibition of Src activity by PP2, a known Src activity inhibitor, could block the activation of FAK phosphorylation and cell migration induced by CD133. In summary, our data suggest that activation of FAK by the interaction between CD133 and Src promotes cell migration, providing clues to understand the migratory mechanism of CD133+ tumor cells.

https://openalex.org/W2406081450,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been extensively examined in pathological cardiac hypertrophy. However, few studies focused on profiling the miRNA alterations in physiological hypertrophic hearts. In this study we generated a transgenic mouse model with cardiac-specific overexpression of miR-223. Our results showed that elevation of miR-223 caused physiological cardiac hypertrophy with enhanced cardiac function but no fibrosis. Using the next generation RNA sequencing, we observed that most of dys-regulated genes (e.g. Atf3/5, Egr1/3, Sfrp2, Itgb1, Ndrg4, Akip1, Postn, Rxfp1, and Egln3) in miR-223-transgenic hearts were associated with cell growth, but they were not directly targeted by miR-223. Interestingly, these dys-regulated genes are known to regulate the Akt signaling pathway. We further identified that miR-223 directly interacted with 3′-UTRs of FBXW7 and Acvr2a, two negative regulators of the Akt signaling. However, we also validated that miR-223 directly inhibited the expression of IGF-1R and β1-integrin, two positive regulators of the Akt signaling. Lastly, Western blotting did reveal that Akt was activated in miR-223-overexpressing hearts. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of miR-223 in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes induced cell hypertrophy, which was blocked by the addition of MK2206, a specific inhibitor of Akt. Taken together, these data represent the first piece of work showing that miR-223 tips the balance of promotion and inactivation of Akt signaling cascades toward activation of Akt, a key regulator of physiological cardiac hypertrophy.

https://openalex.org/W2349745980,"Elevated IGF-1/insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) autocrine/paracrine signaling in patients with renal cell carcinoma is associated with poor prognosis of the disease independent of their von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) status. Increased expression of IGF-1R in renal cancer cells correlates with their potency of tumor development and progression. The mechanism by which expression of IGF-1R is increased in renal carcinoma is not known. We report that VHL-deficient and VHL-positive renal cancer cells possess significantly decreased levels of mature, pre-, and pri-miR-214 than normal proximal tubular epithelial cells. We identified an miR-214 recognition element in the 3′UTR of IGF-1R mRNA and confirmed its responsiveness to miR-214. Overexpression of miR-214 decreased the IGF-1R protein levels, resulting in the inhibition of Akt kinase activity in both types of renal cancer cells. IGF-1 provoked phosphorylation and inactivation of PRAS40 in an Akt-dependent manner, leading to the activation of mTORC1 signal transduction to increase phosphorylation of S6 kinase and 4EBP-1. Phosphorylation-deficient mutants of PRAS40 and 4EBP-1 significantly inhibited IGF-1R-driven proliferation of renal cancer cells. Expression of miR-214 suppressed IGF-1R-induced phosphorylation of PRAS40, S6 kinase, and 4EBP-1, indicating inhibition of mTORC1 activity. Finally, miR-214 significantly blocked IGF-1R-forced renal cancer cell proliferation, which was reversed by expression of 3′UTR-less IGF-1R and constitutively active mTORC1.

https://openalex.org/W2277215203,"Here we present a detailed analysis of the alternative splicing regulation of human CD46, which generates different isoforms with distinct functions. CD46 is a ubiquitous membrane protein that protects host cells from complement and plays other roles in immunity, autophagy, and cell adhesion. CD46 deficiency causes an autoimmune disorder, and this protein is also involved in pathogen infection and cancer. Before this study, the mechanisms of CD46 alternative splicing remained unexplored even though dysregulation of this process has been associated with autoimmune diseases. We proved that the 5′ splice sites of CD46 cassette exons 7 and 8 encoding extracellular domains are defined by noncanonical mechanisms of base pairing to U1 small nuclear RNA. Next we characterized the regulation of CD46 cassette exon 13, whose inclusion or skipping generates different cytoplasmic tails with distinct functions. Using splicing minigenes, we identified multiple exonic and intronic splicing enhancers and silencers that regulate exon 13 inclusion via trans-acting splicing factors like PTBP1 and TIAL1. Interestingly, a common splicing activator such as SRSF1 appears to repress CD46 exon 13 inclusion. We also report that expression of CD46 mRNA isoforms is further regulated by non-sense-mediated mRNA decay and transcription speed. Finally, we successfully manipulated CD46 exon 13 inclusion using antisense oligonucleotides, opening up opportunities for functional studies of the isoforms as well as for therapeutics for autoimmune diseases.

We proved that the 5′ splice sites of CD46 cassette exons 7 and 8 encoding extracellular domains are defined by noncanonical mechanisms of base pairing to U1 small nuclear RNA. Next we characterized the regulation of CD46 cassette exon 13, whose inclusion or skipping generates different cytoplasmic tails with distinct functions. Using splicing minigenes, we identified multiple exonic and intronic splicing enhancers and silencers that regulate exon 13 inclusion via trans-acting splicing factors like PTBP1 and TIAL1. Interestingly, a common splicing activator such as SRSF1 appears to repress CD46 exon 13 inclusion. We also report that expression of CD46 mRNA isoforms is further regulated by non-sense-mediated mRNA decay and transcription speed. Finally, we successfully manipulated CD46 exon 13 inclusion using antisense oligonucleotides, opening up opportunities for functional studies of the isoforms as well as for therapeutics for autoimmune diseases. This study provides insight into CD46 alternative splicing regulation with implications for its function in the immune system and for genetic disease. CD46 is a ubiquitously expressed type I membrane-bound protein with a main function of protecting human host cells from complement (1.Seya T. Turner J.R. Atkinson J.P.

CD46 exerts such function by acting as a cofactor for Factor I-mediated cleavage of C3b and C4b (1.Seya T. Turner J.R. Atkinson J.P.

In addition, CD46 acts as a co-stimulator of T and other immune cells (2.Astier A. Trescol-Biémont M.C. Azocar O. Lamouille B. Rabourdin-Combe C.

All of these studies underline the multiple connections between CD46 and human disease and the relevance of studying the regulation of CD46 expression. The joining of exons in different combinations, by means of alternative splicing, gives rise to multiple mRNA and protein isoforms (24.Nilsen T.W. Graveley B.R. Expansion of the eukaryotic proteome by alternative splicing.Nature. 2010; 463: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar).

Conversely, inclusion or skipping of cassette exon 13, respectively, generates two mutually exclusive cytoplasmic tails, denoted as CYT1 and CYT2, which are encoded by either exon 13 or exon 14.

The proteolytic cleavage of CYT1 upon co-activation of CD46 induces interferon-γ (IFNγ) production in T helper 1 cells, and subsequent differentiation to T regulatory 1 (Tr1) cells, which typically secrete the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. CYT2 is processed at a later time to terminate the anti-inflammatory Tr1 response and restore homeostasis (31.Cardone J. Le Friec G. Vantourout P. Roberts A. Fuchs A. Jackson I. Suddason T. Lord G.

The expression of both cytoplasmic tails is essential for modulating the T helper 1 response because defective CD46-induced Tr1 differentiation or Tr1-induced IL-10 production is associated with the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases like asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis (15.Astier A.L.

The regulatory mechanisms of these trans-acting factors include direct interactions with the spliceosome, inhibition of exon or intron definition, or looping out an exon (34.Cartegni L. Chew S.L.

The regulation of alternative splicing is complex and context-dependent and thus requires intensive studies. Here we performed serial deletions in splicing minigenes to identify enhancers and silencers that regulate exon 13 inclusion. Additionally, we identified several proteins that likely act via these cis-acting elements and elucidated their functions in alternative splicing of exon 13 by loss- and gain-of-function assays. This is the first report to describe the regulation of CD46 alternative splicing. A previous study reported that CD46 splice isoforms are differentially expressed across tissues (45.Johnstone R.W. Russell S.M. Loveland B.E. McKenzie I.F. Polymorphic expression of CD46 protein isoforms due to tissue-specific RNA splicing.Mol. Immunol. 1993; 30: 1231-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We verified these findings by analyzing the alternative splicing patterns of CD46 in 20 human tissues using semiquantitative RT-PCR. Both CD46 cytoplasmic tail isoforms were detected in all tissue RNAs with a predominance of CYT2 by exon 13 skipping, suggesting that inclusion of exon 13 is generally repressed (Fig. 1A, upper panel). The exon 13 inclusion level varied in different tissues, ranging from 6 to 47%. At least two STP isoforms were observed in all tissues, and the two predominant isoforms are inclusion of a single exon and of two exons (Fig. 1A, lower panel). The identities of the included exons were determined by PCR with exon 7-, 8-, or 9-specific primers. The exon that was included alone is exon 9 giving rise to the C isoform, whereas exons 8 and 9 were included together in mRNA giving rise to the BC isoform. Most tissues predominantly express either C or BC isoforms, whereas nearly equivalent expression of both C and BC isoform is seen in prostate, thyroid, and trachea (Fig. 1A, lanes 13, 19, and 20). A few tissues, such as bladder and brain, show a faint band corresponding to skipping of all three STP exons (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 3), and a low level of exon 7-containing isoforms (with all three STP exons) was detected in lung, ovary, placenta, and testes (Fig. 1A, lanes 10–12 and 17). Furthermore, there was virtually no correlation for the inclusion of exons 8 and 13 across the 20 tissues (data not shown), suggesting that the regulation of these two cassette exons is independent. Largely consistent with previous findings (45.Johnstone R.W. Russell S.M. Loveland B.E. McKenzie I.F. Polymorphic expression of CD46 protein isoforms due to tissue-specific RNA splicing.Mol. Immunol. 1993; 30: 1231-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), CD46 isoform expression changes across different tissues, and the two most predominant isoforms are C-CYT2 and BC-CYT2. The exon 7 and 8 5′ss sequences substantially deviate from the consensus, and they can only establish 5 Watson-Crick base pairs with U1 snRNA in the canonical register, which is the main mechanism of 5′ss selection (Fig. 1B) (46.Roca X. Akerman M. Gaus H. Berdeja A. Bennett C.F. Krainer A.R. Widespread recognition of 5′ splice sites by noncanonical base-pairing to U1 snRNA involving bulged nucleotides.Genes Dev. 2012; 26: 1098-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 47.Roca X.

However, if 2 nucleotides at 5′ss positions +3 and +4 and 1 nucleotide at U1 snRNA position 6 form an asymmetric loop in the U1/5′ss helix, this allows formation of 4 additional base pairs, thus stabilizing this interaction (Fig. 1B). We hypothesized that these 5′ss are recognized by this register that we named asymmetric loop 1 (+3/+4), which indicates the difference of the looped nucleotides and the looped 5′ss positions in parentheses (48.Tan J. Ho J.X. Zhong Z. Luo S. Chen G. Roca X. Noncanonical registers and base pairs in human 5′ splice site selection.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44: 3908-3921Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We performed mutational and suppressor U1 experiments to test whether these two 5′ss utilize the asymmetric loop register for U1 recognition (46.Roca X. Akerman M. Gaus H. Berdeja A. Bennett C.F.

Biol. 2016; 1421: 243-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Exon 7 was very poorly recognized and included in minigene mRNA (Fig. 1C, lane 1), but its inclusion could be improved by mutating position +1 of the 3′ss of this exon (first exonic nucleotide) from uridine (non-consensus) to guanosine (consensus) (Fig. 1C, lane 2) (51.Sheth N. Roca X. Hastings M.L. Roeder T. Krainer A.R. Sachidanandam R. Comprehensive splice-site analysis using comparative genomics.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 3955-3967Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). As expected, the 5′ss mutation at position −2 in both exons 7 and 8 disrupted 1 base pair in both registers, causing reduction in exon inclusion (Fig. 1B, lane 2 versus lane 3 and lane 10 versus lane 11). Additionally, mutations that affect base pairing only in the asymmetric loop register caused a strong reduction of exon inclusion (Fig. 1C, lane 2 versus lanes 4 and 7 and lane 10 versus lanes 2 and 15). This observation suggests that these two 5′ss use the asymmetric loop register for U1 recognition. The effects brought by these mutations were only rescued by suppressor U1 snRNAs that restore base pairing in the noncanonical register (Fig. 1C, lanes 7–9 and 15–17). Altogether, these data show that the 5′ss of exons 7 and 8 base pair with U1 in the asymmetric loop 1 (+3/+4) register. Because of the biological significance of CD46 exon 13 in immunity and other cellular processes, from here on we focused on the splicing regulation of this exon. Serial deletions of exon 13 were introduced into the CD46 splicing minigene containing exons 12, 13, and 14 with shortened introns 12 and 13 to determine the importance of these sequences in splicing. The majority of splice products from the wild-type CD46 minigene include exon 13 (Fig. 2A, lane 1) upon HEK293T transfection. All 8-nucleotide exonic deletions in the A series affected the alternative splicing pattern of CD46 exon 13 to different extents (Fig. 2A, top left panel). Deletion of A2, A3, A4, or A7 sequences resulted in nearly complete skipping of exon 13. This result strongly suggests that these sequences contain an exonic splicing enhancer(s) (ESE(s)) that promotes inclusion of exon 13. In contrast, A5, A6, A8, A9, A10, and A11 likely contain an exonic splicing silencer(s) (ESS(s)) as exon 13 inclusion was largely increased when either of these sequences was removed. The staggered 8-nucleotide deletions of exon 13 or B series were then generated to further map the regions of ESEs and ESSs and to limit the false positives from the first deletion set that could arise from the creation of new sequence junctions (Fig. 2A, top right panel). These staggered deletions showed consistent splicing patterns compared with the first deletion set, strongly supporting the isolation of multiple ESEs and ESSs within exon 13. Likewise, eight 10-nucleotide deletions in the C and D series were introduced into introns 12 and 13 near exon 13, respectively. These deletions do not perturb the 3′ss, the predicted branch point sequence, and the 5′ss, thus leaving intact the last 32 nucleotides of intron 12 and the first 8 nucleotides of intron 13 (Fig. 2B). The majority of deletions in either intron did not trigger much change in exon 13 inclusion (Fig. 2A, lower panels). Nevertheless, a strong intronic splicing enhancer (ISE) was revealed in intron 13 immediately downstream of the 5′ss in exon 13 as its removal led to a strong reduction in exon inclusion (Fig. 2A, bottom right panel, lane 13 versus lanes 14 and 15). Overall, these results suggest that the sequences of introns 12 and 13 near exon 13 play a minor role in regulating exon 13 inclusion. Consistent results were seen across HEK293T, HeLa, and Jurkat cell lines (Fig. 2, C and D), suggesting that these cis-acting elements are similarly regulated in different"

In addition to its roles in tumor growth and progression, CK2 also promotes drug resistance to both conventional and targeted therapeutics. For example, pharmacological inhibition of CK2 kinase activity reverted multidrug resistance of a human T lymphoblastoid cell line (14Di Maira G. Brustolon F. Bertacchini J. Tosoni K. Marmiroli S. Pinna L.A. Ruzzene M.

In addition, siRNA-mediated knockdown of CK2 catalytic subunits enhanced chemosensitivity to gemcitabine in human pancreatic cancer cells (15Kreutzer J.N. Ruzzene M. Guerra B.

In cells depleted of CK2α, gemcitabine induced MKK4/JNK signaling, resulting in cell death (15Kreutzer J.N. Ruzzene M. Guerra B. Enhancing chemosensitivity to gemcitabine via RNA interference targeting the catalytic subunits of protein kinase CK2 in human pancreatic cancer cells.BMC Cancer. 2010; 10: 440Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CK2 displayed elevated protein expression and activity in chronic myeloid leukemia cells that are resistant to the small molecule kinase inhibitor imatinib (16Borgo C. Cesaro L.

Oncol. 2013; 7: 1103-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Either reduction of CK2α expression or pharmacological inhibition of CK2α kinase activity restored imatinib sensitivity, possibly through suppressing Akt activity (16Borgo C. Cesaro L. Salizzato V.

Inhibitors of BRAF and MEK, members of the RAF-MEK-ERK kinase cascade, have achieved remarkable overall response rates in advanced melanomas harboring BRAF Val-600 mutations, but a significant proportion of patients is intrinsically resistant to such therapies, and those who respond almost inevitably develop resistance over a matter of months (17Menzies A.M.

In a recent whole-kinome siRNA screen for kinases that could induce resistance to ERK kinase inhibitors in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells, we identified CK2α as a synthetic lethal partner of ERK inhibition (22Hayes T.K. Neel N.F. Hu C. Gautam P. Chenard M. Long B. Aziz M. Kassner M. Bryant K.L. Pierobon M. Marayati R. Kher S. George S.D. Xu M. Wang-Gillam A. Samatar A.A. Maitra A. Wennerberg K. Petricoin 3rd, E.F.

Long-term ERK inhibition in KRAS-mutant pancreatic cancer is associated with MYC degradation and senescence-like growth suppression.Cancer Cell. 2016; 29: 75-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We postulated that kinase inhibitor resistance mechanisms can be shared by diseases that show hyperactivity of the same pathway. Given that the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway is strongly activated in both pancreatic cancer and melanoma, we sought to determine whether CK2 also plays a role in resistance to inhibition of this pathway in melanoma. In the present study, we found that CK2α overexpression was sufficient to drive resistance to both BRAF and MEK inhibitors in BRAF mutant melanoma cells. Conversely, depletion of CK2α increased sensitivity to the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib. Consistent with these results, CK2α sustained ERK phosphorylation under conditions of pathway inhibition. Although we found that CK2 negatively regulated expression of the ERK-specific phosphatase dual specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6) in a kinase-dependent manner, the maintenance of ERK phosphorylation was not due to these decreased levels of DUSP6. Instead, we found that CK2α-mediated maintenance of ERK phosphorylation and drug resistance were kinase-independent. The ability of both wild-type and kinase-inactive CK2α to bind to the key RAF-MEK-ERK pathway scaffold protein kinase suppressor of Ras 1 (KSR1), which is required for optimal ERK phosphorylation and activation, supports a kinase-independent scaffolding role for CK2α in facilitating optimal ERK signaling under conditions of pathway inhibition. That CK2α overexpression did not cause resistance to a direct ERK inhibitor is further evidence that ERK inhibition may overcome resistance mechanisms that shorten the effectiveness of blocking upstream kinases in the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway. To examine the expression of CK2α in melanoma, we first surveyed the Cancer Genome Atlas skin cutaneous melanoma data set for CK2α mRNA expression through cBioPortal (40Gao J. Aksoy B.A. Dogrusoz U. Dresdner G. Gross B. Sumer S.O. Sun Y. Jacobsen A. Sinha R. Larsson E. Cerami E. Sander C. Schultz N. Integrative analysis of complex cancer genomics and clinical profiles using the cBioPortal.Sci. Signal. 2013; 6: pl1Crossref PubMed Scopus (8775) Google Scholar). We found that the CK2α transcript is up-regulated in a subset of those tumors (15% of 278 samples) and that 90% of that subset also harbor mutations in BRAF, NRAS, and/or NF1 that lead to hyperactivation of ERK. Next, we measured CK2α protein expression in a panel of neonatal human epidermal melanocytes, lightly pigmented, moderately pigmented, and darkly pigmented donors and melanoma cell lines (five BRAF mutants (A375, SK-MEL-28, A2058, RPMI-7951, and Malme-3) and one NRAS mutant (SBC12A)) (Fig. 1A). Melanoma cell lines had higher levels of CK2α protein expression compared with melanocytes (Fig. 1B; p = 0.013). In contrast, basal phosphorylated ERK (pERK) levels were quite variable among the lines and were not predicted either by malignancy state (p = 0.5384) or by CK2α levels (R2 = 0.06130) (Fig. 1A), consistent with our previous findings (see Fig. 1 in Shields et al. (23Shields J.M. Thomas N.E. Cregger M. Berger A.J. Leslie M. Torrice C. Hao H. Penland S. Arbiser J. Scott G. Zhou T. Bar-Eli M. Bear J.E. Der C.J. Kaufmann W.K. Rimm D.L. Sharpless N.E. Lack of extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling shows a new type of melanoma.Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 1502-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar)). We recently used a whole-kinome siRNA screen to search for mechanisms of resistance to ERK inhibition in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell, and found that CK2α was one of the hits identified (22Hayes T.K. Neel N.F. Hu C. Gautam P. Chenard M. Long B. Aziz M. Kassner M. Bryant K.L. Pierobon M. Marayati R. Kher S. George S.D. Xu M. Wang-Gillam A. Samatar A.A. Maitra A. Wennerberg K. Petricoin 3rd, E.F.

Long-term ERK inhibition in KRAS-mutant pancreatic cancer is associated with MYC degradation and senescence-like growth suppression.Cancer Cell. 2016; 29: 75-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). To test whether CK2α promotes resistance to approved single agent therapies targeting the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway in melanoma cells with hyperactivation of this pathway, we first stably expressed FLAG-tagged wild-type CK2α in A375 melanoma cells (Fig. 2A). These cells possess a homozygous BRAF(V600E) mutation and are sensitive to both BRAFi and MEKi. We then assessed sensitivity to growth inhibition by multiple inhibitors of the pathway, including mutant BRAF-selective inhibitors vemurafenib and dabrafenib and MEK1/2-selective inhibitor trametinib. Oncogenically activated (mutant) NRAS has been identified in patients with BRAF mutant melanomas as one mechanism of resistance to BRAF but not MEK inhibition (24Nazarian R. Shi H. Wang Q. Kong X. Koya R.C. Lee H. Chen Z. Lee M.K. Attar N. Sazegar H. Chodon T. Nelson S.F. McArthur G. Sosman J.A. Ribas A. Lo R.S. Melanomas acquire resistance to B-RAF(V600E) inhibition by RTK or N-RAS upregulation.Nature. 2010; 468: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar). Therefore, we stably expressed FLAG-tagged mutant NRAS(Q61K) (Fig. 2A) as a positive control. Expression of CK2α or NRAS(Q61K) led to an ∼1.62-fold increase in basal ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). But, as expected, mutant NRAS promoted resistance to both BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib and dabrafenib as evidenced by increased values for 50% growth inhibition (GI50) of 11.4- and 2.97-fold, respectively, compared with the GFP negative control (Fig. 2D). In contrast, mutant NRAS did not increase the GI50 (1.1-fold change) for the MEKi trametinib, consistent with findings that BRAF mutant melanomas with secondary NRAS mutations still remain sensitive to MEK inhibition (24Nazarian R. Shi H. Wang Q. Kong X. Koya R.C. Lee H. Chen Z. Lee M.K. Attar N. Sazegar H. Chodon T. Nelson S.F. McArthur G. Sosman J.A. Ribas A. Lo R.S. Melanomas acquire resistance to B-RAF(V600E) inhibition by RTK or N-RAS upregulation.Nature. 2010; 468: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar). Notably, expression of CK2α increased the GI50 for vemurafenib, dabrafenib, and trametinib by 4.13-, 3.52-, and 2.63-fold, respectively, indicating reduced sensitivity to all three inhibitors (Fig. 2C). A summary of all GI50 values are provided in a table in Fig. 2C, lower panel. Expression of CK2α also produced resistance to vemurafenib in another BRAF mutant melanoma cell line, SK-MEL-28 (data not shown). To further evaluate the effect of CK2α expression on responses to the above mentioned inhibitors, we performed clonogenic cell survival assays, which assess the ability of individual cells to form colonies, a property that differs between tumor cells and their normal counterparts and that is distinct from the proliferation of an overall cell population as measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Consistent with the increased GI50 values, CK2α enhanced the clonogenic survival of A375 cells as measured by percent colony numbers in the presence of each inhibitor compared with DMSO vehicle control (Fig. 2D). In contrast to CK2α, NRAS(Q61K) significantly enhanced clonogenic survival only in response to vemurafenib. The modest enhancement in clonogenic survival in response to dabrafenib did not reach statistical significance. Together, these results indicate that CK2α overexpression but not NRAS mutation is sufficient to induce resistance to both BRAF and MEK inhibition, which implies a CK2α-mediated resistance mechanism distinct from that mediated by mutant NRAS. Given that CK2α overexpression was sufficient to drive resistance, we asked whether, conversely, depletion of CK2α would enhance sensitivity to pathway inhibition. We used a set of five shRNAs (1–5) to knock down CK2α in A375 cells. Consistent with the mild increase in basal ERK phosphorylation when CK2α was overexpressed (Fig. 2B), we found that ERK phosphorylation was mildly impaired upon CK2α knockdown (data not shown). Complete knockdown of CK2α was incompatible with cell survival (data not shown). Therefore, to obtain cells for subsequent experimentation, we utilized shRNAs 4 and 5, which yielded ∼60% knockdown and sufficient viability (Fig. 3A). Even this incomplete depletion of CK2α expression resulted in decreased GI50 for vemurafenib (55 and 65% decrease for shRNAs 4 and 5, respectively; Fig. 3B). This result indicates that CK2α is necessary for resistance to BRAF inhibition. Previous studies have identified multiple mechanisms of resistance to BRAF inhibition, the majority of which are characterized by ERK reactivation (25Solit D.B. Rosen N. Towards a unified model of RAF inhibitor resistance.Cancer Discov. 2014; 4: 27-30Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given that CK2α and mutant NRAS both promote BRAFi resistance, we hypothesized that they are both capable of facilitating ERK reactivation following inhibition of BRAF and/or MEK. As anticipated, mutant NRAS induced strong ERK reactivation upon inhibition of BRAF with either vemurafenib or dabrafenib (Fig. 4, A and B). CK2α also facilitated ERK rebound although not as strongly as NRAS(Q61K). Consistent with their trametinib resistance profiles, NRAS(Q61K) failed to reactivate ERK in the presence of trametinib, whereas CK2α did sustain ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 4C). The maintenance of ERK phosphorylation by CK2α suggested either maintained upstream activation or suppressed deactivation mechanisms. MEK is the only known direct activator of ERK (26Crews C.M. Alessandrini A. Erikson R.L. The primary structure of MEK, a protein kinase that phosphorylates the ERK gene product.Science. 1992; 258: 478-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of MEK at Ser-217 and Ser-221 is indicative of MEK activation. DUSP6/mitogen-activated kinase kinase phosphatase 3 is a key ERK-specific phosphatase that reverses MEK phosphorylation at the TEY motif of ERK (27Muda M. Boschert U. Dickinson R. Martinou J.C. Martinou I. Camps M. Schlegel W. Arkinstall S. MKP-3, a novel cytosolic protein-tyrosine phosphatase that exemplifies a new class of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4319-4326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Therefore, we assessed the status of both MEK activation and DUSP6 expression by Western blotting. We found that MEK phosphorylation did not change in parallel with ERK phosphorylation, indicating that it is not the basis for maintained ERK activity (Fig. 4C). Intriguingly, DUSP6 expression was also strongly reduced in CK2α-overexpressing cells even without inhibitor treatment (Fig. 4C). Based on this finding, we initially hypothesized that down-regulation of DUSP6 contributed to the sustained ERK phosphorylation. However, we first needed to confirm whether CK2α truly regulates DUSP6 expression. CK2α has been reported to directly phosphorylate DUSP6 at multiple sites in vitro, the consequences of which are largely unknown (28Castelli M. Camps M. Gillieron C. Leroy D. Arkinstall S. Rommel C. Nichols A. MAP kinase phosphatase 3 (MKP3) interacts with and is phosphorylated by protein kinase CK2α.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44731-44739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To control for CK2α kinase activity, we generated a kinase-inactive mutant of CK2α (29Ji H. Wang J. Nika H. Hawke D. Keezer S. Ge Q. Fang B. Fang X. Fang D. Litchfield D.W. Aldape K. Lu Z. EGF-induced ERK activation promotes CK2-mediated disassociation of α-catenin from β-catenin and transactivation of β-catenin.Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 547-559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and measured DUSP6 protein levels upon ectopic expression of either kinase-inactive (K68M) or wild-type (WT) CK2α. As expected, CK2α(WT) was constitutively active, and cells overexpressing this form of CK2α exhibited elevated basal phosphorylation of EEF1D (Fig. 5A), a validated marker of CK2 activity (30Gyenis L. Duncan J.S. Turowec J.P. Bretner M. Litchfield D.W. Unbiased functional proteomics strategy for protein kinase inhibitor validation and identification of bona fide protein kinase substrates: application to identification of EEF1D as a substrate for CK2.J. Proteome Res. 2011; 10: 4887-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In contrast, cells expressing kinase-inactive CK2α(K68M) exhibited mildly reduced levels of EEF1D phosphorylation (Fig. 5A), suggesting a weak dominant-negative effect. Interestingly, CK2α(WT) drastically reduced DUSP6 abundance, whereas K68M did not have an effect (Fig. 5B), indicating that the decrease in DUSP6 protein is likely due to CK2α-mediated phosphorylation. Conversely, shRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous CK2α enhanced DUSP6 protein levels (Fig. 5C). To determine whether the reduction in DUSP6 was the result of accelerated degradation or suppressed transcription, we first used MG132 to block proteasome-mediated protein degradation. Six hours after MG132 treatment, DUSP6 abundance was fully rescued (Fig. 5D). We also examined DUSP6 mRNA levels by quantitative PCR and found that they did not change upon CK2α expression (Fig. 5E). These results indicate that CK2α kinase activity regulates DUSP6 abundance by facilitating its proteasomal degradation. Given that CK2α kinase activity was essential to the decrease in DUSP6 expression (Fig. 5B), we hypothesized that kinase-inactive CK2α would not be able to maintain ERK phosphorylation when the pathway was inhibited. Unexpectedly, in the presence of both BRAFis, ERK phosphorylation was sustained to a similar degree in the presence of either CK2α(K68M) or CK2α(WT) (Fig. 6A), suggesting a kinase-independent contribution of CK2α to pERK. However, in the presence of MEKi, CK2α(K68M) exhibited a lower level of pERK compared with CK2α(WT). This potentially indicates a differential contribution of the kinase activity of CK2α to maintaining pERK, depending on which node of the pathway is inhibited (Fig. 6A). We therefore anticipated that kinase-inactive CK2α would also promote resistance in a similar fashion. Consistent with this, we found that CK2α(K68M) promoted resistance to vemurafenib, dabrafenib, and trametinib to the same extent as CK2α wild type as indicated by their respective GI50 values (Fig. 6B), indicating that CK2α-mediated BRAFi and MEKi resistance does not depend on its catalytic kinase activity. Instead, our findings indicate that the ability of CK2α to maintain ERK phosphorylation when the pathway is inhibited and to promote resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors is more likely due to a protein binding or scaffolding function of CK2α. Clearly, CK2α(K68M), although catalytically inactive and incapable of degrading DUSP6, maintained ERK phosphorylation and inhibitor resistance. Therefore, DUSP6 regulation by CK2α does not contribute to CK2α-mediated resistance and maintenance of pERK or cell viability upon inhibitor treatment. Our previous work (31Ritt D.A. Zhou M. Conrads T.P. Veenstra T.D. Copeland T.D. Morrison D.K. CK2 is a component of the KSR1 scaffold complex that contributes to Raf kinase activation.Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 179-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) uncovered an essential role of CK2α in maximally facilitating RAF-MEK-ERK pathway activation through its direct binding to KSR1 within the KSR1 scaffolding complex that also includes RAF, MEK, and ERK. CK2α association with KSR enhances RAF phosphorylation of MEK. Given our finding here that kinase-inactive CK2α maintains ERK phosphorylation and resistance to pathway inhibitors to the same extent as its wild-type counterpart, we speculated that it too retains binding to KSR1. Accordingly, when we immunoprecipitated endogenous KSR1 from A375 cells, we detected considerable levels of ectopically expressed CK2α(WT) and CK2α(K68M) but not the GFP control (Fig. 7). This result supports our hypothesis that CK2α binding to KSR1 is kinase-independent, offering a potential mechanism by which both CK2α(WT) and CK2α(K68M) maintain ERK phosphorylation and resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors. Specifically, our findings are consistent with a model whereby CK2α binding enhances the efficiency of KSR1 scaffolding to facilitate ERK activation. Testing of this model would require identification of the KSR1 binding site on CK2α, which is currently unknown, to enable assessment of whether a KSR1 binding-deficient mutant of CK2α is now impaired in conferring resistance to BRAFi and/or MEKi. Our model predicts that CK2α should not be able to cause resistance in melanoma cells to a"
https://openalex.org/W2502719767,"Insulin resistance is a major aspect of type 2 diabetes (T2D), which results from impaired insulin signaling in target cells. Signaling to regulate forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) may be the most important mechanism for insulin to control transcription. Despite this, little is known about how insulin regulates FOXO1 and how FOXO1 may contribute to insulin resistance in adipocytes, which are the most critical cell type in the development of insulin resistance. We report a detailed mechanistic analysis of insulin control of FOXO1 in human adipocytes obtained from non-diabetic subjects and from patients with T2D. We show that FOXO1 is mainly phosphorylated through mTORC2-mediated phosphorylation of protein kinase B at Ser473 and that this mechanism is unperturbed in T2D. We also demonstrate a cross-talk from the MAPK branch of insulin signaling to stimulate phosphorylation of FOXO1. The cellular abundance and consequently activity of FOXO1 are halved in T2D. Interestingly, inhibition of mTORC1 with rapamycin reduces the abundance of FOXO1 to the levels in T2D. This suggests that the reduction of the concentration of FOXO1 is a consequence of attenuation of mTORC1, which defines much of the diabetic state in human adipocytes. We integrate insulin control of FOXO1 in a network-wide mathematical model of insulin signaling dynamics based on compatible data from human adipocytes. The diabetic state is network-wide explained by attenuation of an mTORC1-to-insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1) feedback and reduced abundances of insulin receptor, GLUT4, AS160, ribosomal protein S6, and FOXO1.

Insulin has a crucial function to maintain energy homeostasis at the whole-body level and at the cellular level in a variable environment of nutrient supply. Failure to sustain this function is at the center of diabetes.

Because of the central role of insulin in energy homeostasis, effects of insulin are pleiotropic, affecting almost every aspect of cellular metabolism, which is reflected in a highly branched signaling network in target cells of the hormone. T2D is also closely related to obesity (1Chen L. Magliano D.J. Zimmet P.Z. The worldwide epidemiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus—present and future perspectives.Nat. Rev. Endocrinol. 2012; 8: 228-236Crossref Scopus (1454) Google Scholar), and the insulin resistance first develops in the adipocytes of an expanding adipose tissue. Failure to store fat in the adipose tissue then leads to ectopic fat deposition in other organs, such as liver and muscle, which is believed to spread the insulin resistance to those organs (2Samuel V.T. Shulman G.I. The pathogenesis of insulin resistance: integrating signaling pathways and substrate flux.J. Clin. Investig. 2016; 126: 12-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Eventually the insulin-producing β-cells often fail to compensate for the insulin resistance, and T2D can be diagnosed. It is therefore of primary importance to understand the disease mechanisms in human adipocytes to be able to treat the disease at an early stage before other organs are affected. type 2 diabetes forkhead box protein O insulin receptor insulin receptor substrate-1 insulin-regulated glucose transporter mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin in complex with raptor mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin in complex with rictor protein kinase B p70 ribosomal S6 kinase ribosomal protein S6 body mass index half-maximal effective concentration. Forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) may be the most important mediator of the control of transcription by insulin. FOXO1 is particularly important in regulating the levels of key rate-controlling enzymes in cellular metabolism (for reviews, see Refs. 3Kousteni S.

FOXO1 has also been reported to control insulin receptor (IR) transcription (6Puig O. Tjian R. Transcriptional feedback control of insulin receptor by dFOXO/FOXO1.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2435-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) and is likely involved in transcriptional control of other signaling mediators of insulin. The perturbation of such transcriptional feedbacks may be involved in establishment of the long term effects of insulin resistance. In particular, FOXO1 suppresses expression and activity of both peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α and could thereby inhibit adipogenesis in mice (7Dowell P.

FOXO1 is part of a subfamily that has four highly homologous members, FOXO1, FOXO3, FOXO4, and FOXO6. FOXO1, FOXO3, and FOXO4 are similarly regulated (for a review, see Ref. 16Eijkelenboom A. Burgering B.M. FOXOs: signalling integrators for homeostasis maintenance.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2013; 14: 83-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Genetically manipulated mouse models indicate that FOXO1, FOXO3, and FOXO4 are redundant in many aspects, although FOXO-specific knock-out mice display specific developmental abnormalities. FOXO1 is the most abundant of the FOXOs in metabolically important tissues, such as in adipose tissue, liver, skeletal muscle, skeleton, β-cells, and hypothalamus. FOXO1 is potentially subject to regulation through control of its expression, different post-translational modifications, binding to chaperone proteins, and degradation. A fundamental control mechanism exerted by insulin is the reversible phosphorylation of three phosphorylation sites, Thr24, Ser256, and Ser319 (human sequence). Phosphorylation at these sites by protein kinase B (PKB) inhibits transcriptional control by FOXO1 by inducing the rapid exclusion of the protein from the nucleus (for reviews, see Refs. 17Brunet A.

Reversible acetylation of FOXO1 modulates its activity, although whether acetylation results in enhanced or reduced transcriptional activity may depend on the target gene (20van der Horst A.

There are, however, two fundamental hurdles that have prevented us from understanding the role of FOXO1 in the development of insulin resistance and T2D. First, the function of FOXO1 in human adipocytes has been underinvestigated, and little is known about how FOXO1 contributes to the diabetic state. Second, nothing is known about the function of FOXO1 on a systems level, which is where it is connected with the mechanisms of insulin resistance. To understand the role of FOXO1 at the systems level, it is necessary to collect internally consistent experimental data for insulin signaling to control FOXO1 as well as of the different branches of the insulin-signaling network. Together with specific perturbations of the signaling and mathematical modeling, such data can provide a systems level understanding of insulin signaling. When further combined with compatible data from cells of patients with T2D, the systems analysis can also pinpoint mechanisms of insulin resistance in diabetes. We have previously developed a mathematical model of insulin signaling based on internally consistent dynamic data obtained from isolated human adipocytes that describes insulin signaling control of glucose uptake, protein synthesis, and autophagy and transcriptional control via MAPK-Elk1, normally and in diabetes (23Danielsson A. Ost A. Nystrom F.H. Strålfors P. Attenuation of insulin-stimulated insulin receptor substrate-1 serine 307 phosphorylation in insulin resistance of type 2 diabetes.J. Biol.

Importantly, the model has established a single mechanism that can explain the insulin resistance throughout the examined branches of the signaling network. This model forms a basis for an expandable mathematical model of the dynamics of the insulin-signaling network. However, the model has lacked the FOXO1 branch of insulin signaling. Herein we report an in-depth analysis of insulin control of FOXO1 in mature human adipocytes, normally and in T2D, and integrate this control into a systems-wide comprehensive mathematical model of insulin signaling. In particular, our analysis demonstrates the mechanistic origin and spreading of insulin resistance of T2D throughout the signaling network and the role of FOXO1 in this condition. To understand the role of FOXO1 in human adipocytes, normally and in T2D, we first examined the abundance and phosphorylation of FOXO1. The abundance of FOXO1 protein in adipocytes from patients with T2D was reduced to 55% of the concentration in cells from non-diabetic subjects (Fig. 1B and Table 1).TABLE 1Summary of the abundances and insulin responses of the different intermediaries in the insulin-signaling network, normally and in T2DSensitivity EC50Response time t½Steady-state levelTotal abundance of corresponding protein in T2DRefs.contrT2DcontrT2DcontrT2Dnm insulinmin-fold over basal contr% of contrIR-Tyr(P)1.01.01.0ND4.31.55525Brännmark C.

In Table 1, this number can be compared with the corresponding numbers for the other examined signal mediators. The response time was similar in cells from patients with T2D (Fig. 2A, red), but the level of phosphorylation was lower due to the reduced abundance of FOXO1. When corrected for the amount of FOXO1, the phosphorylation was similar in cells from patients with T2D and in normal non-diabetic cells (Fig. 2B, red dashed line). However, the total abundance of non-phosphorylated (i.e. active) FOXO1 is reduced in T2D. The response to different concentrations of insulin demonstrated an EC50 for phosphorylation of FOXO1-Ser256 at about 0.02 nm insulin (Fig. 2C and Table 1). There was no difference in EC50 for insulin in adipocytes from patients with T2D compared with cells from non-diabetic subjects (Fig. 2C). It can be noted that the abundance of FOXO1 was not affected by its phosphorylation in response to insulin over 60 min (Fig. 2A) or in response to different concentrations of insulin (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the ability of insulin to control FOXO1 is not affected in the diabetic state. This can readily be explained by the dependence of FOXO1 phosphorylation on phosphorylation of PKB at Ser473 as shown next. However, due to the reduced abundance, the cellular functions of FOXO1 are likely affected in diabetes. The phosphorylation of FOXO1 by PKB in response to insulin has been found to depend on phosphorylation of PKB at Ser473, which is catalyzed by mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) in complex with rictor (mTORC2) (Fig. 3), and to be largely independent of phosphorylation of PKB at Thr308, which is catalyzed by phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 downstream of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1) (Fig. 3). We wanted to examine whether this concept operates in human adipocytes. We have previously shown that the phosphorylation of PKB at Ser473 in response to insulin is not affected by rapamycin (25Brännmark C. Nyman E. Fagerholm S. Bergenholm L. Ekstrand E.-M. Cedersund G.

Rapamycin also had no effect on the phosphorylation of FOXO1 in response to insulin (Fig. 4A), whereas torin-1, which inhibits both mTORC1 and mTORC2, inhibited the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of both PKB-Ser473 (Fig. 4B) and FOXO1 (Fig. 4C). Hence, the situation in human adipocytes is compatible with FOXO1 being exclusively under the control of PKB phosphorylation at Ser473 as is the case in other cell types (27Jacinto E. Facchinetti V.

We examined acetylation of FOXO1 at Lys262,265,274 (human sequence). The acetylation appeared to be slightly reduced in adipocytes from patients with T2D compared with cells from non-diabetic subjects (Fig. 5). However, the extent of acetylation varied a lot between individuals, and the reduction was not statistically significant. This indicates that T2D does not involve any major changes in the acetylation of FOXO1 at Lys262,265,274, which is compatible with the intact response to insulin in the diabetic state. Likewise, changes in the state of methylation of FOXO1 probably do not contribute to the diabetic state as methylation of FOXO1 at Arg251 and Arg253 in the PKB recognition motif for phosphorylation of FOXO1 has been shown to inhibit subsequent phosphorylation at Ser256 (30Yamagata K.

Using FRET, we tested the hypothesis that S100A1 directly competes with calmodulin (CaM) for binding to intact, functional ryanodine receptors type I (RyR1) and II (RyR2) from skeletal and cardiac muscle, respectively. Our FRET readout provides an index of acceptor-labeled CaM binding near donor-labeled FKBP (FK506-binding protein 12.6) on the cytoplasmic domain of RyR in isolated sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles. S100A1 (0.01–400 μm) partially inhibited FRET (i.e. CaM binding), with Ki > 10 μm, for both RyR1 and RyR2. The high [S100A1] required for partial effects on FRET indicates a lack of competition by S100A1 on CaM/RyR binding under normal physiological conditions. High-resolution analysis of time-resolved FRET detects two structural states of RyR-bound CaM, which respond to [Ca2+] and are isoform-specific. The distribution of these structural states was perturbed only by high micromolar [S100A1], which promoted a shift of bound CaM to a lower FRET orientation (without altering the amount of CaM bound to RyR). Thus, high micromolar S100A1 does alter the CaM/RyR interaction, without involving competition. Nevertheless, submicromolar S100A1 can alter RyR function, an effect that is influenced by both [Ca2+] and [CaM]. We conclude that CaM and S100A1 can concurrently bind to and functionally modulate RyR1 and RyR2, but this does not involve direct competition at the RyR CaM binding site.

https://openalex.org/W2404394227,"Tumor development driven by inflammation is now an established phenomenon, but the role that complement plays remains uncertain. Recent evidence has suggested that various components of the complement (C) cascade may influence tumor development in disparate ways; however, little attention has been paid to that of the membrane attack complex (MAC). This is despite abundant evidence documenting the effects of this complex on cell behavior, including cell activation, protection from/induction of apoptosis, release of inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and ECM components and regulators, and the triggering of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Here we present a novel approach to this issue by using global gene expression studies in conjunction with a systems biology analysis. Using network analysis of MAC-responsive expression changes, we demonstrate a cluster of co-regulated genes known to have impact in the extracellular space and on the supporting stroma and with well characterized tumor-promoting roles. Network analysis highlighted the central role for EGF receptor activation in mediating the observed responses to MAC exposure. Overall, the study sheds light on the mechanisms by which sublytic MAC causes tumor cell responses and exposes a gene expression signature that implicates MAC as a driver of tumor progression. These findings have implications for understanding of the roles of complement and the MAC in tumor development and progression, which in turn will inform future therapeutic strategies in cancer."

Our previous studies have shown that the viral nonstructural protein NSs forms inclusion bodies (IBs) that are involved in viral immune evasion, as well as viral RNA replication. In this study, we sought to elucidate the mechanism by which NSs formed the IBs, a lipid droplet-based structure confirmed by NSs co-localization with perilipin A and adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP). Through a high throughput screening, we identified synaptogyrin-2 to be highly up-regulated in response to SFTS bunyavirus (SFTSV) infection and to be a promoter of viral replication. We demonstrated that synaptogyrin-2 interacted with NSs and was translocated into the IBs, which were reconstructed from lipid droplets into large structures in infection. Viral RNA replication decreased, and infectious virus titers were lowered significantly when synaptogyrin-2 was silenced in specific shRNA-expressing cells, which correlated with the reduced number of the large IBs restructured from regular lipid droplets. We hypothesize that synaptogyrin-2 is essential to promoting the formation of the IBs to become virus factories for viral RNA replication through its interaction with NSs.

Here, we cloned, expressed, and characterized Rab5a and Rab5b from Leishmania and found that both of them are localized in the early endosome. To understand the role of LdRab5 isoforms in different modes of endocytosis in Leishmania, we generated transgenic parasites overexpressing LdRab5a, LdRab5b, or their dominant-positive (LdRab5a:Q93L and LdRab5b:Q80L) or dominant-negative mutants (LdRab5a:N146I and LdRab5b:N133I). Using LdRab5a or its mutants overexpressing parasites, we found that LdRab5a specifically regulates the fluid-phase endocytosis of horseradish peroxidase and also specifically induced the transport of dextran-Texas Red to the lysosomes. In contrast, cells overexpressing LdRab5b or its mutants showed that LdRab5b explicitly controls receptor-mediated endocytosis of hemoglobin, and overexpression of LdRab5b:WT enhanced the transport of internalized Hb to the lysosomes in comparison with control cells. To unequivocally demonstrate the role of Rab5 isoforms in endocytosis in Leishmania, we tried to generate null-mutants of LdRab5a and LdRab5b parasites, but both were lethal indicating their essential functions in parasites. Therefore, we used heterozygous LdRab5a+/− and LdRab5b+/− cells. LdRab5a+/− Leishmania showed 50% inhibition of HRP uptake, but hemoglobin endocytosis was uninterrupted. In contrast, about 50% inhibition of Hb endocytosis was observed in LdRab5b+/− cells without any significant effect on HRP uptake. Finally, we tried to identify putative LdRab5a and LdRab5b effectors. We found that LdRab5b interacts with clathrin heavy chain and hemoglobin receptor. However, LdRab5a failed to interact with the clathrin heavy chain, and interaction with hemoglobin receptor was significantly less.

PcrV is an essential part of the P. aeruginosa type III secretion system (T3SS), and its oligomeric nature allows for multiple complex binding and blocking options. The library screening yielded a large number of promising biparatopic lead candidates, revealing significant (and non-trivial) preferences in terms of Nanobody building block and epitope bin combinations and orientations. Excellent potencies were confirmed upon further characterization in two different P. aeruginosa T3SS-mediated cytotoxicity assays. Three biparatopic Nanobodies were evaluated in a lethal mouse P. aeruginosa challenge pneumonia model, conferring 100% survival upon prophylactic administration and reducing lung P. aeruginosa burden by up to 2 logs. At very low doses, they protected the mice from P. aeruginosa infection-related changes in lung histology, myeloperoxidase production, and lung weight.

Nanobodies are a novel class of therapeutic proteins based on immunoglobulin single variable domains (Nanobody® is a trademark of Ablynx N.V.) (1.Kolkman J.A. Law D.A. Nanobodies: from llamas to therapeutic proteins.Drug Discov. Today Technol. 2010; 7: e139-e146Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The immunoglobulin single variable domains may be derived from the variable domains of heavy chain-only antibodies that naturally occur in camelids (2.Muyldermans S. Nanobodies: natural single-domain antibodies.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2013; 82: 775-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). Compared with heterotetrameric conventional antibodies, heavy chain-only antibodies are homodimeric heavy chains lacking the CH1 domain. Many reports detail the superior solubility, monomeric behavior, and biophysical stability of Nanobodies compared with fragments derived from conventional antibodies (2.Muyldermans S. Nanobodies: natural single-domain antibodies.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2013; 82: 775-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). One of the most compelling yet often overlooked features of Nanobodies is that they are easily amenable to formatting (i.e. the genetic fusion of multiple (different) monovalent Nanobody building blocks by means of linker sequences into one multivalent polypeptide chain). Formatting represents an elegant way to improve potencies by avidity and concomitant blockage of multiple epitopes without the need for cumbersome affinity maturation. For homomultimeric targets, the combination of multiple identical (or different competing) Nanobody building blocks, appropriately spaced by linkers and each targeting a single protomer, may result in increased potencies driven by the avid binding of the multivalent Nanobody, compared with its monovalent counterparts (3.Coppieters K.

It is activated upon sensing the presence of host cells and can mediate cell death by means of two distinct mechanisms. The best studied mechanism is through the secretion and translocation of exotoxins into the host cell cytoplasm. Four different P. aeruginosa exotoxins are described (ExoS, ExoY, ExoT, and ExoU), which act in different ways on the host cell to ultimately cause cell death. Different P. aeruginosa strains secrete different combinations of exotoxins, with strains expressing ExoU exhibiting the greatest virulence (13.Hauser A.R. The type III secretion system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa: infection by injection.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7: 654-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Alternatively, in an exotoxin-independent way, the T3SS can mediate macrophage and neutrophil cytotoxicity, resulting in lung injury and inflammatory responses, a process called oncosis (14.Dacheux D. Toussaint B. Richard M. Brochier G. Croize J. Attree I.

Here we describe the identification of large numbers of highly potent PcrV Nanobodies by high throughput formatting for potency improvement. A large biparatopic/bivalent Nanobody library covering four different epitope bins was explored to identify the most potent/efficacious combinations functionally blocking the oligomeric PcrV ring of the P. aeruginosa T3SS needle. Many different avid binding options can be envisaged on the oligomeric target; however, we found that (i) combinations of members of different epitope bins were preferred over combinations of the same epitope bin, (ii) combinations of the most potent monovalent building blocks did not necessarily yield superior biparatopic Nanobodies, and (iii) weakly potent monovalent building blocks made excellent partners in biparatopic constructs. Several of these biparatopic Nanobodies showed encouraging therapeutic potential in an acute and lethal P. aeruginosa-induced mouse pneumonia model. Llamas were immunized essentially as described (10.Maussang D. Mujić-Delić A. Descamps F.J. Stortelers C. Vanlandschoot P. Stigter-van Walsum M. Vischer H.F. van Roy M. Vosjan M.

Nanobody-encoding cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR and ligated into a phagemid vector to generate Nanobody phage libraries (size ∼107) where the phage particles display Nanobodies with C-terminal FLAG3 and HIS6 tags fused to pIII, as described previously (33.Roovers R.C. Laeremans T. Huang L. De Taeye S. Verkleij A.J. Revets H. de Haard H.J. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M.P. Efficient inhibition of EGFR signaling and of tumour growth by antagonistic anti-EFGR nanobodies.Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 2007; 56: 303-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Phage display selections were performed against immobilized rPcrV protein (10 or 15 μg/ml) or in solution against different concentrations of biotinylated rPcrV (50 to 0.005 nm). After 2–3 rounds of selection, the resulting phage outputs were transfected into Escherichia coli strain TG1, and individual colonies were grown in 96-deep-well plates. The expression of monoclonal Nanobodies was induced by isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The periplasmic extracts containing the Nanobodies were prepared by freeze-thawing the bacterial pellets in PBS and subsequent centrifugation to remove cell debris. Productions and purifications of monovalent, bivalent, and biparatopic Nanobodies were performed essentially as described elsewhere (10.Maussang D. Mujić-Delić A. Descamps F.J. Stortelers C.

The flexible Gly-Ser linkers used to combine the monovalent building blocks in the bivalent and biparatopic constructs are referred to as 40GS ((GGGGS)8). A P. aeruginosa exotoxin-dependent cytotoxicity assay targeting P3-X63-Ag8 mouse myeloma cells (P3X63) was set up essentially as described before (30.Baer M. Sawa T. Flynn P. Luehrsen K. Martinez D. Wiener-Kronish J.P. Yarranton G. Bebbington C. An engineered human antibody fab fragment specific for Pseudomonas aeruginosa PcrV antigen has potent antibacterial activity.Infect. Immun. 2009; 77: 1083-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). 2 × 105 P3X63 cells/well were seeded in 96-well plates. Diluted periplasmic extracts containing Nanobodies or dilution series of purified Nanobodies were preincubated with P. aeruginosa strain PA103 (expressing both ExoU and ExoT exotoxins), grown in LB medium supplemented with 5 mm EGTA (34.Kim J. Ahn K. Min S. Jia J. Ha U. Wu D. Jin S. Factors triggering type III secretion in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Microbiology. 2005; 151: 3575-3587Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Next, the mixtures of Nanobodies and bacteria were added to the P3X63 cells at an average multiplicity of infection of 8 bacteria to 1 myeloma cell (range 6:1 to 10:1). After an incubation step of 3 h at 37 °C, P3X63 cells were stained with propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) and fixated with 2% formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich). P. aeruginosa-mediated cell death was quantified through the uptake of the propidium iodide by dead cells using a FACS Array (BD Biosciences) and FCS Express (De Novo Software, Glendale, CA). Values were normalized to calculate the percentage inhibition of cell death according to the formula, 100 × (Y − X)/(Y − Z), where X represents the percentage of dead cells of the evaluated data point, Y is the average percentage of dead cells of the PA103-treated wells incubated with irrelevant control Nanobody, and Z is the average percentage of dead cells of the untreated wells, incubated with irrelevant control Nanobody. Similarly, 8 × 104 A549 (ATCC CCL-185) cells/well were added to a 96-well E-plate (Acea Biosciences 05232368001) and placed in the xCELLigence RTCA W380 (Acea Biosciences) for 6–8 h at 37 °C. P. aeruginosa strain PA103, grown as described above, was preincubated for 1 h at 37 °C with dilution series of purified anti-PcrV Nanobodies and then added to the A549 cells at an average multiplicity of infection of 8 (range 6:1 to 10:1) and incubated for another 24 h at 37 °C. Data were analyzed at the time points where the reduction in cell index of the treated wells was between 75 and 90% of the cell index window. Data were normalized to the time point of inoculum addition. The genes encoding the full-length PcrV protein of P. aeruginosa reference strain PAO1 (amino acid residues 1–294) and seven PcrV/LcrV chimeric molecules were cloned into a pUC119-derived expression vector in frame with a C-terminal His6 tag. After transformation in E. coli (TG-1), expression cultures were grown, induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and allowed to continue for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells pellets were lysed by sonication, and cytosolic fractions were isolated by centrifugation. The recombinant proteins were purified from the crude extracts via immobilized metal affinity chromatography on HisTrap FF crude columns and buffer-exchanged using HiPrep 26/10 columns into Dulbecco's PBS, followed by ion exchange on a Source15Q column and finally gel filtration over a Superdex75 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare). The purity and homogeneity of the expressed protein were confirmed by SDS-PAGE and analytical size exclusion chromatography. The homology model of PcrV was generated with Discovery Studio 3.0 (Accelrys Software Inc.). The sequence of PcrV was taken from Uniprot (ID O30527), and the structure of Yersinia pestis V-antigen was used as a structural template (Protein Data Bank entry 1R6F) (35.Derewenda U. Mateja A. Devedjiev Y. Routzahn K.M. Evdokimov A.G. Derewenda Z.S. Waugh D.S. The structure of Yersinia pestis V-antigen, an essential virulence factor and mediator of immunity against plague.Structure. 2004; 12: 301-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence identity between the two proteins is 36%. The amino acid sequence of PcrV was aligned to the sequence of the structural template using BLOSUM62 matrix and further manually modified in order not to break secondary structural elements. 20 different models were generated using the standard “Build homology model” tool of Discovery Studio. The best model was chosen based on total energy value, visual inspection, and the Verify Protein MODELER tool and further minimized with 1000 steps of steepest descent with a root mean square gradient tolerance of 3, followed by conjugate gradient minimization. Protein stereochemistry evaluation was performed by several tools (Ramachandran plot, bumps monitor Verify Protein Profiles-3D tool) implemented in Discovery Studio. The model of the P. aeruginosa T3SS needle tip was generated starting from a PcrV homology model, the crystal structure of the truncated C terminus of the Shigella flexneri needle subunit (Protein Data Bank entry 2CA5), and the 16 Å electron microscopy density map of the complete model assembly (Protein Data Bank entry 2V6L) for LcrV protein assembly in the formation of the Yersinia needle tip (36.Deane J.E.

Superimposition was carried out with Molsoft ICM (Molsoft LLC), considering the backbone atoms of the C-terminal helix residues Lys258–Asp289 of the PcrV model and the residues from Gln45 to Asp75 of the S. flexneri needle subunit molecule. Seven different chimeric proteins were designed by replacing solvent-exposed portions of PcrV in the context of the pentameric model with corresponding counterparts of LcrV as follows: Chimera 1 (residues 1–26 of PcrV replaced by residues 1–47 of LcrV), Chimera 2 (57–91 replaced by 86–112), Chimera 3 (106–125 replaced by 127–147), Chimera 4 (156–177 replaced by 178–199), Chimera 5 (178–195 replaced by 200–216), Chimera 6 (194–211 replaced by 215–240), and Chimera 7 (209–249 by 238–278). Particular attention was paid to secondary structure elements to avoid disturbance of the protein structure integrity.

Podocyte injury, manifesting as proteinuria, is the cause of many glomerular diseases. We reported previously that calcium-independent phospholipase A2γ (iPLA2γ) is cytoprotective against complement-mediated glomerular epithelial cell injury. Studies in iPLA2γ KO mice have demonstrated an important role for iPLA2γ in mitochondrial lipid turnover, membrane structure, and metabolism. The aim of the present study was to employ iPLA2γ KO mice to better understand the role of iPLA2γ in normal glomerular and podocyte function as well as in glomerular injury. We show that deletion of iPLA2γ did not cause detectable albuminuria; however, it resulted in mitochondrial structural abnormalities and enhanced autophagy in podocytes as well as loss of podocytes in aging KO mice. Moreover, after induction of anti-glomerular basement membrane nephritis in young mice, iPLA2γ KO mice exhibited significantly increased levels of albuminuria, podocyte injury, and loss of podocytes compared with wild type. Thus, iPLA2γ has a protective functional role in the normal glomerulus and in glomerulonephritis. Understanding the role of iPLA2γ in glomerular pathophysiology provides opportunities for the development of novel therapeutic approaches to glomerular injury and proteinuria.

https://openalex.org/W2380328354,"Cytoplasmic protein aggregates are one of the pathological hallmarks of neurodegenerative disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Several RNA-binding proteins have been identified as components of inclusion bodies. Developmentally regulated RNA-binding protein 1 (Drb1)/RNA-binding motif protein 45 is an RNA-binding protein that was recently described as a component in ALS- and FTLD-related inclusion bodies. However, the molecular mechanism underlying cytoplasmic Drb1 aggregation remains unclear. Here, using an in vitro cellular model, we demonstrated that Drb1 co-localizes with cytoplasmic aggregates mediated by TAR DNA-binding protein 43, a major component of ALS and FTLD-related inclusion bodies. We also defined the domains involved in the subcellular localization of Drb1 to clarify the role of Drb1 in the formation of cytoplasmic aggregates in ALS and FTLD. Drb1 predominantly localized in the nucleus via a classical nuclear localization signal in its carboxyl terminus and is a shuttling protein between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Furthermore, we identify a double leucine motif serving as a nuclear export signal. The Drb1 mutant, presenting mutations in both nuclear localization signal and nuclear export signal, is prone to aggregate in the cytoplasm. The mutant Drb1-induced cytoplasmic aggregates not only recruit TAR DNA-binding protein 43 but also decrease the mitochondrial membrane potential. Taken together, these results indicate that perturbation of Drb1 nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking induces toxic cytoplasmic aggregates, suggesting that mislocalization of Drb1 is involved in the cause of cytotoxicity in neuronal cells."
https://openalex.org/W2389281650,"Transcription is a highly regulated process in all domains of life. In human mitochondria, transcription of the circular genome involves only two promoters, called light strand promoter (LSP) and heavy strand promoter (HSP), located in the opposite DNA strands. Initiation of transcription occurs upon sequential assembly of an initiation complex that includes mitochondrial RNA polymerase (mtRNAP) and the initiation factors mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) and TFB2M. It has been recently suggested that the transcription initiation factor TFAM binds to HSP and LSP in opposite directions, implying that the mechanisms of transcription initiation are drastically dissimilar at these promoters. In contrast, we found that binding of TFAM to HSP and the subsequent recruitment of mtRNAP results in a pre-initiation complex that is remarkably similar in topology and properties to that formed at the LSP promoter. Our data suggest that assembly of the pre-initiation complexes on LSP and HSP brings these transcription units in close proximity, providing an opportunity for regulatory proteins to simultaneously control transcription initiation in both mtDNA strands.

Both strands of human mtDNA encode subunits of protein complexes involved in energy production by oxidative phosphorylation. Transcription of human mitochondrial genome is thus bi-directional and is driven by two closely spaced promoters (1Falkenberg M. Larsson N.G. Gustafsson C.M.

Commun. 2014; 53077Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) suggested that the IC assembled at HSP has a different structure and opposite orientation as compared with the IC assembled on LSP. However, the 22-bp DNA fragment used by Ngo et al. (9Ngo H.B. Lovely G.A. Phillips R. Chan D.C. Distinct structural features of TFAM drive mitochondrial DNA packaging versus transcriptional activation.Nat. Commun. 2014; 53077Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) to represent the HSP contains only a part of the TFAM-binding site that is required for promoter function (see Fig. 1a). The DNase I footprint of TFAM on HSP has been mapped to the region from −15 to −40 relative to the promoter start site (10Fisher R.P. Clayton D.A. Purification and characterization of human mitochondrial transcription factor 1.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3496-3509Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 11Fisher R.P. Topper J.N. Clayton D.A. Promoter selection in human mitochondria involves binding of a transcription factor to orientation-independent upstream regulatory elements.Cell. 1987; 50: 247-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Moreover, the exonuclease III (Exo III) footprint of mtRNAP-TFB2M assembled on a pre-melted HSP indicated protection of a 15-bp region upstream of the promoter start site (12Sologub M. Litonin D.

Consistent with this observation, the −11 base in HSP makes contact with the mtRNAP (13Litonin D. Sologub M. Shi Y. Savkina M. Anikin M. Falkenberg M. Gustafsson C.M. Temiakov D.

Importantly, substitution of the region −30 to −40 (which is absent from the oligonucleotides used by Ngo et al. (9Ngo H.B. Lovely G.A. Phillips R. Chan D.C. Distinct structural features of TFAM drive mitochondrial DNA packaging versus transcriptional activation.Nat.

Identification of transcriptional regulatory elements in human mitochondrial DNA by linker substitution analysis.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1200-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We conclude that the DNA fragment used by Ngo et al. (9Ngo H.B. Lovely G.A. Phillips R. Chan D.C. Distinct structural features of TFAM drive mitochondrial DNA packaging versus transcriptional activation.Nat. Commun. 2014; 53077Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) in their structural studies is incomplete, and that the reported structure likely represents a nonspecific DNA-TFAM complex (similar to that observed by Ngo et al. on an unrelated DNA template). In this work, we compared initiation complexes assembled on LSP and HSP using protein-DNA and protein-protein cross-linking and found that these complexes are very similar in molecular architecture. In support of their model, Ngo et al. (7Ngo H.B. Kaiser J.T. Chan D.C. The mitochondrial transcription and packaging factor Tfam imposes a U-turn on mitochondrial DNA.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18: 1290-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 9Ngo H.B. Lovely G.A. Phillips R. Chan D.C. Distinct structural features of TFAM drive mitochondrial DNA packaging versus transcriptional activation.Nat. Commun. 2014; 53077Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) presented variants of TFAM (Y162A and L6 (K136A, H137A, K139A, R140A, K146A, K147A)) that could not support transcription on LSP but were as active on the HSP promoter as the wild-type TFAM. We repeated these experiments and found that, contrary to the study by Ngo et al. (9Ngo H.B. Lovely G.A. Phillips R. Chan D.C. Distinct structural features of TFAM drive mitochondrial DNA packaging versus transcriptional activation.Nat. Commun. 2014; 53077Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), these mutants were similarly defective in transcription initiation on both LSP and HSP (Fig. 1, b and c). In addition, the C-terminal deletion mutants of TFAM that were defective in transcription initiation on LSP were defective in experiments involving HSP (Fig. 2d), further supporting a similar mode of TFAM binding to both mitochondrial promoters. TFAM makes two distinct contacts with mtRNAP in the presence of LSP, as revealed by site-specific cross-linking (2Morozov Y.I. Agaronyan K. Cheung A.C. Anikin M. Cramer P. Temiakov D.

A model for transcription initiation in human mitochondria.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43: 3726-3735Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar): residue 217 cross-links to the residue Trp-122 in the N-terminal extension region of the mtRNAP, and residue 228 cross-links to the promoter-binding domain of mtRNAP, region 444–462 (Fig. 2a). To clarify whether the topology of the HSP pre-IC is distinct from that assembled on LSP, we looked at major interactions found in the LSP pre-IC: one involving the C terminus of TFAM and the N-terminal region of mtRNAP and the other involving the upstream promoter DNA and mtRNAP (2Morozov Y.I. Agaronyan K. Cheung A.C. Anikin M. Cramer P. Temiakov D. A novel intermediate in transcription initiation by human mitochondrial RNA polymerase.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 3884-3893Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We mapped interactions of TFAM having a photo-reactive amino acid, Bpa, incorporated in the C terminus of TFAM at position 217 with a 32P-labeled variant of mtRNAP (Fig. 2b). The cross-link between mtRNAP and TFAM can only be detected when DNA (either promoter or nonspecific) is present (2Morozov Y.I. Agaronyan K. Cheung A.C. Anikin M. Cramer P. Temiakov D. A novel intermediate in transcription initiation by human mitochondrial RNA polymerase.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 3884-3893Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Treatment of the mtRNAP-TFAM cross-link with hydroxylamine (which cleaves the peptide bond between Asn and Gly residues) resulted in generation of labeled species containing the N-terminal fragment of mtRNAP (residues 44–150) and TFAM (Fig. 2b, lanes 2 and 3), regardless of which promoter DNA was used for the assembly of the complex. We previously demonstrated that the absolutely conserved residue Trp-122 of mtRNAP likely serves as the primary target for Bpa cross-link when the pre-IC is assembled on LSP (2Morozov Y.I. Agaronyan K. Cheung A.C. Anikin M. Cramer P. Temiakov D. A novel intermediate in transcription initiation by human mitochondrial RNA polymerase.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 3884-3893Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Indeed, the efficiency of cross-link between TFAM and the W122A variant of mtRNAP was about 20 times lower as compared with WT mtRNAP (Fig. 2c, upper panel, lanes 1 and 3). We repeated this experiment using the pre-ICs assembled on the HSP and found a similar effect for W122A substitution on cross-link efficiency (Fig. 2c, upper panel, lanes 2 and 4). We therefore conclude that the Trp-122 residue constitutes the primary point of interaction between mtRNAP and TFAM at the HSP promoter as well, suggesting that the topology of the mtRNAP-TFAM complex is similar on both promoters. As expected, another point of contact, between TFAM residue 228 and mtRNAP region 444–463, was unaffected by W122A substitution as the similar efficiency of cross-linking was observed in the case of both LSP and HSP (Fig. 2c, lower panel). An important characteristic of the pre-IC is the interaction between the far upstream region of promoter DNA and mtRNAP. This interaction is revealed by means of photo cross-linking of 32P-labeled DNA having 4-thio UMP at base −49 with mtRNAP in the presence of the nonspecific DNA competitor (2Morozov Y.I. Agaronyan K.

A novel intermediate in transcription initiation by human mitochondrial RNA polymerase.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 3884-3893Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We found that, similar to LSP (2Morozov Y.I. Agaronyan K. Cheung A.C. Anikin M. Cramer P. Temiakov D.

The mitochondrial transcription and packaging factor Tfam imposes a U-turn on mitochondrial DNA.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18: 1290-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), TFAM bends the HSP promoter to bring the upstream region in close proximity to mtRNAP, as evident from DNA-mtRNAP cross-linking (Fig. 2d). Our data reveal identical point contacts at a single-amino acid and a single-DNA base resolution in complexes assembled on both mitochondrial promoters. We therefore conclude that the pre-ICs assembled on HSP and LSP have similar overall topology and suggest that regulation of transcription initiation at these promoters occurs in a similar manner and serves to ensure coordinated expression of mitochondrial genes from both mtDNA strands. In human mtDNA, LSP and HSP are located just 150 bp apart from each other. Our model predicts that two transcription units assemble in a close proximity to each other (Fig. 2e), and therefore their activity may be regulated simultaneously by yet unidentified transcription factors(s).

The pre-ICs were assembled using 32P-labeled Bpa-TFAM (100 nm), mtRNAP (300 nm), and the LSP (300 nm) or the HSP (300 nm) promoters. The cross-linking was activated by UV irradiation at 312 nm for 15 min at room temperature. Hydroxylamine cleavage of pre-IC was performed as described previously (2Morozov Y.I. Agaronyan K.

The complex structures predicted by the protein docking simulation were computationally selected and validated by the experimental kinetic data for mutant Cyt c in the electron transfer reaction to CcO. The interaction analysis using the selected Cyt c-CcO complex structure revealed the electrostatic and hydrophobic contributions of each amino acid residue to the free energy required for complex formation. Several charged residues showed large unfavorable (desolvation) electrostatic interactions that were almost cancelled out by large favorable (Columbic) electrostatic interactions but resulted in the destabilization of the complex. The residual destabilizing free energy is compensated by the van der Waals interactions mediated by hydrophobic amino acid residues to give the stabilized complex. Thus, hydrophobic interactions are the primary factors that promote complex formation between Cyt c and CcO under turnover conditions, whereas the change in the electrostatic destabilization free energy provides the variance of the binding free energy in the mutants.

In this study, we have examined the catalytic activity of Twinkle helicase on model replication fork and DNA repair structures. Although Twinkle behaves as a traditional 5′ to 3′ helicase on conventional forked duplex substrates, the enzyme efficiently dissociates D-loop DNA substrates irrespective of whether it possesses a 5′ or 3′ single-stranded tailed invading strand. In contrast, we report for the first time that Twinkle branch-migrates an open-ended mobile three-stranded DNA structure with a strong 5′ to 3′ directionality preference. To determine how well Twinkle handles potential roadblocks to mtDNA replication, we tested the ability of the helicase to unwind substrates with site-specific oxidative DNA lesions or bound by the mitochondrial transcription factor A. Twinkle helicase is inhibited by DNA damage in a unique manner that is dependent on the type of oxidative lesion and the strand in which it resides. Novel single molecule FRET binding and unwinding assays show an interaction of the excluded strand with Twinkle as well as events corresponding to stepwise unwinding and annealing. TFAM inhibits Twinkle unwinding, suggesting other replisome proteins may be required for efficient removal. These studies shed new insight on the catalytic functions of Twinkle on the key DNA structures it would encounter during replication or possibly repair of the mitochondrial genome and how well it tolerates potential roadblocks to DNA unwinding.

Presumably other proteins, including auxiliary DNA helicases (PIF1, DNA2, SUV3, and RECQ4) (15.Ding L. Liu Y. Borrowing nuclear DNA helicases to protect mitochondrial DNA.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2015; 16: 10870-10887Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), may either assist or substitute for Twinkle in dealing with certain alternative DNA structures. Despite the wealth of information that has been gained from molecular studies of Twinkle helicase, its precise role(s) in mtDNA replication remain to be fully characterized. Moreover, it is unclear whether Twinkle plays any role in mtDNA repair. In this work, Twinkle was tested on a series of DNA structures associated with the replication fork or DNA repair to ascertain the enzyme's substrate specificity. For the first time, we report Twinkle's activity on three-stranded DNA structures, including mobile and immobile D-loop substrates, as well open mobile three-stranded DNA structures designed to assay for putative branch migration activity of Twinkle and its directionality. In a second line of inquiry, we determined the effects of covalent oxidative DNA lesions or noncovalent protein-DNA complexes, both of which represent potential impediments to mitochondrial DNA metabolic processes, on Twinkle helicase activity. The results from these studies shed new insight on Twinkle's catalytic functions on key DNA structures it would encounter during the replication of the mitochondrial genome and potentially other processes, including DNA repair in the organelle. Although Twinkle DNA helicase is an essential player in mtDNA replication (1.Rajala N. Gerhold J.M. Martinsson P. Klymov A. Spelbrink J.N. Replication factors transiently associate with mtDNA at the mitochondrial inner membrane to facilitate replication.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 952-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), its preferential activity on replication fork-associated structures has not been extensively examined. Therefore, we performed Twinkle protein titrations on a series of sequence-related DNA substrates that resemble DNA replication intermediates. Twinkle most efficiently unwound a forked duplex substrate with naked 5′ and 3′ single-stranded arms (substrate 1) (Fig. 1, A and E). A 5′ flap substrate representing an intermediate of strand displacement synthesis at the replication fork (substrate 2) was also unwound by Twinkle (Fig. 1B), but not to quite the same extent as the naked fork, particularly evident at a Twinkle concentration of 0.8 nm hexamer in which there was ∼7-fold difference in percent substrate unwound (Fig. 1E). Notably, Twinkle unwound the downstream 5′ flap oligonucleotide of the 5′ flap DNA substrate (Fig. 1B), consistent with its 5′ to 3′ directionality of unwinding (10.Jemt E. Farge G. Bäckström S. Holmlund T. Gustafsson C.M. Falkenberg M.

Nandakumar D. Tang G.Q. Patel S.S. The human mitochondrial DNA helicase TWINKLE is both an unwinding and an annealing helicase.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 14545-14556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Conversely, Twinkle showed relatively poor activity on a 3′ flap substrate (substrate 3) that lacks a pre-existing 5′ single-stranded tail (Fig. 1, C and E). In the case of the 3′ flap substrate, two minor radiolabeled products were observed, 3′ single strand tailed duplex and the single strand species (Fig. 1, C and E). Twinkle helicase activity on the synthetic replication fork structure with both 5′ and 3′ double-stranded arms (substrate 4) generated the same radiolabeled products as that for the 3′ flap substrate (Fig. 1D); unwound substrate was ∼4-fold less than that observed for the 5′ flap substrate at 1.6 nm Twinkle hexamer concentration (Fig. 1E), suggesting that the double strand character of the displaced strand negatively affects Twinkle unwinding. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed with the same replication fork-associated DNA substrates tested for helicase activity to evaluate DNA binding by Twinkle (Fig. 2). Here it was observed that DNA substrates with pre-existing single-stranded tails (naked fork (substrate 1), 3′ flap (substrate 3), 5′ flap (substrate 2)) were bound to a greater extent than the synthetic replication fork structure. A small fraction of the double-stranded replication fork substrate (substrate 4) was detectably bound by Twinkle at helicase protein concentrations of 3.2 nm or 6.4 nm. Interestingly, some binding of the 5′ flap or 3′ flap substrates was detected at 1.6 nm Twinkle, whereas this was not reproducibly observed for the forked duplex with both 5′ and 3′ single-stranded arms. The previously reported preferential binding of Twinkle to double-stranded DNA over single-stranded DNA (12.Sen D. Nandakumar D. Tang G.Q. Patel S.S. The human mitochondrial DNA helicase TWINKLE is both an unwinding and an annealing helicase.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 14545-14556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) may contribute to the apparent difference; however, the poor binding of Twinkle to the synthetic replication fork suggests that single strand character in the fork substrate contributes to stable binding by Twinkle as detected by EMSA. These results suggest that for the replication fork structures, Twinkle preferentially binds those substrates with pre-existing single strand character; however, the preferential binding to 3′ flap substrate is not reflected by enhanced Twinkle helicase activity on that substrate. The observed differences in Twinkle helicase activity on the replication fork-associated DNA structures under multi-turnover conditions led us to perform experiments in which Twinkle was tested on these same substrates under single-turnover conditions. Under single-turnover conditions, Twinkle is incubated with a greater concentration of radiolabeled DNA substrate (2.5 nm) compared with the concentration of DNA substrate (0.5 nm) used for multi-turnover conditions; moreover, after pre-incubation of radiolabeled DNA substrate with Twinkle helicase, the reaction is initiated with the simultaneous addition of ATP and a large (100-fold) excess of unlabeled dT200 to limit any loading of Twinkle helicase molecules onto the radiolabeled substrate during the course of the incubation period. In control experiments, a 100-fold excess of dT200 in the helicase reaction resulted in a 95% reduction in Twinkle helicase activity on the forked duplex (substrate 1). Under these conditions, Twinkle helicase activity was determined as a function of time to obtain rates of DNA unwinding on the various substrates. As shown in Fig. 3A, Twinkle unwound the forked duplex substrate with 5′ and 3′ single-stranded arms (substrate 1) at a similar rate compared with the 5′ flap substrate (substrate 2), which were 10-fold greater than the 3′ flap substrate (substrate 3) or synthetic replication fork structure (substrate 4) (Fig. 3A, inset). The reduced but detectable unwinding of DNA substrates lacking a pre-existing 5′ single-stranded arm (synthetic replication fork or 3′ flap substrate) led us to examine Twinkle activity on simple 5′ tailed or 3′ tailed partial duplex substrates under single-turnover conditions. Here we observed that Twinkle unwound the 5′ tailed duplex substrate (substrate 5) at ∼5-fold greater rate than the 3′ tailed duplex (substrate 6) (Fig. 3B), consistent with its preferential 5′ to 3′ directionality of unwinding under multi-turnover conditions (10.Jemt E. Farge G. Bäckström S. Holmlund T. Gustafsson C.M. Falkenberg M.

Nandakumar D. Tang G.Q. Patel S.S. The human mitochondrial DNA helicase TWINKLE is both an unwinding and an annealing helicase.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 14545-14556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although the precise mechanism of mtDNA replication is still debated, it is generally believed that a D-loop structure allows for effective and efficient replication of the heavy and light strands (16.Wanrooij S. Falkenberg M. The human mitochondrial replication fork in health and disease.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1797: 1378-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In addition, the D-loop substrate represents a key early intermediate of homologous recombination (HR) repair (17.Kowalczykowski S.C. An overview of the molecular mechanisms of recombinational DNA repair.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2015; 7: a016410Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Thus, it is probable that Twinkle would encounter D-loop structures in the mitochondrial genome. However, up to this point, the catalytic activity of Twinkle has not been tested on D-loop structures. To address this, initial experiments were performed in which increasing concentrations of Twinkle were incubated with immobile three-stranded D-loop DNA substrates with a fixed noncomplementary 5′ ssDNA tail (substrate 7), 3′ ssDNA tail (substrate 8), or no tail altogether (substrate 9) as well as two-stranded bubble DNA substrate (substrate 10) for comparison. Twinkle was able to unwind the invading third strand of all three immobile D-loop DNA substrates (Fig. 4, A–C); however, Twinkle preferentially unwound the 5′ tailed immobile D-loop substrate followed closely by the 3′ tailed immobile D-loop substrate, and less efficiently by the no tail immobile D-loop substrate (Fig. 4E). The bubble DNA substrate was unwound very poorly by Twinkle throughout the protein titration (Fig. 4, D and E). Based on these results, we conclude that Twinkle is able to unwind immobile D-loop DNA substrates, with a preference toward those substrates that bear a noncomplementary 5′ or 3′ single-stranded tail as a component of the invading third strand. We next sought to assess if Twinkle was capable of branch-migrating mobile three-stranded DNA substrates, because such structures would be physiologically relevant to its role during replication of the circular mitochondrial genome or potentially HR repair of mitochondrial DNA double strand breaks. We first tested Twinkle to branch-migrate mobile three-way junction DNA substrates that are designed to assess if the enzyme branch-migrates in a 5′ to 3′ (substrate 11) or 3′ to 5′ (substrate 13) direction. These substrates were previously used to characterize the 3′ to 5′ branch migration directionality catalyzed by the human recombinant RECQ1 helicase (18.Bugreev D.V. Brosh Jr., R.M. Mazin A.V. RECQ1 possesses DNA branch migration activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20231-20242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We observed that the Twinkle enzyme preferentially acts to branch-migrate in the 5′ to 3′ direction (Fig. 5, A and C); however, a very low level of 3′ to 5′ branch migration was observed throughout the Twinkle titration (Fig. 5, B and C). Twinkle branch migration activity is dependent on ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 5D). To address the relative contributions of Twinkle branch migration versus helicase activity on the branch-migrate mobile three-way junction DNA substrate, we tested for Twinkle helicase activity on a forked duplex DNA substrate (substrate 12) that was characterized by the same 63 base pair duplex found in the three-way junction substrate (substrate 11). Twinkle was able to unwind the forked duplex substrate, but not quite to the same extent as its branch migration activity on substrate 11 (Fig. 5, E and F), suggesting that both Twinkle branch migration and helicase activities may contribute to disruption of the three-way junction substrates used in the current study. We then examined the ability of Twinkle to promote dissociation of mobile D-loop DNA substrates, which were previously shown to be acted upon by RECQ1 (18.Bugreev D.V. Brosh Jr., R.M. Mazin A.V. RECQ1 possesses DNA branch migration activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20231-20242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In contrast to what was observed for the mobile three-way junction DNA substrates, Twinkle displayed a similar level of activity on the mobile D-loop substrates designed to test for 5′ to 3′ directionality (substrate 14) (Fig. 6, A and C) or 3′ to 5′ directionality (substrate 15) (Fig. 6, B and C). The difference in results between the two types of mobile DNA substrates (three-way junction versus D-loop) suggests that Twinkle recognizes and loads on to the mobile D-loop substrate in a manner distinct from the mobile three-way junction substrate. Moreover, the ability of Twinkle to efficiently unwind the invading strand with a 5′ or 3′ single-stranded tail in the immobile D-loop DNA substrates suggests that Twinkle recognizes the D-loop substrate irrespective of the third strand polarity and its helicase activity may contribute to dissociation of the mobile D-loop substrate. As the energy powerhouse organelles of the cell, mitochondria produce oxygen radicals at a significant rate as byproducts of oxidative phosphorylation and the electron transport chain (19.Zorov D.B. Juhaszova M. Sollott S.J. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ROS-induced ROS release.Physiol. Rev. 2014; 94: 909-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (2320) Google Scholar). Persistence of these free radicals within the mitochondrial matrix can cause a variety of oxidative DNA lesions as well as damage to other macromolecules. A prominent form of oxidative DNA damage is Tg, which causes localized distortion of the DNA double helix (20.Kung H.C. Bolton P.H. Structure of a duplex DNA containing a thymine glycol residue in solution.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9227-9236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and blocks synthesis by a number of DNA polymerases (21.Berquist B.R. Wilson 3rd., D.M. Pathways for repairing and tolerating the spectrum of oxidative DNA lesions.Cancer Lett. 2012; 327: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Given that Twinkle is likely to encounter Tg lesions during mtDNA replication, we set out to examine the effect of a single Tg residing in either the helicase-translocating or non-translocating strand within the double-stranded portion of a forked duplex DNA substrate that Twinkle efficiently unwinds. As shown in Fig. 7, Twinkle unwound the undamaged DNA substrate (substrate 16) and damaged DNA substrates in a protein concentration dependent manner; however, there were some apparent differences in the percent substrate unwound. Tg in the helicase translocating strand (substrate 18) inhibited Twinkle helicase activity by a maximal 2-fold at a Twinkle hexamer concentration of 0.9 nm, whereas there was no statistically significant effect of the non-translocating strand Tg (substrate 17) on Twinkle helicase activity throughout the protein titration. We then tested Twinkle helicase on a forked duplex harboring a cPu adduct, which distorts normal B-form double helical DNA by altering normal base stacking and helical twist (22.Huang H. Das R.S. Basu A.K. Stone M.P. Structure of (5′S)-8,5′-cyclo-2′-deoxyguanosine in DNA.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2011; 133: 20357-20368Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 23.Zaliznyak T.

Toxicol. 2012; 25: 2103-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Unlike the results from the experiments with the Tg forked duplex DNA substrates, there was no inhibitory effect of the either cyclo-dA (Fig. 8, A and B) or cyclo-dG (Fig. 8, C and D) in the translocating strand (substrate 20, substrate 22) or non-translocating strand (substrate 19, substrate 21), for that matter. To test for a direct interaction between the helicase and the nontranslocating strand of the model DNA fork, single molecule FRET (smFRET) experiments were performed as described previously (24.Graham B.W. Schauer G.D. Leuba S.H. Trakselis M.A. Steric exclusion and wrapping of the excluded DNA strand occurs along discrete external binding paths during MCM helicase unwinding.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: 6585-6595Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 25.Rothenberg E.

Chem. 2007; 282: 34229-34234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Three FRET-labeled DNA fork substrates (30/30 (substrate 23), 40/30 (substrate 24), 50/30 (substrate 25)) were tested that had 30 bases (dT) on the 5′ arm of the fork where the helicase loads, and increasing 30, 40, and 50 bases (dT) on the 3′ excluded arm of the fork. Histograms for the immobilized DNA forks alone produced a single stable low-FRET peak corresponding to the termini of the fork arms not being in close proximity (Fig. 9A). Increasingly longer 3′ fork arms correspond to lower FRET signals as expected. When Twinkle was added to each of these forks, there was a concomitant shift to higher FRET states for all three substrates in the histogram (Fig. 9A). On the 30/30 substrate, Twinkle's interaction with the fork results in a predominantly high-FRET population with additional smaller medium FRET populations. The 30/50 fork produced a nearly identical histogram, but the 30/40 substrate had larger low- and medium-FRET populations with a smaller high-FRET population. In the case of all three substrates, we see a significant high-FRET population, which has previously been shown to correspond to a wrapping interaction where the excluded strand wraps around the outer surface of the helicase (24.Graham B.W.

In the plasma and vacuolar membranes, there are 22 and 11 secondary amino acid transporters, respectively. These transporters are polytopic membrane proteins with 10–14 transmembrane segments. They belong to three superfamilies: amino acid/polyamine/organocation (APC), major facilitator superfamily (MFS), and amino acid/polyamine transporter II (AAPTII) (2Saier M.H. et al.Families of transmembrane transporters selective for amino acids and their derivatives.Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1775-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The amino acid transporters belonging to the APC superfamily are often referred to as amino acid permeases (AAPs).

Laskey R.A. et al.A polypeptide domain that specifies migration of nucleoplasmin into the nucleus.Cell. 1982; 30: 449-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 18Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. et al.Nuclear targeting sequences—a consensus?.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar). Although targeting signals for several organelles are well defined, information on the targeting of PM-destined proteins is scarce. Upon synthesis in the ER and maturation in the Golgi apparatus, transporters take different vesicular transport routes from the trans-Golgi network to the vacuole and to the PM. Those destined for the PM are delivered either directly, through the action of adaptor protein complexes, or can utilize a more specific route, such as the GSE (Gap1 sorting in the endosome) complex in the case of Gap1 (19Gao M. Kaiser C.A. et al.A conserved GTPase-containing complex is required for intracellular sorting of the general amino-acid permease in yeast.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Aside from these targeting and localization signals, few proteins throughout species contain specific sequences for association with the PM. These proteins mostly lack transmembrane domains, and their association signals usually have a specific role, mostly in a reversible association with the PM and/or cell signaling. These association signals are often represented by a single predicted amphipathic α-helix but can be more complex (20Cornell R.B. Taneva S.G. et al.Amphipathic helices as mediators of the membrane interaction of amphitropic proteins, and as modulators of bilayer physical properties.Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2006; 7: 539-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Interestingly, several AAPs have distinct localizations within the membrane, most notably Can1 and Tat1, which have been found in a compartment named microcompartment of Can1 (MCC) that co-localizes with a structural scaffold called the eisosome (13Malinska K. Malinsky J. Opekarova M. Tanner W. et al.Distribution of Can1p into stable domains reflects lateral protein segregation within the plasma membrane of living S. cerevisiae cells.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 6031-6041Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 21Malínská K. Malínský J. Opekarová M. Tanner W. et al.Visualization of protein compartmentation within the plasma membrane of living yeast cells.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4427-4436Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Although amino acid transporters represent a large group of proteins with the same main function, they also have an array of additional roles performed in different locations. It is unclear which cues lead to distinct localizations of these proteins, not only to the designated membrane but also to a distinct location within the PM. Here, we report on a consensus sequence, PMasseq, found in a subset of AAPs that has a capacity to associate with the yeast plasma membrane. Compared with other sequences mostly found in soluble proteins across species, PMasseq, which is conserved in fungi, is one of the most complex. It consists of two helices, one of them amphipathic, and an FWC signature that allows for its thioesterification with a palmitoyl moiety by palmitoyl acyltransferase Pfa4, thereby creating a lipid tether to the membrane (22Roth A.F. Wan J. Bailey A.O. Sun B. Kuchar J.A. Green W.N. Phinney B.S. Yates 3rd, J.R. Davis N.G. et al.Global analysis of protein palmitoylation in yeast.Cell. 2006; 125: 1003-1013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). PMasseq interacts with lipids and presumably with proteins in the PM, thereby modulating the position of the transporter in the lipid bilayer. Intriguingly, in reporter constructs containing PMasseq and a strong tandem cNLS, a sequence to target proteins to the nucleus, PMasseq overrides the nuclear localization signal (NLS) in protein targeting. PMasseq can therefore be used as a delivery vehicle for the PM. We aimed to identify structural determinants involved in the localization of polytopic membrane proteins either to the PM or VM. All amino acid transporters residing either in the PM or in the VM were grouped on the basis of evolutionary relatedness, that is as members of the APC, MFS, and AAPTII families, and their annotation as amino acid transporters. Sequence alignments of these proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae failed to identify a motif(s) that could be responsible for protein targeting. We then compared specific segments of individual PM transporters, i.e. transmembrane regions, loops, and protein termini, with the corresponding segments of VM transporters. Segments were identified using the membrane topology prediction program TOPCONS (23Hennerdal A. Elofsson A. et al.Rapid membrane protein topology prediction.Bioinformatics. 2011; 27: 1322-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This approach revealed significantly longer C termini in PM-resident amino acid transporters than in the corresponding proteins of the VM (Fig. 1A). When we extended the comparison to other annotated S. cerevisiae transporters, a similar difference in tail length was observed (Fig. 1B). In our analysis, we excluded proteins with more than 150 residues in their C termini (four of 79 in PM proteins and eight of 35 VM proteins) as these are known or predicted to form discrete domains with specific functions (supplemental Table S1). Taken together, our analysis in silico indicates that there is a correlation between the length of the C terminus and subcellular localization. Next, we compared the length of the N and C termini of prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins from the three families (supplemental Fig. S1). In all cases, both the N and C termini are longer in the eukaryotes, which is in agreement with the regulatory roles that these tail regions are known or predicted to have (2Saier M.H. et al.Families of transmembrane transporters selective for amino acids and their derivatives.Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1775-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Although the difference in N-terminal length is very distinctive in all families, it is less pronounced for the C termini of the AAPTII and MFS proteins than it is for the APC members. Zooming in on the localization of the MFS proteins in eukaryotes, we found a wide division of lengths with those with a shorter C terminus annotated to localize mainly to subcellular membranes. Hence, the shift to longer C termini in the APC family could be related to their distinct localization in the PM (supplemental Fig. S2). The majority of the amino acid transporters localizing to the PM belong to the APC superfamily and are often referred to as AAPs, a subset belonging to the MFS family (1Ljungdahl P.O. Daignan-Fornier B. et al.Regulation of amino acid, nucleotide, and phosphate metabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 2012; 190: 885-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). An alignment of the C termini of AAP sequences (see “Experimental Procedures”) showed conserved clusters of aromatic residues at the beginning and at the end of the sequences together with alternating positively and negatively charged clusters (Fig. 2A). Nine transporters contain the FWC signature at the very end, and one transporter (Mmp1) contains the related FFC sequence (24Gatto Jr., G.J. Berg J.M. et al.Nonrandom tripeptide sequence distributions at protein carboxyl termini.Genome Res. 2003; 13: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The FWC-containing C termini have been reported to contain a conserved α-helix (25Hein C. André B. et al.A C-terminal di-leucine motif and nearby sequences are required for NH4+-induced inactivation and degradation of the general amino acid permease, Gap1p, of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 607-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Our secondary structure analysis identified a second predicted α-helix at the very end of the sequence that is conserved in all but two of the AAPs, Dip5 and Agp2 (Fig. 2A). We refer to the upstream and downstream helices as Ha and Hb, respectively. Helical wheel projections and the calculated hydrophobic moment show that Hb has features similar to amphipathic motifs known to bind membranes, including clusters of positive and/or aromatic residues (20Cornell R.B. Taneva S.G. et al.Amphipathic helices as mediators of the membrane interaction of amphitropic proteins, and as modulators of bilayer physical properties.Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2006; 7: 539-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). The C terminus of Uga4, a non-core member of the AAPs that resides in the vacuolar membrane and was used as a control in this study, is predicted to have a single non-amphipathic α-helix without aromatic clusters (Fig. 2, A and B). The predicted secondary structure was verified by circular dichroism (CD) using a synthetic peptide corresponding to the last 31 residues of Gap1 (Fig. 2C). The CD spectrum showed a clear positive peak at 193 nm and negative peaks at 208 and 222 nm that are characteristic of α-helical polypeptides (26Greenfield N.J. et al.Using circular dichroism spectra to estimate protein secondary structure.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 2876-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar). This signal became even more pronounced in the presence of trifluoroethanol (27Sönnichsen F.D. Van Eyk J.E. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. et al.Effect of trifluoroethanol on protein secondary structure: an NMR and CD study using a synthetic actin peptide.Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8790-8798Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar), thus confirming the predictions in silico. We determined the physiological relevance of the C-terminal tail of AAP transporters by generating a series of S. cerevisiae strains containing AAPs in which the last 10 amino acid residues were deleted and thus most of the amphipathic helix Hb. Wild-type (WT) and truncated versions of the transporters were tagged with the fluorescent protein mKate2, and the fusions were expressed from the endogenous promoters on the chromosome. No significant differences in expression or localization between WT and truncated mKate2 transporters were visible by confocal microscopy, probably due to the relatively low expression levels (supplemental Fig. S3). Low expression levels could be the consequence of the added tag on the C terminus. Irrespective of this, strains expressing truncated versions of a subset of AAPs exhibited a distinct phenotype under restricted growth conditions. The Hb helix in AAPs with the FWC signature is required for growth on a non-fermentable carbon source (glycerol; SG) as shown for Gap1 and Tat2 (Fig. 2D). In contrast, removal of the last 10 residues of Lyp1 and Can1, AAPs responsible for the transport of lysine and arginine, respectively, did not have a strong adverse effect on cell growth. Although in the case of Lyp1Δ10 colonies were smaller, the strain was viable. Contrary to deleting the Hb helix, deletion of the entire gene for Gap1 did not affect growth on SG, indicating that the C termini of Gap1 and possibly Tat2 control a negative-dominant function of the protein. The strains expressing truncated versions of AAPs exhibited no visible growth defect when grown on a fermentable carbon source (glucose; SD). Thus, on the basis of physiological studies, the C termini fall in two categories: those with the FWC motif seem more important for cell growth under restrictive conditions than those without this signature motif. As amphipathic helices in many proteins have a tendency to interact with membranes, we asked whether the C-terminal segments of the AAPs alone associate with the PM or other membranes in the cell. This has previously been shown for a region of the C terminus of Bap2 (28Omura F. Kodama Y. Ashikari T. et al.The basal turnover of yeast branched-chain amino acid permease Bap2p requires its C-terminal tail.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 194: 207-214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal segments of selected AAPs (sequences depicted in Fig. 2A), were fused to GFP, and the genes were placed under the control of an inducible promoter and expressed in S. cerevisiae. Two clear localization patterns were observed. C termini containing the FWC signature mainly localized to the cell periphery (Fig. 3A), whereas those without the FWC signature were soluble and/or partially aggregated in the cytosol (Fig. 3B). This suggests that the FWC signature may play a role in the association of the C termini of AAPs with the PM. To confirm this suggestion, we added the FWC tripeptide sequence to the cytosolically localized C termini. In the case of Alp1, Lyp1, and Can1, the addition of FWC caused the reporter protein to associate with cell membranes (Fig. 3C). The relevance of the AAP C-terminal sequence upstream of FWC for association with the membrane is demonstrated by the C terminus of Uga4, which failed to localize at the cell periphery with or without the addition of the FWC signature. Interestingly, in contrast to the homogenous distribution at the PM of most FWC-containing reporters, the C terminus of the histidine transporter Hip1 led to a patchy distribution of the protein in the cell. A similar pattern, but to a lesser extent, was observed for Can1C+FWC and Alp1C+FWC. Heterologous expression of the reporters in Pichia pastoris displayed the same distribution pattern (supplemental Fig. S4A). The phenotypic conservation in P. pastoris is in agreement with the conservation of the AAP C termini, including the FWC motif and the upstream basic and aromatic residues, in other budding yeast (supplemental Fig. S4C and supplemental Table S2). To investigate which residues are important for membrane association, we analyzed the C-terminal sequences in more detail by deleting clusters of three to five conserved residues from the Gap1C reporter protein (Fig. 4, A and B). Deletion of WKLF, DID, RRE, and DLD did not affect the association of the GFP-tagged C terminus with the PM. Deletions of EEK (in the middle of helix Ha), PRWYR (half of helix Hb), and FWC led to a cytosolic localization with sporadic aggregate formation. CD analysis of synthetic peptides corresponding to these deletions showed a reduced α-helical signature compared with wild-type Gap1C (Fig. 4C). For the ΔPRWYR and ΔFWC peptides, the spectra are shifted toward that expected for a disordered protein, namely a negative peak at around 195 nm and very little ellipticity above 210 nm (26Greenfield N.J. et al.Using circular dichroism spectra to estimate protein secondary structure.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 2876-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar) This suggests that the α-helical secondary structure of Gap1C is necessary for its association with the plasma membrane. Sequences capable of forming amphipathic helices and suggested to associate with the PM have been identified in a number of proteins throughout species (20Cornell R.B. Taneva S.G. et al.Amphipathic helices as mediators of the membrane interaction of amphitropic proteins, and as modulators of bilayer physical properties.Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2006; 7: 539-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The most investigated sequence in yeast, which at the same time represents a rather complex association signal, is that of Ist2, the cortical ER protein involved in ER-PM tethering (8Kralt A. Carretta M. Mari M. Reggiori F. Steen A. Poolman B. Veenhoff L.M. et al.Intrinsically disordered linker and plasma membrane-binding motif sort Ist2 and Ssy1 to junctions.Traffic. 2015; 16: 135-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 29Manford A.G.

Cell. 2012; 23: 1129-1140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The association of Ist2 with the PM requires one amphipathic helix followed by a cluster of positively charged residues in the C terminus (30Maass K. Fischer M.A. Seiler M. Temmerman K. Nickel W. Seedorf M. et al.A signal comprising a basic cluster and an amphipathic α-helix interacts with lipids and is required for the transport of Ist2 to the yeast cortical ER.J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In contrast to the C terminus of AAPs, the amphipathic C terminus of Ist2 fused to GFP led to a minor association with the PM, and the vast majority of the protein remained soluble in the cytosol in agreement with previous studies (31Jüschke C. Wächter A. Schwappach B. Seedorf M. et al.SEC18/NSF-independent, protein-sorting pathway from the yeast cortical ER to the plasma membrane.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4D). In other amphipathic helices that associate with cellular membranes, e.g. Mid1 from Schizosaccharomyces pombe or Ste5 from S. cerevisiae, an NLS or an NLS-like sequence was found within or in close proximity of the helix, which under certain conditions localized the proteins to the nucleus (32Celton-Morizur S. Bordes N. Fraisier V. Tran P.T. Paoletti A. et al.C-terminal anchoring of mid1p to membranes stabilizes cytokinetic ring position in early mitosis in fission yeast.Mol. Cell.

Cell. 2005; 20: 21-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the effect of the addition of a very strong tandem classical NLS (tcNLS) derived from Heh2 (34Meinema A.C. Laba J.K. Hapsari R.A. Otten R. Mulder F.A. Kralt A. van den Bogaart G. Lusk C.P. Poolman B. Veenhoff L.M. et al.Long unfolded linkers facilitate membrane protein import through the nuclear pore complex.Science. 2011; 333: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) to the C-terminal sequences of the AAP proteins. The addition of the tcNLS upstream of the C terminus of Gap1C did not affect its association with the PM (Fig. 4E). Conversely, addition of the NLS to the GFP-tagged C terminus of Ist2 localized the reporter to the nucleus. The same observation was made for GFP-Uga4C, GFP alone, and Gap1C lacking most of the amphipathic sequence, demonstrating that the membrane association signal found in AAPs is relatively strong when compared with those for targeting to organellar membranes. In conclusion, the sequence responsible for PM association (hereafter referred to as PMasseq) of the C termini of yeast AAPs is composed of two α-helices with the downstream helix being amphipathic and an FWC signature at the very C termini of the proteins. The conserved FWC sequence within yeast AAPs was previously identified in a large scale analysis in silico, and it was shown for a subset of AAPs that the C-terminal cysteine residue serves as a palmitoylation site (22Roth A.F. Wan J. Bailey A.O. Sun B. Kuchar J.A. Green W.N. Phinney B.S. Yates 3rd, J.R.

Berg J.M. et al.Nonrandom tripeptide sequence distributions at protein carboxyl termini.Genome Res. 2003; 13: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Palmitoylation is a reversible post-translational modification that is sensitive to reducing conditions (2Saier M.H. et al.Families of transmembrane transporters selective for amino acids and their derivatives.Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1775-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 35Linder M.E. Deschenes R.J. et al.New insights into the mechanisms of protein palmitoylation.Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4311-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). To examine whether the C termini derived from AAPs are indeed palmitoylated, we analyzed GFP-Gap1C from yeast cells, incubated in the presence or absence of DTT, using 15% SDS-PAGE. The amount of Gap1C in the membrane fraction was significantly lower after DTT incubation, indicating that the reporter protein was palmitoylated (Fig. 5A). To identify the enzyme responsible for the palmitoylation of GFP-Gap1C, we transformed yeast strains lacking one of the seven palmitoyl acyltransferases. Only in the strain lacking Pfa4 was an effect seen with most of the reporter protein relocalizing to the cytosol and the internal membranes (Fig. 5B). In the strains lacking any of the other six palmitoyl acyltransferases, l"

Galectin-3 has been implicated in a broad range of biological processes from chemotaxis and inflammation to fibrosis and apoptosis. The role of galectin-3 as a modulator of inflammation has been studied intensively, and recent evidence suggests that it may serve as a protective factor in obesity and other metabolic disorders. Despite considerable interest in galectin-3, little is known about its physiological regulation at the transcriptional level. Here, using knockout mice, chromatin immunoprecipitations, and cellular and molecular analyses, we show that the zinc finger transcription factor Krüppel-like factor 3 (KLF3) directly represses galectin-3 transcription. We find that galectin-3 is broadly up-regulated in KLF3-deficient mouse tissues, that KLF3 occupies regulatory regions of the Lgals3 gene, and that KLF3 directly binds its cognate elements (CACCC boxes) in the galectin-3 promoter and represses its activation in cellular assays. We also provide mechanistic insights into the regulation of Lgals3, demonstrating that C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) is required to drive optimal KLF3-mediated silencing. These findings help to enhance our understanding of how expression of the inflammatory modulator galectin-3 is controlled, opening up avenues for potential therapeutic interventions in the future.

KLF3 is notable for being primarily a repressor of transcription. Upon binding control regions of its target genes, KLF3 recruits the co-repressor C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) via the N-terminal functional domain (17Turner J.

Here we set out to assess whether Lgals3 is a bona fide target of KLF3-mediated repression at the transcriptional level. We found that Lgals3 is consistently up-regulated in mouse-derived cell lines lacking KLF3, prompting a more rigorous examination of Lgals3 expression across KLF3-deficient tissues. Lgals3 was found to be highly derepressed in both subcutaneous and visceral white adipose depots as well as in the heart and pancreas of Klf3−/− mice. Given its importance in fat homeostasis, closer examination of Lgals3 deregulation in subcutaneous adipose tissue was undertaken by immunohistochemistry, illustrating a distinct up-regulation in both the adipocytes and stromal vascular compartment in the absence of KLF3. The ability of KLF3 to bind to regulatory elements within the Lgals3 gene was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, suggesting that KLF3 occupies Lgals3 regulatory regions in vivo. We also demonstrated that KLF1-driven activation of Lgals3 is suppressed with the addition of KLF3 and that CtBP participates in the mediation of repression. Together, these results represent the first evidence that Lgals3 is a direct target of KLF3 binding and repression. Interestingly, mice lacking Lgals3 display increased fat mass and systemic inflammation (26Pang J. Rhodes D.H. Pini M. Akasheh R.T. Castellanos K.J. Cabay R.J. Cooper D. Perretti M.

The observation that KLF3 directly represses the galectin-3 gene and that the two proteins play what are essentially opposing roles in metabolic homeostasis is consistent with contributing to a regulatory circuit that controls both inflammation and metabolism. In studies of the role of KLF3 in hematopoiesis and red blood cell development, microarrays performed on Ter119+ fetal liver cells lacking KLF3 revealed that the Lgals3 gene was consistently up-regulated in knockout animals (15Funnell A.P. Norton L.J. Mak K.S. Burdach J. Artuz C.M. Twine N.A. Wilkins M.R. Power C.A. Hung T.T. Perdomo J. Koh P. Bell-Anderson K.S. Orkin S.H. Fraser S.T.

Biol. 2012; 32: 3281-3292Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Because of the importance of galectin-3 in a number of biological settings, we undertook a fuller analysis of whether the expression of Lgals3 was altered in a range of mouse tissues in the absence of KLF3. Lgals3 mRNA levels were assessed in cultured murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) as well as a series of primary tissues from wild-type and Klf3−/− mice by quantitative real-time PCR. In primary and immortalized Klf3−/− MEFs, Lgals3 mRNA was up-regulated 4.7- and 4.3-fold, respectively, compared with wild-type expression (Fig. 1A). Importantly, Lgals3 levels were also found to be elevated in a number of primary tissues dissected from KLF3-deficient mice (Fig. 1B). Derepression was most evident in Klf3−/− subcutaneous (6.7-fold) and epididymal (3.3-fold) white adipose depots and in the heart (6.6-fold) and pancreas (4.2-fold). Following the demonstration that Lgals3 is derepressed in Klf3−/− tissues at the mRNA level, we next sought to determine whether this up-regulation was reflected at the protein level. Whole cell protein extracts were prepared from wild-type and Klf3−/− fat depots and spleens, and the expression of galectin-3 protein was assessed by Western blotting (Fig. 1, C–F). Significant elevation of galectin-3 protein was evident in Klf3−/− white adipose depots, with up-regulation being 6.7-fold in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT) (Fig. 1D) and 7.6-fold in epididymal white adipose tissue (epiWAT) (Fig. 1E). Expression was also modestly but significantly up-regulated in the brown adipose tissue (BAT) (Fig. 1C) and spleen (Fig. 1F) of animals lacking KLF3 (3.5- and 2.4-fold, respectively). These observations correlate well with the degree of up-regulation observed at the transcript level and, together, point to widespread derepression of Lgals3 in the absence of KLF3. As galectin-3 expression was found to be markedly derepressed in Klf3−/− mouse adipose tissue at the mRNA and protein levels, we decided to determine in which specific cell types this was occurring using independent methodologies. We performed immunofluorescent staining of galectin-3 in scWAT (Fig. 2A). In accordance with mRNA and protein expression results, galectin-3 was found to be considerably up-regulated in Klf3−/− scWAT, as calculated by corrected total fluorescence (Fig. 2B). Klf3−/− scWAT in pairs 1 and 2 registered 9- and 10.5-fold up-regulation of galectin-3 expression, respectively. In addition to the examination of cellular galectin-3 levels, an ex vivo analysis of galectin-3 secretion from epiWAT explants was conducted by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, revealing 2.7-fold higher levels of secretion from Klf3−/− fat (Fig. 2C). Closer inspection of the scWAT by immunofluorescence showed increased galectin-3 staining in both adipocytes and cells of the stromal vascular compartment (the non-adipocytes) in scWAT lacking KLF3 (Fig. 2D). To better quantify the differential expression of Lgals3 in these subfractions of the scWAT, quantitative real-time PCR was conducted, confirming that Lgals3 mRNA is significantly up-regulated in both the adipocytes (5-fold) and stromal vascular cells (3.8-fold) of Klf3−/− scWAT (Fig. 2E). Given that galectin-3 is important in macrophage activation (2MacKinnon A.C. Farnworth S.L. Hodkinson P.S. Henderson N.C. Atkinson K.M. Leffler H. Nilsson U.J. Haslett C. Forbes S.J. Sethi T. et al.Regulation of alternative macrophage activation by galectin-3.J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 2650-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) and that macrophages are an integral cell type of the stromal vascular compartment, we assessed Lgals3 transcript levels in bone marrow-derived macrophages (Fig. 2F). We found that Lgals3 expression is modestly but significantly elevated in the absence of KLF3 in these cells, showing a 1.4-fold up-regulation. Taken together, these results demonstrate that galectin-3 expression is significantly derepressed at both the mRNA and protein levels in several different cell types and tissues in mice lacking KLF3. To investigate whether KLF3 regulates Lgals3 expression directly, the ability of KLF3 to bind to the Lgals3 locus was assessed. We first explored the mechanism by which KLF3 might directly repress Lgals3 by focusing on the proximal promoter. Indeed, KLF3 has been shown in several previous cases to silence gene expression by directly binding to promoter elements through recognition of CACCC motifs and related GC-rich regions (15Funnell A.P.

We examined the sequence between −60 and +20 bp relative to the Lgals3 transcription start site and observed several KLF3 consensus binding sites (16Crossley M. Whitelaw E. Perkins A. Williams G.

To assess whether KLF3 could bind these sites in vitro, we prepared DNA probes corresponding to these motifs and evaluated direct protein binding by EMSA (Fig. 3B). KLF3 bound to each probe with the addition of an anti-KLF3 antibody, resulting in a supershift confirming the identity of probe-bound KLF3. The probes centered around −5 bp (Gal-3A) and −46 bp (Gal-3C) from the transcription start site displayed the most robust binding, suggesting that concurrent binding and dimerization of two KLF3 molecules at the promoter may occur given the spacing between these motifs, as has been postulated previously for other KLF3 target genes (14Eaton S.A.

The middle site at −20 bp (Gal-3B) showed weaker binding.

GSE44748). Three significant peak clusters were identified: 19 kb upstream of the transcription start site (site i), at the proximal promoter (site ii), and in the first intron (site iii) (Fig. 3C). These three prominent sites represent potential regulatory elements that are both accessible (as denoted by DNase-seq) and/or marked by active histone signatures (histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation and histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation) in fibroblasts. We also validated the ChIP-seq result with ChIP experiments followed by quantitative real-time PCR. Chromatin from wild-type and Klf3−/− MEFs was immunoprecipitated with an anti-KLF3 antibody and subjected to amplification using primers targeted to the −19 kb promoter and intron 1 ChIP-Seq peaks (sites i—iii, respectively) from Fig. 3C. Previously confirmed KLF3 binding sites at the Fam132a promoter and the Klf8 promoter 1a were used as positive control loci, whereas primers targeting regions 30 kb downstream and 4.5 kb upstream of Klf8 promoter 1a served as negative control regions A and B, respectively (14Eaton S.A.

Hepatocytes are often the target of viral infection and are easily injured by inflammatory insults. Here we sought to establish the pathways involved in the production of type I interferons (IFN-I) in response to extracellular poly(I:C), a dsRNA mimetic, in hepatocytes. This was of interest because hepatocytes are long-lived and, unlike most immune cells that readily die after activation with dsRNA, are not viewed as cells with robust antimicrobial capacity. We found that poly(I:C) leads to rapid up-regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), and Src. The production of IFN-β was dependent on iNOS, PKR, and Src and partially dependent on TLR3/Trif. iNOS and Src up-regulation was partially dependent on TLR3/Trif but entirely dependent on PKR. The phosphorylation of TLR3 on tyrosine 759 was shown to increase in parallel to IFN-β production in an iNOS- and Src-dependent manner, and Src was found to directly interact with TLR3 in the endosomal compartment of poly(I:C)-treated cells. Furthermore, we identified a robust NO/cGMP/PKG-dependent feedforward pathway for the amplification of iNOS expression.

Immunol. 2014; 193: 3436-3445Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). IFN-I includes the IFN-α family and IFN-β, which exert a vast spectrum of biological functions. One of the well characterized functions is inhibition of the replication of viruses (7.Hsieh M.Y. Chang M.Y. Chen Y.J. Li Y.K. Chuang T.H. Yu G.Y. Cheung C.H. Chen H.C. Maa M.C. Leu T.H.

Transplant. 2012; 12: 1730-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Toll-like receptors recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns and elicit proinflammatory signals, which lead to the activation of immune responses (9.Moore T.C.

For example, TLR3 recognizes double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and its analog poly(I:C) and induces the expression of antiviral genes and production of NO via the inducible NO synthase (iNOS, NO2) (9.Moore T.C.

Phosphorylation of five tyrosine residues on TLR3 at Tyr733, Tyr756, Tyr759, Tyr764, and Tyr858 has been shown to participate in dsRNA-induced gene expression (12.Sarkar S.N. Smith H.L. Rowe T.M.

In macrophages, dsRNA induces TLR3 Tyr759 phosphorylation to promote IFN-β secretion that is dependent on the up-regulation of iNOS, which activates Src (7.Hsieh M.Y. Chang M.Y. Chen Y.J. Li Y.K.

ADAR1 suppresses the activation of cytosolic RNA-sensing signaling pathways to protect the liver from ischemia/reperfusion injury.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 20248Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Here we sought to define the relationship between the iNOS/cGMP/PKG, Src/TLR3/Trif, and PKR pathways in the hepatocyte response to dsRNA. We show that IFN-β production in response to poly(I:C) is entirely iNOS-dependent and that NO exerts a feedforward up-regulation on iNOS expression in a cGMP/PKG-dependent manner. iNOS/NO promotes TLR3 Tyr759 phosphorylation through an Src-dependent mechanism associated with a direct interaction of Src with TLR3 localized to the endosomal compartment. Both iNOS and Src are markedly up-regulated in a PKR-dependent mechanism that itself is dramatically induced in response to poly(I:C). TLR3 signaling through Trif synergistically interacts with PKR to up-regulate iNOS expression upon dsRNA stimulation. These findings demonstrate a robust production of IFN-I in hepatocytes exposed to dsRNA through synergistic signaling pathways dependent on iNOS/NO. Low molecular weight poly(I:C) (poly(I:C)LMW, 0.2–1 kb), high molecular weight poly(I:C) (poly(I:C)HMW, 1.5–8 kb), and ultrapure LPS (Escherichia coli 0111:B4) were purchased from InvivoGen (San Diego, CA).

The purity exceeded 99% as measured by flow cytometric assay, and viability was typically measured over 85% using trypan blue exclusion. Hepatocytes (1.5 × 105 cells/ml) were plated on gelatin-coated culture plates or seeded onto coverslips precoated with collagen I (BD Biosciences) in Williams' medium E with 10% calf serum, 15 mm HEPES,10−6 m insulin, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin. Hepatocytes were allowed to attach to plates overnight. Prior to treatments, cell culture medium was changed to medium containing 5% calf serum. After washing with PBS, hepatocytes were treated with 20 μg/ml poly(I:C) for stimulation for various durations. Culture medium and cell pellets were collected for further analysis. The Src siRNA and PKR siRNA were transiently transfected into hepatocytes using GeneJammer transfection reagent according to the instructions of the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty-four hours later, hepatocytes were stimulated with 20 μg/ml poly(I:C) for various durations. Culture medium and cell lysates collected at different time points were subject to Western blotting analysis. For hepatocytes transfected with PKGIβ siRNA, cells were treated with cytokines after washing with PBS and replenishment with complete William's E medium. Cells were harvested for detection of iNOS and NF-κB activity. Hepatocytes were pretreated with 50 nm Src kinase inhibitor or 250 nm imidazolo-oxindole PKR inhibitor C16 for 2 h after PBS washing. Media containing inhibitor and 20 μg/ml poly(I:C) were replenished after removing the media. Culture medium and cell lysates collected at various durations were subject to further analysis. Adenoviral vectors carrying bacterial β-galactosidase (Ad-LacZ) and iNOS (Ad-iNOS) were prepared as described previously (25.Shears L.L. Kawaharada N. Tzeng E. Billiar T.R. Watkins S.C. Kovesdi I.

After overnight culture, hepatocytes were washed twice with PBS prior to infection at a multiplicity of infection of 3 in a volume of 1.5 ml of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies) using 6-well plates. Following a 2-h infection, the normal culture medium was changed for an incubation of 24 h. Cells were treated as designated in the figure legends. Samples were prepared at the indicated time points. Hepatocytes were washed twice in PBS and harvested with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) on ice for 10 min. The supernatants were collected as whole cell extracts after centrifugation at 12,000 g for 30 min. The lysates from culture media were concentrated by adding less lysis buffer after centrifugation to remove the medium. The nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (26.Méndez J. Stillman B. Chromatin association of human origin recognition complex, cdc6, and minichromosome maintenance proteins during the cell cycle: assembly of prereplication complexes in late mitosis.Mol.

The protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). The levels of nitrite (NO2−) in culture supernatants and cell lysates were assessed to determine the amount of NO production according to the instructions of the Griess reagent system (G2930, Promega). IFN-β levels in culture supernatants and cell lysates were detected using the IFN-β ELISA kit (R&D Systems) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Equal amounts of protein lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, followed by incubation with optimized dilutions of primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight. After washing, the membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h. Proteins were detected with the ECL kit (Pierce). β-Actin, β-tubulin (Sigma), or proliferating cell nuclear antigen was used as a loading control. For co-immunoprecipitation, equal amounts of whole cell lysates were incubated with equal amounts of primary antibody rotating at 4 °C overnight, and immune complexes were then precipitated with protein A/G-agarose beads after rotating for 2 h at 4 °C. Electrophoresis loading buffer was added to the beads after washing with wash buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 1× protein inhibitor mixture) five times. After denaturing at 95 °C for 5 min, the supernatants were subjected to Western blotting. Hepatocytes grown on coverslips were briefly washed in PBS and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min and stained as described previously (28.Eum H.A. Vallabhaneni R. Wang Y. Loughran P.A. Stolz D.B. Billiar T.R. Characterization of DISC formation and TNFR1 translocation to mitochondria in TNF-α-treated hepatocytes.Am. J.

Hepatocytes were incubated with 2% BSA in PBS for 1 h, followed by five washes with PBS + 0.5% BSA (PBB). The samples were then incubated with antibodies diluted in PBB against iNOS, Src, and Tyr(P)759-TLR3 and organelle-specific markers, including Rab5 (an early endosome marker) and Rab7 (a late endosome marker) as described above. Samples were washed five times with PBB, followed by incubation in the appropriate Alexa Fluor 488 (1:500, Invitrogen) and Cy3 (1:1000, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) secondary antibodies diluted in PBB. Samples were washed three times with PBB, followed by a single wash with PBS before 30 s of incubation with Hoechst nuclear stain. The nuclear stain was removed, and samples were washed with PBS before covering the coverslip with Gelvatol (23 g of poly(vinyl alcohol 2000), 50 ml of glycerol, and 0.1% sodium azide to 100 ml of PBS). Positively stained cells in six random fields were imaged on a FluoView 1000 confocal scanning microscope (Olympus, Center Valley, PA). Imaging conditions were maintained at identical settings within each antibody labeling experiment, with original gating performed using the negative control. Total RNAs were extracted from hepatocytes using the RNeasy extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The quality of the RNA was assessed by 1% denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis and spectrophotometry. One microgram of total RNAs of each sample was reverse-transcribed to the first strand of cDNA with oligo(dT)12–18 primers by the OmniscriptTM reverse transcriptase kit (Qiagen). Real-time PCR using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) was performed using forward and reverse primer pairs prevalidated and specific for iNOS, β-actin, and PKG (Qiagen). All samples were run in triplicates. The expression of the housekeeping gene β-actin was used as an internal control. For cell fractionation procedures, protease inhibitors (0.2 mg/ml Pefabloc, 0.01 mg/ml aprotinin, 0.01 mg/ml pepstatin, and 0.01 mg/ml leupeptin) were supplemented to all buffers. Briefly, cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS and harvested in buffer A (10 mm HEPES, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and then incubated on ice for 10 min. Nuclei were pelleted at 5000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended in buffer A and washed twice. The pellets after the final wash were collected as nuclear extract and lysed in C+D buffer (20 mm HEPES, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.45 m KCl, 0.02 mm EDTA, and 25% Glycerol) for 1 h on ice. The supernatants were collected at 15,000 × g for 15 min and classified as the nuclear fraction. Equal amounts of nuclear extracts were incubated with 32P end-labeled, 45-mer, double-stranded NF-κB oligonucleotide for 30 min at room temperature. The DNA-protein complexes were separated from free oligonucleotide on 6.5% native polyacrylamide gels. Radioactivity in the gel was exposed to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY). The mouse iNOS promoter-reporter plasmid (mouseiNOS (1.7) Luc) and the mouse iNOS promoter NF-кB specific mutant site-reporter plasmid (mouseiNOS-NF-кB Luc), which harbors 1.7 kb of upstream 5′-flanking DNA linked to the luciferase reporter gene, were constructed. Cells were transfected in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies) containing 1 μg of DNA and 10 μl of liposomes for 6 h. After washing with PBS, the cells were replenished with complete William's E medium. To control the transfection efficiency between groups, 0.2 μg of Renilla vector-pGL4.75 (hRluc/CMV) (Promega) was added to each well. Cells were treated with SNAP (100 μm), 8-pCPTcGMP (800 μm), and SNAP + 8-pCPTcGMP for 8 h. After treatment, cells were harvested and lysed in passive lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was detected with 20 μl of lysate in a Synergy Mx multimode reader (Biotek, Winooski, VT) using the Dual-Luciferase® reporter assay kit (Promega). Luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla activity. Each experiment was performed at least three times. The results were analyzed using analysis of variance in SigmaStat (Systat Software, San Jose, CA). Unless indicated, the results from a representative triplicate experiment are presented. Data are shown as mean ± S.D. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Here we show that hepatocytes exposed to high (Fig. 1A) or low (supplemental Fig. S1) molecular weight preparations of the dsRNA mimic poly(I:C) exhibited a time-dependent increase in phosphorylation of TLR3-Tyr759 (Fig. 1A). TLR3-Tyr(P)759 first appeared at 2 h and continued to increase to the 24-h time point. In parallel, iNOS expression and NO production (measured as nitrite accumulation in the medium) increased (Fig. 1, A and B). The enhanced expression of iNOS and TLR3-Tyr(P)759 was also associated with increased PKR and Src expression as well as the appearance of the known Src phosphorylation target FAK-Tyr(P)861 (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, the levels of transcription factors known to be downstream of TLR3 signaling and involved in IFN-I production, including IRF3 and IRF7, increased in both the whole cell lysates and nuclear extracts in poly(I:C)-treated cells, whereas IR"

Although helicases encoded by positive-strand RNA viruses are necessary for RNA genome replication, their functions are not well understood. We determined structures of the hepatitis C virus helicase (NS3h) in complex with the transition state ATP mimic ADP·AlF4− and compared them with the previous nucleic acid-associated ternary complexes. The results suggested that nucleic acid binding promotes a structural change of the spring helix at the transition state, optimizing the interaction network centered on the nucleophilic water. Analysis of ATP hydrolysis with and without conformational restraints on the spring helix further supported the importance of its action for both nucleic acid-stimulated and basal catalysis. We further found that an F238P substitution, predicted to destabilize the helix, diminished viral RNA replication without significantly affecting ATP-dependent duplex unwinding. The stability of the secondary structure, thus, seems critical for additional functions of NS3h. Taken together, the results suggest that the spring helix may be central to the coordination of multiple modes of NS3h action. Further characterization centered on this element may help understand the molecular details of how the viral helicase facilitates RNA replication.

Helicases are vital enzymes that perform highly diverse functions in important biological processes (1Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V.

They are ubiquitous in cellular organisms and are also found in many viral proteomes (1Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Helicases: amino acid sequence comparisons and structure function relationships.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 419-429Crossref Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). Those encoded by positive-strand RNA viruses, many of which are medically important pathogens, are believed to function at different stages of virus life cycles (3Kadaré G. Haenni A.L. Virus-encoded RNA helicases.J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2583-2590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of several viral helicases have indeed implicated a convergent theme regarding their potential roles in the action of replicase complexes for genomic RNA replication, such as initial recruitment of replication templates, and synthesis of negative-strand RNA intermediates and positive-strand RNA genomes (4Ahola T. den Boon J.A.

Although the enzymatic activities of the viral helicases are somewhat similar to those of replicative DNA helicases, which are well known to processively unwind DNA duplexes for genome replication by utilizing ATP, the details of how the viral enzymes participate in the assembly and function of RNA replicase complexes remain mysterious. This has hampered our understanding of the mechanisms of positive-strand genomic RNA replication in general as well as the development of specific inhibitors targeting this class of important viral enzymes. Positive-strand RNA viruses in the Flaviviridae family, such as HCV 3The abbreviations used are: HCVhepatitis C virusSFsuperfamilyssDNAsingle-stranded DNABMDB1,4 bismaleimidyl-2,3-dihydroxybutaneNEMN-ethylmaleimideMGmalachite green hydrochlorideAMammonium molybdate tetrahydratePVApolyvinyl alcohol. and dengue virus, are responsible for widespread global infection with significant public health and economic impact (9Lindenbach B.D. Rice C.M. Molecular biology of flaviviruses.Adv. Virus Res. 2003; 59: 23-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). HCV chronically infects ∼3% of the world population, causing liver disease including cirrhosis and liver cancer (10Gower E. Estes C. Blach S. Razavi-Shearer K. Razavi H.

The virus encodes a superfamily (SF) 2 viral helicase in the C-terminal portion of the NS3 protein (11Morikawa K. Lange C.M. Gouttenoire J. Meylan E. Brass V. Penin F. Moradpour D. Nonstructural protein 3–4A: the Swiss army knife of hepatitis C virus.J. Viral. Hepat. 2011; 18: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Its enzymatic activity is important for the virus life cycle, as mutations engineered in motif II, the central element for metal ion binding and (d)NTP hydrolysis, prevented detectable virus replication in vivo (12Kolykhalov A.A. Mihalik K. Feinstone S.M. Rice C.M. Hepatitis C virus-encoded enzymatic activities and conserved RNA elements in the 3′ nontranslated region are essential for virus replication in vivo.J.

Frick D.N. Hepatitis C virus subgenomic replicon requires an active NS3 RNA helicase.J. Virol. 2006; 80: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In addition, the importance of NS3h in the HCV lifecycle has also been demonstrated by mutagenesis of residues with no known roles in enzymatic activity. For example, alteration of residues involved in forming contacts in crystals reduced viral RNA replication (14Mackintosh S.G. Lu J.Z. Jordan J.B. Harrison M.K. Sikora B. Sharma S.D. Cameron C.E.

In vitro, HCV NS3h can unwind both DNA and RNA duplexes, and the mechanism of its motion has been broadly characterized. Nucleotide triphosphates, (d)NTPs, bind between the two NS3h RecA-like domains to trigger closure of the two domains (19Appleby T.C. Anderson R. Fedorova O. Pyle A.M. Wang R. Liu X. Brendza K.M.

However, no study until the present one has compared transition-state mimic-captured enzymes in the presence and absence of nucleic acids. Such a comparison could provide new insight into a critical step along the reaction pathway and help clarify the mechanistic details of nucleic acid-stimulated catalysis. HCV NS3h contains a spring α-helix in RecA-like domain 1. This structural element is predicted in helicases encoded by HCV-like non-primate hepaciviruses as well as the more distantly related pegiviruses and pestiviruses, suggesting conservation of an important replicative function (20Gu M.

We have found that the HCV NS3h spring helix has to be structurally flexible for catalysis, and meanwhile the α-helical form of this element is important for virus replication. We think the spring helix probably plays a central role in coordinating multiple modes of NS3 action. Our results justify further investigation on NS3h to understand the molecular details of viral RNA replication and aid discovery of potent and selective viral helicase inhibitors that has thus far proven challenging. DNA- or RNA-stimulated nucleotide hydrolysis is a general feature of most active helicases (2Singleton M.R. Dillingham M.S. Wigley D.B. Structure and mechanism of helicases and nucleic acid translocases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 23-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). In order to interrogate the molecular basis of HCV NS3h-catalyzed nucleic acid-dependent (d)NTP hydrolysis, we performed the first structural comparison of transition-state mimic-captured NS3h complexes in the presence and absence of nucleic acids. We crystallized binary complexes containing NS3h and transition-state ATP mimics (ADP·AlF4−), allowing comparison to the previously determined ternary complex structures that included NS3h and ATP mimics as well as nucleic acids (20Gu M. Rice C.M. Three conformational snapshots of the hepatitis C virus NS3 helicase reveal a ratchet translocation mechanism.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 521-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Two complex structures were determined at 2.1 Å resolution from a single crystallographic asymmetric unit (Table 1). The two binary NS3h-ADP·AlF4− complexes are similar to each other despite small differences in conformation (root mean square deviation ∼0.84 Å for all the NS3h atoms). Complex A is better ordered than complex B in the crystal, as its electron density (simulated annealing composite omit map) exhibits more pronounced structural features; different parts of the structure, especially those in domain 1, are better ordered with lower temperature factors (Fig. 1). We analyzed both binary complexes to reveal the structural impact of the lack of nucleic acids.TABLE 1Crystallographic data and refinement statisticsComplexNS3h-ADP·AlF4−PDB ID5E4FData collectionSourceNSLS X26CWavelength (Å)1.0809Resolution (Å)50-2.1 (2.18-2.1)Space groupP21Unit cella, b, c (Å)95.5, 46.1, 109.1α, β, γ (°)90, 104, 90Observations262,634 (16582)Unique reflections53,280 (5056)Redundancy4.9 (3.1)Completeness (%)98.1 (94.9)Mean I/σI17.3 (5.6)Rmerge on IaRmerge = ΣhklΣi|I(hkl)i − 〈I(hkl)〉|/ΣhklΣi〈I(hkl)i〉.0.05 (0.23)Cut-off criteria I/σI−0.5Refinement statisticsResolution limits (Å)50-2.1 (2.23-2.1)Number of reflections51,003 (7,087)Completeness (%)93.7 (83.5)Cut-off criteria I/σI0Number of atomsProtein6,505Ligand66Solvent498RcrystbRcryst = Σhkl|Fo(hkl) − Fc(hkl)|/Σhkl|Fo(hkl)|, where Fo and Fc are the observed and calculated structure factors, respectively.0.214 (0.254)Rfree (5% of data)0.252 (0.306)Bonds (Å)/angles (°)cValues indicate root mean square deviations in bond lengths and bond angles.0.006/1.2Mean B value (Å2)25.6Complex A19.5Complex B31.0Coordinate error (Å)dEstimated coordinate error from cross-validated Luzzati Plot.0.26a Rmerge = ΣhklΣi|I(hkl)i − 〈I(hkl)〉|/ΣhklΣi〈I(hkl)i〉.b Rcryst = Σhkl|Fo(hkl) − Fc(hkl)|/Σhkl|Fo(hkl)|, where Fo and Fc are the observed and calculated structure factors, respectively.c Values indicate root mean square deviations in bond lengths and bond angles.d Estimated coordinate error from cross-validated Luzzati Plot. Open table in a new tab Structural alignment of complex A and the NS3h-ADP·BeF3-ssDNA ground-state complex revealed that the NS3h structures are largely superimposable, except that the Glu-291 residue in motif II adopts different rotamers in the two structures (Figs. 2, A and C, and 3, A–C). Comparison of complex A and the NS3h-ADP·AlF4−-ssDNA transition-state structure revealed that domains 1 and 3 are arranged in different conformations (Fig. 2B). The structural change of the spring helix and shift of the motif II loop can only be crystallographically captured in the ternary complex with ssDNA (Fig. 2, C and D). This suggests that ssDNA binding facilitates adoption of an appropriate structural arrangement of NS3h as ATP hydrolysis proceeds to the transition state. Further structural analysis of the motif II loop revealed nucleic acid-dependent rotamer changes of the essential residues Asp-290, Glu-291, and His-293 (Figs. 2C and 3, A–C). This is presumably important for remodeling the (d)NTPase active site for catalysis.FIGURE 3Active-site arrangement with and without ssDNA.

To analyze the impact of nucleic acid enhanced transition-state mimic binding, ssDNA (dT12) was added. Fluorescence polarization values derived from single measurements were plotted against NS3h concentrations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We analyzed the arrangement of the (d)NTPase active site with and without ssDNA (Fig. 3, A–C). The coordination of the ADP·AlF4− moiety, magnesium ion, and most water molecules (W3, W4, and W5) does not significantly change upon ssDNA binding. The major differences are centered on the Glu-291 residue of motif II and the nucleophilic water (W1). In the presence of ssDNA, the Glu-291 residue is oriented to interact with His-293 (Nϵ) (Fig. 3, A and C). In this orientation, the two water molecules W1 and W5 approximately lie in the plane of the carboxylate group of Glu-291 (Fig. 3B). They are positioned in symmetry with respect to the Glu-291 carbonyl bond and, therefore, are able to form linear hydrogen bonds simultaneously with the carbonyl oxygen (Glu-291 Oϵ) (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, in the absence of ssDNA, Glu-291 is not properly positioned to establish the hydrogen bonding network. We then analyzed the atomic coordination on the W1 water molecule, which presumably acts as a nucleophilic water involved in pentacoordination of the transition-state planar γ-phosphate. In binary complex A without ssDNA, the distances (2.63 and 2.92 Å) between W1 and the two coordinating oxygen atoms (Oϵ of Glu-291 and Gln-460) are longer and ∼0.3 Å different, whereas those in the ternary transition-state complex are shorter and approximately equal (2.57 and 2.59 Å) (Fig. 3C). This suggests that in the nucleic acid-containing ternary complex, the nucleophilic water is coordinated by symmetric and stronger hydrogen bonds, which can appropriately orient the activated water toward the γ-phosphorus. The structural analysis predicted that transition-state mimics should bind to NS3h better in the presence of ssDNA. We, therefore, probed the binding of GDP (BODIPY FL-labeled) and AlF4− to NS3h by measuring fluorescence polarization, which increases when small fluorophores bind to macromolecules. In the presence of ssDNA, fluorescence polarization increased, and the estimated dissociation constant for GDP decreased >2-fold (∼94.6 μm to ∼39.1 μm), indicating enhancement of GDP·AlF4− formation in the (d)NTPase active site (Fig. 3D). Like complex A described above, complex B does not exhibit elongation in the spring helix, and its overall conformation is different from the transition state ternary complex (Fig. 2B). However, complex B is also slightly different from the ground state ternary complex (Fig. 2A). Although the central Glu-291 residue of complex B is not properly oriented to interact with His-293 and does not simultaneously form linear hydrogen bonds with W1 and W5, it is arranged in a better orientation than that of complex A (Fig. 3, A–C). In addition, the distances between W1 and two coordinating oxygen atoms approximate those in the transition state ternary complex and only exhibit a 0.13 Å difference, smaller than the difference seen in complex A (Fig. 3C). It is worth noting that complex B shows more thermal mobility, especially in domain 1 (Fig. 1, A and B). We speculate that complex B represents a snapshot of NS3h approximating to the transition state with optimal structural arrangements. In the absence of nucleic acids, this probably occurs at low frequency. To examine the importance of the structural transition of the spring helix, we conformationally restrained this structural element and analyzed the impact on ssDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis. We introduced cysteine-pair mutations within the spring helix (CC1 and CC2 mutants) as well as an irrelevant helix (CCi) and cross-linked the paired cysteines using 1,4 bismaleimidyl-2,3-dihydroxybutane (BMDB), a compound with two maleimides that can react with sulfhydryl groups of cysteine residues (Fig. 4, A and B). No native cysteine pairs seem to allow efficient cross-linking by BMDB. Although adding BMDB to the wild-type or CCi mutant protein did not change ssDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis, cross-linking the cysteine pairs in the CC1 and CC2 mutants significantly suppressed the activity (Fig. 4C, Table 2). The suppression was not observed when the individual cysteines in the CC1 and CC2 mutants were targeted by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), which contains a single maleimide group and thus did not cross-link cysteine pairs (Fig. 4, B and D, Table 2). The results suggest that covalent attachment of small molecules on the spring helix or other structural elements containing exposed cysteines does not significantly affect nucleic acid-coupled ATP hydrolysis, whereas the cross-linking-mediated conformational restraint on the spring helix strongly suppresses enzymatic activity. It is worth noting that the CC1 cross-linking covered the two helical turns responsible for elongation, whereas CC2 seemed to cover only one (Figs. 2D and 4A). This may explain the stronger suppression associated with the CC1 cross-linking (Fig. 4C, Table 2), although different cross-linking efficiencies cannot be ruled out.TABLE 2Kinetics of ATP hydrolysisEnzymesNucleic acid-stimulated ATPaseBasal ATPasekcataValues are maximum turnover rates (pmol ATP hydrolyzed/min/pmol of protein).KNAbValues are concentrations of dT12 (μm) at 50% of the maximum velocities.kcataValues are maximum turnover rates (pmol ATP hydrolyzed/min/pmol of protein).KATPcValues are concentrations of ATP (mm) at 50% of the maximum velocities.WT822.4 ± 51.147.4 ± 6.832.29 ± 4.600.14 ± 0.06WT+BMDB882.4 ± 99.365.2 ± 14.733.01 ± 5.350.11 ± 0.05CCi776.2 ± 51.955.1 ± 8.031.82 ± 4.710.13 ± 0.06CCi+BMDB794.1 ± 42.943.2 ± 5.632.99 ± 6.690.10 ± 0.05CC1683.7 ± 41.240.0 ± 6.032.11 ± 4.060.12 ± 0.05CC1+BMDB125.5 ± 17.173.9 ± 19.28.79 ± 0.410.80 ± 0.15CC2697.7 ± 69.642.9 ± 10.432.57 ± 6.470.11 ± 0.06CC2+BMDB268.5 ± 23.635.9 ± 8.313.73 ± 1.990.13 ± 0.06CC1615.0 ± 49.333.7 ± 7.3CC1+NEM556.7 ± 29.629.6 ± 4.5CC2627.3 ± 26.828.7 ± 3.5CC2+NEM678.3 ± 41.644.8 ± 6.5a Values are maximum turnover rates (pmol ATP hydrolyzed/min/pmol of protein).b Values are concentrations of dT12 (μm) at 50% of the maximum velocities.c Values are concentrations of ATP (mm) at 50% of the maximum velocities. Open table in a new tab As the transition state ATP mimic can bind in the (d)NTPase active site even in the absence of ssDNA, we wondered whether the suboptimal active site arrangement is sufficient for (d)NTP hydrolysis to proceed across the transition state barrier and also how the nucleic acid-independent “basal” (d)NTP hydrolysis occurs. We, therefore, analyzed ATP hydrolysis in the absence of ssDNA. When the cross-linking reagent BMDB was used to conformationally restrain the spring helix in the CC1 and CC2 mutants, the velocities of ATP hydrolysis dramatically decreased. In contrast, the addition of BMDB to the wild-type protein and CCi mutant did not change ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 4E). The Km value for the CC1 cross-linking was a little higher, allowing us to speculate a possible change of ATP association in the active site leading to the stronger suppression of the basal activity (Table 2). However, we think that data-fitting might deviate because of the weak data points derived from the extremely slow reactions at low concentrations of ATP. Overall, the results indicate that the basal ATPase activity is also dependent on the flexibility of the spring α-helix and the associated overall conformational change; it is likely, from inefficient autonomous structural transitions of NS3h in the absence of ssDNA. We think the complex B structure probably highlights an initial step of the probable basal transition. The results also suggest that the same structural change of the spring helix should occur when NS3h translocates along ssRNA, although a transition state structure with ssRNA has not yet been determined (details under “Discussion”). As the spring helix is a critical structural element for enzymatic activity, we tried to further characterize its role in NS3h function. We selected Phe-238 in the spring helix for mutagenesis analysis and assessment of virus replication capacity. This residue is located away from the (d)NTPase and nucleic acid binding sites. It is also partially embedded within the protein and should not be directly involved in potential surface contacts between NS3h and other factors (Fig. 5A). We mutated Phe-238 to an alanine, leucine, and proline in Jc1(p7-nsGluc2A), a replication competent reporter virus (29Marukian S. Andrus L. Sheahan T.P. Jones C.T. Charles E.D. Ploss A. Rice C.M.

After transfection of RNA transcripts into Huh-7.5 cells, virus replication was monitored by measuring luciferase activity in the culture medium. The Phe-238 side chain is not essential, as mutation of Phe-238 to alanine (F238A) did not affect virus replication, and the F238L mutation only slightly diminished replication and can be explained by"
https://openalex.org/W2406050178,"Phospho-MurNAc-pentapeptide translocase (MraY) catalyzes the synthesis of Lipid I, a bacterial peptidoglycan precursor. As such, MraY is essential for bacterial survival and therefore is an ideal target for developing novel antibiotics. However, the understanding of its catalytic mechanism, despite the recently determined crystal structure, remains limited. In the present study, the kinetic properties of Bacillus subtilis MraY (BsMraY) were investigated by fluorescence enhancement using dansylated UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide and heptaprenyl phosphate (C35-P, short-chain homolog of undecaprenyl phosphate, the endogenous substrate of MraY) as second substrate. Varying the concentrations of both of these substrates and fitting the kinetics data to two-substrate models showed that the concomitant binding of both UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide-DNS and C35-P to the enzyme is required before the release of the two products, Lipid I and UMP. We built a model of BsMraY and performed docking studies with the substrate C35-P to further deepen our understanding of how MraY accommodates this lipid substrate. Based on these modeling studies, a novel catalytic role was put forward for a fully conserved histidine residue in MraY (His-289 in BsMraY), which has been experimentally confirmed to be essential for MraY activity. Using the current model of BsMraY, we propose that a small conformational change is necessary to relocate the His-289 residue, such that the translocase reaction can proceed via a nucleophilic attack of the phosphate moiety of C35-P on bound UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide. Phospho-MurNAc-pentapeptide translocase (MraY) catalyzes the synthesis of Lipid I, a bacterial peptidoglycan precursor. As such, MraY is essential for bacterial survival and therefore is an ideal target for developing novel antibiotics. However, the understanding of its catalytic mechanism, despite the recently determined crystal structure, remains limited. In the present study, the kinetic properties of Bacillus subtilis MraY (BsMraY) were investigated by fluorescence enhancement using dansylated UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide and heptaprenyl phosphate (C35-P, short-chain homolog of undecaprenyl phosphate, the endogenous substrate of MraY) as second substrate.

Previous in vitro studies indicated that casein kinase 2 (CK2) mediated the phosphorylation of NS2, which regulated the propensity of NS2 to form larger aggregates. Using targeted pharmacological reagents, specific mutation in the viral genome by reverse genetics and confocal microscopy, here we demonstrate that CK2 activity is important for BTV replication. Furthermore, we show that a novel host cell factor, protein phosphatase 2A, is involved in NS2 dephosphorylation and that, together with CK2, it regulates VIB morphology and virus replication. Thus, these two host enzymes influence the dynamic nature of VIB assembly/disassembly, and these concerted activities may be relevant to the assembly and the release of these cores from VIBs.

Deletion of Pfk2p alters glucose-dependent V-ATPase reassembly and vacuolar acidification (Chan, C. Y., and Parra, K. J. (2014) Yeast phosphofructokinase-1 subunit Pfk2p is necessary for pH homeostasis and glucose-dependent vacuolar ATPase reassembly. J. Biol. Chem. 289, 19448–19457). This study capitalized on the mechanisms suppressing vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) in pfk2Δ to gain new knowledge of the mechanisms underlying glucose-dependent V-ATPase regulation. Because V-ATPase is fully assembled in pfk2Δ, and glycolysis partially suppressed at steady state, we manipulated glycolysis and assessed its direct involvement on V-ATPase function. At steady state, the ratio of proton transport to ATP hydrolysis increased 24% after increasing the glucose concentration from 2% to 4% to enhance the glycolysis flow in pfk2Δ. Tighter coupling restored vacuolar pH when glucose was abundant and glycolysis operated below capacity. After readdition of glucose to glucose-deprived cells, glucose-dependent V1Vo reassembly was proportional to the glycolysis flow. Readdition of 2% glucose to pfk2Δ cells, which restored 62% of ethanol concentration, led to equivalent 60% V1Vo reassembly levels. Steady-state level of assembly (100% reassembly) was reached at 4% glucose when glycolysis reached a threshold in pfk2Δ (≥40% the wild-type flow). At 4% glucose, the level of Pfk1p co-immunoprecipitated with V-ATPase decreased 58% in pfk2Δ, suggesting that Pfk1p binding to V-ATPase may be inhibitory in the mutant. We concluded that V-ATPase activity at steady state and V-ATPase reassembly after readdition of glucose to glucose-deprived cells are controlled by the glycolysis flow. We propose a new mechanism by which glucose regulates V-ATPase catalytic activity that occurs at steady state without changing V1Vo assembly.

V-ATPase consists of two multisubunit domains, V1 and Vo, that are responsible for ATP hydrolysis and proton transport, respectively (8Muench S.P. Trinick J.

Peripheral subunits form V1, the catalytic domain attached to the cytosolic side of the membrane. V1 is bound to Vo, the integral membrane domain that forms the path for proton transport. During catalysis, ATP hydrolysis within V1 drives active transport of protons from the cytosol to the other side of the membrane via rotation of a proteolipid ring structure in Vo. Detachment of V1 from Vo is an important mechanism that inhibits V-ATPase proton transport (3Parra K.J. Chan C.Y. Chen J.

Disassembly of the yeast V1Vo complex occurs when glucose is not available. Upon glucose depletion, V1 subunit C is released into the cytoplasm, causing the rest of the V1 domain to dissociate from Vo (10Kane P.M.

Disassembly completely inactivates V-ATPase pumps because V1 without Vo cannot hydrolyze ATP, and Vo without V1 cannot transport protons (2Kane P.M. The where, when, and how of organelle acidification by the yeast vacuolar H+-ATPase.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 177-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Consequently, protons cannot not be redistributed from the cytosol into the vacuole, which alkalinizes the vacuolar lumen and acidifies the cytosol (19Kane P.M.

Presumably yeast V1Vo disassembly preserves energy when glucose, the main energy source, is limited. This hypothesis is supported indirectly by observations that rapidly fermentable carbon sources like glucose, mannose, and fructose trigger reassembly (21Parra K.J. Kane P.M. Reversible association between the V1 and V0 domains of yeast vacuolar H+-ATPase is an unconventional glucose-induced effect.Mol. Cell.

Additional evidence suggesting that reassembly correlates with glycolysis comes from studies using the nonmetabolizable glucose analogue 2-deoxyglucose, which cannot substitute for glucose in triggering reassembly (21Parra K.J.

The crystal structures of eukaryotic phosphofructokinases from baker's yeast and rabbit skeletal muscle.J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 407: 284-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Because each subunit has catalytic and regulatory functions, yeast cells can form partially active homomeric complexes upon deletion of one PFK-1 structural gene (27Heinisch J. Construction and physiological characterization of mutants disrupted in the phosphofructokinase genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Curr. Genet. 1986; 11: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The PFK-1 single deletion mutants pfk1Δ and pfk2Δ metabolize glucose (27Heinisch J. Construction and physiological characterization of mutants disrupted in the phosphofructokinase genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Curr. Genet. 1986; 11: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), although at a more reduced rate than wild-type cells. Glycolysis is more severely reduced in pfk2Δ than pfk1Δ cells (27Heinisch J. Construction and physiological characterization of mutants disrupted in the phosphofructokinase genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Curr. Genet. 1986; 11: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), indicating that the subunits do not contribute equally to PFK-1 complex activity. In pfk2Δ cells, the concentration of fructose 1,6-biphosphate, the PFK-1 reaction product, is 5- to 7.5-fold lower than what is found in pfk1Δ cells. Accordingly, pfk2Δ exhibits reduced downstream glycolytic intermediates, glucose consumption, and ethanol production (27Heinisch J. Construction and physiological characterization of mutants disrupted in the phosphofructokinase genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Curr. Genet. 1986; 11: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 28Arvanitidis A. Heinisch J.J. Studies on the function of yeast phosphofructokinase subunits by in vitro mutagenesis.J. Biol.

Genet. 1986; 202: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The fact that pfk2Δ does not have detectable glycolytic oscillations (30Schrøder T.D. Özalp V.C. Lunding A. Jernshøj K.D. Olsen L.F. An experimental study of the regulation of glycolytic oscillations in yeast.FEBS J. 2013; 280: 6033-6044Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) indicates that glycolysis self-regulatory functions are defective in this strain. V-ATPase function is defective in both PFK-1 deletion mutants, but it is more severely impaired in pfk2Δ (24Chan C.Y. Parra K.J. Yeast phosphofructokinase-1 subunit Pfk2p is necessary for pH homeostasis and glucose-dependent vacuolar ATPase reassembly.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 19448-19457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Glucose-dependent V1Vo reassembly is normal in pfk1Δ, but it is reduced by 40–50% in pfk2Δ. In addition, V-ATPase proton transport is partially suppressed at steady state. The cells have alkalinized vacuoles and display pH and calcium growth sensitivity, which is characteristic of yeast cells with partially defective V-ATPase activity. The mechanisms by which V-ATPase is suppressed in pfk2Δ cells are elusive. Subunit Pfk1p may regulate V-ATPase through its interaction with V1Vo in the pfk2Δ mutant. In addition, a reduction in PFK-1 function and the glycolysis flow may inhibit V-ATPase in pfk2Δ cells. We have now investigated the interrelation between glycolysis and V-ATPase function to gain new knowledge of the mechanisms underlying glucose-dependent V-ATPase regulation. After readdition of glucose to glucose-deprived cells, V1Vo reassembly is proportional to the glycolysis flow until pfk2Δ reaches a metabolic threshold necessary to complete V1Vo reassembly. At steady state, V-ATPase also communicates with the glycolysis flow. This communication modulates proton transport to restore pH homeostasis when glucose is abundant in pfk2Δ. This is a new mechanism by which glucose regulates V-ATPase. It occurs at steady state and does not involve disassembly/reassembly. To test the hypothesis that V-ATPase function is adjusted in response to changes in the glycolysis flow, we manipulated glycolysis in pfk2Δ cells and measured V-ATPase functions. First, we measured PFK-1 activity in pfk2Δ cells to determine the extent of PFK-1 inhibition. As shown in Fig. 1A, pfk2Δ cells only express subunit Pfk1p. The enzymatic activity of PFK-1 was 42% lower in pfk2Δ than wild-type cells. This result is consistent with previous reports indicating that PFK-1 homomeric complexes consisting of subunit α (pfk2Δ cells) are less active than wild-type native PFK-1 hetero-octameric complexes (α4β4) (27Heinisch J. Construction and physiological characterization of mutants disrupted in the phosphofructokinase genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Curr. Genet. 1986; 11: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In yeast, the final product of glycolysis, pyruvate, is fermented into ethanol, the levels of which were measured in both strains at steady state (Fig. 1B). In the presence of 2% glucose, which is the standard glucose concentration in yeast growth medium, the ethanol concentration was observed to be 6.6 ± 0.9 mm and 3.8 ± 0.2 mm in the wild-type and pfk2Δ strains, respectively. This result indicates that glycolysis was defective in pfk2Δ. The 42% ethanol concentration reduction is consistent with the 42% reduction of PFK-1 activity measured in pfk2Δ cells and with independent studies that reported reduced fructose-1,6-biphosphate, the 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase reaction product (27Heinisch J.

Yeast phosphofructokinase-1 subunit Pfk2p is necessary for pH homeostasis and glucose-dependent vacuolar ATPase reassembly.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 19448-19457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) in pfk2Δ cells were conducted in 2% glucose. Although 2% glucose is optimal for wild-type cells, it might not be optimal for PFK-1 mutants. We reasoned that the pfk2Δ glycolytic mutant would require larger concentrations of glucose to maintain a substantial glycolytic flow. The pfk2Δ cells were grown in medium containing 2% or 4% glucose, and the ethanol concentration was compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 1B). Although lower ethanol levels were detected in 2% glucose, the ethanol concentration increased in 4% glucose in pfk2Δ cells. It reached 83% of the ethanol concentration in the wild-type cells, indicating that glycolysis was stimulated. Because the vacuolar pH is regulated by V-ATPase, vacuolar alkalization is a direct consequence of inhibiting V-ATPase activity. The effects of stimulating glycolysis on V-ATPase proton transport were determined by measuring the vacuolar pH in vivo. We used the pH-sensitive fluorophore BCECF, which accumulates in yeast vacuoles. The cells were loaded with BCECF-AM, and the pH was measured fluorometrically according to standard calibration curves (20Martínez-Muñoz G.A. Kane P.

The vacuolar pH was measured in wild-type cells and pfk2Δ after growing the cells in 2% versus 4% glucose. vma3Δ cells were used as a control because vma3Δ completely lacks V-ATPase function (32Ohya Y. Umemoto N. Tanida I. Ohta A. Iida H. Anraku Y. Calcium-sensitive cls mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae showing a Pet- phenotype are ascribable to defects of vacuolar membrane H+-ATPase activity.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13971-13977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In wild-type cells, where the V-ATPase pumps are fully active, the vacuolar lumen was acidic (pH = 5.2–5.9) at both glucose concentrations (Fig. 2A). In 2% glucose, the pfk2Δ vacuoles were alkalinized (pH 6.6), similar to the inactive V-ATPase mutant vma3Δ (pH 6.8). In 4% glucose, the acidic pH of the vacuoles was rescued. The pfk2Δ vacuolar lumen pH in 4% glucose (pH 5.8) was almost identical to the wild-type vacuolar lumen pH in 2% glucose (pH 5.9). These results show that stimulation of glycolysis with 4% glucose stimulated V-ATPase proton transport in pfk2Δ cells at steady state. Thus, they indicate that V-ATPase proton transport is coupled to the flow of glycolysis at steady state. Sensitivity to elevated pH and calcium at all temperatures is a signature of mutants that lack all V-ATPase activity (vacuolar and Golgi V-ATPase). It is known as the Vma− (vacuolar membrane ATPase) growth phenotype (33Kane P.M. The long physiological reach of the yeast vacuolar H+-ATPase.J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2007; 39: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and is only shown when over ∼70% of V-ATPase function is compromised (34Liu J. Kane P.M.

The vma mutants grow at pH 5.0, but growth is reduced or abolished at neutral pH in the presence of high concentrations of calcium (32Ohya Y. Umemoto N. Tanida I. Ohta A. Iida H. Anraku Y.

It is known that mouse ESCs are dynamic heterogeneous populations. However, it remains largely unclear whether and how EpiSCs possess heterogeneity and plasticity similar to that of ESCs. Here, we show that EpiSCs are discriminated by the expression of a specific marker T (Brachyury) into two populations.

In addition, the two populations display distinct responses to bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling and different developmental potentials. The T− EpiSCs are preferentially differentiated into ectoderm lineages, whereas T+ EpiSCs have a biased potential for mesendoderm fates. Mechanistic studies reveal that T+ EpiSCs have an earlier and faster response to BMP4 stimulation than T− EpiSCs. Id1 mediates the commitment of T− EpiSCs to epidermal lineage during BMP4 treatment. On the other hand, Snail modulates the conversion of T+ EpiSCs to mesendoderm fates with the presence of BMP4. Furthermore, T expression is essential for epithelial-mesenchymal transition during EpiSCs differentiation.

https://openalex.org/W2402716541,"RAS-like protein expressed in many tissues 1 (RIT1) is a disease-associated RAS subfamily small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase). Recent studies revealed that germ-line and somatic RIT1 mutations can cause Noonan syndrome (NS), and drive proliferation of lung adenocarcinomas, respectively, akin to RAS mutations in these diseases. However, the locations of these RIT1 mutations differ significantly from those found in RAS, and do not affect the three mutational “hot spots” of RAS. Moreover, few studies have characterized the GTPase cycle of RIT1 and its disease-associated mutants. Here we developed a real-time NMR-based GTPase assay for RIT1 and investigated the effect of disease-associated mutations on GTPase cycle. RIT1 exhibits an intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rate similar to that of H-RAS, but its intrinsic nucleotide exchange rate is ∼4-fold faster, likely as a result of divergent residues near the nucleotide binding site. All of the disease-associated mutations investigated increased the GTP-loaded, activated state of RIT1 in vitro, but they could be classified into two groups with different intrinsic GTPase properties. The S35T, A57G, and Y89H mutants exhibited more rapid nucleotide exchange, whereas F82V and T83P impaired GTP hydrolysis. A RAS-binding domain pulldown assay indicated that RIT1 A57G and Y89H were highly activated in HEK293T cells, whereas T83P and F82V exhibited more modest activation. All five mutations are associated with NS, whereas two (A57G and F82V) have also been identified in urinary tract cancers and myeloid malignancies.

Small GTPase proteins regulate signal transduction through a conserved “switch” mechanism (1Cherfils J. Zeghouf M. Regulation of small GTPases by GEFs, GAPs, and GDIs.Physiol. Rev. 2013; 93: 269-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). The GTP-bound state of these proteins adopts an activated conformation that can bind to and activate downstream effector proteins, thus driving signal transduction. Hydrolysis of GTP to GDP then terminates the signaling event (Fig. 1A). GTPase proteins have the ability to hydrolyze GTP (intrinsic hydrolysis), and to become reactivated by releasing GDP and binding a new molecule of GTP (intrinsic exchange), although both of these processes occur slowly. Most GTPases can be rapidly inactivated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), 6The abbreviations used are: GAPGTPase-activating proteinsRIT1RAS-like protein expressed in many tissuesGEFguanine nucleotide exchange factorsRBDRAS-binding domainHSQCheteronuclear single-quantum coherenceNSNoonan syndromeGTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphateGMP-PNPguanosine 5′-[β,γ-imido]triphosphate. which catalyze nucleotide hydrolysis, whereas guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) promote their reactivation by accelerating the exchange of GDP for GTP. Mutations in small GTPases or their GAPs and GEFs can disrupt this GTPase cycle and result in diseases such as cancer and developmental disorders (2Bos J.L. ras oncogenes in human cancer: a review.Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689PubMed Google Scholar, 3Rauen K.A.

RIT1 belongs to the RAS subfamily, sharing ∼44% sequence identity with H-, K-, and N-RAS, but is distinct in that it has a unique N-terminal extension of unknown function, and its C-terminal hypervariable region lacks prenylation and palmitoylation motifs, although reportedly, it can be recruited to the plasma membrane through a C-terminal polybasic region (15Shi G.X.

We investigated wild-type RIT1 and a series of five disease-associated mutants and compared the results with those of the well known small GTPase oncoprotein RAS. To monitor the GTPase cycle of RIT1 using a real-time NMR assay, 15N-labeled recombinant GTPase domain (residues 17–191) of wild-type RIT1 isoform 2 was expressed and purified. A buffer of high ionic strength and high pH (450 mm NaCl, pH 8) was required to prevent precipitation of RIT1 during concentration of the final NMR sample, so these conditions were used throughout the purification as well as the GTPase assays described below. The size exclusion chromatography elution profiles revealed that addition of 5 μm GDP to the running buffer reduced aggregation of the protein (data not shown), and RIT1-GDP eluted as a monomer under these conditions as measured by in-line multi-angle light scattering (Fig. 2A). High quality 1H/15N HSQC spectra of RIT1 (0.8 mm) were obtained for both the GMP-PNP-bound state and the GDP-bound state under the optimized buffer conditions (Fig. 2B). Standard triple-resonance backbone experiments were used to assign 125 cross-peaks for the GDP-bound form (∼70% of the peaks, deposited in the Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank under BMRB Entry 26787), and 12 residues with high-intensity peaks that exhibit chemical shift changes upon nucleotide cycling were chosen as “reporter residues” for the readout of the GTPase assay. First, we compared the intrinsic nucleotide exchange and GTP hydrolysis rates of RIT1 to those of H-RAS, under the same high ionic strength buffer conditions (Fig. 3, A and B). When assays were conducted at pH 8 with 450 mm NaCl, H-RAS nucleotide exchange was accelerated 5-fold and hydrolysis was decreased 2-fold, relative to rates that we previously determined at pH 7.5 with 100 mm NaCl (25Smith M.J.

To initiate nucleotide exchange, a 10-fold molar excess of the non-hydrolysable GTP analog GTPγS was added to GDP-loaded GTPase samples, and HSQC spectra were collected in succession to monitor the reaction. Compared with H-RAS, RIT1 exhibited ∼4-fold faster nucleotide exchange (Fig. 3A and Table 2). To measure intrinsic nucleotide hydrolysis, the samples were loaded with GTP before collection of successive HSQC spectra (Fig. 2C). RIT1 exhibited a 2.2-fold faster hydrolysis rate relative to H-RAS (Fig. 3B).TABLE 2NMR-derived hydrolysis and exchange rates for all experiments in this studyFigureSmall GTPaseNaClpHExchange mean ± S.D.Exchange fold-changeHydrolysis mean ± S.D.Hydrolysis fold-changekE/kH ratiokE/kH fold-changekE/(kH + kE)mmmin−1min−1Fig. 3RIT1 WT4508.07.8 ± 0.7E-218.8 ± 1.3E-319.0 ± 1.6190.0%RIT1 Q79L4508.02.1 ± 0.1E-12.7X above WT5.10E-0417.2X below WT4.1 ± 0.2E245.8X above WT99.8%RIT1 S35T4508.03.0 ± 0.2E-13.8X above WT3.6 ± 0.4E-32.4X below WT8.3 ± 1.0E19.3X above WT98.8%RIT1 A57G4508.04.7 ± 1E-16X above WT5.4 ± 1.0E-31.6X below WT8.7 ± 2.5E19.7X above WT98.9%RIT1 F82V4508.07.6 ± 0.4E-2∼13.0 ± 0.7E-32.9X below WT2.5 ± 0.6E12.8X above WT96.2%RIT1 T83P4508.01.5 ± 0.3E-12.0X above WT2.9 ± 0.1E-33.0X below WT5.4 ± 1.1E16.0X above WT98.2%RIT1 Y89H4508.03.2 ± 0.5E-14.1X above WT5.7 ± 0.2E-31.5X below WT5.7 ± 0.9E16.3X above WT98.3%H-RAS WT4508.02.0 ± 0.2E-23.9X below RIT14.0 ± 0.6E-32.2X below RIT15.0 ± 0.91.8X below RIT183.4%Fig. 4H-RAS WT (1)1007.53.8 ± 0.4E-318.8 ± 0.7E-314.3 ± 0.6E-1130.2%H-RAS G12VaSee Ref. 25.1007.52.0 ± 0.6E-31.8X below WT8.90E-0410X below WT2.2 ± 0.75.2X above WT69.2%H-RAS G13DaSee Ref. 25.1007.556.7 ± 0.7E-315X above WT3.1 ± 0.0E-32.8X below WT1.8 ± 0.2E142X above WT94.8%H-RAS Q61LaSee Ref. 25.1007.59.0 ± 0.9E-32.4X above WT1.10E-0480X below WT8.2 ± 0.8E1190X above WT98.8%a See Ref. 25Smith M.J.

Open table in a new tab Next, we investigated how engineered and disease-associated mutations affect the GTPase cycle of RIT1. We chose to study six mutations that have been associated with NS (S35T, A57G, F82V, T83P, Y89H, and G95A) and an engineered mutation, Q79L. Two of these mutations (A57G and F82V) have also been found in human cancers. Three of these mutations, S35T, A57G, and Y89H, increased the intrinsic nucleotide exchange rate by ∼4-fold, the Q79L and T83P mutations doubled the exchange rate, and F82V had no appreciable effect (Fig. 3, C and D). We then examined the effects of these mutations on GTP hydrolysis, beginning with RIT1 Q79L, an engineered mutation of the putative catalytic residue corresponding to RAS Gln-61 (27Shao H. Kadono-Okuda K. Finlin B.S. Andres D.A. Biochemical characterization of the Ras-related GTPases Rit and Rin.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 371: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). As expected, the Q79L mutation strongly impaired GTPase activity, reducing the hydrolysis rate by 17-fold. Of the disease-associated mutations, F82V and T83P had the largest effect on GTP hydrolysis, reducing the rate by ∼3-fold, followed by S35T (2.4-fold decrease). The A57G and Y89H mutations each caused a modest (1.5-fold) reduction in hydrolysis rate (Fig. 3, E and F). The RIT1 disease-associated mutants investigated in this study exhibited either a faster nucleotide exchange rate, a slower hydrolysis rate, or both (Fig. 4A), strongly suggesting that they would exist in a more highly activated state in vivo. We propose that these mutants can be classified into two groups according to their biochemical properties: fast-exchangers versus slow-hydrolyzers. The fast-exchanger group includes S35T, A57G, and Y89H, whereas the slow-hydrolyzer group includes F82V and T83P, as well as the engineered mutant Q79L. The ratio of the exchange to hydrolysis rates (kE/kH) for RIT1 is 2-fold higher than that of H-RAS under matched high salt conditions, implying a higher basal activation level. Here we propose a formula (see “Experimental Procedures”) to predict the fraction of H-RAS, RIT1, and their mutants in the activated state, on the basis of their intrinsic exchange and hydrolysis rates (Fig. 4B). The predicted basal activation level of H-RAS was 30% at 100 mm NaCl; however, the effects of high salt (450 mm NaCl) on kE and kH increased this value to 84% (Table 2). In the same high salt buffer, 90% of wild-type RIT1 was predicted to be in the activated state, primarily because it exhibits faster exchange (Fig. 4B). However, the basal activation level of RIT1 would probably be lower under physiological salt concentrations, which we were unable to investigate due protein precipitation (extrapolating the effect of salt on H-RAS suggests ∼44% basal activation level of RIT1). The activation of RIT1 was further increased by mutation. The engineered mutant Q79L was the most highly activated mutant, with nearly complete GTP loading due to its impaired ability to hydrolyze GTP. Of the disease-associated mutants, the fast-exchangers were predicted to exhibit higher overall levels of activation than the slow-hydrolyzers. Mutations that perturb both exchange and hydrolysis (S35T and T83P) lead to particularly high levels of activation (Fig. 4, A and B). Using data from our previously published characterization of the intrinsic exchange and hydrolysis rates of H-RAS, we used the same formula to predict the fraction of activated H-RAS oncogenic mutants (25Smith M.J. Neel B.G. Ikura M. NMR-based functional profiling of RASopathies and oncogenic RAS mutations.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 4574-4579Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The H-RAS mutants G12V and Q61L are slow-hydrolyzers, whereas G13D is a fast-exchanger. The impact of these H-RAS mutations on the intrinsic hydrolysis and exchange rates (Fig. 4, C and D) increases the basal activation state from 30 to 70–99% at 100 mm NaCl. The G13D substitution introduces a negative charge in the phosphate-binding site that renders binding of nucleotide less favorable (28Hunter J.C. Manandhar A. Carrasco M.A. Gurbani D. Gondi S. Westover K.D. Biochemical and structural analysis of common cancer-associated KRAS mutations.Mol. Cancer Res. 2015; 13: 1325-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Affinity for nucleotide can also be reduced through an engineered H-RAS mutation (F28L) that disrupts a hydrophobic interaction with the base (29Reinstein J. Schlichting I. Frech M. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. p21 with a phenylalanine 28–leucine mutation reacts normally with the GTPase activating protein GAP but nevertheless has transforming properties.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17700-17706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This approach has been extended to produce analogous fast-exchange mutants of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, which better mimic deregulated oncogenic RHO-GEF activity than mutants with impaired GTP hydrolysis (30Lin R. Cerione R.A. Manor D. Specific contributions of the small GTPases Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 to Dbl transformation.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23633-23641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Thus, mutations that decrease nucleotide affinity can increase nucleotide exchange and the activation of small GTPases. It is interesting that three NS-associated mutations in RIT1 (S35T, A57G, and Y89H) behave like G13D and F28L in H-RAS, whereas the other two RIT1 NS mutations studied (F82V and T83P) are akin to G12V and Q61L in H-RAS. Furthermore, characterization of RASopathy-associated germ-line K-RAS mutations revealed subsets with fast intrinsic nucleotide exchange or slow hydrolysis (31Gremer L. Merbitz-Zahradnik T. Dvorsky R. Cirstea I.C. Kratz C.P. Zenker M. Wittinghofer A. Ahmadian M.R. Germline KRAS mutations cause aberrant biochemical and physical properties leading to developmental disorders.Hum. Mutat. 2011; 32: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Thus, the proposed formula uncovered unexpected similarities between RIT1 and RAS mutants. It is important to note that the activation state of RIT1 in vivo is likely to be substantially modulated by GAPs and/or GEFs, and the effect of RIT1 mutations on sensitivity to GAP/GEF activities. Currently, no such regulators have been identified, and this question awaits further investigation. Nevertheless, the overall activation state of a GTPase protein can be estimated by the fraction that can be pulled down through a GTP-dependent interaction with the GTPase-binding domain of an effector protein. We therefore sought to use a RAS-binding domain (RBD) pulldown assay to compare the basal activation level of RIT1 and its mutants in cells. Among several characterized RIT1 effectors, we chose BRAF as it had been shown to be essential for RIT1-mediated activation of ERK, a key signaling event in NS (32Shi G.X. Andres D.A. Rit contributes to nerve growth factor-induced neuronal differentiation via activation of B-Raf-extracellular signal-regulated kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 830-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Using NMR, we confirmed that recombinant RIT1 binds directly to recombinant BRAF-RBD in a GTP-dependent manner (data not shown), thus we used BRAF RBD for RIT1 pulldown assays. Surprisingly, the engineered mutation of the catalytic residue (Q79L) did not significantly affect the amount of RIT1 pulled down by the RBD (Fig. 5), although a similar result was reported previously by Shi and Andres (32Shi G.X. Andres D.A. Rit contributes to nerve growth fa"
https://openalex.org/W2407279254,"PKC signaling has been implicated in the regulation of many cell functions, including metabolism, cell death, proliferation, and secretion. Activation of conventional and novel PKC isoforms is associated with their Ca(2+)- and/or diacylglycerol (DAG)-dependent translocation to the plasma membrane. In β cells, exocytosis of insulin granules evokes brief (<10 s) local DAG elevations (spiking) at the plasma membrane because of autocrine activation of P2Y1 purinoceptors by ATP co-released with insulin. Using total internal reflection microscopy, fluorescent protein-tagged PKCs, and signaling biosensors, we investigated whether DAG spiking causes membrane recruitment of PKCs and whether different classes of PKCs show characteristic responses. Glucose stimulation of MIN6 cells triggered DAG spiking with concomitant repetitive translocation of the novel isoforms PKCδ, PKCϵ, and PKCη. The conventional PKCα, PKCβI, and PKCβII isoforms showed a more complex pattern with both rapid and slow translocation. K(+) depolarization-induced PKCϵ translocation entirely mirrored DAG spiking, whereas PKCβI translocation showed a sustained component, reflecting the subplasma membrane Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]pm), with additional effect during DAG spikes. Interference with DAG spiking by purinoceptor inhibition prevented intermittent translocation of PKCs and reduced insulin secretion but did not affect [Ca(2+)]pm elevation or sustained PKCβI translocation. The muscarinic agonist carbachol induced pronounced transient PKCβI translocation and sustained recruitment of PKCϵ. When rise of [Ca(2+)]pm was prevented, the carbachol-induced DAG and PKCϵ responses were somewhat reduced, but PKCβI translocation was completely abolished. We conclude that exocytosis-induced DAG spikes efficiently recruit both conventional and novel PKCs to the β cell plasma membrane. PKC signaling is thus implicated in autocrine regulation of β cell function."

Our results demonstrate that gallic acid binds to both SEVI and SEM1 fibrils and modifies their surface electrostatics to render them less cationic. In addition, gallic acid decreased semen-mediated enhancement of HIV infection but did not decrease the inflammatory response induced by semen.

https://openalex.org/W2406715792,"Chemokine receptors play important roles in the immune system and are linked to several human diseases. The initial contact of chemokines with their receptors depends on highly specified extracellular receptor features. Here we investigate the importance of conserved extracellular disulfide bridges and aromatic residues in extracellular loop 2 (ECL-2) for ligand binding and activation in the chemokine receptor CCR8. We used inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate accumulation and radioligand binding experiments to determine the impact of receptor mutagenesis on both chemokine and small molecule agonist and antagonist binding and action in CCR8. We find that the seven-transmembrane (TM) receptor conserved disulfide bridge (7TM bridge) linking transmembrane helix III (TMIII) and ECL-2 is crucial for chemokine and small molecule action, whereas the chemokine receptor conserved disulfide bridge between the N terminus and TMVII is needed only for chemokines. Furthermore, we find that two distinct aromatic residues in ECL-2, Tyr(184) (Cys + 1) and Tyr(187) (Cys + 4), are crucial for binding of the CC chemokines CCL1 (agonist) and MC148 (antagonist), respectively, but not for small molecule binding. Finally, using in silico modeling, we predict an aromatic cluster of interaction partners for Tyr(187) in TMIV (Phe(171)) and TMV (Trp(194)). We show in vitro that these residues are crucial for the binding and action of MC148, thus supporting their participation in an aromatic cluster with Tyr(187) This aromatic cluster appears to be present in a large number of CC chemokine receptors and thereby could play a more general role to be exploited in future drug development targeting these receptors."

Because dihydrotestosterone is the precursor for estrogen receptor β (ERβ) ligands, 5AR inhibitors could potentially limit ERβ activation, which maintains prostate tissue homeostasis. We have uncovered signaling pathways in BPH-derived prostate epithelial cells (BPH-1) that are impacted by 5AR inhibition.

Concurrently, COX-2 positively impacts ERβ action through its effect on the expression of a number of steroidogenic enzymes in the ERβ ligand metabolic pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2404984371,"Rpb9 is a conserved RNA polymerase II (pol II) subunit, the absence of which confers alterations to pol II enzymatic properties and transcription fidelity. It has been suggested previously that Rpb9 affects mobility of the trigger loop (TL), a structural element of Rpb1 that moves in and out of the active site with each elongation cycle. However, a biochemical mechanism for this effect has not been defined. We find that the mushroom toxin α-amanitin, which inhibits TL mobility, suppresses the effect of Rpb9 on NTP misincorporation, consistent with a role for Rpb9 in this process. Furthermore, we have identified missense alleles of RPB9 in yeast that suppress the severe growth defect caused by rpb1-G730D, a substitution within Rpb1 α-helix 21 (α21). These alleles suggest a model in which Rpb9 indirectly affects TL mobility by anchoring the position of α21, with which the TL directly interacts during opening and closing. Amino acid substitutions in Rpb9 or Rpb1 that disrupt proposed anchoring interactions resulted in phenotypes shared by rpb9Δ strains, including increased elongation rate in vitro. Combinations of rpb9Δ with the fast rpb1 alleles that we identified did not result in significantly faster in vitro misincorporation rates than those resulting from rpb9Δ alone, and this epistasis is consistent with the idea that defects caused by the rpb1 alleles are related mechanistically to the defects caused by rpb9Δ. We conclude that Rpb9 supports intra-pol II interactions that modulate TL function and thus pol II enzymatic properties."

Recently, ether lipids have also been discovered in the domain of Bacteria, and the key enzymes that catalyze their synthesis, glycerol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase and heptaprenylglyceryl phosphate synthase, have been described. In Bacillales, heptaprenylglyceryl phosphate does not become linked to a second polyprenyl moiety like ether lipids in Archaea but is dephosphorylated and acetylated. Here, we report on the enzymes that catalyze these reactions. We enriched the phosphatase activity from a B. subtilis cell extract and suppose that dephosphorylation is catalyzed by the phosphatase PhoB or by any other phosphatase in an unspecific manner. By screening a B. subtilis knock-out library for deficiency in acetylation, the yvoF gene product was identified to be the acetyltransferase. The acetyl-CoA-dependent enzyme YvoF is a close relative of maltose O-acetyltransferase (MAT). Its catalytic properties were analyzed and compared with MAT.

https://openalex.org/W2402855129,"Rearranged during transfection (RET), a receptor tyrosine kinase that is activated by the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor family ligands (GFLs), plays a crucial role in the development and function of the nervous system and additionally is required for kidney development and spermatogenesis. RET encodes a transmembrane receptor that is 20 exons long and produces two known protein isoforms differing in C-terminal amino acid composition, referred to as RET9 and RET51. Studies of human pheochromocytomas identified two additional novel transcripts involving the skipping of exon 3 or exons 3, 4, and 5 and are referred to as RET(Δ) (E3) and RET(Δ) (E345), respectively. Here we report the presence of Ret(Δ) (E3) and Ret(Δ) (E345) in zebrafish, mice, and rats and show that these transcripts are dynamically expressed throughout development of the CNS, peripheral nervous system, and kidneys. We further explore the biochemical properties of these isoforms, demonstrating that, like full-length RET, RET(ΔE3) and RET(ΔE345) are trafficked to the cell surface, interact with all four GFRα co-receptors, and have the ability to heterodimerize with full-length RET. Signaling experiments indicate that RET(ΔE3) is phosphorylated in a similar manner to full-length RET. RET(ΔE345), in contrast, displays higher baseline autophosphorylation, specifically on the catalytic tyrosine, Tyr(905), and also on one of the most important signaling residues, Tyr(1062) These data provide the first evidence for a physiologic role of these isoforms in RET pathway function."

Intracellular signaling antibody array analysis revealed small changes in the phosphorylation state of several components of the Akt signaling pathway in HEK293T cells overexpressing LpiR1. Legionella pneumophila is a facultative intracellular parasite of fresh water protozoans, which under certain conditions can gain access to the human respiratory system and cause severe pneumonia, known as Legionnaires' disease (1Fields B.S. Benson R.F. Besser R.E. Legionella and Legionnaires' disease: 25 years of investigation.Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 15: 506-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). L. pneumophila inhaled with contaminated aerosols are engulfed by pulmonary alveolar macrophages that serve as alternative host cells for the pathogen. Inside the eukaryotic cell L. pneumophila establishes a unique replicative niche called the Legionella-containing vacuole (2Isberg R.R. O'Connor T.J. Heidtman M. The Legionella pneumophila replication vacuole: making a cosy niche inside host cells.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), which evades phagolysosomal fusion and thus supports infection progress. Legionella-containing vacuole formation and subversion of host cell immunity is mediated by injection of multiple virulence factors into the host cytoplasm via the type IV Dot/Icm secretion system (3Vogel J.P.

More than 300 bacterial effectors have been identified in Legionella (5Zhu W. Banga S. Tan Y. Zheng C. Stephenson R. Gately J. Luo Z.-Q. Comprehensive identification of protein substrates of the Dot/Icm Type IV transporter of Legionella pneumophila.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e17638Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar); however, the cellular functions and biological activities of most Legionella effectors remain unknown, and structural information about these proteins is limited. Bacterial effectors are products of co-evolution of bacteria and their eukaryotic hosts, and many of them bear unique functional and structural aspects, which must be elucidated to understand the mechanisms of Legionella virulence. LpiR1 (Legionella protein with an internal repeat, encoded by the lpg0634 gene) is a translocated effector (5Zhu W. Banga S. Tan Y. Zheng C. Stephenson R. Gately J. Luo Z.-Q.

Most recent analysis found LpiR1 in 21 of 41 analyzes genomes of Legionella isolates (6Burstein D. Amaro F. Zusman T. Lifshitz Z. Cohen O. Gilbert J.A. Pupko T. Shuman H.A. Segal G.

Moreover, our own BLAST searches identified LpiR1 orthologs in 37 Legionella species, supporting the notion that LpiR1 plays a supporting role in infection. LpiR1 is a 449-amino-acid-long protein predicted to consist of mostly α-helical regions (PSIPRED prediction server; Ref. 7Buchan D.W. Minneci F. Nugent T.C. Bryson K. Jones D.T.

Direct. 2012; 7: 12Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) identified only one protein, the 220-amino-acid-long Lpg1851, which shares ∼22% sequence identity with the N-terminal segment of LpiR1. Both LpiR1 and Lpg1851 are encoded by single-gene operons (9Mao F. Dam P. Chou J. Olman V. Xu Y. DOOR: a database for prokaryotic operons.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D459-D463Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) located in different regions of the L. pneumophila Philadelphia 1 chromosome (10Chien M.

Zhao B. et al.The genomic sequence of the accidental pathogen Legionella pneumophila.Science. 2004; 305: 1966-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Both LpiR1 and Lpg1851 were reported to be up-regulated in the post-exponential growth phase of the bacterium; however, individual knock-out of these genes had no effect on the growth of Legionella within U937 macrophages or protozoa (11Hayashi T. Nakamichi M. Naitou H. Ohashi N. Imai Y. Miyake M. Proteomic analysis of growth phase-dependent expression of Legionella pneumophila proteins which involves regulation of bacterial virulence traits.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e11718Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The knock-out strains were tested for the contact-dependent pore formation in membranes of sheep red blood cells (SRBCs) and only LpiR1 was found to partially contribute to the hemolysis of the SRBCs (11Hayashi T. Nakamichi M. Naitou H. Ohashi N. Imai Y. Miyake M. Proteomic analysis of growth phase-dependent expression of Legionella pneumophila proteins which involves regulation of bacterial virulence traits.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e11718Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The GC content of the LpiR1 and Lpg1851 genes is 38.7% and 36.2%, respectively, which is close to the average GC content of the L. pneumophila Philadelphia 1 chromosome (38%) (10Chien M. Morozova I.

Recently, the crystal structure of Lpg1851 was solved and deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB code 4HFV) 2K. Michalska et al., unpublished information.; however, function of this protein is also unknown. Here we present the crystal structure of LpiR1 and investigate its cellular localization in the host cell. The N- and C-terminal domains have the same fold, indicative of the occurrence of a gene duplication event during evolution. Despite its low sequence identity with Lpg1851, their structures show remarkable similarity. Extensive sequence comparison with homologs of these two proteins identified sequence conservation pattern, which when mapped onto the three-dimensional structure allowed us to identify functionally important regions of these effectors. The ligation-independent cloning method was used to generate the expression plasmids. The LpiR1 gene (Q5ZXU7_LEGPH) encodes a 449-amino-acid-long protein. BLAST sequence alignment showed that the majority of closely related sequences start at Met-5 in lpg0634, and we chose this as the correct start of the gene. Nevertheless, we retained the numbering according to the sequence in the NCBI and UNIPROT databases. Prediction of disordered regions suggested that the C-terminal ∼40 residues show disordered characteristics (DISOPRED prediction server; Ref. 12Ward J.J. McGuffin L.J. Bryson K. Buxton B.F.

The amplified DNA segments were digested with XhoI and KpnI and ligated to the same restriction sites of pEGFP-N1 expression vector (Clontech Laboratories, Mountain View, CA). For the HA-tagged constructs the vector pcDNA5/FRT/TO (14Qin Z. Lu M. Xu X. Hanna M. Shiomi N. Xiao W.

A triple hemagglutinin (HA3) tag was inserted into the pcDNA5/FRT/TO expression vector using HindIII and KpnI restriction sites. Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from New England BioLabs. The lpg0634 open reading frame was PCR-amplified to include KpnI and XhoI restriction sites for cloning purposes.

Cell pellets were resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.7, 400 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 2 mm imidazole, 0.5 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP)) with 1 mm p-aminobenzamidine and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (AEBSF) as protease inhibitors and lysed with high pressure cell disrupter TS series Benchtop (Constant Systems Ltd, UK) at 35 p.s.i. After centrifugation for 1 h at 16,000 × g cleared cell lysate was loaded onto 5 ml of TALON Metal Affinity Resin (Clontech Laboratories). The protein was purified using batch protocol; after 1 h of incubation with cell lysate at 4 °C the resin was washed with 20 resin volumes of buffer A, and the protein was eluted with buffer A containing an additional 100 mm imidazole. The protein was dialyzed against 2 liters of buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine), cleaved with tobacco etch virus protease (1:50 (w:w) ratio, 16 h at 4 °C) to remove the His6 tag, and stored at −80 °C. Before crystallization the protein was subjected to gel filtration on a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) in buffer C (15 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine), the peak fractions corresponding to purified protein were pooled and concentrated to 25 mg/ml. Experiments were performed with the fluorescent dye Sypro Orange (Molecular Probes) using Applied Biosystems StepOnePlus Real Time PCR Instrument (Life Technologies) according to the standard protocol developed by the manufacturer. Experiments were performed on the Nano ITC instrument (TA Instruments, New Castle, DE). 1 mm MnCl2 in 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.5 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine was titrated into the calorimeter cell containing 0.1 mm LpiR1(6–449) in the same buffer. Experiments were performed at 20 °C, and data were analyzed with NanoAnalyze software (TA Instruments) using and independent model. The initial crystallization conditions for LpiR1(6–449) and LpiR1(6–404) were identified with the pHClear screen (Qiagen, Toronto, ON) and were optimized using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Two different crystallization conditions produced diffraction quality crystals: (i) 10% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000, 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 4.0, at 20 °C rendered crystals of both full-length and truncated LpiR1; (ii) 40% (±)-2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 0.1 m MES, pH 6.5, at 4 °C produced better diffracting crystals of truncated LpiR1 and its Se-Met derivative. For data collection, crystals were soaked in a cryo-protectant (reservoir solution supplemented with 25% ethylene glycol for the first condition or straight reservoir solution for the second condition) and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Crystals of native and Se-Met derivatized truncated LpiR1(6–404) produced in the second crystallization condition diffracted to 1.75 and 2.3 Å resolution, respectively, whereas the crystals of full-length LpiR1 diffracted to 2.4 Å resolution. The x-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K at the 08ID-CMCF beamline at the Canadian Light Source (Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada) (16Grochulski P. Fodje M.N. Gorin J. Labiuk S.L. Berg R.

Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics.Acta Crystallogr. D. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23204) Google Scholar). The final Rwork and Rfree values are 0.173 and 0.203, respectively. Pertinent details of data collection and refinement statistics are given in Table 2. We have also collected diffraction data for the crystal of full-length LpiR1(6–449) that diffracted only to 3.8 Å resolution. This structure was solved by molecular replacement method using LpiR1(6–404) as a search model. There was no interpretable electron density for the C-terminal segment beyond Glu-404, confirming that this segment is indeed disordered. The coordinates and structure factors of LpiR1(6–404) at 1.75 Å resolution were deposited in the PDB (entry 5FIA).TABLE 2Summary of data collection and refinement statisticsLpiR1 form 1 (native)LpiR1 form 1 (SeMet)LpiR1 form2Wavelength (Å)0.97950.97860.9795Resolution range (Å)50-1.75 (1.80-1.75)50-2.20 (2.28-2.20)50-2.4 (2.54-2.4)Space groupP21P21P212121Cell parameters a, b, c (Å), β(○)81.4, 71.8, 94.2, 112.081.2, 72.0, 94.2, 112.183.8, 96.2, 151.4Total reflections46,4476387,445643,580Unique reflections100,37551,32548,632Multiplicity4.6 (4.7)7.5 (7.58)13.1 (13.0)Completeness (%)98.7 (97.7)99.8 (99.7)99.7 (98.4)Mean I/Sigma(I)17.39 (2.2)12.1 (2.53)13.7 (2.56)Wilson B-factor (Å2)35.739.535.1Rmerge0.05 (0.86)0.125 (0.87)0.162 (1.0)Rmeas0.057 (0.97)0.135 (0.94)0.175 (1.12)CC1/20.999 (0.740)0.998 (0.835)0.998 (0.755)Rwork0.1700.171Rfree0.2010.213B-factor (Å2)Protein37.952.0Solvent43.343.4Ramachandran plotFavored (%)98.998.8Allowed (%)0.81.16Outliers (%)0.30.0Clash score3.244.29r.m.s.d.Bonds (Å)0.0170.013Angles (○)1.361.17PDB code5FIA5JG4 Open table in a new tab The stereochemistry was validated with ADIT validation server at Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics, Rutgers University. Structure based sequence alignments were generated with BLAST (8Boratyn G.M. Schäffer A.A. Agarwala R. Altschul S.F. Lipman D.J. Madden T.L. Domain enhanced lookup time accelerated BLAST.Biol. Direct. 2012; 7: 12Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Structure superposition and calculation of root mean square deviation were performed with the program Swiss PDB Viewer v. 4.1 (20Guex N. Peitsch M.C. SWISS-MODEL and the Swiss-PdbViewer: an environment for comparative protein modeling.Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9554) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of LpiR1 was used as a template for the PSI-BLAST search. All the sequences with identity >20% and target coverage >80% were considered homologous. The sequences were aligned with PROMALS3D server (21Pei J. Kim B.H. Grishin N.V. PROMALS3D: a tool for multiple protein sequence and structure alignments.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 2295-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar) based on the structures of LpiR1 and Lpg1851 and the secondary structure predictions for all other proteins. The multiple sequence alignment was then used as an input for MEGA6 (22Tamura K. Stecher G. Peterson D. Filipski A. Kumar S. MEGA6: molecular evolutionary genetics analysis version 6.0.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2013; 30: 2725-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (33463) Google Scholar). The evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the JTT matrix-based model (23Jones D.T. Taylor W.R. Thornton J.M. The rapid generation of mutation data matrices from protein sequences.Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1992; 8: 275-282PubMed Google Scholar). The topology of the phylogenetic tree was verified by bootstrap resampling analysis with 500 iterations (24Felsenstein J. Confidence limits on phylogenies: an approach using the bootstrap.Evolution. 1985; 39: 783-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney cell line 293T (HEK293T) was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. To express GFP-tagged LpiR1 effector in mammalian cells, the PCR-amplified gene was inserted into the pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech Laboratories) rendering pEGFP-N1-LpiR1. DNA constructs were transfected into HEK293T cells using the X-treme GENE™ HP DNA Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science, catalog #06366236001) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were visualized on a laser scanner confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM700). HA3-tagged LpiR1-expressing cells were grown on 12-mm diameter glass coverslips. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde solution made up in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, washed in PBS, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS-Tween, and blocked in 5% normal horse serum for 20 min. Cells were incubated with primary anti-HA antibody (sc-7392, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) diluted 1:200 for 60 min at room temperature in the blocking solution. Cells were washed with PBS-Tween, and a secondary Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) was overlaid on coverslips for 20 min at room temperature at a dilution of 1:2000 in blocking solution. Slides were mounted onto 1-mm glass slides and visualized on a Laser Scanner Confocal Microscope (Zeiss LSM700). The cells transfected with the empty vector or vector containing HA3-LpiR1 were cultured with media containing 0.1% FBS for 24 h then treated with 100 ng/ml IGF-I (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 5 min. The cells were harvested and lysed on ice with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol, 1 × complete protease inhibitor mixture) for 15 min. The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. Intracellular signaling molecules were detected using a PathScan® intracellular signaling array kit (Cell Signaling Technology, #7744) according to the manufacturer's procedure. The fluorescent images of the slide were captured with Odyssey® Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR) and intensities of the spots were quantified using image studio analysis software. The LpiR1(6–449) yielded initial crystals diffracting only to 3.8 Å resolution. To enhance the quality of crystals we designed a truncated construct LpiR1(6–404) lacking the C-terminal region that was predicted to be partly disordered by DISOPRED server (supplemental Fig. S1) (12Ward J.J. McGuffin L.J. Bryson K. Buxton B.F. Jones D.T. The DISOPRED server for the prediction of protein disorder.Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 2138-2139Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). This protein gave crystals diffracting to 1.75 Å resolution with (±)-2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol as a precipitant. At a later time we were able to optimize crystallization conditions for LpiR1(6–449) and have obtained crystals with PEG6000 that diffracted to 2.4 Å resolution. However, the last ∼50 residues were not visible in the electron density, confirming their predicted disorder. The visible part of LpiR1 was very similar to the higher resolution structure of truncated LpiR1. We speculate that the function of the C-terminal ∼50 residues might be in binding the chaperone essential for LpiR1 secretion. LpiR1(6–404) crystals contain two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Superposition of the two chains revealed high overall similarity (root mean square deviation = 0.7 Å for 483 Cα atoms). The loop Pro-340–Thr-348 is well defined in molecule B but is disordered in molecule A. Fig. 1A shows the schematic representation of molecule B. LpiR1 is an α-helical protein and consists of two domains with a similar fold. Each domain contains six α-helices. The first four helices (α1-α4 and α7-α10) form an up-and-down antiparallel helical bundle, and the two C-terminal helices (α5-α6, α11-α12) pack nearly perpendicularly to the axis of the four-helix bundle and contact helices α2-α3 (Fig. 1B). The sixth helix (α6, α12) is the longest, with six (α6) and eight (α12) turns. The other equivalent helices in the two domains are of similar lengths. An ∼20-amino-acid-long linker connects the last N-terminal domain helix α6 to the first C-terminal domain helix α7. The two domains can be superimposed with root mean square deviation of 1.3 Å for 118 Cα atoms (of 182 common Cαs) (Fig. 1C), but their sequences show only 15.7% identity. The conformational differences between these two domains are restricted to the loop regions, in particular Leu-90–Ser-99 (Tyr-288–Thr-301 in C-domain), and a somewhat different bend of the C-terminal helices α6 and α12 (Fig. 1C). The two domains associate in an antiparallel fashion with the main contacts formed between helices α6 and α12. Additional interdomain contacts are formed by the C-terminal parts of helices α5 and α11 and the loops following these helices. Helices α5, α6, α11, and α12 delineate a groove that extends across the entire width of the molecule and is ∼25 Å long and 8 Å wide, with α6 and α12 forming the floor and α5 and α11 forming the sides of the groove. One end of the groove is formed by the 340–349 loop that is flexible and observed in the electron density only in molecule B. The residues lining the groove have a largely hydrophilic character (Fig. 2A). Such a long and deep hydrophilic groove suggests a plausible binding site for an extended polypeptide presumably from the LpiR1 host target. To identify proteins with similar fold in the Protein Data Bank we have used several servers including DALI (25Holm L. Rosenström P. Dali server: conservation mapping in 3D.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: W545-W549Crossref PubMed Scopus (3049) Google Scholar), HHPRED (26Söding J. Biegert A. Lupas A.N. The HHpred interactive server for protein homology detection and structure prediction.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W244-W248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2628) Google Scholar), and PHYRE2 (27Kelley L.A. Mezulis S. Yates C.M. Wass M.N. Sternberg M.J. The Phyre2 web portal for protein modeling, prediction and analysis.Nat. Protoc. 2015; 10: 845-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (6063) Google Scholar). Each search identified only one significant match over the entire domain, namely Lpg1851 (PDB code 4HFV) that mapped to one of the domains of LpiR1. No protein in the PDB contained both domains of LpiR1. Therefore, Lpg1851 and LpiR1 domains represent a new fold. To gain insight into potential function of LpiR1, we have searched for its orthologs in bacteria using DELTA-BLAST (8Boratyn G.M. Schäffer A.A. Agarwala R. Altschul S.F. Lipman D.J. Madden T.L. Domain enhanced lookup time accelerated BLAST.Biol. Direct. 2012; 7: 12Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Proteins of similar length and with sequence identity exceeding ∼25% are from various Legionella strains. There is a second cluster of prot"
