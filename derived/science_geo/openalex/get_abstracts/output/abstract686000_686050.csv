https://openalex.org/W4200370252,"Exosomes and other small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) provide a unique mode of cell-to-cell communication in which microRNAs (miRNAs) produced and released from one cell are taken up by cells at a distance where they can enact changes in gene expression1–3. However, the mechanism by which miRNAs are sorted into exosomes/sEVs or retained in cells remains largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that miRNAs possess sorting sequences that determine their secretion in sEVs (EXOmotifs) or cellular retention (CELLmotifs) and that different cell types, including white and brown adipocytes, endothelium, liver and muscle, make preferential use of specific sorting sequences, thus defining the sEV miRNA profile of that cell type. Insertion or deletion of these CELLmotifs or EXOmotifs in a miRNA increases or decreases retention in the cell of production or secretion into exosomes/sEVs. Two RNA-binding proteins, Alyref and Fus, are involved in the export of miRNAs carrying one of the strongest EXOmotifs, CGGGAG. Increased miRNA delivery mediated by EXOmotifs leads to enhanced inhibition of target genes in distant cells. Thus, this miRNA code not only provides important insights that link circulating exosomal miRNAs to tissues of origin, but also provides an approach for improved targeting in RNA-mediated therapies. MicroRNAs encode sorting sequences that determine whether they are secreted in exosomal vesicles to regulate gene expression in distant cells or retained in cells that produced them, with different sequences used by individual cell types."
https://openalex.org/W4226161703,"Electron correlation and topology are two central threads of modern condensed matter physics. Semiconductor moir\'e materials provide a highly tunable platform for studies of electron correlation. Correlation-driven phenomena, including the Mott insulator, generalized Wigner crystals, stripe phases and continuous Mott transition, have been demonstrated. However, nontrivial band topology has remained elusive. Here we report the observation of a quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect in AB-stacked MoTe2/WSe2 moir\'e heterobilayers. Unlike in the AA-stacked structures, an out-of-plane electric field controls not only the bandwidth but also the band topology by intertwining moir\'e bands centered at different high-symmetry stacking sites. At half band filling, corresponding to one particle per moir\'e unit cell, we observe quantized Hall resistance, h/e2 (with h and e denoting the Planck's constant and electron charge, respectively), and vanishing longitudinal resistance at zero magnetic field. The electric-field-induced topological phase transition from a Mott insulator to a QAH insulator precedes an insulator-to-metal transition; contrary to most known topological phase transitions, it is not accompanied by a bulk charge gap closure. Our study paves the path for discovery of a wealth of emergent phenomena arising from the combined influence of strong correlation and topology in semiconductor moir\'e materials."
https://openalex.org/W4200289645,"Efforts to stabilize photoactive formamidinium (FA)–based halide perovskites for perovskite photovoltaics have focused on the growth of cubic formamidinium lead iodide (α-FAPbI3) phases by empirically alloying with cesium, methylammonium (MA) cations, or both. We show that such stabilized FA-rich perovskites are noncubic and exhibit ~2° octahedral tilting at room temperature. This tilting, resolvable only with the use of local nanostructure characterization techniques, imparts phase stability by frustrating transitions from photoactive to hexagonal phases. Although the bulk phase appears stable when examined macroscopically, heterogeneous cation distributions allow microscopically unstable regions to form; we found that these transitioned to hexagonal polytypes, leading to local trap-assisted performance losses and photoinstabilities. Using surface-bound ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, we engineered an octahedral tilt into pure α-FAPbI3 thin films without any cation alloying. The templated photoactive FAPbI3 film was extremely stable against thermal, environmental, and light stressors."

https://openalex.org/W4200403472,"The increasing demand for next-generation energy storage systems necessitates the development of high-performance lithium batteries1-3. Unfortunately, current Li anodes exhibit rapid capacity decay and a short cycle life4-6, owing to the continuous generation of solid electrolyte interface7,8 and isolated Li (i-Li)9-11. The formation of i-Li during the nonuniform dissolution of Li dendrites12 leads to a substantial capacity loss in lithium batteries under most testing conditions13. Because i-Li loses electrical connection with the current collector, it has been considered electrochemically inactive or 'dead' in batteries14,15. Contradicting this commonly accepted presumption, here we show that i-Li is highly responsive to battery operations, owing to its dynamic polarization to the electric field in the electrolyte. Simultaneous Li deposition and dissolution occurs on two ends of the i-Li, leading to its spatial progression toward the cathode (anode) during charge (discharge). Revealed by our simulation results, the progression rate of i-Li is mainly affected by its length, orientation and the applied current density. Moreover, we successfully demonstrate the recovery of i-Li in Cu-Li cells with >100% Coulombic efficiency and realize LiNi0.5Mn0.3Co0.2O2 (NMC)-Li full cells with extended cycle life."
https://openalex.org/W4200457455,"Owing to the worrying increase in carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, there is a need to electrify fossil-fuel–powered chemical processes such as the Haber-Bosch ammonia synthesis. Lithium-mediated electrochemical nitrogen reduction has shown preliminary promise but still lacks sufficient faradaic efficiency and ammonia formation rate to be industrially relevant. Here, we show that oxygen, previously believed to hinder the reaction, actually greatly improves the faradaic efficiency and stability of the lithium-mediated nitrogen reduction when added to the reaction atmosphere in small amounts. With this counterintuitive discovery, we reach record high faradaic efficiencies of up to 78.0 ± 1.3% at 0.6 to 0.8 mole % oxygen in 20 bar of nitrogen. Experimental x-ray analysis and theoretical microkinetic modeling shed light on the underlying mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W4200108213,"Abstract The switch/sucrose non-fermentable (SWI/SNF) complex has a crucial role in chromatin remodelling 1 and is altered in over 20% of cancers 2,3 . Here we developed a proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) degrader of the SWI/SNF ATPase subunits, SMARCA2 and SMARCA4, called AU-15330. Androgen receptor (AR) + forkhead box A1 (FOXA1) + prostate cancer cells are exquisitely sensitive to dual SMARCA2 and SMARCA4 degradation relative to normal and other cancer cell lines. SWI/SNF ATPase degradation rapidly compacts cis -regulatory elements bound by transcription factors that drive prostate cancer cell proliferation, namely AR, FOXA1, ERG and MYC, which dislodges them from chromatin, disables their core enhancer circuitry, and abolishes the downstream oncogenic gene programs. SWI/SNF ATPase degradation also disrupts super-enhancer and promoter looping interactions that wire supra-physiologic expression of the AR , FOXA1 and MYC oncogenes themselves. AU-15330 induces potent inhibition of tumour growth in xenograft models of prostate cancer and synergizes with the AR antagonist enzalutamide, even inducing disease remission in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) models without toxicity. Thus, impeding SWI/SNF-mediated enhancer accessibility represents a promising therapeutic approach for enhancer-addicted cancers."
https://openalex.org/W4200048313,"Abstract Cancer is a ubiquitous disease of metazoans, predicted to disproportionately affect larger, long-lived organisms owing to their greater number of cell divisions, and thus increased probability of somatic mutations 1,2 . While elevated cancer risk with larger body size and/or longevity has been documented within species 3–5 , Peto’s paradox indicates the apparent lack of such an association among taxa 6 . Yet, unequivocal empirical evidence for Peto’s paradox is lacking, stemming from the difficulty of estimating cancer risk in non-model species. Here we build and analyse a database on cancer-related mortality using data on adult zoo mammals (110,148 individuals, 191 species) and map age-controlled cancer mortality to the mammalian tree of life. We demonstrate the universality and high frequency of oncogenic phenomena in mammals and reveal substantial differences in cancer mortality across major mammalian orders. We show that the phylogenetic distribution of cancer mortality is associated with diet, with carnivorous mammals (especially mammal-consuming ones) facing the highest cancer-related mortality. Moreover, we provide unequivocal evidence for the body size and longevity components of Peto’s paradox by showing that cancer mortality risk is largely independent of both body mass and adult life expectancy across species. These results highlight the key role of life-history evolution in shaping cancer resistance and provide major advancements in the quest for natural anticancer defences."
https://openalex.org/W4200487611,"Maintaining a healthy proteome is fundamental for the survival of all organisms1. Integral to this are Hsp90 and Hsp70, molecular chaperones that together facilitate the folding, remodelling and maturation of the many ‘client proteins’ of Hsp902. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a model client protein that is strictly dependent on Hsp90 and Hsp70 for activity3–7. Chaperoning GR involves a cycle of inactivation by Hsp70; formation of an inactive GR–Hsp90–Hsp70–Hop ‘loading’ complex; conversion to an active GR–Hsp90–p23 ‘maturation’ complex; and subsequent GR release8. However, to our knowledge, a molecular understanding of this intricate chaperone cycle is lacking for any client protein. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the GR-loading complex, in which Hsp70 loads GR onto Hsp90, uncovering the molecular basis of direct coordination by Hsp90 and Hsp70. The structure reveals two Hsp70 proteins, one of which delivers GR and the other scaffolds the Hop cochaperone. Hop interacts with all components of the complex, including GR, and poises Hsp90 for subsequent ATP hydrolysis. GR is partially unfolded and recognized through an extended binding pocket composed of Hsp90, Hsp70 and Hop, revealing the mechanism of GR loading and inactivation. Together with the GR-maturation complex structure9, we present a complete molecular mechanism of chaperone-dependent client remodelling, and establish general principles of client recognition, inhibition, transfer and activation. The cryo-electron microscopy structure of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-loading complex—a complex in which Hsp70 loads GR onto Hsp90 and Hop—is described, providing insights into how the chaperones Hsp90 and Hsp70 coordinate to facilitate GR remodelling for activation."

https://openalex.org/W4200372753,"Interactions govern the flow of information and the formation of correlations in quantum systems, dictating the phases of matter found in nature and the forms of entanglement generated in the laboratory. Typical interactions decay with distance and thus produce a network of connectivity governed by geometry, e.g., by the crystalline structure of a material or the trapping sites of atoms in a quantum simulator. However, many envisioned applications in quantum simulation and computation require richer coupling graphs including nonlocal interactions, which notably feature in mappings of hard optimization problems onto frustrated spin systems and in models of information scrambling in black holes. Here, we report on the realization of programmable nonlocal interactions in an array of atomic ensembles within an optical cavity, where photons carry information between distant atomic spins. By programming the distance-dependence of interactions, we access effective geometries where the dimensionality, topology, and metric are entirely distinct from the physical arrangement of atoms. As examples, we engineer an antiferromagnetic triangular ladder, a Moebius strip with sign-changing interactions, and a treelike geometry inspired by concepts of quantum gravity. The tree graph constitutes a toy model of holographic duality, where the quantum system may be viewed as lying on the boundary of a higher-dimensional geometry that emerges from measured spin correlations. Our work opens broader prospects for simulating frustrated magnets and topological phases, investigating quantum optimization algorithms, and engineering new entangled resource states for sensing and computation."
https://openalex.org/W4200236070,"Hsp90 is a conserved and essential molecular chaperone responsible for the folding and activation of hundreds of 'client' proteins1-3. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a model client that constantly depends on Hsp90 for activity4-9. GR ligand binding was previously shown to nr inhibited by Hsp70 and restored by Hsp90, aided by the co-chaperone p2310. However, a molecular understanding of the chaperone-mediated remodelling that occurs between the inactive Hsp70-Hsp90 'client-loading complex' and an activated Hsp90-p23 'client-maturation complex' is lacking for any client, including GR. Here we present a cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the human GR-maturation complex (GR-Hsp90-p23), revealing that the GR ligand-binding domain is restored to a folded, ligand-bound conformation, while being simultaneously threaded through the Hsp90 lumen. In addition, p23 directly stabilizes native GR using a C-terminal helix, resulting in enhanced ligand binding. This structure of a client bound to Hsp90 in a native conformation contrasts sharply with the unfolded kinase-Hsp90 structure11. Thus, aided by direct co-chaperone-client interactions, Hsp90 can directly dictate client-specific folding outcomes. Together with the GR-loading complex structure12, we present the molecular mechanism of chaperone-mediated GR remodelling, establishing the first, to our knowledge, complete chaperone cycle for any Hsp90 client."
https://openalex.org/W4200314703,"The methanogenic degradation of oil hydrocarbons can proceed through syntrophic partnerships of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria and methanogenic archaea1–3. However, recent culture-independent studies have suggested that the archaeon ‘Candidatus Methanoliparum’ alone can combine the degradation of long-chain alkanes with methanogenesis4,5. Here we cultured Ca. Methanoliparum from a subsurface oil reservoir. Molecular analyses revealed that Ca. Methanoliparum contains and overexpresses genes encoding alkyl-coenzyme M reductases and methyl-coenzyme M reductases, the marker genes for archaeal multicarbon alkane and methane metabolism. Incubation experiments with different substrates and mass spectrometric detection of coenzyme-M-bound intermediates confirm that Ca. Methanoliparum thrives not only on a variety of long-chain alkanes, but also on n-alkylcyclohexanes and n-alkylbenzenes with long n-alkyl (C≥13) moieties. By contrast, short-chain alkanes (such as ethane to octane) or aromatics with short alkyl chains (C≤12) were not consumed. The wide distribution of Ca. Methanoliparum4–6 in oil-rich environments indicates that this alkylotrophic methanogen may have a crucial role in the transformation of hydrocarbons into methane. ‘Candidatus Methanoliparum’ overexpresses genes encoding alkyl-coenzyme M and methyl-coenzyme M reductases—markers of archaeal multicarbon alkane and methane metabolism—and thrives on a variety of long-chain alkanes and n-alkylcyclohexanes, and n-alkylbenzenes with long n-alkyl (C≥13) moieties."

Zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs)-quasi one-dimensional semiconducting strips of graphene bounded by parallel zigzag edges-host intrinsic electronic edge states that are ferromagnetically ordered along the edges of the ribbon and antiferromagnetically coupled across its width1,2,5. Despite recent advances in the bottom-up synthesis of GNRs featuring symmetry protected topological phases6-8 and even metallic zero mode bands9, the unique magnetic edge structure of ZGNRs has long been obscured from direct observation by a strong hybridization of the zigzag edge states with the surface states of the underlying support10-15. Here, we present a general technique to thermodynamically stabilize and electronically decouple the highly reactive spin-polarized edge states by introducing a superlattice of substitutional N-atom dopants along the edges of a ZGNR. First-principles GW calculations and scanning tunnelling spectroscopy reveal a giant spin splitting of low-lying nitrogen lone-pair flat bands by an exchange field (~850 tesla) induced by the ferromagnetically ordered edge states of ZGNRs. Our findings directly corroborate the nature of the predicted emergent magnetic order in ZGNRs and provide a robust platform for their exploration and functional integration into nanoscale sensing and logic devices15-21."
https://openalex.org/W3160670184,"The ability to tailor laser light on a chip using integrated photonics has allowed for extensive control over fundamental light-matter interactions in manifold quantum systems including atoms, trapped ions, quantum dots, and defect centers. Free electrons, enabling high-resolution microscopy for decades, are increasingly becoming the subject of laser-based quantum manipulation. Using free-space optical excitation and intense laser pulses, this has led to the observation of free-electron quantum walks, attosecond electron pulses, and imaging of electromagnetic fields. Enhancing the interaction with electron beams through chip-based photonics promises unique applications in nanoscale quantum control and sensing, but has yet to enter electron microscopy. Here, we merge integrated photonics with electron microscopy, demonstrating coherent phase modulation of an electron beam using a silicon nitride microresonator driven by a continuous-wave laser. The high-Q factor (~$10^6$) cavity enhancement and a waveguide designed for phase matching lead to efficient electron-light scattering at unprecedentedly low, few-microwatt optical powers. Specifically, we fully deplete the initial electron state at a cavity-coupled power of 6 $\mu$W and create >500 photon sidebands for only 38 mW in the bus waveguide. Moreover, we demonstrate $\mu$eV electron energy gain spectroscopy (EEGS). Providing simultaneous optical and electronic spectroscopy of the resonant cavity, the fiber-coupled photonic structures feature single-mode electron-light interaction with full control over the input and output channels. This approach establishes a versatile framework for exploring free-electron quantum optics, with future developments in strong coupling, local quantum probing, and electron-photon entanglement. Our results highlight the potential of integrated photonics to efficiently interface free electrons and light."
https://openalex.org/W4200550013,"Tissue-specific cues are critical for homeostasis at mucosal barriers. Here, we report that the clotting factor fibrin is a critical regulator of neutrophil function at the oral mucosal barrier. We demonstrate that commensal microbiota trigger extravascular fibrin deposition in the oral mucosa. Fibrin engages neutrophils through the αMβ2 integrin receptor and activates effector functions, including the production of reactive oxygen species and neutrophil extracellular trap formation. These immune-protective neutrophil functions become tissue damaging in the context of impaired plasmin-mediated fibrinolysis in mice and humans. Concordantly, genetic polymorphisms in PLG, encoding plasminogen, are associated with common forms of periodontal disease. Thus, fibrin is a critical regulator of neutrophil effector function, and fibrin-neutrophil engagement may be a pathogenic instigator for a prevalent mucosal disease."

Cytochrome P-450 derivatives were effective catalysts, and a series of enzyme variants were generated by directed evolution to access the full range of enantiomer and diastereomer products for model substrates.

https://openalex.org/W4200316056,"To explore kinship practices at chambered tombs in Early Neolithic Britain, here we combined archaeological and genetic analyses of 35 individuals who lived about 5,700 years ago and were entombed at Hazleton North long cairn1. Twenty-seven individuals are part of the first extended pedigree reconstructed from ancient DNA, a five-generation family whose many interrelationships provide statistical power to document kinship practices that were invisible without direct genetic data. Patrilineal descent was key in determining who was buried in the tomb, as all 15 intergenerational transmissions were through men. The presence of women who had reproduced with lineage men and the absence of adult lineage daughters suggest virilocal burial and female exogamy. We demonstrate that one male progenitor reproduced with four women: the descendants of two of those women were buried in the same half of the tomb over all generations. This suggests that maternal sub-lineages were grouped into branches whose distinctiveness was recognized during the construction of the tomb. Four men descended from non-lineage fathers and mothers who also reproduced with lineage male individuals, suggesting that some men adopted the children of their reproductive partners by other men into their patriline. Eight individuals were not close biological relatives of the main lineage, raising the possibility that kinship also encompassed social bonds independent of biological relatedness. Archaeological and ancient DNA analyses of 35 individuals entombed at Hazleton North long cairn approximately 5,700 years ago are used to reconstruct kinship practices in Early Neolithic Britain."
https://openalex.org/W4200119175,"In the plant meristem, tissue-wide maturation gradients are coordinated with specialized cell networks to establish various developmental phases required for indeterminate growth. Here, we used single-cell transcriptomics to reconstruct the protophloem developmental trajectory from the birth of cell progenitors to terminal differentiation in the Arabidopsis thaliana root. PHLOEM EARLY DNA-BINDING-WITH-ONE-FINGER (PEAR) transcription factors mediate lineage bifurcation by activating guanosine triphosphatase signaling and prime a transcriptional differentiation program. This program is initially repressed by a meristem-wide gradient of PLETHORA transcription factors. Only the dissipation of PLETHORA gradient permits activation of the differentiation program that involves mutual inhibition of early versus late meristem regulators. Thus, for phloem development, broad maturation gradients interface with cell-type-specific transcriptional regulators to stage cellular differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W4225463649,"Odours are a fundamental part of the sensory environment used by animals to guide behaviours such as foraging and navigation1,2. Primary olfactory (piriform) cortex is thought to be the main cortical region for encoding odour identity3-8. Here, using neural ensemble recordings in freely moving rats performing an odour-cued spatial choice task, we show that posterior piriform cortex neurons carry a robust spatial representation of the environment. Piriform spatial representations have features of a learned cognitive map, being most prominent near odour ports, stable across behavioural contexts and independent of olfactory drive or reward availability. The accuracy of spatial information carried by individual piriform neurons was predicted by the strength of their functional coupling to the hippocampal theta rhythm. Ensembles of piriform neurons concurrently represented odour identity as well as spatial locations of animals, forming an odour-place map. Our results reveal a function for piriform cortex in spatial cognition and suggest that it is well-suited to form odour-place associations and guide olfactory-cued spatial navigation."

An understanding of the potential trapping and storage mechanisms is required to provide confidence in safe and secure CO 2 geological sequestration 1,2 . Depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs have substantial CO 2 storage potential 1 , 3 , and numerous hydrocarbon reservoirs have undergone CO 2 injection as a means of enhanced oil recovery (CO 2 -EOR), providing an opportunity to evaluate the (bio)geochemical behaviour of injected carbon. Here we present noble gas, stable isotope, clumped isotope and gene-sequencing analyses from a CO 2 -EOR project in the Olla Field (Louisiana, USA). We show that microbial methanogenesis converted as much as 13–19% of the injected CO 2 to methane (CH 4 ) and up to an additional 74% of CO 2 was dissolved in the groundwater. We calculate an in situ microbial methanogenesis rate from within a natural system of 73–109 millimoles of CH 4 per cubic metre (standard temperature and pressure) per year for the Olla Field. Similar geochemical trends in both injected and natural CO 2 fields suggest that microbial methanogenesis may be an important subsurface sink of CO 2 globally. For CO 2 sequestration sites within the environmental window for microbial methanogenesis, conversion to CH 4 should be considered in site selection."

How do human subsistence strategies accommodate our expanded energy budgets? We found that relative to other great apes, human hunter-gatherers and subsistence farmers spend more energy but less time on subsistence, acquire substantially more energy per hour, and achieve similar energy efficiencies. These findings revise our understanding of human energetic evolution by indicating that humans afford expanded energy budgets primarily by increasing rates of energy acquisition, not through energy-saving adaptations such as economical bipedalism or sophisticated tool use that decrease subsistence costs and improve the energetic efficiency of subsistence. We argue that the time saved by human subsistence strategies provides more leisure time for social interaction and social learning in central-place locations and would have been critical for cumulative cultural evolution."

Unlike naturally occurring aptamers that efficiently fold and undergo metabolite-induced conformational changes, fluorogenic aptamers can exhibit poor folding, which limits their cellular fluorescence. To overcome this, we evolved a naturally occurring well-folded adenine riboswitch into a fluorogenic aptamer. We generated a library of roughly 1015 adenine aptamer-like RNAs in which the adenine-binding pocket was randomized for both size and sequence, and selected Squash, which binds and activates the fluorescence of green fluorescent protein-like fluorophores. Squash exhibits markedly improved in-cell folding and highly efficient metabolite-dependent folding when fused to a S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-binding aptamer. A Squash-based ratiometric sensor achieved quantitative SAM measurements, revealed cell-to-cell heterogeneity in SAM levels and revealed metabolic origins of SAM.

https://openalex.org/W4200007643,"Superconductivity originates from the formation of bound (Cooper) pairs of electrons that can move through the lattice without resistance below the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$. Electron Cooper pairs in most superconductors form anti-parallel spin singlets with total spin $S=0$, although they can also form parallel spin-triplet Cooper pairs with $S=1$ and an odd parity wavefunction. Spin-triplet pairing is important because it can host topological states and Majorana fermions relevant for quantum computation. Because spin-triplet pairing is usually mediated by ferromagnetic (FM) spin fluctuations, uranium based materials near an FM instability are considered to be ideal candidates for realizing spin-triplet superconductivity. Indeed, UTe$_2$, which has a $T_c\approx 1.6$ K, has been identified as a candidate for a chiral spin-triplet topological superconductor near an FM instability, although it also has antiferromagnetic (AF) spin fluctuations. Here we use inelastic neutron scattering (INS) to show that superconductivity in UTe$_2$ is coupled to a sharp magnetic excitation, termed resonance, at the Brillouin zone boundary near AF order. Because the resonance has only been found in spin-singlet unconventional superconductors near an AF instability, its observation in UTe$_2$ suggests that AF spin fluctuations may also induce spin-triplet pairing or that electron pairing in UTe$_2$ has a spin-singlet component."
https://openalex.org/W4200496004,"Grafting is possible in both animals and plants. Although in animals the process requires surgery and is often associated with rejection of non-self, in plants grafting is widespread, and has been used since antiquity for crop improvement1. However, in the monocotyledons, which represent the second largest group of terrestrial plants and include many staple crops, the absence of vascular cambium is thought to preclude grafting2. Here we show that the embryonic hypocotyl allows intra- and inter-specific grafting in all three monocotyledon groups: the commelinids, lilioids and alismatids. We show functional graft unions through histology, application of exogenous fluorescent dyes, complementation assays for movement of endogenous hormones, and growth of plants to maturity. Expression profiling identifies genes that unify the molecular response associated with grafting in monocotyledons and dicotyledons, but also gene families that have not previously been associated with tissue union. Fusion of susceptible wheat scions to oat rootstocks confers resistance to the soil-borne pathogen Gaeumannomyces graminis. Collectively, these data overturn the consensus that monocotyledons cannot form graft unions, and identify the hypocotyl (mesocotyl in grasses) as a meristematic tissue that allows this process. We conclude that graft compatibility is a shared ability among seed-bearing plants."

We developed a method that interfaces the studied quantum state with another state and used it to identify the topological order of ν = 5/2 state. The interface between two half-planes, one hosting the ν = 5/2 state and the other an integer ν = 3 state, supports a fractional ν = 1/2 charge mode and a neutral Majorana mode. The counterpropagating chirality of the Majorana mode, probed by measuring partition noise, is consistent with the particle-hole Pfaffian (PH-Pf) topological order and rules out the anti-Pfaffian order."

These structures reveal that Pol IV and RDR2 form a complex with their active sites connected by an interpolymerase channel, through which the Pol IV–generated transcript is handed over to the RDR2 active site after being backtracked, where it is used as the template for double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) synthesis. Our results describe a ‘backtracking-triggered RNA channeling’ mechanism underlying dsRNA synthesis and also shed light on the evolutionary trajectory of eukaryotic RNA polymerases."

We use variants of the peptides GLP-1 and exendin-4 (Ex4) to explore the interplay between helical propensity near the agonist N terminus and the ability to bind to and activate the receptor. Cryo-EM analysis of a complex involving an Ex4 analog, the GLP-1R and Gs heterotrimer revealed two receptor conformers with distinct modes of peptide-receptor engagement.

Here we use a CRISPR-Cas9 screen to focus on genes that have been implicated in tRNA biogenesis, and identify a mechanism by which altered valine tRNA biogenesis enhances mitochondrial bioenergetics in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL). Expression of valine aminoacyl tRNA synthetase is transcriptionally upregulated by NOTCH1, a key oncogene in T-ALL, underlining a role for oncogenic transcriptional programs in coordinating tRNA supply and demand. Limiting valine bioavailability through restriction of dietary valine intake disrupted this balance in mice, resulting in decreased leukaemic burden and increased survival in vivo. Mechanistically, valine restriction reduced translation rates of mRNAs that encode subunits of mitochondrial complex I, leading to defective assembly of complex I and impaired oxidative phosphorylation. Finally, a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screen in differential valine conditions identified several genes, including SLC7A5 and BCL2, whose genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition synergized with valine restriction to reduce T-ALL growth. Our findings identify tRNA deregulation as a critical adaptation in the pathogenesis of T-ALL and provide a molecular basis for the use of dietary approaches to target tRNA biogenesis in blood malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W4200563105,"We describe single-component optogenetic probes whose activation dynamics depend on both light and temperature. We used the BcLOV4 photoreceptor to stimulate Ras and phosphatidyl inositol-3-kinase signaling in mammalian cells, allowing activation over a large dynamic range with low basal levels. Surprisingly, we found that BcLOV4 membrane translocation dynamics could be tuned by both light and temperature such that membrane localization spontaneously decayed at elevated temperatures despite constant illumination. Quantitative modeling predicted BcLOV4 activation dynamics across a range of light and temperature inputs and thus provides an experimental roadmap for BcLOV4-based probes. BcLOV4 drove strong and stable signal activation in both zebrafish and fly cells, and thermal inactivation provided a means to multiplex distinct blue-light sensitive tools in individual mammalian cells. BcLOV4 is thus a versatile photosensor with unique light and temperature sensitivity that enables straightforward generation of broadly applicable optogenetic tools."
https://openalex.org/W4226136052,"Abstract DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) are deleterious lesions, and their incorrect repair can drive cancer development 1 . HELQ is a superfamily 2 helicase with 3′ to 5′ polarity, and its disruption in mice confers germ cells loss, infertility and increased predisposition to ovarian and pituitary tumours 2–4 . At the cellular level, defects in HELQ result in hypersensitivity to cisplatin and mitomycin C, and persistence of RAD51 foci after DNA damage 3,5 . Notably, HELQ binds to RPA and the RAD51-paralogue BCDX2 complex, but the relevance of these interactions and how HELQ functions in DSB repair remains unclear 3,5,6 . Here we show that HELQ helicase activity and a previously unappreciated DNA strand annealing function are differentially regulated by RPA and RAD51. Using biochemistry analyses and single-molecule imaging, we establish that RAD51 forms a complex with and strongly stimulates HELQ as it translocates during DNA unwinding. By contrast, RPA inhibits DNA unwinding by HELQ but strongly stimulates DNA strand annealing. Mechanistically, we show that HELQ possesses an intrinsic ability to capture RPA-bound DNA strands and then displace RPA to facilitate annealing of complementary sequences. Finally, we show that HELQ deficiency in cells compromises single-strand annealing and microhomology-mediated end-joining pathways and leads to bias towards long-tract gene conversion tracts during homologous recombination. Thus, our results implicate HELQ in multiple arms of DSB repair through co-factor-dependent modulation of intrinsic translocase and DNA strand annealing activities."
https://openalex.org/W4200182658,"Mounting evidence has linked the metabolic disease to neurovascular disorders and cognitive decline. Using a murine model of a high-fat high-sugar diet mimicking obesity-induced type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in humans, we show that pro-inflammatory mediators and altered immune responses damage the blood-brain barrier (BBB) structure, triggering a proinflammatory metabolic phenotype. We find that disruption to tight junctions and basal lamina due to loss of control in the production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors (TIMPs) causes BBB impairment. Together the disruption to the structural and functional integrity of the BBB results in enhanced transmigration of leukocytes across the BBB that could contribute to an initiation of a neuroinflammatory response through activation of microglia. Using a humanized in vitro model of the BBB and T2DM patient post-mortem brains, we show the translatable applicability of our results. We find a leaky BBB phenotype in T2DM patients can be attributed to a loss of junctional proteins through changes in inflammatory mediators and MMP/TIMP levels, resulting in increased leukocyte extravasation into the brain parenchyma. We further investigated therapeutic avenues to reduce and restore the BBB damage caused by HFHS-feeding. Pharmacological treatment with recombinant annexin A1 (hrANXA1) or reversion from a high-fat high-sugar diet to a control chow diet (dietary intervention), attenuated T2DM development, reduced inflammation, and restored BBB integrity in the animals. Given the rising incidence of diabetes worldwide, understanding metabolic-disease-associated brain microvessel damage is vital and the proposed therapeutic avenues could help alleviate the burden of these diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4200580400,"Magnetars are strongly magnetized, isolated neutron stars1-3 with magnetic fields up to around 1015 gauss, luminosities of approximately 1031-1036 ergs per second and rotation periods of about 0.3-12.0 s. Very energetic giant flares from galactic magnetars (peak luminosities of 1044-1047 ergs per second, lasting approximately 0.1 s) have been detected in hard X-rays and soft γ-rays4, and only one has been detected from outside our galaxy5. During such giant flares, quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) with low (less than 150 hertz) and high (greater than 500 hertz) frequencies have been observed6-9, but their statistical significance has been questioned10. High-frequency QPOs have been seen only during the tail phase of the flare9. Here we report the observation of two broad QPOs at approximately 2,132 hertz and 4,250 hertz in the main peak of a giant γ-ray flare11 in the direction of the NGC 253 galaxy12-17, disappearing after 3.5 milliseconds. The flare was detected on 15 April 2020 by the Atmosphere-Space Interactions Monitor instrument18,19 aboard the International Space Station, which was the only instrument that recorded the main burst phase (0.8-3.2 milliseconds) in the full energy range (50 × 103 to 40 × 106 electronvolts) without suffering from saturation effects such as deadtime and pile-up. Along with sudden spectral variations, these extremely high-frequency oscillations in the burst peak are a crucial component that will aid our understanding of magnetar giant flares."
https://openalex.org/W4200359472,"This study aims to elucidate the relationships between gut microbiota, bile acid metabolism, and psychological comorbidity in Crohn's disease (CD). We profiled the fecal microbiota composition and quantified the bile acid pool of 39 CD patients and 14 healthy controls using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, respectively. Significant reductions in the secondary bile acids, LCA and DCA, were found in both the feces and serum samples of CD patients, while the concentration of 7-DHCA was particularly higher in the serum of CD patients with psychological disorders. The fecal levels of HDCA and 12-DHCA of the CD patients were inversely correlated with their Self-Rated Depression Scale (SDS) scores, whereas the serum level of 7-DHCA was positively correlated with the SDS scores. In addition, the fecal levels of TDCA, TLCA, and TβMCA showed a positive correlation with the Self-Rated Anxiety Scale (SAS) scores. The fecal microbiota biodiversity was particularly declined in CD patients with psychological disorders. An enrichment of Ruminococcus gnavus in CD patients may cause psychological disorders by affecting the microbiota-gut-brain axis via its ability to degrade the gut barrier, regulate the tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism, and modulate bile acid metabolism. In addition, the overabundant Enterobacteriaceae and Lachnospiraceae in CD patients may contribute to psychological comorbidity via dysregulating their bile acids metabolism. Taken together, changes in the gut microbiota composition may cooperate with alterations in the bile acid metabolism that are involved in the development of psychological disorders in CD."
https://openalex.org/W4200553190,"Squash is an RNA aptamer that strongly activates the fluorescence of small-molecule analogs of the fluorophore of green fluorescent protein (GFP). Unlike other fluorogenic aptamers, isolated de novo from random-sequence RNA, Squash was evolved from the bacterial adenine riboswitch to leverage its optimized in vivo folding and stability. We now report the 2.7-Å resolution cocrystal structure of fluorophore-bound Squash, revealing that while the overall fold of the riboswitch is preserved, the architecture of the ligand-binding core is dramatically transformed. Unlike previously characterized aptamers that activate GFP-derived fluorophores, Squash does not harbor a G-quadruplex, sandwiching its fluorophore between a base triple and a noncanonical base quadruple in a largely apolar pocket. The expanded structural core of Squash allows it to recognize unnatural fluorophores that are larger than the simple purine ligand of the parental adenine riboswitch, and suggests that stable RNA scaffolds can tolerate larger variation than has hitherto been appreciated."

https://openalex.org/W4200127022,"We aimed to investigate whether the gut microbiota and fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are associated with skeletal muscle mass and strength in healthy Chinese children aged 6-9 years. In this study, 412 children were enrolled. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to characterize the gut microbiota compositions. Fecal SCFAs were quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography. Dual X-ray absorptiometry was used to measure the total body lean soft tissue mass (TSM), total body fat mass (TBF), appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM), and appendicular fat mass (AFM). TSM/height2 (TSMI), ASM/height2 (ASMI), TSM/weight (TSMR), ASM/weight (ASMR), and the ratio of TSM/TBF and ASM/AFM were calculated. Handgrip strength (HGS) was measured using the Jamar® Plus+ Hand Dynamometer. A multiple regression analysis after adjustment for covariates and multiple test correction showed some operational taxonomic units in partial least squares models identified by Multivariate methods with Unbiased Variable selection analysis such as genera of Faecalibacterium, Lachnospira, Lachnospiraceae_ND3007_group, and Lachnospiraceae_UCG-004 were positively correlated with at least one measure of TSM, TSMI, ASM, ASMI, and ASMI Z-score (β: 0.103-0.143, pFDR : .008-.032) but negatively correlated with at least one measure of TSMR, TSM/TBF, ASMR, ASM/AFM, and ASMR Z-score (β: -0.185 to 0.124, pFDR = .008-.045). Children with higher fecal butyric acid, acetic acid, and total SCFA levels exhibited higher TSM, ASM, TSMI, ASMI, and ASMI Z-score and lower TSM/TBF, ASM/AFM, TSMR, ASMR, and ASMR Z-score. However, after additional adjustment for TBF or body mass index, only the associations for Faecalitalea and Pyramidobacter still existed. Mediation analysis suggested that total body fat significantly mediated 66.3%-95.3% of the estimated association of microbiota and SCFAs with TSM, ASM, and ASMI Z-score. Our results suggest that the associations of gut microbiota and SCFAs with skeletal muscle quality in children may largely depend upon on total body fat content."
https://openalex.org/W4200402228,"Excessive rapid increases in cytosolic free Ca2+ have a clear association with the induction of cancer cell death. Whereas, characterizing the Ca2+ signaling events that occur during the progression of the apoptotic cascade over a period of hours or days, has not yet been possible. Now using genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators complemented with automated epifluorescence microscopy we have shown that staurosporine-induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells was associated with delayed development of cytosolic free Ca2+ fluctuations, which were then maintained for 24 h. These cytosolic free Ca2+ fluctuations were dependent on the Ca2+ channel ORAI1. Silencing of ORAI1, but not its canonical activators STIM1 and STIM2, promoted apoptosis in this model. The pathway for this regulation implicates a mechanism previously associated with the migration of cancer cells involving ORAI1, the chaperone protein SigmaR1, and Ca2+ -activated K+ channels."
https://openalex.org/W4200181231,"Brown adipose tissue (BAT) transplantation is a promising means of increasing whole-body energy metabolism to ameliorate obesity. However, the changes in BAT following transplantation and the effects of the microenvironment of the recipient site on graft function have yet to be fully characterized. Therefore, we aimed to determine the effects of transplanting BAT from C57BL/6 mice into the dorsal subcutaneous region or deep to the quadriceps femoris muscle of leptin-deficient ob/ob mice. Subcutaneously transplanted BAT lost features of BAT and demonstrated greater inflammatory cell infiltration and more oil cysts 16 weeks following transplantation. By contrast, the sub-muscularly transplanted BAT maintained features of BAT and was more highly vascularized. Interestingly, sub-muscular BAT transplantation led to a significant increase in oxygen consumption and less inflammation in subcutaneous fat, which was associated with long-term reductions in insulin resistance and body mass gain, whereas the subcutaneous transplants failed after 16 weeks. These results demonstrate that the beneficial effects of BAT transplantation depend upon the microenvironment of the recipient site. Skeletal muscle may provide a microenvironment that maintains the inherent features of BAT grafts over a long period of time, which facilitates a reduction in obesity and improvements in glucose homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W4200329228,"Intrauterine infection would harm a developing embryo/fetus, thereby increasing the risk of developmental malformation. But, whether or not the infection-induced inflammation affects neural crest development still remains obscure. In this study, we employed meta-analysis to demonstrate the potential correlation between infection-induced inflammation and craniofacial anomalies, which was usually derived from the problems in neural crest cell development. The correlation was further verified by inflammatory cytokine release and the activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain enhancer of activated B cells signaling in lipopolysaccharide-treated HH10 chicken embryos. In such an inflammatory condition, AP-2α- and Pax7-labeled pre-migratory and migratory neural crest cells in HH10 chicken embryos were significantly less than the ones in control. The bioinformatics analysis of RNA-seq data demonstrated that the principal differential gene expression occurred in transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway, which was confirmed by the subsequent experimental results of quantitative PCR and immunofluorescent staining. Under this inflammatory circumstance, whole-mount in situ hybridization, immunofluorescence, and quantitative PCR showed the gene expression changes of key EMT-related transcription factors including upregulated Msx1, downregulated Slug, and FoxD3, as well as adhesion molecules and extracellular matrix protein including upregulated Cadherrin6B, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and Laminin at the dorsal portion of neural tube of HH10 chicken embryos. Meanwhile, the bioinformatics analysis of RNA-seq data also manifested the differential gene expressions relevant to cell proliferation, which was confirmed by proliferating cell nuclear antigen Western blot data and co-immunofluorescence staining of human natural killer-1 and phosphorylated histone H3. In brief, this study revealed for the first time that the double-edged sword role of TGF-β signaling pathway between intrauterine inflammation (protective role) and cranial neural crest development (harmful role)."
