A challenge for their large-scale development is to avoid formulations that depend on toxic transition metal ions. Lin et al. show that quinones can be dissolved in alkaline solutions and coupled with ferricyanides to make a flow cell battery (see the Perspective by Perry). This gives scope for developing flow cells with very low costs, high efficiencies at practical power densities, simplicity of operation, and inherent safety.

https://openalex.org/W1800944583,"Cellular senescence is a terminal stress-activated program controlled by the p53 and p16(INK4a) tumor suppressor proteins. A striking feature of senescence is the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), a pro-inflammatory response linked to tumor promotion and aging. We have identified the transcription factor GATA4 as a senescence and SASP regulator. GATA4 is stabilized in cells undergoing senescence and is required for the SASP. Normally, GATA4 is degraded by p62-mediated selective autophagy, but this regulation is suppressed during senescence, thereby stabilizing GATA4. GATA4 in turn activates the transcription factor NF-κB to initiate the SASP and facilitate senescence. GATA4 activation depends on the DNA damage response regulators ATM and ATR, but not on p53 or p16(INK4a). GATA4 accumulates in multiple tissues, including the aging brain, and could contribute to aging and its associated inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W1739343289,"Chiral edge states are a hallmark of quantum Hall physics. In electronic systems, they appear as a macroscopic consequence of the cyclotron orbits induced by a magnetic field, which are naturally truncated at the physical boundary of the sample. Here we report on the experimental realization of chiral edge states in a ribbon geometry with an ultracold gas of neutral fermions subjected to an artificial gauge field. By imaging individual sites along a synthetic dimension, we detect the existence of the edge states, investigate the onset of chirality as a function of the bulk-edge coupling, and observe the edge-cyclotron orbits induced during a quench dynamics. The realization of fermionic chiral edge states is a fundamental achievement, which opens the door towards experiments including edge state interferometry and the study of non-Abelian anyons in atomic systems."
https://openalex.org/W1753684754,"There is growing interest in using engineered cells as therapeutic agents. For example, synthetic chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) can redirect T cells to recognize and eliminate tumor cells expressing specific antigens. Despite promising clinical results, these engineered T cells can exhibit excessive activity that is difficult to control and can cause severe toxicity. We designed ""ON-switch"" CARs that enable small-molecule control over T cell therapeutic functions while still retaining antigen specificity. In these split receptors, antigen-binding and intracellular signaling components assemble only in the presence of a heterodimerizing small molecule. This titratable pharmacologic regulation could allow physicians to precisely control the timing, location, and dosage of T cell activity, thereby mitigating toxicity. This work illustrates the potential of combining cellular engineering with orthogonal chemical tools to yield safer therapeutic cells that tightly integrate cell-autonomous recognition and user control."
https://openalex.org/W1508600475,"We engineered a two-dimensional magnetic lattice in an elongated strip geometry, with effective per-plaquette flux ~4/3 times the flux quanta. We imaged the localized edge and bulk states of atomic Bose-Einstein condensates in this strip, with single lattice-site resolution along the narrow direction. Further, we observed both the skipping orbits of excited atoms traveling down our system's edges, analogues to edge magnetoplasmons in 2-D electron systems, and a dynamical Hall effect for bulk excitations. Our lattice's long direction consisted of the sites of an optical lattice and its narrow direction consisted of the internal atomic spin states. Our technique has minimal heating, a feature that will be important for spectroscopic measurements of the Hofstadter butterfly and realizations of Laughlin's charge pump."
https://openalex.org/W2146810078,"Dying cells initiate adaptive immunity by providing both antigens and inflammatory stimuli for dendritic cells, which in turn activate CD8(+) T cells through a process called antigen cross-priming. To define how different forms of programmed cell death influence immunity, we established models of necroptosis and apoptosis, in which dying cells are generated by receptor-interacting protein kinase-3 and caspase-8 dimerization, respectively. We found that the release of inflammatory mediators, such as damage-associated molecular patterns, by dying cells was not sufficient for CD8(+) T cell cross-priming. Instead, robust cross-priming required receptor-interacting protein kinase-1 (RIPK1) signaling and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-induced transcription within dying cells. Decoupling NF-κB signaling from necroptosis or inflammatory apoptosis reduced priming efficiency and tumor immunity. Our results reveal that coordinated inflammatory and cell death signaling pathways within dying cells orchestrate adaptive immunity."

A stochastic superposition of gravitational waves from all such binary systems will modulate the arrival times of pulses from radio pulsars. Using observations of millisecond pulsars obtained with the Parkes radio telescope, we constrain the characteristic amplitude of this background, $A_{\rm c,yr}$, to be < $1.0\times10^{-15}$ with 95% confidence. This limit excludes predicted ranges for $A_{\rm c,yr}$ from current models with 91-99.7% probability. We conclude that binary evolution is either stalled or dramatically accelerated by galactic-center environments, and that higher-cadence and shorter-wavelength observations would result in an increased sensitivity to gravitational waves."

One way they can cause cancer is by targeting tumor suppressor proteins in the host. Now Lau et al. report that DNA tumor viruses can also thwart the host's immune system. Oncogenes from HPV and human adenovirus bound to the protein STING, a key component of the cGAS-STING pathway that senses and defends against intracellular DNA. In this way, the viruses subvert the host's antiviral immunity and set up shop, which, for an unlucky few, eventually causes cancer. Science , this issue p. 568"

Thus, a major advantage of applying enzymes to synthetic chemistry is their compatibility with environmentally benign conditions. Mutti et al. report that two enzymes—alcohol and amine dehydrogenases—can operate in tandem to convert alcohols to amines. The reaction proceeds with ammonium as the only input and water as the only byproduct. The mechanism relies on consecutive oxidation and reduction steps, with hydrogen shuttled by a nicotinamide coenzyme. Science , this issue p. 1525"
https://openalex.org/W2253284310,"Ecological partnerships, or mutualisms, are globally widespread, sustaining agriculture and biodiversity. Mutualisms evolve through the matching of functional traits between partners, such as tongue length of pollinators and flower tube depth of plants. Long-tongued pollinators specialize on flowers with deep corolla tubes, whereas shorter-tongued pollinators generalize across tube lengths. Losses of functional guilds because of shifts in global climate may disrupt mutualisms and threaten partner species. We found that in two alpine bumble bee species, decreases in tongue length have evolved over 40 years. Co-occurring flowers have not become shallower, nor are small-flowered plants more prolific. We argue that declining floral resources because of warmer summers have favored generalist foraging, leading to a mismatch between shorter-tongued bees and the longer-tubed plants they once pollinated."

https://openalex.org/W2222562619,"Deficiencies of the human cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) enzyme are characterized by a plethora of vascular disorders and hyperhomocysteinemia. However, several clinical trials demonstrated that despite reduction in homocysteine levels, disease outcome remained unaffected, thus the mechanism of endothelial dysfunction is poorly defined. Here, we show that the loss of CBS function in endothelial cells (ECs) leads to a significant down-regulation of cellular hydrogen sulfide (H2S) by 50% and of glutathione (GSH) by 40%. Silencing CBS in ECs compromised phenotypic and signaling responses to the VEGF that were potentiated by decreased transcription of VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-2 and neuropilin (NRP)-1, the primary receptors regulating endothelial function. Transcriptional down-regulation of VEGFR-2 and NRP-1 was mediated by a lack in stability of the transcription factor specificity protein 1 (Spl), which is a sulfhydration target of H2S at residues Cys68 and Cys755. Reinstating H2S but not GSH in CBS-silenced ECs restored Sp1 levels and its binding to the VEGFR-2 promoter and VEGFR-2, NRP-1 expression, VEGF-dependent proliferation, and migration phenotypes. Thus, our study emphasizes the importance of CBS-mediated protein S-sulfhydration in maintaining vascular health and function.—Saha, S., Chakraborty, P. K., Xiong, X., Dwivedi, S. K. D., Mustafi, S.

https://openalex.org/W2280664838,"Hepatitis B virus core protein has 183 amino acids divided into an assembly domain and an arginine-rich C-terminal domain (CTD) that regulates essential functions including genome packaging, reverse transcription, and intracellular trafficking. Here, we investigated the CTD in empty hepatitis B virus (HBV) T=4 capsids. We examined wild-type core protein (Cp183-WT) and a mutant core protein (Cp183-EEE), in which three CTD serines are replaced with glutamate to mimic phosphorylated protein. We found that Cp183-WT capsids were less stable than Cp183-EEE capsids. When we tested CTD sensitivity to trypsin, we detected two different populations of CTDs differentiated by their rate of trypsin cleavage. Interestingly, CTDs from Cp183-EEE capsids exhibited a much slower rate of proteolytic cleavage when compared with CTDs of Cp183-WT capsids. Cryo-electron microscopy studies of trypsin-digested capsids show that CTDs at five-fold symmetry vertices are most protected. We hypothesize that electrostatic interactions between glutamates and arginines in Cp183-EEE, particularly at five-fold, increase capsid stability and reduce CTD exposure. Our studies show that quasi-equivalent CTDs exhibit different rates of exposure and thus might perform distinct functions during the hepatitis B virus lifecycle. Our results demonstrate a structural role for CTD phosphorylation and indicate crosstalk between CTDs within a capsid particle."

Here we offer a Perspective on how a productive translational research dialog between preclinical models and clinical studies of these disorders is being powered by an ever-developing appreciation of the shared neural circuits and genetic architecture that moderate the response to stress across species.

https://openalex.org/W2186936608,"A large body of findings has tied midfrontal theta-band (4-8 Hz) oscillatory activity to adaptive control mechanisms during response conflict. Thus far, this evidence has been correlational. To evaluate whether theta oscillations are causally involved in conflict processing, we applied transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) in the theta band to a midfrontal scalp region, while human subjects performed a spatial response conflict task. Conflict was introduced by incongruency between the location of the target stimulus and the required response hand. As a control condition, we used alpha-band (8-12 Hz) tACS over the same location. The exact stimulation frequencies were determined empirically for each subject based on a pre-stimulation EEG session. Behavioral results showed general conflict effects of slower response times (RT) and lower accuracy for high conflict trials compared to low conflict trials. Importantly, this conflict effect was reduced specifically during theta tACS, which was driven by slower response times on low conflict trials. These results show how theta tACS can modulate adaptive cognitive control processes, which is in accordance with the view of midfrontal theta oscillations as an active mechanism for cognitive control."
https://openalex.org/W2203730437,"Objectives Maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity rates are particularly grim in conflict, post-conflict and other crisis settings, a situation partly blamed on non-availability and/or poor quality of emergency obstetric and neonatal care (EmONC) services. The aim of this study was to explore the barriers to effective delivery of EmONC services in post-conflict Burundi and Northern Uganda, in order to provide policy makers and other relevant stakeholders context-relevant data on improving the delivery of these lifesaving services. Methods This was a qualitative comparative case study that used 42 face-to-face semi-structured in-depth interviews and 4 focus group discussions for data collection. Participants were 32 local health providers and 37 staff of NGOs working in the area of maternal health. Data was analysed using the framework approach. Results The availability, quality and distribution of EmONC services were major challenges across the sites. The barriers in the delivery of quality EmONC services were categorised into two major themes; human resources-related challenges, and systemic and institutional failures. While some of the barriers were similar, others were unique to specific sites. The common barriers included shortage of qualified staff; lack of essential installations, supplies and medications; increasing workload, burn-out and turnover; and poor data collection and monitoring systems. Barriers unique to Northern Uganda were demoralised personnel and lack of recognition; poor referral system; inefficient drug supply system; staff absenteeism in rural areas; and poor coordination among key personnel. In Burundi, weak curriculum; poor harmonisation and coordination of training; and inefficient allocation of resources were the unique challenges. To improve the situation across the sites, efforts are ongoing to improve the training and recruitment of more staff; harmonise and strengthen the curriculum and training; increase the number of EmONC facilities; and improve staff supervision, monitoring and support. Conclusions Post-conflict health systems face different challenges in the delivery of EmONC services and as such require context-specific interventions to improve the delivery of these services."

Fungal LTR retrotransposons prevent mutagenic insertions through diverse targeting mechanisms that avoid coding sequences, but conserved principles guiding their target site selection have not been established. Here, we show that insertion of the fission yeast LTR retrotransposon Tf1 is guided by the DNA binding protein Sap1 and that the efficiency and location of the targeting depend on the activity of Sap1 as a replication fork barrier. We propose that Sap1 and the fork arrest it causes guide insertion of Tf1 by tethering the integration complex to target sites."

Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) occurred only in P3. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) increased in P3 over P1 and P2 (P <0.0001, respectively). In P2 and P3, vancomycin resistant enterococci were detected. The percentage of gram-negative organisms remained unchanged. Third generation cephalosporin resistant gram-negative rods (3GCR-GN) were found exclusively in P3. Cefazolin-susceptible gram-positive organisms decreased over the three decades (93% in P1, 75% in P2 and 58% in P3, P<0.01, P<0.05 and P<0.0001, respectively).

To extend its utility and to fully exploit its medicinal potential, we have evaluated the in vitro antiviral activity of a methanolic extract of PT leaves and its isolated compounds against Herpes Simplex Virus type 2 (HSV-2). Bioactivity-guided studies revealed that the extract and one of its constituents, luteolin, had potent antiviral activity against wild-type and clinical isolates of HSV-2 (EC50 48.5–52.6 and 22.4–27.5 μg/ml, respectively), with nearly complete inhibition at 86.5–101.8 and 40.2–49.6 μg/ml, respectively. The inhibitory effect was significant (p<0.001) when the drug was added 2 h prior to infection, and was effective up to 4 h post-infection. As viral replication requires NF-κB activation, we examined whether the observed extract-induced inhibition of HSV-2 was related to NF-κB inhibition. Interestingly, we observed that treatment of HSV-2-infected cells with extract or luteolin suppressed NF-κB activation. Although NF-κB, JNK and MAPK activation was compromised during HSV replication, neither the extract nor luteolin affected HSV-2-induced JNK1/2 and MAPK activation. Moreover, the PT leaf extract and luteolin potently down-regulated the expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, Interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, NO and iNOS and the production of gamma interferon (IFN-γ), which are directly involved in controlling the NF-κB signaling pathway. Thus, our results indicate that both PT leaf extract and luteolin modulate the NF-κB signaling pathway, resulting in the inhibition of HSV-2 replication."

Initial experiments established that Rav2 and Skp1 bind to Rav1, but not to each other, and that RAVE exists as a stable complex with Rav1 as the central component (9.Seol J.H. Shevchenko A.

In contrast, rav1Δ and rav2Δ mutants exhibit a Vma− growth phenotype, characterized by poor growth at high pH and/or elevated calcium concentrations, but unlike other vma mutants only display this phenotype at elevated temperature (13.Smardon A.M.

Although the composition of the RAVE complex is quite well established, neither the basis of its activity in promoting V-ATPase assembly nor the sites of interaction between Rav1 and its partners are understood. Under conditions of V-ATPase disassembly, RAVE binds to V1 sectors in cytosolic fractions via the E and/or G subunits of V1, but this interaction is not intrinsically glucose-sensitive (10.Smardon A.M.

Rav1 also has a binding site for the cytosolic N-terminal domain of Vo subunit Vph1 (13.Smardon A.M. Diab H.I. Tarsio M. Diakov T.T. Nasab N.D. West R.W. Kane P.M. The RAVE complex is an isoform-specific V-ATPase assembly factor in yeast.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2014; 25: 356-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The V1 C subunit is present at the interface of the V1 and Vo sectors and is thus positioned to play a critical role in reversible disassembly of the V-ATPase (14.Oot R.A. Wilkens S.

Interestingly, this subunit is released from both the V1 and Vo sectors when the V-ATPase disassembles (6.Kane P.M. Disassembly and reassembly of the yeast vacuolar H+-ATPase in vivo.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Tabke K. Albertmelcher A. Vitavska O. Huss M. Schmitz H.P. Wieczorek H.

Subunit C binds to Rav1 independently of the V1 subcomplex and is the only subunit that has shown any binding to Rav2 (18.Smardon A.M. Kane P.M.

Binding of RAVE to detached V1 sectors, V1 subunit C, and Vo subunit Vph1 is intriguing, because it suggests that RAVE might act by bringing these subunits together to establish or re-establish V1-Vo assembly. However, without any information about structure or binding sites on RAVE, this proposed activity remains speculative. RAVE function in V-ATPase assembly appears to be conserved in higher eukaryotes. Higher eukaryotes contain larger rabconnectin-3 complexes consisting of two subunits, rabconnectin-3α (also called DMXL2 in humans) and rabconnectin-3β (also called WDR7 in humans) (19.Sakisaka T. Takai Y. Purification and properties of rabconnectin-3.Methods Enzymol. 2005; 403: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Mutations in either subunit have been shown to result in organelle acidification defects (20.Sethi N. Yan Y. Quek D. Schupbach T. Kang Y.

Although other fungi contain RAV2 homologues, there is no sequence homology between the rabconnectin subunits and RAV2. In contrast, a highly conserved region has been identified in fungal RAV1 homologues and in mammalian rabconnectin-3α subunits and designated the “Rav1-C superfamily” (24.Marchler-Bauer A. Derbyshire M.K. Gonzales N.R. Lu S. Chitsaz F. Geer L.Y. Geer R.C. He J. Gwadz M. Hurwitz D.I. Lanczycki C.J. Lu F. Marchler G.H. Song J.S. Thanki N. Wang Z. Yamashita R.A. Zhang D. Zheng C. Bryant S.H. CDD: NCBI's conserved domain database.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43: D222-D226Crossref PubMed Scopus (2269) Google Scholar). This region extends from amino acids 571 to 1191 of yeast RAV1, but the RAV1 sequence between amino acids 840 and 1125 is the most highly conserved across all species (25.Kane P.M. Smardon A.M. Assembly and regulation of the yeast vacuolar H+-ATPase.J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2003; 35: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition, the N-terminal 240 amino acids of yeast RAV1 also align with the N termini of rabconnectin-3α homologues of higher organisms. Based on sequence comparisons with both other fungi and higher eukaryotes, we identified six regions of Rav1 that are conserved to differing degrees (25.Kane P.M. Smardon A.M. Assembly and regulation of the yeast vacuolar H+-ATPase.J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2003; 35: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Many questions remain about RAVE/rabconnectin structure and function. Although multiple interactions between the V-ATPase and yeast RAVE have been identified, these interactions have not been mapped to specific regions of the RAVE complex. Mapping these interactions could provide insights into the mechanism of RAVE-promoted assembly. In addition, although RAVE participates in glucose-sensitive reversible disassembly of the V-ATPase, it has not been determined which interactions with RAVE might be glucose-sensitive. Given the high level of sequence conservation among all eukaryotic V-ATPases and the evidence that RAVE and rabconnectin complexes both regulate V-ATPase activity at the level of V1-Vo assembly, we hypothesized that functionally critical V-ATPase subunit binding sites might be located in the conserved regions of Rav1. In this work, we test this hypothesis by generating a series of deletions and fragments of Rav1 and evaluating their binding to V-ATPase subunit partners. In addition, we demonstrate that the RAVE complex shows glucose-dependent association with the vacuolar membrane in vivo, consistent with its role in glucose-dependent V-ATPase assembly. Oligonucleotides were purchased from MWG Operon. Anti-FLAG-M2 resin, mouse anti-FLAG-M2 antibody, and FLAG peptide were purchased from Sigma. Amylose resin was purchased from New England Biolabs, and glutathione-Sepharose was from GenScript. TALON resin, for purification of His6-tagged protein, was obtained from Clontech. Anti-myc monoclonal antibody (9E10) was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Media for growth of yeast and Escherichia coli were from Fisher Scientific. Yeast cells were maintained in rich medium, YEPD (yeast extract, peptone, 2% dextrose) medium buffered to pH 5 with 50 mm potassium phosphate and 50 mm potassium succinate, or in fully supplemented minimal medium (SC) with individual nutrients omitted for selection as indicated. The Vma− phenotype was tested by comparing growth of cells on YEPD plates buffered to pH 5 to growth on YEPD plates buffered to pH 7.5 with 50 mm MES and 50 mm MOPS, to which 60 mm CaCl2 was added. The yeast strains used in this work are listed in Table 1.

This was followed by amplification of RAV1 fragments immediately upstream of each desired terminal amino acid (at positions 839, 939, 1125, and 1270) using the following oligonucleotide pairs, respectively: R1M6-5p and RAV1M6; R1M7-5p and RAV1M7; R1M5-5p and RAV1M5; and R1M5-5p and RAV1M13. (Oligonucleotide sequences are shown in Table 2.) Another RAV1 PCR fragment immediately downstream of the stop codon was amplified using oligonucleotides RAV1M3 and YJR9.

The resulting fusion PCR product was used to transform an SF838-5Aα vma5Δ::kanMX strain and colonies able to grow on YEPD pH 7.5 plates were selected. Integration of the FLAG-VMA5 was confirmed by DNA sequencing and expression of the tagged protein by immunoblotting. The RAV2-myc13 strains were also constructed as described above, by fusing the myc13kanMX cassette to RAV2 fragments upstream and downstream of the stop codon, generated by PCR using oligonucleotides RAV2M1 and RAV2M2 and oligonucleotides RAV2M3 and YDR6-6, respectively.

The MBP (maltose-binding protein)-Rav1NT-His6 expression plasmid was constructed by amplifying the sequence corresponding to amino acids 2–729 of RAV1 by PCR using oligonucleotides Rav1 NTerm BamHI and Rav1 NTerm SalI (which introduces the His6 tag just before the stop codon) and a combination of LA-Taq (TaKaRa) and Pfu (New England Biolabs) polymerases to enhance fidelity. The resulting PCR fragment was cloned into the pGEM T-Easy vector (Promega) after A-tailing with Taq polymerase (Fisher). The insert was verified by sequencing at the Upstate DNA sequencing facility. Digestion with BamHI and SalI removed the insert, which was ligated to the pMAL-pAse vector (31.Diab H. Ohira M. Liu M. Cobb E. Kane P.M.

The MBP-RAV2-FLAG construct was constructed by PCR amplifying the entire RAV2 sequence using oligonucleotides Rav2BamHI forward and Rav2SalI reverse (which introduces a single FLAG tag immediately before the stop codon). The amplified fragment was cloned into the pGEM T-Easy and pMAL-pAse vectors as described above. The MBP-RAV1(679–898)-His6 expression plasmid was constructed in two steps. First, the RAV1 fragment corresponding to amino acids 679–898 was amplified by PCR, using oligonucleotides (Rav1679RI and Rav1898-SalI), and this fragment was cloned into the pMAL-pAse vector as described above. The His6 tag was subsequently added by inverse PCR mutagenesis using oligonucleotides (Rav(679–898)-HisF and Rav(679–898)-HisR) to generate a mutagenized PCR product, followed by digestion of the unmutagenized template with DpnI and transformation of E. coli DH5α cells.

https://openalex.org/W2276848127,"The main target of cAMP is PKA, the main regulatory subunit of which (PRKAR1A) presents mutations in two genetic disorders: acrodysostosis and Carney complex. In addition to the initial recurrent mutation (R368X) of the PRKAR1A gene, several missense and nonsense mutations have been observed recently in acrodysostosis with hormonal resistance. These mutations are located in one of the two cAMP-binding domains of the protein, and their functional characterization is presented here. Expression of each of the PRKAR1A mutants results in a reduction of forskolin-induced PKA activation (measured by a reporter assay) and an impaired ability of cAMP to dissociate PRKAR1A from the catalytic PKA subunits by BRET assay. Modeling studies and sensitivity to cAMP analogs specific for domain A (8-piperidinoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate) or domain B (8-(6-aminohexyl)aminoadenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate) indicate that the mutations impair cAMP binding locally in the domain containing the mutation. Interestingly, two of these mutations affect amino acids for which alternative amino acid substitutions have been reported to cause the Carney complex phenotype. To decipher the molecular mechanism through which homologous substitutions can produce such strikingly different clinical phenotypes, we studied these mutations using the same approaches. Interestingly, the Carney mutants also demonstrated resistance to cAMP, but they expressed additional functional defects, including accelerated PRKAR1A protein degradation. These data demonstrate that a cAMP binding defect is the common molecular mechanism for resistance of PKA activation in acrodysosotosis and that several distinct mechanisms lead to constitutive PKA activation in Carney complex."
https://openalex.org/W2191062907,BACKGROUND: HIV infection increases a womans risk for cervical cancer and cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates are higher in countries with high HIV prevalence and limited resources for screening. Visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) allows screening and treatment of cervical lesions in a single-visit approach (SVA) but data on its performance in HIV-infected women are limited. This studys objective was to examine cervical cancer screening using VIA/SVA in programs serving HIV-infected women. METHODS: A VIA/SVA program with cryotherapy for VIA-positive lesions was implemented in Cote dIvoire Guyana and Tanzania from 2009 to 2012. The effect of HIV status on VIA positivity and on presence of cryotherapy-eligible lesions was examined using a cross-sectional study design with Chi-square tests for comparisons and constructed multivariate logistic regression models. A P-value of < 0.05 was significant. FINDINGS: VIA was performed on 34921 women 10% (3580) were VIA positive; 2508 (85%) eligible women received cryotherapy during the same visit; only 234 (52%) of those who postponed returned for treatment; 622 (17%) VIA-positive women had lesions too large to be treated with cryotherapy and were referred for excisional treatment. In multivariate analysis-controlling for HIV status location of the screening clinic facility location facility type and country-compared to HIV-uninfected/unknown women HIV-infected women had higher odds of being VIA positive (OR 1.95 95% CI 1.76 2.16 P<0.0001) and of having large lesions requiring referral (OR 1.93 95% CI 1.49 2.51 P< 0.0001). Minor treatment complications occurred in 19 of 3032 (0.63%) women; none required further intervention. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that compared to HIV-uninfected/unknown women HIV-infected women had nearly twice the odds of being VIA-positive and to require referral for large lesions. SVA was safe and resulted in significant reductions in loss to follow-up. There is increased need for excisional treatment in countries with high HIV prevalence.
https://openalex.org/W1900483244,"The potential cytotoxicity of cadmium selenide (CdSe) quantum dots (QDs) presents a barrier to their use in biomedical imaging or as diagnostic and therapeutic agents. Sulforaphane (SFN) is a chemoprotective compound derived from cruciferous vegetables which can up-regulate antioxidant enzymes and induce apoptosis and autophagy. This study reports the effects of SFN on CdSe QD-induced cytotoxicity in immortalised human hepatocytes and in the livers of mice. CdSe QDs induced dose-dependent cell death in hepatocytes with an IC50 = 20.4 μM. Pre-treatment with SFN (5 μM) increased cell viability in response to CdSe QDs (20 μM) from 49.5 to 89.3%. SFN induced a pro-oxidant effect characterized by depletion of intracellular reduced glutathione during short term exposure (3-6 h), followed by up-regulation of antioxidant enzymes and glutathione levels at 24 h. SFN also caused Nrf2 translocation into the nucleus, up-regulation of antioxidant enzymes and autophagy. siRNA knockdown of Nrf2 suggests that the Nrf2 pathway plays a role in the protection against CdSe QD-induced cell death. Wortmannin inhibition of SFN-induced autophagy significantly suppressed the protective effect of SFN on CdSe QD-induced cell death. Moreover, the role of autophagy in SFN protection against CdSe QD-induced cell death was confirmed using mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking ATG5. CdSe QDs caused significant liver damage in mice, and this was decreased by SFN treatment. In conclusion, SFN attenuated the cytotoxicity of CdSe QDs in both human hepatocytes and in the mouse liver, and this protection was associated with the induction of Nrf2 pathway and autophagy."
https://openalex.org/W2186058544,"Heavy alcohol consumption has detrimental neurologic effects, inducing widespread neuronal loss in both fetuses and adults. One proposed mechanism of ethanol-induced cell loss with sufficient exposure is an elevation in concentrations of bioactive lipids that mediate apoptosis, including the membrane sphingolipid metabolites ceramide and sphingosine. While these naturally-occurring lipids serve as important modulators of normal neuronal development, elevated levels resulting from various extracellular insults have been implicated in pathological apoptosis of neurons and oligodendrocytes in several neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders. Prior work has shown that acute administration of ethanol to developing mice increases levels of ceramide in multiple brain regions, hypothesized to be a mediator of fetal alcohol-induced neuronal loss. Elevated ceramide levels have also been implicated in ethanol-mediated neurodegeneration in adult animals and humans. Here, we determined the effect of chronic voluntary ethanol consumption on lipid profiles in brain and peripheral tissues from adult alcohol-preferring (P) rats to further examine alterations in lipid composition as a potential contributor to ethanol-induced cellular damage. P rats were exposed for 13 weeks to a 20% ethanol intermittent-access drinking paradigm (45 ethanol sessions total) or were given access only to water (control). Following the final session, tissues were collected for subsequent chromatographic analysis of lipid content and enzymatic gene expression. Contrary to expectations, ethanol-exposed rats displayed substantial reductions in concentrations of ceramides in forebrain and heart relative to non-exposed controls, and modest but significant decreases in liver cholesterol. qRT-PCR analysis showed a reduction in the expression of sphingolipid delta(4)-desaturase (Degs2), an enzyme involved in de novo ceramide synthesis. These findings indicate that ethanol intake levels achieved by alcohol-preferring P rats as a result of chronic voluntary exposure may have favorable vs. detrimental effects on lipid profiles in this genetic line, consistent with data supporting beneficial cardioprotective and neuroprotective effects of moderate ethanol consumption."

https://openalex.org/W1899383052,"As dietary saturated fatty acids are associated with metabolic and cardiovascular disease, a potentially interesting strategy to reduce disease risk is modification of the quality of fat consumed. Vegetable oils represent an attractive target for intervention, as they largely determine the intake of dietary fats. Furthermore, besides potential health effects conferred by the type of fatty acids in a vegetable oil, other minor components (e.g. phytochemicals) may also have health benefits. Here, we investigated the potential long-term health effects of isocaloric substitution of dietary fat (i.e. partial replacement of saturated by unsaturated fats), as well as putative additional effects of phytochemicals present in unrefined (virgin) oil on development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and associated atherosclerosis. For this, we used pumpkin seed oil, because it is high in unsaturated fatty acids and a rich source of phytochemicals.ApoE*3Leiden mice were fed a Western-type diet (CON) containing cocoa butter (15% w/w) and cholesterol (1% w/w) for 20 weeks to induce risk factors and disease endpoints. In separate groups, cocoa butter was replaced by refined (REF) or virgin (VIR) pumpkin seed oil (comparable in fatty acid composition, but different in phytochemical content).Both oils improved dyslipidaemia, with decreased (V)LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels in comparison with CON, and additional cholesterol-lowering effects of VIR over REF. While REF did not affect plasma inflammatory markers, VIR reduced circulating serum amyloid A and soluble vascular adhesion molecule-1. NAFLD and atherosclerosis development was modestly reduced in REF, and VIR strongly decreased liver steatosis and inflammation as well as atherosclerotic lesion area and severity.Overall, we show that an isocaloric switch from a diet rich in saturated fat to a diet rich in unsaturated fat can attenuate NAFLD and atherosclerosis development. Phytochemical-rich virgin pumpkin seed oil exerts additional anti-inflammatory effects resulting in more pronounced health effects."
https://openalex.org/W2181290625,"Small ankyrin 1 (sAnk1) is a 17-kDa transmembrane (TM) protein that binds to the cytoskeletal protein, obscurin, and stabilizes the network sarcoplasmic reticulum in skeletal muscle. We report that sAnk1 shares homology in its TM amino acid sequence with sarcolipin, a small protein inhibitor of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA). Here we investigate whether sAnk1 and SERCA1 interact. Our results indicate that sAnk1 interacts specifically with SERCA1 in sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle, and in COS7 cells transfected to express these proteins. This interaction was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and an anisotropy-based FRET method. Binding was reduced ~2-fold by the replacement of all of the TM amino acids of sAnk1 with leucines by mutagenesis. This suggests that, like sarcolipin, sAnk1 interacts with SERCA1 at least in part via its TM domain. Binding of the cytoplasmic domain of sAnk1 to SERCA1 was also detected in vitro. ATPase activity assays show that co-expression of sAnk1 with SERCA1 leads to a reduction of the apparent Ca(2+) affinity of SERCA1 but that the effect of sAnk1 is less than that of sarcolipin. The sAnk1 TM mutant has no effect on SERCA1 activity. Our results suggest that sAnk1 interacts with SERCA1 through its TM and cytoplasmic domains to regulate SERCA1 activity and modulate sequestration of Ca(2+) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum lumen. The identification of sAnk1 as a novel regulator of SERCA1 has significant implications for muscle physiology and the development of therapeutic approaches to treat heart failure and muscular dystrophies linked to Ca(2+) misregulation."
https://openalex.org/W2304978093,"In contrast to the depth of knowledge on the pathological effects of parasitism in domestic animals, the impact of the vast majority of parasites on wildlife hosts is poorly understood and, besides, information from domestics is rarely usable to disclose the parasites' impact on free-ranging populations' dynamics. Here we use Toxoplasmosis as a study model since, until now, the infection process and the protozoan's effects in natural conditions has received little attention. We analysed 81 sera from red deer (Cervus elaphus) sampled in Italian Alps and through generalized linear models we evaluated (1) the epidemiological factors influencing T. gondii infection dynamics; (2) its impact on female fertility [corrected]. High seroprevalence of T. gondii infection was recorded in yearling (1 year-old; prevalence = 52.4%) and adult (>2 year-old; prevalence = 51.3%) red deer, while calves (<1 year-old) did not contract the infection suggesting horizontal transmission as the main route of infection. The stable prevalence between yearlings and adults and the higher serological titres of younger individuals lead to two alternative infection processes suggesting a difference between age classes or in acquiring the infection or in responding to the pathogen. No associations between T. gondii serological titres and pregnancy status was observed indicating no direct effect on the probability of being pregnant; nevertheless a relation between females' higher serological titres and lower foetal development emerged, suggesting potential effects of the parasite infection on deer reproduction. The results demonstrate high seroprevalence of T. gondii infection in free-ranging red deer and, furthermore, the effect on foetal development suggests the potential impact of the parasite on red deer fertility and thus on its population dynamics."

The hypothesis was based on the periodontitis-atherosclerosis paradigm.In our prospective cohort study from Sweden 1676 randomly selected subjects were followed up from 1985 to 2012. All subjects underwent clinical oral examination and answered a questionnaire assessing background variables such as socio-economic status and pack-years of smoking. Cases with stroke were recorded from the Center of Epidemiology, Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare, Sweden, and classified according to the WHO International Classification of Diseases. Unpaired t-test, chi-square tests, and multiple logistic regression analyses were used.Of the 1676 participants, 39 subjects (2.3%) had been diagnosed with stroke. There were significant differences between the patients with stroke and subjects without in pack-years of smoking (p = 0.01), prevalence of gingival inflammation (GI) (p = 0.03), and dental calculus (p = 0.017). In a multiple regression analysis the association between GI, confounders and stroke, GI showed odds ratio 2.20 (95% confidence interval 1.02-4.74) for stroke.Our present findings showed that gingival inflammation clearly associated with stroke in this 26-year cohort study.

https://openalex.org/W2287080951,"The digestive function of the stomach depends on acidification of the gastric lumen. Acid secretion into the lumen is triggered by activation of the PKA cascade, which ultimately results in the insertion of gastric H,K-ATPases into the apical plasma membranes of parietal cells. A coupling protein is ezrin, whose phosphorylation at Ser-66 by PKA is required for parietal cell activation. However, little is known regarding the molecular mechanism(s) by which this signaling pathway operates in gastric acid secretion. Here we show that PKA cooperates with MST4 to orchestrate histamine-elicited acid secretion by phosphorylating ezrin at Ser-66 and Thr-567. Histamine stimulation activates PKA, which phosphorylates MST4 at Thr-178 and then promotes MST4 kinase activity. Interestingly, activated MST4 then phosphorylates ezrin prephosphorylated by PKA. Importantly, MST4 is important for acid secretion in parietal cells because either suppression of MST4 or overexpression of non-phosphorylatable MST4 prevents the apical membrane reorganization and proton pump translocation elicited by histamine stimulation. In addition, overexpressing MST4 phosphorylation-deficient ezrin results in an inhibition of gastric acid secretion. Taken together, these results define a novel molecular mechanism linking the PKA-MST4-ezrin signaling cascade to polarized epithelial secretion in gastric parietal cells."
https://openalex.org/W2205506446,"Aspergillus fumigatus is an inhaled fungal pathogen of human lungs, the developmental growth of which is reliant upon Ca2+-mediated signalling. Ca2+ signalling has regulatory significance in all eukaryotic cells but how A. fumigatus uses intracellular Ca2+ signals to respond to stresses imposed by the mammalian lung is poorly understood. In this work, A. fumigatus strains derived from the clinical isolate CEA10, and a non-homologous recombination mutant ΔakuBKU80, were engineered to express the bioluminescent Ca2+-reporter aequorin. An aequorin-mediated method for routine Ca2+ measurements during the early stages of colony initiation was successfully developed and dynamic changes in cytosolic free calcium ([Ca2+]c) in response to extracellular stimuli were measured. The response to extracellular challenges (hypo- and hyper-osmotic shock, mechanical perturbation, high extracellular Ca2+, oxidative stress or exposure to human serum) that the fungus might be exposed to during infection, were analysed in living conidial germlings. The ‘signatures’ of the transient [Ca2+]c responses to extracellular stimuli were found to be dose- and age-dependent. Moreover, Ca2+-signatures associated with each physico-chemical treatment were found to be unique, suggesting the involvement of heterogeneous combinations of Ca2+-signalling components in each stress response. Concordant with the involvement of Ca2+-calmodulin complexes in these Ca2+-mediated responses, the calmodulin inhibitor trifluoperazine (TFP) induced changes in the Ca2+-signatures to all the challenges. The Ca2+-chelator BAPTA potently inhibited the initial responses to most stressors in accordance with a critical role for extracellular Ca2+ in initiating the stress responses."
https://openalex.org/W2337024033,"Beta2-integrins are important in leukocyte trafficking and function, and are regulated through the binding of cytoplasmic proteins, such as kindlin-3, to their intracellular domain. Here, we investigate the involvement of beta2-integrins in the regulation of metabolic disease using mice where the kindlin-3 binding site in the beta2-integrin cytoplasmic tail has been mutated (TTT/AAA-beta2-integrin knock-in (KI) mice), leading to expressed but dysfunctional beta2-integrins and significant neutrophilia in vivo. Beta2-integrin KI mice fed on a high fat diet showed normal weight gain, and normal accumulation of macrophages and lymphocytes in white adipose tissue (WAT) and liver, but increased neutrophil numbers especially in WAT. In addition, beta2-integrin KI mice fed on a high fat diet showed significantly increased peripheral insulin resistance in response to high-fat feeding. However, this was associated with improved glucose disposal following glucose load. Interestingly, beta2-integrin KI neutrophils produced more elastase in vitro, in response to stimulation. Beta2-integrin KI mice displayed variability of tissue inflammatory status, with liver and WAT exhibiting little or no difference in inflammation compared to high fat fed controls, whereas skeletal muscle demonstrated a raised inflammatory profile in association with higher elastase levels and diminished signalling through the IRS1-PKB pathway. In conclusion, although expression of dysfunctional beta2-integrins increased neutrophil production and infiltration into tissue, skeletal muscle was the most affected tissue exhibiting evidence of higher neutrophil activity and insulin resistance. Thus, beta2-integrins modulate glucose homeostasis during high fat feeding predominantly through actions on skeletal muscle to affect metabolic phenotype in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2196563970,"Background Avian influenza A (H7N9) virus has emerged recently and continues to cause severe disease with a high mortality rate in humans prompting the development of candidate vaccine viruses. Live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV) are 6:2 reassortant viruses containing the HA and NA gene segments from wild type influenza viruses to induce protective immune responses and the six internal genes from Master Donor Viruses (MDV) to provide temperature sensitive, cold-adapted and attenuated phenotypes. Methodology/Principal Findings LAIV candidate A/Anhui/1/2013(H7N9)-CDC-LV7A (abbreviated as CDC-LV7A), based on the Russian MDV, A/Leningrad/134/17/57 (H2N2), was generated by classical reassortment in eggs and retained MDV temperature-sensitive and cold-adapted phenotypes. CDC-LV7A had two amino acid substitutions N123D and N149D (H7 numbering) in HA and one substitution T10I in NA. To evaluate the role of these mutations on the replication capacity of the reassortants in eggs, the recombinant viruses A(H7N9)RG-LV1 and A(H7N9)RG-LV2 were generated by reverse genetics. These changes did not alter virus antigenicity as ferret antiserum to CDC-LV7A vaccine candidate inhibited hemagglutination by homologous A(H7N9) virus efficiently. Safety studies in ferrets confirmed that CDC-LV7A was attenuated compared to wild-type A/Anhui/1/2013. In addition, the genetic stability of this vaccine candidate was examined in eggs and ferrets by monitoring sequence changes acquired during virus replication in the two host models. No changes in the viral genome were detected after five passages in eggs. However, after ten passages additional mutations were detected in the HA gene. The vaccine candidate was shown to be stable in the ferret model; post-vaccination sequence data analysis showed no changes in viruses collected in nasal washes present at day 5 or day 7. Conclusions/Significance Our data indicate that the A/Anhui/1/2013(H7N9)-CDC-LV7A reassortant virus is a safe and genetically stable candidate vaccine virus that is now available for distribution by WHO to vaccine manufacturers."
https://openalex.org/W2222120230,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) variants characterized by genomic deletions in the structural protein region have been sporadically detected in liver and serum of hepatitis C patients. These defective genomes are capable of autonomous RNA replication and are packaged into infectious viral particles in cells co-infected with the wild-type virus. The prevalence of such forms in the chronically HCV-infected population and the impact on the severity of liver disease or treatment outcome are currently unknown. In order to determine the prevalence of HCV defective variants and to study their association with clinical characteristics, a screening campaign was performed on pre-therapy serum samples from a well-characterized cohort of previously untreated genotype 1 HCV-infected patients who received treatment with PEG-IFNα and RBV. 132 subjects were successfully analyzed for the presence of defective species exploiting a long-distance nested PCR assay. HCV forms with deletions predominantly affecting E1, E2 and p7 proteins were found in a surprising high fraction of the subjects (25/132, 19%). Their presence was associated with patient older age, higher viral load and increased necroinflammatory activity in the liver. While the presence of circulating HCV carrying deletions in the E1-p7 region did not appear to significantly influence sustained virological response rates to PEG-IFNα/RBV, our study indicates that the presence of these subgenomic HCV mutants could be associated with virological relapse in patients who did not have detectable viremia at the end of the treatment."

The procedure presented here is on the basis of dual expression and ligation in vivo. Global fold, stability, and photodynamics were analyzed in detergent by CD, stationary, as well as time-resolved optical spectroscopy. The fold within lipid bilayers has been probed by high field and dynamic nuclear polarization-enhanced solid-state NMR utilizing a (13)C-labeled retinal cofactor and extensively (13)C-(15)N-labeled protein. Our data show unambiguously that the ligation product is identical to its non-ligated counterpart. Furthermore, our data highlight the effects of BC loop modifications onto the photocycle kinetics of proteorhodopsin. Our data demonstrate that a correctly folded and functionally intact protein can be produced in this artificial way. Our findings are of high relevance for a general understanding of the assembly of membrane proteins for elucidating intramolecular interactions, and they offer the possibility of developing novel labeling schemes for spectroscopic applications."

The pharmacology of OCT3 is distinct from that of other OCTs, and here we investigated the role of a hydrophobic cavity tucked within the translocation pathway in OCT3 transport properties. Replacement of an absolutely conserved Asp by charge reversal (D478E), neutralization (D478N), or even exchange (D478E) abolished MPP(+) uptake, demonstrating this residue to be obligatory for OCT3-mediated transport. Mutations at non-conserved residues lining the putative binding pocket of OCT3 to the corresponding residue in OCT1 (L166F, F450L, and E451Q) reduced the rate of MPP(+) transport, but recapitulated the higher sensitivity pharmacological profile of OCT1. Thus, interactions of natural polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, spermine) and polyamine-like potent OCT1 blockers (1,10-diaminodecane, decamethonium, bistriethylaminodecane, and 1,10-bisquinuclidinedecane) with wild-type OCT3 were weak, but were significantly potentiated in the mutant OCT3s. Conversely, a reciprocal mutation in OCT1 (F161L) shifted the polyamine-sensitivity phenotype toward that of OCT3. Further analysis indicated that OCT1 and OCT3 can recognize essentially the same substrates, but the strength of substrate-transporter interactions is weaker in OCT3, as informed by the distinct makeup of the hydrophobic cleft. The residues identified here are key contributors to both the observed differences between OCT3 and OCT1 and to the mechanisms of substrate recognition by OCTs in general."

PIKfyve, ArPIKfyve, and Sac3 are all evolutionarily conserved proteins encoded by single genes located on human chromosomes 2, 16, and 6, respectively (5.Shisheva A. PIKfyve and its lipid products in health and in sickness.Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2012; 362: 127-162PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, the binary ArPIKfyve-Sac3 complex, in addition to binding and activating PIKfyve, has a profound effect on stabilizing the Sac3 protein in the cytosol. This prevents rapid clearance of Sac3 by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, extending the half-life and increasing the steady-state levels of the phosphatase (6.Ikonomov O.C. Sbrissa D. Fligger J.

Furthermore, work by us and others has found that the primary molecular defect underlying the pathogenesis of hereditary demyelinating neuropathy CMT4J, a disease caused by compound heterozygosity with one null Sac3 allele and one missense Ile41-to-Thr mutation, is a failure in the ArPIKfyve-dependent protection mechanism toward the Sac3I41T mutant form (6.Ikonomov O.C.

Findings for alterations in steady-state levels of PtdIns(3,5)P2 in opposite directions in mouse models of CMT neuropathies triggered by disruptions of PtdIns(3,5)P2 phosphatases Sac3 and MTMR2, respectively, also fail to provide a coherent model for the role of PtdIns(3,5)P2 in the neuropathological mechanism (21.Chow C.Y.

We surmised that the soluble ArPIKfyve-Sac3 complex may have yet unknown PIKfyve-independent interactions with neuron-specific proteins that could underlie ArPIKfyve-Sac3 functionality in the nervous system. To this end, here we undertook a proteomic screen of mouse brain lysates using the ArPIKfyve-Sac3 complex as bait and unraveled α-synuclein-interacting protein Synphilin-1 (Sph1) (gene symbol SNCAIP) as a new interaction partner of the ArPIKfyve-Sac3 complex. Sph1, a predominantly neuronal protein that promotes aggregation of α-synuclein (α-Syn) (gene symbol SNCA), is a major component of inclusion bodies, or Lewy bodies, found in post mortem brain samples of neurodegenerative α-synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's and Lewy body dementia (23.Engelender S.

We further report that the ArPIKfyve-Sac3 complex has a profound ability to reduce the aggregation potential of Sph1 and shift the aggregated protein toward the soluble form. Remarkably, without ArPIKfyve elevation, overexpressed Sac3 itself readily aggregates, potentiating aggregation of Sph1. Our study has identified a novel mechanism of Sph1 aggregation controlled by the ArPIKfyve-Sac3 complex, suggesting that dysregulation of this mechanism may precipitate the onset of Lewy body pathologies and possibly other neurodegenerative disorders.

https://openalex.org/W2176206542,"The N-terminal domain of the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) harbors a large number of naturally occurring mutations that are associated with stress-induced ventricular tachyarrhythmia and sudden death. Nearly all these disease-associated N-terminal mutations are located at domain interfaces or buried within domains. Mutations at these locations would alter domain-domain interactions or the stability/folding of domains. Recently, a novel RyR2 mutation H29D associated with ventricular arrhythmia at rest was found to enhance the activation of single RyR2 channels by diastolic levels of cytosolic Ca2+. Unlike other N-terminal disease-associated mutations, the H29D mutation is located on the surface of the N-terminal domain. It is unclear how this surface-exposed H29D mutation that does not appear to interact with other parts of the RyR2 structure could alter the intrinsic properties of the channel. Here we carried out detailed functional characterization of the RyR2-H29D mutant at the molecular and cellular levels. We found that the H29D mutation has no effect on the basal level or the Ca2+ dependent activation of [3H]ryanodine binding to RyR2, the cytosolic Ca2+ activation of single RyR2 channels, or the cytosolic Ca2+- or caffeine-induced Ca2+ release in HEK293 cells. In addition, the H29D mutation does not alter the propensity for spontaneous Ca2+ release or the thresholds for Ca2+ release activation or termination. Furthermore, the H29D mutation does not have significant impact on the thermal stability of the N-terminal region (residues 1-547) of RyR2. Collectively, our data show that the H29D mutation exerts little or no effect on the function of RyR2 or on the folding stability of the N-terminal region. Thus, our results provide no evidence that the H29D mutation enhances the cytosolic Ca2+ activation of RyR2."

In the kidney, glomerulosclerosis is the underlying pathology in approximately half of patients with renal failure receiving dialysis. Mesangial cell expression of the LIM protein hydrogen peroxide-induced clone-5 (Hic-5) is important in its pathogenesis. Hic-5 expression increases following mesangial cell attachment to collagen I, associated with increased collagen I expression and increased susceptibility to apoptosis both in vitro and in experimental glomerulosclerosis. TGF-β has an established role in many fibrotic diseases, including glomerulosclerosis, where it increases collagen I deposition in vivo and promotes mesangial cell apoptosis in vitro. In other cell types, TGF-β induces Hic-5 expression. We investigated whether Hic-5-induced changes in mesangial cell phenotype were TGF-β-dependent. Adding exogenous TGF-β to mesangial cell cultures failed to increase Hic-5 expression; blocking TGF-β signaling did not reduce Hic-5 expression. However, inducing Hic-5 expression in mesangial cells by adhesion to collagen I led to TGF-β expression, which was abolished by small interfering RNA (siRNA) Hic-5 knockdown. Mesangial cells expressing Hic-5 showed altered latent TGF-β-binding protein expression and Smad signaling, with enhanced susceptibility to TGF-β-induced apoptosis. Mesangial cell attachment to collagen I led to increased Hic-5 expression within 2-4 h and increased procollagen I transcription within 12 h, whereas adding TGF-β to siRNA Hic-5 knockdown mesangial cells increased procollagen I transcription to a lesser degree after 48 h. Mesangial cell Hic-5 expression was associated with increased α-smooth muscle actin and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 expression. Taken together, these data indicate that there is a prosclerotic feedback loop in mesangial cells dependent on matrix-derived signals in which Hic-5 is a pivotal signaling protein. This feedback loop is TGF-β-independent. The role of TGF-β-dependent and -independent sclerotic pathways merit further investigation."
