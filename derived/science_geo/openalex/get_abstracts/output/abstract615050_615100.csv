https://openalex.org/W2883177195,"E-cigarettes are promoted as healthier alternatives to conventional cigarettes. Many cigarette smokers use both products. It is unknown whether the additional use of e-cigarettes among cigarette smokers (dual users) is associated with reduced exposure to tobacco-related health risks. Cross-sectional analysis was performed using baseline data from the Health eHeart Study, among English-speaking adults, mostly from the United States. Cigarette use (# cigarettes/day) and/or e-cigarette use (# days, # cartridges, and # puffs) were compared between cigarette only users vs. dual users. Additionally, we examined cardiopulmonary symptoms/ conditions across product use: no product (neither), e-cigarettes only, cigarettes only, and dual use. Among 39,747 participants, 573 (1.4%) reported e-cigarette only use, 1,693 (4.3%) reported cigarette only use, and 514 (1.3%) dual use. Dual users, compared to cigarette only users, reported a greater median (IQR) number of cigarettes per day, 10.0 (4.0–20.0) vs. 9.0 (3.0–15.0) (p < .0001), a lower (worse) median (IQR) SF-12 general health score, 3.3 (2.8–3.8) vs. 3.5 (2.8–3.9) (p = .0014), and a higher (worse) median (IQR) breathing difficulty score in the past month, 2.0 (1.0–2.0) vs. 1.0 (1.0–2.0) (p = .001). Of the 19 cardiopulmonary symptoms/ conditions, having a history of arrhythmia was significantly different between cigarette only users (14.2%) and dual users (17.8%) (p = .02). In this sample, dual use was not associated with reduced exposure to either (i) cigarettes, compared to cigarette only users or (ii) e-cigarettes, compared to e-cigarette only users. E-cigarette only use, compared to no product use, was associated with lower general health scores, higher breathing difficulty scores (typically and past month), and greater proportions of those who responded ‘yes’ to having chest pain, palpitations, coronary heart disease, arrhythmia, COPD, and asthma. These data suggest the added use of e-cigarettes alone may have contributed to cardiopulmonary health risks particularly respiratory health risks."
https://openalex.org/W2883297874,"Social norms theory has become prominent framework for understanding the perpetuation of female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C), and has influenced the design of interventions aimed at stopping the practice. Theoretical advances draw attention to the fact that FGM/C is often upheld by multiple interconnected norms that may vary and shift over time, offering a potential resource for social transformation. Analyzing focus group data from Senegambian women, the questions we explore are: What are the constellation of norms associated with FGM/C? When are existing practices and norms being contested, and how does this reflect prevailing structures of power and authority? Our research identifies four overarching themes: 1) pressure to conform with FGM/C arising from sanctions such as ostracization, and moral norms linked to the embodiment of virtue; 2) upholding tradition as a means of venerating ancestors; 3) upholding social hierarchy by displaying respect for elders; and 4) shifting beliefs about the healthful vs. harmful nature of FGM/C. While strong value is placed on upholding tradition, there is also an appreciation that elements of tradition must be revised to meet fluctuating realities, including the novel threat of HIV infection. Moreover, older women are uniquely positioned to realize the dual goal of honoring tradition while negotiating change. Rather than resisting change, we find that some older women express an openness to reassessing norms and practices as they seek solutions to maintaining the physical well-being, moral integrity and cultural identity of girls in their families. Moreover, given the authority of older women over younger women, they also have power to negotiate change. By recognizing older women as potential change leaders, and drawing on variability and fluidity in social norms, it may be increasingly possible to design interventions that will shape possibilities for action and accelerate abandonment of FGM/C without undermining the cultural value of tradition."
https://openalex.org/W2883476902,"Surface mining for coal has taken place in the Central Appalachian region of the United States for well over a century, with a notable increase since the 1970s. Researchers have quantified the ecosystem and health impacts stemming from mining, relying in part on a geospatial dataset defining surface mining’s extent at a decadal interval. This dataset, however, does not deliver the temporal resolution necessary to support research that could establish causal links between mining activity and environmental or public health and safety outcomes, nor has it been updated since 2005. Here we use Google Earth Engine and Landsat imagery to map the yearly extent of surface coal mining in Central Appalachia from 1985 through 2015, making our processing models and output data publicly available. We find that 2,900 km2 of land has been newly mined over this 31-year period. Adding this more-recent mining to surface mines constructed prior to 1985, we calculate a cumulative mining footprint of 5,900 km2. Over the study period, correlating active mine area with historical surface mine coal production shows that each metric ton of coal is associated with 12 m2 of actively mined land. Our automated, open-source model can be regularly updated as new surface mining occurs in the region and can be refined to capture mining reclamation activity into the future. We freely and openly offer the data for use in a range of environmental, health, and economic studies; moreover, we demonstrate the capability of using tools like Earth Engine to analyze years of remotely sensed imagery over spatially large areas to quantify land use change."
https://openalex.org/W2883627569,"It has been argued that gender essentialism impedes progress towards greater gender equality. Here we present a new gender essentialism scale (GES), and validate it in two large nationally representative samples from Denmark and Australia. In both samples the GES was highly reliable and predicted lack of support for sex-role egalitarianism and support for gender discrimination, as well as perceived fairness of gender-based treatment in the Australian sample, independently of two established predictors (i.e., social dominance orientation and conservative political orientation). In addition, gender essentialism assessed by the GES moderated some manifestations of the backlash effect: high essentialists were more likely to respond negatively towards a power-seeking female political candidate relative to a male candidate. Given the implications for possible workplace interventions, further work could usefully explore whether gender essentialism moderates other well-established forms of gender bias."

https://openalex.org/W2884624416,"Lipid droplets are specialized cellular organelles that contain neutral lipid metabolites and play dynamic roles in energy homeostasis. Perilipin 1 (Plin1), one of the major lipid droplet-binding proteins, is highly expressed in adipocytes. In mice, Plin1 deficiency impairs peripheral insulin sensitivity, accompanied with reduced fat mass. However, the mechanisms underlying insulin resistance in lean Plin1 knockout (Plin1−/−) mice are largely unknown. The current study demonstrates that Plin1 deficiency promotes inflammatory responses and lipolysis in adipose tissue, resulting in insulin resistance. M1-type adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) were higher in Plin1−/− than in Plin1+/+ mice on normal chow diet. Moreover, using lipidomics analysis, we discovered that Plin1−/− adipocytes promoted secretion of pro-inflammatory lipid metabolites such as prostaglandins, which potentiated monocyte migration. In lean Plin1−/− mice, insulin resistance was relieved by macrophage depletion with clodronate, implying that elevated pro-inflammatory ATMs might be attributable for insulin resistance under Plin1 deficiency. Together, these data suggest that Plin1 is required to restrain fat loss and pro-inflammatory responses in adipose tissue by reducing futile lipolysis to maintain metabolic homeostasis.

Although PLIN1 binds to comparative gene identification-58 (CGI-58), a coactivator of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) in the basal state, PLIN1 liberates CGI-58 to induce lipolysis upon protein kinase A activation during the stimulated state (27Granneman J.G.

It has been reported that Plin1−/− mice are lean and exhibit glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in the absence of any metabolic stress (24Tansey J.T. Sztalryd C. Gruia-Gray J. Roush D.L. Zee J.V. Gavrilova O. Reitman M.L. Deng C.X. Li C. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. Perilipin ablation results in a lean mouse with aberrant adipocyte lipolysis, enhanced leptin production, and resistance to diet-induced obesity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

However, the molecular mechanisms of insulin resistance in normal chow diet (NCD)-fed lean Plin1−/− mice have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated NCD-fed lean Plin1−/− mice to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying insulin resistance under Plin1 deficiency. We demonstrate that Plin1 deficiency stimulates pro-inflammatory responses in adipose tissue by secreting pro-inflammatory lipid metabolites, which exacerbate adipose tissue inflammation. Using lipidomics analysis, we found that elevated prostaglandins (PGs) from Plin1−/− adipocytes potentiated monocyte migration. In addition, depletion of ATMs with clodronate alleviated insulin resistance in Plin1-deficient mice, implying that an increase in pro-inflammatory ATMs is one of the major inducers for insulin resistance in Plin1−/− mice. Together, these data suggest that Plin1 is an important protective regulator against adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance by restricting futile lipolysis. Plin1 expression is decreased in adipose tissue from insulin-resistant animals (28Gaidhu M.P. Anthony N.M. Patel P. Hawke T.J. Ceddia R.B. Dysregulation of lipolysis and lipid metabolism in visceral and subcutaneous adipocytes by high-fat diet: role of ATGL, HSL, and AMPK.Am. J. Physiol.

Consistent with this finding, the levels of Plin1 mRNA and protein were lower in adipocytes from db/db mice and adipose tissue from high fat diet-fed mice than in those from db/+ mice and NCD-fed mice (Fig. 1, A and B). Nonetheless, it remained unclear how Plin1 deficiency could influence whole-body energy homeostasis. To address this, we investigated various physiological parameters in Plin1−/− mice in C57BL/6J background (24Tansey J.T. Sztalryd C. Gruia-Gray J. Roush D.L. Zee J.V. Gavrilova O. Reitman M.L. Deng C.X. Li C. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. Perilipin ablation results in a lean mouse with aberrant adipocyte lipolysis, enhanced leptin production, and resistance to diet-induced obesity.Proc. Natl.

Under NCD-fed conditions, body weights were not significantly different between Plin1+/+ and Plin1−/− mice (Fig. 1C). However, inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) and epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) weights, but neither liver nor brown adipose tissue weights, were lower in Plin1−/− than in Plin1+/+ mice (Fig. 1D). In addition, serum TG and FFAs, but not cholesterol, were slightly higher in Plin1−/− than in Plin1+/+ mice (Fig. 1, E–G). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of eWAT revealed that lipid droplets were smaller in size in Plin1−/− than in Plin1+/+ mice (Fig. 1H). Interestingly, the intensity of CD11b staining in eWAT of NCD-fed Plin1−/− mice was markedly increased (Fig. 1I), suggesting that Plin1 deficiency might be associated with adipose tissue inflammation in lean animals. In adipose tissue, macrophages are one of the abundant cell types and determine the degree of fat tissue inflammation (4Weisberg S.P. McCann D. Desai M. Rosenbaum M. Leibel R.L. Ferrante Jr., A.W. Obesity is associated with macrophage accumulation in adipose tissue.J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112 (14679176): 1796-180810.1172/JCI200319246Crossref PubMed Scopus (7435) Google Scholar, 5Xu H.

Invest. 2003; 112 (14679177): 1821-183010.1172/JCI200319451Crossref PubMed Scopus (5172) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Plin1 deficiency might be related with adipose tissue inflammation, we examined inflammatory gene expression and macrophage accumulation in eWAT from NCD-fed Plin1+/+ and Plin1−/− mice. As shown in Fig. 2A, Plin1-deficient eWAT had markedly increased mRNA levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine genes including Mcp-1 and Tnfα as well as of the macrophage marker genes such as F4/80 and Cd11c. In addition, serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as MCP-1 and TNFα were induced in Plin1−/− mice (Fig. 2B). In eWAT of Plin1−/− mice, CD11b+ and CD11c+ cells were increased (Fig. 2C). Also, Plin1 deficiency elevated the percentages of F4/80+CD11b+ (macrophages) and F4/80+CD11b+CD11c+ cells (M1-type macrophages) among stromal vascular cells (SVCs) from eWAT (Fig. 2, D and E). Total numbers of F4/80+CD11b+ and F4/80+CD11b+CD11c+ cells (Fig. 2, F and G) were higher in eWAT of Plin1−/− than in that of Plin1+/+ mice. Moreover, the percentage of M1-type CD11c+ cells in F4/80+CD11b+ macrophages was higher in Plin1−/− than in Plin1+/+ mice (Fig. 2H), whereas the fraction of M2-type CD206+ macrophages in F4/80+CD11b+ cells was lower in Plin1−/− mice (Fig. 2I). Collectively, these results suggested that Plin1 might play certain roles in the regulation of adipose tissue inflammation as well as ATM recruitment. In adipose tissue, infiltration of immune cells including monocytes or macrophages and increased pro-inflammatory responses in macrophages are prominent in insulin-resistant animals (29Fujisaka S. Usui I. Bukhari A. Ikutani M. Oya T. Kanatani Y. Tsuneyama K. Nagai Y. Takatsu K. Urakaze M. Kobayashi M. Tobe K. Regulatory mechanisms for adipose tissue M1 and M2 macrophages in diet-induced obese mice.Diabetes. 2009; 58 (19690061): 2574-258210.2337/db08-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 30Oh D.Y. Morinaga H. Talukdar S. Bae E.J. Olefsky J.M.

To determine whether Plin1 deficiency might be involved in the regulation of monocyte/macrophage migration, conditioned media (CM) obtained from ex vivo cultured eWAT of Plin1−/− and Plin1+/+ mice were incubated with THP-1 monocytes or peritoneal macrophages (Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3, B and C, the degrees of THP-1 and macrophage migration were higher in CM from Plin1−/− eWAT than in CM from Plin1+/+ eWAT. Similarly, stimulatory effects were observed when CM were collected from primary Plin1−/− adipocytes in monocyte migration assays (Fig. 3, A and D). Next, we used a Transwell co-culture system to test whether macrophage gene expression might be affected by Plin1 deficiency in eWAT or adipocytes (Fig. 3E). Relative mRNA levels of the pro-inflammatory response genes including Il-6, iNOS, and Il-1β were stimulated in macrophages when they were indirectly co-cultured with eWAT from Plin1−/− mice (Fig. 3F). Primary adipocytes from Plin1−/− mice also promoted the mRNA levels of these factors in macrophages (Fig. 3G). However, Plin1−/− macrophages and Plin1+/+ macrophages did not show any difference in inflammatory gene expression (Fig. 3H). These results indicated that Plin1 would act as a protective factor against adipose tissue inflammation, at least in part by inhibiting the secretion of certain signaling molecule(s) that promote the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and monocyte migration. In adipocytes, Plin1 is a key player to modulate lipolysis (24Tansey J.T. Sztalryd C. Gruia-Gray J. Roush D.L. Zee J.V. Gavrilova O. Reitman M.L. Deng C.X. Li C. Kimmel A.R. Londos C.

To determine whether the inhibitory effect of Plin1 on lipolysis might be associated with monocyte migration, we first examined the effect of Plin1 deficiency on the release of lipolytic metabolites in culture media. As expected, Plin1−/− adipocytes secreted higher amounts of glycerol and FFAs than Plin1+/+ adipocytes (Fig. 4, A and B). On the other hand, Plin1-deficient adipocytes showed little or no effect on MCP-1 secretion (Fig. 4C). Moreover, to examine whether increased monocyte migration upon Plin1 deficiency depends on secretory proteins from adipocytes, CM from SVC-derived adipocytes was subjected to heat inactivation (31Ayache S. Panelli M.C. Byrne K.M. Slezak S. Leitman S.F. Marincola F.M. Stroncek D.F. Comparison of proteomic profiles of serum, plasma, and modified media supplements used for cell culture and expansion.J. Transl. Med. 2006; 4 (17020621): 4010.1186/1479-5876-4-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Heat-inactivated CM from Plin1−/− adipocytes did not significantly alter the degree of monocyte migration compared with CM from Plin1−/− adipocytes (Fig. 4D). These data imply that increased monocyte migration upon Plin1 deficiency might not be associated with secreted chemokines from adipocytes. To investigate whether enhanced lipolysis in Plin1-deficient adipocytes might be attributable to monocyte migration, two key lipases, Atgl and Hsl, were knocked down via siRNA in SVC-derived adipocytes (Fig. 4, E and F). Basal lipolysis was markedly higher in Plin1−/− SVC-derived adipocytes than in Plin1+/+ SVC-derived adipocytes (Fig. 4G). In Plin1−/− SVC-derived adipocytes, knockdown of Atgl and Hsl attenuated basal lipolysis (Fig. 4G). Intriguingly, the degree of monocyte migration was lower upon suppression of these lipases (Fig. 4H). Together, these results suggested that adipocyte Plin1 would suppress adipose tissue inflammation through repressing basal lipolysis. Certain lipid metabolites, including leukotriene B4, PGD2, and PGE2, promote monocyte/macrophage migration (18Li P. Oh D.Y. Bandyopadhyay G. Lagakos W.S. Talukdar S. Osborn O. Johnson A. Chung H.

To identify potential secreted mediator(s) that can potentiate monocyte migration in adipose tissue of Plin1−/− mice, CM of adipocytes was subjected to lipidomic analysis by nontargeted LC-MS/MS (Table S1). The level of eicosanoids appeared to be higher in the CM of Plin1−/− adipocytes than in that of Plin1+/+ adipocytes. We took a targeted lipidomics approach to determine the relative quantity of eicosanoids secreted from adipocytes (Fig. 5A). The level of PGE2 was higher in the CM of Plin1−/− adipocytes than in that of Plin1+/+ adipocytes (Fig. 5B). Because cyclooxygenase (COX) isoenzymes produce PGs from arachidonic acid (AA) (Fig. 5C), intracellular AA was examined in adipocytes. As indicated in Fig. 5D, the level of AA appeared to be higher in Plin1−/− than in Plin1+/+ adipocytes. Eukaryotic COX has two isoforms, Co"

https://openalex.org/W2884825769,"The TMPRSS2:ERG (T:E) fusion gene is generally believed to be mainly regulated by the activated androgen receptor (AR) signaling in androgen-dependent prostate cancer. However, its persistent expression in castration-resistant and neuroendocrine prostate cancers implies that other transcription factors might also regulate its expression. Here, we showed that up-regulation of nuclear receptor estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRα) was closely associated with the oncogenic transcription factor ERG expression in prostate cancer, and their increased coexpression patterns were closely associated with high Gleason scores and metastasis in patients. Both ERRα and ERG exhibited a positive expression correlation in a castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) xenograft model VCaP-CRPC. We showed that ERRα could directly transactivate T:E fusion gene in both AR-positive and -negative prostate cancer cells via both ERR-binding element- and AR-binding element-dependent manners. Ectopic T:E expression under ERRα regulation could promote both in vitro invasion and in vivo metastasis capacities of AR-negative prostatic cells. Intriguingly, ERG expressed by the T:E fusion could also transactivate the ERRα (ESRRA) gene. Hereby, ERRα and ERG can synergistically regulate each other and form a reciprocal regulatory loop to promote the advanced growth of prostate cancer. Inhibition of ERRα activity by ERRα inverse agonist could suppress T:E expression in prostate cancer cells, implicating that targeting ERRα could be a potential therapeutic strategy for treating the aggressive T:E-positive prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2883625945,"High throughput screening (HTS) projects like the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's ToxCast program are required to address the large and rapidly increasing number of chemicals for which we have little to no toxicity measurements. Concentration-response parameters such as potency and efficacy are extracted from HTS data using nonlinear regression, and models and analyses built from these parameters are used to predict in vivo and in vitro toxicity of thousands of chemicals. How these predictions are impacted by uncertainties that stem from parameter estimation and propagated through the models and analyses has not been well explored. While data size and complexity makes uncertainty quantification computationally expensive for HTS datasets, continued advancements in computational resources have allowed these computational challenges to be met. This study uses nonparametric bootstrap resampling to calculate uncertainties in concentration-response parameters from a variety of HTS assays. Using the ToxCast estrogen receptor model for bioactivity as a case study, we highlight how these uncertainties can be propagated through models to quantify the uncertainty in model outputs. Uncertainty quantification in model outputs is used to identify potential false positives and false negatives and to determine the distribution of model values around semi-arbitrary activity cutoffs, increasing confidence in model predictions. At the individual chemical-assay level, curves with high variability are flagged for manual inspection or retesting, focusing subject-matter-expert time on results that need further input. This work improves the confidence of predictions made using HTS data, increasing the ability to use this data in risk assessment."
https://openalex.org/W2883533188,"Lactoperoxidase (LPO) is an enzyme found in several exocrine secretions including the airway surface liquid producing antimicrobial substances from mainly halide and pseudohalide substrates. Although the innate immune function of LPO has been documented against several microbes, a detailed characterization of its mechanism of action against influenza viruses is still missing. Our aim was to study the antiviral effect and substrate specificity of LPO to inactivate influenza viruses using a cell-free experimental system. Inactivation of different influenza virus strains was measured in vitro system containing LPO, its substrates, thiocyanate (SCN-) or iodide (I-), and the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-producing system, glucose and glucose oxidase (GO). Physiologically relevant concentrations of the components of the LPO/H2O2/(SCN-/I-) antimicrobial system were exposed to twelve different strains of influenza A and B viruses in vitro and viral inactivation was assessed by determining plaque-forming units of non-inactivated viruses using Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK) cells. Our data show that LPO is capable of inactivating all influenza virus strains tested: H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 influenza A viruses (IAV) and influenza B viruses (IBV) of both, Yamagata and Victoria lineages. The extent of viral inactivation, however, varied among the strains and was in part dependent on the LPO substrate. Inactivation of H1N1 and H1N2 viruses by LPO showed no substrate preference, whereas H3N2 influenza strains were inactivated significantly more efficiently when iodide, not thiocyanate, was the LPO substrate. Although LPO-mediated inactivation of the influenza B strains tested was strain-dependent, it showed slight preference towards thiocyanate as the substrate. The results presented here show that the LPO/H2O2/(SCN-/I-) cell-free, in vitro experimental system is a functional tool to study the specificity, efficiency and the molecular mechanism of action of influenza inactivation by LPO. These studies tested the hypothesis that influenza strains are all susceptible to the LPO-based antiviral system but exhibit differences in their substrate specificities. We propose that a LPO-based antiviral system is an important contributor to anti-influenza virus defense of the airways."

Notch3 has a distinct structure, and its NICD is different from that of Notch1 and -2, indicating a potentially unique physiological role for Notch3 (27Bellavia D. Checquolo S. Campese A.F. Felli M.P. Gulino A. Screpanti I.

However, knowledge regarding the actions of Notch3 in the skeleton is limited. Lateral meningocele syndrome (LMS) or Lehman syndrome (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man 130720) is a rare genetic disorder that presents with neuromuscular dysfunction, meningoceles, and distinct facial features (28Lehman R.A. Stears J.C. Wesenberg R.L. Nusbaum E.D. Familial osteosclerosis with abnormalities of the nervous system and meninges.J.

The clinical features of LMS include developmental delay, decreased muscle mass, and cardiac valve defects. Skeletal abnormalities are frequent, including thickening of the calvarial vault, craniofacial defects, short stature, scoliosis, and bone loss (29Gripp K.W. Scott Jr., C.I. Hughes H.E.

Exome-wide sequencing of individuals affected by LMS demonstrated the presence of mutations in exon 33 of NOTCH3. These mutations create a stop codon so that the PEST domain is not translated (31Gripp K.W. Robbins K.M. Sobreira N.L. Witmer P.D. Bird L.M. Avela K. Makitie O. Alves D. Hogue J.S. Zackai E.H. Doheny K.F. Stabley D.L. Sol-Church K. Truncating mutations in the last exon of NOTCH3 cause lateral meningocele syndrome.Am. J. Med. Genet. A. 2015; 167A (25394726): 271-28110.1002/ajmg.a.36863Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Because the PEST domain is necessary for the ubiquitination and degradation of NOTCH3, the NOTCH3 NICD is presumably stable, resulting in persistent signaling and gain of function. Despite the skeletal manifestations reported in LMS, there is limited knowledge about the mechanisms that operate or the actions of NOTCH3 in the skeleton. The purpose of the present work was to provide an understanding of the skeletal manifestations of LMS and responsible mechanisms. For this purpose, a mouse (Notch3tm1.1Ecan) model reproducing the NOTCH3 mutation harbored by subjects affected by LMS was engineered. To create an LMS mutant mouse, we introduced a tandem termination codon, ACCAAG→TAATGA, into exon 33 of the Notch3 gene at bp 6691–6696 from the start of translation. In the present work, we report the skeletal phenotype and underlying mechanisms of Notch3tm1.1Ecan mice. The RNA-guided clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-associated Cas9 nuclease system was used to target exon 33 of Notch3 and introduce a TAATGA tandem termination codon at positions 6691–6696 from the start of translation (32Wang H.

This genetic intervention leads to the translation of the truncated NOTCH3 protein T2231X consisting of 2230 amino acids (versus 2318 in WT). Single guide (sg) RNA, designed to cleave between nucleotides 6691 and 6692 of Notch3, and a single-strand DNA containing the tandem stop codon TAATGA were coinjected into C57BL/6J one-cell embryos with Cas9 mRNA (Fig. 1). The proper insertion of the Notch3 6691–6696 ACCAAG→TAATGA mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing of F1 mice (Fig. 1). Heterozygous mutant mice were compared with sex-matched WT littermates in a C57BL/6J genetic background. Breeding between heterozygous LMS mutant and WT mice yielded offsprings composed of 55% WT and 45% heterozygous Notch3tm1.1Ecan mice. Notch3tm1.1Ecan mice appeared healthy, did not exhibit overt neuromuscular signs, and were fertile. Percent body fat, fasting serum insulin and glucose levels, and serum 17β-estradiol and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were not different between Notch3tm1.1Ecan and controls (Table 1). One-month-old heterozygous Notch3tm1.1Ecan mice did not appear different from controls and had a weight that was ∼10% lower than controls. However, the difference in weight was less pronounced as the mice matured, and at 4 months of age Notch3tm1.1Ecan mice weighed ∼5% less than control littermates. Femoral length was slightly shorter in Notch3tm1.1Ecan mice at 1 month but not at 4 months of age when femoral length was not different from controls (Fig. S1).Table 1Percent body fat and hormonal/metabolic parameters in 4-month-old Notch3tm1.1Ecan mutant male and female mice and sex-matched control littermatesMalesFemalesControlNotch3tm1.1EcanControlNotch3tm1.1EcanBody fat (%)17.9 ±w 0.817.6 ± 0.620.0 ± 0.421.5 ± 0.7Glucose (mg/dl)88 ± 284 ± 191 ± 286 ± 2Insulin (μIU/ml)114 ± 7132 ± 6120 ± 36110 ± 20PTH (pg/ml)426 ± 65322 ± 107325 ± 89294 ± 8217βE2 (pg/ml)37 ± 442 ± 8 Open table in a new tab Microcomputed tomography (μCT) of the distal femur demonstrated that 1-month-old male and female Notch3tm1.1Ecan mutant mice had a 35–60% decrease in cancellous bone volume (Table 2 and Figure 2., Figure 3.). The decreased cancellous bone was associated with decreased trabecular number and connectivity and higher structure model index, indicating a predominance of rodlike trabeculae. Trabecular thickness was not affected. Cortical bone was thin and porous in 1-month-old Notch3tm1.1Ecan mutant mice of both sexes, although total bone area was not different from controls, indicating normal bone size (Table 2 and Figure 2., Figure 3.). The decrease in trabecular bone volume was sustained and observed in 4-month-old male, but not female, Notch3tm1.1Ecan mutant mice. Male mice had a significant decrease in cancellous bone volume of ∼30% associated with decreased trabecular number and connectivity. However, cortical bone was not altered in Notch3tm1.1Ecan mice of either sex (Table 2).Table 2Femoral microarchitecture assessed by μCT of 1- and 4-month-old Notch3tm1.1Ecan mutant male and female sex-matched mice and control littermatesFigure 2.Femoral architecture assessed by μCT of distal femora from 1-month-old male (A) and female (B) Notch3tm1.1Ecan mutant (black bars) and control littermates (white bars) mice.

There was an ∼2-fold increase in the number of osteoblasts and in osteoblast surface/bone surface in Notch3tm1.1Ecan mutant mice of both sexes as well as a 13–33% increase in osteocyte cell density. The higher osteoblast number was associated with an increase in mineral apposition rate in male Notch3tm1.1Ecan mutant mice and a nonsignificant (1.8–2.1-fold) increase in bone formation rate. Osteoclast surface/bone surface was increased in male Notch3tm1.1Ecan mutant mice, but osteoclast number/bone perimeter was not affected significantly in either sex. At 4 months of age, the cellular phenotype in male mutant mice was sustained, and they exhibited decreased bone volume/tissue volume associated with a 60% increase in osteoblast number and elevated bone formation rate when compared with WT sex-matched littermate mice (Table 4). However, neither osteoclast surface nor osteoclast number was significantly affected in Notch3tm1.1Ecan mice. These results suggest that Notch3tm1.1Ecan mice have a higher number of osteoblasts, possibly as a manifestation of high bone remodeling, but the cells are not sufficiently active to maintain skeletal homeostasis.Table 3Cancellous bone histomorphometry of 1-month-old Notch3tm1.1Ecan mutant male and female mice and sex-matched control littermatesMalesFemalesControl (n = 6)Notch3tm1.1Ecan (n = 6)Control (n = 7)Notch3tm1.1Ecan (n = 7)Static histomorphometryBone volume/tissue volume (%)14.2 ± 3.19.8 ± 2.6aSignificantly different between control and Notch3tm1.1Ecan, p < 0.05 by unpaired t test.10.3 ± 1.57.5 ± 2.3aSignificantly different between control and Notch3tm1.1Ecan, p < 0.05 by unpaired t test.Trabecular separation (μm)226 ± 48307 ± 66aSignificantly different between control and Notch3tm1.1Ecan, p < 0.05 by unpaired t test.268 ± 40427 ± 182aSignificantly different between control and Notch3tm1.1Ecan, p < 0.05 by unpaired t test.Trabecular number (1/mm)3.9 ± 0.73.0 ± 0.5aSignificantly different between control and Notch3tm1.1Ecan, p < 0.05 by unpaired t test.3.4 ± 0.62.4 ± 0.7aSignificantly different between control and Notch3tm1.1Ecan, p < 0.05 by unpaired t test.Trabecular thickness (μm)36.0 ± 3.432.1 ± 6.130.4 ± 2.831.0 ± 4.8Osteoblast surface/bone surface (%)10.5 ± 6.825.4 ± 7.6aSignificantly different between control and Notch3tm1.1Ecan, p < 0.05 by unpaired t test.12.1 ± 6.221.6 ± 7.7aSignificantly different between control and Notch3tm1.1Ecan, p < 0.05 by unpaired t test.Osteoblasts/bone perimeter (1/mm)10.3 ± 6.624.5 ± 7.2aSignificantly different between control and Notch3tm1.1Ecan, p < 0.05 by unpaired t test.11.9 ± 5.920.3 ± 6.6aSignificantly different between control and Notch3tm1.1Ecan, p < 0.05 by unpaired t test.Osteoid surface/bone surface (%)1.2 ± 1.43.5 ± 2.41.0 ± 0.92.4 ± 1.6Osteocytes (mm2)565 ± 46751 ± 151aSignificantly different between control and Notch3tm1.1Ecan, p < 0.05 by unpaired t test.628 ± 29710 ± 84aSignificantly different between control and Notch3tm1.1Ecan, p < 0.05 by unpaired t test.Osteoclast surface/bone surface (%)13.9 ± 5.920.3 ± 4.2bp < 0.055.20.5 ± 3.323.7 ± 4.1Osteoclasts/bone perimeter (1/mm)6.6 ± 1.48.0 ± 1.77.9 ± 1.18.7 ± 1.9Eroded surface/bone surface (%)8.3 ± 5.86.1 ± 2.36.2 ± 2.47.5 ± 2.2Dynamic histomorphometryMineral apposition rate (μm/day)2.3 ± 0.34.0 ± 0.8aSignificantly different between control and Notch3tm1.1Ecan, p < 0.05 by unpaired t test.2.9 ± 0.93.9 ± 1.2Mineralizing surface/bone surface (%)2.9 ± 0.73.8 ± 2.54.1 ± 2.06.0 ± 3.5Bone formation rate (μm3/μm2/day)0.07 ± 0.020.15 ± 0.090.12 ± 0.060.21 ± 0.09a Significantly different between control and Notch3tm1.1Ecan, p < 0.05 by unpaired t test.b p < 0.055.

https://openalex.org/W2883767236,"Subtype C HIV-1 is responsible for the largest proportion of people living with HIV-1 infection. However, there is limited information about the roles of the brain and its cell types as a potential sanctuary for this subtype and how the sanctuary may be affected by the administration of anti-retroviral therapy (ART). To address this issue, we collected postmortem brain tissues from ART treated HIV-1 infected Zambian individuals who experienced complete viral suppression and those who did not. Tissues from various brain compartments were collected from each individual as frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin embedded brain specimens, for detection and quantification of HIV-1 genomes and identification of the infected cell type. Genomic DNA and RNA were extracted from frozen brain tissues. The extracted DNA and RNA were then subjected to droplet digital PCR for HIV-1 quantification. RNA/DNAscope in situ hybridization (ISH) for HIV-1 was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded brain tissues in conjugation with immunohistochemistry to identify the infected cell types. Droplet digital PCR revealed that HIV-1 gag DNA and RNA were detectable in half of the cases studied regardless of ART success or failure. The presence of HIV-1 lacked specific tissue compartmentalization since detection was random among various brain tissues. When combined with immunohistochemistry, RNA/DNAscope ISH demonstrated co-localization of HIV-1 DNA with CD68 expressing cells indicative of microglia or peripheral macrophage. Our study showed that brain is a potential sanctuary for subtype C HIV-1, as HIV-1 can be detected in the brain of infected individuals irrespective of ART treatment outcome and no compartmentalization of HIV-1 to specific brain compartments was evident."
https://openalex.org/W2883849461,"Background The lack of accessible and structured documentation creates major barriers for investigators interested in understanding, properly interpreting and analyzing cohort data and biological samples. Providing the scientific community with open information is essential to optimize usage of these resources. A cataloguing toolkit is proposed by Maelstrom Research to answer these needs and support the creation of comprehensive and user-friendly study- and network-specific web-based metadata catalogues. Methods Development of the Maelstrom Research cataloguing toolkit was initiated in 2004. It was supported by the exploration of existing catalogues and standards, and guided by input from partner initiatives having used or pilot tested incremental versions of the toolkit. Results The cataloguing toolkit is built upon two main components: a metadata model and a suite of open-source software applications. The model sets out specific fields to describe study profiles; characteristics of the subpopulations of participants; timing and design of data collection events; and datasets/variables collected at each data collection event. It also includes the possibility to annotate variables with different classification schemes. When combined, the model and software support implementation of study and variable catalogues and provide a powerful search engine to facilitate data discovery. Conclusions The Maelstrom Research cataloguing toolkit already serves several national and international initiatives and the suite of software is available to new initiatives through the Maelstrom Research website. With the support of new and existing partners, we hope to ensure regular improvements of the toolkit."

The Microsoft Kinect v1 and v2 technologies apply depth information and machine vision techniques to generate 3D coordinates of a set of anatomical landmarks on the human body regarded as Kinect joints. Trigonometry relationship between Kinect joints can be used to extract body Range of Motion (ROM). The purpose of this study was to evaluate stability of Kinect for ROM measurement during static stretching exercises. According to the literature, the stability of Kinect in static exercises has been reported to a limited extent. 13 healthy men participated in this study and performed 5 exercises in 2 different distances from the cameras. Exercises were recorded by Kinect v1 and Kinect v2, concurrently. The stability of Kinect was also evaluated for 5 ROMs including: elbow flexion, shoulder abduction, wrist pronation, wrist flexion, and wrist ulnar deviation. Maximum and average joint displacement errors were used for stability analysis. Results showed that Kinect v2 is more stable compared to Kinect v1. Kinect v2 joints showed displacement error of more than 15 mm for wrist. For the other joints, Kinect showed an average displacement error of less than 10 mm."
https://openalex.org/W2883680635,"The accumulation of acquired mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) mutations with aging in somatic cells has been implicated in mitochondrial dysfunction and linked to age-onset diseases in humans. Here, we asked if somatic mtDNA mutations are also associated with aging in the mouse. MtDNA integrity in multiple organs and tissues in young and old (2-34 months) wild type (wt) mice was investigated by whole genome sequencing. Remarkably, no acquired somatic mutations were detected in tested tissues. However, we identified several non-synonymous germline mtDNA variants whose heteroplasmy levels (ratio of normal to mutant mtDNA) increased significantly with aging suggesting clonal expansion of inherited mtDNA mutations. Polg mutator mice, a model for premature aging, exhibited both germline and somatic mtDNA mutations whose numbers and heteroplasmy levels increased significantly with age implicating involvement in premature aging. Our results suggest that, in contrast to humans, acquired somatic mtDNA mutations do not accompany the aging process in wt mice."
https://openalex.org/W2884399973,"This study aimed to: (i) examine whether the speed synchronization and physical performance of an elite football team changed between the first and the second half, using match time blocks of 15-min, and (ii) explore the match-to-match variation of players' speed synchronization performance. Twenty-eight outfield elite footballers participated in 51 official matches. Positional data were gathered and used to calculate the total distance covered as a physical workload indicator. For all the outfield teammate dyad combinations (45 pairs), it was processed the percentage of time that players' speed was synchronized during walking, jogging and running using relative phase (Hilbert Transform). Also, the match-to-match variation of the players' speed synchronization, expressed in coefficient of variation was computed. The differences in the total distance covered from all players within the different match's time block periods revealed a moderate decrease in the distance covered in the last 15-min of the match compared to the first 15-min (-6.5; ±1.07%, most likely: change in means with 95% confidence limits). However, when compared the last minutes from both halves a small increase was observed (2.7; ±1.2%, likely) from first to second half. The synchronization of the players' speed displacements revealed small to moderate decreases in the % of synchronization in the second half periods for the jogging and running speed, while the opposite was found for the walking speed (~13 to 24% more, most likely). The playing position analysis for the walking zone showed similar trends between the groups, with small to moderate higher values in the second half, with the exception of [30'-45'] vs [75'-90'] in the midfielder's dyads and in [15'-30'] vs [60'-75'] match periods for forwards. Similar trend was found during the running speed, in which small to moderate higher synchronization was found during the first half periods, with the exception of [15'-30'] vs [60'-75'] and [30'-45'] vs [75'-90'] in midfielder's dyads. Regarding to the match-to-match variation of the players' speed synchronization, overall results showed small to moderate increases in coefficient of variation during jogging and running displacements from the beginning to the end of the match (32.1; ±13.2% increase in jogging and 26.2; ±10.5% in running, both comparisons most likely). The higher distance covered during most of the first half periods and the higher dyadic synchronization at high speeds might have limited players' performance in the second half. In addition, the decrease trend in speed synchronization during the second half periods might have resulted from accumulated muscular and mental fatigue towards the match. Within, the match-to-match variation in tactical-related variables increased across the match duration, with especial focus in the midfielder dyads. Dyadic speed synchronization might provide relevant information concerning the individual and collective performance."
https://openalex.org/W2884957168,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a multifactorial metabolic disorder caused by environmental factors and has a strong association with hereditary issues. These hereditary issues result in an imbalance in CD4+T cells and a decreased level of naïve CD4+T cells, which may be critical in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Transcription factors GATA3 and STAT4 mediate the cytokine-induced development of naïve T cells into Th1 or Th2 types. In the present study, genetic analyses of GATA3 SNP rs3824662 and STAT4 SNP rs10181656 were performed to investigate the association of allelic and genotypic variations with the risk of T2D in the Bangladeshi population. A total of 297 unrelated Bangladeshi patients with type 2 diabetes and 247 healthy individuals were included in the study. The allelic and genotypic frequencies of rs10181656 located in the STAT4 gene were not found to be associated with risk of type 2 diabetes. The GATA3 rs3824662 T allele and mutant TT genotype had a significant association with the risk of T2D [OR: 1.52 (1.15-2.02), X2 = 8.66, p = 0.003 and OR: 2.98 (1.36-6.55), X2 = 7.98, p = 0.04, respectively]. Thus, the present study postulates that the genetic variation of the transcription factor GATA3, not STAT4, is associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes in the Bangladeshi population."
https://openalex.org/W2883672488,"Falls to the side are the leading cause of hip fractures in the elderly. The load that a person experiences during a fall cannot be measured with volunteers for ethical reasons. To evaluate injurious loads, while considering relevant energy input and body posture for a sideways fall, a subject-specific cadaveric impact experiment was developed. Full cadaveric femur-pelvis constructs (N = 2) were embedded in surrogate soft tissue material and attached to metallic surrogate lower limbs. The specimens were then subjected to an inverted pendulum motion, simulating a fall to the side with an impact to the greater trochanter. The load at the ground and the deformation of the pelvis were evaluated using a 6-axis force transducer and two high-speed cameras. Post-test, a trauma surgeon (PG) evaluated specimen injuries. Peak ground contact forces were 7132 N and 5641 N for the fractured and non-fractured specimen, respectively. We observed a cervical fracture of the femur in one specimen and no injuries in a second specimen, showing that the developed protocol can be used to differentiate between specimens at high and low fracture risk."
https://openalex.org/W2884030984,"Background Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an established cause of serious lower respiratory disease in infants, elderly and high-risk populations. The OUTSMART surveillance program aims to characterize patient populations and currently circulating RSV strains, and monitor temporal and geographic evolution of RSV F and G proteins in the U.S. Methods The OUTSMART 2016–17 study collected RSV-positive samples from 25 RSVAlert® laboratories from 4 U.S. regions and Puerto Rico during November 2016 through March 2017. Frequencies of A and B subtypes and genotypes were determined for several demographic and geographic variables. To gauge the representativeness of the OUTSMART patients, results were compared to discharge data from the NEDS and NIS databases. Results A total of 1,041 RSV-positive samples with associated demographic data were obtained and the RSV F gene and second variable region of the G gene were sequenced. The majority of samples (76.0%) came from children under 2 years old: <1 year (48.4%), 1–2 years (27.6%). The OUTSMART patient sample was similar to NEDS and NIS for age, gender, and geographic location. Both OUTSMART and national RSV cases peaked in January. Of OUTSMART samples, 45.3% were subtype A, 53.7% were subtype B and 1.0% were mixed A and B. The percentage of RSV B cases increased with increasing age. Hospitalization (length of hospital stay, LOS, >24 hrs) occurred in 29.0% of patients of which 52.0% had RSV B. Outpatients (LOS <24 hrs) were 64.4% of total of which 73.3% were diagnosed in the ER and discharged, while only 6% were diagnosed in other outpatient settings. Conclusions The OUTSMART 2016–17 study was representative of the U.S. RSV experience. Geographic and temporal information from the RSV surveillance program will be used to establish a molecular baseline of RSV F and G sequence variability and to help inform development of novel agents for RSV prophylaxis and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2884219856,"Therapies that halt progression of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and achieve a cure for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) have encouraged development of innovative strategies to diagnose and link patients to care. We describe the prevalence and risk factors for HBV and HCV infections and use of an opt-out hepatitis testing and integrated linkage to care pathway in a London Emergency Department (ED). ED patients aged ≥16 years having routine blood tests from 15 February-28 March 2016 were tested for hepatitis, unless opted out. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis C antibody tests (HCV-Ab, including a confirmatory hepatitis C antigen test (HCV-Ag)) were pre-selected on electronic blood test requests. Linkage to care (attending one clinic appointment) was offered to HBsAg and HCV-Ag patients (new or known-disengaged with care diagnoses). Weighted prevalence estimates and risk factors for seropositivity adjusted by demographics and survey weights were calculated using logistic regression. Hepatitis testing uptake was 56% (3,290/5,865). Overall, 26 HBsAg (10 new diagnoses) and 63 HCV-Ab patients were identified of which 32 were HCV-Ag positive (10 new diagnoses). Weighted seroprevalence of HBsAg was 0.50% (95% CI 0.3-0.8%); HCV-Ab 2.0% (95% CI 1.5-2.7%) and HCV-Ag 1.2% (95% CI 0.8-1.7%). Risk factors for infection were being male (HBsAg: aOR 4.1, 95% CI 1.5-11.3), of non-White British ethnicity (HBsAg: aOR>11) or being homeless (HCV-Ag: aOR 18.9, 95% CI 6.9-51.4). We achieved a high linkage to care uptake for HBsAg (93%) and HCV-Ag (78%) among patients who were contacted and required linkage. A pre-selected hepatitis testing ordering system facilitated a high testing uptake. New and disengaged with care diagnoses and a high HCV prevalence were identified demonstrating the potential to identify and link patients to care in this setting. Strategies connecting clinical care with community outreach services are key for improving patient linkage to care."
https://openalex.org/W2883027315,"Plant-soil biological interactions are increasingly recognized as a key feature of agroecosystems, promoting both crop and soil health. However, the effectiveness of plant-soil synergies is likely modulated by both root system characteristics and soil management impacts on soil biological communities. To successfully manage for plant-soil interactions, we need to better understand how crops respond to changes in soil management, especially in terms of belowground investment. Specifically, crop genotypes that exhibit reduced plasticity in root growth and investment may not be able to take full advantage of changes in soil biological activity associated with soil health promoting practices. We hypothesized that genotypes with greater belowground investment respond more, in terms of plant growth and crop nitrogen (N) uptake, to compost and earthworm additions, agronomic factors commonly associated with soil health. We evaluated four spring wheat (Triticum aestivum) genotypes with distinct breeding and environmental histories, and one progenitor of wheat (Aegilops tauschii) under low soil fertility conditions in the greenhouse for differences in belowground root biomass and architecture. We then determined how these belowground traits influenced genotype response to additions of compost and earthworms. Measurements included plant growth, biomass, grain yield, root characteristics, plant N uptake, and soil N. Overall, in unamended soils, genotypes differed in above and belowground phenotypic traits. In general, Ae. tauschii had three times greater root: shoot (R:S) ratio, root length, and root biomass relative to wheat genotypes. We found that genotypes with higher R:S ratios responded more positively to compost additions compared to those with lower R:S ratios, particularly in terms of plant aboveground biomass, N uptake and soil N-cycling, and also exhibited greater plasticity in root morphology. Consequently, while higher R:S genotypes had relatively poorer yields in unamended soils, they outperformed lower R:S genotypes in total seed weight under compost treatments. Our findings suggest that genotypes with greater belowground investment may be better able to take advantage of soil health promoting practices, such as the use of organic amendments. These results highlight the need to consider soil management practices (and associated biological communities) in parallel with root phenotypic plasticity when evaluating wheat lines for improvements in plant-soil synergies."
https://openalex.org/W2883769491,"Despite systemic therapy and cystectomy, bladder cancer is characterized by a high recurrence rate. Serum glycomics represents a promising source of prognostic markers for monitoring patients. Our approach, which we refer to as ""glycan node analysis"", constitutes the first example of molecularly ""bottom-up"" glycomics. It is based on a global glycan methylation analysis procedure that is applied to whole blood plasma/serum. The approach detects and quantifies partially methylated alditol acetates arising from unique glycan features such as α2-6 sialylation, β1-4 branching, and core fucosylation that have been pooled together from across all intact glycans within a sample into a single GC-MS chromatographic peak. We applied this method to 122 plasma samples from former and current bladder cancer patients (n = 72 former cancer patients with currently no evidence of disease (NED); n = 38 non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) patients; and n = 12 muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) patients) along with plasma from 30 certifiably healthy living kidney donors. Markers for α2-6 sialylation, β1-4 branching, β1-6 branching, and outer-arm fucosylation were able to separate current and former (NED) cases from certifiably healthy controls (ROC curve c-statistics ~ 0.80); but NED, NMIBC, and MIBC were not distinguished from one another. Based on the unexpectedly high levels of these glycan nodes in the NED patients, we hypothesized that recurrence of this disease could be predicted by some of the elevated glycan features. Indeed, α2-6 sialylation and β1-6 branching were able to predict recurrence from the NED state using a Cox proportional hazards regression model adjusted for age, gender, and time from cancer. The levels of these two glycan features were correlated to C-reactive protein concentration, an inflammation marker and known prognostic indicator for bladder cancer, further strengthening the link between inflammation and abnormal plasma protein glycosylation."
https://openalex.org/W2884094204,"When the distributional assumptions for a t-test are not met, the default position of many analysts is to resort to a rank-based test, such as the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney Test to compare the difference in means between two samples. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney Test presents no danger of tied observations when the observations in the data are continuous. However, in practice, observations are discretized due various logical reasons, or the data are ordinal in nature. When ranks are tied, most textbooks recommend using mid-ranks to replace the tied ranks, a practice that affects the distribution of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney Test under the null hypothesis. Other methods for breaking ties have also been proposed. In this study, we examine four tie-breaking methods-average-scores, mid-ranks, jittering, and omission-for their effects on Type I and Type II error of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney Test and the two-sample t-test for various combinations of sample sizes, underlying population distributions, and percentages of tied observations. We use the results to determine the maximum percentage of ties for which the power and size are seriously affected, and for which method of tie-breaking results in the best Type I and Type II error properties. Not surprisingly, the underlying population distribution of the data has less of an effect on the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney Test than on the t-test. Surprisingly, we find that the jittering and omission methods tend to hold Type I error at the nominal level, even for small sample sizes, with no substantial sacrifice in terms of Type II error. Furthermore, the t-test and the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney Test are equally effected by ties in terms of Type I and Type II error; therefore, we recommend omitting tied observations when they occur for both the two-sample t-test and the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney due to the bias in Type I error that is created when tied observations are left in the data, in the case of the t-test, or adjusted using mid-ranks or average-scores, in the case of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney."
https://openalex.org/W2883126009,"Background Dementia is characterized by prolonged progressive disability. Therefore, predicting mortality is difficult. An accurate prediction tool may be useful to ensure that end-of-life patients with dementia receive timely palliative care. Purpose This study aims to establish a survival prediction model for elderly patients with dementia in Taiwan. Methods Data from the 2001 to 2010 National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan were used to identify 37,289 patients with dementia aged ≥65 years for inclusion in this retrospective longitudinal study. Moreover, this study examined the mortality indicators for dementia among demographic characteristics, chronic physical comorbidities, and medical procedures. A Cox proportional hazards model with time-dependent covariates was used to estimate mortality risk, and risk score functions were formulated using a point system to establish a survival prediction model. The prediction model was then tested using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Results Thirteen mortality risk factors were identified: age, sex, stroke, chronic renal failure, liver cirrhosis, cancer, pressure injury, and retrospectively retrieved factors occurring in the 6 months before death, including nasogastric tube placement, supplemental oxygen supply, ≥2 hospitalization, receiving ≥1 emergency services, ≥2 occurrences of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and receiving ≥2 endotracheal intubations. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves for this prediction model for mortality at 6 and 12 months were 0.726 and 0.733, respectively. Conclusions The survival prediction model demonstrated moderate accuracy for predicting mortality at 6 and 12 months before death in elderly patients with dementia. This tool may be valuable for helping health care providers and family caregivers to make end-of-life care decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2883172416,"The seed coat mucilage envelope is formed just after hydration and surrounds the seed as a gel-like, transparent capsule. The mucilage envelope represents a special type of modified cell wall with all of the typical polysaccharides i.e. cellulose, pectins and hemicelluloses. The chemical composition of the mucilage is well-recognized but its structural organization remains unclear. In the presented study, we visualized the spatial architecture of the seed mucilage envelope of selected taxa which produce cellulose mucilage. Using critical point drying (CPD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging, we demonstrated the structural details of the mucilage from the micro- down to the nanoscale. The mucilage, after CPD, had a visibly spatial structure which differed between the studied taxa; for example, a tangled organization in Arabidopsis thaliana and a more ordered arrangement in Ocimum basilicum were revealed. In general, the mucilaginous fibrillary components formed network made of long, unbranched, thicker cellulose fibrils together with shorter, thinner and, often branched other polysaccharides. Cellulose fibrils built a kind of scaffold for the rest of the components which were spread between them and/or covered their surface. The cellulose fibrils were attached to the seed surface, and therefore prevent the loss of the mucilage envelope during mechanical impacts. The loose architecture and special chemical composition of the mucilaginous cell wall is important for water binding and storage, which are crucial for the proper functioning of the seed mucilage envelope."
https://openalex.org/W2883515163,"Human-induced environmental and climate change are widely blamed for causing rapid global biodiversity loss, but direct estimation of the proportion of biodiversity lost at local or regional scales are still infrequent. This prevents us from quantifying the main and interactive effects of anthropogenic environmental and climate change on species loss. Here, we demonstrate that the estimated proportion of species loss of 252 key protected vertebrate species at a county level of China during the past half century was 27.2% for all taxa, 47.7% for mammals, 28.8% for amphibians and reptiles and 19.8% for birds. Both human population increase and species richness showed significant positive correlations with species loss of all taxa combined, mammals, birds, and amphibians and reptiles. Temperature increase was positively correlated with all-taxa and bird species loss. Precipitation increase was negatively correlated with species loss of birds. Human population change and species richness showed more significant interactions with the other correlates of species loss. High species richness regions had higher species loss under the drivers of human environmental and climate change than low-richness regions. Consequently, ongoing human environmental and climate changes are expected to perpetuate more negative effects on the survival of key vertebrate species, particularly in high-biodiversity regions."
https://openalex.org/W2883701961,"Blood parameters provide an excellent tool to evaluate the health status of wildlife. However, there are few studies about health parameters of sea turtles in Mexico. For olive ridley turtles (Lepidochelys olivacea), no information was available to establish the health baseline for the species. The objective of this study was to establish reference blood biochemistry values for olive ridley turtles in the northern Sinaloa foraging area. Between 2013 and 2015, 82 olive ridley turtles were captured. Body condition index (BCI) presented a mean of 1.46 ± 0.14 (1.17–2.02) that categorized the population with excellent body condition; in addition, 99% of the turtles captured had a good physical appearance. Blood was collected for biochemistry analysis from 60 turtles. Significantly higher values of total protein, albumin, A/G ratio (albumin/globulin) and PCV (packed cell volume or hematocrit) were observed in adult when compared to subadult turtles. On the other hand, no significant differences were found when females and males were compared. Based on the BCI, physical assessment, and blood parameters, and compared to other sea turtle species, olive ridley turtles in northern Sinaloa were considered in excellent health. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to establish normal blood biochemistry values of foraging olive ridley turtles in northern Sinaloa."
https://openalex.org/W2883708723,"Background Recently, three-dimensional (3D) imaging techniques have been used to detect viral invasion and the appearance of specialized structures established in virus-infected cells. These methods have had a positive impact in the field of virology and helped to further our knowledge of how viruses invade cells. Nearly all positive-strand RNA viruses propagate their viral genomes in part through intracellular membranes. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), an Arterivirus, accumulates viral RNA that forms replication complexes (RCs) in infected cells. In this study, using immunofluorescence and electron microscopy (EM), we dissected PRRSV-induced membrane structures in infected cells and determined the correlations between PRRSV particles and vesicles stimulated by PRRSV to understand the structural and dynamic aspects of PRRSV infection. Methods We identified the appropriate time point by determining the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) and using qRT-PCR and Western blotting. The co-localization of viruses and organelles was determined by immunofluorescence and immune-electron microscopy (IEM). The ultrastructure of cells infected by PRRSV was observed using EM and electron tomography (ET). Results In our study, we found that PRRSV dsRNA was located at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and autophagosomes; in addition, the N protein was located at the mitochondria, ER and autophagosomes. Vesicles induced by PRRSV appeared at 16 hours post-infection (h.p.i.) and increased in size with time during the infection period. In addition, our findings demonstrated that the virus vesicles originated from the ER, and these two organelle structures connected with each other to form a reticulovesicular network (RVN) that provided a site for virus replication and assembly. Conclusion Our results revealed that membrane vesicles induced by PRRSV were derived from the ER. The vesicles may provide a location for PRRSV replication and assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2884163519,"Aspergillosis is a fungal disease due to Aspergillus molds that can affect both humans and animals. As routine diagnosis remains difficult, improvement of basic knowledge with respect to its pathophysiology is critical to search for new biomarkers of infection and new therapeutic targets. Large-scale proteomics allows assessment of protein changes during various disease processes. In the present study, mass spectrometry iTRAQ® (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation) protocol was used for direct identification and relative quantitation of host proteins in diseased fluids and tissues collected from an experimental rat model challenged with Aspergillus, as well as in blood obtained from naturally-infected penguins. In all, mass spectrometry analysis revealed that proteome during aspergillosis was mostly represented by proteins that usually express role in metabolic processes and biological process regulation. Ten and 17 proteins were significantly ≥4.0-fold overrepresented in blood of Aspergillus-diseased rats and penguins, respectively, while five and 39 were negatively ≥4.0-fold depleted within the same samples. In rat lungs, 33 proteins were identified with positive or negative relative changes versus controls and were quite different from those identified in the blood. Except for some zinc finger proteins, kinases, and histone transferases, and while three pathways were common (Wnt, cadherin and FGF), great inter-species variabilities were observed regarding the identity of the differentially-represented proteins. Thus, this finding confirmed how difficult it is to define a unique biomarker of infection. iTRAQ® protocol appears as a convenient proteomic tool that is greatly suited to ex vivo exploratory studies and should be considered as preliminary step before validation of new diagnostic markers and new therapeutic targets in humans."

We investigated the clinical significance of serum soluble B7-H4 in patients with non-metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma.We analyzed 108 patients in whom non-metastatic clear cell renal cancer was diagnosed at Tokyo Metropolitan Tama Medical Center between 2008 and 2013. We measured the serum soluble B7-H4 level using the Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) and evaluated the association between the peripheral blood neutrophil count and sB7-H4 as well as the utility of soluble B7-H4 as a prognostic biomarker for clear cell renal cancer. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the PFS and OS with the soluble B7-H4 level.We detected high levels of soluble B7-H4 in the sera of 56% of patients with non-metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma versus only 10% of healthy donors. Elevated soluble B7-H4 levels were associated with changes in an elevated peripheral blood neutrophil count. The increase of soluble B7-H4 also was significantly associated with poor PFS and OS. Multivariate analysis showed that the elevation of the soluble B7-H4 level was an independent prognostic factor for PFS and OS.Our data suggest that the association between serum soluble B7-H4 and peripheral blood neutrophil count, as well as the evaluation of serum soluble B7-H4 expression is a useful tool for predicting the prognosis of patients with non-metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2883292532,"BRCA1 is a tumor suppressor frequently mutated in breast and ovarian cancer, serving it as a target for therapeutic exploitation. Here, we show that BRCA1 has a synthetic lethality interaction with an epigenetics regulator, bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET). BET inhibition led to gene expression changes reversing MYC-dependent transcription repression of a redox regulator, thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), via switching the promoter occupant from MYC to MondoA:MLX complex. Reversing the MYC-TXNIP axis inhibited thioredoxin activity and elevated cellular oxidative stress, causing DNA damages that are detrimental to BRCA1-deficient breast cancer cells. Tumor xenograft models and breast cancer clinical data analyses further demonstrated an in vivo synthetic lethality interaction and clinical association between BET/TXNIP and BRCA1 deficiency in the survival of breast cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2883928718,"To understand the response of marine calcifying organisms under high CO2 scenarios, it is critical to study their calcification patterns in the natural environment. This paper focuses on a major calcifying phytoplankton group, the coccolithophores, through the analysis of water samples collected along a W-E Mediterranean transect during two research cruises, in April 2011 (Meteor cruise M84/3) and May 2013 (MedSeA cruise 2013). The Mediterranean Sea is a marginal sea characterized by large biogeochemical gradients. Currently, it is undergoing both warming and ocean acidification, processes which are rapidly modifying species distribution and calcification. The species Emiliania huxleyi largely dominates the total coccolithophore production in present day oceans and marine basins, including the Mediterranean Sea. A series of morphometric measurements were performed on the coccoliths of this species to estimate their mass, length and calculate a calcification index (proxy for the size-normalized calcification degree). The most abundant morphotype of E. huxleyi in the Mediterranean Sea is Type A. Coccoliths of this morphotype were additionally analyzed based on scanning electron microscopy images: four calcification varieties were quantified, according to the relationship between slit length-tube width, and the state of the central area (open or closed). The average E. huxleyi coccolith mass along the Mediterranean oceanographic transect depended strongly on both the average coccolith length and calcification index. The variability in average coccolith length and calcification index across samples reflected oscillations in the relative abundance of the calcification varieties. We also demonstrated that the distribution of the calcification varieties followed the main environmental gradients (carbonate chemistry, salinity, temperature, nutrient concentrations). Hence, shifts in the distribution of the calcification varieties and of the average E. huxleyi coccolith mass are to be expected in the Mediterranean Sea under climate change. These physiological and ecological responses will modulate the net coccolithophore calcification and, ultimately, the regional carbonate export to the seafloor."

Although the immune checkpoint molecules, programmed death-1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4), and immune checkpoint inhibitors have been evaluated for the treatment of various human lymphoid malignancies, the expression of those molecules and their relationship with prognosis remain unknown in canine lymphoma. The objective of this study was to evaluate the expression of costimulatory molecules on peripheral blood lymphocytes and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, in addition to associated ligand expression in the lymph nodes of patients with B cell multicentric high grade lymphoma. Eighteen patients diagnosed with B cell high grade lymphoma and nine healthy control dogs were enrolled. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the expression of PD-1 on CD4+ peripheral and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and CTLA-4 on CD4+ peripheral lymphocytes was significantly higher in the lymphoma group than in the control group. The expression level of CD80 mRNA was significantly lower in the lymphoma group than in the control group. In contrast, there were no significant differences in PD-L1, PD-L2, and CD86 expression between the groups. Dogs with CTLA-4 levels below the cutoff values, which were determined based on receiver operating characteristic curves, on peripheral CD4+, CD8+, and tumor infiltrating CD4+ lymphocytes had significantly longer survival than dogs with values above the cutoff. Although it is uncertain whether the expression of immune checkpoint molecules affect the biological behavior of canine lymphoma, one possible explanation is that PD-1 and CTLA-4 might be associated with the suppression of antitumor immunity in dogs with B cell high grade lymphoma, particularly through CD4+ T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2883729114,"Periodontitis is a microbe-induced chronic inflammatory disease. Previous exposure of the host to bacteria or their virulence factors leads to refractory responses to further stimuli, which is called tolerance. Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) is one of the most important pathogenic microorganisms associated with periodontitis, and is a potent inducer of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. The aim of this study was to explore the roles and possible mechanisms of tolerance induced by P. gingivalis.THP-1-derived macrophages were pretreated with 1x108 colony-forming units/ml P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 or 21 clinical isolates from moderate to severe chronic periodontitis patients (24 h), washed (2 h) and treated with P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 or the same clinical isolates again (24 h). Levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in supernatants were detected by ELISA. Moreover, to identify the possible mechanisms for the changes in cytokine secretion, Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR4 protein expressions were explored in these cells by flow cytometry.After repeated challenge with P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 or clinical isolates, production of TNF-α and IL-1β in macrophages was decreased significantly compared with that following a single stimulation (p<0.05), while only comparable levels of IL-10 were detected in P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 or clinical isolate-tolerized cells (p>0.05). In addition, there was interstrain variability in the ability to induce IL-1β and IL-10 production after repeated P. gingivalis stimulation. However, no significant changes in TLR2 or TLR4 were detected in macrophages that were repeatedly treated with P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 or clinical isolates compared with those stimulated with P. gingivalis only once (p>0.05).Repeated P. gingivalis stimulation triggered tolerance, which might contribute to limiting periodontal inflammation. However, tolerance induced by P. gingivalis might develop independently of TLR2 and TLR4 and be related to molecules in signaling pathways downstream of TLR2 and TLR4."
https://openalex.org/W2883381770,"Mapping individual brain networks has drawn significant research interest in recent years. Most individual brain networks developed to date have been based on fMRI or diffusion MRI. Given recent concerns regarding confounding artifacts, various preprocessing steps are generally included in functional or structural brain networks. Notably, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) derived from anatomical MRI exhibits high signal-to-noise ratios and has been applied to individual interregional morphological networks. To the best of our knowledge, individual voxel-wise morphological networks remain unexplored. The goal of this research is twofold: to build novel metrics for individual voxel-wise morphological networks and to test the reliability of the proposed morphological connectivity. To this end, anatomical scans of a cohort of healthy subjects were obtained from a public database. The anatomical datasets were preprocessed and normalized to the standard brain space. For each individual, wavelet-transform was applied on the VBM measures to obtain voxel-wise hierarchical features. The voxel-wise morphological connectivity was computed based on the wavelet features. Reliable brain hubs were detected by the z-scores of degree centrality. High reliability was discovered by test-retest analysis. No effects of wavelet scale, network threshold or network type were found on hubs of group-level degree centrality. However, significant effects of wavelet scale, network threshold and network type were found on individual-level degree centrality. Significant effects of network threshold and network type were found on reliability of degree centrality. The results suggested that the voxel-wise morphological connectivity was reliable and exhibited a hub structure. Moreover, the voxel-wise morphological connectivity could reflect individual differences. In summary, individual voxel-wise wavelet-based features can probe morphological connectivity and may be beneficial for investigating the brain morphological connectomes."
https://openalex.org/W2883772523,"Recent investigations of Nogo-A, a well characterized protein inhibitor of neurite outgrowth in the brain, have revealed additional functions including a role in neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. Here we examined Nogo-A functions in mouse CA3 hippocampal circuitry. Patch clamp recordings showed that the absence of Nogo-A results in a hyperactive network. In addition, mGlu3 metabotropic glutamate receptors, which exhibit mutations in certain forms of schizophrenia, were downregulated specifically in the CA3 area. Furthermore, Nogo-A-/- mice showed disordered theta oscillations with decreased incidence and frequency, similar to those observed in mGlu3-/- mice. As disruptions in theta rhythmicity are associated with impaired spatial navigation, we tested mice using modified Morris water maze tasks. Mice lacking Nogo-A exhibited altered search strategies, displaying greater dependence on global as opposed to local reference frames. This link between Nogo-A and mGlu3 receptors may provide new insights into mechanisms underlying schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2884868764,"Mouse mammary tumour virus-like (MMTV-like) is suspected to be involved in human breast cancer and it has been hypothesized that companion animals might have a role in viral transmission. The aim of our study was to investigate the presence of MMTV-like nucleotide sequences and viral protein in a larger number of feline (FMCs) and canine mammary carcinomas (CMCs) by nested PCR and immunohistochemistry. Results showed that the presence of MMTV-like env sequence in FMCs was 7% (6/86), while all the CMCs and canine dysplastic lesions scored negative. All PCR-positive FMCs scored positive for the MMTV p14 signal peptide of the envelope precursor protein of the virus. In contrast, all PCR-negative FMCs and canine mammary lesions were also negative for immunohistochemistry analysis. Canine and feline normal mammary gland tissues scored negative for both PCR and MMTV-p14 protein. Multiple nucleotide alignment of MMTV-like env gene sequences isolated from cat showed 97% and 99% similarity with HMTV and MMTV, respectively, while the others two presented some polimorphisms. Particularly the sequences of one of these two tumors showed a polymorphism (c.7575 A> G), that causes a previously unreported amino acid substitution (Thr > Ala). In conclusion, the results of our study showed the presence of MMTV-like sequences and viral protein in some FMCs. Further studies are needed to understand whether this virus does play a role in the development of FMCs, if MMTV-like is an exogenous virus as these data suggest and, in such a case, how and from whom this virus was acquired."
https://openalex.org/W2883155518,"Chemical modification of known, effective drugs are one method to improve the chemotherapy of tumors. We reported ability of oxazoline analogs of doxorubicin (O-DOX) and daunorubicin (O-DAU) to induce apoptosis and autophagy in ovarian and liver cancer cells. Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS, respectively), together with intracellular calcium-mediated downstream signaling, are essential for the anticancer effect of these new anthracycline analogs. The changes of mitochondrial membrane potential and induction of the ceramide pathway suggests that these compounds induce cell death by apoptosis. In addition, a significant increase of autophagosome formation was observed by fluorescence assay and acridine orange staining, indicating that the new analogs also induce autophagic cell death. Compared to free DOX- and DAU-treated cells, we observed inhibition of colony formation and migration, a time-dependency between ROS/RNS levels and a greater fall in mitochondrial membrane potential. Altogether, our research broadens the base of molecular oxazolinoanthracyclines targets and reveals that derivatives mediated oxidative stress, ceramide production and increase in intracellular calcium level by mitochondria. Furthermore, our data highlight the importance of mitochondria that simultaneously assume the role of activator of autophagy and apoptosis signals."
https://openalex.org/W2884019084,"Introduction Inefficient clinic-level delivery of HIV services is a barrier to linkage and engagement in care. We used value stream mapping to quantify time spent on each component of a clinic visit while receiving care following a hospital admission in South Africa. Methods We described time for each clinic service (“process time”) and time spent waiting for that service (“lead time”). We also determined time and patient costs associated with travel to the clinic and expenditures during the clinic visits for 15 clinic visits in South Africa. Participants were selected consecutively based on timing of scheduled clinic visit from a cohort of HIV-positive patients recently discharged from inpatient hospital care. During the mapping we asked the participants to assess challenges faced at the clinic visit. We subsequently conducted in depth interviews and included themes from the care experience in this analysis. Results The 15 clinic visits occurred at five clinics; four primary care and one hospital-based specialty clinic. Nine (64%) of the participants were women, the median age was 44 years (IQR: 32–49), three of the participants had one or more clinic visit in the prior 14 days, all but one participant was on antiretroviral therapy (ART) at the time of the clinic visit (ART was stopped following the hospital visit for that participant). The median time since hospital discharge was 131 days (interquartile range; IQR: 121–183) for the observed visits. The median travel time to and from the clinic to a place of residence was 60 minutes. The median time spent at the clinic was 3.5 hours (IQR: 2.5–5.3) of which 2.9 hours was lead time and 25 minutes was process time (registration, vital signs, clinician assessment, laboratory, and check-out). The median patient cost for transport and food while at the clinic was ZAR43/USD2.8 (median monthly household income in the district was ZAR2450/USD157). Participants highlighted long queues, repeat clinic visits, and multiple queues during the visit (median of 5 queues) as challenges. Conclusions Accessing HIV care in South Africa is time consuming, complicated by multiple queues and frequent visits. A more patient-centered approach to care may decrease the burden of receiving care and improve outcomes."

https://openalex.org/W2883438434,"Transcriptome deep sequencing is a powerful tool for exploring the genetic architecture of complex traits. Gene expression patterns may explain a high degree of the observed phenotypic differences in histochemical and metabolic parameters related to meat quality among different muscles. In this study, we sequenced by RNA-Seq the whole transcriptome of nine lamb muscles: Semimembranosus (SM), Semitendinosus (ST), Cranial gluteobiceps, Gluteus medius (GM), Rectus femoris, Supraspinatus (SS), Longissimus lumborum (LL), Adductor and Psoas major. Significant gene expression differences were detected between almost all pairwise comparisons, being more pronounced between SS and ST, SM and LL, and ST and GM. These differences can be explained in terms of ATPase and glycolytic activities, muscle fiber typing and oxidative score, clustering muscles as fast glycolytic, intermediate or slow oxidative. ST showed up-regulation of gene pathways related to carbohydrate metabolism, energy generation and protein turnover as expected from a fast white muscle. SS showed myosin isoforms typical of slow muscles and high expression of genes related to calcium homeostasis and vascularization. SM, LL and GM showed in general intermediate gene expression patterns. Several novel transcripts were detected, mostly related to muscle contraction and structure, oxidative metabolism, lipid metabolism and protein phosphorylation. Expression profiles were consistent with previous histochemical and metabolic characterization of these muscles. Up-regulation of ion transport genes may account for significant differences in water holding capacity. High expression of genes related to cell adhesion, cytoskeleton organization, extracellular matrix components and protein phosphorylation may be related to meat yellowness and lower tenderness scores. Differential expression of genes related to glycolytic activity and lactic acid generation among fast, intermediate and slow muscles may explain the detected final meat pH differences. These results reveal new candidate genes associated with lamb meat quality, and give a deeper insight into the genetic architecture of these complex traits."
https://openalex.org/W2883784113,"The importance of targeting ecological and evolutionary processes in reserve design has been widely acknowledged in the literature but rarely implemented on islands. Using Socotran reptiles as models, we aim to relate richness of widespread and restricted-range species directly with landscape variables and to compare the impact of setting conservation targets for lineages versus species. Socotra Island is a UNESCO Natural World Heritage Site, containing high levels of endemism in relation to its area, especially of reptiles, the vertebrates with the most comprehensive available genetic data. We predicted the occurrences of reptile species using distribution models and used a novel approach to interpolate maps of spatial phylogenetic patterns. Patterns of intra and interspecifc diversity and differences between spatial outputs of lineage and species richness were related to eco-geographic variables. We evaluated differences in target achievement for each conservation unit within protected areas (PAs) under the current Zoning Plan (ZP) using gap and reserve design analyses. Although intraspecific richness was strongly correlated with interspecific richness, differences in their spatial distribution reached ~30% in some areas. Differences were more pronounced for wide-ranging than restricted-range taxa. Gap analysis indicates that most conservation units are under-represented in sanctuaries and that intra and interspecific richness were significantly higher outside PAs. This work will guide local-scale conservation planning as the ZP is due to be re-evaluated. This is one of the few studies on islands using genetic data from an entire class of vertebrates to incorporate lineage diversity in reserve design. This study provides an alternative methodological framework for supporting the use of landscape and genetic tools in reserve design, circumventing the use of phylogenetic distances and deterministic spatial interpolation of lineage diversity that can be widely applied to other systems."
https://openalex.org/W2884320739,"The aesthetic quality of the built environment is of paramount importance to the quality of life of an increasingly urbanizing population. However, a lack of data has hindered the development of comprehensive measures of perceived architectural beauty. In this paper, we demonstrate that the local frequency of geotagged photos posted by internet users in two photo-sharing websites strongly predict the beauty ratings of buildings. We conduct an independent beauty survey with respondents rating proprietary stock photos of 1,000 buildings across the United States. Buildings with higher ratings were found more likely to be geotagged with user-uploaded photos in both Google Maps and Flickr. This correlation also holds for the beauty rankings of raters who seldom upload materials to the internet. Objective architectural characteristics that predict higher average beauty ratings of buildings also positively covary with their internet photo frequency. These results validate the use of localized user-generated image uploads in photo-sharing sites to measure the aesthetic appeal of the urban environment in the study of architecture, real estate, urbanism, planning, and environmental psychology."
https://openalex.org/W2884368597,"Different inflammatory reactions have been observed in the polyp tissues of nonsmokers and smokers with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). E-prostanoid (EP) receptors play a role in the inflammatory processes. Cigarette smoke (CS) exposure regulates EP-receptor expression levels promoting inflammatory mediator release from various inflammatory cells. In this study, we characterize the EP-receptor expression profiles in the polyps of nonsmoking and smoking CRS patients to explore the possible role of CS in the pathogenesis of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP).Polyp biopsies were obtained from 28 non-smoking and 21 smoking CRSwNP patients. Histopathological characteristics were observed under a light microscope. The prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), TNF-α, and IL-8 contents in polyp tissues were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Immunostaining was used to locate EP receptors in polyps. Messenger RNA and protein expression of EP receptors were examined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot, respectively.More severe inflammatory reactions occurred in polyp tissues of smoking CRSwNP patients. The PGE2, TNF-α, and IL-8 in tissue homogenate levels were significantly higher in smoking CRSwNP patients than those in nonsmoking CRSwNP patients. Moreover, the distribution of each EP receptor subtype was similar in both groups. Compared with the EP-receptor expression in nonsmokers, messenger RNA and protein of EP2 and EP4 receptor were significantly down-expressed in smoking patients, but EP1 and EP3 receptors did not show significant differences.CS exposure downregulates the expression levels of EP2 and EP4 receptors and stimulates the production of PGE2 and the proinflammatory cytokine IL-8 and TNF-α in polyp tissues of CRS patients. The down-expressed EP2 and EP4 receptors might be associated with severe inflammatory reactions in smoking CRSwNP patients."
https://openalex.org/W2883420678,"Previous research has identified the impacts of legal frameworks that criminalize HIV non-disclosure among people living with HIV (e.g., elevated stigma and violence). However, far less is known about the perspectives or experiences of people-particularly, men-who are HIV-seronegative or who are unaware of their status. The objective of this paper is to describe the health and social risks that young men perceive to be associated with an HIV diagnosis in the context of Canada's current legal framework pertaining to HIV non-disclosure.We analyzed data from 100 in-depth interviews (2013-2016) conducted with 85 young men ages 18-30 in Vancouver on the topic of the criminalization of HIV non-disclosure.Our analysis revealed two dominant narratives in relation to HIV criminalization: (a) interrogation and (b) justification. An interrogation narrative problematized the moral permissibility of criminalizing HIV non-disclosure. In this narrative, Canada's HIV non-disclosure legal framework was characterized as creating unjust barriers to HIV testing uptake, as well as impeding access to and reducing retention in care for those living with HIV. Conversely, a justification narrative featured a surprising number of references to HIV as a ""death sentence"", despite effective treatments being universally available in Canada. However, most of those who presented the justification narrative asserted that the criminalization of HIV non-disclosure was morally justified in light of the perceived negative stigma-related impacts of HIV (e.g., discrimination; being ostracized from sex or romantic partners, friends, family). The justification narrative often reflected a belief that the legal framework provides both punishment and deterrence, which were perceived to supersede any barriers to care for both HIV-positive and -negative individuals.Public education regarding contemporary medical advances in HIV may help contest lay understandings of HIV as a ""death sentence"", which is particularly relevant to destabilizing justification narratives. However, significant strengthening of HIV stigma-reduction efforts will be needed to move society away from narratives that attempt to justify Canada's current HIV non-disclosure legal framework."
https://openalex.org/W2884540365,"The past decade saw the establishment of pediatric intensive care units (PICU) across China. This occurred in the context of increasing private shares of medical costs. Payment schemes have not kept pace with the increased availability and demand. As a result a substantial number of parents, in the face of financial constraints, choose to withdraw the medical care of children even when recovery is expected.We set out to describe the experience of one PICU in Changsha, an industrialized city near the center of the country with a population of 7.3 million.During the two-year period 883 patients were admitted to the PICU. One hundred one (11%) patients died during their hospital stay. Of these 69 (68%) died after parents elected to withdraw care. A large proportion (33 out of 69 48%) cited economic factors as a reason behind the decision. Compared with the non-withdrawal group the cases had lower disease severity at admission and on the day of death. On the day of death 34% in the withdrawal group had lower disease severity than at admission, showing clinical improvement. The mean hospital charge for the ICU stay was RMB35,000 (~$5600).A substantial proportion of patients in a Chinese urban PICU died after parents chose to withdraw their care in the face of financial hardship, even while some were showing clinical improvement. The society has an obligation, and, likely, an economic incentive, to share this burden."
https://openalex.org/W2884418088,"Direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) of prescription drugs can be both beneficial and harmful to healthcare consumers. Therefore, DTCA for prescription drugs is a topic that should be considered crucially, at this point, when the interests of patients as well as pharmaceutical companies in DTCA of prescription drugs are growing in South Korea. The goals of this study were to investigate Korean college students' perceptions and attitudes about DTCA of prescription drugs through a survey as well as to analyze data according to their college majors in order to identify differences in their perceptions and attitudes about prescription drug DTCAs as future health care professionals and consumers, respectively. A descriptive, cross-sectional survey was conducted between September and November 2015. Participants were recruited from Chosun University in Gwangju, South Korea. Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Chosun University Institutional Review Board. Of 1,040 questionnaires initially distributed, 774 were collected, and 742 were included in the analysis. The results of this study indicated that most students who had participated in the survey did not have sufficient knowledge of DTCA for prescription drugs. Approximately, 17% reported being cognizant of DTCA for prescription drugs. More healthcare students (24.6%) knew this term than non-healthcare students did (6.3%). In this study, most of the students were likely to feel that healthcare professionals (e.g., doctors and pharmacists) had the responsibility of delivering information about prescription drugs to patients, and that all prescription drugs DTCA, if it were permitted, had to be pre-approved by the Korean government. The results of this study indicated that DTCA for prescription drugs had to be permitted under the condition of pre-approval of the DTCA contents by the Korean government, and prescription drugs should not be advertised through the Internet. It is recommended that the Korean government cautiously examine whether DTCA of prescription drugs should be permitted, after considering the current marketing strategies of pharmaceutical companies on the Internet and the effects of online electronic-DTCA on Korean consumers."
https://openalex.org/W2884204026,"p8 was initially described as being overexpressed in acute pancreatitis and encoding a ubiquitous stress protein. Analysis of insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in p8-knockout and haplodeficient mice revealed counterintuitive results. Thus, we determined glycemic control of p8 in mice fed with standard (SD) and high-fat diet (HFD).p8-/- and wild type (p8+/+) mice were used for analysis of glucagon (immunohistochemistry), insulin levels (ELISA) and beta cell mass. Hyperinsulinemic- euglycemic glucose clamp technique, i.p. glucose tolerance test (ipGTT), i.p. insulin tolerance test (ipITT) and metabolic chamber analysis were performed in SD (4% fat) and HFD (55% fat) groups.p8-/- mice showed no differences in glucagon or insulin content but higher insulin secretion from pancreatic islets upon glucose stimulation. p8 deficiency resulted in elevated beta cell mass but was not associated with increased insulin resistance in ipGTT or ipITT. Glucose clamp tests also revealed no evidence of association of p8 deficiency with insulin resistance. Metabolic chamber analysis showed equal energy expenditure in p8-/- mice and wild type animals.p8 depletion may contribute to glucose metabolism via stress-induced insulin production and elevated beta cell mass. Nevertheless, p8 knockout showed no impact on insulin resistance in SD and HFD-fed mice."
https://openalex.org/W2884777989,"In common with local government organisations across the world, local authorities in the UK have responsibility for promoting health. A key part of this function is the frontline enforcement activities of officers responsible for compliance with health and nutrition claims. This study identifies attitudes, values and practices of enforcers: namely trading standards and environmental health officers, when faced with the problem of non-compliance with the Regulation. Semi-structured interviews with frontline enforcers from local authority regulatory services to investigate challenges with the enforcement of Regulation (EC) 1924/2006. Twenty participants were interviewed; sixteen were based in North West England and two in the North and two in the South of England. The participants were selected for their specialist knowledge and experience of enforcement of nutrition and health claims. Regulation (EC) No. 1924/2006 on nutrition and health claims presents particular challenges for enforcers seeking to apply an optimal strategy to flawed regulatory design. As with other regulations, when faced with non-compliance, enforcers, specifically trading standards and environmental health officers have a wide discretion to determine their response: ranging from the deterrent or accommodative styles of enforcement. The participants reported using advice rather than action and by doing so confronting their bifurcating identity of prosecutor and advisor. Enforcers used advice as a regulatory tool in enforcing the law relating to nutrition and health claims."
