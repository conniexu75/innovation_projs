https://openalex.org/W2047340979,"DURING the past few years, differential centrifugation of tissue homogenates has become one of the major techniques of cytology and biochemistry alike. Most of those who have applied this new technique describe the conditions of centrifugation by mentioning only the duration of operation and the centrifugal field prevailing in the middle (or at the bottom) of the tube; the type of centrifuge used is sometimes also mentioned. However, the information thus supplied is not sufficient to enable other workers to reproduce the conditions, especially when another type of instrument is to be used. This fact may be partly responsible for the wide variations which are sometimes encountered between results obtained in different laboratories."

https://openalex.org/W2033704071,"WE showed recently1 that porphobilinogen is a highly specific precursor of porphyrins, and Shemin and Russell2 have presented evidence that δ-aminolævulinic acid is a specific precursor of hæm. Shemin and Russell's finding has been confirmed independently in our system (cf. Neuberger and Scott3) to the extent that, on incubation with a chicken red cell hæmolysate4, δ-aminolævulinic acid is converted to uro-, copro- and protoporphyrins. The yield of each of these porphyrins from δ-aminolævulinic acid was, moreover, identical to that1 from an equivalent amount of porphobilinogen. The structure of porphobilinogen5 suggests that this compound could be formed by the condensation of two molecules of δ-aminolævulinic acid (see also refs. 2 and 3), and the equivalence of the two compounds with respect to porphyrin formation may be taken as support for this idea. We now present evidence indicating the occurrence of such a condensation in the chicken red cell hæmolysate."
https://openalex.org/W2045732079,"IT has been recognized for many years that in micro-organisms the formation of a large variety of enzymes can be specifically induced by exposing cells to compounds which are substrates for the enzymes in question. Recently, the same phenomenon has been demonstrated in a mammal1, and it will probably prove to be a general property of biological systems. Since a change of this sort can occur against a constant genetic background, it must be distinguished from a change in enzymatic constitution that is primarily mutational. In order to distinguish between these two phenomena, microbiologists have for many years referred to the former type of enzymic variation as ‘enzyme (or enzymatic) adaptation’. The term was, perhaps, an unfortunate choice2,3 since the word ‘adaptation’ has an old and well-established biological meaning. In biological parlance, ‘adaptation’ denotes the modifications of either structure or function which increase fitness; mechanism is unspecified, and in fact both phenotypic and genotypic changes are included thereunder. Logically, therefore, ‘enzymatic adaptation’ should denote a modification of enzymatic constitution which increases fitness, irrespective of whether it involves genotypic or phenotypic change, and microbiologists have in fact often used it in this broader sense4,5."

https://openalex.org/W2004148560,"THE structure and chemical characterization of elastic tissue by means of elastolysis and electron microscopy have been studied by Hall, Reed and Tunbridge1, and by Lansing, Rosenthal, Alex and Dempsey2. The results of both laboratories agree in showing the complex nature of collagen-free elastin originating either from aorta or ligamentum nuchæ. In the elastic tissue the existence of a cement material —matrix—is suggested, of which the physical and chemical properties are similar to the fibrils imbedded in it. Recently, Schwarz and Dettmer3, working with fresh aorta imbedded in cremolan (Dünnstschnitte), found that during dissolution of elastin fibres by elastase, only the matrix called Kittsubstanz is dissolved, while fibrillæ remain intact and can be examined in the electron microscope. The elementary fibrillæ of the elastic fibres are identical with the collagen fibrils and also are periodically cross-striated. The discrepancy between the results of Hall et al. 1 and of Lansing et al. 2, on one hand, and of Schwarz and Dettmer3, on the other, could be explained by my observation4 that if fibres of collagen or purified collagen tissues are contracted by heat they can be dissolved by elastase. In order to obtain purified elastin the tissue must be boiled; the same procedure was employed by Stein and Miller, who boiled the ligamentum nuchæ in water for many days to remove collagen. Lansing et al. 2 described the preparation of pure elastin by boiling the tissues with 0.1 N sodium hydroxide for 45 min. at 98°. In their experiments, the amorphous matrix as well as the fibrillæ imbedded in it were dissolved during elastolysis, whereas in the experiments of Schwarz and Dettmer3—without heat denaturation—elastase produced only the dissolution of the Kittsubstanz."

https://openalex.org/W2023334561,"IN histo- and cyto-chemistry there has been a trend towards the development of specific techniques for the identification and quantitative determination of biologically important compounds. However, there is a great need for a completely non-specific method which records the total mass of cell structures irrespective of the chemical nature of their constituents. Two such methods have been developed in recent years. One is based on the absorption of very soft X-rays by the biological tissue1. As the samples are investigated in vacuo, the total dry mass is obtained. The other method2,3 makes use of measurements of cell refractivity or optical path-length, which is related to the total mass of substances other than water, that is, the dry mass. Measurement of optical path-differences can be made by means of interference microscopy, and the application of the Dyson interference microscope4 in quantitative cytochemistry has been discussed5."

The stomach secretion has also been found to contain a mucoprotein, the polysaccharide moiety of which was identified as mucoitin disulphuric acid3,4."

https://openalex.org/W2068319369,"THE sensory stimulus of suckling evokes nervous reflex release of the oxytocic substance from the neurohypophysis, which in turn stimulates the contractile tissue of the breast and causes a rise of milk pressure in the mammary ducts1. Electrical stimulation of the nerve supply (the supraopticohypophysial tract) of the neurohypophysis, or injection of posterior pituitary extracts (especially the oxytocic fraction)2, elicits similar effects on the breast. Rise in intra-mammary duct pressure produced by injection of the oxytocic substance, or by excitation of the milk ejection reflex alone, does not usually result in free flow of milk to the exterior, possibly because of some sphincter-like mechanism at the nipple. In some cases, however, excitation of the milk ejection reflex results in dribbling of milk from a nipple that is not being suckled or milked ; for example, the flow that may occur from the unsuckled breast of a nursing woman or from the udder of a cow subjected to routine procedures preceding milking."

https://openalex.org/W1996587382,"CONCENTRATED allantoic inocula of PR8 (influenza A) virus give rise to particles having the antigenic make-up, hæmagglutinating power and enzymic activity of the seed, but lacking infectivity. Since it bears some resemblance to interference by an unrelated virus, the phenomenon was named ‘auto-interference’1. The use of this term was rather unfortunate: partly because Ziegler et al. 2 had previously proposed it to describe the behaviour of old virus preparations containing a large proportion of non-viable particles, as first observed by Henle and Henle3; and partly as it led to the belief that incomplete virus was produced by cells infected by more than one virus particle. Indeed, extensive theoretical predictions have been based on this assumption4. Experiments, however, soon revealed that, whatever its mechanism, multiplicity of infection cannot be implicated to account for the facts, as incomplete virus was produced when only 1 per cent of the cells had been infected5. This piece of negative evidence brought forward by Cairns and Edney is in itself sufficient to invalidate the hypothesis; here positive proof is furnished that certain strains of influenza virus do not produce incomplete particles even under conditions of multiple infection."
https://openalex.org/W1981351555,"THOUGH soil actinomycetes can sometimes elaborate antibiotics when grown in unamended sterile soil1, it has usually been found necessary to enrich such soils with energy sources in order to demonstrate production of antibiotic2. In unsterile soil cultures, production of actinomycete antibiotics in clearly detectable amounts has only rarely been reported3. The following investigation was made to determine the ability of Streptomyces albidoflavus to inhibit the growth of the fungus Fusarium culmorum under a variety of nutritive conditions and particularly with small amounts of readily available carbohydrate—conditions likely to be unfavourable for luxuriant growth of either organism."
https://openalex.org/W2045428344,"IN attempting to repeat some experiments reported by von Buzagh1, it was noticed that the fibrous precipitate (Fig. 1), formed by adding a 10 per cent sodium chloride solution to a solution of calf Achilles tendon in 1.2 per cent acetic acid, dissolved in 0.9 per cent sodium chloride ; on dialysis of this solution, a fibrous precipitate was re-formed. In contradistinction, the precipitates obtained from solutions of tendon in acetic acid at concentrations more generally used (0.01–0.4 per cent)2 are insoluble in 0.9 per cent sodium chloride. The physical properties of reconstituted collagen thus vary according to the concentration of the acetic acid used for dissolving the original tendon."

https://openalex.org/W1975214448,"MY earlier investigations on the neural gland of tunicates may perhaps throw some light on the origin of the pituitary body in vertebrates. I have adduced evidence1–4 that the neural gland (plus ciliated pit) of tunicates is the homologue of the vertebrate pituitary body. The mouth of the ciliated pit, then, is the homologue of the opening of Rathke's pouch, and as such does not enter into the structure of the pituitary proper. The stage in the development of the tetrapod pituitary at which Rathke's pouch is open is thus a ‘recapitulation’ of a phylogenetic step, still extant in ascidians."

https://openalex.org/W2039881879,"THE naras (Acanihosicyos horrida, Hook) is a cucurbitaceous plant, which occurs particularly near Walvis Bay in South-West Africa. The fruit is a small melon consisting of an outer rind and six segments which contain numerous seeds. The fruits and the seeds derived from them were extensively used as foods by the desert dwellers of the area in earlier days, and are still used to some extent in this way. More recently, the seeds have been collected and exported to South Africa, where they have found use in the confectionery industry. Versfeld and Britten1 found that the seed kernels consist mainly of protein (35 per cent) and fat (53 per cent)."

https://openalex.org/W2019216426,"IN a previous communication, Parmentier and Dustin1 reported a mitotic anomaly in the mouse intestine produced by hydroquinone. The characteristic feature of this was the so-called ‘three-group metaphase’, comprising a normal metaphase plate with additional chromosome particles or groups at each pole of the spindle. One of the authors afterwards described the same phenomenon in the intestine and bone marrow of the golden hamster2. According to the latter, characteristic ‘three-group metaphases’ may also be produced in the rat, whereas “the guinea pig, the chick and chick fibroblast cultures were not responsive as regards this effect”."

https://openalex.org/W2015832837,"IN an investigation relating to the isolation and purification of chorionic gonadotrophin from pregnancy urine, the following problem has arisen : “Does fraction A contain at least the amount X of chorionic gonadotrophin?” It was necessary to answer this question in the shortest possible time and to use as little material of A as possible. As the solution of this rather specialized problem may have a much more general application to researches of similar nature, it is felt to be worth communicating."
