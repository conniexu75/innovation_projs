https://openalex.org/W3091789543,"Training algorithms to computationally plan multistep organic syntheses has been a challenge for more than 50 years1-7. However, the field has progressed greatly since the development of early programs such as LHASA1,7, for which reaction choices at each step were made by human operators. Multiple software platforms6,8-14 are now capable of completely autonomous planning. But these programs 'think' only one step at a time and have so far been limited to relatively simple targets, the syntheses of which could arguably be designed by human chemists within minutes, without the help of a computer. Furthermore, no algorithm has yet been able to design plausible routes to complex natural products, for which much more far-sighted, multistep planning is necessary15,16 and closely related literature precedents cannot be relied on. Here we demonstrate that such computational synthesis planning is possible, provided that the program's knowledge of organic chemistry and data-based artificial intelligence routines are augmented with causal relationships17,18, allowing it to 'strategize' over multiple synthetic steps. Using a Turing-like test administered to synthesis experts, we show that the routes designed by such a program are largely indistinguishable from those designed by humans. We also successfully validated three computer-designed syntheses of natural products in the laboratory. Taken together, these results indicate that expert-level automated synthetic planning is feasible, pending continued improvements to the reaction knowledge base and further code optimization."
https://openalex.org/W3092120579,"The novel COVID-19 pandemic has created chaos around the globe. To curb its spread, the Government of India announced a nationwide lockdown on March 24th, 2020 for 21 days, which was extended further for a longer time. This long period of lockdown disrupted the routine of all citizens, affecting their psychological well-being. While recent studies showed the psychological burden of Indians during the pandemic, no study has assessed whether the psychological toll changed over time due to repeated extensions of the lockdown. We followed up 159 Indian adults during the first two months of the lockdown to assess any change in their anxiety, stress, and depressive symptoms. Multilevel linear regression models of repeated observations nested within individuals adjusted for sociodemographic covariates showed that anxiety (β = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.03, 1.60), stress (β = 0.51, CI: 0.32, 0.70), and depressive symptoms (β = 0.37, CI: 0.13, 0.60) increased over time during the lockdown. This increase was higher among women than men independent of covariates. Individual resilience was negatively associated with adverse psychological outcomes. Our findings suggested that while the lockdown may help in effectively addressing this pandemic, the state and society at large need to be sensitive to the mental health impacts of a long-drawn-out lockdown. Such effects likely have long-term sequelae. The disproportionate impact on women needs immediate attention. Moreover, it behooves society to address the root causes driving the unequal distribution of psychological distress during such crises."
https://openalex.org/W3092082522,"During an epidemic, metrics such as R0, doubling time, and case fatality rates are important in understanding and predicting the course of an epidemic. However, if collected over country or regional scales, these metrics hide important smaller-scale, local dynamics. We examine how commonly used epidemiological metrics differ for each individual state within the United States during the initial COVID-19 outbreak. We found that the detected case number and trajectory of early detected cases differ considerably between states. We then test for correlations with testing protocols, interventions and population characteristics. We find that epidemic dynamics were most strongly associated with non-pharmaceutical government actions during the early phase of the epidemic. In particular, early social distancing restrictions, particularly on restaurant operations, was correlated with increased doubling times. Interestingly, we also found that states with little tolerance for deviance from enforced rules saw faster early epidemic growth. Together with other correlates such as population density, our results highlight the different factors involved in the heterogeneity in the early spread of COVID-19 throughout the United States. Although individual states are clearly not independent, they can serve as small, natural experiments in how different demographic patterns and government responses can impact the course of an epidemic."
https://openalex.org/W3092249517,"Blood-feeding mosquitoes survive by feeding on nectar for metabolic energy but require a blood meal to develop eggs. Aedes aegypti females must accurately discriminate blood and nectar because each meal promotes mutually exclusive feeding programs with distinct sensory appendages, meal sizes, digestive tract targets, and metabolic fates. We investigated the syringe-like blood-feeding appendage, the stylet, and discovered that sexually dimorphic stylet neurons taste blood. Using pan-neuronal calcium imaging, we found that blood is detected by four functionally distinct stylet neuron classes, each tuned to specific blood components associated with diverse taste qualities. Stylet neurons are insensitive to nectar-specific sugars and respond to glucose only in the presence of additional blood components. The distinction between blood and nectar is therefore encoded in specialized neurons at the very first level of sensory detection in mosquitoes. This innate ability to recognize blood is the basis of vector-borne disease transmission to millions of people worldwide."

The oocyte cytoplasm is capable of reprogramming somatic cells to regain totipotency through somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), which enables animal cloning and generation of nuclear transfer embryonic stem cells (ntESCs) (Chen et al., 2020Chen M.

However, the cloning efficiency is extremely low in terms of blastocyst formation and full-term development (Yang et al., 2007Yang X. Smith S.L. Tian X.C. Lewin H.A. Renard J.-P. Wakayama T. Nuclear reprogramming of cloned embryos and its implications for therapeutic cloning.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Recently, researchers have developed multiple methods to improve SCNT efficiency by removing epigenetic barriers. Injection of the mRNAs of Kdm4d or Kdm4b, both H3K9me3 demethylases, into cloned mouse embryos can improve the term development from less than 1% to more than 8% (Liu et al., 2016aLiu W. Liu X.

Embryonic development following somatic cell nuclear transfer impeded by persisting histone methylation.Cell. 2014; 159: 884-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The use of a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), trichostatin A (TSA), can increase the overall cloning efficiency from 1% to 6% (Kishigami et al., 2006Kishigami S. Mizutani E. Ohta H. Hikichi T. Thuan N.V. Wakayama S. Bui H.T. Wakayama T. Significant improvement of mouse cloning technique by treatment with trichostatin A after somatic nuclear transfer.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Role of histone acetylation in reprogramming of somatic nuclei following nuclear transfer.Biol. Reprod. 2006; 74: 1083-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). However, it remains unexplored how HDACi treatment improves SCNT reprogramming. The results from a previous study showed that the combination of Kdm4d injection and TSA treatment could not further increase the cloning efficiency, suggesting that the function of TSA treatment might overlap with H3K9me3 removal (Matoba et al., 2014Matoba S. Liu Y. Lu F. Iwabuchi K.A. Shen L. Inoue A. Zhang Y. Embryonic development following somatic cell nuclear transfer impeded by persisting histone methylation.Cell. 2014; 159: 884-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Although interventions to adjust epigenetic modifications can significantly overcome 2-cell (2C) arrest and allow blastocyst development of SCNT embryos comparable to that of naturally fertilized (NF) embryos, the overall cloning efficiency is still low, indicating that the SCNT embryos are abnormal after implantation. Indeed, extraembryonic tissues, such as the placenta of SCNT embryos, are larger than those of NF embryos, and Xist could be aberrantly activated, leading to aberrant X chromosome inactivation (Inoue et al., 2010Inoue K. Kohda T. Sugimoto M. Sado T. Ogonuki N. Matoba S. Shiura H. Ikeda R. Mochida K. Fujii T. et al.Impeding Xist expression from the active X chromosome improves mouse somatic cell nuclear transfer.Science. 2010; 330: 496-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed the transcription factor (TF) double homeobox (Dux in mouse and DUX4 in human) as a positive TF in activating the mammalian embryonic genome chromatin landscape and regulating the expression of sets of 2C-specific genes (De Iaco et al., 2017De Iaco A.

Conservation and innovation in the DUX4-family gene network.Nat. Genet. 2017; 49: 935-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In addition, our recent study identified a Dux-miR-344-Zmym2 regulatory pathway governing totipotency (Yang et al., 2020aYang F. Huang X. Zang R. Chen J. Fidalgo M. Sanchez-Priego C. Yang J. Caichen A. Ma F. Macfarlan T. et al.DUX-miR-344-ZMYM2-mediated activation of MERVL LTRs induces a totipotent 2C-like state.Cell Stem Cell. 2020; 26: 234-250.e7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). DUX4 and Dux have high similarity within the two DNA-binding homeodomains and the C-terminal domain. DUX4 can recruit the histone acetyltransferases EP300 and CBP (CREB binding protein) by its C-terminal domain and induce local chromatin relaxation and transcriptional activation of nearby genes. Ectopic expression of both DUX4 and Dux was proven to cause global hyperacetylation of histone H3. Both are transiently expressed before the global onset of zygotic genome activation (ZGA) (Choi et al., 2016Choi S.H. Gearhart M.D. Cui Z. Bosnakovski D. Kim M. Schennum N. Kyba M.

The precise temporal regulation of Dux is crucial for embryonic development, and we have demonstrated that prolonged overexpression of Dux can induce developmental arrest of blastomeres with 2C signatures. It is intriguing that Dux maternal and zygotic knockout (KO) (MZ-KO) embryos can survive to adulthood, indicating its more complicated role during embryogenesis (Chen and Zhang, 2019Chen Z. Zhang Y. Loss of DUX causes minor defects in zygotic genome activation and is compatible with mouse development.Nat. Genet. 2019; 51: 947-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar; Guo et al., 2019Guo M.

Tu Z. et al.Precise temporal regulation of Dux is important for embryo development.Cell Res. 2019; 29: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The function of Dux in early embryo development remains elusive. Still, Dux has been utilized as a potent tool for generating 2C-like cells in vitro. Epigenetic reprogramming plays a critical role in the development of SCNT embryos. Aberrant H3K9me3, H3K4me3, and DNA re-methylation were proven to be potent barriers that greatly limited full-term development of SCNT embryos (Gao et al., 2018Gao R. Wang C. Gao Y. Xiu W. Chen J. Kou X. Zhao Y. Liao Y. Bai D.

Embryonic development following somatic cell nuclear transfer impeded by persisting histone methylation.Cell. 2014; 159: 884-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Besides, loss of H3K27me3 imprinting in somatic cells impeded the development of SCNT embryos. And monoallelic deletion of the key H3K27me3-imprinted genes could largely improve SCNT efficiency (Inoue et al., 2020Inoue K. Ogonuki N. Kamimura S. Inoue H. Matoba S. Hirose M. Honda A. Miura K.

Meanwhile, the lysine acetylation on core histones undergoes dramatic changes following SCNT. As indicated in our previous work, the H3K9ac intensity in SCNT embryos was much lower than that in the normal embryos. TSA treatment elevated the H3K9ac signal of SCNT embryos to a level comparable to that of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) embryos, which in turn contributed to the improved development of SCNT embryos (Wang et al., 2007Wang F. Kou Z. Zhang Y. Gao S. Dynamic reprogramming of histone acetylation and methylation in the first cell cycle of cloned mouse embryos.Biol. Reprod. 2007; 77: 1007-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Additionally, H3K9ac marks the active state of promoters and directly boosts the transcriptional elongation of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) (Gates et al., 2017Gates L.A. Shi J. Rohira A.D. Feng Q. Zhu B. Bedford M.T. Sagum C.A. Jung S.Y. Qin J. Tsai M.-J. et al.Acetylation on histone H3 lysine 9 mediates a switch from transcription initiation to elongation.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 14456-14472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, how aberrant acetylation affects the function of key TFs and consequently worsens SCNT efficiency remains enigmatic. In this study, we generated a high-resolution H3K9ac map of both in vitro fertilization (IVF)/NF and SCNT embryos from the 1-cell embryo to the morula stage using ultra-low-input chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ULI-NChIP-seq) and explored the difference in H3K9ac occupancy between IVF/NF and SCNT embryos. We identified aberrantly acetylated regions (AARs) in SCNT embryos as an epigenetic barrier, which contain many genes critical to embryo development that are significantly downregulated or silenced in SCNT embryos. Although TSA treatment can largely fix most AARs and improve SCNT efficiency, its effects are restrained by the native epigenetic environments in donor cumulus cells. Intriguingly, we identified significant enrichment of the Dux motif in the regions with hyper-H3K9ac signals specifically in early 2C (e2C) IVF embryos. Dux is silenced in e2C SCNT embryos. Strikingly, injection of full-length Dux mRNA greatly restores H3K9ac occupancy in AARs, drives 2C activation, and improves SCNT efficiency in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the Dux C-terminal domain is essential to fix aberrant acetylation and promote reprogramming. We also revealed that TSA and Kdm4b improved SCNT efficiency largely dependent on Dux. Our study identifies Dux as a crucial TF that improves SCNT efficiency through a more accurate epigenetic landscape modulation and provides a novel approach to improve mammalian cloning efficiency. In mice, ∼70% of SCNT embryos are arrested at early cleavage stages (Gao et al., 2018Gao R. Wang C. Gao Y. Xiu W. Chen J. Kou X. Zhao Y. Liao Y. Bai D.

Inoue K. Wakayama T. Recent advancements in cloning by somatic cell nuclear transfer.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2013; 368: 20110329Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Our previous study demonstrated a defective global H3K9ac modification in SCNT embryos compared to ICSI embryos, whereas TSA treatment can efficiently fix this defect, especially from the 1C to the 2C stage (Wang et al., 2007Wang F. Kou Z. Zhang Y. Gao S. Dynamic reprogramming of histone acetylation and methylation in the first cell cycle of cloned mouse embryos.Biol. Reprod. 2007; 77: 1007-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, the potential mechanism by which H3K9ac occupancy improves reprogramming efficiency in SCNT remains elusive. To address this, we used ULI-NChIP-seq to generate a genome-wide landscape of H3K9ac signal during early embryo development (Figure 1A). The global H3K9ac profiles are highly correlated between ULI-NChIP-seq and the ENCODE project using massive cells (Figure S1A). Moreover, ULI-NChIP-seq results using as few as 200 cells fully recapitulate the H3K9ac peaks in the ENCODE project (Figure S1B). The H3K9ac signal was highly reproducible between the replicates (Figure S1C). In accordance with our previous study, we observed a global hypo-H3K9ac signal in SCNT embryos, whereas TSA treatment quickly and significantly increased genome-wide H3K9ac. However, after TSA removal, the level of H3K9ac in SCNT embryos declined and was still lower than that of IVF embryos at the 2C stage (Figures S1D–S1G). We then scanned the genome with a 5-kb sliding window to identify regions with aberrant H3K9ac signal intensity in SCNT embryos compared to IVF/NF embryos at each developmental stage. The regions with aberrantly high H3K9ac signals in SCNT embryos are termed aberrantly highly acetylated regions (AHARs). Similarly, the regions with aberrantly low H3K9ac signals in SCNT embryos are termed aberrantly low acetylated regions (ALARs). AHARs and ALARs together make up the AARs (refer to Data S1). The number of AHARs and ALARs precipitously decreased from 1C SCNT embryos to morula embryos (Figures 1B and 1C). Consistently, ALARs covered more genomic regions than AHARs in the first two cell cycles, which was in line with the immunostaining results (Figures S1D–S1G and S2A). Of note, both ALARs and AHARs accounted for a small fraction of the genome in late 2C (l2C) and morula embryos (Figure S2A). These findings together imply that these AARs are successfully reprogrammed by the l2C stage as long as SCNT embryos develop to the l2C and later stages. Alternatively, SCNT embryos with many AARs might fail to develop to the l2C or later stages. It was reported that H3K9me3 was enriched in reprogramming-resistant regions (RRRs) in donor somatic cells (Matoba et al., 2014Matoba S. Liu Y. Lu F. Iwabuchi K.A. Shen L. Inoue A. Zhang Y. Embryonic development following somatic cell nuclear transfer impeded by persisting histone methylation.Cell. 2014; 159: 884-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Consistent with that, H3K9ac in RRRs was significantly lower in early SCNT embryos than in IVF embryos (Figure S2B). Intriguingly, AHARs were significantly enriched for H3K9ac and DNase I signals but depleted for H3K9me3 signals in donor cumulus cells compared to ALARs (Figure 1D; Djekidel et al., 2018Djekidel M.N. Inoue A. Matoba S. Suzuki T. Zhang C. Lu F. Jiang L. Zhang Y. Reprogramming of chromatin accessibility in somatic cell nuclear transfer is DNA replication independent.Cell Rep. 2018; 23: 1939-1947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This indicates that chromatin states of donor cells have an important impact on AARs in SCNT embryos. Further analysis found that most AARs in 2C embryos were inherited from 1C embryos and resisted reprogramming. In contrast, only ∼37% of AARs in morula embryos were inherited from 1C embryos (Figure S2C). This suggested that a majority of inherited AARs were faithfully remodeled in successfully reprogrammed morula embryos, whereas new AARs formed as well during the first cell fate determination at the morula stage (Figures 1B and S2C). Particularly, the H3K9ac signal in X chromosome inactivation center (XIC) was precipitously increased from 1C to morula SCNT embryos and became significantly higher than that in morula NF embryos (Figures 1E and S2D). In contrast, H3K9ac signal levels in X chromosomes were similar between SCNT and NF morula embryos (Figure S2D). These results clearly demonstrated that the aberrant increase in H3K9ac signal at Xist loci in SCNT embryos is not an artifact from the X dose difference between SCNT embryos (XX donor cumulus cells) and NF embryos (both XX and XY). Together, these results suggested that SCNT embryos showed abnormalities in H3K9ac signal before entering differentiation, which might account for the low blastocyst rate and further influence implantation. To investigate the potential function of aberrant H3K9ac in the temporal regulation of gene expression during early embryo development, we calculated and compared H3K9ac levels in the promoters of different gene sets between IVF/NF and SCNT embryos. Strikingly, H3K9ac levels in the promoters of the 2C-specific genes were significantly lower in SCNT embryos than in IVF embryos throughout the 2C stage (Figure S2E). Interestingly, the expression levels of genes within AHARs were greatly increased in SCNT embryos compared to IVF/NF embryos. The pattern was opposite for genes within ALARs (Figures S2F and S2G). This finding suggests that aberrant histone H3K9ac is an important epigenetic impediment for appropriate 2C gene activation. TSA, an HDAC inhibitor, has been widely utilized to improve SCNT efficiency (Akagi et al., 2011Akagi S. Matsukawa K. Mizutani E. Fukunari K. Kaneda M. Watanabe S. Takahashi S.

Reprogram. 2010; 12: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In order to understand how TSA improves reprogramming efficiency, we first profiled gene expression changes in SCNT embryos upon TSA treatment. There were a few hundred differentially expressed genes between l2C SCNT embryos treated with and without TSA (Figure S3A). This is consistent with a previous study showing limited effects on gene expression in SCNT embryos upon TSA treatment (Inoue et al., 2015Inoue K. Oikawa M. Kamimura S. Ogonuki N. Nakamura T. Nakano T. Abe K. Ogura A. Trichostatin A specifically improves the aberrant expression of transcription factor genes in embryos produced by somatic cell nuclear transfer.Sci. Rep. 2015; 5: 10127Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TSA showed heterogeneity in gene recovery. For example, TSA only fully rescued some genes, whereas others, such as Sall4 and Ezh2, exhibited partial rescue. However, certain genes essential for preimplantation development failed to be rescued, such as the 2C gene Zscan4d (Figure S3B; Eckersley-Maslin et al., 2016Eckersley-Maslin M.A. Svensson V. Krueger C. Stubbs T.M. Giehr P. Krueger F. Miragaia R.J. Kyriakopoulos C. Berrens R.V.

TSA treatment results in extensive changes in the H3K9ac landscape in SCNT embryos and could greatly increase the development potential of SCNT embryos (Figures S1D–S1G, S2A, and S2B; Table S1). Therefore, we next examined how TSA altered H3K9ac occupancy in the AARs in SCNT embryos. Surprisingly, TSA quickly and greatly restored H3K9ac levels in most AARs to levels resembling those of IVF embryos (Figures 2C and S3C). Of note, there still existed certain regions in which the aberrant H3K9ac signal in SCNT embryos failed to be fixed by TSA treatment (Figures"
https://openalex.org/W3092611015,"Recent animal research indicates that dopamine and serotonin, neuromodulators traditionally linked to appetitive and aversive processes, are also involved in sensory inference and decisions based on such inference. We tested this hypothesis in humans by monitoring sub-second striatal dopamine and serotonin signaling during a visual motion discrimination task that separates sensory uncertainty from decision difficulty in a factorial design. Caudate nucleus recordings (n = 4) revealed multi-scale encoding: in three participants, serotonin tracked sensory uncertainty, and, in one participant, both dopamine and serotonin tracked deviations from expected trial transitions within our factorial design. Putamen recordings (n = 1) supported a cognition-action separation between caudate nucleus and putamen-a striatal sub-division unique to primates-with both dopamine and serotonin tracking decision times. These first-of-their-kind observations in the human brain reveal a role for sub-second dopamine and serotonin signaling in non-reward-based aspects of cognition and action."

However, little is known about the extent of financial Conflicts of Interest (FCOIs) related to pharmaceutical companies (Pharma) selling dermatology prescription products and dermatology CPG authors in Japan. The aims of this study were to elucidate the characteristics and distribution of payments from Pharma to dermatology CPG authors in Japan, and to evaluate the extent of transparency and accuracy in their FCOI disclosures. We analyzed the records of 296 authors from 32 dermatology CPGs published by the Japanese Dermatological Association from the beginning of 2015 to the end of 2018. Using the payment data reported by 79 Pharma between 2016-2017 in Japan, we investigated the characteristics of the CPG authors and the payments from the Pharma to them. Furthermore, we evaluated the transparency and accuracy of the FCOI disclosures of the individual CPG authors. Of the 296 CPGs authors, 269 authors (90.6%) received at least one payment from the Pharma. The total monetary value of payments for the 2-year period was $7,128,762. The median and mean monetary value of payments from the Pharma reporting were $10,281 (interquartile range $2,796 -$34,962) and $26,600 (standard deviation $40,950) for the two years combined. Of the 26 CPG authors who disclosed FCOIs due to the monies received from Pharma, only the atopic dermatitis CPG authors and the acne vulgaris CPG authors published their potential FCOIs. In Japan, most dermatology CPG authors received financial payments from Pharma. The transparency of the CPGs, as reported by the CPG authors, was inadequate, and a more rigorous framework of reporting and monitoring FCOI disclosure is required to improve the accuracy and transparency with relation to possible Conflicts of Interest."

Boundary layer height (BLH) and relative humidity (RH) were shown to be two major factors influencing the relationship between AOD and ground-level PM2.5 concentration. Thus, they are used to correct MODIS AOD to enhance the correlation between MODIS AOD and PM2.5. When using corrected MODIS AOD for modelling, the correlation between MODIS AOD and PM2.5 was improved significantly. Then, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), surface temperature (ST) and surface wind speed (SPD) were introduced as auxiliary variables to further improve the performance of the corrected regression model. The seasonal and annual average distribution of PM2.5 concentration over Beijing from 2014 to 2016 were mapped for intuitively analysing. Those can be regarded as important references for monitoring the ground-level PM2.5 concentration distribution. It is obviously that the PM2.5 concentration distribution over Beijing revealed the trend of “southeast high and northwest low”, and showed a significant decrease in annual average PM2.5 concentration from 2014 to 2016."

In this large-scale cluster-randomized controlled trial (cRCT) we sought to assess the effectiveness of facemasks against viral respiratory infections.


Methods and results 
Over three consecutive Hajj seasons (2013, 2014, 2015) pilgrims’ tents in Makkah were allocated to ‘facemask’ or ‘no facemask’ group. Fifty facemasks were offered to participants in intervention tents, to be worn over four days, and none were offered to participants in control tents. All participants recorded facemask use and respiratory symptoms in health diaries. Nasal swabs were collected from the symptomatic for virus detection by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Clinical symptoms and laboratory results were analyzed by ‘intention- to-treat’ and ‘per-protocol’. A total of 7687 adult participants from 318 tents were randomized: 3864 from 149 tents to the intervention group, and 3823 from 169 tents to the control group. Participants were aged 18 to 95 (median 34, mean 37) years, with a male to female ratio of 1:1.2. Overall, respiratory viruses were detected in 277 of 650 (43%) nasal/pharyngeal swabs collected from symptomatic pilgrims. Common viruses were rhinovirus (35.1%), influenza (4.5%) and parainfluenza (1.7%). In the intervention arm, respectively 954 (24.7%) and 1842 (47.7%) participants used facemasks daily and intermittently, while in the control arm, respectively 546 (14.3%) and 1334 (34.9%) used facemasks daily and intermittently. By intention-to-treat analysis, facemask use did not seem to be effective against laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infections (odds ratio [OR], 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9 to 2.1, p = 0.18) nor against clinical respiratory infection (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.9 to 1.4, p = 0.40). Similarly, in a per-protocol analysis, facemask use did not seem to be effective against laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infections (OR 1.2, 95% CI 0.9–1.7, p = 0.26) nor against clinical respiratory infection (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0–1.8, p = 0.06).


Conclusion 
This trial was unable to provide conclusive evidence on facemask efficacy against viral respiratory infections most likely due to poor adherence to protocol."
https://openalex.org/W3092541804,"During the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic there is unprecedented demand for personal protective equipment (PPE), especially N95 respirators and surgical masks. The ability of SARS-CoV-2 to be transmitted via respiratory droplets from asymptomatic individuals has necessitated increased usage of both N95 respirators in the healthcare setting and masks (both surgical and homemade) in public spaces. These precautions rely on two fundamental principles of transmission prevention: particle filtration and droplet containment. The former is the focus of NIOSH N95 testing guidelines, and the latter is an FDA guideline for respirators and surgical masks. While studies have investigated droplet containment to provide guidance for homemade mask production, limited work has been done to characterize the filtration efficiency (FE) of materials used in home mask making. In this work, we demonstrate the low-cost (<$300) conversion of standard equipment used to fit-test respirators in hospital and industrial settings into a setup that measures quantitative FEs of materials based on NIOSH N95 guidelines, and subsequently measure FEs of materials found in healthcare and consumer spaces. These materials demonstrate significant variability in filtration characteristics, even for visually similar materials. We demonstrate a FE of 96.49% and pressure drop of 25.4 mmH20 for a double-layer of sterilization wrap used in surgical suites and a FE of 90.37% for a combination of consumer-grade materials. The excellent filtration characteristics of the former demonstrate potential utility for emergent situations when N95 respirators are not available, while those of the latter demonstrate that a high FE can be achieved using publicly available materials."
https://openalex.org/W3092051153,"Background Many physicians regard the combination of encephalopathy, subdural haemorrhage (SDH), retinal haemorrhage (RH), rib fractures, and classical metaphyseal lesions (CML) as highly specific for abusive head trauma (AHT). However, without observed abuse or other criteria that are independent of these findings, bias risk is high. Methods Infants subjected for examination under the suspicion of maltreatment during the period 1997–2014 were identified in the National Patient Registry, International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10 SE). The medical records were scrutinized for identification of cases of witnessed or admitted physical abuse by shaking. The main outcome measures were occurrence of SDH, RH, fractures and skin lesions. Results All identified 36 infants had been shaken, and for 6, there was information indicating blunt force impact immediately after shaking. In 30 cases, there were no findings of SDH or RH, rib fractures, or CMLs. Six infants had finding(s) suggestive of physical abuse, two with possible acute intracranial pathology. One infant with combined shaking and impact trauma had hyperdense SDH, hyperdense subarachnoid haemorrhage, suspected cortical vein thrombosis, RH, and bruises. Another infant abused by shaking had solely an acute subarachnoid haemorrhage. Both had pre-existing vulnerability. The first was born preterm and had non-specific frontal subcortical changes. The other had bilateral chronic SDH/hygroma. Conclusions The present findings do not support the hypothesis that acute SDH or RH can be caused by isolated shaking of a healthy infant. However, they do suggest that abuse by shaking may cause acute intracranial haemorrhage with RH in infants with certain risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W3092083841,"Introduction Most communities, rural or urban, have taboos regarding foods to avoid during pregnancy, and most have local explanations for why certain foods should be avoided. Such taboos may have health benefits, but they also can have large nutritional and health costs to mothers and fetuses. As such, understanding local pregnancy food taboos is an important public health goal, especially in contexts where food resources are limited. Despite this, information regarding food taboos is limited in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study assessed food taboos, related misconceptions, and associated factors among pregnant women in Northern Ethiopia. Methods A cross-sectional study of 332 pregnant women in antenatal care (ANC) follow-up at selected private clinics in Mekelle city, Tigray, Ethiopa, recruited between April and May, 2017. Using a semi-structured questionnaire, we assessed whether respondents’ observed food taboos, what types of foods they avoided, their perceived reasons for avoidance, diversity of respondents’ diets during pregnancy, and respondents’ socio-demographic characteristics. After reporting frequency statistics for categorical variables and central tendencies (mean and standard deviation) of continuous variables, bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the socio-demographic factors and diet diversity associated with food taboo practices. Results Around 12% of the pregnant women avoided at least one type of food during their current pregnancy for one or more reasons. These mothers avoided eating items such as yogurt, banana, legumes, honey, and “kollo” (roasted barley and wheat). The most common reasons given for the avoidances were that the foods were (mistakenly) believed to cause: abortion; abdominal cramps in the mother and newborn; prolonged labor; or coating of the fetus’s body. Maternal education (diploma and above) (AOR: 4.55, 95% CI: 1.93, 10.31) and marital status (single) were found to be negatively associated (protective factors) with observances of pregnancy food taboos. Approximately 79% of respondents had pregnancy diets that were insufficiently diverse, although we did not find any statistical evidence that this was associated with adhering to food taboos. Conclusion The misconceptions related to pregnancy food taboos should be discouraged insofar as they may restrict women’s consumption of nutritious foods which could support maternal health and healthy fetal development. Health providers should counsel pregnant women and their husbands about appropriate pregnancy nutrition during ANC visits."

https://openalex.org/W3092386717,"Our field data from the Upper Palaeolithic site of Al-Ansab 1 (Jordan) and from a pollen sequence in the Dead Sea elucidate the role that changing Steppe landscapes played in facilitating anatomically modern human populations to enter a major expansion and consolidation phase, known as the „Early Ahmarian“, several millennia subsequent to their initial Marine Isotope Stage 4/3 migration from Africa, into the Middle East. The Early Ahmarian techno-cultural unit covers a time range between 45 ka–37 ka BP. With so far more than 50 sites found, the Early Ahmarian is the first fully Upper Palaeolithic techno-cultural unit exclusively and undisputedly related to anatomically modern human populations. In order to better understand the potentially attractive features of the Early Ahmarian environmental context that supported its persistence for over 8,000 years, we carried out a decennial research program in Jordan and in the Dead Sea. This included (1) a geoscientific and archaeological survey program in the Wadi Sabra (Jordan) with a particular focus on excavations at the Early Ahmarian site of Al-Ansab 1 alongside the detailed analysis of Quaternary sediments from the same area and (2) palaeobotanical research based on Quaternary lake deposits from the Dead Sea. Our pollen data from the Dead Sea indicate slow, low frequency vegetational variation with expanding Artemisia steppe, from 60 to 20 ka BP (MIS 3–2). Here, we see a reciprocal assimilation of southern and northern Levantine vegetation zones thereby enhancing a long-lasting south-to-north steppe corridor. The same integration process accelerated about 40 ka ago, when forested areas retreated in the Lebanese Mountains. The process then extended to encompass an area from Southern Lebanon to the Sinai Peninsula. We argue that, at the same time, the carriers of the Early Ahmarian techno-cultural unit extended their habitat from their original Mediterranean biome (in the North) to the Saharo-Arabian biome (to the South). Our excavation of Al-Ansab 1, a campsite at the eastern margins of the Early Ahmarian settlement area, indicates far reaching annual movements of small, highly mobile hunter-gatherer groups. We assume a low degree of settlement complexity, still allowing for habitat extension of the Early Ahmarian into the margins of the Levantine corridor. Due to our radiometric dates, our combined archaeological and environmental record sheds light on an evolved phase of the Early Ahmarian, around 38 ka ago, rather than the starting phase of this techno-cultural unit. Possible application of our model to the starting phase of the Early Ahmarian remains an aspect of future research."

Hemorrhagic complications represent one of the most common complications during ECMO, and can be life threatening. The purpose of this study was to elucidate pathophysiological mechanisms of ECMO-associated hemorrhagic complications and their impact on standard and viscoelastic coagulation tests. The study cohort included 27 patients treated VV-ECMO or VA-ECMO. Hemostasis was evaluated using standard coagulation tests and viscoelastic parameters investigated rotational thromboelastometry. Anticoagulation and hemorrhagic complications were analyzed for up to seven days depending on ECMO duration. Hemorrhagic complications developed in 16 (59%) patients. There were 102 discrete hemorrhagic episodes among 116 24-hour-intervals, of which 27% were considered to be clinically significant. The highest number of ECMO-associated hemorrhages occurred on the 2nd and 3rd day of treatment. Respiratory tract was the most common hemorrhagic complication, occurring in 62% of the 24-hour intervals. All 24-hours-intervals were divided into two groups: with bleeding and without bleeding. The probability of hemorrhage was significantly associated abnormalities of four parameters: increased international normalized ratio (INR, sensitivity 71%, specificity 94%), increased prothrombin time (PT, sensitivity 90%, specificity 72%), decreased intrinsic pathway maximal clot firmness (MCFin, sensitivity 76%, specificity 89%), and increased extrinsic pathway clot formation time (CFTex, sensitivity 77%, specificity 87%). In conclusions, early ECMO-associated hemorrhagic complications are related to one traditional and two novel viscoelastic coagulation abnormalities: PT/INR elevation, reduced maximum clot firmness due to intrinsic pathway dysfunction (MCFin), and prolonged clot formation time due to extrinsic pathway dysfunction (CFTex). When managing hemostasis during ECMO, derangements in PT/INR, MCFin and CFTex should be focused on."
https://openalex.org/W3092607704,"To convert external light into internal neural signal, vertebrates rely on a special group of proteins, the visual opsins. Four of the five types of visual opsins-short-wavelength sensitive 1 (Sws1), short-wavelength sensitive 2 (Sws2), medium-wavelength sensitive (Rh2), and long-wavelength sensitive (Lws)-are expressed in cone cells for scotopic vision, with the fifth, rhodopsin (Rh1), being expressed in rod cells for photopic vision. Fish often display differing ontogenetic cone opsin expression profiles, which may be related to dietary and/or habitat ontogenetic shift. The western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) is an aggressive invader that has successfully colonized every continent except Antarctica. The strong invasiveness of this species may be linked to its visual acuity since it can inhabit turbid waters better than other fishes. By genome screening and transcriptome analysis, we identify seven cone opsin genes in the western mosquitofish, including one sws1, two sws2, one rh2, and three lws. The predicted maximal absorbance wavelength (λmax) values of the respective proteins are 353 nm for Sws1, 449 nm for Sws2a, 408 nm for Sws2b, 516 nm for Rh2-1, 571 nm for Lws-1, and 519 nm for Lws-3. Retention of an intron in the lws-r transcript likely renders this visual opsin gene non-functional. Our real-time quantitative PCR demonstrates that adult male and female western mosquitofish do not differ in their cone opsin expression profiles, but we do reveal an ontogenetic shift in cone opsin expression. Compared to adults, larvae express proportionally more sws1 and less lws-1, suggesting that the western mosquitofish is more sensitive to shorter wavelengths in the larval stage, but becomes more sensitive to longer wavelengths in adulthood."

Although it affects child health, little is known about the extent of the problem and its contributing factors in the study area. Therefore, this study aimed to figure the prevalence of pre-lacteal feeding practices and associated factors among mothers of children aged less than 12 months in Jinka Town. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted at Jinka Town from March 1 to 30, 2019. A total of 430 mothers, having children less than 12 months of age, were selected by systematic sampling technique. The data were collected by using pretested and interviewer- administered structured questionnaires. The data were entered using epidata 4.2.1 and exported to SPSS version 23 for analysis. Adjusted odds ratios, 95% confidence intervals and p-values were reported. Results The prevalence of pre-lacteal feeding practice was 12.6% [95% CI (9.5–15.7)]. Having no maternal education [AOR = 4.82(95%CI 1.60–14.24)], colostrum avoidance [AOR = 4.09(95% CI 1.62–7.67)], lack of breast feeding counseling [AOR: = 2.51(95% CI 1.20–5.25)], home delivery [AOR = 3.34 (95% CI 1.52–7.33)], lack of knowledge about risks of pre-lacteal feeding [AOR = 2.86 (95% CI 1.30–6.29] and poor knowledge on breast feeding practices [AOR = 3.63(95% CI 1.62–8.11)] were factors associated with pre-lacteal feeding practices. Conclusion Pre-lacteal feeding practice among mothers of children aged less than 12 months in Jinka town was found to be higher than the national prevalence. Illiterate, colostrum avoidance, lack of breastfeeding counseling, home delivery, lack of knowledge on the risk of pre-lacteal feeding, and poor knowledge on breastfeeding practice were factors associated with pre-lacteal feeding practices."

https://openalex.org/W3092628181,"Land is a scarce resource and its depletion is related to a combination of demographic and economic factors. Hence, the changes in dietary habits and increase in world population that upturn the food demand, are intertwined with a context of increasing oil prices and rise of green capitalism that in turn impacts the demand in biofuel. A visible indicator of these phenomena is the increase, in recent years, of Large Scale Land Acquisitions (LSLAs) by private companies or states. Such land investments often lead to conflicts with local population and have raised issues regarding people's rights, the role of different production models and land governance. The aim of this work is to show how publicly available data about LSLAs can be modeled into complex network structures, thus showing how the application of advanced network analysis techniques can be used to better understand land trade dynamics. We use data collected by the Land Matrix Initiative on LSLAs to model three land trade networks: a multi-sector network, a network centered on the mining sector and a network centered on the agriculture one. Then we provide an extended analysis of such networks which includes: (i) a structural analysis, (ii) the definition of a score, namely LSLA-score, which allows to rank the countries based on their investing/target role in the land trade network, (iii) an analysis of the land trade context which takes into account the LSLA-score ranking and the correlation between network features and several country development indicators, (iv) an analysis centered on the discover and analysis of network motifs (i.e., recurring patterns in the land trade network), which provides insights into complex and diverse relations between countries. Our analyses showed how the land trade market is massively characterized by a Global North-Global South dynamic, even if the investing power of emerging economies also has a major impact in creating relations between different sub-regions of the world.

The consequences of these deaths can be detrimental to the women; some ending up with postpartum depression. We examined the association between perinatal death and postpartum depression among women in Lira district, Northern Uganda. Methods We conducted a community-based cross-sectional study of 1,789 women. Trained research assistants screened women for postpartum depressive symptoms on day 50 postpartum using the Edinburgh postpartum depression scale (EPDS). Socio-demographic, economic, birth and survival status of the neonate were collected during pregnancy and within one week postpartum. We used generalized estimating equation for the Poisson family with a log link using Stata to estimate the prevalence ratio of the association between postpartum depressive symptoms (EPDS scores ≥14) and perinatal death. Mothers who lost their babies between 7–49 days postpartum were excluded. Results Of the 1,789 participants symptomatically screened for postpartum depression, 377 (21.1%) [95% confidence interval (95%CI): 17.2%, 23.0%] had probable depressive symptoms. The prevalence of postpartum depressive symptoms among the 77 women who had experienced perinatal death (37 stillbirths and 40 early neonatal deaths (≤7 days of life)) was 62.3% [95% CI: 50.8%, 72.6%] compared to 19.2% [95% CI: 17.4%, 21.2%], among 1,712 with live infants at day 50 postpartum. Women who had experienced a perinatal death were three times as likely to have postpartum depressive symptoms as those who had a live birth [adjusted prevalence ratio 3.45 (95% CI: 2.67, 4.48)]. Conclusions The prevalence of postpartum depressive symptoms, assessed by EPDS, was high among women who had had a perinatal death in Northern Uganda. Women experiencing a perinatal death need to be screened for postpartum depressive symptoms in order to intervene and reduce associated morbidity."
https://openalex.org/W3091793662,"Acute inflammation begins with leukocyte P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) binding to P-selectin on inflamed endothelium and platelets. In pathologic conditions, this process may contribute to secondary organ damage, like sepsis-induced liver injury. Therefore, developing novel therapies to attenuate inflammation may be beneficial. We previously reported that recombinant human vimentin (rhVim) binds P-selectin to block leukocyte adhesion to endothelium and platelets. In this study, we used SPOT-peptide arrays to identify the rod domain as the active region within rhVim that interacts with P-selectin. Indeed, recombinant human rod domain of vimentin (rhRod) binds to P-selectin with high affinity, with in silico modeling suggesting that rhRod binds P-selectin at or near the PSGL-1 binding site. Using bio-layer interferometry, rhRod decreases PSGL-1 binding to immobilized P-selectin, corroborating the in silico data. Under parallel-plate flow, rhRod blocks leukocyte adhesion to fibrin(ogen)-captured platelets, P-selectin/Fc-coated channels, and IL-1β/IL-4-co-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Finally, using intravital microscopy in endotoxemic C57Bl/6 mice, rhRod co-localizes with P-selectin in the hepatic sinusoids and decreases neutrophil adhesion to hepatic sinusoids. These data suggest a potential role for rhRod in attenuating inflammation through directly blocking P-selectin-PSGL-1 interactions."
https://openalex.org/W3091815271,"Objective To understand how pre-injury health status present five-years preceding traumatic brain injury (TBI) affects direct medical cost two years post-injury. Methods Patients age ≥19 years in the emergency department (ED) or acute care for a TBI between April 1, 2007 and March 31, 2014 in Ontario, Canada (N = 55,669) were identified from population-based health administrative data. Forty-three factors of pre-injury health status (i.e., comorbidities and personal, social, and environmental factors) that were internally validated for the TBI population were assessed in this study. The outcome of interest was direct medical cost within two years of discharge. Sex-specific multivariable linear regressions were conducted to understand the associations between direct medical cost within two years of discharge and pre-injury health status. Results Patients who received care in the ED (81.9% of total sample) incurred a median cost of $2,492/male patient (average $12,342/patient) and $3,508/female patient (average $65,285/patient) within two years of injury; 37 pre-injury factors were significantly associated with increased direct medical costs. Patients who first received care for their TBI in acute care (18.1%) incurred a median cost of $25,081/male patient (average $63,060/patient) and $30,277/female patient (average $65,285/patient) within two years of injury; 21 factors were significantly associated with increased direct medical costs. Among more prevalent factors, those associated with increased medical cost by at least 50% included mental health disorders, substance abuse, disorders or medical conditions frequently observed among the elderly, cardiovascular disorders, stroke and emergencies involving the brain, metabolic disorders and abdominal symptoms, conditions and symptoms of abdomen and pelvis, genitourinary disorders and disorders of prostate, and pulmonary abdominal and other emergencies. Conclusions Direct medical costs two years post-TBI differed significantly between patients with and without adverse pre-existing health status. Interdisciplinary teams to promote early identification of pre-existing health conditions and appropriate management and integration of these conditions in TBI care across the continuum of healthcare may be opportunities to reduce direct medical costs post-injury."
https://openalex.org/W3091943176,"Dormant season livestock grazing reduces reliance on harvested feeds, but typically requires protein supplementation to maintain animal performance. Individual variation in supplement intake can impact animal performance; however, it is unknown if this variation leads to individual or herd-level effects on grazing behavior, resource utilization, and grazing impacts to native rangelands. To examine effects of protein supplementation on dormant season cattle resource use and, subsequently, post-grazing habitat conditions, we examined cattle grazing behavior, resource utilization and biomass removal of vegetation on a native rangeland in Montana. A commercial herd of 272 (yr 1) and 302 (yr 2) cows grazed a 329-ha rangeland pasture from November to January. Intake of a 30% crude protein supplement was measured for each individual. Five individuals within each of six age groups were equipped with GPS collars. Time spent grazing declined with supplement intake ( = −0.05 ± 0.02; P < 0.01). Distance traveled per day had a positive asymptotic association with supplement intake ( = 0.35 ± 0.09; P < 0.01). On average, resource utilization by cattle grazing dormant season forage decreased with terrain ruggedness ( = −0.09 ± 0.03), but was unrelated to aspect, temperature and wind speed. Notably, we observed high individual variability in resource utilization for elevation, distance from supplement and water. A post-hoc analysis suggested that individual attributes (age, body weight, supplement intake) influenced cattle resource use. At moderate stocking rates, dormant season livestock grazing did not affect residual vegetation conditions (P values > 0.22). However, residual cover of forbs and litter increased with relative grazing intensity ( = 1.04 ± 0.41; = 3.06 ± 0.89; P ≤ 0.05). In summary, high individual variability in grazing resource utilization of cattle suggests individual-level factors could be the dominant drivers in grazing behavior and landscape use."
https://openalex.org/W3092351957,"Objective We examined whether the role of maternal education in children’s unhealthy snacking diet is moderated by other socio-economic indicators. Methods Participants were selected from the Amsterdam Born Children and their Development cohort, a large ongoing community-based birth cohort. Validated Food Frequency Questionnaires (FFQ) (n = 2782) were filled in by mothers of children aged 5.7±0.5yrs. Based on these FFQs, a snacking dietary pattern was derived using Principal Component Analysis. Socio-economic indicators were: maternal and paternal education (low, middle, high; based on the highest education completed) household finance (low, high; based on ability to save money) and neighbourhood SES (composite score including educational level, household income and employment status of residents per postal code). Cross-sectional multivariable linear regression analysis was used to assess the association and possible moderation of maternal education and other socio-economic indicators on the snacking pattern score. Analyses were adjusted for children’s age, sex and ethnicity. Results Low maternal education (B 0.95, 95% CI 0.83;1.06), low paternal education (B 0.36, 95% CI 0.20;0.52), lower household finance (B 0.18, 95% CI 0.11;0.26) and neighbourhood SES (B -0.09, 95% CI -0.11;-0.06) were independently associated with higher snacking pattern scores (p<0.001). The association between maternal education and the snacking pattern score was somewhat moderated by household finance (p = 0.089) but remained strong. Children from middle-high educated mothers (B 0.44, 95% CI 0.35;0.52) had higher snacking pattern scores when household finance was low (B 0.49, 95% CI 0.33;0.65). Conclusions All socio-economic indicators were associated with increased risk of unhealthy dietary patterns in young children, with low maternal education conferring the highest risk. Yet, within the group of middle-high educated mothers, lower household finance was an extra risk factor for unhealthy dietary patterns. Intervention strategies should therefore focus on lower educated mothers and middle-high educated mothers with insufficient levels of household finance."
https://openalex.org/W3092439282,"Background Adults with IgG subclass deficiency (IgGSD) with subnormal IgG2 are inadequately characterized. Methods We retrospectively analyzed observations in unrelated adults with IgGSD evaluated in a single hematology clinic (1991–2019) and selected those with subnormal serum IgG2 (<117 mg/dL (<1.2 g/L)) without corticosteroid therapy to describe: age; prevalence of women; upper/lower respiratory infection; autoimmune condition(s); atopy; other allergy; frequent or severe respiratory tract infection in first-degree relatives; IgG, IgG subclasses, IgA, and IgM; blood lymphocyte subpopulations; human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A and -B types and haplotypes; and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination (PPSV23) responses. We determined the prevalence of subnormal IgG2 among unrelated adults with IgGSD without corticosteroid therapy and compared general characteristics of those with and without subnormal IgG2. Results There were 18 patients (94.4% women) with subnormal IgG2. Mean age was 52 ± 11 y. Upper/lower respiratory infection occurred in 94.4%/74.8%, respectively. Autoimmune condition(s), atopy, other allergy, and frequent or severe respiratory infection in first-degree relatives occurred in 44.4%, 44.4%, 61.1%, and 22.2%, respectively. Median IgG2 was 105 mg/dL (83, 116). Subnormal IgG, IgG1, IgG3, IgG4, IgA, and IgM was observed in 66.7%, 50.0%, 100.0%, 5.6%, 33.3%, and 0%, respectively. Lymphocyte subpopulations were normal in most patients. HLA frequencies were similar in patients and controls. Three of 4 patients had no protective S. pneumoniae serotype-specific IgG levels before or after PPSV23. These 18 patients represent 7.6% of 236 adults with IgGSD. Prevalence of subnormal IgG, subnormal IgG3, and subnormal IgA was significantly greater in 18 adults with subnormal IgG2 than 218 adults without subnormal IgG2. Prevalence of subnormal IgM was significantly lower in patients with subnormal IgG2. Conclusions Characteristics of adults with IgGSD with subnormal IgG2 include female predominance, other immunologic abnormalities, subnormal IgG3 and/or IgG1, lack of HLA-A and -B association, and suboptimal PPSV23 response."
https://openalex.org/W3092523360,"The NKL-code describes normal expression patterns of NKL homeobox genes in hematopoiesis. Aberrant expression of NKL homeobox gene subclass members have been reported in several hematopoietic malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we analyzed the oncogenic role of the HMX-group of NKL homeobox genes in AML. Public expression profiling data–available for HMX1 and HMX2—indicate aberrant activity of HMX2 in circa 2% AML patients overall, rising to 31% in those with KMT2A/MLL rearrangements whereas HMX1 expression remains inconspicuous. AML cell lines EOL-1, MV4-11 and MOLM-13 expressed both, HMX2 and neighboring HMX3 genes, and harbored KMT2A aberrations, suggesting their potential functional association. Surprisingly, knockdown experiments in these cell lines demonstrated that KMT2A inhibited HMX2/3 which, in turn, did not regulate KMT2A expression. Furthermore, karyotyping and genomic profiling analysis excluded rearrangements of the HMX2/3 locus in these cell lines. However, comparative expression profiling and subsequent functional analyses revealed that IRF8, IL7- and WNT-signalling activated HMX2/3 expression while TNFa/NFkB- signalling proved inhibitory. Whole genome sequencing of EOL-1 identified two mutations in the regulatory upstream regions of HMX2/3 resulting in generation of a consensus ETS-site and transformation of a former NFkB-site into an SP1-site. Reporter-gene assays demonstrated that both mutations contributed to HMX2/3 activation, modifying ETS1/ELK1- and TNFalpha-mediated gene regulation. Moreover, DMSO-induced eosinophilic differentiation of EOL-1 cells coincided with HMX2/3 downregulation while knockdown of HMX2 induced cell differentiation, collectively supporting a fundamental role for these genes in myeloid differentiation arrest. Finally, target genes of HMX2/3 were identified in EOL-1 and included suppression of differentiation gene EPX, and activation of fusion gene FIP1L1-PDGFRA and receptor-encoding gene HTR7, both of which enhanced oncogenic ERK-signalling. Taken together, our study documents a leukemic role for deregulated NKL homeobox genes HMX2 and HMX3 in AML, revealing molecular mechanisms of myeloid differentiation arrest."

We derive own- and cross-price elasticities by income quintiles and consumption deciles for five beverages, including two types of sugary drink: (i) milk, (ii) soft drinks, (iii) water, (iv) other sugary drinks, and (v) coffee and tea. Overall, results show that a 20% increase in the price of SSBs will decrease the consumption of soft drinks and other sugary drinks by 27% and 22%, respectively. Heterogeneous consumer behavior is revealed across income and consumption groups, as well as policy-relevant complementarity and substitution patterns. Policy impacts are simulated by considering an 18 cents per liter tax, implemented in Ecuador, and an ad-valorem 20% tax on the price. Estimated tax revenues and weight loss are larger for the latter. From a health perspective, high-income and heavy consumer households would benefit the most from this policy. Our study supports an evidence-based debate on how to correctly design and monitor food policy."
https://openalex.org/W3091842926,"Chronic pain affects significant portion of the world's population and physical exercise has been extensively indicated as non-pharmacological clinical intervention to relieve symptoms in chronic pain conditions. In general, studies on pain chronification and physical exercise intervention have focused on neuropathic pain, although chronic pain commonly results from an original inflammatory episode. Based on this, the objective of the present study was to investigate the therapeutic and preventive effect of the running wheel exercise on the persistent hyperalgesia induced by repetitive inflammatory stimulus, a rodent model that simulates clinical conditions of chronic pain that persist even with no more inflammatory stimulus present. To evaluate the therapeutic effect of physical exercise, we first induced persistent hyperalgesia through 14 days of PGE2 hind paw injections and, after that, mice have access to the regular voluntary running wheel. To evaluate the preventive effect of physical exercise, we first left the mice with access to the regular voluntary running wheel and, after that, we performed 14 days of PGE2 hind paw injection. Our results showed that voluntary running wheel exercise reduced persistent mechanical and chemical hyperalgesia intensity induced by repetitive inflammatory stimulus. In addition, we showed that this therapeutic effect is long-lasting and is observed even if started belatedly, i.e. two weeks after the development of hyperalgesia. Also, our results showed that voluntary running wheel exercise absolutely prevented persistent mechanical and chemical hyperalgesia induction. We can conclude that physical exercise has therapeutic and preventive effect on inflammatory stimulus-induced persistent hyperalgesia. Our data from animal experiments bypass placebo effects bias of the human studies and reinforce physical exercise clinical recommendations to treat and prevent chronic pain."

ProXp-ala prevents proteome-wide Pro-to-Ala mutations by hydrolyzing misacylated Ala-tRNAPro, which is synthesized by prolyl-tRNA synthetase. Bacterial ProXp-ala was previously shown to combine a size-based exclusion mechanism with conformational and chemical selection for the recognition of the alanyl moiety, whereas tRNAPro is selected via recognition of tRNA acceptor-stem elements G72 and A73. The identity of these critical bases changed during evolution with eukaryotic cytosolic tRNAPro possessing a cytosine at the corresponding positions. The mechanism by which eukaryotic ProXp-ala adapted to these changes remains unknown. In this work, recognition of the aminoacyl moiety and tRNA acceptor stem by human (Homo sapiens, or Hs) ProXp-ala was examined. Enzymatic assays revealed that Hs ProXp-ala requires C72 and C73 in the context of Hs cytosolic tRNAPro for efficient deacylation of mischarged Ala-tRNAPro. The strong dependence on these bases prevents cross-species deacylation of bacterial Ala-tRNAPro or of Hs mitochondrial Ala-tRNAPro by the human enzyme. Similar to the bacterial enzyme, Hs ProXp-ala showed strong tRNA acceptor-stem recognition but differed in its amino acid specificity profile relative to bacterial ProXp-ala. Changes at conserved residues in both the Hs and bacterial ProXp-ala substrate-binding pockets modulated this specificity. These results illustrate how the mechanism of substrate selection diverged during the evolution of the ProXp-ala family, providing the first example of a trans-editing domain whose specificity evolved to adapt to changes in its tRNA substrate.

Correct pairing of amino acids with their corresponding tRNAs by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) is fundamental for faithful translation of genetic information into proteins. These enzymes are divided into two classes based on structural differences within their aminoacylation active sites. The chemical and structural similarities of certain classes of amino acids challenge the ability of the synthetic active site, wherein aminoacyl-adenylate formation occurs, to properly select only cognate amino acids at this first step. Consequently, ARSs frequently ligate tRNAs with the wrong amino acid during the second step of aminoacylation (1Mohler K. Ibba M. Translational fidelity and mistranslation in the cellular response to stress.Nat. Microbiol. 2017; 2 (28836574): 1711710.1038/nmicrobiol.2017.117Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). If left uncorrected, misacylation may lead to the incorporation of amino acids in response to the wrong codon (i.e. mistranslation); accumulation of these errors has been linked to cell defects in diverse organisms (1Mohler K.

To prevent mistranslation, many ARSs have acquired quality control mechanisms that enable deacylation of tRNAs immediately after their synthesis in a reaction known as post-transfer editing. This reaction may occur in cis in a domain distinct from the aminoacylation active site, and seven members of both classes of ARSs possess such an editing domain (1Mohler K. Ibba M.

Structural studies revealed that the INS domain from Enterococcus faecium and ProXp-ala from Caulobacter crescentus (Cc) share a conserved tertiary structure and key catalytic residues (23Crepin T.

Biochemical studies revealed that Cc ProXp-Ala and E. coli (Ec) ProRS share similar size-exclusion and chemical-based mechanisms for recognition of the aminoacyl moiety, limiting their ability to hydrolyze tRNAPro charged with cognate Pro, as well as other amino acids that are larger than Ala (24Danhart E.M.

In contrast to their shared mechanism of amino acid recognition, INS and bacterial ProXp-ala developed distinct strategies for tRNAPro selection. The INS domain lacks intrinsic tRNA specificity and relies on the recognition of the tRNA anticodon by the anticodon binding domain of ProRS, whereas Cc ProXp-ala displays strong recognition of the acceptor-stem elements of bacterial tRNAPro (26Das M. Vargas-Rodriguez O. Goto Y. Suga H. Musier-Forsyth K. Distinct tRNA recognition strategies used by a homologous family of editing domains prevent mistranslation.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 (24371276): 3943-395310.1093/nar/gkt1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The tRNA specificity of both enzymes is crucial for preventing deacylation of cognate Ala-tRNAAla. Bacterial tRNAPro sequences show high conservation of the A73 discriminator base and the C1:G72 base pair, which is unique to the tRNAPro acceptor stem (27Lin B.Y. Chan P.P. Lowe T.M. tRNAviz: explore and visualize tRNA sequence features.Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 (31127306): W542-W54710.1093/nar/gkz438Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Cc ProXp-ala recognizes tRNAPro through specific interactions with G72 and A73 (26Das M. Vargas-Rodriguez O. Goto Y. Suga H. Musier-Forsyth K. Distinct tRNA recognition strategies used by a homologous family of editing domains prevent mistranslation.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 (24371276): 3943-395310.1093/nar/gkt1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These bases are also critical for aminoacylation of tRNAPro by bacterial ProRS (28Liu H. Peterson R. Kessler J. Musier-Forsyth K. Molecular recognition of tRNAPro by Escherichia coli proline-tRNA synthetase in vitro.Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23 (7870582): 165-16910.1093/nar/23.1.165Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar); thus, they play a dual role in ensuring the correct aminoacylation of tRNAPro with Pro and in editing of misacylated Ala-tRNAPro. The identity of these bases at the top of the tRNAPro acceptor stem changed during evolution; eukaryotic cytosolic (cyto) tRNAPro encodes C73 and G1:C72 (Fig. 1A) (27Lin B.Y. Chan P.P.

These differences in the acceptor stem prevent aminoacylation of human (Homo sapiens, or Hs) cyto tRNAPro by bacterial ProRS (29Burke B. Yang F. Chen F. Stehlin C. Chan B. Musier-Forsyth K. Evolutionary coadaptation of the motif 2–acceptor stem interaction in the class II prolyl-tRNA synthetase system.Biochemistry. 2000; 39 (11112540): 15540-1554710.1021/bi001835pCrossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) as well as deacylation of Hs cyto Ala-tRNAPro (hereafter referred to as Hs Ala-tRNAPro) by bacterial ProXp-ala (26Das M. Vargas-Rodriguez O. Goto Y. Suga H. Musier-Forsyth K. Distinct tRNA recognition strategies used by a homologous family of editing domains prevent mistranslation.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 (24371276): 3943-395310.1093/nar/gkt1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Even though bacterial tRNAPro is a poor substrate for Hs ProRS, the human enzyme only weakly relies on recognition of the tRNAPro acceptor-stem bases, while strongly relying on interactions with the anticodon, as well as other structural features of Hs tRNAPro (30Stehlin C. Burke B. Yang F. Liu H. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Species-specific differences in the operational RNA code for aminoacylation of tRNAPro.Biochemistry. 1998; 37 (9622512): 8605-861310.1021/bi980364sCrossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A previous study using a variant of tRNAPro that could readily be misacylated with Ala by alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS) concluded that Hs ProXp-ala has amino acid specificity but lacks tRNA specificity (31Ruan L.-L. Zhou X.-L. Tan M. Wang E.-D. Human cytoplasmic ProX edits mischarged tRNAPro with amino acid but not tRNA specificity.Biochem. J. 2013; 450 (23210460): 243-25210.1042/BJ20121493Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Here, we prepared native aminoacyl-tRNAPro substrates to investigate the amino acid and tRNA specificity of Hs ProXp-ala. Our findings suggest that the substrate-binding pocket of Hs ProXp-ala displays different amino acid selectivity relative to that of the bacterial enzyme, but the human enzyme maintains strong acceptor-stem recognition. We also identified residues in the substrate-binding pocket of both bacterial and Hs ProXp-ala that modulate their amino acid specificity. The results reported here provide insights into the evolutionary relationship between class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and editing domains. In this work, we used in vitro transcribed Hs cyto tRNAPro (Fig. 1A) and full-length recombinant Hs ProXp-ala expressed and purified in E. coli. To obtain sufficient yield of misacylated Hs Ala-tRNAPro substrates without the need for tRNA acceptor-stem mutation, we used flexizyme technology, which allows tRNAs to be charged with virtually any amino acid (proteinogenic or nonproteinogenic) (Fig. S1) (32Murakami H. Ohta A. Ashigai H. Suga H. A highly flexible tRNA acylation method for non-natural polypeptide synthesis.Nat. Methods. 2006; 3 (16628205): 357-35910.1038/nmeth877Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Our initial experiments showed that Hs ProXp-ala robustly deacylated Ala-tRNAPro in vitro. Based on an analysis of Hs Ala-tRNAPro deacylation by varying concentrations of Hs ProXp-ala under single-turnover conditions, we determined an apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of 10.2 μm and a maximum rate constant (kmax) of 3.8 min−1 (Fig. 2). Relative to the cyto tRNA, much weaker deacylation of Hs mitochondrial (mito) Ala-tRNAPro by Hs ProXp-ala was observed (Fig. 1B). Conversely, Cc ProXp-Ala deacylates mito Ala-tRNAPro with similar efficiency as bacterial Ala-tRNAPro (Fig. 1C). We hypothesize that differences in the acceptor-stem sequences of these two tRNAs (Fig. 1A) may account for these differences in deacylation activity. We previously showed that bacterial ProXp-ala cannot efficiently deacylate Hs cyto Ala-tRNAPro because of the differences in the identities of the bases at positions 72 and 73 in this eukaryotic tRNAPro (Fig. 1C) (26Das M. Vargas-Rodriguez O. Goto Y. Suga H. Musier-Forsyth K. Distinct tRNA recognition strategies used by a homologous family of editing domains prevent mistranslation.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 (24371276): 3943-395310.1093/nar/gkt1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To test whether Hs ProXp-ala exhibits cross-species deacylation capability, assays with Ec Ala-tRNAPro were performed under single-turnover conditions. We found that Hs ProXp-ala only weakly deacylated Ec Ala-tRNAPro with a 66-fold decrease in kobs (Fig. 3 and Table 1). This is consistent with the observation that Hs mito Ala-tRNAPro (which shares the C1:G72 and A73 acceptor-stem elements of Ec tRNAPro) is a poor substrate for Hs ProXp-ala (Fig. 1B). To identify the tRNA features that determine the specificity of Hs ProXp-ala, we prepared three Hs cyto tRNAPro acceptor-stem mutants (C73A, double mutant G1C/C72G, and triple mutant G1C/C72G/C73A) that mimic the acceptor stem of Ec tRNAPro (Fig. 1A). We found that the C73A and G1C/C72G tRNAPro mutants were hydrolyzed 13- and 16-fold slower than WT Ala-tRNAPro, respectively, whereas the triple mutant G1C/C72G/C73A tRNAPro was deacylated at an ∼100-fold reduced rate, similar to the decrease observed with Ec WT tRNAPro (Fig. 3 and Table 1). These data indicate that the first base pair and discriminator base of tRNAPro are important elements for Hs ProXp-ala recognition and deacylation activity. To further validate the role of these bases, we prepared a series of Ec tRNAPro acceptor-stem variants containing Hs tRNAPro elements (Fig. 1A). We found that Ec C73 and G1:C72 tRNAPro mutants were significantly better substrates for the human enzyme than Ec WT tRNAPro, whereas Ec G1:C72/A73 tRNAPro was deacylated slightly more efficiently than Hs WT tRNAPro (Fig. 3 and Table 1). Together, these results show that the deacylation activity of Hs ProXp-ala depends strongly on the identity of the nucleotides at the top of the acceptor stem of Hs cyto tRNAPro.Table 1Rate constants (kobs) for deacylation of Ala-tRNA variants by Hs ProXp-alatRNAAcceptor stemkobsFold changemin−1Hs tRNAPro WTG1:C72/C730.79 ± 0.12Hs tRNAPro A73G1:C72/A730.059 ± 0.00713Hs tRNAPro C1:G72C1:G72/C730.049 ± 0.00216Hs tRNAPro C1:G72/A73C1:G72/A730.007 ± 0.001113Hs mito tRNAProC1:G72/A730.019 ± 0.00542Ec tRNAPro WTC1:G72/A730.012 ± 0.00166Ec tRNAPro C73C1:G72/C730.071 ± 0.01911Ec tRNAPro G1:C72G1:C72/A730.13 ± 0.0096Ec tRNAPro G1:C72/C73G1:C72/C731.2 ± 0.160.66Ec tRNASerG1:C72/G730.018 ± 0.00144Ec tRNAAlaG1:C72/A730.055 ± 0.00214Ec tRNACysG1:C72/U730.098 ± 0.0098 Open table in a new tab To further study the effect of different substitutions at the 73 position, we charged or mischarged three Ec tRNAs with Ala: tRNAAla, tRNASer, and tRNACys, which contain A73, G73, and U73, respectively (all have G1:C72). We found that the efficiency of Ala-tRNAAla deacylation is very similar to other G1:C73 tRNAPro variants with A73 (Table 1). Ala-tRNACys (U73) was a slightly better substrate, and Ala-tRNASer (G73) displayed the lowest kobs value of the three. These results emphasize a key role of the discriminator base for tRNA deacylation by Hs ProXp-ala. We next investigated the aminoacyl specificity of Hs ProXp-ala using Hs tRNAPro charged with amino acids of different classes including 2-aminobutyric acid (Abu), Ser, Thr, Pro, and azetidine-2-carboxylic acid (Aze) (Fig. 4). The deacylation rate of tRNAPro charged with the larger nonpolar Abu amino acid is 20-fold slower than Ala-tRNAPro (Table 2). Likewise, for tRNAPro charged with polar amino acids, the larger Thr-tRNAPro is a poorer substrate than Ser-tRNAPro. Thus, for these amino acids, the deacylation efficiency correlates with size of the aminoacyl moiety, with a preference for the smaller substrate. In contrast, Aze, a four-membered ring analog of Pro, with a molecular volume slightly larger than Ser, was deacylated 6-fold more efficiently than Ser and only 3.4-fold less efficiently than Ala. Aze-tRNAPro deacylation is also slightly greater (∼2-fold) than the rate of Pro-tRNAPro deacylation by the human enzyme, which surprisingly is only ∼5-fold lower than that of Ala-tRNAPro (Table 2).Table 2Rate constants (kobs) for deacylation of Hs aa-tRNAPro by Hs ProXp-alaAminoacyl-tRNAProAmino acid volumekobsFold changeÅ3min−1Ala-tRNAPro1010.79 ± 0.12Abu-tRNAPro1220.039 ± 0.00720Ser-tRNAPro1100.039 ± 0.00320Thr-tRNAPro1290.015 ± 0.00253Aze-tRNAPro1170.23 ± 0.0263.4Pro-tRNAPro1320.16 ± 0.0125.0 Open table in a new tab The aminoacyl specificity of the Ec INS editing domain is modulated by conserved residues in the substrate-binding pocket that include Leu266 and His369 (18Wong F.C.

Whether the corresponding residues play a role in determining the overall specificity of Hs ProXp-ala is unknown. Leu266 and His369 of Ec INS align with Met35 and His137 of Hs ProXp-ala, respectively (Fig. 5). We previously showed that Leu266 plays a role in the specificity of the INS toward Ser-tRNA; when this residue in Ec INS is mutated to Ala, Ala-tRNAPro is deacylated less efficiently, whereas the mutant enzyme hydrolyzes Ser-tRNAPro more robustly than WT INS (25Kumar S.

We now show that replacing Met35 of Hs ProXp-ala with smaller Gly increases the rate of Ser-tRNAPro deacylation by 2.3-fold while decreasing the rate of Ala-tRNAPro deacylation by 4.7-fold (Fig. 6 and Table 3). The highly conserved His residue in the substrate-binding pocket of Ec INS has previously been shown to function to prevent cognate substrate deacylation; mutation of this residue to Ala significantly increased Pro-tRNAPro deacylation (18Wong F.C.

We now show that a homologous mutation (H137A) in Hs ProXp-ala also improves its activity toward Pro-tRNAPro, which is now deacylated only 2-fold weaker than Ala-tRNAPro by the same mutant (Fig. 7A and Table 3). Similarly, a Cc H130A ProXp-ala variant showed strong deacylation of Pro-tRNAPro (Fig. 7B).

Pyrosequencing results suggested that the bacterial communities of meju, but not solar salt, significantly affected those of doenjang communities. Culture-based pyrosequencing analysis yielded similar results. These results indicate that most predominant bacterial species in doenjang migrated from meju, not solar salt. We therefore believe that the present study is one of the most comprehensive comparisons of bacterial communities of fermented soybeans using culture-dependent and -independent methods.

https://openalex.org/W3092480936,"Atherosclerosis, a chronic inflammatory disorder of the arterial wall, is a complex process whose dynamics are affected by multiple factors. The disease control consists of restraining it by administering statins. Slowing down or halting the plaque growth depends on the patient age at which the statin treatment begins and on the thickness of the intima-media (IMT) at that time. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model to estimate the sets of atherosclerosis states, from which the use of statins can restrain the disease. Our model is control-theoretic, and the estimated sets are the viability kernels, in the parlance of viability theory. To our best knowledge, this way of modelling the atherosclerosis progression is original. We compute two viability kernels, each for a different statin-treatment dose. Each kernel is composed of the vector [age, IMT] from which the disease can be restrained. By extension, the disease can’t be restrained from the kernel complements, this being mainly because of the disease and patient-age advancement. The kernels visualise tradeoffs between early and late treatments, which helps the clinician to decide when to start the statin treatment and which statin dose may be sufficient."
https://openalex.org/W3091901805,"Pancreatic cancer accounts for 2.8% of new cancer cases worldwide and is projected to become the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths by 2030. Patients of African ancestry appear to be at an increased risk for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), with more severe disease and outcomes. The purpose of this study was to map the proteomic and genomic landscape of a cohort of PDAC patients of African ancestry. Thirty tissues (15 tumours and 15 normal adjacent tissues) were obtained from consenting South African PDAC patients. Optimisation of the sample preparation method allowed for the simultaneous extraction of high-purity protein and DNA for SWATH-MS and OncoArray SNV analyses. We quantified 3402 proteins with 49 upregulated and 35 downregulated proteins at a minimum 2.1 fold change and FDR adjusted p-value (q-value) ≤ 0.01 when comparing tumour to normal adjacent tissue. Many of the upregulated proteins in the tumour samples are involved in extracellular matrix formation (ECM) and related intracellular pathways. In addition, proteins such as EMIL1, KBTB2, and ZCCHV involved in the regulation of ECM proteins were observed to be dysregulated in pancreatic tumours. Downregulation of pathways involved in oxygen and carbon dioxide transport were observed. Genotype data showed missense mutations in some upregulated proteins, such as MYPN, ESTY2 and SERPINB8. Approximately 11% of the dysregulated proteins, including ISLR, BP1, PTK7 and OLFL3, were predicted to be secretory proteins. These findings help in further elucidating the biology of PDAC and may aid in identifying future plausible markers for the disease."
https://openalex.org/W3091913795,"Social sanctions can be effective for sustaining beneficial norms by harnessing the power of social pressure and peer monitoring. Yet, field evidence regarding how norms might be linked to perceived risk of sanction is limited. In this study, we focused on communities located in peri-urban areas of Tamil Nadu, India, and examined how people’s perceived prevalence of a socially desirable behavior (i.e., toilet use) relates to the perceived risk of sanctions for deviating from this behavior (i.e., open defecation) in the sanitation domain. Cross-sectional data from 2427 participants in 75 communities revealed that the majority (77%, n = 1861) perceived the risk of informal sanctions related to open defecation. Among those, verbal reprimand was the most common (60%), followed by advice (30%) and gossip (7%). Results from multilevel logistic regression indicated that those who believed toilet use was prevalent in their community were more likely to perceive the risk of social sanctions for open defecation. Moderation analysis revealed that this relationship was robust among women, but attenuated among men. Our findings suggest that women are more likely to expect social sanctions if they deviate from what is perceived as the prevalent sanitation behavior (e.g., toilet use) in their community. Open defecation practices are known to cause psychosocial stress among women due to their experiences with sanitation insecurity, which may include fear of disapproval from community members. Our results highlight the need for gendered intervention strategies when sanitation programs leverage social influence for behavior change."

The present study is designed to investigate the prevalence, outcome and risk factors of postoperative AKI associated with open aorta and vena cava surgeries, with a focus on the role of anemia in these conditions. A retrospective review of medical records of Peking Union Medical College Hospital was conducted. Patients who underwent open aorta and vena cava surgeries during January 1, 2010 and June 30, 2014 were included in this study. The primary analysis was between patients underwent open aorta and vena cava surgeryies, with or without postoperative AKI. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine risk factors of postoperative AKI. The study included 79 patients (63.3% male) with a mean age of 52.5±17.3 years (range, 17-81 years). Postoperative AKI occurred in 23/79 (29.1%) of the patients. Anemia was present in 11/79 (16%) at baseline, and increased to 45/79 (52%) postoperatively. After adjustment for various risk factors, postoperative anemia (OR, 5.202; 95% CI 1.403-19.285) was independently associated with postoperative AKI. AKI is a common complication in patients who undergo open aorta and vena cava surgeries, and postoperative anemia was the most relevant predictive factor of AKI. Strategies to minimize bleeding and anemia for all patients may be advisable. Further studies are needed to assess the impact of AKI on long term outcome and to examine preventive strategies to address potentially modifiable risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W3092350052,"Globally, economies and marine ecosystems are increasingly dependent on sustainable fisheries management (SFM) to balance social, economic, and conservation needs. The overarching objectives of SFM are to maximize both conservation and socio-economic benefits, while minimizing short-term socio-economic costs. A number of tools have been developed to achieve SFM objectives, ranging from fishery specific to ecosystem-based strategies. Closures are a common SFM tool used to balance the trade-off between socio-economic and conservation considerations; they vary in scope from small-scale temporary closures to large-scale permanent networks. Unfortunately, closures are frequently implemented without a plan for monitoring or assessing whether SFM objectives are met. In situations in which a monitoring plan is not in place we propose that commonly available fishery data can often be used to evaluate whether management tools are effective in meeting SFM objectives. Here, we present a case study of closures on Georges Bank that shows how fishery data can be analyzed to perform such an assessment. Since 2006, on the Canadian side of Georges Bank, seasonal scallop fishery closures have been implemented with the aim of reducing by-catch of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and yellowtail flounder (Pleuronectes ferruginea) during spawning. In lieu of data from a dedicated monitoring program, we analyzed data from Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS), fishery logbooks, and a scallop survey to assess the impact of these closures on the scallop fishery, and use observer data (i.e. by-catch) to assess the effectiveness of these closures in meeting their conservation objective. While compliance for these time-area closures was high, the closures did not significantly displace fishing activity and overall there was limited evidence of an impact on the scallop fishery. Further, the discard rates for both cod and yellowtail were above average when their respective closures were active. These results suggest that improvements to the closures design and/or other measures may be required to achieve the desired SFM objectives."

Methods An explorative qualitative study using semi-structured interviews on information needs was conducted among 17 inguinal hernia patients to gain more insight in the patients’ present surgical information needs. Patients either were planned to receive or already had received a surgical procedure. Questions were asked about the current information provision and, after being shown a 360˚ video of the surgery, whether this would be of added value. Results Of the total group of 17 patients (mean age 56, interquartile range 45–64) 16 were male and one was female. Most had no previous experience with virtual reality (14/17), already had undergone a surgical procedure (11/17). Patient information needs were all about “seeing” which can be viewed from three different perspectives [1] being seen as a unique person in the treatment process, [2] being seen as a partner, and [3] seeing is understanding. Patients wanted the contact with the doctor to be more personal, with the possibility to see the anesthetist in person, the surgeon to see their wound in the recovery phase, and to receive personal answers to questions about their specific situation. Patients found the 360-video not fearsome, and believed that visual content could be beneficial as it appeals more to their imagination than written or oral information and increases their understanding. It also provided them with a better understanding of their treatment options, their pre-, peri-, and post-surgical procedures and identification of the cause of post-operative side effects. Conclusion To address patients’ information needs, complementary tools or services are needed that increase personal contact as well as tailor it to individual patient’s needs. Even though video-apps are a partial alternative, hospitals should still offer patients the possibility of having face-to-face meetings with physicians as this is highly valued by patients and leads to increased trust in physicians’ performance."
https://openalex.org/W3092258976,"Neural stem cells (NSCs), capable of self-renew and differentiate into neural cells, hold promise for use in studies and treatments for neurological diseases. However, current approaches to obtain NSCs from a live brain are risky and invasive, since NSCs reside in the subventricular zone and the in the hippocampus dentate gyrus. Alternatively, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) could be a more available cell source due to their abundance in tissues and easier to access. However, MSCs are committed to producing mesenchymal tissue and are not capable of spontaneously differentiating into neural cells. Thus, the process of reprogramming of MSCs into neural cells to use in clinical and scientific settings has significantly impacted the advancement of regenerative medicine. Previously, our laboratory reported trans-differentiation of MSCs to neural cells through the induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells state, which was produced by overexpression of the embryonic stem cell gene NANOG. In the current study, we demonstrate that treatment with exosomes derived from NSCs makes MSCs capable of expressing neural cell markers bypassing the generation of iPS cells. An epigenetic modifier, decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine), enhanced the process. This novel Xeno and transgene-free trans-differentiation technology eliminates the issues associated with iPS cells, such as tumorigenesis. Thus, it may accelerate the development of neurodegenerative therapies and in vitro neurological disorder models for personalized medicine."
https://openalex.org/W3092488577,"Introduction 
Poor mental and sleep health negatively affects work performance, turnover intention, and information retention. We examined the impact of waiting job in upscale restaurants on the sleep health of waiters.


Materials and methods 
This was a descriptive study which collected cross-sectional data from waiters of upscale restaurants, using PSQI and DASS-21 questionnaires. Descriptive and inferential statistics comprising mean, frequency, percentage, chi-square, and logistic regression were adopted in presenting the results.


Results 
Sleep quality was poor among 74% of the waiters. The predictors of sleep quality were sex (p = 0.002), role at restaurant (p = 0.004), non-prescription drug use (p<0.001), depression (p<0.001), anxiety (p<0.001), and stress (p<0.001). The prevalence of anxiety, depression, and stress among the waiters was 52.3%, 38.3%, and 34.4% respectively. Stationed (AOR = 4.72, 95%CI = 1.7–812.53, p = 0.002) and supervising (AOR = 3.08, 95%CI = 1.25–7.57, p = 0.014) waiters were more likely to have good sleep quality than headwaiters. Waiters who had depression, anxiety, and stress were, however, 8% (AOR = 0.92, 95%CI = 0.46–1.85, p = 0.819), 28% (AOR = 0.72, 95%CI = 0.38–1.36, p = 0.315), and 49% (AOR = 0.51, 95%CI = 0.24–1.07, p = 0.073) less likely to have a good sleep quality than those who respectively did not have depression, anxiety, and stress.


Conclusions 
Sleep quality was poor among most of the waiters. If this persists, Ghana may not be able to meet the Sustainable Development Goal 3.4 target of promoting mental health and wellbeing. To improve sleep quality and accelerate progress towards achievement of the SDG target, there should be increased collaboration among stakeholders in the health and hospitality industries to develop innovative interventions to reduce poor sleep quality among workers."
https://openalex.org/W3091942873,"Northwest Argentina (NWA) is a poor economic-geographical region, with the highest rate of diarrhea diseases. At the moment, there are no reports showing the epidemiological status of this region that would allow to establish methods for prevention and control of these infections and to indicate of the prevalent pathogen that produces them. Therefore we carried out an epidemiological study of the gastroenteritis etiological agents and their incidence in the pediatric population. A total of 17 823 fecal samples were collected, 14 242 from HNJ-Tuc, 2,257 from CePSI-Stgo and 1,324 from HINEP-Cat. In 2,595 samples a bacterial agent was identified, the 93.64% corresponded to Shigella/Salmonella clinical isolates. Shigella genus was the prevalent pathogen, being Shigella flexneri 2 the most frequent serotype. Most of the Shigella clinical isolates presented themselves as multidrug-resistant (MDR), harboring 2 to 3 genetic resistance determinants. 50% of the affected patients were children under 4 years old. Here, we demonstrate that bacterial gastrointestinal diseases strongly affect the health of NWA population. The appearance of epidemic outbreaks, as happened during 2014, suggest that they may be related to the socio-economic poverty of NWA. Recently, Shigella flexneri 2 has become the highest NWA´s incidence infectious agent. The acquisition of new antibiotic resistance determinants may play an important role in their adaptation and persistence."
https://openalex.org/W3091999852,"Introduction School-aged children become a highly vulnerable group for malaria, yet they are less likely to use malaria prevention interventions. Previous studies exploring perception on cause of malaria mainly focused on pregnant mothers or parents of children under age five years. Exploring parent’s perception on cause of malaria and their experiences on the prevention of malaria and associated challenges among school-aged children is important to develop a malaria prevention education package for school-aged children to reduce malaria and malaria related morbidities among school-aged children. Methods A descriptive qualitative study is conducted in Kutcha district by recruiting 19 parents of school-aged children for semi-structured interviews, 6 key informants and 6 focus group discussion which consists of parents, health development army and health extension workers. A semi-structured interview guide is used to guide the interview process. The collected data is analyzed thematically with a focus on the three major areas of concern: perceived cause of malaria, experience of malaria prevention and challenges of bed net use for prevention of malaria. Results Five causes of malaria were identified, namely hunger, mosquito bite, exposure to hot sunshine, poor sanitation and hygiene and eating some sweet foods and unripe maize. Participants perceived that eating sweet foods and unripe maize lead to enlargement of the spleen that ends in malaria while poor hygiene and sanitation leads to either development of the ova of mosquito and the landing of the housefly to contaminate food for consumption. The experiences of malaria prevention were largely influenced by their perceived cause of malaria. The malaria prevention measures undertaken by parents were vectors control measures, homemade herbal remedies and restricting children from eating sweet foods. The challenges of malaria prevention by using bed nets were related to a negative attitude, sleeping behaviors of children; use of bed nets for unintended purposes, shortage of bed nets and delays in the distribution of bed nets. Conclusion There were misconceptions about the cause of malaria and associated experiences of malaria prevention. Control of malaria among school-aged children need health education targeting the challenges and correcting identified misconceptions by parents in Kutcha district and in other similar settings."
https://openalex.org/W3092086391,"Crop productivity in Albic soil is poor, owing to poor soil physicochemical properties. Mixing of Aw layers, representing Albic soil, with B layers, could improve the physicochemical properties of Albic soil, which is characterized by poor humus on the topsoil and high penetration resistance. The objective of the present study conducted in 2015–2016 in an Albic soil region in Heilongjiang province, China, was to explore the effects of different soil mixing strategies on the physicochemical properties of Albic soil and crop yield. There were four soil mixing treatments: conventional subsoiler (CS), three-stage subsoil mixing plough (TSMP), four-stage subsoil mixing plough (FSMP), and three-stage subsoil interval mixing plough (TSIMP). Our results demonstrated that the Aw layer bulk density of Albic soil under TSMP, FSMP, and TSIMP decreased significantly compared to that under CS. In addition, the total porosity of the soil under these treatments increased significantly in 2 years. Compared to the water holding capacity under the CS treatment, other treatments increased significantly in the Aw layer. Furthermore, soil penetration resistance of the Aw layer decreased following Aw and B layer mixing. All three soil mixing treatments also increased soil aggregate stability and cation exchange capacity but reduced soil organic carbon content in the Aw layer. Soil mixing increased soybean and maize seed yield. Overall, Aw and B layer mixing improved Albic soil structure and physiochemical properties and increased crop yield; thus, this mixing is a feasible approach for Albic soil improvement, with optimal improvements observed under the FMSP strategy, which also added organic substances to the Aw layer."
https://openalex.org/W3092092904,"The presence of a high number of macrophages within solid tumors is often significantly associated with poor prognosis and predict treatment failure for chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Macrophages are innate immune cells capable of performing diverse functions depending on the different signals from the microenvironment. The classically activated macrophage is commonly present during the early stages of tumor development while alternatively activated macrophages are associated with more advanced tumors. The distinction of the antitumoral macrophages from the pro-tumoral macrophages is not absolute. However, they have different cell surface markers such as mannose receptor (MRC1 or CD206) abundantly expressed by macrophages treated with interleukin-4 (IL-4). The important roles of macrophages in cancers suggest that it is important to develop novel therapies that target these cells. In the present study, we designed a probe using Polyamidoamine (PAMAM) fifth-generation (G5) dendrimers conjugated with mannose, Cyanine 7 (Cy7), and hydrazinonicotinamide (HYNIC) for target macrophages with high expression of MRC1 in the tumor. The intracellular uptake of 99mTc-HYNIC-dendrimer-mannose-Cy7 through the interaction with MRC1 in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) untreated or treated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) + interferon (IFN)γ or IL-4 was analyzed. Our results show that high-density mannose dendrimers are preferentially bound by macrophages treated by IFNγ and LPS that express lower levels of MRC1 than for macrophages treated by IL-4 that express high levels of MRC1. Furthermore, the intracellular 99mTc-HYNIC-dendrimer-mannose-Cy7 uptake in BMDMs was not inhibited in the presence of free mannose or glucose. This result suggests that 99mTc-HYNIC-dendrimer-mannose-Cy7 is not internalized via macrophage MRC1. Based on these findings, we concluded that MRC1 expression does not determine the uptake of high-density mannose dendrimers."
https://openalex.org/W3092592496,"This study investigates the interactions between defense production and the rest of the economy. We develop a two-sector dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with military and nonmilitary production. Inputs (capital and labor) are distributed between the two sectors. Calibration of the model to key targets of the US economy results in an elasticity of substitution between consumption of goods and services and national defense services of 0.56. The estimated complementarity between consumption goods and defense services results in positive spillovers across military and final goods production sectors, even when the nonmilitary production function is not directly related to military spending. We find that military spending is procyclical and that military spending as a percentage of output is countercyclical. Finally, investment-specific technological shocks to military equipment have a positive impact on nonmilitary output, although they reduce business investment."
https://openalex.org/W3091880717,"Background and aims Cost-effective serology tests may increase the predictive accuracy of colonoscopy for colorectal cancer screening. Reportedly, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) is associated with oxidative stress and carcinogenesis and has been found to be elevated in the serum of cancer patients and colorectal adenoma tissue. We aimed to investigate the association between serum GGT levels and colorectal adenoma. Methods This single-center, health examination-based cohort enrolled 2475 subjects from 2006 to 2015. Baseline characteristics, laboratory data, bidirectional gastrointestinal endoscopy, and transabdominal ultrasonography were used to evaluate the severity of fatty liver. Results We found an elevated median GGT level in subjects with tubular adenoma compared with those without (23 IU/L and 20 IU/L, p<0.001). A GGT cutoff of ≥20 IU/L reached a maximal Youden index in receiver operating curve (ROC) analyses. Subsequent regression analyses showed an odds ratio of 1.46 (95% CI 1.17–1.82, p<0.001) for age, body mass index, diabetes diagnosis, total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and positive Helicobacter pylori urease test, all being associated with an increased incidence of colon adenoma. Subgroup analysis showed that the odds ratio (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.15–1.68, p<0.001) is only significant and highest in patients with a negative or mild fatty liver and an ALT level of ≤40 IU/L. Conclusions The results suggested a positive correlation of GGT with colon adenoma incidence and a predictive value with a cutoff point of >20 IU/L, which is within the normal range. The effect may be most prominent for those without steatohepatitis."

As the predominant Aβ isoform in vascular deposits, Aβ40 is a valuable target in cerebral amyloid angiopathy research. However, the slow process of Aβ40 aggregation in vitro is a bottleneck in the search for Aβ-targeting molecules. In this study, we sought a method to accelerate the aggregation of Aβ40 in vitro, to improve experimental screening procedures. We evaluated the aggregating ability of bicine, a biological buffer, using various in vitro methods. Our data suggest that bicine promotes the aggregation of Aβ40 with high speed and reproducibility, yielding a mixture of aggregates with significant β-sheet-rich fibril formation and toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W3092317465,"A fetal growth chart is a vital tool for assessing fetal risk during pregnancy. Since fetal weight cannot be directly measured, its reliable estimation at different stages of pregnancy has become an essential issue in obstetrics and gynecology and one of the critical elements in developing a fetal growth chart for estimated fetal weight. In Indonesia, however, a reliable model and data for fetal weight estimation remain challenging, and this causes the absence of a standard fetal growth chart in antenatal care practices. This study has reviewed and evaluated the efficacy of the prediction models used to develop the most prominent growth charts for estimated fetal weight. The study also has discussed the potential challenges when such surveillance tools are utilized in low resource settings. The study, then, has proposed an alternative model based only on maternal fundal height to estimate fetal weight. Finally, the study has developed an alternative growth chart and assessed its capability in detecting abnormal patterns of fetal growth during pregnancy. Prospective data from twenty selected primary health centers in South Kalimantan, Indonesia, were used for the proposed model validation, the comparison task, and the alternative growth chart development using both descriptive and inferential statistics. Results show that limited access to individual fetal biometric characteristics and low-quality data on personal maternal and neonatal characteristics make the existing fetal growth charts less applicable in the local setting. The proposed model based only on maternal fundal height has a comparable ability in predicting fetal weight with less error than the existing models. The results have shown that the developed chart based on the proposed model can effectively detect signs of abnormality, between 20 and 41 weeks, among low birth weight babies in the absence of ultrasound. Consequently, the developed chart would improve the quality of fetal risk assessment during pregnancy and reduce the risk of adverse neonatal outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3091885487,"Physical inactivity and a sedentary lifestyle are associated with a chronic low-level inflammatory state which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. There is growing interest in exercise programs as part of surgical ‘prehabilitation’. We therefore studied preoperative physical activity levels of patients undergoing elective Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) surgery, and performed an exploratory analysis of the influence of physical activity on postoperative outcome. The Short Questionnaire to Assess Health (SQUASH) was used to assess physical activity among 100 patients, of mean (SD) age 65.4 (7.6) years. Additionally, handgrip strength was measured, and the get-up-and-go test was conducted. Anxiety, depression, and quality of life were assessed, and a computerised cognitive test battery was used to assess cognitive performance preoperatively, and three months after surgery. Preoperatively, 76% of patients met the recommended national guidelines for physical activity. The incidence of pre-existing medical conditions, and other pre-operative patient features were similar in active and inactive patients. Preoperative physical activity was significantly inversely related to the logistic EuroSCORE. The level of physical activity was also significantly inversely related with preoperative C-reactive protein (CRP) and peak postoperative CRP, but physical activity did not appear to be associated with any adverse postoperative outcomes or extended length of hospital stay. The incidence of postoperative neurocognitive disorder (PNCD) at 3 months postoperatively was 26%. Cognitive performance was not related with physical activity levels. In summary, this was the first study to assess activity levels of cardiac surgical patients with the SQUASH questionnaire. The majority of patients were physically active. Although physical activity was associated with lower levels of inflammation in this pilot study, it was not associated with an improved clinical or cognitive postoperative outcome."
https://openalex.org/W3092068271,"Extracellular trafficking of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF) is tightly regulated, disruption of which triggers various autoinflammatory disorders, including TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS). Here, we provide thus far unraveled molecular basis of noncysteine mutations in TNFR1 ectodomain where loss of an aromatic moiety in cysteine-rich domain (CRD) 2 results in TRAPS disease-associated phenotype. Our study characterized that a missense mutation on phenylalanine residue located in CRD2 (TNFR1F60V ) causes a delay in TNFR1 transport to cell membrane, leading to sustained receptor responsiveness and downstream NF-κB activation, characteristic of clinical manifestation of a prolonged fever. By creating and characterizing identical mutations on structurally conserved ectodomains of osteoprotegerin (OPG) and decoy receptor 3, other two secreted forms of TNFRSF, we further identified that a conserved aromatic residue at the A1 submodule of CRD2 (A1CRD2) confers structural integrity of ectodomain where aromatic sidechain deletion increases thermal instability, interfering with efficient posttranslational modification and subsequent receptor secretion. Interestingly, our functional analyses indicated that this particular noncysteine mutation is not associated with either protein misfolding or loss of function. Finally, by using a synthetic agonist, we demonstrated gain-of-function of the trafficking defect, suggesting the possibility of rescuing affected pathology in related disorders. Given the structural and topological similarities present in the ectodomains of TNFRSF members, our findings provide mechanistic insights of defects in subcellular trafficking of TNF receptors, reported in various TNFRSF-associated diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3092575435,"Presynaptic mitochondrial Ca2+ plays a critical role in the regulation of synaptic transmission and plasticity. The presynaptic bouton of the hippocampal mossy fiber (MF) is much larger in size than that of the Schaffer collateral (SC) synapse. Here we compare the structural and physiological characteristics of MF and SC presynaptic boutons to reveal functional and mechanistic differences between these two synapses. Our quantitative ultrastructural analysis using electron microscopy show many more mitochondria in MF presynaptic bouton cross-section profiles compared to SC boutons. Consistent with these results, post-tetanic potentiation (PTP), a form of presynaptic short-term plasticity dependent on mitochondrial Ca2+, is reduced by inhibition of mitochondrial Ca2+ release at MF synapses but not at SC synapses. However, blockade of mitochondrial Ca2+ release results in reduction of PTP at SC synapses by disynaptic MF stimulation. Furthermore, inhibition of mitochondrial Ca2+ release selectively decreases frequency facilitation evoked by short trains of presynaptic stimulation at MF synapses, while having no effect at SC synapses. Moreover, depletion of ER Ca2+ stores leads to reduction of PTP at MF synapses, but PTP is unaffected by ER Ca2+ depletion at SC synapses. These findings show that MF and SC synapses differ in presynaptic mitochondrial content as well as mitochondrial Ca2+ dependent synaptic plasticity, highlighting differential regulatory mechanisms of presynaptic plasticity at MF and SC synapses."
