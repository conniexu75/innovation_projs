https://openalex.org/W2018119138,"We describe the first complete inventory of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins from a multicellular organism, the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. By the application of several search criteria,Arabidopsis was found to contain a total of 129 open reading frames (ORFs) capable of encoding ABC proteins, of which 103 possessed contiguous transmembrane spans and were identified as putative intrinsic membrane proteins. Fifty-two of the putative intrinsic membrane proteins contained at least two transmembrane domains (TMDs) and two nucleotide-binding folds (NBFs) and could be classified as belonging to one of five subfamilies of full-molecule transporters. The other 51 putative membrane proteins, all of which were half-molecule transporters, fell into five subfamilies. Of the remaining ORFs identified, all of which encoded proteins lacking TMDs, 11 could be classified into three subfamilies. There were no obvious homologs in other organisms for 15 of the ORFs which encoded a heterogeneous group of non-intrinsic ABC proteins (NAPs). Unrooted phylogenetic analyses substantiated the subfamily designations. Notable features of the ArabidopsisABC superfamily was the presence of a large yeast-like PDR subfamily, and the absence of genes encoding bona fidecystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), sulfonylurea receptor (SUR), and heavy metal tolerance factor 1 (HMT1) homologs. Arabidopsiswas unusual in its large allocation of ORFs (a minimum of 0.5%) to members of the ABC protein superfamily.

Greene E.A. Pietrokovski S. Bork P. Attwood T.K. Hood L. Science. 1997; 278: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), and most, but not all, are membrane proteins (“ABC transporters”) active in the transport of a broad range of substances across membranes. ABC proteins are designated as such on the basis of their possession of one or two ATP-binding cassettes or nucleotide binding folds (NBFs), sharing 30–40% identity between family members (2Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3323) Google Scholar). Each NBF encompasses ∼200 amino acid residues and contains three idiotypic sequence motifs. These are a Walker A box (GX 4GK(ST)) and a Walker B box ((RK)X 3GX 3L (hydrophobic)3), separated by ∼120 amino acid residues (3Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4212) Google Scholar), and an ABC signature (alias C) motif ((LIVMFY)S(SG)GX 3(RKA)(LIVMYA)X(LIVFM)(AG)) situated between the two Walker boxes (4Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2013-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). In addition to one or two NBFs, ABC transporters, or at least ABC proteins for which a membrane association can be inferred from sequence data alone, contain two or three hydrophobic integral membrane domains (TMDs) each of which contains multiple (usually four to six) transmembrane α-helices. The TMDs are considered to form the pathway for solute movement across the phospholipid bilayer (or from one bilayer leaflet to the other). In those proteins investigated in sufficient detail, the TMDs appear to determine or at least contribute to the substrate selectivity of the transporter. However, the TMDs of even closely related ABC transporters, unlike the NBFs, exhibit little or no discernible sequence similarity other than a preponderance of hydrophobic residues with a distribution consistent with structures of approximately equivalent topology. A feature of ABC transporters, evident from a survey of the superfamily, is their modular construction. The four core domains or modules (two NBFs and two core TMDs) may be expressed as separate polypeptides or as multidomain proteins (2Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3323) Google Scholar). In some ABC transporters, for instance many of those from bacterial sources that have been characterized, the four domains reside on different polypeptides (“quarter molecules”) (2Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3323) Google Scholar). In other ABC transporters, the domains are fused in various combinations. In the ribose permease system ofEscherichia coli, the two NBFs are fused; in the mammalian TAP1-TAP2 peptide transporter, the Schizosaccharomyces pombeheavy metal tolerance factor 1 (HMT1) gene product, and theDrosophila melanogaster pigment transporters (White, Brown, and Scarlet), one TMD is fused with an NBF to form a “half-molecule.” In the majority of characterized eukaryotic ABC transporters, the core domains are contiguous on a single multidomain polypeptide (“full molecule”) in a “forward” TMD1-NBF1-TMD2-NBF2 or “reverse” NBF1-TMD1-NBF2-TMD2 orientation (Table I).Table IPutative domain organizations characteristic of representative members of different ABC protein subfamilies found in ArabidopsisAlso shown are definitions of the three-letter acronyms used in this inventory and the properties of representatives of the same subclasses of ABC proteins from yeast, human or animal cells.

The hierarchical organization and range of functions that these proteins are capable of fulfilling in a single organism is clearly exemplified by Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the one genomically characterized eukaryote whose ABC protein complement has been fully inventoried. Numbering 29, the ABC proteins of yeast have been classified into a total of 6 subfamilies or clusters with distinguishable topologies (5Decottignies A. Goffeau A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Of these, 22 are full or half-molecule intrinsic membrane proteins, and 7 are proteins containing NBFs but lacking contiguous TMDs. Cluster I contains 10 proteins belonging to the pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR) subfamily. All members of this cluster, except ADP1 which is a half-molecule, are reverse orientation, full molecule transporters. Cluster II, which can be further demarcated into 3 subclusters, includes 6 forward orientation, full molecule multidrug resistance associated protein (MRP) homologs (subcluster 1), one forward orientation, full molecule MDR protein homolog (subcluster 2), and 3 forward orientation, half-molecule MDR homologs (subcluster 3). Cluster III contains 2 forward orientation, half-molecule transporters bearing a resemblance to the human peroxisomal proteins, adrenoleukodystrophy protein, adrenoleukodystrophy-related protein, and peroxisomal membrane protein 70 (PMP70). The remaining clusters IV, V, and VI contain proteins lacking contiguous TMDs. Cluster IV contains 5 proteins possessing two NBFs, and clusters V and VI contain one single NBF protein each, a protein sharing high sequence similarity to human RNase L inhibitor (RLI) and a protein resembling the peripheral ATP-binding subunits of bacterial ABC transporters, respectively. A similar pattern is emerging from the Human Genome Project, except that certain subfamilies, for instance those to which ABC1, ABC2, the sulfonylurea receptor (SUR), and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) belong, do not have equivalents in the yeast genome. At the time of writing, some 51 ORFs encoding ABC proteins have been identified in the human genome (www.humanabc.com). As a prelude to and resource for future functional genomic investigations of this important group of proteins, we present the first complete inventory and phylogenetic analysis of ABC proteins from a multicellular organism, the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Although the genomes of two other multicellular organisms, the worm Caenorhabditis elegans and the flyD. melanogaster, have been sequenced in their entirety, in neither case has the full complement of ABC proteins been defined or classified systematically. In compiling the A. thaliana ABC protein inventory, we have adopted an intuitive nomenclature based on the acronyms of the prototypes, when available, of a particular ABC subfamily defined previously from another source, usually yeast or mammals (Table I), in order to expedite and simplify searches of the earlier literature. Where possible, a nomenclature similar to that applied to yeast (5Decottignies A. Goffeau A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) has been favored because yeast null mutants for ABC protein genes have been, and will likely continue to be, the system of choice for defining the functional characteristics of plant ABC proteins. The TAIRArabidopsis data base was first searched using the ABC signature (“C”) motif (4Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2013-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) as query sequence. Genes identified as encoding polypeptides containing such motifs were then screened for the presence of flanking Walker A and Walker B box motifs. The sequences of polypeptides containing all three motifs were then used as queries for BLAST searches of the GenBankTM non-redundant protein data base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) to identify their closest homologs in other organisms and tentatively assign theArabidopsis ABC proteins to subfamilies. Coding sequences and intron/exon boundaries were predicted using NetPlantGene (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/-netpage/) and GenScan (www.genes.mit.edu/genescan.html) data bases, and the results from each procedure were compared with each other, and when available, with the annotations in the Arabidopsis MIPS data base (www.mips.biochem.mpg.de/proj/thal/). Discrepancies were resolved by comparisons of the Arabidopsis sequences with those of their homologs from other organisms. As an additional fail-safe procedure, the Arabidopsis MIPS data base was repeatedly searched during the course of compiling this inventory with the keyword “ABC” (www.mips.biochem.mpg.de/cgi-bin/proj/thal/searcher?key=abc&contig+all) to ensure that putative gene products containing ABC signature motifs that had been discovered during the annotation process were not overlooked. Transmembrane spans were predicted using the SOSUI (www.sousi.proteome.bio.tuat.ac.jp/cgi-bin/sousi.cgi?/sousisubunit.html) and DAS (www.sbc.su.se/∼miklos/DAS/tmdas.cgi) algorithms. The deduced amino acid sequences of the putative ABC proteins identified were aligned using ClustalX (6Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54908) Google Scholar) and subjected to phylogenetic analysis by both the maximum parsimony and distance with neighbor-joining methods using PAUP4.0b4a (7Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar, 8Swofford D.L. PAUP, Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony, Version 402.b. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1999Google Scholar). Both analyses were subjected to 1000 bootstrap replicates. Although qualitatively similar results were obtained with both methods, only the single tree retrieved from the distance analysis is discussed in detail here. The sequences of all of the ABC proteins identified were used to query the Arabidopsisexpressed sequence tag (EST) data base (www.arabidopsis.org) for ESTs whose deduced translation products had identical sequences. The positives retrieved were confirmed or refuted by testing for precise alignment of their DNA sequences with those of the query ORF. Systematic BLAST searches of the TAIRArabidopsis data base with the ABC signature motif, of the MIPS data base with the keyword “ABC,” and of the GenBankTM non-redundant data base with the sequences of the putative proteins identified in the first two searches disclosed more than 200 potential ABC signature motifs of which 188 were flanked by Walker A and Walker B box motifs. After subdividing these proteins into intrinsic membrane proteins and other (“soluble”) proteins (soluble proteins or peripheral membrane proteins) according to whether they lacked or possessed transmembrane spans contiguous with the NBFs, respectively, the Arabidopsis genome was determined to contain 129 ORFs encoding ABC proteins with one or two NBFs, of which 103 encoded intrinsic membrane proteins and 26 encoded proteins lacking transmembrane spans (Tables II and III). Two features of theArabidopsis ABC superfamily were evident from the outset: its large size and the fact that full molecule and half-molecule transporters are approximately equally represented (52:51) among the membrane proteins identified.Table IISummary of Arabidopsis ABC proteinsChr IChr IIChr IIIChr IVChr VTotalWhole molecules1411196252MDR5384222MRP4380015PDR5431013AOH010001PMP000101Half-molecules971751351WBC75102529ATH0271616ATM000213TAP100012PMP100001Soluble proteins7155826RLI001102GCN101035SMC002024NAP6114315Total3019411623129The ORFs identified are classified into 12 subfamilies, whose names are derived from the yeast (PDR, PMP, ATM, and GCN) or animal (MDR, MRP, AOH, ATH, WBC, TAP, RLI, and SMC) prototypes (Table I), plus a heterogeneous group of soluble proteins or peripheral membrane proteins (the NAPs).

https://openalex.org/W2102342643,"The plasma membrane of mammalian cells is one of the tight barriers against gene transfer by synthetic delivery systems. Various agents have been used to facilitate gene transfer by destabilizing the endosomal membrane under acidic conditions, but their utility is limited, especially for gene transfer in vivo. In this article, we report that the protein transduction domain of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat protein (Tat peptide) greatly facilitates gene transfer via membrane destabilization. We constructed recombinant λ phage particles displaying Tat peptide on their surfaces and carrying mammalian marker genes as part of their genomes (Tat-phage). We demonstrate that, when animal cells are briefly exposed to Tat-phage, significant expression of phage marker genes is induced with no harmful effects to the cells. In contrast, recombinant phage displaying other functional peptides, such as the integrin-binding domain or a nuclear localization signal, could not induce detectable marker gene expression. The expression of marker genes induced by Tat-phage is not affected by endosomotropic agents but is partially impaired by inhibitors of caveolae formation. These data suggest that Tat peptide will become a useful component of synthetic delivery vehicles that promote gene transfer independently of the classical endocytic pathway.

However, none of the current technologies satisfies all of the requirements necessary for gene therapy. More than three-quarters of current gene therapy trials rely on various viral vectors, mainly because they deliver therapeutic genes much more efficiently and consistently than available nonviral vectors (1Luo D. Saltzman W.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the development of a novel and efficient nonviral delivery system is an important goal, because recombinant viruses still have a number of disadvantages as practical tools for medical application (1Luo D. Saltzman W.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Gene transfer into cultured mammalian cells using a synthetic carrier consists, in general, of the following steps: condensation of the DNA into a small complex, adsorption of the complex to the plasma membrane, traverse of the membrane by the complex, transport of the DNA into the nucleus, and unpacking the DNA in the nucleus (2Cotten M. Wagner E. Friedmann T. The Development of Human Gene Therapy. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 261-277Google Scholar). This schema also essentially describes the genome delivery of karyophilic recombinant viruses (3Kasamatsu H. Nakanishi A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1998; 52: 627-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Differences in the efficacy of viral and nonviral vectors reside partly in the mechanisms by which they deliver genes across the plasma membrane (2Cotten M. Wagner E. Friedmann T. The Development of Human Gene Therapy. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 261-277Google Scholar). Recombinant viruses deliver their genomes actively, either by membrane fusion or by membrane disruption, depending on their intrinsic machinery for infection. In contrast, most nonviral vehicles deliver their genes passively, relying on uptake into the vesicular compartments by endocytosis. A detailed understanding of the intracellular mechanisms of virus infection (nuclear transport of the viral genome and subsequent disassembly of the DNA-protein complex) has yet to be achieved (3Kasamatsu H. Nakanishi A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1998; 52: 627-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Therefore, most current efforts to refine nonviral delivery systems by mimicking viral functions focus on the first three stages. The importance of membrane destabilization in nonviral gene delivery systems was first realized with the discovery that adenovirus particles greatly facilitate receptor-mediated gene delivery through disruption of the endosome (4Curiel D.T. Agarwal S. Wagner E. Cotten M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8850-8854Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Since then, the roles of various chemical and biological agents have been examined in the facilitation of gene transfer by destabilization of the endosomal membrane under acidic conditions. These agents include endosomotropic agents, inactivated adenovirus particles, synthetic and natural amphiphilic peptides, cationic polymers, and synthetic neutral phospholipids (for a review, see Ref. 2Cotten M. Wagner E. Friedmann T. The Development of Human Gene Therapy. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 261-277Google Scholar). However, the utility of these agents is largely circumscribed, especially for in vivo application, by high toxicity and the instability of the complexes in the presence of serum proteins (2Cotten M. Wagner E. Friedmann T. The Development of Human Gene Therapy. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 261-277Google Scholar). Therefore, development of a novel and harmless agent that can facilitate the penetration of nucleic acids across the plasma membrane is a key to successful DNA delivery, even under the harsh conditions encountered in vivo. Recently, some transcription factors, including the Tat protein of human immunodeficiency virus (5Green M. Loewenstein P.M. Cell. 1988; 55: 1179-1188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar, 6Frankel A.D. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1988; 55: 1189-1193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2353) Google Scholar), VP22 protein of herpes simplex virus (7Elliott G. O'Hare P. Cell. 1997; 88: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar), and antennapedia protein of Drosophila(8Joliot A. Pernelle C. Deagostini-Bazin H. Prochiantz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1864-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar), have been shown to penetrate the plasma membrane directly from the cell surface. The peptide segments responsible for membrane penetration (the protein transduction domain (PTD)),1 consisting of 11–34 amino acid residues, were identified in the primary structures of these proteins by deletion analysis (for a review, see Ref. 9Derossi D. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 84-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). These PTDs have no common feature, except the presence of basic amino acid residues (arginine and lysine), which may be involved in contact with the negatively charged lipids or in membrane penetration (9Derossi D. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 84-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 10Derossi D. Calvet S. Trembleau A. Brunissen A. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 16010-16017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2071) Google Scholar). The PTDs also serve as trans-elements that facilitate membrane penetration by heterogeneous proteins and oligonucleotides (12Fawell S. Seery J. Daikh Y. Moore C. Chen L.L. Pepinsky B. Barsoum J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar, 13Allinquant B. Hantraye P. Mailleux P. Moya K. Bouillot C. Prochiantz A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 919-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 14Nagahara H. Vocero-Akbani A.M. Snyder E.L. Ho A. Latham D.G. Lissy N.A. Becker-Hapak M. Ezhevsky S.A. Dowdy S.F. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1449-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar, 15Schwarze S.R. Ho A. Vocero-Akbani A. Dowdy S.F. Science. 1999; 285: 1569-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). Therefore, the major role of PTDs in these phenomena is presumed to be in the destabilization of the lipid bilayer. In this article, we examine the potential of the PTD of Tat protein (Tat peptide) (11Vives E. Brodin P. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16010-16017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2071) Google Scholar) as an agent to stimulate gene transfer by membrane destabilization. We chose Tat peptide for this study because its function as a trans-element for membrane penetration has been analyzed in much greater detail than those of other PTDs (16Schwarze S.R. Hruska K.A. Dowdy S.F. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 290-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this peptide can facilitate the internalization of huge molecules, such as 45-nm dextran particles encapsulating magnetic beads (17Lewin M. Carlesso N. Tung C.H. Tang X.W. Cory D. Scadden D.T. Weissleder R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 410-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that Tat peptide displayed on the surface of λ phage greatly facilitates the transfer of marker genes encapsulated in the phage particles into mammalian cells, possibly via a nonendocytic pathway. These results strongly suggest that Tat peptide may become a useful component of synthetic gene delivery vehicles, applicable in thein vivo transfer of therapeutic genes.

Hoess R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1609-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), except that we used our original lysogenic bacterial strains. λ D1180 (Dam15 del EcoRI–SacI cIts857 nin5 Sam100) was generated by crossing λ Dam15 (22Campbell A. Virology. 1961; 14: 22-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) and λ gt11 (23Young R.A. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1194-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar), followed by deletion between unique EcoRI and SacI sites by linker oligonucleotides. The genome size of this phage is 78.5% of the wild type phage genome. The expression cassettes for enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) (CLONTECH Laboratories) and firefly luciferase (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) were constructed by inserting these cDNAs downstream of the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter to produce pCMV-GFP and pCMV-luc. λ D1180 (GFP) and λ D1180 (luc) were prepared by inserting the expression cassettes for GFP and luciferase, respectively, into the unique EcoRI site of λ D1180. Lysogenic Escherichia coli were prepared by infecting TOP10 (Invitrogen BV, Groningen, The Netherlands) (originally appeared as DH10B (24Grant S.G. Jessee J. Bloom F.R. Hanahan D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4645-4649Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar)) with λ D1180 (or with its derivatives) at 32 °C, as described previously (25Arber W. Enquist L. Hohn B. Murray N.E. Murray K. Hendrix R.W. Roberts J.W. Stahl F.W. Weisberg R.A. LAMBDA II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1983: 433-466Google Scholar). Plasmids pTrc-D, pTrc-TAT-D, pTrc-RGD-D, pTrc-VN-D, and pTrc-NLS-D were constructed from pTrcHisA (Invitrogen), using the gene D fragment from λ phage, isolated by polymerase chain reaction, and synthetic oligonucleotides encoding the Tat, RGD, VN, and NLS sequences, respectively. Primary structures of these chimeric D proteins are shown in Fig. 1 A. Tat and NLS peptides were displayed at the N terminus of D protein, whereas RGD and VN peptides were displayed at the C terminus of D protein, because we failed to produce the recombinant phage displaying RGD and VN peptides at the N terminus of D protein. Recombinant λ phage were prepared by inducing lysogenic E. coli carrying pTrc-D, pTrc-TAT-D, pTrc-RGD-D, pTrc-VN-D, and pTrc-NLS-D, at 45 °C for 15 min and then at 38 °C for 180 min (25Arber W.

Phage particles were recovered from the bacteria with chloroform treatment and purified by two rounds of cesium chloride equilibrium centrifugation (25Arber W. Enquist L. Hohn B. Murray N.E.

All phage were titrated by plaque assay, using LE392 cells as host, at 37 °C (25Arber W. Enquist L. Hohn B. Murray N.E. Murray K. Hendrix R.W. Roberts J.W. Stahl F.W. Weisberg R.A. LAMBDA II.

In the phage preparations used in this study, the number of infectious particles was identical to the number of physical particles, as estimated from the amount of DNA and protein. For the experiments using recombinant DNA, physical and biological containment conformed to the guidelines of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan. Purified λ phage (5.5 µg) was separated on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining or by immunoblotting with anti-D protein rabbit serum (1:1000) or anti-Tat protein rabbit serum (1:100), as described previously (26Okabe J. Eguchi A. Masago A. Hayakawa T. Nakanishi M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2639-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For the EDTA sensitivity assay (27Sternberg N. Weisberg R. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 117: 733-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), 5 × 106 plaque-forming units (pfu) of phage were incubated in buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mmMgCl2, pH 7.5), or in buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5), for 15 min at 37 °C. The phage suspension was then diluted with H-SM buffer containing 0.1% gelatin, and the titer was determined as described above. Purified phage particles were examined under an electron microscope by negative staining, using 4% uranyl acetate. All cell culture was performed at 37 °C under 5% CO2. COS-1, 293 (both obtained from RIKEN Cell Bank, Wako, Saitama, Japan), A431, and NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified minimum essential medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. WI38/VA13/2RA (obtained from the Health Science Research Resource Bank, Tokyo, Japan) and HeLa cells were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium (MEM), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. A standard protocol for gene transfer into cultured cells was followed. Cells were seeded at 2.5 × 104 cells/well, in 24-well plates, and cultured for 12 h. The cells were washed once with medium and incubated with 500 µl of medium containing recombinant phage (2.5 × 108 pfu), or DNA (10 ng, 2.5 × 108copies) complexed with cationic lipid for 6 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed twice with medium and then cultured for 48 h before assaying for the expression of marker genes. Purified phage genomic DNA was complexed with cationic lipids (DOTMA/DOPE or DOTAP), according to the procedures recommended by the suppliers. Transfection with the DEAE-dextran-DNA complex has been described previously (28Luthman H. Magnusson G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1295-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was evaluated using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and estimated in average relative light units with standard deviations. GFP was detected with fluorescence microscopy, using a GFPA cube (Olympus Optical Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The cell nucleus was localized with fluorescence microscopy, using 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole HCl and a WU cube (Olympus Optical Co. Ltd.), as described previously (29Eguchi A. Kondoh T. Kosaka H. Suzuki T. Momota H. Masago A. Yoshida T. Taira H. Ishii-Watabe A. Okabe J. Hu J. Miura N. Ueda S. Suzuki Y. Taki T. Hayakawa T. Nakanishi M. J. Biol.

Caveolin-1 was detected with fluorescence microscopy, using monoclonal anti-caveolin-1 and affinity-purified, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse IgG goat antibody (Organo Teknika Co., Durham, NC), as described previously (30Simpson J.C. Smith D.C. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 239: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Eight-week-old female BALB/c mice were used in this study. Recombinant phage (8.5 × 109pfu) or plasmid pCMV-GFP (58 ng, 8.5 × 109 copies), in 50 µl of H-SM buffer, were injected intraparenchymally into the left lobe of a mouse liver, with a 27-gauge needle. After 48 h, the tissue was fixed by perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, and a frozen section was examined for the expression of GFP by fluorescence microscopy, as described above. All animal experiments were performed according to the institutional guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. In this study, we examined the potential of Tat peptide to facilitate gene transfer into mammalian cells, by displaying it on λ phage particles that encapsulate marker genes. We employed the bacteriophage as a unique model for the development of a synthetic gene delivery system, because its size and structure resemble a condensed DNA-polymer complex. In addition, the peptide display systems established in λ phage (21Sternberg N. Hoess R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1609-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 31Maruyama I.N. Maruyama H.I. Brenner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Gene (Amst.). 1996; 183: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), filamentous phage (34Smith G.P. Science. 1985; 228: 1315-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (3151) Google Scholar), and T7 phage (35Houshmand H. Froman G. Magnusson G. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 268: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) offer unique opportunities for investigating the function of natural and artificial peptides in gene transfer. Among these candidates, λ phage has several attractive characteristics for our experimental purpose. First, λ phage particles can display various peptides more flexibly and more abundantly than other types of phage, as chimeras with one of the two major head proteins (D protein, 420 copies/particle) (21Sternberg N. Hoess R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1609-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 32Mikawa Y.G. Maruyama I.N. Brenner S. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) or with a major tail protein (V protein, 200 copies/particle) (31Maruyama I.N. Maruyama H.I. Brenner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8273-8277Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 33Dunn I.S. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 183: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). D protein is particularly important as a fusion partner for peptide display, because a variety of protein segments, consisting of up to 244 amino acid residues (36Lin J.T. Lis J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3237-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), can be successfully displayed either at the N terminus or at the C terminus of D proteins (37Yang F. Forrer P. Dauter Z. Conway J.F. Cheng N. Cerritelli M.E. Steven A.C. Pluckthun A. Wlodawer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Most importantly, DNA packaging occurs totally independently of the assembly of D and V proteins into the λ phage particles (21Sternberg N. Hoess R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1609-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 31Maruyama I.N. Maruyama H.I. Brenner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8273-8277Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 32Mikawa Y.G. Maruyama I.N. Brenner S. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 33Dunn I.S. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 183: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), which allows us to analyze the biological function of displayed peptides separately from DNA encapsulation. Second, λ phage can encapsulate large duplex DNA fragments, of up to 50 kilobase pairs in size, in a small head of 55 nm diameter (38Georgopoulos C. Tilly K. Casjens S. Hendrix R.W. Roberts J.W. Stahl F.W. Weisberg R.A. LAMBDA II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1983: 279-304Google Scholar). The DNA is tightly packed in the proteinaceous shell, which consists of another major head protein (E protein), and is completely protected from destructive environmental nucleases (38Georgopoulos C. Tilly K. Casjens S. Hendrix R.W. Roberts J.W. Stahl F.W. Weisberg R.A. LAMBDA II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1983: 279-304Google Scholar). These characteristics make λ phage a more adequate model of a duplex DNA-polymer complex than the filamentous phage, because the latter encapsulates single-stranded circular genomic DNA in a long, proteinaceous sheath (890 × 7 nm). Furthermore, the λ phage particle is adaptable to large scale production, is physically stable, and can be purified under extremely stringent conditions. For displaying the PTD of Tat protein (amino acid residues 43–60, Tat peptide) (10Derossi D. Calvet S. Trembleau A. Brunissen A. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18188-18193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar, 11Vives E. Brodin P. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16010-16017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2071) Google Scholar) on the λ phage particle, we constructed a chimeric protein in which the Tat peptide was fused to the N terminus of the phage D protein (Tat-D) (Fig.1 A) (21Sternberg N. Hoess R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1609-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We then prepared the phage particles carrying Tat-D protein (Tat-phage) by simultaneously inducing the replication of the lysogenic phage genome with the defective D gene and the production of Tat-D protein in single bacterial cells. The recombinant phage also contained the expression cassette for either GFP or firefly luciferase as part of the phage genome encapsulated in the head. For controls, we also prepared three other recombinant phage, NLS-phage, RGD-phage, and VN-phage, using a similar procedure. NLS-phage displays a 32-mer peptide derived from the SV40 T-antigen (Fig. 1 A), which functions as a strong nuclear localization signal (20Yoneda Y. Semba T. Kaneda Y. Noble R.L. Matsuoka Y. Kurihara T. Okada Y. Imamoto N. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 201: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In a separate study, we found that NLS-phage can actively penetrate into the nucleus when injected directly into the cytoplasm. 2T. Akuta, H. Okuyama, H. Inokuchi, Y. Suzuki, A. Eguchi, T. Senda, E. Nagoshi, H. Mizuguchi, T. Hayakawa, K. Takeda, M. Hasegawa and M. Nakanishi, manuscript in preparation. RGD-phage displays a cyclic 10-mer integrin-binding peptide (RGD peptide) (18Hart S.L. Knight A.M. Harbottle R.P. Mistry A. Hunger H.D. Cutler D.F. Williamson R. Coutelle C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12468-12474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at the C terminus of the chimeric D protein (Fig. 1 A). This peptide has been used successfully to target filamentous phage to the cell surface, with high affinity (18Hart S.L. Knight A.M. Harbottle R.P. Mistry A. Hunger H.D. Cutler D.F. Williamson R. Coutelle C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12468-12474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). VN-phage displays the heparin-binding domain of vitronectin (VN peptide) (19Vogel B.E. Lee S.J. Hildebrand A. Craig W. Pierschbacher M.D. Wong-Staal F. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) at the C terminus of the chimeric D protein (Fig. 1 A). Both VN peptide and Tat peptide are rich in basic amino acid residues and are reported to bind to the same domain of cell surface αvβ5 integrin (19Vogel B.E. Lee S.J. Hildebrand A. Craig W. Pierschbacher M.D. Wong-Staal F. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). We purified the phage particles carrying either normal D or chimeric D proteins on their surfaces and examined their protein composition by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1 B). Tat-phage and phage carrying normal D protein (wild type phage) have an almost identical protein composition, except that, instead of D protein (11 kDa), the former contain Tat-D protein (14 kDa), which can be detected both by anti-D antibody and by anti-Tat antibody (Fig. 1 B). Other recombinant phage carry chimeric D proteins of sizes predicted from their primary structures (Fig. 1 B). In addition, all of these preparations are almost free from host bacterial proteins that might interfere with gene transfer (Fig. 1 B). We also examined the functional association of chimeric D protein with recombinant phage particles by determining the sensitivity of the phage to a chelating reagent. D protein is dispensable in the phage when the genome size is less than 82% that of wild type λ phage (48,514 bp) (27Sternberg N. Weisberg R. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 117: 733-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), as was the recombinant phage used in this study. However, D protein is essential in maintaining the phage structure when magnesium ions are depleted with a chelating reagent (1 mm EDTA) (27Sternberg N. Weisberg R. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 117: 733-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We found that all of the recombinant phage carrying chimeric D proteins were as resistant to treatment with EDTA as wild type phage, whereas D-deficient phage were highly sensitive to the same treatment (Fig. 1 C, filled bar). These results indicate that chimeric D proteins used in this study stabilize the phage particle through physical association with the phage head, like normal D protein. We further confirmed, by negative staining under electron microscopy, that Tat-phage has a structure indistinguishable from that of wild type phage (Fig. 1, D and E). We then incubated cultured cells with these recombinant phage containing the"

The endothelial cells in growing blood vessels of Ang-1 knockout mice have a rounded appearance and are poorly associated with one another and their underlying basement membranes (Dumont, D.

In this study we asked whether Ang-1 might act as a direct substrate for cell adhesion. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) plated for a brief period on different substrates were found to adhere and spread well on Ang-1. Similar results were seen on angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2)-coated surfaces, although cells did not spread well on Ang-2. Ang-1, but not Ang-2, supported HUVEC migration, and this was independent of growth factor activity. When the same experiments were done with fibroblasts that either lacked, or stably expressed, Tie2, results similar to those with HUVECs were seen, suggesting that adhesion to the angiopoietins was independent of Tie2 and not limited to endothelial cells. Interestingly, when integrin-blocking agents were included in these assays, adhesion to either angiopoietin was significantly reduced. Moreover, Chinese hamster ovary-B2 cells lacking the α5 integrin subunit did not adhere to Ang-1, but they did adhere to Ang-2. Stable expression of the human α5 integrin subunit in these cells rescued adhesion to Ang-1 and promoted an increase in adhesion to Ang-2. We also found that Ang-1 and Ang-2 bind rather selectively to vitronectin. These results suggest that, beyond their role in modulating Tie2 signaling, Ang-1 and Ang-2 can directly support cell adhesion mediated by integrins.

Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (3426) Google Scholar). This process can be divided into several distinct, often overlapping, phases. In general, angiogenesis initiates with vasodilation and increases in endothelial permeability. Subsequently, endothelial cells begin to proliferate and migrate toward the angiogenic stimulus. During the final maturation stages, the endothelial cells acquire a more differentiated state marked by lumen formation and production and assembly of a complex basement membrane. Finally, periendothelial cells are recruited into the area thereby providing further support for the new vessel. A balance between stimulatory and inhibitory signals controls each step during angiogenesis. Such signals can arrive in the form of growth factors, cytokines, and extracellular matrix (ECM)1 proteins, to name a few. These extracellular cues are then transduced to the cytoplasm by various different classes of cell surface receptors, with the most common being members of either the receptor tyrosine kinase or integrin superfamilies (5Beckner M.E. Cancer Invest. 1999; 17: 594-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).The angiopoietins, along with their cell surface receptor tyrosine kinase, Tie2, comprise one of the most widely studied families of angiogenic factors. Unlike other well known angiogenic factors, the angiopoietins are not mitogenic for endothelial cells. Thus, their biological function is not well understood. The angiopoietin family members contain an N-terminal coiled-coil domain as well as a C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain that shares a high degree of homology to the analogous domains in the ECM proteins tenascin-C and fibrinogen-γ and -β (6Davis S.

Maisonpierre P.C. Davis S. Sato T.N. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1996; 87: 1171-1180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2371) Google Scholar). Conversely, overexpression of Ang-1 in transgenic mice leads to an increase in both vessel size and extent of branching (10Suri C. McClain J. Thurston G. McDonald D.M. Zhou H. Oldmixon E.H. Sato T.N. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1998; 282: 468-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar) as well as to vessels that are resistant to inflammatory agent-induced leakage (11Thurston G. Suri C. Smith K. McClain J. Sato T.N. Yancopoulos G.D. McDonald D.M. Science. 1999; 286: 2511-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar). Furthermore, adenoviral administration of Ang-1 is also an effective way to prevent plasma leakage in the adult vasculature (12Thurston G. Rudge J.S. Ioffe E. Zhou H. Ross L. Croll S.D. Glazer N. Holash J. McDonald D.M. Yancopoulos G.D. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 460-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar).The role of Ang-2 in the developing vascular system is less well understood. In vitro, Ang-2 does not activate Tie2 in endothelial cells even though its affinity for the receptor is similar to that of Ang-1 (7Maisonpierre P.C. Suri C. Jones P.F. Bartunkova S. Wiegand S.J. Radziejewski C. Compton D. McClain J. Aldrich T.H. Papadopoulos N. Daly T.J. Davis S. Sato T.N. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1997; 277: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (2921) Google Scholar). Moreover, the presence of excess Ang-2 can prevent Tie2 phosphorylation induced by Ang-1. Additionally, transgenic overexpression of Ang-2 in mice results in embryonic lethality, with the animals displaying a phenotype similar to that of Ang-1 knockout mice (7Maisonpierre P.C. Suri C. Jones P.F. Bartunkova S. Wiegand S.J. Radziejewski C. Compton D. McClain J. Aldrich T.H. Papadopoulos N. Daly T.J. Davis S. Sato T.N. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1997; 277: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (2921) Google Scholar). These findings have led to the hypothesis that the role of Ang-2 in vivo is to serve as a natural antagonist for Ang-1.Based on the aforementioned data with Ang-1 knockout and transgenic animals, it has been suggested that Ang-1 may be a critical mediator of endothelial cell-cell or cell-ECM interactions. Currently, however, very little data are available to support this hypothesis. In a study using a pro-B cell line stably expressing Tie2, it was found that the addition of Ang-1 to the culture medium enhances cell adhesion to fibronectin (13Takakura N. Huang X.L. Naruse T. Hamaguchi I. Dumont D.J. Yancopoulos G.D. Suda T. Immunity. 1998; 9: 677-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In another report, fluorescence-activated cell-sorter Tie2-positive hematopoietic cells also responded to Ang-1 treatment with increased adherence to a fibronectin coated substrate (14Huang X.L. Takakura N. Suda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In both studies, excess Ang-2 or soluble Tie2 receptor was able to block the effect of Ang-1, suggesting that Ang-1 signals through Tie2 to modulate the activity of adhesion receptor(s) on the surface of hematopoietic cells.In this study, we have examined the role of Ang-1 and Ang-2 in direct cell adhesion in vitro. We show that although both Ang-1 and Ang-2 serve as substrates for cell adhesion, they differentially regulate cell spreading, cell migration, and activation of intracellular signaling pathways. Additionally, we report that Tie2 is not required for cell adhesion or migration, as NIH 3T3 fibroblasts lacking this receptor adhere to Ang-1 and Ang-2 and migrate on Ang-1 as well as fibroblasts ectopically expressing Tie2. Therefore, we propose the existence of additional cell surface receptors for both Ang-1 and Ang-2, and we suggest that integrins may be involved directly in cell adhesion to these angiogenic proteins.DISCUSSIONOur results show that cells adhere directly to Ang-1 and Ang-2 and that this adhesion is mediated, at least in part, by integrins. We also find that Ang-1, but not Ang-2, can support robust cell migration independent of Tie2 function. Adhesion to Ang-1 or Ang-2 results in differential effects on FAK and MAPK signaling as well as on cell spreading and focal contact formation. Finally, both Ang-1 and Ang-2 bind vitronectin in vitro. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of an angiogenic factor acting directly as a substrate for cell adhesion.Previous studies have demonstrated that transforming growth factor β can serve as a substrate for cell adhesion. For example, Mungeret al. (25Munger J.S. Harpel J.G. Giancotti F.G. Rifkin D.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2627-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) found that latent forms of transforming growth factor β support cell adhesion. This adhesion could be blocked with RGD peptides or with monoclonal antibodies to the β1 or αv integrin subunits. In another report, αvβ6 was shown to bind latent transforming growth factor β1 in vitro (26Munger J.S. Huang X. Kawakatsu H. Griffiths M.J. Dalton S.L. Wu J. Pittet J.F. Kaminski N. Garat C. Matthay M.A. Rifkin D.B. Sheppard D. Cell. 1999; 96: 319-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1620) Google Scholar). Additionally, β6-transfected cells bound to dishes coated with large latent transforming growth factor β1 complexes, and this adhesion induced the phosphorylation of both FAK and paxillin. Thus, although our findings with Ang-1 and Ang-2 are novel, they do not represent the first report of a cytokine supporting cell adhesion in an integrin-dependent fashion.The concentrations of soluble Ang-1 necessary to modulate downstream activities such as increased cell survival (27Kim I. Kim H.G. So J.N. Kim J.H. Kwak H.J. Koh G.Y. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) or enhanced cell migration (21Witzenbichler B. Maisonpierre P.C. Jones P. Yancopoulos G.D. Isner J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18514-18521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) were 0.2 µg/ml or 0.1–1 µg/ml, respectively. These concentrations are considerably lower than those required to support good cell adhesion in this report (6–10 µg/ml). There are at least two important points to consider when comparing these concentration differences. First, protein adsorption to a hydrophobic surface results in irreversible denaturation of native protein conformation. The extent of denaturation varies from protein to protein and from surface to surface (28Norde W. Giacomelli C.E. J. Biotechnol. 2000; 79: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). However, changes in protein structure upon adsorption can have a significant impact on protein function. For example, specific activity of the proteolytic enzyme α-chymotrypsin disappeared almost completely upon adsorption to polystyrene (29Norde W. Zoungrana T. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1998; 28: 133-143PubMed Google Scholar). The extent of adsorptive denaturation and subsequent loss of activity can be decreased by using more concentrated coating solutions as demonstrated for α-chymotrypsin and the lipolytic enzyme, cutinase (29Norde W. Zoungrana T. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1998; 28: 133-143PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that in our studies, the relatively high coating concentrations used are necessary to prevent denaturation at the substrate surface. The second point to consider regards the affinities of growth factor receptors versus integrins for their respective ligands. The dissociation constant of Ang-1 or Ang-2 binding to Tie2 was calculated to be ∼3−9m (7Maisonpierre P.C. Suri C. Jones P.F. Bartunkova S. Wiegand S.J. Radziejewski C. Compton D. McClain J. Aldrich T.H. Papadopoulos N. Daly T.J. Davis S. Sato T.N. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1997; 277: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (2921) Google Scholar). By comparison, integrins typically have lower affinities for their ligands, with dissociation constants typically ranging from 10−7 to 10−9m (30Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4492-4500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Jung S.M. Moroi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14827-14837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Considering the potential for adsorptive protein denaturation and that integrins have lower affinities for ligand than do growth factor receptors, it is not surprising that relatively high concentrations of the angiopoietins are required to support good cell adhesion.Upon initial contact with the ECM, cells generally extend finger-like filopodia and actin-rich lamellipodia. The spreading process then culminates with the formation of focal contacts. These focal contacts contain proteins such as talin and vinculin that serve as linkers between the extracellular environment and the cytoskeleton through their direct interactions with integrins and actin, respectively, and signal transduction proteins such as FAK and members of the Rho family of GTPases. Together, this complex of proteins transduces signals from the ECM and mediates changes in cell morphology, migration, proliferation, and differentiation (23Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3788) Google Scholar). As seen in Figs. 2 and6 C, cell adhesion to Ang-1 induces morphological changes similar to those seen when cells are attached to known ECM proteins. On the other hand, cells attached to Ang-2 do not spread well, nor do they form actin-rich focal contacts. The biochemical nature of this effect on spreading is currently unknown, but based on findings in other cell systems it is possible that the difference is the result of differential regulation of signaling via the GTPases Rho, Rac, and Cdc42. For example, expression of dominant negative mutants of either Rac or Cdc42 was found to inhibit NIH 3T3 cell spreading on fibronectin (32Price L.S. Leng J. Schwartz M.A. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). In another report, expression of dominant negative Rac or Cdc42 significantly inhibited Rat1 cell spreading on fibronectin but had no effect on overall cell adhesion (33Clark E.A. King W.G. Brugge J.S. Symons M. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 573-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that cell adhesion to Ang-1 and Ang-2 has distinct effects on the activity of these GTPases.An equally plausible, non-mutually exclusive explanation for the differences observed in cell spreading, focal contact formation, and migration on Ang-1 versus Ang-2 may be the preferential use of different integrins for adhesion to the two proteins. Although the data in Figs. 7 and 8 suggest that both β1 and αvβ5 integrins mediate cell adhesion to Ang-1 and Ang-2, we hypothesize that cells may rely more heavily on β1 integrins to bind Ang-1, but utilize primarily αvβ5 to bind Ang-2. Several lines of evidence support this hypothesis. First, CHO-B2 cells adhere well to Ang-2 but not to Ang-1. Stable expression of the α5integrin subunit rescues cell adhesion to Ang-1, and complete inhibition of CHO-B2/α27 cell adhesion to Ang-1 is observed in the presence of anti-α5 integrin blocking antibodies. Considering that B2 cells attach to Ang-2 and that only partial inhibition of CHO-B2/α27 cell adhesion to Ang-2 is observed with anti-α5, it is likely that some other integrin is primarily responsible for CHO-B2 adhesion to Ang-2. Because CHO-B2 cells express no cell surface β1 integrins and produce no detectable β3 mRNA, but do make β5 and adhere to vitronectin (18Zhang Z. Morla A.O. Vuori K. Bauer J.S. Juliano R.L. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), it is possible that these cells rely heavily on αvβ5 to adhere to vitronectin and Ang-2. Indeed, inclusion of the function-blocking anti-αvβ5 integrin antibody P1F6 in adhesion experiments completely inhibited CHO-B2 adhesion to vitronectin and partially blocked adhesion to Ang-2 (data not shown). Initial studies of αvβ5-mediated cell adhesion to vitronectin established that αvβ5 does not localize to focal contacts or associate with the actin cytoskeleton (34Wayner E.A. Orlando R.A. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 919-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies found that activation of protein kinase C indirectly via epidermal growth factor stimulation or directly with phorbol esters promoted αvβ5-mediated cell spreading, focal contact formation, and migration on vitronectin (35Klemke R.L. Yebra M. Bayna E.M. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 36Lewis J.M. Cheresh D.A. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1323-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). These findings are similar to our data with cells migrating or spreading on Ang-2. As seen in Fig. 3, cells do not migrate on Ang-2 in the absence of growth factor, but they do migrate to some extent in the presence of growth factor. In addition, cells do not spread on Ang-2 (Figs. 2 and6 C), but our preliminary results show that the addition of lysophosphatidic acid, an activator of the Rho GTPase which has been shown to induce focal adhesion and actin stress fiber formation (37Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3643-3654PubMed Google Scholar,38Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3797) Google Scholar), induces substantial spreading on Ang-2 (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that the integrins responsible for adhesion to Ang-2 require activation of distinct intracellular signaling pathways to mediate migration and spreading. On the other hand, the primary Ang-1-binding integrins do not require activation of other intracellular signaling pathways to induce migration, spreading, or focal contact formation. Our data, together with published data indicating that exogenous growth factor is not required for β1-mediated spreading or migration on collagen (35Klemke R.L. Yebra M. Bayna E.M. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), are consistent with the hypothesis that β1 integrins serve as the primary Ang-1 adhesion receptors.Endothelial cell migration is an important aspect of the angiogenic process, and therefore much research is focused on the intracellular mechanisms that control vascular cell motility. Substantial amounts of data implicate both ECM-integrin and growth factor-receptor interactions as critical mediators of this process (4Carmeliet P. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (3426) Google Scholar). Recently, two groups have shown that soluble Ang-1 potentiates cell migration on fibronectin (21Witzenbichler B. Maisonpierre P.C. Jones P. Yancopoulos G.D. Isner J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18514-18521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 39Kim I. Kim H.G. Moon S.O. Chae S.W. So J.N. Koh K.N. Ahn B.C. Koh G.Y. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 952-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In another report, it was demonstrated that Ang-1 induces capillary sprouting of endothelial cells cultured in a three-dimensional collagen gel (40Koblizek T.I. Weiss C. Yancopoulos G.D. Deutsch U. Risau W. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 529-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). In each of these systems, the migratory phenotype induced by Ang-1 was blocked by excess soluble Tie2, suggesting that Ang-1 was acting through this receptor to modulate the function of the cellular migration machinery. In this report, we show that Ang-1 can support directed cell migration in vitro independent of Tie2 function (Fig. 3). Our experiments were performed in the absence of any additional ECM components, added serum, or growth factors, suggesting that Ang-1 alone supports cell migration. Considering that both NIH 3T3 and MG Tie2 fibroblasts migrate on Ang-1, it is likely that this process is also mediated primarily by member(s) of the integrin superfamily.Integrins are known to activate intracellular signaling pathways, including the FAK and ras/MAPK pathways (23Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3788) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 4, HUVEC adhesion to Ang-1 and Ang-2 induces phosphorylation of both FAK and MAPK. EDTA and RGD peptides, agents that have distinct inhibitory effects on HUVEC adhesion to Ang-1 and Ang-2, also block activation of MAPK (Fig. 5 B). These findings suggest that signaling to FAK and MAPK is mediated, at least in part, by integrins. We cannot, however, rule out the possibility of cross-talk between integrins and Tie2 in signaling to these molecules. In fact, stimulation of endothelial cells with Ang-1 has been shown to induce activation of both MAPK and FAK (39Kim I. Kim H.G. Moon S.O. Chae S.W. So J.N. Koh K.N. Ahn B.C. Koh G.Y. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 952-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 41Fujikawa K. de Aos Scherpenseel I. Jain S.K. Presman E. Christensen R.A. Varticovski L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The precise role of Tie2 in these studies is not clear because neither group used excess soluble receptor to block Ang-1-mediated activation of MAPK or FAK. Therefore, the possibility exists that Ang-1 action was mediated by integrins in these studies. Elucidation of the signaling induced by cell adhesion to Ang-1 and Ang-2 will require careful analysis of the pathways in multiple cell types that adhere well to these substrates.A common property of ECM proteins is that many contain distinct binding sites for not only cell surface integrins, but other ECM proteins as well. For example, it is well established that nidogen can bind both laminin and collagen IV in vitro, and it is thought that this activity is necessary for the stabilization of complex basement membranes structures in vivo (42Yurchenco P.D. O'Rear J.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 674-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that both Ang-1 and Ang-2 can bind to vitronectin in vitro. The functional significance of the Ang-1 and Ang-2 interaction with vitronectin is currently unknown, although the recent suggestion that both Ang-1 and vitronectin can be found within platelet α-granules indicates a potential role in hemostasis (43Asch E. Podack E. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1372-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 44Browder T. Folkman J. Pirie-Shepherd S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1521-1524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar).The finding that Ang-1 serves as an adhesive protein helps to explain several key findings in the angiogenesis field. First, Ang-1 knockout mice are embryonic lethal and possess defects in the angiogenic process (3Suri C. Jones P.F. Patan S. Bartunkova S. Maisonpierre P.C. Davis S. Sato T.N. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1996; 87: 1171-1180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2371) Google Scholar). Endothelial cells in these embryos are rounded and appear detached from their basement membranes. Our demonstration that Ang-1 can directly support cell adhesion and spreading may provide a mechanistic explanation for the endothelial cell morphology observed in these embryos. Second, overexpression of Ang-2 in endothelial cells of transgenic mice resulted in an embryonic lethal phenotype that was more severe than that seen in Ang-1 or Tie2 knockout embryos (7Maisonpierre P.C. Suri C. Jones P.F. Bartunkova S. Wiegand S.J. Radziejewski C. Compton D. McClain J. Aldrich T.H. Papadopoulos N. Daly T.J. Davis S. Sato T.N. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1997; 277: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (2921) Google Scholar). It is possible that some of the phenotype in these animals resulted from the vast abundance of Ang-2 directly altering endothelial cell adhesivity and spreading, independent of its effects on Tie2 signaling. Third, two different mouse models that overexpress Ang-1 produce blood vessels that are leakage-resistant (11Thurston G. Suri C. Smith K. McClain J. Sato T.N. Yancopoulos G.D. McDonald D.M. Science. 1999; 286: 2511-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar, 12Thurston G. Rudge J.S. Ioffe E. Zhou H. Ross L. Croll S.D. Glazer N. Holash J. McDonald D.M. Yancopoulos G.D. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 460-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). However, no explanation for this reduction in leakiness exists. Blood-borne molecules can leak through the vessel wall via several pathways (45Jain R.K. Munn L.L. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 131-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). One of these pathways is directly through endothelial clefts at sites of weak cell-cell or cell-ECM contacts (46Lum H. Malik A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: L223-L241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on our findings, it is possible that Ang-1 is directly ligating endothelial cell surface adhesion molecules in the Ang-1 overexpressor anim"

https://openalex.org/W1978891369,"Arginase shares a common substrate, L-arginine, with nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS). It is thought that arginase, if it is expressed in the endothelium, might play a pivotal role in the regulation of NO-mediated vasodilation by reducing the L-arginine availability to NOS. In the present study, we wanted to determine whether arginase is expressed and active in coronary arterioles and to demonstrate whether endothelial arginase can influence NO production and play a functional role in regulating NO-mediated dilation. In this regard, the expression of arginase mRNA and distribution of arginase protein in porcine coronary microvessels were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry, respectively. To assess the role of arginase in vasoregulation directly, porcine subepicardial coronary arterioles (60–110 µm in diameter) were isolated, cannulated, and pressurized for in vitro study under the conditions with and without arginase inhibition. Molecular evidence indicated that arginase I, but not arginase II, mRNA was expressed in the coronary arterioles. The constitutive expression of arginase I protein in the coronary arteriolar endothelial cells was revealed immunohistochemically. Adenosine and serotonin stimulated a threefold increase in NO release and produced dilation of isolated coronary arterioles. NOS inhibitor L- NMMA abolished the stimulated NO release and attenuated the dilations in response to these agonists. In contrast to L-NMMA, arginase inhibitor α-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) increased the NO release by about 80% and also enhanced vasodilations in response to adenosine and serotonin. DFMO inhibited arginase (by 80%), but not NOS, activity in these microvessels without affecting their dilation in response to sodium nitroprusside. Similar to DFMO, intraluminal application of L-arginine enhanced NO-mediated vasodilations. The DFMO-enhanced vasodilation was not observed in the presence of L-NMMA or after endothelial removal, which suggests a regulatory role of endothelial arginase in the NO- mediated response. Collectively, this study provides novel findings that the arginase expressed in the endothelium plays a counteracting role in the stimulated NO production, and thus NO-mediated vasodilatory function."

https://openalex.org/W2135924360,"To elucidate the mechanisms of microgravity-induced muscle atrophy, we focused on fast-type myosin heavy chain (MHC) degradation and expression of proteases in atrophied gastrocnemius muscles of neonatal rats exposed to 16-d spaceflight (STS-90). The spaceflight stimulated ubiquitination of proteins, including a MHC molecule, and accumulation of MHC degradation fragments in the muscles. Semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction revealed that the spaceflight significantly increased mRNA levels of cathepsin L, proteasome components (RC2 and RC9), polyubiquitin, and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme in the muscles, compared with those of ground control rats. The levels of μ-calpain, m-calpain, cathepsin B, and cathepsin H mRNAs were not changed by the spaceflight. We also found that tail-suspension of rats for 10 d or longer caused the ubiquitination and degradation of MHC in gastrocnemius muscle, as was observed in the spaceflight rats. In the muscle of suspended rats, these changes were closely associated with activation of proteasome and up-regulation of expression of mRNA for the proteasome components and polyubiquitin. Administration of a cysteine protease inhibitor, E-64, to the suspended rats did not prevent the MHC degradation. Our results suggest that spaceflight induces the degradation of muscle contractile proteins, including MHC, possibly through a ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2077127766,"Activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) has been found to play an essential role in the inhibition of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-mediated apoptosis. NF-κB regulates several antiapoptotic molecules including inhibitors of apoptosis, Bcl-2 family proteins (A1 and Bcl-XL), and IEX-IL. Here we report that the expression of a small death effector domain (DED)-containing protein, NDED (NF-κB-inducible DED-containing protein), depends on the activation of NF-κB. The inhibition of NF-κB by IκBα, a natural inhibitor of NF-κB, suppressed NDED mRNA expression induced by TNF. The restoration of NDED in NF-κB null cells inhibited TNF-induced apoptosis. Intriguingly, unlike the caspase-8 inhibitor cellular FADD-like interleukin-1β converting enzyme-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP), NDED suppressed TNF-mediated apoptosis by inhibiting TNF-induced caspase-8 enzymatic activity but not the processing of caspase-8. Furthermore, NDED could not inhibit etoposide-mediated apoptosis that is independent of caspase-8 activation. Our results provide the first demonstration that NF-κB transcriptionally induces the DED-containing protein to suppress TNF-mediated apoptosis by inhibiting caspase-8 activity, which offers new insight into the antiapoptotic mechanism of NF-κB.

The inhibition of NF-κB by IκBα, a natural inhibitor of NF-κB, suppressed NDED mRNA expression induced by TNF. The restoration of NDED in NF-κB null cells inhibited TNF-induced apoptosis. Intriguingly, unlike the caspase-8 inhibitor cellular FADD-like interleukin-1β converting enzyme-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP), NDED suppressed TNF-mediated apoptosis by inhibiting TNF-induced caspase-8 enzymatic activity but not the processing of caspase-8. Furthermore, NDED could not inhibit etoposide-mediated apoptosis that is independent of caspase-8 activation. Our results provide the first demonstration that NF-κB transcriptionally induces the DED-containing protein to suppress TNF-mediated apoptosis by inhibiting caspase-8 activity, which offers new insight into the antiapoptotic mechanism of NF-κB. tumor necrosis factor TNF receptor I nuclear factor-κB Fas-associated death domain protein death effector domain NF-κB-inducible DED-containing protein squamous cell carcinoma cells inhibitor of kappa Bα super-repressor form of IκBα cellular FADD-like interleukin-1β converting enzyme-inhibitory protein DNA fragmentation factor death-inducing signaling complex Activation of the TNF1receptor I (TNFRI) by TNF leads to the recruitment of the death domain-containing protein TNFRI-associated death domain protein and receptor-interacting protein to the receptor complex (1Darnay BG.

Along with the receptor-interacting protein and other signaling molecules, TNFRI-associated death domain protein can activate the NF-κB signaling pathway or trigger the caspase cascade by interacting with FADD (Fas-associated death domain protein) in the absence of NF-κB activation (1Darnay BG.

NF-κB is a stress-responsive transcription factor that plays important roles in inflammation and infection (2Devin A. Cook A. Lin Y. Rodriguez Y. Kelliher M. Liu Z.G. Immunity. 2000; 12: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 12Ghosh S. May M. Kopp E. Annu. Rev.

Classical NF-κB is a heterodimer composed of p50 and p65/RelA and is sequestered in the cytoplasm by the IκB group of inhibitory proteins. Proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF activate IκB kinase to phosphorylate the conserved N-terminal region of IκB proteins. The phosphorylated IκB is ubiquitinated and subsequently degraded by the 26S proteasome, resulting in the nuclear translocation of NF-κB where it activates transcription (2Devin A. Cook A. Lin Y.

Several important antiapoptotic molecules have been identified that are transcriptionally regulated by NF-κB. These molecules include inhibitors of apoptosis family proteins, TNFR-associated factor family proteins, Bcl-2 family members A1 and Bcl-XL, and IEX-1L (20Wang C.-Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G.

However, overexpression of these molecules cannot completely inhibit TNF-induced apoptosis, indicating that NF-κB may regulate other genes to suppress apoptosis. During the process of searching for other NF-κB-inducible genes, we found that one of the TNF-induced genes, previously namedGG2–1 (27Kumar D. Whiteside T.L. Kasid U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2973-2978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) or SCC-S2 (28Madrid L.V. Wang C.-Y. Guttridge D.C. Schottelius A.J.G. Baldwin A.S. Mayo M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1626-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), was transcriptionally regulated by NF-κB. Interestingly, this gene has one DED domain and partially inhibits TNF killing by unknown mechanisms (28Madrid L.V. Wang C.-Y. Guttridge D.C. Schottelius A.J.G. Baldwin A.S. Mayo M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1626-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Because we found that GG2–1 or SCC-S2 was regulated by NF-κB as presented here, for convenience we renamed it NDED (NF-κB-inducible death effector domain-containing protein). Given that the DED-containing protein plays a role in the death signal transduction (1Darnay BG. Aggarwal B.B. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1999; 58 Suppl. 1: I2-I13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Devin A. Cook A. Lin Y. Rodriguez Y. Kelliher M. Liu Z.G. Immunity. 2000; 12: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 3Ashkenazi A. Dixit V. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5151) Google Scholar), this study was undertaken to determine whether NDED is an authentic NF-κB-regulated antiapoptotic molecule and how NDED suppresses apoptosis. Our results demonstrated that the overexpression of NDED suppressed TNF-mediated apoptosis in NF-κB null cells. Intriguingly, NDED inhibited TNF-induced caspase-8 activity but not the processing of caspase-8, subsequently resulting in inhibition of Bid cleavage and caspase-3 activation. Human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells SCC15 (ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 µg/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. Human fibrosarcoma cells HT1080V and HT1080I cells were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 µg/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 200 µg/ml hygromycin (15Wang C.-Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2511) Google Scholar). To acquire the full-length encoding region for NDED, total RNA was prepared from TNF-treated HT1080V cells. One µg of total RNA was reverse transcribed with reverse transcriptase and amplified using an reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction kit according to manufacturer protocol (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The 5′ and 3′ primers used for amplification of the NDED coding region were 5′-CCGATGGCCACAGATGTCTT-3′ and 5′-1GCTCATATGTTCTCTTCATC-3′. The full-length NDED cDNA fragment was purified and subcloned into a pCR3.1 vector using a TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). To add a FLAG epitope to the N terminus of NDED, the full-length NDED cDNA fragment was then subcloned into the pCMV2-FLAG vector. Automated sequence analysis of both strands confirmed that the cDNA encoding the NDED fragment was in the expression frame. HT1080I cells stably expressing NDED were made by co-transfecting in HT1080I cells with pCMV2-FLAG-NDED vector or empty control vector and pcDNA3.1 (−) vector containing the G418 selectable marker using LipofectAMINE according to manufacturer instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Two days after transfection, cells were selected for resistance to 600 µg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Individual clones expressing pCMV-FLAG-NDED were screened after 2 weeks of selection with a monoclonal antibody against the FLAG epitope (Sigma). Positive clones expressing NDED were pooled and designated as HT1080I-N cells, and cells expressing empty vector as HT1080I-C cells. After treatment with TNF (5 ng/ml) for different time periods, cells were lysed with Trizol reagent, and total RNA was isolated according to manufacturer protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). Fifteen-µg aliquots of total RNA were separated on a 1.4% agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred onto a nylon membrane, and cross-linked with a UV cross-linker. Blots were hybridized overnight with a random-primed 32P-labeled probe at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 1× 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% sodium pyrophosphate, 1% SDS, 0.25% polyvinylpyrrolidene, 0.25% Ficoll, and 5 mm EDTA, and 150 µg of denatured salmon sperm DNA. The probes were generated with a random-primed labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP (ISN) and purified with a micro G-50 Sephadex column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After hybridization, the blots were washed twice in 2× SSC/0.1% SDS for 10 min at 42 °C and twice in 0.1× SSC/0.1% SDS for 20 min at 42 °C. Blots were scanned by a PhosphorImager, and the signals were normalized with internal control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Cells were infected with adenovirus-expressing super-repressor IκBα or a control virus as described previously (16Wang C.-Y. Cusack J.C. Liu R. Baldwin A.S. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Twenty-four h after infection, the cells were treated with TNF for the indicated times. Nuclear extracts were prepared for electrophoretic mobility shift sssays as described previously (15Wang C.-Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2511) Google Scholar, 22Wang C.-Y. Guttridge D.C. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5923-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Five-µg aliquots of nuclear extracts were preincubated with 1 µg of poly(dI-dc) in binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.7, 50 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mmEDTA) for 10 min at room temperature. Approximately 20,000 cpm of 32P-labeled DNA probe containing the class I major histocompatibility complex NF-κB site (5′-CAGGGCTGGGGATTCCCCATCTCCACAGTTTCACTTC-3′) was then added, and binding proceeded for 15 min. The complexes were separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel and exposed for autoradiography (15Wang C.-Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2511) Google Scholar,22Wang C.-Y. Guttridge D.C. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5923-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Whole-cell extracts were prepared as described previously (22Wang C.-Y. Guttridge D.C. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5923-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). The extracts were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10 or 15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by a semi-dry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad). Proteins were probed with primary antibody and visualized by using an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to manufacturer instructions. For internal control, the blots were stripped with 62.5 mm Tris buffer, pH 6.8, containing 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and 2% SDS at 60 °C for 1 h and reprobed for α-tubulin (22Wang C.-Y. Guttridge D.C. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5923-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were from the following sources: Monoclonal antibodies against human caspase-8 (1:1,000), PharMingen; monoclonal antibody against α-tubulin (1:2,000), Sigma; and goat polyclonal antibody against Bid (1:1,000), R&D Systems. Cells were treated with a variety of concentrations of TNF for the indicated times, and cell viability was determined with a trypan blue exclusion assay. For the cell death enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, 5 × 105 cells were plated onto 12-well plates the day before stimulation. The cells were treated with TNF (5 ng/ml) for 6 h. Twenty-µl aliquots of supernatant were used to assess DNA fragmentation and histone release from the nucleus. These measurements were performed according to manufacturer protocol (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 5 × 104 cells were plated on microscope coverslips in 24-well plates the day before stimulation. Two-three h after TNF treatment, the cells were gently washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. After blocking with normal goat serum for 30 min, the cells were incubated with primary monoclonal antibody against cytochrome c, and immunocomplexes were detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody against mouse IgG. The coverslips were inverted on a drop of Vectashield mounting media (Fisher Scientific) on slides, examined, and photographed by a fluorescence microscope using a filter set for fluorescein isothiocyanate. NDED was originally found to be induced by ionizing irradiation and TNF in several cell lines including squamous cell carcinoma cells (SCC) (26Horrevoets A.J.G. Fontijin R.D. Zonneveld A.J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 2973-2978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Because TNF is a potent activator of NF-κB (1Darnay BG. Aggarwal B.B. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1999; 58 Suppl. 1: I2-I13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Devin A. Cook A. Lin Y. Rodriguez Y. Kelliher M. Liu Z.G.

Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5151) Google Scholar), we were interested in determining whether the induction of NDED expression depends on the activation of NF-κB. To inhibit the activation of NF-κB induced by TNF, we utilized the adenoviral delivery of a modified form of IκBα, the super-repressor of IκBα (SR-IκBα) (14Liu Z.-G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar). SR-IκBα, which contains two mutations at serines 32 and 36, cannot be phosphorylated by IκB kinase and subsequently degraded by proteasome, thereby preventing NF-κB translocation to the nucleus (16Wang C.-Y. Cusack J.C. Liu R. Baldwin A.S. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 21Chu Z.L. McKinsey T. Liu L. Gentry J. Malim M. Ballard D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10057-10062Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 A, TNF-induced nuclear translocation was totally blocked in human head and neck cancer SCC15 cells infected with adenovirus-expressing SR-IκBα (SCC15I) but not in the cells infected with control virus (SCC15V). Northern blot analysis demonstrated that NDED mRNA was rapidly induced in SCC15V cells (3-fold) but weakly in SCC15I cells (1.2-fold) 1 h after TNF stimulation, as quantified by a PhosphorImager, indicating that NDED was an early NF-κB-responsive gene (Fig. 1 B). Control blotting with glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) indicated equivalent loading for the different experimental conditions (Fig. 1 B). Previously, we established an HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cell line (HT1080I) that stably expresses SR-IκBα. This cell line, but not control cell line (HT1080V), potently suppresses NF-κB activation and is sensitive to TNF-induced apoptosis (15Wang C.-Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2511) Google Scholar). Thus, we also utilized this cell model system to determine whether the expression of NDED was regulated by NF-κB. As shown in Fig. 2, TNF stimulation in HT1080V cells also resulted in a substantial increase in the steady-state levels of NDED mRNA (3-fold within 1 h). In contrast, NDED mRNA expression was suppressed in HT1080I cells, in which NF-κB activation was inhibited by SR-IκBα. Together, these results demonstrated that TNF-induced NDED mRNA expression depended on the activation of NF-κB. Because NDED is one of the NF-κB-induced gene products, we next examined whether NDED played a role in the inhibition of TNF-mediated apoptosis. To test this, it was very important to determine whether the overexpression of NDED inhibited apoptosis in NF-κB null cells, because growing evidence suggests that some molecules can utilize the NF-κB signaling pathway to inhibit apoptosis (21Chu Z.L.

Because the apoptotic signaling pathways in the HT1080I cell model system have been well characterized (15Wang C.-Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2511) Google Scholar, 16Wang C.-Y. Cusack J.C. Liu R. Baldwin A.S. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 20Wang C.-Y.

Biol. 1999; 19: 5923-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), this model was utilized to determine whether the restoration of NDED inhibited TNF-mediated apoptosis under conditions of inactivation of NF-κB. HT1080I cells were stably transfected with the expression vector for NDED or an empty vector as control. Ten positive clones expressing NDED were identified and pooled as HT1080I-N cells based on their level of protein expression. The antibiotic-resistant clones, which expressed empty vector, were pooled and designated as control HT1080I-C cells (Fig. 3 A). As shown in Fig. 3, B and C, HT1080I-C cells were killed after TNF stimulation in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In contrast, cell death in HT1080I-N cells induced by TNF was potently inhibited by the expression of NDED. Both DNA fragmentation assay and annexin V staining confirmed that TNF-mediated killing depended on the mechanism of apoptosis in this cell model system as described previously (data not shown). These results demonstrated that under an NF-κB null condition, the overexpression of NDED was capable of inhibiting TNF-induced apoptosis, suggesting that NDED is an authentic NF-κB-induced antiapoptotic molecule. The caspase-8 inhibitor, c-FLIP, also called I-FLICE, FLAME-1, casper, Clarp, or CASH, has been found to inhibit TNF- and Fas-mediated apoptosis (30Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K.

Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Steiner V. Bodmer J. Schroter M. Burns K. Mattmann C. Rimoldi D. French L.E. Tschopp J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 1541-1548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Because NDED contains a DED domain, we first determined whether NDED, similar to c-FLIP, could block the processing of caspase-8 induced by TNF. As shown in Fig.4 A, the kinetics of the processing of procaspase-8 was identical in both HT1080I-N and HT1080I-C cells after TNF stimulation, as detected by the Western blot analysis. The result suggested that, unlike c-FLIP, NDED functioned downstream to caspase-8 processing. Because we could not detect cleavage of caspase-8 in our cell model system by using the Western blot assay (20Wang C.-Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2578) Google Scholar, 22Wang C.-Y. Guttridge D.C. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5923-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), the caspase-8 activity assay was assessed directly to examine whether NDED modulated TNF-induced active caspase-8 enzymatic activity using specific caspase-8 substrate. Surprisingly, despite the fact that caspase-8 was processed with similar kinetics in both HT1080I-C and HT1080I-N cells, the activity of caspase-8 was potently suppressed in HT1080I-N cells but not in HT1080I-C cells after TNF treatment (Fig. 4 B). A proapoptotic family member of Bcl-2, Bid, has been found to be a specific substrate of caspase-8 during TNF- and Fas-mediated apoptosis (6Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.-J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3787) Google Scholar, 7Luo X. Budihardji I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3078) Google Scholar). The truncated Bid promotes and/or amplifies apoptosis by inducing the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol (6Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.-J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3787) Google Scholar, 7Luo X. Budihardji I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3078) Google Scholar). To confirm that caspase-8 activity was inhibited by NDED, we compared the cleavage of Bid in HT1080I-N with HT1080I-C cells. As shown in Fig.4 C, the cleavage of Bid was significantly blocked in HT1080I-N cells compared with HT1080I-C cells, indicating that caspase-8 activity was suppressed. (Fig. 4 B). We also examined the distribution of cytochrome c by immunofluorescence staining. As shown in Fig. 4 D, untreated cells exhibited a punctate cytoplasmic staining of cytochromec, indicating mitochondrial localization. In contrast, TNF-treated HT1080I-C cells but not HT1080I-N cells exhibited very diffuse staining patterns in the entire cells, indicating that the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol was inhibited in HT1080I-N cells. In addition to the cleavage of Bid, caspase-8 can also directly process executing caspases such as caspase-3 to induce apoptosis (3Ashkenazi A. Dixit V. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5151) Google Scholar, 9Green D. Reed J. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we also examined whether the activation of caspase-3 was affected by the inhibition of caspase-8. As shown in Fig.5, the processing of caspase-3 was partially inhibited by NDED after TNF treatment in HT1080I-N cells but not in HT1080I-C cells. Consistent with this, the cleavage of DNA fragmentation factor (DFF) 45, a caspase-3 substrate, was significantly inhibited by the overexpression of NDED in HT1080I-N cells but not in HT1080-C cells after TNF treatment. The cleavage of DFF-45 leads to the release and activation of DFF-40 to induce DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation (38Liu X. Li P. Widlak P. Zou H. Luo X. Garrard W.T. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8461-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). At the late stage of apoptosis, the cell membrane is broken, and the fragmented DNA induced by DFF-40 is released to the cell culture medium, which can be detected by the cell death enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (22Wang C.-Y. Guttridge D.C. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5923-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5 C, after TNF stimulation there was significantly less DNA fragmentation and histone release in HT1080I-N cells compared with that from HT1080I-C cells. The results described above strongly suggested that NDED inhibited apoptosis by inhibiting caspase-8 activity. However, it was possible that NDED might also inhibit other caspases and/or apoptotic signaling. According to our current model, there are two primary pathways to induce apoptosis (3Ashkenazi A. Dixit V. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5151) Google Scholar, 9Green D. Reed J. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One is mediated by the death receptors such as TNFRI, which is caspase-8-dependent. Another is activated by stress inducers such as the chemotherapeutic drug etoposide or ionizing radiation. These inducers stimulate the release of cytochromec and sequentially activate caspase-9 and caspase-3 to induce apoptosis, which is independent of caspase-8 activation (3Ashkenazi A. Dixit V. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5151) Google Scholar,9Green D. Reed J. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using the HT1080 cell model system, we previously confirmed that etoposide-mediated apoptosis was independent of caspase-8 (22Wang C.-Y. Guttridge D.C. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5923-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Thus, by examining whether NDED inhibited etoposide-mediated apoptosis, we could determine whether NDED also inhibited other caspase activity and/or apoptotic signaling pathway. Both HT1080I-N and HT1080I-C cells were treated with etoposide for 24–48 h, and cell viability was assessed. As shown in Fig. 6 A, the same degree of cell death was induced in both HT1080I-C and HT1080I-N cells after etoposide stimulation, indicating that the overexpression of NDED could not suppress etoposide-mediated apoptosis. Consistent with our previous observation, caspase-8 activity was not induced in either HT1080I-N or HT1080I-C cells (Fig. 6 B). Most importantly, caspase-3 activity was equivalently induced in both HT1080I-N and HT1080I-C cells by etoposide, indicating that NDED did not suppress caspase-3 activity (Fig. 6 C). Taken together, the results suggest that NDED specifically inhibited TNF-mediated but not etoposide-mediated apoptosis by suppressing caspase-8 activity. Our results presented here demonstrate that NDED is a novel NF-κB-inducible antiapoptotic molecule. Because NDED inhibited TNF-mediated apoptosis by inhibiting caspase-8 activity but did not suppress etoposide-mediated apoptosis, it is likely that NDED specifically inhibited TNF-induced caspase-8 activation but not other caspase cascades. Previous studies indicated that NF-κB-regulated antiapoptotic genes inhibited TNF-mediated apoptosis at two steps in the caspase cascades (20Wang C.-Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2578) Google Scholar, 22Wang C.-Y. Guttridge D.C. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5923-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). By the induction of TNFR-associated factors 1 and 2 and cellular inhibitors of apoptosis 1 and 2, NF-κB suppresses the TNF-induced processing of caspase-8 (20Wang C.-Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2578) Google Scholar, 21Chu Z.L. McKinsey T. Liu L. Gentry J. Malim M. Ballard D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10057-10062Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). By induction of the Bcl-2 family protein A1, NF-κB suppresses TNF-mediated mitochondrial damage and cytochrome c release (22Wang C.-Y. Guttridge D.C. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5923-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 24Zong W. Edelstein L.C. Chen C. Bash J. Gélinas C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 382-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Interestingly, overexpression of these genes could not fully suppress TNF-mediated apoptosis. The effect of NDED on the inhibition of the active caspase-8 activity would seem to complement NF-κB-regulated antiapoptotic molecules during NF-κB-mediated suppression of TNF-mediated apoptosis (20Wang C.-Y.

Both caspase-8 and FADD have been found to play an essential role in TNF- and Fas-mediated apoptosis. In the early stage of Fas-mediated apoptosis, the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) is formed, resulting in the cleavage and activation of caspase-8 (3Ashkenazi A. Dixit V. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5151) Google Scholar, 4Boldin M.P. Goncharov M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D.

Cell. 1996; 85: 817-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2741) Google Scholar). c-FLIP has been found to bind with FADD and caspase-8 and to interfere with DISC formation and the processing of caspase-8 (30Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Steiner V. Bodmer J. Schroter M. Burns K. Mattmann C. Rimoldi D. French L.E. Tschopp J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 1541-1548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). However, under physiological conditions, DISC formation could not be detected in TNF-mediated apoptosis. This may have been caused by transient interaction between caspase-8 and FADD (3Ashkenazi A. Dixit V. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5151) Google Scholar, 20Wang C.-Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin A.S.

Immunity. 1997; 6: 751-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). For this reason, we were unable to determine whether NDED inhibited DISC formation and activation in TNF-mediated apoptosis. Because NDED could not block the processing of caspase-8, it suggests that NDED inhibited caspase-8 activation downstream of DISC formation. Currently, we do not know how NDED inhibits caspase-8 activity. From the recruitment of caspase-8 to the receptor, to the processing of caspase-8, and to activation of caspase-8 in vivo, many signaling molecules are involved. Recently, for example, the Ced-4-homologous protein, FLASH, has been found to play a critical role in caspase-8 activation (39Imai Y. Kimura T. Murakami A. Yajima N. Sakamaki K. Yonehara S. Nature. 1999; 398: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Despite considerable efforts, our co-immunoprecipitation studies could not detect NDED interacting with caspase-8 and FADD. This result may be because of the transient interaction between the active caspase-8 and NDED, or because of the fact that active caspase-8-NDED complexes may be very unstable and could not be pulled down under the conditions for co-immunoprecipitation that we utilized. In fact, although the FADD-caspase-8 interaction induced by Fas was readily detected by immunoprecipitation, thus far we and others (20Wang C.-Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2578) Google Scholar, 33Shu H. Halpin D.R. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1997; 6: 751-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) have been unable to detect the FADD and caspase-8 interaction after TNF stimulation. Interestingly, we found that NDED immunoprecipitated a 35-kDa protein, the molecular weight of which was larger than that of FADD, but reacted with a monoclonal antibody against the FADD death domain. 2Z. You and C.-Y. Wang, unpublished observation. NDED might collaborate with this molecule to inhibit caspase-8 activity. However, it also is possible that this unidentified molecule may be involved in caspase-8 activation and is a potential inhibitory target for NDED. Finally, given the fact that several DED-containing proteins have been found to play a role in signal transduction (2Devin A. Cook A. Lin Y. Rodriguez Y. Kelliher M. Liu Z.G. Immunity. 2000; 12: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 3Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.

Elevated expression of c-FLIP has been linked recently to the escape of tumors from immune surveillance (41Medema J.P. Jong J.D. van Hall T. Melief C.J.M. Offringa R. J. Exp.

Med. 1998; 188: 1717-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The ectopic expression of c-FLIP in a Moloney murine leukemia virus-induced lymphoma was sufficient to allow tumor cells to escape from T cell-dependent immunity in vivo and in vitro. Murine B lymphoma cells transduced with c-FLIP rapidly develop into aggressive tumors, showing a high rate of survival and growth (43Djerbi M. Screpanti V. Irinel A. Catrina A.I. Bogen B. Biberfeld P. Grandien A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1025-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The tumor-progressive activity of c-FLIP is mediated by the prevention of the death receptor-induced apoptosis triggered by conventional T cells. These observations suggest that death receptor signaling pathways may play an important role in controlling tumorigenesis and tumor progression (44French L.E. Tschopp J. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 891-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). There is growing evidence that NF-κB is associated with oncogenic transformation by providing an antiapoptotic function (28Madrid L.V. Wang C.-Y. Guttridge D.C. Schottelius A.J.G. Baldwin A.S.

Constitutive activation of NF-κB has been found in several human tumors including Hodgkin's lymphoma, prostate cancer, and breast cancer (46Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S. Biochim. Biophys.

Because NDED is regulated by NF-κB, it will be very interesting to examine the expression level of NDED in NF-κB-related tumors. Elevated NDED, like c-FLIP, may promote tumor progression and plays a critical role in the escape of tumors from immune surveillance by inhibiting death receptor-mediated apoptosis."

Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 435-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). One such tissue is the airway of the lung, where neuroepithelial bodies (NEBs) are believed to be involved in optimizing ventilation-perfusion matching via both local vasoconstriction and ascending input to medullary respiratory centers (3Cutz E. Jackson A. Respir. Physiol. 1999; 115: 201-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). At the cellular level, NEBs have been shown to express O2-sensitive K+ channels (4Youngson C. Nurse C. Yeger H. Cutz E. Nature. 1993; 365: 153-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), which are functionally coupled to a membrane-associated O2 sensor, the multicomponent enzyme NADPH oxidase (5Fu X.W. Wang D.

Although details of the mechanism responsible for transducing reduced pO2 into the full physiological response of hypoxia-evoked transmitter release are steadily emerging, the molecular identity of the O2-sensitive K+channel responsible for hypoxia-induced cell depolarization is still uncertain. To study this signal transduction pathway more completely at the molecular level, we have recently established an immortalized cellular model for NEB cells (6O'Kelly I. Lewis A. Peers C. Kemp P.J. J.

Physiol. 1999; 115: 201-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), which are released in response to hypoxia (11Lauweryns J.M. Cokeleare M. Z. Zellforsch. Mikrosk. Anat. 1973; 145: 521-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Based on in situ hybridization and Northern blot analyses, it has been suggested that in native neonatal rabbit NEB cells, Kv3.3 may be involved in O2 transduction (10Wang D. Youngson C. Wong V. Yeger H. Dinauer M.C. Vega-Saenz de Miera E. Rudy B. Cutz E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13182-13187Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). This channel has also been identified in small cell lung carcinoma cell lines (including H146) at the mRNA level. Kv3.3 expressed in Xenopusoocytes has been shown to be sensitive to a downstream product of NADPH oxidase activity, H2O2 (10Wang D. Youngson C. Wong V. Yeger H. Dinauer M.C. Vega-Saenz de Miera E. Rudy B. Cutz E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13182-13187Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). However, this channel has not been shown to influence resting membrane potential, and other cell types (e.g. carotid body glomus cells) are known to possess multiple O2-sensitive K+ channels (12Buckler K.J.

Therefore, although Kv3.3 may indeed be an O2-sensitive K+ channel, there are a number of lines of evidence (physiological, molecular, pharmacological and comparative) to suggest that hypoxia-evoked depolarization, and hence the physiologically more important response, may be underpinned by closure of a member of the tandem P domain K+ channel family (K2P), namely the acid-sensitive TASK gene product. These lines of evidence include 1) our earlier observation of differential amplification of mRNA encoding hTASK1 (over hTWIK1) from H146 cells by RT-PCR (7O'Kelly I. Stephens R.H. Peers C. Kemp P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L96-L104PubMed Google Scholar); 2) the observation that rTASK1 mRNA has been detected by in situ hybridization and implicated in O2 signal transduction in another important O2sensing tissue, the carotid body (12Buckler K.J. Williams B.A. Honore E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 525: 135-142Crossref Scopus (364) Google Scholar); 3) hypoxia-evoked cell depolarization in H146 cells is almost insensitive to the broad spectrum K+ channel blocker tetraethylammonium (TEA) at concentrations well above those documented to inhibit most voltage-sensitive K+ channels, including Kv3.3 (8O'Kelly I. Peers C. Kemp P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L709-L716PubMed Google Scholar); and 4) O2-sensitive K+ currents of H146 cells (as well as hypoxia-evoked cell depolarization in this cell model), isolated NEB cells, and NEB cells in lung slice are 4-aminopyridine-insensitive but completely blocked by quinidine (7O'Kelly I. Stephens R.H. Peers C. Kemp P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L96-L104PubMed Google Scholar). Because K2P channels are known to be active at (and so be major determinants of) resting membrane potential (14Duprat F. Lesage F. Fink M. Reyes R. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5464-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), they are attractive candidate channels that could link to NADPH oxidase in both NEBs (5Fu X.W. Wang D. Nurse C. Dinauer M.C. Cutz E. Proc. Natl. Acac. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4374-4379Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and small cell lung carcinoma cells (6O'Kelly I. Lewis A. Peers C. Kemp P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7684-7692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, our previous suggestion that hTASK was the O2-sensitive channel in H146 cells can be criticized on the basis of our initial failure to demonstrate pH sensitivity of the K+ current (7O'Kelly I. Stephens R.H. Peers C. Kemp P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L96-L104PubMed Google Scholar). In our initial studies, we conducted all pH dependence experiments in the presence of Cd2+ in order to remove any Ca2+-activated K+ current contamination from the whole cell conductance recordings. However, interpretation of these data is confounded by the suggestion that there is competition between Cd2+ and H+ when binding to a number of different channel types, including Cl− (15Rychkov G.Y. Astill D.S. Bennetts B. Hughes B.P. Bretag A.H. Roberts M.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 501: 355-362Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and K+ channels (16Stengl M. Carmeliet E. Mubagwa K. Flameng W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 511: 827-836Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To investigate this possibility in H146 cells, we have revisited the pH sensitivity of their whole-cell currents and demonstrated that in the absence of external Cd2+, the O2-sensitive K+ current is indeed depressed by lowering pH, consistent with TASK contributing significantly to O2 sensing in these cells. To date, many investigations have concentrated on cloning and characterizing tandem P-domain channels in recombinant systems (seee.g. Refs. 14Duprat F. Lesage F. Fink M. Reyes R. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5464-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar and 17Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Barhanin J.

(Lond.). 2000; 525: 135-142Crossref Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 21Millar J.A. Barratt L. Southan A.P. Page K.M. Fyffe R.E. Robertson B. Mathie A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3614-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) has been made in demonstrating directly the involvement of this emerging class of ion channels in cell physiological function of tissues or cells. To this end, and to test directly the hypothesis that hTASK is an O2-sensitive K+ channel in this model cell line (and, by inference, in NEB cells), we have used RT-PCR to screen for K2P channel mRNA and employed antisense oligodeoxynucleotides as a method by which to reduce/block hTASK transcription/translation. These data, in combination with a sequential pharmacological approach using compounds that can discriminate between different members of the K2P class of channels specifically, and other K+ channels in general, indicate hTASK3 is the O2-sensitive K+ channel in this model for airway chemoreceptors and represents a significant advance in our understanding of the molecular basis of ion channel O2sensing. The small cell lung carcinoma cell line, H146, was purchased from American Tissue Type Cell Collection (Manassas, VA) and was maintained in culture using the same regimen as previously described (6O'Kelly I. Lewis A. Peers C. Kemp P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7684-7692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from pelleted H146 cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Crawley, West Sussex, United Kingdom) and treated with RQ-1 RNase-free DNase (1 units·µg−1 RNA; Promega, Southampton, Hampshire, United Kingdom) to remove genomic DNA contamination, before reextraction using the RNeasy mini kit. The yield, purity, and integrity of the RNA was verified by spectrophotometry at 260/280 nm, followed by electrophoresis on 1% agarose, and high quality RNA was then stored in aqueous solution at −80 °C. Reverse transcription was performed on 1-µg aliquots of RNA using the reverse transcription system A3500 (Promega), comprising avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT) (15Rychkov G.Y. Astill D.S. Bennetts B. Hughes B.P. Bretag A.H. Roberts M.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 501: 355-362Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar) primers (42 °C, 15 min). The resulting cDNA was amplified by PCR using a panel of oligonucleotide primer pairs (described in Fig. 2 B) designed against the published sequences of the human homologues of TASK1 (GenBankTM accession number AF006823), TASK2 (AF084830), TASK3 (AC007869), TREK1 (AF004711), TREK2 (XM012342), TWIK1 (U90065), TWIK2 (AF117708), and TRAAK (XM006543). Amplification of 1 µl of cDNA (equivalent to 160 ng of reverse-transcribed RNA) was performed using a Hybaid Express thermal cycler (Ashford, Middlesex, United Kingdom), in a volume of 50 µl, containing 1 µl of Advantage-GC2 polymerase (Promega), under optimized conditions. The hot-start PCR protocol was 94 °C for 1 min, X °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min for 35 cycles with a final extension period of 10 min at 72 °C. Optimized anealling temperatures (X °C) were gene-specific and are shown in Fig.2 B. Products were separated on 2% agarose gels and visualized with ethidium bromide/UV transillumination. Sequencing of all amplicons was carried out by dye terminator PCR with an ABI PRISM automated sequencer (School of Biology, University of Leeds, United Kingdom) and allowed verification of the identity of each PCR product. H146 cells were transfected with either 1) LipofectAMINE only, 2) 5′-FITC-labeled, phosphothioate-modified antisense (sequence 5′-cgttctgccgcttcatcg-3′; Genosys Biotechnologies, Pampisford, Cambridge, United Kingdom) directed across the translation start site of human TASK1 and TASK3, or 3) 5′-FITC-labeled, phosphothioate-modified missense (sequence 5′-gccgtctatcttcgcgct-3′; Genosys Biotechnologies), which consisted of the same bases as employed in the antisense probe but in “random” order (see Fig.2 C). We confirmed, by PCR and sequencing, that the first 115 base pairs of H146 cell hTASK1 and the first 125 base pairs of hTASK3 open reading frames were 100% identical to the published sequences. This allowed the design of an antisense deoxynucleotide probe that spanned the atg start codon of both sequences (nucleotides 123–126 of TASK1 and 94–97 of TASK3), a region of the gene known to be a useful target functionally for antisense maneuvers in other systems (see Ref. 22Neckers L. Whitesell L. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: L1-L12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar for a review of technical considerations). TASK1 and TASK3 exhibit high sequence identity that made design of an antisense probe specific for each of these genes impossible. Therefore, the probe that we employed in this study did not distinguish between TASK1 and TASK3; thus, a functional approach was combined with this molecular abrogation technique for final channel identification. The missense sequence did not recognize any known sequences available in GenBankTM. Cells were seeded in six-well plates at a density of 2 × 106 cells/well in 0.8 ml of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). The oligodeoxynucleotides were diluted in 0.1 ml of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium and mixed with 0.1 ml of 6% (v/v) LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium. The resulting oligodeoxynucleotide and cationic lipid mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min to allow formation of DNA-liposome complexes, which were then added (0.2 ml) to the cell suspension, mixed gently, and incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5%CO2/95% air at 37 °C for 4 h. Following incubation, 4 ml of complete RPMI 1640 medium (8O'Kelly I. Peers C. Kemp P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L709-L716PubMed Google Scholar) was added to each well. Cells were then cultured as normal for up to 5 days. The concentrations and time course of transfection were followed by measuring cellular/nuclear FITC fluorescence incorporation and were shown to be optimal at 1 µm and 4–5 days, respectively (data not shown). Four to 5 days after lipofection, H146 cells (approximately 5 × 105 cells) were cytospun onto glass poly-l-lysine-coated microscope slides for 5 min at 1200 rpm. Cells were heat-fixed by placing the slides on a hot plate for 10 s and then fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for 5 min at 37 °C. The remaining procedures were carried out at room temperature. Cells were permeabilized by incubation with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min, refixed in 10% formalin for 5 min, washed in PBS for 10 min, and then incubated with blocking solution (10% v/v fetal calf serum, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 0.01% (w/v) NaN3 in PBS) for 1 h. Cells were then incubated overnight in 1:500 dilution of rabbit anti-hTASK1 antibody (Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel) in blocking solution. Following the antibody incubation, cells were washed three times in PBS and incubated in TRITC-labeled anti-rabbit antiserum for 3 h. Finally, cells were washed an additional three times in PBS prior to mounting and viewing. Specificity of immunoreactivity was confirmed by an antigen preadsorption step using the peptide to which the antibody was originally raised. The preadsorption step employed 1.2 µg of peptide per 1 ml of diluted antibody and was carried out for 1 h at room temperature. TASK3 antibodies are not commercially available. Unless stated otherwise, all chemicals for whole-cell patch-clamp were of the highest grade available and were purchased from Sigma. Pipette solution was K+-rich and contained 10 mm NaCl, 117 mm KCl, 2 mm MgSO4, 10 mm HEPES, 11 mm EGTA, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm Na2ATP, pH 7.2, with KOH; free [Ca2+] = 27 nm. Bath solution was Na+-rich and contained 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mmd-glucose, pH 7.4, with NaOH. In the pH dependence experiments, solutions were brought to the appropriate pH (6.0 or 7.4) using NaOH, and the bath electrode was embedded in a 3m KCl/3% agarose bridge in order to minimize junction potentials; these were routinely measured and never exceeded 0.3 mV for the maneuvers presented here. All tubing was gas-impermeant (Tygon tubing, BDH, Atherstone, Berkshire, United Kingdom). Normoxic solutions were equilibrated with room air. Solutions were made hypoxic, where appropriate, by bubbling with N2 (g) for at least 20 min prior to perfusion of cells. This procedure produced no shift in pH. Solution flow rate was approximately 5–7 ml·min−1. pO2 was measured (at the cell) using a polarized (–800 mV), calibrated carbon fiber electrode (23Mojet M.H. Mills E. Duchen M.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 504: 175-189Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar); for the experiments reported herein, the pO2 values were 150 (normoxia) and 15–25 (hypoxia) mm Hg. Cells were allowed to adhere at 37 °C for at least 1 h to poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips before being placed in a perfusion chamber mounted on the stage of either a Nikon TMS or a Oympus CK40 inverted microscope. All experiments were carried out at 22 ± 1 °C. Patch pipettes were manufactured from standard-walled borosilicate glass capillary tubing (Clarke Electromedical Instruments, Reading, Berkshire, United Kingdom) on a two-stage Narishige PP-83 pipette puller (Narishige Scientific Instrument Laboratory, Kasuya, Tokyo, Japan), were heat-polished on a Narishige microforge, and had measured tip resistances of 5–8 MΩ (when filled with K+-rich pipette solution). Resistive feedback voltage-clamp was achieved using an Axopatch 200 A amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Voltage protocols were generated and currents were recorded using pClamp 6.0.5 or pClamp 8 software employing Digidata 1200 or 1310 A/D converters (Axon Instruments). Data were filtered (4-pole Bessel) at 1 kHz and digitized at 5 kHz. Following successful transition to the whole-cell recording mode (24Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15061) Google Scholar), capacitance transients were compensated for and measured. To evoke ionic currents in H146 cells, a ramp voltage protocol was used (Vh = –70 mV, 0.1 Hz) as shown in Fig. 1 A. The magnitude of the steady-state outward currents was measured from the 0 mV step, and current-voltage relationships were constructed from the ramp. Statistical comparisons were made using the paired or unpaired Student's t test, as appropriate, with p < 0.05 being considered significant. Fig.1 A shows exemplar currents elicited in voltage-clamped H146 cells during the ramp voltage protocol (shown below) before and during reduction in bath pO2 from 150 mm Hg to between 15 and 25 mm Hg. This response is consistent with our earlier observations of hypoxic K+ current suppression in this cell line (6O'Kelly I. Lewis A. Peers C. Kemp P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7684-7692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 7O'Kelly I. Stephens R.H. Peers C. Kemp P.J. Am. J.

Sensitivity to blockade of currents by the broad spectrum K+ channel inhibitor, TEA, is a maneuver capable of discriminating between specific K+ channels. For instance, members of the shaw K+ channel family (which includes Kv3.3) are highly sensitive to the actions of TEA and characteristically are blocked maximally by 1 mm(25Rashid A.J. Morales E. Turner R.W. Dunn R.J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 125-135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Rudy B. Chow A. Lau D. Amarillo Y. Ozaita A. Saganich M. Moreno H. Nadal M.S. Hernandez-Pineda R.

Sci. 1999; 868: 304-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), whereas TASK channels are essentially unaffected at this concentration (14Duprat F. Lesage F. Fink M. Reyes R. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5464-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 27Reyes R. Duprat F. Lesage F. Fink M. Salinas M. Farman N. Lazdunski M. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that hypoxic depolarization in current-clamped H146 cells is unaffected by 10 mm TEA (8O'Kelly I. Peers C. Kemp P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L709-L716PubMed Google Scholar) and extend this observation to cells under voltage-clamp. 1 mm TEA caused 30.9 ± 7.2% (n = 10) inhibition of the total K+ current (consistent with the concentration-response data that we have previously reported (8O'Kelly I. Peers C. Kemp P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L709-L716PubMed Google Scholar)). In the continuing presence of 1 mm TEA, hypoxic depression of the K+ current was not significantly different from that in the absence of inhibitor (Fig. 1, A and B). This is quantified in the correlation plot of Fig. 1 C, where the mean hypoxia-sensitive currents were 20.1 ± 5.8 pA in control solution and 15.9 ± 5.0 pA in 1 mm TEA (p > 0.15, n = 10). This observation essentially discounts the possibility that the TEA-sensitive Kv3.3 is a significant O2-sensitive K+ channel under these experimental circumstances in this cell line. Relative insensitivity to TEA (shown here) and 4-aminopyridine (shown in Ref. 7O'Kelly I. Stephens R.H. Peers C. Kemp P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L96-L104PubMed Google Scholar), significant blockade by quinidine (also shown in Ref. 7O'Kelly I. Stephens R.H. Peers C. Kemp P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L96-L104PubMed Google Scholar) and activity at resting membrane potential (shown in Ref. 8O'Kelly I. Peers C. Kemp P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L709-L716PubMed Google Scholar) are all hallmarks of K2P channels; therefore, before further characterization of the current was attempted, RT-PCR screening for expression of mRNAs encoding all human K2P channels thus far cloned (with the exception of very recently identified TASK4 (29Decher N. Maier M. Dittrich W. Gassenhuber J. Bruggemann A. Busch A.E. Steinmeyer K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), TASK5 KT3.3 (accession numbers AF336342 and AF257081, respectively) and THIK (30Rajan S. Wischmeyer E. Karschin C. Preisig-Muller R. Grzeschik K.H. Daut J. Karschin A. Derst C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16650-16657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar)) was conducted. Employing primer pairs (Fig.2 B) directed against the published sequences of human K2P channels (TWIK1 and 2, TASK1, 2 and 3, TREK1 and 2, and TRAAK), only hTWIK1 and hTRAAK were not amplified from RQ1-treated, reverse-transcribed H146 cell mRNA (Fig. 2 A). This confirms our earlier observation of hTASK1 expression and extends the number of amplifiable K2Pchannels in this cell line to six. Verification of the PCR protocols for TRAAK and TWIK1 was demonstrated by the positive control lanes using uncleaned (therefore, genomic DNA- contaminated) reverse-transcribed mRNA (see Fig. 2 A, TWIK1 genomic and TRAAK genomic). All products were confirmed by sequencing. To date, two members of the K2P channels (TREK and TASK) have been shown to be activated by volatile anesthetics (31Maingret F. Patel A.J. Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Honore E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26691-26696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) and such activation may be a hallmark response of this channel family. Fig.3 A shows that during exposure of cells to hypoxia, 1 mm halothane was able to rescue the K+ currents from hypoxic inhibition (n = 7 cells), albeit transiently. The time course of current enhancement by halothane is reminiscent of the effect of another potent activator of K+ currents in H146 cells, namely H2O2 (6O'Kelly I. Lewis A. Peers C. Kemp P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7684-7692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In order to refine the evidence for involvement of specific K2P channels, we employed two further pharmacological maneuvers. First, the effects of arachidonic acid were investigated. Arachidonic acid stimulates TREK1, TREK2, TASK2, and TRAAK; is without effect on TWIK1; and inhibits TASK1 and TASK3 (see Ref. 32Lesage, F., and Lazdunski, M. (2000) Am. J. Physiol., 793.Google Scholar for a recent review). The data presented in Fig.3 B show clearly that bath application of 20 µmarachidonic acid causes profound whole-cell current inhibition (of 59.9 ± 7.5%, n = 6) and completely abolishes the hypoxia-induced depression of currents normally observed in these cells. All K2P channels except TASKs have a conserved cysteine in the P1-M2 extracellular linker (32Lesage, F., and Lazdunski, M. (2000) Am. J. Physiol., 793.Google Scholar), and it has been firmly established (at least for TWIK) that functional dimerization through the disulfide bridge formation at this residue is imperative for full channel activity (18Lesage F. Reyes R. Fink M. Duprat R. Guillemare E. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6400-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). It follows, therefore, that treatment of cells with a potent reducing agent should perturb the function of all K2P channels except that of TASKs. Fig. 3 Cdemonstrates that although 1 mm DTT causes partial inhibition of the whole-cell K+ current, the hypoxia-evoked current suppression is not significantly altered (hypoxic inhibition = 26.7 ± 6.2% in the absence of DTTversus 31.3 ± 3.5% in the presence of DTT;n = 6, p > 0.5). The evidence presented above further reinforces our earlier suggestion that TASK is an O2-sensitive K+ channel in these cells. However, our previous failure to demonstrate pH sensitivity of the K+ current may have been due, as in other channel types, to competition between Cd2+ and H+ at the pH-sensitive domain. The data in Fig. 4address this possibility and show that, indeed, in the absence of external Cd2+, K+ currents are suppressed in pH 6.0 by 17.5 ± 5.8% (Fig. 6, A and B). Importantly, there was a high correlation between the pH-sensitive current and the O2-sensitiv"

It was proved recently that they are glycosyltransferases that initiate elongation of O-linked fucose residues attached to epidermal growth factor-like sequence repeats in the extracellular domain of Notch molecules. Here we demonstrate the existence of functional diversity among the mammalian fringe proteins. Although both manic fringe (mFng) and lunatic fringe (lFng) decreased the binding of Jagged1 to Notch2 and not that of Delta1, the decrease by mFng was greater in degree than that by lFng. We also found that both fringe proteins reduced Jagged1-triggered Notch2 signaling, whereas neither affected Delta1-triggered Notch2 signaling. However, the decrease in Jagged1-triggered Notch2 signaling by mFng was again greater than that by lFng. Furthermore, we observed that each fringe protein acted on a different site of the extracellular region of Notch2. Taking these findings together, we propose that the difference in modulatory function of multiple fringe proteins may result from the distinct amino acid sequence specificity targeted by these glycosyltransferases.

An important structural characteristic of these is the common presence of multiple repeats of epidermal growth factor (EGF1)-like sequence in the extracellular domain.

In higher vertebrates, three fringe proteins, manic fringe (mFng), lunatic fringe (lFng), and radical fringe (rFng) have been identified (22Cohen B. Bashirullah A. Dagnino L. Campbell C. Fisher W.W. Leow C.C. Whiting E. Ryan D. Zinyk D. Boulianne G. Hui C.C. Gallie B. Phillips R.A. Lipshitz H.D. Egan S.E. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 26Johnston S.H. Rauskolb C. Wilson R. Prabhakaran B. Irvine K.D. Vogt T.F. Development. 1997; 124: 2245-2254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mammalian fringe proteins modulate Notch signaling when expressed inDrosophila (26Johnston S.H. Rauskolb C. Wilson R. Prabhakaran B. Irvine K.D. Vogt T.F. Development. 1997; 124: 2245-2254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and lFng null mouse phenotypes are similar to those described for mice deficient in components of the Notch signaling pathway (27Evrard Y.A. Lun Y. Aulehla A. Gan L. Johnson R.L. Nature. 1998; 394: 377-381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Zhang N. Gridley T. Nature. 1998; 394: 374-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). A weak sequence similarity shared byDrosophila fringe and a class of bacterial glycosyltransferases predicted that fringe proteins might be a glycosyltransferase (29Yuan Y.P. Schultz J. Mlodzik M. Bork P. Cell. 1997; 88: 9-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In a recent work, it was proven experimentally that Drosophila and mammalian fringe proteins have a fucose-specific β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity that catalyzes the elongation of O-linked fucose on the EGF repeats of Notch (30Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J. Shao L. Wilson R. Wang Y. Stanley P. Irvine K.D. Haltiwanger R.S. Vogt T.F. Nature. 2000; 406: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar, 31Bruckner K. Peruz L. Clausen H. Cohen S. Nature. 2000; 406: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). However, it has not been determined whether these fringe proteins act in a distinct manner on the Notch molecules, and if they do, how the difference is generated. In this study, we report functional diversity between mFng and lFng, namely a difference in their abilities to modulate Jagged1 binding to Notch2 and in the ligand-triggered Notch2 signaling. Of interest, we also found that the two fringe proteins modify different sites in Notch2, implying that each fringe specifies the multiple putative consensus sequences for O-linked fucose glycosylation in the extracellular region of Notch2. Soluble DSL proteins (sD1-Fc and sJ1-Fc) were prepared as described previously (32Shimizu K. Chiba S. Hosoya N. Kumano K. Saito T. Kurokawa M. Kanda Y. Hamada Y. Hirai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6913-6922Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Binding of each soluble DSL protein to the surface of the pro-B cell line BaF3 was performed as describedpreviously (13Shimizu K. Chiba S. Kumano K. Hosoya N. Takahashi T. Kanda Y. Hamada Y. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32961-32969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 × 105 BaF3 cells were incubated with 6.7 nm soluble DSL-Fc proteins in a cell-binding buffer (PBS containing 2% fetal bovine serum, 100 µg/ml CaCl2, and 0.05% NaN3) at 37 °C after blocking with 5 µl of rabbit serum. After a 10-min incubation, the cells were washed three times with the cell-binding buffer and further incubated with a phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated anti-human IgG antibody. The cells then were analyzed using FACScaliber (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems). Coprecipitation experiments using the soluble DSL proteins were performed as described previously (32Shimizu K. Chiba S. Hosoya N. Kumano K. Saito T. Kurokawa M. Kanda Y. Hamada Y. Hirai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6913-6922Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Each soluble DSL-Fc (6.7 nm) was allowed to bind to 1 × 107 BaF3 cells in a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 100 µg/ml CaCl2. Disuccinyl glutarate (Pierce), a cross-linking reagent, was then added to the soluble DSL-Fc-bound BaF3 at a final concentration of 20 µm followed by further incubation for 30 min at room temperature. After the cross-linking reaction, the cells were solubilized in a TNE buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 5 µg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm EDTA for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysates were precipitated with protein G beads. The transient reporter assay was performed as described previously (32Shimizu K. Chiba S. Hosoya N. Kumano K. Saito T. Kurokawa M. Kanda Y. Hamada Y. Hirai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6913-6922Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Chinese hamster ovary ras clone-1 (CHO(r)) cells with or without exogenous full-length Notch2 (N2) were inoculated at 3 × 104 in a 24-well plate and transfected with a TP1-luciferase reporter plasmid, pGa986–1, by a liposome-based method (SuperFect, Qiagen). After transfection, the cells were co-cultured for 40 h with 5 × 104 of the parental or full-length DSL protein-expressing CHO(r) cell lines. Luciferase activity in the mixture of CHO(r) cells then was measured using a luminometer. Recently, we showed that soluble Jagged1 (sJ1-Fc) binds less efficiently than soluble Delta1 (sD1-Fc) to Notch2 on a mouse pro-B cell line, BaF3, in a cell-binding assay and a coprecipitation assay (32Shimizu K. Chiba S. Hosoya N. Kumano K. Saito T. Kurokawa M. Kanda Y. Hamada Y. Hirai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6913-6922Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). To determine the consistency of this relative relationship between Jagged1 and Delta1 in Notch2 binding, we conducted cell-binding assays for other Notch2-expressing cell lines and compared the binding amounts of Jagged1 and Delta1 in various cell lines. The results showed that the lower binding activity of sJ1-Fc observed in BaF3 was maintained in a group of cell lines, such as 32D (mouse myeloid progenitor) and mouse myeloid leukemia cells (designated group A; Fig. 1 A). However, sJ1-Fc bound at a level equivalent to sD1-Fc in other cell lines such as CHO(r), fN2-CHO (CHO(r) with exogenously introduced full-lengthNotch2) and C2C12 (mouse myoblastic) cells (designated group B; Fig. 1 A). We then investigated by coprecipitation assay whether the binding of sD1-Fc and sJ1-Fc to the Notch2 receptor expressed on the surface of groups A and B cells was different. As we showed previously, Notch2 fragments derived from a membrane-spanning subunit (N2TM) were coprecipitated less efficiently with sJ1-Fc than with sD1-Fc in BaF3 (see figure 3E in Ref. 32Shimizu K. Chiba S. Hosoya N. Kumano K. Saito T. Kurokawa M. Kanda Y. Hamada Y. Hirai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6913-6922Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained with 32D cells (data not shown). In contrast, when fN2-CHO was used instead of BaF3 or 32D, sD1-Fc and sJ1-Fc coprecipitated the N2TM-derived fragments to a similar extent (Fig. 1 B). Results obtained with CHO(r) and C2C12 cells were similar to those with fN2-CHO (data not shown). These results indicate that the binding of Delta1 and Jagged1 to Notch2 varies with the type of cell expressing Notch2 and further suggest that there must be a mechanism that modulates the binding between Notch2 and its ligands. Speculating that the fringe proteins might contribute to the different pattern in Jagged1 and Delta1 binding to Notch2, we next examined expression of the known mammalian fringe genes by Northern blot analysis. Strong expression of mFng was detected in BaF3, 32D, and mouse myeloid leukemia cells, but it was undetected in C2C12, CHO(r), and fN2-CHO cells. In contrast, lFng andrFng were detected at a similar level in all of these cells (Fig. 2). In a reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, the expression of mFng was confirmed in BaF3 and 32D but not in C2C12 cells, whereaslFng and rFng were detected in BaF3, 32D, and C2C12 cells (data not shown). These results indicated that the expression of mFng correlated with the differential binding of sD1-Fc and J1-Fc to Notch2. To show the involvement of mFng in the differential binding, we generated fN2-CHO clones expressing exogenous mFng (fN2/mFng-CHO). At the same time, we also generated fN2-CHO cells expressing exogenous lFng (fN2/lFng-CHO) to see whether there is a functional diversity between mFng and lFng (Fig.3 A). As expected, the cell-binding assays showed that sJ1-Fc bound to fN2/mFng-CHO cells less efficiently than sD1-Fc (Fig. 3 B). The fN2/mFng-CHO cells were similar to BaF3 and 32D rather than parental fN2-CHO in that they had a preference for Delta1 (Figs. 1 A and Fig.3 B). In contrast, although binding of sJ1-Fc to fN2/lFng-CHO was also less than that of sD1-Fc, the difference was less prominent than that in fN2/mFng-CHO. When the data were transposed, it was revealed that mFng and lFng did not affect or marginally increased the binding of sD1-Fc to Notch receptors on the fN2-CHO cell surface but reduced that of sJ1-Fc (Fig. 3 C). Coprecipitation assays then revealed that the amount of sJ1-Fc-coprecipitated N2TMwas significantly less than that of sD1-Fc-cprecipitated N2TM in fN2/mFng-CHO cells, in contrast to the fact that the amount of N2TM coprecipitated with sD1-Fc and that with sJ1-Fc were closely similar in parental fN2-CHO cells. In fN2/lFng-CHO cells, the amount of sJ1-Fc-coprecipitated N2TM was slightly less than that of sD1-Fc-coprecipitated N2TM (Fig.3 D). These observations indicate that the fringe proteins have the ability to modulate Notch receptors for interaction with their ligands and that each mFng and lFng executes this activity in a different manner.Figure 3Modulation of Notch2 binding by fringe proteins. A, the generation of fN2-CHO cell lines expressing FLAG-tagged mFng and lFng proteins, designated fN2/mFng-CHO and fN2/lFng-CHO, respectively. The expression of each fringe protein was verified by Western blot analysis with an anti-FLAG antibody.B and C, the binding of two DSL proteins to fN2-CHO, fN2/mFng-CHO, and fN2/lFng-CHO cells was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter. The concentration of incubated DSL proteins was 6.7 nm. C, the binding data were re-aligned to show the effect of mFng and lFng on ligand binding to the Notch receptors more clearly. D, coprecipitation analysis. After incubation of 6.7 nm of the respective DSL-Fc protein or control human IgG (hIgG) with fN2-CHO, fN2/mFng-CHO, and fN2/lFng-CHO cells, protein G beads were added directly to the lysates to precipitate an Fc-containing complex. Notch2TM in each fN2-CHO is shown in the right panel. Two bands represent Notch2TM generated by introduced Notch2 cDNA (exo N2 TM) and endogenous Notch2TMexpressed in CHO(r) (endo N2 TM).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then examined whether the two fringe proteins influenced ligand-triggered Notch2 signaling. In fN2-CHO, the three full-length DSL ligands, Delta1, Jagged1, and Jagged2, activated the transcription of a reporter gene driven by an RBP-Jκ-responsive promoter to a similar extent (see columns designated fN2-CHO in Fig.4 A), as was reported previously (32Shimizu K. Chiba S. Hosoya N. Kumano K. Saito T. Kurokawa M. Kanda Y. Hamada Y. Hirai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6913-6922Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Compared with this, Jagged1-activated transcription was decreased in both fN2/mFng-CHO and fN2/lFng-CHO cells (Fig.4 A). The degree of decrease was significantly greater in fN2/mFng-CHO than in fN2/lFng-CHO cells (Fig. 4 B), demonstrating a difference in function between mFng and lFng. Delta1- and Jagged2-activated transcription was unaffected in fN2/mFng-CHO and slightly enhanced in fN2/lFng-CHO cells (Fig. 4, A andB). When the fringe-generated modulation of signaling through endogenous Notch receptors (Fig. 4 D) was subtracted, results indicated that mFng profoundly reduced the Jagged1-triggered Notch2 signaling, and lFng reduced it to a lesser degree. After subtraction, neither fringe significantly modified the Notch2 signaling triggered by Delta1 or Jagged2. It was reported that the expression of lFng in Delta1- or Jagged1-expressing cells did not affect the ligand-triggered Notch1 activity (33Hics C. Johnston S.H. diSibio G. Collazo A. Vogt T.F. Weinmaster G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 515-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). To determine whether this is also true in the case of Notch2, we separately generated fringe protein-expressing fD1-CHO and fJ1-CHO cell lines and performed a transient transcriptional activation experiment using these cells as stimulators and fN2-CHO as a host of the reporter gene. The stimulator cells induced constant transactivation of the luciferase gene, irrespective of the exogenous introduction of mFng or lFng (Fig. 5). Furthermore, the addition of mFng or lFng purified from the culture supernatant of mFng-CHO or lFng-CHO did not affect the transcription induced by Delta1 or Jagged1 (data not shown). These observations indicate that the fringe proteins must be coexpressed with Notch2. Next, we investigated whether the modification of the Notch2 molecule by the fringe proteins could be identified, and whether the functional diversity between them could be explained by the difference of such modification. We generated CHO(r) cells expressing either of the three deletion mutants of the extracellular domain of Notch2 with a FLAG tag (15N2-CHO, 22N2-CHO, and 29N2-CHO, for deletion mutants harboring the N terminus through the 15th EGF repeat, through the 22nd EGF repeat, and through the 29th EGF repeat, respectively). We further introduced fringe cDNA into these CHO cells. When the supernatant of each cell line was subjected to the gel and Notch2-FLAG was probed in a Western blot, we found that the migration of the 15N2 derived from lFng-expressing cells was slowed as compared with that derived from the parental 15N2-CHO cells (Fig.6 A). The introduction of mFng or the control vector did not affect the migration of the 15N2 protein. A similar result was observed in 22N2 (Fig. 6 B). In contrast, the migration of 29N2 was up-shifted in the presence of either mFng or lFng (Fig. 6 C), indicating an increase in the molecular weight of 29N2. These observations indicate that the fringe proteins directly modify Notch2, which is consistent with the recent finding that fringe is a glycosyltransferase that directly modifies Notch (30Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J. Shao L. Wilson R. Wang Y. Stanley P. Irvine K.D. Haltiwanger R.S. Vogt T.F. Nature. 2000; 406: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar, 31Bruckner K. Peruz L. Clausen H. Cohen S. Nature. 2000; 406: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). It was further indicated that lFng does this at a site from the N terminus through the 15th EGF repeat of Notch2, and mFng does so at a site from the 23rd through the 29th EGF repeat of Notch2. In this study, we characterized the function of mFng and lFng and identified their functional diversities. Both fringe proteins differentially modulated the binding of DSL ligands to the Notch2 receptor as well as Notch2 signaling triggered by DSL ligands. We further obtained biochemical data suggesting that these fringe proteins modify the extracellular region of Notch2 at different sites. Based on the results of in vivo studies usingDrosophila, the notion that fringe inhibits Serrate/Jagged-dependent Notch activation and potentiates Delta-dependent Notch activation has been established (20Laufer E. Dahn R. Orozco O.E. Yeo C.Y. Pisenti J. Henrique D. Abbott U.K. Fallon J.F. Tabin C. Nature. 1997; 386: 366-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar,21Panin V.M. Papayannopoulos V. Wilson R. Irvine K.D. Nature. 1997; 387: 908-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 24Klein T. Arias A.M. Development. 1998; 125: 2951-2962Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This notion was strengthened recently by in vitroanalyses using mammalian versions of these molecules, namely lFng, Notch1, Jagged1, and Delta1 (33Hics C. Johnston S.H. diSibio G. Collazo A. Vogt T.F. Weinmaster G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 515-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the fringe protein was proved recently to be a glycosyltransferase that modifies the extracellular domain of Notch (30Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J. Shao L. Wilson R. Wang Y. Stanley P. Irvine K.D. Haltiwanger R.S. Vogt T.F. Nature. 2000; 406: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar, 31Bruckner K. Peruz L. Clausen H. Cohen S. Nature. 2000; 406: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Given the recent finding thatDrosophila fringe strengthened the binding ofDrosophila Delta to Drosophila Notch (31Bruckner K. Peruz L. Clausen H. Cohen S. Nature. 2000; 406: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar), it was anticipated that the modification of Notch by fringe would influence binding between the Notch receptor and its ligand. However, it has also been reported that fringe does not affect binding between the Notch receptor and its ligand (30Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J. Shao L. Wilson R. Wang Y. Stanley P. Irvine K.D. Haltiwanger R.S. Vogt T.F. Nature. 2000; 406: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar, 31Bruckner K. Peruz L. Clausen H. Cohen S. Nature. 2000; 406: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 34Kleg K.M. Muskavivitch M.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3289-3297PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, the endogenous expression of mFng was clearly correlated to the finding that cell binding of Jagged1 to Notch2 was less than that of Delta1 (Figs. 1 and 2). It was also shown that the enforced expression of mFng reduced the binding of Jagged1 to Notch2 (Fig. 3 D). We therefore suggest that the lower binding of Jagged1 to 32D and BaF3 cells than that of Delta1 resulted from the endogenous expression of mFng, which reduces the Jagged1 binding to Notch2. Furthermore, although mFng did not affect the binding of Delta1 to Notch2 (Fig. 3 C), we observed that mFng strengthened the binding of Delta1 to Notch1 (data not shown). It is therefore true that a fringe protein could modify the binding of a DSL ligand to a Notch receptor in selected circumstances if not in all. Whether a certain fringe protein affects the binding of a DSL ligand to a Notch receptor largely depends on the combination of fringe protein, DSL ligand, and Notch receptor involved. The expression of exogenous lFng in CHO cells, which express endogenous lFng, also showed a binding modulatory activity, although in a lesser degree than that in mFng (Fig. 3). Expression level may therefore be a determinant of whether a fringe protein exerts modulatory activity on ligand-Notch binding. It was reported previously that mFng and lFng inhibited Notch1-mediated signaling triggered by Jagged1 and enhanced that triggered by Delta1, and either Jagged1- or Delta1-triggered Notch2 signaling was enhanced by lFng (33Hics C. Johnston S.H. diSibio G. Collazo A. Vogt T.F. Weinmaster G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 515-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). In contrast, we describe here that mFng and lFng inhibited Notch2-mediated signaling triggered by Jagged1, in which mFng showed stronger activity, and that neither fringe affected Notch2-mediated signaling triggered by Delta1 (Fig. 4). This apparent discrepancy may be because of the difference in the cells that were used to overexpress mFng and lFng. From our results, modification of Notch2 binding to Jagged1 (reduction) and Delta1 (little effect) and modification of Notch2-mediated signaling triggered by Jagged1 (inhibition) and Delta1 (no effect) were correlated with each other (Figs. 3 and 4). It is not clear, however, whether this correlation is of biological significance or represents simple coincidence. To date, the question of functional diversity among the fringe proteins has been poorly addressed. Although a difference has been shown amongDrosophila fringe proteins, mFng and lFng, in their abilities to transfer GlcNAc to O-linked fucose on an EGF repeat of serum protein factor VII (30Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J. Shao L. Wilson R. Wang Y. Stanley P. Irvine K.D. Haltiwanger R.S. Vogt T.F. Nature. 2000; 406: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar), the significance of the difference has remained unclear, because serum protein factor VII is not a physiological target for fringe. As described above, we revealed a functional difference between mFng and lFng in their ability to modulate Jagged1 binding to Notch2 and Jagged1-triggered Notch2 signaling (Figs. 3 and 4). In addition, we found that lFng modifies at a site from the N terminus through the 15th EGF repeat of Notch2, and mFng acts at a site from the 23rd through the 29th EGF repeat (Fig. 6), suggesting that each fringe has its specific site for the modification of Notch2. This could explain why the two fringe proteins cause the different modulation of Notch2 signaling. We note that 5 of 12O-linked fucose consensus sites (2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th, and 8th EGF repeats) are indeed present within the N-terminal through the 15th EGF repeat, and three consensus sites (24th, 25th, and 26th repeats) exist within the 23rd through the 29th EGF repeat. The latter site, representing an mFng target region, coincides with theAbruptex domain of Drosophila Notch comprising EGF-like repeats 24–29, which was identified recently as a domain that may mediate interactions between Notch, its ligands, and fringe (35de Celis J.F. Bray S.J. Development. 2000; 127: 1291-1302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,36Ju B.G. Jeong S. Bae E. Hyun S. Carroll S.B. Yim J. Kim L. Nature. 2000; 405: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Given the fact that Drosophila fringe and Notch interact with each other (36Ju B.G. Jeong S. Bae E. Hyun S. Carroll S.B. Yim J. Kim L.

Thus, to establish the physiological relevance for such a role, we employed a genetic approach by generating embryonic fibroblasts from PTP-1B knockout mice. Both primary fibroblasts and their derived cell lines were used in this study. Immortalization of wild-type primary cells with the SV40 Large T antigen resulted in a dramatic increase in the endogenous expression of PTP-1B, suggesting a role during transformation. Moreover, the absence of PTP-1B in the transformed cell lines led to a more pronounced effect on different pathways of fibronectin-mediated signaling compared with the untransformed state. Specifically, p130Cas phosphorylation, Erk activation as well as cell spreading were delayed in PTP-1B-deficient cells, compared with their wild-type counterparts. Interestingly, this attenuation in integrin-mediated events closely resembles that of Src-deficient fibroblasts. Indeed, PTP-1B deficient, transformed fibroblasts held in suspension do exhibit a hyperphosphorylation of the inhibitory site (Tyr-527) of Src, compared with their wild-type counterparts.

Engagement of cell surface integrins with the ECM generates intracellular signals that promote a variety of processes such as gene expression, cell survival, and cell-cycle progression (1Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3807) Google Scholar). Furthermore, adhesion per se is insufficient to generate survival signals such that cells that attach onto a matrix but are not allowed to effectively spread may undergo apoptosis (2Chen C.S. Mrksich M. Huang S. Whitesides G.M. Ingber D.E. Science. 1997; 276: 1425-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4181) Google Scholar). It is now well established that adhesion-dependent signaling involves changes in tyrosyl phosphorylation of several proteins that is regulated by two large protein superfamilies: protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). Among the PTKs that have long been recognized as critical mediators of integrin signaling, the Src family of kinases (3Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar), as well as the FAK subgroup of kinases (4Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar), are well characterized. Indeed genetic ablation of either FAK or Src has resulted in multiple defects in integrin signaling that include alterations in cell motility, cell spreading, and focal adhesion formation (5Ilic D.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1505-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Together and independently, Src and p125FAK phosphorylate many other proteins, leading to the activation of multiple adhesion-dependent pathways, most notably the Erk subgroup of MAP kinases (8Schlaepfer D.D.

Biol. 1998; 18: 2571-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Independent of Src/p125FAKsignaling, the Src-like kinase Fyn has been shown to be critical in adhesion-dependent Erk activation (10Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E. Giancotti F.G.

Furthermore, recent genetic studies have suggested that the Src/p125FAKand Fyn pathways may act in parallel to obtain optimal activation of Erk (12Barberis L. Wary K.K. Fiucci G. Liu F. Brancaccio M.

Upon integrin stimulation, the adapter protein p130Cas also becomes tyrosine phosphorylated by Src and/or p125FAK (8Schlaepfer D.D. Broome M.A. Hunter T. Mol. Cell.

Tyrosine-phosphorylated p130Cas acts as a large scaffolding molecule to recruit additional signaling complexes and has recently been shown to be involved in the activation of the JNK subgroup of MAP kinases (15Dolfi F.

At the other end, the evidence for specific PTPs in the regulation of integrin signaling has been lagging from that of PTKs, although recent advances have been made in understanding the roles of several PTPs during adhesion (17Angers-Loustau A. Côté J.F. Tremblay M.L. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 493-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Indeed, using knockout fibroblasts, SHP-2, PTP-PEST, and RPTPα have definitively been shown to modulate integrin-mediated responses (18Angers-Loustau A. Côté J.F. Charest A. Dowbenko D. Spencer S.

Interestingly, each of these PTPs has been postulated to act through different mechanisms, either through dephosphorylation of p125FAK, the inhibitory tyrosine of Src kinases, or p130Cas, suggesting that each of these PTPs possess unique roles during adhesion signaling. Another PTP that has been implicated in integrin signaling is protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP-1B), the first PTP that was identified and cloned (22Brown-Shimer S. Johnson K.A. Lawrence J.B.

Its structure consists of an N-terminal catalytic domain followed by two tandem proline-rich motifs that possess a consensus for binding to proteins with SH3 domains (27Liu F. Hill D.E. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31290-31295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). At the extreme C terminus, a small hydrophobic stretch has been shown to be sufficient to localize the enzyme to the endoplasmic reticulum (28Frangioni J.V. Beahm P.H. Shifrin V. Jost C.A. Neel B.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 545-560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Biochemical analyses and PTP “substrate-trapping methods” have suggested that PTP-1B may dephosphorylate the insulin, IGF-I, and EGF receptors, as well as antagonize bcr-abl signaling (29Flint A.J.

In contrast, the role for PTP-1B in integrin signaling is less clear. Originally, overexpression studies have shown that PTP-1B negatively regulates integrin signaling, which was thought to depend on its association with and dephosphorylation of p130Cas (27Liu F. Hill D.E. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31290-31295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 34Liu F. Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 173-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of wild-type PTP-1B in Rat-1 fibroblasts impaired adhesion-dependent Erk activation as well as tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas and p125FAK. Furthermore, overexpression of PTP-1B readily reduced fibronectin (FN)-mediated cell spreading and cell migration. Importantly, these effects were abrogated when a proline mutant that did not bind p130Cas was used. Independently, experiments using a catalytically inactive mutant indicated that PTP-1B had a positive role in integrin signaling (35Arregui C.O. Balsamo J. Lilien J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 861-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In comparison with the above study, expression of this mutant in L cells decreased FN-mediated cell spreading and p125FAKphosphorylation, whereas wild-type PTP-1B had no effect. In this study, PTP-1B is suggested to dephosphorylate the inhibitory site on Src kinases and thus activate them, thereby promoting integrin-mediated events. Consistent with this notion, L cells expressing the catalytically inactive mutant displayed decreased Src activity. It has been argued that the opposite roles of PTP-1B on integrin signaling may reflect the different cell systems employed, although in both cases a fibroblast cell type was used. Alternatively, the promiscuous nature of overexpressed PTP-1B in cells may reflect its dephosphorylation of non-physiological substrates and affect signaling in an artificial manner. Herein we have used a genetic loss-of-function approach to ascertain the physiological role of PTP-1B in adhesion-dependent signaling. We provide evidence that PTP-1B is required for the efficient transduction of integrin-mediated signals and that loss of PTP-1B delays fibronectin-induced cell signaling and cell spreading. In PTP-1B-deficient fibroblasts, a transient hyperphosphorylation of Tyr-527 on Src was observed, suggesting that PTP-1B is involved in Src activation during adhesion.

Ramachandran C. Gresser M.J. Tremblay M.L. Kennedy B.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1544-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1906) Google Scholar). Pan Src and phosphospecific (Tyr-527) Src antibodies were purchased from BIOSOURCE. Antibodies against Erk and phospho-Erk were obtained from New England BioLabs. Anti-β1 integrin and monoclonal p130Casantibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. To detect phosphotyrosine-containing proteins, mAb 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was used (kind gift of J. F. Côté). Fibronectin was purchased from BD Biosciences. All cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (BIOSOURCE) and 5 mg/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies). To obtain primary embryonic fibroblasts, wild-type (+/+) and mutant (−/−) E14 embryos were isolated. The head and organs were removed, and the remaining carcasses were minced and dispersed into single cell suspensions in trypsin at 37 °C for 30 min. Afterward, cells were resuspended in medium and experiments were performed within three passages. Immortalized cells were derived by infection of primary cultures with a recombinant retrovirus expressing the SV40 Large T antigen. Independent “cell lines” were derived from immortalized cells obtained from separate embryos. Prior to the start of experiments, near confluent cultures were starved overnight in 0.1% fetal bovine serum in DMEM. Cells were washed with PBS, harvested by limited trypsin treatment (0.01% trypsin, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 min at 37 °C) and then inactivated by two washes with 0.1% fetal bovine serum, 0.2% bovine serum albumin in DMEM. Cells were kept in suspension at 37 °C for 30 min, then lysed immediately or replated onto tissue culture dishes that had been precoated overnight with 10 µg/ml FN in PBS. Prior to lysis, cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and then scraped into TNE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and CompleteTM EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Crude lysates were rotated end-over-end at 4 °C for 20 min and then cleared by centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min. In the analyses of Src phosphorylation, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with the same phosphatase and protease inhibitors. An equivalent amount of SDS sample buffer was added to the TNE or RIPA lysates and boiled for 5 min at 95 °C. For immunoprecipitations, equal amounts of (TNE) protein lysates (0.5–1.0 mg) were incubated with the appropriate antibodies and 25 µl of protein A-agarose (Life Technologies). The mixtures were then incubated end-over-end at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed three times in TNE and then resuspended in SDS sample buffer, followed by boiling at 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Blots were blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin, 1% goat serum in TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) for 2 h. Incubation with the primary antibodies took place at room temperature for 1.5 h (or overnight at 4 °C for Src and Erk antibodies), washed five times in TBST, and then incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 30 min. After five washes with TBST, proteins were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cells were treated similarly to that for the cell signaling studies. Approximately 2 × 105cells in a volume of 1 ml were added to 35-mm FN-coated dishes for the indicated times at 37 °C. Afterward the dishes were chilled on ice for 10 min, placed on an eclipse TE300 (inverted) Nikon microscope, and photographed with a CCD camera using Metamorph software (version 4.1). Single cells that were phase-bright with rounded morphology were scored as non-spread, whereas those that possessed a flattened shape and were phase-dark were scored as spread. Three different fields for each sample were averaged. At least 100 cells were counted in each field. Error bars represent S.E. from these counts. Cells were seeded at a density of 5000 cells/cm2 onto Falcon chamber slides and allowed to grow for 21 h. Cells were washed once with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at 4 °C, and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Slides were blocked overnight with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS at 4 °C. To detect filamentous/polymerized actin, the cells were incubated with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (1:500 dilution) for 2 h at room temperature, washed three times with PBS, and then mounted in a 1:1 mixture of 2.5% 1,4-diazabicyclo [2.2.2.] octane (DABCO; Sigma). Cells were then visualized with the eclipse TE300 (inverted) Nikon microscope, and photographed with a CCD camera using Metamorph software (version 4.1). The details of the targeted inactivation of PTP-1B and its role in insulin signaling have been previously described (37Elchebly M. Payette P. Michaliszyn E. Cromlish W. Collins S. Loy A.L. Normandin D. Cheng A. Himms-Hagen J. Chan C.C. Ramachandran C. Gresser M.J. Tremblay M.L. Kennedy B.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1544-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1906) Google Scholar). However, to clarify the role of PTP-1B in integrin signaling, we have generated embryonic fibroblasts and cell lines to use as a model. Primary embryonic fibroblasts were derived from E14 wild-type (+/+) or mutant (−/−) embryos, and experiments were performed within three passages. Cell lines were also obtained by immortalization of primary cells by the SV40 Large T antigen (Tag). Western blotting analysis of PTP-1B protein confirmed the genotype of each cell line (Fig. 1 A). Interestingly, the levels of PTP-1B in SV40 Tag immortalized cell lines were dramatically increased compared with levels found in primary embryonic fibroblasts (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1, 3, 4,and 5), suggesting a role for PTP-1B during immortalization or transformation. Consistent with this notion, PTP-1B protein levels has been shown to be increased by the expression of the bcr-abl oncogene (30LaMontagne Jr., K.R. Flint A.J. Franza Jr., B.R. Pandergast A.M. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2965-2975Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this effect seems to be specific for PTP-1B, as the expression level of T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TC-PTP), a closely related PTP, was not significantly altered by SV40 Tag (Fig. 1 B). In embryonic fibroblasts, the α5β1 receptor is the major integrin involved in the recognition of the fibronectin ligand. Immunoblotting with antibodies against the β1chain suggests that this was the case in all our cells tested (Fig.1 C), validating their use for subsequent cell adhesion studies. One of the earliest events following engagement of integrins by the extracellular matrix includes the tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins, most noticeably within the 120–130 kDa range that includes p130Cas and p125FAK (38Nojima Y. Morino N. Mimura T. Hamasaki K. Furuya H. Sakai R. Sato T. Tachibana K. Morimoto C. Yazaki Y.,. et al.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15398-15402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 39Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22259-22262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In addition, previous biochemical studies suggested that PTP-1B negatively regulates integrin signaling through the binding and dephosphorylation of the adapter protein p130Cas (27Liu F. Hill D.E. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31290-31295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 34Liu F. Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 173-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, to determine the physiological importance of PTP-1B toward integrin induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas, serum-starved PTP-1B wild-type and mutant cells were either kept in suspension or replated onto fibronectin-coated dishes for the indicated period of times. The levels of protein tyrosine phosphorylation were then analyzed by immunoblotting of cell lysates with anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-pY) antibodies. Cells held in suspension exhibited almost a complete absence of phosphotyrosine (pY)-containing proteins of around 120–130 kDa as expected (Fig. 2). Upon re-attachment to FN, the pY levels within the 120–130-kDa range were rapidly elevated. In primary fibroblasts, these pY levels were not considerably different between wild-type and mutant cells when normalized against p130Cas protein levels (Fig. 2 A). Interestingly, the pY levels for the 120–130 kDa proteins were somewhat decreased in PTP-1B mutant Tag cell lines after 20 min of replating onto FN (Fig.2 B, lanes 6–10) but were restored by 40 min (Fig. 2 B, lanes 11–20). In contrast, constitutive hyperphosphorylation of proteins around 180 and 80 kDa were observed in PTP-1B mutant cells compared with wild-type controls and was more pronounced in the transformed mutant cell lines. One probable explanation for the magnified differences seen in the cell lines (as opposed to primary cells) is the increased expression of PTP-1B in the transformed state. Previous experiments demonstrated that overexpression of PTP-1B in Rat 3Y1 fibroblasts reduced adhesion-dependent p130Cas phosphorylation (34Liu F. Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 173-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, to further determine whether FN-induced p130Cas phosphorylation is altered in the absence of PTP-1B, the cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with antibodies toward p130Cas and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-pY antibodies. Equal immunoprecipitation of p130Cas protein was monitored in all experiments by subsequent reprobing of stripped blots with anti-p130Casantibodies. In primary fibroblasts, cells in suspension lacked detectable p130Cas phosphorylation, which was readily induced upon replating onto FN for 20 min (Fig.3 A). However, no discernible change in p130Cas phosphorylation was observed between wild-type and mutant primary cells, consistent with the observations of FN-induced pY levels (Fig. 2 A). In comparison, this was not the case for the Tag-transformed cell lines. After 20 min of replating onto FN, PTP-1B mutant Tag cell lines exhibited a decrease in p130Cas phosphorylation compared with wild-type cells, which once again paralleled the observations of FN-induced pY levels (Fig. 2 B, lanes 6–10). However, this effect was not significant after 40 min of replating onto FN (Fig. 2 B,lanes 11–20). Nevertheless, these results suggest that p130Cas is not a robust physiological substrate of PTP-1B under these conditions. In fact, it appears that PTP-1B is required for efficient FN-induced p130Cas phosphorylation, especially in the transformed state. Our results demonstrating that PTP-1B is required for efficient FN-induced p130Cas phosphorylation raises the possibility that PTP-1B could be required for other FN-mediated events. One particular adhesion-dependent signaling pathway includes the activation of the Erk subgroup of the MAP kinase cascade, presumably through activation of one or more Src kinases. To determine the ability of FN to induce Erk activation in PTP-1B wild-type and mutant cells, we performed immunoblot analysis with phosphospecific antibodies that recognize activated Erk protein. In suspension, only modest amounts of activated Erk were detected in all cell lines (Fig.4). In primary cells, adhesion onto FN for 20 min activated Erk (Fig. 4 A), similar to that previously observed for NIH 3T3 cells (40Aplin A.E. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 695-706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). No appreciable differences were observed for PTP-1B wild-type or mutant primary cells. However, in the case of Tag cell lines, after 20 min of replating onto fibronectin, wild-type cell lines readily displayed an increase in phospho-Erk levels (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, PTP-1B mutant Tag cell lines were impaired in their ability to induce adhesion-dependent Erk activation. Interestingly, PTP-1B mutant cells that were fully adherent in culture, displayed normal Erk activation in response to serum suggesting that the FN-dependent impairment is transient or rescued by other signaling pathways activated by components in serum (data not shown). Regardless, these results suggest that PTP-1B positively regulates FN-mediated Erk activation as well as p130Cas phosphorylation in transformed but not primary cells. It is well established that MAP kinase activation depends on an intact cytoskeleton and is associated with the formation of actin structures (40Aplin A.E. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 695-706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Renshaw M.W. Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5592-5599Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Because FN-mediated cell spreading is dependent on actin bundling and correlates with efficient MAP kinase activation in NIH 3T3 cells, it is possible that PTP-1B mutant cells might exhibit a defect in cell spreading. To explore this possibility, we plated PTP-1B wild-type and mutant primary cells onto FN for either 10, 20, or 60 min. Afterward, cells were chilled on ice for 10 min and then photographed. Single cells that were phase-bright with rounded morphology were scored as non-spread, whereas those that possessed a flattened shape and were phase-dark were scored as spread. Fig.5 A shows representative photographs obtained from PTP-1B wild-type and mutant primary cells. Typically, the PTP-1B wild-type cells displayed around 30% spreading efficiency after 10 min on FN, whereas PTP-1B mutant cells displayed only 15% spreading efficiency (Fig. 5 B). By 20 min, PTP-1B mutant cells were still lagging behind wild-type cells in terms of spreading, although the difference became less apparent as time continued. In addition, similar results were obtained using the Tag cell lines (data not shown). Thus, these results suggest that PTP-1B is required for efficient spreading on FN in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Cell morphology is known to be dependent on the actin cytoskeleton. Subsequently, we analyzed the actin staining in both PTP-1B wild-type and mutant cells using Rhodamine-conjugated Phalloidin, that specifically recognizes F-actin (polymerized actin). At low densities (5000 cells/cm2), most PTP-1B wild-type transformed cells exhibit a round, spread morphology (Fig. 5 C, aand c); in contrast a relatively high proportion of PTP-1B mutant transformed cells displayed an elongated, spindle like shape (Fig. 5 C, b and d). These results suggest that PTP-1B regulates an aspect of actin dynamics that affects cell morphology in transformed cells. Previous gene-targeting studies have clearly established the physiological importance of Src during adhesion-mediated cell spreading (7Kaplan K.B. Swedlow J.R. Morgan D.O. Varmus H.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1505-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). During adhesion onto FN, it has previously been shown that Tyr-527 of Src transiently becomes dephosphorylated and then quickly becomes rephosphorylated (42Kaplan K.B. Bibbins K.B. Swedlow J.R. Arnaud M. Morgan D.O. Varmus H.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4745-4756Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In addition, Src is primarily regulated through this site (43MacAuley A. Cooper J.A. Mol.

Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). These minimal components are insufficient for transcription from reconstituted nucleosomal templates, however, implying the existence of cellular mechanisms for chromatin remodeling to facilitate access of the transcription machinery to DNA (2Wolffe A.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Two classes of nuclear factors, ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes and histone acetyltransferases, allow the transcription machinery to assemble and initiate transcription from chromatin templates (3Peterson C.L.

Recently, a novel factor, FACT1(Facilitates ChromatinTranscription), which enables transcription elongation past nucleosomes, was isolated from HeLa nuclear extracts (5Orphanides G. LeRoy G.

Circumstantial evidence suggests that HMG domain proteins bind to DNA as it enters and exits the nucleosome (14Bustin M. Reeves R. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol.

Consistent with the hypothesis that the HMG domain of SSRP1 is responsible for FACT binding to DNA, FACT activity is abolished by addition of a 5-fold excess of superhelical plasmid DNA competitor (5Orphanides G.

The mechanistic details of derepression of transcription elongation by FACT remain to be elucidated.Human Cdc68/Spt16 is a 119.9-kDa nuclear protein with 36% identity to its yeast homolog. Previous genetic studies with yeast Cdc68 suggested a role in modulating chromatin structure to effect both gene repression and activation (15Lycan D. Mikesell G. Bunger M. Breeden L. Mol. Cell.

Initially isolated from expression screening of a human B-cell cDNA library for proteins that bind DNA modified by the antitumor agent cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II)), SSRP1 is expected to bind distorted DNA structures through its DNA-binding HMG domain (18Bruhn S.L.

The ability of SSRP1 to recognize DNA modified by cisplatin and the deleterious effect of cisplatin on transcription suggest a possible role for SSRP1 and its physiologically relevant complex FACT in the cisplatin anticancer mechanism (19Bruhn S.L.

Although the success of cisplatin therapy on a variety of cancers, including testicular, ovarian, and head and neck, has been remarkable since its introduction in 1979, there are several drawbacks to cisplatin treatment. These include toxic side effects, inherent or acquired resistance, and efficacy in only a handful of tumor types (22Pil P. Lippard S.J. Bertino J.R. Encyclopedia of Cancer. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1997: 392-410Google Scholar). A detailed understanding of its mechanism of action may allow for the rational design of new antitumor therapies.Cisplatin reacts with a number of cellular components, but it is generally accepted that the biologically relevant target is DNA. After loss of the chloride ligands due to the relatively low concentration of Cl− ions in the cell, cisplatin coordinates preferentially to the N-7 atoms of two adjacent purine nucleotides by forming mainly intrastrand d(GpG) and d(ApG) DNA cross-links (23Takahara P.M. Rozenzweig A.C. Frederick C.A. Lippard S.J. Nature. 1995; 371: 649-652Crossref Scopus (731) Google Scholar, 24Lepre C.A. Lippard S.J. Eckstein F. Lilley D.M.J. Nucleic Acids and Molecular Biology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany1990: 9-38Google Scholar). Such adducts bend the duplex toward the major groove and unwind the DNA helix. The minor groove is concomitantly flattened and widened. Delineation of the cellular processing of cisplatin-DNA adducts is of great importance to unraveling its mechanism of cytotoxicity. Therefore, much work has focused on identifying and characterizing proteins that bind 1,2-intrastrand cross-links with high affinity and specificity (25Zamble D.B. Lippard S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 435-439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Structural distortions imposed on DNA by cisplatin 1,2-intrastrand cross-links are recognized by members of the HMG domain protein family including SSRP1 with notable specificity over unmodified double-stranded DNA.Like other members of the HMG-domain protein family, SSRP1 is expected to recognize cisplatin-damaged DNA through this DNA-binding component. Here we demonstrate the affinity and specificity of FACT for cisplatin-damaged DNA and the major 1,2-intrastrand cisplatin-DNA lesion in particular. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays reveal that both the SSRP1 and Spt16 subunits of FACT are necessary for high affinity binding to cisplatin-modified DNA. The isolated HMG domain of SSRP1, however, is sufficient for binding the major 1,2-d(GpG) intrastrand cisplatin-DNA cross-link. The affinity and specificity of FACT for cisplatin-modified DNA and its role in modulating chromatin structure during transcription suggest that the interaction of FACT and cisplatin-damaged DNA may be important in the cisplatin anticancer mechanism.

Here we demonstrate the affinity and specificity of FACT for cisplatin-damaged DNA and the major 1,2-intrastrand cisplatin-DNA lesion in particular. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays reveal that both the SSRP1 and Spt16 subunits of FACT are necessary for high affinity binding to cisplatin-modified DNA. The isolated HMG domain of SSRP1, however, is sufficient for binding the major 1,2-d(GpG) intrastrand cisplatin-DNA cross-link. The affinity and specificity of FACT for cisplatin-modified DNA and its role in modulating chromatin structure during transcription suggest that the interaction of FACT and cisplatin-damaged DNA may be important in the cisplatin anticancer mechanism.

To search for the presence of additional splice variants of DDR1 within the juxtamembrane region, we applied a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based approach in conjunction with primers localized within the transmembrane region (exon 9) and the tyrosine kinase domain (exon 13).PRINCIPAL FINDINGS1. Identification of two novel kinase-deficient isoformsAll seven different human colon carcinoma cell lines analyzed express DDR1a as demonstrated by an amplification product of 513 bp. All cell lines also revealed a major amplification product of 624 bp, most likely corresponding to DDR1b mRNA, except for Colo 206F, where only a faint band was detected. The detection of additional bands with sizes of ∼ 750, 600, 420, and 270 bp suggested the presence of further isoforms (Fig. 1⤻ ). The complete PCR product of the cel..."

Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were combined with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to assess histone acetylation associated with the StAR promoter. MA-10 cells treated with 8-bromo-cAMP had increased acetylated histone H3 associated with the proximal (but not distal) StAR promoter, nascent StAR transcripts, and progesterone production within 15 min, whereas StAR mRNA increased at 30 min. At 360 min, steroidogenesis remained elevated, but mRNA, nascent RNA, and StAR promoter-associated H3 acetylation all declined. StAR promoter-associated H4 acetylation was unchanged by 8-bromo-cAMP treatment of MA-10 cells. In vivoanalysis of macaque and human granulosa cells showed that luteinization was associated with increased StAR promoter-associated H3 acetylation. We conclude that acetylation of H3 (but not H4) associated with the proximal promoter is associated with StAR gene transcription, that chromatin modification occurs in discrete regions of the promoter, that the initial steroidogenic response to 8-bromo-cAMP occurs prior to increased StAR mRNA accumulation, and that MA-10 cell StAR gene transcription and promoter-associated H3 acetylation are biphasic during a 6-h treatment period.

In the absence of functional StAR protein, gonadal and adrenal steroidogenesis is markedly impaired and unmetabolized cholesterol accumulates as sterol esters in cytoplasmic lipid droplets.

Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2367) Google Scholar, 18Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 1998; 92: 307-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). The highly basic N-terminal histone tails that project away from the core histone complex play a key role in higher order chromatin structure and in interactions of histones with other chromatin-associated regulatory proteins (19Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6793) Google Scholar, 20Hansen J.C. Tse C. Wolffe A.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17637-17641Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 21Luger K. Richmond T.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 140-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The reversible post-translational modifications of the histone N terminus include ADP-ribosylation, glycosylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and the best documented modification, acetylation (22Davie J.R. Spencer V.A. J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 1999; 32/33: 141-148Crossref Google Scholar, 23Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6507) Google Scholar). Acetylation neutralizes the positive charge on lysines located at the N terminus of histones H3 and H4 and was originally thought to allow the proteins to dissociate from the negatively charged DNA, thereby allowing the DNA to interact with transcription factors and the transcriptional machinery (24Mizzen C.A. Allis C.D. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 6-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). However, more recent studies indicate that acetylation, while facilitating transcription, can do so without displacement of the N-terminal tail domains from the DNA. Moreover, recent in vivo studies indicate that the histone N terminus is a highly structured domain that is primarily involved in protein-protein interactions. Acetylation of the histones increases the α-helical character of the N-terminal domains (25Wang X. Moore S.C. Laszckzak M. Ausio J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35013-35020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This structural change may influence the interactions of histones with other chromatin proteins, ultimately leading to the destabilization of the higher order chromatin folding (26Wang X. He C. Moore S.C. Ausio J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12764-12768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Acetylation and other post-translational modifications have been proposed to represent a “histone code” that might determine the sequence and nature of protein interactions that facilitate transcription and/or DNA replication (23Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6507) Google Scholar). However, this interesting hypothesis has yet to be critically evaluated through experimentation.A link between histone acetylation and gene transcription has been suspected for many years (reviewed in Ref. 17Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2367) Google Scholar). The discovery that coactivator proteins possess histone acetyltransferase activity provided direct evidence for an important role for histone acetylation and transcriptional regulation (27Brownell J.E. Zhou J. Ranalli T. Kobayashi R. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Cell. 1996; 84: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). It is postulated that DNA-binding proteins recruit transcriptional coactivators that acetylate the histones associated with the gene promoter, allowing access of and/or recruitment of other proteins (e.g. TATA-binding proteins, RNA polymerase II, etc.) to the DNA to promote transcription. Thus, histone acetylation could be thought of as an excellent marker of gene activity. Conversely, histone deacetylases are thought to be involved in the silencing of gene transcription.A recently developed method to identify remodeled chromatin using reversible formaldehyde cross-linking of proteins and DNA and antibodies to immunoprecipitate DNA associated with acetylated histones or chromatin associated with specific transcription factors has provided new insights into the early events of transcriptional regulation. However, the previously described chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays have been largely qualitative or at best semiquantitative in nature, limiting the assay output to an all-or-nothing readout (28Chen H. Lin R.J. Xie W. Wilpitz D. Evans R.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 29Sambucetti L.C. Fischer D.D. Zabludoff S. Kwon P.O. Chamberlin H.

Cell. 1999; 3: 125-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The studies described here demonstrate for the first time that acetylation of histone H3 (but not histone H4) associated with the proximal region of the StAR promoter is associated with the transcriptional activity of that gene. We also describe a sensitive and reproducible method for quantitation of promoter activity (i.e. histone acetylation) linking the ChIP assay to quantitative real-time PCR analysis of the promoter element in the StAR gene. This marriage of methodologies will allow quantification of the activity of multiple genes under in vivo conditions.DISCUSSIONThere has been a concerted effort by several laboratories to understand the hormonal/cAMP-dependent regulation of StAR gene expression to unlock the mysteries surrounding regulation of steroidogenesis. Our experiments illustrate for the first time that increased StAR promoter-associated histone H3 acetylation is associated with StAR gene activation as indicated by accumulation of nascent StAR transcripts and processed StAR mRNA. These studies also demonstrate for the first time the hormonal (hCG) regulation of gene promoter activity (i.e. acetylation) in a whole animal model system, whereby periovulatory monkey granulosa cells were collected before and after an ovulatory dose of gonadotropin. Finally, these experiments describe for the first time the combination of the ChIP procedure and quantitative real-time PCR, allowing for a sensitive, reproducible, and unbiased measure of protein association with gene promoter elements under in vivo conditions. Previously, ChIP assays have been based on semiquantitative analysis usually involving the examination of PCR products at a fixed cycle number, followed by densitometry of the radioactive band or ethidium bromide-stained DNA, or they were purely qualitative in nature (28Chen H. Lin R.J. Xie W. Wilpitz D. Evans R.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 29Sambucetti L.C. Fischer D.D. Zabludoff S. Kwon P.O. Chamberlin H.

Cell. 1999; 3: 125-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The experimental method described here greatly improves the quantitative nature of the ChIP procedure and should allow for a more accurate assessment of differences in protein-DNA interaction and the monitoring of heterogeneity of cellular responses within a natural chromatin environment. Using a nested PCR strategy, the sensitivity and specificity of this assay can be increased.Tropic hormone-stimulated steroidogenesis is dependent on the expression and function of the StAR protein. In these studies, we show for the first time that acetylation of H3 associated with the StAR promoter is temporally linked to the cAMP-dependent increases in StAR gene expression in MA-10 mouse Leydig cells. Conversely, 8-Br-cAMP treatment of MA-10 cells failed to influence the acetylation of H4 associated with the StAR gene promoter. Differential acetylation of the core histones is not a unique attribute of the StAR promoter. Indeed, several recent studies using the same antibodies employed in our ChIP analysis have exhibited differential association of acetylated H3 or H4 with other gene promoters under conditions known to activate the gene (29Sambucetti L.C. Fischer D.D. Zabludoff S. Kwon P.O. Chamberlin H. Trogani N. Xu H. Cohen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34940-34947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 30Bennett M.K.

ChIP analysis of the p21waf1gene promoter was recently shown to be associated with increased H3 acetylation, whereas H4 acetylation did not change under conditions that regulate the cell cycle-dependent expression of p21waf1. Similarly, the low density lipoprotein receptor and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase promoters also exhibit preferential acetylation of H3 under conditions known to activate these genes (30Bennett M.K. Ngo T.T. Athanikar J.N. Rosenfeld J.M. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13025-13032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In contrast to these observations, viral infection stimulates both H3 and H4 acetylation of the interferon-β gene promoter (31Parekh B.S. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 125-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), whereas four estrogen-responsive genes (pS2,EB1, c-myc, and CTD) were shown to exhibit preferential acetylation of H4 versus H3 following estrogen treatment of the cells (23Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6507) Google Scholar, 24Mizzen C.A. Allis C.D. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 6-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 25Wang X.

Chem. 2001; 276: 12764-12768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).The acetylation of H3 associated the StAR promoter was region-specific in that 8-Br-AMP stimulation caused hyperacetylation of only the proximal promoter. Moreover, the cAMP analog did not promote H3 acetylation in a context where the StAR gene is silent. These observations demonstrate the apparent regional selectivity of chromatin modification as well as underscore the association between histone acetylation and gene activity. However, because these experiments examined only a small region of the proximal promoter, we cannot exclude the possibility of acetylation of histones bound to other portions of the StAR gene or address the significance of such modifications regarding StAR gene transcription.Treatment of MA-10 cells with the protein kinase A agonist 8-Br-cAMP increased steroid output by these cells within 15 min. The ∼30-fold increase in progesterone output at the 15-min time point preceded the increase in StAR mRNA by 15 min, suggesting that the increased steroid synthesis either was independent of StAR mRNA accumulation or was the result of a post-transcriptional/translational event (e.g. translational regulation or phosphorylation of the StAR protein). Previous studies with MA-10 cells demonstrated that inhibition of transcription with actinomycin D blocked StAR mRNA expression and new protein production and caused a 75–80% decline in steroidogenic output by these cells at all time points (30–240 min) after exposure to hCG or dibutyryl-cAMP (5Clark B.J. Combs R. Hales K.H. Hales D.B. Stocco D.M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4893-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The inability to completely inhibit steroidogenesis is consistent with the notion that StAR function is modulated by a co- or post-translational modification, as originally suggested by Orme-Johnson and co-workers (40Pon L.A. Hartigan J.A. Orme-Johnson N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13309-13316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, these investigators demonstrated that phosphorylation of a mitochondrial protein, later identified as StAR, was temporally associated with the acute effects of ACTH/hCG/dibutyryl-cAMP on steroidogenesis in adrenal, Leydig, and luteal cells (40Pon L.A. Hartigan J.A. Orme-Johnson N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13309-13316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Pon L.A. Epstein L.F. Orme-Johnson N.R. Endocr. Res. 1986; 12: 429-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 42Pon L.A. Orme-Johnson N.R. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 1942-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In a more direct analysis of the role of StAR phosphorylation, Arakaneet al. (43Arakane F. King S.R. Du Y. Kallen C.B. Walsh L.P. Watari H. Stocco D.M. Strauss III, J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32656-32662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) demonstrated that mutation of the human StAR protein at serine 195 or 194 in mouse StAR reduced StAR-dependent pregnenolone production by ∼50%. Although the initial increase in steroidogenesis is evidently not the result of increased StAR mRNA levels, the subsequent large increase in steroid production occurring after 15 min of exposure to 8-Br-cAMP is linked to the accumulation of StAR mRNA.It is notable that StAR gene transcription as monitored by levels of nascent StAR transcripts declined between 180 and 360 min of 8-Br-cAMP stimulation despite the continued presence of 1 mm8-Br-cAMP in the culture fluid. The concomitant decline in H3 acetylation between 180 and 360 min suggests that H3 acetylation may be required for cAMP-dependent StAR gene expression. We have recently found that cAMP activates the ERK signaling cascade in ovarian cells, resulting in a reduction of StAR protein levels and inhibition of steroidogenesis (44Seger R. Hanoch T. Rosenberg R. Dantes A. Merz W.E. Strauss III, J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13957-13964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that a strong tropic signal elicits a concomitant counterbalancing response that limits the magnitude or duration of the cellular reaction to the stimulus. It is possible that the ERK signaling pathway reduces StAR gene transcription through repressors of StAR gene expression such as DAX-1 (45Zazopoulos E. Lalli E. Stocco D.M. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1997; 390: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) or possibly by promoting recruitment of histone deacetylases to the proximal StAR promoter, reversing the chromatin modifications that support transcription.Substantial differences in H3 acetylation of the StAR gene promoter between rhesus monkey non-luteinized and luteinized granulosa cells compared with control and 8-Br-cAMP-treated MA-10 cells were detected in this study. This observation is likely due to differences in basal expression of the StAR gene in these two different cell types. The StAR gene is essentially silent in non-luteinized granulosa cells as evidenced by low/non-detectable StAR mRNA (33Chaffin C.L. Dissen G.A. Stouffer R.L. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2000; 6: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and consistent with the detection of low levels of H3 acetylation in the proximal StAR promoter. This may be the result of expression of the StAR gene in a limited number of granulosa cells within the periovulatory follicle. The luteinization process stimulated by in vivoadministration of gonadotropins induces transcription of StAR in the full cohort of granulosa cells. This dramatic change in the number of transcriptionally active cells accounts for the large differences between the non-luteinized and luteinized granulosa cells. In contrast, MA-10 cells exhibit basal StAR gene transcription under control conditions; and therefore, the induction of StAR promoter activity following exposure to 8-Br-cAMP is limited.The development of the ChIP technique to assay protein-DNA interactions in an in vivo context was a major advance in the study of transcriptional regulation. We have now joined this method with quantitative real-time PCR, allowing the procedure to yield quantitative observations regarding protein (i.e.histone)-DNA interaction at specific sites within gene promoters. This method should permit investigators to quantitate changes in gene activity in tissues where transcriptional responses occur dyssynchronously in component cells. With the recent development of new fluorescent dyes for probe labeling, it is possible to examine multiple targets in a single PCR, expanding the capacity of the ChIP/quantitative real-time PCR technique to examine the in vivo protein-DNA interactions. For example, comparisons of proximal and distal StAR promoter chromatin could be made simultaneously, eliminating variation in results due to loading differences. Alternatively, simultaneous examination of multiple target genes using different fluorescent probes could be accomplished. Finally, with immunoprecipitating antibodies that specifically interact with transcription factors/coactivators in a chromatin environment, the ChIP/quantitative real-time PCR technique could be used to identify the specific factors involved and the order in which these factors associate with the gene promoter to induce gene transcription. The translocation of cholesterol from the relatively sterol-rich outer mitochondrial membrane to the relatively cholesterol-poor inner mitochondrial membrane is the rate-limiting step in steroid synthesis (1Christenson L.K. Strauss III, J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 175-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR)1 plays an integral role in this cholesterol translocation as evidenced by experiments of nature (2Lin D. Sugawara T. Strauss III, J.F. Clark B.J.

In the absence of functional StAR protein, gonadal and adrenal steroidogenesis is markedly impaired and unmetabolized cholesterol accumulates as sterol esters in cytoplasmic lipid droplets. The conservation of StAR protein structure and expression patterns in steroidogenic tissues of piscine, avian, amphibian, and mammalian species testifies to the importance of this protein in steroid synthesis (4Bauer M.P.

We have demonstrated previously that the subcellular localization of the human CDC6 homolog, HsCDC6, is cell cycle-dependent: nuclear during G1 phase and cytoplasmic during S phase. Here we demonstrate that endogenous HsCDC6 is phosphorylated during the G1/S transition. The N-terminal region contains putative cyclin-dependent kinase phosphorylation sites adjoining nuclear localization sequences (NLSs) and a cyclin-docking motif, whereas the C-terminal region contains a nuclear export signal (NES). In addition, we show that the observed regulated subcellular localization depends on phosphorylation status, NLS, and NES. When the four putative substrate sites (serines 45, 54, 74, and 106) for cyclin-dependent kinases are mutated to alanines, the resulting HsCDC6A4 protein is localized predominantly to the nucleus. This localization depends upon two functional NLSs, because expression of HsCDC6 containing mutations in the two putative NLSs results in predominantly cytoplasmic distribution. Furthermore, mutation of the four serines to phosphate-mimicking aspartates (HsCDC6D4) results in strictly cytoplasmic localization. This cytoplasmic localization depends upon the C-terminal NES. Together these results demonstrate that HsCDC6 is phosphorylated at the G1/S phase of the cell cycle and that the phosphorylation status determines the subcellular localization.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 396-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), suggesting an alternative mechanism of regulation of HsCDC6 at the G1/S transition in human cells. This idea is supported by studies from our laboratory and others that demonstrate that epitope-tagged HA-HsCDC6 is found to be nuclear in G1 cells and cytoplasmic in S phase cells (19Saha P. Chen J.

A. 1999; 96: 6193-6198Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). We show that HsCDC6 contains two putative N-terminal NLSs and a leucine-rich C-terminal nuclear export signal (NES), LXXXLXXLXL (reviewed in Ref. 23Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Previous reports of other proteins containing both nuclear import and export motifs describe protein shuttling from one compartment to the other until one of the motifs is masked, whether by phosphorylation, association with other proteins, or other modification (24Komeili A. O'Shea E.K. Science. 1999; 284: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 25Zhu J. Shibasaki F. Price R. Guillemot J.C. Yano T. Dotsch V. Wagner G. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Cell. 1998; 93: 851-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Our working hypothesis is that HsCDC6 is synthesized and imported into the nucleus in an NLS-dependent manner, whereby it binds ORC and begins assembly of the prereplicative complex. Unbound (excess) HsCDC6 continues to shuttle. Upon phosphorylation of HsCDC6, possibly by cyclin A/cdk, HsCDC6 is released from the prereplicative complex, whereby it becomes available for export from the nucleus via its NES.Here we show that HsCDC6 is phosphorylated by cyclin/cdksin vitro via association with cyclin/cdks through the Cy motif and becomes dephosphorylated in G1 and phosphorylated at the G1/S transition in vivo. A functional Cy motif and intact phosphorylation sites are required for the cytoplasmic displacement of HsCDC6 in S phase. Furthermore, conversion of the cyclin/cdk-targeted serines (SPXK) to phosphate-mimicking aspartic acid resulted in nearly exclusive cytoplasmic localization of the protein during G1 phase when cdk is inactive. Together these results indicate that dephosphorylated HsCDC6 localizes to the nucleus through the action of either of two NLSs, is phosphorylated at the G1/S border, whereby HsCDC6 relocates to the cytoplasm, possibly through the unmasking of the NES.DISCUSSIONOur laboratory and others (19Saha P.

A. 1999; 96: 6193-6198Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) demonstrated previously that subcellular localization of HsCDC6 is cell cycle-dependent, whereby HsCDC6 is nuclear in G1 phase and cytoplasmic in S phase. We also showed cell cycle-specific association of cyclin A/cdk2 with HsCDC6 (19Saha P. Chen J. Thome K.C. Lawlis S.J. Hou Z.H. Hendricks M. Parvin J.D. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2758-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). We show here that endogenous HsCDC6 is phosphorylated at the G1/S border, a finding temporally consistent with cyclin A expression, origin firing, and the redistribution of HsCDC6 to the cytoplasm. In addition, we investigate the role of this phosphorylation in HsCDC6 localization through mutational analysis of 1) the four putative cyclin/cdk phosphorylation sites, 2) the cyclin-docking motif, Cy, 3) N-terminal nuclear localization signals, and 4) a C-terminal nuclear export signal. It was reported previously that HsCDC6 is phosphorylated on serines 54, 74, and 106 by cyclin/cdks (21Petersen B.O. Lukas J. Sorensen C.S. Bartek J. Helin K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 396-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 22Jiang W. Wells N.J. Hunter T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6193-6198Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). We have similar results 2L. M. Delmolino, P. Saha, and A. Dutta, unpublished results. and extended the analysis to show that the Cy motif of HsCDC6 improves theK m of a CDC6-based peptide substrate of cdks by 100-fold (30Takeda D.Y. Wohlschlegel J.A. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1993-1997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).The results described here indicate a role for phosphorylation and NLS in the subcellular localization of HsCDC6. Both A4 and ΔCy mutants are limited to the nuclei only when the NLS are intact. However, disruption of each individual putative NLS results in a significant shift toward cytoplasm, 42 and 39% as compared with <10%. Mutation of both sites results in nearly complete inhibition of nuclear import. The addition of LMB, a CrmI nuclear export inhibitor, further demonstrates an incomplete block to nuclear import in individual NLS mutations. Because LMB did not significantly increase nuclear localization of A4Δ66–68, 80–81, we can eliminate the possibility that these mutations merely enhance nuclear export and thereby increase cytoplasmic localization. The results presented here support the idea that HsCDC6 utilizes either of two NLSs to gain access to the nucleus.We show here that mutation of either serine 54 or 74 to phosphate-mimicking aspartates results in cytoplasmic localization of HsCDC6. This is not an effect of blocking nuclear import, because we see nuclear localization of the D4 mutant when cells are treated with LMB, suggesting D4 cycles in and out of the nucleus. In addition, we see nuclear staining in cells transfected with truncated D4 mutants (D-364T and D-462T), suggesting that the NLS sequences are functional despite the localized increase in negative charges mimicking phosphorylation. Also, we show that phosphorylation and export of HsCDC6 does not depend upon a continued association with cyclin A/cdk, because the elimination of the cyclin-interacting Cy motif on the ΔD4 mutant does not abolish cytoplasmic localization.In addition, we identify a leucine-rich C-terminal NES. On the basis of reports of other proteins containing both NLS and NES motifs, shuttling from one compartment to the other continues to occur until one of the motifs is masked whether by phosphorylation, association with other proteins, or other modification. Our working hypothesis is that HsCDC6 is synthesized and imported into the nucleus in an NLS-dependent manner, whereby it binds ORC and begins assembly of the prereplicative complex. Upon phosphorylation, possibly by cyclin A/cdk, HsCDC6 is released from the prereplicative complex and is exported from the nucleus via its NES. It is possible that conformational changes induced by phosphorylation of HsCDC6 allow the unmasking of the C-terminal NES required for nuclear export.Phosphorylation of HsCDC6 was expected to be linked with origin firing. Therefore, the A4 mutant might have acted as a dominant negative protein, which causes a block to origin firing. It is surprising that A4 does not cause a block in G1/S. Although this result is consistent with the results of Petersen, et al. (21Petersen B.O. Lukas J. Sorensen C.S. Bartek J. Helin K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 396-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), it is possible that levels of exogenously expressed A4 is lower than endogenous HsCDC6, thus allowing origin firing by endogenous HsCDC6. Further, as in yeast, very few origins may need to fire per chromosome for complete and rapid replication of the genome (31Newlon C.S. Collins I. Dershowitz A. Deshpande A.M. Greenfeder S.A. Ong L.Y. Theis J.F. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Therefore, we cannot yet state that the failure to phosphorylate HsCDC6 is without any effect on the replication machinery, particularly in view of the effects on replication seen in other experimental systems with similar mutants (22Jiang W. Wells N.J. Hunter T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6193-6198Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 32Herbig U. Griffith J.W. Fanning E. Mol. Biol.

This idea is supported by studies from our laboratory and others that demonstrate that epitope-tagged HA-HsCDC6 is found to be nuclear in G1 cells and cytoplasmic in S phase cells (19Saha P. Chen J.

We show that HsCDC6 contains two putative N-terminal NLSs and a leucine-rich C-terminal nuclear export signal (NES), LXXXLXXLXL (reviewed in Ref. 23Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Previous reports of other proteins containing both nuclear import and export motifs describe protein shuttling from one compartment to the other until one of the motifs is masked, whether by phosphorylation, association with other proteins, or other modification (24Komeili A. O'Shea E.K. Science. 1999; 284: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 25Zhu J. Shibasaki F. Price R. Guillemot J.C. Yano T. Dotsch V. Wagner G. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Cell. 1998; 93: 851-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Our working hypothesis is that HsCDC6 is synthesized and imported into the nucleus in an NLS-dependent manner, whereby it binds ORC and begins assembly of the prereplicative complex. Unbound (excess) HsCDC6 continues to shuttle. Upon phosphorylation of HsCDC6, possibly by cyclin A/cdk, HsCDC6 is released from the prereplicative complex, whereby it becomes available for export from the nucleus via its NES. Here we show that HsCDC6 is phosphorylated by cyclin/cdksin vitro via association with cyclin/cdks through the Cy motif and becomes dephosphorylated in G1 and phosphorylated at the G1/S transition in vivo. A functional Cy motif and intact phosphorylation sites are required for the cytoplasmic displacement of HsCDC6 in S phase. Furthermore, conversion of the cyclin/cdk-targeted serines (SPXK) to phosphate-mimicking aspartic acid resulted in nearly exclusive cytoplasmic localization of the protein during G1 phase when cdk is inactive. Together these results indicate that dephosphorylated HsCDC6 localizes to the nucleus through the action of either of two NLSs, is phosphorylated at the G1/S border, whereby HsCDC6 relocates to the cytoplasm, possibly through the unmasking of the NES. DISCUSSIONOur laboratory and others (19Saha P. Chen J. Thome K.C. Lawlis S.J. Hou Z.H. Hendricks M. Parvin J.D. Dutta A. Mol. Cell.

We also showed cell cycle-specific association of cyclin A/cdk2 with HsCDC6 (19Saha P. Chen J. Thome K.C. Lawlis S.J. Hou Z.H. Hendricks M. Parvin J.D. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2758-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). We show here that endogenous HsCDC6 is phosphorylated at the G1/S border, a finding temporally consistent with cyclin A expression, origin firing, and the redistribution of HsCDC6 to the cytoplasm. In addition, we investigate the role of this phosphorylation in HsCDC6 localization through mutational analysis of 1) the four putative cyclin/cdk phosphorylation sites, 2) the cyclin-docking motif, Cy, 3) N-terminal nuclear localization signals, and 4) a C-terminal nuclear export signal. It was reported previously that HsCDC6 is phosphorylated on serines 54, 74, and 106 by cyclin/cdks (21Petersen B.O. Lukas J. Sorensen C.S. Bartek J. Helin K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 396-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 22Jiang W. Wells N.J. Hunter T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6193-6198Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). We have similar results 2L. M. Delmolino, P. Saha, and A. Dutta, unpublished results. and extended the analysis to show that the Cy motif of HsCDC6 improves theK m of a CDC6-based peptide substrate of cdks by 100-fold (30Takeda D.Y. Wohlschlegel J.A. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1993-1997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).The results described here indicate a role for phosphorylation and NLS in the subcellular localization of HsCDC6. Both A4 and ΔCy mutants are limited to the nuclei only when the NLS are intact. However, disruption of each individual putative NLS results in a significant shift toward cytoplasm, 42 and 39% as compared with <10%. Mutation of both sites results in nearly complete inhibition of nuclear import. The addition of LMB, a CrmI nuclear export inhibitor, further demonstrates an incomplete block to nuclear import in individual NLS mutations. Because LMB did not significantly increase nuclear localization of A4Δ66–68, 80–81, we can eliminate the possibility that these mutations merely enhance nuclear export and thereby increase cytoplasmic localization. The results presented here support the idea that HsCDC6 utilizes either of two NLSs to gain access to the nucleus.We show here that mutation of either serine 54 or 74 to phosphate-mimicking aspartates results in cytoplasmic localization of HsCDC6. This is not an effect of blocking nuclear import, because we see nuclear localization of the D4 mutant when cells are treated with LMB, suggesting D4 cycles in and out of the nucleus. In addition, we see nuclear staining in cells transfected with truncated D4 mutants (D-364T and D-462T), suggesting that the NLS sequences are functional despite the localized increase in negative charges mimicking phosphorylation. Also, we show that phosphorylation and export of HsCDC6 does not depend upon a continued association with cyclin A/cdk, because the elimination of the cyclin-interacting Cy motif on the ΔD4 mutant does not abolish cytoplasmic localization.In addition, we identify a leucine-rich C-terminal NES. On the basis of reports of other proteins containing both NLS and NES motifs, shuttling from one compartment to the other continues to occur until one of the motifs is masked whether by phosphorylation, association with other proteins, or other modification. Our working hypothesis is that HsCDC6 is synthesized and imported into the nucleus in an NLS-dependent manner, whereby it binds ORC and begins assembly of the prereplicative complex. Upon phosphorylation, possibly by cyclin A/cdk, HsCDC6 is released from the prereplicative complex and is exported from the nucleus via its NES. It is possible that conformational changes induced by phosphorylation of HsCDC6 allow the unmasking of the C-terminal NES required for nuclear export.Phosphorylation of HsCDC6 was expected to be linked with origin firing. Therefore, the A4 mutant might have acted as a dominant negative protein, which causes a block to origin firing. It is surprising that A4 does not cause a block in G1/S. Although this result is consistent with the results of Petersen, et al. (21Petersen B.O. Lukas J. Sorensen C.S. Bartek J. Helin K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 396-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), it is possible that levels of exogenously expressed A4 is lower than endogenous HsCDC6, thus allowing origin firing by endogenous HsCDC6. Further, as in yeast, very few origins may need to fire per chromosome for complete and rapid replication of the genome (31Newlon C.S. Collins I. Dershowitz A. Deshpande A.M. Greenfeder S.A. Ong L.Y. Theis J.F. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Therefore, we cannot yet state that the failure to phosphorylate HsCDC6 is without any effect on the replication machinery, particularly in view of the effects on replication seen in other experimental systems with similar mutants (22Jiang W.

Fluxes were calculated using tracer dilution techniques and mass isotopomer distribution analysis in plasma glucose and urinary paracetamol-glucuronide after infusion of [U-13C]glucose, [2-13C]glycerol, [1-2H]galactose, and paracetamol. In hepatocytes, glucose-6-phosphate (Glc-6-P) content, net glycogen synthesis, and lactate production from glucose and dihydroxyacetone increased strongly in the presence of S4048 (10 µm). In livers of S4048-treated rats (0.5 mg kg−1 min−1; 8 h) Glc-6-P content increased strongly (+440%), and massive glycogen accumulation (+1260%) was observed in periportal areas. Total glucose production was diminished by 50%. The gluconeogenic flux to Glc-6-P was unaffected (i.e. 33.3 ± 2.0 versus33.2 ± 2.9 µmol kg−1min−1 in control and S4048-treated rats, respectively). Newly synthesized Glc-6-P was redistributed from glucose production (62 ± 1 versus 38 ± 1%;p < 0.001) to glycogen synthesis (35 ± 5%versus 65 ± 5%; p < 0.005) by S4048. This was associated with a strong inhibition (−82%) of the flux through glucokinase and an increase (+83%) of the flux through glycogen synthase, while the flux through glycogen phosphorylase remained unaffected. In livers from S4048-treated rats, mRNA levels of genes encoding Glc-6-P hydrolase (∼9-fold), Glc-6-P translocase (∼4-fold), glycogen synthase (∼7-fold) and L-type pyruvate kinase (∼ 4-fold) were increased, whereas glucokinase expression was almost abolished. In accordance with unaltered gluconeogenic flux, expression of the gene encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase was unaffected in the S4048-treated rats. Thus, acute inhibition of glucose-6-phosphatase activity by S4048 elicited 1) a repartitioning of newly synthesized Glc-6-P from glucose production into glycogen synthesis without affecting the gluconeogenic flux to Glc-6-P and 2) a cellular response aimed at maintaining cellular Glc-6-P homeostasis.

Glc-6-P is the shared intermediate of gluconeogenesis (see Fig. 1, I + IV) and glycogenolysis (Fig. 1, II) and is formed by glucokinase (GK)-mediated glucose phosphorylation (Fig. 1, III). Glc-6-P provides the substrate for glucose production by the liver, via hydrolysis by glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) (Fig. 1, IV). It serves as substrate for glycolysis (Fig. 1, V) and is the obligatory precursor for the synthesis of glycogen via UDP-glucose (Fig. 1, VI). Partitioning of newly synthesized Glc-6-P into glucose production, degradation via glycolysis, or storage as glycogen offers modes of autoregulating hepatic glucose production without affecting the rate of gluconeogenesis. Glc-6-P stimulates the activity of glycogen synthase (GS) b and of GS phosphatase (1Bollen M. Keppens S. Stalmans W. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Glc-6-P and/or its pentose-phosphate derivative xylulose 5-phosphate act as signaling compound in the control of gene expression (see Ref. 2Girard J. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 325-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholarfor a review). Recent data show that the effect of insulin on gene expression of hepatic enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism critically depends on concomitant intracellular metabolism of glucose (3Foretz M. Guichard C. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000; 96: 12737-12742Crossref Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 4Shimomura I. Bashkamov Y. Ikemoto S. Horton J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000; 96: 13656-13661Crossref Scopus (625) Google Scholar), supporting a sequence of events starting with the direct induction of GK expression by insulin. Enhanced activity of GK results in increased intracellular concentrations of Glc-6-P and/or xylulose 5-phosphate. This appears to be essential in the action of insulin on the stimulation of expression of genes involved in glucose production, glycolysis, and lipogenesis (e.g. the hydrolytic subunit of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PH), glucose transporter type 2 (GLUT2), liver-type pyruvate kinase ATP-citrate lyase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and fatty acid synthase (see Ref. 2Girard J. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 325-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar for a review). Since Glc-6-P participates in so many reactions in hepatic glucose metabolism, the relationship between hepatic glucose production and gluconeogenesis in vivo is very complex. A major problem in studying Glc-6-P partitioning in vivo resides in the choice of precursor, label, and isotopic model. In earlier studies, substrates labeled with 14C or 13C have been applied followed by determination of positional isotopomer distribution in either plasma glucose (5Consoli A. Kennedy F. Miles J. Gerich J. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 1303-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) or in urinaryN-phenylacetylglutamine (6Landau B.R. Schumann W.C. Chandramouli V. Magnusson I. Kumaran K. Wahren J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: E636-E647PubMed Google Scholar). Relative gluconeogenic fractions obtained in this way were converted into absolute rates of gluconeogenesis by multiplying with the plasma glucose turnover rate. With this method, the contribution of a particular substrate to the gluconeogenic flux directed into plasma glucose can be calculated. More recent methods estimate gluconeogenic flux from precursors directed to plasma glucose; these methods comprise 2H incorporation into specific positions in plasma glucose from2H2O (7Landau B.R. Wahren J. Chandramouli V. Schumann W.C. Ekberg K. Kalhan S.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 172-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) or incorporation of [2-13C]glycerol into mass isotopomers of plasma glucose (8Neese R.A. Schwarz J.-M. Faix D. Turner S. Letscher A. Vu D. Hellerstein M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14452-14463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 9Peroni O. Large V. Beylot M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: E516-E523PubMed Google Scholar). The development of an improved isotopic model based on the last method allows for the calculation of flux rates of newly synthesized Glc-6-P into plasma glucose as well as into glycogen (10Hellerstein M.K. Neese R.A. Linfoot P. Christiansen M. Turner S. Letscher A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1305-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In the latter model, incorporation of [2-13C]glycerol is measured in plasma glucose and urinary paracetamol-glucuronide (p-GlcUA), as markers of two major metabolic routes of Glc-6-P (e.g. hepatic glucose production and glycogen synthesis via UDP-glucose, respectively (Fig. 1, I + IV andI + VI, respectively). The obtained fractional contributions for plasma glucose and UDP-glucose (via p-GlcUA), respectively, are subsequently converted in absolute rates of gluconeogenic flux, directed to each of the compounds, by multiplying with the rates of appearance of plasma glucose and UDP-glucose (via p-GlcUA), respectively. After correction for exchange of newly synthesized Glc-6-P between plasma glucose and glycogen, via UDP-glucose, the total gluconeogenic flux into Glc-6-P is obtained. It should be realized, however, that the gluconeogenic flux into Glc-6-P thus obtained represents a minimal estimate, since the flux of Glc-6-P into glycolysis (Fig. 1, V) is not considered in this isotopic model. Using this isotopic model, we have studied the effects of acute pharmacological inhibition of G6Pase in vitro and in vivo on the rate of gluconeogenesis and on the partitioning of Glc-6-P. Recently, a novel class of chlorogenic acid derivatives has been developed that inhibit G6Pase activity by blocking glucose-6-phosphate translocase (G6PT) (11Hemmerle H. Burger H.-J. Below P. Schubert G. Rippel R. Schindler P.W. Paulus E. Herling A.W. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In experiments in anesthetized rats and perfused rat livers, it was demonstrated that these compounds inhibit hepatic glucose production and lower blood glucose concentration in a dose-dependent way (12Herling A.W. Burger H.-J. Schwab D. Hemmerle H. Below P. Schubert G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: G1087-G1093PubMed Google Scholar, 13Herling A.W. Burger H.-J. Schubert G. Hemmerle H. Schaefer H.-L. Kramer W. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 386: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We addressed the following questions. 1) Does inhibition of hepatic glucose production by G6PT blockade result in an inhibition of gluconeogenic flux into Glc-6-P and/or a change in the partitioning of Glc-6-P? 2) Does inhibition of G6PT acutely influence gene expression of enzymes involved in Glc-6-P metabolism?

Biochem. 1985; 148: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Incubations of freshly isolated hepatocytes (5–10 mg dry mass/ml) were carried out at 37 °C in closed 25-ml plastic scintillation vials containing 2 ml in Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate medium plus 10 mm sodium HEPES (pH 7.4) and, where indicated, either 10 mm dihydroxyacetone or 20 mm glucose as substrate; the gas phase was 95% O2 and 5% CO2 (v/v). Male Wistar rats (275 ± 14 g) were bred at the Central Animal Laboratory, University of Groningen (The Netherlands). The animals were housed in Plexiglas cages (25 × 25 × 30 cm), with a controlled light-dark regime (12 h dark and 12 h light) and had free access to water and food (RMH-B, Hope Farms BV, Woerden, The Netherlands). One week before the experiment the animals were equipped with two permanent heart catheters, one for infusion and one to draw blood samples, as described by Kuipers et al.(15Kuipers F. Havinga R. Bosschieter H. Toorop G.P. Hindriks F.R. Vonk R.J. Gastroenterology. 1985; 88: 403-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours before the start of the experiments, food was removed, but the animals had still free access to water. On the day of the experiment, the animals were placed in metabolic cages that allowed continuous collection of urine. The animals were infused with [U-13C]glucose (1.0 ± 0.1 µmol kg−1 min−1), [2-13C]glycerol (9.2 ± 0.5 µmol kg−1 min−1), [1-2H]galactose (4.7 ± 0.2 µmol kg−1 min−1), paracetamol (total dose: 212 ± 10 mg kg−1), and, where indicated, S4048 (total dose: 265 ± 13 mg kg−1) in a sterile isotonic solution consisting of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2) with Me2SO (6.1% v/v). Blood samples (200 µl) were drawn before the start of the infusion and 3, 6, 7, and 8 h thereafter. Timed urine samples were collected at hourly intervals. The blood samples were collected in heparin-containing tubes and centrifuged immediately. Plasma and urine samples were stored at −20 °C until analysis. At the end of the experiment, the animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital; a large blood sample was taken by heart puncture; and the liver was excised and weighed, and parts were frozen immediately in liquid N2. Glucose and lactate in hepatocyte incubations were determined in HClO4-extracted, KOH-neutralized samples with ATP, NADP+, hexokinase, and Glc-6-P dehydrogenase (glucose) and with NAD+ and lactate dehydrogenase (16Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., New York1974Google Scholar). The glycogen content of hepatocytes was measured as follows. Aliquots of cells were diluted with 4 volumes of ice-cold 0.9% NaCl with 10 mmMOPS (pH 7.4) and centrifuged. After removal of the clear supernatant, the pellets were dissolved in 0.1 m KOH and heated for 40 min at 85 °C. The solution was acidified to pH 4.5 with acetic acid (3 m) and centrifuged to remove the protein. To 100 µl of the supernatant 0.14 units of amyloglucosidase was added, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h at 40 °C. The glucose formed was measured fluorometrically as described (16Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., New York1974Google Scholar). Background glucose was measured in identically treated samples, without addition of amyloglucosidase (16Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., New York1974Google Scholar). For measurement of intracellular Glc-6-P, an aliquot of the cell suspension was diluted with 4 volumes of ice-cold 0.9% NaCl plus 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.4) and centrifuged for 1 s in a microcentrifuge. The cell pellet was immediately extracted with HClO4 (4%, w/v), and the precipitate was neutralized with a mixture of 2 m KOH and 0.5 mMOPS. Glc-6-P was determined fluorometrically with NADP+and Glc-6-P dehydrogenase (16Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., New York1974Google Scholar). Samples for measurement of glycogen and Glc-6-P of liver tissue were prepared by extracting liquid N2-cooled liver powder (about 100 mg wet weight) with either 1 ml of 0.1 m KOH (glycogen) or HClO4(4%, w/v; Glc-6-P); this was then followed by the same procedure as described above for hepatocytes. Plasma insulin was determined by a radioimmunoassay RI-13K (Linco Research, Inc., St Charles, MO). Plasma glucose concentration was determined enzymatically by use of the Beckman glucose analyzer II (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA). To visualize glycogen deposition in the liver, staining with PAS was performed on 4-µm-thick slices from frozen livers excised from the studied rats according to standard procedures. Total RNA was isolated from ∼30 mg of liver tissue using the Trizol method (Life Technologies, Inc.) followed by the SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the protocols provided by the manufacturer. Isolated total RNA was converted to single-stranded cDNA by a reverse transcription procedure with M-Mulv-RT (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For polymerase chain reaction amplification studies, amounts of cDNA corresponding to ∼30 ng of RNA were amplified with Taq DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and the appropriate forward and reverse primers (Life Technologies), essentially according to the manufacturer's protocols and optimized for the particular amplification cycler used. In the same experiments, calibration curves were run on serial dilutions of a 4× concentrated cDNA solution, resulting in a series containing 4×, 2×, 1×, 0.5×, 0.125×, 0.062×, and 0.031× of the cDNA present in the assay incubation. Gel electrophoresis of both assay and calibration incubations were done simultaneously. All gels were photographed with an Image Master VDS system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and intensities were quantified by video-scanning densitometry, using the software program Image Master 1D Elite 3.0 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All quantified intensities of experimental samples were within the linear part of the calibration curves. The following primer sequences were used: G6PH forward primer (ACT TTG GGA TCC AGT CGA CT) and reverse primer (ACA GCA ATG CCT GAC AAG AC); G6PT forward primer (ATG AGA TCG CTC TGG ACA AG) and reverse primer (TTC GGA GTC CAA CAT CAG CA); GK forward primer (GTG GGC TTC ACC TTC TCC TT) and reverse primer (TCA CCA TTG CCA CCA CAT CC); GLUT2 forward primer (GGA TCT GCT CAC ATA GTC AC) and reverse primer (TCT GGA CAG AAG AGC AGT AG); GS forward primer (CCA ATT CCA TGA ATG GCA GG) and reverse primer (GCC TGG ATA AGG ATT CTA GG); GP forward primer (GAG ACT ACA TTC AGG CTG TG) and reverse primer (CTA GCT CAC TGA AGT CCT TG); liver-type pyruvate kinase forward primer (TAC ATT GAC GAC GGG CTC AT) and reverse primer (ATG CTC TCC AGC ATC TGT GT); PEP-CK forward primer (GCC AGG ATC GAA AGC AAG AC) and reverse primer (CCA GTT GTT GAC CAA AGG CT); and β-actin forward primer (AAC ACC CCA GCC ATG TAC G) and reverse primer (ATG TCA CGC ACG ATT TCC C). Fifty microliters of plasma was deproteinized by adding 500 µl of ice-cold ethanol. The mixture was placed on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged. The supernatant was divided into two equal portions. Each portion was transferred to a reaction vial with a Teflon-faced cap and dried by evaporation at 60 °C under N2. After cooling down, the first portion was derivatized to glucose pentaacetate by adding 150 µl of pyridine/acetic anhydride (1:2) (v/v) to the dry residue and incubating for 30 min at 60 °C, followed by drying at 60 °C under N2. The dry residue was dissolved in 500 µl of ethyl acetate and transferred to an injection vial. The second portion was derivatized to glucose-aldonitrile-pentaacetate by adding 50 µl of pyridine containing hydroxylamine (2%; v/v) to the dry residue and incubating for 45 min at 100 °C. After cooling, 100 µl of acetic anhydride was added, and the mixture was incubated for another 30 min at 60 °C, followed by drying at 60 °C under N2. The dry residue was dissolved in 500 µl of ethyl acetate and transferred to an injection vial. For isolation of p-GlcUA, urine samples (0.5 ml) were centrifuged to remove any debris, and the supernatant was injected onto a Nucleosil 7C18 SP250/10 column. The high pressure liquid chromatography system consisted of a Milton Roy CM4000 pump and a Milton Roy SM4000 variable wavelength ultraviolet detector (Interscience, Breda, The Netherlands). Millennium software (Waters, Etten Leur, The Netherlands) was used for peak integration. To achieve base-line separation of the p-GlcUA peak, a two-buffer gradient program was applied consisting of buffer A containing 2% (w/v) ammonium formate in water (pH 4.8) and buffer B containing 40% CH3CN in water. The program started with 100% A and 0% B at 3.3 ml/min. At 10.7 min, the composition was changed to 92.5% A and 7.5% B within 0.1 min, and at 20 min buffer B was increased to 100% within 2 min. Under these conditions, the p-GlcUA peak eluted at 18.7 min, in a volume of 1.2 ml. The collected fraction was divided into two portions of 0.6 ml each. Each fraction was transferred to a Teflon-capped reaction vial, and both fractions were dried at 115 °C under N2. After cooling, p-GlcUA was derivatized to its tetratrimethylsilyl-ethyl ester by adding 400 µl of ethanol/acetylchloride, 10:1 (v/v), to the dry residue and incubating for 45 min at room temperature, followed by drying at 60 °C under N2. To the dry residue, 200 µl of BSTFA/pyridine/chlorotrimethylsilane (5:1:0.07 (v/v)) was added and incubated for 120 min at 90 °C. After drying, 1 ml of ethyl acetate was added. The dry residue of the second fraction was oxidized to saccharic acid by reacting with 35 µl of sodium nitrite (0.4 g/ml water) and 70 µl of nitric acid (32.5% in water) at 130 °C for 25 min, followed by drying at 60 °C under N2. After cooling, saccharic acid was derivatized to its tetraacetate-diethylester by adding 400 µl of ethanol/acetylchloride (10:1 (v/v)) and incubating for 45 min at room temperature, followed by drying at 60 °C under N2. To the dry residue, 150 µl of pyridine/acetic anhydride (1:2 (v/v)) was added and incubated for 30 min at 60 °C, followed by drying at 60 °C under N2. The dry residue was dissolved in 50 µl of ethyl acetate and transferred to an injection vial. All samples were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Derivatives were separated on a HP 5890 gas chromatograph (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA) using an AT-5 20 m × 0.18 mm inner diameter (0.4-µm film thickness) capillary column (Alltech, Breda, the Netherlands). The GC temperature profile for p-GlcUA tetratrimethylsilyl-ethyl ester was as follows: the initial temperature was 250 °C for 2 min and rose then to 280 °C at a rate of 25 °C/min. The column was held at 280 °C for 10 min. The compound eluted at 10.0 min. Them/z 331–337 ions, representing them 0–m 6 mass isotopomers, were monitored in electron impact mode. The same gas chromatography temperature profile was used for glucose-pentaacetate, glucose-aldonitrile-pentaacetate, and saccharic acid tetraacetate-diethyl ester derivatives. The initial temperature was 80 °C for 1 min and rose then to 280 °C at a rate of 20 °C/min. The column was held at 280 °C for 5 min. The compounds eluted at 8.1, 10.6, and 10.9 min, respectively. Chemical ionization with methane was used. The ions monitored for glucose-pentaacetate werem/z 331–337, corresponding to them 0–m 6 mass isotopomers. The ions monitored for glucose-aldonitrile-pentaacetate werem/z 328–334, corresponding to them 0–m 6 mass isotopomers. The ions monitored for saccharic acid tetraacetate-diethyl ester werem/z 375–381, corresponding to them 0–m 6 mass isotopomers. The accuracy of the measurement was checked by injection of a standard sample after every eight experimental samples. The series were rejected when the reproducibility of the measurement of the standard sample was less than 1% for m 0 and less than 2% form 1 and m 2. To check the range of intensities at the m/z values that allows for reproducible analyses, dilution series were routinely made. Metabolic fluxes at steady state were calculated essentially according to Hellerstein et al. (10Hellerstein M.K. Neese R.A. Linfoot P. Christiansen M. Turner S. Letscher A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1305-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The isotopic model of hepatic glucose metabolism is very similar to the one shown in Fig. 1, with the exception that glycolysis (Fig. 1,V) is absent. In this model, two metabolic pathways give rise to plasma glucose and hepatic UDP-glucose formation,i.e. the gluconeogenic flux to Glc-6-P (Fig. 1,I) and glycogenolysis (Fig. 1, II). At steady state, glycogenesis (Fig. 1,VI) equals the formation of UDP-glucose (17Magnusson I. Rothman D.L. Jucker B. Cline G.W. Shulman R.G. Shulman G.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: E796-E803PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hellerstein M.K. Metabolism. 2000; 49: 1375-1378Google Scholar). Rates of appearance of glucose into the plasma glucose pool (Ra(glc)) and into the UDP-glucose pool (Ra(UDPglc); via p-GlcUA) were calculated by isotope dilution (19Wolfe R.R. Principles and Practice of Kinetic Analysis. 2nd Ed. Wiley-Liss, New York1992: 117-132Google Scholar) as follows, Ra(glc)=(MPE(glc;m6)infuse/MPE(glc;m6)plasma−1)(Eq. 1) ×infusion(glc;m6)in which MPE(glc;m6)infuse and MPE(glc;m6)plasma are the mole percent enrichments of [U-13C]glucose in the infusate and plasma, respectively, and infusion(glc;m6) is the infusion rate of [U-13C]-glucose, and the following,Ra(UDPglc)=(MPE(gal;m1)infuse/MPE(pGlcUA;m1)urine−1)×infusion(gal;m1)(Eq. 2) in which MPE(gal;m1)infuse and MPE(pGlcUA;m1)urine are the mole percent enrichments of [1-2H]galactose in the infusate and p-GlcUA in urine, respectively, and infusion(gal;m1) is the infusion rate of [1-2H]galactose. Ra(UDPglc) was calculated based on the assumption of a constant and complete entry of galactose into the hepatic UDP-glucose pool and that the label distribution in urinary p-GlcUA reflects the label distribution in UDP-glucose. The contribution of recycling should be added to these rates of appearance to obtain the total rates of appearance (10Hellerstein M.K. Neese R.A. Linfoot P. Christiansen M. Turner S. Letscher A. J.

For the calculation of recycling, two correction factors are introduced (10Hellerstein M.K. Neese R.A. Linfoot P. Christiansen M. Turner S. Letscher A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1305-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar): the fractional contribution of plasma glucose to UDP-glucose formation c(glc),c(glc)=MPE(pGlcUA;m6)urine/MPE(glc;m6)plasma(Eq. 3) in which MPE(pGlcUA;m6)urine and MPE(glc;m6)plasma are the mole percent enrichments of urinary p-GlcUA and plasma glucose, respectively, during an infusion of [U-13C]glucose and the fractional contribution of UDP-glucose to plasma glucose formation c(UDPglc),c(UDPglc)=MPE(glc;m1)plasma/MPE(pGlcUA;m1)urine(Eq. 4) in which MPE(glc;m1)plasma and MPE(pGlcUA;m1)urine are the mole percent enrichments of urinary p-GlcUA and plasma glucose, respectively, during an infusion of [1-2H]galactose. Recycling of glucose (r(glc)) and UDP-glucose (r(UDPglc)) were calculated according to the following,r(glc)=(c(glc)/(1−c(glc)))×Ra(glc)(Eq. 5) which is also a measure of glucose/Glc-6-P cycling (10Hellerstein M.K.

Although NO is produced by macrophages after LPS treatment, NO is not involved in these regulatory responses because LPS up-regulated CNT1 and CNT2 transport activity and expression in macrophages from inducible nitric oxide synthase and cationic amino acid transporter (CAT) 2 knock-out mice, both of which lack inducible nitric oxide synthesis. These data indicate that the early proapoptotic responses of macrophages, involving the up-regulation of CNT transporters, follow redundant regulatory pathways in which TNF-α-dependent- and -independent mechanisms are involved.

The effect on TNF-α production appears to be exerted at the transcriptional level and is partly specific because it does not modify the production of other cytokines such as interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 (8Sajjadi F.G. Takabayashi K. Foster A.C. Domingo R.C. Firestein G.S. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3435-3442PubMed Google Scholar). In primary cultures of murine bone marrow macrophages, adenosine, through its interaction with A2B receptors, blocks the IFN-γ-induced expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and TNF-α (20Xaus J. Mirabet M. Lloberas J. Soler C. Lluis C. Franco R. Celada A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3607-3614PubMed Google Scholar). However, the expression of this specific receptor is also up-regulated by IFN-γ, thus contributing to a feedback mechanism for the fine tuning of macrophage activation/deactivation processes (20Xaus J. Mirabet M. Lloberas J. Soler C. Lluis C. Franco R. Celada A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3607-3614PubMed Google Scholar). A similar complex network may also apply to the actions of nucleotides. ATP can also block the release of TNF-α from macrophages activated by LPS and IFN-γ (7Denlinger L.C. Fisette P.L. Garis K.A. Kwon G. Vázquez-Torres A. Simon A.D. Nguyen B. Proctor R.A. Bertics P.J.

Nevertheless, these two agents also up-regulate the synthesis of the P2Z/P2X7 receptor for ATP (22Humphreys B.D. Dubyak G.R. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5627-5637PubMed Google Scholar), which is again consistent with the idea of feedback mechanisms contributing to deactivation in macrophages. The actions of extracellular nucleotides may be partially mediated by their catabolites, which are generated by the action of extracellular nucleotidases and lead to the synthesis of adenosine. Similarly, adenosine catabolites such as inosine may mimic some of the effects of this nucleoside (23Hasko G. Kuhel D.G. Nemeth Z.H. Mabley J.G. Stachlewitz R.F. Virag L. Lohinai Z. Southan G.J. Salzman A.L. Szabo C. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1013-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Although some of these actions may require the extracellular presence of nucleosides, others appear to involve uptake into the cell (12Hasko G. Kuhel D.G. Chen J.F. Schwarzschild M.A. Deitch E.A. Mabley J.G. Marton A. Szabo C. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2065-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 17Rahtbone M.P. Middlemiss P.J. Gysbers J.W. Andrew C. Herman M.A. Reed J.K.

Considering that nucleoside transport is necessary either to generate active metabolites intracellularly or to modulate adenosine availability to its receptors, nucleoside transporters may be elements of these regulatory networks, which are key determinants of macrophage activation during septic shock. Recently we have characterized the nucleoside transporters in murine bone marrow macrophages (50Soler, C., Garcı́a-Manteiga, J., Valdés, R., Casado, F. J., Pastor-Anglada, M., Celada, A., and Felipe, A. (2001) FASEB J., in press.Google Scholar). This cell type basically expresses an es-type nucleoside transport system, which presumably corresponds to the expression of the murine ENT1 gene, and two concentrative nucleoside transporters of the cit andcib type, which are the result of the co-expression of the pyrimidine- and purine-preferring transporters CNT1 and CNT2. Most of the kinetic and molecular properties of these and other nucleoside transporters cloned so far have recently been reviewed (24Wang J. Schaner M.E. Thomassen S. Su S.F. Piquette-Miller M.

Biol. 2001; 18: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Nucleoside transporter expression is highly regulated in epithelial cell types, such as hepatocytes, by cell cycle progression and differentiation (29Pastor-Anglada M. Casado F.J. Valdés R. Mata J. Garcı́a-Manteiga J. Molina M. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 30Pastor-Anglada M. Felipe A. Casado F.J. del Santo B. Mata J.F. Valdés R. Biochem.

Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1504-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In murine bone marrow macrophages, the stimulation of cell proliferation by MCSF is related to a selective up-regulation of the ENT1 transporter, whereas treatment of these cells with IFN-γ results in the inhibition of cell proliferation and ENT1 induction at a time when this triggers the expression of the two CNT transporters, CNT1 and CNT2 (50Soler, C., Garcı́a-Manteiga, J., Valdés, R., Casado, F. J., Pastor-Anglada, M., Celada, A., and Felipe, A. (2001) FASEB J., in press.Google Scholar). On the basis of this evidence, we wondered whether treatment of murine bone marrow macrophages with the proapoptotic agent LPS would modulate nucleoside transporter expression. If this were the case, it might help us understand how these plasma membrane proteins contribute to the regulation of macrophage activation and apoptosis. Essentially, this study shows that LPS selectively up-regulates the CNT1 and CNT2 transporters. This response is not dependent on the presence of MCSF, although LPS blocks the up-regulation of the es transport system it triggers. LPS treatment of murine bone marrow macrophages resulted in the early expression of TNF-α and the subsequent synthesis of iNOS. TNF-α triggers early apoptotic events in these primary cultures because early programmed cell death is blocked in LPS-treated macrophages isolated from TNF-α receptor I knock-out mice. NO does not appear to be involved in the up-regulation of CNT transporters because macrophages isolated from mice lacking inducible NO synthesis (iNOS and CAT2 knock-out mice) still respond to LPS. However, TNF-α was shown to mimic the effects of LPS on nucleoside transporters. Nevertheless, the evidence that macrophages isolated from TNF-α receptor I knock-out mice still respond to LPS treatment indicates that the early proapoptotic responses of macrophages involving CNT nucleoside transporters are regulated by redundant pathways in which TNF-α-dependent and -independent mechanisms participate. Bone marrow macrophages were obtained as described previously (32Celada A. Gray P.W. Rinderknecht E. Schreiber R.D. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 55-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) from the femurs of 6–10-week-old BALB/c mice. The ends of the bones were cut, and the marrow was irrigated with culture medium to obtain a suspension, which was then passed through an 18-gauge needle to desegregate the cells for subsequent culture. Cell culture was performed on 150-mm Petri dishes in 40 ml of high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% fetal calf serum (Sigma) and 30% L cell-conditioned medium as a source of MCSF. Dishes were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere until confluence for 7–8 days. These cultures turned out to be fully differentiated homogeneous populations of adherent macrophages suitable for further experiments in which cells were either cultured in the same medium or starved of MCSF by keeping them in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for at least 18 h. In these conditions the cell cycle was arrested at G0. Cells were then incubated either with or without MCSF (1200 units/ml) either in the presence or in the absence of LPS (100 ng/ml) for the indicated times (see below). In some experiments, cells cultured either in the presence or in the absence of MCSF were exposed to TNF-α (100 ng/ml). Recombinant murine TNF-α was obtained from PrepoTech EC (London, UK). LPS was purchased from Sigma and recombinant murine MCSF from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Bone marrow macrophages isolated from three knock-out mouse strains were also used in this study. iNOS knock-out mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). The TNF-α receptor I knock-out mice were generated and characterized as reported (33Rothe J. Lessiauer W. Lötscher H. Lang Y. Koebel P. Köntgen F. Althuge A. Zinkernagel R. Steinmetz M. Bluethmann H. Nature. 1993; 364: 798-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). Functional inducible NO knock-out mice generated by disrupting the arginine transporter CAT2 gene (34Nicholson B. Manner K. Kleeman J. MacLeod C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15881-15885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) were also used to complement the data obtained with the iNOS knock-out animals. Low molecular weight apoptotic DNA, obtained as described previously (4Xaus J. Comalada M. Valledor A.F. Lloberas J. López-Soriano F. Argilés J.M. Bogdan C. Celada A. Blood. 2000; 95: 3823-3831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Cell Death Detection, ELISA Plus;Roche Molecular Biochemicals) that is directed against cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments. Each point was performed in triplicate, and the results are expressed as the mean ± S. D. DNA synthesis was quantified by measuring the incorporation of tritiated thymidine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) into DNA as described previously (35Xaus J. Carbó M. Valledor A. Soler C. Lloberas J. Celada A. Immunity. 1999; 11: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). For this purpose cells were grown on 24-well tissue culture plates in 1 ml of medium without MCSF for at least 18 h. The cells were then cultured in the presence of MCSF and, at the desired times, the medium was removed and replaced by 0.5 ml of the same buffer but containing 1 µCi/ml [3H]thymidine. Cells were incubated for 3 h and then fixed in 70% methanol, washed three times in ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, and solubilized in 1% SDS and 0.3% NaOH prior to radioactivity counting. RNA synthesis was monitored in a similar way but with tritiated uridine as substrate. The number of viable cells was assessed by trypan blue exclusion with a hemocytometer. Transport experiments were performed on 35-mm tissue culture dishes in which macrophages had been seeded after growing for 7 days in the 150-mm flasks. Uptake measurements were performed as described previously (31del Santo B. Valdés R. Mata J. Felipe A. Casado F.J. Pastor-Anglada M. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1504-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. [5,6-3H]uridine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was routinely used as substrate at a concentration of 1 µm. Na+-dependent transport was monitored by determining uridine uptake in either 137 mm NaCl or 137 mm choline chloride uptake medium as described (31del Santo B. Valdés R. Mata J. Felipe A. Casado F.J. Pastor-Anglada M. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1504-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The relative contribution of the N1 transport system (CNT2-related) to the Na+-dependent component of transport was assessed by inhibiting uridine uptake by saturating concentrations of formycin B, an N2 substrate. The formycin B-resistant component of the Na+-dependent uridine transport is accounted for by the N2 transport system (CNT1-related). Three-min incubations were routinely performed because they reflect linear velocity conditions and provide enough sensitivity for cis-inhibition analysis. The dishes were washed three times in 2 ml of a cold stop buffer consisting of 137 mm NaCl and 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4. Cells were then incubated with 0.5 ml of 0.5% Triton X-100 to allow disaggregation, and the resulting extract was used for radioactivity counting and protein determination following the Bradford technique (Bio-Rad). Total RNA (20 µg) isolated from macrophages using the Rneasy Mini kit from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany) was separated in 1% agarose with 20 mmMOPS, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, and 3% formaldehyde buffer. The RNA was transferred overnight onto an Immobilon filter (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and cross-linked by irradiation with UV light. Filters were treated, prehybridized, and hybridized as described previously (31del Santo B. Valdés R. Mata J. Felipe A. Casado F.J. Pastor-Anglada M.

The CNT2 and ENT1 probes corresponded to the rat cDNA fragments comprising nucleotides 776–1465 and 5–1375, respectively. Labeled probes were generated by random priming using [α-32P]dCTP and routinely used at 106cpm/ml. After high stringency washing (31del Santo B. Valdés R. Mata J. Felipe A. Casado F.J.

Loading and transfer controls were routinely used in all the experiments. Loading was assessed by including ethidium bromide in the samples to be run on the gels, whereas the 18 S RNA was used as a transfer control, as shown below. Cell extracts for Western blot analysis were obtained after washing the cells twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline followed by lysis in 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl, supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture consisting of 1 µg/ml aprotinin, 1 µg/ml leupeptin, 86 µg/ml iodoacetamide, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Protein was determined following the Bradford technique (Bio-Rad). Protein samples (20 µg) were incubated for 6 min at 95 °C prior to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred onto filters (Immobilon-P, Millipore, New Bedford, MA), which were then blocked in a 5% dry milk-supplemented 0.2% Tween 20, phosphate-buffered saline prior to immunoreaction. To monitor CNT1 expression, a monospecific rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against an N terminus fragment (residues 45–67) of the corresponding rat horthologue was used (37Felipe A. Valdés R. del Santo B. Lloberas J. Casado F.J. Pastor-Anglada M. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 997-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 38Dragan Y. Valdés R. Gómez-Angelats M. Felipe A. Casado F.J. Pitot H. Pastor-Anglada M. Hepatology. 2000; 32: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This antibody specifically cross-reacted with the murine transporter as described previously (50Soler, C., Garcı́a-Manteiga, J., Valdés, R., Casado, F. J., Pastor-Anglada, M., Celada, A., and Felipe, A. (2001) FASEB J., in press.Google Scholar). To monitor the expression of iNOS, a commercial rabbit antibody against mouse iNOS (M-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was used. As a loading and transfer control for this technique, a mouse anti-mouse β-actin antibody (Sigma) was used. Treatment of murine bone marrow macrophages with LPS significantly decreased the cell number and induced the fragmentation of DNA and blockade of thymidine incorporation into DNA in 6 h (Fig. 1). The early apoptotic events triggered by LPS were mediated by the autocrine production of TNF-α by macrophages because cells isolated from TNF-α receptor I knock-out mice were protected from apoptosis after LPS treatment (Fig. 1). The late phase of apoptosis after 12 h of LPS treatment was shown previously to be NO-dependent (4Xaus J. Comalada M. Valledor A.F. Lloberas J. López-Soriano F. Argilés J.M. Bogdan C. Celada A. Blood. 2000; 95: 3823-3831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and occurs more slowly than the initial one. Both proliferating and apoptosing macrophages required extracellular nucleosides for RNA synthesis (Fig. 1). Murine bone marrow macrophages showed at least three nucleoside transport activities that correspond to the co-expression of the es-related transporter ENT1 and the Na+-dependent transporters N1 (CNT2) and N2 (CNT1). This was assessed not only by the detection of the biological activity of these systems but also by the presence of either the mRNA (as for ENT1 and CNT2) or the protein (as for CNT1) (see Fig.3). LPS selectively up-regulated the N1 and N2 transport systems irrespective of whether the macrophages had been MCSF-starved (Fig.2). This suggests that the up-regulation of the concentrative nucleoside transporters is independent of the proliferative stimulus triggered by MCSF. However, the up-regulation of the es transport system triggered by MCSF was almost completely blocked by LPS, thus suggesting that the inhibition of macrophage proliferation associated with cell activation and apoptosis does not require enhanced es transport activity, although cell proliferation does, as described previously (50Soler, C., Garcı́a-Manteiga, J., Valdés, R., Casado, F. J., Pastor-Anglada, M., Celada, A., and Felipe, A. (2001) FASEB J., in press.Google Scholar).Figure 2Up-regulation of CNT-type nucleoside transport activity and down-regulation of es transport in LPS-treated macrophages. Macrophages were growth-arrested by culturing them for 18 h in the absence of MCSF. Cells were then induced to proliferate by MCSF or incubated in the absence of the growth factor for 24 h, either in the absence (open bars) or in the presence (solid bars) of LPS. At this point, Na+-dependent uridine (1 µm) transport activity associated with N1 and N2 transport systems (CNT2 and CNT1 transporters, respectively), as well as the Na+-independent ENT1-related transport activityes, were measured, as indicated under “Materials and Methods.” Data are the mean ± S.E. of triplicate observations in three independent experiments. prot, protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The time course of these events is relatively short (Fig.3). CNT2 mRNA amounts increased only 3 h after LPS treatment (Fig. 3, c and d), which suggests that CNT2 is one of the genes that may switch on during the early phase of LPS-induced apoptosis of murine bone marrow macrophages. The transient accumulation of CNT2 mRNA shown in Fig. 3, c and d is consistent with the transcriptional activation of this gene resulting in de novosynthesis of CNT2 transporters and high activity of the N1 transport system, as detected 24 h after LPS treatment (Fig. 2). Similarly, the amounts of CNT1 protein are significantly higher than control macrophages as early as 6 h after LPS treatment (Fig. 3,a and b), thus supporting the view that the two CNT transporters expressed in murine bone marrow macrophages are highly responsive to LPS-induced apoptosis and, if these regulatory responses were transcriptionally mediated, their genes should switch on relatively quickly after treatment with the lipopolysaccharide. The decrease in es transport activity found in LPS-treated macrophages in the presence of MCSF correlated with a progressive decrease in the ENT1 mRNA that occurred much more slowly than the changes recorded for the CNT2 mRNA (Fig. 3, c andd), which suggests that the regulatory response of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter mostly occurs during the second phase of LPS-induced apoptosis. LPS rapidly increased the expression of TNF-α in macrophages (Fig.4 a). As previously reported, this is immediately followed by the secretion of TNF-α, as deduced from the measurement of this cytokine in supernatants from LPS-treated macrophages (4Xaus J. Comalada M. Valledor A.F. Lloberas J. López-Soriano F. Argilés J.M. Bogdan C. Celada A. Blood. 2000; 95: 3823-3831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, iNOS synthesis takes longer to occur, which is in agreement with its role during the second phase of the LPS-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4 b). In fact, the iNOS protein was not detected 2 h after LPS treatment, which in principle would rule out a putative role for NO in the regulatory responses of the concentrative nucleoside transporters because the two CNT proteins appear to be up-regulated before iNOS synthesis occurs. The immediate autocrine production of TNF-α by LPS-stimulated macrophages suggests that this cytokine is involved in the regulatory responses of nucleoside transporters during the early phase of LPS-induced apoptosis. Thus, the activity of the three"

Previous studies have suggested a possible role for the low affinity receptor for immunoglobulin, FcγRIIA, in GPIb-IX-V signaling. Here we show that binding of vWF to platelets induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of FcγRIIA by a Src kinase. Treatment of platelets with the anti-FcγRIIA monoclonal antibody IV.3 specifically inhibits vWF-induced but not thrombin-induced pleckstrin phosphorylation and serotonin secretion. Moreover, vWF fails to induce pleckstrin phosphorylation in mouse platelets, lacking FcγRIIA, and serotonin secretion is impaired. Pleckstrin phosphorylation and serotonin secretion in human platelets stimulated with vWF are blocked by the cyclooxygenase inhibitor acetylsalicylic acid. However, release of arachidonic acid and synthesis of TxA2induced by vWF are not affected by the anti-FcγRIIA monoclonal antibody IV.3. Similarly, vWF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of FcγRIIA, as well as of Syk and PLCγ2, occurs normally in aspirinized platelets. Inhibition of the tyrosine kinase Syk by piceatannol does not affect vWF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of FcγRIIA but prevents phosphorylation of PLCγ2. Pleckstrin phosphorylation and platelet secretion induced by vWF, but not by thrombin, are also inhibited by piceatannol. Pleckstrin phosphorylation is also sensitive to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin.

Some of these events, such as the activation of PLC, have been demonstrated to be promoted by the secondary action of TxA2 produced from arachidonic acid through the cyclooxygenase pathway (2Kroll M.H. Harris T.S. Moake J.L. Handin R.I. Schafer A.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1568-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). For this reason, endogenous TxA2 is believed to play a central role in platelet activation by vWF. However, other events, such as the activation of some tyrosine kinases, are independent of endogenous TxA2 and are directly mediated by the interaction of vWF with GPIb-IX-V (4Asazuma N. Ozaki Y. Satoh K. Yatomi Y. Handa M. Fujimura Y. Miura S. Kume S. Blood. 1997; 90: 4789-4798Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although considerable progress has been made in understanding the molecular basis of vWF interaction with GPIb-IX-V, very little is known about the mechanism by which such interaction initiates signals leading to platelet activation. GPIb-IX-V is a member of the leucine-rich glycoprotein gene family and is composed of four different polypeptides, GPIbα, GPIbβ, GPIX, and GPV, at a ratio of 2:2:2:1 (8Ware J. Thromb. Haemost. 1998; 79: 466-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The complex is not associated to GTP-binding proteins, does not possess tyrosine kinase activity, and is not tyrosine-phosphorylated upon binding of vWF. The cytoplasmic domain of GPIb-IX-V can interact with the cytoskeleton through actin-binding protein, and with the signaling protein 14-3-3ζ, but the role of these molecules in GPIb-IX-V-mediated platelet activation is unclear (9Du X. Harris S.J. Tetaz T.J. Ginsberg M.H. Berndt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18287-18290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Cunningham J.C. Meyer S.C. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that recruitment of GPIb-IX-V by vWF or by the snake venom lectin alboaggregin-A leads to the tyrosine phosphorylation of the ITAM sequence of the Fc receptor γ-chain and to its interaction with the tyrosine kinase Syk, suggesting that immune receptors could participate in GPIb-IX-V signaling (11Falati S. Edmead C.E. Poole A.W. Blood. 1999; 94: 1648-1656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the Fc receptor γ-chain, human platelets express another ITAM-containing protein, the low affinity receptor for IgG, FcγRIIA (12Anderson C.L. Chacko G.W. Osborne J.M. Brandt J.T. Semin. Thromb. Hemost. 1995; 21: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that this 40-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein is involved in platelet activation following the recruitment of GPIb-IX-V. A physical association between the two receptors on the platelet membrane has been demonstrated by flow cytometric fluorescence energy transfer, co-immunoprecipitation, and yeast two-hybrid system (13Sullam P.M. Hyun W.C. Szollosi J. Dong J. Foss W.M. Lopez J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5331-5336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 14Sun B. Li J. Kambayashi J. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 24-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Moreover, evidence for a functional correlation between the two receptors arise from the observation that anti-GPIb antibodies could inhibit FcγRIIA-mediated platelet aggregation (13Sullam P.M. Hyun W.C. Szollosi J. Dong J. Foss W.M. Lopez J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5331-5336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Finally, we have previously demonstrated that the blockage of FcγRIIA prevents vWF-induced translocation of the small GTP-binding proteins rap1b and rap2b to the cytoskeleton and the tyrosine phosphorylation of selected substrates including the tyrosine kinase Syk and PLCγ2 (7Torti M. Bertoni A. Canobbio I. Sinigaglia F. Lapetina E.G. Balduini C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13690-13697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In this work we further investigate the functional interplay between FcγRIIA and GPIb-IX-V in vWF-stimulated platelets. We show that FcγRIIA is actually tyrosine phosphorylated upon vWF binding to platelets by a mechanism independent of TxA2 production. Moreover, blockage of FcγRIIA by a specific mAb prevents PLC activation and platelets secretion induced by vWF under conditions in which the production of TxA2 occurs normally. These results indicate that, in addition to endogenous TxA2, FcγRIIA plays an essential role in platelet activation by vWF. Sepharose CL-2B was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Thrombin, ristocetin, botrocetin, acetylsalicylic acid, indomethacin, piceatannol, wortmannin, protein A-Sepharose, and mouse IgG were from Sigma. PP1 was purchased from Alexis. von Willebrand Factor (Hemate P) was obtained from Behringwerke (Marburg, Germany). [32P]orthophosphate, [14C]serotonin (57 mCi/mmol), and the enzyme immunoassay system for TxB2 were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Arachidonic acid [5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-3H(N)] (180–240 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The mAb IV.3 against the FcγRIIA was obtained from Medarex. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 was purchased from UBI. Polyclonal antibodies against Syk and PLCγ2 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. For immunoprecipitation studies, human platelets were isolated from freshly drawn blood by gel filtration on Sepharose CL-2B, and eluted with Hepes buffer (10 mm HEPES, 137 mm NaCl, 2.9 mm KCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.4) as previously described (15Torti M. Ramaschi G. Sinigaglia F. Lapetina E.G. Balduini C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7553-7557Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Platelet concentration was adjusted to 109 platelets/ml. For studies with labeled cells, the platelet pellet, obtained by centrifugation of the platelet-rich plasma, was resuspended in 135 mm NaCl, 2.7 mmKCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, 0.16 mmNaH2PO4, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, 5.5 mm glucose, 0.34% bovine serum albumin, pH 6.5, at the concentration of 0.5 × 109 platelets/ml. Labeling was with 0.2 mCi/ml32P for 90 min, 0.2 µCi/ml [14C]serotonin for 30 min, or 1.5 µCi/ml [3H]arachidonic acid for 120 min at room temperature. Platelets were then washed with the same buffer without glucose and EGTA and finally resuspended in Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, at the final concentration of 109cells/ml. Platelet samples were stimulated at 37 °C under constant stirring with 10 µg/ml vWF in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml ristocetin or with 1 unit/ml thrombin for 3 min unless otherwise indicated. Direct cross-linking of FcγRIIA was achieved by incubation of platelets with the mAb IV.3 (2 µg/ml) followed by addition of 30 µg/ml of goat anti-mouse IgG. Preincubation of platelets with antibodies and inhibitors before addition of the agonists was as follows: 1 mm acetylsalicylic acid, or 10 µmindomethacin for 30 min; 20 µg/ml mAb IV.3 or 20 µg/ml unrelated IgG for 3 min; 5, 10, or 20 µg/ml piceatannol for 15 min; 10 µm PP1 for 10 min; 100 nm wortmannin for 15 min. Control samples were incubated with the corresponding volume of buffer or Me2SO used as vehicle for piceatannol, PP1 and wortmannin. Samples of resting and stimulated platelets (0.4 ml) were lysed by addition of an equal volume of immunoprecipitation buffer 2× (100 mm Tris/HCl pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 20 µg/ml leupeptin, 20 µg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm NaF, 2% Nonidet P40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate). The cleared lysates were immunoprecipitated with 2 µg of anti-FcγRIIA mAb IV.3 or with 2 µg of the anti-Syk and anti-PLCγ2 antisera, as previously described (7Torti M. Bertoni A. Canobbio I. Sinigaglia F. Lapetina E.G. Balduini C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13690-13697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Upon electrophoresis on 10 or 7.5% acrylamide gels, immunoprecipitated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 as previously described (7Torti M.

All the shown results are representative of at least three different experiments. Samples of32P-labeled platelets (0.1 ml) treated with the indicated inhibitors and stimulated with vWF or with thrombin were lysed by addition of an equal volume of SDS-sample buffer (25 mmTris, 192 mm glycine, pH 8.3, 4% SDS, 1% dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, and 0.02% bromophenol blue), and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Aliquots of total platelet proteins (20 µl) were separated by SDS-PAGE on 5–15% acrylamide gradient gels followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Gels were then dried, and phosphorylation of pleckstrin was evaluated upon autoradiography for about 16 h at −80 °C. [14C]serotonin-labeled platelets (0.1-ml samples) were stimulated with the appropriated agonist in the presence of 5 µm imipramine. A 10-µl aliquot was withdrawn before addition of the agonist to evaluate the total incorporated radioactivity. Stimulation was stopped by addition of 0.9 ml of 1.2% paraformaldehyde and 100 mm EDTA and cooling on ice. Platelets were recovered by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 3 min, and the radioactivity of [14C]serotonin released in the supernatant was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Stimulation of platelet samples (0.1 ml) was stopped by addition of 0.9 ml of 10 mm EDTA and 10 µm indomethacin. Samples were centrifuged at 3.000 × g for 3 min, and supernatants were collected. Aliquots of 50 µl were used for determination of TxB2, a stable breakdown product of TxA2, using a commercial enzyme immunoassay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Release of arachidonic acid was evaluated on 0.2-ml samples of [3H]arachidonic acid-labeled platelets. Stimulation was stopped by addition of 0.8 ml of 1.2% paraformaldehyde and 100 mm EDTA. After centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 3 min, the [3H]arachidonic acid released in the supernatant was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Blood from anesthetized mice was collected from the inferior vena cava into syringes containing heparin solution (5 units/ml). Blood was diluted with 1 volume of Hepes buffer and centrifuged at 90 × g for 10 min. For maximal platelet recovery, the red blood cell pellet was diluted with 1 ml of CGS (0.038% trisodium citrate, 0.6% glucose, 0.72% NaCl, pH 7.0), and centrifuged as above. Pooled diluted PRP was centrifuged at 150 × g for 10 min, and platelets were washed with CGS containing 25 ng/ml PGE1. Platelets were finally resuspended in Hepes buffer at the final concentration of 109 cells/ml and rested for 30 min at 37 °C before stimulation. Labeling was performed for 1 h at 37 °C by incubating the PRP with 0.25 µCi/ml [14C]serotonin or platelets resuspended in CGS with 0.2 mCi/ml 32P. Samples of [14C]serotonin-labeled platelets (0.05 ml) were stimulated with agonists from a 10-fold concentrated stock solution for 3 min under constant stirring. The reaction was stopped by brief centrifugation, and the [14C]serotonin released in the supernatant was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Stimulation of 32P-labeled platelets (0.05-ml samples) was performed for increasing times and was stopped by addition of an equal volume of SDS-sample buffer. Phosphorylation of pleckstrin was analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 10–20% acrylamide gradient gels followed by autoradiography. We have previously shown that FcγRIIA mediates the translocation of the small G-proteins rap1b and rap2b to the cytoskeleton and the tyrosine phosphorylation of selected substrates including Syk and PLCγ2 in vWF-stimulated platelets (7Torti M. Bertoni A. Canobbio I. Sinigaglia F. Lapetina E.G. Balduini C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13690-13697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To clarify the role of FcγRIIA in platelet stimulation by vWF, we examined whether FcγRIIA itself was actually activated upon stimulation of human platelets with vWF. Activation of FcγRIIA involves the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in its cytoplasmic ITAM that enables the receptor to bind and activate Syk leading to the tyrosine phosphorylation of downstream substrates, such as PLCγ2 (12Anderson C.L. Chacko G.W. Osborne J.M. Brandt J.T. Semin. Thromb. Hemost. 1995; 21: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 16Chacko G.W. Duchemin A. Coggeshall K.M. Osborne J.M. Brandt J.T. Anderson C.L.

Gel-filtered platelets were treated with buffer or stimulated with 10 µg/ml vWF in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml ristocetin for 3 min. Samples were lysed and immunoprecipitated with the anti-FcγRIIA mAb IV.3 or with an unrelated serum. Control platelet samples were stimulated by direct cross-linking of FcγRIIA with 2 µg/ml IV.3 and 30 µg/ml goat anti-mouse IgG. The immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. The results are shown in Fig. 1. The IV.3 mAb was able to immunoprecipitate a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of about 40 kDa from vWF-stimulated but not from resting platelets. This protein was not observed in the immunoprecipitates obtained with an unrelated serum from vWF-stimulated platelets. Moreover, a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein with a similar electrophoretic mobility and reactivity to anti-phosphotyrosine was immunoprecipitated by the IV.3 mAb from platelets stimulated by direct cross-linking of FcγRIIA. Therefore, we conclude that stimulation of platelets with vWF induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of FcγRIIA. Such phosphorylation, however, is clearly weaker than that produced by direct activation of the receptor, which most likely represents the maximal response. We next tried to identify the kinase responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation of FcγRIIA induced by vWF. Gel-filtered platelets were preincubated with 20 µg/ml of the Syk-selective inhibitor piceatannol or with 10 µm of the Src kinases inhibitor PP1 and then stimulated with vWF and ristocetin. The tyrosine phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated FcγRIIA was evaluated by immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Fig.2 shows that vWF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of FcγRIIA was not affected by piceatannol, but was completely inhibited by the preincubation of platelets with PP1. These results indicate that a Src kinase is responsible for the tyrosine phosphorylation of FcγRIIA in vWF-stimulated platelets. Moreover, the lack of effects of piceatannol is in agreement with the evidence that Syk lies downstream of the activated FcγRIIA (12Anderson C.L. Chacko G.W. Osborne J.M. Brandt J.T. Semin. Thromb. Hemost. 1995; 21: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 16Chacko G.W. Duchemin A. Coggeshall K.M. Osborne J.M. Brandt J.T. Anderson C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32435-32440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is known that many events related to platelet activation by vWF are actually mediated by TxA2 produced from arachidonic acid through the cyclooxygenase pathway (2Kroll M.H. Harris T.S. Moake J.L. Handin R.I. Schafer A.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1568-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). To investigate the possible role of TxA2 on vWF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of FcγRIIA, we preincubated platelets with two different cyclooxygenase inhibitors, acetylsalicylic acid and indomethacin. Fig.3 shows that neither of the inhibitors affected vWF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of FcγRIIA. Moreover, tyrosine phosphorylation of FcγRIIA induced by vWF occurred normally in platelets preincubated with the TxA2 receptor antagonist SQ29,548 (data not shown). Therefore, activation of FcγRIIA is directly promoted by vWF and does not require the action of produced TxA2. We have previously shown that tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk and PLCγ2 induced by vWF is mediated by FcγRIIA (7Torti M. Bertoni A. Canobbio I. Sinigaglia F. Lapetina E.G. Balduini C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13690-13697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Because activation of FcγRIIA is independent of TxA2 synthesis, we verified the effects of acetylsalicylic acid and indomethacin on Syk and PLCγ2 tyrosine phosphorylation. Fig.4 shows that, similarly to FcγRIIA, the tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk and PLCγ2 induced by vWF did not require the production of TxA2. PLCγ2 has been reported to represent a substrate for Syk in collagen-stimulated platelets (18Poole A. Gibbins J.M. Turner M. van Vugt M.J. van de Wilkel J.G. Saito T. Tybulewicz V.L.J. Watson S.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2333-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). To investigate the possible correlation between Syk and PLCγ2 in vWF-stimulated platelets, we examined the agonist-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ2 in platelets preincubated with the Syk-selective inhibitor piceatannol. Fig. 5 shows that tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ2 induced by vWF was totally prevented when Syk was inhibited by piceatannol. These results identify a signaling pathway that is activated in vWF-stimulated platelets by a mechanism independent of TxA2 and which involves FcγRIIA, the tyrosine kinase Syk, and PLCγ2. We next investigated the role of FcγRIIA and Syk on two important events promoted by vWF binding to GPIb-IX-V: activation of PLC and serotonin secretion. Activation of PLC leads to the generation of diacylglycerol, which activates protein kinase C. The main platelet substrate for protein kinase C is the 47 kDa protein pleckstrin whose phosphorylation represents a reliable marker for PLC activation. Fig.6 shows the phosphorylation of pleckstrin induced by vWF in 32P-labeled platelets. Such phosphorylation was not affected by preincubation of intact platelets with control IgG but was almost totally blocked by the anti-FcγRIIA mAb IV.3. Fig. 6 also shows that pleckstrin phosphorylation induced by thrombin was not affected by either control IgG or the IV.3 mAb. We have shown that inhibition of the tyrosine kinase Syk by piceatannol prevented vWF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ2 (Fig. 5). As shown in Fig. 7, piceatannol also completely prevented vWF-induced activation of PLC, as revealed by the inability of the agonist to promote phosphorylation of pleckstrin. By contrast, piceatannol had no effects on pleckstrin phosphorylation induced by thrombin (data not shown). These results suggest that PLCγ2 represents the main PLC isoenzyme activated by vWF. It has been reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ2 is not sufficient to support its activation, and that additional factors are required. Among these factors are the lipid products of PI 3-kinase (19Gratacap M. Payrastre B. Viala C. Mauco G. Plantavid M. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24314-24321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 20Pasquet J.M. Bobe R. Gross B. Gratacap M. Tomlinson M.G. Payrastre B. Watson S.P. Biochem.

Fig.8 shows that inhibition of PI 3-kinase by wortmannin totally prevented vWF-induced PLC activation and the consequent pleckstrin phosphorylation.Figure 8Wortmannin inhibits vWF-induced pleckstrin phosphorylation. 32P-labeled platelets were incubated in the absence or in the presence of 10 nm wortmannin for 15 min and then stimulated with 10 µg/ml vWF and 0.5 mg/ml ristocetin for the indicated times. Phosphorylation of pleckstrin was evaluated by autoradiography of the total platelet proteins separated on 5–15% acrylamide gradient gels. The arrow on the rightindicates the position of phosphorylated pleckstrin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next investigated the involvement of FcγRIIA and of the tyrosine kinase Syk on platelet secretion induced by vWF. In time course experiments, we found that release of [14C]serotonin induced by vWF was rapid and maximal after 3 min of stimulation (data not shown). Pretreatment of platelets with the anti-FcγRIIA antibody IV.3 but not with unrelated IgG, totally inhibited the ability of vWF to induce release of [14C]serotonin (Fig.9). By contrast, the blockage of FcγRIIA had no effect on [14C]serotonin release induced by thrombin (Fig. 9). The release of [14C]serotonin induced by vWF, but not by thrombin was also inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by the Syk inhibitor piceatannol (Fig. 10). Therefore, both FcγRIIA and the tyrosine kinase Syk are involved in the signaling pathway leading to PLC activation and platelet secretion induced by vWF.Figure 10Effect of piceatannol on vWF - and thrombin-induced serotonin secretion.[14C]serotonin-labeled platelets were incubated with the indicated amounts of piceatannol for 15 min. Upon stimulation with 10 µg/ml vWF and 0.5 mg/ml ristocetin (vWF) or 1 unit/ml thrombin (THR), the [14C]serotonin released was determined by liquid scintillation counting and reported as percentage of the total incorporated radioactivity. The results represent the mean ± S.D. of three different experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To clarify the physiological significance of FcγRIIA in platelet activation by vWF we analyzed pleckstrin phosphorylation and serotonin secretion in mouse platelets that can bind to vWF, but do not express FcγRIIA. Because mouse platelets have been shown to interact with human vWF activated by botrocetin but not by ristocetin (21Ware J. Russell S.R. Marchese P. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8376-8382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), stimulation was performed with 10 µg/ml vWF and 6 µg/ml botrocetin. Fig. 11 shows that stimulation of mouse platelets with 1 unit/ml thrombin caused a rapid and strong phosphorylation of pleckstrin that was already maximal after 30 s. By contrast, treatment of mouse platelets with vWF for up to 10 min did not cause any significant phosphorylation of pleckstrin (Fig. 11). Even when 10-fold higher doses of vWF were used, no significant pleckstrin phosphorylation was observed (data not shown). We next investigated the release of [14C]serotonin. Treatment of mouse platelets with vWF caused the release of about 50% of the incorporated serotonin (Fig. 12). This response was clearly impaired when compared with that elicited by thrombin, which was able to promote the release of more than 90% of the incorporated serotonin. Interestingly, secretion of [14C]serotonin induced by thrombin and vWF in human platelets was comparable and almost maximal (Fig. 12). Even treatment of platelets with 10-fold higher concentrations of vWF and botrocetin did not elicite a response comparable with that observed upon stimulation with thrombin or that measured in human platelets. These results indicate that vWF-induced serotonin secretion and PLC activation in mouse platelets lacking FcγRIIA are impaired.Figure 12Serotonin secretion in mouse and human platelets. [14C]serotonin-labeled mouse and human platelets were stimulated with 1 unit/ml thrombin (THR), 10 µg/ml vWF and 6 µg/ml botrocetin (vWF ; 10 µg/ml), or 100 µg/ml vWF and 60 µg/ml botrocetin (vWF ; 100 µg/ml) for 3 min.

https://openalex.org/W2065571808,"The interaction of platelet membrane glycoprotein VI (GPVI) with collagen can initiate (patho)physiological thrombus formation. The viper venom C-type lectin family proteins convulxin and alboaggregin-A activate platelets by interacting with GPVI. In this study, we isolated from white-lipped tree viper (Trimeresurus albolabris) venom, alborhagin, which is functionally related to convulxin because it activates platelets but is structurally different and related to venom metalloproteinases. Alborhagin-induced platelet aggregation (EC50, <7.5 µg/ml) was inhibitable by an anti-αIIbβ3 antibody, CRC64, and the Src family kinase inhibitor PP1, suggesting that alborhagin activates platelets, leading to αIIbβ3-dependent aggregation. Additional evidence suggested that, like convulxin, alborhagin activated platelets by a mechanism involving GPVI. First, alborhagin- and convulxin-treated platelets showed a similar tyrosine phosphorylation pattern, including a similar level of phospholipase Cγ2 phosphorylation. Second, alborhagin induced GPVI-dependent responses in GPVI-transfected K562 and Jurkat cells. Third, alborhagin-dependent aggregation of mouse platelets was inhibited by the anti-GPVI monoclonal antibody JAQ1. Alborhagin had minimal effect on convulxin binding to GPVI-expressing cells, indicating that these venom proteins may recognize distinct binding sites. Characterization of alborhagin as a GPVI agonist that is structurally distinct from convulxin demonstrates the versatility of snake venom toxins and provides a novel probe for GPVI-dependent platelet activation. The interaction of platelet membrane glycoprotein VI (GPVI) with collagen can initiate (patho)physiological thrombus formation. The viper venom C-type lectin family proteins convulxin and alboaggregin-A activate platelets by interacting with GPVI. In this study, we isolated from white-lipped tree viper (Trimeresurus albolabris) venom, alborhagin, which is functionally related to convulxin because it activates platelets but is structurally different and related to venom metalloproteinases. Alborhagin-induced platelet aggregation (EC50, <7.5 µg/ml) was inhibitable by an anti-αIIbβ3 antibody, CRC64, and the Src family kinase inhibitor PP1, suggesting that alborhagin activates platelets, leading to αIIbβ3-dependent aggregation. Additional evidence suggested that, like convulxin, alborhagin activated platelets by a mechanism involving GPVI. First, alborhagin- and convulxin-treated platelets showed a similar tyrosine phosphorylation pattern, including a similar level of phospholipase Cγ2 phosphorylation. Second, alborhagin induced GPVI-dependent responses in GPVI-transfected K562 and Jurkat cells. Third, alborhagin-dependent aggregation of mouse platelets was inhibited by the anti-GPVI monoclonal antibody JAQ1. Alborhagin had minimal effect on convulxin binding to GPVI-expressing cells, indicating that these venom proteins may recognize distinct binding sites. Characterization of alborhagin as a GPVI agonist that is structurally distinct from convulxin demonstrates the versatility of snake venom toxins and provides a novel probe for GPVI-dependent platelet activation. glycoprotein von Willebrand factor phospholipase Cγ2 Fc receptor γ chain In both normal hemostasis and thrombotic disease, platelet adhesion and aggregation may be initiated by engagement of specific membrane receptors that leads to platelet activation and αIIbβ3-dependent aggregation (1Weiss H.J.

In the present study, we isolated a protein termed alborhagin from T. albolabris venom that is functionally related to convulxin, because it is a potent agonist at GPVI, but that is a member of the metalloproteinase family. Evidence is presented to suggest that alborhagin binds to GPVI at a site distinct from that of convulxin. Alborhagin therefore represents a novel tool to further characterize GPVI. Lyophilized venom from T. albolabriswas purchased from Sigma or Venom Supplies, Tanunda, South Australia. Bovine α-thrombin was from Sigma. PP1 was purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem.

The anti-PLCγ2 and anti-Syk polyclonal antibodies were a gift from Dr. M. G. Tomlinson (DNAX Research Institute, Palo Alto, CA). Throughout the purification procedure, fractions were assayed for their ability to induce platelet aggregation of citrated platelet-rich plasma and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as previously described (7Andrews R.K.

Lyophilized T. albolabris venom (20 mg) was dissolved in 4 ml of TS buffer (0.01 m Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4) and loaded at 30 ml/h onto a 1.5 × 20-cm heparin-agarose (Bio-Rad) column and washed with TS buffer. Bound protein was eluted with a linear 0.15–1.0 m NaCl gradient in 0.01m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Fractions containing an ∼60-kDa protein (reduced and nonreduced) that eluted from the heparin-agarose column were dialyzed into 5 mmNaH2PO4, pH 6.8 and loaded at 25 ml/h onto a 10 × 1-cm hydroxylapatite column equilibrated in the same buffer. Bound protein was eluted with a linear 5–200 mmNaH2PO4, pH 6.8 gradient. Fractions containing alborhagin were pooled, concentrated using an ultrafiltration device (Amicon, Danvers, MA) fitted with a YM30 membrane, and dialyzed into TS buffer. The concentration of purified protein was estimated using the BCA method with bovine serum albumin as standard according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). N-terminal sequence analysis was performed as previously described (7Andrews R.K. Kroll M.H. Ward C.M. Rose J.W. Scarborough R.M. Smith A.I. López J.A. Berndt M.C.

For internal sequence analysis, alborhagin (0.58 mg) was dialyzed into distilled water and digested with trypsin (0.1 mg of trypsin/mg of protein) overnight at 37 °C. Tryptic fragments were separated by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography, eluted by a linear 0–60% (v/v) acetonitrile gradient, and sequenced as previously described (17Ward C.M.

Digestion of human fibrinogen (Kabivitrum, Stockholm, Sweden) at a final concentration of ∼100 µg/ml in TS buffer by alborhagin (10 µg/ml, final concentration) for 30 min at 22 °C was carried out in the presence of EDTA (10 mm, final concentration) or CaCl2 (10 mm, final concentration) according to a published method (22Ward C.M. Vinogradov D.V. Andrews R.K. Berndt M.C. Toxicon. 1996; 34: 1203-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Platelet aggregation of human platelet-rich plasma (0.32% citrate, final concentration) was performed using a whole blood Lumiaggregometer (Chronolog, Havertown, PA) as previously described (7Andrews R.K.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8317-8326Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Alborhagin was added to platelets at a final concentration of 2.5–25 µg/ml. In some assays, the anti-αIIbβ3 antibody CRC64 at 20 µg/ml or mocarhagin at 10 µg/ml was pre-incubated with the platelets for 5 or 6 min, respectively, at 37 °C prior to the addition of alborhagin. Other assays included EDTA at a final concentration of 10 mm. The effect of PP1 (10 µm) on alborhagin-induced aggregation of washed human platelets, isolated as previously described (23Pasquet J.M. Bobe R. Gross B. Gratacap M.P. Tomlinson M.G. Payrastre B. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), was determined at 37 °C in the presence of indomethacin (10 µm) and apyrase (2 units/ml). Alborhagin-dependent aggregation of mouse platelets (1 × 108/ml) in the absence or presence of the monoclonal antibody JAQ1 at a final concentration of 10 µg/ml was carried out essentially as previously described (19Nieswandt B.

The incorporation of carrier-free [32P]orthophosphate (∼8750 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) into platelet proteins was assessed using previously described methods (7Andrews R.K. Kroll M.H.

Briefly, washed platelets at 109/ml in 0.01 m HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mmEDTA, pH 7.4 (EHS buffer) were labeled with 1 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate for 1 h at 22 °C, washed in the same buffer, and resuspended in a Tyrode's buffer containing 138 mm NaCl, 29 mm KCl, 12 mmNaHCO3, 0.36 mm Na2PO4, 5.5 mm glucose, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.49 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4. Stirred32P-labeled platelets (2 × 108/ml) were treated with a final concentration of 10 µg/ml collagen or 10 µg/ml alborhagin for 0.25, 1, 2, or 5 min at 37 °C. Samples were quenched by electrophoresis sample buffer, electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions, and analyzed by autoradiography. For immunoblotting, washed platelets (2 × 108/ml) isolated as previously described (23Pasquet J.M. Bobe R. Gross B. Gratacap M.P. Tomlinson M.G. Payrastre B. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) were treated with 1–15 µg/ml alborhagin or 1 µg/ml convulxin for various times at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by adding SDS-containing sample buffer, electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide (8–18%) gels under reducing conditions, electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and immunoblotted with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10. Blots were visualized using a horseradish peroxidase-coupled second antibody (Silenus, Hawthorn, Victoria, Australia) and the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For immunoprecipitation studies, platelets (2 × 108/ml) were pre-incubated with vehicle (0.1% Me2SO) or 10 µm PP1 for 5 min at 37 °C prior to the addition of 3 µg/ml alborhagin or 1 µg/ml convulxin for 90 or 30 s, respectively. Platelets were then lysed by adding an equivalent volume of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, 1 µg/ml pepstatin A), centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 10 min to remove detergent-insoluble material, and pre-cleared with 30 µl of a 50% suspension of protein A-Sepharose in TBS-T buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.3). Samples were then immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-PLCγ2 antibody and 30 µl of protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed once with lysis buffer and three times with TBS-T buffer, then solubilized in electrophoresis sample buffer, and boiled for 10 min. Immunoblotting with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 was carried out as described above. Membranes were then stripped and reprobed with anti-PLCγ2 antibody. K562 human erythroleukemia cells stably cotransfected with empty pRc plasmid and pMG-FcRγ-chain (FcRγ) (pRc/γ-chain) or pRc-GPVI and pMG-FcRγ (GPVI/FcRγ) (10Asazuma N. Marshall S. Berlanga O.

Cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-Syk antibody as described above. Proteins were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and immunoblotted with 4G10. Filters were stripped and reprobed with anti-Syk antibody. The effect of alborhagin (0.1–100 µg/ml, final concentration) on binding of convulxin (1 µg/ml) to GPVI-expressing K562 cells was assessed by flow cytometry using an anti-convulxin IgG and a secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit IgG. GPVI-transfected Jurkat cells were transfected with GPVI using methods similar to those described above for K562 cells (10Asazuma N. Marshall S. Berlanga O. Snell D. Poole A. Berndt M.C. Andrews R.K.

Ca2+ flux in response to alborhagin (10 µg/ml) in untransfected or GPVI-transfected cells was measured as previously described (24Berlanga O. Bobe R. Becker M. Murphy G. Leduc M. Bon C. Barry F.A. Gibbins J.M. Garcia P. Frampton J. Watson S.P. Blood. 2000; 96: 2740-2745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of alborhagin (0.1–100 µg/ml, final concentration) on binding of convulxin (1 µg/ml) to GPVI-expressing Jurkat cells was assessed using the methods described above for K562 cells. In the course of our purification of the platelet agonist alboaggregin-A from the venom of the white-lipped tree viper,T. albolabris (7Andrews R.K. Kroll M.H. Ward C.M. Rose J.W. Scarborough R.M. Smith A.I. López J.A. Berndt M.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12629-12639Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), we identified a structurally distinct protein termed alborhagin that was also a potent platelet agonist. Alborhagin had an apparent molecular mass on SDS-polyacrylamide gels of ∼60 kDa under reducing (Fig.1A) and nonreducing (data not shown) conditions and bound strongly to heparin (eluted at >0.5m sodium chloride). Several lines of evidence suggested that alborhagin was a member of the metalloproteinase-disintegrin family. First, it was immunoreactive toward an antibody against the cobra venom metalloproteinase-disintegrin, mocarhagin (Fig.1 B). This antibody is also cross-reactive with jararhagin (data not shown). Second, like other venom metalloproteinase-disintegrins (22Ward C.M. Vinogradov D.V. Andrews R.K. Berndt M.C. Toxicon. 1996; 34: 1203-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 25Kini R.M. Evans H.J. Toxicon. 1992; 30: 265-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), alborhagin showed metalloproteinase activity toward the fibrinogen α-chain in the presence of Ca2+, but there was no significant digestion in the presence of EDTA (Fig. 1 C). Third, amino acid sequences of tryptic fragments corresponding to a total of 36 residues (Fig. 2A) were analogous to sequences within the metalloproteinase domain of the venom metalloproteinase-disintegrins jararhagin (26Paine M.J.I.

Fourth, we obtained the sequence from the disintegrin domain by N-terminal sequencing of a 42-kDa autolytic fragment of alborhagin (Fig. 3A). Autolytic digestion of alborhagin was inhibited in the presence of EDTA (Fig.3 B), suggesting that it involved the metalloproteinase activity of alborhagin. The 42-kDa fragment did not bind heparin (data not shown) and was isolated in the flow-through of a heparin-agarose column to allow separation of any undigested alborhagin. The N-terminal sequence of the 42-kDa fragment (Fig. 2 B) was similar to the region at the boundary between the metalloproteinase and disintegrin domains of jararhagin (26Paine M.J.I. Desmond H.P. Theakston R.D.G. Crampton J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22869-22876Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This sequence was conserved in MT-d (Fig.2 B), which also undergoes autodigestion (28Jeon O.H. Kim D.S. Eur. J.

Aggregation was strongly inhibited by the anti-αIIbβ3 antibody CRC64, which blocks ligand binding to αIIbβ3 (18Khaspekova S.G. Vlasik T.N. Byzova T.V. Vinogradov D.V. Berndt M.C. Mazurov A.V. Br. J. Haematol. 1993; 85: 332-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and by EDTA (Fig. 4 A), suggesting that aggregation was αIIbβ3-dependent and involved alborhagin-induced platelet activation. In the presence of EDTA, alborhagin still induced a platelet shape change (Fig.4 A), suggesting that alborhagin could induce platelet activation independently of its metalloproteinase function. In contrast to intact alborhagin, however, the ∼42-kDa alborhagin fragment corresponding to the disintegrin and C-terminal regions minus the metalloproteinase domain (see above) did not induce platelet aggregation at a final concentration of 10 µg/ml in platelet-rich plasma (data not shown). Together, these results suggested that an intact metalloproteinase domain, but not proteolysis, is necessary for alborhagin-induced platelet activation. Pre-treating platelets with the cobra venom metalloproteinase mocarhagin had no effect on alborhagin-dependent platelet aggregation (data not shown). Mocarhagin has previously been shown to cleave the GPIbα chain between Glu-282 and Asp-283 and abolish binding of vWF to the GPIb-IX-V complex on platelets and vWF-dependent platelet aggregation (17Ward C.M. Andrews R.K. Smith A.I. Berndt M.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4929-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The lack of effect of mocarhagin on alborhagin activity therefore suggests that alborhagin does not act through GPIb-IX-V on platelets. However, alborhagin-induced aggregation of washed human platelets was strongly inhibited by PP1 (Fig. 4 B). PP1 is an Src family kinase inhibitor previously shown to abolish GPVI-dependent platelet aggregation (29Briddon S.J. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 203-209Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Treating [32P]orthophosphate-loaded platelets with alborhagin at 10 µg/ml resulted in phosphorylation of the previously characterized protein kinase C substrates p47/pleckstrin (30Kroll M.H.

Kendrick-Jones J. Nature. 1980; 287: 233-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) on a time scale comparable with that induced by collagen (data not shown). Additionally, alborhagin stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of a range of proteins, measured using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig.5A). This platelet phosphorylation profile resembled that induced by collagen or convulxin (Fig. 5 B), a venom protein of the C-type lectin family previously shown to activate platelets by an interaction with GPVI (13Jandrot-Perrus M. Lagrue A.H. Okuma M. Bon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27035-27041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar,14Polgar J. Clemetson J.M. Kehrel B.E. Weidemann M. Magnenat E.M. Wells T.N.C. Clemetson K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13576-13583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). For both alborhagin and convulxin stimulation, prominent phosphorylated bands were observed at ∼135, ∼72, ∼36, and ∼12 kDa. The time course for convulxin-induced phosphorylation peaked at 15 s before declining. In contrast, alborhagin stimulated a slower, sustained increase in tyrosine phosphorylation reminiscent of responses to collagen and collagen-related peptide. The transient nature of the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation induced by convulxin is thought to be related to its more powerful stimulatory action (32Asazuma N. Wilde J.I. Berlanga O. Leduc M. Leo A. Schweighoffer E. Tybulewicz V.L.J. Bon C. Liu S.K. McGlade C.J. Schraven B. Watson S.P. J. Biol.

PLCγ2 was identified as being specifically phosphorylated in response to both alborhagin and convulxin, a response that was blocked by PP1 (Fig. 6) along with the increase in whole cell phosphorylation (data not shown). Of the other phosphorylated bands, it is probable that the 12, 36, and 72 kDa bands phosphorylated both by alborhagin and convulxin correspond to the FcRγ, LAT, and Syk/SLP76, respectively, based on previous studies (13Jandrot-Perrus M.

IP, immunoprecipitation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The similar pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation and sensitivity to PP1 in platelets treated with alborhagin implicated GPVI in the mechanism of alborhagin activity. We therefore examined the activity of alborhagin on two cell lines transfected with GPVI. In FcRγ-expressing K562 cells transfected with GPVI (10Asazuma N. Marshall S. Berlanga O. Snell D. Poole A. Berndt M.C. Andrews R.K. Watson S.P. Blood. 2001; 97: 3989-3991Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), alborhagin induced concentration-dependent GPVI-dependent phosphorylation of Syk, whereas there was no response in mock-transfected cells (Fig.7A). K562 cells contain no endogenous GPIb-IX-V or GPVI expression, as assessed by flow cytometry (data not shown), suggesting that GPVI was specifically required for alborhagin-induced Syk phosphorylation in this system. Alborhagin also induced elevation of cytosolic Ca2+, specifically in GPVI-transfected Jurkat cells but not in untransfected cells (Fig.7 B). Jurkat cells do not express GPVI or FcRγ, although the role of the latter is taken by the T cell receptor ζ chain. 2D. Tulasne, T. Bori, and S. P. Watson, unpublished observation. These results provide additional evidence that alborhagin targets GPVI. Binding of convulxin (1 µg/ml) to GPVI-expressing K562 cells was partially inhibited by alborhagin in a dose-dependent manner. There was ∼40% inhibition at a final concentration of 10 µg/ml alborhagin, with no increased inhibition up to 100 µg/ml (Fig.8A). Similar experiments using GPVI-expressing Jurkat cells showed that there was only minimal displacement of convulxin binding by 10 µg/ml alborhagin, with no further inhibition at 100 µg/ml (Fig. 8 A). Together, these data suggest that although alborhagin and convulxin may both bind GPVI, they may recognize separate binding sites. This is supported by studies on mouse platelets using a rat monoclonal antibody that binds GPVI, JAQ1. JAQ1 has previously been shown to specifically inhibit aggregation of mouse platelets by collagen-related peptide and low concentrations of collagen but not by convulxin or high concentrations of collagen (19Nieswandt B.

JAQ1 inhibited alborhagin-induced shape change and aggregation of mouse platelets (Fig. 8 B), suggesting that it binds to a site that is the same as, or located close to, that used by collagen-related peptide but that is distinct from that used by convulxin. Convulxin binding is not blocked by JAQ1 (34Nieswandt B. Schulte V.V. Bergmeier W. Mokhtari-Nejad R. Rackebrandt K. Cazenave J.P. Ohlmann P. Gachet C. Zirngibl H. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 459-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), implying that alborhagin binds to a distinct epitope. In this regard, the effect of JAQ1 is consistent with alborhagin binding to the collagen-related peptide binding site, whereas convulxin may bind to the site used by the second binding site in collagen (33Schulte V. Snell D. Bermeier W. Zirngibl H. Watson S.P. Nieswandt B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 364-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the present study, we isolated a novel protein termed alborhagin from T. albolabris venom that is functionally related to alboaggregin-A and convulxin, because it potently activated platelets by an interaction with GPVI; but in contrast to these C-type lectin-like proteins, alborhagin was structurally different. Several lines of evidence suggested that alborhagin may be a member of the metalloproteinase-disintegrin family. First, the molecular mass of alborhagin on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (∼60 kDa; nonreduced and reduced) and its metalloproteinase activity (EDTA-inhibitable) toward fibrinogen α-chain were consistent with other metalloproteinase-disintegrins (17Ward C.M.

Toxicon. 2000; 38: 775-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Second, alborhagin was immunoreactive toward an antibody against the cobra venom metalloproteinase mocarhagin (17Ward C.M. Andrews R.K. Smith A.I. Berndt M.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4929-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Third, the sequences of four peptides throughout the length of alborhagin revealed similarity to jararhagin, HR1B, and MT-d of the metalloproteinase-disintegrin family (26Paine M.J.I. Desmond H.P. Theakston R.D.G. Crampton J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22869-22876Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Takeya H. Oda K. Miyata T. Omori-Satoh T. Iwanaga S. J. Biol.

This combined evidence suggests that alborhagin is very likely to be a metalloproteinase-disintegrin, although in the absence of the full sequence, we cannot exclude the possibility that it is a closely related protein. Like MT-d, a venom metalloproteinase-disintegrin from Agkistrodon halys brevicaudus (28Jeon O.H. Kim D.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 526-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), alborhagin underwent autolysis, yielding an ∼42-kDa fragment. Autolysis was prevented by the presence of EDTA, suggesting that it involved the metalloproteinase activity of alborhagin. The N-terminal sequence of the 42-kDa fragment corresponded to sequences at the N terminus of two naturally occurring jararhagin-derived fragments, one-chain botrocetin (36Fujimura Y. Titani K. Usami Y. Suzuki M. Oyama R. Matsui T. Fukui H. Sugimoto M. Ruggeri Z.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1957-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and jaracetin (37De Luca M. Ward C.M. Ohmori K. Andrews R.K. Berndt M.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 570-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This result supports the possibility that autodigestion might be a general mechanism for processing venom metalloproteinases. Several lines of evidence demonstrated that alborhagin was a potent platelet agonist and that, like convulxin, it appeared to target GPVI. First, alborhagin induced platelet aggregation that was αIIbβ3-dependent, because it was inhibitable by a blocking anti-αIIbβ3 monoclonal antibody (CRC64). Second, alborhagin activated protein kinase C, as shown by phosphorylation of p47/pleckstrin and myosin light chain (30Kroll M.H. Hellums J.D. Guo Z. Durante W. Razdan K. Hroblich J.K. Schafer A.I.

Third, alborhagin induced a tyrosine phosphorylation profile similar to that induced by convulxin (this study; 12Navdaev A. Clemetson J.M. Polgar J. Kehrel B.E. Glauner M. Magnenat E. Wells T.N.C.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 2088-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). One of these tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, PLCγ2, was identified as being phosphorylated in response to both convulxin and alborhagin. PLCγ2 phosphorylation induced by either agonist was inhibitable by the Src kinase family inhibitor PP1. Importantly, PP1 also blocked both alborhagin- and convulxin-dependent platelet aggregation. Additional evidence that alborhagin could target GPVI was provided by studies showing that alborhagin, like convulxin, induced GPVI-dependent phosphorylation of Syk in FcRγ-expressing K562 cells cotransfected with GPVI but not in untransfected cells. Alborhagin also induced elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ in Jurkat cells expressing recombinant GPVI but had no effect in untransfected cells. Interestingly, although both alborhagin and convulxin appeared to target GPVI, alborhagin only partially inhibited (by ∼40%) convulxin binding to recombinant GPVI expressed on K562 cells and had a negligible effect on binding to Jurkat cells, suggesting that the proteins may recognize separate sites. This was supported by the observation that alborhagin-dependent aggregation of mouse platelets was inhibited by an anti-mouse GPVI monoclonal antibody, JAQ1. This antibody also blocks aggregation to collagen-related peptide and low concentrations of collagen but not convulxin (34Nieswandt B. Schulte V.V. Bergmeier W. Mokhtari-Nejad R. Rackebrandt K. Cazenave J.P. Ohlmann P. Gachet C. Zirngibl H. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 459-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Finally, the observation that structurally distinct viper venom proteins, convulxin and alboaggregin-A of the C-type lectin family (10Asazuma N. Marshall S. Berlanga O. Snell D. Poole A. Berndt M.C.

Two-chain botrocetin of the C-type lectin family and jararhagin of the metalloproteinase-disintegrin family interact with vWF at distinct sites, enabling it to bind GPIb-IX-V (35Andrews R.K. Berndt M.C. Toxicon. 2000; 38: 775-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These latter observations may be related to recent evidence suggesting that C-type lectin-like proteins and metalloproteinase-disintegrins might be derived from a common precursor (41Kini R.M. Toxicon. 1996; 34: 1287-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have identified a novel viper venom protein, alborhagin, that is a potent platelet agonist. Alborhagin is functionally related to convulxin, because it appears to target GPVI, but is structurally different and appears to target the collagen receptor at a distinct site, thereby making it a novel probe for analysis of GPVI-dependent platelet activation.

In principle, the immune system may be capable of recruiting the catalyst-encoding germ line V gene(s) to elaborate specific proteolytic Abs directed to diverse polypeptide antigens, much as noncatalytic Abs capable of high affinity binding to different antigens can be developed by somatic sequence diversification of the same germ line V genes. Introduction of single replacement mutations in Ab combining sites can result in gain of proteolytic (13Liu E. Prasad L. Delbaere L.T. Waygood E.B. Lee J.S. Mol. Immunol. 1998; 35: 1069-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and esterase (14Baldwin E. Schultz P.G. Science. 1989; 245: 1104-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) activities, underscoring the potential contributions of variable region diversification in maturation of Ab catalytic activities. The presence of a serine protease-like catalytic triad in a model proteolytic Ab L chain has previously been deduced from site-directed mutagenesis studies (15Gao Q.-S. Sun M. Rees A. Paul S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Formation of a covalent complex between the nucleophilic serine residue and the substrate (the acyl-enzyme intermediate) is an essential step en route to peptide bond cleavage by non-Ab serine proteases (16Schowen R. Liebman J.F. Greenberg A. Mechanistic Principles of Enzyme Activity. VCH Publisher, Inc., New York1988: 119-164Google Scholar). Phosphonate diesters, like the classical inhibitor DFP, can bind the active site of non-Ab serine proteases and serine esterases covalently (17Harel M. Su C.T. Frolow F. Ashani Y. Silman I. Sussman J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 18Bone R. Sampson N.S. Bartlett P.A. Agard D.A.

In comparison, negatively charged phosphonate monoesters have traditionally been assumed to bind esterolytic Abs (20Tramontano A. Janda K.D. Lerner R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8989-8999Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) via noncovalent electrostatic interactions. The aim of the present study was to characterize the reactivity of recombinant proteolytic Abs with phosphonate diesters and monoesters. Irreversible, active site-directed inhibition of catalytic activity by the phosphonate diesters was evident; stable Ab-phosphonate ester adducts were resolved under denaturing conditions; and the catalytic activity was enriched by chemical selection of phage-displayed Ab libraries on immobilized phosphonate esters. Although less potent, a phosphonate monoester displayed a reactivity profile similar to the diester, suggesting that Ab covalency contributes to the monoester binding. These observations help establish the serine protease character of natural Ab catalysts, offer a means toward isolation of efficient catalysts, and offer an explanation for unexpected catalytic mechanisms encountered in the case of certain esterase Abs raised by immunization with phosphonate monoesters. The asymmetric diesterI (Fig. 1) was prepared in two steps: condensation of phenylphosphinic acid and tropine by means of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide in dichloromethane and subsequent oxidation in the presence of p-nitrophenol and triethylamine (18Bone R.

Monoester III was prepared by acylation of phenyl amino(4-amidinophenyl)methanephosphonate using sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-SS-biotin (Pierce) in MeOH containing triethylamine. Diester IV was prepared from diphenyl amino(4-amidinophenyl)methanephosphonate by the reaction with biotin disulfide N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Sigma) in 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone containingN,N-diisopropylethylamine. All products were purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography and characterized by1H NMR and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Stock solutions of the compounds were in 30% acetonitrile. Synthetic VIP (HSDAVFTDNYTRLRKQMAVKKYLNSILN-NH2; Bachem, Torrance, CA) was radiolabeled with 125I, and [Tyr10-125I]VIP was separated by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (23Mody R.K. Tramontano A. Paul S. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1994; 44: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of125 I(Tyr10)-VIP treated with Abs was determined as the trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity and corrected for background radioactivity in the absence of catalyst (3–15% of available radioactivity) (24Paul S. Sun M. Mody R. Eklund S.H. Beach C.M. Massey R.J. Hamel F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 256: 16128-16134Google Scholar). Preliminary assays showed the cleavage of [Tyr10-125I]VIP (0.2 nm) to be a linear function of catalyst concentration. Cleavage of VIP determined by this procedure is highly correlated with reverse-phased high pressure liquid chromatography separation of the reaction mixture, which in turn effectively separates intact VIP from the fragments, as determined by sequencing and mass spectrometry studies published previously (1Paul S.

The murine and human Fv libraries were cloned as VH-linker-VL (linker, (GGGGS)3) and VL-linker-VH (linker, SS(GGGGS)2GGSA)) constructs, respectively. Both Fv orientations support antigen binding (25Clackson T. Hoogenboom H.R. Griffiths A.D. Winter G. Nature. 1991; 352: 624-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar, 29Anand N.N. Mandal S.

Following hypotonic lysis of erythrocytes in murine splenocytes (2 × 107cells) or peripheral blood leukocytes (from 100 ml of blood), total RNA was isolated, a cDNA copy was prepared using forward primers, and the cDNA for full-length L chains and the VH, Vκ, and Vλ domains was prepared by polymerase chain reaction (corresponding to residues 1–214, 1–123, 1–107, and 1–107, respectively; Kabat numbering). Mouse Fv primers are described by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (RPAS scfv Module Manual supplied with kit purchase). Primers for remaining libraries are as follows. Linkage of mouse VL/VH domains was according to Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Cloning of human Fv library in pHEN2 was by a two-step procedure B VH cDNA insertion via theApaLI/NotI sites and VL cDNA insertion via the SfiI/XhoI sites. Library sizes were as follows: murine L chain, 1.2 × 105; murine Fv, 3.3 × 107; human L chain, 1.2 × 106; human Fv, 1.4 × 107. Randomly picked clones (at least five from each library) were sequenced by the dideoxy nucleotide sequencing method; 100, 75, 100, and 60% of the clones, respectively, contained full-length, stop codon-free, nonidentical sequences. Phage particles displaying Ab fragments as g3 fusion proteins (2–5 × 1013 CFU) treated with biotinlyated phosphonate esters (100 µl of binding buffer, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0; 30 min at 37 °C) were precipitated with polyethylene glycol (30Tyutyulkova S. Gao Q.-S. Paul S. Paul S. Antibody Engineering Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, New Jersey1995: 377-394Google Scholar) and adsorbed (60 min) on streptavidin-coated Immunotubes (2 µg/tube, blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin). The tubes were washed four times with binding buffer containing 0.05% Tween-20 and 0.5m NaCl; four times with 0.1 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.7, 0.05% Tween-20; and two times with binding buffer containing 0.05% Tween-20. Bound phages were eluted with 20 mm 2-PAM (24 h at 25 °C; diester II) or 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (30 min at 25 °C) in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0 (S-S containing probes). Soluble Ab fragments in the periplasmic extracts of HB2151 cells were quantified by dot-blotting for the c-Myc tag (30Tyutyulkova S. Gao Q.-S. Paul S. Paul S. Antibody Engineering Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, New Jersey1995: 377-394Google Scholar) (expression level, 0.4–6 mg/liter). Purification was by IMAC (31Sun M. Gao Q.-S. Kirnarskiy L. Rees A. Paul S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 374-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For initial screening, the extracts (0.6 ml) were dialyzed against the column binding buffer and subjected to one round of IMAC (Bio-Spin columns, Bio-Rad; 50 µl of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose gel (Qiagen); elution with 0.25 ml of pH 5 buffer). Large scale purifications from 250-ml cultures were carried out by two IMAC rounds. SDS-gel electrophoresis (Phast gels, 8–25%) showed a major 27-kDa silver-stained recombinant protein that was immunoblottable with anti-c-Myc antibody (corresponding to Fv and L chain monomers). Some preparations contained a minor 55-kDa dimer band and a 17-kDa C-terminal fragment of the recombinant proteins, both of which were stained with anti-c-Myc antibody (the fragment contains the C-terminal metal binding poly(His) tag and copurifies with the full-length proteins (15Gao Q.-S. Sun M. Rees A. Paul S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar)). Nondenaturing gel filtration (2Sun M. Mody B. Eklund S.H. Paul S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15571-15574PubMed Google Scholar) of purified Ab fragments yielded the proteins as a major 27–28-kDa peak, with peptidase activity essentially identical to the preparations loaded on the column. In the case of clone YZ17 Fv, higher order aggregation was evident in preparations purified by IMAC. Further purification was by anion exchange chromatography on a Mono-Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 0–0.5 m NaCl for 30 min), yielding an electrophoretically homogeneous 27–28-kDa Fv fraction eluting at 0.37 m NaCl. Complex formation was monitored by gel filtration (Superose-12 column, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 0.5 ml/min in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mmglycine, pH 8, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.025% Tween-20, 0.02% sodium azide). The column was calibrated with thyroglobulin, IgG, albumin, ovalbumin, and ribonuclease (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for bound phosphonate ester was carried out by incubating the column fractions in streptavidin-coated 96-well plates (60 min at 37 °C, React-BindTM; blocked with BlockerTM bovine serum albumin, Pierce). Unbound protein was removed by washing with 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.025% Tween-20 (PBS-T), and adducts were quantified using mouse anti-c-Myc (60 min, 100 µl, 1:500 ascites fluid from hybridoma 9E10, ATCC) and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Fc-specific, 1:1000; Sigma) (30Tyutyulkova S. Gao Q.-S. Paul S. Paul S. Antibody Engineering Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, New Jersey1995: 377-394Google Scholar). Phosphonate ester binding data reported here are for the monomer protein fraction recovered by gel filtration. The binding was also determined by a dot blot method after separating adducts and free phosphonate esters by gel filtration (Biospin 6 columns, Bio-Rad; exclusion limit, 6 kDa). The excluded fraction (50 µl) was allowed to pass through a nitrocellulose membrane (0.2 µm; Trans-Blot; Bio-Rad) using a 96-well blotting apparatus (Bio-Rad), the membrane blocked with 5% nonfat milk, treated with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (1:1000, Sigma) in PBS-T, and bound phosphonate esters were determined using an electrochemiluminscence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and X-OMAT film (Kodak). For SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (4–20% gels), the Ab fragments were incubated with phosphonate esters (30 min); the complexes were recovered by precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic acid; and the pellets were redissolved in electrophoresis buffer containing 2% SDS and 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol, boiled for 2 min, and subjected to electrophoresis. The gels were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Transblot; Bio-Rad), the blots were treated overnight with 5% nonfat milk in PBS-T and washed with PBS-T, and biotinylated bands were detected as described for the dot blots. VIP cleavage by anti-VIP L chain clones hk14 and c23.5 (germ line and somatically matured proteins) has been described (12Gololobov G. Sun M. Paul S. Mol. Immunol. 1999; 36: 1215-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 15Gao Q.-S. Sun M. Rees A. Paul S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 27Tyutyulkova S. Gao Q.-S. Thompson A. Rennard S. Paul S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1316: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In initial studies, additional proteolytic Ab fragments were identified to study the inhibitory effect of DFP and phosphonate diester II (Fig.2). Nineteen randomly picked L chain clones (from a mouse immunized with VIP, U series clones) and an Fv clone isolated by McCafferty et al. (26McCafferty J. Fitzgerald K.J. Earnshaw J. Chiswell D.J. Link J. Smith R. Kenten J. Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 1994; 47: 157-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) by binding of phage Abs to a phosphonate monoester (mRT3) were screened for VIP cleaving activity. Seven L chains and the Fv displayed [Tyr10-125I]VIP cleaving activity (>10% cleavage; catalyst concentration, 20 nm). Confirmation of the peptidase activity as belonging to the Ab fragments was based on the observed electrophoretic homogeneity of the catalysts, elution of the activity in the 27–28-kDa light chain monomers purified by gel filtration (2Sun M. Mody B. Eklund S.H. Paul S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15571-15574PubMed Google Scholar), and the absence of detectable peptidase activity in equivalently purified extracts from several L chain clones (e.g. clone U21) and extracts from bacteria containing the control vector (no Ab insert). DFP and diester II at concentrations of 1 and 0.1 mm, respectively, inhibited the catalytic activity of every Ab fragment analyzed by at least 40% (n = 11 and 6 clones, respectively). Near-equivalent inhibition of the activities of the germ line and mature forms of L chain c23.5 by II was observed. The inhibitory effect was relieved to varying extent at 5-fold lower DFP and IIconcentrations in every case. Inhibition was also evident using a peptide-MCA substrate (83, 71, 92, and 79% inhibition of cleavage of Pro-Phe-Arg-MCA (200 µm) by II (50 µm) using as catalysts L chain c23.5, L chain hk14, Fv mRT3, and L chain U16; catalyst concentration, 0.5 µm). Antibody-sensitive scissile bonds scissile bonds are located primarily between residues 13 and 22, which is the helical core of the molecule (1Paul S. Volle D.J. Beach C.M. Johnson D.R. Powell M.J. Massey R.J. Science. 1989; 244: 1158-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 24Paul S. Sun M. Mody R. Eklund S.H. Beach C.M. Massey R.J. Hamel F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 256: 16128-16134Google Scholar, 31Sun M. Gao Q.-S. Kirnarskiy L. Rees A. Paul S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 374-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the case of the clone c23.5, the major cleavage sites are Lys20-Lys21 and Lys21-Tyr22. The assay system applied to measure VIP hydrolysis detects cleavages in this segment of the molecule efficiently. Thus, the observed phosphonate ester effects are likely to accurately reflect the overall inhibition of catalysis, as opposed to a biased detection of inhibition of endoproteolytic activity over exoproteolytic activity. Moreover, inhibition of cleavage of peptide-MCA cleavage and of VIP were comparable. Cleavage of the former substrate models exopeptidase recognition events, whereas the known cleavage reactions in VIP occurs as endopeptidase events. Removal of free II from the Ab reaction mixture by gel filtration did not restore the catalytic activity, suggesting that the inhibition was irreversible (Fig. 3). The substrate (VIP) protected against II inhibition of catalytic activity. II contains a biotin tag, permitting determination of its binding to the Ab fragments with a streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate. II-labeled Fv was resolved by gel filtration (Superose-12 column) as a biotin-containing 27–28-kDa peak coeluting with the A 280 absorbance peaks of Fv monomers (Fig. 4A). Inclusion of excess I in the reaction mixture (10 mm;I is the nonbiotinylated form of II) inhibited the labeling by >90%. Essentially similar results were observed by gel filtration of II-containing adducts of L chain clones c23.5, hk14, and U16 (labeling of the monomer L chains was at 18, 33, and 51% of the Fv level shown in Fig. 4, respectively). SDS-electrophoresis of reaction mixtures followed by staining with streptavidin-peroxidase permitted identification of II-Ab fragment adducts at the correct mass corresponding to the Fv and L chain monomers (Fig. 4 B). II binding by the Fv was reduced in the presence of the substrate (Fig. 4 C). Control extracts of bacteria harboring vector without an Ab insert did not bind II. These observations indicate irreversible, active site-directed II binding by the Ab fragments.Figure 4Diester II binding by proteolytic Ab fragments. A, gel filtration of II-Fv mRT3 complexes. Fv (1.3 µm) was treated with II(100 µm, 30 min), and the mixture (200 µl) was subjected to chromatography on a Superose-12 column. Aliquots of column fractions (100 µl) were analyzed in duplicate for II-Fv complexes by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (see under “Experimental Procedures”). Inset, silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel (8–25%) of fraction 30, corresponding to the Fv peak.

Lanes 5–7 show silver-stained Fv mRT3, L chain c23.5, and L chain hk14, respectively. Treatment of Fv mRT3 (0.4 µm), c23.5 L chain (1.8 µm), hk14 L chain (0.4 µm), and trypsin (0.2 µm) with II (20 µm) was for 30 min, 37 °C. II staining of monomer Ab fragments is evident.

MonoesterIII-like compounds are generally thought to bind esterolytic Abs by noncovalent electrostatic interactions (20Tramontano A. Janda K.D. Lerner R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6736-6740Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 21Charbonnier J.B. Golinelli-Pimpaneau B. Gigant B. Tawfik D.S. Chap R. Schindler D.G. Kim S.H. Green B.S. Eshhar Z. Knossow M. Science. 1997; 275: 1140-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, Fv mRT3, which had been initially identified based on binding to a phosphonate monoester (26McCafferty J. Fitzgerald K.J. Earnshaw J. Chiswell D.J. Link J. Smith R. Kenten J. Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 1994; 47: 157-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), also displayed the ability to bind diesterII irreversibly (Fig. 4). Therefore, both diesterII and monoester III were analyzed for the ability to capture phage-displayed catalytic Abs. II- andIII-phage Ab complexes were trapped on immobilized streptavidin via the biotin tag. Noncovalently bound phages were removed by exhaustive washing at pH 2.7 (and additional pH 12 washes with 0.1 m triethylamine in the case of selection with monoester III). Elution of II-bound phages was by treatment with 2-PAM, which is described to cleave the P–O bond in DFP-serine esterase adducts (33Wong L. Wong L. Radic Z. Bruggemann R.J. Hosea N. Berman H.A. Taylor P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5750-5757Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and elution ofIII-bound phages was by reduction of the S–S bond inIII. The Ab fragments encoded by selected phagemid DNA were expressed in soluble form, purified by IMAC, and analyzed for catalytic activity along with the control unselected Abs. To determine selection efficacy, cleavage of the model substrate PFR-MCA was measured at equivalent concentrations of polyclonal selected and unselected Ab fragments (Fig.5). About 10–40-fold enrichment of the PFR-MCA cleaving activity was evident in the selected Abs from the human lupus L chain, human lupus Fv, and murine Fv libraries. Increasing levels of catalytic activity were evident as a function of increasing length of elution of II-bound phages with 2-PAM (20 and 70 FU/16 h/µm lupus light chains following elution for 3 and 24 h, respectively) and increasing concentration of 2-mercaptoethanol applied for elution ofIII-bound phages (Fig. 5 B). Essentially similar levels of catalyst enrichment were evident in the selected Ab populations using VIP as substrate (not shown). II-selected L chains displayed increased II binding (by 11-fold) compared with unselected L chains, as analyzed by gel filtration and detection of adducts by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as shown in Fig. 4. Taken together, these studies demonstrate the ability of diester II and monoester III to preferentially bind the catalyst subset present in the phage Abs. Individual catalytic Fv and L chains from the selected populations were identified by screening for peptidase activity. Sixty percent ofIII-selected Fv clones and 69% of II-selected L chain clones displayed PFR-MCA cleaving activity >2 FU/h/µm above the background level (activity of equivalently purified periplasmic extracts from bacteria harboring vector without an Ab insert; substrat"

We show that the integral inner membrane proteins Tim17 and Tim23 and the peripheral inner membrane protein Tim44 are required to form a fully functional translocase. One TIM23 complex has the capacity to import one precursor protein/min in vitro. Depletion of either of the essential Tim components does not significantly affect the expression levels of the remaining proteins but severely reduces the overall kinetics of precursor import. Depletion of Tim17 or depletion of Tim23 reduces the number of functional TIM23 complexes. In contrast, when Tim44 is depleted, Tim17 and Tim23 form a functional protein-conducting import channel. This channel interacts in a Δψ-dependent manner with a preprotein and promotes translocation of the matrix-targeting signal across the inner membrane. However, the Tim44-depleted translocase cannot recruit mt-Hsp70 to the import site to drive complete translocation of folded or unfolded preproteins into the matrix. Fragments containing theLEU2 gene and the Gal10 promoter were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using Yep51-Tim23 (19Berthold J. Bauer M.F. Schneider H.C. Klaus C. Dietmeier K. Neupert W.

For amplification of the 5′-untranslated region of Tim23, cloning of Tim23 with 12 N-terminal histidines, and verification of the insertion of the Gal10 promoter the following primers were used: TIM23UU, 5′-CCC CAA GCT TCA CTG TGA CGT CGA TG-3′; TIM23UL, 5′-CCC CGT CGA CTG AAT CGT CGA TTT CC-3′; T23C, 5′-AGT AGT CTT TTC TTG AC-3′; T23-3′UTR, 5′-AGT AGG TTC TTG TGT TGC-3′; T23+HIS12, 5′-CCC CAG ATC TAA AAA ATG CAT CAT CAT CAC AC CAC CAT CAC CAT CAC CAT CAC GG-3′; GAL10-UAS, 5′-CCC CGT CGA CAG GAA CGC GAC CGG TG-3′; T17-3′UTR, 5′-GGC TCA TAT AAT GTC CTA C-3′; and T44-3′UTR, 5′-GAG TAC ATC GAA ACC AAT C-3′. A fragment encoding Tim23 with 12 N-terminal histidine residues was amplified from pYep51-Tim23 by polymerase chain reaction using the primers T23+HIS12 and T23C. ABglII-SalI fragment of the insert was then reintroduced into the BamHI-SalI sites of the pYep51-Tim23 vector to obtain pYep51–12hisTim23. A fragment comprising about 250 base pairs of a 5′-untranslated region of Tim23 amplified with primers TIM23UU and TIM23UL was cloned into theHindIII-HincII sites of pYep51–12hisTim23, replacing the yeast 2µ origin of replication. The resulting plasmid linearized with HindIII was transformed into a haploid yeast strain 334 (20Hovland P. Flick J. Johnston M. Sclafani R.A. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 83: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and integrated into a chromosome. LEU+colonies were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and controlled for galactose-regulated expression of Tim23. The resulting strain was called Tim23(Gal10). A fragment containing yeast Gal10 promoter and Leu2 marker was amplified from pYep51-Tim23 (19Berthold J. Bauer M.F. Schneider H.C. Klaus C. Dietmeier K. Neupert W. Brunner M.

The haploid yeast strain 334 was transformed with the amplified fragments, and Leu+ colonies were selected. The strains with galactose-regulated expression of Tim17 and Tim44 are designated Tim17(Gal10) and Tim44(Gal10), respectively. Mitochondria (1 mg/ml) were lysed with 1% digitonin, 150 mm sodium acetate, 2 mmEDTA, 4 mm EGTA, and 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4. The supernatant of a clarifying spin (46,000 × g, 20 min) was subjected to gel filtration on Superose 12 and Superose 6 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The mitochondria were isolated as described previously (19Berthold J. Bauer M.F. Schneider H.C. Klaus C. Dietmeier K. Neupert W. Brunner M.

The precursor proteins were synthesized byin vitro transcription-translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (22Pelham H.R.B. Jackson R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 67: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (2434) Google Scholar). Translocation of precursors into mitochondria was performed in import buffer containing 3% bovine serum albumin (fatty acid-free), 500 mm sorbitol, 80 mm KCl, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mmKH2PO4, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MnCl2 and 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2. A standard assay also contained 2.5 mm malate, 2.5 mm succinate, 5 mm NADH, 2.5 mmATP, 10 mm phosphocreatine, 0.1 mg/mg creatine kinase, 1 mg/ml mitochondria, and 1–3% reticulocyte lysate with the radiolabeled precursor protein. Proteinase K treatment of mitochondria was carried out on ice for 20 min and stopped by the addition of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The mitochondria were washed in HS buffer (0.6 m sorbitol, 20 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.2) and resuspended in a sample buffer. Translocation arrest of DHFR fusion proteins with methotrexate (MTX) was performed as described by Ungermann et al. (23Ungermann C. Neupert W. Cyr D.M. Science. 1994; 266: 1250-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 24Ungermann C. Guiard B. Neupert W. Cyr D.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). pSu9(1–69)DHFR containing a C-terminal His6 tag was cloned in pQE60. The plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 carrying pREP4 (Promega). pSu9(1–69)DHFR was expressed as a soluble protein and purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose. The protein was eluted in 100 mm NaCl, 500 mm imidazole, 50 mmTris/HCl, pH 8, and then it was desalted on a PD10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with import buffer without bovine serum albumin. To unfold the preprotein, pSu9(69)DHFR was precipitated with ammonium sulfate, and the pellet was resuspended in 8 murea, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5. All constituents of the TIM23 complex are essential for the viability of yeast. To study the role of individual components, the promoters of TIM17, TIM23, and TIM44were replaced in the chromosome by homologous recombination by the inducible Gal10 promoter (3Sirrenberg C. Bauer M.F. Guiard B. Neupert W. Brunner M. Nature. 1996; 384: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Tim23 was expressed with a His12 tag at the N terminus (see “Experimental Procedures”). The resulting strains grew like the parental wild type strain when galactose was present in the growth medium. When the cells were shifted to galactose-free medium, they stopped growing after approximately four divisions (Fig.1 A). The mitochondria were prepared from cells grown for 24 h in galactose-free medium. The expression levels of the components of the TIM23 complex were analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 1 B). The mitochondria were essentially depleted of the respective Tim component controlled by the Gal10 promoter. Interestingly, the depletion of an individual Tim component did not severely affect the expression levels of the other components of the TIM23 complex. Furthermore, the mitochondria contained Tom40, Tim22, and Mge1p, proteins examined as markers of the outer membrane, inner membrane, and the matrix, respectively (Fig. 1 B). This suggests that the integrity of the mitochondria was not affected by the depletion protocol. Tim17, Tim23, and Tim44 are organized in a high molecular mass assembly, the TIM23 complex, in the inner membrane (19Berthold J. Bauer M.F. Schneider H.C. Klaus C. Dietmeier K. Neupert W. Brunner M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1085-1093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). When mitochondrial membranes are solubilized with digitonin, the integral membrane proteins Tim23 and Tim17 remain in a stable subcomplex, whereas the association of the peripheral membrane protein Tim44 with this subcomplex is labile and sensitive to salt concentration (19Berthold J. Bauer M.F. Schneider H.C. Klaus C. Dietmeier K. Neupert W. Brunner M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1085-1093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 25Moro F. Sirrenberg C. Schneider H.C. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To investigate how the depletion of an individual component affects the formation of the TIM23 complex, mitochondria were solubilized with digitonin in the presence of 150 mm potassium acetate and analyzed by gel filtration (Fig. 2). Tim23 (upper panels) and Tim17 (lower panels) eluted in a high molecular mass subcomplex when WT mitochondria were analyzed. When Tim17 was depleted Tim23 eluted in a lower molecular mass form, and Tim17 eluted in a lower molecular mass form when Tim23 was depleted. Because Tim44 is not associated with Tim23 and Tim17 in the presence of 150 mm potassium acetate, the elution profiles of Tim23 and Tim17 were not significantly affected by the depletion of Tim44, and the elution of Tim44 was not affected by depletion of Tim23 or Tim17 (not shown). Depletion of Tim17 or Tim23 did not affect the association of Tim44 with the inner membrane (not shown). In summary, the data indicate that in the absence of one component of the TIM23 complex, the remaining partners are expressed and accumulate to significant levels. In the absence of Tim44, Tim17 and Tim23 assemble into a stable subcomplex. To analyze the role of Tim17 and Tim23 in protein import, we expressed the chimeric precursor pSu9(1–69)DHFR in E. coli and purified chemical amounts of the recombinant preprotein. To challenge the mitochondrial import machinery, 2 µg of recombinant pSu9(69)DHFR were incubated with mitochondria (50 µg) from WT cells and with mitochondria from cells depleted of Tim17 (Tim17↓) or Tim23 (Tim23↓). The imported protein was detected with antibodies against DHFR and quantified by densitometry (Fig.3, A and B). pSu9(69)DHFR was rapidly and efficiently imported into WT mitochondria. The import was linear for 10 min, and the observed import kinetics corresponded to an initial rate of import of ∼9 pmol (250 ng) of pSu9(1–69)DHFR/min/mg of mitochondrial protein. The mitochondria contain about 8.5 pmol of TIM23 complex/mg of protein (26Sirrenberg C. Endres M. Becker K. Bauer M.F. Walther E. Neupert W. Brunner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29963-29966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Accordingly, about 1 precursor was imported per min and import site. The kinetics of import of chemical amounts of pSu9(1–69)DHFR into mitochondria from cells depleted of Tim17 and from cells depleted of Tim23 were about 40-fold reduced (Fig. 3 B, lower panels). Likewise, when radiolabeled pSu9(1–69)DHFR (fmol) was used, the amounts of preprotein imported in a 3-min period were reduced in these mitochondria. This shows that mitochondria depleted of Tim17 or Tim23 contained significantly fewer functional import channels than WT mitochondria. The mitochondria from cells depleted of Tim44 contained approximately normal levels of Tim17 and Tim23 (Fig. 1) and also normal levels of mt-Hsp70 (not shown). To characterize the role of Tim44 in protein import, recombinant pSu9(1–69)DHFR (2 µg) was incubated with energized mitochondria from Tim44↓ cells (Fig.4, left panel). The kinetics was more than 10-fold slower than the kinetics of import into WT mitochondria, which imported ∼1 precursor/min/import site. This indicates that Tim44 is required for the import of pSu9(1–69)DHFR. To distinguish whether Tim44 is primarily required for unfolding of the DHFR domain or also for translocation of the unfolded polypeptide chain, pSu9(1–69)DHFR (2 µg) was denatured with urea and then added to the energized mitochondria (Fig. 4, right panel). Urea-denatured pSu9(1–69)DHFR was rapidly imported into WT mitochondria, whereas kinetics of import into Tim44↓ mitochondria was drastically reduced. The addition of methotrexate, which stabilizes the folded DHFR domain, inhibited import of native precursor but not of urea-denatured pSu9(1–69)DHFR (not shown), indicating that refolding of the DHFR moiety was negligible under the conditions used. Thus, Tim44 is required for efficient translocation of an unfolded polypeptide chain across the inner membrane. Yeast cells harboring the ssc1-2 mutation encode a temperature-sensitive mt-Hsp70 that has an increased affinity for precursor proteins (27Voos W. von Ahsen O. Müller H. Guiard B. Rassow J. Pfanner N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2668-2677Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the Ssc1-1 protein also has a significantly reduced, although measurable affinity for Tim44 (15Schneider H.-C. Berthold J. Bauer M.F. Dietmeier K. Guiard B. Brunner M. Neupert W. Nature. 1994; 371: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Under nonpermissive conditions mitochondria from ssc1-1cells do not import folded preproteins (28Voisine C. Craig E.A. Zufall N. von Ahsen O. Pfanner N. Voos W. Cell. 1999; 97: 565-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In contrast unfolded preproteins were imported into ssc1-1 mitochondria with considerable efficiency (27Voos W. von Ahsen O. Müller H. Guiard B. Rassow J. Pfanner N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2668-2677Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 28Voisine C. Craig E.A. Zufall N. von Ahsen O. Pfanner N. Voos W. Cell. 1999; 97: 565-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). These experiments were performed with radiochemical quantities of preproteins, i.e. under conditions where import sites (pmol) were in vast excess over the amount of radiolabeled preproteins (fmol). Accordingly, only one round of translocation could be observed. To determine import activity on a quantitative level, chemical amounts of urea-unfolded pSu9(1–69)DHFR (100 pmol) were incubated with energized mitochondria (50 µg corresponding to ∼0.4 pmol import sites) from WT andssc1-1 cells, and import was measured (Fig.5, upper panel). Import of the unfolded precursor into ssc1-1 mitochondria was significantly reduced when compared with import into WT mitochondria. We then measured import of urea-denatured radiochemical amounts pSu9(1–69)DHFR. Import of the radiochemical amounts of unfolded precursor (fmol) into ssc1-1 mitochondria (0.4 pmol import sites) was almost as efficient as import into WT mitochondria (Fig. 5,lower panel). The results suggest that the reduced affinity of Ssc1-1p for Tim44 was sufficient to promote translocation of a single unfolded preprotein by a TIM23 complex before the import reaction was analyzed. However, despite its high affinity for unfolded proteins, Ssc1-1p did not support several rounds of translocation/import site as measured with chemical amounts of preprotein. Corresponding results were obtained when chemical and radiochemical amounts of unfolded preprotein were imported into mitochondria depleted of Tim44 (Fig. 5). Import of chemical amounts of unfolded precursors into Tim44↓ mitochondria was not detectable, indicating the strict requirement of Tim44 for translocation of an unfolded polypeptide chain across the inner membrane. By contrast, radiochemical amounts of unfolded precursors were imported. The efficiency of import was, however, significantly reduced when compared with import into WT mitochondria. The residual import of radiochemical precursors may therefore be attributed to trace amounts of Tim44 still present in the depleted mitochondria. Together, these observations indicate that the interaction of mt-Hsp70 with Tim44 is required for import of unfolded preproteins. When this interaction is compromised, either by depletion of Tim44 or by a mutation in mt-Hsp70 that lowers its affinity for Tim44, translocation of an unfolded polypeptide chain across the inner membrane is severely reduced. The requirement of mt-Hsp70 and Tim44 for import of unfolded proteins becomes masked under conditions when only a single round of translocation is observed. For further analysis we asked how depletion of individual TIM components affects the abundance and functional properties of the inner membrane translocase. To titrate the number of inner membrane import sites unlabeled chemical amounts of pSu9(69)DHFR were incubated in the presence of methotrexate with energized mitochondria from WT, Tim17↓, Tim23↓, and Tim44↓ cells. Traces of radiolabeled pb2Δ19(167)DHFR (15Schneider H.-C. Berthold J. Bauer M.F. Dietmeier K. Guiard B. Brunner M. Neupert W. Nature. 1994; 371: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) were added together with the unlabeled pSu9(69)DHFR to follow the import reaction. pb2Δ19(167)DHFR is a fusion protein between the N-terminal portion of the precursor of cytochromeb 2 and DHFR (15Schneider H.-C. Berthold J. Bauer M.F. Dietmeier K. Guiard B. Brunner M. Neupert W. Nature. 1994; 371: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Because of a deletion in the signal for sorting to the intermembrane space pb2Δ19(167)DHFR is targeted to the matrix. MTX was included into the reaction mixtures to stabilize the folded DHFR domain and to prevent complete translocation of both precursors across the mitochondrial membranes. In WT mitochondria, the MTX-arrested b2Δ19(167)DHFR accumulated efficiently in a membrane-spanning fashion (Fig. 6). The N terminus reached the matrix and was processed to the i-form by the matrix-processing peptidase and subsequently to the i*-form by the matrix-localized intermediate peptidase. Both forms were partially resistant upon treatment of the mitochondria with proteinase K (PK), indicating that the MTX-stabilized DHFR domain was tightly apposed to the mitochondrial surface. When mitochondria from Tim44↓ cells were incubated with the mixture of MTX-stabilized precursors, the radiolabeled b2Δ19(167)DHFR accumulated predominantly the i-form, whereas little of the i*-form was generated (Fig. 6). Both, the i-form and the i*-form were readily degraded when the Tim44↓ mitochondria were treated with PK, indicating that the MTX-stabilized DHFR domain was not pulled tight to the mitochondrial surface. In the absence of Tim44 the incoming precursor is apparently not held by mt-Hsp70. In support of this conclusion, the i- and i*-forms were neither co-immunoprecipitated in complex with mt-Hsp70 nor cross-linked with mt-Hsp70 (not shown). Tim44↓ mitochondria were apparently defective at a late stage of the import reaction. After the presequence was cleaved off in the matrix the translocation intermediate moved back out of the inner membrane import channel. The i*- and i-forms accumulated then as dead-end intermediates that could not be reimported across the inner membrane because they lacked the presequence. Complete backsliding of these long intermediates through the TOM complex seemed to be inefficient, and thus the accumulated intermediates spanned the outer membrane. In contrast, mitochondria depleted of Tim23 and mitochondria depleted of Tim17 accumulated significantly less translocation intermediates than mitochondria from Tim44↓ cells (Fig. 6). However, as in WT mitochondria, predominantly the i*-form accumulated, and the translocation intermediates were partially resistant to PK treatment of the mitochondria, indicating that the DHFR domain was tightly apposed to the mitochondrial surface. The residual amounts of arrested translocation intermediates reflect the extent of depletion of Tim23 and Tim17. In summary, depletion of either Tim17 or Tim23 significantly reduces the number of protein-conducting import channels in the inner membrane. The functional properties of the remaining translocases are indistinguishable from TIM23 complexes of WT cells. Depletion of Tim44, in contrast, does not reduce the number of import channels. The translocases depleted of Tim44 are capable of translocating a presequence in a Δψ-dependent manner across the inner membrane, but they have lost their capacity to hold the incoming preprotein in the channel. In the absence of Tim44, mt-Hsp70 cannot trap the incoming preprotein and prevent retrograde movements. The TIM23 complex is composed of the integral inner membrane proteins Tim17 and Tim23 and the peripheral inner membrane protein Tim44 (19Berthold J. Bauer M.F. Schneider H.C. Klaus C. Dietmeier K. Neupert W. Brunner M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1085-1093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In the inner membrane the TIM23 complex is organized as a dimer, stabilized on the outside of the inner membrane by interactions of the intermediate domain of Tim23 and on the inner face of the inner membrane by dimerization of Tim44 (2Bauer M.F. Hofmann S. Neupert W. Brunner M. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 25-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 12Bauer M.F. Sirrenberg C. Neupert W. Brunner M.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The components of the TIM23 complex are essential for the viability of yeast under all conditions (2Bauer M.F. Hofmann S. Neupert W. Brunner M. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 25-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 29Neupert W. Annu. Rev.

In this report we describe a study on the functional organization of the TIM23 complex. Although a number of efforts by various groups have been performed to address the role of the individual known Tim components, little is known about their detailed function in the complex. Regulated gene expression under the control of a repressible promoter offers an opportunity to deplete mitochondria of single Tim components and study the structural and functional properties of the compromised translocation machinery. We show here that depletion of a single Tim component does not significantly affect the expression levels of the other Tim components. Each component was imported and accumulated independently in a stable manner in the inner membrane. These observations are consistent with results from experiments in which overexpressed single Tim components were found to be stable in the mitochondria (Refs. 15Schneider H.-C. Berthold J. Bauer M.F. Dietmeier K. Guiard B. Brunner M. Neupert W. Nature. 1994; 371: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar and 19Berthold J. Bauer M.F. Schneider H.C. Klaus C. Dietmeier K. Neupert W. Brunner M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1085-1093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar and data not shown). To address the activity of the TIM23 complex we established an in vitro import assay that uses chemical amounts of precursor proteins. This is essential because import of radiochemical amounts often does not allow us to draw quantitative conclusions. Using energized mitochondria from WT cells ∼9 pmol of preprotein/min/mg of mitochondrial protein was imported at 25 °C. Mitochondria contain about 8.5 pmol of TIM23 complex/mg of protein (26Sirrenberg C. Endres M. Becker K. Bauer M.F. Walther E. Neupert W. Brunner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29963-29966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The observed rate of import therefore indicates that an individual TIM23 complex imports approximately one precursor/min. Thus, 1 min is required to move a precursor protein across the outer and inner membranes, which corresponds to a distance of less than 200 Å. In an aqueous environment the protein would diffuse over the same distance in about 10−5 s (31Creighton T.E. Proteins: Structures and Molecular Properties. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1996: 265Google Scholar). Compared with random diffusion, translocation of a preprotein through a protein-conducting channel is a relatively slow process. Brownian motion could therefore easily drive translocation of preproteins across the import channel at the observed rates even when diffusion of segments of the polypeptide chain in the protein conducting import channel would be severely constrained. How does depletion of single components affect the function of the translocase? Depletion of any one of the Tim components resulted in the loss of import competence, demonstrating that each component is essential for protein translocation. Remarkably, the translocase depleted of Tim44 remained partially functional. In the absence of Tim44, Tim17 and Tim23 assembled into preprotein-conducting channels. These channels were apparently sealed because depletion of Tim44 did not result in a loss of Δψ. In the presence of a preprotein the channels opened and promoted translocation of the presequence across the inner membrane in a Δψ-dependent manner. Thus, the capacity of the translocase to form channels and interact in a Δψ-dependent manner with a preprotein does not require Tim44. This is in agreement with the observation of Dekker et al.

Accordingly, Tim44 may not be a subunit of the translocation channel of the inner membrane. However, as shown here the presence of the Tim44 is absolutely crucial for the import of preproteins. When challenged with chemical quantities of preprotein, mitochondria depleted of Tim44 imported neither folded nor unfolded pSu9(1–69)DHFR. One role of Tim44 is to recruit mt-Hsp70 to the import sites (2Bauer M.F. Hofmann S. Neupert W. Brunner M.

This recruitment allows rapid binding of the chaperone to the incoming precursor to trap segments of the preprotein as they emerge from the import channel (2Bauer M.F. Hofmann S. Neupert W.

The loss of mitochondrial import competence upon depletion of Tim44 indicates that mt-Hsp70 without assistance by its co-chaperone cannot efficiently bind to an incoming preprotein. Moreover, even Ssc1-1p, which displays an increased affinity for polypeptide substrates but a reduced affinity for Tim44, could not drive import of unfolded preprotein. Thus, an increase in substrate affinity of mt-Hsp70 cannot compensate for the targeting function of Tim44. The requirement for co-chaperones that recruit Hsp70s to mediate recognition of their respective substrate proteins appears to be a general feature of Hsp70 chaperone systems. In the endoplasmic reticulum Sec63 is required to recruit Bip/Kar2 to the translocon to support post-translational import (33Rapoport T.A. Matlack K.E. Plath K. Misselwitz B. Staeck O. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1143-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar),and in E. coli tight binding of DnaK to polypeptide substrates is supported by its co-chaperone DnaJ (34Rudiger S. Buchberger A. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 342-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 35Martin J. Hartl F.U. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Using mitochondria from a yeast mutant that is temperature-sensitive for the synthesis of Tim44, it was suggested that Tim44 is not essential for translocation but only required for unfolding of preproteins (17Bömer U. Maarse A.C. Martin F. Geissler A. Merlin A. Schonfisch B. Meijer M. Pfanner N. Rassow J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4226-4237Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The conclusion was based on the observation that radiochemical amounts of folded precursors were not imported into the mutant mitochondria, whereas unfolded precursors were still imported with about 60% efficiency. Corresponding observations were made here when radiochemical amounts of preprotein were imported into mitochondria depleted of Tim44 or into mitochondria containing the temperature-treated Ssc1-1 protein, which cannot any longer interact with Tim44 but tightly binds to unfolded proteins. However, these studies were made with import assays using radiochemical amounts of preprotein where import sites (pmol) are present in huge excess of precursors (fmol). Therefore they do not measure import rates of the compromised translocases. In contrast, we determined import rates using chemical amounts of pSu9DHFR. Thereby it became obvious that depletion of Tim44 as well as inactivation of Ssc1-1p severely affects import of folded and unfolded precursors. This shows that Tim44 is an essential component of the translocation machinery. In summary, our data demonstrate that the translocase is composed of functionally distinct modules that are associated with individual subunits. Tim17 and Tim23 are part of a protein-conducting channel that specifically recognizes precursor proteins and translocates the presequences in a Δψ-dependent manner across the inner membrane. Complete translocation across the inner membrane of folded and unfolded preproteins strictly requires the peripheral membrane protein Tim44 and a mt-Hsp70 protein that can interact with Tim44.

To investigate this possibility, these compounds were applied singly and in combination to wild-type glycine α1 receptors expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Data obtained from concentration-response curves of the volatile anesthetic enflurane constructed in the presence and absence of ethanol, chloroform, or toluene were consistent with competition for a common binding pocket on these receptors. A mutant glycine receptor, insensitive to the enhancing effects of ethanol but not anesthetics or inhalants, demonstrated antagonism of anesthetic and inhalant effects on this receptor. Although ethanol (25–200 mm) had no effect on its own in this receptor, it was able to inhibit reversibly the enhancing effect of enflurane, toluene, and chloroform in a concentration-dependent manner. These data suggest the existence of overlapping molecular sites of action for ethanol, inhalants, and volatile anesthetics on glycine receptors and illustrate the feasibility of pharmacological antagonism of the effects of volatile anesthetics.

Although it was once thought that they produced their effects in vivo by the nonspecific disordering of cell membranes, it is now generally accepted that these compounds instead exert their actions on specific proteins (1Franks N.P. Lieb W.R. Nature. 1994; 367: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar, 2Franks N.P. Lieb W.R. Nature. 1984; 310: 599-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 3Beckstead M.J.

Among these protein targets are the glycine receptors (Gly-Rs),1 responsible for the majority of inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain stem and spinal cord. Gly-Rs are members of a superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels that also include the serotonin-3, γ-aminobutyric acid, type A (GABAA), and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (4Ortells M.O. Lunt G.G. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). These receptor complexes are composed of five protein subunits surrounding a central ion pore. Each subunit has four transmembrane spanning domains and distinct binding sites for a variety of ligands (5Smith G.B. Olsen R.W. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 162-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Specific single amino acid mutations alter the actions of allosteric modulators on Gly-Rs (6Mihic S.J. Ye Q.

Mutations affecting alcohol and volatile anesthetic actions on receptors may hinder the physical interactions of these compounds with their binding sites or may instead interfere with the abilities of alcohols and anesthetics to transduce their signals to modulate channel function after the compounds have bound. A conventional investigation of binding sites on receptors would include radioligand competition studies. Unfortunately the low potencies (μm to mm) of alcohols, inhalants, and volatile anesthetics, coupled with the current lack of an anesthetic site antagonist, make these studies unfeasible (9Eckenhoff R.G. Johansson J.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 343-367PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, an indirect experimental approach by Mascia et al. (7Mascia M.P. Trudell J.R. Harris R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9305-9310Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) addressed the anesthetic-binding site/transduction site issue by substituting cysteine for single amino acids believed to line the anesthetic-binding pocket on homomeric α1 Gly-Rs: the amino acids serine 267 and alanine 288. Propanethiol or propyl methanethiosulfonate covalently cross-linked to the receptor at the substituted cysteine at Ser-267 irreversibly enhanced Gly-R currents and prevented further enhancement by the anesthetics enflurane or isoflurane (7Mascia M.P. Trudell J.R. Harris R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9305-9310Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate a reversible binding site interaction through the simultaneous administration of two positive allosteric modulators on wild-type and mutant α1Gly-Rs. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that ethanol (EtOH), the volatile anesthetics enflurane (ENF) and chloroform (CHCl3), and the inhaled drugs of abuse toluene (TOL) and 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCE) share common or overlapping binding sites on these receptors. Some of this work has been presented previously in abstract form (10Beckstead M.J. Mihic S.J. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 2000; 24 (abstr.): 45Google Scholar). Penicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester, GABA, glycine, collagenase, ENF, CHCl3, EtOH, TOL, and TCE were purchased from Sigma. All other chemicals used were of reagent grade. Frogs of the speciesXenopus laevis were obtained from Xenopus Express (Homosassa, FL). The oocyte isolation and cDNA injection procedures were performed as described previously (3Beckstead M.J. Weiner J.L. Eger E.I., II Gong D.H. Mihic S.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1199-1205PubMed Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with cDNAs (1.5 ng/30 nl) of wild-type or mutated human glycine receptor α1-subunits subcloned into either the pCIS2 or the pBKCMV vector, which had been modified by removal of the lac promoter and thelacZ ATG (6Mihic S.J. Ye Q. Wick M.J. Koltchine V.V. Krasowski M.D. Finn S.E. Mascia M.P. Valenzuela C.F. Hanson K.K. Greenblatt E.P. Harris R.A. Harrison N.L. Nature. 1997; 389: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). Oocytes usually expressed receptors in 1–2 days, and electrophysiological measurements were made 1–7 days after cDNA injection. Animal poles of oocytes were impaled with two high resistance (0.5–10 megohms) glass electrodes filled with 3 m KCl. Oocytes were voltage-clamped at −70 mV using a Warner Instruments OC-725C oocyte clamp (Hamden, CT). The concentration of agonist producing 10% of a maximal effect (EC10) was determined for each oocyte and subsequently used in experiments testing effects of allosteric modulators. Washout periods (5–18 min) were allowed to ensure complete recovery of receptors from desensitization between drug applications. During testing, oocytes were preincubated with modulator (EtOH, ENF, CHCl3, TCE, or TOL) for 60 s before application of the glycine/modulator solution for an additional 30 s. Oocytes were perfused with modified Barth's saline at a rate of 2 ml/min using a Masterflex USA peristalsis pump (Cole Parmer Instrument Co., Vernon Hills, IL) that connected drug-containing vials to the perfusion chamber through 18-gauge polyethylene tubing. Changes in the clamping current were recorded on a strip-chart recorder (Cole Parmer Co.), and the peak currents were measured and used in data analysis. Oocyte bath concentrations of modulators were determined by gas chromatography as described previously by Eger et al. (11Eger E.I., II Ionescu P. Laster M. Gong D. Hudlicky T. Kendig J. Harris R.A. Trudell J. Pohorille A. Anesth. Analg. 1999; 88: 867-876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Statistics were performed on data obtained from oocytes, by one-way or two-way analysis of variance and appropriate post hoc tests. Within-subject designs were employed whenever feasible. Data are presented as mean ± S.E.; n values refer to the number of different oocytes from which data were obtained. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05 on paired t tests, Tukey's or Dunnett's post hoc test. All groups of data were collected using oocytes obtained from at least two different frogs. The theoretical curves presented in Fig. 9 were created using the following biphasic sigmoidal Equation 1, Y=A1+e−(X−B)C−D1+e−(X−E)FEquation 1 where Y is the current; X is the concentration of drug; A and D are maximal possible currents; B and E are EC50values, and C and F are slope constants.A = 100, B = 1.3, C = 0.6, and D = 0 for the agonist-only curve.A = 100, B = 2.3, C = 0.6, and D = 0 for the addition of the competitive antagonist. The inhibitory component of the curves was created with the addition of the second term with the following parameters:D = 100, E = 3, and F = 0.3. EtOH, TCE, ENF, and CHCl3 were applied singly and in combination to Xenopus oocytes expressing wild-type α1 glycine receptors, and the resulting currents were analyzed for possible interactions between compounds (Figs.1 and 2). Each of four compounds enhanced the currents elicited by EC10 concentrations of glycine applied alone. The co-application of a second modulator produced no additional effect, except when ENF and CHCl3 were co-applied (p < 0.01 versus ENF alone,p < 0.01 versus CHCl3 alone, Tukey's test; Fig. 2 B).Figure 2Effects of co-applying combinations of ethanol, enflurane, and chloroform on Gly-R , compared with the effects produced by the applications of single compounds. EtOH (200 mm) was unable to enhance glycinergic currents when it was co-applied with 1.0 mm ENF (A) or 1.5 mm CHCl3 (C). However, when 1.0 mm ENF and 1.5 mm CHCl3(B) were co-applied, there was slightly greater enhancement than that produced by either compound alone. Compounds were pre-applied to oocytes for 60 s before being co-applied with EC10glycine for a further 30 s. Representative current tracings are provided above each graph. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. of six oocytes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) ENF concentration-response curves were next constructed in the absence or presence of EtOH (Fig.3 A), TOL (Fig. 3 B), or CHCl3 (Fig. 3 C). Single concentrations of EtOH, TOL, and CHCl3 each enhanced glycine receptor function, but these enhancing effects were progressively decreased as the ENF concentration was increased. Consistent with the data shown in Fig. 2 B, 1.0 mm CHCl3 maintained a significant effect in the presence of all concentrations of ENF, whereas the enhancing effects produced by EtOH or TOL vanished when they were co-applied with even moderate concentrations of ENF. To determine if CHCl3 could be acting at two distinct sites on glycine receptors, with only one site shared with EtOH, TOL, TCE, and ENF, we replaced an amino acid believed to compose part of the putative alcohol and anesthetic-binding site (serine 267) with the large phenylalanine residue (S267F). This substitution completely eliminated chloroform enhancement of currents elicited by an EC10concentration of glycine (−0.1 ± 4.7% enhancement,n = 6, versus 265 ± 15.1%,n = 10 in wild-type α1 Gly-R, data not shown), thus suggesting that a second separate site for chloroform does not exist. Alcohols and volatile anesthetics produce leftward shifts of glycine concentration-response curves, and as a result, percent enhancement of receptor function by alcohols and anesthetics decreases when higher agonist concentrations are used. Alcohols and anesthetics have minimal effects on peak current amplitudes when maximally effective glycine concentrations are used. We tested whether the apparent competition observed between ENF and the other compounds could be due to the current produced by ENF already being maximal, thus preventing any further enhancement by a second modulator. First we identified the concentration of glycine (ECEQ) that closely approximated the size of the current elicited by EC10 glycine + 1.74 mm ENF. We then tested the ability of 100 mmEtOH to enhance currents of that size, whether elicited by a low concentration of glycine in the presence of ENF or by a higher ECEQ concentration of glycine in the absence of ENF. Fig.4 illustrates that 100 mmEtOH potentiated currents elicited by ECEQ glycine but not currents elicited by EC10 glycine in the presence of 1.74 mm ENF. Similar results were obtained with 0.56 mm TCE in the presence of 1.0 mm ENF (data not shown). We next tested to determine if competition for a modulator-binding site could be observed in a Gly-R mutated at a residue at or near the putative modulator-binding pocket. When the serine residue at amino acid 267 is mutated to an isoleucine (S267I), mutant Gly-Rs are created that retain their sensitivities to ENF and CHCl3 but are insensitive to EtOH (6Mihic S.J. Ye Q. Wick M.J. Koltchine V.V. Krasowski M.D. Finn S.E. Mascia M.P. Valenzuela C.F. Hanson K.K. Greenblatt E.P. Harris R.A. Harrison N.L. Nature. 1997; 389: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). We tested the hypothesis that EtOH was still binding to its putative binding site, despite having no efficacy on S267I α1 Gly-Rs. This could be demonstrated by its antagonism of the effects of other modulators that still had enhancing effects on S267I Gly-Rs (Fig. 5). EtOH (200 mm), while having essentially no effect on its own, was able to antagonize the potentiation produced by 0.42 mmTOL (p < 0.001, n = 5, pairedt test), 0.25 mm CHCl3(p < 0.001, n = 6), and 0.5 mm ENF (p = 0.002, n = 6). EtOH antagonized the enhancing effects of 0.25 mmCHCl3 in a concentration-dependent manner (F (4,16) = 37.1, p < 0.0001], even at EtOH concentrations as low as 25 mm (Fig.6). No significant enhancing or inhibiting effects of 25–200 mm EtOH were noted on S267I α1 Gly-R when it was co-applied with EC10glycine in the absence of CHCl3. Ethanol (200 mm) antagonism of the CHCl3 enhancement of function on S267I α1 Gly-Rs was reversible as illustrated in the representative tracings shown in Fig.7 A. In addition to minimally affecting the peak amplitude of the S267I α1 Gly-R, ethanol also did not appear to affect glycine-induced steady-state currents (Fig. 7 B).Figure 6Ethanol antagonizes chloroform enhancement of Gly-R currents in a concentration-dependent manner.Representative tracings illustrate that ethanol antagonism of chloroform enhancement of S267I α1 Gly-R function occurs in a concentration-dependent manner. A presents data as the mean ± S.E. of five oocytes. All concentrations of ethanol tested antagonized the enhancing effects of chloroform on S267I α1 receptors. Compounds were pre-applied to oocytes for 60 s before being co-applied with EC10 glycine for a further 30 s.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 7Ethanol antagonism of chloroform enhancement of S267I α1 Gly-R function is reversible. Top panel, ethanol blockade of a glycine + CHCl3 current is fully reversible after allowing for a 700-s washout period. Bottom panel, 3-min applications of low and high concentrations of glycine in the absence and presence of 100 mm EtOH demonstrate minimal EtOH effects on peak height, desensitization rates, and steady-state currents in S267I α1 Gly-R.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) EtOH antagonized the enhancement of receptor function produced by a range of CHCl3 concentrations. Co-application of ethanol with CHCl3 shifted the CHCl3concentration-response curve down and to the right (Fig.8 A). A similar shift was observed for the anesthetic ENF (Fig. 8 B), although EtOH had no effect when co-administered with exceedingly high ENF concentrations (∼8 times the concentration required to anesthetize humans (12Gion H. Saidman L.J. Anesthesiology. 1971; 35: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar)). If EtOH was competing with CHCl3 and ENF for common sites on the S267I α1 Gly-R, we should have expected to see rightward shifts in the CHCl3 and ENF concentration-response curves, with no effects of EtOH at the highest chloroform and enflurane concentrations tested. That this was not seen is almost certainly due to an inhibitory action that occurs at higher concentrations of volatile anesthetics, at an anesthetic site separate from that at S267I. Evidence favoring this hypothesis was obtained using the S267F α1 Gly-R mutant. This receptor shows no enhancing effects of low concentrations of enflurane but demonstrates inhibition at higher concentrations (Fig. 8 C). The serine residue at position 267 of the α1-subunit, proposed to compose part of the alcohol and anesthetic-binding pocket in Gly-Rs, is located near the extracellular terminus of the second of four membrane-spanning regions on the protein. A series of single amino acid mutations made at Ser-267 α1 Gly-R alter the enhancing effects of ethanol (6Mihic S.J. Ye Q. Wick M.J. Koltchine V.V. Krasowski M.D. Finn S.E. Mascia M.P.

An excellent linear correlation between the effects of the ether ENF and the halogenated alkane TCE across a panel of Ser267 mutant receptors is consistent with a common binding site despite the dissimilarities in their chemical structures (3Beckstead M.J. Weiner J.L. Eger E.I., II Gong D.H. Mihic S.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1199-1205PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in the glycine α1-subunit at positions 267 and 288 (in TM3) change alcohol cut off, defined as the largest chain n-alcohol capable of enhancing receptor function, which could be interpreted as a change in the size of the alcohol-binding pocket (14Wick M.J. Mihic S.J. Ueno S. Mascia M.P. Trudell J.R. Brozowski S.J. Ye Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6504-6509Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). GABAAα2β1 (S265I)-receptors (the equivalent amino acid as serine 267 in the α1 glycine receptor) lose sensitivity to isoflurane but not its isomer ENF (8Krasowski M.D. Harrison N.L. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 731-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Finally,irreversible enhancement of Gly-R function is observed as a consequence of cross-linking propyl methanethiosulfonate to S267C mutant Gly-Rs; this also blocks further enhancement by enflurane and isoflurane (7Mascia M.P. Trudell J.R. Harris R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9305-9310Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). A substantial body of data thus implicates this region of the glycine and GABAA receptors as being critical for mediating the functional effects of alcohols and volatile anesthetics. Molecular sites for propofol and other intravenous anesthetics are located elsewhere on the protein (15Krasowski M.D. Koltchine V.V. Rick C.E. Ye Q. Finn S.E. Harrison N.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 530-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), as are the sites for benzodiazepines on the GABAA receptors (16Sigel E. Buhr A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 425-429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). As with any ligand-receptor interaction, the effect that an allosteric modulator has on a ligand-gated ion channel depends on both the compound and the receptor. Compounds that bind at a receptor site may be classified as agonists, antagonists, and inverse agonists, depending on their efficacies, which can be positive, zero, or negative, respectively. Modulation of receptor function can be altered by either changing the structure of the drug or by changing a relevant portion of the receptor. For example, after residue 142 on the GABAAreceptor γ2-subunit is conservatively mutated, benzodiazepine receptor antagonists and inverse agonists function as partial agonists (17Mihic S.J. Whiting P.J. Klein R.L. Wafford K.A. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32768-32773Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of α1 Gly-R Ser-267 to isoleucine (S267I) results in a receptor that demonstrates responses to glycine similar to those of wild-type receptors and retains sensitivity to the enhancing effects of enflurane but not ethanol (6Mihic S.J. Ye Q. Wick M.J. Koltchine V.V. Krasowski M.D. Finn S.E. Mascia M.P. Valenzuela C.F. Hanson K.K. Greenblatt E.P. Harris R.A. Harrison N.L. Nature. 1997; 389: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). By mutating α1 Gly-R Ser-267 to isoleucine, we altered modulator efficacy, changing EtOH to an antagonist capable of antagonizing the enhancing effects of ENF, TOL, and CHCl3. At the concentrations tested, ethanol does not significantly decrease currents evoked by glycine in S267I α1 Gly-R, strongly suggesting that EtOH is binding to a modulator site common to anesthetics and inhalants, but possesses minimal efficacy, rather than binding elsewhere to favor the stabilization of a closed conformation of the chloride channel. The ethanol effects on ENF and CHCl3 concentration-response curves (Fig. 8, A and B) do not initially suggest a competitive interaction between EtOH and the volatile anesthetics in the S267I mutant receptors. EtOH produces a rightward shift at low concentrations of ENF and CHCl3, but the curves fail to reach the same maximum, which would be expected if the interaction were competitive. Despite the shapes of these concentration-response curves, we believe competitive antagonism may be occurring at a common alcohol/anesthetic-binding site. There are two possible explanations for the shapes of the observed concentration-response curves. First, EtOH could be binding to a site distinct from that of ENF and CHCl3 and decreasing the affinities of ENF and CHCl3 to bind. Although the shapes of the curves favor this possibility at low concentrations of ENF and CHCl3, it is difficult to reconcile the effects seen at the high end of the ENF curve. The second possibility is that there are two separate sites for ENF on these receptors, the first a pocket at Ser-267 where EtOH can compete, and the second a low affinity inhibitory site. This second site has long been postulated based on the non-sigmoidal nature of volatile anesthetic concentration-response curves, including decreasing enhancing effects at high anesthetic concentrations as well as rebound currents that are observed upon washout of drug (18Neumahr S. Hapfelmeier G. Scheller M. Schneck H. Franke C. Kochs E. Anesth. Analg. 2000; 90: 1184-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We created a mutant (S267F α1 Gly-R) that illustrates the dissociation between the enhancing effects of volatile anesthetics and their inhibiting effects (Fig. 8 C). S267F α1Gly-R show no signs of the enhancing effects of low concentrations of enflurane but do exhibit inhibition of Gly-R function at higher concentrations of ENF. A hypothetical composite ENF concentration-response curve is presented in Fig.9, illustrating the potential contribution from a second inhibitory binding site for ENF, based on data presented here and observed by others (18Neumahr S. Hapfelmeier G. Scheller M. Schneck H. Franke C. Kochs E. Anesth. Analg. 2000; 90: 1184-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). At low anesthetic concentrations the enhancing effects predominate, but when higher concentrations are achieved, inhibition predominates. In the S267I receptors, EtOH antagonism of ENF binding to the higher affinity enhancing site but not the lower affinity inhibitory site could make competitive antagonism appear to be non-competitive. Regardless of the mechanism responsible, our observations suggest the possibility that compounds acting as ethanol and volatile anesthetic receptor antagonists may exist. Currently, no known compound competitively antagonizes anesthetics from their sites of action on wild-type ligand-gated ion channels, although saturable and displaceable binding of volatile anesthetics has been demonstrated on bovine serum albumin (19Dubois B.W. Cherian S.F. Evers A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6478-6482Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), on Ca2+-ATPase (20Lopez M.M. Kosk-Kosicka D. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 974-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and in rat brain synaptosomes (21El-Maghrabi E.A. Eckenhoff R.G. Shuman H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4329-4332Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The ethanol antagonism of anesthetic effects we demonstrate in S267I α1 Gly-R is a promising indication that receptor antagonists might be designed for alcohol-, inhalant-, and anesthetic-binding sites on wild-type GABAAand glycine receptors. Mascia et al. (7Mascia M.P. Trudell J.R. Harris R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9305-9310Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the Cys-267 α1 Gly-R residue could be irreversibly labeled with an anesthetic compound resulting in persistent enhancement of receptor function. The current study extends this work to show that compounds that are not covalently bound to this alcohol/anesthetic site can also be used to demonstrate competition for binding to this site. In summary, ethanol, volatile anesthetics, and inhaled drugs of abuse appear to compete for a fixed number of binding sites as evidenced by sub-additivity of enhancement of ligand-evoked currents of recombinant Gly-Rs expressed in X. laevis oocytes. EtOH antagonized the enhancement produced by several of these compounds on a mutated receptor previously shown to be insensitive to EtOH. Finally, our results suggest that it may be feasible to consider the possibility that compounds could be designed specifically to antagonize alcohol, inhalant, and volatile anesthetic effects on ligand-gated ion channels. Such discoveries could lead to improved treatments for acute alcohol, anesthetic, or inhalant overdose, or even new pharmacotherapeutic approaches for alcoholism.

In Xenopus egg extracts, Cdc45p was shown to be required for loading of DNA polymerase α onto chromatin. The fission yeast cdc45 homologue was identified as a suppressor for nda4 and named sna41. Nevertheless, it is not known how Cdc45p facilitates loading of DNA polymerase α onto chromatin, particularly to prereplicative complexes. To gain novel insight into the function of this protein in fission yeast, we characterized the fission yeast Cdc45 homologue, Sna41p. We have constructed C-terminally epitope-tagged Sna41p and Polαp and replaced the endogenous genes with the corresponding tagged genes. Analyses of protein-protein interactions in vivo by the use of these tagged strains revealed the following: Sna41p interacts with Polαp throughout the cell cycle, whereas it interacts with Mis5p/Mcm6p in the chromatin fractions at the G1-S boundary through S phase. In an initiation-defective sna41 mutant,sna41 goa1, interaction of Polαp with Mis5p is not observed, although Polαp loading onto the chromatin that occurs before G1 START is not affected. These results show that fission yeast Sna41p facilitates the loading of Polαp onto minichromosome maintenance proteins. Our results are consistent with a model in which loading of Polαp onto replication origins occurs through two steps, namely, loading onto chromatin at preSTART and association with prereplicative complexes at G1-S through Sna41p, which interacts with minichromosome maintenance proteins in a cell cycle-dependent manner.

Initiation of DNA replication takes place only at specific loci on the chromosomal DNA, replication origins (1Nasmyth K. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 405-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 2Stillman B. Science. 1996; 274: 1659-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 3Newlon C.S. Cell. 1997; 91: 717-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Origin recognition complexes, which have been shown to be associated specifically with replication origins throughout the cell cycle in budding yeast, may serve as hallmarks of the origins. Newly synthesized CDC6/Cdc18p temporally associates with origin recognition complexes at the G1-S boundary (4Cocker J.H. Piatti S. Santocanale C. Nasmyth K. Diffley J.F. Nature. 1996; 379: 180-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 5Muzi Falconi M. Brown G.W. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1566-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This association is followed by the loading of minichromosome maintenance (MCM)1 protein complexes onto the replication origins, leading to the formation of prereplicative complexes (preRCs) (6Tanaka T. Knapp D. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1997; 90: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). After the MCM loading, Cdc6/Cdc18p is phosphorylated by S-phase cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk), and this phosphorylation leads to the rapid degradation of CDC6/Cdc18p to prevent reinitiation in yeasts (5Muzi Falconi M. Brown G.W. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1566-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 7Brown G.W. Jallepalli P.V. Huneycutt B.J. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6142-6147Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Preceding the firing of origins, MCM proteins in preRCs are phosphorylated by CDC7-DBF4 kinase complexes, and CDC45 is loaded onto preRCs at the replication origins (9Aparicio O.M. Weinstein D.M. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 91: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 10Zou L. Stillman B.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3365-3374Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Finally, replication proteins, such as replication protein A (single-stranded DNA-binding protein) and DNA polymerases, are loaded onto replication complexes (12Tanaka T. Nasmyth K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5182-5191Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). After DNA synthesis is initiated, some of the MCM components may leave the complexes, resulting in postreplicative complexes. The model above is based mostly on findings in budding yeast and inXenopusegg extracts. Although only limited analyses have been performed in other organisms, much of the data from these analyses are consistent with it. However, considering that the origin structure of budding yeast diverges from that of other eukaryotes, it would be important to study the mechanisms of the initiation in other model systems to clarify the precise mode of initiation in higher eukaryotes. Fission yeast, in which the origin structures may share some similarity with those of higher eukaryotes (13Okuno Y. Okazaki T. Masukata H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 530-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), may serve as another useful model. In fission yeast, the genes encoding six MCM protein homologues (14Miyake S.

In addition, homologues for cdc7,dbf4, and cdc45 have also been identified (22Masai H. Miyake T. Arai K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3094-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 23Takeda T. Ogino K.

Although the formation of preRCs is relatively well understood in budding yeast, how replication proteins are assembled into active replication complexes remains mostly unclear in other organisms. DNA polymerase α (polα), the only replicative polymerase equipped with primase activity, plays essential roles in initiation at the origins (26Wang T.S. DePamphililis M.L. DNA Replication in Eukaryotic Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratry Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 461-493Google Scholar). The second largest subunit of DNA polymerase α, b subunit, which undergoes cell cycle-regulated phosphorylation (27Foiani M. Liberi G. Lucchini G. Plevani P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 883-891Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Voitenleitner C. Rehfuess C. Hilmes M. O'Rear L. Liao P.C. Gage D.A. Ott R. Nasheuer H.P. Fanning E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 646-656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), has been suggested to have a regulatory role (29Mizuno T. Ito N. Yokoi M. Kobayashi A. Tamai K. Miyazawa H. Hanaoka F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3552-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In budding yeast, unphosphorylated forms of b subunit accumulate only in G1-arrested cells, and this phosphorylation appears to be correlated with CDC6-independent Polα loading onto the chromatin fraction (30Desdouets C. Santocanale C. Drury L. Perkins G. Foiani M. Plevani P. Diffley J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4139-4146Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), but the loading of Polα onto preRCs depends on Cdc45p. In Xenopusegg extracts, XCdc45, the XenopusCDC45 homologue, was shown to be required for Polα loading onto the chromatin under the control of S-phase Cdk kinases (31Mimura S. Takisawa H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5699-5707Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). These findings in two different organisms are apparently inconsistent with each other with regard to the timing and dependence of the Polα loading onto the chromatin. In this study, we addressed these issues through the characterizations of Sna41p in fission yeast. Fission yeast Polαp appears to undergo Cdc18p-independent loading onto chromatin, and this step does not require the function of Sna41p. Nevertheless, Sna41p is still required for interaction of Polαp with Mis5p/Mcm6p at the G1-S boundary. These results provide evidence for a model of replication complex assembly in which Polαp is loaded onto preRCs in two steps. The strains used were all derived from strain SP812 h− ade6-M210 ura4-D18 leu1–32. Edinburgh minimal medium and appropriate supplements were used for all biochemical analyses. Unless stated otherwise, all molecular biology techniques were performed as described previously (45Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley, New York1997Google Scholar). Transformation of yeast strains was performed essentially by the lithium acetate procedure (33Ogawa Y. Takahashi T. Masukata H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7228-7236Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). sna41HA3 tagged strain was constructed using asna41Δ strain, which will be described elsewhere (49Uchiyama, M., Arai, K., and Masai, H. (2001) Mol. Gen. Genet., in press.Google Scholar). Three HA epitopes, linked by a single glycine, were inserted just before the termination codon of the sna41 open reading frame by consecutive PCR method. The PCR fragment was directly introduced into sna41Δ strain rescued by pREP3X-Sna41. The transformed cells were plated on yeast extract with supplements containing 5′-fluoroacetic acid. The 5′-fluoroacetic acid-resistant colonies, which could grow without pREP3X-Sna41 plasmid, were tested by PCR, genetic cross, and Western blot. Tandem FLAG tags, linked by a single glycine, were introduced before the termination codon of the polα open reading frame as described previously (18Sherman D.A. Forsburg S.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3955-3960Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), except that pUC18 carrying a ura4nutritional marker instead of a leu1 marker was used. Harvested cells (1 volume) were washed with 3 volumes of cold water three times and then washed by 3 volumes of EB buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25% Triton X-100, and proteinase inhibitors) three times. The cells were then resuspended in 1 volume of EB buffer containing NaCl at a concentration indicated. After the addition of the same volume of acid-washed glass beads, cells were broken by a bead beater. After removal of glass beads by filtration, the suspensions were further lysed by sonication and then centrifuged in a microfuge at 15,000 rpm for 25 min. The supernatants were harvested as whole cell extracts. Denatured whole cell extracts were prepared by using DEB buffer (25 mmHepes, pH 7.6, 6 m urea, and 1% SDS) in place of EB buffer and without the sonication step. Harvested cells were washed with 3 volumes of cold water three times and with 3 volumes of SB buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 1.2 m sorbitol, 50 or 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 2 mmdithiothreitol and proteinase inhibitors) three times. The cells were then resuspended in the same volume of SB buffer containing Zymoryase T100 (Seikagaku-Kogyo) and spheroplasted by a 20-min incubation at 30 °C. After cells were washed with 3 volumes of SB buffer three times, Triton-soluble fractions were extracted by a 30-min incubation at 4 °C in 2 volumes of EBT buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH7.6, 50 or 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 2 mm dithiothreitol and proteinase inhibitors) followed by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 5 min. The pellets were resuspended in 2 volumes of EBT, and Triton-insoluble fractions (chromatin-enriched fractions) were extracted by sonication, followed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 25 min to ensure the removal of any insoluble aggregates. Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed basically as described previously (32Park H. Francesconi S. Wang T.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), with some modification. For all processes, EB buffer (with 50 or 150 mm NaCl) was used as washing buffer, and the 1:1 mixture of protein A- and protein G-Sepharose beads was used for precipitation. Extracts were precleared by incubation with Sepharose beads without antibody to suppress nonspecific absorption of proteins to beads. To prepare DNase I-treated extracts, cell suspensions were treated with 0.5 mg/ml DNase I for 15 min after glass bead lysis and filtration. The breakage of DNA was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The samples were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 25 min to obtain supernatants. An spp1-GFPKan strain expressing Spp1p tagged at the C terminus with the GFP was constructed by the PCR-based method recently described in Ref. 47Bahler J. Wu J.Q. Longtine M.S. Shah N.G. McKenzie III, A. Steever A.B. Wach A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 943-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar. The spp1-GFPKan PCR product was transformed into h+/h− ade6-M216/ade6-M210 wild-type diploid strain, and transformants were selected for kanamycin resistance. The transformant was confirmed by Western blotting. For immunostaining with anti-GFP antibody (a gift from K. Sawin), cells were grown in rich media, and ∼2.5 × 108 cells were harvested, either by centrifugation or filtration. Cells were fixed by the addition of 10 ml of −80 °C methanol and processed for immunofluorescence essentially as described previously (48Hagan I.M. Hyams J.S. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 89: 343-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Secondary antibodies (Alexa; Molecular Probes) were used at a 1:1,000 dilution, and cells were visualized using a cooled charge-coupled device camera (Hamamatsu). It was reported that, in Xenopus egg extracts, DNA Polαp is loaded onto chromatin through interactions with Cdc45p (31Mimura S. Takisawa H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5699-5707Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). To examine this possibility, we first constructed strains in which triple HA-tagged sna41 and tandem FLAG-tagged polαreplaced the endogenous genes, as described under “Experimental Procedures” (the tags were at the C terminus in both cases). The presence of the tags did not cause any growth defect in either thesna41HA3 or polαFLAG2 strains. The tagged proteins could be detected by anti-HA and anti-FLAG antibodies in the whole cell extracts (Fig.1 A). Sna41HA3p migrated at around 70 kDa on SDS-PAGE, whereas PolαFLAG2p appeared as a doublet of 180- and 165-kDa proteins, as described previously (36Francesconi S. Park H. Wang T.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3821-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To confirm that these bands actually represent the tagged proteins, immunoprecipitates by antibodies against the HA or FLAG epitope were immunoblotted by the antisera against Sna41p or Polαp as well as by the epitope antibodies. The same bands reacted with both antibodies (data not shown). Utilizing these strains, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments. When Sna41HA3p was precipitated by anti-HA antibody, PolαFLAG2p was co-immunoprecipitated (Fig.1 B). Only the upper band representing the intact p180 PolαFLAG2p interacted with Sna41HA3p. Conversely, in the anti-FLAG antibody immunoprecipitate, Sna41HA3p was present (Fig. 1 C). Because we sonicated the cells to solubilize chromatin-enriched fractions, it is possible that this interaction is mediated by DNA. To eliminate this possibility, we also examined the interaction after DNase I treatment. As shown in Fig. 1 D, even more PolαFLAG2p was recovered in the anti-HA immunoprecipitate in DNase I-treated extracts. Therefore, we have concluded that the interaction between Sna41p and Polαp is not mediated by DNA. In the synchronized cultures of the sna41HA3 polαFLAG2 strain released from HU arrest, the levels of PolαFLAG2p (32Park H. Francesconi S. Wang T.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and Mis5p (33Ogawa Y. Takahashi T. Masukata H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7228-7236Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) remained unchanged. The amount of Sna41HA3p also stayed constant regardless of cell cycle stage (Fig.2 A). We also examined the amounts of PolαFLAG2p, Mis5p, and Sna41HA3p in various cdcmutants arrested at different cell cycle stages. We chosecdc10, cdc20, cdc22, cdc23,polδ (cdc6), cdc17, andcdc25 to obtain cells arrested at specific cell cycle stages. cdc10 encodes a component of the transcription factor essential for cdc18 expression and arrests the cell cycle at G1 START. cdc20 encodes the DNA polymerase ε catalytic subunit and arrests the cell cycle at the G1-S boundary just before the HU arrest point.cdc22 encodes the large subunit of ribonucleotide reductase and arrests the cell cycle at the point same as the HU arrest.cdc23 is the homologue of budding yeast MCM10 and arrests the cell cycle at S phase after the HU arresting point.polδ encodes the large subunit of DNA polymerase δ and similarly arrests the cell cycle at S phase. cdc17 encodes DNA ligase and arrests the cell cycle at the S-G2 boundary.cdc25, encoding a protein phosphatase that activates Cdc2p, arrests the cell cycle at G2-M. As shown in Fig.2 B, the amounts of PolαFLAG2p, Mis5p, and Sna41HA3p were similar in these extracts arrested at various cell cycle stages. We also examined the interaction between Polαp and Sna41p in cultures synchronously released from HU block. We found that this interaction could be observed regardless of cell cycle stage (Fig.3).Figure 3Sna41p interacts with Mis5p in S phase. sna41HA3 polαFLAG2 strain was synchronized by HU arrest for 3.5 h and subsequent release from the block. After a 30-min recovery, the samples were collected every 15 min. Whole cell extracts were prepared from all of the samples, and Sna41HA3p was immunoprecipitated by anti-HA antibody. Left and right vertical axes of the top graph indicate, respectively, the percentage of septation index (●) or mitotic index (○) and the relative extent of Mis5p interaction with Sna41HA3p (♦). To generate the latter values, the band intensities of the second andthird panels were quantified, and the ratio of Mis5p to Sna41HA3p was calculated with the value at 1.5 h taken as 1. After electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE, the gel was blotted with anti-FLAG, anti-Mis5p, and anti-HA antibodies (top three panels). Thepanel indicated as CBB stain shows the CBB staining of the same gel to show the presence of roughly equal amount of proteins in each lane. In the bottom panel,immunoprecipitates containing an equal amount of Sna41HA3p were blotted with anti-Mis5p antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The physiological interactions between CDC45 and MCM complex have been suggested in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (8Hopwood B.

Science. 1998; 280: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have examined the interaction between Sna41HA3p and MCM complex. We examined one of the MCM proteins, Mis5p/SpMcm6p (15Takahashi K. Yamada H. Yanagida M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1145-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 38Kelly T.J. Martin G.S. Forsburg S.L. Stephen R.J. Russo A. Nurse P. Cell. 1993; 74: 371-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). First, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments in exponentially growing cells. We observed co-immunoprecipitation of Sna41HA3p and Mis5p with either anti-Mis5p antibody (38Kelly T.J. Martin G.S.

Because DNase I treatment did not affect the amount of Mis5p immunoprecipitated by anti-HA antibody, the interaction between Mis5p and Sna41HA3p is not mediated by DNA. Next, we analyzed the interaction in cultures synchronized by HU. The interaction between Sna41HA3p and Mis5p was cell cycle-regulated and correlated with the septation index (Fig. 3). Because Schizosaccharomyces pombeundergoes septation in G1-S phase, we concluded that the interaction took place in S phase. To further examine this regulation, we next tested the interaction in cell cycle-arrested cultures.Sna41HA3 strain was arrested by various cell cycle mutants,cdc10–129, cdc20-M10, cdc22-M45, cdc23-M36 (35Aves S.J. Tongue N. Foster A.J. Hart E.A. Curr. Genet. 1998; 34: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), polδts01 (36Francesconi S. Park H. Wang T.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3821-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar),cdc17-K42, and cdc25–22 (37Russell P. Nurse P. Cell. 1986; 45: 145-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Sna41HA3p interacted with Mis5p in cdc20-, cdc22-, andcdc23-arrested extracts (Fig.4 A). Interestingly, although both cdc23 and polδ mutants arrest the cell cycle with late S-phase DNA contents, only weak interaction was observed only in polδ. In addition, we tested whether these interactions were affected by the protein localization. The Triton-soluble and -insoluble (the chromatin-enriched) fractions were prepared from the arrested cdc mutant cells. Interestingly, the interaction was only observed in Triton-insoluble fractions. Despite the presence of significant amount of Mis5p and Sna41p, virtually no interaction was observed in triton soluble fractions (Fig.4 B). Because Sna41p appears to be exclusively localized in nucleus throughout the cell cycle (data not shown), the interaction between Sna41HA3p and Mis5p is likely to take place exclusively on the chromatin. Taken together with the results in the previous section that Sna41HA3p interacts with Polαp throughout the cell cycle, the role of CDC45-related proteins in assembly of replication machinery, as proposed previously (31Mimura S. Takisawa H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5699-5707Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), may be accomplished by the physical interaction between Cdc45p and MCM at the G1-S boundary. In Xenopus egg extracts, XCdc45 was shown to be required for chromatin loading of Polαp. Independently, in budding yeast, Polα complexes were found to undergo a so-called “mitotic resetting” event and to be loaded onto chromatin fractions before CDC6 loading in budding yeast (30Desdouets C. Santocanale C. Drury L. Perkins G. Foiani M. Plevani P. Diffley J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4139-4146Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These two results suggest that Sna41p may play essential roles in a similar mitotic resetting event of Polαp in fission yeast. To address this question, we examined the chromatin loading of Sna41HA3p, Mis5p, and PolαFLAG2p in HU synchronized extracts. The Sna41HA3 polαFLAG2strain was arrested by HU for 4 h and released into cell cycle from the block. Then, chromatin-enriched fractions were prepared at various times after release. As reported previously, the amount of Mis5p on the chromatin was cell cycle-regulated and correlated with the septation index (33Ogawa Y. Takahashi T. Masukata H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7228-7236Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The amount of Sna41HA3p and PolαFLAG2p in the same fractions also fluctuated, as did Mis5p, and generally increased during S phase (Fig. 5 A). However, it was difficult from this experiment to conclude on the order of the loading of these three proteins onto the chromatin. To clarify the timing of chromatin loading, we examined the chromatin loading in cell cycle-arrested extracts. Sna41HA3 polαFLAG2 strains in combination with the cell cycle mutants cdc10–129, cdc20-M10,cdc22-M45, cdc23-M36,polδts01, and cdc25–22 were used to arrest the cell cycle. The chromatin-enriched fractions were analyzed by Western blotting. Mis5p was recovered in chromatin-enriched fractions from cdc20-, cdc22-, cdc23-, and polδ-arrested cells (Fig. 5 B), in agreement with the recent report (33Ogawa Y. Takahashi T. Masukata H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7228-7236Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Sna41HA3p was recovered mainly incdc10 and cdc20 as well as in cdc22and in cdc23 in reduced amount. PolαFLAG2p was detected incdc10-, cdc20-, and cdc22-arrested fractions. Because no Mis5p was detected in cdc10, Sna41HA3p and PolαFLAG2p loading onto chromatin might be controlled by a mechanism different from that for MCMs. Because cdc10 mutant fails to progress into S phase due to the lack of Cdc18p expression (38Kelly T.J. Martin G.S. Forsburg S.L. Stephen R.J. Russo A. Nurse P. Cell. 1993; 74: 371-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), we could conclude that, unlike Mis5p, Sna41p and Polαp loading onto the chromatins is independent of Cdc18p. We also examined the chromatin loading of PolαFLAG2p and Mis5p insna41 goa1 mutant, which we recently isolated as an initiation-defective temperature-sensitive mutant and identified as an allele of sna41(49Uchiyama, M., Arai, K., and Masai, H. (2001) Mol. Gen. Genet., in press.Google Scholar). The defect in Sna41p did not affect the chromatin loading of PolαFLAG2p and Mis5p (Fig.5 B). Interestingly, PolαFLAG2p in the chromatin-enriched fractions was most abundant in the sna41 goa1 mutant. This is unexpected, but we can clearly conclude that Sna41p is not required for Polαp loading onto chromatin. Although we showed that chromatin loading of Polα was not affected by sna41 goa1 mutation, the physical and genetic interactions among Sna41p, Polαp, and Mis5p must be the key to reveal sna41 functions in G1-S transition. The arresting point of sna41 goa1 is close to that ofcdc20 or cdc22 (data not shown), and interaction of Sna41HA3p with MCMs takes place mainly at this cell cycle point. Taking these facts into account, we hypothesized that Sna41p is not required for chromatin loading of Polαp but is still required for association of Polαp with replicative complexes at the origins of DNA replication. Recently, Griffiths et al. (39Griffiths D.J.F. Liu V.F. Nurse P. Wang T.S.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 115-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) isolated and characterized S. pombe DNA primase 1, spp1, encoding a subunit of DNA polymerase α enzyme complexes. The amount of this protein remains constant throughout the cell cycle, and the protein is localized in the nucleus at all cell cycle stages. However, when Spp1GFPp is stained with anti-GFP antibody by indirect immunofluorescence, the nuclear staining of Spp1GFPp disappears at the G1-S boundary or at the HU-arrested stage. We found that the staining pattern of Spp1GFPp in sna41 goa1 stayed basically the same as the G2 status even after 5 h at the nonpermissive temperature, despite the fact thatsna41 goa1 arrests the cell cycle at the G1-S boundary very close to cdc22 or the HU arresting point (Fig. 6). This observation suggests that some G1-S-specific alterations of Polα complexes may not occur in sna41 goa1, consistent with our proposal that sna41p is required for interaction of Polαp with preRC. We have already shown that Sna41HA3p interacts with PolαFLAG2p regardless of cell cycle stages and with Mis5p at the G1-S boundary in chromatin-enriched fractions. Therefore, it is possible that Polα complexes are loaded onto replicative complexes with the aid of Sna41p, which may function as a bridge. To further test this possibility, we first examined the interaction of PolαFLAG2p with Mis5p in the HU-synchronized culture. PolαFLAG2p was precipitated by anti-FLAG antibody, and the interactions were analyzed by Western blotting. Consistent with the results in Fig. 2, PolαFLAG2p interacted with Sna41p regardless of the cell cycle stage. In contrast, Mis5p interaction fluctuated during the cell cycle (Fig.7 A). The extent of the interaction correlated with septation index. This result clearly shows that PolαFLAG2p interacted with Mis5p only during S phase. These results strongly suggest the possibility that Sna41p mediates the loading of Polα complexes onto the replication complexes. This possibility could be examined by analyzing the interaction of Polαp with MCM in the sna41 goa1 mutant because the mutant contains a very low level of Sna41p at the nonpermissive temperature due to its instability (data not shown). Becausesna41 goa1 and cdc20-M10 arrest the cell cycle at a very similar point, we examined the interaction between PolαFLAG2p and Mis5p in sna41 goa1- andcdc20-arrested extracts. In the cdc20-arrested extract, Mis5p was coprecipitated with polαFLAG2p. In contrast, Mis5p was not co-precipitated in thesna41 goa1-arrested extract (Fig. 7 B). In conclusion, we show here that Sna41p function is essential for interaction of Polαp with Mis5p at the initiation of DNA replication. It was previously reported that DNA polymerase α is loaded onto chromatin through Cdc45 protein in Xenopus egg extracts. Furthermore, through characterization of a new G1 arrest mutant, sna41 goa1, we found genetic interactions between sna41 and polα (49Uchiyama, M., Arai, K., and Masai, H. (2001) Mol. Gen. Genet., in press.Google Scholar). These findings lead us to examine physical interactions between Sna41p and Polαp. We found that Sna41p and Polαp interacted throughout the cell cycle. Sna41p also interacted with Mis5p, the fission yeast homologue of MCM6, during S phase. Sna41p and Polαp were loaded onto the chromatin-enriched fractions in cdc10-arrested extract. Sna41p is not required for chromatin loading of Polαp but is still required for its interaction with Mis5p in S phase. In budding yeast, physical and genetic interactions of CDC45 with MCMs have been reported (8Hopwood B. Dalton S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12309-12314Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 10Zou L. Stillman B. Science. 1998; 280: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Although the interaction is known to take place at the G1-S boundary, what exactly triggers this interaction has remained unclear. We have found that Sna41p and Mis5p interact exclusively in the chromatin-enriched fractions in S. pombe. At present, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that this interaction is mediated indirectly by DNA linking the two proteins. However, we think this possibility is rather unlikely because the average sizes of DNA are less than 300 base pairs after sonication of the Triton-insoluble fractions and also because we detected the interaction in DNase I-treated extracts (Fig. 1 D). It is probable that the interaction between these two proteins is regulated by a third component such as Hsk1p-Dfp1/Him1 (22Masai H. Miyake T. Arai K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3094-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 23Takeda T. Ogino K. Matsui E. Cho M.K. Kumagai H. Miyake T. Arai K. Masai H. Mol. Cell.

A. 1999; 96: 8443-8448Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 40Brown G.W. Kelly T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22083-22090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), S-phase Cdk, or unknown mediator(s). Two different bands of Mis5p were detected on SDS-PAGE when extracts were prepared by the spheroplast method. In addition, the upper band was maximized in thesna41 goa1-arrested fraction (Fig. 5 B) and minimized in cdc25 or cdc10 (data not shown). Although we cannot conclude at this moment that this mobility shift is due to phosphorylation, this possibility needs to be examined in the future experiments. We have found that sna41 goa1suppresses the growth defect of polαts13 (49Uchiyama, M., Arai, K., and Masai, H. (2001) Mol. Gen. Genet., in press.Google Scholar). Thus, it is most likely that this genetic interaction is attributed to the physical interaction between Sna41p and Polαp. In accordance with this prediction, we found that these two proteins interact with each other. This is consistent with the result in Xenopus and the recent in vitro observation in human (41Kukimoto I. Igaki H. Kanda T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 936-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). InXenopus egg extracts, DNA polymerase α is loaded onto chromatin at the G1-S boundary in a manner dependent on XCdc45 and Cdk activity (31Mimura S. Takisawa H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5699-5707Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In contrast, budding yeast DNA polymerase α is loaded at the end of mitosis independent of CDC6 (30Desdouets C. Santocanale C. Drury L. Perkins G. Foiani M. Plevani P. Diffley J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4139-4146Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), although another report claims that the Polα b subunit is loaded onto chromatin at G1-S (42Zou L. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3086-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). These somewhat contradictory results may be due to the different cell cycle operations in yeast andXenopus eggs. DNA replication and mitosis are alternating practically without gap periods in Xenopus egg extracts, whereas yeast cell cycles are under strict G1 regulations. Diversity in the methods for preparation of chromatin fractions may also account in part for these discrepancies. However, our data may provide a more unified view for the loading of DNA polymerase α. We found that Polαp loading on the chromatin-enriched fractions is observed even in cdc10- orsna41 goa1-arrested extract (Fig. 5 B). This clearly shows that this step is not dependent on either Cdc18p or Sna41p. This result is consistent with the observation in budding yeast. We also showed that interaction of Polαp with MCMs at the G1-S boundary depends on functional Sna41p (Fig. 7). Recently, Mis5p/Mcm6p was shown to be loaded at or near autonomously replicating sequences (33Ogawa Y. Takahashi T. Masukata H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7228-7236Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Although further confirmation is needed, it is most likely that association of Polαp with MCMs facilitates relocation of the former protein to replication origins. This result is more consistent with the finding inXenopus egg extracts. Taken together, our data support the following model (Fig. 8) of loading of DNA polymerase α onto replication complexes in the proliferating cell cycle of somatic cells. The first step may depend on Polα b subunit and inactivation of M-phase Cdk. The fact that Polαp and Sna41p recovered in the chromatin-enriched fractions are relatively resistant to extraction with DNase I digestion (data not shown) suggests that the first step of loading may deliver these proteins not simply onto the chromatin but onto a particular nuclear structure or nuclear matrix. Because Sna41p and Polαp can interact with each other throughout the cell cycle, the two proteins may be loaded onto chromatin as a complex. However, because Polαp is loaded onto chromatin even in the sna41 goa1 mutant, the association of Sna41p and Polαp is unlikely to be essential for Polαp loading. This step may be required for accumulation of the proteins involved in DNA synthesis at the specific nuclear structures. Then, interaction of Sna41p with MCMs brings DNA polymerase α onto replication complexes at the origins in the second step. This step may be regulated by S-phase Cdk and/or by Cdc7 kinase. It should be noted that our results do not exclude the possibility that the observed interactions are mediated by other proteins. In fact, both Mis5p and Polαp are parts of protein complexes (six-protein MCM complex and four-protein DNA polymerase α complex, respectively) that are essential components for a larger replication machinery, and therefore it may be more likely that Sna41p interacts with these complexes as well as other components in the replication apparatus. The model can explain the recent finding in S. cerevisiaethat CDC45 and DNA polymerase α are loaded onto late-firing origins later than early ones (43Aparicio O.M. Stout A.M. Bell S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9130-9135Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 44Tercero J.A. Labib K. Diffley J.F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2082-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) by postulating that origin-specific phosphorylation events activate association of Cdc45 with MCM. The data presented in this work indicate that physical interactions between MCM-Cdc45p-Polαp constitute an important step for assembly of active replication machinery. More biochemical studies are needed to understand the nature of these interactions and the roles of these complexes in initiation of DNA replication.

We thank all members of our laboratory for useful discussion."

Reducing agents, such asN-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), are known to regulate signal transduction and cell growth through their radical scavenging action. However, recent studies have shown that reactive oxygen species are not always involved in ligand-stimulated intracellular signaling. Here, we report a novel mechanism by which NAC blocks platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced signaling pathways in hepatic stellate cells, a fibrogenic player in the liver. Unlike in vascular smooth muscle cells, we found that reducing agents, including NAC, triggered extracellular proteolysis of PDGF receptor-β, leading to desensitization of hepatic stellate cells toward PDGF-BB. This effect was mediated by secreted mature cathepsin B. In addition, type II transforming growth factor-β receptor was also down-regulated. Furthermore, these events seemed to cause a dramatic improvement of rat liver fibrosis. These results indicated that redox processes impact the cell's response to growth factors by regulating the turnover of growth factor receptors and that “redox therapy” is promising for fibrosis-related disease.

FASEB J. 1997; 11: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Extracellular signal-regulated kinase is one of the reactive oxygen species-responsive serine/threonine kinases (2Aikawa R. Komuro I. Yamazaki T. Zou Y. Kudoh S. Tanaka M. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Yazaki Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1813-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). A recent study showed that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) directly attacks Gαo and Gαi to activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes (3Nishida M. Maruyama Y. Tanaka R. Kontani K. Nagao T. Kurose H. Nature. 2000; 408: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In addition to the direct activation of signal molecules, H2O2 was also reported to contribute to the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC)1 under the stimulation of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) (4Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2313) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have forced reconsideration of this hypothesis. In HepG2 cells, PDGF receptor (PDGFR) was autophosphorylated independently of H2O2 production (5Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). In epithelial cells, interleukin-1β activated NF-κB without H2O2production (6Bonizzi G. Dejardin E. Piret B. Piette J. Merville M.P. Bours V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 544-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These evidences confirmed that reactive oxygen species are not always involved in ligand-induced signaling pathways. The hepatic stellate cell (HSC), a liver-specific pericyte, plays a central role in liver fibrogenesis (7Friedman S.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 1828-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). When undergoing activation, the HSC proliferates and generates a large amount of extracellular matrix materials including fibril-forming collagens, fibronectin, and proteoglycans, resulting in septum formation in chronically damaged liver. Because recent studies have confirmed that PDGF is the most potent mitogen for HSC (8Pinzani M. Gesualdo L. Sabbah G.M. Abboud H.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1786-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), regulation of PDGF-stimulated HSC proliferation would serve as a therapeutic target for liver fibrosis. Here we show that reducing agents, includingN-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), have the potential to disturb PDGF-dependent signal transductions and DNA synthesis in HSC. Molecular analysis revealed that NAC triggered extracellular proteolysis of PDGFR-β through the activation of a thiol-protease, cathepsin B, independently of its H2O2 scavenging action.

These drugs were dissolved in Me2SO before use, and, throughout the experiments, the final concentration of Me2SO in cell culture medium was kept at 0.5% including control cultures. Unless specifically indicated, all other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Pathogen-free male Wistar rats were obtained from SLC (Shizuoka, Japan). Animals were housed at a constant temperature and supplied with laboratory chow and water ad libitum. The protocol of experiments was approved by the Animal Research Committee of Osaka City University (Guide for Animal Experiments, Osaka City University). We isolated HSC from Wistar rat livers using Pronase E and the collagenase digestion method as previously described (9Kawada N. Tran-Thi T-A. Klein H. Decker K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 815-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Cell purity was around 95% as assessed by a typical starlike configuration and by detecting vitamin A autofluorescence. Cells were cultured on plastic dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies). We changed the culture medium every 2 days. We isolated VSMC from Wistar rat thoracic aorta by subcultured explants method as previously described (10Ross R. J. Cell. Biol. 1971; 50: 172-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured on plastic dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Passaged cells were used in an in vitroassay. In all experiments, we incubated HSC or VSMC in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h before the addition of test agents. We treated confluent HSC with NAC for 24 h, followed by treatment with PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) for another 24 h. Cells were pulse-labeled with 1.0 µCi/ml [3H]thymidine during the last 6 h. Incorporated radioactivity was counted as previously described (11Kawada N. Ikeda K. Seki S. Kuroki T. J. Hepatol. 1999; 30: 1057-1064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We lysed HSC cultured in a 60-mm dish (FALCON 3002; Becton Dickinson, Flanklin Lakes, NJ) by 500 µl of radioimmune precipitation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% IGEPAL CA-630, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate). The lysates (500 µg) were incubated with 2 µg of antibody against PDGFR-β at 4 °C for 24 h, followed by incubation with 20 µl of protein G plus agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C for 1 h. We homogenized HSC treated with EDTA (Wako), 1,10-phenanthroline, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, chymostatin, E64, E64-c, E64-d, CA074, and pepstatin A in 1× SDS sample buffer (100 µl/35-mm dish) (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 5% 2-β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm Na3VO4). After heat denaturation, the samples (10 µg of protein) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (6–12%) and then transferred onto an Immobilon P membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membranes were subsequently treated with monoclonal antibody against either α-SMA, PDGFR-β, TGF-βR, phosphotyrosine (4G10), phopsho-Akt, or phospho-MAP kinase. Immunoreactive bands were visualized on Eastman Kodak Co. XAR5 films, using ECL detection reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After treatment with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking methionine (Life Technologies), we incubated HSC with 0.1 mCi of [35S]methionine for 24 h at 37 °C. After removal of the radioactive medium, they were incubated with NAC for the following 24 h at 37 °C. After incubation, HSC were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline. HSC were lysed by scraping into radioimmune precipitation buffer and prepared for immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described above using anti-PDGFR-β antibody followed by adsorption to protein G plus agarose. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out in 6% gels. Gels were dried and exposed to Kodak XAR5 x-ray film at −80 °C for 1 week. We measured the binding capacity of 125I-PDGF-BB to HSC cultured in 35-mm dishes as previously described (12Mori S. Heldin C-H. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 577-583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, HSC were incubated on ice for 2 h with 1 ng/ml 125I-PDGF-BB in the presence or absence of 400 ng/ml of unlabeled PDGF-BB. After incubation, radioactivity in the lysate was determined in a γ-counter (Aloka Auto well γ system ARC-2000, Tokyo, Japan). The radioactivity in the presence of unlabeled PDGF-BB was subtracted as nonspecific binding. We extracted total RNA from the cells using Isogen (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan) as described previously (17Kristensen D.B. Kawada N. Imamura K. Miyamoto Y. Tateno C. Seki S. Kuroki T. Yoshizato K. Hepatology. 2000; 32: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Total RNA (20 µg) was separated on a 1% agarose gel (Nippon Gene) and transferred onto a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After prehybridization, the membrane was incubated in the buffer supplemented with polymerase chain reaction-amplified double-stranded cDNAs, which were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a Rediprime DNA Labeling System (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), followed by autoradiography on a Kodak XAR5 x-ray film. The following primers were used: PDGFR-β, 5′-GATGTCACTGAGACGACGAT-3′ (forward) and 3′-CCTCAAACACCACCTGCAAC-5′ (reverse); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′ (forward) and 3′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-5′ (reverse). Identification of amplified DNAs was confirmed by sequencing. We incubated the immunoprecipitated PDGFR-β protein for 1 h at 37 °C with NAC (20 mm) in the presence or absence of either 0.05 unit of cathepsin B, 0.05 unit of cathepsin D, or 1 mm E64. Then the samples were subjected to 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by Western blot. We confirmed the immunoprecipitated band at 180 kDa as rat PDGFR-β by amino acid sequencing of the proteins using a Q-TOF mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, United Kingdom). We injected TAA (50 mg/body) twice a week intraperitoneally into rats (n = 15). We administered NAC (100 mg/body) simultaneously either intraperitoneally (n = 5) or orally (n= 5) every day for 6 weeks. In another model, we injected TAA for 9 weeks (n = 15), and NAC (100 mg/body) was administered either intraperitoneally (n = 5) or orally (n = 5) during the last 3 weeks. One day after the final injection, rats were anesthetized by diethylether, and the peritoneal cavity was opened. The liver was perfused with phosphate-buffered saline via the portal vein at a flow rate of 10 ml/min until the blood was completely removed from the whole liver lobules. Subsequently, the liver was removed. A part of the liver was fixed in 10% formaldehyde and used for histologic examination. The remaining part was quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use. We laparotomized rats (n = 10) and ligated the common bile ducts at the two different sites. We administered NAC (100 mg/body) intraperitoneally every day for 2 weeks (n = 5). We stained the paraffin-embedded sections (4-µm thickness) with Mallory azan, followed by morphometric analysis of fibrotic area using Mac SCOPE version 2.5 (MITANI Corp.) and Photgrab-2500 for Macintosh FUJIX SH-25/M (FUJIFILM, Tokyo, Japan). Five nonoverlapping areas were evaluated in each group. In immunohistochemistry, tissue sections were treated with 1% hydrogen peroxide, 0.1% proteinase K, and 1% Triton X-100. They were reacted with 1:50-diluted mouse monoclonal antibody against α-SMA overnight at 4 °C, followed by reaction with 1:200-diluted biotin-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2 for 1 h at room temperature. Data presented as bar graphs are the means ± S.D. of three independent experiments except for in vivo analysis of five independent experiments. Luminograms and autoradiograms are representative of at least three experiments. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test (p < 0.05 was considered significant). Treatment of HSC with NAC inhibited PDGF-BB-dependent DNA synthesis in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.1A). NAC impeded the phosphorylation of tyrosine residue of PDGFR-β and the activation of both MAP kinase and Akt dose-dependently under PDGF-BB stimulation (Fig. 1, B–D). Notably, NAC down-regulated the protein level of PDGFR-β dose-dependently (Fig.1 E). 125I-PDGF-BB binding experiments showed that pretreatment with NAC for 24 h decreased the specific binding of PDGF-BB to HSC (Fig. 1 F). These results indicate that NAC blocked PDGF-dependent signaling pathways and DNA synthesis in HSC through the down-regulation of PDGFR-β protein. NAC triggered down-regulation of PDGFR-β protein in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig.2, A and B). Since removal of NAC restored PDGFR-β, this effect of NAC was not derived from its cytotoxic action (Fig. 2 C). BSO, an inhibitor for GSH production, did not restore the down-regulation of PDGFR-β (Fig. 2 D). This result indicated that GSH endogenously produced is not involved in this effect of NAC. Northern blot analysis showed that NAC had no effect on the expression of PDGFR-β mRNA (Fig. 2 E). Metabolic labeling experiments revealed that NAC reduced de novo synthesized PDGFR-β (Fig.2 F). These results indicated that this effect of NAC was presumably due to accelerating degradation of PDGFR-β that had already been synthesized. To clarify the mechanism by which NAC down-regulates PDGFR-β protein in HSC, we tested whether protease inhibitors affected NAC-induced degradation of PDGFR-β protein. EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline are inhibitors of matrix metalloprotease; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride inhibits a serine protease; chymostatin inhibits chymotrypsin, papain, and cathepsin A, B, and D; leupeptin inhibits trypsin, plasmin, papain, and cathepsin B; E64 inhibits thiol proteases including cathepsin B, H, and L and calpain; CA074 inhibits cathepsin B; and pepstatin A inhibits cathepsin D. Among these protease inhibitors, chymostatin, leupeptin, E64, CA074, and pepstatin A hampered NAC-induced down-regulation of PDGFR-β (Fig.3A). Proteasome inhibitors such as MG115 and PSI failed to affect the degradation of PDGFR-β by NAC. These results indicate that down-regulation of PDGFR-β protein expression is mediated through its degradation by cathepsin B and/or cathepsin D. Next, we determined whether cathepsin B or cathepsin D could degrade PDGFR-β protein using in vitro degradation assays. Neither NAC alone nor cathepsin B alone had any effect on PDGFR-β protein (Fig. 3 B). However, cathepsin B in combination with NAC induced degradation of PDGFR-β protein in an E64-inhibitable manner. In contrast, cathepsin D had no effect on PDGFR-β protein level with or without NAC. These results indicate that cathepsin B is responsible for the degradation of PDGFR-β and that NAC is required for the activation of cathepsin B. Western blot analysis showed that reducing agents, such asl-cysteine, GSH, 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME), and dithiothreitol, down-regulated PDGFR-β, while l-cystine and GSSG failed to affect the PDGFR-β level (Fig. 3 C). Trolox (a water-soluble derivative of vitamin E) had no effect either. These results indicate that reducing agents play an essential role in the enhancement of the catalytic activity of cathepsin B, which is consistent with the general character of thiol proteases (13Kirschke H. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Lysosomal Cysteine Proteinases. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1998Google Scholar). Next, we tested the site where cathepsin B degraded PDGFR-β. E64-c is a membrane-impermeable derivative of E64 (14Kasai Y.S. Senshu M. Iwashita S. Imahori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). E64-d is a membrane-permeable derivative of E64 (15Hill P.A. Buttle D.J. Jones S.J. Boyde A. Murata M. Reynolds J.J. Meikle M.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 56: 118-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). CA074 is a membrane-impermeable derivative (16Buttle D.J. Murata M. Knight C.G. Barrett A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 299: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Both E64-c and CA074 were able to restore the PDGFR-β protein similarly to E64-d (Fig. 3 D). These results indicate that PDGFR-β might be degraded extracellularly by cathepsin B in the presence of NAC. In fact, mature cathepsin B as well as procathepsin B was present in the culture medium of activated HSC (Fig. 3 E). This is consistent with the report by Kristensen et al. (17Kristensen D.B. Kawada N. Imamura K. Miyamoto Y. Tateno C. Seki S. Kuroki T. Yoshizato K. Hepatology. 2000; 32: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) showing that proteome analysis detected cathepsin B in the culture supernatant of HSC. In sharp contrast to HSC, VSMC secreted procathepsin B, but not mature cathepsin B, into the culture medium (Fig. 3 E). Here, we assumed that NAC might have no effect on the expression of PDGFR-β in VSMC. As expected, NAC failed to affect both the protein level of PDGFR-β and tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFR-β under PDGF-BB stimulation in VSMC (Fig. 4, Aand B). Accordingly, NAC had no effect on the phosphorylation of MAP kinase and Akt under PDGF-BB stimulation in VSMC (Fig. 4, C and D). However, NAC blocked the DNA synthesis of VSMC under PDGF-BB stimulation in a dose-dependent manner, as previously reported (Fig.4 E) (4Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2313) Google Scholar). These results indicate that NAC may block some signal molecules except for PDGFR-β, MAP kinase, and Akt in VSMC. Next, we examined whether the above mentioned effect of NAC was specific for PDGFR-β. NAC was also found to down-regulate the expression of TGF-βRII (Fig. 5). In contrast, NAC had no effect on the expression of other receptors, such as PDGFR-α and TGF-βRI. NAC also failed to affect the level of cytoskeletous proteins, such as α-SMA, desmin, vimentin, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (Fig. 5). The above mentioned results indicated that NAC may suppress liver fibrosis by inhibiting HSC proliferation through inducing unresponsiveness to growth factors, such as PDGF-BB and TGF-β. To test this hypothesis, we prepared two different liver fibrosis models. First, we examined whether NAC could suppress thioacetamide (TAA)-induced liver fibrosis. Mallory azan staining revealed that fibrosis was well developed in the liver of rats treated with TAA for 6 weeks (fibrotic area 8.16 ± 1.24%) (Fig.6, A and K). NAC treatment either intraperitoneally or orally suppressed fibrosis of the liver (1.79 ± 0.51 or 2.51 ± 0.90%, p < 0.01) (Fig. 6, B, C, and K). Immunostaining of α-SMA, a marker of myofibroblast and activated HSC, showed that, while α-SMA-positive cells were numerous in and around fibrotic septum of TAA-treated livers (Fig. 6 G), administration of NAC suppressed the increase of α-SMA-positive cells (Fig. 6 H). This result indicated that NAC inhibited the proliferation of activated HSC also in in vivo fibrosis models. To further test whether NAC had the potential to restore the liver fibrosis that had already been developed, we started NAC treatment 6 weeks after TAA administration and excised liver tissues for histologic evaluation 3 weeks later. Liver fibrosis progressed with thick bundles of elastic fibers after 9-week administration of TAA (12.44 ± 1.74%) (Fig. 6, D and K). However, NAC treatment during the last 3 weeks either intraperitoneally or orally restored the fibrotic liver tissue to almost physiological architecture (1.79 ± 0.51 or 2.51 ± 0.90%,p < 0.01) (Fig. 6, E, F, andK). Next, we examined the effect of NAC on the bile duct ligation model. Bile duct ligation for 2 weeks induced cholestasis, periductular hepatocyte necrosis with leukocyte accumulation, and fibrosis around the portal area (3.50 ± 2.06%) (Fig. 6, I andK). When we administered NAC on a daily basis, the deposition of extracellular matrix was much less than that in nontreated rats (1.45 ± 1.49%, p < 0.05) (Fig.6, J and K). Finally, we examined whether NAC could down-regulate growth factor receptors in rat livers. Western blot analysis revealed that neither PDGFR-β protein nor TGF-βRII protein was detectable in liver tissues of rats treated with TAA and NAC (Fig. 6 L). In contrast, the protein level of PDGFR-α, TGF-βRI, and α-SMA showed limited suppression by NAC administration. These results indicate that NAC has a potential to induce degradation of both PDGFR-β and TGF-βRII in vivo. Redox regulation by intrinsic reducing suppliers, including GSH and thioredoxin, is essential to maintain intact cellular functions against oxidative stress in many mammalian cells (18Sasada T. Yodoi J. Packer L. Yodoi J. Redox Regulation of Cell Signaling and Its Clinical Application. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1999: 1-9Google Scholar). Both GSH and thioredoxin regulate cell growth and death by modulating superoxide-sensitive transcription factors, such as AP-1 and NF-κB (19Okamoto T. Yoshida S. Tetsuka T. Packer L. Yodoi J. Redox Regulation of Cell Signaling and Its Clinical Application. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1999: 261-277Google Scholar). Likewise, extrinsic reducing suppliers, such as NAC, are known to regulate cell growth by increasing intracellular GSH production. NAC has been clinically utilized for acute respiratory distress syndrome, cancer, chronic bronchitis, heart disease, heavy metal poisoning, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and acetaminophen-induced liver injury (20Kelly G.S. Alt. Med. Rev. 1997; 3: 114-127Google Scholar). Our current study provides a new insight into the pathophysiological role of redox processes. We found that the extracellular reduced condition may be an important factor for the regulation of growth factor-stimulated cellular response through the degradation of membrane receptors assisted with secreted cathepsin B. However, such a phenomenon was observed after the long term exposure of HSC to NAC. Inin vitro culture, NAC at 20 mm required 24 h for inducing complete degradation of PDGFR-β. In contrast, we found that the exposure of HSC to NAC for 30 min could also inhibit PDGF-dependent signaling without any change of PDGFR-β protein level (data not shown). Moreover, although E64 completely restored the expression of PDGFR-β at the protein level, E64-induced recovery of PDGF-dependent DNA synthesis and signaling was limited (data not shown). These results suggest that NAC may additionally modify the PDGF-induced signaling cascade by some unknown mechanism other than proteolytic action. Sundaresan et al. (4Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2313) Google Scholar) reported that, in rat VSMC, NAC blocked PDGF-induced signaling pathways, such as MAP kinase and DNA synthesis, by scavenging H2O2. Indeed, NAC removed cytosolic H2O2 in rat HSC (data not shown). However, when measured by dichlorodihydrofluolescein diacetate (DCFH-DA), HSC at 4 days after primary culture generated detectable H2O2 without any stimulation, and PDGF-BB failed to increase intracellular H2O2level, while VSMC was reported to produce H2O2only under the stimulation of PDGF (4Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2313) Google Scholar). 2H. Okuyama, Y. Shimahara, N. Kawada, S. Seki, D. B. Kristensen, K. Yoshizato, N. Uyama, and Y. Yamaoka, unpublished data. These results indicate that H2O2 may play a limited role in PDGF-dependent signaling in HSC. Cathepsin B belongs to a family of thiol proteases and localizes in lysosome. Cathepsin B has been reported to digest intracellularly antigens, immunoglobulin heavy chain, insulin A and B chain, glucagon, actin, myosin heavy chain, albumin, collagen, fibronectin, proteoglycans, fibrinogen, proplasminogen activator, and trypsinogen (13Kirschke H. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Lysosomal Cysteine Proteinases. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1998Google Scholar). However, some studies reported that malignant cells, fibroblasts, and osteoblasts secrete cathepsin B into the extracellular space (21Mort J.S. Buttle D.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell. Biol. 1997; 29: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). These cells are reported to secrete procathepsin B but not mature cathepsin B. In contrast, we detected the presence of mature-type cathepsin B in the culture medium of HSC. Some studies showed that cathepsin D is necessary for the processing of procathepsin B to mature cathepsin B (22Nishimura Y. Kawabata T. Yano S. Kato K. Acta Histochem. Cytochem. 1990; 23: 53-64Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Since pepstatin A impeded PDGFR-β degradation (Fig.3 A), it seems that cathepsin D is also involved in the activation of cathepsin B, leading to the degradation of PDGFR-β by NAC in HSC. Although the protective and antioxidative effect of NAC on hepatocytes should be taken into account, we showed that NAC down-regulated the expression of both PDGFR-β and TGF-βRII also in in vivoliver fibrosis models (23Lauterburg B.H. Corcoran G.B. Mitchell J.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 71: 980-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). TGF-β is the most potent fibrogenic factor for HSC (24Li D. Friedman S.L. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 1999; 14: 618-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Some studies reported that inhibition of TGF-β action resulted in the suppression of liver fibrosis (25George J. Roulot D. Koteliansky V.E. Bissell D.M. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12719-12724Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Hence, we assumed that cathepsin B-mediated proteolysis of TGF-βRII might contribute to the suppression of liver fibrosis in the in vivo model. More surprisingly, NAC has the potential to reverse established liver fibrosis (Fig. 6, D–F). In this context, we assume that NAC may induce cathepsin B-mediated direct degradation of extracellular matrix. In fact, some studies showed that cathepsin B degraded extracellular matrix (26Buck M.R. Karustis D.G. Day N.A. Honn K.V. Sloane B.F. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Leto et al. (27Leto G. Tumminello F.M. Pizzolanti G. Montalto G. Soresi M. Gebbia N. Oncology. 1997; 54: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) reported that in human serum the concentration of cathepsin B is significantly higher in patients with liver cirrhosis than in normal volunteers, indicating a clinical benefit of NAC for patients with liver fibrosis. We thank Yoshiko Takeda (Hiroshima Proteome Laboratory, Regional Science Promoter Program, JST) for valuable technical assistance in the analysis using a Q-TOF mass spectrometer."
https://openalex.org/W2075014636,"SPECIFIC AIMSThe purpose of this investigation was to determine the effect of hindlimb suspension (HS) on the expression of aquaporin-4 in rat soleus. We used this model of muscle disuse to determine 1) whether AQP4 might be regulated in skeletal muscle depending on the changes in muscle use and 2) whether its expression parallels the transition of muscle fibers, particularly when a slow fiber turns fast.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS1. Hindlimb suspension determines slow to fast conversion of soleus muscle fibersUnloading of rats for up to 21 days led to a progressive weight loss in the soleus muscle accompanied by changes to the pattern of MHC isoforms. The major effect of HS consisted of an increase (twofold) in fast MHC after 8 days of HS, concomitant with a similar decrease in the relative amount of slow MHC isoforms. This level did not significantly increase further after 14 and 21 days of tail suspension. This result confirmed the slow-to-fast twitch fiber conversion and shows that 8 days of tail suspension ar..."

Chem. 272, 19476–19481). To better understand the molecular mechanism of enzymaticcis-prenyl chain elongation, we selected seven charged residues in the conserved Region V and two of Phe-Ser motif in Region III of undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase of Micrococcus luteus B-P 26 for substitutions by site-directed mutagenesis and examined their effects on substrate binding and catalysis. Kinetic studies indicated that replacements of Arg-197 or Arg-203 with Ser, and Glu-216 with Gln resulted in 7–11-fold increases ofK m values for isopentenyl diphosphate and 18–1200-fold decreases of kcat values compared with those of the wild-type enzyme. In addition, two mutants with respect to the Phe-Ser motif in Region III, F73A and S74A, showed 16–32-fold larger K m values for isopentenyl diphosphate and 12–16-fold lower kcat values than those of the wild-type. Furthermore, product analysis indicated that three mutants, F73A, S74A, and E216Q, yielded shorter chain prenyl diphosphates as their main products. These facts together with the protein structural analysis recently carried out (Fujihashi, M., Zhang, Y.-W., Higuchi, Y., Li, X.-Y., Koyama, T., and Miki, K. (2001)Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 98, 4337–4342) indicated that the diphosphate moiety of homoallylic substrate is electrostatically recognized by the three charged amino acids, Arg-197, Arg-203, and Glu-216, in Region V and the Phe-Ser motif in Region III, also indispensable for homoallylic substrate binding as well as catalytic function. It was suggested that the undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase takes a different mode for the binding of isopentenyl diphosphate from that of trans-prenyl chain elongating enzymes. The primary structure ofcis-prenyltransferase is totally different from those oftrans-prenyltransferases (Shimizu, N., Koyama, T., and Ogura, K. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 19476–19481).

Although these condensation reactions are similar in terms of chemical mechanism, there are a number of enzymes having different specificities with respect to the chain length and double-bond stereochemistry of its final product. These enzymes can be classified into two major subgroups (cis and trans types) according to the geometry of the products and are extremely interesting from an enzymological viewpoint in which the reactions are regulated to proceed consecutively and terminate precisely at definite chain lengths depending on the specificities of individual enzymes (1Ogura K.

Multiple alignments of the deduced amino acid sequences of thesetrans-prenyltransferases showed the presence of several conserved regions in the primary structures (3Koyama T. Obata S. Osabe M.

On the other hand, cis-prenyltransferases catalyzecis-prenyl chain elongation to produce prenyl diphosphates with E,Z-mixed stereochemistry. In bacteria, sequentialcis addition of IPP onto FPP as an allylic primer to give undecaprenyl diphosphate (UPP, C55) is catalyzed by UPP synthase. UPP is the direct precursor of glycosyl carrier lipid in the biosynthesis of bacterial cell wall polysaccharide components such as peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharide. In eukaryotic cells, dehydrodolichyl diphosphate synthase responsible forcis-prenyl chain elongation catalyzes much longer chain elongation than does the bacterial enzyme. Dehydrodolichyl diphosphate is an essential precursor of carbohydrate carrier lipid in the biosynthesis of N-linked glycoprotein or glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoprotein. Althoughcis-prenyltransferases have been partially purified and characterized from several organisms, no information has been available about the structure of cis-prenyltransferases until our recent isolation of the gene for UPP synthase of Micrococcus luteus B-P 26 by use of the colony autoradiography method (16Shimizu N. Koyama T. Ogura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19476-19481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the primary structure of the UPP synthase is completely different from those of trans-prenyltransferases. Homologous genes for the bacterial enzyme have been identified and isolated shortly afterward from Escherichia coli, Haemeophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (17Apfel C.M. Takacs B. Fountoulakis M. Stieger M. Keck W. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 483-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RER2 gene and anArabidopsis thaliana gene have been isolated and identified to encode dehydrodolichyl diphosphate synthase responsible for the biosynthesis of dolichol in eukaryote (18Sato M. Sato K. Nishikawa S. Hirata A. Kato J. Nakano A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 71-83Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 19Oh S.K. Han K.H. Ryu S.B. Kang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18482-18488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Comparison of the primary structures of several cis-prenyl chain elongating enzymes showed the presence of five conserved regions, but the DDXXD motifs typical oftrans-prenyltransferases were completely absent (17Apfel C.M. Takacs B. Fountoulakis M. Stieger M. Keck W. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 483-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of M. luteus B-P 26 UPP synthase has recently been determined by us at 2.2-Å resolution as the first three-dimensional structure of cis-prenyl chain elongating enzymes (20Fujihashi M. Zhang Y.-W. Higuchi Y. Li X.-Y. Koyama T. Miki K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4337-4342Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). To our surprise, this enzyme shows a novel protein fold, which is totally different from the so called “isoprenoid synthase fold” that is thought to be a common structure for the enzymes relating to isoprenoid biosynthesis (21Sacchettini J.C. Poulter C.D. Science. 1997; 277: 1788-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). This fact may raise the possibility that cis-prenyltransferases take quite a different mode for substrate binding and catalysis from that oftrans-type enzymes. As the stereochemical course of prenyl chain elongation has been proved to be very similar between thetrans- and cis-prenyltransferases as far as the chemistry on the substrates during the enzymatic reaction is concerned (22Koyama T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1999; 63: 1671-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), it is of particular interest to learn the similarity and difference in the molecular mechanism of these enzymes. To obtain information about the catalytic mechanism of enzymaticcis-prenyl chain elongation, seven of the conserved charged amino acid residues (Glu-193, Arg-197, Glu-201, Arg-203, Glu-216, Asp-221, and Asp-226) in Region V and two conserved residues (Phe-Ser motif, Phe-73 and Ser-74) in Region III of M. luteus B-P 26 UPP synthase were selected for substitutions by site-directed mutagenesis. This paper describes elucidation of Phe-73, Ser-74, Arg-197, Arg-203, and Glu-216, which participate in the binding of homoallylic substrate and catalytic function duringcis-prenyl chain elongation. [1-14C]IPP (1.95 TBq/mol) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.Nonlabeled IPP, FPP, and (Z,E,E)-GGPP (Z-GGPP) were synthesized according to the procedure of Davisson et. al. (23Davisson V.J. Woodside A.B. Neal T.R. Stremler K.E. Muehlbacher M. Poulter C.D. J. Org. Chem. 1986; 51: 4768-4779Crossref Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes and other DNA-modifying enzymes were from Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd. and Toyobo Co., Ltd. Potato acid phosphatase was a product of Sigma. E. coli B strain BL21 (DE3) was used as the host for expression of the target gene. Restriction enzyme digestions, transformations, and other standard molecular biology techniques were carried out as described by Sambrooket al. (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Bacteria were cultured in Luria-Bertani (LB) or M9YG medium (3Koyama T. Obata S. Osabe M. Takeshita A. Yokoyama K. Uchida M. Nishino T. Ogura K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). All other chemicals were of analytical grade. The protein sequence data base Swiss-Prot was searched to find amino acid sequences similar to that ofM. luteus B-P 26 UPP synthase. Multialignment of amino acid sequences was performed using GENETYX genetic information processing software (Software Development). The M. luteus B-P 26 UPP synthase gene (16Shimizu N. Koyama T. Ogura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19476-19481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using appropriate primers. The sense and antisense primers, 5′-CGAGGTTCATATGTTTCCAATTAAG-3′ and 5′ CATGATTGGATCCTTATAATCCACC-3′ (newly created restriction sites are underlined), were designed to create an NdeI site overlapping the starting codon, ATG, and a BamHI site downstream of the stop codon, TAA, respectively. The polymerase chain reaction product, which was digested with NdeI andBamHI, was separated on a 0.8% agarose gel. The desired band was eluted and ligated into the same sites of pET22b vector (Novagen), yielding an expression plasmid for M. luteus B-P 26 UPP synthase, pMluUEX. The recombinant plasmid constructed was then used for transformation of E. coli BL21 (DE3). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to the protocol of the GeneEditor in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega). The single-stranded wild-type UPP synthase gene, used as a template in the mutagenesis reaction, was prepared by R408 helper phage infection ofE. coli JM109 cells (Takara) that contained pMluUEX. The mutagenic oligonucleotides (20–30 bases long) were designed to produce the desired point mutations and generate mutation plasmids (pMluUEXs; see Table I). Introduction of the mutation was confirmed by sequencing the whole nucleotide sequences using the dideoxy chain-termination method (25Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52505) Google Scholar) with a DNA sequencer (Li-Cor, model 4200).Table ISite-directed mutations in M. luteus B-P 26 UPP synthaseNucleotidesPlasmidRegionAmino acidMutant nameGAG to CAGpMluUEX193VGlu to GlnE193QAGA to AGTpMluUEX197VArg to SerR197SGAA to CAApMluUEX201VGlu to GlnE201QCGT to AGCpMluUEX203VArg to SerR203SGAG to CAGpMluUEX216VGlu to GlnE216QGAT to GCTpMluUEX221VAsp to AlaD221AGAT to GCTpMluUEX226VAsp to AlaD226ATTT to GCTpMluUEX73IIIPhe to AlaF73ATCA to GCApMluUEX74IIISer to AlaS74AMutagenic oligonucleotides (20–30 bases long) were designed to produce the desired point mutations, and oligonucleotide-mediated mutation reactions were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Open table in a new tab Mutagenic oligonucleotides (20–30 bases long) were designed to produce the desired point mutations, and oligonucleotide-mediated mutation reactions were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Each of the mutated plasmids was used for transformation of E. coli BL21 (DE3), and the overnight culture of E. coli cells carrying the pMluUEX plasmid in LB medium containing 50 µg/ml ampicillin was inoculated into a 250-fold volume of M9YG medium containing 50 µg/ml ampicillin. The cells were grown at 37 °C to an A 600 value of 0.3, and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and then the incubation was continued for an additional 3 h at 30 °C. Overproduction of the proteins was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The E. coli cells that overproduced a mutated enzyme were harvested and disrupted by sonication in TE buffer (10 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm EDTA). The protein fraction precipitated from the 100,000 × g supernatant by 30–60% saturation with ammonium sulfate was dissolved in TE buffer containing ammonium sulfate at 30% saturation and chromatographed on a phenyl-Sepharose HP column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with elution of a decreasing linear gradient of ammonium sulfate from 30 to 0% saturation. The UPP synthase fractions were desalted on a HiTrap desalting column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), applied to a Mono Q HR 5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and eluted with a stepwise gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl in TE buffer. The fractions of the mutated enzyme were analyzed for purity by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining, and the fractions that showed more than 90% purity were used for further characterization. Protein concentrations were measured by the method of Bradford (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214435) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The enzyme activity was measured by determination of the amount of [1-14C]IPP incorporated into butanol-extractable polyprenyl diphosphates. The incubation mixture contained, in a final volume of 0.2 ml, 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.3, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 15 µm FPP or Z-GGPP, 15 µm [1-14C]IPP (37 MBq/mol), 0.05% (w/v) Triton X-100, and a suitable amount of enzyme solution. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the reaction products were extracted with 1-butanol saturated with water, and the radioactivity in the butanol extract was measured with an Aloka LSC-1000 liquid scintillation counter. For kinetic studies the concentration of allylic substrate FPP/Z-GGPP or homoallylic substrate [1-14C]IPP was varied, while the other substrate [1-14C]IPP or FPP/Z-GGPP was kept constant at 200 or 500 µm, respectively. Calculation of kinetic parameters was performed using EnzymeKinetics software, version 1.5 (Trinity Software). To analyze the radioactive prenyl diphosphate products in the reaction mixture, the products were hydrolyzed to the corresponding alcohols with potato acid phosphatase according to our method reported previously (27Koyama T. Fujii H. Ogura K. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 110: 153-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The alcohols were extracted with pentane and analyzed by reversed phase TLC plates (LKC-18, Whatman) with a solvent system of acetone/water (19/1). The positions of authentic standards were visualized with iodine vapor, and the distribution of radioactivity was detected by autoradiography. The TLC plates were exposed on a Fuji imaging plate at room temperature for 1 day and then analyzed with a Fuji BAS 1000 Mac bioimage analyzer. Relative amounts of products were calculated from the intensities of the photostimulated luminescence on the imaging plate. Fig. 1shows the amino acid sequence alignment of Region V and the Phe-Ser motif in Region III of several cis-prenyltransferases. This alignment reveals that Region V contains seven highly conserved charged amino acids, including five negatively charged residues (three Glu residues at the positions of 193, 201, and 216 and two Asp residues at the positions of 221 and 226) and two positively charged Arg residues at positions 197 and 203 in the M. luteus B-P 26 UPP synthase. In Region III, two amino acid residues corresponding to positions 73 and 74 inM. luteus B-P 26 UPP synthase, Phe and Ser, were highly conserved among cis-prenyltransferases. According to the three-dimensional structure of M. luteus B-P 26 UPP synthase determined recently (20Fujihashi M. Zhang Y.-W. Higuchi Y. Li X.-Y. Koyama T. Miki K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4337-4342Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), the Phe-Ser motif is located at the position adjacent to a high electrostatic potential region formed by the conserved charged amino acids of Region V. To examine the significance of these conservative charged amino acid residues in Region V and the Phe-Ser motif in Region III in catalytic function, site-directed mutagenesis was carried out on M. luteus B-P 26 UPP synthase. The Glu at position 193, 201, or 216 was changed to Gln (E193Q, E201Q, and E216Q), and the Arg at position 197 or 203 was replaced with Ser (R197S and R203S), respectively, so that the region had no charge. The Asp at position 221 or 226, Phe at position 73, or Ser at position 74 was changed to an aliphatic amino acid, Ala (D221A, D226A, F73A, and S74A), respectively. Oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis was conducted using the plasmid pMluUEx, which carries the wild-type UPP synthase gene, to obtain the expression plasmids, pMluUExs (TableI), for these mutated enzymes. After transformation of E. coli BL21 (DE3) with each of the expression plasmids, the UPP synthase mutant was overproduced inE. coli cells and purified by three chromatographic steps. All the mutated enzymes showed chromatographic properties similar to those of the wild-type UPP synthase during the purification procedures. SDS-PAGE analyses with Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining showed that the purity of these mutant enzymes was more than 90%. Baba and Allen (28Baba T. Allen C.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 200: 474-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that M. luteus UPP synthase requires divalent metal ions for its enzymatic activity. In our current analysis, Mg2+ is the most effective among the metal ions tested. The optimal concentration of Mg2+ is 240 nm when 60 nm enzyme was used, suggesting that one UPP synthase molecule utilizes four molecules of Mg2+ for its catalytic function. The enzymatic activity reached a plateau at 240 nm Mg2+ and stayed at that level up to 600 nm. Zn2+ shows an optimal concentration similar to Mg2+ for activation of the enzyme; however, the enzymatic activity was decreased rapidly above the concentration. On the other hand, Mn2+, Ca2+, or Co2+ shows a weak stimulation on the enzymatic activity compared with Mg2+ or Zn2+. Elimination of the metal ions from reaction mixture by EDTA resulted in inactivation of the enzyme. Kinetic constants of these mutated enzymes as well as the wild-type were determined by employing [1-14C]IPP and FPP orZ-GGPP as substrates, and the results are listed in TableII. All of the nine mutated enzymes showed comparable Michaelis constants (K m) for allylic substrate FPP or Z-GGPP with those of the wild-type UPP synthase. In addition, the four mutants, E193Q, E201Q, D221A, and D226A, showed K m values for homoallylic substrate IPP within moderate folds to that of the wild-type and slightly decreased enzymatic activities. However, the substitution of positively charged residue Arg-197 or Arg-203 with Ser and the negatively charged amino acid Glu-216 with Gln resulted in 7–11-fold largerK m values for IPP and 18–1200-fold lowerkcat values than those of the wild-type. Furthermore, compared with the wild-type enzyme, the mutants, with respect to Phe-73 or Ser-74, F73A and S74A, showed 16–32-fold increases in K m values for IPP and 12–16-fold decreases in kcat values.Table IIKinetic constants of the mutated UPP synthasesEnzymeK m(IPP)2-aFor the reaction with FPP.K m(FPP)K m(Z-GGPP)k cat (× 103)2-bThe k cat values were calculated from the V max values in the reactions with FPP as the allylic substrate.µmµmµms−1WT7.8 ± 2.88.3 ± 1.38.2 ± 4.11220 ± 64E193Q20.4 ± 3.26.6 ± 1.88.1 ± 1.8401 ± 31R197S56.1 ± 21.418.0 ± 2.66.0 ± 0.91.00 ± 0.06E201Q18.3 ± 6.211.6 ± 1.117.7 ± 5.6980 ± 37R203S62.1 ± 38.513.6 ± 1.88.1 ± 1.01.00 ± 0.05E216Q90.9 ± 30.85.4 ± 0.95.8 ± 1.767 ± 3.6D221A17.7 ± 5.63.5 ± 2.418.1 ± 5.7471 ± 72D226A17.0 ± 6.311.2 ± 2.67.5 ± 2.4999 ± 90F73A252.5 ± 62.49.2 ± 3.39.4 ± 0.973 ± 9.0S74A126.8 ± 33.89.6 ± 1.45.3 ± 1.4101 ± 5.4Kinetic constants of nine mutated UPP synthases were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Thek cat value was determined from the amounts of radioactivity incorporated into 1-butanol-extractable products when [1-14C]IPP and the indicated allylic substrate were used.2-a For the reaction with FPP.2-b The k cat values were calculated from the V max values in the reactions with FPP as the allylic substrate. Open table in a new tab Kinetic constants of nine mutated UPP synthases were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Thek cat value was determined from the amounts of radioactivity incorporated into 1-butanol-extractable products when [1-14C]IPP and the indicated allylic substrate were used. One microgram each of the purified mutated enzyme as well as the wild-type was used for enzymatic reaction to analyze its reaction products. After enzymatic reaction at 37 °C for 6 h using [1-14C]IPP and FPP as substrates, the radioactive prenyl diphosphate products were hydrolyzed to the corresponding alcohols. TLC analyses of the alcohols are shown in Fig. 2. Six mutants, including E193Q, R197S, E201Q, R203S, D221A, and D226A, showed product distribution patterns similar to that of the wild-type enzyme, which produced UPP (C55) as its major product as well as minor amounts of some intermediates having shorter prenyl chains and C60 product. Compared with the wild-type or other mutant enzymes, R197S and R203S have lower reaction rates in catalysis and produced fewer products in the 6-h reaction. The reactions for both mutants in the shorter time intervals still produced the C55product but in smaller amounts (data not shown). However, the product distributions of F73A, S74A, and E216Q mutants are significantly different from the wild-type. Replacement of Phe-73 or Ser-74 with Ala or Glu-216 with Gln resulted in shortening the chain length of the major product. S74A and E216Q produced major products containing C35 and C50 prenyl chain lengths, whereas a mixture of C30 and C35products became major by the reaction with F73A. The extended reaction time or increased protein amount resulted in an increase in the formation of some long chain intermediates such as C35, C40, C45, and C50 and no significant change in the product distribution pattern for the three mutated enzymes, F73A, S74A, and E216Q (data not shown). Heat stabilities of the UPP synthase mutants were examined by analyzing their remaining activity after heat treatment at various temperatures for 30 min. All of the mutants exhibited thermostability profiles comparable with that of the wild-type UPP synthase (data not shown). UPP, a product of UPP synthase, was known to be an essential precursor in bacterial cell wall construction. Disruption in normal expression of the enzyme is lethal for bacteria (29Kato J. Fujisaki S. Nakajima K. Nishimura Y. Sato M. Nakano A. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2733-2738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, a better understanding of the enzymology of cis-prenyl chain elongation will provide a practical strategy for designing new antimicrobial molecules. The fact that all the mutant enzymes with respect to Regions III and V investigated in this work showed comparable K mvalues for allylic substrate FPP or Z-GGPP to those of the wild-type UPP synthase suggests that none of the seven charged amino acids in Region V and the two conserved residues in Region III is involved in the binding of allylic substrate. On the other hand, replacements of the positively charged residue Arg-197 or Arg-203 with Ser and the negatively charged residue Glu-216 with Gln resulted in 7–11-fold larger K m values for IPP and markedly decreased kcat values compared with the wild-type enzyme. The kcat value of E216Q showed an 18-fold decrease, while the substitution of Arg-197 or Arg-203 with Ser brought about a 1200-fold decrease to that of the wild-type. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the three conserved amino acid residues, Arg-197, Arg-203, and Glu-216, participate in the binding of IPP as well as catalytic function. According to the results, we propose a hypothetical binding model for homoallylic substrate IPP to the UPP synthase as shown in Fig. 3. The diphosphate moiety of IPP binds directly with the positively charged guanidinium groups of Arg-197 and Arg-203 but binds with the carboxyl group of Glu-216, possibly through a Mg2+ bridge. The two positively charged amino acids, Arg-197 and Arg-203, seem to be more important for catalytic function than Glu-216, because replacement of one of the Arg residues led to a heavy decrease in enzymatic activity. The two Arg residues with the Glu-216 residue from the other subunit, forming a charged triangle region, seem to be employed for IPP binding, because the Glu-216 in the same subunit with the two Arg residues resides in a remote position in the homodimeric structure of M. luteus B-P 26 UPP synthase, while the Glu-216 residue in the other subunit is located near to the two Arg residues (Fig.3 a). The two mutants with respect to the conserved Phe-Ser motif in Region III, F73A and S74A, showed highly increased K mvalues for IPP with decreased kcat values. These results indicate that not only the binding affinity for IPP but also the catalytic function are affected by these amino acid replacements. This Phe-Ser (FS) motif resides in the position adjacent to the charged triangle formed by Arg-197, Arg-203, and Glu-216 (Fig. 3 a). Thus, it is suggested that the highly conserved FS motif also plays an important role to contribute to the binding of IPP as well as catalytic function. Phe-73 seems to exert its hydrophobic nature on the hydrocarbon moiety of IPP, whereas Ser-74 may bind to the diphosphate group of IPP with hydrogen bonding. Replacement of Phe-73 with Ala may also alter the position of the hydroxyl group on Ser-74, which should be in a suitable proximity to the diphosphate moiety of IPP, resulting in a 16-fold decreased kcat value of F73A. The UPP synthase reaction may be triggered by the elimination of the diphosphate ion of an allylic diphosphate to form an allylic cation at C1, which is attacked by the π electron at C4′ of IPP with the formation of a new C–C bond between C1 and C4′ as observed previously in FPP synthase reaction (30Poulter C.D. Rilling H.C. Acc. Chem. Res. 1978; 11: 307-311Crossref Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The present binding scheme of IPP to the UPP synthase shows that the five residues, Phe-73, Ser-74, Arg-197, Arg-203, and Glu-216, cooperatively bind the IPP molecule so as to hold the substrate molecule in the proper direction and to make C4′ of IPP to be close to C1 of FPP necessary for stereospecific condensation reaction (Fig. 3 b). Unlike the R197S and R203S mutants, which showed 103 lowerkcat values but still produced UPP (C55) as their main products, F73A, S74A, and E216Q showed significant differences in product chain length distribution from the wild-type enzyme. Replacement of Ser-74 with Ala or Glu-216 with Gln resulted in shortening the chain length of the major product, but the two mutants could produce a detectable amount of UPP (Fig. 2,lanes 3 and 8). However, a large amount of intermediate products (C30 and C35) instead of UPP was produced by the F73A mutant (Fig. 2, lane 2). The Phe residue corresponding to position 73 in M. luteus B-P 26 UPP synthase is completely conserved among bacterial UPP synthases as well as eukaryotic dehydrodolichyl diphosphate synthases (Fig. 1). However, the recently cloned short cis-prenyl chain elongating enzyme Rv1086, which catalyzes the formation ofE,Z-FPP, from Mycobacterium tuberculosis has a Leu residue at the corresponding position (31Schulbach M.C. Brennan P.J. Crick D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22876-22881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Among trans-prenyltransferases the aromatic amino acid residue that is located at the fifth position upstream to the first DDXXD motif in chicken/B. stearothermophilus FPP synthase forms the floor of the putative allylic substrate binding pocket and is essential for controlling product chain length intrans-prenyl chain elongation (10Wang K. Ohnuma S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 445-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 15Tarshis L.C. Proteau P.J. Kellogg B.A. Sacchettini J.C. Poulter C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15018-15023Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The conserved Phe-73 in M. luteus B-P 26 UPP synthase seems to have a completely different function from that of the aromatic amino acid intrans-prenyltransferases. It is noteworthy that the three mutants, F73A, S74A, and E216Q, showed markedly increasedK m values for IPP. The K m value for IPP of E216Q or S74A increased by 11- or 16-fold, while the substitution of Phe-73 with Ala brought about a 32-fold increase compared with the wild-type. The reason that these substitutions at Phe-73, Ser-74, or Glu-216 in the M. luteus B-P 26 UPP synthase led to shortening product chain length may be explained if the replacement results in the severe decrease of IPP binding, which may bring about relatively slow late IPP condensation to accumulate shorter prenyl chain intermediates. It is noticeable that the UPP synthase takes a different mode for the binding of homoallylic substrate IPP from that oftrans-prenyl chain elongating enzymes. It has been suggested that cis-prenyl chain elongating enzymes have evolved from a different ancestor from that of trans-prenyltransferases (16Shimizu N. Koyama T. Ogura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19476-19481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To accelerate the understanding of the molecular mechanism of enzymatic cis-prenyl chain elongation, further studies on the structure-function relationship of cis-prenyl chain elongating enzyme are in progress involving site-directed mutagenesis as well as x-ray crystallographic analysis of the M. luteusB-P 26 UPP synthase with substrates bound."

This finding is detected in yeast two-hybrid systems as well as in protein precipitation experiments in vitro and in vivo. Apo D and Ob-Rb are coexpressed in neurons of the hypothalamic arcuate and paraventricular nuclei that are known to be involved in eating and body weight regulation. Moreover, hypothalamic level of Apo D mRNA is stimulated by dietary fat. It is also significantly elevated in rats and inbred mice that become obese on a highfat diet, compared with their lean controls, and is strongly, positively correlated with body fat mass and circulating leptin levels. This positive association with body fat, however, is lost in obese ob/ob- and db-/db- mice, which exhibit markedly reduced levels of hypothalamic Apo D mRNA compared with that of wild-type mice. These results suggest that Apo D in the hypothalamus is involved in the leptin/Ob-Rb signal transduction pathway that controls body fat accumulation on a high-fat diet."

Here we explore the structural basis of signal transduction in DctD, a two-component response regulator and bacterial enhancer binding protein that is essential for biological nitrogen fixation by Sinorhizobium meliloti.PRINCIPAL FINDINGSThe DctD protein has three domains: an amino-terminal regulatory domain; a central ς54-dependent ATPase domain; and a carboxyl-terminal DNA binding domain. Earlier studies showed that the carboxyl-terminal third of the DctD receiver domain exerts a negative affect on its central ATPase domain. Phosphorylation of the receiver domain overcomes this inhibition via an unknown mechanism.1.

https://openalex.org/W1980896503,"Acetyl-CoA carboxylase catalyzes the first committed step in fatty acid synthesis in all plants, animals, and bacteria. The <i>Escherichia coli</i> form is a multimeric protein complex consisting of three distinct and separate components: biotin carboxylase, carboxyltransferase, and the biotin carboxyl carrier protein. The biotin carboxylase component catalyzes the ATP-dependent carboxylation of biotin using bicarbonate as the carboxylate source and has a distinct architecture that is characteristic of the ATP-grasp superfamily of enzymes. Included in this superfamily are d-Ala d-Ala ligase, glutathione synthetase, carbamyl phosphate synthetase,<i>N</i> <sup>5</sup>-carboxyaminoimidazole ribonucleotide synthetase, and glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase, all of which have known three-dimensional structures and contain a number of highly conserved residues between them. Four of these residues of biotin carboxylase, Lys-116, Lys-159, His-209, and Glu-276, were selected for site-directed mutagenesis studies based on their structural homology with conserved residues of other ATP-grasp enzymes. These mutants were subjected to kinetic analysis to characterize their roles in substrate binding and catalysis. In all four mutants, the<i>K</i> <sub>m</sub> value for ATP was significantly increased, implicating these residues in the binding of ATP. This result is consistent with the crystal structures of several other ATP-grasp enzymes, which have shown specific interactions between the corresponding homologous residues and cocrystallized ADP or nucleotide analogs. In addition, the maximal velocity of the reaction was significantly reduced (between 30- and 260-fold) in the 4 mutants relative to wild type. The data suggest that the mutations have misaligned the reactants for optimal catalysis."

We dissected the downstream signaling pathways of an oncogenic variant of IGFR, Gag-IGFR, called NM1. Loss of function mutants of NM1, Phe-1136 and dS2, that retain kinase activity but are attenuated in their transforming ability were used to identify signaling pathways that are important for transformation of NIH 3T3 cells. MAPK, phospholipase Cγ, and Stat3 were activated to the same extent by NM1 and its two mutants, suggesting that activation of these pathways, individually or in combination, was not sufficient for NM1-induced cell transformation. The mutant dS2 has decreased IRS-1 phosphorylation levels and IRS-1-associated phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase activity, suggesting that this impairment may be in part responsible for the defectiveness of dS2. We show that Rho family members, RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 are activated by NM1, and this activation, particularly RhoA and Cdc42, is attenuated in both mutants of NM1. Dominant negative mutants of Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 inhibited NM1-induced cell transformation, as measured by focus and colony forming ability. Dominant negative Rho most potently inhibited the focus forming activity, whereas Cdc42 was most effective in inhibiting the colony forming ability of NM1-expressing cells.

Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5531-5534PubMed Google Scholar) has been shown to inhibit the growth of tumor cells in culture and abolish or delay the progression of a variety of tumors in animal models. These studies strongly suggest that overexpression or constitutive activation of IGFR plays an important role in the development of various tumors in humans. Truncations, internal deletions, point mutations, and amplifications of receptor protein-tyrosine kinases have been shown to lead to their activation and enable them to promote cell transformation and oncogenicity (13Aaronson S.A. Science. 1991; 254: 1146-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). Fusion of PTKs to viral proteins such as Gag has been observed in a great number of naturally isolated oncogenes (14Liu D. Wang L.H. J. Biomed. Sci. 1994; 1: 65-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Complete deletion of the extracellular domain and fusion of the remaining transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of IGFR to the viral Gag protein of an avian sarcoma virus, UR2, resulted in a constitutively activated and highly oncogenic Gag-IGFR fusion protein that we designated NM1 (Fig. 1 A) (15Liu D. Rutter W. Wang L.H. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 9-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Liu D. Rutter W.J. Wang L.H. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 374-385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NM1-induced molecular signaling is indistinguishable qualitatively from those of ligand-activated IGFR (15Liu D. Rutter W. Wang L.H. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 9-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Liu D.

Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 842: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Therefore, NM1 is a suitable model for studying the role of activated or overexpressed IGFR in human malignancy. Expression of NM1 in CEF and NIH 3T3 cells resulted in cell transformation (15Liu D. Rutter W. Wang L.H. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 9-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Jiang Y. Chan J.L.K. Zong C.S.

In a mutational study where the tyrosines in the cytoplasmic domain of the NM1 Gag-IGFR were systematically mutated to phenylalanines, we found that the mutant Phe-1136 (Y1136F), in which the third tyrosine of the triple tyrosine cluster within the activation loop of IGFR was replaced with phenylalanine, possessed wild type kinase activity but had reduced transforming potential (17Jiang Y. Chan J.L.K. Zong C.S. Wang L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 60-167Google Scholar). This result is consistent with the study done in an IGFR knockout cell line (R− cell) (10Li S. Ferber A. Miura M. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32558-32564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of the full-length IGFR with Tyr-1136 mutation in R− cells could not promote the optimal growth and colony formation of these cells upon IGF-1 stimulation (10Li S. Ferber A. Miura M. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32558-32564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The replacement of tyrosine 950, which serves as the docking site for IRS-1, with phenylalanine did not affect the transforming potential of the Gag-IGFR fusion protein in the CEF system. An additional deletion of 19 aa in the juxtamembrane region of NM1 Gag-IGFR, including tyrosine 950, resulted in a mutant, dS2, that retains kinase activity but has severely reduced transforming ability (17Jiang Y. Chan J.L.K. Zong C.S. Wang L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 60-167Google Scholar). Cell transformation is a multifactorial process. Alterations in cell-cell and cell-substratum interactions along with the reorganization of cytoskeletal structures are among the important aspects of malignant cell transformation. The Rho family of small GTPases is an important regulator of cytoskeletal reorganization (reviewed in Ref. 20Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar). These small GTPases cycle between an active GTP-bound state and an inactive GDP-bound state. Their activation is catalyzed by GEFs. GTPase-activating proteins stimulate the weak intrinsic GTPase activity of the GTP-binding proteins, thereby leading to their inactivation. A major function attributed to Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 is the control of the formation of polymerized actin structures and assembly of associated integrin complexes. RhoA activation results in the formation of actin stress fibers and the assembly of focal adhesion complexes (21Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3843) Google Scholar). Rac1 activation stimulates polymerization of actin at the plasma membrane to induce lamellipodia formation and surface membrane ruffling (22Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekman D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3084) Google Scholar, 23Nobes C.D. Hawkins P. Stephens L. Hall A. J. Cell Sci. (suppl.). 1995; 8: 35-54Google Scholar). Cdc42 is believed to regulate the formation of filopodia (24Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1942-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar, 25Manser E. Loo T.H.

Stephens L. Hall A. J. Cell Sci. (suppl.). 1995; 8: 35-54Google Scholar) have established a hierarchy of activation of Rho/Rac/Cdc42 in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, wherein Cdc42 activates Rac, which in turn activates Rho. Activated forms of both Rac1 and Cdc42 can induce the formation of focal complexes that contain integrins and focal adhesion molecules. Growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor and insulin can stimulate actin polymerization at the plasma membrane to induce lamellipodia formation and surface membrane ruffling in many cell types in a Rac-regulated fashion (23Nobes C.D. Hawkins P. Stephens L. Hall A. J. Cell Sci. (suppl.). 1995; 8: 35-54Google Scholar). Vav, a Rac-GEF, has been shown to be regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation and may provide a link between membrane receptors and GTPase activation (26Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). PI3 kinase appears to function upstream of Rac for the induction of cytoskeletal rearrangements such as membrane ruffling induced by growth factor (23Nobes C.D. Hawkins P. Stephens L. Hall A. J. Cell Sci. (suppl.). 1995; 8: 35-54Google Scholar,27Kotani K. Yonezawa K. Hara K. Ueda H. Kitamura Y. Sakaue H. Ando A. Chavanieu A. Calas B. Grigorescu F.

Biol. 1995; 5: 393-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Regulation of two Rac GEFs, Vav and Sos-1, by the PI3 kinase product, phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, is a plausible mechanism of PI3 kinase activation of Rac (29Han J. Luby-Phelps K.

Science. 1998; 279: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). In addition to playing a role in cytoskeletal remodeling, Rho GTPases have been shown to play an important role in other cellular processes such as transcriptional activation and cell growth control. They have been shown to be required for G1 to S cell cycle progression and DNA synthesis (31Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A.Y. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). Several studies have indicated a role for Rho family GTPases in cell transformation, although these studies have primarily been restricted to those involving Ras (32Khosravi-Far R. Solaski P.A.

A. 1995; 92: 11781-11785Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). The role of Rho family GTPases in cell transformation mediated by receptor protein-tyrosine kinases has yet to be defined. It also remains to be established whether the ability of Rho family GTPases to regulate actin re-organization and cell adhesion is necessary for their role in transformation. Additionally, which of the several downstream effectors of Rho family GTPases is required for this role remains to be determined. In this study we have dissected the known downstream signaling pathways of IGFR, focusing on the GTPases-mediated signaling, in an effort to understand the mechanism of cell transformation mediated by the NM1 Gag-IGFR. Since the kinase-positive, transformation-attenuated mutants, Phe-1136 and dS2, serve as useful tools for identifying substrates that are important for cell transformation induced by NM1, we attempted to identify the downstream signaling pathways that might be impaired in these mutants. Our results suggest that the MAP kinase and the PI3 kinase pathways are required but not sufficient for NM1-mediated cell transformation. Signal transduction pathways mediated by the Rho family GTPases are vital components of the oncogenic IGFR-induced cell transformation. We show that the members of the Rho family GTPases are activated by NM1 and are required for NM1-induced cell transformation. Moreover, our results suggest that Rho appears to play a more important role in promoting escape of contact inhibition, whereas Cdc42 seems to be more important for anchorage-independent growth. The construction of oncogenic Gag-IGFR (NM1) and NM1 mutants, Phe-1136 and dS2, has been described previously (Fig. 1) (15Liu D. Rutter W. Wang L.H. J.

HA-tagged activated and dominant negative constructs were generated by subcloning each of the constructs into an HA tag containing vector pCEV29HA-JNK (kindly provided by Dr. Andrew Chan at Mount Sinai). The HA-tagged constructs were then transferred into phEF Neo.pGEX-GST-PAK CRIB that contains the p21 (Cdc42/Rac1) binding domain of human PAK1 (aa 70–132) which was a gift from Dr. Bruce Mayer (Howard Hughes Medical Institute/Children's Hospital). pGEX-2TH-GST-ACK42 containing the Cdc42 binding domain of human ACK-1 (aa 504–545) has been described (32Khosravi-Far R. Solaski P.A. Clark G.J. Kinch M.S. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6443-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). pGEX-4T2-GST-Rok containing the Rho binding domain of Rokα (aa 809–1062) was constructed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the Rokα cDNA, which was a gift from Drs. T. Leung and Ed Manser of the Glaxo-IMCB Laboratory, Singapore. A 5′-primer (5′-GGGGGATCC AACACCCTAAAAATGTCA-3′) containing a BamHI site and a 3′-primer (5′-GGGCCGGAATTC CTTAAGCTCCATATGTAA-3′) containing an EcoRI site were used to amplify the region between aa 809 and 1062 of the Rokα cDNA. The subsequent polymerase chain reaction fragment was cloned in the PGEM®-T vector (Promega). The insert was released using BamHI andEcoRI and inserted into the corresponding sites in pGEX-4T2 vector (Promega). COS-7 cells and NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% calf serum. COS-7 and NIH 3T3 cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation, as described previously (39Zong C.S. Zeng L. Jiang Y. Sadowski H.B. Wang L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28065-28072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). For COS-7 transient transfection assays, cells were transfected at 60–70% cell confluency. Stable transfections and focus formation assay using NIH 3T3 cells have been described previously (19Li W. Jiang Y. Zhang J. Soon L. Flechner L. Kapoor V. Pierce J. Wang L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5888-5898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.5 × 105 cells were plated in 10-cm tissue culture plates 1 day before transfection. Equal amounts of precipitated DNA were added to two separate plates for each transfecting sample. One of these plates was cultured in DMEM containing 5% calf serum for the focus formation assay, whereas the other plate was selected in medium containing geneticin. The number of drug-resistant colonies formed per plate was determined in order to ensure that equivalent amounts of DNA were utilized and that comparable transfection efficiencies were obtained. Media were changed twice a week following the transfection. Two weeks after transfection, the non-selected plates were fixed, stained with Giemsa dye (Sigma), and photographed for assessing focus formation. The selected plates were enumerated for the drug-resistant colonies, and these colonies were pooled together to generate pooled cultures that were used for further biochemical studies and for soft agar colony formation assay (see below). The soft agar assay measuring anchorage-independent growth has been reported elsewhere (19Li W. Jiang Y. Zhang J. Soon L. Flechner L. Kapoor V. Pierce J. Wang L.H. Mol. Cell.

Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer, and the equivalent amount of protein was incubated with the respective primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation with protein A-agarose beads (Repligen) for 1 h. The beads were washed three times in the lysis buffer, resuspended in appropriate volume of Laemmli buffer, and subjected to Western blot analysis as described previously (17Jiang Y. Chan J.L.K.

The filters were blocked in either 5% milk or 1% bovine serum albumin in TBST buffer (Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, 1% Tween 20) and probed with primary antibodies followed by secondary antibody conjugated to HRP in blocking solution and then developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagent (ECL) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In vitro autophosphorylation, MAP kinase, and PI3 kinase assays were performed as described previously (15Liu D. Rutter W. Wang L.H. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 9-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Jiang Y. Chan J.L.K. Zong C.S. Wang L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 60-167Google Scholar). Parental NIH 3T3 cells were seeded 24 h before transfection. Transient transfection was performed using calcium phosphate transfection method. 24 h later, cells were trypsinized, counted, and seeded onto coverslips placed in 35-mm dishes at the density of 1 × 105 cells/dish. Cells were washed with 1× Hanks' balanced salt solution (Life Technologies, Inc.) and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde, 0.05% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 20 min. After rinsing with 1× Hanks' three times, the coverslips were blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. Cells were incubated with anti-Gag antibody (AMV-3C2, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA) for 2 h followed by washing three times with 1× Hanks' before subjecting to incubation with anti-rabbit secondary antibody coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate along with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin for 1 h. Following three washes in 1× Hanks' solution, the coverslips were mounted on microscope slides using ProLong Antifade Kit (Molecular Probes, Inc.) and examined under the fluorescence microscope. The assay was performed essentially according to a procedure published previously (33Nur-E-Kamal M.S. Kamal J.M. Qureshi M.M. Maruta H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7787-7793Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The synthesis of the fusion polypeptides GST-Rok, GST-ACK, and GST-PAK CRIB encoded in their respective plasmids were induced inEscherichia coli with 0.4 mmisopropyl-β-galactopyranoside at 32 °C for 4 h and affinity-purified using 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the Batch Purification method provided by the manufacturer. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with phEF HA-tagged wt Rac, wt Rho, or wt Cdc42 along with either the control vector pDEF or pDEF NM1, Phe-1136, or dS2. 24 h post-transfection the cells were starved overnight in serum-free DMEM. Cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% Trasylol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm MgCl2). 500 µg of protein lysate from various transfected cells were mixed with 20 µg of GST-PAK CRIB, GST-Rok, or GST-ACK beads and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed three times in lysis buffer and analyzed by Western blotting to detect the bound GTPases. HA-tagged Rac1, RhoA, and Cdc42 were detected with anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5. The primary antibody was detected with HRP-coupled anti-mouse IgG antibody using ECL. We have generated previously an oncogenic variant of IGFR, NM1, which is a Gag fusion receptor protein (Fig.1 A and 15, 16). In a mutational analysis of NM1, we identified two loss of function mutants of NM1, Phe-1136 and dS2, that retained kinase activity but were attenuated in their cell transforming ability as tested in primary CEF cells (Fig. 1 A and see Ref. 17Jiang Y. Chan J.L.K. Zong C.S. Wang L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 60-167Google Scholar). In order to establish a mammalian cell culture system to study the transformation potential of NM1 and its mutants, Phe-1136 and dS2, we established a stably transfected pool of cells expressing NM1, Phe-1136, and dS2 using NIH 3T3 cells. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the stable lines express readily detectable levels of the respective Gag-IGFR proteins. Consistent with our previous observation in CEF (17Jiang Y. Chan J.L.K. Zong C.S. Wang L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 60-167Google Scholar), the Gag-IGFR fusion protein is constitutively active, and the mutant Phe-1136, containing the tyrosine to phenylalanine mutation at position 1136, has comparable levels of in vitro receptor autophosphorylation and intracellular tyrosine phosphorylation levels (Fig. 1 B). The second mutant, dS2, containing a 19-aa deletion in the subtransmembrane region of NM1, spanning amino acids 938–956, has close to wild type receptor autophosphorylation activity and phosphorylation levels (Fig. 1 B). In order to assess the transforming potential of the NM1 mutants, NIH 3T3 cells expressing NM1 and its mutants, Phe-1136 and dS2, respectively, were examined for their morphological alterations and were assayed for their ability to form colonies in soft agar and foci formation in monolayer. Expression of NM1 in 3T3 cells led to increased mitogenicity (Fig. 1 C), altered cell morphology (fusiform, elongated, and more refractile cells) (Fig. 1 D), anchorage-independent growth (Fig.1 E), and loss of contact inhibition (Fig. 1 F). The mutants, Phe-1136 and dS2, showed differential loss of these properties. The mitogenic activity of the NM1 and its mutant receptors was compared by assaying the growth rate of their expressing cells in DMEM containing 0.5% calf serum. The NM1-expressing cells grew significantly faster than the control cells (Fig. 1 C). The growth rate of dS2- and Phe-1136-expressing cells was indistinguishable from that of the control cells (Fig. 1 C). Morphologically, NM1- and Phe-1136-expressing cells had similarly altered appearance. dS2-expressing cells, on the other hand, were indistinguishable from the control 3T3 cells (Fig. 1 D). As observed previously (19Li W. Jiang Y. Zhang J. Soon L. Flechner L. Kapoor V. Pierce J. Wang L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5888-5898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), NM1 was able to induce focus formation in NIH 3T3 cells. Phe-1136 retained substantial focus forming ability, 50–60% of NM1 (Fig.1 F), but was more severely compromised in its ability to induce anchorage-independent growth (Fig. 1 E). Under our conditions, NM1-transformed 3T3 cells formed more than 100 colonies, whereas Phe-1136-expressing cells formed only 30 colonies (Fig.1 E). dS2 was more severely impaired compared with NM1. dS2-expressing cells displayed almost no focus or colony forming ability (Fig. 1, E and F). To elucidate the signal transduction pathways that mediate IGFR-induced cytoskeletal rearrangements, proliferation, and transformation, we evaluated the level of activation of MAP kinase, PI3 kinase, PLCγ, and Stat3 in the NM1 and its mutant-expressing cells. The Ras/MAP kinase pathway can be activated by the IGFR through the IRS-1-Grb2-Sos and the Shc-Grb2-Sos complex formation (18Resnicoff M. Baserga R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 842"
https://openalex.org/W1968312669,"Previous studies indicate that the O-helix ofThermus aquaticus (Taq) DNA polymerase I (pol I) plays an important role in the replication fidelity of the enzyme. This study examines the role of Thr-664, which lies in the middle of the O-helix of Taq pol I. A mutant ofTaq Pol I with a proline substitution of Thr-664 (T664P) exhibits much lower replication fidelity than the wild type enzyme in a forward mutation assay. T664P produces base substitution, single-base deletion, and single-base insertion errors at 20-, 5, and 50-fold higher rates than wild type, respectively. In specific activity and steady-state kinetic experiments, T664P was catalytically robust for insertion of correct nucleotides. In contrast, it incorporated incorrect nucleotides 6.1- to 10-fold more efficiently than wild type at a template dC. Mismatched primer termini were extended by T664P 4.2- to 9.5-fold more efficiently than wild type. These data imply that the O-helix with a proline at position 664 functions like wild type Taq pol I for correct nucleotide incorporations, but bends and enlarges the catalytic pocket of the enzyme and increases the rate of nucleotide misincorporation.

Thermus aquaticus polymerase Chromosomal DNA is subject to damage from naturally occurringin vivo processes such as hydrolysis, oxidation, and methylation (1Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4342) Google Scholar). Cells have several DNA repair pathways that act as mutation avoidance systems and prevent the potentially deleterious effects of DNA damage. In addition to these systems, DNA polymerases discriminate between correct and incorrect nucleotides during DNA synthesis, thus providing accurate DNA synthesis and enhancing genomic stability (2Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 497-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). During DNA synthesis by a polymerase, both the efficiency and the fidelity catalysis depends on the same phosphoryl transfer reaction and involves functionally and physically overlapping regions of the polymerase active site. The characteristics of mutant DNA polymerases are often useful for understanding the mechanisms that determine DNA replication fidelity. Among the mutants, we are interested in mutants with reduced fidelity but normal levels of catalytic activity. These types of mutations might be advantageous to a cell under conditions when low replication fidelity is desirable (i.e. to bypass DNA lesions) and could have played a role during evolution of error-prone DNA polymerases. Nucleotide selection fidelity could be altered by mutations that modify the interaction between polymerase and substrate/template-primer DNA (2Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 497-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). For example, ribonucleotides are excluded from the DNA polymerase active site by structural/steric interference involving the 2′-OH group of the ribose sugar (3Gao G. Orlova M. Georgiadis M.M. Hendrickson W.A. Goff S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 4Astatke M. Ng K. Grindley N.D. Joyce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mutations in Glu-615 inTaq 1 pol I, and the corresponding amino acid in Klenow or HIV reverse transcriptase, remove the steric clash with the 2′-OH group. Mutations in Ile-614 also reduce steric hindrance for incoming ribonucleotides and allow ribonucleotide misincorporation. In other mutant polymerases, an increase or decrease in the rate of base substitution or frameshift mutation is observed. Taq pol I F667L is a transversion antimutator in which the stacking force against bulky purine:purine base pairs may be reduced (6Suzuki M. Yoshida S. Adman E.T. Blank A. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32728-32735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This mutant and most other polymerases with altered replication fidelity show altered catalytic efficiency; Taq pol I F667L demonstrates a 23-fold lower A→T transversion frequency and ∼30- to 100-fold lower catalytic efficiency than wild type Taq pol I. This work reports the properties of Taq pol I mutants that have substitutions at Thr-664 in the O-helix. Taq pol I T664P is a mutator polymerase whose catalytic properties are near wild type for insertion of correct nucleotides. It is proposed thatTaq pol I T664P may be a mutator because of increased plasticity in a wall of the catalytic pocket. Evidence supporting this hypothesis is discussed. Wild type and mutants in Taq pol I were purified as described previously (7Suzuki M. Avicola A.K. Hood L. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11228-11235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Activity was measured in assays containing 200 µg/ml activated calf thymus DNA, 100 µm each dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP and 0.2 µCi of [3H]dATP in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm MgCl2; incubation was for 5 min at 72 °C. Incorporation of radioactivity into an acid-insoluble product was determined according to Yoshida et al. (8Yoshida S. Kondo T. Ando T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 353: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). One unit represents incorporation of 10 nmol dNMP in 1 h, corresponding to 0.1 unit as defined by PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Foster City, CA). Oligonucleotides were synthesized and purified by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Buckinghamshire, UK). Replication error was quantitated by the M13mp2 forward mutation assay. A gapped M13mp2 substrate was constructed in which the single-stranded gap region contained thelacZα-complementation target sequence (9Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Gap-filling reactions were monitored by electrophoresis of the reaction products in 0.8% agarose gels. The reaction mixture contained 100 units of wild type or mutant Taq pol I, 400 ng of gapped M13mp2, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 7 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 200 µm each dNTP (6Suzuki M. Yoshida S. Adman E.T. Blank A. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32728-32735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). After incubation at 72 °C for 5 min, double-stranded phage DNA was transfected, the cultures were plated and incubated, and plaques were scored. Except for the experiment with T664P, mutant plaques were identified by their color. In some cases, plaques were isolated, replated and re-evaluated. DNA sequence was determined with an ABI PRISMTM Dye Primer Cycle Sequencing Core kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK). In earlier experiments, the number of background mutant plaques was as high as 3.5 × 10−3 (7Suzuki M. Avicola A.K. Hood L. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11228-11235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), making it difficult to estimate the increase or decrease in mutation frequencies for polymerases. However, the background decreased to 0.87 × 10−3 (6Suzuki M. Yoshida S. Adman E.T. Blank A. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32728-32735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), when a different preparation of gapped DNA substrate was used. In addition, the magnesium concentration was raised to 7 mm to force misincorporation (10Eckert K.A. Kunkel T.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3739-3744Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). These changes in assay conditions made it possible to easily measure the mutation frequency of wild type polymerases and provided a sufficient number of mutant plaques for analysis. Deoxynucleotide concentrations were also increased to 200 µm to ensure efficient incorporation by polymerases with high Km values. The 14-mer DNA primer (5′-CGCGCCGAATTCCC) was 32P-labeled at the 5′-end by incubating with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP and annealed to a 2-fold molar excess of the 46-mer DNA template, 5′- GCGCGGAAGCTTGGCTGCAGAATATTGCTAGCGGGAATTCGGCGCG. The labeled template-primer was mixed with unlabeled DNA in a 1:1 ratio and used at a final concentration of 50 nm in each reaction. Reaction mixtures contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 20 µm each dNTP, and 20 nm wild-type protein or 3.5 nm T664P in a final volume of 20 µl. In some experiments, either dCTP or dGTP was omitted from the mixture. Primer extension was carried out at 45 °C for 0, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 60 min. Assays measuring single nucleotide incorporation were essentially the same as described previously (11Goodman M.F. Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Petruska J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 83-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). 32P-labeled template-primer was mixed with unlabeled template-primer in a 1:10 ratio and used at a final concentration of 50 nm in each 20-µl reaction containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mmMgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and specified concentration of dNTP and enzyme as described below. To measure incorporation of dC, dA, and dTMP, 15-, 16-, and 17-mer primers were used, respectively, that are complementary to the 3′-terminus of the 46-mer template. Incorporation of dNTP was monitored for kinetic analysis under the conditions for which up to 20% of the template-primer was utilized. In reactions for correct nucleotide incorporation, concentrations of wild-type protein and substrate were 0.3 nm and 0.1–5 µm dGTP, 2 nm and 0.5–20 µmdATP, 2 nm and 0.5–20 µm dTTP, and 0.5 nm and 0.5–20 µm dCTP, respectively. In reactions with T664P, concentrations of the polymerase and substrate were 0.4 nm and 0.1–0.5 µm dGTP, 2 nm and 0.5–20 µm dATP, 1 nm and 0.5–10 µm dTTP, and 0.15 nm and 0.1–10 µm dCTP, respectively. Reactions were performed at 45 °C for 5 min. In reactions for incorrect nucleotide incorporation at template C, concentrations of wild-type protein and substrate were 120 nm and 0.2–50 µm dATP, 120 nmand 20–200 µm dTTP, and 230 nm and 100–500 µm dCTP. Reactions were performed at 45 °C for 15, 30, and 60 min for incorporation of dATP, dTTP, and dCTP, respectively. In reactions with T664P, concentrations of the polymerase and substrate were 4 nm and 0.5–10 µm dATP, 10 nm and 0.2–20 µm dTTP, and 30 nmand 10–200 µm dCTP, respectively. Reactions were performed at 45 °C for 15, 15, and 30 min for incorporation of dATP, dTTP, and dCTP, respectively. Reactions were terminated by addition of an equal volume of termination buffer (98% formamide, 10 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol), and analyzed by 14% denatured acrylamide gel containing 8 m urea. Gels were exposed for autoradiography, and the products were quantitated using a Laser Image Analyzer (BAS2000 system, Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). Reaction efficiency was calculated from the ratio of extended products per min.Km and V max for the incorporation of each dNTP were calculated from Lineweaver-Burk plots. Primer extension efficiency for matched or mismatched terminal base pairs was measured essentially as described (11Goodman M.F. Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Petruska J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 83-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 12Huang M.M. Arnheim N. Goodman M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4567-4573Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The sequences of primers were: 5′-CGCGCCGAATTCCCG (15-mer match primer); 5′-CGCGCCGAATTCCCC (C:C mismatch primer); 5′-CGCGCCGAATTCCCA (C:A mismatch primer); 5′-CGCGCCGAATTCCCT (C:T mismatch primer). 32P-labeled template-primer was mixed with unlabeled template-primer in a 1:10 ratio and used at a final concentration of 50 nm in each 20-µl reaction containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and specified concentrations of dCTP and enzyme as described below. In some experiments, 5 nm template-primer was used with other conditions being fixed. In reactions, concentrations of wild type protein and dCTP for template G, A, T, and C were 0.5 nm and 0.5–20 µm, 100 nm and 10–200 µm, 250 nm and 1–20 µm, and 450 nm and 100–1000 µm, respectively. Incubations were carried out for 5, 30, 30, and 60 min for template G, A, T, and C, respectively. In reactions with T664P, concentrations of the polymerase and dCTP were 0.15 nm and 0.1–10 µm, 5 nm and 5–200 µm, 30 nm and 0.5–20 µm, and 450 nm and 5–100 µm, respectively. Incubations were carried out at 45 °C for 5, 15, 15, and 30 min for template G, A, T, and C, respectively. The incorporation of the dCTP was monitored for kinetic analysis. The polymerase-DNA equilibrium binding constants (K D) were determined by the kinetic values using two concentrations (50 and 5 nm) of template-primer (13Creighton S. Huang M.M. Cai H. Arnheim N. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2633-2639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the crystal structure models of Thermus aquaticus(Taq ) DNA polymerase I (pol I) that are demonstrated by Liet al. (14Li Y. Korolev S. Waksman G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7514-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar), we found that substitution of Thr-664 with proline (T664P) removes at least two hydrogen bonds in the closed complex structure (Fig. 1). In wild typeTaq pol I, the hydroxyl group of Thr-664 hydrogen bonds with the O6 position of the guanine base pairing with the incoming ddCTP (Fig. 1 A), and a similar interaction occurs between the Thr-664 hydroxyl group and the oxygen or amino group for other bases. However, this interaction does not form in the open or binary complex (15Li Y. Kong Y. Korolev S. Waksman G. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1116-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thr-664 also forms a hydrogen bond between the amino group and carboxyl group one α-helical turn ahead (Fig.1 B). These hydrogen bonds do not form in the T664P mutant. To study the functions of these interactions, we measured replication fidelity and kinetic constants of wild type and Thr-664 mutant polymerases. Replication fidelity was measured as the frequency of mutations during a single round of DNA synthesisin vitro using a gapped M13mp2 DNA with the reporterlacZα gene as template for gap-filling DNA synthesis. These assays were carried out using a modification of the previously published procedure (see Ref. 7Suzuki M. Avicola A.K. Hood L. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11228-11235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar and “Experimental Procedures”). Under the modified conditions wild type Taq pol I generates more mutant plaques, thereby the mutation frequencies of high and low fidelity mutants are more easily measured and compared with the wild type enzyme (6Suzuki M. Yoshida S. Adman E.T. Blank A. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32728-32735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In experiments with wild type and Thr-664 mutants of Taq Pol I, the mutant frequency of wild type was 8.1 × 10−3; however, the frequency of 16.5 × 10−3 is used in this work, which is the average of several determinations (see Table I of Ref. 6Suzuki M. Yoshida S. Adman E.T. Blank A. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32728-32735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar in detail). The mutant frequency of T664S and T664I is similar to wild type (Table I). The mutant frequency of T664N and T664R is slightly higher than wild type, at 53.8 and 63.8 × 10−3, respectively. The mutant frequency of T664R was similar to that reported previously (7Suzuki M. Avicola A.K. Hood L. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11228-11235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), although relative value to wild type was lower because of the 6.6-fold higher mutant frequency for wild type.Table IError frequencies for wild type Taq pol I in a lacZα forward mutation assayTaqPlaques scoredMutant frequencyTotalMutants1-aMutant frequency of wild type and mutant Taq pol I enzymes (except mutant T664P) was determined by inferring plaque genotype from plaque color.

Open table in a new tab In most cases, mutant plaques are scored by counting pale blue and white plaques on plates that have a much larger number of dark blue plaques. In cases where plaque colors were not clearly identified, phages are isolated, mixed with wild type phages and plated again in a fresh plate. However, it was very difficult to score the plaques formed by Taq Pol I T664P by this method, because the number of mutant plaques was unusually high, and because the mutant plaques had a large range of coloration. It was roughly estimated that at least ∼20% of the plaques were mutant, but the phenotype of the remaining plaques was very uncertain. Thus, we considered the remaining plaques as also carrying considerable populations of mutations and determined the DNA sequence for all the plaques on the plate to determine the mutant frequency for T664P. By this method, the mutant frequency of T664P was 529 × 10−3 in the forward mutation assay (Table I). The DNA sequence was determined for DNA from 189 plaques produced during a forward mutation assay with T664P. There were 47 clones with one mutation and 53 clones with two or more mutations. Base substitution and frameshift frequencies were 4.2 × 10−3 (one error per 240 nucleotides) and 3.0 × 10−4 (one error per 3300 nucleotides), respectively. These error frequencies are 20- and 9.1-fold higher than wild type for base substitution and frameshift errors, respectively (Table II).Table IITypes of errors observed by wild type Taq pol I and T664P in a lacZα forward mutation assayError typeWT2-aData from Ref. 6.T664PFold (T664P/WT)Error frequency2-bError frequency was determined as described previously by Tindall and Kunkel (16).

The number of mutations was divided by the number of nucleotides sequenced. Open table in a new tab The types of base substitutions and frameshifts made by T664P are indicated in Table II. Base substitution frequencies were in the range of 6.7- (G→C) to 150-fold (G→A) higher than wild type. T664P produces T→C transitions (26%) and A→T (17%) transversions at a high rate, and these rates are 25- and 11-fold higher in the mutant than in wild type. In addition, T→A transversions (12%) and G→A transitions (11%) are made by T664P at a 55- and 150-fold higher rate than wild type. These data show that T664P discriminates poorly between the correct and incorrect nucleotide and thus is a base substitution mutator. Taq pol I T664P is also a frameshift mutator; frequencies of single base insertions and deletions were 50- and 5.2-fold higher than wild type, respectively (Table II). The mutational spectrum of wild type and T664P was compared for the mutational target region used in the forward mutation assay. The base substitutions made by T664P map relatively evenly and randomly throughout the sequenced region; in contrast, the base substitutions made by wild type Taq pol I are in discrete hot spots (Fig.2). Thus, base substitutions occurred in the mutational spectrum with little or no apparent sequence context effect and are randomly distributed throughout the target region. This character is quantitatively demonstrated by counting number of base appearance at one base upstream the substitution sites. For twenty-two G→A transitions, 3A, 7C, 6G, and 6T were found at the N of 5′-NG, respectively. For twenty-four T→A substitutions, 6A, 4C, 6G, and 8T were found at 5′-NT, respectively (TableII). Sequence context also influences mutation frequency differently for wild type and mutant forms of Taq pol I. For example, ∼26% of base substitutions made by T664P are T→C transitions. In the wild type mutational spectrum, nine of 14 T→C transitions occur at the sequence 5′-CT. However, in the mutational spectrum of T664P, T→C transitions are more frequent with A, G, or T at the 5′- NT (i.e. A:C:G:T = 12:4:16:18). Experiments were also performed with wild type and T664P using a primer extension assay in the absence of dCTP or dGTP. The template-primer, appropriate nucleotides, and wild type or mutant enzyme were incubated for up to 60 min. As shown in Fig.3 A, wild type Taqpol I rapidly incorporates the first nucleotide, dGMP, at template C, but does not efficiently incorporate the next nucleotide because correct dCTP is lacking. Hence, large amounts of the 15-mer reaction product accumulate. However, by misincorporation, product at the 16-mer position gradually increases with incubation time. Evidently, the 16-mer product is not efficiently extended, presumably due to the mismatched nucleotide opposite template G at the primer terminus. Base discrimination at both the incorporation and extension steps also occurs in the absence of dGTP (Fig. 3 B, lanes 2–6). Most of the primer remains as a 14-mer, much less is extended to a 15-mer, and further extension is inefficient, presumably because of the mismatched nucleotide opposite template C at the primer terminus. At the time point of 60 min, wild type Taq pol I extends 7.0% of primers past the first template dG, and 8.7% of primers past the first template dC, when dCTP or dGTP is omitted from the reaction, respectively. In contrast, Taq pol I T664P extends 64% of the primer past the first template dG in the reaction omitting dCTP, and 68% of the primer past the first template dC in the reaction omitting dGTP. In addition to this high misinsertion and extension rate, many reaction products elongate past 4 target residues (lane 12). Under the minus dCTP condition, where the first dGTP was normally incorporated by polymerase, a comparable proportion of primers is extended by Taq pol I T664P at all time points. These data indicate that T664P has a greater capacity than wild type to elongate in the minus dCTP condition because of its increased ability to utilize non-complementary bases and mispaired primer termini, rather than because of a difference in the amount of activity present in the reaction with mutant or wild type enzyme. Under steady-state conditions, reaction products were further quantitated, and the kinetic constants were determined (Table IIIa). Despite the structural changes in T664P (Fig. 1), its catalytic properties were similar to wild type. The insertion efficiency (V max/Km) for dTTP by Taq pol I T664P (0.12) was very similar to wild type (0.2), and was several-fold better than wild type for dGTP, dATP, and dCTP (Table IIIa). The K D values for C:G matched and mismatched primer termini were also very similar for wild type and T664P mutant Taq pol I. This is consistent with the observations that the specific activity of T664P was 29% of the wild type value (19,000 versus 66,000 units/mg protein), and that T664P complemented the growth defect of Escherichia colistrain recA718 polA12 (16Suzuki M.

Wild type and T664P mutant Taq pol I polymerase have comparable Km values for misincorporation of dAMP, dTMP, and dCMP.

As a result, misincorporation efficiencies by T664P were 6.1 (dAMP) and 10 (dTMP and dCMP) -fold higher than wild type. In the primer extension reaction using primers that have mismatched nucleotides at the 3′-termini, wild type and T664P also have similarKm values for dGMP incorporation with a C:G (template:primer) and a C:A terminus, but T664P has a 6.9- and 3.7-fold lower Km value for C:T and C:C, respectively (Table IIIb).

Taq pol I produces frequent T→C transitions and deletions at runs of single nucleotides (17Tindall K.R. Kunkel T.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6008-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). When performed at a high enzyme concentration, Taq pol I is more error-prone; the enzyme extends A:A and G:A mismatched primer termini, and the frequency of A→T transversions and G→T transversions increases. In addition, −1 frameshifts occur at pyrimidine:purine dinucleotides involving loss of the downstream purine (6Suzuki M. Yoshida S. Adman E.T. Blank A. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32728-32735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This study reports a forward mutation analysis of T664P, an O-helix mutant of Taq pol I that demonstrates significant reduction in replication fidelity. This mutant synthesizes DNA with an increased frequency of all base substitution and frameshift errors (i.e. 150-fold increase in G→A transitions). These data indicate that Taq pol I T664P is impaired in its ability to discriminate between correct and incorrect incoming nucleotides during gap-filling DNA synthesis in vitro. Taq pol I T664P displays reduced replication fidelity (TableII) and an altered mutational spectrum (Fig. 2), but its kinetic properties (V max and Km) for correct deoxynucleotide incorporation, as well asK D values for matched and mismatched primer termini, are essentially the same as or better than wild type Taq pol I (Table II). This observation is consistent with the non-essential function of Thr-664 for catalytic efficiency of the enzyme; the amino acid corresponding to Thr-664 is not conserved among the pol I class of DNA polymerases. These data suggest that the catalytic pocket structure of T664P assumes a conformation nearly identical to wild type when encountering a correct nucleotide during DNA synthesis. Two processes contribute to the ability of a polymerase to discriminate correct from incorrect nucleotides during DNA synthesis; discrimination occurs at the insertion step (selection of incoming nucleotide during catalysis) and at the extension step (discrimination between matched and mismatched primer termini). Single nucleotide incorporation kinetics for T664P indicate that misinsertion efficiency for incorrect incorporation of dATP, dTTP, and dCTP are 6-, 10-, and 10-fold higher than wild type, respectively (Table IIIa). Furthermore, mismatch extension efficiency for C:A, C:T, and C:C mispairs are 4.2-, 8.7-, and 9.5-fold higher than wild type, respectively (Table IIIb). These data show that T664P is impaired in discrimination at the insertion and the extension step. It is possible that kinetic values would differ if determined using a different template than the one arbitrarily chosen for the experiment presented here. However, this possibility is less likely for T664P because the data set is internally consistent for the forward mutation assay and the kinetic studies; 15-, >47-, and >14-fold increase is observed in the forward mutation assay in C→T, C→A and C→G base substitution rates, respectively (Table II). To understand the mechanism underlying the altered replication fidelity of T664P, other mutant polymerases that have amino acid substitutions at Thr-664 were also purified and characterized. If the interaction between Thr-664 and the template base plays a major role in determining replication fidelity (Fig. 1 A), it is likely that the effects of substitution of Thr-664 would depend on the side chain length and polarity of the substituting amino acid. Substitution with the polar amino acid serine does not significantly reduce replication fidelity of Taq pol I in the forward mutation assay; substitution of Thr-664 with the longer side chain polar amino acid asparagine increases the mutation frequency a modest 3-fold; substitution of Thr-664 with isoleucine (a non-polar side chain) caused no change in the wild type mutant frequency (Table II). These data indicate that the Thr664 may influence base selection by Taqpol I, but it seems to play a relatively inessential and dispensable role. Proline is a unique amino acid because its side chain is covalently bound to the backbone nitrogen atom forming a ring structure. Proline is underrepresented in protein α-helices, but a substantial number of prolines are found in the helical regions of proteins (18Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Science. 1988; 240: 1648-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). When proline substitutes for Thr-664 in the O-helix of Taq pol I, one of the nine intrahelical hydrogen bonds in the wild type structure fails to form (Fig. 1 B); this may result in a steric hindrance within the α-helix conformation and may produce a kink (18Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Science. 1988; 240: 1648-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar, 19Kim M.K. Kang Y.K. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1492-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 20Branden C. Tooze J. Introduction to Protein Structure. 2nd Ed. Garland Publishing Inc., New York1998: 16-17Google Scholar). Our data indicate that substitution of proline in the O-helix at position 664 does not alter catalytic activity for insertion of correct nucleotides by Taq pol I (Table IIIa), despite the hypothetical structural hindrance observed in model structures (19Kim M.K. Kang Y.K. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1492-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). One interpretation of this result is that the helix may be sufficiently stable with eight hydrogen bonds in the O-helix backbone for incorporation of the correct nucleotide, instead of the nine hydrogen bonds that form in the wild type enzyme. The results presented here indicate that T664P is catalytically altered during incorporation of incorrect nucleotides or when extending mismatched primer termini (Tables IIIa and IIIb). These data suggest that the O-helix bends and enlarges the catalytic pocket at the position of the hydrogen bond that does not form because of the T664P substitution (Fig. 1). In wild type Taq pol I, improper base pairs may dislocate the C-terminal residues Phe-667 and Tyr-671 that form a “wall” in the hydrophobic catalytic pocket (14Li Y. Korolev S. Waksman G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7514-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). This stress is transferred to the N-terminal amino acids Arg-659 and Lys-663 that interact with the substrate phosphates, unless the O-helix assumes a bent structure. Thus proline is substituted near the middle of the O-helix, it may promote a transition between the near-intact (correct base pair) and bent structure (incorrect base pair) that acts as an elastic hinge. The low replication fidelity mutant A661E of Taq pol I has also recently been characterized (6Suzuki M. Yoshida S. Adman E.T. Blank A. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32728-32735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The results of that study suggest that an interaction between the O-helix and the primer might stabilize the closed form of Taq pol I, allowing more time for chemistry and increasing the probability of phosphoryl transfer involving incorrectly paired dNTPs. It is also possible that amino acid substitution in the O-helix might create slightly more space in the catalytic pocket to accommodate incorrect base pairs. However, the mechanisms causing low replication fidelity may differ betweenTaq pol I T664P and A661E. The amino acid 664 is not conserved in 9 Pol I class DNA polymerases and 47 Pol α class DNA polymerases (21Braithwaite D.K. Ito J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 787-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, proline is not found at any of the corresponding residues or in regions that correspond to the O-helix in this group of related proteins. Our data also suggest that proline substitution, if it ever happened during evolution of the replicative DNA polymerases, might have been excluded to ensure a sufficient level of replication fidelity. We thank Yasutomo Ito in our laboratory for preparation of figures, and Ann Blank and Ellie Adman at the University of Washington for valuable suggestions. We are especially grateful to Akihiko Kikuchi at our university who constructed a model helix using conventional atom pieces to understand the effects of proline substitution in the enzyme."

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), besides being an endothelial-cell mitogen, is a strong vascular permeability factor. This study demonstrates that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) from healthy volunteers cultured in serum-free medium in the absence of any stimulus release VEGF continuously into culture media. Physiological endotoxin concentrations stimulate this VEGF secretion in a dose-dependent manner, representing an induction of de novo VEGF production, as an induction of the expression of the major 3.7-kb VEGF mRNA transcripts was observed, and the release of VEGF was blocked by cycloheximide. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction also verified the expression of the four VEGF transcripts. Interferon-α, a modulator of the immune system and an inhibitor of angiogenesis, inhibited VEGF release dose dependently. We conclude that endotoxin promotes VEGF production in PBMNCs. Circulating and emigrating VEGF-producing PBMNCs may enhance the shift to angiogenic phenotype in a variety of infectious and inflammatory disorders as well as in cancer. VEGF-producing PBMNCs may be a novel mechanism of tissue edema in systemic inflammation. Inhibition of VEGF production in PBMNCs may be one of the mechanisms of interferon-α action."

Recently, VHR has been identified as a tyrosine-specific extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphatase (16Todd J.L. Tanner K.G. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13271-13280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Like other PTPs the active-site Cys-124 is stabilized by an extensive network of hydrogen bonding between backbone NH of the P-loop and the thiolate anion (4Stuckey J.A. Schubert H.L. Fauman E.B.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18780-18788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The sulfhydryl group of Cys-124 has an unusually low pK a value and functions as a nucleophile to form a thiophosphate-enzyme intermediate (19Zhou G. Denu J.M. Wu Li. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28084-28090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Asp-92 serves as a general acid catalyst for formation of the phosphoenzyme intermediate (20Denu J.M. Zhou G. Guo Y. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3396-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and in the hydrolysis of thiophosphate intermediate the same Asp-92 acts as a general base, and the hydroxyl group of Ser-131 is transiently linked to the thiol (14Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5910-5914Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) (Scheme FS1). The phosphoenzyme intermediate of VHR has been verified by31P NMR (21Denu J.M. Lohse D.L. Vijayalakshmi J. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2493-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), and the structure of the transition state forming the intermediate has been suggested to be a highly dissociative metaphosphate-like transition state (22Hengge A.C. Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7084-7092Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Additionally, by using a variety of nonpeptide substrates, the decomposition of phosphoenzyme intermediate has been shown to be the rate-limiting step for the VHR-catalyzed reaction (15Zhang Z.Y. Wu L. Chen L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16088-16096Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of VHR further explains some catalytic properties of VHR (7Yuvaniyama J. Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Saper M.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1328-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The shallow active-site pocket in VHR is likely to be related to the broad substrate specificity of VHR, which is known to be favorable toward sterically demanding nonpeptidic substrates (23Chen L. Montserat J. Lawrence D.S. Zhang Z.Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9349-9354Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The absence of a water molecule in the cavity of VHR coincides with a nucleophilic reactivity of alcohols observed in VHR (24Zhao Y. Wu L. Noh S.J. Guan K.L. Zhang Z.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5484-5492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The Glu-450 of Yersinia PTP ligates a water molecule and effectively prevents nucleophilic attack of alcohol from outside the cavity. The VHR structure also reveals that the position of conserved Asp-92 is different from the flexible WPD-loop found in Yersinia PTP or PTP1B (3Pannifer A.D.B. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Barford D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10454-10462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). However, there are some structural features of VHR that have not been adequately recognized (7Yuvaniyama J. Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Saper M.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1328-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). One is that imidazole N-δ of His-123 forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of Cys-124. This imidazole ring of VHR is further connected to a water molecule held between Tyr-78 and Thr-73 by hydrogen bonds (see Fig. 1). The water molecule ligated at this position seems to be unique to VHR. His-123 of VHR is known to be conserved in most PTPs as HC(X)5R(S/T) except low molecular weight PTPs where His is replaced by Val (17Evans B. Tishmack P.A. Pokalsky C. Zhang M. Van Etten R.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13609-13617Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, studies on the function of the conserved His are surprisingly sparse. One early report on the role of His-402 of Yersinia PTP shows that the His residue is critical for stability of the active-site Cys-403 (25Zhang Z.Y. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9340-9345Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). When His-402 was substituted with Asn or Ala, the pK a of the active-site Cys-403 increased dramatically. The authors, not knowing the structure of Yersinia PTP at that time, proposed a direct interaction between the imidazole ring of His-402 and thiol of Cys-403. This proposal is not compatible with the His position in the P-loop of Yersinia PTP determined by x-ray crystallography (4Stuckey J.A. Schubert H.L. Fauman E.B. Zhang Z.Y. Dixon J.E. Saper M.A. Nature. 1994; 370: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Now all conserved His residues in VHR, PTP1B, and Cdc25A appear to interact with the carbonyl group of the active-site cysteine residue by a hydrogen bond. In this study, to verify the structural role of the conserved His, we first carried out site-directed mutagenesis on His-123 of VHR, and we examined its effect on pK a of the active-site Cys-124. Then we examined the possible role of the hydrogen bonding array involving the conserved His-123, Tyr-78, and Thr-73 in orienting Cys-124 at the P-loop for optimal catalytic activity by mutating Tyr-78 and Thr-73. Extensive kinetic analysis was carried out with mutants of Y78F and T73A to demonstrate that the hydrogen bonding array of His-123 is crucial for maintaining the proper positioning of Cys-124 in the catalytic site. The substrate materialspara-nitrophenyl phosphate, phosphotyrosine, phosphothreonine, and phenophthalein monophosphate were purchased from Sigma. The sequencing grade endoprotease Lys-C and microcentrifuge filter with molecular cut-off of 10,000 were also obtained from Sigma. Malachite green oxalate was purchased from Junsei (Tokyo, Japan), and ammonium molybdate was from Shinyo (Osaka, Japan). pET-21a vector for bacterial expression was obtained from Novagen (Madison, WI), and isopropyl-thio-β-d-galactoside was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Hitrap Heparin and Superose 12 HPLC column was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. [3H]Iodoacetic acid was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Substitutions of residues of Thr-73, Tyr-78, Asp-92, and His-123 of VHR were carried out by the site-directed mutagenesis procedure of Cormack et al.(26Cormack, B. (1995) in Short Protocols in Molecular Biology(Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K., eds) 3rd Ed, Unit 8.5, Wiley Interscience, New York.Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide primers used were as follows: T73A, ATGCACGTCAACGCCAATGCCAAC; Y78F, ACCAATGCCAACTTCTTCAAGGACTCCGGC; D92N, ATCAAGGCCAACAACACACAGGAGTTC; H123A, CGGGTGCTCGTCGCCTGCCGGGAAGGT; H123N, CGGGTGCTCGTCAACTGCCGGGAAGGT; H123F, GTGCTCGTCTTCTGCCGGGAAGGT. All of the mutants were verified by DNA sequencing. The wild-type and mutant VHRs were cloned in pET-21a vector and transformed to Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) for protein expression. The overexpression and purification of VHR were performed according to Zhou et al. (19Zhou G. Denu J.M. Wu Li. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28084-28090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. The pre-chromatographic steps were the same as reported previously (19Zhou G. Denu J.M. Wu Li. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28084-28090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that Hitrap Heparin and Superose 12 HPLC chromatography were used instead of S-Sepharose and Sephadex G-75. Briefly, the 0.5% polyethyleneimine and 35–65% ammonium sulfate precipitate were dialyzed against 20 mm MES, pH 6.0, containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The resulting solution was filtered through a 0.22-µm pore filter and injected into a Hitrap Heparin HPLC column. After the column was washed extensively with 20 mmMES, pH 6.0, VHR was eluted at 0.15 m NaCl in a linear NaCl gradient. The active fractions collected were concentrated with a microcentrifuge filter and loaded onto a Superose 12 HPLC column that was preequilibrated with 20 mm MES, pH 6.0, containing 0.1m NaCl. VHR was eluted at a retention time corresponding to 20 kDa. Mutant VHRs were purified by the same method, and the purity of isolated wild-type and mutant VHRs was checked on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. VHR assay was performed at 30 °C as described by Denu and Dixon (14Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5910-5914Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The buffer system containing 0.1m acetate, 0.05 m Tris, and 0.05 mBis-Tris at a constant ionic strength of 0.1 m was used throughout the entire pH range. Nonpeptide phosphate esters, pNPP, pTyr, pThr, and PMP, were used as substrates. When pNPP was used, the phosphatase activity was measured by absorbance at 405 nm after quenching with 0.5 m NaOH. In the case of pTyr, pThr, and PMP, the inorganic phosphate released was measured by colorimetry at 660 nm using malachite green solution (27Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1818) Google Scholar). For obtaining Michaelis-Menten parameters, k cat andk cat /K m, initial velocities were measured at eight different substrate concentrations between 0.1 and 5 K m. The initial velocities were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the nonlinear data analysis program (Axum, Mathsoft, Inc.). The enzyme concentration was determined from absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 11500m−1 cm−1(28Denu J.M. Zhou G. Wu L. Zhao R. Yuvaniyama J. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3796-3803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). For determination of pK a of wild-type and mutant VHRs, a direct3H-carboxymethylation method was used (20Denu J.M. Zhou G. Guo Y. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3396-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 25Zhang Z.Y. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9340-9345Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). A portion of 2 µg of enzyme in each pH value was incubated with 5 µCi of [3H]iodoacetic acid (344.2 mCi/mmol) for 100 min at 30 °C. The labeled protein was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid on ice and washed three times with ice-chilled trichloroacetic acid, and the radioactivity bound on protein was counted. The counts were plotted as a function of pH and fitted tok inact = k inactlim/(1 +H/K a). Here H and K aare the proton concentration and the acid dissociation constants of the Cys-124, respectively. In order to verify this method, peptide mapping was performed with T73A mutant as a representative. After carboxymethylation by [3H]iodoacetic acid with 15 µg of T73A at each pH, the labeled protein was divided into two portions as follows: one for measuring the total amount of bound radioactivity, and the other for digestion with 0.2 µg of Lys-C endoprotease. The reversed phase chromatography of digested protein was done with Vydac C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm, 300-Å pore size, 5-µm particle size) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Solvent A was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water, and solvent B was 80% acetonitrile in solvent A. The percentage of solvent B increased from 0 to 70% during the 40-min linear gradient. The radioactivity of each fraction was counted, and the composition of amino acid was determined. The Cys-124 was found on the major radioactive peak (fragment of NGRVLVHCREGYSRSPT) eluted at 24 min. The radioactivity counts from total protein and the counts from peptide fraction containing Cys-124 were simultaneously plotted as a function of pH and fitted to the above equation. To confirm the pK a values for Y78F the method of pseudo-first order inactivation rate constant was also used (20Denu J.M. Zhou G. Guo Y. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3396-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar,25Zhang Z.Y. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9340-9345Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Pre-steady-state kinetic measurements of the hydrolysis of pNPP catalyzed by wild-type and mutant VHRs were performed at 30 °C using a stopped-flow spectrophotometer (DX-17MV) from Applied Photophysics (Leatherhead, UK). The enzyme concentrations of wild-type and Y78F were 25 µm each, and the concentration of pNPP was 20 mm in 0.1 m Tris, 0.05 m Bis-Tris, and 0.05 m acetate buffer system. After rapid mixing of pNPP and the enzyme, the increase in absorbance was monitored at 405 nm for 1, 5, and 10 s five times for each enzyme. The average of traces was fitted to the equation [p-nitrophenolate] =A e −bt + Bt + C (15). WhereA is the amplitude of the burst; B is the slope of the linear portion of the curve; C is the intercept of the line; b is the first order rate of burst, andt is time. The rate constants for formation (k 2) and breakdown (k 3) of phosphoenzyme intermediate were estimated from the equations ofb = k 2 +k 3 and B =k 2 k 3/(k 2+ k 3) (29Bender M.L. Kezdy F.J. Wedler F.C. J. Chem. Educ. 1967; 44: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). To evaluate the hydrogen bonding array present in His-123 of VHR (Fig. 1), His-123 and residues linked to His-123 via a water molecule, namely Tyr-78 and Thr-73, were altered by site-directed mutagenesis. The His residue was changed to (a) alanine, in which case the imidazole ring was completely eliminated, to (b) phenylalanine, which has an aromatic ring but lacks hydrogen bonding capacity, and to (c) asparagine, which has the capability to form hydrogen bond without the imidazole ring. The Tyr-78 residue was changed to (d) phenylalanine to eliminate the hydrogen bonding capacity and the Thr-73 residue was replaced by (e) alanine, which lacks the hydroxyl group. We also simultaneously mutated Tyr-78 and Thr-73 to (f) phenylalanine and alanine, respectively. The six mutants prepared apparently had identical electrophoretic behavior to those of the wild-type VHR. To assess the structural integrity of the mutants, CD spectra of wild-type, Y78F, and T73A proteins were measured. The CD spectra over 190–240 nm showed no significant differences among the wild-type and mutant VHRs (data not shown). Since the reactivity of thiol of active-site cysteine is due to its low pK a, the pK a values of mutant VHRs offer crucial information for assessing the catalytic capability of the mutants. Therefore, we examined thep K a values of wild-type and mutant VHRs using radioactive iodoacetate (Table I). The carboxymethylation of cysteine by iodoacetate has been successfully tested in Yersinia PTP (25Zhang Z.Y. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9340-9345Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) and VHR (19Zhou G. Denu J.M. Wu Li. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28084-28090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pK a values were estimated from the radioactivity bound to proteins at different pH values (Fig.2). The pK a of 5.52 (5.44–5.62) estimated for wild-type VHR agrees well with the reported value of 5.6 ± 0.1 (20Denu J.M. Zhou G. Guo Y. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3396-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The pK a values of His-123 mutants, H123A and H123F, were 6.88 (6.75–7.07) and 6.93 (6.82–7.08), respectively. These values are at least 1.3 pH units higher than that of the wild-type VHR. The shift of pK a value of the active-site cysteine by eliminating the hydrogen bonding capacity of His-123 could be compared with the pK a shift reported on His-402 mutants ofYersinia PTP (25Zhang Z.Y. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9340-9345Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). However, the H123N mutant, which still forms hydrogen bonding with neighboring residues, showed a similar pK a value of 5.47 (5.37–5.58) compared with that of the wild-type enzyme. The second series of mutants, Y78F and T73A, were designed to investigate the role of amino acids around His-123. The pK a values of the active-site cysteine in mutants, Y78F and T73A, were found to be 6.51 (6.38–6.69) and 6.75 (6.68–6.90), respectively. These results are intriguing, because these mutants disturb only the hydrogen bond connected to the N-ε side of imidazole ring of His-123 via a water molecule, and it is not apparent how the distant hydrogen bonds would affect the active-site cysteine (Fig. 1). To confirm further the pK a value obtained, we carried out peptide mapping for 3H-carboxymethylated cysteine of T73A mutant (Fig. 2 B) and measured pseudo-first order inactivation rate constant by iodoacetate for Y78F mutant (Fig.2 C). The pK a values determined by the peptide mapping or the inactivation kinetics are in good agreement with the corresponding values estimated by direct counting method of total protein. When the effect of double mutation of T73A/Y78F on the pK a of cysteine was examined, the highest pK a of 7.04 (6.94–7.15) was observed.Table IpKa values of Cys-124 in wild-type and mutant VHRsEnzymepK aWild type5.52 (5.44–5.62)H123A6.88 (6.75–7.07)H123F6.93 (6.82–7.08)H123N5.47 (5.37–5.58)Y78F6.51 (6.38–6.69) 6.67 (6.57–6.81)1-apK a value was estimated from pseudo-first order inactivation rate constant.T73A6.75 (6.63–6.90) 6.76 (6.64–6.93)1-bpK a value was determined by measuring the radioactivity of3H-carboxymethylated Cys-124 separated by peptide mapping.T73A/Y78F7.04 (6.94–7.15)pK a values were determined by3H-carboxymethylation method. Calculation of pK a values was done by fitting nonlinear regression to k inact =k inactlim/(1 +H/K a). Here H and K aare the proton concentration and the acid dissociation constant of Cys-124, respectively. Error ranges were calculated by nonlinear fitting of the data to the above equation and expressed as −log (K a ± S.E.). Two or three duplicated sets of experiments were conducted.1-a pK a value was estimated from pseudo-first order inactivation rate constant.1-b pK a value was determined by measuring the radioactivity of3H-carboxymethylated Cys-124 separated by peptide mapping. Open table in a new tab pK a values were determined by3H-carboxymethylation method. Calculation of pK a values was done by fitting nonlinear regression to k inact =k inactlim/(1 +H/K a). Here H and K aare the proton concentration and the acid dissociation constant of Cys-124, respectively. Error ranges were calculated by nonlinear fitting of the data to the above equation and expressed as −log (K a ± S.E.). Two or three duplicated sets of experiments were conducted. The steady-state kinetic parameters of wild-type and mutant VHRs were obtained using pTyr as a substrate (TableII). The k cat andK m values of wild-type VHR were determined to be 3.08 ± 0.34 s−1 and 3.69 ± 0.42 mm, respectively. These values are reasonably close to those previously reported (15Zhang Z.Y. Wu L. Chen L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16088-16096Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) under similar conditions (5.87 ± 0.37 s−1 for k cat and 2.20 ± 0.38 mm for K m). The His-123 mutants, particularly H123A and H123F, exhibitedk cat values that were ∼10 and 4% that of the wild-type VHR. This is to be expected since these mutants having increased pK a of the cysteine means reduced reactivity of the active-site cysteine. However, thek cat of H123N, which did not significantly alter the pK a of the cysteine, was only minimally affected, indicating that asparagine still could manage to form a hydrogen bonding network. In the same token, mutations of Y78F and T73A, having increased pK a of the cysteine, showed substantial reductions on their kinetic parameters with ∼4- and 14-fold decreases in k cat and ∼11-fold and 36-fold decreases in k cat /K m, respectively. For the double mutant T73A/Y78F, similar reduction ink cat was observed. However, a more dramatic reduction of 480-fold ink cat /K m was observed due to the unusually high value of K m. To substantiate further our kinetic analysis, we also carried out kinetic study of D92N mutant, which has been studied extensively by Denu et al.(20Denu J.M. Zhou G. Guo Y. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3396-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The kinetic parameters of D92N obtained with pTyr were comparable to the reported values.Table IIKinetic parameters of wild-type and mutant VHRs using phosphotyrosine as a substrate at 30 °CEnzymek catk cat/K mK ms−1m−1s−1mmWild type3.08 ± 0.34835 ± 263.69 ± 0.42H123A0.30 ± 0.0327.8 ± 2.610.7 ± 1.39H123F0.11 ± 0.0142.9 ± 0.232.50 ± 0.21H123N0.84 ± 0.014714 ± 231.17 ± 0.043Y78F0.72 ± 0.0779.1 ± 8.09.10 ± 1.25T73A0.22 ± 0.0123.2 ± 2.49.36 ± 1.04T73A/Y78F0.39 ± 0.111.75 ± 0.02226 ± 65.9D92N0.026 ± 0.00615.6 ± 0.151.67 ± 0.039The phosphatase activity of each mutant was measured at its optimum pH in 0.1 m Tris, 0.05 m Bis-Tris, 0.05m acetate buffer system (21Denu J.M.

Wild type, H123F, H123N, Y78F, T73A, and D92N were assayed at pH 6.0, H123A at pH 5.0, and T73A/Y78F at pH 6.5. Errors were calculated by nonlinear least square fitting of the kinetic data to Michaelis-Menten equation and expressed as ± S.D. Observation of the marked alterations in kinetic parameters obtained with Y78F and T73A mutants led us to investigate the pH dependence of the kinetic parameters using pTyr as a substrate (Fig. 3). Determination of kinetic parameters, k cat andk cat /K m, as a function of pH could establish the residues that function as acid or base catalysts (30Walsh C. Enzymatic Reaction Mechanisms. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1979: 41-43Google Scholar). The k cat /K m parameter is the apparent second order rate constant for the reaction of substrate and free enzyme. Therefore, in the pH-k cat /K m profile, ionization residues that are important for binding of substrate and/or catalysis through the first irreversible step would be displayed, and the pH-k cat profile would display the ionization state of residues involved in the rate-limiting step in the overall reaction. The pH-k cat /K mprofiles for wild-type, Y78F, and T73A displaying bell shapes, with an ascending slope of approximately +2 and a descending slope of approximately −1, were observed (Fig. 3 A). These are mostly consistent with the known participations of one unprotonated residue together with the dianion of phosphate monoester for the ascending curve and a protonated residue for the descending curve during the VHR-catalyzed formation of phosphoenzyme intermediate (20Denu J.M. Zhou G. Guo Y. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3396-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, there was a small but significant shift in optimal pH of the mutants toward alkali compared with that of the wild type. Whenk cat was plotted against pH, the mutants showed a more drastic difference from that of the wild-type enzyme (Fig.3 B). The descending part (alkaline wing) of the normal bell shape disappeared in the mutants. Since the alkaline wing reflects the participation of protonated residue in the rate-limiting step, thesek cat alterations of mutants are likely due to shift of the ionization state of protonated residue(s) involved in the"

Immunocytochemical analyses and subcellular fractionation indicated that in untreated normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF), endogenous TIP-B1 is located in the cytosol and at the plasma membrane. During pretreatment of NHDF with protection-inducing concentrations of TNF, transient changes in cytosolic and membrane TIP-B1 levels occur. These changes occur before and coincident with the onset of TNF-protective activity, which is then sustained as TIP-B1 levels return toward baseline. During pretreatment, TIP-B1 mRNA levels increased only marginally (1.6-fold) and with kinetics different from that of the protein. The results suggest that changes in TIP-B1 levels at specific sites may trigger the production or activation of secondary protective factors and that these changes in TIP-B1 levels may not be transcriptionally regulated."
