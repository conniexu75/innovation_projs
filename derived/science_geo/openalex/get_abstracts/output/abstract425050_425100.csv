https://openalex.org/W2055966372,"Domestication and plant breeding are ongoing 10,000-year-old evolutionary experiments that have radically altered wild species to meet human needs. Maize has undergone a particularly striking transformation. Researchers have sought for decades to identify the genes underlying maize evolution, but these efforts have been limited in scope. Here, we report a comprehensive assessment of the evolution of modern maize based on the genome-wide resequencing of 75 wild, landrace and improved maize lines. We find evidence of recovery of diversity after domestication, likely introgression from wild relatives, and evidence for stronger selection during domestication than improvement. We identify a number of genes with stronger signals of selection than those previously shown to underlie major morphological changes. Finally, through transcriptome-wide analysis of gene expression, we find evidence both consistent with removal of cis-acting variation during maize domestication and improvement and suggestive of modern breeding having increased dominance in expression while targeting highly expressed genes."

Here the authors report that these assessments were reflected in pupil diameter changes, suggesting that pupil-linked arousal systems can help regulate the influence of incoming data on existing beliefs. The ability to make inferences about the current state of a dynamic process requires ongoing assessments of the stability and reliability of data generated by that process. We found that these assessments, as defined by a normative model, were reflected in nonluminance-mediated changes in pupil diameter of human subjects performing a predictive-inference task. Brief changes in pupil diameter reflected assessed instabilities in a process that generated noisy data. Baseline pupil diameter reflected the reliability with which recent data indicate the current state of the data-generating process and individual differences in expectations about the rate of instabilities. Together these pupil metrics predicted the influence of new data on subsequent inferences. Moreover, a task- and luminance-independent manipulation of pupil diameter predictably altered the influence of new data. Thus, pupil-linked arousal systems can help to regulate the influence of incoming data on existing beliefs in a dynamic environment."

https://openalex.org/W2085192554,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a prototypical autoimmune arthritis affecting nearly 1% of the world population and is a significant cause of worldwide disability. Though prior studies have demonstrated the appearance of RA-related autoantibodies years before the onset of clinical RA, the pattern of immunologic events preceding the development of RA remains unclear. To characterize the evolution of the autoantibody response in the preclinical phase of RA, we used a novel multiplex autoantigen array to evaluate development of the anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) and to determine if epitope spread correlates with rise in serum cytokines and imminent onset of clinical RA. To do so, we utilized a cohort of 81 patients with clinical RA for whom stored serum was available from 1–12 years prior to disease onset. We evaluated the accumulation of ACPA subtypes over time and correlated this accumulation with elevations in serum cytokines. We then used logistic regression to identify a profile of biomarkers which predicts the imminent onset of clinical RA (defined as within 2 years of testing). We observed a time-dependent expansion of ACPA specificity with the number of ACPA subtypes. At the earliest timepoints, we found autoantibodies targeting several innate immune ligands including citrullinated histones, fibrinogen, and biglycan, thus providing insights into the earliest autoantigen targets and potential mechanisms underlying the onset and development of autoimmunity in RA. Additionally, expansion of the ACPA response strongly predicted elevations in many inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-6, IL-12p70, and IFN-γ. Thus, we observe that the preclinical phase of RA is characterized by an accumulation of multiple autoantibody specificities reflecting the process of epitope spread. Epitope expansion is closely correlated with the appearance of preclinical inflammation, and we identify a biomarker profile including autoantibodies and cytokines which predicts the imminent onset of clinical arthritis."

RA acts through binding to three members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, RARα RARβ, and RARγ, that function as ligand-dependent transcriptional regulators. RARs form heterodimers with retinoid receptors (RXRs α, β, and γ) and bind to RA response elements (RAREs) located in the regulatory regions of target genes (4.Germain P. Chambon P. Eichele G.

We previously used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with array hybridization (ChIP-chip) to identify RAR occupied sites in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells showing that RAR occupancy of target loci is cell type-specific (9.Delacroix L. Moutier E. Altobelli G. Legras S. Poch O. Choukrallah M.A. Bertin I. Jost B. Davidson I.

Biol. 2010; 30: 231-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Analysis of these RAR-occupied sites revealed that a majority did not comprise canonical DR1, -2, or -5 elements. This paucity can in part be accounted for by the fact that RAR-RXR binds DR1, DR2, or DR5 elements with non-canonical half-sequences. An additional possibility that we did not address was the existence of DRs with non-canonical spacings. Evidence for the use of alternate spacing has previously been described (10.Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry, and Medicine. Raven Press, New York1994: 319-349Google Scholar), but their prevalence at RAR-occupied loci has not been described. We have analyzed ChIP-seq data sets from RAR occupancy in embryonic stem cells grown as embryoid body precursors to neuronal differentiation and from F9 embryonal carcinoma cells. We identify DR0 as the most abundant RAR binding element, and we identify a novel composite DR8 as a common but previously unrecognized RARE. Our results reveal an unexpected diversity in the spacing and topology of the DNA binding elements that is unique for the RAR-RXR heterodimer. ChIP and ChIP-seq experiments were performed on chromatin from murine embryonic stem cells grown as embryoid bodies for 4 days in the absence of RA and then treated for 2 h with all-trans-retinoic acid as previously described (9.Delacroix L.

Further details are provided in the supplemental Experimental Procedures. ChIP-seq was performed using the panRAR antibody (Sc-773, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and sequenced on an Illumina GAIIx sequencer, and the raw data were analyzed by the Illumina Eland pipeline V1.7 or V1.8 and aligned to the genome with Bowtie. Peak detection was performed using the MACS software (13.Zhang Y. Liu T. Meyer C.A. Eeckhoute J. Johnson D.S. Bernstein B.E. Nusbaum C. Myers R.M. Brown M. Li W. Liu X.S. Model-based analysis of ChIP-seq (MACS).Genome Biology. 2008; 9: R137Crossref PubMed Scopus (8536) Google Scholar) under settings where an anti-GFP ChIP from the embryoid bodies was used as a negative control. Peaks were then annotated using GPAT (14.Krebs A. Frontini M. Tora L. GPAT. Retrieval of genomic annotation from large genomic position datasets.BMC Bioinformatics. 2008; 9: 533Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) with a window of ±20 kb with respect to the coordinates of the beginning and end of Ensembl genes (release 64). Cluster comparison of ChIP-seq data sets was performed with seqMINER (15.Ye T. Krebs A.R. Choukrallah M.A. Keime C. Plewniak F. Davidson I. Tora L. seqMINER. An integrated ChIP-seq data interpretation platform.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: e35Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). F9 embryonal carcinoma cells were grown under standard conditions and treated with 10−6 m RA for 2 h before ChIP-seq with the panRAR antibody. 5A. Chatagnon, P. Veber, J. Bedo, V. Laudet, A. Kowalczyk, F. d'Alche-Buc, and G. Benoit, manuscript in preparation. ChIP-seq analysis and annotation was performed as described above. EMSA assays were performed essentially as previously described (9.Delacroix L. Moutier E. Altobelli G. Legras S. Poch O. Choukrallah M.A. Bertin I. Jost B. Davidson I. Cell-specific interaction of retinoic acid receptors with target genes in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and embryonic stem cells.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 231-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) using purified bacterial recombinant RARαΔAB-RXRαΔAB as described (16.Rochel N. Ciesielski F. Godet J. Moman E. Roessle M. Peluso-Iltis C. Moulin M. Haertlein M. Callow P. Mély Y. Svergun D.I. Moras D. Common architecture of nuclear receptor heterodimers on DNA direct repeat elements with different spacings.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18: 564-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The RAR binding elements in each oligonucleotide were centered and surrounded by their native flanking sequences. The sequences of the oligonucleotides are available on request. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried and exposed to autoradiographic film or a PhosphorImager plate. ITC measurements were performed at 25 °C on a MicroCal ITC200 (MicroCal). Double-stranded DNA and purified proteins bound to 9-cis-RA were dialyzed extensively against the same buffer used in the ITC experiments. The buffer contained 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 100 mm sodium chloride, 2% glycerol, and 1 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine. In a typical experiment 2-μl aliquots of DNA at 80–150 μm were injected into a 10 μm RAR-RXR solution (200-μl sample cell). The delay between injections was 120 to 180 s to permit the signal to return to base line before the next injection. ITC titration curves were analyzed using the software Origin 7.0 (OriginLab). Standard free energies of binding and entropic contributions were obtained, respectively, as ΔG = −RT ln(Ka) and TΔS = ΔH − ΔG from the Ka and ΔH values derived from ITC curve fitting. The 150 nucleotides surrounding the ChIP-seq peaks were analyzed using a custom JAVA API application to detect perfect consensus 5′-RGKTCA-3′ half-sites with the different spacings. Analysis of the 150-bp regions from ChIP-seq peaks where no canonical DR elements were found using the MEME program (17.Bailey T.L.a.E.C. Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology. AAAI Press, Menlo Park, CA1994: 28-36Google Scholar) identified the pseudo-DR0 consensus. MEME analysis was also used to derive the consensus DR0 and DR8 sequences by analysis of 200 ChIP-seq peaks of each class. FIMO was used to search for the FOXA1 consensus motif (JASPAR) and was run in default parameters with a p value cutoff of 1e−4. For SPAMO (spaced motif analysis tool) analysis we used the motifs identified in the MEME analysis as the principle and spaced motifs. DRs and their constituent half-sites were mapped in a 150-bp window using the peak summit from MACS analysis as the central position. An in-house JAVA application was used to align all DRs on the same strand to ensure the sense and antisense matches gave homogeneous positions. The motif position profiles are based on a .wig file-like representation with a step size of 1 bp to calculate the number of overlapping motifs present at each position in the 150-bp window. JI embryonic stem cells (129SV/Jae) were grown on inactivated fibroblast feeder cells in the presence of LIF under standard conditions. Cells were passaged three times in absence of feeders before transfer to bacterial dishes for embryoid body formation. For reporter assays, transfections comprised 1 μg of the TATA-chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporters, 1 μg of pCH110-expressing β-galactosidase as internal standard, and 1 μg of pCMV hRARa and RXRa expression vectors. Transfections were performed with FuGENE (Roche Applied Science), and 24 h after transfection 10−6 m RA was added for an additional 24 h. Extract preparation, β-galactosidase assays, and CAT assays were performed using a Roche Applied Science CAT-ELISA kit as previously described (18.Mengus G. Fadloun A. Kobi D. Thibault C. Perletti L. Michel I. Davidson I. TAF4 inactivation in embryonic fibroblasts activates TGFβ signaling and autocrine growth.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2753-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To generate the TATA-CAT reporter plasmids, the various wild-type and repeat elements were generated by DNA synthesis (GeneArt) with flanking BglII and NotI restriction sites. The plasmids containing these regions were amplified, and the inserts were purified and recloned between the equivalent sites in the previously described TATA-CAT plasmid (11.Kobi D. Steunou A.L. Dembélé D. Legras S. Larue L. Nieto L. Davidson I.

Total RNA was extracted from duplicate cultures of embryoid bodies grown for 4 days in the absence of RA and after 24 h of RA treatment. The mRNA-seq libraries were prepared following the Illumina protocol (supplemental Experimental Procedures). Sequence reads mapped to reference genome mm9/NCBI37 using Tophat (19.Trapnell C. Pachter L. Salzberg S.L. TopHat. Discovering splice junctions with RNA-Seq.Bioinformatics. 2009; 25: 1105-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (8995) Google Scholar). Quantification of gene expression was done using Cufflinks (20.Trapnell C. Williams B.A. Pertea G. Mortazavi A. Kwan G. van Baren M.J. Salzberg S.L. Wold B.J. Pachter L. Transcript assembly and quantification by RNA-Seq reveals unannotated transcripts and isoform switching during cell differentiation.Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (10568) Google Scholar) and annotations from Ensembl release 62. For each transcript the resulting reads per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads (RPKM) were converted into raw read counts, and these counts were added for each gene locus. Data normalization was performed as described by Anders and Huber (21.Anders S. Huber W. Differential expression analysis for sequence count data.Genome Biology. 2010; 11: R106Crossref PubMed Scopus (10308) Google Scholar) and implemented in the DESeq Bioconductor package. Only regulated transcripts with an RPKM of >2, an adjusted p value of <0.1, and a log 2-fold change of >1 and <−1 were considered. We performed RAR ChIP-seq in mouse embryonic stem cells grown for 4 days as embryoid body (EBs) precursor to neuronal differentiation (22.Bibel M. Richter J. Schrenk K. Tucker K.L. Staiger V. Korte M. Goetz M. Barde Y.A. Differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells into a defined neuronal lineage.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) treated for 2 h with RA. Analysis of this data set revealed 13,385 RAR occupied loci that could be annotated to 12,250 Ensembl and predicted transcripts (equivalent of 6,628 RefSeq genes) (supplemental Table 1). As seen for other nuclear receptors (23.Welboren W.J. van Driel M.A. Janssen-Megens E.M. van Heeringen S.J. Sweep F.C. Span P.N. Stunnenberg H.G.

Genome-wide analysis of estrogen receptor binding sites.Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar), more than half of the RAR-occupied sites were located greater than 20 kb upstream or downstream of the transcription start site (TSS) with only 10% residing in the proximal promoter region (−5 to +2 kb with respect to the TSS; supplemental Fig. 1). We analyzed the frequency of all potential DR spacings from DR0 to DR10 (5′-RGKTCA0–10RGKTCA-3′) in the 150 bp surrounding the peak summit of the 1000 highest occupied sites based on the number of sequence tags forming the peak. Similarly, as it has been reported that RAR occupied elements are closely associated with estrogen receptor (ER) binding elements (IR3) in MCF7 cells (25.Hua S. Kittler R. White K.P. Genomic antagonism between retinoic acid and estrogen signaling in breast cancer.Cell. 2009; 137: 1259-1271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), we analyzed the RAR occupied loci for IR0-IR10. This analysis showed that DR0 was by far the most frequently represented spacing followed by DR2, DR8, DR5, and DR1 (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained when analyzing 1000 medium and 1000 low occupied sites. In each case the DR0 and DR2 spacings remained the most frequent followed by DR5 and DR8. However, the total number of loci comprising canonical half-sites with these spacings decreases with occupancy. The higher occupied sites comprise a large proportion of elements with canonical half-site repeats, whereas the lower occupied must contain either more elements with degenerate half-sites and/or other spacings (compare the total number of DRs in each class in Fig. 1A). Analysis of the IR frequencies in each class showed that IR0 is the most frequently found in the highly occupied class, whereas IR9 is also represented in the medium-occupied class (Fig. 1A). Again, the frequency of IR elements is higher in the most occupied class than in the lower occupied classes. The analysis of the total 13385 sites confirmed that DR0 is the most represented spacing followed by DR2, DR5, and DR8 together with IR0 and IR9 (Fig. 1B). Extending the analysis to DR/IR11-DR/IR20 showed that none of these larger spacings was strongly enriched in the data set (data not shown). DR0, not the canonical DR5, is thus the most highly represented DR element at RAR-occupied loci in EBs irrespective of the degree of occupancy in the cells. We further analyzed the frequency of the DR and IR elements in the RAR-occupied sites in the proximal promoter region (−5 to +2 kb) to ask if any of these elements are selectively enriched. DR0 remains the most represented element, but the ratios of DR0/DR5 and DR5/DR8 indicate a modest relative enrichment of DR5 at promoters compared with the highest occupied class but not when compared with the total data set (Fig. 1C). It has been suggested that RAR-occupied motifs in MCF7 cells are closely associated with ER binding sites (IR3) and with sites for the pioneer factor FOXA1 (25.Hua S. Kittler R. White K.P. Genomic antagonism between retinoic acid and estrogen signaling in breast cancer.Cell. 2009; 137: 1259-1271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 26.Carroll J.S. Liu X.S. Brodsky A.S. Li W. Meyer C.A. Szary A.J. Eeckhoute J. Shao W. Hestermann E.V. Geistlinger T.R. Fox E.A. Silver P.A. Brown M. Chromosome-wide mapping of estrogen receptor binding reveals long-range regulation requiring the forkhead protein FoxA1.Cell. 2005; 122: 33-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). No significant representation of IR3 was seen at RAR-occupied sites in EBs (and F9 cells; Fig. 1, A and D). Analysis of the 150 bp around the top 1000 RAR-occupied peaks in EBs revealed only 47 FOXA1 consensus sites, whereas the same analysis in a 500-bp window revealed 259 potential sites (data not shown). Thus, although no close association of RAR and ER binding elements are seen in EBs, around 25% of RAR-occupied loci show association with FOXA1 when a wider window is used. To ask if the above DR frequencies are representative of what can be seen in other cell types, we analyzed the RAR ChIP-seq data set obtained from RA-treated F9 embryonal carcinoma cells.5 Although this data set comprises around 32,000 RAR-occupied loci when analyzed by MACS using the same parameters as for the EB data set, we restricted our analysis to the top 13,385 peaks. Comparison with the EB data set indicated a large fraction of shared sites and potential target genes and a set of sites specific for each cell type (supplemental Fig. 2 and data not shown). Analysis of the F9 data set indicated that DR0 is again the most frequent at the high, medium, or low occupied peaks followed by DR2, DR5, DR8, DR1, and IR0 (Fig. 1D). Overall, the relative DR and IR frequencies are, therefore, similar but not identical to those in the EB data set (Fig. 1B and E) in accordance with the existence of a set of sites specific to F9 cells. To determine if this spectrum of DR frequencies is found at sites occupied by other nuclear receptors, we analyzed DR and IR usage at sites occupied by the vitamin D3 receptor (VDR) in the data set of Ramagopalan et al. (27.Ramagopalan S.V. Heger A. Berlanga A.J. Maugeri N.J. Lincoln M.R. Burrell A. Handunnetthi L. Handel A.E. Disanto G. Orton S.M. Watson C.T. Morahan J.M. Giovannoni G. Ponting C.P. Ebers G.C. Knight J.C. A ChIP-seq defined genome-wide map of vitamin D receptor binding. Associations with disease and evolution.Genome Res. 2010; 20: 1352-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). In striking contrast to what is observed for RAR, for VDR the DR3 element is strongly represented followed by the DR4, but there is no high frequency of DR0 or IR0 elements at these sites (Fig. 1F). Our analysis is in accord with that reported by the authors of this study who defined DR3 as strongly enriched at these sites. Thus, the RAR-RXR heterodimer binds to DR elements with a much larger variety of spacings than the VDR-RXR heterodimer whose specificity is more restricted. To determine if DRs with non-canonical spacings can directly bind RAR-RXR, we performed EMSA analysis with oligonucleotide probes derived from sites occupied by RAR and purified bacterially produced recombinant RARαΔAB-RXRαΔAB (Ref. 16.Rochel N. Ciesielski F. Godet J. Moman E. Roessle M. Peluso-Iltis C. Moulin M. Haertlein M. Callow P. Mély Y. Svergun D.I. Moras D. Common architecture of nuclear receptor heterodimers on DNA direct repeat elements with different spacings.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18: 564-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar; hereafter designated simply RAR-RXR). We first investigated the ability of DR0 elements with fully canonical half-sites, including that present in the suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (Socs3) gene locus (Fig. 2A) or half-sites with a single base mismatch to compete for RAR-RXR bound to the DR5 from the Rarb gene. Several consensus DR0 elements were able to compete in the formation of the RAR-RXR-DR5 complex (see lanes 6–8 in Fig. 2B), whereas DR0s with one or several mismatches were poor competitors or did not compete (lanes 2–4). On the other hand, a DR0 from the AE-binding protein 2 (Aebp2) locus with a single mismatch was a good competitor. Thus, as we previously reported (9.Delacroix L. Moutier E. Altobelli G. Legras S. Poch O. Choukrallah M.A. Bertin I. Jost B. Davidson I. Cell-specific interaction of retinoic acid receptors with target genes in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and embryonic stem cells.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 231-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) in some elements, mismatches are tolerated, whereas at others they are detrimental to in vitro RAR-RXR binding. Competition experiments with increasing quantities of competitor oligonucleotide indicated that the Rarb DR5 motif efficiently competes with between 25- and 50-fold of cold competitor (Fig. 2C, lanes 4 and 5). In comparison, the DR0 motif from the Socs3 gene is less efficient (lanes 7–10), whereas that from the Musashi homolog 2 (Msi2) gene is comparable with DR5 (lanes 11–14). Binding of recombinant RAR-RXR to the Rarb DR5 and the Socs3 and Msi2 DR0 was also assessed by ITC. A dissociation constant (Kd) of 73 nm for the Rarb DR5 and 79 nm for a canonical DR2 from the Hoxa10 gene was determined compared with 76 nm for the Msi2 DR0 and 110 nm for the Socs3 DR0 (Fig. 3, A and B). Thus, consensus DR0s are bona fide RAR-RXR binding elements with in vitro affinities comparable with the canonical DR5. Close analysis of thermodynamic parameters observed for the binding of RAR-RXR to DNA suggests that enthalpy solely drives this protein-DNA interaction and that the increase in the binding affinity to DNA correlates with overall favorable enthalpy. ChIP-seq identified loci with IR0 elements that efficiently competed for complex formation (supplemental Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 4, 6, and 8), whereas mutated versions conserving only one half-site showed no competition (lanes 5, 7, and 9). Titration experiments showed that the IR0s from the methyl-CpG binding domain protein 6 (Mbd6) and tripartite motif containing 16 (Trim16) genes competed with efficiencies comparable with that of the DR5 element (Fig. 2D). This was confirmed by ITC showing a Kd of 58 nm for the Trim16 IR0 element and 97 nm for the consensus IR0 from the Vat1 gene locus (Fig. 3, A and B). DR8 is comparable in frequency to DR5 in the EB and F9 data sets. These elements fall into two classes comprising either a simple DR8 with no other potential half-sites in the spacer sequence or composite half-sites formed by juxtaposition of three half-sites with DR2 and DR0 spacings (Fig. 4A). Of the 431 DR0 elements in the top 1000 EB sites (Fig. 1A), 183 form DR8 with an additional 5′-RGKTCA-3′ half-site. MEME analysis of the remaining DR0 motifs revealed the presence of a variant (5′-RGATCA-3′) half-site at a further 61 loci (Fig. 4A). This unique and specific topological arrangement of half-sites therefore constitutes a highly represented element at RAR-occupied loci and leaves only 187 DR0s with no recognizable 5′ half-site with a DR2 spacing. Similarly in F9 cells, 63 of the 74 DR8s in the highly occupied class have an additional DR2-spaced half-site (supplemental Fig. 4A). We next asked whether RAR bound the DR2, DR0, or DR8 spacings of these elements. We chose two composite DR8 elements identified by ChIP-seq at the v-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene family, protein A (Mafa) and CD97 antigen (Cd97) gene loci (supplemental Fig. 4B). The wild-type Mafa and Cd97 elements both efficiently competed complex formation in EMSA assays (supplemental Fig. 4C, lanes 4 and 9 and Fig. 4B, lanes 7–10). Oligonucleotides mutated in the central half-site leaving the DR8 spacing also competed (supplemental Fig. 4C, lanes 5 and 12 and Fig. 4B, lanes 19–22). Mutation of the 5′ half-site leaving only the DR0 resulted in much less efficient competition (supplemental Fig. 4C, lanes 6 and 10 and Fig. 4B, lanes 11–14). In contrast, mutation of the 3′ site leaving the DR2 led to efficient competition (supplemental Fig. 4C, lanes 7 and 11 and Fig. 4B, lanes 15–18). Mutation of the 5′ and 3′ sites leaving only a single half-site essentially abolished competition (supplemental Fig. 4C, lanes 8 and 13 and Fig. 4B, lanes 23–26). Further evidence that DR8 can bind RAR-RXR comes from the Dedd gene locus whose simple DR8 is an efficient competitor in EMSA assays (supplemental Fig. 5A, compare lanes 1–4 with 9–12 and the mutated element in lanes 5–8). It is noteworthy that at least in vitro, DR8 elements with the variant 5′-RGATCA-3′ half-site are much less efficient competitors than those with the 5′-RGKTCA-3′ half-sites (supplemental Fig. 5B). The binding of the RAR-RXR to the Mafa element was also analyzed by ITC, showing that the Mafa DR2 had a high affinity with a Kd of 25 nm, whereas this DR0 had a lower affinity than the other DR0s with a Kd of 180 nm (Fig. 3, A and B). ITC performed with the WT Mafa element containing all three half-sites showed bimodal binding. The first phase indicated occupancy of a high affinity site with a Kd of 13 nm followed by a second phase with much lower affinity of 180 nm. These results are consistent with binding of high affinity DR2 or DR8 and lower affinity to the DR0. We also labeled oligonucleotides comprising the WT and mutated Mafa DR8, the Msi2 DR0, and the Dedd DR8 and tested their ability to form a complex with recombinant RAR-RXR. The WT Mafa element formed a complex with mobility identical to Rarb DR5 or Hoxa10 DR2 elements (supplemental Fig. 5C, lanes 4 and 5, 1 and 2, and 14 and 15). Complex formation was also seen with the DR8 and DR2 combinations, whereas binding to the DR0 was less efficient (supplemental Fig. 5C, lanes 8 and 9). The Msi2 DR0 and the Dedd DR8 also form complexes with RAR-RXR (supplemental Fig. 5C, 12 and 13 and 16 and 17). These results confirm those of the EMSA competition and ITC showing that DR0 and DR8 form complexes with RAR-RXR. Furthermore, a single RAR-RXR heterodimer appears to bind to the WT Mafa DR8, as no slower migrating complex corresponding to an additional RAR and/or RXR bound to the third half-site was observed. We analyzed the position of the constitutive half-sites in the 183 DR8s from the top 1000 sites of EB data set with respect to the ChIP-seq peak summit. For each half-site two populations are seen. The first is consistent with occupancy of the DR2 motif localizing the two half-sites of the DR2 close to the summit and the 3′ half-site of the DR0 downstream (Fig. 4C). The second population is more consistent with occupancy of the DR0 and localizes the 5′ half-site of the DR2 to a more upstream position and the 3′ half-site of the DR0 toward the peak center. As a consequence of the fact that the firs"

These effects are associated with an elevation in the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α, a transcriptional coactivator of genes comprising the fatty acid oxidation and gluconeogenic pathways.

This finding has led to the proposal that alterations in hepatic FGF21 expression play a role in mediating changes in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism caused by HF-LC ketogenic diet consumption. In this model, the HF-LC diet-induced increase in the synthesis and secretion of FGF21 activates hepatic fatty acid oxidation and gluconeogenesis. Alterations in these metabolic processes in turn facilitate the synthesis of ketone bodies from dietary fatty acids delivered to the liver. Support for this model is derived from studies demonstrating that knockdown of hepatic FGF21 expression attenuates the increase in hepatic fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis caused by consumption of an HF-LC ketogenic diet (5.Potthoff M.J.

The striking ability of FGF21 to reverse obesity and diabetes without deleterious side effects has generated a strong interest in the physiological and molecular mechanisms controlling FGF21 expression. The mechanisms mediating the nutritional regulation of FGF21 expression have not been completely defined. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) is a nuclear receptor that mediates the stimulatory effect of starvation and high fat consumption on the expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation (18.Kersten S. Seydoux J. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α mediates the adaptive response to fasting.J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that deletion of the PPARα gene suppresses the ability of HF-LC consumption and starvation to induce hepatic FGF21 mRNA abundance (4.Inagaki T. Dutchak P. Zhao G. Ding X.

As deletion of PPARα does not abolish the effects of HF-LC consumption and starvation on FGF21 mRNA abundance, a PPARα-independent pathway(s) also contributes to the nutritional regulation of FGF21 gene expression. The objective of the present study was to identify endogenous signaling factors that mediate the nutritional regulation of hepatic FGF21 expression. We have identified two sources of PPARα activators (i.e. nonesterified unsaturated fatty acids and chylomicron remnants) that induce of FGF21 expression. In addition, we have discovered that endogenous activators of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) (i.e. bile acids) and an endocrine component of the FXR signaling pathway (i.e. FGF19) cause a robust increase in FGF21 expression and/or FGF21 secretion. We also show that FXR plays a role in mediating the stimulatory effect of an HF-LC ketogenic diet on FGF21 expression.

After the cells reached 80% confluence, the medium was changed to one of the same composition lacking fetal bovine serum. After 24 h of incubation, the medium was replaced with serum-DMEM containing the treatments indicated in the figure legends. Fatty acids (Nu Chek Prep) were prepared as 1 mm stock solutions in complex with bovine serum albumin (BSA) at a 1:4 molar ratio (21.Mooney R.A. Lane M.D. Formation and turnover of triglyceride-rich vesicles in the chick liver cell. Effects of cAMP and carnitine on triglyceride mobilization and conversion to ketones.J. Biol.

Intestinal lymph was obtained from lymph fistula rats intubated intraduodenally with a lipid emulsion containing safflower oil (0.36 g/animal) (22.Tso P. Karlstad M.D. Bistrian B.R. DeMichele S.J.

The procedure for preparing whole chylomicrons and chylomicron remnants from the intestinal lymph has been described (24.Florén C.H. Nilsson A.

Commun. 1977; 74: 520-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The triacylglycerol content of chylomicrons and chylomicron remnants was determined using a Triglyceride and Free Glycerol kit supplied by Sigma-Aldrich. The fatty acid composition of chylomicrons and chylomicron remnants was determined by gas chromatography. Chenodeoxycholic acid, taurochenodeoxycholic acid, taurocholic acid, taurodeoxycholic acid, cholic acid, glucagon-like peptide-1, GW4064, 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine (T3), corticosterone, 1,4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene (TCPOBOP) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. GW7647 and GW0742 were purchased from Cayman Chemical. Bovine insulin and glucagon were gifts from Lilly. Recombinant human FGF19 (R&D Systems), rat leptin (Alexis Biochemicals), and tauro-β-muricholic acid (Steraloids) were obtained from the indicated sources. Total RNA was extracted from tissues and cell cultures by the guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method (25.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Single-step method of RNA isolation by acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction.Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63149) Google Scholar). The abundance of mRNA encoding FGF21 and bile salt export pump (BSEP) was measured by quantitative real time PCR analysis using the Qiagen Quantitect SYBR Green RT-PCR system. Samples of DNase I-treated RNA (100 ng) were analyzed in triplicate according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR was performed in 96-well plates using a Bio-Rad iCycler iQ. The relative amount of mRNA was calculated using the comparative Ct method. Rat cyclophilin, human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and mouse 36B4 were used as reference genes. Amplification of specific transcripts was confirmed by analyzing the melting curve profile performed at the end of each run and by determining the size of the PCR products using agarose electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. The primer set for each gene is shown in supplemental Table S1. Fragments of the rat FGF21 promoter/regulatory region were amplified by PCR and inserted into the KpnI and XhoI sites of pGL3-Basic (Promega). The FGF21 DNA fragments were named by designating the 5′- and 3′-ends of each fragment relative to the transcription start site. A mutation of the FXR response element (FXRE) at −1221 and −1220 bp was introduced into the −1316 to +68 bp FGF21 reporter plasmid using the Agilent QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit. Structures of reporter plasmids were confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis. Hepatocytes were plated on 35-mm dishes and transfected with 2 μg of the −2940 to +68 bp FGF21 reporter plasmid or an equimolar amount of another reporter plasmid using Effectene reagent (Qiagen). At 12 h of incubation, the transfection medium was replaced with fresh medium with or without GW4064. At 36 h of incubation, cells were harvested, and cell extracts were prepared in 1× Cell Culture Lysis Buffer (Promega). Cell extracts were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 1 min, and the supernatants were assayed for protein concentration and luciferase activity. Luciferase assay reagent was obtained from Promega. Complementary oligonucleotides containing the FGF21 FXRE were synthesized with biotin attached to their 3′-ends. These oligonucleotides were annealed for 2 h at room temperature. Recombinant human FXR and retinoid X receptor (RXR) α were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Binding reactions (20 μl) contained 200 pmol of DNA probe, 150 ng of FXR and RXRα, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), and 2.5% (v/v) glycerol. Reactions were carried out at room temperature for 30 min. DNA and DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels at 4 °C in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 45 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA) and then transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane in 0.5× TBE. Transferred DNAs were cross-linked to the membrane by UV irradiation. DNA on membranes was detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin in combination with chemiluminescent substrate (LightShiftTM chemiluminescence EMSA kit, Thermo Scientific). For competition experiments, unlabeled competitor DNA was mixed with labeled oligomer prior to the addition of FXR and RXRα. For antibody supershift experiments, the reaction was incubated with antibodies against FXR or NF1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min prior to the addition of the oligonucleotide probe. The culture medium (3 ml) from a single plate of cells was centrifuged to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was concentrated to 200 μl using an Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filter unit. Proteins contained in the concentrated supernatant were subjected to electrophoresis in 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-FL, Millipore) using an electroblotting apparatus (Bio-Rad). The blots were blocked in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween) containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with primary antibody diluted 1:500 in TBST containing 5% bovine serum albumin. After incubation with primary antibody for 12 h at 4 °C, the blots were washed in TBST. Next, the blots were incubated with secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) diluted 1:2000 in TBST and 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with TBST, antibody-protein complexes on blots were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Fluorescence on the blots was visualized using a Typhoon 9410 imager, and signals were quantified using ImageQuant software. Goat polyclonal antibodies against mouse FGF21 (AF3057), human FGF21 (TA303289), and albumin (sc-46293) were obtained from R&D Systems, Origene, and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. Plasma FGF21 concentration was determined using an FGF21 ELISA kit (R&D Systems). Data were subjected to analysis of variance, and statistical comparisons were made with the Dunnett's or Student's t test. Primary cultures of rat hepatocytes are strongly responsive to nutritional and hormonal signals and have been used successfully to screen factors that regulate hepatic gene expression (26.Ichihara A. Nakamura T. Tanaka K. Tomita Y. Aoyama K. Kato S. Shinno H. Biochemical functions of adult rat hepatocytes in primary culture.Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1980; 349: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Prior to using this system to identify nutritional signals controlling the expression of FGF21, we wanted to verify that the nutritional regulation of rat FGF21 expression was similar to that described in other species. Feeding rats an HF-LC ketogenic diet for 6 days or starving rats for 30 h stimulated an 18–35-fold increase in hepatic FGF21 mRNA abundance compared with rats fed a standard purified diet or chow diet (Fig. 1A). The effects of these dietary manipulations on FGF21 mRNA abundance in rat liver are similar to those reported in mouse liver (4.Inagaki T. Dutchak P. Zhao G. Ding X. Gautron L. Parameswara V. Li Y.

https://openalex.org/W1975412389,"Endometriosis afflicts ~15% of women of reproductive age, causing pelvic pain, and is often associated with infertility. In a new study, Bert O'Malley and his colleagues now show that in response to TNF-α signaling, a unique isoform of SRC-1, an estrogen receptor coactivator, is elevated in endometriotic tissue, preventing the normal apoptosis of these cells. These results could explain the proliferation of these cells, while also further suggesting the antibody to TNF-α etanercept as a therapy for this condition. Endometriosis is considered to be an estrogen-dependent inflammatory disease, but its etiology is unclear. Thus far, a mechanistic role for steroid receptor coactivators (SRCs) in the progression of endometriosis has not been elucidated. An SRC-1–null mouse model reveals that the mouse SRC-1 gene has an essential role in endometriosis progression. Notably, a previously unidentified 70-kDa SRC-1 proteolytic isoform is highly elevated both in the endometriotic tissue of mice with surgically induced endometriosis and in endometriotic stromal cells biopsied from patients with endometriosis compared to normal endometrium. Tnf−/− and Mmp9−/− mice with surgically induced endometriosis showed that activation of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α)–induced matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) activity mediates formation of the 70-kDa SRC-1 C-terminal isoform in endometriotic mouse tissue. In contrast to full-length SRC-1, the endometriotic 70-kDa SRC-1 C-terminal fragment prevents TNF-α–mediated apoptosis in human endometrial epithelial cells and causes the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and the invasion of human endometrial cells that are hallmarks of progressive endometriosis. Collectively, the newly identified TNF-α–MMP9–SRC-1 isoform functional axis promotes pathogenic progression of endometriosis."

Results: A genome-wide search revealed Rybp as a novel target of miR-29, and it silences myogenic loci together with YY1. Conclusion: Rybp functions as a repressor of myogenesis. Significance: This study identifies a novel regulatory circuitry underlying muscle formation and highlights the intimate interplay among transcription factors, epigenetic regulators, and microRNAs. Skeletal muscle growth and regeneration are attributed to satellite cells (muscle stem cells), which are characterized by the expression of paired-box transcription factor 7 (Pax7) and when activated, become immature muscle cells or myoblasts that will proliferate and differentiate. The formation of mature muscle proceeds with the exit of myoblasts from the cell cycle, the expression of muscle-specific genes, and the suppression of genes that are specific to other cell lineages and tissues (1.Buckingham M. Myogenic progenitor cells and skeletal myogenesis in vertebrates.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2006; 16: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). A major portion of our understanding of myogenic differentiation is focused at the level of transcription, orchestrated by a complex network of muscle-specific transcription factors, including MyoD, myogenic factor 5 (Myf5), myogenin, myogenic regulatory factor 4 (MRF4), and myocyte enhancer factor 2 (Mef2). These factors activate muscle-specific genes to coordinate myoblasts to terminally withdraw from the cell cycle and subsequently fuse into multinucleated myotubes (2.Sabourin L.A. Rudnicki M.A. The molecular regulation of myogenesis.Clin. Genet. 2000; 57: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). In addition to transcription factors, epigenetic regulators exert an important layer of transcriptional control (3.Perdiguero E. Sousa-Victor P. Ballestar E. Muñoz-Cánoves P. Epigenetic regulation of myogenesis.Epigenetics. 2009; 4: 541-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The interplay between transcription factors and these regulators on muscle loci constitutes an important part of the signaling pathways. Studies from recent years have also incorporated microRNAs (miRNAs) 3The abbreviations used are: miRNAmicroRNAESCembryonic stem cellCTXcardiotoxinTAtibialis anteriorIFimmunofluorescenceCLNcentrally located nucleiPcGPolycomb group proteinqRTquantitative reverse transcriptionHDAChistone deacetylaseMyHCmyosin heavy chain. into the complex network of myogenic regulation. As noncoding single-stranded RNAs of 21 to 25 nucleotides and a novel class of gene regulators, miRNAs negatively regulate their targets at the post-transcriptional level through binding to their 3′ UTR leading to either mRNA cleavage or translational repression (4.Bartel D.P. MicroRNAs. Genomics, biogenesis, mechanism, and function.Cell. 2004; 116: 281-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29453) Google Scholar). A subset of these miRNAs, miR-1, miR-133, and miR-206, play central regulatory roles in muscle biology and are called muscle miRs. In addition to the above muscle miRs, emerging evidence also supports the involvement of non-muscle miRs in myogenesis (5.Wang H. Sun H. Guttridge D.C. MicroRNAs, novel components in a muscle gene regulatory network.Cell Cycle. 2009; 8: 1833-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In an effort to elucidate the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation during skeletal myogenesis, we identified an NF-κB (NF-κB)-Yin Yang1 (YY1)-miR-29 signaling axis (6.Wang H. Garzon R.

YY1, a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor, upon activation by NF-κB signaling, functions to repress muscle differentiation by epigenetically silencing the transcription of miR-29 through recruiting histone methyltransferase Ezh2 as well as histone deacetylase 1 (6.Wang H. Garzon R. Sun H. Ladner K.J. Singh R. Dahlman J. Cheng A. Hall B.M. Qualman S.J. Chandler D.S.

At the onset of myogenesis, YY1 is down-regulated by decreased NF-κB signaling, which results in the replacement of the YY1-Ezh2-histone deacetylase 1 repressive complex by an activator complex containing MyoD, serum response factor along with associated acetyltransferases cAMP-response element-binding protein and p300/cAMP-response element-binding protein-associated factor, leading to the activation of miR-29. MiR-29 in turn targets Yy1 resulting in its further decrease. These findings highlight the intimate interaction of the transcription factor, miRNA, and chromatin modulator. microRNA embryonic stem cell cardiotoxin tibialis anterior immunofluorescence centrally located nuclei Polycomb group protein quantitative reverse transcription histone deacetylase myosin heavy chain. In addition to Yy1, miR-29 directly targets DNMT3a and DNMT3b in lung cancer and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (8.Fabbri M. Garzon R. Cimmino A. Liu Z. Zanesi N. Callegari E. Liu S. Alder H.

MiR-29b can also indirectly silence DNMT1 by targeting SP1, a transactivator of DNMT1 (9.Garzon R. Liu S. Fabbri M. Liu Z. Heaphy C.E. Callegari E. Schwind S. Pang J. Yu J. Muthusamy N. Havelange V.

These findings together with ours support the ability of miR-29 in regulating epigenetic machinery. We thus speculated that in addition to Yy1, miR-29 may regulate many other epigenetic factors whose unveiling will be facilitated by a genome-wide search. As members of Polycomb group proteins (PcGs), YY1 and Ezh2 together regulate a number of muscle loci including both muscle structure genes and muscle relevant miRNAs (5.Wang H. Sun H. Guttridge D.C. MicroRNAs, novel components in a muscle gene regulatory network.Cell Cycle. 2009; 8: 1833-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The PcG genes encode a structurally diverse group of proteins, which form large complexes arising from their mutual interactions. Despite their well characterized functions in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (10.Boyer L.A. Plath K. Zeitlinger J. Brambrink T. Medeiros L.A. Lee T.I. Levine S.S. Wernig M. Tajonar A. Ray M.K.

In this work, a genome-wide transcriptome survey was employed to uncover that a number of epigenetic factors were down-regulated in miR-29 expressing C2C12 cells, with Rybp, an YY1 interacting PcG protein, being one of them. MiR-29 was able to target Rybp directly through a conserved binding site on its 3′ UTR. Both in vitro and in vivo functional studies showed that Rybp is a negative regulator of skeletal myogenesis, which functions as a co-repressor of YY1 to silence the myogenic loci including miR-29 itself. Our study thus identified a novel functional Rybp-miR-29 regulatory circuitry in skeletal muscle formation. Mouse C2C12 myoblasts (CRL-1772) were obtained from ATCC and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg of streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For myogenic differentiation, cells were seeded in 60- or 100-mm plates and shifted to DMEM containing 2% horse serum when 90% confluence. Primary myoblasts were isolated from approximately 1-week-old mice muscles by the described procedures (12.Lu L. Zhou L. Chen E.Z. Sun K. Jiang P. Wang L. Su X. Sun H. Wang H.

Briefly, total hind limb muscles (3 to 6 mice per group) were digested with type IV collagenase (Invitrogen, 5 mg/ml) and dispase II (Invitrogen, 1.4 mg/ml) for 0.5 h, and cell suspensions were further homogenized by pipetting before being filtered through 70- and 40-μm filters. The obtained cells were pre-plated on uncoated cell culture plates in F10 media (Invitrogen) to selectively enrich for myoblasts. After two rounds of pre-plating, the cell suspension was plated on gelatin-coated plates (Iwaki) in F10 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% FBS and basic fibroblast growth factor (Invitrogen, 25 ng/ml). Primary myoblasts were used at passages 3–5 after isolation. Transient transfection with miRNA precursor oligos, siRNA oligos, or DNA plasmids was performed on 60- or 100-mm dishes with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent as suggested by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). For luciferase experiments, C2C12 and primary myoblasts were transfected in 12-well plates. Cell extracts were prepared and luciferase activity was monitored as previously described (14.Guttridge D.C. Albanese C. Reuther J.Y. Pestell R.G. Baldwin Jr., A.S.

To generate C2C12 cells stably expressing Rybp, a Rybp expressing plasmid (4 μg) was transfected into C2C12 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 36 h after transfection, cells were placed in 400 μg/ml of G418 (Invitrogen) for stable selection. Stable clones were pooled together after ∼2 week selection. Precursor miRNA oligos were obtained from Ambion. miRCURY LNA microRNA inhibitor or control oligos were obtained from Exiqon. The 19-nucleotide siRNA duplexes against mouse Rybp coding region (siRNA, 5′-CGACATGTCAGCAGTGAAT-3′) or scrambled oligos were obtained from RiboBio. In each case 100 nm oligos were used for transient transfection into cells. To construct a Rybp-3′ UTR reporter plasmid, a 401-bp fragment encompassing the miR-29 binding site was amplified by primers (forward primer, 5′-AGTTCTAGAAGACTCCATCCTGTCAGCATATC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-AGTTCTAGAGGAAAAAGGCCGGAATTCGA-3′) and cloned into pGL3 vector (Promega) at the XbaI site. To construct a mutant reporter plasmid, the seed region was mutated from TGGTGCTT to TCATAAGT. To generate a Rybp expression plasmid, the full-length coding region of Rybp was amplified by primers (forward primer, 5′-AGTGCTAGCATGACCATGGGCGACAAGAAG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-AGTGGTACCTCAGAAAGATTCATCATTCACTGC-3′), digested, and cloned into pcDNA3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen) at NheI and KpnI sites.

Renilla luciferase reporter was obtained from Promega and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNAs were extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Expression of mature miRNAs was determined using the miRNA-specific TaqMan microRNA assay kit (Applied Biosystem) on an ABI PRISM 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystem). U6 was used for normalization. Expression of mRNA analysis was performed with SYBR Green Master Mix (Bio-Rad) as described using GAPDH for normalization (7.Wang H. Hertlein E. Bakkar N. Sun H.

Quantification of the number of fibers with centrally located nuclei (CLN) and IF positively stained cells was performed from a minimum of 20 randomly chosen fields, from 5 to 6 sections throughout the length of the muscle in 4–6 mice per group. All fluorescent images were captured with a confocal laser scanning microscope (FV1000, Olympus, Japan). All samples were imaged with ×20 or 40 objective lens. Pictures were captured in Kahlman frame giving an average of two scans using the Olympus microscope FV1000 and the accompanying software FV10-ASW (version 01.07.02.02, Olympus).

Briefly, 10 μg of normal IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), antibodies against YY1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or Rybp (Millipore) was cross-linked to 50 μl (bed volume) of Protein A/G PLUS-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) by dimethyl pimelimidate (Sigma). C2C12 cells were first cross-linked with 200 μg/ml of 3,3′-dithiodipropionic acid di(N-hydroxysuccinimide ester) (Sigma) for 20 min and then harvested and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 × Protease Inhibitor Mixture). The antibody-conjugated beads were incubated with 500 μg of the above cell lysate overnight at 4 °C with rotation. After extensive washing with RIPA buffer, the bound proteins were eluted by boiling in 20 μl of 2× sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, with 4% SDS, 20% (v/v) glycerol) and subjected to Western blot analysis. ChIP assays were performed as recommended by the manufacturer (Upstate) using 5 μg of antibodies against Rybp (Millipore), YY1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Ezh2 (Cell signaling), trimethyl-histone H3-K27 (Millipore), or isotype IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) used as a negative control. Genomic DNA pellets were resuspended in 20 μl of water. qRT-PCR was performed with 1 μl of immunoprecipitated material with SYBR Green Master Mix (Bio-Rad). Relative enrichment is calculated as the amount of amplified DNA normalized to input and relative to values obtained after normal IgG immunoprecipitation, which were set as 1. Primers used are listed in supplemental Table S1. C57B/L mice were housed in the animal facility of the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) under conventional conditions with constant temperature and humidity and fed a standard diet. Animal experimentation was approved by the CUHK Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee (Ref No. 10/027/MIS). For cardiotoxin (CTX) injection, approximately 5-week-old mice were injected with 60 μl of CTX at 10 μg/ml into the tibialis anterior (TA) muscles. Oligos were prepared by preincubating 10 μm siRNA oligos with Lipofectamine 2000 for 15 min and injections were made in a final volume of 60 μl in OPTI-EM (Invitrogen) at days 1/4, 2, and 4. Mice were sacrificed and TA muscles were harvested at days 1, 2, 4, and 6, and total RNAs and proteins were extracted for real-time RT-PCR and Western analyses. For immunofluorescene staining of MyoD, Myogenin, and Pax7, muscle sections were collected at day 3. Statistical significance was assessed by the Student's t test (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001). To gain insights into the miR-29-mediated events in muscle cells, we previously performed a genomewide transcriptome analysis by high throughput RNA sequencing (19.Zhou L. Wang L. Lu L. Jiang P. Sun H. Wang H. Inhibition of miR-29 by TGF-β-Smad3 signaling through dual mechanisms promotes transdifferentiation of mouse myoblasts into myofibroblasts.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e33766Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). 739 genes were found to be down-regulated by miR-29 overexpression. Interestingly, many epigenetic factors were decreased, including previously identified targets of miR-29, Hdac4 and Dnmt1 (Fig. 1, A and B), suggesting miR-29 is an important epigenetic regulator. When compared with vector control cells, these genes were suppressed to a different extent with Cbx4 38 versus Suz12 16%. Yy1 RNAs, on the other hand, were not found to be significantly down-regulated. This is in line with our previous finding showing that miR-29 represses Yy1 translation but not transcription (6.Wang H. Garzon R. Sun H. Ladner K.J. Singh R. Dahlman J. Cheng A. Hall B.M. Qualman S.J. Chandler D.S. NF-[kappa] B-YY1-miR-29 regulatory circuitry in skeletal myogenesis and rhabdomyosarcoma.Cancer Cell. 2008; 14: 369-381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Among the down-regulated genes, Rybp caught our attention because it was consistently predicted to be a direct target of miR-29 by three algorithms, TargetScan (20.Lewis B.P. Shih I.H. Jones-Rhoades M.W. Bartel D.P. Burge C.B. Prediction of mammalian microRNA targets.Cell. 2003; 115: 787-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4215) Google Scholar), miRanda (21.Enright A.J. John B. Gaul U. Tuschl T. Sander C. Marks D.S. MicroRNA targets in Drosophila.Genome Biol. 2003; 5: R1Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and PicTar (22.Krek A. Grün D. Poy M.N. Wolf R. Rosenberg L. Epstein E.J. MacMenamin P. da Piedade I. Gunsalus K.C. Stoffel M. Rajewsky N. Combinatorial microRNA target predictions.Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (3893) Google Scholar). Moreover, as a known modifier of chromatins and a member of the PcG genes, its role in myogenesis has never been explored. As revealed by RNA-seq, it was suppressed about 21% by miR-29 overexpression (Fig. 1, A and C). To investigate whether the down-regulation of Rybp is due to direct targeting, A search for miR-29 binding sites within the Rybp 3′ UTR revealed that all three miR-29 family members, miR-29a, -29b, -29c, were predicted to hybridize to an evolutionarily conserved site among vertebrate species (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S1). A perfect match exists between the seed region of miR-29 and the 3′ UTR of Rybp, suggesting that miR-29 can directly repress Rybp expression. This was tested by cloning a 401-bp fragment of the Rybp 3′ UTR encompassing the target site downstream of the firefly luciferase gene. Co-transfection of this reporter (WT) with each of the miR-29 family members caused similar repression of luciferase reporter (Fig. 2B). This was specific to miR-29 binding because the reporter activity was less affected when transfections were repeated with an irrelevant miRNA, miR-194, or with a mutant miR-29 binding site in the Rybp 3′ UTR. At the functional level, we predicted that miR-29 binding to the Rybp 3′ UTR would lead to Rybp repression. Indeed, ectopic expression of miR-29 by transfection of miR-29 oligos or transfection of a pMIF-miR-29 plasmid caused decreased expression of Rybp at both RNA and protein levels (Fig. 2, C and D, and supplemental Fig. S2, A–D), and knockdown of miR-29 by anti-miR oligos led to increased expression of Rybp (Fig. 2, C and D, and supplemental Fig. S2E). Interestingly, in addition to miR-29, Rybp is also predicted to be targeted by muscle miRNAs, miR-1 and miR-206 (supplemental Fig. S3A). Indeed, results from expression and luciferase reporter assays performed as above demonstrated that miR-1 and miR-206 can also directly target Rybp (supplemental Fig. S3, B–F). This is in consistent with the common idea that an mRNA can be targeted by multiple miRNAs. It also further indicates the relevancy of Rybp to myogenesis. To probe into the function of Rybp in skeletal myogenesis, we examined the expression levels of Rybp during C2C12 myoblast differentiation. As shown in Fig. 3A, its expression gradually decreased during a time course of days 0, 2, 4, and 6, whereas the myogenic marker, myosin heavy chain (MyHC) increased. This was concomitant with gradually decreased YY1 expression as well as a gradual increase of miR-29, miR-1, and miR-206 (supplemental Fig. S4), suggesting a functional connection between Rybp and YY1. Consistently, in primary myoblasts isolated from mouse limb muscles, expression of Rybp decreased gradually along with YY1 during differentiation in contrast to the up-regulated expressions of myogenic markers, α-skeletal actin (α-Actin), Troponin, and MyHCIIB (MyHC) (Fig. 3B). Immunofluorescence (IF) staining also revealed that Rybp was co-localized with YY1 in the nuclei of C2C12 myoblasts (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, a physical interaction of Rybp and YY1 was detected in C2C12 myoblasts by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) (Fig. 3D). Together, the above findings suggest that Rybp may be an anti-myogenic factor that acts in concert with YY1. Additional evidence for their functional relationship came from the expression patterns of their transcripts across tissues. Expressions of Rybp and Yy1 were found to be highly coordinated with the highest expression levels in lung and the lowest in skeletal muscle (Fig. 3, E and F). Although Rybp is low in mature skeletal muscle, it was found to be highly enriched in freshly isolated myoblasts together with Yy1 (Fig. 3G), suggesting its role in regulating myoblast growth or differentiation. To test the functional relevance of Rybp during myogenesis, we knocked-down Rybp in C2C12 cells with a siRNA oligo (siRybp). The decreased expression of Rybp was found to enhance C2C12 myogenic differentiation as evidenced by the up-regulated expressions of MyHC, Troponin, α-Actin, and Myogenin at both protein and RNA levels (Fig. 4, A and B). Specifically, miR-29 and miR-1, two other direct transcriptional targets of YY1, were up-regulated by Rybp decrease (Fig. 4C). IF staining also revealed an increased number of MyHC-positive myotubes upon decrease of Rybp (Fig. 4D). Reporter assay with luciferase reporter plasmids containing Troponin, MyHC, miR-29, and promoter/enhancer upstream of luciferase gene, demonstrated an increase of luciferase activity in siRybp cells as compared with cells transfected with negative control oligos (siNC) (Fig. 4E). Collectively, the above findings suggest that Rybp inhibits C2C12 myogenic differentiation. To strengthen the above findings, overexpressing Rybp stably in C2C12 was found to delay differentiation compared with cells expressing vector control as revealed by an expression assay, IF, and reporter assay performed as described above (Fig. 4, F–J). To gain insights into the molecular mechanism on how Rybp repressed myogenesis, we speculated that Rybp may function in the same repressive complex containing YY1 and Ezh2 to epigenetically silence muscle genes and muscle relevant miRNA targets in myoblasts. To test this notion, ChIP assays were performed against Rybp and YY1 using chromatins isolated from C2C12 cells stably expressing vector or Rybp. Both proliferating myoblasts and differentiated myotubes were included in the study. Promoters/enhancers of three known YY1 targets, miR-29, miR-1, and Tnni2, were examined for their association with Rybp and YY1. As expected, in vector myoblasts, strong binding of Rybp was detected on all three target regions along with YY1, and the association dramatically reduced in myotubes (Fig. 5, A and B), suggesting that Rybp functions together with YY1 to silence target expression in proliferating myoblasts and removed together upon myogenic differentiation. Rybp overexpression led to an increase of Rybp binding on these loci but not YY1 enrichment (Fig. 5, A and B), implying that Rybp may not have impact on YY1 targeting. Knowing that Ezh2 is a co-repressor of YY1 on these loci, we further examined Ezh2 binding. Interestingly, Rybp overexpression was found to enhance Ezh2 association (Fig. 5C). Consistently, levels of H3K27me3 displayed the same pattern as Ezh2 (Fig. 5D). Collectively, these data suggest that Rybp functions to suppress muscle genes and miRNAs transcription together with YY1 and Ezh2. This notion was further strengthened by transfecting YY1 or/and Rybp expression plasmids along with a miR-29 promoter reporter in C2C12 cells. Rybp or YY1 alone was found to inhibit the reporter activity to a similar extent, whereas Rybp expression increased YY1 inhibition at a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5E). Last, to extend our in vitro findings to in vivo muscle formation, we explored the function of Rybp in a widely used muscle regeneration model in which the injection of CTX results in muscle injury and in turn induces muscle regeneration. After injection with CTX, TA muscle displays the typical degeneration-regeneration process: fiber degeneration and immune cell infiltration were immediately evident within 1 to 2 days, meanwhile satellite cells start proliferating followed by activation and myogenic differentiation 3 to 4 days afterward, newly formed fibers with CLN are evident within 5 to 6 days, and muscle architecture is largely restored within 10 days (12.Lu L. Zhou L. Chen E.Z. Sun K. Jiang P. Wang L. Su X. Sun H. Wang H.

The expression profile of Rybp mRNAs was examined at days 1, 2, 3, and 6 days post-injection. A sharp increase of more than 10-fold in the first 2 days post-injury was observed, after which its expression level gradually fell down unti"
https://openalex.org/W2066533662,"The aim of our study was to test the robustness and efficiency of maximum likelihood with respect to different long branch effects on multiple-taxon trees. We simulated data of different alignment lengths under two different 11-taxon trees and a broad range of different branch length conditions. The data were analyzed with the true model parameters as well as with estimated and incorrect assumptions about among-site rate variation. If length differences between connected branches strongly increase, tree inference with the correct likelihood model assumptions can fail. We found that incorporating invariant sites together with distributed site rates in the tree reconstruction (+I) increases the robustness of maximum likelihood in comparison with models using only . The results show that for some topologies and branch lengths the reconstruction success of maximum likelihood under the correct model is still low for alignments with a length of 100,000 base positions. Altogether, the high confidence that is put in maximum likelihood trees is not always justified under certain tree shapes even if alignment lengths reach 100,000 base positions."
https://openalex.org/W2167639020,"We have previously shown that a single nucleotide polymorphism rs11536889 in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of TLR4 was associated with periodontitis. In this study the effects of this single nucleotide polymorphism on Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 expression were investigated. Monocytes from subjects with the C/C genotype expressed higher levels of TLR4 on their surfaces than those from subjects with the other genotypes. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the C/C and G/C subjects secreted higher levels of IL-8 in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a TLR4 ligand, than the cells from the G/G subjects. However, there was no significant difference in TLR4 mRNA levels in PBMCs from the subjects with each genotype. After stimulation with tripalmitoylated CSK(4) (Pam(3)CSK(4)), TLR4 mRNA levels increased in PBMCs from both the C/C and G/G subjects, whereas TLR4 protein levels increased in PBMCs from the C/C but not G/G subjects. Transient transfection of a series of chimeric luciferase constructs revealed that a fragment of 3'-UTR containing rs11536889 G allele, but not C allele, suppressed luciferase activity induced by LPS or IL-6. Two microRNAs, hsa-miR-1236 and hsa-miR-642a, were predicted to bind to rs11536889 G allele. Inhibition of these microRNAs reversed the suppressed luciferase activity. These microRNA inhibitors also up-regulated endogenous TLR4 protein on THP-1 cells (the G/G genotype) after LPS stimulation. Furthermore, mutant microRNAs that bind to the C allele inhibited the luciferase activity of the construct containing the C allele. These results indicate that genetic variation of rs11536889 contributes to translational regulation of TLR4, possibly by binding to microRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2064659526,"Understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie plant responses to drought stress is challenging due to the complex interplay of numerous different genes. Here, we used network-based gene clustering to uncover the relationships between drought-responsive genes from large microarray datasets. We identified 2,607 rice genes that showed significant changes in gene expression under drought stress; 1,392 genes were highly intercorrelated to form 15 gene modules. These drought-responsive gene modules are biologically plausible, with enrichments for genes in common functional categories, stress response changes, tissue-specific expression and transcription factor binding sites. We observed that a gene module (referred to as module 4) consisting of 134 genes was significantly associated with drought response in both drought-tolerant and drought-sensitive rice varieties. This module is enriched for genes involved in controlling the response of the plant to water and embryonic development, including a heat shock transcription factor as the key regulator in the expression of ABRE-containing genes. These results suggest that module 4 is highly conserved in the ABA-mediated drought response pathway in different rice varieties. Moreover, our study showed that many hub genes clustered in rice chromosomes had significant associations with QTLs for drought stress tolerance. The relationship between hub gene clusters and drought tolerance QTLs may provide a key to understand the genetic basis of drought tolerance in rice."
https://openalex.org/W2101911603,"There have been concerns that individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are over-represented but not recognised in prison populations. A screening tool for ASDs in prisons has therefore been developed. Aims We aimed to evaluate this tool in Scottish prisoners by comparing scores with standard measures of autistic traits (Autism Quotient (AQ)), neurodevelopmental history (Asperger Syndrome (and High-Functioning Autism) Diagnostic Interview (ASDI)), and social cognition (Ekman 60 Faces test). Methods Prison officers across all 12 publicly-run closed prisons in Scotland assessed convicted prisoners using the screening tool. This sample included male and female prisoners and both adult and young offenders. Prisoners with high scores, along with an equal number of age and sex-matched controls, were invited to take part in interviews. Prisoners' relatives were contacted to complete a neurodevelopmental assessment. Results 2458 prisoners were screened using the tool, and 4% scored above the cut-off. 126 prisoners were further assessed using standardised measures. 7 of those 126 assessed scored 32 or above (cut-off) on the AQ. 44 interviews were completed with prisoners' relatives, no prisoner reached the cut-off score on the ASDI. Scores on the screening tool correlated significantly with AQ and ASDI scores, and not with the Ekman 60 Faces Test or IQ. Sensitivity was 28.6% and specificity 75.6%; AUC was 59.6%. Conclusions Although this screening tool measures autistic traits in this population, sensitivity for scores of 32 or above on the AQ is poor. We consider that this limits its usefulness and do not recommend that the tool is routinely used to screen for ASDs in prisons."

https://openalex.org/W2118515939,"Background Recent studies have implied that osteoarthritis (OA) is a metabolic disease linked to deregulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism and cholesterol efflux. Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Proteins (SREBPs) are transcription factors regulating lipid metabolism with so far no association with OA. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that SREBP-2, a gene that plays a key role in cholesterol homeostasis, is crucially involved in OA pathogenesis and to identify possible mechanisms of action. Methodology/Principal Findings We performed a genetic association analysis using a cohort of 1,410 Greek OA patients and healthy controls and found significant association between single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 1784G>C in SREBP-2 gene and OA development. Moreover, the above SNP was functionally active, as normal chondrocytes’ transfection with SREBP-2-G/C plasmid resulted in interleukin-1β and metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) upregulation. We also evaluated SREBP-2, its target gene 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzymeA reductase (HMGCR), phospho-phosphoinositide3-kinase (PI3K), phospho-Akt, integrin-alphaV (ITGAV) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) mRNA and protein expression levels in osteoarthritic and normal chondrocytes and found that they were all significantly elevated in OA chondrocytes. To test whether TGF-β alone can induce SREBP-2, we treated normal chondrocytes with TGF-β and found significant upregulation of SREBP-2, HMGCR, phospho-PI3K and MMP-13. We also showed that TGF-β activated aggrecan (ACAN) in chondrocytes only through Smad3, which interacts with SREBP-2. Finally, we examined the effect of an integrin inhibitor, cyclo-RGDFV peptide, on osteoarthritic chondrocytes, and found that it resulted in significant upregulation of ACAN and downregulation of SREBP-2, HMGCR, phospho-PI3K and MMP-13 expression levels. Conclusions/Significance We demonstrated, for the first time, the association of SREBP-2 with OA pathogenesis and provided evidence on the molecular mechanism involved. We suggest that TGF-β induces SREBP-2 pathway activation through ITGAV and PI3K playing a key role in OA and that integrin blockage may be a potential molecular target for OA treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2013514204,"The principal signal to activate smooth muscle contraction is phosphorylation of the regulatory light chains of myosin (LC(20)) at Ser(19) by Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinase. Inhibition of myosin light chain phosphatase leads to Ca(2+)-independent phosphorylation at both Ser(19) and Thr(18) by integrin-linked kinase and/or zipper-interacting protein kinase. The functional effects of phosphorylation at Thr(18) on steady-state isometric force and relaxation rate were investigated in Triton-skinned rat caudal arterial smooth muscle strips. Sequential phosphorylation at Ser(19) and Thr(18) was achieved by treatment with adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) in the presence of Ca(2+), which induced stoichiometric thiophosphorylation at Ser(19), followed by microcystin (phosphatase inhibitor) in the absence of Ca(2+), which induced phosphorylation at Thr(18). Phosphorylation at Thr(18) had no effect on steady-state force induced by Ser(19) thiophosphorylation. However, phosphorylation of Ser(19) or both Ser(19) and Thr(18) to comparable stoichiometries (0.5 mol of P(i)/mol of LC(20)) and similar levels of isometric force revealed differences in the rates of dephosphorylation and relaxation following removal of the stimulus: t(&frac12;) values for dephosphorylation were 83.3 and 560 s, and for relaxation were 560 and 1293 s, for monophosphorylated (Ser(19)) and diphosphorylated LC(20), respectively. We conclude that phosphorylation at Thr(18) decreases the rates of LC(20) dephosphorylation and smooth muscle relaxation compared with LC(20) phosphorylated exclusively at Ser(19). These effects of LC(20) diphosphorylation, combined with increased Ser(19) phosphorylation (Ca(2+)-independent), may underlie the hypercontractility that is observed in response to certain physiological contractile stimuli, and under pathological conditions such as cerebral and coronary arterial vasospasm, intimal hyperplasia, and hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W2054891196,"Francisella tularensis subsp. tularensis is a highly infectious bacterium causing acute disease in mammalian hosts. Mechanisms for the acquisition of iron within the iron-limiting host environment are likely to be critical for survival of this intracellular pathogen. FslE (FTT0025) and FupA (FTT0918) are paralogous proteins that are predicted to form β-barrels in the outer membrane of virulent strain Schu S4 and are unique to Francisella species. Previous studies have implicated both FupA, initially identified as a virulence factor and FslE, encoded by the siderophore biosynthetic operon, in iron acquisition. Using single and double mutants, we demonstrated that these paralogs function in concert to promote growth under iron limitation. We used a (55)Fe transport assay to demonstrate that FslE is involved in siderophore-mediated ferric iron uptake, whereas FupA facilitates high affinity ferrous iron uptake. Optimal replication within J774A.1 macrophage-like cells required at least one of these uptake systems to be functional. In a mouse model of tularemia, the ΔfupA mutant was attenuated, but the ΔfslE ΔfupA mutant was significantly more attenuated, implying that the two systems of iron acquisition function synergistically to promote virulence. These studies highlight the importance of specific iron acquisition functions, particularly that of ferrous iron, for virulence of F. tularensis in the mammalian host."
https://openalex.org/W2012447291,"Protein glutathionylation in response to oxidative stress can affect both the stability and activity of target proteins. Mitochondrial thymidine kinase 2 (TK2) is a key enzyme in mitochondrial DNA precursor synthesis. Using an antibody specific for glutathione (GSH), S-glutathionylated TK2 was detected after the addition of glutathione disulfide (GSSG) but not GSH. This was reversed by the addition of dithiothreitol, suggesting that S-glutathionylation of TK2 is reversible. Site-directed mutagenesis of the cysteine residues and subsequent analysis of mutant enzymes demonstrated that Cys-189 and Cys-264 were specifically glutathionylated by GSSG. These cysteine residues do not appear to be part of the active site, as demonstrated by kinetic studies of the mutant enzymes. Treatment of isolated rat mitochondria with hydrogen peroxide resulted in S-glutathionylation of added recombinant TK2. Treatment of intact cells with hydrogen peroxide led to reduction of mitochondrial TK2 activity and protein levels, as well as S-glutathionylation of TK2. Furthermore, the addition of S-glutathionylated recombinant TK2 to mitochondria isolated from hydrogen peroxide-treated cells led to degradation of the S-glutathionylated TK2, which was not observed with unmodified TK2. S-Glutathionylation on Cys-189 was responsible for the observed selective degradation of TK2 in mitochondria. These results strongly suggest that oxidative damage-induced S-glutathionylation and degradation of TK2 have significant impact on mitochondrial DNA precursor synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2076139015,"Are developmental language disorders caused by poor auditory discrimination? This is a popular theory, but behavioural evidence has been inconclusive. Here we studied children with specific language impairment, measuring the brain's electrophysiological response to sounds in a passive paradigm. We focused on the T-complex, an event-related peak that has different origins and developmental course from the well-known vertex response.We analysed auditory event-related potentials to tones and syllables from 16 children and 16 adolescents with specific language impairment who were compared with 32 typically-developing controls, matched for gender, IQ and age.We replicated prior findings of significant reduction in Ta amplitude for both children and adolescents with specific language impairment, which was particularly marked for syllables. The topography of the T-complex to syllables indicated a less focal response in those with language impairments. To distinguish causal models, we considered correlations between size of the Ta response and measures of language and literacy in parents as well as children. The best-fitting model was one in which auditory deficit was a consequence rather than a cause of difficulties in phonological processing.The T-complex to syllables has abnormal size and topography in children with specific language impairment, but this is more likely to be a consequence rather than a cause of difficulties in phonological processing."
https://openalex.org/W2017560375,"Genetic variation in innate immune response genes contributes to inter-individual differences in disease manifestation and degree of complications upon infection. We recently described an association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TLR9 with susceptibility to meningococcal meningitis (MM). In this study, we investigate the association of SNPs in multiple pathogen recognition and immune response genes with clinical features that determine severity and outcome (especially hearing loss) of childhood MM and pneumococcal meningitis (PM). Eleven SNPs in seven genes (TLR2, TLR4, TLR9, NOD1, NOD2, CASP1, and TRAIL) were genotyped in 393 survivors of childhood bacterial meningitis (BM) (327 MM patients and 66 PM patients). Genotype distributions of single SNPs and combination of SNPs were compared between thirteen clinical characteristics associated with severity of BM. After correction for multiple testing, TLR4+896 mutant alleles were highly associated with post-meningitis hearing loss, especially MM (p= 0.001, OR 4.0 for BM, p= 0.0004, OR 6.2 for MM). In a multigene analysis, combined carriership of the TLR2+2477 wild type (WT) with TLR4+896 mutant alleles increases the risk of hearing loss (p<0.0001, OR 5.7 in BM and p= 0.0001, OR 7.6 in MM). Carriage of one or both mutant alleles in TLR4+896 and TLR9 -1237 increases the risk for hearing loss (p = 0.0006, OR 4.1 in BM). SNPs in immune response genes contribute to differences in clinical severity and outcome of BM. The TLR system seems to play an important role in the immune response to BM and subsequent neuronal damage as well as in cochlear inflammation. Genetic markers may be used for identification of high-risk patients by creating prediction rules for post-meningitis hearing loss and other sequelae, and provide more insight in the complex immune response in the CNS possibly resulting in new therapeutic interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2032956033,"RGS-containing RhoGEFs (RGS-RhoGEFs) represent a direct link between the G(12) class of heterotrimeric G proteins and the monomeric GTPases. In addition to the canonical Dbl homology (DH) and pleckstrin homology domains that carry out the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity toward RhoA, these RhoGEFs also possess RGS homology (RH) domains that interact with activated α subunits of G(12) and G(13). Although the GEF activity of p115-RhoGEF (p115), an RGS-RhoGEF, can be stimulated by Gα(13), the exact mechanism of the stimulation has remained unclear. Using combined studies with small angle x-ray scattering, biochemistry, and mutagenesis, we identify an additional binding site for activated Gα(13) in the DH domain of p115. Small angle x-ray scattering reveals that the helical domain of Gα(13) docks onto the DH domain, opposite to the surface of DH that binds RhoA. Mutation of a single tryptophan residue in the α3b helix of DH reduces binding to activated Gα(13) and ablates the stimulation of p115 by Gα(13). Complementary mutations at the predicted DH-binding site in the αB-αC loop of the helical domain of Gα(13) also affect stimulation of p115 by Gα(13). Although the GAP activity of p115 is not required for stimulation by Gα(13), two hydrophobic motifs in RH outside of the consensus RGS box are critical for this process. Therefore, the binding of Gα(13) to the RH domain facilitates direct association of Gα(13) to the DH domain to regulate its exchange activity. This study provides new insight into the mechanism of regulation of the RGS-RhoGEF and broadens our understanding of G protein signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2062517635,"Existing knowledge of the tracks left by sauropod dinosaurs (loosely 'brontosaurs') is essentially two-dimensional, derived mainly from footprints exposed on bedding planes, but examples in the Broome Sandstone (Early Cretaceous) of Western Australia provide a complementary three-dimensional picture showing the extent to which walking sauropods could deform the ground beneath their feet. The patterns of deformation created by sauropods traversing thinly-stratified lagoonal deposits of the Broome Sandstone are unprecedented in their extent and structural complexity. The stacks of transmitted reliefs (underprints or ghost prints) beneath individual footfalls are nested into a hierarchy of deeper and more inclusive basins and troughs which eventually attain the size of minor tectonic features. Ultimately the sauropod track-makers deformed the substrate to such an extent that they remodelled the topography of the landscape they inhabited. Such patterns of substrate deformation are revealed by investigating fragmentary and eroded footprints, not by the conventional search for pristine footprints on intact bedding planes. For that reason it is not known whether similar patterns of substrate deformation might occur at sauropod track-sites elsewhere in the world."
https://openalex.org/W2098008096,"Closely related invasive species may often displace one another, but it is often difficult to determine mechanisms because of the historical nature of these events. The leafmining flies Liriomyza sativae and Liriomyza trifolii have become serious invasive agricultural pests throughout the world. Where both species have invaded the same region, one predominates over the other. Although L. sativae invaded Hainan Island of China first, it recently has been displaced by the newly invasive L. trifolii. We hypothesized that differential susceptibilities to insecticides could be causing this demographic shift.Avermectin and cyromazine are the most commonly used insecticides to manage leafminers, with laboratory bioassays demonstrating that L. trifolii is significantly less susceptible to these key insecticides than is L. sativae. In trials where similar numbers of larvae of both species infested plants, which subsequently were treated with the insecticides, the eclosing adults were predominately L. trifolii, yet similar numbers of adults of both species eclosed from control plants. The species composition was then surveyed in two regions where L. trifolii has just begun to invade and both species are still common. In field trials, both species occurred in similar proportions before insecticide treatments began. Following applications of avermectin and cyromazine, almost all eclosing adults were L. trifolii in those treatment plots. In control plots, similar numbers of adults of the two species eclosed, lending further credence to the hypothesis that differential insecticide susceptibilities could be driving the ongoing displacement of L. sativae by L. trifolii.Our results show that differential insecticide susceptibility can lead to rapid shifts in the demographics of pest complexes. Thus, successful pest management requires the identification of pest species to understand the outcome of insecticide applications. These results further demonstrate the importance of considering anthropogenic factors in the outcome of interspecific interactions."

Ginkgolide B attenuated platelet aggregation and inhibited phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) activation and Akt phosphorylation in thrombin- and collagen-activated platelets. ApoE(-/-) mice were administered a high-cholesterol diet for 8 weeks. Plasma platelet factor 4 (PF4) and RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed, and secreted protein) were then measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Scanning electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry were used to determine atherosclerotic lesions. Ginkgolide B decreased plasma PF4 and RANTES levels in ApoE(-/-) mice. Scanning electron microscopic examination showed that ginkgolide B reduced aortic plaque in ApoE(-/-) mice. Immunohistochemistry analysis demonstrated that ginkgolide B diminished P-selectin, PF4, RANTES, and CD40L expression in aortic plaque in ApoE(-/-) mice. Moreover, ginkgolide B suppressed macrophage and vascular cell adhesion protein 1 (VCAM-1) expression in aorta lesions in ApoE(-/-) mice. Similar effects were observed in aspirin-treated ApoE(-/-) mice.Ginkgolide B significantly reduced atherosclerotic lesions and P-selectin, PF4, RANTES, and CD40L expression in aortic plaque in ApoE-/- mice. The efficacy of ginkgolide B was similar to aspirin. These results provide direct evidence that ginkgolide B inhibits atherosclerosis, which may be associated with inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway in activated platelets."
https://openalex.org/W2027438949,"The endocrine disrupting chemical, bisphenol A (BPA), has been shown to accelerate the rate of adipogenesis and increase the amount of triglyceride accumulation during differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. The objective of this study was to investigate if that observation is mirrored in human primary cells. Here we investigated the effect of BPA on adipogenesis in cultured human primary adult stem cells. Continuous exposure to BPA throughout the 14 days of differentiation dramatically reduced triglyceride accumulation and suppressed gene transcription of the lipogenic enzyme, lipoprotein lipase (LPL). Results presented in the present study show for the first time that BPA can reduce triglyceride accumulation during adipogenesis by attenuating the expression of LPL gene transcription. Also, by employing image cytometric analysis rather than conventional Oil red O staining techniques we show that BPA regulates triglyceride accumulation in a manner which does not appear to effect adipogenesis per se."
https://openalex.org/W2085590405,"Myo10 is an unconventional myosin that localizes to and induces filopodia, structures that are critical for growing axons. In addition to the ~240-kDa full-length Myo10, brain expresses a ~165 kDa isoform that lacks a functional motor domain and is known as headless Myo10. We and others have hypothesized that headless Myo10 acts as an endogenous dominant negative of full-length Myo10, but this hypothesis has not been tested, and the function of headless Myo10 remains unknown. We find that cortical neurons express both headless and full-length Myo10 and report the first isoform-specific localization of Myo10 in brain, which shows enrichment of headless Myo10 in regions of proliferating and migrating cells, including the embryonic ventricular zone and the postnatal rostral migratory stream. We also find that headless and full-length Myo10 are expressed in embryonic and neuronal stem cells. To directly test the function of headless and full-length Myo10, we used RNAi specific to each isoform in mouse cortical neuron cultures. Knockdown of full-length Myo10 reduces axon outgrowth, whereas knockdown of headless Myo10 increases axon outgrowth. To test whether headless Myo10 antagonizes full-length Myo10, we coexpressed both isoforms in COS-7 cells, which revealed that headless Myo10 suppresses the filopodia-inducing activity of full-length Myo10. Together, these results demonstrate that headless Myo10 can function as a negative regulator of full-length Myo10 and that the two isoforms of Myo10 have opposing roles in axon outgrowth."

https://openalex.org/W1985675631,"Histidine-aspartate phosphorelay signaling systems are used to couple stimuli to cellular responses. A hallmark feature is the highly modular signal transmission modules that can form both simple ""two-component"" systems and sophisticated multicomponent systems that integrate stimuli over time and space to generate coordinated and fine-tuned responses. The deltaproteobacterium Myxococcus xanthus contains a large repertoire of signaling proteins, many of which regulate its multicellular developmental program. Here, we assign an orphan hybrid histidine protein kinase, EspC, to the Esp signaling system that negatively regulates progression through the M. xanthus developmental program. The Esp signal system consists of the hybrid histidine protein kinase, EspA, two serine/threonine protein kinases, and a putative transport protein. We demonstrate that EspC is an essential component of this system because ΔespA, ΔespC, and ΔespA ΔespC double mutants share an identical developmental phenotype. Neither substitution of the phosphoaccepting histidine residue nor deletion of the entire catalytic ATPase domain in EspC produces an in vivo mutant developmental phenotype. In contrast, substitution of the receiver phosphoaccepting residue yields the null phenotype. Although the EspC histidine kinase can efficiently autophosphorylate in vitro, it does not act as a phosphodonor to its own receiver domain. Our in vitro and in vivo analyses suggest the phosphodonor is instead the EspA histidine kinase. We propose EspA and EspC participate in a novel hybrid histidine protein kinase signaling mechanism involving both inter- and intraprotein phosphotransfer. The output of this signaling system appears to be the combined phosphorylated state of the EspA and EspC receiver modules. This system regulates the proteolytic turnover of MrpC, an important regulator of the developmental program."

Methods A case control study with 500 people in case group and 500 people in control group. A self-administered questionnaire was used to investigate risk factors for breast cancer. All cases were interviewed during a household survey. Immune-histochemical method was used to inspect the expression of IGF-2 in different tissues (benign breast lesions, breast cancer and tumor-adjacent tissue). Results Multivariate adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using unconditional logistic regression. High body mass index (OR = 1.012,95%CI = 1.008–1.016), working attributes (OR = 1.004, 95%CI = 1.002 = 1.006), long menstrual period (OR = 1.007, 95%CI = 1.005–1.009), high parity OR = 1.003, 95%CI = 1.001–1.005) , frequent artificial abortion (OR = 1.004, 95%CI = 1.001–1.005), family history of cancer (OR = 1.003, 95%CI = 1.000–1.005), period of night shift (OR = 1.003, 95%CI = 1.001–1.006), live in high risk environment (OR = 1.005, 95%CI = 1.002–1.008), and family problems (OR = 1.010, 95%CI = 1.005–1.014) were associated with increased risk for breast cancer. In this study, good sleeping status, positive coping strategies, subjective support, and utility degree of social support were associated with reduced risk for breast cancer (OR = 0.998, 0.997, 0.985, 0.998 respectively; 95%CI = 0.996–1.000, 0.994–1.000, 0.980–0.989, 0.996–1.000, respectively). In benign breast lesions, breast cancer and tumor-adjacent tissue, IGF-2 was mainly expressed in the cytoplasm, but its expression rate was different (p<0.05).

The 18 human ADP-ribose transferases with diphtheria toxin homology include ARTD1/PARP1, a cancer drug target. Knowledge of other family members may guide therapeutics development and help evaluate potential drug side effects. Here, we present the crystal structure of human ARTD15/PARP16, a previously uncharacterized enzyme. ARTD15 features an α-helical domain that packs against its transferase domain without making direct contact with the NAD(+)-binding crevice or the donor loop. Thus, this novel domain does not resemble the regulatory domain of ARTD1. ARTD15 displays auto-mono(ADP-ribosylation) activity and is affected by canonical poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors.

https://openalex.org/W2163971105,"p-Hydroxyphenylacetate (HPA) 3-hydroxylase from Acinetobacter baumannii consists of a reductase component (C(1)) and an oxygenase component (C(2)). C(1) catalyzes the reduction of FMN by NADH to provide FMNH(-) as a substrate for C(2). The rate of reduction of flavin is enhanced ∼20-fold by binding HPA. The N-terminal domain of C(1) is homologous to other flavin reductases, whereas the C-terminal domain (residues 192-315) is similar to MarR, a repressor protein involved in bacterial antibiotic resistance. In this study, three forms of truncated C(1) variants and single site mutation variants of residues Arg-21, Phe-216, Arg-217, Ile-246, and Arg-247 were constructed to investigate the role of the C-terminal domain in regulating C(1). In the absence of HPA, the C(1) variant in which residues 179-315 were removed (t178C(1)) was reduced by NADH and released FMNH(-) at the same rates as wild-type enzyme carries out these functions in the presence of HPA. In contrast, variants with residues 231-315 removed behaved similarly to the wild-type enzyme. Thus, residues 179-230 are involved in repressing the production of FMNH(-) in the absence of HPA. These results are consistent with the C-terminal domain in the wild-type enzyme being an autoinhibitory domain that upon binding the effector HPA undergoes conformational changes to allow faster flavin reduction and release. Most of the single site variants investigated had catalytic properties similar to those of the wild-type enzyme except for the F216A variant, which had a rate of reduction that was not stimulated by HPA. F216A could be involved with HPA binding or in the required conformational change for stimulation of flavin reduction by HPA."
https://openalex.org/W2145890684,"To collect the ever-increasing yet scattered knowledge on metabolism, multiple pathway databases like the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes have been created. A complete and accurate description of the metabolic network for human and other organisms is essential to foster new biological discoveries. Previous research has shown, however, that the level of agreement among pathway databases is surprisingly low. We investigated whether the lack of consensus among databases can be explained by an inaccurate representation of the knowledge described in scientific literature. As an example, we focus on the well-known tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and evaluated the description of this pathway as found in a comprehensive selection of 10 human metabolic pathway databases. Remarkably, none of the descriptions given by these databases is entirely correct. Moreover, consensus exists on only 3 reactions. Mistakes in pathway databases might lead to the propagation of incorrect knowledge, misinterpretation of high-throughput molecular data, and poorly designed follow-up experiments. We provide an improved description of the TCA cycle via the community-curated database WikiPathways. We review various initiatives that aim to improve the description of the human metabolic network and discuss the importance of the active involvement of biological experts in these."

The silkworm, Bombyx mori L., genome harbors abundant repetitive sequences derived from families of retrotransposons and transposons, which together constitute almost half of the genome space and provide ample resource for biogenesis of the three major small RNA families. We systematically discovered transposable-element (TE)-associated small RNAs in B. mori genome based on a deep RNA-sequencing strategy and the effort yielded 182, 788 and 4,990 TE-associated small RNAs in the miRNA, siRNA and piRNA species, respectively. Our analysis suggested that the three small RNA species preferentially associate with different TEs to create sequence and functional diversity, and we also show evidence that a Bombyx non-LTR retrotransposon, bm1645, alone contributes to the generation of TE-associated small RNAs in a very significant way. The fact that bm1645-associated small RNAs partially overlap with each other implies a possibility that this element may be modulated by different mechanisms to generate different products with diverse functions. Taken together, these discoveries expand the small RNA pool in B. mori genome and lead to new knowledge on the diversity and functional significance of TE-associated small RNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2108272195,"Prions cause fatal neurodegenerative conditions and result from the conversion of host-encoded cellular prion protein (PrPC) into abnormally folded scrapie PrP (PrPSc). Prions can propagate both in neurons and astrocytes, yet neurotoxicity mechanisms remain unclear. Recently, PrPC was proposed to mediate neurotoxic signaling of β-sheet-rich PrP and non-PrP conformers independently of conversion. To investigate the role of astrocytes and neuronal PrPC in prion-induced neurodegeneration, we set up neuron and astrocyte primary cocultures derived from PrP transgenic mice. In this system, prion-infected astrocytes delivered ovine PrPSc to neurons lacking PrPC (prion-resistant), or expressing a PrPC convertible (sheep) or not (mouse, human). We show that interaction between neuronal PrPC and exogenous PrPSc was not sufficient to induce neuronal death but that efficient PrPC conversion was required for prion-associated neurotoxicity. Prion-infected astrocytes markedly accelerated neurodegeneration in homologous cocultures compared to infected single neuronal cultures, despite no detectable neurotoxin release. Finally, PrPSc accumulation in neurons led to neuritic damages and cell death, both potentiated by glutamate and reactive oxygen species. Thus, conversion of neuronal PrPC rather than PrPC-mediated neurotoxic signaling appears as the main culprit in prion-induced neurodegeneration. We suggest that active prion replication in neurons sensitizes them to environmental stress regulated by neighboring cells, including astrocytes.— Cronier, S., Carimalo, J., Schaeffer, B., Jaumain, E., Béringue, V., Miquel, M.-C., Laude, H., Peyrin, J.-M.

The reaction is catalyzed by a 0.8 MDa multienzyme complex, the editosome. Although the binding of substrate pre-edited mRNAs and cognate guide RNAs (gRNAs) represents the first step in the reaction cycle, the biochemical and biophysical details of the editosome/RNA interaction are not understood. Here we show that editosomes bind full-length substrate mRNAs with nanomolar affinity in a nonselective fashion. The complexes do not discriminate-neither kinetically nor thermodynamically-between different mitochondrial pre-mRNAs or between edited and unedited versions of the same transcript. They also bind gRNAs and gRNA/pre-mRNA hybrid RNAs with similar affinities and association rate constants. Gold labeling of editosome-bound RNA in combination with transmission electron microscopy identified a single RNA-binding site per editosome. However, atomic force microscopy of individual pre-mRNA-editosome complexes revealed that multiple editosomes can interact with one pre-mRNA. Lastly, we demonstrate a so far unknown activity of the editing machinery: editosome-bound RNA becomes unfolded by a chaperone-type RNA unwinding activity."

Repair systems have evolved for the reversible modifications, including oxidation and reduction of the sulfur-containing amino acids cysteine and methionine. The latter is relatively readily oxidized to methionine sulfoxide.

In most organisms the S-epimer is reduced by msrA and the R-epimer by msrB, both using thioredoxin as the source of reducing equivalents.

A second structural element is required, and if that element can be modulated then membrane binding of the protein becomes reversible.

Cartridges were stripped with 10 ml of 50% (v/v) CH3CN, 0.1% (v/v) TFA and then washed with 10 ml of 0.1% (v/v) TFA. The sample was loaded onto the column followed by a washing step with 20 ml of 0.1% (v/v) TFA. Elution of the peptides was carried out with 4 ml of 80% (v/v) CH3CN, 0.1% (v/v) TFA. Eluates were dried in a vacuum centrifuge and then redissolved in 200 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6. For reduction of methionine sulfoxide by msrA, 20 nmol of each methionine sulfoxide peptide was dissolved in 200 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 25 mm DTT. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 5 min followed by the addition of 20 pmol of msrA (enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:1000). After 2.0 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 20 μl of 10% (v/v) TFA. 20 μl of the acidified mixture was loaded onto a Zorbax 300 SB-C18 reverse phase column, 2.1 × 50 mm, 3.5 μm (Agilent) connected to an Agilent 1200 Series HPLC system. A linear gradient was applied, starting at 0 min with 100% solvent A (0.1% (v/v) TFA in water), 0% solvent B (0.1% (v/v) TFA in CH3CN), and going to 60% (v/v) solvent B at 45 min. The flow rate was 80 μl/min. The fractional reduction of methionine S-sulfoxide was calculated from the areas of the reduced and the oxidized peaks, integrated using Chemstation (Agilent). All experiments were run in triplicate. Apolipoprotein A-I was kindly provided by Alan Remaley (NHLBI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Two mg of apoA-I was dissolved in 0.1% (v/v) TFA and treated with 0.5% (v/v) H2O2 (163 mm) for 30 min at 30 °C. Removal of hydrogen peroxide was accomplished with a Sep-Pak Classic C18 cartridge as described above. The dried apoA-I was then dissolved in 500 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, with 25 mm DTT. The protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay (8.Bradford M.M. A rapid and sensitive method for the quantitation of microgram quantities of protein utilizing the principle of protein-dye binding.Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216178) Google Scholar). Eight μg of recombinant His-tagged Escherichia coli msrB was added for 4 h at 37 °C to convert the oxidized apoA-I into its S-sulfoxide form. The msrB was removed by a Ni2+ chelate column, and the solution of apoA-I was stored at −20 °C until used. 200 μg of S-sulfoxide apolipoprotein was used for each incubation with msrA. The volume was adjusted to 500 μl with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, with 25 mm DTT. The sample was incubated for 5 min at 37 °C followed by the addition of 0.4 μg of msrA (enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:1000). Aliquots with 20 μg of apoA-I were withdrawn at 0, 2, 5, 10, 15, 25, 30, 45, 60, and 90 min and mixed with 50 μl of 1% (v/v) TFA to stop the reduction. The acidified samples were separated on the same Zorbax column noted above. After isocratic flow with 20% (v/v) solvent B (0.1% (v/v) TFA in CH3CN) for 2 min, a gradient of 2% (v/v) solvent B/min was developed. The areas of the reduced and oxidized peaks were again obtained with the Chemstation integrator as for the peptides. All experiments were run in triplicate. Experiments were conducted at 20 °C using a Beckman Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman, Palo Alto, CA) equipped with a four-hole An Ti-60 rotor and cells with 12-mm double-sector Epon centerpieces and sapphire windows. The sample volume was 0.4 ml. MsrA was dialyzed overnight into 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, with 150 mm NaCl. After thermal equilibrium was reached at rest, the rotor was accelerated to 60,000 rpm. Interference and 280-nm absorbance scans were collected continuously until no further sedimentation boundary movement was observed. The partial specific volume of msrA and buffer density and viscosity were calculated using the SEDNTERP program (9.Laue T.M. Shad B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Sciences. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 90-125Google Scholar). Data analysis was conducted using the c(s) method in the SEDFIT program (10.Lebowitz J. Lewis M.S. Schuck P. Modern analytical ultracentrifugation in protein science: a tutorial review.Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2067-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Menisci positions and frictional ratios were optimized during the fitting procedure, and distributions were regularized using a maximum entropy method and a 0.68 confidence interval. All final fits had a S.D. < 0.01 unit. Myristoylated and nonmyristoylated 13C/15N msrA were studied in a Bruker 800 MHz spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe. Backbone resonance assignment was done by standard techniques using CBCA(CO)NH and HNCACB experiments at 300 K. 15N-edited NOESY spectra (tmix = 100 ms) were measured for structure determination whereas 15N heteronuclear single-quantum correlation (HSQC) spectra were measured for chemical shift perturbation analysis. These were performed with 15N-labeled samples. Backbone dihedral phi and psi restraints were obtained with TALOS (11.Shen Y. Delaglio F. Cornilescu G. Bax A. TALOS+: a hybrid method for predicting protein backbone torsion angles from NMR chemical shifts.J. Biomol. NMR. 2009; 44: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (2012) Google Scholar) from the observed Cα, Cβ, Hα, and N frequencies. We used only dihedrals predicted with high confidence, with ranges equal to twice the TALOS uncertainty. NOE-derived distance restraints were obtained for assigned NOE cross-peaks using peak intensities (heights) normalized by the corresponding diagonal peak intensities. Normalized intensities were converted to distances by calibrating with a subset of nonoverlapped cross-peaks arising from close intra, sequential, and medium range HN-HN and Ha-HN distances in regions of well defined secondary structure. These yielded d(Å) = 2.02*I(−0.226), where d is distance and I is the normalized cross-peak intensity. The observed variation in cross-peak volumes corresponding to particular distances was a factor of 10, so that u(Å) = 2.02 (I/3.162)(−0.226), l(Å) = 2.02 (I × 3.162)(−0.226) where u and l are the upper and lower distance bounds in angstroms. Two hundred structures were generated using the backbone angle and distance restraints with a standard simulated annealing protocol in the XPLOR-NIH program (12.Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J.J. Tjandra N. Clore G.M. The Xplor-NIH NMR molecular structure determination package.J. Magn. Reson. 2003; 160: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar). Floating chirality was employed for diastereotopic methylene and methyl groups (13.Folmer R.H. Hilbers C.W. Konings R.N. Nilges M. Floating stereospecific assignment revisited: application to an 18-kDa protein and comparison with J-coupling data.J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 9: 245-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The myristoyl group definition in the XPLOR topology file was generated using analogous XPLOR peptide, methylene, and methyl parameters. The 20 structures with lowest experimental restraint violations were superimposed, and the cartesian average structure of the ensemble was minimized using MacroModel (Schrödinger, New York) with the OPLS 2005 force field in implicit solvent. Size exclusion chromatography showed that myristoylated msrA eluted distinctly later than nonmyristoylated msrA, consistent with a smaller Stokes radius or nonideal interaction of the hydrophobic myristoyl group with the gel filtration medium (Fig. 1A). Analytical ultracentrifugation revealed identical distributions for both forms with an average sedimentation coefficient (s20,w) of 2.59 ± 0.05 S and an estimated molecular mass of 23.8 kDa (Fig. 1B). Thus, both the myristoylated and nonmyristoylated msrA are monomeric in solution. To probe for effects of myristoylation on secondary structure or conformational dynamics, we examined the tryptophan fluorescence and thermal stability of the two forms of msrA. The tryptophan fluorescence emission spectra were identical, indicating that myristoylation has no effect on the local environments of the three tryptophans in msrA (Fig. 1C). In contrast to the stabilizing effect of myristoylation on protein kinase A (14.Zheng J. Knighton D.R. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Ten Eyck L.F. Crystal structures of the myristylated catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase reveal open and closed conformations.Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1559-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), lipidation decreased the thermal stability of msrA (Fig. 1D), suggesting that the myristoyl group in msrA is not bound in a deep hydrophobic pocket as it is in protein kinase A. We previously established that the kinetic constants for reduction of free methionine sulfoxide were not altered by myristoylation (6.Kim G. Cole N.B. Lim J.C. Zhao H. Levine R.L. Dual sites of protein initiation control the localization and myristoylation of methionine sulfoxide reductase A.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 18085-18094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It was also demonstrated that the rate of reduction of peptides by nonmyristoylated msrA varied with the sequence near the methionine sulfoxide residue (15.Ghesquiere B. Jonckheere V. Colaert N. Van Durme J. Timmerman E. Goethals M. Schymkowitz J. Rousseau F. Vandekerckhove J. Gevaert K. Redox proteomics of protein-bound methionine oxidation.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2011; 10 (M110.006866)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We therefore determined the rates of reduction of peptides with various sequences by myristoylated and nonmyristoylated msrA. One set of peptides had the identical sequence except for the residue preceding the methionine sulfoxide. Another set of peptides had sequences predicted to enhance reduction (15.Ghesquiere B. Jonckheere V. Colaert N. Van Durme J. Timmerman E. Goethals M. Schymkowitz J. Rousseau F. Vandekerckhove J. Gevaert K. Redox proteomics of protein-bound methionine oxidation.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2011; 10 (M110.006866)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Although we observed considerable differences in rate among the peptides, myristoylation did not affect the rates (Fig. 2). Assignments of resonances were made for 98% of the backbone of both the nonmyristoylated and myristoylated 13C/15N-labeled msrA. NMR resonances for the amino-terminal amine are typically not observed for most proteins due to very fast solvent exchange. However, myristoylation converts the amine to an amide, which has slower solvent exchange. Thus, signals from the first residue, Gly-22, were observed from myristoylated msrA (Fig. 3A), as also reported for myristoylated ARF1 (16.Liu Y. Kahn R.A. Prestegard J.H. Structure and membrane interaction of myristoylated ARF1.Structure. 2009; 17: 79-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In the CBCACONH spectrum, weak signals for the myristoyl C2 (38.0 ppm) and C3 (28.0 ppm) carbon resonances were detected via the Gly-22 amide. A weak peak corresponding to the degenerate resonances of the myristoyl C4–C11 methylene groups was observed in the 13C HSQC with a 1H frequency 1.15 ppm and 13C frequency 31.9 ppm (supplemental Fig. S1) (17.Ames J.B. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Stryer L. Nuclear magnetic resonance evidence for Ca2+-induced extrusion of the myristoyl group of recoverin.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30909-30913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Peaks for C12–C14 were too weak to be detected. The backbone amide frequencies of the two forms of msrA were compared (Fig. 3B), revealing large chemical shift perturbations for residues 24–28. Thus, myristoylation causes a major structural change at the amino terminus. Smaller perturbations (<0.25 ppm) were seen for Gly-96, Gln-143, Ala-158, and Asp-192, suggesting that they lie near the myristoyl group or that their environments are indirectly altered by myristoylation (Fig. 3B). A comparison of 13C Cα and Cβ frequencies also showed significant differences for residues 24–28. Those frequencies indicate a helical structure for the myristoylated form. No significant changes in Cα and Cβ frequencies were observed beyond the seventh residue from the amino terminus (Val-28). The 15N NOESY spectra of myristoylated and nonmyristoylated msrA were compared, examining the through-space, proton NOE signals to backbone, and side chain 15N-attached protons. This comparison confirmed that there were no structural changes due to myristoylation. It also revealed 11 NOE signals for the myristoylated form not present in the spectrum of the nonmyristoylated form. Their frequencies were consistent with myristoyl resonances. Four of these signals were to the backbone amide of Gly-22 and are consistent with the reported C2 and C3 methylene group proton frequencies (17.Ames J.B. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Stryer L. Nuclear magnetic resonance evidence for Ca2+-induced extrusion of the myristoyl group of recoverin.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30909-30913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). NOE signals with the same proton frequency as the presumed C4–C11 methylene peak in the 13C HSQC spectrum were seen to the backbone amides of Ile-29, Gly-112, and Gly-144 and to the side chain Hϵ protons of Arg-156 and Arg-194. Two of the additional NOE signals had a proton frequency of 0.81 ppm, corresponding to the reported myristoyl C14 methyl 1H resonance (17.Ames J.B. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Stryer L. Nuclear magnetic resonance evidence for Ca2+-induced extrusion of the myristoyl group of recoverin.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30909-30913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S2). Unlike the 13C HSQC, the cross-peaks in the NOESY spectrum depend only on proton abundance, so that the C14 methyl proton resonance is observable. The NOE spectra of both forms were also compared with a table of close (<5 Å) proton-proton distances generated from a homology model using the bovine nonmyristoylated msrA (18.Lowther W.T. Brot N. Weissbach H. Matthews B.W. Structure and mechanism of peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase, an “anti-oxidation” enzyme.Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13307-13312Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). No differences with the x-ray structure were seen for either form of mouse msrA, except for a minor difference in the turn region near Thr-162 which could be due to homology model generation. The three-dimensional structure of myristoylated msrA was determined using 2121 distance restraints from the 15N NOESY experiment and 349 backbone dihedral angles predicted using TALOS (11.Shen Y. Delaglio F. Cornilescu G. Bax A. TALOS+: a hybrid method for predicting protein backbone torsion angles from NMR chemical shifts.J. Biomol. NMR. 2009; 44: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (2012) Google Scholar). The 20 lowest penalty structures had a backbone r.m.s.d. from average of 1.3 Å for residues 22–233 (Table 1). The ensemble and the minimized average structure are shown in Fig. 4, A and B. The central β-sheet (strands 1–3 and 6–8) was most precisely determined, with an average backbone r.m.s.d. from an average of 0.5 Å. Residues following Val-225 lack long range NOE signals and become progressively more disordered toward the carboxyl terminus. A solution structure determination of the nonmyristoylated form was not performed because of the near complete agreement between observed NOE signals and those predicted from the x-ray structure of nonmyristoylated msrA.TABLE 1NMR structural parametersParameters20 lowest energy conformers (r.m.s.d.)Minimized average of 20 lowest conformers (r.m.s.d.)Restraints NOE distance, Å (2121)0.0260.027 Dihedrals, degrees (349)1.31.0Idealized geometry Bonds, Å0.00630.0067 Angles, degrees0.640.64 Impropers, degrees0.550.53Ramachandran plot Most favored regions65%80% Additionally allowed regions31%18%Coordinate precision BackboneaValue for all residues; the value for residues 8–204 is in parentheses., Å1.32 (1.01) All heavy atomsaValue for all residues; the value for residues 8–204 is in parentheses., Å1.68 (1.37)a Value for all residues; the value for residues 8–204 is in parentheses. Open table in a new tab The myristoyl group lies extended in a shallow pocket at the msrA surface, adjacent to the residues with the largest chemical shift perturbations (Fig. 3B). The backbone for amino-terminal residues 24–27 adopts a helical structure on average. In contrast to that observed in protein kinase A (14.Zheng J. Knighton D.R. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Ten Eyck L.F. Crystal structures of the myristylated catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase reveal open and closed conformations.Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1559-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), the myristoyl pocket is not particularly hydrophobic. Residues contacted by the myristoyl group include Lys-27, Val-28, Ile-29, Gly-96, His-97, Gly-112, Ala-114, Gly-144, Met-145, Thr-153, Arg-156, Thr-190, Asp-192, and Arg-194 (Fig. 4C). The myristoyl group is >14 Å away from the active site Cys-72 (Fig. 4B). As a consequence, the active site backbone resonances were only slightly perturbed by myristoylation (<0.05 ppm). The minimized average structure from the NMR ensemble aligns with the x-ray structure of bovine msrA with a backbone pairwise r.m.s.d. of 1.3 Å for residues 29–228. Residues in the amino-terminal region before Val-29 and in the carboxyl-terminal region past Pro-228 were not observed in the x-ray structure. The regions where the average NMR structure differs most from the x-ray structure are not near the myristoyl group, centering instead at Arg-38 and Cys-217. These regions had fewer distance restraints than average, so it is unclear whether these regions truly differ from the x-ray structure. For residues 29–228, the pairwise r.m.s.d. values of structures within the NMR ensemble range from 1.4 Å to 1.8 Å, while compared with the x-ray structure they range from 1.4 Å to 1.9 Å, indicating that the x-ray structure lies within the precision of the NMR structure ensemble. As developed under “Discussion,” the structure of the myristate binding site suggests that it may enhance protein-protein interaction and speed the reduction of methionine sulfoxide in the interacting protein. We tested this hypothesis with apolipoprotein A-I, the major protein in high density lipoprotein (HDL). Its methionine residues are sensitive to oxidation, the oxidized form is known to be present in vivo (19.Pankhurst G. Wang X.L. Wilcken D.E. Baernthaler G. Panzenböck U. Raftery M. Stocker R. Characterization of specifically oxidized apolipoproteins in mildly oxidized high density lipoprotein.J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 349-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and methionine oxidation induces conformational changes in the protein (20.Wong Y.Q. Binger K.J. Howlett G.J. Griffin M.D. Methionine oxidation induces amyloid fibril formation by full-length apolipoprotein A-I.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 1977-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Because msrA specifically reduces only S-methionine sulfoxide, we prepared apolipoprotein A-I with only that epimer as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 5 shows that myristoylated msrA reduced the methionine sulfoxides in apolipoprotein A-I four times faster than nonmyristoylated msrA. Myristoylation is required for membrane binding of certain proteins, but it is not sufficient to direct them to the membrane (7.Resh M.D. Fatty acylation of proteins: new insights into membrane targeting of myristoylated and palmitoylated proteins.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar, 21.Resh M.D. Trafficking and signaling by fatty-acylated and prenylated proteins.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 584-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). A second structural element is required, and if that element can be modulated then membrane binding of the protein becomes reversible: the “myristoyl switch.” Two second elements that can join with myristoylation to direct membrane binding are palmitoylation and a cluster of basic residues, but msrA has neither element. Myristoylated msrA has only been found in the cytosol of the tissues and cells examined to date, and various treatments failed to promote translocation to a membrane (6.Kim G. Cole N.B. Lim J.C. Zhao H. Levine R.L. Dual sites of protein initiation control the localization and myristoylation of methionine sulfoxide reductase A.J. Biol.

Physiol. 2011; 301: H1513-H1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The NMR spectra established that the overall structure of mouse myristyolated msrA is nearly the same as the nonmyristolyated form. The NMR solution structure of myristoylated msrA and the previously solved x-ray structure of bovine nonmyristoylated msrA are also quite similar (backbone r.m.s.d. of 1.3 Å). The only significant difference is in the amino-terminal residues, which are in a flexible random coil in the nonmyristoylated form and adopt a more helical conformation in the myristoylated form. The solution structure shows the myristoyl group interacting with a shallow pocket at the protein surface which is near the amino terminus but well removed from the active site. We refer to this site as the “myristoyl nest.” Comparison of the structure of myristoylated msrA with that of other myristoylated proteins revealed no similar binding sites. MsrA lacks a deep hydrophobic cavity into which the myristoyl group can be inserted reversibly, the myristoyl switch (7.Resh M.D. Fatty acylation of proteins: new insights into membrane targeting of myristoylated and palmitoylated proteins.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). These deep hydrophobic cavities are found in the HIV matrix protein which has an entropic switch (25.Tang C. Loeliger E. Luncsford P. Kinde I. Beckett D. Summers M.F. Entropic switch regulates myristate exposure in the HIV-1 matrix protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Chem. 1995; 270: 30909-30913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), the Src kinase c-Abl which has a phosphotyrosine switch, and protein kinase A (14.Zheng J. Knighton D.R. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Ten Eyck L.F. Crystal structures of the myristylated catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase reveal open and closed conformations.Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1559-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), which may have a phosphoserine switch (26.Gaffarogullari E.C. Masterson L.R. Metcalfe E.E. Traaseth N.J. Balatri E. Musa M.M. Mullen D. Distefano M.D. Veglia G. A myristoyl/phosphoserine switch controls cAMP-dependent protein kinase association to membranes.J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 411: 823-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The HIV Nef protein is found both bound to membranes and in the cytosol, and its amino-terminal region is unstructured whether myristoylated or not (27.Morgan C.R. Miglionico B.V. Engen J.R. Effects of HIV-1 Nef on human N-myristoyltransferase 1.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 3394-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). MsrA shares some similarities with myristoylated GDP-bound ARF1. Its myristoyl group is in a shallow pocket at the protein surface, and its amino-terminal residues also have a helical propensity (16.Liu Y. Kahn R.A. Prestegard J.H. Structure and membrane interaction of myristoylated ARF1.Structure. 2009; 17: 79-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 28.Losonczi J.A. Prestegard J.H.

Chem. 2001; 276: 42477-42484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, the pocket in ARF1 is significantly more hydrophobic than the myristoyl nest in msrA. The less hydrophobic, shallow nest provides significant surface exposure of the myristoyl group in msrA. This characteristic, the lack of any known myristoyl switch, and the cytosolic location of myristoylated msrA lead us to suggest that the myristoyl nest serves as a docking site for protein-protein interaction. Methionine sulfoxide is distinctly more hydrophilic than is methionine. Yet oxidation of a methionine residue within a protein generally renders that protein more hydrophobic (30.Levine R.L. Mosoni L. Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. Methionine residues as endogenous antioxidants in proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 15036-15040Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar), presumably because the sulfoxide perturbs folding and exposes hydrophobic patches that are normally buried. Those patches may dock at the myristoyl nest on msrA, after which the methionine sulfoxide can be reduced back to methionine by msrA. Whereas the rate of reduction of methionine sulfoxide in unstructured peptides was unaffected by myristoylation, the rate of reduction in apoliprotein A-I was faster with myristoylated msrA, providing experimental support for the proposal that the myristoyl nest structure enhances protein-protein interaction.

Bucket bridging has been used to explain the spread of information in a chain of members including three testable concepts: first, linearity assumes that individual ""agent bees"" that participate in the wave will be affected preferentially from the side of wave origin. The directed-trigger hypothesis addresses the coincidence of the individual property of trigger direction with the collective property of wave direction. Second, continuity describes the transfer of information without being stopped, delayed or re-routed. The active-neighbours hypothesis assumes coincidence between the direction of the majority of shimmering-active neighbours and the trigger direction of the agents. Third, the graduality hypothesis refers to the interaction between an agent and her active neighbours, assuming a proportional relationship in the strength of abdomen flipping of the agent and her previously active neighbours. Shimmering waves provoked by dummy wasps were recorded with high-resolution video cameras. Individual bees were identified by 3D-image analysis, and their strength of abdominal flipping was assessed by pixel-based luminance changes in sequential frames. For each agent, the directedness of wave propagation was based on wave direction, trigger direction, and the direction of the majority of shimmering-active neighbours. The data supported the bucket bridging hypothesis, but only for a small proportion of agents: linearity was confirmed for 2.5%, continuity for 11.3% and graduality for 0.4% of surface bees (but in 2.6% of those agents with high wave-strength levels). The complimentary part of 90% of surface bees did not conform to bucket bridging. This fuzziness is discussed in terms of self-organisation and evolutionary adaptedness in Giant honeybee colonies to respond to rapidly changing threats such as predatory wasps scanning in front of the nest."
https://openalex.org/W2002478766,"In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the stress-activated Sty1 MAPK pathway is essential for cell survival under stress conditions. The Sty1 MAPK regulates Atf1 transcription factor to elicit stress responses in extreme conditions of osmolarity and reactive oxygen species-generating agents such as hydrogen peroxide, heat, low glucose, and heavy metal. Herein, using a newly developed Renilla luciferase reporter assay with enhanced detection sensitivity and accuracy, we show that distinct signaling pathways respond to cadmium and other reactive oxygen species-generating agents for the activation of Atf1. Also, surprisingly, a measurable activation of Atf1 transcription factor was still observed devoid of Sty1 MAPK activity. Further genetic and biological analyses revealed that the residual activation is caused by the activation of the cell wall integrity Pmk1 MAPK pathway and a redox-mediated activation of Atf1.Background: Activation of Atf1 is regulated by the Sty1 MAPK under multiple stresses, and the Pmk1 MAPK is also suggested to regulate the activity of Atf1.Results: We obtained a measurable activation of Atf1 in Δsty1Δpmk1 cells.Conclusion: Activation of Atf1 is not fully dependent on Sty1 and Pmk1.Significance: The Renilla reporter assay identified a Sty1-independent activation of Atf1.

https://openalex.org/W2031708615,"Recent advances in the study of flocking behavior have permitted more sophisticated analyses than previously possible. The concepts of ""topological distances"" and ""scale-free correlations"" are important developments that have contributed to this improvement. These concepts require us to reconsider the notion of a neighborhood when applied to theoretical models. Previous work has assumed that individuals interact with neighbors within a certain radius (called the ""metric distance""). However, other work has shown that, assuming topological interactions, starlings interact on average with the six or seven nearest neighbors within a flock. Accounting for this observation, we previously proposed a metric-topological interaction model in two dimensions. The goal of our model was to unite these two interaction components, the metric distance and the topological distance, into one rule. In our previous study, we demonstrated that the metric-topological interaction model could explain a real bird flocking phenomenon called scale-free correlation, which was first reported by Cavagna et al. In this study, we extended our model to three dimensions while also accounting for variations in speed. This three-dimensional metric-topological interaction model displayed scale-free correlation for velocity and orientation. Finally, we introduced an additional new feature of the model, namely, that a flock can store and release its fluctuations."
https://openalex.org/W2037894624,"Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) is strictly a human intracellular pathogen. It causes acute systemic (typhoid fever) and chronic infections that result in long-term asymptomatic human carriage. S. Typhi displays diverse disease manifestations in human infection and exhibits high clonality. The principal factors underlying the unique lifestyle of S. Typhi in its human host during acute and chronic infections remain largely unknown and are therefore the main objective of this study.To obtain insight into the intracellular lifestyle of S. Typhi, a high-throughput phenotypic microarray was employed to characterise the catabolic capacity of 190 carbon sources in S. Typhi strains. The success of this study lies in the carefully selected library of S. Typhi strains, including strains from two geographically distinct areas of typhoid endemicity, an asymptomatic human carrier, clinical stools and blood samples and sewage-contaminated rivers. An extremely low carbon catabolic capacity (27% of 190 carbon substrates) was observed among the strains. The carbon catabolic profiles appeared to suggest that S. Typhi strains survived well on carbon subtrates that are found abundantly in the human body but not in others. The strains could not utilise plant-associated carbon substrates. In addition, α-glycerolphosphate, glycerol, L-serine, pyruvate and lactate served as better carbon sources to monosaccharides in the S. Typhi strains tested.The carbon catabolic profiles suggest that S. Typhi could survive and persist well in the nutrient depleted metabolic niches in the human host but not in the environment outside of the host. These findings serve as caveats for future studies to understand how carbon catabolism relates to the pathogenesis and transmission of this pathogen."

We morphed images of participants' faces with attractive and unattractive references. With access to a mirror, participants selected the morphed image they perceived as depicting their face. Participants who engaged in upward comparison with relevant attractive targets selected a less attractive morph compared to participants exposed to control images (Study 1). After downward comparison with relevant unattractive targets compared to control images, participants selected a more attractive morph (Study 2). Biased representations were not the products of cognitive accessibility of beauty constructs; comparisons did not influence representations of strangers' faces (Study 3). We discuss implications for vision, social comparison, and body image."
https://openalex.org/W2038917939,"Presenilins (PSENs) form the catalytic component of the γ-secretase complex, responsible for intramembrane proteolysis of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Notch, among many other membrane proteins. Previously, we identified a PSEN1-binding domain in APP, encompassing half of the transmembrane domain following the amyloid β (Aβ) sequence. Based on this, we designed peptides mimicking this interaction domain with the aim to selectively block APP processing and Aβ generation through interfering with enzyme-substrate binding. We identified a peptide sequence that, when fused to a virally derived translocation peptide, significantly lowered Aβ production (IC50: 317 nM) in cell-free and cell-based assays using APP-carboxy terminal fragment as a direct γ-secretase substrate. Being derived from the APP sequence, this inhibitory peptide did not affect NotchΔE γ-cleavage, illustrating specificity and potential therapeutic value. In cell-based assays, the peptide strongly suppressed APP shedding, demonstrating that it exerts the inhibitory effect already upstream of γ-secretase, most likely through steric hindrance.—Esselens, C., Sannerud, R., Gallardo, R., Baert, V., Kaden, D., Serneels, L., De Strooper, B., Rousseau, F., Multhaup, G., Schymkowitz, J., Langedijk, J.

https://openalex.org/W2044222096,"Background The importance of membrane compartmentalization into specific membrane microdomains has been shown in many biological processes such as immunoreceptor signaling, membrane trafficking, pathogen infection, and tumor progression. Microdomains like lipid rafts, caveolae and tetraspanin enriched microdomains are relatively resistant to solubilization by some detergents. Large detergent-resistant membrane fragments (DRMs) resulting from such membrane solubilization can be conveniently isolated by density gradient ultracentrifugation or gel filtration. Recently, we described a novel type of raft-like membrane microdomains producing, upon detergent Brij98 solubilization, “heavy DRMs” and containing a number of functionally relevant proteins. Transmembrane adaptor protein LAX is a typical “heavy raft” protein. The present study was designed to identify the molecular determinants targeting LAX-derived constructs to heavy rafts. Methodology/Principal Findings We prepared several constructs encoding chimeric proteins containing various informative segments of the LAX sequence and evaluated their effects on targeting to heavy rafts. Replacement of the polybasic membrane-proximal part of LAX by CD3ε-derived membrane-proximal part had no effect on LAX solubilization. Similarly, the membrane-proximal part of LAX, when introduced into non-raft protein CD25 did not change CD25 detergent solubility. These results indicated that membrane-proximal part of LAX is not important for LAX targeting to heavy rafts. On the other hand, the replacement of transmembrane part of CD25 by the transmembrane part of LAX resulted in targeting into heavy rafts. We also show that LAX is not S-acylated, thus palmitoylation is not involved in LAX targeting to heavy rafts. Also, covalent dimerization was excluded as a cause of targeting into heavy rafts. Conclusions/Significance We identified the transmembrane domain of LAX as a first motif targeting transmembrane protein constructs to detergent-resistant heavy rafts, a novel type of membrane microdomains containing a number of physiologically important proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2048951143,"Background The microaerophilic bacterium Azorhizobium caulinodans, when fixing N2 both in pure cultures held at 20 µM dissolved O2 tension and as endosymbiont of Sesbania rostrata legume nodules, employs a novel, respiratory-membrane endo-hydrogenase to oxidize and recycle endogenous H2 produced by soluble Mo-dinitrogenase activity at the expense of O2. Methods and Findings From a bioinformatic analysis, this endo-hydrogenase is a core (6 subunit) version of (14 subunit) NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (respiratory complex I). In pure A. caulinodans liquid cultures, when O2 levels are lowered to <1 µM dissolved O2 tension (true microaerobic physiology), in vivo endo-hydrogenase activity reverses and continuously evolves H2 at high rates. In essence, H+ ions then supplement scarce O2 as respiratory-membrane electron acceptor. Paradoxically, from thermodynamic considerations, such hydrogenic respiratory-membrane electron transfer need largely uncouple oxidative phosphorylation, required for growth of non-phototrophic aerobic bacteria, A. caulinodans included. Conclusions A. caulinodans in vivo endo-hydrogenase catalytic activity is bidirectional. To our knowledge, this study is the first demonstration of hydrogenic respiratory-membrane electron transfer among aerobic (non-fermentative) bacteria. When compared with O2 tolerant hydrogenases in other organisms, A. caulinodans in vivo endo-hydrogenase mediated H2 production rates (50,000 pmol 109·cells−1 min−1) are at least one-thousandfold higher. Conceivably, A. caulinodans respiratory-membrane hydrogenesis might initiate H2 crossfeeding among spatially organized bacterial populations whose individual cells adopt distinct metabolic states in response to variant O2 availability. Such organized, physiologically heterogeneous cell populations might benefit from augmented energy transduction and growth rates of the populations, considered as a whole."
