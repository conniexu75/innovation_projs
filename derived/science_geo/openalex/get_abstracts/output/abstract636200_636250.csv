However, poker games usually include six players—a much trickier challenge for artificial intelligence than the two-player variant. Brown and Sandholm developed a program, dubbed Pluribus, that learned how to play six-player no-limit Texas hold'em by playing against five copies of itself (see the Perspective by Blair and Saffidine). When pitted against five elite professional poker players, or with five copies of Pluribus playing against one professional, the computer performed significantly better than humans over the course of 10,000 hands of poker.

The nucleus contains several non–membrane-bound subcompartments forming liquid-like condensates. The largest of these is the nucleolus, the site of ribosome biogenesis. Frottin et al. found that metastable nuclear proteins that misfold upon heat stress enter the nucleolus. In the nucleolus, they avoid irreversible aggregation and remain competent for heat shock protein 70–dependent refolding upon recovery from stress. Prolonged stress or the uptake of proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases prevented this reversibility. Thus, the properties of a phase-separated compartment can assist in protein quality control. Science , this issue p. 342"

Using directed evolution, Abudayyeh et al. demonstrated that the ADAR2 deaminase domain can be relaxed to accept other bases. This resulted in cytidine deamination activity, expanding the RNA editing toolbox for C-to-U conversion. This system, referred to as RNA Editing for Specific C-to-U Exchange (RESCUE), can edit on endogenous transcripts and enable modulation of posttranslational protein modification such as phosphorylation.

https://openalex.org/W2958452288,"Artificial muscles may accelerate the development of robotics, haptics, and prosthetics. Although advances in polymer-based actuators have delivered unprecedented strengths, producing these devices at scale with tunable dimensions remains a challenge. We applied a high-throughput iterative fiber-drawing technique to create strain-programmable artificial muscles with dimensions spanning three orders of magnitude. These fiber-based actuators are thermally and optically controllable, can lift more than 650 times their own weight, and withstand strains of >1000%. Integration of conductive nanowire meshes within these fiber-based muscles offers piezoresistive strain feedback and demonstrates long-term resilience across >105 deformation cycles. The scalable dimensions of these fiber-based actuators and their strength and responsiveness may extend their impact from engineering fields to biomedical applications."

Host and microbial effects of microbiota-directed complementary food (MDCF) prototypes targeting weaning-phase bacterial taxa underrepresented in SAM and MAM microbiota were characterized in gnotobiotic mice and gnotobiotic piglets colonized with age- and growth-discriminatory bacteria. A randomized, double-blind controlled feeding study identified a lead MDCF that changes the abundances of targeted bacteria and increases plasma biomarkers and mediators of growth, bone formation, neurodevelopment, and immune function in children with MAM."
https://openalex.org/W2957969985,"Chimeric antigen receptor-T cell (CAR-T) therapy has been effective in the treatment of hematologic malignancies, but it has shown limited efficacy against solid tumors. Here we demonstrate an approach to enhancing CAR-T function in solid tumors by directly vaccine-boosting donor cells through their chimeric receptor in vivo. We designed amphiphile CAR-T ligands (amph-ligands) that, upon injection, trafficked to lymph nodes and decorated the surfaces of antigen-presenting cells, thereby priming CAR-Ts in the native lymph node microenvironment. Amph-ligand boosting triggered massive CAR-T expansion, increased donor cell polyfunctionality, and enhanced antitumor efficacy in multiple immunocompetent mouse tumor models. We demonstrate two approaches to generalizing this strategy to any chimeric antigen receptor, enabling this simple non-human leukocyte antigen-restricted approach to enhanced CAR-T functionality to be applied to existing CAR-T designs."
https://openalex.org/W2961309955,"Although guest-filled carbon nanotube yarns provide record performance as torsional and tensile artificial muscles, they are expensive, and only part of the muscle effectively contributes to actuation. We describe a muscle type that provides higher performance, in which the guest that drives actuation is a sheath on a twisted or coiled core that can be an inexpensive yarn. This change from guest-filled to sheath-run artificial muscles increases the maximum work capacity by factors of 1.70 to 2.15 for tensile muscles driven electrothermally or by vapor absorption. A sheath-run electrochemical muscle generates 1.98 watts per gram of average contractile power-40 times that for human muscle and 9.0 times that of the highest power alternative electrochemical muscle. Theory predicts the observed performance advantages of sheath-run muscles."
https://openalex.org/W2961049121,"Classic rotating engines are powerful and broadly used but are of complex design and difficult to miniaturize. It has long remained challenging to make large-stroke, high-speed, high-energy microengines that are simple and robust. We show that torsionally stiffened shape memory nanocomposite fibers can be transformed upon insertion of twist to store and provide fast and high-energy rotations. The twisted shape memory nanocomposite fibers combine high torque with large angles of rotation, delivering a gravimetric work capacity that is 60 times higher than that of natural skeletal muscles. The temperature that triggers fiber rotation can be tuned. This temperature memory effect provides an additional advantage over conventional engines by allowing for the tunability of the operation temperature and a stepwise release of stored energy."
https://openalex.org/W2961079136,"Characterizing the organization of the human gut microbiota is a formidable challenge given the number of possible interactions between its components. Using a statistical approach initially applied to financial markets, we measured temporally conserved covariance among bacterial taxa in the microbiota of healthy members of a Bangladeshi birth cohort sampled from 1 to 60 months of age. The results revealed an “ecogroup” of 15 covarying bacterial taxa that provide a concise description of microbiota development in healthy children from this and other low-income countries, and a means for monitoring community repair in undernourished children treated with therapeutic foods. Features of ecogroup population dynamics were recapitulated in gnotobiotic piglets as they transitioned from exclusive milk feeding to a fully weaned state consuming a representative Bangladeshi diet."
https://openalex.org/W2958153153,"Genome-wide analysis of 67 ancient Near Eastern cattle, Bos taurus, remains reveals regional variation that has since been obscured by admixture in modern populations. Comparisons of genomes of early domestic cattle to their aurochs progenitors identify diverse origins with separate introgressions of wild stock. A later region-wide Bronze Age shift indicates rapid and widespread introgression of zebu, Bos indicus, from the Indus Valley. This process was likely stimulated at the onset of the current geological age, ~4.2 thousand years ago, by a widespread multicentury drought. In contrast to genome-wide admixture, mitochondrial DNA stasis supports that this introgression was male-driven, suggesting that selection of arid-adapted zebu bulls enhanced herd survival. This human-mediated migration of zebu-derived genetics has continued through millennia, altering tropical herding on each continent."
https://openalex.org/W2962030455,"A topographic representation of local space is critical for navigation and spatial memory. In humans, topographic spatial learning relies upon the parahippocampal cortex, damage to which renders patients unable to navigate their surroundings or develop new spatial representations. Stable spatial signals have not yet been observed in its rat homolog, the postrhinal cortex. We recorded from single neurons in the rat postrhinal cortex whose firing reflects an animal’s egocentric relationship to the geometric center of the local environment, as well as the animal’s head direction in an allocentric reference frame. Combining these firing correlates revealed a population code for a stable topographic map of local space. This may form the basis for higher-order spatial maps such as those seen in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2957116182,"A key goal of precision medicine is predicting the best drug therapy for a specific patient from genomic information. In oncology, cancers that appear similar pathologically can vary greatly in how they respond to the same drug. Fortunately, data from high-throughput screening programs often reveal important relationships between genomic variability of cancer cells and their response to drugs. Nevertheless, many current computational methods to predict compound activity against cancer cells require large quantities of genomic, epigenomic, and additional cellular data to develop and to apply. Here we integrate recent screening data and machine learning to train classification models that predict the activity/inactivity of compounds against cancer cells based on the mutational status of only 145 oncogenes and a set of compound structural descriptors. Using IC50 values of 1 μM as activity cutoffs, our predictive models have sensitivities of 87%, specificities of 87%, and yield an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve equal to 0.94. We also develop regression models to predict log(IC50) values of compounds for cancer cells; the models achieve a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.86 for cross-validation and up to 0.65–0.73 against blind test sets. Predictive performance remains strong when as few as 50 oncogenes are included. Finally, even when 40% of experimental IC50 values are missing from screening data, they can be imputed with sufficient reliability that classification accuracy is not diminished. The presented models are fast to generate and may serve as easily implemented screening tools for personalized oncology medicine, drug repurposing, and drug discovery."

Despite a large body of work on stimulus categorization at the behavioral and cognitive levels, little is known about the underlying mechanisms at the neuronal level. Here, combining mouse auditory psychophysical behavior and in vivo two-photon imaging from the auditory cortex, we investigate how sensory-to-category transformation is implemented by cortical neurons during a stimulus categorization task. Distinct from responses during passive listening, many neurons exhibited emergent selectivity to stimuli near the category boundary during task performance, reshaping local tuning maps; other neurons became more selective to category membership of stimuli. At the population level, local cortical ensembles robustly encode category information and predict trial-by-trial decisions during task performance.

During categorization, the brain transforms continuous sensory information into discrete classes, a computational process that represents the critical intermediate steps between sensory input and motor output during decision-making (Freedman and Assad, 2011Freedman D.J.

Corticostriatal neurons in auditory cortex drive decisions during auditory discrimination.Nature. 2013; 497: 482-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Here, we sought to understand whether and how sensory information is transformed into behaviorally relevant categories in the primary sensory cortex at the single-neuron and population levels. Using mice performing an auditory categorization task and employing in vivo two-photon functional imaging from layer 2/3 (L2/3) of the auditory cortex, we found that neuronal ensembles are dynamically reorganized during a categorization task, reflecting implementation of a cortical computation underlying sensory-to-category transformation during perceptual decision-making. To probe how the brain maps continuous sensory information to behaviorally relevant categories, we developed an auditory psychophysics task in head-fixed mice based on a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) paradigm (Guo et al., 2014Guo Z.V. Hires S.A. Li N. O’Connor D.H. Komiyama T. Ophir E. Huber D. Bonardi C. Morandell K.

Corticostriatal neurons in auditory cortex drive decisions during auditory discrimination.Nature. 2013; 497: 482-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Head fixation allows reliable and precise stimulus delivery as well as cellular-resolution two-photon imaging during task performance. Mice were first trained to discriminate two exemplar tones (low and high; e.g., 8 and 32 kHz) by directional licking to left and right lick ports (Figure 1A). After reaching a stable performance level (>85% correct; Figure 1C), the intermediate frequencies were introduced (Figure 1B). Psychometric functions were constructed based on the probability of choosing right lick port as a function of tone frequencies (logarithmically scaled in octave), which represent mice’s decisions on categorizing tones as high- or low-frequency categories. The hallmark of categorization is a sharp change in choice proportions upon continuously varying stimulus parameters (Freedman and Assad, 2006Freedman D.J. Assad J.A. Experience-dependent representation of visual categories in parietal cortex.Nature. 2006; 443: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, Freedman et al., 2001Freedman D.J. Riesenhuber M.

Here, we first examined whether mice show categorical responses to tone frequencies by presenting intermediate frequencies in “probe” trials (STAR Methods). We found that mice exhibited a sharp change in choice proportions near the midpoint of the tested frequency range (Figures 1B, 1D, and 1E; see also Figure S1A), indicating that mice are capable of making categorical judgments on basic acoustic stimuli.

Here, we first examined whether the primary auditory cortex was involved in our behavioral task. We performed reversible inactivation by bilateral injection of muscimol (a GABAA receptor agonist) in the primary auditory cortex and found that mice’s discrimination for the exemplar tones was significantly impaired (Figure 1F). This result is consistent with previous studies that also used muscimol silencing of bilateral auditory cortex to assess the requirement of auditory cortex in task performance (Jaramillo and Zador, 2011Jaramillo S.

Froemke R.C. Parallel processing by cortical inhibition enables context-dependent behavior.Nat. Neurosci. 2017; 20: 62-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In addition, we expressed hM4D, a designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drug (DREADD) (Armbruster et al., 2007Armbruster B.N. Li X. Pausch M.H. Herlitze S. Roth B.L. Evolving the lock to fit the key to create a family of G protein-coupled receptors potently activated by an inert ligand.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 5163-5168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar), in bilateral primary auditory cortex of Emx1-IRES-Cre mice using adeno-associated virus (AAV). Intraperitoneal injection of clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) significantly impaired task performance in hM4D expressing mice, but not in control mice (Figure 1G). These results suggest that the mouse primary auditory cortex may contribute to our frequency categorization task. To examine how neuronal activity in auditory cortex may contribute to stimulus categorization, we performed in vivo two-photon calcium imaging from L2/3 neuronal populations. We expressed a genetically encoded calcium indicator, GCaMP6s (Chen et al., 2013Chen T.-W. Wardill T.J. Sun Y. Pulver S.R. Renninger S.L. Baohan A. Schreiter E.R. Kerr R.A. Orger M.B. Jayaraman V. et al.Ultrasensitive fluorescent proteins for imaging neuronal activity.Nature. 2013; 499: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (3647) Google Scholar), in mouse auditory cortex using AAV vector and implanted a chronic imaging window (Figures 2A and 2B ; STAR Methods). Reliable single-neuron responses with a high signal-to-noise ratio were evoked by pure tone stimuli during task performance and passive tone stimulation (Figures 2C, 2G, and 2H; STAR Methods). We first examined the frequency selectivity of individual neurons in response to pure tones of various frequencies randomly delivered under a passive awake condition (Figures 2C and S2C). In some cases, nearby neurons show distinct frequency selectivity (Figures 2D), consistent with previous imaging results in anesthetized mice (Bandyopadhyay et al., 2010Bandyopadhyay S. Shamma S.A. Kanold P.O. Dichotomy of functional organization in the mouse auditory cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, Rothschild et al., 2010Rothschild G. Nelken I. Mizrahi A. Functional organization and population dynamics in the mouse primary auditory cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). However, for local populations, we also found that the best frequency (BF) of individual neurons within the same imaging field (∼250 × 250 μm) are not randomly distributed, with a higher proportion of neurons showing similar frequency preference (Figures 2D and 2E). We defined the frequency preferred by majority of neurons in the local imaging field as the dominant frequency and found that during both task and passive stimulation, the proportion of neurons preferring the dominant frequency was significantly higher than random distribution (Figures 2E and 2F). These results indicate that the frequency representations in local population of the L2/3 of auditory cortex of awake mice are spatially organized, with clustering ensemble structures, consistent with a previous study in unanesthetized mice (Issa et al., 2014Issa J.B.

Engaging in an auditory task suppresses responses in auditory cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 646-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). It is yet unclear whether behavioral tasks may specifically modulate stimulus selectivity of auditory cortex neurons in favor of behavioral needs. Our two-choice auditory categorization task provides a unique opportunity to examine category-related modulation. Figure 2I shows Z-scored mean Ca2+ signals of all imaged neurons sorted according to the peak time in behavioral trials. A significant proportion of neurons show short-latency tone evoked responses aligned to the stimulus time (Figures 2G and 2H). We first compared responses to the BF determined using passive stimulation (BFpass) between task performance and passive stimulation. We observed significant difference in responses to the BFpass in 32% of neurons, among which majority of neurons (29%) show suppressed response during the task while only a small proportion of neurons (3%) show enhanced responses (Figure 2J). We further asked whether the auditory cortical neurons show a change in frequency selectivity during task compared to passive stimulation. We found that among neurons showing suppressed responses to the BFpass, a majority (90.9%) showed different frequency preference during the task (Figure 2K). Remarkably, for these neurons, the frequency preferences during the task were not uniformly distributed across the tested frequencies, with more neurons preferring the frequencies near the category boundary (Figure 2L). A smaller fraction (9.1%) of neurons showing suppressed responses to BFpass showed similar frequency preference during task and passive stimulation. However, these neurons exhibited near-uniform distribution of frequency preference during the task (Figure 2L). These results indicate that rather than a broad-range and nonselective suppression of responses, task-dependent modulation changed the stimulus selectivity of auditory cortex neurons. To further test whether the behavioral modulation of neuronal responses may reshape sensory representations in a task-relevant manner, we compared response profiles of individual neurons in the auditory cortex between task performance and passive stimulation conditions. We found that a substantial proportion (23.2%) of the imaged neurons exhibited categorization-related modulations. First, some neurons became strongly selective to category membership. As shown in Figures 3A and 3B , the neuron exhibited strong responses to tone stimuli belonging to the low-frequency category but showed almost no responses to tone stimuli belonging to the high-frequency category. Such category preference, however, was not present during passive stimulation with the same set of tone stimuli (Figure 3C). We identified these neurons by comparing sigmoidal fits for responses from task and passive conditions (Figures S3A and S3B; 9.8% of all imaged neurons; STAR Methods). Averaging the responses during task performance across these neurons as a function of tone frequencies ordered by an individual neuron’s preferred category gave rise to a sigmoidal population response curve, exhibiting strong selectivity to category membership resembling behavioral categorization function (Figures 3D). However, during passive stimulation, these neurons show diverse frequency selectivity, and averaging across neurons gave rise to an almost flat population response curve lacking category selectivity (Figures 3D). Therefore, the strong selectivity to stimulus category membership in these neurons arose from task-related modulation. Second, we found that many neurons showed enhanced responses to the tone frequencies near category boundaries during task performance compared to passive stimulation (Figure 2L). As shown in Figures 3E–3G, the neuron exhibited stronger responses to stimuli near the category boundary during task performance than during passive stimulation. The enhanced neuronal responses to the near-boundary stimuli may either reflect a task-demanded enhancement in differentiating stimuli near category boundaries (Bonnasse-Gahot and Nadal, 2008Bonnasse-Gahot L. Nadal J.-P. Neural coding of categories: information efficiency and optimal population codes.J. Comput.

Selective amplification of stimulus differences during categorical processing of speech.Neuron. 2007; 56: 726-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) or coincide with an enhanced sensory response by gain modulation. The former would suggest that the response enhancement for near-boundary stimuli was independent of the sensory selectivity during passive stimulation, while the latter would suggest an enhanced response without changes in stimulus selectivity. To distinguish these possibilities, we identified neurons with enhanced responses to near-boundary stimuli by first using a Gaussian fit to an individual neuron’s tuning curve during the task and then selected neurons with preferred frequency near the category boundary (within 0.2 octaves from the inflection point of the psychometric function; see Figures S3C and S3D; STAR Methods). When averaging the responses across the population (13.4% of all imaged neurons), we found a consistent enhancement for responses near the category boundary, which was not present for responses during passive stimulation (Figure 3H). Thus, the task-dependent selective enhancement of neuronal responses near the category boundary likely reflects an increased discrimination demand for near-boundary stimuli during stimulus categorization. The increased responses to the near-boundary stimuli may reflect an increased demand for neuronal resources to enhance discrimination near the decision boundary during categorization (Bonnasse-Gahot and Nadal, 2008Bonnasse-Gahot L.

We thus asked whether the categorization task was accompanied by a reorganization of local ensemble structures to meet behavioral demands. We found that during task performance, the same population of neurons exhibited a different population preference than during passive stimulation, such that the local dominant frequency was closer to the category boundary (Figures 4B and 4C ). Overall, for each imaging field, the distance from the population dominant frequency during the task to the behavioral category boundary is significantly smaller than that for the dominant frequency during passive stimulation (Figure 4D). In each imaging field, a significantly greater fraction of neurons show a preference for near-boundary frequencies during the task than during passive stimulation (Figure 4E). For individual neurons across the entire dataset, the distance from the BF to the behavioral boundary was also significantly smaller during task performance than during passive stimulation (Figures 4F). Thus, during the categorization task, the stimuli near the category boundary became more highly represented, reflecting task-related modulation to meet behavioral demands.

Especially resting state scans, i.e., an examination when the patient does not perform any task in particular, seems to be promising for these patient groups. After preprocessing the resting state fMRI data with a standard pipeline, we extracted the correlation matrices of 132 regions of interest. The aim was to find the regions of interest which contributed most to the distinction between the different patient groups and healthy controls.

https://openalex.org/W2957382888,"Oxytocin is involved in the regulation of social behaviors including parental behaviors in a variety of species. Oxytocin triggers social behaviors by binding to oxytocin receptors (OXTRs) in various parts of the brain. OXTRs are present in the preoptic area (POA) where hormone-sensitive sexually dimorphic nuclei exist. The present study was conducted to examine whether sex differences exist in the distribution of neurons expressing OXTRs in the POA. Using OXTR-Venus (an enhanced variant of yellow fluorescent protein) mice, the distribution of OXTR-Venus cells in the POA was compared between sexes. The total number of OXTR-Venus cells in the medial POA (MPOA) was significantly greater in females than in males. No detectable OXTR-Venus cells were observed in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) within the MPOA in most of the brain sections from males. We further examined the total number of OXTR-Venus cells in the AVPV and the rest of the MPOA between the sexes. The total number of OXTR-Venus cells in the AVPV in females (615 ± 43) was significantly greater than that in males (14 ± 2), whereas the total number of OXTR-Venus cells in the rest of the MPOA did not differ significantly between the sexes. Thus, the sexually dimorphic expression of OXTR-Venus specifically occurred in the AVPV, but not in the rest of the MPOA. We also examined whether the expression of OXTR in the AVPV is driven by the female gonadal hormone, estrogen. Immunocytochemistry and single-cell RT-PCR revealed the presence of the estrogen receptor α in OXTR-Venus cells in the female AVPV. Moreover, ovariectomy resulted in the absence of OXTR-Venus expression in the AVPV, whereas estrogen replacement therapy restored OXTR-Venus expression. These results demonstrate that the expression of OXTR in the AVPV is primarily female specific and estrogen dependent. The presence of the sexually dimorphic expression of OXTR in the AVPV suggests the involvement of OXTR neurons in the AVPV in the regulation of female-specific behavior and/or physiology."

This is of concern because deficits in micronutrient intakes may compromise the health of both mothers and infants. This study aimed to assess micronutrient adequacy and dietary diversity (DD) among rural lactating women and explore relationships between micronutrient adequacy, DD, and intakes of energy and food groups consumed. We measured in-home 12-h weighed food records and 12-h recalls over three non-consecutive days from 121 exclusively breastfeeding women at 2-5 months postpartum. Next, we calculated intakes of energy and 11 micronutrients and estimated probability of adequacy (PA) for usual intakes of 11 micronutrients for each women taking into account national fortification of wheat flour with thiamin, riboflavin, folate, zinc, and iron. We assessed DD from nine food groups consumed. Energy and macronutrient balance were within recommended ranges, yet population prevalence of adequacy was less than 50% for niacin, vitamins B6 and C, and less than 60% for calcium, vitamin B12 and vitamin A, all micronutrients not targeted by the national wheat flour fortification program. In contrast, population prevalence of adequacy for the fortified micronutrients was at least 60%, with iron and zinc attaining 79% and 97%, respectively. Overall mean population prevalence of micronutrient adequacy was 57% and mean (±SD) DD score was 4.3±1.2. Mean PAs, a composite measure based on individual PAs over 11 micronutrients, were strongly correlated with energy intakes and with DD scores. In the multivariate models with maternal education and wealth index as covariates, organ meats were the most important determinant of mean PA after controlling for energy intake. In conclusion, despite wheat flour fortification, lactating mothers remained at risk of multiple micronutrient inadequacies. Increasing intakes of animal source foods including organ meats, and fruits and vegetables should be considered."
https://openalex.org/W2960055488,"Human cytochrome P450 (P450) 11B2 catalyzes the formation of aldosterone, the major endogenous human mineralocorticoid. Aldosterone is important for the regulation of electrolyte homeostasis. Mutations and overexpression of P450 11B2 (also known as aldosterone synthase) can lead to hypertension, congestive heart failure, and diabetic nephropathy. The enzyme is therefore a target for drug development to manage these various disorders. P450 11B2 catalyzes aldosterone formation from 11-deoxycorticosterone through three distinct oxidation steps. It is currently unknown to which degree these reactions happen in sequence without the intermediate products dissociating from the enzyme (i.e. processively) or whether these reactions happen solely distributively, in which the intermediate products must first dissociate and then rebind to the enzyme before subsequent oxidation. We present here a comprehensive investigation of processivity in P450 11B2–catalyzed reactions using steady-state, pre-steady–state, pulse-chase, equilibrium-binding titrations, and stopped-flow binding studies. We utilized the data obtained to develop a kinetic model for P450 11B2 and tested this model by enzyme kinetics simulations. We found that although aldosterone is produced processively, the enzyme preferentially utilizes a distributive mechanism that ends with the production of 18-OH corticosterone. This seemingly contradictory observation could be resolved by considering the ability of the intermediate product 18-OH corticosterone to exist as a lactol form, with the equilibrium favoring the ring-closed lactol configuration. In summary, our refined model for P450 11B2 catalysis indicates isomerization of the intermediate to a lactol can explain why P450 11B2 must produce aldosterone through a processive mechanism despite favoring a distributive mechanism."

This canonical C-cluster architecture is essential for catalysis as it allows for binding of CO at the nickel ion of the cubane, activating it for nucleophilic attack by a water molecule ligated in immediate proximity at Feu (10Hu Z.G.

To access this chemistry, organisms require dedicated cellular machinery for C-cluster assembly, similar to the requirements of other complex metalloclusters (14Shepard E.M. Boyd E.S. Broderick J.B.

Our understanding of the C-cluster assembly process, however, remains incomplete. It is still unknown what the biosynthetic origin of the iron–sulfur scaffold of the cluster is, how the nickel–iron–sulfur cluster is assembled, and what roles individual accessory proteins play in this assembly process. Limited insight into the process of C-cluster assembly has been gleaned from the co-operonic expression of accessory proteins that appear to play roles in cluster maturation, in particular incorporation of nickel. Previous studies have shown that integration of nickel into the C-cluster depends on the accessory protein CooC (15Kerby R.L. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P.

To gain a further understanding of C-cluster maturation and the role of CooC, we have recently developed a means to heterologously express Desulfovibrio vulgaris CODH (DvCODH) in either the presence (DvCODH+CooC) or the absence (DvCODH−CooC) of the D. vulgaris CooC maturase (DvCooC) using Desulfovibrio fructosovorans as an expression host (17Hadj-Saïd J.

This differential expression results in substantially different enzymatic phenotypes (see Table 1). As-isolated DvCODH+CooC binds about half of the expected nickel content and exhibits a lag phase in activity followed by a relatively low rate of CO oxidation (160 μmol·min−1·mg−1) as compared with the previously published activities of monofunctional CODHs from other species, which range from ∼4400 to 16,000 μmol·min−1·mg−1 (17Hadj-Saïd J.

Incubation of the as-isolated DvCODH+CooC with both NiCl2 and the reductant sodium dithionite results in elimination of the lag phase and a 10-fold increase in CO oxidation activity; however, activation does not occur in the presence of NiCl2 or sodium dithionite alone (17Hadj-Saïd J.

In contrast, as-isolated DvCODH−CooC contains low amounts of nickel (0–0.2 nickel/monomer), has nearly no activity (4% of as-isolated DvCODH+CooC), and undergoes limited activation with NiCl2 and sodium dithionite (17Hadj-Saïd J.

Notably, this oxidized conformation of the C-cluster can be converted back to the canonical, reduced conformation by incubation with reducing agent (9Wittenborn E.C. Merrouch M. Ueda C. Fradale L.

The oxidized conformation involves ligation by a cysteine residue that is strictly conserved in CODHs but that does not serve as a ligand to the active, reduced conformation of the cluster (9Wittenborn E.C.

Mutation of this cysteine residue (Cys-301) in DvCODH+CooC to serine (C301S) was shown to result in an inactive enzyme that does not bind nickel (see Table 1) (9Wittenborn E.C. Merrouch M. Ueda C. Fradale L. Léger C. Fourmond V. Pandelia M.E. Dementin S. Drennan C.L.

Feng J. Bramlett M.R. Lindahl P.A. Evidence for a proton transfer network and a required persulfide-bond-forming cysteine residue in Ni-containing carbon monoxide dehydrogenases.Biochemistry. 2004; 43 (15134447): 5728-573410.1021/bi036062uCrossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of DvCODH(C301S)+CooC revealed a partially assembled C-cluster in which Feu adopted a split conformation: Feu was in its canonical binding site at 70% occupancy, and Feu was incorporated into the cubane portion of the cluster at 30% occupancy, taking up the canonical nickel-binding site (Fig. 1D) (9Wittenborn E.C. Merrouch M. Ueda C. Fradale L. Léger C. Fourmond V. Pandelia M.E. Dementin S. Drennan C.L.

This split C-cluster conformation combined with the inability of the DvCODH(C301S)+CooC variant to incorporate nickel led us to propose that the oxidized conformation of the cluster could be an intermediate in C-cluster maturation, although how this conformation may participate in the assembly process remained unclear (9Wittenborn E.C. Merrouch M. Ueda C. Fradale L. Léger C. Fourmond V. Pandelia M.E. Dementin S. Drennan C.L.

To further interrogate the process of C-cluster assembly, we have now determined crystal structures of DvCODH produced in the absence of CooC (DvCODH−CooC) and of a DvCODH variant produced in the presence of CooC and engineered to not contain the surface-accessible D-cluster (DvCODH(ΔD)+CooC). Comparison of the DvCODH−CooC structure to that of DvCODH(C301S)+CooC (9Wittenborn E.C. Merrouch M. Ueda C. Fradale L. Léger C. Fourmond V. Pandelia M.E. Dementin S. Drennan C.L.

Furthermore, removal of the D-cluster leads to formation of an incomplete C-cluster, highlighting the importance of this redox-active iron–sulfur cluster for C-cluster maturation. Combined, these results expand our understanding of C-cluster biogenesis, with an emphasis on the importance of accessing different cluster conformations and redox states. The CODH from D. vulgaris was expressed heterologously in D. fructosovorans in the absence of the C-cluster maturation factor CooC (DvCODH−CooC), as described previously (17Hadj-Saïd J. Pandelia M.E. Léger C. Fourmond V. Dementin S. The carbon monoxide dehydrogenase from Desulfovibrio vulgaris.Biochim. Biophys.

The preparation of protein that was used for crystallization displayed no detectible CO oxidation activity and contained 0 nickel atoms/monomer and 10 iron atoms/monomer (Table 1). The crystal structure of DvCODH−CooC was determined to 1.50 Å resolution (Table 2). The structure aligns well (Cα root-mean-square deviation of 0.18 Å for 1250 Cα atoms within the CODH dimer) with our previously determined structure of DvCODH+CooC (9Wittenborn E.C. Merrouch M.

When the C-cluster was modeled as a [3Fe–4S]–Feu cluster at full occupancy, residual positive difference electron density was observed in the open cubane position, indicating the presence of an additional atom (Fig. 2A).

Although structurally similar to cysteine (Cys), the Sec selenol group has unique properties that are attractive for protein engineering and biotechnology applications. Production of designer proteins with Sec (selenoproteins) at desired positions is now possible with engineered translation systems in Escherichia coli. However, obtaining pure selenoproteins at high yields is limited by the accumulation of free Sec in cells, causing undesired incorporation of Sec at Cys codons due to the inability of cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase (CysRS) to discriminate against Sec. Sec misincorporation is toxic to cells and causes protein aggregation in yeast. To overcome this limitation, here we investigated a CysRS from the selenium accumulator plant Astragalus bisulcatus that is reported to reject Sec in vitro. Sequence analysis revealed a rare His → Asn variation adjacent to the CysRS catalytic pocket. Introducing this variation into E. coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae CysRS increased resistance to the toxic effects of selenite and selenomethionine (SeMet), respectively. Although the CysRS variant could still use Sec as a substrate in vitro, we observed a reduction in the frequency of Sec misincorporation at Cys codons in vivo. We surmise that the His → Asn variation can be introduced into any CysRS to provide a fitness advantage for strains burdened by Sec misincorporation and selenium toxicity. Our results also support the notion that the CysRS variant provides higher specificity for Cys as a mechanism for plants to grow in selenium-rich soils.

This study aimed to estimate the frequency of and factors associated with exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) in the first month of life among Amazonian infants. We used data of 1,523 mother-child pairs of the MINA-Brazil birth cohort study. Mothers were interviewed soon after delivery at baseline and by telephone at 30-45 days postpartum (n = 962, 63.2% of those eligible). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and accelerated failure-time (AFT) models were used to estimate the probability of EBF and the factors associated with EBF duration in the first month. At 30 days of age, 36.7% of the studied population (95% confidence interval [CI] 33.6-39.8) were exclusively breastfed, with a median duration of 16 days. Considering all eligible children for follow-up, the probability of EBF in the first month was 43.7% (95% CI 40.4-46.8), and the median duration was 30 days. The duration of EBF (time-ratio, TR) was 28% longer among multiparous mothers (TR 1.28; 95% CI 1.11-1.48). The use of a pacifier and the occurrence of wheezing were associated with a reduced EBF duration by 33% (TR 0.67; 95% CI 0.58-0.77) and 19% (TR 0.80; 95% CI 0.70-0.93), respectively. These results highlight that EBF among children in the Brazilian Amazon is considerably below international recommendations, and indicate the immediate need to plan and implement actions to promote and support breastfeeding early in life."

That trial will report its primary outcome, gestational length at birth, after data collection concludes in 2019. This nested study includes providers of ANC and/or PNC at the 18 health centers randomized to provide the group model of ANC/PNC and the 18 health centers randomized to continue providing ANC/PNC in the traditional, individual visit model. The objective of this study is to understand the experiences of providers of group ANC/PNC and compare their job satisfaction and perceived stress with individual ANC/PNC providers.We collected both quantitative and qualitative data from providers (nurses and midwives) who were recruited by health center directors to participate as group ANC and PNC facilitators at intervention sites and from a similar number of providers of standard ANC and PNC at control sites. Quantitative data was collected with questionnaires administered at baseline and approximately 9 months later (follow up). Qualitative data was collected in 3 focus groups of group ANC/PNC providers conducted one year after group care began.Eighty-six percent of nurses and midwives surveyed who implemented group ANC and PNC reported that they prefer group care to the traditional individual model of ANC and PNC. Perceived stress levels and job satisfaction results were similar between groups. Mixed focus group discussions among both nurses and midwives experienced in group ANC and PNC suggest that the group model of care has advantages for both service beneficiaries and providers. When providers described implementation challenges, their peers in the focus groups offered them suggestions to cope and improve service delivery.These results are consistent with studies of providers of group ANC and PNC in other LMIC contexts with respect to the perceived benefits of group care. This study adds new insights into the ways peer providers can help one another solve implementation problems. When given the opportunity to meet as a group, these study participants offered one another peer support and shared knowledge about best practices for successful implementation of group ANC/PNC. This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03154177."

Studies based on egg sizes and brooding times of deep-sea and polar octopods support this hypothesis, but empirical data on growth are still scarce. To test the hypothesis that octopods inhabiting cold waters (< 3°C) live longer than temperate and warm water species, this study investigated size-at-age, maturation and growth rates in incirrate Antarctic octopods. Octopod age was estimated via the interpretation and quantification of beak growth increments, which in shallow water octopods have been validated to be formed on a daily basis. Specimens from the families Megaleledonidae (Adelieledone spp., Pareledone spp. and Megaleledone setebos) and Enteroctopodidae (Muusoctopus rigbyae) were collected on the shelf and slope regions off the Antarctic Peninsula during a cruise in 2012. Examined specimens included early juveniles to animals in advanced maturity. The total number of growth increments ranged from 192–599 in Pareledone aequipapillae (body mass [BM] 2–109 g), 182–431 in Pareledone charcoti (BM 5–124 g), 98–906 in M. setebos (BM 10–6000 g) and 207–425 in M. rigbyae (BM 24–256 g). After the cruise, eleven specimens of P. charcoti were kept alive in captivity for more than 12 months and these animals had 219–364 growth increments, suggesting that increment formation in this species takes longer than one day. The complex population structure (size, age and maturity range) of the specimens that were captured during a relatively short time, the number of beak increments quantified, and the preliminary validation observations indicate that Antarctic octopods do not deposit increments daily, and may have lifespans exceeding 3 years. These findings corroborate the general trend that cold water molluscs have a longer lifespan than their warm water relatives."
https://openalex.org/W2957842750,"Intestinal failure-associated liver disease (IFALD) is a risk of parenteral nutrition (PN)-dependence. Intravenous soybean oil-based parenteral fat can exacerbate the risk of IFALD while intravenous fish oil can minimize its progression, yet the mechanisms by which soybean oil harms and fish oil protects the liver are uncertain. Properties that differentiate soybean and fish oils include α-tocopherol and phytosterol content. Soybean oil is rich in phytosterols and contains little α-tocopherol. Fish oil contains abundant α-tocopherol and little phytosterols. This study tested whether α-tocopherol confers hepatoprotective properties while phytosterols confer hepatotoxicity to intravenous fat emulsions. Utilizing emulsions formulated in the laboratory, a soybean oil emulsion (SO) failed to protect from hepatosteatosis in mice administered a PN solution enterally. An emulsion of soybean oil containing α-tocopherol (SO+AT) preserved normal hepatic architecture. A fish oil emulsion (FO) and an emulsion of fish oil containing phytosterols (FO+P) protected from steatosis in this model. Expression of hepatic acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), was increased in animals administered SO. ACC and PPARγ levels were comparable to chow-fed controls in animals receiving SO+AT, FO, and FO+P. This study suggests a hepatoprotective role for α-tocopherol in liver injury induced by the enteral administration of a parenteral nutrition solution.

Until now, the manner in which BK channel function is related to these disorders has mainly been studied in neurons. Little is yet known about the role of the BK channel in microglia, which are the resident macrophages in brain and are considered important target cells for therapeutic intervention in the above neurologic diseases (6Kettenmann H.

Furthermore, the specific BK channel activator NS1619 could activate spinal microglia in naïve mice, whereas pharmacological blockade or the genetic deletion of BK channels in microglia prevented morphine-induced production of inflammatory factors (15Hayashi Y.

These results implied that BK channels are involved in microglia activation; however, the mechanisms underlying the contribution of microglial BK channels to cellular activation has remained unclear. Previously, we observed that either BK knockout or inhibition affects murine microglia function (16Yang X. Zhao W. Zhang L. Cui J. Sun X. Zhen X. The role of BK channel in microglia activation.Biophys. J. 2017; 112: 54810.1016/j.bpj.2016.11.2960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar). This study was designed to investigate the possible role and underlying mechanism of BK channels in microglia activation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as the pro-inflammatory stimulus. Both plasma membrane (PM) and nuclear BK channels were found to participate in microglia activation, although at different stages and through different pathways. To test whether BK channels are involved in microglia activation, we first investigated the effect of the specific BK channel blocker paxilline on NO production and inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX2) expression in BV-2 cells with or without LPS stimulation (Fig. 1, A–D). Paxilline was applied 30 min prior to LPS treatment, which significantly inhibited NO production and iNOS and COX2 expression in BV-2 cells without affecting cell viability (data not shown). However, paxilline itself had no effect on resting BV-2 cells. We further knocked down BK channels using a BK-targeted siRNA oligonucleotide (Fig. 1E) and measured NO production induced by LPS in the absence or presence of paxilline. Compared with BV-2 cells transfected with negative control (NC) siRNA, BK knockdown BV-2 cells showed similar basal NO synthesis (33.0 ± 13.8 μm compared with 26.5 ± 18.7 μm, p > 0.05) and significantly decreased NO production (71.0 ± 9.5 μm compared with 101.0 ± 17.6 μm, p < 0.001) upon treatment with LPS. Preincubation with paxilline significantly inhibited LPS-induced NO production in BV-2 cells transfected with NC siRNA but did not inhibit LPS-induced NO production in BV-2 cells transfected with BK siRNA (Fig. 1F). These results suggest that BK channels are involved in LPS-induced microglia activation. We observed that basal NO levels in transfected BV-2 cells were much higher than those in nontransfected cells (26.5 ± 18.7 μm compared with 4.8 ± 4.7 μm), which might have been due to the transfection procedure. To confirm whether LPS could activate BK currents in BV-2 cells, we next examined the effects of LPS on membrane currents. A whole-cell patch clamp configuration was used to record membrane currents of BV-2 cells. The cells were held at −20 mV and depolarized to +80 mV for 200 ms to stimulate BK currents. The +80-mV pulse was repeated every 10 s, and membrane currents were recorded. The resting membrane potential of BV-2 cells is −71 ± 5 mV (n = 43 cells), which is not affected by LPS (Fig. S1). LPS (100 ng/ml) significantly enhanced membrane current (41.0 ± 23.7%), and its effect reached a plateau within 1 min. The subsequent application of paxilline completely inhibited LPS-induced membrane current and further reduced the current to 41.6 ± 22.9% lower than the initial baseline current, indicating that LPS activates the membrane BK current of BV-2 cells (Fig. 2, A–C). Because the membrane-spanning Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is essential for LPS-initiated transmembrane signaling and microglia activation, we then measured the effect of LPS on BV-2 cells in the presence of the TLR4 antagonist CLI095 (2 μm). We found that LPS failed to increase membrane current under CLI095 treatment (Fig. 2, B and C), while CLI095 itself had no effect on membrane currents (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, we measured whole-cell membrane currents at voltages ranging from −20 to +80 mV and used paxilline-sensitive fractions as BK currents (Fig. 2, E and F). The paxilline-sensitive baseline currents showed a similar current-voltage (IV) relation with BK currents of microglia in juvenile mice hippocampal slices (12Schilling T. Eder C. Ion channel expression in resting and activated microglia of hippocampal slices from juvenile mice.Brain Res. 2007; 1186 (18005942): 21-2810.1016/j.brainres.2007.10.027Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). LPS leftward-shifted the IV curve of BK channels in BV-2 cells (Fig. 2F). Because the key event in LPS-induced microglia activation is NF-κB translocation, we wondered whether activation of the membrane BK channel regulates NF-κB translocation. BV-2 cells were left untreated or were treated with LPS in the absence or presence of paxilline for 1 h before staining. Incubation for 1 h was chosen because almost all BV-2 cells show strong nuclear p65 staining at this time point (Fig. 3A). In control cells, green p65 staining only appeared in cytosolic compartments, and in cells treated with LPS, p65 staining was observed in condensed nuclei. The application of paxilline 30 min prior to LPS treatment significantly inhibited p65 translocation; cells under this condition showed much less nuclear p65 staining compared with cells treated with LPS alone. However, paxilline failed to prevent p65 translocation if applied 30 min after LPS treatment (Fig. 3A), indicating that membrane BK channel activation promotes NF-κB translocation. These results were further confirmed by immunoblot experiments. As shown in Fig. 3, LPS induced higher nuclear p65 quantity in BV-2 cells and application of paxilline preincubation rather than postincubation inhibited this LPS-induced elevation of nuclear p65 (Fig. 3, B and C). However, there appeared to be no significant differences in cytosolic p65 levels among these four treatment groups (Fig. 3, B and D). To test whether the NF-κB translocation induced by membrane BK channel activation is the primary mechanism by which BK channels participate in microglia activation, we further examined the effect of paxilline on LPS-induced NO production in BV-2 cells at different time points. We found that 30 min of preincubation in paxilline decreased NO production due to LPS treatment by ∼50% (from 47.5 ± 7.0 to 22.1 ± 3.1 μm, p < 0.001). With application of paxilline at 30 min (Pax post-LPS 30 min), 1 h (Pax post-LPS 1 h), and even 3 h (Pax post-LPS 3 h) after LPS application and while it did not reverse NF-κB translocation, paxilline could still significantly inhibit NO production by ∼30%, from 47.5 ± 7.0 μm in LPS (no paxilline) to 33.3 ± 4.6 μm in Pax post-LPS 30 min (p < 0.001), 33.3 ± 4.5 μm in Pax post-LPS 1 h (p < 0.001), and 35.2 ± 2.8 μm in Pax post-LPS 3 h (p < 0.01). Paxilline had no effect after 6 h of LPS treatment (Fig. 4A). Moreover, when applied 30 min after LPS incubation, paxilline also significantly suppressed both tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) release, although to a slightly lesser extent than upon preincubation with paxilline (Fig. 4, C and D). These results suggest that BK channels can also modulate cytokine production through an NF-κB–independent pathway that might perform a more important role. Next, we explored the expression and distribution of BK channels in BV-2 cells stimulated with LPS. We observed that BK channels were expressed not only on cell membranes but were also expressed in intracellular compartments, especially in late stages of LPS treatment. Fig. 5A showed that the expression of BK channels increased with the increased duration of LPS treatment. BK channels resided mainly on the cell membrane in control cells but showed strong nuclear localization after 12 h of LPS treatment. Fig. 5, B and C, showed that the expression of BK channels in whole cells increased with the duration of LPS treatment and that nuclear BK channel expression increased significantly after 12 h of LPS treatment. Moreover, the observed increase in BK channel expression was not inhibited by the specific NF-κB inhibitor Bay11-7082 but was inhibited by the TLR4 inhibitor CLI-095 (2 μm, Fig. 5D). This result suggests that the enhanced expression of nuclear BK channels is not a downstream event of NF-κB activation but is independent of the activation of membrane BK channels and might contribute to NO and cytokine production in the late stages of microglia activation. We further investigated the role of BK channels in primary microglia activation. Primary mouse microglia were isolated and were either untreated, treated with paxilline before or after LPS stimulation, or treated with paxilline alone. As shown in Fig. 6, A–C, the inhibition of BK channels by paxilline significantly repressed NO, IL-6, and TNFα release, whether paxilline was applied before or after primary microglia activation by LPS, but paxilline did not affect the basal level of these cytokines. Notably, the inhibitory effect of paxilline on cytokine production was slightly stronger when it was applied before rather than after LPS treatment, similar to what has been shown in BV-2 cells. Immunocytochemistry results showed that in the control group p65 is located in the cytosol of primary mouse microglia (Fig. 6D, see positive staining with ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1), red, Con) and that p65 is translocated to the nucleus after 1 h of LPS incubation (Fig. 6D, LPS). Pre-application of paxilline inhibited translocation of p65 to the nucleus in ∼60% of primary mouse microglia (32 microglia counted in total from three different slides in two independent experiments, Fig. 6D, Pax pre-LPS). Addition of paxilline after treatment with LPS did not prevent p65 translocation (Fig. 6D, Pax post-LPS). As in BV-2 cells, BK channels are also broadly expressed in primary mouse microglia. Nuclear BK channel expression increased with increased duration of LPS treatment and reached a peak around 12 h of treatment (Fig. 6E). In this study, we demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, that PM and nuclear BK channels sequentially participate in LPS-induced microglia activation. The PM BK channel is activated by LPS via TLR4 at a very early stage of microglia activation, which then leads to translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus to initiate transcription of inflammatory cytokines. The expression of the nuclear BK channel is induced by LPS to facilitate the production of both cytokines and NO at late stages of microglia activation through a TLR4-dependent pathway (as depicted in Fig. 7). Although little is known about the role of the BK channel in microglia activation, it is well-studied in macrophages. BK channel activation is associated with the proinflammatory effect of macrophages induced by various stimuli, including LPS (17Seydel U. Scheel O. Müller M. Brandenburg K. Blunck R.

However, regulation of NF-κB translocation might not be the primary function of BK channels in activation of microglia, particularly primary microglia, because blockade of the BK channel after NF-κB translocation can still suppress the release of most of the downstream inflammatory factors. LPS has been reported to rapidly and directly activate BK channels at quite high concentrations (10–100 μg/ml) and with intracellular application in murine vascular smooth muscle cells (28Hoang L.M.

Our results showed that in murine microglia LPS activates BK current at 100–1000-fold lower concentrations, and from the extracellular side, this effect can be inhibited by TLR4 antagonist CLI095, implying that LPS activates BK channels via TLR4.

This study examines how STIM (Stromal Interacting Molecule), an ER-Ca2+ sensor required for Store-operated Ca2+ entry, regulates neuropeptides required for Drosophila development under nutrient restriction (NR). We find two STIM-regulated peptides, Corazonin and short Neuropeptide F, to be required for NR larvae to complete development. Further, a set of secretory DLP (Dorso lateral peptidergic) neurons which co-express both peptides was identified. Partial loss of dSTIM caused peptide accumulation in the DLPs, and reduced systemic Corazonin signalling. Upon NR, larval development correlated with increased peptide levels in the DLPs, which failed to occur when dSTIM was reduced. Comparison of systemic and cellular phenotypes associated with reduced dSTIM, with other cellular perturbations, along with genetic rescue experiments, suggested that dSTIM primarily compromises neuroendocrine function by interfering with neuropeptide release. Under chronic stimulation, dSTIM also appears to regulate neuropeptide synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2957765720,"Continuity in forest habitats is crucial for species diversity and richness. Ancient Scots pine forests are usually under forest management, which disturbs vegetation and causes differentiation in terms of tree stand age. To date, vegetation variability in ancient Scots pine forests has not been examined based on tree stand age classes. In the present study the continuity of a large Scots pine forest complex was investigated, and a system of sampling plots established in five tree stand age classes: initiation stands (4-10 years), young stands (20-35 years), middle-aged stands (45-60 years), pre-mature stands (70-85 years) and mature stands (95-110 years). Species composition, including vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens, on soil, tree trunks, and coarse woody debris, was analyzed. Based on existing classifications systems, forest species and ancient forest species groups were distinguished. In the studied ancient Scots pine forests the species pool and richness were relatively low, and the vegetation consisted mostly of generalist species. Cryptogams, which can grow on diverse substrates, were the most abundant species. Moreover, most species could tolerate both forest and non-forest conditions. Age class forests provided different environmental niches for species. Initiation stands were optimal for terrestrial light-demanding species, and in terms of species composition, initiation stands were most specific. Young stands were most preferred by species on coarse woody debris, and at this stage of stand maturation epiphytic species re-appeared. The oldest stands were not rich in forest specialists, i.e. species of closed forest and ancient forest species. Cryptogams of closed forests inhabited different substrates, and they were not associated only with the oldest stands. The low number of forest specialists in the oldest stands may be a general feature of acidophilus pine forests. However, it may also be a result of the lack of species sources in the vicinity of maturing pine stands. In managed forests a frequent diversity pattern is an increase in a species pool and richness after clear-cut logging. In the present study we obtained higher species pools in initiation and young stands, but richness was similar in all tree stand age classes. This resulted from taking into account species of different substrates (terrestrial, epixylous and epiphytic species) which changed their participation in the vegetation of subsequent stages of tree stand development."

Here, we investigated whether metal ions could affect allele-dependent structural variation of the two minimally distinct human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*27:05 and HLA-B*27:09 subtypes, which exhibit differential association with the rheumatic disease ankylosing spondylitis (AS). We employed NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography coupled with ensemble refinement to study the AS-associated HLA-B*27:05 subtype and the AS-nonassociated HLA-B* 27:09 in complex with the self-peptide pVIPR (RRKWRRWHL). Both techniques revealed that pVIPR exhibits a higher degree of flexibility when complexed with HLA-B*27:05 than with HLA-B*27:09. Furthermore, we found that the binding of the metal ion Cu2+ or Ni2+, but not Mn2+, Zn2+, or Hg2+, affects the structure of a pVIPR-bound HLA-B*27 molecule in a subtype-dependent manner. In HLA-B*27:05, the metals triggered conformational reorientations of pVIPR, but no such structural changes were observed in the HLA-B*27:09 subtype, with or without bound metal ion. These observations provide the first demonstration that not only major histocompatibility complex class II, but also class I, molecules can undergo metal ion–induced conformational alterations.

https://openalex.org/W2956568419,"Background Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. Considerable funding and efforts are invested in breast cancer research and healthcare, but only a fraction of this reaches women and healthcare systems in low income countries. Surgical treatment is an essential part of breast cancer care, but access to surgery is in general very limited in low income countries such as Uganda. In this study, the previously unknown nationwide rate of breast cancer surgery was investigated. Methods and findings This was a multicenter, retrospective study, investigating breast cancer surgery in the public healthcare system in Uganda. Data were collected from operating theater registries at primary, secondary and tertiary level healthcare centres throught the country, including 14 general hospitals, the 14 regional referral hospitals and the national referral hospital. Patients who underwent major surgery for breast cancer at these hospitals during 2013 and 2014 were included. The number of breast cancer procedures performed, geographical variation, level of healthcare staff performing surgery and patient characteristics were investigated. After correction for missing data, a total of 137 breast cancer procedures were performed each year within the public healthcare system, corresponding to 5.7% of the breast cancer incidence in the country at that time. Most procedures (n = 161, 59.0%) were performed at the national referral hospital by qualified surgeons. Many of the patients were young; 30.1% being less than 40 years old. The proportion of male breast cancers in the study was large (6.2%). Conclusions The rate of breast cancer surgery in Uganda is minimal and in several parts of the country breast cancer surgery is not performed at all. More resources must be directed towards breast cancer in low income countries such as Uganda. The fact that the patients were young calls for further research, prevention and treatment specifically targeting young women in the study setting."

In glioma and osteosarcoma cell lines, Merlin is nuclear early in G1 and gets exported toward the plasma membrane before S phase entry (16Muranen T. Grönholm M. Renkema G.H. Carpén O. Cell cycle-dependent nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the neurofibromatosis 2 tumour suppressor merlin.Oncogene. 2005; 24 (15580288): 1150-115810.1038/sj.onc.1208283Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Also, an interaction between Merlin and HEI10 was reported. HEI10 is involved in the regulation of cyclin B levels (17Grönholm M. Muranen T. Toby G.G. Utermark T. Hanemann C.O. Golemis E.A. Carpén O. A functional association between merlin and HEI10, a cell cycle regulator.Oncogene. 2006; 25 (16532029): 4389-439810.1038/sj.onc.1209475Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, no specific role of its interaction with Merlin was identified in the control of cell cycle progression. More recently Hebert et al. (18Hebert A.M. DuBoff B. Casaletto J.B. Gladden A.B. McClatchey A.I. Merlin/ERM proteins establish cortical asymmetry and centrosome position.Genes Dev. 2012; 26 (23249734): 2709-272310.1101/gad.194027.112Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Merlin regulates polarized cell division by restricting the cortical distribution of ezrin necessary for centrosome positioning and proper orientation of cell division.

In Drosophila cells, moesin activation by phosphorylation during mitosis increases the cortical rigidity necessary for proper spindle morphogenesis and chromosome alignment (19Carreno S. Kouranti I.

Moesin also regulates spindle length during metaphase and cell shape at a later stage of mitosis (21Solinet S. Mahmud K. Stewman S.F. Ben El Kadhi K. Decelle B. Talje L. Ma A. Kwok B.H. Carreno S. The actin-binding ERM protein Moesin binds to and stabilizes microtubules at the cell cortex.J. Cell Biol. 2013; 202 (23857773): 251-26010.1083/jcb.201304052Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, the phosphorylation of the ERM by the kinase Slk during mitosis is key to the proper orientation of spindle (22Machicoane M. de Frutos C.A. Fink J. Rocancourt M. Lombardi Y. Garel S. Piel M. Echard A. SLK-dependent activation of ERMs controls LGN–NuMA localization and spindle orientation.J.

Interestingly, Merlin was shown to directly bind to microtubules and promote their stabilization (23Muranen T. Grönholm M. Lampin A. Lallemand D. Zhao F. Giovannini M. Carpén O. (2007). The tumor suppressor merlin interacts with microtubules and modulates Schwann cell microtubule cytoskeleton.Hum. Mol.

These observations suggest that Merlin plays a role in cell cycle progression and more specifically during mitosis. In the present study, we show that Merlin is a substrate for Aurora protein kinase A on the main regulatory serine 518, during mitosis. This event facilitates the phosphorylation of a second, newly discovered, site at position 581 that is specific of Merlin isoform 1. When Merlin dual phosphorylation is compromised, it leads to a defect in the stabilization of mitotic spindle orientation prior to metaphase, delaying the onset of anaphase. At the mechanistic level, we show that phosphorylation on Ser-518 controls Merlin interaction with α-tubulin whereas Thr-581 phosphorylation modulates Merlin binding to ezrin and subsequently ezrin interactions with both actin and α-tubulin. Importantly, specific patient mutations affecting the FERM (Four point one ezrin radixin moesin) domain of Merlin result in abnormal phosphorylation profile and α-tubulin–binding properties, in some case associated with a delay in mitotic progression. Altogether our observations suggest that tight regulation of Merlin by Aurora protein kinase A is involved in mitotic progression via regulated binding to α-tubulin and ezrin and is compromised by mutations found in neurofibromatosis type 2 patients. The Aurora protein kinase A phosphorylates a variety of substrates during the cell cycle progression. The phosphorylation sites contain a conserved arginine in −2 position relative to the target serine residue, and leucine is frequently found in −1 (25Kettenbach A. N1. Schweppe D.K. Faherty B.K. Pechenick D. Pletnev A.A. Gerber S.A. Quantitative phosphoproteomics identifies substrates and functional modules of Aurora and Polo-like kinase activities in mitotic cells.Sci. Signal. 2011; 4 (21712546): rs510.1126/scisignal.2001497Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). A close examination of the sequence surrounding serine 518 of Merlin suggests a phosphorylation site for Aurora A, with arginine and a leucine in position 516 and 517, respectively (Fig. 1A). To test if Merlin could be a substrate for Aurora A in vitro, GFP-Merlin was immunoprecipitated from interphasic HEK293 cells, dephosphorylated with alkaline phosphatase, and then incubated with recombinant GST–Aurora A. The same procedure was performed with GFP-Merlin mutant S518A, as a negative control. Using a specific antibody to p–Ser-518, we could show that Aurora A efficiently phosphorylates this site in vitro (Fig. 1B). Endogenous phospho-Merlin could not reproducibly be detected in total extracts from HeLa cells, likely because of a low affinity of the p–Ser-518 antibody and low levels of Merlin expression. Therefore, we generated HeLa cells overexpressing Merlin isoform 1 under the Tet-inducible promoter (Fig. S1A). Mitotic extracts were prepared from detached mitotic cells following overnight nocodazole block. The remaining attached cells were collected as interphasic population. As presented in Fig. 1C, the phosphorylation of Ser-518 was much higher (more than five times) in mitosis than during interphase. Mitotic HeLa cells overexpressing Merlin isoform I were then treated with the Aurora A–specific inhibitor MLN8054. We observed a clear reduction of Merlin phosphorylation on Ser-518 (Fig. 1D). On the contrary, Aurora B inhibitor ZM4474 (Fig. 1E) had no effect. To confirm these results on endogenous Merlin, we treated mitotic HEK293 cells, expressing higher levels of Merlin than HeLa cells, with MLN8054. We observed that Ser-518 phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated Merlin dropped by 80% when compared with untreated cells (Fig. 1F). Finally, we could coprecipitate endogenous Aurora protein kinase A with GFP-Merlin from mitotic extracts. Interestingly, although the Ser-518 phosphorylation site is close to the C-terminal end, the binding site of Aurora A lies within the FERM domain (Fig. 1G). Aurora A did not co-immunoprecipitate with the patient-derived Merlin ∂2–3 mutant lacking amino acids 38 to 121 of the FERM domain (26Giovannini M. Robanus-Maandag E. Niwa-Kawakita M. van der Valk M. Woodruff J.M. Goutebroze L. Mérel P. Berns A. Thomas G. Schwann cell hyperplasia and tumors in transgenic mice expressing a naturally occurring mutant NF2 protein.Genes Dev. 1999; 13 (10215625): 978-98610.1101/gad.13.8.978Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1H) and the phosphorylation of Ser-518 was drastically reduced in mitosis when compared with WT Merlin (Fig. 1I). Altogether, our results demonstrate that Merlin is a bona fide substrate for Aurora A during mitosis. A search for new phosphorylation sites of Merlin, by MS, identified Thr-581 in extracts from HEK293 cells (Fig. 2A). Ser-518 and Thr-581 were the two strongest peaks visible by a proteomic approach. Interestingly, Thr-581 is specific of Merlin isoform 1 (Fig. 2B). We raised a specific antibody against a peptide containing the phosphorylated Thr-581. By Western blotting, a weak signal was observed in asynchronous population but only when Merlin was overexpressed. The signal was abolished when Thr-581 was changed for an alanine, demonstrating the specificity of the antibody (Fig. 2C). As was observed with Ser-518, the phosphorylation of Thr-581 was much more pronounced in mitosis than during interphase (Fig. 2D). Importantly, Thr-581 phosphorylation was detected in mouse kidney extracts in the context of a proteomic screen of mouse phosphoproteins. p–Ser-518 was detected more frequently than p–Thr-581 (https://phosphomouse.hms.harvard.edu/). 8Please note that the JBC is not responsible for the long-term archiving and maintenance of this site or any other third party hosted site. This suggests that the phosphorylation of Thr-581 might be limited compared with Ser-518. The sequence surrounding Thr-581 does not closely match any known kinase consensus site. When we treated the mitotically arrested HeLa cells with MLN8054, there was no decrease of Thr-581 phosphorylation (Fig. 2E) and Aurora A did not phosphorylate Thr-581 in vitro, indicating that this site is not a substrate for this kinase. We confirmed that Thr-581 was not a substrate for Aurora B or C, or Slik. Also, Lats1/2 kinases, which were shown to interact with and be regulated by Aurora kinases (27Yabuta N. Mukai S. Okada N. Aylon Y. Nojima H. The tumor suppressor Lats2 is pivotal in Aurora A and Aurora B signaling during mitosis.Cell Cycle. 2011; 10 (21822051): 2724-273610.4161/cc.10.16.16873Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and that can bind the FERM domain of Merlin, did not appear to phosphorylate Merlin during mitosis (Fig. S1, B and C). Thus, it appears that Thr-581 is the target of a kinase that is activated during mitosis and remains to be identified. It was previously shown that Ser-518 phosphorylation facilitates the phosphorylation of Ser-10, enabling Merlin degradation by the proteasome (28Laulajainen M. Muranen T. Nyman T.A. Carpén O. Grönholm M. Multistep phosphorylation by oncogenic kinases enhances the degradation of the NF2 tumor suppressor merlin.Neoplasia. 2011; 13 (21750658): 643-65210.1593/neo.11356Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We thus tested if phosphorylation of Ser-518 and Thr-581 could influence each other. To do so, we compared the phosphorylation of each site, during mitosis, when the second site is mutated to an alanine (A) or to aspartic acid (D). Mutations of Thr-581 had no impact on the phosphorylation of Ser-518. However, Thr-581 was more efficiently phosphorylated when Ser-518 was changed for an aspartic acid as opposed to an alanine (Fig. 2, F and G). Hence our data show that phosphorylation of Ser-518 facilitates the phosphorylation of Thr-581 during mitosis. It is possible that Ser-518 phosphorylation creates a new binding site for the kinase that targets Thr-581. In addition, it is also conceivable that Ser-518 phosphorylation changes Merlin conformation facilitating the binding of a second kinase. Our results show that both Ser-518 and Thr-581 of Merlin are strongly phosphorylated during mitosis. We next investigated the consequences of the expression of double alanine (518A/581A, referred as AA hereafter) or aspartic acid substitution (518D/581D, referred as DD hereafter) mutants in HeLa cells during this phase of the cell cycle (Merlin mutant expression in HeLa cells is shown in Fig. S1D). Using video microscopy (Fig. 3A), their impact on mitotic progression was evaluated by measuring the interval between nuclear envelope breakdown (NEB) and the onset of anaphase (sister chromatid separation, SCS). A comparison has been made with uninduced HeLa cells after we confirmed that WT Merlin overexpression had no effect on mitosis duration (Fig. S2). The expression of the dual aspartic acid mutant (DD) that mimics the doubly phosphorylated state of Merlin observed during mitosis induced a very modest increase of the duration of NEB to SCS (Fig. 3, A, lower panel, and B, right panel). The expression of the dual AA mutant, on the other hand, had a much more drastic effect, doubling the NEB to SCS transition time (Fig. 3, A, upper panel, and B, left panel). More precisely, we could show that the longer mitosis is because of an increased duration of pro-metaphase to anaphase transition (Fig. 3C). Anaphase starts when the two centrosomes stabilize on the same plane at cellular poles providing an anchor for proper chromosomes separation (29Reboutier D. Benaud C. Prigent C. Aurora A's functions during mitotic exit: The guess who game.Front. Oncol. 2015; 5 (26734572): 29010.3389/fonc.2015.00290Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 30Gavet O. Pines J. Progressive activation of cyclinB1-Cdk1 coordinates entry to mitosis.Dev.

Interestingly, we observed that the angle of the plane containing the two centrosomes to the plane of the adhesion surface (Fig. 3D) during metaphase is larger on average when the AA mutant is expressed. No such difference was observed with the DD mutant (Fig. 3E). This indicates that, at a given time during metaphase, the centrosomes are less likely to be on a plane parallel to the adhesion surface when AA mutant is expressed (Fig. 3F). In other words, it takes more time to align the centrosome in AA mutant–expressing cells, likely delaying anaphase onset. Thus, the double phosphorylation of Merlin appears necessary for mitosis to proceed and its absence delays the transition from NEB to SCS. Merlin was shown to bind and to destabilize microtubules (24Smole Z. Thoma C.R. Applegate K.T. Duda M. Gutbrodt K.L. Danuser G. Krek W. Tumor suppressor NF2/Merlin is a microtubule stabilizer.Cancer Res. 2014; 74 (24282279): 353-36210.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). When we examined the binding of α-tubulin to GFP-Merlin, we observed a strong interaction during interphase that is nearly abolished during mitosis (Fig. 4A). Importantly, we observed that the DD mutant weakly interacts with α-tubulin in contrast to the strong binding of the AA mutant (Fig. 4B and Fig. S3A). This suggests that the phosphorylation of Merlin during mitosis inhibits the interaction of Merlin with microtubules. It was previously observed that phosphorylation of Ser-518 decreases the affinity of Merlin for α-tubulin (23Muranen T. Grönholm M. Lampin A. Lallemand D. Zhao F. Giovannini M. Carpén O. (2007). The tumor suppressor merlin interacts with microtubules and modulates Schwann cell microtubule cytoskeleton.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16 (17566081): 1742-175110.1093/hmg/ddm122Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We used single mutant (A or D) of Ser-518 and Thr-581 to investigate their respective role in regulating Merlin/α-tubulin binding. Interestingly, we found opposite effects. As expected 518A mutant bound much better than 518D. However, 581D mutant bound strongly to α-tubulin compared with 581A (Fig. 4B and Fig. S3B). Thus it appears that the phosphorylation of Ser-518 controls the interaction with α-tubulin. Merlin isoform 2 does not contain Thr-581. We observed that it binds consistently better than isoform 1 to tubulin (Fig. 4C). Nevertheless, the interaction is much weaker during mitosis (Fig. 4D) and also when Ser-518 is changed for an aspartic residue compared with an alanine, demonstrating the same mode of regulation for both isoforms (Fig. 4E). The observation that Merlin mutant T581D binds α-tubulin better than T581A suggests that the former may harbor a different conformation making the FERM domain more accessible. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that isoform 2, which is expected to be under a more open conformation resulting from the absence of interaction between the FERM and the C-ERMAD (C-terminal ERM association domain) domains, also binds better to α-tubulin when compared with isoform 1. We then used co-immunoprecipitation assays between GST-Merlin-FERM and GFP-C-terminal half of Merlin to test the effect of single and double phosphosite mutations on the intramolecular interaction (Fig. 4F, left panel). As observed by Sher et al. (31Sher I. Hanemann C.O. Karplus P.A. Bretscher A. The tumor suppressor merlin controls growth in its open state, and phosphorylation converts it to a less-active more-closed state.Dev. Cell. 2012; 22 (22516197): 703-70510.1016/j.devcel.2012.03.008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), S518D mutation tends to increase the interaction. In contrast, T581D strongly weakens intramolecular interaction suggesting that phosphorylation of Thr-581 may open Merlin isoform 1 conformation. Dual DD and AA mutants showed barely any differences indicative of antagonistic effects. Merlin C-ERMAD also interacts with ERM FERM domain. Using the same strategy, we tested Merlin C terminus interaction with ezrin FERM domain (Fig. 4F, right panel). We did not observe a significant impact of Ser-518 D or A mutation. However, the substitution of an alanine for Thr-581 resulted in a dramatic increase in the interaction with ezrin FERM domain when compared with aspartic acid substitution. Merlin AA mutant also bound better than the DD mutant, indicating that phosphorylation of Thr-581 is predominant for the regulation of Merlin/ezrin interaction (Fig. 4F, right panel). ERM binds α-tubulin via their FERM domain and the interaction stabilizes microtubules at the cell cortex in the case of moesin (19Carreno S. Kouranti I. Glusman E.S. Fuller M.T. Echard A. Payre F. Moesin and its activating kinase Slik are required for cortical stability and microtubule organization in mitotic cells.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180 (18283112): 739-74610.1083/jcb.200709161Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). We investigated if Merlin C-terminal domain may interfere with the binding of α-tubulin to the FERM domain of ezrin. α-Tubulin was coprecipitated with GFP-ezrin in the presence or absence of Merlin C-terminal AA domain. As expected, Merlin C-terminal AA domain co-immunoprecipitated with GFP-ezrin (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, its expression stimulated the binding of α-tubulin to GFP-ezrin. Actin binding to ezrin was also stimulated under these conditions. Actin binds to the C-terminal end of ezrin and our result suggests that the interaction of Merlin C-terminal domain with ezrin may lead to a change in ezrin conformation, exposing both the FERM and C-terminal domains for interaction (Fig. 5A). To better understand the dynamics of Merlin and ezrin mutual interaction and with α-tubulin during mitosis, we evaluated their phosphorylation state during M to G1 transition following nocodazole block release in HeLa cells. The re-entry into G1 was followed by FACS (Fig. 5B) and the progression from metaphase to anaphase and telophase was followed by immunofluorescence and DAPI staining. We noticed that the kinetics of phosphorylation of Ser-518 and Thr-581 of Merlin are different. Ser-518 phosphorylation shows a pronounced decrease at the onset of anaphase and upon G1 entry and parallels Aurora A expression. Thr-581 phosphorylation dropped later corresponding to G1 entry. This could be a direct consequence of our observation showing that the phosphorylation of Ser-518 facilitates Thr-581 modification. In contrast, Thr-567 phosphorylation of ezrin, which leads to a more open conformation, was low in metaphase but reached a maximum 2 h after release, corresponding to a strong enrichment of cells in telophase. Then, the signal decreased strongly upon G1 entry (Fig. 5B). It is well-established that Thr-567 phosphorylation of ezrin stimulates its binding to actin (32Fievet B.T. Gautreau A. Roy C. Del Maestro L. Mangeat P. Louvard D. Arpin M. Phosphoinositide binding and phosphorylation act sequentially in the activation mechanism of ezrin.J.

https://openalex.org/W2958702570,"Gene manipulation and epitope tagging are essential tools for understanding the molecular function of specific genes. The opportunistic human pathogen Candida albicans is a diploid fungus that utilizes a non-canonical genetic code. Since selection markers available in this organism are scarce, several tools based on recyclable markers have been developed for gene disruption, such as the Clox system. This system relies on the Cre recombinase, which recycles selection markers flanked by loxP sites with high efficiency, facilitating single marker or multi-marker recycling. However, PCR-based modules for epitope tagging, such the pFA-modules, mainly use limited non-recyclable auxotrophic markers. To solve this problem, we have used a Gibson assembly strategy to construct a set of new plasmids where the auxotrophic markers of the pFA vectors were swapped with five recyclable marker modules of the Clox system, enhancing the versatility of the pFA plasmids. This new toolkit, named pFA-Clox, is composed of 36 new vectors for gene disruption and epitope tagging (GFP, 3xGFP, mCherry, 3xHA, 5xmyc and TAP). These plasmids contain the dominant NAT1 marker, as well as URA3, HIS1 and ARG4 cassettes, thereby permitting functional analysis of laboratory strains as well as clinical isolates of C. albicans. In summary, we have adapted the Clox system to the pFA-backbone vectors. Thus, the set of primers used for the amplification of previously published pFA modules can also be utilized in this new pFA-Clox system. Therefore, this new toolkit harbors the advantages of both systems, allowing accelerated gene modification strategies that could reduce time and costs in strain construction for C. albicans."

Horse owners (n = 141) documented their travel patterns with their horse(s) (n = 330) by completing monthly online questionnaires between May and November 2015.

A variety of location types were included in each monthly network, with many including non-facilities such as parks, trails, and private farms. Only 34.3% of competitions attended by participants during the study period were regulated by an official equestrian organisation. Comparisons of the similarity between monthly networks indicated that participants did not travel to the same locations each month, and the most connected locations varied between consecutive months. While the findings should not be generalized to the wider horse population, they have provided greater insight into the nature and extent of observed horse movement patterns. The results support the need to better understand the variety of locations to which horses can travel in Ontario, as different types of locations may have different associated risks of disease introduction and spread."

This study aimed to formulate a nomogram to predict the prognosis of young adult HCC patients.Young adult patients diagnosed with HCC from 2004 to 2015 were screened from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Based on the multivariate analysis results, a nomogram was constructed. The concordance index (c-index) and calibration were used to assess the predictive performance of the nomogram. The clinical benefit was measured by using decision curve analysis (DCA).The mean follow-up time of the patients was 25.0±34.0 months. Gender, race, AFP level, Edmondson-Steiner classification, treatment and TNM stage were selected as independent prognostic factors and integrated into the nomogram. The c-indexes of the two sets were 0.786 and 0.775, respectively. The calibration curves showed good agreement between the nomogram-predicted probability and the actual observations. Furthermore, the DCA indicated that the nomogram had positive net benefits compared with the conventional staging system.The nomogram could accurately predict the prognosis of young adult HCC patients."
https://openalex.org/W2959642454,"Phototrophic cyanobacteria are limited in growth locations by their need for visible light and must also cope with intermittent ultraviolet radiation (UVR), especially in extreme environments such as deserts and on early Earth. One survival method for cyanobacteria is growing endolithically within minerals such as micas, gypsum, and quartz minerals. However, the capability of different mica minerals to protect cyanobacteria from UVR, while at the same time allowing transmission of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), has only been minimally examined. In this study, we performed laboratory incubation experiments to demonstrate that a model filamentous cyanobacterium, Leptolyngbya sp., can colonize micas, such as muscovite, phlogopite, and biotite. After inoculation experiments confirmed that these cyanobacteria grew between the sheets of mica, Leptolyngbya sp. colonies were exposed to UVB and UVC for up to 24 hrs, and the level of survival was determined using chlorophyll a and carotenoid assays. Of the three micas investigated, muscovite, being an Fe-poor and Al-rich mica, provided the least attenuation of UVR, however it transmitted the most visible light. Fe-rich biotite provided the best UVR shielding. Phlogopite, apparently because of its intermediate amount of Fe, showed the greatest ability to shield UVR while still transmitting an adequate amount of visible light, making it the ideal habitat for the cyanobacterium. Upon exposure to UVR, significant shifts in several important fatty acids of the cyanobacterium were detected such as linolenic acid and oleic acid, 18:3ω3 and 18:1ω9c, respectively. These cellular changes are interpreted to be a consequence of UVR and other accessory stress (such as O3)."
https://openalex.org/W2956909555,"Transcriptional regulator KAISO plays a critical role in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through modulation of p53 acetylation by histone acetyltransferase p300. KAISO potently stimulates apoptosis in cells expressing WT p53, but not in p53-mutant or p53-null cells. Here, we investigated how KAISO transcription is regulated by p53, finding four potential p53-binding sites (p53-responsive DNA elements; p53REs) located in a distal 5'-upstream regulatory element, intron 1, exon 2 coding sequence, and a 3'-UTR region. Transient transcription assays of pG5-p53RE-Luc constructs with various p53REs revealed that p53 activates KAISO (ZBTB33) transcription by acting on p53RE1 (-4326 to -4227) of the 5'-upstream region and on p53RE3 (+2929 to +2959) of the exon 2 coding region during early DNA damage responses (DDRs). ChIP and oligonucleotide pulldown assays further disclosed that p53 binds to the p53RE1 and p53RE3 sites. Moreover, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) or ATM-Rad3-related (ATR) kinase-mediated p53 phosphorylation at Ser-15 or Ser-37 residues activated KAISO transcription by binding its p53RE1 or p53RE3 sites during early DDR. p53RE1 uniquely contained three p53-binding half-sites, a structural feature important for transcriptional activation by phosphorylated p53 Ser-15·Ser-37. During the later DDR phase, a KAISO-mediated acetylated p53 form (represented by a p53QRQ acetyl-mimic) robustly activated transcription by acting on p53RE1 in which this structural feature is not significant, but it provided sufficient KAISO levels to confer a p53 apoptotic code. These results suggest that the critical apoptosis regulator KAISO is a p53 target gene that is differently regulated by phosphorylated p53 or acetylated p53, depending on DDR stage."

However, a full spectrum of hand function examination is absent. Therefore, this study aimed to classify the hand sensorimotor functions of the chronic kidney disease patients using the novel sensorimotor assessment tools, manual tactile test (MTT) and pinch-holding-up activity (PHUA) test, and explore the feasibility in comparison with traditional evaluations in the clinical practice. 68 stage-5 chronic kidney disease patients and 50 healthy subjects were recruited in this study. A series of conventional evaluations and two novel hand function tools, manual tactile test and pinch-holding-up activity test were conducted from the perspective of hand dexterity, sensory input threshold, force generation and sensorimotor control. Independent t-test was used to find out group differences and the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to determine accuracy of the tests. In our results, significant reduction of hand dexterity, sensory input, force generation and sensorimotor control was found in patients from an overall perspective. This trend was discovered to be the same when dividing the subjects into the old and young age group. From the receiver operator characteristic curves, nearly all the areas under the curve of all tests were over 0.8. The novel evaluation tools, the manual tactile test and pinch-holding-up activity, were found to have comparable or even better accuracy than the traditional ones. The shape and weight subtests of the manual tactile test displayed the highest accuracy. To sum up, by incorporating the novel and conventional assessment tests, this study built up the fundamental understanding of the hand functions in multiple dimensions and consolidate the clinical merits of applying the two novel tools, manual tactile test and pinch-holding-up activity, on chronic kidney disease patients."
https://openalex.org/W2958511545,"Lack of homogeneity in the product (LHP) is a problem when customers require homogeneous units of a single product. In such cases, the optimal allocation of inventory to orders becomes much more complex. Furthermore, in an MTS environment, an optimal initial allocation may become less than ideal over time, due to different circumstances. This problem occurs in the ceramics sector, where the final product varies in tone and calibre. This paper proposes a methodology for the reallocation of inventory to orders in LHP situation (MERIO-LHP) and a model-based decision-support system (DSS) to support the methodology, which enables an optimal reallocation of inventory to order lines to be carried out in real businesses environments in which LHP is inherent. The proposed methodology and model-based DSS were validated by applying it to a real case at a ceramics company. The analysis of the results indicates that considerable improvements can be obtained with regard to the quantity of orders fulfilled and sales turnover."
https://openalex.org/W2959617015,"Cancer patients are at higher risk of tuberculosis (TB) infection, especially in hospital settings with high TB/HIV burden. The study was implemented among adult patients admitted to the largest tertiary-level referral hospital in Botswana. We estimated the TB prevalence at admission and the rate of newly diagnosed TB after hospitalization in the medical and oncology wards, separately. Presumptive TB cases were identified at admission through symptom screening and underwent the diagnostic evaluation through GeneXpert. Patients with no evidence of TB were followed-up until TB diagnosis or the end of the study. In the medical and oncology wards, four of 867 admitted patients and two of 240 had laboratory-confirmed TB at admission (prevalence = 461.4 and 833.3 per 100,000, respectively.) The post-admission TB rate from the medical wards was 28.3 cases per 1,000 person-year during 424.5 follow-up years (post-admission TB rate among HIV-positive versus. -negative = 54.1 and 9.8 per 1,000 person-year, respectively [Rate Ratio = 5.5]). No post-admission TB case was detected from the oncology ward. High rates of undetected TB at admission at both medical and oncology wards, and high rate of newly diagnosed TB after admission at medical wards suggest that TB screening and diagnostic evaluation should target all patients admitted to a hospital in high-burden settings."
https://openalex.org/W2962116267,"Hepcidin is an iron regulatory peptide hormone that is secreted from hepatocytes and inhibits iron efflux from tissues to plasma. Under inflammatory conditions, hepcidin is transcriptionally induced by IL-6/STAT3 signaling and promotes hypoferremia, an innate immune response to infection. If this pathway remains unresolved, chronic overexpression of hepcidin contributes to the anemia of inflammation, a common medical condition. Previous work showed that carbon monoxide (CO) releasing drugs (CORMs) can attenuate inflammatory induction of hepcidin. Because CO is physiologically generated during heme degradation by heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), an IL-6-inducible enzyme with anti-inflammatory properties, we hypothesized that hepatocellular HO-1 may operate as a physiological feedback regulator of hepcidin that resolves inflammatory signaling. To address this, we generated and analyzed hepatocyte-specific HO-1 knockout (Hmox1Alb-Cre) mice. We show that these animals mount appropriate hepcidin-mediated hypoferremic response to LPS-induced inflammation, with kinetics similar to those of control Hmox1fl/fl mice. Likewise, primary hepatocytes from Hmox1Alb-Cre and Hmox1fl/fl mice exhibit similar degree and kinetics of hepcidin induction following IL-6 treatment. We conclude that hepatocellular HO-1 has no physiological function on hepcidin regulation by the inflammatory pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2956509838,"Deprivation of maternal care via lack of somatosensory input causes offspring to experience adverse consequences, especially in the central nervous system. However, little is known about the developmental effect of maternal care on peripheral tissues such as the skin, which includes cutaneous sensory neurons. In the present study, we examined the involvement of maternal care in the development of the skin. We investigated offspring reared by early-weaned mother mice who spontaneously showed lower frequency of licking/grooming on nursing. Offspring of early-weaned mothers showed higher resistance against skin barrier disruption than did offspring of normally-weaned mothers, and had normal skin barrier function in the intact trunk skin. In the dorsal root ganglion of early-weaned mother offspring, we also found up-regulation of mRNA levels of the Mas-related G-protein coupled receptor B4 (MrgprB4), which is a marker of sensory neurons that detect gentle stroking. We further found that levels of MrgprB4 mRNA were correlated with the enhancement of skin resistance. The present findings suggest that maternal somatosensory inputs have a developmental impact on the cutaneous sensory neurons of the skin in offspring. Interestingly, the present results suggest that lower maternal care has a benefit on the skin resistance. This provides important information for understanding the development of peripheral tissues in offspring reared under severe conditions such as lower maternal care in the wild."

They rapidly respond to antigen challenge and can activate both innate and adaptive immune cells. To study the role of antigen presentation in NKT cell activation, previous studies have developed several anti-CD1d antibodies that block CD1d binding to T-cell receptors (TCRs). Antibodies that are specific to both CD1d and the presented antigen can only be used to study the function of only a limited number of antigens. In contrast, antibodies that bind CD1d and block TCR binding regardless of the presented antigen can be widely used to assess the role of TCR-mediated NKT cell activation in various disease models. Here, we report the crystal structure of the widely used anti-mouse CD1d antibody 1B1 bound to CD1d at a resolution of 2.45 Å and characterized its binding to CD1d-presented glycolipids. We observed that 1B1 uses a long hydrophobic H3 loop that is inserted deep into the binding groove of CD1d where it makes intimate nonpolar contacts with the lipid backbone of an incorporated spacer lipid. Using an NKT cell agonist that has a modified sphingosine moiety, we further demonstrate that 1B1 in its monovalent form cannot block TCR-mediated NKT cell activation, because 1B1 fails to bind with high affinity to mCD1d.

The different headgroups of the various glycolipids are exposed at or above the CD1d-binding groove for TCR recognition. NKT cells generally recognize the exposed headgroup and a few polar groups of the lipid backbone. Type I NKT cells maintain a conserved binding footprint centered over the F′ pocket of CD1d, whereas the sulfatide-restricted Type II NKT cell clone XV19 binds over the A′ pocket (29Borg N.A.

Both TCRs contact their antigens from the side with only one chain, TCRα for Type I and TCRβ for Type II NKT cells. There is no overlap in the mCD1d-binding footprint between Type I NKT cells and the XV19 Type II NKT cell clone. The anti-mCD1d antibody 1B1 is able to block both TCR-mediated activation of Type I and Type II NKT cells, suggesting it has an overlapping binding site with the TCRs from both NKT cell subsets. However, because the glycolipid is presented in the center of the CD1d-binding groove between both TCR-binding sites this raises the questions as to how 1B1 is able to bind mCD1d and compete with both TCRs, whereas not being impacted by the presented glycolipid. To understand how 1B1 binds to mCD1d and blocks both Type I and Type II NKT cell activation, we assessed the binding of 1B1 to CD1d presenting different glycolipids using surface plasmon resonance studies. We have further assessed the ability of 1B1 Fab and 1B1 IgG in blocking Type I and Type II NKT cell responses toward different lipid antigens and determined the crystal structure of 1B1 Fab bound to mCD1d at a resolution of 2.45 Å. We have generated 1B1 Fab by papain digestions and formed complexes with insect cell-expressed mCD1d that was either loaded with αGalCer or not incubated with a particular lipid. Whereas we were able to obtain crystals of the complex, we were not able to obtain a diffraction dataset beyond 3.9 Å. Therefore, we have generated 1B1 Fab recombinantly in SF9 insect cells, to limit heterogeneity introduced during the papain digestion. We have further generated mCD1d via refolding to avoid the presence of N-linked glycans. Because mCD1d contains an unpaired cysteine at the bottom of the A′ pocket (Cys-12), we first replaced this residue against serine (mCD1d C12S). We formed complexes of all possible combinations of the 4 proteins (2 Fab and 2 mCD1d) and finally obtained high quality diffracting crystals for the complex consisting of refolded mCD1d and the insect cell expressed 1B1 Fab. To determine the structural basis of how 1B1 blocks NKT cell activation, we have determined the crystal structure of the 1B1/Fab-mCD1d complex to 2.45 Å resolution (Table 1, Fig. 1). CD1d forms the typical heterodimeric arrangement in which the CD1d heavy chain noncovalently associates with β2-microglobulin. However, because CD1d has been refolded, no N-linked glycans are present in the structure. In addition, during refolding, three spacer molecules have been incorporated into CD1d to stabilize the hydrophobic pocket. Two molecules are incorporated into the larger A′ pocket and one into the F′ pocket of CD1d (Fig. 1). Based on the extent of the observed electron density, we modeled three C16 alkyl-chains, which mimic the position of the alkyl-chains generally associated with glycolipid antigens (Fig. 2).Table 1Data collection and refinement statisticsmCD1d/1B1 complexData collection statisticsPDB IDSpace groupC2221Cell dimensiona, b, c, (Å)84.1, 161.0, 165.4α = β = γ (°)90.00Resolution range (Å)40.0–2.45(outer shell)(2.54–2.45)No. of unique reflections41,732 (4,082)Rmeas (%)8.1 (62.0)Rpim (%)3.1 (25.0)Multiplicity6.6 (5.9)Average I/σ19.1 (1.8)Completeness (%)99.7 (98.5)Refinement statisticsNo. atoms6,530Protein6,337Water141Sodium4Ligand48Ramachandran plot (%)Favored95.2Allowed99.7Outliers0.3Root mean square deviationsBonds (Å)0.005Angles (°)1.37B-factors (Å2)Protein59.6Water49.1Sodium50.6Ligand52.8R factor (%)20.9Rfree (%)24.4 Open table in a new tab Figure 2CDR H3 of 1B1 contacts the spacer lipid.

The majority of contacts are formed between the H chain and CD1d. The H chain uses 575 Å2 and the L chain 45 Å2 of protein surface and together they contact 610 Å2 of CD1d (Table 2). A single contact is formed between CDR L1 residue Tyr-31 and CD1d Glu-83, whereas the H chain binding is dominated by hydrophobic contacts (Table 3). Only H2 and H3 participate in CD1d binding and together they form three hydrogen bonds and two salt bridges. H2:Asp55 forms both a salt bridge and H bond with Lys-148 of CD1d, whereas H3:Arg-109 forms a salt bridge with Asp-80 of CD1d, H3:Gly-105 forms a H bond with Asp-153, and Leu-106 forms a H bond with Asp-80. A characteristic feature of the interaction between 1B1 Fab and CD1d is an elongated H3 loop that inserts into the F′ pocket of CD1d like a hydrophobic finger and forms many hydrophobic contacts with surrounding CD1d residues (Figure 1, Figure 2, Table 3). The H3 loop has two tyrosine residues (Tyr-103 and Tyr-104) that extend outward and slightly upwards from this finger and together appear to dictate how far the loop inserts into the binding groove of CD1d (Fig. 2B). Surprisingly, the H3 loop is also in close contact with one of the spacer molecules that mimics the position of the sphingosine chain of glycolipids, such as sulfatide or αGalCer (Fig. 2). H3:Tyr-104, Gly-105, and Leu-106 each form one VDW contact with the spacer lipid, but the overall intimate binding position of H3 leads to a combined total buried surface interface of 212 Å2.Table 2Comparison of Fab/TCR-mCD1d-glycolipid contactsIndividual buried surface areas within the ternary complexes (BSA in Å2)1B1-endogenous lipid/mCD1daValues are calculated using PISA (58).L363-C20:2-αGalCer/mCD1daValues are calculated using PISA (58).,bValues from Ref. 43.Vα14Vβ8.2TCR- C20:2-αGalCer-mCD1daValues are calculated using PISA (58).,bValues from Ref. 43.mCD1d610710680Glycolipid110160150Fab VL/TCR Vα50410660Fab VH/TCR Vβ580470170Fab/TCR-CD1d1,4301,6101,600a Values are calculated using PISA (58Krissinel E.

Med. 2005; 202 (16314439): 1517-152610.1084/jem.20051625Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar)), we notice that the H3 loop of 1B1 is very close to sulfatide, especially to the C4″-OH of the galactose (Fig. 2B). Therefore, we wanted to test the impact of 1B1 binding to CD1d that presents glycolipids with different sizes of headgroups. We chose sulfatide and GT1b as model antigens, because they are negatively charged and their loading efficiency can be visualized. Because 1B1 binds to CD1d without presenting a given lipid, we needed to achieve a near to 100% loading efficiency to avoid having an overlapping binding response contributed by unloaded CD1d molecules. After glycolipid loading, both sulfatide and GT1b bind 100% to CD1d (Fig. 2C) and we used these complexes for surface plasmon resonance studies with the 1B1 Fab (Fig. 3D). However, the binding affinity of 1B1 to mCD1d is nearly identical in all three analyzed CD1d-lipid complexes, suggesting that variations in the glycolipid headgroups can be accommodated by 1B1 and do not affect its binding affinity toward CD1d. 1B1 Fab binds with a KD of ∼12.5 nm calculated from an association rate (kon) of 5.4–6.1 × 105 and a dissociation rate (koff) of 6.2–7.3 × 10−3 (Fig. 2C). When we compared the binding site of 1B1 with that of the Vα14Vβ8.2 TCR of iNKT cells, we noticed a similar footprint on CD1d (Figs. 1E, 3, and 4). Although 1B1 binds perpendicular across the F′ pocket of CD1d, the TCR binds parallel along both α-helices (Fig. 1E). In addition, whereas TCR binding seems to be dominated by the CDR3α region, 1B1 uses its elongated H3 loop to form the majority of contacts. In both molecules, a hydrophobic finger, Leu-99α of the TCR and Leu-106H of the antibody, binds at the F′ pocket of CD1d. In striking contrast, however, 1B1 inserts its hydrophobic finger much deeper into the F′ pocket, compared with the TCR (Fig. 3A). That results in a different binding mode. Although the TCR sits above the F′ pocket and binds to the F′ roof, the antibody prevents F′ roof formation and instead sits as a wedge inside the F′ pocket (Fig. 2, B–D). In fact, CDR3α of the TCR flattens out at the tip and hovers above CD1d, whereas the H3 loop is straight and reaches into the CD1d binding groove (Fig. 3, C and D). The deep location of the H3 loop raises the question whether the nature of the lipid chain that is bound inside the F′ pocket can impact 1B1 binding. Although common dual alkyl-chain–based lipids, such as αGalCer are nestled underneath Leu-106H of 1B1, lipids containing modifications could potentially impact 1B1 binding. We chose a modified lipid αGSA[26,P5p], and superimposed its crystal structure (PDB ID 6C6F) with the CD1d/1B1 structure. Leu-106H is very close to the phenyl group contained in the modified sphingamide chain (2.4 Å). We then analyzed the ability of 1B1 (both Fab and IgG) to block NKT cell activation by various glycolipids. We loaded antigens for both Type I and Type II NKT cells into mCD1d and performed a NKT cell hybridoma activation assay using the NKT hybridomas 1.2 (Type I) and XV19 (Type II) in the presence or absence of the TCR blocking antibody 1B1 (Fig. 4). A 1B1 dose titration demonstrated that the activation of both Type I and Type II NKT cells by αGalCer and sulfatide can be fully blocked with both 1B1 Fab and 1B1 IgG. 1B1 Fab appears to block Type I NKT cell activation at a lower dose (15.6 μg/ml) compared with Type II NKT cells (100 μg/ml), whereas 1B1 IgG blocks both hybridoma activation at the lowest dose used in this assay (1.5 μg/ml, equivalent to the equimolar ratio with CD1d). Using a structure-guided approach, we generated the 1B1 Fab Y103K/I56S double mutant, which does not bind mouse or human"
