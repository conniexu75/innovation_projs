https://openalex.org/W2077657292,"The cellular form of the prion protein (PrPc) is a glycoprotein anchored to the cell membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol moiety. An aberrant form of PrPc that is partially resistant to proteases, PrPres, is a hallmark of prion diseases, which in humans include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome, and fatal familial insomnia. We have characterized the major forms of PrP in normal and pathological human brains. A COOH-terminal fragment of PrPc, designated C1, is abundant in normal and CJD brains as well as in human neuroblastoma cells. Sequence analysis revealed that C1 contains alternative NH2 termini starting at His-111 or Met-112. Like PrPc, C1 is glycosylated, anchored to the cell membrane, and is heat-stable. Consistent with the lack of the NH2-terminal region of PrPc, C1 is more acidic than PrPc and does not bind heparin. An additional fragment longer than C1, designated C2, is present in substantial amounts in CJD brains. Like PrPres, C2 is resistant to proteases and is detergent-insoluble. Our data indicate that C1 is a major product of normal PrPc metabolism, generated by a cleavage that disrupts the neurotoxic and amyloidogenic region of PrP comprising residues 106-126. This region remains intact in C2, suggesting a role for C2 in prion diseases.

A chicken homologue of mammalian PrPc has been shown to recycle between the plasma membrane and an endosomal compartment with concurrent generation of truncated PrPc intermediates (23Harris D.A.

An aberrant isoform of PrP, PrPres, characterized by relative resistance to proteolysis and by insolubility in nondenaturing detergents, is a hallmark of the prion diseases, which include familial, transmitted, and sporadic forms of neurodegenerative disorders such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome, kuru, and fatal familial insomnia in humans and scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy in animals (for reviews, see Prusiner(1991) and 46Prusiner S.B. DeArmond S.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 311-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Studies using scrapie-infected mouse neuroblastoma cells suggest that PrPres is formed from PrPc, either at the cell surface (7Caughey B. Raymond G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18217-18223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or along the endocytic pathway (4Borchelt D.R. Taraboulos A. Prusiner S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6188-6199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since there are no detectable differences in primary structure between the two PrP isoforms (56Stahl N. Baldwin M.A. Teplow D.B. Hood L. Gibson B.W. Burlingame A.L. Prusiner S.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1991-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), the formation of PrPres is thought to result from the conversion of PrPc to PrPres through a conformational transition. Consistent with this notion is the difference in secondary structure between PrPc and PrPres: PrPc is rich in α-helices, while PrPres has a higher content of β-pleated sheets (10Caughey B.W. Dong A.

In a recent study, 29Kocisko D.A. Come J.H. Priola S.A. Chesebro B. Raymond G.J. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Caughey B.

The molecular mechanism that leads to this conversion and to subsequent prion replication remains unclear. An essential step toward the complete clarification of the conversion of PrPc to PrPres is the detailed knowledge of PrPc metabolism. In this study, we have characterized the PrP forms present in normal and pathological human brains and in neuroblastoma cells. Using epitope mapping and radiosequencing, we have demonstrated the presence of truncated forms of PrPc under normal conditions, in addition to full-length PrPc. Moreover, an additional NH2-terminally truncated fragment that is insoluble in detergents and resistant to protease is present in the brains of subjects with prion diseases. The following antibodies were used: anti-N, a rabbit antiserum to a synthetic peptide corresponding to human PrP residues 23-40 (B. Ghetti, Indiana University); α90-104, a rabbit antiserum to a synthetic peptide corresponding to hamster PrP residues 90-104 (M. Shinagawa, Obihiro University of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine, Obihiro, Japan); 3F4, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes an epitope of human PrP residues 109-112 (R. Kascsak, New York State Institute for Basic Research in Developmental Disabilities); and anti-C, a rabbit antiserum to synthetic human PrP residues 220-231 (39Monari L. Chen S.G. Brown P. Parchi P. Petersen R.B. Mikol J. Gray F. Cortelli P. Montagna P. Ghetti B. Goldfarb L.G. Gajdusek D.C. Lugaresi E. Gambetti P. Autilio-Gambetti L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2839-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Tissues were obtained at autopsy from seven histologically normal brains from subjects free of neurological diseases (mean age of 66 years, range of 44-84 years; post-mortem interval of 4-14 h) and from four brains from subjects with sporadic CJD confirmed by histological examination and the presence of PrPres (mean age of 65 years, range of 52-75 years; post-mortem interval of 9-17 h). Tissues were also obtained from two histologically normal human brain biopsies performed for diagnostic purposes. All tissues were frozen as soon as collected and stored at −80°C. All tissue preparations were carried out at 4°C in the presence of protease inhibitors (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 3 mM EDTA), unless otherwise indicated. Brain homogenate was prepared as described previously (39Monari L. Chen S.G. Brown P. Parchi P. Petersen R.B. Mikol J. Gray F. Cortelli P. Montagna P. Ghetti B. Goldfarb L.G. Gajdusek D.C. Lugaresi E. Gambetti P. Autilio-Gambetti L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2839-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Tissues from the cerebral cortex were extracted in 9 volumes of lysis buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5). Prior to immunoblot analysis, the total brain homogenates were mixed with an equal volume of 2 × electrophoresis sample buffer (6% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 4 mM EDTA, 20% glycerol, 125 mM Tris, pH 6.8) and boiled for 10 min. A 10% (w/v) homogenate was prepared in 0.32 M sucrose, 5 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5. After centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min, the postnuclear supernatant (S1) was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to obtain a cytosolic fraction (S2) and a membrane fraction (P2). To release GPI-anchored membrane proteins, the P2 fraction was resuspended in a hypotonic buffer (20 mM Tris, 2 mM EDTA, pH 7.5). The sample was then adjusted to 20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, pH 7.5 (TNE buffer), and incubated for 2 h at 37°C with 1 unit/ml recombinant Bacillus thuringiensis phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PIPLC) purified according to 16Deeg M.A. Humphrey D.R.

The mixture was then diluted with 10 volumes of TNE buffer and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to separate PIPLC-released proteins (supernatant) from the rest of the membrane components (pellet). To examine the detergent solubility and protease resistance of PrP in normal and CJD brains, the membrane fraction (P2) was resuspended in lysis buffer (without protease inhibitors) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g to obtain detergent-soluble (supernatant) and detergent-insoluble (pellet) fractions. Protease treatment was carried out by incubation of samples in lysis buffer with 10 μg/ml proteinase K at 37°C for 1 h. The human neuroblastoma cell line M17 BE(2)-C (kindly provided by B. Spengler and J. Biedler, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York) was maintained at 37°C in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% calf serum and antibiotics. The medium was changed twice a week. Cells were differentiated by addition of 5 μM retinoic acid to the medium for 7-10 days until long neurites were formed. To release PrP from the cell surface, cells on 150-mm (148-cm2) dishes with 80% confluence were incubated in 10 ml of serum-free Opti-MEM containing 0.2 unit/ml PIPLC for 8-12 h. After addition of protease inhibitors, the medium was collected, clarified by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min, and stored at −20°C. In general, 0.3 ml of the medium (10 μg of protein) was used for a single lane of SDS-PAGE unless stated otherwise. The medium (0.5 ml) of PIPLC-treated cells was incubated with 30 μl of heparin-agarose beads (Sigma, type I-A) at room temperature for 1 h, followed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 3 min. Proteins bound to heparin were eluted by boiling the beads in 1% SDS for 10 min. The culture medium containing PIPLC-released proteins was adjusted to 2 mM dithiothreitol, 100 mM Tris, pH 7.5, containing protease inhibitors. The mixture was boiled for 15 min, followed by cooling on ice for 1 h. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min, the heat-stable (supernatant) and heat-unstable (pellet) fractions were obtained. Proteins were precipitated from the medium of PIPLC-treated cells with 4 volumes of methanol for 2 h at −20°C. Following centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min, the pellet was denatured by boiling for 5 min in 0.5% SDS, 1%β-mercaptoethanol, 25 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5. After addition of Nonidet P-40 to 1%, Asn-linked oligosaccharides were removed by incubation with recombinant PNGase F at 37°C for 2 h as specified by the supplier (New England Biolabs Inc.). Protein samples were separated by 14% SDS-PAGE (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) or by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (NEPHGE gel) (42O'Farrell P.Z. Goodman H.M. O'Farrell P.H. Cell. 1977; 12: 1133-1142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2583) Google Scholar). Proteins were then transferred to Immobilon P (Millipore Corp.) for 2 h at 60 V using a mini-transblot cell (Bio-Rad). After blocking with 10% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, blots were probed with the appropriate antibodies. The immunoreactivity was visualized on Kodak X-Omat film by enhanced chemiluminescence as specified by the manufacturer (Amersham Corp.). Quantitation of the immunoblots was performed using a computer-assisted laser densitometric scanner (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Twenty ml of the medium from PIPLC-treated cells were concentrated to 1 ml with a Centriprep 10 device (Amicon, Inc.). The heat-stable fraction prepared as described above was injected into a polymer-based reverse-phase HPLC column (type PLRP-S, 300 Å, 2.5 mm (inner diameter) × 250 mm, Polymer Laboratories). The column was equilibrated in buffer A (1% acetonitrile, 20 mM Tris, 10 mM betaine HCl, pH 8.2) and eluted with a gradient of 0-95% buffer B (70% acetonitrile, 20 mM Tris, 10 mM betaine HCl, pH 8.2) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The fractions reacting with anti-C on immunoblots were pooled and vacuum-concentrated using a SpeedVac (Savant Instruments, Inc.). After resuspending in 0.5% SDS, the sample was iodinated with 0.5 mCi of carrier-free Na125I (DuPont NEN) in a 12 × 75-mm glass tube coated with 20 μg of IODO-GEN (Pierce) for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by transferring the solution to a microcentrifuge tube containing 2 mM dithiothreitol, followed by freezing at −80°C. Immunoprecipitation was performed essentially as described (53Stahl N. Borchelt D.R. Hsiao K. Prusiner S.B. Cell. 1987; 51: 229-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). In brief, 125I-labeled proteins were precipitated with 4 volumes of methanol for 2 h at −20°C. Following centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C, the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of 10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Sarkosyl, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5 (TNS buffer). After addition of 50 μl of 5% bovine serum albumin and 5 μl of anti-C, the mixture was incubated at 4°C for 12-15 h, followed by incubation with 30 μl (packed volume) of protein A-agarose (Zymed Laboratories, Inc.) for 1 h at room temperature. The protein A beads were washed five times with TNS buffer (pH adjusted to 8.2) and then once with Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5. Immunoprecipitated radioactive samples were deglycosylated with PNGase F and loaded onto 14% SDS-PAGE mini-gels (Bio-Rad) with 0.1 mM sodium thioglycolate in the cathode chamber. Proteins were transferred to Problott membrane (Applied Biosystems Inc.) for 2 h at 60 V at 4°C. The membrane was then rinsed with distilled H2O and air-dried. After visualization of 125I-labeled proteins on Kodak X-Omat film, the bands of interest were excised and stored at −70°C until sequencing. Radiosequence analysis was performed by cutting the sample strips into pieces of ~1 mm2 in area and then loading them on top of Polybrene-coated trifluoroacetic acid-treated glass-fiber filters (Applied Biosystems Inc.). Automated Edman chemistry was carried out on an Applied Biosystems Model 475A instrument essentially as described by the manufacturer, except that anilinothiazolinone-derivatives were collected without being converted into phenythiohydantoins. Anilinothiazolinone-derivative samples were counted in a Packard Cobra series γ-counter. PrPc and the regions recognized by the antibodies used in this study are shown diagrammatically in Fig. 1A. Immunoblots of normal brain tissues showed a major PrPc band of 35 kDa that reacted with antibodies specific for epitopes located in the NH2-terminal (anti-N), COOH-terminal (anti-C), and middle (3F4) regions of PrPc (Fig. 1B). Some of the faster migrating bands of 26-30 kDa reacted only with antibodies anti-C and 3F4, but not with anti-N (Fig. 1B, lanes 1-3). Tissue homogenates were treated with PNGase F to reduce the heterogeneity of the PrPc bands due to the presence of Asn-linked oligosaccharides. Enzymatic deglycosylation resulted in a PrPc band of 27 kDa (Fig. 1B, lanes 4-6), which is consistent with the molecular mass of GPI-containing, deglycosylated full-length PrPc (22Haraguchi T. Fisher S. Olofsson S. Endo T. Groth D. Tarantino A. Borchelt D.R. Teplow D. Hood L. Burlingame A. Lycke E. Kobata A. Prusiner S.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 274: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). An additional prominent band of 18 kDa, which we have named C1, was recognized by anti-C (Fig. 1B, lane6), while 3F4 immunoreacted with a faint band of ~21 kDa (lane5). Neither of these PrPc fragments was recognized by anti-N (Fig. 1B, lane4), indicating that both are NH2-terminal truncated forms of PrPc. These findings were confirmed with fresh brain tissues obtained by biopsy in the presence of various protease inhibitors such as tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and leupeptin (data not shown). Absorption of anti-N and anti-C was carried out with respective synthetic peptide antigens. No bands were detected in immunoblots with either anti-N (Fig. 1C, first and secondlanes) or anti-C (ninth and tenth lanes) following the absorption. The specificity of 3F4 immunoreactivity has been established (28Kascsak R.J. Rubenstein R. Merz P.A. Tonna-DeMasi M. Fersko R. Carp R.I. Wisniewski H.M. Diringer H. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3688-3693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; 2Bolton D.C. Seligman S.J. Bablanian G. Windsor D. Scala L.J. Kim K.S. Chen C.M.J. Kascsak R.J. Bendheim P.E. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since C1 is recognized by anti-C but not by 3F4, the NH2-terminal PrPc region up to residue 109 must be absent in this fragment. C1 must be glycosylated since it is sensitive to PNGase F. Quantitation by densitometric analysis shows that the amount of C1 in the cerebral cortex of normal autopsy brains was 30-50% that of full-length PrPc, while the amount of the ~21-kDa band recognized by 3F4 (lane5 in Fig. 1B and the sixthlane in Fig. 1C) was <5%. Thus, C1 is present in normal human brain in substantial amounts. Since it is recognized by the anti-C antibody, C1 is likely to contain an intact COOH-terminal region and, like PrPc, to be anchored to the cell membrane. To investigate this issue, we obtained cytosolic and membrane fractions and probed them with the 3F4 and anti-C antibodies. Most of C1 and PrPc were recovered in the membrane fraction (Fig. 2A, P2), and both were released from the membrane fraction after treatment with PIPLC (Fig. 2B). Therefore, most of C1, like PrPc, is linked to the cell membrane by a GPI anchor. Small amounts of C1 and PrPc were also present in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 2A, S2). Both of these forms may represent PrPc molecules that have slowly lost their GPI linkage to the membrane as observed previously in primary cultures of neonatal hamster brain (5Borchelt D.R. Rogers M. Stahl N. Telling G. Prusiner S.B. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To determine whether C1 is a product of the normal cellular processing of PrPc and not an artifact generated during tissue preparation, we examined cell-surface expression of C1 in the human neuroblastoma cell line M17 BE(2)-C. Cells were grown in the absence or presence of retinoic acid (a differentiation agent), followed by treatment with PIPLC for 2 h to release GPI-anchored proteins. As shown in Fig. 3, immunoblot analysis revealed sets of heterogeneous bands of 28-35 kDa that were reactive with anti-C (lanes1 and 2) and 3F4 (lanes5 and 6). Deglycosylation with PNGase F (lanes3, 4, 7, and 8) resulted in the identification of 27-kDa PrPc recognized by both anti-C and 3F4 and of 18-kDa C1 recognized by anti-C (lanes3 and 4), but not by 3F4 (lanes7 and 8). No detectable C1 and PrPc were found in the medium if PIPLC treatment was omitted (data not shown). These data demonstrate that, consistent with our earlier findings in brains, C1 in cultured cells contains Asn-linked sugars and is anchored to the cell surface by a GPI linkage. Moreover, both C1 and PrPc increased in amount following retinoic acid-induced differentiation (lanes2, 4, 6, and 8). This agrees with the reported increase in PrPc gene expression during neuronal differentiation (60Wion D. Bert M.L. Brachet P. Int. J. Dev.

Since human PrPc is encoded by a single exon of a single copy gene on chromosome 20 (33Liao Y.-C. Lebo R.V. Clawson G.A. Smuckler E.A. Science. 1986; 233: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar; 47Puckett C. Concannon P. Casey C. Hood L. Am. J. Genet. 1991; 49: 320-329PubMed Google Scholar), C1 is likely to be a product of PrPc processing. The lack of C1 immunoreactivity with 3F4, whose epitope includes PrP residues 109-112, suggests that C1 is generated by a cleavage beyond residue 109. This cleavage may constitute an important event in normal PrPc metabolism. To characterize the exact cleavage site(s) in PrPc that generated C1, we partially purified C1 from the medium of PIPLC-treated cells by reverse-phase HPLC, radioiodinated Tyr residues of C1 with 125I and IODO-GEN, and performed NH2-terminal radiosequencing of C1. After radioiodination and SDS-PAGE, C1 appeared as a doublet of ~22 kDa (Fig. 4A, lane2). This shift in mobility is not surprising since incorporation of 125I into Tyr residues results in an increased mass of C1 and could produce additional mobility shifts due to perturbation in SDS binding. To characterize the doublet bands of C1 (designated as C1-upper and C1-lower, respectively), they were each subjected to NH2-terminal radiosequencing. The results show that both bands have the same NH2 termini. Both C1-upper and C1-lower produced major 125I peaks at cycles 17 and 18, consistent with C1 starting at either His-111 or Met-112 (Fig. 4B). Therefore, C1 is generated by an alternative cleavage around His-111 of PrPc. Since no apparent doublet is seen in unlabeled C1 (Fig. 4A, lane1), the observed 125I-C1 doublet may represent the same C1 molecules with anomalous behavior on SDS-PAGE due to radioiodination. To compare the biochemical properties of C1 to those of full-length PrPc present in cultured cells, we first examined the capacity of these two molecules to bind heparin. PrPc has been shown to interact with heparin and other glycosaminoglycans, which prevent the formation of PrPres (19Gabizon R. Meiner Z. Halimi M. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar; 8Caughey B. Raymond G.J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 634-650Google Scholar; 12Caughey B. Brown K. Raymond G.J. Katzenstein G.E. Thresher W. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2135-2141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows that at variance with PrPc (lane6), C1 did not bind heparin (lane4). The lack of the PrPc NH2-terminal region in C1 suggests that this region is important for heparin binding. Taking advantage of the different heparin binding characteristics of C1 and PrPc, we have attempted to clarify the changes in electrophoretic mobility of these two proteins following deglycosylation. It is clear that the 18-kDa deglycosylated C1 isoform stems from its 28-kDa glycoform (lanes3 and 4), while 27-kDa PrPc is derived from a glycosylated 35-kDa form (lanes5 and 6). The 8-10-kDa reduction in molecular mass for both C1 and PrPc following deglycosylation is consistent with the presence of two Asn-linked glycans at residues 181 and 197 (17Endo T. Groth D. Prusiner S.B. Kobata A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8380-8388Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar; 22Haraguchi T. Fisher S. Olofsson S. Endo T. Groth D. Tarantino A. Borchelt D.R. Teplow D.

We also studied the heat resistance of PrPc isolated from cultured cells. PIPLC-released proteins were boiled in the presence of protease inhibitors, followed by cooling and centrifugation to pellet the heat-sensitive protein aggregates. Both C1 and full-length PrPc were recovered in the supernatant as heat-stable proteins (Fig. 6, lanes3 and 4). In contrast, most of the other proteins were heat-sensitive and were recovered in the pellet. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of the PIPLC-released and deglycosylated proteins from neuroblastoma cells revealed that C1 and full-length Pr"

PPAR therefore occupies a key position in the transcriptional control of a pivotal enzyme controlling the channeling of fatty acids into various metabolic pathways. One of the general and essential features of cells is their ability to metabolize fatty acids. This process can occur via different pathways, depending on the nature of the cell and its metabolic requirements(1Groot P.H.E. Scholte H.R. Hulsman W.C. Adv. Lipid Res. 1976; 14: 75-126Google Scholar). Acyl-coenzymeA synthetases are crucial enzymes that facilitate the uptake (2Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Google Scholar) and permit the metabolism of intracellular lipids(3Yamamoto T. Fujino T. Abe T. Suzuki H. Prog. Obesity Res. 1990; : 219-224Google Scholar). In fact, these enzymes catalyze the first step of fatty acid metabolism by converting inactive fatty acids into active acyl CoA derivatives(3Yamamoto T. Fujino T. Abe T. Suzuki H. Prog. Obesity Res. 1990; : 219-224Google Scholar, 4Suzuki H. Kawarabayasi Y. Kondo J. Abe T. Nishikawa K. Kimura S. Hashimoto T. Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8681-8685Google Scholar). Once activated, these intermediates can be utilized in two major metabolic pathways: the catabolic pathway of fatty acid β-oxidation or the anabolic pathway, converting fatty acids into cellular lipids. Several acyl-coenzymeA synthetases have been identified biochemically by their different substrate specificity(1Groot P.H.E. Scholte H.R. Hulsman W.C. Adv. Lipid Res. 1976; 14: 75-126Google Scholar).

The ACS gene has a complex genomic structure; it contains 3 different first exons 1A (53 bp), 1B (216 bp) and 1C (27 bp), giving rise to 3 different mRNA species through alternative splicing (see Fig. 1A). The translation initiation codon is, however, in the second exon, and therefore only one protein is formed from these 3 different mRNAs. Transcription of these exons is controlled by separate regulatory regions, termed A, B and C, respectively, suggesting a complex transcriptional control (see Fig. 1A). long-chain acyl-coenzyme A synthetase chloramphenicol acetyl transferase coenzyme A electrophoretic mobility shift assay fenofibric acid peroxisome proliferator activated receptor peroxisome proliferator-response element retinoid X receptor tetradecylthioacetic acid base pair(s). Recently, considerable interest has been shown for a group of chemicals called peroxisome proliferators.

The peroxisome proliferation caused by these agents partially results from a transcriptional induction of the enzymes of the β-oxidation pathway(12Osumi T. Ozasa H. Hashimoto T. J. Biol.

In a previous report, we demonstrated that the initiating enzyme of the β-oxidation pathway, ACS, is induced by peroxisome proliferators both in vivo in rat liver as well as in vitro in hepatoma cell lines(38Schoonjans K. Staels B. Grimaldi P. Auwerx J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 615-622Google Scholar). Given the pivotal role of ACS in intracellular lipid metabolism, we initiated more detailed studies to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of ACS gene expression in the rat hepatoma cell line Fa-32, as well as in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes. In this report, we demonstrate that fibrates, as well as fatty acids, induce the levels of the exon 1C containing ACS mRNA in a time- and dose-responsive fashion in both primary cultures of rat hepatocytes and the Fa-32 rat hepatoma cell line. Furthermore, we show that this effect of fibrates is mediated through binding of PPAR to a PPRE localized in the C promoter. Fenofibric acid, pirixinic acid (Wy-14643), and tetradecylthioacetic acid (TTA) were kind gifts of Dr. Alan Edgar (Laboratoires Fournier, Daix, France), Dr. Sharon Burns (Wyeth-Ayerst, Princeton, NJ), and Dr. Jon Bremer (Oslo University, Oslo, Norway). Palmitate and α-linolenic acid were purchased from Sigma, and α-bromopalmitate was obtained from Aldrich. Male Wistar rats (90 days old) were treated for different periods of time with fenofibrate (Laboratoires Fournier) mixed at 0.5% (by mass) in standard rat chow. The food intake of the rats was recorded every 2 days throughout the treatment period. None of the treatments caused major changes in the amount of food consumed by the animals. At the end of the experiments, animals were sacrificed (at 9 a.m.) by exsanguination under ether anesthesia. The liver was removed immediately, rinsed with 0.9% NaCl, and frozen in liquid nitrogen until RNA was extracted. The construction of the reporter plasmids pCatEA, pCatEB, and pCatEC containing the 5′-flanking region preceding the different first exons 1A, 1B, and 1C of the ACS gene has been described elsewhere(5Suzuki H. Watanabe M. Fujino T. Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9676-9682Google Scholar). Deletion mutants of the C promoter of ACS, pCatEC-717, pCatEC-481, pCatEC-416, and pCatEC-282, were generated from pCatEC-981 by exonuclease III digestion (we use a numbering scheme in which the A of the AUG initiator codon of the ACS protein in exon 2 is designated as +1)(5Suzuki H. Watanabe M. Fujino T. Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9676-9682Google Scholar). The fragment from −981 to −51, preceding the 1C exon, has been cloned in the reverse orientation in the pCatECRV control CAT vector(5Suzuki H. Watanabe M. Fujino T. Yamamoto T. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7745Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction fragments flanked by MluI and BglII restriction sites were amplified from pCatEC-981 and inserted in the corresponding sites of the pGL-2 basic vector (Promega), thereby creating the luciferase reporter genes C-ACS(−981)-LUC and C-ACS(−282)-LUC. Site-directed mutagenesis of PPRE was accomplished according to Kunkel (40Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Fenofibric acid, Wy-14643, and fatty acids (α-linolenic acid, palmitate, TTA, and α-bromopalmitate) were dissolved in Me2SO and ethanol, respectively, and added to the medium at the appropriate concentration and time indicated. Only vehicle was added to control cells. In the case of fatty acids, preincubation with the medium containing fetal calf serum (and hence serum albumin) was carried out for 45 min at 37°C. Rat hepatocytes were isolated by collagenase perfusion of livers from male Sprague-Dawley rats (body weight, 150-200 g) as described(46Staels B. Vu-Dac N. Kosykh V. Saladin R. Fruchart J.C. Dallongeville J. Auwerx J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 705-712Google Scholar). Cell viability was higher than 85% as determined by trypan blue exclusion. The hepatocytes were cultured in monolayer (1.5 × 105 cells/cm2) in Leibovitz-15 medium (Life Technologies, Inc. BRL, Paisley, UK) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 0.2% (w/v) fatty acid free bovine serum albumin, 26 mM NaHCO3, 2 mM glutamine, 3 g/liter glucose, and antibiotics at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air. Fenofibric acid and fatty acids acid were added immediately after seeding the cells. No morphological differences in cell adhesion or cell toxicity (determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide colorimetric test(47Mosmann T. J. Immunol.

Brunzell J.D. Peng R. Chait A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2651-2655Google Scholar). Specific ACS mRNA species were measured using specific polynucleotide kinase-labeled antisense oligonucleotides (A-ACS, 40-mer 5′-CCCGGGCGCTCCGCAGGCGGCTGTCACTGCAATCCACGAA-3′; B-ACS, 40-mer 5′-GTTTGGATCTGTCCTCTA-TGGGGTGCCTGGTTGGATTGGT-3′; C-ACS, 24-mer 5′-CATCTGTGCCACCGACAGCTGACT-3′). A human GAPDH cDNA clone (49Tokunaga K. Nakaruma Y. Sakata K. Fujimoro K. Ohkubo M. Sawada K. Sakiyama S.

For oligonucleotide hybridizations, blots were washed two times for 15 min at 37°C and one time for 30 min at 55°C. Nuclei were prepared from primary rat hepatocytes treated for 9 h with fenofibric acid (500 μM) or α-bromopalmitate (50 μM), or vehicle and transcription run-on assays were performed as described by Nevins(50Nevins J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 234-241Google Scholar). Equivalent counts of nuclear RNA labeled with [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol) were hybridized for 36 h at 42°C to 5 μg of ACS cDNA(4Suzuki H. Kawarabayasi Y. Kondo J. Abe T. Nishikawa K. Kimura S. Hashimoto T. Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8681-8685Google Scholar), acyl-CoA oxidase cDNA(12Osumi T. Ozasa H. Hashimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2031-2034Google Scholar), albumin cDNA(51Sanger T.D. Yang M. Bonner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 243-246Google Scholar), and vector DNA immobilized on Hybond-C Extra filters (Amersham). After hybridization, filters were washed at room temperature for 10 min in 0.5 × SSC and 0.1% SDS and twice for 30 min at 65°C and subsequently exposed to x-ray film (X-OMAT-AR, Kodak). Quantitative analysis was performed by scanning densitometry (Bio-Rad GS670 densitometer). Transfections in Fa-32 cells were performed at 50-60% confluency by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation procedure with a mixture of plasmids that contained, in addition to the CAT or luciferase reporter plasmids and expression vector(s), 1 μg of thymidine kinase-driven β-galactosidase expression vector as a control for transfection efficiency. All samples were complemented with pSG5 plasmid to an equal total amount of plasmid DNA. After 8 h, Fa-32 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for another 38 h with fenofibric acid or fatty acids in fresh medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. After transfection, the cells were lysed by four freeze-thaw cycles in 100 μl of 0.25 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM dithiothreitol. Luciferase activity was monitored in 50-μl extracts using a LKB 1250 luminometer (52de Wet J.R. Wood K. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Google Scholar). For the CAT reporter vectors, CAT activity was determined as described by Gorman et al.(53Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Google Scholar). Autoradiographs were quantified by densitometry. Transfection efficiencies were normalized with the β-galactosidase activity assay (Promega Protocols and Applications Guide, 2nd Edition). All transfection experiments were performed at least 3 times. haPPARγ(25Aperlo C. Pognonec P. Saladin R. Auwerx J. Boulukos K. Gene (Amst.). 1995; (in press)Google Scholar), mRXRα (42Leid M.

Cell. 1992; 68: 377-395Google Scholar) proteins were synthesized in vitro using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega). Vaccinia virus-expressed xPPARα was a kind gift of A. Hihi (Université de Lausanne). The quality of the in vitro translated or vaccinia virus-made proteins were verified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. To study the C-ACS PPRE, a synthetic double-stranded 41-bp oligonucleotide spanning nucleotides −183 to −147 of the rat C-ACS gene 5′ upstream regulatory sequence was used (5′-GATCCGGCATGTGACTGATGCCCTGAAAGACCTTGGCAGGA-3′). A 30-bp double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the PPRE of the rat acyl-CoA oxidase gene and spanning sequences −634 to −607 (5′-'GATCCCGAACGTGACCTTTGTCCTGGTCCC-3′) was used as a control PPRE. An oligonucleotide binding CP-1 (5′-TCGACTACACCTATAAACCAATCACCT-3′) corresponding to the adenovirus major late promoter served as a nonspecific control in EMSA reactions(54Chodish L.A. Baldwin A.S. Carthew R.W. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1988; 53: 11-24Google Scholar). In each EMSA 2 μl of PPAR and/or RXR were preincubated in a total volume of 20 μl for 15 min on ice with 2 μg of poly(dI•dC) in TM buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 40 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 0,05% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mM dithiothreitol). For competition experiments, increasing amounts of cold oligonucleotide acyl-CoA oxidase PPRE or ACS PPRE (from 25- to 200-fold molar excess) were included just before adding T4-polynucleotide kinase (1 × Tris borate EDTA = 0.045 M Tris borate, 0.001 M EDTA) end-labeled oligonucleotides. For supershift experiments, an antibody to xPPARα (55Dreyer C. Keller H. Mahfoudi A. Laudet V. Krey G. Wahli W. Biol. Cell. 1993; 77: 67-77Google Scholar) was used as described previously. After 15 min of incubation at room temperature, DNA-protein complexes were separated by electrophoresis on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.25 × TBE buffer at 4°C(56Fried M.G. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 141-158Google Scholar). Recent work from Yamamoto and colleagues (5Suzuki H. Watanabe M. Fujino T. Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9676-9682Google Scholar) demonstrated the existence of three distinct ACS mRNA species differing by an alternatively used first exon, each preceded by its own regulatory region (Fig. 1A). In order to determine to which of the three ACS mRNA species the previously observed induction of rat liver ACS mRNA after fibrate administration (38Schoonjans K. Staels B. Grimaldi P. Auwerx J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 615-622Google Scholar) could be attributed, a Northern blot obtained from rats treated for 14 days with 0.5% fenofibrate was hybridized with oligonucleotides specific for each of the first three exons. Under basal conditions only the A-ACS mRNA was expressed in rat liver, whereas the B- and C-ACS mRNAs were undetectable (Fig. 1B). Treatment with fenofibrate provoked a moderate (2.8-fold) induction of the A-ACS mRNA, whereas C-ACS mRNA was strongly induced (Fig. 1B). In accordance with the data obtained by Suzuki et al.(5Suzuki H. Watanabe M. Fujino T. Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9676-9682Google Scholar), B-ACS mRNA was undetectable in control or in fibrate-treated rat liver by Northern blot hybridization. To further investigate the mechanisms controlling rat liver ACS gene induction after fibrate treatment, the exon-specific induction of ACS gene expression was studied in the rat hepatoma cell line, Fa-32, by Northern blot hybridization analysis. Similar to rat liver and unlike human HepG-2 cells, Fa-32 cells exhibit a remarkable increase in ACS gene expression after fenofibric acid administration(38Schoonjans K. Staels B. Grimaldi P. Auwerx J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 615-622Google Scholar). Interestingly, although both A- and C-ACS mRNAs are induced by fenofibrate in Fa-32 cells, the level of induction of C-ACS mRNA is much more pronounced (Fig. 2A). Like in adult rat liver, B-ACS mRNA was not expressed in uninduced Fa-32 cells, nor could it be induced in fibrate-treated cells. The induction of C-ACS by peroxisome proliferators as determined by hybridizations with exon-specific oligonucleotides was confirmed by primer extension analysis (data not shown). These observations prompted us to focus on the mechanism underlying the stimulation of exon 1C containing ACS mRNA subspecies. When Fa-32 cells were treated for 48 h with different doses of fenofibric acid, a dose-dependent increase of C-ACS mRNA was observed with a maximal 29-fold induction at 500 μM fenofibric acid (Fig. 2B). A similar induction pattern of C-ACS gene expression was observed after the addition of fatty acids, such as α-linolenic acid (100 μM, 9-fold induction). Furthermore, α-bromopalmitate (up to 100 μM) and TTA (80 μM), two nonmetabolized fatty acids, induced C-ACS gene expression to a higher extent than α-linolenic acid (21-fold for α-bromopalmitate, 17-fold for TTA) (data not shown). To determine the kinetics of C-ACS mRNA accumulation, time course experiments were performed with the optimal dose of fenofibric acid (500 μM) (Fig. 2C). C-ACS mRNA was already maximally induced within 4-8 h. Similar kinetics of c-ACS mRNA induction were observed with α-bromopalmitate (50 μM) (data not shown). Surprisingly, considerable variability in uninduced C-ACS mRNA levels was observed during these experiments. In order to understand the cause of this variability, the effects of different parameters like the concentration of serum, the presence or absence of serum lipids, and the degree of confluency on C-ACS gene expression were analyzed. Neither serum nor lipids affected basal levels of C-ACS expression. However, C-ACS mRNA steady state levels were positively correlated with the degree of confluency of the cells (data not shown). Similar inductions of ACS gene expression were observed in primary rat hepatocytes treated with fenofibric acid. A maximal 8-fold induction was observed at concentrations between 50 and 500 μM of fenofibric acid after 12 h (data not shown). α-Linolenic acid induced C-ACS mRNA weakly (1.5-fold), whereas α-bromopalmitate induced C-ACS mRNA nearly 4-fold (data not shown), indicating that fatty acids have weaker effects in primary hepatocytes when compared with fenofibric acid. Next, it was investigated whether C-ACS mRNA gene induction was dependent on de novo protein synthesis. Treatment of Fa-32 cells with cycloheximide alone during 6 h did not change C-ACS mRNA levels in comparison with control cells (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2). When cells were treated with cycloheximide combined with either fenofibric acid or α-bromopalmitate, C-ACS mRNA levels increased to similar levels compared with fenofibric acid or α-bromopalmitate alone (Fig. 3, compare lanes 3-6). This suggests that the observed C-ACS mRNA induction does not require ongoing protein synthesis. To analyze whether C-ACS mRNA induction occurred at the transcriptional level, nuclear run-on assays were performed on primary cultures of adult rat hepatocytes treated with fenofibric acid (500 μM) or α-bromopalmitate (50 μM) for 9 h, a time when C-ACS mRNA steady state levels are still rising. In comparison with control cells, the rate of C-ACS gene transcription was respectively 10- and 3.5-fold higher in nuclei isolated from fenofibric acid- and α-bromopalmitate-treated cells (Fig. 4). The transcription rate of the gene for acyl-CoA oxidase, a key enzyme in the peroxisomal β-oxidation pathway, was analyzed as a positive control. Consistent with the increase in peroxisomal enzyme activity after the addition of peroxisome proliferators, acyl-CoA oxidase transcription rates increased more than 5-fold.

The catalytic sites are known to be of low affinity and specificity for nucleotides. From the sequence, two nucleotide sites are predicted per Pgp molecule. Using plasma membranes from a multidrug-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cell line, which are highly enriched in Pgp, we show that vanadate-induced trapping of nucleotide at a single catalytic site produces stably inhibited Pgp, with t for reactivation of ATPase activity of 84 min at 37°C and >30 h at 4°C. Reactivation of ATPase correlated with release of trapped nucleotide. Concentrations of MgATP and MgADP required to produce 50% inhibition were 9 and 15 μM, respectively, thus the apparent affinity for nucleotide is greatly increased by vanadate-trapping. The trapped nucleotide species was ADP. Divalent cation was required, with magnesium, manganese, and cobalt all effective; cobalt yielded a very stable inhibited species, t at 37°C = 18 h. No photocleavage of Pgp was observed after vanadate trapping with MgATP, nor was UV-induced photolabeling of Pgp by trapped adenine nucleotide observed. Vanadate-trapping with 8-azido-ATP followed by UV irradiation caused permanent inactivation and specific labeling of Pgp. Vanadate-induced inhibition was also shown with pure, reconstituted Pgp, with similar characteristics to those in plasma membranes. Vanadate trapping overcomes technical difficulties posed by lack of high affinity nucleotide-binding site(s) or a covalent enzyme-phosphate catalytic intermediate in Pgp. The finding that vanadate trapping of nucleotide at just one site/Pgp is sufficient to give full inhibition of ATPase activity shows that the two predicted nucleotide sites can not function independently as catalytic sites.

P-glycoprotein (Pgp) 1The abbreviations used are: PgpP-glycoproteinlin-benzo-ATP8-amino-3-(β-D-ribofuranosyl)imidazo[4,5-g]quinazoline-triphosphate (contains formally a benzene ring inserted between pyrimidine and imidazole rings of adenosine, linearly extending the ring system)AMPPNPadenyl-5′-yl-imidodiphosphateTNP-ATP2′,3′-O-(2,4,6)-trinitrophenyl-ATPBzATP3′-O-(4-benzoyl)benzoyl-ATP. is a plasma membrane protein which endows a multidrug resistance phenotype on cells. It acts by hydrolyzing ATP at catalytic sites, which project from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, and coupling the hydrolysis of ATP to transport of drugs or other hydrophobic molecules across the membrane to the outside of the cell (Ruetz and Gros, 1994Ruetz S. Gros P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12277-12284Google Scholar; Sharom et al., 1993Sharom F.J. Yu X. Doige C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24197-24202Google Scholar). Pgp has attracted considerable interest because of its possible role in the resistance of human cancers to chemotherapy (for recent reviews, see Endicott and Ling, 1989Endicott J.A. Ling V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 137-171Google Scholar; Gottesman and Pastan, 1993Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Google Scholar; Gros and Buschman, 1993Gros P. Buschman E. Int.

Our laboratory has been working to characterize the catalytic sites of Pgp, and in recent work we obtained a highly Pgp-enriched plasma membrane preparation from multidrug-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cells that showed substantial ATPase activity referable to Pgp (Al-Shawi and Senior, 1993Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4197-4206Google Scholar). We purified the Pgp to >95% homogeneity and reconstituted it in proteoliposomes, with retention of ATPase activity (Urbatsch et al., 1994Urbatsch I.L. Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7069-7076Google Scholar). The ATPase activity is activated and/or inhibited by a range of drugs, and it is also sensitive to the membrane lipid environment (Urbatsch and Senior, 1995Urbatsch I.L. Senior A.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 135-140Google Scholar) and subject to covalent inhibition by N-ethylmaleimide, 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole, 8-azido-ATP, and 2-azido-ATP (Al-Shawi et al., 1994Al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8986-8992Google Scholar). Several other laboratories have also demonstrated and characterized ATPase activity in plasma membrane-located Pgp (Sarkadi et al., 1992Sarkadi B. Price E.M. Boucher R.C. Germann U.A. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4854-4858Google Scholar), partially purified and reconstituted Pgp (Ambudkar et al., 1992Ambudkar S.V. Lelong I.H. Zhang J. Cardarelli C.O. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8472-8476Google Scholar; Sharom et al., 1993Sharom F.J. Yu X. Doige C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24197-24202Google Scholar), or purified, reconstituted Pgp (Shapiro and Ling, 1994Shapiro A.B. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3745-3754Google Scholar). It has been established that Pgp-ATPase activity follows simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a single Km(MgATP) around 1 mM. Free ATP is not hydrolyzed. Catalysis is relatively nonspecific in that a wide range of magnesium nucleotides are hydrolyzed, all with relatively high Km values. MgADP and MgAMPPNP show competitive inhibition with high Ki values, around 0.4 mM (Al-Shawi et al., 1994Al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8986-8992Google Scholar; Urbatsch et al., 1994Urbatsch I.L. Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7069-7076Google Scholar). Therefore, there is no evidence from kinetic studies for a high affinity site involved in catalysis. We have applied other techniques to try to detect a tight nucleotide site(s). (2)I. L. Urbatsch, B. Sankaran, J. Weber, and A. E. Senior, unpublished results. Direct analyses of bound ATP or ADP using the luciferin-luciferase method in Pgp-enriched plasma membranes failed to detect any bound nucleotide, either before or after incubation with 5 mM MgATP. “Unisite”-type ATP hydrolysis assays, using concentrations of [γ-32P]ATP stoichiometric with Pgp (conduced as described by Penefsky, 1986Penefsky H.S. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 608-618Google Scholar) showed there was little binding or hydrolysis of the ATP under these conditions. Direct binding experiments with [α-32P]ATP or [3H]ADP, using centrifuge columns, gel filtration, or vacuum-assisted filtration methods failed to detect significant specific binding of nucleotide to Pgp at concentrations of added nucleotide up to ~100 μM. Above this concentration, nonspecific binding of nucleotide became problematic, in both plasma membrane and purified reconstituted Pgp, probably due to the particulate nature of these preparations. Finally, in an exhaustive, and we believe conclusive, series of experiments aimed at detecting a covalent enzyme-phosphate catalytic intermediate, we obtained negative results with both plasma membrane and purified reconstituted Pgp. As we point out elsewhere, the lack of a high-affinity nucleotide-binding site or covalent enzyme-phosphate intermediate in Pgp has important mechanistic implications (Senior et al., 1995Senior A.E. Al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. J. Biomembr. Bioenerg. 1995; 27: 31-36Google Scholar). From a technical standpoint, it also renders investigation of the enzyme mechanism difficult, e.g. by impeding direct determination of number of nucleotide-binding sites by equilibrium binding techniques, by reducing stoichiometry and specificity of labeling in (photo)affinity labeling studies, by limiting applicability of fluorescent nucleotides as reporter probes, and so forth. In several ATPase enzymes, of which myosin is a pre-eminent example (Goodno, 1979Goodno C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 2620-2624Google Scholar, Goodno, 1982Goodno C.C. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 116-123Google Scholar; Yount et al., 1992Yount R.G. Cremo C.R. Grammer J.C. Kerwin B.A. Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc. Lond. B. 1992; 336: 55-61Google Scholar), vanadate-induced trapping of nucleotides in catalytic sites, with resultant generation of a stably inhibited enzyme species, has proven extremely valuable. It provides a way of stoichiometrically and specifically binding nucleotides and nucleotide analogs in the sites, such that their dissociation rate is appreciably slowed (t values of days or even weeks have been reported). Both binding and (photo)labeling experiments are thereby facilitated (e.g. Cremo et al., 1989Cremo C.R. Grammer J.C. Yount R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6608-6611Google Scholar; Garabedian and Yount, 1991Garabedian T.E. Yount R.G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10126-10132Google Scholar; Yount et al., 1992Yount R.G. Cremo C.R. Grammer J.C. Kerwin B.A. Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc. Lond. B. 1992; 336: 55-61Google Scholar). Moreover, the vanadate-nucleotide-enzyme complex is thought to resemble the catalytic transition state. The ATPase activity of both plasma membrane Pgp and purified reconstituted Pgp is inhibited when vanadate is included in the ATPase assay medium. Under these conditions, vanadate causes 50% inhibition of ATP hydrolysis at around 10 μM and complete inhibition at higher concentrations (Sarkadi et al., 1992Sarkadi B. Price E.M. Boucher R.C. Germann U.A. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4854-4858Google Scholar; Ambudkar et al., 1992Ambudkar S.V. Lelong I.H. Zhang J. Cardarelli C.O. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7069-7076Google Scholar). Here we carried out experiments to determine whether preincubation of Pgp with nucleotide and vanadate, followed by removal of unbound ligands, generated a species of Pgp showing long-lived inhibition of ATPase activity, as seen, for example, in myosin. We found that this was the case, and in this paper we have characterized the vanadate-induced inhibited Pgp species. Plasma membranes were prepared from the multidrug-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cell-line (CR1R12) as described by Al-Shawi and Senior(1993). One modification was that the Parr N2-disruption apparatus was replaced by use of the BioNeb cell disruption system (Glas-Col, Terre Haute, IN) The cells were passed through the apparatus at 30 pounds/square inch of N2, monitoring disruption in the microscope. Usually five passes were performed. Using this modification, yields of plasma membranes were significantly increased. The membranes contained from 15-24% (w/w) of Pgp as a fraction of total membrane protein. ATPase activity was measured utilizing an ATP-regenerating system according to Vogel and Steinhart, 1976Vogel G. Steinhart R. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 208-216Google Scholar. Ten μg or less of membrane protein was added to 1 ml of assay medium at 37°C containing 10 mM ATP, 12 mM MgSO4, 3 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.33 mM NADH, 10 units of lactate dehydrogenase, 10 units of pyruvate kinase, and 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. ATP hydrolysis, recorded as absorbance decrease at 340 nm, was linear in the range between 0.33-0.01 mM NADH. Unless otherwise stated the ATPase activity was calculated from the absorbance decrease during the first 5 min which was linear in all cases. EGTA (0.1 mM) and ouabain (2 mM) were included to eliminate Ca-ATPase and Na,K-ATPase activity, respectively, and 10 μM verapamil was included to maximally stimulate the Pgp. The Pgp-ATPase activity was around 1.3 μmol ATP hydrolyzed/min/mg membrane protein. Under the assay conditions described, the plasma membranes (which are prepared in 0.25 M sucrose-containing buffer) are osmotically disrupted (Al-Shawi and Senior, 1993Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4197-4206Google Scholar). Orthovanadate solutions (100 mM) were prepared from Na3VO4 (Fisher Scientific) at pH 10 as described (Goodno, 1982Goodno C.C. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 116-123Google Scholar) and boiled for 2 min before each use to break down polymeric species. At concentration ≤200 μM, monomeric vanadate is the predominant species in solution (Ringel et al., 1990Ringel I. Peyser Y.M. Muhlrad A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9091-9096Google Scholar). Plasma membranes (10 μg) were incubated with 200 μM vanadate, 1 mM nucleotide, 3 mM MgSO4, 10 μM verapamil, 2 mM ouabain, 0.1 mM EGTA, and 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, in a total volume of 100 μl for 20 min at 37°C. (Variations of the conditions are detailed in the tables and figures.) The incubations were started by addition of membranes and stopped by passage of the 100-μl samples through centrifuge columns consisting of 1 ml of Sephadex G-50 (fine) topped with a 10-mm layer of Dowex AG1-X8 (Bio-Rad) (Penefsky, 1977Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2891-2899Google Scholar; Wolodko et al., 1983Wolodko W.T. Brownie E.R. O'Connor M.D. Bridger W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14116-14119Google Scholar) equilibrated with 0.1 mM EGTA, 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Unless otherwise stated the centrifuge column step was carried out at 23°C. Control experiments using [α-32P]ATP showed that <0.002% of the applied nucleotide eluted from the columns in the absence of membranes. Stoichiometry of vanadate-trapped nucleotide in Pgp was calculated as the amount of radioactive nucleotide in the centrifuge column eluates after vanadate-induced inhibition divided by the amount of Pgp in the plasma membranes in the same eluates. The amount of Pgp in the membranes was measured as described by Al-Shawi et al., 1994Al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8986-8992Google Scholar. Briefly, the eluates were run on SDS-gels, stained with Coomassie Blue, and subjected to laser densitometry. We have established previously that this method is reliable as a means of determining the Pgp concentration in membrane samples (Al-Shawi et al., 1994Al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8986-8992Google Scholar). For the experiments described (Table 3, Fig. 8), the Pgp content of membranes was 24% (w/w total membrane protein). The molecular size of Pgp was taken as 141 kDa.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Nucleotides were analyzed by thin layer chromatography using polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates (Brinkmann) and developing in 0.1 M potassium phosphate adjusted to pH 3.4 with phosphoric acid. SDS-gel electrophoresis, immunoblotting, and protein assay by bicinchoninic acid method in the presence of 1% SDS were all performed as described previously (Al-Shawi and Senior, 1993Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4197-4206Google Scholar). [α-32P]ATP, [α-32P]UTP, and [3H]ADP were from Amersham Corp. Tissue culture materials were from BRL Life Technology Inc. Lactate dehydrogenase (catalog no. 127868) and pyruvate kinase (catalog. no. 109053) (both supplied in 50% glycerol) were from Boehringer Mannheim. C219 anti-Pgp monoclonal antibody was from Signet Laboratories. We previously reported that vanadate is a potent inhibitor of ATPase activity in plasma membrane and purified reconstituted Pgp (Al-Shawi and Senior, 1993Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4197-4206Google Scholar; Urbatsch et al., 1994Urbatsch I.L. Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7069-7076Google Scholar). In those experiments vanadate was present during the assay, with 10 mM MgATP, and it was found that concentrations of vanadate required for 50% inhibition were 12 or 9 μM in plasma membranes or purified reconstituted Pgp, respectively. Essentially total inhibition was obtained in both cases at ~100 μM vanadate. Here we investigated whether vanadate induced a long-lived inhibited species of Pgp, as has been described for example in the case of myosin. We first preincubated plasma membranes from the multidrug-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cell line CR1R12, which are highly enriched in Pgp, with 200 μM vanadate in the presence of 1 mM MgATP, then removed unbound ligands by passage through centrifuge columns (see “Experimental Procedures”). Membranes in the eluates were then added to ATPase assay medium, and the Pgp-ATPase activity was found to be inhibited by ≥90%. This indicated that preincubation with vanadate and MgATP induced a stably inhibited Pgp species. Conditions for reactivation of the inhibited Pgp species were examined in Fig. 1. The closed circles show inhibited membranes added directly to the ATPase assay medium at 37°C. ATPase activity was followed over several hours and was seen to increase exponentially with an apparent rate constant (kapp) of 1.4 × 10-4 s-1 (t = 84 min). Complete recovery of ATPase activity was eventually obtained. 10 mM MgATP, as present in the ATPase assay medium, was not required for reactivation; incubation of the eluate from the centrifuge column in 0.1 mM EGTA, 40 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, at 37°C followed by assay of ATPase at various times gave the same kapp for reactivation of 1.4 × 10-4 s-1 (Fig. 1, open circles). The rate of recovery of ATPase activity was temperature dependent, with kapp of 6.6 × 10-5 s-1 (t = 175 min) and 3.7 × 10-5 s-1 (t = 311 min) at 30 and 23°C, respectively (Fig. 1). At 4°C the extrapolated half-life for reactivation of the inhibited Pgp-ATPase was >30 h. This is similar to the situation with myosin ATPase, which is known to form a stable transition state-like complex with vanadate ions and MgADP that has a half-life of 3 days at 4°C (Goodno, 1982Goodno C.C. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 116-123Google Scholar). In the studies reported above, the inhibited Pgp species was formed by preincubation of membranes with vanadate and MgATP at 37°C for 20 min. Similar results were obtained if room temperature was used. For the studies reported below, we used 37°C throughout. Additionally, verapamil was routinely present during the inhibition phase of the experiments (see “Experimental Procedures”), but omission of it did not affect the degree or time course of the inhibition. The drugs verapamil and vinblastine which stimulate Pgp-ATPase, or cyclosporin A and mitomycin D which inhibit Pgp-ATPase, were added at various concentrations to the inhibited plasma membranes in eluates from the centrifuge columns. The samples were incubated at 23°C, and it was noted that none of the drugs affected the rate of reactivation of Pgp-ATPase. Table 1shows that formation of the inhibited Pgp species required preincubation with nucleotide, Mg2+, and vanadate, and that omission of any one of these resulted in zero inhibition. Neither PPi nor Pi nor high ionic strength (200 mM Na2SO4) prevented the inhibition when 1 mM MgATP was present; however, we did note that at lower MgATP concentrations, 200 mM Pi did reduce inhibition somewhat (see below). ADP substituted for ATP, whereas AMP did not. Pyrophosphate did not substitute for nucleotide.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Plasma membranes were preincubated with varied concentrations of vanadate in the presence of ATP (1 mM) and MgSO4 (3 mM) and the Pgp-ATPase activity determined after removal of unbound ligands (Fig. 2). The concentration of vanadate required for half-maximal inhibition of Pgp-ATPase was 4 μM. In the absence of nucleotide, vanadate in concentrations up to 3 mM had no effect. Fig. 3, A and B show the effects of varying the concentrations of MgATP and MgADP at saturating concentrations of vanadate (200 μM). The concentrations required for half-maximal inhibition were 9 μM MgATP and 15 μM MgADP. The Km for MgATP hydrolysis is 1.4 mM, and the Ki for competitive inhibition by MgADP is 0.4 mM (Al-Shawi and Senior, 1993Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4197-4206Google Scholar), thus vanadate strongly increased the apparent affinities of Pgp for both MgATP and MgADP. With both nucleotides the inhibition phase of the curves was steep (see Fig. 3legend). This aspect was not further investigated here but is of interest for future studies. Inhibition of ATPase activity was followed by varying the incubation times before applying the plasma membrane samples to centrifuge columns. The incubations contained 200 μM vanadate and 200 μM nucleotide. With MgATP, inhibition was rapid, reaching completion in <10 s (Fig. 4). However, with MgADP the apparent rate constant (kapp) for the inhibition was 2.4 × 10-3 s-1 (t = 4.8 min), corresponding to an apparent second-order rate constant (kapp) of 12 M-1 s-1. The rate of inhibition seen with ADP was therefore low in comparison with the rates of simple protein-ligand association reactions, and also in comparison with the observed kcat/Km for Pgp-ATPase (1.5 × 104M-1 s-1), suggesting that a slow protein isomerization step occurred after MgADP binding, to form the inhibited species. The rate constants for the reactivation of ATPase activity were compared (Fig. 5) after Pgp was inhibited by incubation with either MgATP or MgADP in the presence of vanadate so as to achieve maximal inhibition. They were in fact very similar (kapp for MgATP-inhibited Pgp = 1.4 × 10-4 s-1 and for MgADP-inhibited Pgp = 1.5 × 10-4 s-1). This indicated that the inhibited Pgp species likely contained bound MgADP and vanadate, whether inhibition was induced in presence of MgATP or MgADP. As Table 2shows, a range of nucleoside triphosphates were able, in conjunction with vanadate, to induce the inhibition of Pgp. Many of these were shown previously to be substrates for Pgp (Urbatsch et al., 1994Urbatsch I.L. Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7069-7076Google Scholar). TNP-ATP and lin-benzo-ATP (Table 2, lines 3 and 4) are fluorescent nucleotide analogs of ATP. The potential photoaffinity labeling analogs 8-azido-ATP and BzATP (Table 2, lines 5 and 6) were both effective (as also was 8-azido-ADP, not shown in Table 2). Furthermore, it was found that if, after induction of inhibition of Pgp by vanadate with 8-azido-ATP and removal of unbound ligands, the inhibited Pgp was irradiated with UV light, no reactivation of the ATPase activity could be achieved, whereas if the samples were not irradiated, complete reactivation of the ATPase activity was possible. These data indicated that vanadate had caused trapping of 8-azido-adenine nucleotide in the catalytic sites.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Fig. 6shows that vanadate-trapped 8-azido-[α-32P]nucleotide was, on UV irradiation, selectively (>95%) cross-linked to Pgp in the plasma membranes. Immunoblotting experiments (not shown) demonstrated that the minor labeled bands seen in Fig. 6, lane 2, of molecular sizes 65 and 100 kDa, both reacted with C219 anti-Pgp monoclonal antibody, and correspond to proteolytic fragments of Pgp as shown by Georges et al., 1991Georges E. Zhang J.T. Ling V. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 148: 479-484Google Scholar. It is evident therefore that vanadate trapping offers an excellent approach to achieving specific (photo)labeling of Pgp catalytic sites. All of the experiments described so far used magnesium as the metal cofactor with the nucleotide. In other systems, again notably myosin, it has been found that the substitution of manganese or cobalt leads to a further increase in the apparent affinity for the vanadate-nucleotide complex, due to decrease in dissociation rate. We first established that both MnATP and CoATP were hydrolyzed by Pgp (Vmax values relative to MgATPase were 43% for MnATP and 10% for CoATP). Fig. 7A shows the time dependence of vanadate-induced inhibition in the presence of CoATP and MnATP. Inhibition with both divalent metal ions was fast and substantial, with >95% inhibition of the ATPase activity found after preincubation with CoATP. Reactivation of the inhibited Pgp species is shown in Fig. 7B, where it is seen that reactivation for Mn2+ was faster than for Mg2+, with a half-life of only 24 min at 37°C (kapp 4.8 × 10-4 s-1). In the presence of Co2+, in contrast, vanadate caused very stable inhibition of the Pgp, with a half-life for reactivation of 18 h at 37°C (kapp 1.1 × 10-6 s-1). Samples which had been preincubated with vanadate and MgATP and passed through centrifuge columns were irradiated with light at 254 nm, then examined by SDS-gel electrophoresis. It was found that no photocleavage of the polypeptide backbone of Pgp occurred (data not shown). This is different from the situation in myosin and dynein, where UV irradiation of the inhibited species cleaves the protein within the nucleotide-binding site (Cremo et al., 1990Cremo C.R. Long G.T. Grammer J.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7982-7990Google Scholar; Gibbons et al., 1987Gibbons I.R. Lee-Eiford A. Mocz G. Phillipson C.A. Tang W.J.Y. Gibbons B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 265: 2780-2786Google Scholar). Experiments were also carried out using [α-32P]ATP or [α-32P]UTP with either magnesium or cobalt ions in the preincubation phase in order to trap radioactive nucleotide in the catalytic sites, then the samples eluting from centrifuge columns were irradiated at 254 nm in order to test whether direct photolabeling of the Pgp by nucleotide occurred. No labeling of the Pgp band on SDS-gels was detected by autoradiography. Again this was different to the experience with myosin, where direct photolabeling by vanadate-trapped adenine or uridine nucleotide occurred (Garabedian and Yount, 1990Garabedian T.E. Yount R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22547-22553Google Scholar, Garabedian and Yount, 1991Garabedian T.E. Yount R.G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10126-10132Google Scholar) Plasma membranes were preincubated with [α-32P]ATP in the presence or absence of vanadate and magnesium ions then unbound ligands were removed by centrifuge column elution (see “Experimental Procedures”) and the radioactivity in the eluates was determined. In initial experiments a relatively high amount of nonspecific binding by the plasma membranes was noted, which could be reduced by inclusion of 200 mM Pi in the preincubation and centrifuge column buffer. Table 3shows representative results obtained when membranes were preincubated at three different MgATP concentrations. As noted above, at this concentration of Pi the degree of inhibition was somewhat decreased, but, for example, at 130 μM MgATP 81% inhibition was still achieved (see Table 3legend). The major conclusion to be drawn from the table is that vanadate-induced inhibition of Pgp was accompanied by trapping of nucleotide. This was shown by the fact that only under conditions where inhibition of Pgp occurred was trapping of nucleotide seen, and that the parent AUXB1 cell-line plasma membranes, which contain essentially zero Pgp, showed no vanadate-induced nucleotide trapping. The data in Table 3confirm that the trapped nucleotide was non-exchangeable with medium nucleotide, because after “pre-loading” with nonradioactive ATP in the presence of vanadate, followed by incubation with radioactive ATP, there was little incorporation of radioactive ATP. Other experiments (not shown) involved preincubation of plasma membranes with radioactive MgATP and vanadate, followed by exposure to 100-fold excess nonradioactive ATP in the presence of 10 mM EDTA, or to 100-fold excess of nonradioactive MgATP. These experiments confirmed that preincubation with MgATP and vanadate produces a stably trapped nucleotide complex because no release of radioactivity occurred. The experiments in Table 3indicated that full inhibition of Pgp-ATPase occurred with trapping of approximately 1 mol nucleotide/mol Pgp. For example, in Table 3, line 2, the total trapped [α-32P]nucleotide in CR1R12 membranes (1.5 pmol/μg protein) corresponded to 1.09 mol/mol Pgp when extrapolated to 100% inhibition of ATPase activity. Correction for the amount of nucleotide bound in the absence of vanadate, or after preloading with nonradioactive ATP, or in the parent AUXB1 membranes (Table 3, lines 1-3) reduced this value to 0.80-0.94 mol nucleotide/mol Pgp. The experiments carried out with 50 or 25 μM [α-32P]ATP in Table 3yielded similar values. Four other experiments, not shown in Table 3, using MgATP concentrations of 10, 20, 30, and 100 μM, gave a range of 0.71 to 1.11 mol of nucleotide trapped per mol of Pgp when extrapolated to full inhibition. Plasma membranes were preincubated with [α-32P]ATP in the presence of vanadate and magnesium in order to achieve inhibition of Pgp. After removal of unbound ligands, the eluates from centrifuge columns were incubated at 37°C to reactivate the ATPase activity of Pgp. Samples were taken at intervals for estimation of ATPase and bound nucleotide (Fig. 8A). The half-time for nucleotide release was 87 min (kapp = 1.3 × 10-4 s-1), and this was very similar to the t for reactivation of ATPase (84 min; kapp = 1.4 × 10-4 s-1). Fig. 8B emphasizes the excellent correlation between release of vanadate-trapped nucleotide and reactivation of ATPase activity. The solid line in Fig. 8B is the expected behavior if 100% inhibition of ATPase activity occurs with trapping of 1 mol nucleotide/mol Pgp. We conclude that vanadate trapping of nucleotide at one catalytic site/Pgp molecule is sufficient to give full inhibition of ATPase activity. Plasma membranes were incubated with vanadate and [α-32P]MgATP as in legend to Fig. 8, then passed through centrifuge columns in 40 mM Tris-Cl, 0.1 mM EGTA, pH 7.4, at 4°C and the eluates collected directly in ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid. After brief centrifugation to remove protein precipitate, the radioactive nucleotides present in the supernatants were analyzed by thin layer chromatograpy and autoradiography. The major radioactive spot corresponded to ADP in mobility, and there was no radioactive spot at the position of ATP. Therefore, when ATP is used with vanadate to induce the inhibited Pgp species, the resultant trapped nucleotide is ADP. Purified reconstituted Pgp in proteoliposomes (prepared as in Urbatsch et al., 1994Urbatsch I.L. Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7069-7076Google Scholar) were preincubated with 200 μM MgATP and 200 μM vanadate at 37°C for 20 min (as described for plasma membranes under “Experimental Procedures”), followed by separation from unbound ligands by liquid chromatography on Sephadex G-50 in 0.1 mM EGTA, 40 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, at 4°C (the centrifuge column technique cannot be used with proteoliposomes). This resulted in an inhibited Pgp species. ATPase activity was inhibited by >90%, and complete reactivation could be achieved at 37°C with a half-life of 80 min, the same as was seen for plasma membrane Pgp. A detailed study of vanadate-induced inhibition of pure Pgp will be presented elsewhere. In this study we demonstrate long-lived inhibition of Pgp-ATPase activity by vanadate. Preincubation of plasma membrane Pgp with vanadate alone caused no inhibition, yet when ATP or ADP and Mg ions were included, a stable, enzymatically inactive complex formed which could be isolated free of unbound ligands. Inhibition of ATPase activity was fully reversible with a half-life of 84 min at 37°C, but reactivation was very slow at 4°C with a half-life of >30 h. These observations, reminiscent of previous studies of myosin and other ATPase enzymes, indicated that ADP, magnesium, and vanadate, together form a stable, ternary, noncovalent, catalytic site complex. Further evidence supporting this conclusion was that vanadate-trapped [α-32P]ADP was demonstrated directly in the inhibited Pgp, that release of trapped, labeled nucleotide correlated well with reactivation of the ATPase activity, and that vanadate-trapped 8-azido-nucleotide caused permanent inhibition of Pgp-ATPase activity after UV irradiation. These findings open up avenues of experimentation which had been precluded or rendered difficult because of the low affinity with which Pgp binds nucleotides and analogs. The main advantage is that vanadate greatly increases the apparent affinity for the nucleotide. This allows, for example, efficient trapping of photolabeling analogs at the catalytic sites with removal of unbound ligand, which should greatly improve the specificity of incorporated photoaffinity probes at catalytic sites and help identify residues in the catalytic sites by protein chemical approaches. Vanadate trapping allows stoichiometry of nucleotide binding to be analyzed with much greater accuracy, and may be valuable for application of fluorescent nucleotides, for example in fluorescence energy transfer experiments. Vanadate-induced inhibition of Pgp-ATPase was seen in both plasma membranes from the multidrug-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cell-line CR1R12 and in purified reconstituted Pgp. In this paper we have characterized features of the vanadate-induced inhibition of Pgp using plasma membranes, which provide a good source of material for multiple experiments. We demonstrate that a variety of nucleotides which are substrates also support the inhibition, in concert with earlier findings that the catalytic sites are of low nucleotide specificity. We characterize the time course and affinity of inhibition with adenine nucleotide, the dependence of inhibition on vanadate concentration, and the effects of different divalent cations. Reactivation of the inhibited Pgp was also characterized and was seen to be temperature-dependent. At 4°C the half-life for reactivation was >30 h. Inhibition in the presence of cobalt ions was seen to lead to formation of an inhibited Pgp species with an extremely long half-life of reactivation. Vanadate-induced trapping of radioactive nucleotide was demonstrated directly in Table 3. It appeared from these experiments that full inhibition occurred with ~1 mol of nucleotide trapped per mol of Pgp. On reactivation, release of radioactive nucleotide correlated well with recovery of Pgp-ATPase activity (Fig. 8A). Fig. 8B indicated that full relief of inhibition of Pgp-ATPase occurred with release of 1 mol of trapped nucleotide/mol of Pgp. Based on the evidence that reactivation occurred at the same rate whether inhibition was induced with MgATP or MgADP (Fig. 5) it seemed likely that MgADP was the trapped nucleotide species in both cases. Using thin layer chromatography, it was confirmed that in experiments in which [α-32P]ATP was used to induce inhibition the resultant trapped nucleotide was [α-32P]ADP. In myosin, the vanadate-trapped nucleotide species is also the nucleoside diphosphate (Goodno, 1979Goodno C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 2620-2624Google Scholar, Goodno, 1982Goodno C.C. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 116-123Google Scholar). Considering the similarity in structure between vanadate and phosphate, the Pgp•Mg2+MgADP•Vi complex may be a stable analog of the Pgp•Mg2+MgADP•Pi complex formed by ATP hydrolysis in Pgp. Finally, we note that vanadate-induced inhibition was demonstrated to occur in purified, reconstituted Pgp, with characteristics the same as those seen in plasma membrane Pgp. Therefore, the procedure of vanadate trapping of nucleotide may also be applied with advantage to studies of pure Pgp. We thank Sumedha Bhagat for excellent technical assistance and Dr. E. Grell (Frankfurt, Germany) for a generous gift of lin-benzo-ATP."

Virol. 1993; 67: 2034-2042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, functions of the viral nonstructural proteins in genome replication are not well defined. The region immediately C-terminal to the catalytic triad of the serine protease domain of NS3 contains conserved segments of NTP-binding proteins and DEAD family of RNA helicases(12Gorbalenya A.E. Donchenko A.P. Koonin E.V. Blinov V.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3889-3897Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 21Koonin E.V.

Virology. 1991; 184: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and in this regard, NS3 appears to be a bifunctional protein. The RNA helicase function of NS3 has not yet been demonstrated, but it has been implicated in an unwinding step of genomic RNA replication, which is thought to occur through the formation of a double-stranded RNA replicative intermediate ((23Stollar V. Schlesinger R.W. Stevens T.M. Virology. 1967; 33: 650-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 24Trent D.W. Swensen C.C. Qureshi A.A. J.

NS5, the largest protein of the virus, is the putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase involved in viral RNA replication based on the conserved motif GDD found in several RNA-dependent RNA polymerases ((26Kamer G.

Nature. 1991; 352: 290Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar)) and is thought to be involved in the formation of this replicative intermediate form. Thus, NS3 and NS5 are thought to be the components of the putative viral RNA replicase complex. We have overproduced NS3 and NS5 proteins using the recombinant vaccinia virus expression system (29Fuerst T.R. Earl P.L. Moss B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2538-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 30Moss B. Elroy-Stein O. Mizukami T. Alexander W.A. Fuerst T.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 91-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) with a focus on the characterization of these two proteins for their enzymatic activities and for their role in viral RNA replication. In this report, we demonstrate that NS3 and NS5 proteins interact in vivo in cells infected with either DEN-2 or with recombinant vaccinia viruses encoding these proteins. The NS3 protein also binds in vitro to a C-terminally modified form of NS5 protein immobilized to an affinity matrix. Localization by immunofluorescence using NS3- or NS5-specific antibodies shows that NS3 is localized in the cytoplasm and perinuclear region, whereas NS5 is localized predominantly in the nucleus of DEN-2 infected cells, although diffuse cytoplasmic localization of NS5 is also observed. Immunoprecipitation analysis of the cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts from these cells shows two forms of NS5 in the cytoplasm separable by their electrophoretic mobilities, and only one of these forms is predominantly located in the nucleus. NS3 coimmunoprecipitated with only one form of NS5 in the cytoplasmic extract. Furthermore, we show that NS5 is phosphorylated in vivo at serine residues at multiple sites. The electrophoretic mobilities of the two forms of NS5 are altered upon treatment with a phosphatase, indicating that NS5 exists in differentially phosphorylated states. [32P]Orthophosphate (carrier-free, 285 Ci/mg phosphate) and trans 35S-label (1000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from ICN Radiochemicals. The cellulose-coated thin-layer plates were purchased from EM Sciences (Cherry Hill, NJ). The phosphoamino acid standards, iodoacetamide, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, potato acid phosphatase, tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin, bovine serum albumin, and the methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were purchased from Sigma. Monkey kidney (CV-1), BSC-1 cells, and human TK− (143B) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%). HeLa cells were grown in suspension culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 7% mixed serum (3.5% new born bovine serum and 3.5% bovine serum). To prepare a monolayer of HeLa cells, HeLa cells growing in a suspension culture were pelleted, washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing fetal bovine serum (10%), and then plated in a suitable flask. DEN-2 virus (New Guinea strain C) was originally obtained from Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (Washington, D. C.) and was propagated in CV-1 cells. A laboratory strain of vaccinia virus, WR strain, as well as the recombinant vaccinia virus encoding the T7 RNA polymerase, vTF7-3, were originally obtained from Dr. Bernard Moss and then propagated in HeLa cells(31Earl P. Moss B. Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.C. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1991: 16.15.1-16.18.10Google Scholar). To construct recombinant vaccinia viruses encoding NS3 and NS5, CV-1 cells were infected with the wild-type (WR strain) vaccinia virus, followed by transfection with the expression plasmids encoding full-length NS3 and NS5 cloned into the T7 hybrid expression vector pTM1(30Moss B. Elroy-Stein O. Mizukami T. Alexander W.A. Fuerst T.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 91-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). To construct NS5 with a C-terminal histine tag, we used a modified pTM-1 vector (pJK3) 2J. Kusukawa and R. Padmanabhan, unpublished results. containing a region encoding the synthetic FLAG (DYKDDDDK) epitope(32Prickett K.S. Amberg D.C. Hopp T.P. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 580-586PubMed Google Scholar), for which a commercial monoclonal antibody is available (Kodak Scientific Imaging Systems, New Haven, CT), and six histidine residues(33Zhao L.-J. Giam C.-Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11445-11449Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). pJK3 was digested with ClaI and XhoI and a 4.7-kilobase pair fragment was purified. pLZNS5 (19Zhang L. Mohan P.M. Padmanabhan R. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7549-7554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was digested with ClaI and EagI and a 3-kilobase pair fragment was purified. A third fragment was obtained by polymerase chain reaction using pLZNS5 as template and the primers, 5′-GAAAGACGGCCGCGTACT and 5′-TAGTCCTCGAGCCACAGGACTCCTGCCTC. The three fragments were ligated to yield the pNS5.H6. To construct the recombinant virus, this expression plasmid was transfected into CV-1 cells as described above. Cell lysates were prepared by subjecting the transfected cells to five freeze-thaw cycles. The recombinant viruses encoding the NS3, NS5, and NS5.H6 (vvNS3, vvNS5, and vvNS5.H6) having the TK− phenotype were selected by infecting a human TK− cell line (HuTK−143B) in the presence of the 5-bromodeoxyuridine and screened by Southern hybridization. The recombinant virus stocks were prepared as described(31Earl P. Moss B. Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.C. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1991: 16.15.1-16.18.10Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitations and immunoblot analysis, rabbit polyclonal antibody against NS5 and NS3 were used(19Zhang L. Mohan P.M. Padmanabhan R. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7549-7554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Zhang L. Padmanabhan R. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 129: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For subcellular localization of NS3 and NS5 by immunofluorescence, CV-1 cells were infected with DEN-2 virus at 50 plaque forming units/cell. At 48 h postinfection, the cells were detached from the monolayers by trypsin treatment and plated onto glass coverslips. The infected cells were washed briefly with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2, fixed in cold acetone (kept at −20°C) for 20 min, and air-dried for 15 min(35Sasaguri Y. Sanford T. Aguirre P. Padmanabhan R. Virology. 1987; 160: 389-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Cells were briefly rehydrated in cold PBS and incubated with 200 μl of rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:30) in PBS at 37°C for 1 h. Subsequently, they were subjected to three 10-min washes with cold PBS and incubated with 200 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:30) in PBS at 37°C for 1 h. Cells were finally washed 3 times (10 min each) with cold PBS, coated with 90% glycerol in PBS, and observed under a microscope (Nikon Diaphot) with an epifluorescence attachment. Monolayers of HeLa cells were coinfected with vTF7-3 and vvNS3 or vvNS5 at 5 plaque forming units/cell for each virus. In experiments in which both NS3 and NS5 were expressed, the vTF7-3, vvNS3, and vvNS5 were used at 5, 2.5, and 2.5 plaque forming units/cell, respectively. For in vivo labeling, HeLa cells infected with vvNS3 and vvNS5 at 13 h postinfection (or CV-1 cells infected with DEN-2 at 36 h postinfection) were washed and incubated for 1 h in methionine-free medium supplemented with 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. The medium was replaced with the one containing [35S]methionine (at a final concentration of 100 μCi/ml) and incubated for 4 h at 37°C. For 32P labeling, cells were incubated for 1 h with phosphate-free Joklik's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, and then in a medium containing [32P]orthophosphate (carrier-free, 285 Ci/mg phosphate, and 1 mCi/flask) for 4 h. Cells were lysed in 1 ml of a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.25 M NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM iodoacetamide, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cell lysates were treated with micrococcal nuclease for 45 min at 37°C to digest nucleic acids, precleared with normal rabbit serum, and then immunoprecipitated as described before(36Kusukawa J. Ramachandra M. Nakano R. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2189-2196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the analysis of labeled phosphoproteins, the immunoprecipitation buffer was supplemented with 0.2% SDS. The immunoprecipitated protein was dissociated from protein A-agarose by boiling for 5 min in the sample buffer containing 65 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5%β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.001% bromphenol blue and electrophoresed on 6 or 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels(37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (204778) Google Scholar). The dried gels containing radiolabeled proteins were detected by autoradiography using a Kodak XAR-5 x-ray film at −70°C. The nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions from vTF7-3- and vvNS5- or vvNS3-coinfected HeLa cells or from DEN-2-infected CV-1 cells were isolated as described previously(38Zhao L. Padmanabhan R. Cell. 1988; 55: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). For examining the interaction between NS3 and NS5 in vitro, the extracts prepared from vTF7-3 and vvNS5.H6-coinfected HeLa cells were incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni NTA) beads (Qiagen) in 0.25 M Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 10 h at 4°C with gentle rocking. The beads were then washed twice with PBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.3 M NaCl, followed by two more washings with PBS, pH 6.8, containing 0.3 M NaCl, to remove unbound NS5 and nonspecific proteins. NS5-bound beads were then incubated for 2 h at 4°C with extracts prepared from either vTF7-3-infected, or vTF7-3- and vvNS3-coinfected HeLa cells. The beads were washed as described above, and the proteins that were bound to NS5-Ni NTA beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting methods. The immunoblot was probed firstly with anti-NS3 antibody and then with goat anti-rabbit coupled to alkaline phosphatase. 32P-Labeled proteins were resolved on 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). A small portion of the membrane was subjected to immunoblot analysis to identify the band of interest. The remaining untreated membrane was subjected to autoradiography, and the proteins were eluted from the membrane by digestion with tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin as described(39Luo K. Hurley T.R. Sefton B.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Phosphoamino acid analysis was carried out as described(40Boyle W.J. Geer P.V. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar, 41Ramachandra M. Nakano R. Mohan P.M. Rawitch A.B. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 442-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Migration of the unlabeled standards was determined by ninhydrin staining, and labeled phosphoamino acids were visualized by autoradiography. Phosphopeptide analysis by two-dimensional finger printing was performed as described (40Boyle W.J. Geer P.V. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar, 41Ramachandra M. Nakano R. Mohan P.M. Rawitch A.B. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 442-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [35S]Methionine-labeled cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts obtained from DEN-2-infected cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-NS5 antibody and protein A-agarose beads. The beads were washed once with the immunoprecipitation wash buffer and twice with dephosphorylation buffer (0.15 M sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0). The beads were resuspended in the dephosphorylation buffer, treated with 0.5 unit of potato acid phosphatase for 1 h at 37°C, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. NS3 and NS5 proteins are thought to be the components of the putative viral replicase complex. To examine whether there is a physical interaction between NS3 and NS5, DEN-2-infected cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and analyzed by immunoprecipitation using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against NS3, NS5, or rabbit preimmune serum. Immunoprecipitates were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted on to a nitrocellulose membrane. Autoradiography of the blot shows that neither NS5 nor NS3 was immunoprecipitated with preimmune serum (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 6), but NS3 was coimmunoprecipitated with NS5 when anti-NS5 (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 5) or anti-NS3 antibody was used for immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 4), suggesting a physical interaction between these two proteins. To further verify these results and to eliminate the possibility that the antisera against one protein may be cross-reacting with the other protein, the same blot used for autoradiography was analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 1B). NS5 could be visualized in both anti-NS3 and anti-NS5 immunoprecipitates when the blot was probed with anti-NS5 antibody (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 3). In the same way, NS3 could be detected in the anti-NS5 and NS3 immunoprecipitates when the blot was probed with anti-NS3 antibody (Fig. 1B, lanes 4 and 5). However, neither protein could be visualized when preimmune serum was used for immunoprecipitations (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 6). The results of the experiments described above could not address the possibility that other DEN-2 proteins might be involved in facilitating the interaction between NS3 and NS5. In order to explore this possibility, HeLa cells were coinfected with recombinant vaccinia viruses encoding NS3 and NS5, and the lysates from these infected cells were used for immunoprecipitations and immunoblotting experiments. As the results indicate, NS5 could be coimmunoprecipitated with NS3 when either anti-NS3 or anti-NS5 antibody was used for immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1C, lanes 1 and 4, respectively). As a negative control, when vTF7-3 (encoding only T7 RNA polymerase)-infected extracts were used for immunoprecipitation with NS3 or NS5 antibody, no specific bands were seen (Fig. 1C, lanes 3 and 6). These experiments clearly demonstrated that NS3 and NS5 proteins interact in vivo in DEN-2-infected CV-1 cells or in HeLa cells infected with recombinant vaccinia viruses encoding NS3 and NS5 proteins. The results of the latter experiments (Fig. 1C) show that no other viral protein is required for this interaction. In order to examine whether NS3 and NS5 proteins interact in vitro, we constructed the recombinant vaccinia virus encoding the NS5 with the C-terminal modification (vvNS5.H6) containing the FLAG epitope (32Prickett K.S. Amberg D.C. Hopp T.P. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 580-586PubMed Google Scholar) and the histidine tag(33Zhao L.-J. Giam C.-Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11445-11449Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The modified NS5 (NS5.H6) protein expressed in HeLa cells coinfected with vTF7-3 and vvNS5.H6 was immobilized to Ni NTA affinity beads, which were then washed as described under “Experimental Procedures” to remove any unbound NS5.H6 as well as nonspecific proteins. The NS5 attached to the beads was incubated with either the extract prepared from the vTF7-3-infected HeLa cells as negative control or the NS3-containing extracts prepared from HeLa cells coinfected with vTF7-3 and vvNS3. The beads were washed to remove any unbound NS3 as well as nonspecific proteins, and the bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-NS3 antibodies as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 1D, NS3 was retained in the NS5-bound Ni NTA beads (lane 4), whereas little or no NS3 was bound to Ni NTA beads in the absence of immobilized NS5 protein (lane 1) or when the NS5-bound beads were incubated with the vTF7-3 extract (lane 3). The NS3 extract was loaded into lane 2 as positive control. These experiments indicate that the NS3 and NS5 proteins interact in vitro. The results of the coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed an association between NS3 and NS5 in vivo in both DEN-2-infected CV-1 cells as well as in HeLa cells coinfected with recombinant vaccinia viruses encoding NS3 and NS5. The subcellular localization of these proteins in DEN-2-infected CV-1 cells as determined by indirect immunofluorescence showed that NS3 was predominantly localized in the cytoplasmic and perinuclear regions of the infected cells (Fig. 2C), whereas the NS5 was distributed predominantly in the nucleus, although some diffuse cytoplasmic staining was also detected (Fig. 2E). Uninfected cells showed no reactivity to the NS3 and NS5 antibodies (Fig. 2, A and B). Similar localization patterns of these proteins were observed in CV-1 cells infected with recombinant vaccinia NS3 and NS5 viruses (data not shown). The results obtained from the immunofluorescence and coimmunoprecipitation experiments support a working hypothesis that NS3 and NS5 interact to form a complex in the cytoplasm or in the perinuclear region where NS3 is predominantly localized and a different form of NS5 is localized in the nucleus, which is free of NS3. In order to investigate this hypothesis, DEN-2-infected cells metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine were fractionated into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, and the fractions were used for immunoprecipitation analyses using anti-NS5 and anti-NS3 antibody or preimmune serum (normal rabbit serum) as a negative control (Fig. 3). When cytoplasmic extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-NS5 antibody, two closely migrating bands for NS5 were detected (Fig. 3, lane 1), whereas the nuclear extracts predominantly contained the slower migrating form of the protein (Fig. 3, lane 2). Furthermore, NS3 could be coimmunoprecipitated with NS5 only from the cytoplasmic extracts (69-kDa band in Fig. 3, lane 1). When NS3 antibody was used for immunoprecipitation, the faster migrating form of NS5 could be predominantly coimmunoprecipitated (Fig. 3, lane 3). No NS3 was observed in the nuclear extracts, consistent with its subcellular localization observed by immunofluorescence (Fig. 2B). Lanes 5 and 6 of Fig. 3 show negative controls where preimmune serum was used for immunoprecipitation. We also made an interesting observation that the two forms of NS5 were readily detectable only when DEN-2-infected cells were subjected to a medium containing low serum (2.5%), whereas under normal serum concentration (10%), only one form was obtained (data not shown). The ratio of NS5 to NS3 in the immunoprecipitates was also increased under low serum concentration compared with that obtained under normal medium (compare Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 3 with Fig. 1A, lanes 2-5, respectively). Also, two faster migrating proteins coimmunoprecipitated with NS3 and NS5 from cytoplasmic extracts of DEN-2-infected cells. The identity of these proteins in the NS3/NS5 immune complexes is unknown at present. The results of the immunoprecipitations with anti-NS5 antibody suggested that the two forms of NS5 could be due to post-translational modification. In order to investigate whether NS5 was modified by phosphorylation, NS5 was immunoprecipitated from cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts of 35S-labeled DEN-2-infected cells. The immunoprecipitated protein was then treated with potato acid phosphatase, and phosphatase-treated and untreated controls were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The results shown in Fig. 4 indicate that after treatment with potato acid phosphatase both the cytoplasmic and the nuclear forms of NS5 shift to faster migrating forms (compare untreated cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts loaded on to lanes 3 and 5 of Fig. 4 with the treated samples on lanes 2 and 4). The fastest migrating bands present in the cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts immunoprecipitated by the anti-NS5 antibody were sensitive to potato acid phosphatase treatment, but the identity of these bands is unknown at present. The negative control for these immunoprecipitations is shown in Fig. 4, lane 1, in which the unfractionated cell extract was used for immunoprecipitation with preimmune serum (NRS). The sensitivity of immunoprecipitated nuclear and cytoplasmic forms of NS5 to the phosphatase treatment suggested that the multiple forms of NS5 may be due to differential phosphorylation. In order to verify this possibility more directly, CV-1 cells infected with DEN-2 and HeLa cells infected with recombinant vaccinia virus encoding NS5 were metabolically labeled using [32P]orthophosphate. Labeled extracts were immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography (Fig. 5). As shown in Fig. 5, 32P-labeled NS5 could be immunoprecipitated with anti-NS5 antibody from both the recombinant vaccinia NS5 virus-infected HeLa cell extracts (lane 2) and the DEN-2-infected CV-1 cell extracts (lane 3). As a positive control, NS5 was immunoprecipitated using anti-NS5 antibody from 35S-labeled DEN-2-infected cell extract (Fig. 5, lane 1), and as negative controls, extracts of HeLa cells infected with only the T7 RNA polymerase gene-encoded recombinant vaccinia virus vTF7-3 were immunoprecipitated with anti-NS5 antibody (lane 6) or the extracts used in lanes 2 and 3 with normal rabbit serum (lanes 5 and 4, respectively). These results confirm that NS5 is a phosphoprotein. The identity of the phosphorylated form of NS5 was also verified by immunoblot analysis of the anti-NS5 immunoprecipitate prepared from 32P-labeled DEN-2-infected cell extracts, followed by autoradiography of the blot (data not shown). In order to analyze the amino acid residues that were modified by phosphorylation, phosphoamino acid analyses of the 32P-labeled NS5 produced in DEN-2-infected CV-1 cells and in recombinant vaccinia NS5 virus-infected HeLa cells were carried out. The results shown in Fig. 6A for recombinant NS5 indicate that phosphate groups are associated only with serine residues (Fig. 6A), similar to the pattern observed for native NS5 (data not shown). In order to determine whether a single or multiple serines were modified in NS5, two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping was performed using 32P-labeled NS5 obtained from recombinant vaccinia NS5 virus-infected HeLa cells (Fig. 6B). The results show that there are at least four distinct phosphorylation sites in addition to a few minor ones. The experimental evidence presented in this report indicates that the two non-structural proteins, NS3 and NS5, interact in vivo both in DEN-2-infected CV-1 cells and HeLa cells infected with recombinant vaccinia viruses encoding these proteins. Using the NS5.H6 immobilized to an affinity matrix (Ni NTA beads), we show that these two proteins also interact in vitro. This interaction between NS3 and NS5 supports the notion that they are components of the putative viral replicase postulated in earlier studies (6Chambers T.J. Hahn C.S. Galler R. Rice C.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 44: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar, 42Bartholomeusz A.I. Wright P.J. Arch.

The data obtained from the in vivo and in vitro interaction studies using the recombinant vaccinia virus-infected cell extracts indicate that no other flavivirus protein is required for this interaction. However, a requirement of a cellular protein(s) for this interaction or participation of other viral and cellular proteins in stabilization of this complex cannot be ruled out. Flavivirus genome replication is thought to occur through the formation of double-stranded RNA replicative intermediate(23Stollar V. Schlesinger R.W. Stevens T.M.

Subcellular localization studies revealed that virus-specific double-stranded RNA appeared to be associated in the perinuclear region of the infected cells(5Westaway E.G. Adv.

The cell fractionation studies also supported these results and further indicated that viral RNA synthesis appeared to be confined principally to the membranes of the perinuclear endoplasmic reticulum(5Westaway E.G.

Although both proteins have been found to be present in the subcellular fractions containing the RNA polymerase activity, direct interaction between these two proteins has not been demonstrated previously. Previous studies have reported that NS5 of two other flaviviruses is localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm of infected cells(51Prives C. Cell. 1990; 61: 735-738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 52Fanning E. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1289-1293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This study, as shown by immunofluorescence, subcellular fractionation, and immunoprecipitation methods, shows that there are two forms of NS5 present in the cytoplasmic fraction that are separable by SDS-PAGE. Only the form with the slower mobility is predominantly located in the nuclear fraction. The multiple forms of NS5 are due to differential phosphorylation, and the hyperphosphorylated form is located predominantly in the nucleus. The presence of two forms of NS5 in DEN-2-infected cells was serentipitously discovered by incubating the infected cells with a medium containing low serum (2.5%). The slower migrating form seems to be the hyperphosphorylated form when compared with the faster migrating and hypophosphorylated cytoplasmic form. Under normal growth conditions containing 10% serum, only one form of NS5 was observed. The result that only the cytoplasmic form of NS5 was found to form a complex with NS3 suggests that differential phosphorylation may regulate the interaction between NS3 and NS5 and thus their participation as components in viral RNA replication. Based on these results we propose a model as shown in Fig. 7. According to this model, the RNA replicase complex containing NS3 and NS5 participate in viral RNA replication associated with the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. In a postreplicative event, NS5 becomes hyperphosphorylated, dissociates from NS3, and is transported to the nucleus. It is known that post-translational modification by phosphorylation regulates protein-protein interactions in eukaryotic cells (for reviews, see (51Prives C. Cell. 1990; 61: 735-738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and (52Fanning E. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1289-1293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). For instance, in the case of the retinoblastoma gene product (Rb), its state of phosphorylation is important for its interaction with the cellular transcription factor E2F (for a review, see (53Nevins J.R. Science. 1992; 258: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar) and the references therein). The phosphorylation state of Rb varies in different stages of the cell cycle. The protein is in a hypophosphorylated stage at the G0/G1 phase, during which it is in a complex with E2F. During the G1/S phase, Rb gets hyperphosphorylated and dissociates from E2F. Similarly, phosphorylation of IκB results in the dissociation of NFκB-IκB complex and translocation of NFκB to the nucleus(54Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1990; 344: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar, 55Kerr L.D. Inoue J.-I. Davis N. Link E. Baeuerle P.A. Bose Jr., H.R. Verma I.M. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The poliovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, 3Dpol is a phosphoprotein(56Ransone L.J. Dasgupta A. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 4563-4568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the role of phosphorylation in the function of 3Dpol is unknown. For NS5, phosphorylation may play a role in its nuclear transport, because only the slower migrating hyperphosphorylated form is present in the nucleus. In this regard, it is worth noting that phosphorylation has been shown to play a role in the nuclear transport of SV40 large T antigen(57Rihs H.P. Peters R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1479-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 58Rihs H.P. Jans D.A. Fan H. Peters R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The role of NS5 in the nucleus is unknown at present. An interesting speculation is that NS5 may regulate the expression of cellular genes in response to viral infection."

Microsomes prepared from the transfected cells were used to measure the rates of oxygenation of several 18- and 20-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acid substrates including eicosapentaenoic, arachidonic, dihomo-γ-linolenic, α-linolenic (Δ9,12,15), γ-linolenic, and linoleic acids. Comparisons of kcat/Kmvalues indicate that the order of efficiency of oxygenation is arachidonate > dihomo-γ-linolenate > linoleate > α-linolenate for both isozymes; while the order of efficiency was the same for hPGHS-1 and hPGHS-2, α-linolenate was a particularly poor substrate for hPGHS-1. γ-Linolenate and eicosapentaenoate were poor substrates for both isozymes, but in each case, these two fatty acids were better substrates for hPGHS-2 than hPGHS-1. These studies of substrate specificities are consistent with previous studies of the interactions of PGHS isozymes with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that have indicated that the cyclooxygenase active site of PGHS-2 is somewhat larger and more accommodating than that of PGHS-1. The major products formed from linoleate and α-linolenate were characterized. 13-Hydroxy-(9Z,11E)-octadecadienoic acid was found to be the main product formed from α-linoleate by both isozymes. The major products of oxygenation of α-linolenate were determined by mass spectrometry to be 12-hydroxy-(9Z,13E/Z,15Z)-octadecatrienoic acids. This result suggests that α-linolenate is positioned in the cyclooxygenase active site with a kink in the carbon chain such that hydrogen abstraction occurs from the ω5-position in contrast to abstraction of the ω8-hydrogen from other substrates.

https://openalex.org/W1518130370,"1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase is the key regulatory enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of the plant hormone ethylene. The enzyme is encoded by a divergent multigene family in Arabidopsis thaliana, comprising at least five genes, ACS1-5 (Liang, X., Abel, S., Keller, J. A., Shen, N. F., and Theologis, A.(1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 89, 11046-11050). In etiolated seedlings, ACS4 is specifically induced by indoleacetic acid (IAA). The response to IAA is rapid (within 25 min) and insensitive to protein synthesis inhibition, suggesting that the ACS4 gene expression is a primary response to IAA. The ACS4 mRNA accumulation displays a biphasic dose-response curve which is optimal at 10 μM of IAA. However, IAA concentrations as low as 100 nM are sufficient to enhance the basal level of ACS4 mRNA. The expression of ACS4 is defective in the Arabidopsis auxin-resistant mutant lines axr1-12, axr2-1, and aux1-7. ACS4 mRNA levels are severely reduced in axr1-12 and axr2-1 but are only 1.5-fold lower in aux1-7. IAA inducibility is abolished in axr2-1.The ACS4 gene was isolated and structurally characterized. The promoter contains four sequence motifs reminiscent of functionally defined auxin-responsive cis-elements in the early auxin-inducible genes PS-IAA4/5 from pea and GH3 from soybean. Conceptual translation of the coding region predicts a protein with a molecular mass of 53,795 Da and a theoretical isoelectric point of 8.2. The ACS4 polypeptide contains the 11 invariant amino acid residues conserved between aminotransferases and ACC synthases from various plant species.

The gas is endogeneously produced during unique developmental stages such as growth, senescence, and abscission of leaves and flowers, development and ripening of fruits, and germination of seeds(2Yang S.F. Hoffman B.E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1984; 35: 155-189Crossref Google Scholar). Ethylene production is also induced by various stress conditions and chemical compounds, including wounding, temperature fluctuation, drought, anaerobiosis, viral infection, elicitor treatment, heavy metal exposure, or lithium ions(2Yang S.F.

We are interested in elucidating the multiple signal-transduction pathways leading to ACS gene activation by a diverse group of inducers, using biochemical, molecular, and reverse genetic approaches. Our particular goal is to understand how ACS genes are activated by auxin, by protein synthesis inhibition, and by lithium ions(6Rottmann W.H. Peter G.F. Oeller P.W. Keller J.E. Shen N.F. Nagy B.P.

We are attempting to develop the molecular genetic approaches in Arabidopsis, a model organism for a flowering plant(15Meyerowitz E.M.

Here, we report its structure and specific expression characteristics in response to IAA. The following Arabidopsis strains were used: wild type A. thaliana (L.) Heynh. ecotype Columbia, and auxin-resistant mutant lines axr1-12(16Lincoln C. Britton J. Estelle M. Plant Cell. 1990; 2: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar), axr2-1(17Pickett F.B.

To grow etiolated seedlings, seeds were surface sterilized for 8 min in 5% sodium hypochlorite (30% chlorox), 0.1% Triton X-100, excessively rinsed in distilled water, and plated in Petri dishes onto sterile filter paper discs on top of 0.7% agar (Bacto-agar, Difco) containing 0.5 × Murashige-Skoog salts (Life Technologies, Inc.) at pH 5.6. After cold treatment at 4°C for 3 days, the plates were incubated in the dark at 22°C for 5-6 days. Intact etiolated seedlings (5-6 days old) were removed from the filter discs and placed in Petri dishes containing 0.5 × Murashige-Skoog salt solution buffered at pH 5.6 with 0.5 mM MES and supplemented with the appropriate chemicals. The seedlings were incubated in the dark at room temperature with shaking (50-100 revolutions/min). Mock control incubations were supplemented with an equal amount of the solvent used to prepare the stock solution of the respective chemical. After the indicated time, aliquots (3-5 g fresh weight) of seedlings were removed, briefly blotted dry, frozen with liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. For the short time course experiment, intact etiolated seedlings (5-6 days old; 3-5 g fresh weight) were placed in 50-ml Falcon tubes. After the addition of 15 ml of 0.5 × MS salts, 0.5 mM MES, pH 5.6, the tubes were moderately shaken by hand for the indicated period. The seedlings were immediately frozen with liquid N2 after decanting the bathing solution and stored at −80°C. The following recombinant clones were used in this study: pAAA1 contains the 8.3-kb EcoRI fragment of λAT-8 in pUC18. λAT-8 is an Arabidopsis genomic clone containing the ACS4 gene(10Liang X.-W.

The 0.4-kb PCR product was subcloned into the EcoRV site of pIC20R. pAAA6 contains a PCR-generated, 1.4-kb ACS4 cDNA insert in the BamHI site of pUC19.

DNA sequences were analyzed with the Sequence Analysis Software Package of the Genetics Computer Group (University of Wisconsin). Plasmid pAAA6 was introduced into Escherichia coli DH5α and M15[pREP4]. Expression conditions and measurements of ACC formation were as described previously(6Rottmann W.H. Peter G.F. Oeller P.W.

Total nucleic acids were prepared from frozen Arabidopsis tissues. Typically, etiolated seedlings or other plant material (~3-5 g fresh weight in 50-ml Falcon tubes) were supplemented with 30 ml of extraction buffer (1 volume of 200 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM LiCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, 1%β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, 25:24:1) and macerated with a polytron mixer (Brinkman) at the highest setting for 2 min. The homogenate was centrifuged, and the aqueous phase was reextracted with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol. After a second reextraction with chloroform, the aqueous phase was brought to 2 M LiCl and incubated overnight at 4°C. Nucleic acids were recovered by centrifugation, dissolved in 0.5 ml of water, and reprecipitated with 2.5 volumes of ethanol after adjusting the salt concentration to 300 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5. Poly(A)+ RNAs from larger batches of total nucleic acids were isolated by affinity chromatography using oligo(dT) cellulose as described by Theologis et al.(22Theologis A. Huynh T.V. Davis R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 183: 53-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Northern analysis was essentially performed according to Ecker and Davis(23Ecker J.R. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5202-5206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total nucleic acids were glyoxylated at 50°C, electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels, and transferred to GeneScreen membrane (DuPont-NEN). After baking at 80°C for 3 h, the membranes were prewashed in 0.1 × SSPE, 0.1% SDS at 60°C for 1 h. Prehybridization was performed in 50% formamide, 5 × SSPE (1 × SSPE is 0.18 M NaCl, 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA), 5 × BFP (1 × BFP is 0.02% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% polyvinyl pyrrolidone (Mr = 360,000), 0.02% Ficoll (Mr = 400,000)), 1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA at 42°C for 4-6 h. The hybridization buffer contained in addition 5% dextran sulfate (Mr 500,000) and the appropriate radioactively labeled probe. Probes were prepared from DNA restriction fragments by the random hexamer-primed synthesis method (24Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16562) Google Scholar) to a specific activity of ~1.0 × 109 counts/min/μg. Hybridizations were carried out with radiolabeled probes of 2 × 106 counts/min/ml hybridization solution at 42°C for 16-20 h. The membranes were washed in 50% formamide, 5 × SSPE, 0.1% SDS at 42°C for 1 h followed by a final high stringency wash in 0.1 × SSPE, 0.1% SDS at 60°C for 1 h. The wet filters were exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film with a DuPont Cronex Lightning Plus intensifying screen at −80°C. The autoradiograms were quantified using an LKB ultrascan laser densitometer (Bromma, Sweden). After exposure, the probe was removed by rinsing the filters in 0.1 × SSPE, 0.1% SDS at 95-100°C for 15-30 min. Primer extension was performed essentially according to the method of Boorstein and Craig(25Boorstein W. Craig E. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 347-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Approximately 5 × 104 counts/min of a 5′-end-labeled 29-mer synthetic oligonucleotide, DP1, complimentary to nucleotides +146 to +174 of the ACS4 gene (Fig. 1B) was hybridized at 50°C for 3 h to 15 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from etiolated Arabidopsis seedlings treated with 20 μM IAA and 50 μM CHX for 2 h. The primer-RNA hybrids were incubated with 20 units of reverse transcriptase in 50 μl of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 30 mM NaCl, 100 μM of each dNTP, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 60 μg/ml actinomycin D for 1 h at 42°C. The products were analyzed on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Standard molecular techniques were performed according to Sambrook et al.(26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Screening of a λDASH Arabidopsis genomic library with the ptACS2 cDNA of tomato (6Rottmann W.H. Peter G.F. Oeller P.W. Keller J.E. Shen N.F. Nagy B.P. Taylor L.P. Campbell A.D. Theologis A. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 937-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) as a probe under low stringency hybridization conditions resulted in the isolation of λ genomic clones for five ACC synthase genes ACS1-5(10Liang X.-W. Abel S. Keller J.A. Shen N.F. Theologis A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11046-11050Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The structure and expression characteristics of ACS2 have been reported(10Liang X.-W. Abel S. Keller J.A. Shen N.F. Theologis A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11046-11050Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In this study, we present the structural characterization of the auxin-responsive gene ACS4 using the previously isolated λ AT-8 genomic clone(10Liang X.-W. Abel S. Keller J.A. Shen N.F. Theologis A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11046-11050Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The 8.3-kb EcoRI fragment of the λ AT-8 clone (Fig. 1A) hybridizes to a specific PCR-generated sequence corresponding to the TZ region of ACC synthases(8Zarembinski T.I. Theologis A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 10Liang X.-W. Abel S. Keller J.A. Shen N.F. Theologis A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11046-11050Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), indicating that this fragment contains the ACS4 gene(10Liang X.-W. Abel S. Keller J.A. Shen N.F. Theologis A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11046-11050Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). However, determination of the orientation of ACS4 by PCR in plasmid pAAA1 reveals that the 8.3-kb EcoRI fragment contains only part of the gene, coding for the N-terminal half of ACS4 (Fig. 1A). The 2.1-kb EcoRI fragment of λ AT-8 in pAAA3 codes for the C-terminal region and contains 3′-nontranslated sequences of ACS4 (Fig. 1A). To verify the immediate contiguity of both EcoRI fragments, an overlapping fragment was generated by PCR using λ AT-8 phage DNA as the template. The sequence of the subcloned fragment in pAAA5 is identical with flanking sequences of pAAA1 and pAAA3 inserts and excludes the possibility of an additional, closely positioned EcoRI site (Fig. 1A). The sequence of 3438 nt of the ACS4 genomic locus has been determined and is shown in Fig. 1B. The gene consists of four exons and three introns. The sequence also includes 1.3 kb of the 5′-flanking region and 0.5 kb of the 3′-nontranslated region. The predicted coding region of the ACS4 gene consists of 1,422 base pairs. The intron/exon junctions which are typical of donor and acceptor splice sites (27Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3283) Google Scholar) have been established by reference to the sequence of ACS4 cDNA (see below). The number and size of exons and the location of introns are similar to other ACS genes isolated from zucchini, tomato, rice, and Arabidopsis(5Huang P.L. Parks J.E. Rottmann W.H. Theologis A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7021-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 6Rottmann W.H. Peter G.F. Oeller P.W. Keller J.E. Shen N.F. Nagy B.P. Taylor L.P. Campbell A.D. Theologis A.

However, the zucchini twin genes CP-ACS1A/1B have five exons (5Huang P.L. Parks J.E. Rottmann W.H. Theologis A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7021-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and LE-ACS4 from tomato and VR-ACS4 and VR-ACS5 from mung bean contain only three exons(6Rottmann W.H. Peter G.F. Oeller P.W.

Arteca R.N. Phillips A.T. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 123: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The start site of transcription was determined by primer extension analysis using reverse transcriptase and the primer DP1 that is complimentary to the 5′-end of the ACS4 mRNA (Fig. 2). One major primer extension product of 174 nucleotides was obtained with poly(A)+ RNA from auxin-treated etiolated Arabidopsis seedlings. These data define the size of the 5′-nontranslated region of ACS4 mRNA to be 124 nucleotides long (Fig. 1B, Fig. 2). The sequence at position −35 to −29, TATATAA, qualifies as a TATA box (27Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3283) Google Scholar), and a CAAT sequence (27Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3283) Google Scholar) is present further upstream at position −122 to −119 (Fig. 1B). The ACS4 promoter contains four sequence motifs reminiscent of functionally defined cis-elements of early genes regulated by auxin in a primary fashion, PS-IAA4/5 from pea (28Ballas N. Wong L.-M. Theologis A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 580-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 29Ballas N. Wong L.-M. Ke M. Theologis A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3483-3487Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and GH3 from soybean (30Liu Z.-B. Ulmasov T. Shi X. Hagen G. Guilfoyle T.J. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 645-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). A comparison in Fig. 3A shows that the sequence motif at position −411 to −404 of ACS4 resembles the auxin-responsive element (AuxRE) of the auxin-responsive domain A in PS-IAA4/5 from pea(28Ballas N. Wong L.-M. Theologis A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 580-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 29Ballas N. Wong L.-M. Ke M. Theologis A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3483-3487Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). An AuxRD A element is present in the promoters of a number of early auxin-responsive genes, including PS-IAA4/5-related genes from various plant species, SAUR genes from soybean, OS-ACS1 from rice, T-DNA gene 5 and rol b/c from Agrobacterium(31Oeller P.W. Keller J.A. Parks J.E. Silbert J.E. Theologis A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 789-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Noteworthy, nucleotides flanking the AuxRD A-like sequence in ACS4 and rol b/c are remarkably conserved (Fig. 3A). Two sequence motifs of ACS4, at position −462 to −448 and at position −372 to −359, display a high degree of identity with the AuxRD B element of the auxin-responsive domain in PS-IAA4/5 and related genes (28Ballas N. Wong L.-M. Theologis A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 580-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 29Ballas N. Wong L.-M. Ke M. Theologis A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3483-3487Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 31Oeller P.W. Keller J.A. Parks J.E. Silbert J.E. Theologis A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 789-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B). The AuxRD B motif functions as an auxin-specific enhancer element in PS-IAA4/5(28Ballas N. Wong L.-M. Theologis A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 580-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 29Ballas N. Wong L.-M. Ke M. Theologis A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3483-3487Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, a third sequence element at position −285 to −271 of ACS4 is strikingly similar to a motif conserved in two independently acting auxin-responsive elements of the soybean GH3 promoter(30Liu Z.-B. Ulmasov T. Shi X. Hagen G. Guilfoyle T.J. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 645-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The presence of putative auxin-responsive elements in ACS4 with similarities to functionally defined cis-elements in other early auxin-regulated genes suggests, at least in part, utilization of analogous trans-acting factors for signaling auxin-mediated ACS4 gene activation.Figure 3:Putative auxin-responsive elements in the promoter of ACS4. Sequence motifs of the ACS4 promoter (underlined in Fig. 1B) are compared with functionally defined auxin-responsive cis-elements in PS-IAA4/5 from pea (28Ballas N. Wong L.-M. Theologis A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 580-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 29Ballas N. Wong L.-M. Ke M. Theologis A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 645-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In addition, similar motifs of selected, early auxin-responsive genes are compared. Nucleotides conserved"

We have previously identified and purified a 68-kDa rat brain CaM-kinase kinase that phosphorylates and increases total and Ca2+-independent activities of CaM-kinase IV (Tokumitsu, H., Brickey, D. A., Gold, J., Hidaka, H., Sikela, J., and Soderling, T. R.(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 28640-28647). Using a partial amino acid sequence of the purified brain kinase, a CaM-kinase kinase cDNA was cloned from a rat brain cDNA library. Northern blot analysis showed that CaM-kinase kinase mRNA (3.4 kilobases) was expressed in rat brain, thymus, and spleen. Sequence analyses revealed that the cDNA encoded a 505-amino acid protein, which contained consensus protein kinase motifs and was 30-40% homologous with members of the CaM-kinase family. Expression of the cDNA in COS-7 cells yielded an apparent 68-kDa CaM-binding protein, which catalyzed in vitro activation in the presence of Mg2+/ATP and Ca2+/CaM of CaM-kinases I and IV but not of CaM-kinase II. Co-expression of CaM-kinase kinase with CaM-kinase IV gave a 14-fold enhancement of cAMP-response element-binding protein-dependent gene expression compared with CaM-kinase IV alone. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that CaM-kinases I and IV are regulated through a unique signal transduction cascade involving CaM-kinase kinase.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 247-253Google Scholar). CaM-kinase IV was first identified as a multifunctional Ser/Thr protein kinase that has two monomeric isoforms; α (63 kDa) and β (67 kDa)(2Ohmstede C.A. Jensen K.F. Sahyoun N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5866-5875Google Scholar). Although several in vitro substrates for CaM-kinase IV have been reported(3Miyano O. Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1198-1203Google Scholar, 4Cruzalegui F.H. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26171-26178Google Scholar), the physiological function(s) of CaM-kinase IV remains to be established. Three groups have reported that CaM-kinase IV is involved in Ca2+-dependent transcriptional activation through the phosphorylation of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) (5Enslen H. Sun P. Brickey D. Soderling S.H. Klamo E. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15520-15527Google Scholar, 6Sun P. Enslen H. Myung P.S. Maurer R.A.

Chatila T. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3672-3684Google Scholar), and this would be consistent with its nuclear localization(8Jensen K.F. Ohmstede C.A. Fisher R.S. Sahyoun N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2850-2853Google Scholar). However, the specific activity of recombinant CaM-kinase IV for phosphorylation of CREB or other substrates is about 20-fold lower than that of other protein kinases(5Enslen H. Sun P. Brickey D. Soderling S.H. Klamo E. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15520-15527Google Scholar). This observation prompted studies of mechanisms, in addition to Ca2+/CaM, for activating CaM-kinase IV.

The original studies on purified brain CaM-kinase IV indicated that its autophosphorylation results in 20-fold increases in Ca2+-independent and total kinase activities(9Frangakis M.V. Ohmstede C.A. Sahyoun N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11309-11316Google Scholar). However, since recombinant CaM-kinase IV exhibits very slow autophosphorylation, which at best increases total activity only 2-fold(4Cruzalegui F.H. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26171-26178Google Scholar, 10Tokumitsu H. Brickey D.A. Gold J. Hidaka H. Sikela J. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28640-28647Google Scholar), this suggested that the purified brain CaM-kinase IV may contain a contaminating activator protein. Indeed, it has been reported that rat brain extract contains a protein, which increases the total activity of bacterially expressed CaM-kinase IV(11Okuno S. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 167-170Google Scholar). More recently, we (10Tokumitsu H. Brickey D.A. Gold J. Hidaka H. Sikela J. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28640-28647Google Scholar) and another group (12Okuno S. Kitani T. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 923-930Google Scholar) purified a 66-68-kDa protein from rat brain, which in the presence of Mg2+/ATP and Ca2+/CaM gives time-dependent increases in total and Ca2+/CaM-independent activities of recombinant CaM-kinase IV. This activation of CaM-kinase IV correlates with 32P incorporation and could be reversed by subsequent treatment with protein phosphatase 2A(10Tokumitsu H. Brickey D.A. Gold J. Hidaka H. Sikela J. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28640-28647Google Scholar), so the activator protein is referred to as CaM-kinase kinase. CaM-kinase IV, which has been activated by CaM-kinase kinase, exhibits kinetics for the in vitro phosphorylation of Ser133 in CREB that are comparable with CREB phosphorylation by cAMP-kinase(13Enslen H. Tokumitsu H. Soderling T.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 1038-1043Google Scholar). These results suggest that CaM-kinase IV may be involved in transcriptional regulation through phosphorylation of CREB and perhaps other transcriptional activators as part of a unique kinase cascade pathway involving CaM-kinase kinase. Interestingly, a 52-kDa activating factor, which is probably a protein kinase, for CaM-kinase I has been highly purified from rat brain(14Lee J.C. Edelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2158-2164Google Scholar). We therefore set out to clone and characterize the 68-kDa CaM-kinase kinase and to test its specificity for activating CaM-kinases. CaM-kinase IV kinase was purified from rat brain as described previously(10Tokumitsu H. Brickey D.A. Gold J. Hidaka H. Sikela J. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28640-28647Google Scholar). Recombinant wild type and double mutant (F316D,N317D) of CaM-kinase IVs and α CaM-kinase II were expressed in Sf9 cells and purified as described previously(10Tokumitsu H. Brickey D.A. Gold J. Hidaka H. Sikela J. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28640-28647Google Scholar, 15Brickey D.A. Colbran R.J. Fong Y.L. Soderling T.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 578-584Google Scholar). Recombinant CaM-kinase I, which was expressed in Sf9 cells and purified, was kindly provided by Drs. P. Sun and R. A. Maurer (Oregon Health Sciences University). Rat brain λgt10 cDNA libraries were provided by Dr. A. Yamakawa (Dana Farber Cancer Institute). Calmodulin was purified from bovine brain. Purified rat brain CaM-kinase kinase (10Tokumitsu H. Brickey D.A. Gold J. Hidaka H. Sikela J. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28640-28647Google Scholar) was separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred onto PVDF membrane. After staining with Amido Black, the protein band (100 pmol) was excised and digested with trypsin (2 μg). Digested peptides were separated by C18 reverse phase chromatography (Applied Biosystems 130A high pressure liquid chromatography) and subjected to automatic gas-phase protein sequencing (Applied Biosystems 470A equipped with 120A PTH analyzer). Two degenerate primers corresponding to tryptic peptide 1 (IADFGVSNQFEGNDAQLSST) of rat brain CaM-kinase kinase were synthesized: sense primers, 5′AT(TCA)GC(TCAG)GA(TC)TT(TC)GG3′ based on IADFG, and antisense primers, 5′A(AG)(TC)TG(TCAG)GC(AG)TC(AG)TT3′ based on NDAQL. Forty cycles of PCR amplification were performed using rat brain random-primed, first-stranded cDNA as a template. The 50-bp PCR product was cloned into pBluescript, confirmed by sequencing, and used as the authentic probe. About 4.8 × 105 plaques from a rat brain oligo(dT)-primed cDNA library in λgt10 were screened with the 50-bp probe labeled with [α-32P]dCTP. The 5′ end EcoRI-StuI 0.3-kbp fragment of clone 7AL was used as a hybridization probe for screening a rat brain random-primed λgt10 cDNA library (4.7 × 105 plaques) to obtain clone R5. Rat brain mRNA (0.94 μg) was reverse transcribed with 10 pmol of a gene-specific primer (5′AGCATCATTCCCCTCAAACTGGTT3′) using the Invitrogen Fast Track cDNA kit. After removing excess primer by Centricon 100, the tailing reaction was carried out with 15 units of terminal deoxytransferase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and dCTP (0.2 mM). The PCR reaction was performed using poly(dC)-tailed first stranded DNA, a nested primer 1 (5′TGCTGACACCAAAGTCGGCGATCTT3′, 0.5 μM), and an anchor primer (5′ATCGAATTCCGGGIIGGGIIGGGIIG3′, 0.5 μM) under the following conditions: 1st cycle, 94°C for 4 min, 42°C for 2 min, 72°C for 3 min; 2nd to 36th cycles, 94°C for 1 min, 52°C for 1 min, 72°C for 2 min. After digestion with XhoI and EcoRI, the PCR fragment was subcloned into pBluescript. Another set of PCR reactions was performed using a nested primer 2 (5′GCGAGGAAAGCCATACT3′, 0.5 μM) and an anchor primer under conditions as described above. The PCR product was digested with XbaI and EcoRI and then subcloned into pBluescript. We sequenced both strands of cDNAs using a Sequenase version 2 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Sequence data are being submitted to GenBank. Total cellular RNA from rat tissues was isolated by the guanidine thiocyanate method, and rat brain poly(A+) RNA was selected by an oligo(dT)-cellulose column. The total RNAs (30 μg) were electrophoresed on a formaldehyde-containing 1% agarose gel and then blotted onto Hybond-N (Amersham Corp.). The blot was hybridized in rapid hybridization buffer (Amersham Corp.) with a [α-32P]dCTP random primed XbaI-XhoI fragment (540 bp) from P32 clone as a probe and washed in 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65°C. The blotted membrane was dried and autoradiographed. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were subcultured in 10-cm dishes 12 h before transfection. The cells were then transferred to serum-free medium and treated with a mixture of either 20 μg of pME18s plasmid DNA (DNAX Research Institute) (mock transfection) or CaM-kinase kinase full-length cDNA containing plasmid DNA (20 μg, pMECaMKK) and 80 μg of LipofectAMINE Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 10 ml of medium. After a 20-h incubation, the cells were collected and homogenized with 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM PMSF, 1 mM benzamidine, 5 mg/liter leupeptin, and 5 mg/liter pepstatin A) using a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer at 4°C. The kinase activation reaction contained 5.7 μM CaM-kinase IV (wild-type or double mutant(10Tokumitsu H. Brickey D.A. Gold J. Hidaka H. Sikela J. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28640-28647Google Scholar)) or CaM-kinase IV buffer (control blank) and 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM magnesium acetate, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.4 mM ATP, and 1 μM microcystin-LR plus EGTA, Ca2+, and/or CaM as indicated in Fig. 3legend. CaM-kinases I or II were used at 2 μM. The activation reactions were terminated by dilution in buffer containing EDTA, and kinase activity (46 nM of CaM-kinase IV or 15 nM of either CaM-kinases I or II) was determined at 30°C for 1-5 min using standard assay conditions as described previously (10Tokumitsu H. Brickey D.A. Gold J. Hidaka H. Sikela J. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28640-28647Google Scholar) with 40 μM syntide-2 as substrate and either 1 mM EGTA (Ca2+-independent activity) or 1 mM CaCl2 plus 1 μM CaM (total activity). COS-7 cells (8 × 105 cells/10-cm dishes) were transfected with 2 μg of GAL4 or a GAL4-CREB4-283 fusion protein (16Sun P. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7041-7044Google Scholar) and 5 μg of a reporter plasmid (5Enslen H. Sun P. Brickey D. Soderling S.H. Klamo E. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15520-15527Google Scholar) and a combination of plasmids (pME18 s) encoding CaM-kinase IV (1 μg) and/or CaM-kinase kinase (5 μg). After incubation for 36 h, the cells were treated with 5 μM ionomycin and 10 mM CaCl2 for 2 h. The cells were collected and lysed, and luciferase activity was measured by the luciferase assay kit (Promega). Luciferase activity for the mock transfected cells has been subtracted as a blank, and transfection with GAL4 without the CREB fusion protein gave insignificant luciferase activities. Western blotting was performed using anti-CaM-kinase II peptide(132-146) antiserum (1/500 dilution), and immunoreactive protein was visualized by chemiluminescence (DuPont NEN). Biotinylated CaM overlay was carried out as described previously(10Tokumitsu H. Brickey D.A. Gold J. Hidaka H. Sikela J. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28640-28647Google Scholar). In order to clone CaM-kinase kinase cDNA, we purified the 68-kDa rat brain enzyme and obtained an amino acid sequence from two of its tryptic peptides. The amino acid sequence of tryptic peptide 1 (IADFGVSNQFEGNDAQLSST) confirmed that this protein contained a motif (DFG) that is conserved among the protein kinase family. The PCR-amplified DNA fragment (50 bp) coding for peptide 1 was prepared using degenerate oligonucleotide primers (see “Experimental Procedures”), and this 50-bp fragment was used as a probe to screen a rat brain oligo(dT)-primed cDNA library, resulting in isolation of a 2.7-kbp clone 7AL (Fig. 1A). The 7AL clone contained sequences for peptide 1, other highly conserved protein kinase motifs, a TGA stop codon, and a 3′ noncoding sequence including a poly(A) tail but no sequence for peptide 2. Screening of a rat brain random primed λgt10 cDNA library yielded a 2.9-kbp clone (R5), which contained the sequence for peptide 2 (Fig. 1B) but no consensus ATP-binding motif (GXGXX(G/S)). To complete the 5′ sequence we used 5′-RACE PCR to obtain three overlapping clones (P32, P122, and P22). Clones P32 and P122 contained the ATP-binding motif (135GKGAYG), and clone P22 had an initiation ATG that was consistent with a Kozak consensus sequence(17Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Google Scholar). These overlapping clones gave an open reading frame of 1515 nucleotides coding for a protein of 505 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 56 kDa (Fig. 1B). Northern analyses of rat tissues were performed using a 0.54-kbp XbaI-XhoI fragment of clone P32. This probe hybridized to a 3.4-kb RNA, which was very abundant in forebrain, weaker in cerebellum, and detectable in thymus and spleen. This tissue distribution is similar to that of CaM-kinase IV except that CaM-kinase IV is more abundant in cerebellum than forebrain(18Frangakis M.V. Chatila T. Wood E.R. Sahyoun N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17592-17596Google Scholar). Homology analyses of the deduced amino acid sequence of cloned CaM-kinase kinase cDNA revealed it was a unique protein that had considerable sequence identity (30-40%) between residues 121 and 408 with the catalytic domains of Ser/Thr protein kinases, especially with the CaM-kinase family (Fig. 2). Interestingly, CaM-kinase kinase had an insert of 22 residues, which is rich in Pro, Arg, and Gly, between the ATP-binding motif and the DGF kinase motif. An insert in this location is present in a few other protein kinases such as STE11(19Rhodes N. Connell L. Errede B. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1862-1874Google Scholar), a yeast homologue of Raf. Like CaM-kinase IV, the COOH terminus of CaM-kinase kinase was quite acidic with residues 374-505 being 24% Asp/Glu and only 13% Arg/Lys. Other than the conserved protein kinase region, no other conserved motifs were detected in CaM-kinase kinase. When the cDNA for CaM-kinase kinase was expressed in COS cells, a new 68-kDa protein was detected by Western blotting (Fig. 3A) using an antibody against residues 132-146 of CaM-kinase II (underlined in Fig. 2). This sequence in CaM-kinase II is highly conserved in Ser/Thr protein kinases including CaM-kinase kinase (Fig. 2). We next tested whether expressed CaM-kinase kinase bound Ca2+/CaM since the purified rat brain CaM-kinase kinase was purified by EGTA elution from CaM-Sepharose, and activation of CaM-kinase IV by the brain CaM-kinase kinase required Ca2+/CaM(10Tokumitsu H. Brickey D.A. Gold J. Hidaka H. Sikela J. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28640-28647Google Scholar). Gel overlay of the expressed CaM-kinase kinase with biotinylated CaM revealed strong binding of CaM to the 68-kDa protein. Although no obvious CaM-binding domain was detected by the homology search, it is possible that residues 444-457, which contain hydrophobic and basic residues, may constitute a basic amphipatic α-helix characteristic of CaM-binding domains. The most important test of the cloned putative CaM-kinase kinase was whether the expressed protein activated CaM-kinase IV. In Fig. 3B the COS cell extract was incubated with Mg2+/ATP for 5 min in the presence of purified recombinant CaM-kinase IV and either EGTA, Ca2+, or Ca2+/CaM. The reaction was terminated by dilution and then assayed to determine the activity of CaM-kinase IV in the presence of EGTA (Ca2+-independent activity, openbars) or Ca2+/CaM (total activity, solidbars). In the absence of CaM-kinase kinase (i.e. buffer or mock-transfected COS cells) the total CaM-kinase IV activity was about 2.5 pmol/min, and it increased to about 4 pmol/min upon autophosphorylation in the presence of Ca2+/CaM. This small 1.5-2-fold activation upon autophosphorylation is consistent with previous reports for Sf9 cell-expressed CaM-kinase IV(4Cruzalegui F.H. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26171-26178Google Scholar, 10Tokumitsu H. Brickey D.A. Gold J. Hidaka H. Sikela J. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28640-28647Google Scholar). However, when CaM-kinase kinase was expressed in the COS cells there was a 6-fold increase in total CaM-kinase IV activity and a 100-fold increase in its Ca2+-independent activity (Fig. 3B). Similar activation was observed with either wild-type CaM-kinase IV or a double mutant in which the overlapping CaM-binding and autoinhibitory domains were disrupted by mutation of Phe316 and Asn317 to Asp. This mutant no longer required Ca2+/CaM for activity, and it bound Ca2+/CaM very poorly(10Tokumitsu H. Brickey D.A. Gold J. Hidaka H. Sikela J. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28640-28647Google Scholar). The results of Fig. 3B, which were essentially identical to those obtained with the purified brain CaM-kinase kinase(10Tokumitsu H. Brickey D.A. Gold J. Hidaka H. Sikela J. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28640-28647Google Scholar), indicated that expressed CaM-kinase kinase not only bound Ca2+/CaM (Fig. 3A) but also required it for activity. A 52-kDa activator of CaM-kinase I has been purified from rat brain(14Lee J.C. Edelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2158-2164Google Scholar), so it was of interest to determine whether our expressed 68-kDa CaM-kinase kinase could also activate CaM-kinase I. CaM-kinase I phosphorylates in vitro synapsin I (20Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7273-7281Google Scholar) and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator(21Picciotto M.R. Cohn J.A. Bertuzzi G. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12742-12752Google Scholar). Fig. 4A shows that CaM-kinase kinase catalyzed a 10-fold increase in the total activity of recombinant CaM-kinase I; unlike with CaM-kinase IV, there was no effect on Ca2+-independent activity of CaM-kinase I. CaM-kinase II is known to be regulated by autophosphorylation, which only increases its Ca2+-independent activity(22Colbran R.J. Soderling T.R. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1990; 31: 181-221Google Scholar). There is no strong evidence that its total activity can be increased by phosphorylation, and it was not activated by CaM-kinase kinase (Fig. 4B). Considerable evidence exists that CaM-kinase IV is involved in transcriptional regulation through the phosphorylation of CREB(5Enslen H. Sun P. Brickey D. Soderling S.H. Klamo E. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15520-15527Google Scholar, 6Sun P. Enslen H. Myung P.S. Maurer R.A. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2527-2539Google Scholar, 7Matthews R.P. Guthrie C.R. Wailes L.M. Zhao X. Means A.R. McKnight G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6107-6116Google Scholar), but CaM-kinase IV is less potent than protein kinase A and may need to be activated by CaM-kinase kinase(5Enslen H. Sun P. Brickey D. Soderling S.H. Klamo E. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15520-15527Google Scholar). We further tested the CaM-kinase cascade hypothesis by determining whether co-transfection of COS cells with CaM-kinase kinase and CaM-kinase IV would enhance gene transcription compared with CaM-kinase IV alone. COS-7 cells transfected with either CaM-kinase IV or CaM-kinase kinase exhibited little CREB-dependent luciferase gene expression under these conditions (Fig. 5). The weak effect of transfection by CaM-kinase IV alone was consistent with the apparent lack of CaM-kinase kinase in COS-7 cells (Fig. 3). Co-transfection of CaM-kinase IV with CaM-kinase kinase gave a 14-fold enhancement of luciferase expression compared with transfection with either kinase alone (Fig. 5). However, the dependence on ionomycin for the transcriptional enhancement by CaM-kinase kinase was only about 2-fold (not shown). This small Ca2+ effect could be due to Ca2+-independent activity of the overexpressed CaM-kinase kinase, or it could indicate that factors in addition to Ca2+ are required for full activation of CaM-kinase kinase (see below). These possibilities are being explored. The results presented in this paper are consistent with a signal transduction cascade involving CaM-kinase kinase and CaM-kinase IV, which regulates gene expression. Protein kinase cascades, such as the protein kinase A/phosphorylase kinase cascade (23Walsh D.A. Perkins J.P. Brostrom C.O. Ho E.S. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 1968-1976Google Scholar) and the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade(24Nakielny S. Cohen P. Wu J. Sturgill T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2123-2129Google Scholar), are well established physiological pathways. Agonists that trigger the CaM-kinase cascade are currently being defined. Activation of the CD3 receptor in Jurkat cells, which stimulates tyrosine and Ser/Thr protein kinases and Ca2+ mobilization via inositol trisphosphate formation(25Howe L.R. Weiss A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 59-64Google Scholar), gives a 10-20-fold activation of CaM-kinase IV (26Hanissian S.H. Frangakis M. Bland M.M. Jawahar S. Chatila T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20055-20063Google Scholar) and also initiates Ca2+-dependent gene transcription(27Irving S.G. June C.H. Zipfel P.F. Siebenlist U. Kelly K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1034-1040Google Scholar). This CD3-mediated activation of CaM-kinase IV is presumably due to CaM-kinase kinase since the CaM-kinase IV activation is reversed by treatment in vitro with protein phosphatase 2A but not phosphatase 1. 2A. Park and T. R. Soderling, manuscript in preparation. We are currently investigating which agonists can activate CaM-kinase IV in various cells and whether Ca2+ mobilization alone is sufficient to maximally activate CaM-kinase kinase or whether other second messengers are also required."

Accessory transcription factors, such as adaptors and coactivators, have important, but still unclear, roles in the activation process. We tested physical interactions of the putative adaptor ADA2 with activation domains derived from acidic activator proteins and with certain general transcription factors. ADA2 associated with the herpesvirus VP16 and yeast GCN4 activation domains but not with the activation domain of yeast HAP4, which previously was shown to be independent of ADA2 function in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, the amino terminus of ADA2 directly interacted with the VP16 activation domain, suggesting that ADA2 provides determinants for interaction between activation domains and the adaptor complex. Both TATA-binding protein (TBP) and TFIIB have previously been shown to interact directly with the VP16 activation domain in vitro (65Stringer K.F. Ingles C.J. Greenblatt J.

These results suggest that the role of ADA2 in transcriptional activation is to promote physical interaction between activation domains and TBP. INTRODUCTIONTranscriptional activators are sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins, or protein complexes, which contain specific domains dedicated to mediating transcriptional activation. Activation domains are classified according to amino acid composition. Among them, acidic activation domains are highly conserved in function, since they activate transcription from yeast to mammals (50Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 683-689Google Scholar). A well-studied example is the herpes simplex virus VP16 activation domain (18Gerster T. Roeder R.G. Proc Natl Acad Sci U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6347-6351Google Scholar; 43O'Hare P. Goding C.R. Haigh A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4231-4238Google Scholar; 49Preston C.M. Frame M.C. Campbell M.E. Cell. 1988; 52: 425-434Google Scholar; Triezenberg et al., 1988) whose function requires certain hydrophobic residues, in addition to overall negative charge (10Cress W.D. Triezenberg S.J. Science. 1991; 251: 87-90Google Scholar; 55Regier J.L. Shen F. Triezenberg S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 883-887Google Scholar).The mechanism by which the basal transcriptional machinery increases the rate of initiation upon activation involves protein-protein contacts between activation domains and specific basal factors (Ptashne, 1988; 51Ptashne M. Gann A.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 329-331Google Scholar; 57Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 402-408Google Scholar; 19Gill G. Tjian R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 236-242Google Scholar). An important yet unresolved question is whether there is direct interaction between the activation domain and components of the basal transcriptional machinery (for review of basal factors see (73Zawel L. Reinberg D. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 67-108Google Scholar), or whether additional factors are essential for this signaling pathway. Biochemical approaches have shown that activation domains indeed are capable of direct contact with general factors. For example, the activation domain of VP16 has been shown to contact directly three general transcription factors, TBP 1The abbreviations used are: TBPTATA-binding proteinTAFsTATA binding factorsGSTglutathione S-transferase.(TATA-binding protein (Stringer et al., 1990)), TFIIB (56Roberts S.G. Ha I. Maldonado E. Reinberg D. Green M.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 741-744Google Scholar) and TFIIH (72Xiao H. Pearson A. Coulombe B. Truant R. Zhang S. Regier J.L. Triezenberg S.J. Reinberg D. Flores O. Ingles C.J. Greenblatt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7013-7024Google Scholar). However, these interactions may not be sufficient for transcriptional activation, and several lines of evidence suggest that additional factors are required. For example, TBP is associated with factors (TAFs) in a complex required for transcriptional stimulation in vitro by several classes of activation domains (58Rose M. Botstein D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 170: 883-904Google Scholar; 52Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 61: 1187-1197Google Scholar; 11Dynlacht B.D. Hoey T. Tjian R. Cell. 1991; 66: 563-576Google Scholar; 54Reese J.C. Apone L. Walker S.S. Griffin L.A. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 523-527Google Scholar). TAFs include several coactivators which make specific contacts with activation domains to assemble active transcription machinery (7Chen J. Attardi L. Verrijzer C. Yokomori K. Tjian R. Cell. 1994; 79: 93-105Google Scholar).Certain other proteins and multiprotein complexes distinct from general factors or TAFs have been shown to be involved in transcriptional activation, such as the PC4 (16Ge H. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1994; 78: 513-523Google Scholar)/P11 (32Kretzschmar M. Kaiser K. Lottspeich F. Meisterernst M. Cell. 1994; 78: 525-534Google Scholar) cofactor derived from the earlier described USA (42Meisterernst M. Roy A.L. Lieu H.M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1991; 66: 981-993Google Scholar). In yeast, products of the SWI/SNF genes are required for the enhancement of transcription by many transcriptional activators (for review see 71Winston F. Carlson M. Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 387-391Google Scholar; 6Carlson M. Laurent B.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 396-402Google Scholar)), perhaps through functional interactions with chromatin (9Cote J. Quinn J. Workman J.L. Peterson C.L. Science. 1994; 265: 53-60Google Scholar; 27Imbalzano A.N. Kwon H. Green M.R. Kingston R.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 481-485Google Scholar). Also in yeast are SRB proteins, which interact with the carboxyl-terminal tail of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II and are required for activated transcription from many promoters (66Thompson C.M. Koleske A.J. Chao D.M. Young R.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 1361-1375Google Scholar). These factors, along with several general factors, may constitute a holoenzyme RNA polymerase complex (30Kim Y.J. Björklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Google Scholar; 31Koleske A. Young R. Nature. 1994; 368: 466-469Google Scholar) which includes a transcriptional stimulatory activity (Kim et al., 1994).Yeast cofactors required for activation in vitro appeared to be distinct from general transcription factors, and thus were termed mediators (29Kelleher III, R.J. Flanagan P.M. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1990; 61: 1209-1215Google Scholar) or adaptors (Berger et al., 1990). A genetic selection in yeast (Berger et al., 1992) led to the identification of the putative adaptors ADA2 (Berger et al., 1992) and ADA3 (45Piña B. Berger S. Marcus G.A. Silverman N. Agapite J. Guarente L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5981-5989Google Scholar) which had properties consistent with an adaptor role in transcriptional activation. Recently, employing the same genetic selection, two new genes were identified (41Marcus G. Silverman N. Berger S. Horiuchi J. Guarente L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4807-4815Google Scholar), and one was identical to GCN5, which previously had been found to be required for activated transcription by the yeast activator GCN4 (17Georgakopoulos T. Thireos G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4145-4152Google Scholar).Several lines of evidence suggest that ADA2 comprises part of a complex containing additional components. First, mutant strains in either ada3 (Piña et al., 1993) or gcn5 (Marcus et al., 1994) have properties similar to ada2 mutants. Also, yeast two-hybrid analysis and coimmunoprecipitation assays showed interactions between ADA2 and GCN5 (Marcus et al., 1994), ADA3 (26Horiuchi J. Silverman N. Marcus G. Guarente L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 1203-1209Google Scholar), and between ADA2 and the VP16 activation domain (63Silverman N. Agapite J. Guarente L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11665-11668Google Scholar). One model for the role of such a complex is that it constitutes a physical link to allow productive interaction between the activation domain and the basal transcription apparatus. ADA2 may play a central role in this complex, since it selectively interacts in functional assays with certain acidic activation domains, such as those of VP16 and yeast GCN4, but not with others, such as yeast HAP4 (Berger et al., 1992; Piña et al., 1993). In this report we show specificity in physical associations of ADA2 with activation domains and with TBP. Furthermore, we detect direct interaction between ADA2 and the VP16 activation domain, suggesting that ADA2 may provide determinants within the adaptor complex for interaction with activation domains. These data support a model that the adaptor complex is required for physical interaction of activator proteins with the basal transcriptional machinery.MATERIALS AND METHODSYeast Strainsβ-Galactosidase assays (59Rose M.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) were carried out in the wild type yeast strain PSY316 (MATαade2-101 Δhis3-200 leu2-3, 112 lys2 ura3-53). GST fusion protein binding studies were done with nuclear extracts prepared from diploid wild type or ada2¯ strains, from crosses between PSY316 and BWG1-7A (MATaura3-52 leu2-3, 2-112 his4-519 ade1-100) or ADA2 disruption derivatives.GST-Activation Domain Fusion ProteinsFusion genes were made by cloning of polymerase chain reaction-generated fragments containing each activation domain bearing a BamHI restriction site at one end and BglII at the other end, into pGEX-3X (Pharmacia Biotechnol Inc.) digested with BamHI, followed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing (61Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar) to confirm each structure. Following transformation into Escherichia coli XL1-blue, protein expression was induced with 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside for 3 h, the cells were harvested, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and sonicated on ice. Coupling of GST fusion proteins to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Pharmacia) was performed as described (64Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Google Scholar). GST-ADA2 was prepared as described (15Frangioni J. Neel B. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Google Scholar).Binding of Yeast Protein to GST Fusions80 μl (approximately 2 mg of protein) of yeast extract were incubated with 20-50 μl of beads in binding buffer (50 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl, 5 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μM pepstatin A, 0.6 μM leupeptin, 2 μg/ml chymostatin, 2 mM benzamidine), for 30 min at 4°C with rotation. The amount of beads bearing specific fusion proteins was normalized to equal the amount of beads bearing GST. The total amount of beads was equalized using washed glutathione-Sepharose beads. After binding the beads were washed with 2.5 ml of binding buffer (approximately 50 × volume of beads). Proteins were eluted as described in the legend for each experiment. In general proteins were eluted with 100 μl of either 0.5 or 1 M NaCl in binding buffer. Eluted proteins and material remaining on beads were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted onto nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell).In the case of purified GAL4-VP16 fusion proteins, binding was performed in a binding buffer with 100 mM NaCl supplemented with purified bovine serum albumin (50 ng/μl) as a competitor. Typically, 600 ng of purified protein was used in each binding reaction. The purification of GAL4-VP16 fusion proteins was described (Berger et al., 1990).Protein blots were blocked in 5% skim milk, 1 × phosphate-buffered saline, and 0.1% Tween20, for 90 min and were then washed in 1 × phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween20 for 30 min, with several changes of buffer. The following antibodies were used in immunodetection: α-ADA2 rabbit polyclonal antisera (Silverman et al., 1994), α-TBP rabbit polyclonal antisera (53Reddy P. Hahn S. Cell. 1991; 65: 349-357Google Scholar), α-TFIIB rabbit polyclonal anitsera (47Pinto I. Wu W.H. Na J.G. Hampsey M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30569-30573Google Scholar), and α-GAL4 monoclonal antisera (Santa Cruz) was used to detect GAL4-VP16 fusion proteins. All secondary antibodies used were conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Sigma). Immunodetection was performed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL kit; Amersham Corp.).Construction of GAL4 DNA-binding Domain Fusions and β-Galactosidase AssaysVP16 activation domain fragments were prepared by polymerase chain reaction as described for the GST fusions above and cloned into the BglII site of pPC97 (8Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc Natl Acad Sci U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Google Scholar). The structure of each derivative was confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. Yeast strains were transformed by the lithium acetate method (28Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Google Scholar). Transcriptional activity was determined by assay of β-galactosidase produced from a reporter plasmid containing the GAL1-10 promoter region driving expression of the bacterial LacZ gene (21Guarente L. Yocum R.R. Gifford P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4414-7410Google Scholar). Unit activity was normalized to total protein in whole cell extracts of each sample (Rose and Botstein, 1983). The amount of each fusion protein in the wild type strain was similar, as judged by gel retardation assay using a GAL4-binding site as probe (not shown).Transcription Inhibition AssayThe templates, nuclear extracts, and other methods were described (Berger et al., 1990). Equivalent amounts of each activator (by Bradford assay (5Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar)) were rechecked by gel shift and Western blot analysis to be certain that functionally equal amounts were used in the activation and inhibition experiments.RESULTSADA2 Interacts with VP16 and GCN4 Activation Domains, but Not with That of HAP4We have previously shown that certain acidic activation domains, such as herpesvirus VP16 and yeast GCN4, require ADA2 for activation both in vivo and in vitro, while other activation domains, such as yeast HAP4, are relatively independent of ADA2 (Berger et al., 1992; Piña et al., 1993). We wished to determine whether the functional dependence correlates with physical association between ADA2 and activation domains. Proteins containing GST (Smith and Johnson, 1988) fused to activation domains derived from VP16, GCN4, and HAP4 were coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads. The region of each activation domain included in the GST fusions has previously been shown to be sufficient for activation both in vivo and in vitro (Berger et al., 1992; Piña et al., 1993).Yeast nuclear extract (38Lue N.F. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8839-8843Google Scholar) was incubated in separate reactions with equal amounts of beads bearing one of the three activation domains fused to GST, or with beads containing GST alone (Fig. 1A). Proteins remaining bound to beads after extensive washes were eluted with 0.5 M salt buffer, and then both the eluted material and material remaining on beads were analyzed by immunoblotting for the presence of ADA2 (Fig. 1B). The profiles of ADA2 interaction were similar for both 0.5 M-eluted material (Fig. 1B, left panel) and material remaining bound to beads after the salt wash (Fig. 1B, right panel). ADA2 did not bind to the control beads containing GST alone but bound to and eluted from beads containing either GST-VP16 or GST-GCN4. However, ADA2 was not detected in eluate from beads bearing GST-HAP4. Thus, ADA2 physically interacted with acidic activation domains previously found to be functionally dependent on ADA2 activity, i.e. VP16 and GCN4, and did not bind to an acidic activation domain found to be independent of ADA2 activity, i.e. HAP4.ADA2 Associates with Two Distinct Regions of the VP16 Activation DomainAs the next step we wished to determine which subregion of VP16 interacted with ADA2. Previous results from deletion mapping and mutagenesis of the VP16 activation domain identified two separate subdomains sufficient for activation in animal cells: one between residues 440 and 450 (Cress and Triezenberg, 1991) and the second between residues 470 and 480 (Regier et al., 1993; 68Walker S. Greaves R. O'Hare P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5233-5244Google Scholar; 33Kunzler M. Braus G.H. Georgiev O. Seipel K. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 641-645Google Scholar). In addition, we have detected a third subregion, between 450 and 470, which has transcriptional activity in yeast, 2R. Candau and S. L. Berger, unpublished data. Based on these results, GST was fused to subregions of VP16 comprising amino acid residues 413-450, 413-470, or 470-490 (Fig. 2A). Affinity matrixes were prepared bearing each of these fusions and equal amounts of each preparation (Fig. 2B) were incubated with yeast nuclear extract, washed, and bound proteins were eluted and immunoprobed for the presence of ADA2.Figure 2:Binding of yeast ADA2 to GST-VP16 and to deletion derivatives of VP16. A, schematic of GST fusions to the VP16 activation domain and its deletion derivatives. The full-length activation domain of VP16 comprises amino acids 413-490 (Triezenberg et al., 1988), and deleted versions are shown relative to the full-length activation domain.

C, immunoblot analysis of yeast proteins associating with GST-VP16 fusions using α-ADA2 antisera. Yeast nuclear extract was incubated with the GST-VP16 fusions shown in panel B. Proteins which bound to, and eluted from, each column in wash buffer containing 1 M NaCl were immunoprobed with α-ADA2 antisera. A similar profile of interaction between ADA2 and subregions of VP16 was seen when the remaining protein bound to beads was boiled and immunoprobed for ADA2 (data not shown). Lane 1, GST alone; lane 2, GST-VP16413-450; lane 3, GST-VP16413-470; lane 4, GST-VP16470-490; lane 5, GST-VP16413-490. Protein size standards are depicted on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Consistent with the previous result (Fig. 1B), ADA2 was detected in eluate from beads containing the full-length VP16 activation domain (Fig. 2C). ADA2 was also found in eluate from beads bearing the VP16 distal region, between residues 470 and 490. The region of VP16 between 413 and 470 also bound ADA2, albeit more weakly than the 470-490 distal region. ADA2 was nearly undetectable in the eluate from beads bearing the proximal VP16 region, between 413 and 450. Thus two regions of VP16 may be important for interaction with ADA2, the region between 470 and 490 and the region between 450 and 470.Since two distinct regions of the VP16 activation domain associate with ADA2 in the binding assay, we determined the level of transcriptional activity of these identical regions of VP16 in yeast. Gene fusions were generated between subregions of VP16 and the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (amino acids 1-147). The transcriptional activity of the GAL4-VP16 fusions was tested using a bacterial lacZ reporter gene, whose expression was driven by a GAL4-inducible promoter (Guarente et al., 1982). As expected, GAL4-VP16413-490 containing the full-length activation domain was a potent activator (Table 1). The GAL4-VP16413-450 fusion was a weak activator. GAL4-VP16413-470 was intermediate, and the GAL4-VP16470-490 fusion constituted a strong activator. Thus the strength of each activation region in the in vivo assay as GAL4 DNA-binding domain fusions paralleled their ability to bind to ADA2 as GST fusions (Table 1), suggesting that strength of activation in vivo is related to the ability of activator to associate with ADA2 in vitro.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The Carboxyl Terminus, but Not the Amino terminus, of VP16 Can Inhibit Activated Transcription from a Heterologous PromoterWe previously have shown that GAL4-VP16 was capable of strongly inhibiting transcription at a heterologous test promoter in yeast nuclear extracts (Berger et al., 1990). The strong transcriptional inhibition, resulting in transcription well below the basal level (e.g. compare lanes 5 and 6 in Fig. 3B), apparently was caused by sequestration of both adaptors and general factors from the test promoter. This conclusion was based on the following observation: adding an oligonucleotide containing a GAL4 DNA-binding site into the inhibition assay caused GAL4-VP16 to inhibit only activated transcription at the test promoter, without affecting basal transcription. It was surmised that under the latter conditions, i.e. inhibition of activated transcription, an adaptor shared by the test promoter was sequestered by GAL4-VP16. Since, in our current study, GST fusions to carboxyl-terminal regions of VP16 were capable of pulling ADA2 out of a yeast extract, we wished to test whether GAL4 fusions to the carboxyl terminus of VP16 were capable of specific inhibition of activated transcription, in a manner similar to the full-length VP16 activation domain in the previous study.Figure 3:Transcriptional activation and inhibition by GAL4-VP16 or deletion derivatives. A, DNA templates used in the in vitro transcription reactions. The templates are identical except for the activator-binding sites upstream of the core promoter, as described (3Berger S.L. Cress W.D. Cress A. Triezenberg S.J. Guarente L. Cell. 1990; 61: 1199-1208Google Scholar). B, primer extension assay of RNA synthesized in vitro in yeast nuclear extract. The DNA templates used in each reaction were: lanes 1-4, gal.3; lanes 5-14, dA/dT. The GAL4-VP16 activation domain fusions used were: lanes 4 and 5, none; lanes 1 and 12-14, C = GAL4-VP16452-490; lanes 2 and 9-11, N = GAL4-VP16413-456; lanes 3 and 6-8, FL = GAL4-VP16413-490. An oligonucleotide containing a GAL4 DNA-binding site was included: lanes 7, 10, and 13, 300 ng; lanes 8, 11, and 14, 600 ng. The amount of GAL4-VP16 protein used in the activation control (lanes 1-3) was 5 pmol, and the amount used in the inhibition experiment (lanes 6-14) was 10 pmol. The level of transcription observed at the gal.3 template without addition of exogenous activator (lane 4) was identical to the level of transcription observed at a basal template, without upstream binding sites (data not shown), as shown previously (Berger et al., 1990).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Purified samples of three GAL4 DNA-binding domain fusions to VP16 were compared in their ability to inhibit activated transcription at the test promoter in vitro. The fusions contained either the full-length activation domain (413-490; FL), the amino-terminal region (413-456; N), or the carboxyl-terminal region (452-490; C). As an initial control to show that all three domains were active in vitro, low noninhibiting concentrations of the GAL4-VP16 fusions were compared in their ability to activate transcription at a promoter containing three GAL4-binding sites (template gal.3 in Fig. 3A). Equal amounts of protein activated transcription to a similar extent (Fig. 3B: compare activated transcription in lanes 1-3 to basal transcription in lane 4).The second assay tested the ability of each GAL4-VP16 fusion to inhibit activated transcription at the test promoter (template dA/dT in Fig. 3A). Activation at the dA/dT template (Fig. 3B, lane 5) is caused by an endogenous activator in the extract (39Lue N.F. Buchman A.R. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 486-490Google Scholar) and results in approximately a 5-fold increase in transcription over the basal level (lane 4 and see Berger et al.(1990) for details). In this assay, as was seen previously (Berger et al., 1990), GAL4-VP16FL strongly inhibited activated transcription at the dA/dT template (compare lane 6 to lane 5). Also as seen previously, GAL4-VP16FL specifically inhibited activated transcription when the oligomer containing the GAL4 DNA-binding site was included in the reaction (i.e. transcription in lanes 7 and 8 equal basal transcription in lane 4). Interestingly, the profile of inhibition by GAL4-VP16C was comparable to that of FL (lanes 12-14 are similar to lanes 6-8), while GAL4-VP16N was markedly different (lanes 9-11). In fact, GAL4-VP16N was incapable of inhibiting activated transcription at all (lanes 10 and 11 are the same as lane 5). Thus, in this inhibition assay, the carboxyl terminus of VP16 sequestered the adaptor activity. This correlates with its ability to associate with ADA2 in the GST pull-down assay (Fig. 2). In contrast, the amino terminus of VP16 failed to sequester the adaptor activity in the inhibition assay and did not associate with ADA2 in the GST assay. Thus, these data point to the carboxyl terminus of the VP16 activation domain as crucial for physical associations with cofactors required for activation in yeast.ADA2 and the VP16 Activation Domain Directly InteractSince GST-VP16 was able to associate with endogenous ADA2 in yeast extract, we tested whether ADA2 could interact directly with the VP16 activation domain. GST-ADA2 was constructed and an affinity matrix was prepared and incubated with GAL4-VP16 fusion proteins. We compared the ability of GAL4-VP16413-490, GAL4-VP16413-456, or GAL4-VP16470-490 to bind to GST-ADA2. GST was used as a negative control, and both GST-TBP and GST-TFIIB were used as positive controls, since they previously have been shown to bind directly to VP16 (Stringer et al., 1990; Roberts et al., 1993). Similar amounts of each GST fusion (Fig. 4A) were used to test binding of the purified GAL4-VP16 fusions. Following extensive washes, material remaining bound to beads was eluted and immunoblotted using α-GAL4 antisera (Fig. 4B).Figure 4:Direct binding between the VP16 activation domain and ADA2.

Here, we used direct protein purification, amino acid sequence analysis, reactivity with antibodies, and two-dimensional gel analyses to identify p120 as the human c-cbl protooncogene product. We demonstrate in vivo complexes of p120cbl with Fyn tyrosine kinase, the adaptor protein Grb2, and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase. The association of p120cbl with Fyn and the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase (together with PI 3-kinase activity) was markedly increased by T cell activation, consistent with in vitro binding of p120cbl to their SH2 as well as SH3 domains. In contrast, a large fraction of p120cbl was associated with Grb2 prior to activation, and this association did not change upon T cell activation. In vitro, p120cblinteracted with Grb2 exclusively through its SH3 domains. These results demonstrate a novel Grb2-p120cbl signaling complex in T cells, distinct from the previously analyzed Grb2-Sos complex. The association of p120cbl with ubiquitous signaling proteins strongly suggests a general signal transducing function for this enigmatic protooncogene with established leukemogenic potential but unknown physiological function.

One of the earliest and obligatory biochemical steps in T cell activation is the tyrosyl phosphorylation of cellular proteins including the receptor components themselves(1Weiss A. Littman D.R.

Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), the TCR components signal through noncovalently associated cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases(1Weiss A. Littman D.R.

In particular two Src family kinases, p59fyn (Fyn) and p56lck (Lck), have been demonstrated to play critical and apparently nonoverlapping roles in T cell activation. Fyn interacts physically with the cytoplasmic signaling domains of the TCR ζ/η and CD3 γ and ϵ chains(4Timson Gauen L.K. Kong A.N. Samelson L.E. Shaw A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5438-5446Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), whereas Lck interacts with the cytoplasmic tails of the CD4 and CD8 coreceptors(5Rudd C.E. Trevillyan J.M. Dasgupta J.D.

A distinct cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 has also been demonstrated to be critical for T cell activation and apparently functions downstream of the Src family kinases(1Weiss A. Littman D.R.

Similar to the TCR, Src kinase-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation is an early and a critical event downstream of other surface receptors that lack intrinsic tyrosine kinase domains, such as the B cell antigen receptor(1Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1941) Google Scholar), Fc receptors(7Eiseman E. Bolen J.B. Nature. 1992; 355: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), and certain cytokine receptors(8Kobayashi N. Kono T. Hatakeyama M. Minami Y. Miyazaki T. Perlmutter R.M. Taniguchi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4201-4205Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Thus, elucidation of tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent signaling events downstream of the TCR is likely to provide insights of general significance. The mechanisms by which early phosphorylation substrates are recruited to TCR-coupled tyrosine kinases are poorly understood. Studies with receptor tyrosine kinases such as epidermal growth factor receptor have elucidated the critical roles of the Src homology domains (SH2 and SH3) in assembling signaling complexes(3Schlessinger J.

In an attempt to define the role of SH3 domain-mediated binding to recruit cellular proteins to T cell tyrosine kinases, we recently identified a Fyn/Lck SH3 domain-binding protein p120(19Reedquist K.A. Fukazawa T. Druker B. Panchamoorthy G. Shoelson S.E. Band H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4135-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Notably, p120 was one of the earliest tyrosine phosphorylation substrates upon triggering through the TCR. Preliminary evidence indicated that p120 was present in vivo as preformed complexes with Fyn and Lck and served as a substrate for these tyrosine kinases in vitro(19Reedquist K.A. Fukazawa T. Druker B. Panchamoorthy G. Shoelson S.E. Band H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4135-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Subsequently, an unidentified protein of similar size (116 kDa), which was also tyrosine phosphorylated rapidly by stimulation of Jurkat T cells through their TCR, was shown to interact in vitro with Grb2-SH3 fusion proteins and to bind to Grb2-SH2-specific phosphopeptide matrices, indirectly suggesting that this protein was present as an in vivo complex with Grb2 (20Motto D.G.

More recently, it was reported that a 120-kDa TCR-induced tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of Jurkat T cells was reactive with antibodies to the c-cbl protooncogene product, and in vitro binding experiments demonstrated that Cbl protein in cell lysates was able to bind to Grb2 fusion proteins(21Donovan J.A. Wange R.L. Langdon W.Y. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22921-22924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we have characterized further the in vivo interactions of the Fyn/Lck SH3 domain-binding protein, p120, with other T cell signaling proteins that possess SH2 and SH3 domains. Unlike earlier studies(20Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Jackman J.K. Sun Q. Olson A.L. Findell P.R. Koretzky G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21608-21613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Donovan J.A. Wange R.L. Langdon W.Y. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22921-22924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we use coimmunoprecipitation analyses to show in vivo complexes of p120 with SH2/SH3-bearing T cell signaling proteins, the Src family tyrosine kinase Fyn and adaptor protein Grb2; in addition, we demonstrate that the Grb2-associated fraction of p120 is a target of early TCR-elicited tyrosine phosphorylation. Significantly, we also demonstrate a predominantly SH2 domaindependent interaction of p120 with the PI 3-kinase p85, which results in the recruitment of this enzyme into p120-containing protein complexes in an activation-dependent manner. We used the in vivo Grb2-p120 association to immunoaffinity purify the p120 polypeptide. The determined amino acid sequences of three distinct tryptic peptides revealed that p120 is identical to the human p120cbl protooncogene(22Blake T.J. Shapiro M. Morse H.C. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 653-657PubMed Google Scholar), and this was established further by immunochemical and two-dimensional gel analyses. These analyses independently confirm and extend the recent results showing that the Cbl protein is a target of TCR-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation in Jurkat cells(21Donovan J.A. Wange R.L. Langdon W.Y. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22921-22924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these results strongly suggest that p120cbl serves as a multifunctional SH2 and SH3 domain-binding protein in the tyrosine kinase-mediated signal transduction cascade downstream of the TCR. Given the preferential expression of c-Cbl in hematopoietic cells(23Langdon W.Y. Hyland C.D. Grumont R.J. Morse H.C. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 5420-5424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), induction of pre-B and myeloid cell leukemias by its viral form(24Langdon W.Y. Hartley J.W. Klinken S.P. Ruscetti S.K. Morse H.C. Proc.

Fusion proteins were affinity purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia) using a Triton X-100-soluble fraction of the isopropyl-1-thio-β-γ-galactopyranoside-induced Escherichia coli (DH5α strain), as described(19Reedquist K.A.

Proteins were quantitated by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) against a bovine serum albumin standard and analyzed on Coomassie gels to confirm quantitation and to assess purity (usually more than 95%). Retroviral supernatants were obtained from PA317 packaging cells transiently transfected (by the Ca2PO4 method) with pBabepuro (vector) or pBabepuroGrb2mycA (pBabepuro with mouse Grb2 tagged at the C terminus with anti-Myc antibody epitope) (from Robert Weinberg, Whitehead Institute, Cambridge, MA)(36Egan S.E. Giddings B.W. Brooks M.W. Buday L. Sizeland A.M. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1993; 363: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). Eight × 106 HSB2 cells were infected for 16 h with 4 ml of viral supernatant in 20 ml of medium containing 4 μg/ml Polybrene. Forty-eight h later selection was initiated in 1 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). Vector transfectants were used as pooled populations. Grb2myc transfectants were cloned at limiting dilution, analyzed for Grb2myc expression by Western blotting, and clones with high protein expression were used further. Cells were washed and resuspended in RPMI 1640 with 20 mM HEPES and 0.2 mM vanadate at 1-2 × 108/ml and then incubated either without (control) or with anti-CD3 mAb (SPV-T3b or 2Ad2; 1:200 ascites) for 2 min or as specified. Cells were lysed at 5 × 107/ml in cold lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100 (Fluka), 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5 (at room temperature), 150 mM sodium chloride, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin and pepstatin, 1 mM vanadate, and 10 mM sodium fluoride). 10-20 μg of purified GST fusion proteins noncovalently coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads were rocked with lysate from 2.5-5 × 107 cells for 1 h at 4°C and washed six times in lysis buffer. Bound proteins were solubilized in sample buffer, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) under reducing conditions, and subjected to immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. Antibodies were added to lysates (5 × 107 cell equivalents) precleared with Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I strain (Pansorbin, Calbiochem). After 1-2 h of rocking at 4°C, 10-20 μl of protein A-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia) was added and incubation continued for 45-60 min. Beads were washed six times in lysis buffer, and bound proteins were solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer with 2-mercaptoethanol, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. For two-dimensional gel analysis, immunoprecipitations or fusion protein binding reactions were performed as above, and proteins were eluted from beads at 90°C for 2 min in isoelectric focusing (IEF) buffer with SDS(37Jones P.A. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 108: 452-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Samples were mixed with IEF standards (Bio-Rad) and run on IEF tube gels with pH 3.5-10 Ampholine (Pharmacia) followed by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was carried out as described below. IEF standards on filters were visualized by Coomassie staining and immunoblotting with anti-actin and anti-myoglobin (from Sigma). Polypeptides were transferred to PVDF membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA) which were blocked at room temperature with 2% gelatin (Bio-Rad) in TBS-T (10 mM Tris, pH 8, 150 mMNaCl2, 0.05% Tween 20 (Bio-Rad)) for 1 h to overnight, incubated with optimal concentrations of primary antibodies in TBS-T for 1 h at room temperature, and washed six times in TBS-T. Filters were then incubated with 10 ng/ml (0.3 μCi/ml) 125I-labeled protein A for 1 h at room temperature, washed six times, and dried, and autoradiograms were developed with Kodak XAR-5 film at −80°C. Alternatively, HRPO-conjugated second-step reagents (protein A, sheep anti-mouse Ig, or donkey anti-rabbit Ig) were used, followed by visualization by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) using autoradiographic film (Reflection®174;, DuPont NEN). Chemiluminescence reagents were from Amersham Corp. (ECL kit) or DuPont NEN (Renaissance chemiluminescence reagent) and were used according to the supplier's recommendations. For repeated immunoblotting, membranes were stripped in 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, and 0.1 M 2-mercaptoethanol for 30-45 min at 50°C, rinsed in TBS-T, and blocked with gelatin/TBS-T prior to reprobing with antibodies. Affinity matrix was prepared by coupling antibodies to protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads using dimethyl pimelimidate (Pierce)(38Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 521-523Google Scholar). 2.5 g of HSB2-Grb2myc transfectant cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (137 mM NaCl, 15.7 mM NaH2PO4, 1.47 mM KH2PO4, 2.68 mM KCl, pH 7.4), lysed in 200 ml of Triton X-100 lysis buffer (see above), and passed over 3-ml preclearing columns of OKT8 (anti-CD8), W6/32 (anti-HLA class I), and anti-TCRΔ1 (anti-TCR Δ), and then applied to a 3-ml column of 9E10 (anti-Myc epitope). The column was washed with 10 volumes each of lysis buffer and phosphate-buffered saline. Bound polypeptides were eluted in 1-ml fractions with 0.1 M glycine HCl, pH 3, 150 mM NaCl and immediately neutralized with Tris, pH 8 (0.1 M final concentration). 0.3% of each fraction was resolved on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by silver staining (39Morrissey J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2923) Google Scholar) and anti-pY immunoblotting. The remainder of the fractions was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, washed with cold acetone, and solubilized in sample buffer. Fractions with p120 were pooled, run on SDS, 7.5% PAGE, and transferred to PVDF membrane (Immobilon-P). A concurrently resolved Fyn SH3 binding reaction and a part of the preparative sample were visualized by anti-pY immunoblotting for alignment with the p120 band on the PVDF membrane, which was visualized by Ponceau S staining. The p120 band was excised and submitted to Harvard Microchemistry Facility where it was digested in situ with trypsin, and resulting peptides were separated by HPLC and sequenced by collisionally activated dissociation on a Finningon TSQ700 triple-quadruple mass spectrometer. Determined sequences were compared with protein sequence data bases using the FASTA program. The immunoprecipitates (see above) were washed four times in phosphate-buffered saline plus 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, followed by three washes in TNE (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA). All wash solutions contained 0.2 mM sodium orthovanadate. To assay the PI 3-kinase activity, crude brain phosphoinositides (Sigma, P-6023) plus [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi/sample) were added to the immunoprecipitates for 10 min at room temperature. The phosphoinositides were suspended in 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM EGTA, sonicated prior to use, and added at a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml. The [γ-32P]ATP was added in a mixture that provided a final concentration of 50 μM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM HEPES. The lipid kinase assay was terminated by adding 1 N HCl, and lipids were extracted into a chloroform/methanol mixture (1:1, v/v). The lipid-containing organic phase was resolved on oxalate-coated thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates (Silica Gel 60; MCB reagents, Merck), developed in 1-propanol/acetic acid (2 M) (65:35 mixture), and lipid species were visualized by autoradiography. To facilitate anti-pY mAb detection of p120 during purification, we sought a cell line with constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated p120. Based on our previous finding that p120 served as a substrate for Lck in vitro(19Reedquist K.A. Fukazawa T. Druker B. Panchamoorthy G. Shoelson S.E. Band H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4135-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), we reasoned that p120 may be hyperphosphorylated in the human T cell line HSB2, which expresses a constitutively activated mutant Lck(40Wright D.D. Sefton B.M. Kamps M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2429-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Anti-pY immunoblotting of the whole cell lysates showed that the 120-kDa polypeptide in HSB2 cells was markedly hyperphosphorylated compared with that in anti-CD3-stimulated Jurkat cells (data not shown). This polypeptide showed binding to SH3 domains of the Fyn and Lck but not Abl, a pattern identical to that observed with p120 in Jurkat T cells(19Reedquist K.A. Fukazawa T. Druker B. Panchamoorthy G. Shoelson S.E. Band H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4135-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To purify p120 from HSB2 cells, we took advantage of its ability to form stable in vivo complexes with Grb2 adaptor protein (described below). To facilitate immunoaffinity purification of p120, we generated a transfectant cell line (HSB2-Grb2myc) that expressed high levels of a Myc epitope-tagged Grb2 protein. This is seen as a 28-kDa species in anti-Grb2 and anti-Myc immunoprecipitates of HSB2-Grb2myc cells but not in the HSB2-puror control cells (Fig. 1A). Anti-pY immunoblotting revealed the association of p120 with transfected Grb2myc protein (Fig. 1B). Thus, HSB2-Grb2myc transfectant provided a suitable reagent for immunoaffinity purification of p120. Triton X-100 lysate of HSB2-Grb2myc cells was applied to a 9E10 anti-Myc mAb column, and eluates containing Grb2myc and associated polypeptides were analyzed by silver staining and anti-p"

Physiol. 1949; 156: 261-273Google Scholar, 2Berrettini M. Schleef R.R. Heeb M.J. Hopmeier P. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19833-19839Google Scholar, 3Gurewich V. Johnstone M. Loza J-P.

The docking of HK to platelet and endothelial cell membranes requires its binding by regions on both its heavy and light chains(5Meloni F.J. Schmaier A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6786-6794Google Scholar, 6Meloni F.J. Gustafson E.J. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 1992; 79: 1233-1244Google Scholar, 7Zini J.M. Schmaier A.H. Cines D.B.

Further investigations have shown that kininogen domain 3 (D3) contains the heavy chain cell binding site(s), while the carboxyl-terminal portion of bradykinin and the amino-terminal region of the common portion of kininogen light chain (domain 4 (D4)) subsumes another cell membrane interaction site(9Jiang Y. Müller-Esterl W. Schmaier A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3712-3717Google Scholar, 10Hasan A.A.K. Cines D.B. Zhang J. Schmaier A.H. J. Biol.

It is of interest that HK and its related protein, low molecular weight kininogen (LK), have multiple touchdown sites for cell binding. Presumably, these binding sites orient the proteins for their biologic activities. In particular, the delivery of bradykinin to its receptors on endothelial cells is important to stimulate prostacyclin synthesis, superoxide formation, nitric oxide formation, tissue plasminogen activator secretion, and smooth muscle hyperpolarization factor liberation(11Hong S.L. Thromb. Res. 1980; 18: 787-796Google Scholar, 12Holland J.A. Pritchard K.A. Pappolla M.A. Wolin M.S. Rogers N.J. Stemerman M.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 143: 21-25Google Scholar, 13Palmer R.M.J.

Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2867-2871Google Scholar). Further, placement of kininogens on platelets and endothelial cells blocks α-thrombin from binding and activating these cells(5Meloni F.J. Schmaier A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6786-6794Google Scholar, 9Jiang Y. Müller-Esterl W. Schmaier A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3712-3717Google Scholar, 16Puri R.N. Zhou F. Hu C-J. Colman R.F.

These activities contribute to the constitutive anticoagulant nature of cell membranes in the intravascular compartment. In a previous study, we demonstrated that monoclonal antibody HKL12 prolonged the activated partial thromboplastin time of normal plasma and blocked the procoagulant activity of HK(18Kaufmann J. Haasemann M. Modrow S. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9079-9091Google Scholar). The epitope of this antibody was mapped to the center portion of HK domain 5 (D5H). This antibody also inhibited the binding of radiolabeled HK to M protein on the surface of Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria(19Ben Nasr A. Herwald H. Müller-Esterl W. Björck L. Biochem. J. 1994; 305: 173-180Google Scholar). Since D5H is known to be the artificial surface binding region(20Schmaier A.H. Schutsky D. Farber A. Silver L.D. Bradford H.N. Colman R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1405-1411Google Scholar, 21De La Cadena R.A. Colman R.W. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 151-160Google Scholar, 22Kunapuli S. De La Cadena R.A. Colman R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2486-2492Google Scholar), finding that an antibody that inhibits its procoagulant activity also blocks HK binding to bacteria suggested that D5H also may contain the HK cell binding site. Using synthetic peptides, we have defined the specific sequences on D5H that participate in HK binding to endothelial cells. HK and LK were purified from plasma simultaneously using sequential carboxymethyl-papain-Sepharose and reactive blue-Sepharose affinity chromatography(10Hasan A.A.K. Cines D.B. Zhang J. Schmaier A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31822-31830Google Scholar, 17Hasan A.A.K. Cines D.B. Ngaiza J.R. Jaffe E.A. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 1995; 85: 3134-3143Google Scholar). Briefly, diisopropylfluorophosphate-treated fresh frozen plasma (100 ml) was thawed at 37°C, and benzamidine-HCl (10 mM), polybrene (40 μg/ml), EDTA (2 mM), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) (0.2 mM), soybean trypsin inhibitor (0.2 mg/ml), aprotinin (100 units/ml), and NaCl (2 M) were added(23Schmaier A.H. Colman R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 169: 276-296Google Scholar). The plasma was applied to a carboxymethyl-papain-Sepharose 4B column (2.5 × 20 cm) that had been equilibrated with a mixture of 2 M NaCl, 1 mM benzamidine-HCl, 40 μg/ml polybrene, 0.2 mM PMSF, and 0.02% (w/v) NaN3 in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.5(24Johnson D.A. Salvesen G. Brown M.A. Barrett A.J. Thromb. Res. 1987; 48: 187-193Google Scholar). After the column was washed with equilibration buffer, HK and LK were eluted in a single peak by the addition of a solution containing 2 mM EDTA and 0.02% (w/v) NaN3 in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 11.5. 5-ml fractions were collected into tubes containing 0.25 ml of 4 mM PMSF in 1 M sodium acetate, pH 4.2, to give a final pH of 6.0. The fractions containing HK and LK were then applied to a reactive blue-Sepharose column (Sigma) equilibrated with 0.01 M sodium acetate, pH 6.8. Bound LK and HK were eluted using the same buffer containing 0.3 and 1 M NaCl, respectively. HK (120 kDa) and LK (66 kDa) migrated as single bands on reduced SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). HK reacted with monoclonal antibodies to its heavy and light chains by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting, while LK was recognized only by antibodies directed to the common heavy chain but not to the HK light chain. Purified HK retained its procoagulant activity and had a specific activity of 12-20 units/mg (see below). Peptides of D5H were synthesized both in the Proteinchemisches Zentrallabor of the Johannes Gutenberg University (Mainz, Germany) and in the Protein and Carbohydrate Structure Facility of the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor, MI). The peptides were made by solid-phase synthesis using FMOC (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) moiety chemistry. All peptides were purified by preparative reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The purified peptides were characterized by analytical high performance liquid chromatography, amino acid analysis, and mass spectrometry. All synthesized peptides had greater than 99% correlation between their formula weight and their molecular weight determined by mass spectrometry. On reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography, ≥91.3% of each synthesized peptide was within a peak of its expected molecular weight. Each peptide was colorless, odorless, and soluble in water. In this manuscript, each peptide is named using the one-letter code of the first three amino acid residues followed by the number of amino acids in the peptide. Monoclonal antibodies HKL12, which is directed to D5H, and HKL16, which is directed to HK domain 6 (D6H), were purified from ascites by protein A affinity chromatography(18Kaufmann J. Haasemann M. Modrow S. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9079-9091Google Scholar). The purified antibodies were quantified by absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient (E1%280) of 14 or by the dye-binding assay of Bradford(25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). The F(ab‘)2 fragment of monoclonal antibody HKL12 was prepared by pepsin cleavage (1:50 pepsin to antibody ratio (wt:wt)) in 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 4.5, for 24 h. The reaction was stopped by raising the pH to 8.0 with 2.5 M Tris. The F(ab‘)2 fragments were separated from their Fc portions by affinity chromatography using protein A(26Schmaier A.H. Bradford H.N. Lundberg D. Farber A. Colman R.W. Blood. 1990; 75: 1273-1281Google Scholar). A polyclonal rabbit antibody to peptide HKH20 was prepared by covalently coupling peptide HKH20 to a carrier protein, key hole limpet hemocyanin, using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide•HCl (27Goodfriend T.L. Levine L. Fasman G. Science. 1964; 144: 1344-1345Google Scholar) with minor modifications(28Haasemann M. Buschko J. Faussner A. Roscher A.A. Hoebeke J. Burch R.M. Müller-Esterl W. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3882-3892Google Scholar). The resultant conjugates were used to immunize rabbits by standard procedures(29Müller-Esterl W. Johnson D. Salvesen G. Barrett A.A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 163: 240-256Google Scholar). Antisera to peptide conjugates were tested by an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using free peptides (1 μg/ml) or HK (1 μg/ml) as the coating antigen. Immunoselection of specific antibodies was performed by affinity chromatography on peptides covalently coupled to Affi-Gel 10 (4 mg of peptide/ml of gel). The immunoselected antibodies appeared as pure immunoglobulin heavy and light chains on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. 2 mg of lyophilized HK was mixed in 1 ml of 0.01 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, containing 0.25 mM NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction mixture was added to a 10-ml desalting column (Econo-Pac 10DG, Bio-Rad), preequilibrated with a buffer containing 0.1 M sodium phosphate, 0.15 M NaCl, and 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.2. The protein concentration in each fraction was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 7.0 for HK (24Johnson D.A. Salvesen G. Brown M.A. Barrett A.J. Thromb. Res. 1987; 48: 187-193Google Scholar). Incorporation of biotin into HK was determined by the 2-(4′-hydroxyazo-benzene) benzoic acid assay(30Green N.M. Biochem. J. 1965; 94: 23-24Google Scholar), performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Each molecule of HK was labeled with two to three molecules of biotin (biotin-HK) without loss of either its procoagulant or antigenic properties. Biotinyl-glycyl-HKHGHGHGKHKNKGKKNGKH (biotin-HKH20) was synthesized by the Protein and Carbohydrate Structure Facility at the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor, MI) and was purified and analyzed as described above. The peptide was odorless, colorless, and water soluble. Each molecule of peptide contained one molecule of biotin at its amino terminus. HK procoagulant activity was measured using a one-stage, kaolin-activated coagulant assay with a commercial-activated partial thromboplastin time reagent (Organon Technika, Durham NC) (23Schmaier A.H. Colman R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 169: 276-296Google Scholar) with total kininogen-deficient plasma as substrate. This plasma was donated to this laboratory by the late Mayme Williams (Philadelphia, PA). HK and biotin-HK samples were compared to a daily standard curve using pooled normal human plasma diluted 1/10 to 1/1,000 with 0.01 M Tris, 0.15 M NaCl at pH 7.4. 1 unit of activity was defined as that amount of HK procoagulant activity in 1 ml of pooled normal plasma. In certain experiments, investigations were performed to determine if synthetic peptides of D5H or D6H interfered with the procoagulant activity of HK in normal plasma. In these examinations, the peptides were added to pooled normal plasma (George King, Inc., Overland Park, KS, lot 313D) at three final concentrations (500, 250, and 100 μM), and the residual procoagulant activity using an activated partial thromboplastin time was measured. In other experiments, purified anti-HKH20 antibody or rabbit IgG were incubated with pooled normal human plasma in 1.25- to 18-fold molar excess antibody to plasma HK concentration (670 nM), and the residual plasma HK procoagulant activity was measured. The concentrations of purified HK and biotin-HK were determined by radial immunodiffusion(23Schmaier A.H. Colman R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 169: 276-296Google Scholar, 31Schmaier A.H. Silver L.D. Adams A.L. Fischer G.L. Munoz P.G. Vroman L. Colman R.W. Thromb. Res. 1984; 33: 51-67Google Scholar), by their absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 7.0 for HK(24Johnson D.A. Salvesen G. Brown M.A. Barrett A.J. Thromb. Res. 1987; 48: 187-193Google Scholar), and by the Bradford method (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) with identical results. Cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were established as previously described (32Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. Becker C.G. Minick C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 2745-2756Google Scholar, 33Cines D.B. Lyss A.P. Beeber M. Bina M. DeHoratius R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 73: 611-625Google Scholar, 34Maciag T. Cerundolo J. Ilsley S. Kelley P.R. Forand R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5674-5678Google Scholar, 35Schmaier A.H. Kuo A. Lundberg D. Murray S. Cines D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16327-16333Google Scholar). HUVEC were passaged two to four times in medium 199 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Flow Laboratories, McLean, VA), penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and endothelial cell growth factor (34Maciag T. Cerundolo J. Ilsley S. Kelley P.R. Forand R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5674-5678Google Scholar) and grown to confluence on fibronectin-coated 96-well microtiter plates (Nunclon™, product of Nunc Intermed, Denmark and procured from Thomas Scientific, Swedsboro, NJ). HUVEC were always used within 24 h of becoming confluent. All binding experiments were performed at 37°C. HUVEC grown to confluence on 96-well microtiter plates (4 × 104 cells/well) were washed five times in HEPES-Tyrode's binding buffer. The cells were incubated with ~20 nM biotin-HK in HEPES-Tyrode's buffer containing 50 μM Zn2+ at 37°C for various times up to 3 h to achieve equilibrium. Nonspecific binding, unless stated otherwise, was determined by measuring binding in the presence of 50-fold molar excess unlabeled HK or in the absence of 50 μM Zn2+ with equivalent results (10Hasan A.A.K. Cines D.B. Zhang J. Schmaier A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31822-31830Google Scholar). Specific binding was determined by subtracting nonspecific binding from total binding. To determine whether a D5H synthetic peptide could bind directly to endothelial cells, increasing concentrations of biotin-HKH20 were incubated with HUVEC in the absence or presence of 100-fold molar excess unlabeled peptide in HEPES-Tyrode's buffer containing 50 μM of Zn2+ at 37°C for 60 min. To exclude proteolytic degradation of the peptides during the time of the binding experiments, simultaneous experiments were performed under the above conditions except that 0.1 mM captopril, 0.1 mM bacitracin, 0.01 mM phosphoramidon, and 0.2 mM PMSF were added. The stability of some of the peptides also was examined by SDS-PAGE. Biotin-HKH20 and biotin-HNL21 were incubated for 3 h at 37°C over endothelial cells and then electrophoresed on a 20% SDS-PAGE. After transfer to nitrocellulose, they were compared for their structural integrity with the same peptides that were not incubated over the cells. Cell-associated biotin-HK or biotin-HKH20 was measured using ImmunoPure streptavidin horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Pierce) and peroxidase-specific fast-reacting substrate, 3,3′,5,5′, tetramethylbenzidine dihydrochloride (turbo-TMB, Pierce). To do this, the cells were washed three times with HEPES-Tyrode's buffer containing 50 μM Zn2+ and incubated with 100 μl of streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:500) in binding buffer containing 50 μM Zn2+ for an additional hour at room temperature. The cells were then quickly washed five times with 0.01 M sodium phosphate, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.4, and the substrate, turbo-TMB (100 μl), was added for 5 min at room temperature. The color reaction was stopped by adding 1 M phosphoric acid (100 μl), and bound biotinylated protein was quantified by measuring the absorbance of the reaction mixture at 450 nm using a Microplate auto reader EL 311 (Bio-Tek Instrument, Winooski, VT). Investigations were performed with monoclonal antibodies to D5H and D6H to determine their influence on the binding of biotin-HK to endothelial cells. Monoclonal antibody HKL12 to D5H(18Kaufmann J. Haasemann M. Modrow S. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9079-9091Google Scholar), both as whole immunoglobulin and as a F(ab‘)2 fragment, inhibited biotin-HK from binding to endothelial cells (data not shown). Monoclonal antibody HKL12 at 400 nM inhibited 50% of binding of biotin-HK (20 nM). HKL16, a monoclonal antibody directed to the prekallikrein and factor XI binding site on D6H had little influence on biotin-HK binding to endothelial cells (data not shown). The finding that HKL12 partially inhibited the binding of HK to endothelial cells suggested that a cellular binding site for HK was on D5H similar to the HK binding site for M protein(19Ben Nasr A. Herwald H. Müller-Esterl W. Björck L. Biochem. J. 1994; 305: 173-180Google Scholar). However, since the degree of the inhibition was incomplete, we surmised that this antibody and its F(ab‘)2 fragment bound to a site adjacent to the actual D5H cell binding site. With the knowledge that HKL12 partially inhibited biotin-HK binding to endothelial cells and that this antibody blocked D5H from binding to the surface of a bacterium(19Ben Nasr A. Herwald H. Müller-Esterl W. Björck L. Biochem. J. 1994; 305: 173-180Google Scholar), a series of sequential and overlapping peptides to D5H were synthesized (Table 1). Peptides VSP21, GKE19, HNL21, GHG19, FKL20, and HKH20 sequentially spanned the entire amino acid sequence of D5H (Fig. 1, top). Peptides GGH18, HVL24, HKH10, GHG10, and KNK10 are peptides with overlapping sequences of HKH20 (Fig. 1, bottom).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab In our initial investigations, we sought to determine which of these peptides within D5H inhibited biotin-HK binding to endothelial cells and their relative potency (Fig. 2). Starting at the amino-terminal portion of D5H, synthetic peptide VSP21 did not interfere with biotin-HK binding (Fig. 2B). Synthetic peptides GKE19 and HNL21 partially inhibited binding with an IC50 of 792 ± 116 and 215 ± 3 μM, respectively (Fig. 2A). Peptides GHG19 and FKL20 from the middle portion of D5H had no influence on biotin-HK binding to endothelial cells (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, peptide HKH20 from the carboxyl-terminal portion of D5H was a potent inhibitor of biotin-HK binding with an IC50 of 0.23 ± 0.02 μM (Fig. 2B). Overlapping peptides (GGH18, HVL24) of the HKH20 sequence were then synthesized to analyze this region in greater detail (Fig. 1, Table 1). Peptide GGH18 consisted of 10 additional residues on the amino terminus and lacked 12 carboxyl-terminal residues of HKH20. Peptide HVL24 had 8 additional residues at the amino terminus and was 4 residues shorter at the carboxyl terminus than HKH20. Both GGH18 and HVL24 inhibited biotin-HK binding with an IC50 of 108 ± 6 and 0.8 ± 0.09 μM, respectively. These data indicated that there were two candidate regions on D5H, one of low affinity in the amino-terminal area and another of much higher affinity in the carboxyl-terminal portion, that can participate in HK cell binding. Since the apparent IC50 for the synthetic peptides from these two regions differed by 103, further investigations concentrated on HKH20, a peptide that bound to HUVEC with higher affinity. We then investigated if biotin-HKH20 would directly bind to endothelial cells (Fig. 3). Biotin-HKH20 specifically bound to endothelial cells when added at concentrations ≥30 nM. At each concentration of added biotin-HKH20 (30 nM to 10 μM), a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled HKH20 blocked binding (Fig. 3). Investigations were next performed to determine the specificity of biotin-HKH20 binding to endothelial cells (Fig. 4). HK was able to prevent biotin-HKH20 from binding to endothelial cells with an IC50 of 0.2 μM (Fig. 4A). These data indicated that HK and biotin-HKH20 bound at or near the same site on endothelial cells. The binding of biotin-HKH20 was highly specific. Peptides GHG19 from D5H and LDC27 from D3 (Table 1) both at 1 mM had no influence on biotin-HKH20 binding (Fig. 4A). Peptide GGH18, which overlapped the sequence of HKH20, inhibited biotin-HKH20 binding 40% at 100 μM (Fig. 4A). Further, peptides HKH20 and HVL24, the latter of which overlaps the amino-terminal portion of HKH20 by 16 residues, inhibited biotin-HKH20 binding equally with an IC50 of 1.0 μM (Fig. 4B). These studies showed that biotin-HKH20 was specifically displaced from the endothelial cell membrane only by peptides with overlapping sequences. Both HKH20 and HVL24 were stable for the duration of incubation with endothelial cells. When these peptides were incubated with endothelial cells in the presence of 0.1 mM captopril, 0.1 mM bacitracin, 0.01 mM phosphoramidon, and 0.2 mM PMSF, the IC50 values of these peptides on biotin-HKH20 binding were identical to that reported above for incubations performed in the absence of inhibitors (data not shown). Peptide stability during the incubation period with endothelial cells was examined further. When biotin-HKH20 was incubated with HUVEC for up to 3 h at 37°C, there was no change in the apparent molecular mass of the incubated versus unincubated peptides as seen on electroblotted nitrocellulose of a 20% SDS-PAGE of the peptides (data not shown).Figure 4:Inhibition of biotin-HKH20 binding to endothelial cells. PanelA, biotin-HKH20 (500 nM) in HEPES-Tyrode's buffer containing 50 μM Zn2+ was incubated with endothelial cells in the presence of 0.1 nM to 3 μM HK (○) or GGH18 (•), LDC27 (∆), or GHG19 (▴). The percent bound biotin-HKH20 shown was determined by comparing the binding of biotin-HKH20 in the presence of HK or peptide competitors to that seen in the absence of the competitors. The data shown are the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments for HK and single, representative experiments for each of the peptides. PanelB, biotin-HKH20 (500 nM) in HEPES-Tyrode's buffer containing 50 μM Zn2+ was incubated with endothelial cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of HKH20 (○) or HVL24 (•). The percent bound biotin-HKH20 shown was determined by comparing the binding of biotin-HKH20 in the presence and absence of each peptide. The data shown are the mean ± S.E. for three experiments. The absence of error bars seen for some of the points indicates that the errors were very small.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Studies were performed to map further the cell binding region of HKH20 (Fig. 5). KNK10, which consists of the carboxyl-terminal 10 amino acids of HKH20, did not inhibit biotin-HKH20 from binding to endothelial cells. At ~700 μM, GHG10, which consists of the middle 10 amino acids of HKH20, inhibited the binding of biotin-HKH20 by 50%. HKH10, which consists of the amino-terminal 10 amino acids of HKH20, inhibited biotin-HKH20 binding with an IC50 of ~80 μM. Thus, these first 10 amino acids of HKH20 were 80-fold less potent inhibitors than HKH20 itself. Again, the presence of protease inhibitors (captopril, bacitracin, phosphoramidon, and PMSF) all at the same concentrations used above did not enhance inhibition of biotin-HKH20 binding by these peptides (data not shown). These data indicated that under the conditions of the binding experiments, these small peptides were stable as well. Since peptide HKH20 had the highest inhibitory capacity, a rabbit anti-HKH20 antibody was produced. The anti-HKH20 antibody, unlike preimmune rabbit IgG, inhibited biotin-HK binding in a concentration-dependent fashion with an IC50 of 30 nM, i.e. a 3-fold molar excess antibody to biotin-HK (Fig. 6A). Since D5H contains the surface binding region for HK procoagulant activity(20Schmaier A.H. Schutsky D. Farber A. Silver L.D. Bradford H.N. Colman R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1405-1411Google Scholar, 21De La Cadena R.A. Colman R.W. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 151-160Google Scholar, 22Kunapuli S. De La Cadena R.A. Colman R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2486-2492Google Scholar), we determined if the anti-HKH20 antibody also would inhibit HK procoagulant activity (Fig. 6B). Equimolar concentrations of preimmune rabbit IgG to anti-HKH20 antibody to plasma HK (670 nM) inhibited the procoagulant activity of HK <5% (data not shown). In contrast, anti-HKH20 antibody reduced plasma HK procoagulant activity in concentrations >3.6 μM (i.e. 5-fold molar excess above that of plasma HK). These data suggested that the binding site that comprised the HKH20 sequence in D5H was critical for the expression of HK procoagulant activity on artificial surfaces. Investigations were next performed to determine if the synthetic peptides themselves, which inhibited HK binding to endothelial cells, also interfered with HK procoagulant activity. As previously reported, peptide SDD31 of D6H blocked the procoagulant activity of plasma HK presumably by blocking prekallikrein and factor XI binding and activation on the artificial surfaces (36Tait J.F. Fujikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15396-15401Google Scholar, 37Tait J.F. Fujikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11651-11657Google Scholar, 38Vogel R. Kaufmann J. Chung D.W. Kellermann J. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12494-12502Google Scholar). Both HKH20 and HVL24 at 500 μM also produced a greater than 2-fold inhibition in HK-mediated procoagulant activity in normal plasma, similar to SDD31 (Fig. 7). This inhibition of the coagulation time was concentration dependent over a range of 100-500 μM (data not shown). It was also specific to this region on D5H. No other peptide that comprised any other portion of D5H inhibited HK procoagulant activity. The anticoagulant activity of HKH20 and HVL24 must have been dependent in part upon the size and affinity of the peptides because HKH10 at 500 μM did not block the procoagulant activity of HK in plasma (data not shown). This investigation identifies the endothelial cell binding regions on D5H. The present investigations map non-overlapping areas of D5H, which have cell binding properties. Two tandem sequences, GKE19 and HNL21, on the amino-terminal portion of D5H have relatively low affinity for cells (IC50 = 792 and 215 μM, respectively). A second sequence, HKH20, which is on the carboxyl-terminal portion of D5H, directly binds to endothelial cells and inhibits biotin-HK binding with an IC50 of 0.23 μM. Since the IC50 for inhibition of biotin HK binding by GKE19 and HNL21 is 3443- and 935-fold higher, respectively, than HKH20, we believe that HKH20 represents the major cell attachment site of the HK light chain. Whether the HKH20 region in native HK binds with higher affinity than the GKE19 and/or the HNL21 regions is not known. Alternatively, peptides GKE19 and HNL21 could bind to HUVEC because they mimic the sequence or amino acid composition of HKH20. A pentapeptide HGHKH present in GGH18 and HVL24 also is present in HNL21. A tetrapeptide GHGH present in GGH18, HVL24, and HKH20 is seen twice in HNL21. It is of interest that monoclonal antibody HKL12 and its F(ab')2, whose target epitope is located on peptide GHG19(18Kaufmann J. Haasemann M. Modrow S. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9079-9091Google Scholar), partially inhibited HK binding to cells even though it was not directed to a cell binding region itself. These data are consistent with either a steric effect of the antibodies or a change in the conformation of the cell binding site(s) of HK as result of the antibody binding to an adjacent region. This latter phenomena would be similar to what we previously reported about a monoclonal antibody directed to the heavy chain of the kininogens(39Jiang Y.P. Nawarawong W. Meloni F.J. Schmaier A.H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1992; 68: 143-148Google Scholar). The finding that anti-HKH20 antibody and synthetic peptides HKH20 and HVL24 also inhibited the procoagulant activity of plasma HK are consistent with the notion that this region of D5H is the HK artificial surface binding site. The procoagulant activity of HK consists of two activities: the ability to bind to artificial surfaces and the ability to approximate prekallikrein and factor XI to the surface(20Schmaier A.H. Schutsky D. Farber A. Silver L.D. Bradford H.N. Colman R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1405-1411Google Scholar, 21De La Cadena R.A. Colman R.W.

Chem. 1990; 265: 12494-12502Google Scholar). The finding that the peptide SDD31 blocked the procoagulant activity is consistent with inhibition of prekallikrein and factor XI binding to HK, a function of D6H(36Tait J.F. Fujikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15396-15401Google Scholar, 37Tait J.F. Fujikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11651-11657Google Scholar, 38Vogel R. Kaufmann J. Chung D.W. Kellermann J. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12494-12502Google Scholar). The additional finding that HKH20 and HVL24 reduce the procoagulant activity of HK indicates that these D5H peptides must be interfering with the binding of HK to artificial, negatively charged surfaces(20Schmaier A.H. Schutsky D. Farber A. Silver L.D. Bradford H.N. Colman R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1405-1411Google Scholar, 21De La Cadena R.A. Colman R.W. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 151-160Google Scholar, 22Kunapuli S. De La Cadena R.A. Colman R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2486-2492Google Scholar). Although we have not investigated the direct binding of HKH20 and HVL24 to artificial surfaces, the data presented are consistent with the notion that these D5H peptides compete with the HK light chain for kaolin binding. This idea is further supported by the recent finding that HK specifically binds to a bacterial surface protein by the HKH20 sequence on D5H(19Ben Nasr A. Herwald H. Müller-Esterl W. Björck L. Biochem. J. 1994; 305: 173-180Google Scholar). A segment of the histidine-glycine-rich region on D5H, which overlaps peptide HNL21, has been implicated in binding to artificial surfaces(21De La Cadena R.A. Colman R.W. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 151-160Google Scholar, 22Kunapuli S. De La Cadena R.A. Colman R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2486-2492Google Scholar). Our finding that HNL21 is a relatively weak inhibitor of cell binding and does not interfere with the procoagulant activity of HK suggests that HNL21 may be of minor importance for the docking of HK to “natural” surfaces such as endothelial cell membranes. Overall, our data suggest that the major binding region(s) on D5H for biologic surfaces overlaps with binding segments for artificial surfaces such as kaolin and dextran sulfate. This finding indicates that efforts by many laboratories to characterize HK interaction with artificial surfaces pointed to the region on D5H that interacts with biologic membranes. It is quite striking that HK has been characterized to have multiple linear amino acid sequences that participate in cell binding. Peptide LDC27 on D3(9Jiang Y. Müller-Esterl W. Schmaier A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3712-3717Google Scholar, 40Herwald H. Hasan A.A.K. Godovac-Zimmermann J. Schmaier A.H. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14634-14642Google Scholar), peptide GFSPFRSSRIG on D4(10Hasan A.A.K. Cines D.B. Zhang J. Schmaier A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31822-31830Google Scholar), and peptide HKH20 on D5H are separated regions on the HK protein molecule that inhibit HK binding to endothelial cells to varying degrees. HKH20 on D5H is a more potent peptide inhibitor of HK binding to endothelial cells (IC50 = 0.23 μM) than LDC27 on D3 (IC50 = 60 μM) (40Herwald H. Hasan A.A.K. Godovac-Zimmermann J. Schmaier A.H. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14634-14642Google Scholar). Peptide GFSPFRSSRIG on D4 is the weakest inhibitor (IC50 = 1 mM), although its presence in HK is essential for maximal binding of HK to endothelium(10Hasan A.A.K. Cines D.B. Zhang J. Schmaier A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31822-31830Google Scholar, 17Hasan A.A.K. Cines D.B. Ngaiza J.R. Jaffe E.A. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 1995; 85: 3134-3143Google Scholar). The significance of these multiple and discrete binding regions for HK is not known. The data are consistent with a model in which these domains form a discontinuous interface with a complementary docking site(s), i.e. putative receptor(s). Placement of kininogen on cells contributes to the anticoagulant nature of the intravascular compartment by selectively inhibiting α-thrombin's activation of platelets and endothelial cells(5Meloni F.J. Schmaier A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6786-6794Google Scholar, 6Meloni F.J. Gustafson E.J. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 1992; 79: 1233-1244Google Scholar, 9Jiang Y. Müller-Esterl W. Schmaier A.H. J. Biol.

The full biologic significance of kininogens interacting with their cell binding site(s) will not be fully appreciated until the kininogen receptor(s) is characterized. We express appreciation to Dr. Weersak Nawarawong for assistance in the performance of some of the preliminary experiments in this investigation and to Dr. Armin Maidhof for help with the antibody production."

A cell-free extract from an Escherichia coli strain containing a cloned bioB (biotin synthase) gene was incubated with [14C]dethiobiotin, which was converted to [14C]biotin. The assay was used to identify the low molecular weight compounds and two of the proteins that, in addition to the bioB gene product, are required for biotin synthase activity in vitro. The low molecular weight compounds are cysteine; S-adenosylmethionine; thiamine pyrophosphate; Fe2+; a pyridine nucleotide (the most effective being NADPH); and one of the amino acids asparagine, aspartate, glutamine, or serine. The proteins are flavodoxin and ferredoxin (flavodoxin)-NADP+ reductase (EC 1.18.1.2). A third thiamine pyrophosphate-dependent protein is also required for activity. When the cell-free extract was incubated with nonlabeled dethiobiotin and either [35S]cysteine or [35S]cystine, 35S was incorporated into biotin, and we present further evidence that cysteine, and not S-adenosylmethionine or methionine, is the sulfur donor for the biotin synthase reaction.

The vitamin biotin is synthesized by microorganisms (1Eisenberg M. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1987: 544-550Google Scholar) and plants (2Baldet P. Gerbling H. Axiotis S. Douce R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It is an essential cofactor for carboxylase-catalyzed reactions, where it is bound through its side chain carboxyl group via an amide bond to the ϵ-amino group of a specific enzyme lysine residue, and functions by carrying activated carbon dioxide on the N-1′ atom(3Knowles J.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 195-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Biotin is both of great commercial and scientific interest. It is sold as a pharmaceutical and as a food, feed, and cosmetic additive. It is synthesized chemically on an industrial scale by multistep processes (4Goldberg M.W. Sternbach L.H. U. S. Patents 2,489,232, 2,489,235, and 2,489,238. Nov. 22 1949; Google Scholar, 5McGarrity J. Tenud L.H. U. S. Patent 4,876,350. Oct. 24 1989; Google Scholar), but intensive research is also being carried out into developing a microbiological production method(6Brown S.W. Kamogawa K. Biotechnol. Genet. Eng. Rev. 1991; 9: 295-326PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the pathway in plants is a potential target for herbicide action(2Baldet P. Gerbling H. Axiotis S. Douce R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The biotin biosynthetic pathway in bacteria, especially that of Escherichia coli and Bacillus sphaericus, has been widely investigated(7Lévy-Schil S. Debussche L. Rigault S. Soubrier F. Bacchetta F. Lagneaux D. Schleuniger J. Blanche F. Crouzet J. Mayaux J.-F. Appl. Microbiol. Biotech. 1993; 38: 755-762Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 8Ohsawa I. Kisou T. Kodama K. Yoneda I. Speck D. Gloeckler R. Lemoine Y. Kamogawa K. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 1992; 73: 121-124Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The steps leading to the formation of pimeloyl-CoA in E. coli are still unclear(9Sanyal I. Lee S.-L. Flint D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 2637-2638Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 10Ifuku O. Miyaoka H. Koga N. Kishimoto J. Haze S. Wachi Y. Kajiwara M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), but the pathway from pimeloyl-CoA to biotin is well understood, with the exception of the last step, the conversion of dethiobiotin to biotin. This reaction involves the insertion of a sulfur atom between two unsaturated carbon atoms to form the thiophene ring of biotin and is catalyzed by biotin synthase, the product of the bioB gene(11Rolfe B. Eisenberg M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1968; 96: 515-524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar enzyme-catalyzed reactions involving sulfur insertion occur in the synthesis of isopenicillin N(12Chen V.J. Orville A.M. Harpel M.R. Frolik C.A. Surerus K.K. Münck E. Lipscomb J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21677-21681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), lipoic acid (13Reed K.E. Cronan J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1325-1336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and thiamine(14DeMoll E. Shive W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 132: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which unactivated C-H bonds in these compounds are converted to C-S bonds is of considerable interest. It is only in the last 2 or 3 years, with the introduction of assay methods in vitro, that detailed investigation of biotin synthase has been possible(15Ifuku O. Kishimoto J. Haze S. Yanagi M. Fukushima S. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1992; 56: 1780-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 16Fujisawa A. Abe T. Ohsawa I. Kamogawa K. Izumi Y. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 110: 1-4Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 17Birch O.M. Brass J. Fuhrmann M. Shaw N.M. PCT Patent Application WO 94/08023. Apr. 14 1994; Google Scholar). Experiments to try to elucidate the mechanism of the reaction and to identify possible intermediates had until then been carried out with whole cells. The results obtained from such experiments were not always conclusive, because possible precursors or intermediates for the reaction could be extensively metabolized within the cell before incorporation into biotin(18Baxter R.L. Camp D.J. Coutts A. Shaw N. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1992; 1: 255-258Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Nevertheless it had been established that the biotin synthase reaction may proceed by way of a radical mechanism(19Marti F.B. Eidgenossischen Technischen Hochschule, Doctoral dissertation 7236, ETH Zurich. 1983; Google Scholar), and that hydroxylated intermediates or intermediates with carbon-carbon double bonds are probably not involved(20Marquet A. Frappier F. Guillerm G. Azoulay M. Florentin D. Tabet J.-C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 2145-2193Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The origin of sulfur in biotin has been investigated in a number of microorganisms, using whole cells, and various sulfur donors have been proposed. It has been established that in E. coli the sulfur atom in biotin is derived from cysteine, but one or more steps may be involved between cysteine and the direct sulfur donor for the reaction(21DeMoll E. Shive W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 110: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 22DeMoll E. White R.H. Shive W. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 558-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A recent report in which cysteine is shown to act as sulfur donor for the biotin synthase reaction in vitro confirms the involvement of cysteine, but it does not rule out the possibility of further metabolism of the cysteine before incorporation into biotin(23Florentin D. Tse Sum Bui B. Marquet A. Oshiro T. Izumi Y. C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris. 1994; 317: 485-488PubMed Google Scholar). The identity of the direct sulfur donor for biotin synthase therefore remains unknown and can only be established using a defined assay system for biotin synthase in vitro. Our group aims to produce biotin on an industrial scale by fermentation, and to this end we have cloned the bio operon from E. coli and overexpressed the biosynthetic enzymes (17Birch O.M. Brass J. Fuhrmann M. Shaw N.M. PCT Patent Application WO 94/08023. Apr. 14 1994; Google Scholar). We found that the biotin synthase step was limiting for our process, and consequently, we have focussed our attention on this reaction. When we started this work, no assay method was available for biotin synthase in vitro, despite years of work by many research groups. The original aim of our research was to develop an assay for biotin synthase in vitro, to identify the direct sulfur donor for the reaction, and to purify and characterize the enzyme. We modified our third aim when we found that the enzyme requires a number of low molecular weight compounds and proteins for activity in vitro. It then became of interest to us to identify all of the components of the enzyme system in case this knowledge could be used to improve our biotin fermentation process. These experiments were also an important prerequisite for detailed kinetic and mechanistic studies. This paper describes our findings. The work described here was carried out using E. coli BM4062(24Barker D.F. Campbell A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 789-800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), containing the plasmid pBO30A-15/9, which carries the genes bioBFCDAOrf1, or E. coli XL1-Blue (25Bullock W.O. Fernandez J.M. Short J.M. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 376-379Google Scholar) containing the plasmid pBO74ΔB, identical to pBO30A-15/9 but with the bioB gene deleted (17Birch O.M. Brass J. Fuhrmann M. Shaw N.M. PCT Patent Application WO 94/08023. Apr. 14 1994; Google Scholar). The strains and extracts derived from them will be referred to as “biotin synthase plus” and “biotin synthase minus,” respectively. The host strains both carry the wild-type chromosomal genes for biotin synthase, but these are repressed under the conditions of our experiments. Dethiobiotin was chemically synthesized by Dr. Laurent Duc, Lonza AG. [14C]Dethiobiotin (57.2 mCi•mmol−1) was custom synthesized by Isotopchem, Ganagobie, France. D-[carbonyl-14C]Biotin, (50-60 mCi•mmol−1), L-[35S]cystine (100.3 mCi•mmol−1), and L-[35S]cysteine (>600 Ci•mmol−1) were from Amersham Corp. L-[35S]Methionine (>1000 Ci•mmol−1) was from DuPont NEN. All other chemicals were either from Sigma or Fluka and were the purest grade available. Cells were grown at 37°C in nutrient yeast broth (NYB) medium (nutrient broth no. 2, Oxoid, 25 g•liter−1; yeast-extract, Oxoid, 5 g•liter−1) with the addition of chloramphenicol (20 μg•ml−1) for plasmid stability. Cells were grown on both small scale in shake flasks, and in fermenters of up to 800 liters. Cells were harvested in the exponential phase and concentrated by filtration and centrifugation. After washing in 100 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, they were resuspended to a cell density equivalent to an absorbance of 500 (measured spectrophotometrically at 600 nm) and broken open with a continuous cell homogenizer (Stansted Fluid Power Ltd., Stansted, United Kingdom, model LD10-30-P-C). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min, and the resulting cell-free extract was stored at 80°C. A cell-free extract from the biotin synthase plus strain, free of low molecular weight components, was prepared by desalting either once or twice on Sephadex G-25 M gel-filtration columns (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., PD-10). When necessary, extracts were concentrated after desalting by ultrafiltration using Centricon 10 microconcentrators (Amicon). To assay biotin synthase activity in vitro, the incorporation of radioactive label from either [14C]dethiobiotin, [35S]cystine or [35S]cysteine into biotin was measured in the presence of a cell-free extract or protein fraction. A typical standard assay, with a biotin synthase plus cell-free extract, including all of the cofactors that we know to be essential for the reaction, was as follows: cell-free extract (typically 50 μl, 2.75 mg of protein or 100 μl, 5.5 mg of protein) was incubated in a final volume of 250 μl at pH 7.5 with Fe2+-gluconate (50 nmol), NADPH (25 nmol), thiamine pyrophosphate (25 nmol), S-adenosylmethionine (23 nmol), asparagine (3.75 μmol), dithiothreitol (250 nmol), Hepes buffer (25 μmol), and either [14C]dethiobiotin (0.1 μCi, 1.95 nmol) plus cysteine (83 nmol), or nonlabeled dethiobiotin (23 nmol) plus [35S]cysteine (20 μCi, 1.32 nmol). All compounds except the labeled materials were prepared in Hepes buffer. After incubation at 37°C for 1 h, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 250 μl of 12.5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. Precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was loaded on to a disposable C18 solid phase extraction column (Macherey-Nagel, Chromabond C18 ec, 100 mg) that had been equilibrated with methanol (1 ml), water (1 ml), and 1% (v/v) acetic acid (1 ml). After washing with 1% (v/v) acetic acid (1 ml) and water (1 ml), [14C]dethiobiotin and [14C]biotin or [35S]biotin were eluted with 0.5 ml of methanol. The samples were dried under vacuum and resuspended in buffer suitable for TLC 1The abbreviations used are: TLCthin layer chromatographyHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. or HPLC analysis. thin layer chromatography high performance liquid chromatography polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Samples for semiquantitative analysis by TLC and autoradiography were resuspended in 20 μl of methanol/water/acetic acid (65:25:10), and 2.5 μl was loaded on to a silica gel high performance TLC plate (E. Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). TLC plates were developed with chloroform/methanol/formic acid (17:3:0.2) and then exposed to x-ray film (β-max, Amersham Corp.) for autoradiography. Samples for quantitative analysis were resuspended in 50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 3.5, containing 20 mM triethylamine and 203 mg•liter−1 each of dethiobiotin and biotin as carrier, and analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC using a Hewlett-Packard ODS Hypersil, 2.1 mm × 200 mm, 5-μm particle size column. The eluent was 10% (v/v) acetonitrile in 50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 3.5, containing 20 mM triethylamine, and the column was at 35°C. Dethiobiotin and biotin were detected at 191 nm, and radioactivity was measured with a Berthold LB 506 C-1 on-line radioactivity detector equipped with a Z-200 (200 μl volume) cell and Winflow radiochromatography software. The flow rate through the column was 0.35 ml•min−1 and the total flow through the cell was 1.75 ml•min−1, including the scintillator (Quickzint Flow 303, Zinsser Analytic, Maidenhead, UK). In addition to the TLC and HPLC methods described above, different TLC and HPLC eluents were used to confirm the identity of the radioactive biotin produced in the assays. For TLC, butanol-1/water/acetic acid (65:25:10) was the eluent with the silica-gel high performance TLC plates. For HPLC, a paired-ion method was used. The column was the same as that used for the reverse-phase method, but the eluent was 80 mM KH2PO4, pH 6.5, plus 4.2 mM tetrabutyl ammonium phosphate and 16% (v/v) methanol. The column was at 40°C. This was by Edman degradation with either a model 473A or a model 477A Microsequencer (Applied Biosystems) equipped with Pro-blott reaction cartridges. Preparation of the sample of flavodoxin for sequencing was as described in (26Hughes G.J. Frutiger S. Paquet N. Jaton J.-C. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 641-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), except that for the purification of the tryptic peptides the HPLC method at pH 2 was used before that at pH 7. Protein samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE either by the method described in (27Ferreira R.B. Davies D.D. Plant Physiol. 1987; 83: 869-877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or with a Pharmacia Phast System. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting for sequencing were carried out using the methods described in (28Schägger H. Von Jagow G. Anal.

Polyvinylidine difluoride membranes were stained with Amido Black and destained with water. Bands of interest were excised, dried at room temperature, and stored at 4°C before microsequencing. The enriched protein fractions described below were not concentrated to a specific protein concentration, but they were prepared so that 50 μl of each protein fraction gave a clear signal in the in vitro assay. The volumes of the protein fractions used are specified for each assay. A 100,000 × g supernatant, prepared from a biotin synthase plus cell-free extract was diluted to ~10 mg•ml−1 of protein with 20 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mM dithiothreitol. The extract (500 ml, ~5 g of protein) was loaded on to an anion-exchange column (Pharmacia Q Sepharose Fast Flow, 50-mm diameter × 125-mm height, 245-ml bed volume) equilibrated with the same buffer. Biotin synthase was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0-600 mM) in the Tris/dithiothreitol buffer in 1500 ml. The flow rate was 5 ml•min−1. Biotin synthase eluted in the position shown in Fig. 1. Fractions were tested for biotin synthase activity using a modified standard assay, in which a biotin synthase minus cell-free extract and the fractions to be assayed replaced the biotin synthase plus extract. Fractions with the highest biotin synthase activity were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and stored at −80°C. Biotin synthase plus thiamine pyrophosphate was prepared by the same method, except that thiamine pyrophosphate (1 g•liter−1) was added to the buffers, and all fractions with biotin synthase activity were pooled, including the fractions with weaker activity that eluted after the main peak, as these fractions contained the thiamine pyrophosphate-dependent protein. Our results have shown that at least three additional proteins are required for biotin synthase activity in vitro. We describe these as the biotin synthase accessory proteins. Two methods were used for the preparation of enriched fractions of these accessory proteins. Initially, ammonium sulfate fractionation was used, but while purifying these proteins, it became apparent that they could be separated by anion-exchange chromatography (Q Sepharose Fast Flow, Pharmacia). The accessory proteins and biotin synthase could therefore be purified from the same cell-free extract, as they were separated in the first chromatographic step (Fig. 1). In the later stages of this work, enriched flavodoxin and ferredoxin (flavodoxin) NADP+ reductase preparations were routinely obtained from biotin synthase plus cell-free extracts using the chromatographic method. Biotin synthase minus cell-free extract was brought to 55% saturation with ammonium sulfate, and the precipitate was removed by centrifugation. The flavodoxin-containing supernatant was desalted into 100 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.5 (Sephadex G-25M PD-10 gel-filtration column, Pharmacia), concentrated, and stored at −80°C. A biotin synthase minus cell-free extract was precipitated with 45% saturation of ammonium sulfate. The precipitated protein was resuspended in 100 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, desalted, (Sephadex G-25M PD-10 gel-filtration column, Pharmacia), concentrated, and stored at −80°C. This was prepared from a biotin synthase plus cell-free extract with the Q Sepharose Fast Flow column (Fig. 1). Fractions containing the enzyme were concentrated by ultrafiltration and stored at −80°C. An enriched preparation, free from the other accessory proteins, was prepared from a biotin synthase plus cell-free extract by anion-exchange chromatography on Q Sepharose (Fig. 1). Modifications of the assay described above were used to detect the accessory proteins during purification. All assays contained [14C]dethiobiotin, cysteine, asparagine, and the cofactors described above, but Mg2+-ATP (250 nmol) and methionine (67 nmol) were used instead of S-adenosylmethionine. Using the enriched protein fractions, assays specific for each of the accessory proteins were developed. Flavodoxin activity was measured in a modified standard assay with enriched biotin synthase (50 μl) and the 0-45% ammonium sulfate fraction (80 μl). Ferredoxin (flavodoxin) NADP+ reductase was assayed using enriched biotin synthase containing the thiamine pyrophosphate-dependent protein (biotin synthase plus thiamine pyrophosphate, 50 μl) and enriched flavodoxin (50 μl) prepared by ammonium sulfate precipitation. The thiamine pyrophosphate-dependent protein was assayed using enriched biotin synthase (50 μl), pure flavodoxin (5 μl), and enriched ferredoxin (flavodoxin) NADP+ reductase (50 μl) prepared by anion-exchange chromatography. The enriched fractions were largely undefined in terms of protein content, and the separation of biotin synthase and the accessory proteins was not always absolute. This resulted in weak background activity in some of the assays. For the purification of each protein, the fractions containing the strongest activity were selected for further steps. When the biotin synthase system was reconstituted using purer fractions, no background activity was detected in assays where one of the components was missed out. Biotin synthase activity was measured in biotin synthase plus cell-free extracts by incubation with [14C]dethiobiotin followed by isolation and analysis of the resulting [14C]biotin. The addition of cofactors or metal ions was not necessary when freshly prepared extracts were used. [14C]Biotin could be detected after 5-15 min of incubation. The reaction was not sensitive to oxygen. Fig. 2 shows the results of typical in vitro assays for biotin synthase with either [14C]dethiobiotin or [35S]cysteine as the source of radioactive label. Detection of [14C]biotin was by TLC and autoradiography (Fig. 2A) or by HPLC with on-line radiochemical detection (Fig. 2B). When the cell-free extract was incubated with nonlabeled dethiobiotin plus [35S]cysteine, the resulting biotin was 35S-labeled (Fig. 2, A and C). For the experiments described below, the reaction conditions were controlled so that product formation was linear with respect to incubation time. One of the radioactive compounds produced in the [14C]dethiobiotin and [35S]cysteine assays had the same chromatographic properties as a [14C]biotin standard when analyzed using two TLC solvent systems and two HPLC methods (reverse-phase and paired-ion). Moreover, this compound was only detected in assays where both cell-free extract containing the cloned and over-expressed biotin synthase (bioB)gene and dethiobiotin were present, was derived from dethiobiotin ([14C]dethiobiotin assay), and could be labeled with 35S ([35S]cysteine assay). The compound also supported growth of the biotin auxotroph Lactobacillus plantarum. These results provide strong evidence that the compound was biotin. The identity of the other radioactive compounds is at present unknown. The incorporation of 35S from cysteine into biotin by the biotin synthase plus cell-free extract suggested that cysteine was either the direct sulfur donor or closely related to the sulfur donor for the reaction. A cell-free extract, free of low molecular weight compounds, was prepared by gel filtration chromatography. When incubated with [14C]dethiobiotin and cysteine or dethiobiotin and [35S]cysteine, this extract had no biotin synthase activity. Activity could be restored by adding a low molecular weight fraction, which was prepared by passing the total cell-free extract through an ultrafiltration membrane with a molecular weight cut-off value of 10,000. The amount of biotin produced in this assay was increased by the addition of thiamine pyrophosphate, ATP, Fe2+, and a pyridine nucleotide. Since NADPH was the most effective of the pyridine nucleotides(17Birch O.M. Brass J. Fuhrmann M. Shaw N.M. PCT Patent Application WO 94/08023. Apr. 14 1994; Google Scholar), it was used in all subsequent experiments. However, alone or in combination these compounds only stimulated activity, and they could not substitute for the low molecular weight fraction. This showed that one or more compounds present in the low molecular weight fraction, in addition to those added to the assay, were required for activity. These essential low molecular weight compounds could be provided by a protein-free fraction prepared from E. coli cells by boiling or ultrafiltration or by a solution of commercial yeast extract (Difco, 5 μl of a 100 mg•ml−1 solution in the assay). Initial attempts to isolate the active compounds either from the E. coli low molecular weight fraction or from yeast extract proved difficult but indicated that amino acids were involved. Consequently a screening approach was adopted in which amino acids were tested individually and in combinations. The results of these experiments (Table1) showed that the active compounds were methionine, cysteine, and one of asparagine, aspartate, glutamine, or serine. Methionine was required at a concentration of greater than 10 μM. Subsequent experiments showed that S-adenosylmethionine could substitute for ATP and methionine, indicating that S-adenosylmethionine is the active compound in vivo(31Markham G.D. Hafner E.W. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9082-9092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A concentration of cysteine of between 10 and 500 μM was required for activity, and D-cysteine could replace L-cysteine without any loss of activity. Asparagine, aspartate, glutamine, or serine at 1 mM resulted in very weak activity, whereas a concentration of 15 mM resulted in higher activity. Asparagine had the strongest effect, followed by aspartate, glutamine, and serine. The other 16 physiological amino acids (with the exception of cysteine and methionine, which have already been discussed) had no effect.TABLE I Open table in a new tab When cell-free systems were reconstituted from enriched and purified preparations of the proteins required for activity in vitro (see below), the following low molecular weight compounds, in addition to dethiobiotin, were essential for activity: S-adenosylmethionine; NADPH; Fe2+; cysteine; thiamine pyrophosphate; and one of the amino acids asparagine, aspartate, glutamine, or serine. This is the first report of the involvement of thiamine pyrophosphate and the amino acids asparagine, aspartate, glutamine, or serine with the biotin synthase system. Potential sulfur donors for the biotin synthase reaction were tested in the assay system consisting of the desalted biotin synthase plus extract and the low molecular weight compounds required for activity. Addition of [35S]cysteine or [35S]cystine resulted in the production of [35S]biotin. The incorporation of 35S from [35S]cysteine into biotin in the presence of other sulfur compounds was then investigated (Table2). When concentrations of S-adenosylmethionine or homocysteine more than 11-fold in excess of the [35S]cysteine concentration were added to the assay, the amount of 35S incorporated into biotin was unchanged, showing that the sulfur atoms from these compounds were not incorporated into biotin. However, when an excess of L-cysteine or D-cysteine was added, the amount of 35S incorporated into biotin was reduced to a level that was undetectable by HPLC analysis, showing that the labeled sulfur had been diluted out by the unlabeled sulfur.TABLE II Open table in a new tab If [35S]methionine was used as the source of radiolabeled sulfur in the assay, an 35S-labeled compound with an RF value similar to that of biotin was seen when the samples were analyzed by TLC and autoradiography (Fig. 3). However, HPLC analysis showed that this compound was not biotin, and therefore methionine did not provide the sulfur atom for biotin. We have not yet identified this compound. If S-adenosylmethionine was the sulfur donor, 35S from labeled methionine would be incorporated into biotin, as methionine is a precursor for S-adenosylmethionine. This provides further evidence that S-adenosylmethionine is not the sulfur donor for biotin synthesis in E. coli. The proteins in a biotin synthase plus cell-free extract were separated on an anion-exchange column as indicated in Fig. 1, and fractions were assayed for biotin synthase activity. No activity was found in any of the fractions. However, when a biotin synthase minus cell-free extract, which alone had no detectable biotin synthase activity in vitro, was added to the fractions, a clear peak of biotin synthase activity was detected. This showed that one or more proteins in addition to biotin synthase were required for activity and that the loss of biotin synthase activity after the anion-exchange column was not due to inactivation of the biotin synthase itself but due to the absence of the accessory protein or proteins. Having established that one or more proteins in addition to biotin synthase were essential for activity in vitro, we developed assays specific for these proteins. These assays contained biotin synthase (free of the accessory proteins and prepared by anion-exchange chromatography, as described under “Materials and Methods”), low molecular weight components, and the fractions to be tested. Fractionation of a biotin synthase minus cell-free extract by ammonium sulfate precipitation led to the identification of two active fra"

In this paper we present evidence that the DnaK protein binds not only to short hydrophobic peptides, which are in an extended conformation, but also efficiently recognizes large native proteins (RepA, λP). The best substrate for either the DnaK or DnaJ chaperone is the native P1 coded replication RepA protein. The native σ32 transcription factor binds more efficiently to DnaJ than to DnaK, whereas unfolded α-carboxymethylated lactalbumin or native λP binds more efficiently to DnaK than to the DnaJ molecular chaperone. The presence of nucleotides does not change the DnaJ affinity to any of the tested protein substrates. In the case of DnaK, the presence of ATP inhibits, while a nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues markedly stimulates the binding of DnaK to all of these various protein substrates. ADP has no effect on these reactions. In contrast to substrate protein binding, DnaK binds to the DnaJ chaperone protein in a radically different manner, namely ATP stimulates whereas a nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue inhibits the DnaK-DnaJ complex formation. Moreover, the DnaKc94 mutant protein lacking 94 amino acids from its C-terminal domain, which still possesses the ATPase activity and forms a transient complex with protein substrates, does not interact with DnaJ protein. We conclude that the DnaK-ADP form, derived from ATP hydrolysis, possesses low affinity to the protein substrates but can efficiently interact with DnaJ molecular chaperone.

The binding and hydrolysis of ATP results in conformational changes to the various Hsp70 family members (25Liberek K. Skowyra D. Zylicz M. Johnson C. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14491-14496Google Scholar; 32Palleros D.R. Reid K.L. McCarty J.S. Walker G.C. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5279-5285Google Scholar; 1Banecki B. Zylicz M. Bertoli E. Tanfani F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25051-25058Google Scholar). Recently it was suggested (under conditions where DnaJ was not present) that the binding, but not ATP hydrolysis, is required for the disassociation of Hsp70 from its substrate (33Palleros D.R. Reid K.L. Shi L. Welch W.J. Fink A.L. Nature. 1993; 365: 664-666Google Scholar; 42Schmid D. Baici A. Gehring H. Christen P. Science. 1994; 263: 971-973Google Scholar). Most models addressing the question of how Hsp70 functions in protein transport or folding assume that Hsp70 bound to ADP (Hsp70-ADP) is the form exhibiting the highest affinity toward the substrate and ATP hydrolysis is required only for the regeneration of such a form (for review, see Craig et al.(1994)). This conclusion was based on the findings that Hsp70 family members form a stable complex with various substrates in the presence of ADP but not ATP (31Palleros D.R. Welch W.J. Fink A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5719-5723Google Scholar). However, recently stopped-flow measurements have revealed that the DnaK chaperone exhibits a faster on rate for peptides when bound to ATP than ADP, but it exhibits an even faster off rate when bound to ATP. Thus, overall the DnaK-substrate complex is less stable in the presence of ATP than ADP (Schmid et al., 1994). In this paper we show that the product of ATP hydrolysis, namely the DnaK-ADP form possesses limited affinity to the protein substrates but binds efficiently to the DnaJ protein.

In control experiments we showed that 0.5 μg of protein per well is enough to allow saturation of the amount protein bound to the well. After a 1-h incubation at room temperature, the solution was removed and the wells were washed 4 times with PBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (PBS/BSA, 100 μl). The first three washes were immediate, whereas the last wash solution was incubated for 1 h before removal. The wells were then washed with buffer A (25 mM Hepes/KOH, pH 7.6, 150 mM KCl, 25 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 5%(v/v) glycerol, and 0.05% Triton X-100) supplemented with 0.2% BSA (buffer A/BSA) and the indicated protein(s) were added in 50-μl aliquots in buffer A/BSA. The reaction mixture was supplemented with nucleotides as indicated (1 mM), and the volume of the reaction was adjusted to 60 μl. The 0.05% Triton X-100 was present during binding assay to prevent self-aggregation of DnaK and DnaJ chaperones. After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, glutaraldehyde was added to a final concentration of 0.1% and incubation was allowed to proceed for an additional 5 min at room temperature. Presented in this paper the experiments were repeated without cross-linking with glutaraldehyde and the same essential results were obtained. The wells were then washed with buffer A/BSA followed by three washes of PBS/BSA. The appropriate antibody was then added (1/20,000 dilution for anti-DnaK serum, 1/10,000 dilution for anti-DnaJ serum) in buffer A/BSA (100 μl) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Unbound protein was removed and the wells were washed 4 times with PBS/BSA. Following this, the secondary antibody was added in PBS/BSA (100 μl) and incubated for 45 min. Following protein removal and four washes as above, colorimetric detection was done with the Bio-Rad TMB peroxidase EIA substrate kit. The reaction was stopped with an equal volume (100 μl) of 4 N sulfuric acid. Absorbance (490 nm) was measured with a Molecular Devices TermoMax microplate reader. Each experiment was repeated 6 times and the average value was estimated. In most cases the standard deviation was less than 5%. Chaperone proteins, along with the appropriate substrates at the concentrations indicated in the various figure legends (50-μl reaction mixture) were incubated for 30 min at 30°C in buffer B (same as buffer A except no Triton X-100 was used). The mixture was then injected onto a size exclusion chromatography Superdex 200 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) column equilibrated with buffer B. Where stated in the figure legends, either the buffer in the reaction mixture or during equilibration, the column may also have contained 200 μM of the appropriate nucleotide. Chromatography was carried out at a flow rate 0.3 ml/min at room temperature using a Gold HPLC system (Beckman) equipped with a diode array detector. The affinity of DnaK for various protein substrates was tested using two techniques, a sensitive ELISA and size exclusion HPLC. As model substrates, we decided to use four native protein substrates namely λO, λP, RepA, and σ32, all four known previously to interact with chaperone proteins both in vivo and in vitro (for a review, see Georgopoulos et al.(1994)). All four of these proteins were in their native state and biochemically active in an in vitro λ or P1 DNA replication assay (in the case of λO, λP, and RepA) and a transcription assay (in the case of σ32) as described previously (Zylicz et al., 1989; Wickner et al., 1992; Liberek et al., 1992). In addition to these native proteins, an unfolded protein in the extended configuration was chosen, CMLA. CMLA is thought to mimic a nascent polypeptide substrate emerging from a ribosome or traversing a biological membrane (21Langer T. Lu C. Echols H. Flanagan J. Hayer M.K. Hartl F.-U. Nature. 1992; 356: 683-689Google Scholar; Palleros et al., 1993; 9Cyr D.M. Lu X. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20927-20931Google Scholar, 10Cyr D.M. Langer T. Douglas M.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 176-181Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, DnaK exhibits the highest affinity to λO, λP, and RepA. It was previously reported that both λO and λP interact with DnaK (Liberek et al., 1990). A DnaK-RepA complex in the absence of DnaJ was not previously detected by others (Wickner et al., 1992). The CMLA and σ32 proteins bind less efficiently to the DnaK chaperone (Fig. 1A). Theoretically it is possible that the conformation of the substrate bound to the ELISA plate is different from the conformation of the substrate in the solution. Also the mode of binding to the plates could be different among different proteins, affecting the sites available for interaction with chaperones. To eliminate these possibilities we bound CMLA (the similar result was obtained with λP; result not shown) to the ELISA plate and measured the affinity of DnaK preincubated with various concentrations of λP, λO, RepA, or CMLA. It means that all these protein substrates were incubated with DnaK under their optimal activity conditions. As shown in Fig. 1B, again λO, λP, and RepA compete more efficiently with CMLA for binding to DnaK. Both bound to the ELISA plate and when free in a solution, σ32 has been shown to have a low affinity to DnaK chaperone. This is consistent with our previous findings where the binding of σ32 to DnaK was monitored using the glycerol gradient centrifugation (Liberek et al., 1992). Moreover, the experiment in which σ32 bound to the ELISA plate specifically interacts with the core of RNA polymerase and σ70 competes for this binding, additionally confirms that the conformation of the protein on the plate and in the solution is at least similar. The λP protein bound to the ELISA plate specifically interacts with the DnaB helicase and λO bound to the ELISA plate is efficiently recognized by the ClpX chaperone (Wawrzynow et al., 1995a). 3A. Wawrzynów and M. Zylicz, unpublished results. As described in this paper, the ELISA for protein-protein interaction is also sensitive to the tertiary structure of some substrates. The heat inactivated luciferase bound to the ELISA plate is more efficiently recognized by ClpX or DnaK chaperones than the native form of luciferase (Wawrzynow et al., 1995a). 4D. Wall, unpublished results. In control experiments we also tested the influence of reducing conditions on the affinity of DnaK to bind to CMLA. When CMLA (327 mM stock solution in 10 mM HCl, pH 2) was diluted in a binding buffer containing 5 or 10 mM dithiothreitol, DnaK exhibited only a slightly higher (5-10%) affinity toward CMLA than when only 2 mM dithiothreitol was present in the binding buffer (Fig. 1A). Previously we had shown that DnaK possesses a weak ATPase activity resulting in the hydrolysis of 1 molecule of ATP every 10 min (Zylicz et al., 1983; 24Liberek K. Marszalek J. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2874-2878Google Scholar). In addition, it was shown that ATP causes the release of DnaK from λP, λO, unfolded bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, and RepA, albeit inefficiently (Fig. 2) (Liberek et al., 1990, 1991b). In the case of σ32 and CMLA, which possess a lower (without nucleotides) affinity toward DnaK, the ATP-dependent dissociation of DnaK from these substrates was more pronounced (Fig. 2). These results suggest that the presence of ATP simply shifts the equilibrium of the DnaK/substrate reaction in favor of dissociation. Under these conditions, ADP has only a modest effect on the binding of DnaK to some of its protein substrates (Fig. 2). Surprisingly, the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue (AMP-PCP) efficiently stimulates the binding of all protein substrates to DnaK (Fig. 2). The stimulatory effect of AMP-PCP was even more pronounced for the σ32 and CMLA substrates (Fig. 2). In fact, in the presence of AMP-PCP, DnaK exhibits a similar binding property for all tested protein substrates (Fig. 2). Recently, Palleros et al.(1993) reported that the ATPγS nonhydrolyzable analogue causes the partial release of CMLA from its complex with DnaK. To address this apparent discrepancy we tested two other nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues for their effect on substrate binding to DnaK. All three ATP analogues tested, namely, AMP-PCP, AMP-PNP, and ATPγS, stimulated binding of DnaK to λP or CMLA to the same extend (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, because during the course of these experiments we found that ATPγS was unstable we decided to exclusively use AMP-PCP. Next, we examined the influence of nucleotides on the stability of the DnaK-substrate complexes. DnaK was preincubated with λP or CMLA in the presence of AMP-PCP for 30 min at room temperature (similar results were obtained when no nucleotides were used), then AMP-PCP and unbound protein were removed. Following this, fresh buffer with the indicated nucleotides were added and the reaction was stopped at various times by cross-linking with glutaraldehyde. The DnaK-λP or DnaK-CMLA complexes were relatively stable in the absence of nucleotides or in the presence of ADP but in the presence of ATP nearly all DnaK bound to either CMLA or λP was released within 5 min (results not shown). To further substantiate our results obtained from the ELISA experiments, we also performed size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex HR 200 column (Pharmacia). When λP was incubated with DnaK (2:1 molar ratio, respectively) a peak was detected which corresponds with a dimer of λP bound to a monomer of DnaK (Fig. 4). This protein complex was previously identified by us (30Osipiuk J. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4821-4827Google Scholar). The presence of ATP in the premixture did not disrupt the DnaK-λP complex (results not shown). However, when ATP was present both in the premixture and in the column buffer, the DnaK-λP complex was disrupted (Fig. 4). This result suggests that when ATP is not present in the column buffer, the λP-DnaK complex reforms due to the high affinity of DnaK to λP. In contrast to λP, the presence of ATP in the premixture only was sufficient to disrupt the DnaK-CMLA complex (Fig. 4), again suggesting that DnaK forms a weaker complex with CMLA than λP (Fig. 1A). The presence of ADP had no detectable effect on the DnaK-λP or DnaK-CMLA complexes (Fig. 4). In good agreement with the reported ELISA-type of experiments (Fig. 2) is the observation that the presence of AMP-PCP in the premixture stimulates binding of DnaK to λP (Fig. 4). An even more pronounced stimulatory effect of AMP-PCP was found for the CMLA protein substrate than for λP (Fig. 4). Interestingly, when AMP-PCP or ATPγS were also present in the column buffer, a lower amount of CMLA was found in a complex with DnaK, suggesting that nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues could also destabilize the DnaK-CMLA complex (Palleros et al., 1993).3 The affinity of DnaJ for the λO, RepA, λP, σ32, and CMLA proteins was again monitored using the described ELISA. The DnaJ has the highest affinity for RepA and σ32 substrates (Fig. 1, C and D). There were no detectable differences in the binding affinities when ATP, ADP, or AMP-PCP were used (results not shown), suggesting that nucleotides do not modulate the binding properties of DnaJ. To verify these protein interactions using another method, we again performed size exclusion HPLC. Using this assay, we could only detect a complex between DnaJ and RepA (50Wawrzynow A. Banecki B. Wall D. Liberek K. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19307-19311Google Scholar) and DnaJ-σ32. 5K. Liberek, unpublished results. Complexes between DnaJ and λO, λP, or CMLA were not detectable by this method (Wawrzynow et al., 1995b; results not shown), suggesting that the weak interactions detected with the ELISA were probably transient in nature, and therefore those DnaJ-substrate complexes were possible to capture only through cross-linking with glutaraldehyde. Recently we have shown that DnaJ and GrpE jointly stimulate DnaK's ATPase activity up to 50-fold, while the DnaJ alone stimulates this reaction only up to 2-3-fold (Liberek et al., 1991a). This findings suggest that DnaJ and DnaK physically interact. Using the ELISA we tested the influence of the various nucleotides on the interaction between DnaK and DnaJ. Interestingly, these nucleotides were found to influence the DnaK-DnaJ interactions in an opposite manner as compared to that of the DnaK-substrate interactions (compare Fig. 2and Fig. 5). Specifically, ATP dramatically increased DnaK's affinity toward DnaJ, while AMP-PCP weakened this interaction (Fig. 5). We also found that ADP slightly stimulated the binding of DnaK to DnaJ, compared to the situation when no nucleotide was present.3 Therefore, we conclude that the nature of the interaction between DnaK and DnaJ is fundamentally different than that of the DnaK-substrate interaction. Moreover, the binding of DnaK to DnaJ is specific, since a single amino acid substitution in DnaJ, His33-Gln (DnaJ259) practically eliminates the DnaJ-DnaK interaction, but not the DnaJ-substrate interaction (48Wall D. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2139-2144Google Scholar). To support the specificity of the DnaJ-DnaK complex formation we tested the interaction of DnaJ with DnaK mutant lacking 94 amino acids from its C-terminal domain. No detectable interaction between DnaJ and DnaKc94 was observed (Fig. 5). To verify the results obtained with ELISA we performed size exclusion HPLC. Under the described conditions the DnaK protein eluted as an asymmetric monomer (Montgomery et al., 1993).3 The DnaJ protein behaved as a dimer, as described previously (Zylicz et al., 1985). When both proteins were mixed together, in the absence of ATP, their elution profiles were unchanged, i.e. there was no detectable interaction (Fig. 6). When ATP was added during the preincubation there was no noticeable interaction (Fig. 6). However, when ATP was present in both the premixture and in the column buffer, we did observe an additional peak, suggesting that the DnaK and DnaJ proteins interact in an ATP-dependent manner. To confirm this interpretation we separated the fractions from the HPLC sizing column by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and verified that only in the presence of ATP in both the premixture and column buffer did the DnaK and DnaJ proteins co-elute in these fractions (results not shown). The estimation of the apparent molecular weight of this putative DnaJ-DnaK complex suggests that it is slightly smaller than a dimer of DnaK. Thus, we conclude that a DnaJ dimer (or monomer) interacts with a DnaK monomer (Fig. 6). The substitution of ATP by ADP (or AMP-PCP) in the column buffer did not lead to the formation of a DnaK-DnaJ complex (result not shown), suggesting that the DnaK-ADP form derived from ATP hydrolysis is required for a stable DnaK-DnaJ interaction. It was previously suggested that Hsp70 and DnaJ-like proteins (Hsp40) exhibit different substrate specificity (for review, see Cyr et al.(1994)). It is generally assumed that the Hsp70 class of protein binds to unfolded proteins, recognizing short polypeptides that are in an extended configuration. By contrast, it is believed that DnaJ-like proteins bind protein substrates in the “molten globule” state exhibiting secondary and some tertiary structures. While the binding of Hsp70 to different stretched polypeptides was carefully examined (Flynn et al., 1991; 3Blond-Elguindi S. Cwirla S.E. Dower W.J. Lipshutz R.J. Sprang S.R. Sambrook J.K. Gething M.-J. Cell. 1993; 75: 717-728Google Scholar; Gragerov et al., 1994), no corresponding systematic study of binding of Hsp70 to a native protein substrate nor that of the DnaJ chaperone to native proteins or peptide substrates was done. In this paper we used four, native substrates, λO, λP, σ32, and RepA, as well as a permanently unfolded polypeptide which lacks secondary structure and cannot fold, CMLA, to compare the ability of these substrates to form a complex with the DnaK or DnaJ molecular chaperones. We found that the DnaK protein, previously assumed to preferentially recognize unfolded peptides in the extended configuration, binds much better to native RepA then denatured CMLA (or heat inactivated luciferase).4 Perhaps these seemingly conflicting observations with DnaK can be explained if one assumes that the RepA native protein exhibits (transiently?) a polypeptide loop(s) on the surface in the stretched configuration. On the other hand, DnaJ chaperone, previously supposed to recognize protein substrates with secondary and tertiary structure, indeed recognizes efficiently the native σ32 and RepA proteins but binds with very low affinity to either the native λO, λP proteins, or to the denatured CMLA. Perhaps σ32 and RepA exhibit such a protein structure on their surface that DnaJ likes to bind to. What amino acid sequence or tertiary structure is recognized by DnaJ protein remains still unknown. In previously published studies it was assumed that ADP, ATP, and ATPγS all bind to Hsp70 with comparable affinities, in the micromolar range (Palleros et al., 1991, 1993) This belief was recently challenged by other laboratories (Prasad et al., 1994; Montgomery et al., 1993). Taking into account the recently published data for the affinity of DnaK to ATP (Kd35 nM) and to ADP (Kd 200 nM) (Montgomery et al., 1993) most of DnaK (under physiological concentrations of these two nucleotides) would be in the nucleotide bound form. In the absence of the DnaJ protein, the DnaK in the presence of ATP possesses the highest affinity toward a substrate (high on rate), but exhibits an even higher off rate, as shown by using the stopped-flow technique (Schmid et al., 1994). In this paper we show that the presence of nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues can “trap” DnaK in a conformation that promotes efficient DnaK-substrate complex formation. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that for some protein substrates, binding to DnaK will also accelerate the ATP hydrolysis step and/or nucleotide exchange. Such a possibility was previously suggested for the eukaryotic Hsc70 by Hightower et al.(1994). It is also possible that in some cases, the binding of substrate to DnaK, which may induce conformational changes in the chaperone (35Park K. Flynn G.C. Rothman J.E. Fasman G.D. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 325-330Google Scholar), will also trigger the release of ATP or ADP from the DnaK chaperone. Contrary to the previously published data (Palleros et al., 1991, 34Palleros D.R. Shi L. Reid K.L. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13107-13114Google Scholar) we show in this paper that the presence of ADP in the premixture does not substantially accelerate the binding of DnaK to its protein substrate. Moreover, the hydrolyzable ATP leads to the dissociation of DnaK from substrate complex, as it was shown previously (Liberek et al., 1991b). We conclude that the DnaK-ADP form which is created after ATP hydrolysis possesses limited affinity to the protein substrates. As it will be discussed in the accompanying paper (Wawrzynów et al., 1995b), in order to stabilize DnaK-substrate complex, DnaK protein needs to be in the active conformation which can occur in the presence of DnaJ and ATP hydrolysis. We previously showed that the presence of DnaJ accelerates (even without GrpE) the hydrolysis of ATP bound to DnaK (Liberek et al., 1991a; 46Szabo A. Langer T. Schroder H. Flanagan J. Bukau B. Hartl F.-U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10345-10349Google Scholar). In this paper we show that in the presence of hydrolyzable ATP it is possible to isolate DnaK-DnaJ complex. The presence of nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue, which promotes efficient binding of DnaK to its various protein substrates, does not stimulate DnaK-DnaJ complex formation. Our results suggest that DnaJ protein binds to the DnaK-ADP form only when this form is a product of DnaK-dependent ATP hydrolysis. In summary, in this paper we show that the DnaK-ADP form possesses low affinity to the substrates but high affinity to the DnaJ protein. These results suggest that the mechanisms of DnaK binding to DnaJ and DnaK binding to substrate are fundamentally different. It is also possible that the DnaK protein domains which are involved in the interaction with a substrate and DnaJ are different. In preliminary experiments we have shown that a DnaK mutant variant, lacking 94 amino acids from its C-terminal domain (DnaKc94) does not interact stably with the DnaJ protein, but does form a functional (but unstable) complex with the λP protein (this paper). 6A. Maddock, A. Wawrzynow, B. Banecki, D. Wall, C. Georgopoulos, and M. Zylicz, unpublished results. These results suggest that DnaJ may interact stably with DnaK through DnaK's C-terminal domain. Such a possibility was previously suggested by 47Tsai M.-Y. Wang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5958-5962Google Scholar. However, more experiments are needed to verify this hypothesis. For example, it is still possible that the truncation of the C-terminal domain of the DnaK protein induces a conformational change of the N-terminal domain of DnaK protein, thus preventing formation of the DnaJ-DnaKc94 complex."
https://openalex.org/W2080040173,"We have previously shown that the membrane domain of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase from hamster contains all of the sequences required for both localization to the endoplasmic reticulum and regulated degradation of the enzyme.

When cells are starved for mevalonate-derived metabolites, the amount of HMG-CoA reductase is elevated about 200-fold over the basal level. This is achieved by a combination of enhanced transcription of the gene, enhanced translation of the mRNA, and reduced degradation of the enzyme(1Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4442) Google Scholar). The increase in enzyme levels can be reversed within a few hours by adding mevalonate or sterols to the culture medium(1Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4442) Google Scholar). Much attention has been focused on elucidating the mechanisms of these regulated processes, including efforts to understand the degradation process by which levels of HMG-CoA reductase are regulated in response to the concentration of products in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A Chinese hamster ovary endoplasmic reticulum acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-β-galactoside a fusion protein consisting of the membrane domain and most of the linker domain of Syrian hamster HMG-CoA reductase fused to Escherichia coli β-galactosidase minimum essential medium phosphate-buffered saline. 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A Chinese hamster ovary endoplasmic reticulum acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-β-galactoside a fusion protein consisting of the membrane domain and most of the linker domain of Syrian hamster HMG-CoA reductase fused to Escherichia coli β-galactosidase minimum essential medium phosphate-buffered saline. Mammalian HMG-CoA reductase is an integral membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The structure of HMG-CoA reductase can be divided into two domains. The C-terminal two-thirds of the polypeptide chain extends into cytosol of the cell and contains the catalytic activity. The N-terminal one-third of the polypeptide chain, not required for catalytic activity, contains alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic segments that traverse the ER membrane eight times(2Olender E.H. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4223-4233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the sequences encoding the membrane domain are deleted from a cDNA, and the resulting shortened cDNA expressed in the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, the truncated reductase, which is catalytically active, is found in the cytosol and is no longer subject to regulated degradation in the presence of mevalonate and sterols(3Gil G. Faust J.R. Chin D.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1985; 41: 249-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Deletion of two membrane-spanning sequences in the middle of the membrane domain abolishes sterol- and nonsterol-accelerated turnover of the enzyme as well(4Jingami H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G.W. Luskey K.L. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1693-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In another case, HMGal, a mutant form of hamster HMG-CoA reductase, in which the entire catalytic domain is replaced with E. coli β-galactosidase, still displays rapid degradation in response to the regulatory molecules, mevalonate, and sterols(5Skalnik D.G. Narita H. Kent C. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6836-6841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations demonstrate that the membrane domain of reductase contains all of the information required for not only ER localization but also regulated degradation of the enzyme.

Knowledge of the amino acid sequence of several HMG-CoA reductases has substantially aided the investigation of the structural basis for the regulated degradation. It has been reported that the activity and mRNA level of HMG-CoA reductase from sea urchin embryos cultured in the presence of mevalonate or sterols were unchanged as compared to control embryos (12Woodward H.D.

This observation led us to investigate the possibility that sea urchin enzyme is not subject to regulation, including protein turnover. Interestingly, the sea urchin enzyme shares 62% amino acid sequence identity and 75% similarity with the hamster enzyme in the membrane domain and shares similar predicted topological features (Fig. 1). Therefore, sea urchin HMG-CoA reductase serves as a natural source of mutations for study of the membrane domain of the hamster enzyme. In current studies we have compared the degradation phenotypes of the sea urchin HMG-CoA reductase and the hamster HMG-CoA reductase both expressed in CHO cells, to elucidate further the role of the membrane domain in enzyme degradation in response to physiological regulators. To accomplish this, we constructed sea urchin HMGal (uHMGal) the structural equivalent of hamster HMGal (hHMGal), which has the sea urchin HMG-CoA reductase membrane domain connected to E. coli β-galactosidase. This uHMGal was stably expressed in CHO cells, and we measured half-lives in the absence or presence of sterols. We found that the degradation of uHMGal is not accelerated by sterols, and even in the absence of sterols, it is less stable than hHMGal. We also constructed chimeric hamster/sea urchin HMGal mutants to investigate which amino acid sequences from the hamster enzyme are sufficient to confer sterol-regulated degradation to the sea urchin enzyme. Our results identify the second membrane-spanning domain of hamster enzyme as important for the regulated degradation of HMG-CoA reductase.

Arbogust L.Y. Oullette L. Howard B.V. In Vitro. 1976; 12: 554-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In this study cells were grown for 24 h in medium supplemented with 5% lipid poor serum, 1 μM compactin, and 0.1 mM mevalonate before the experiments. This pretreatment was sufficient to maximize β-galactosidase activity of HMGal and increase the protein amounts of HMGal and HMG-CoA reductase about 4-5-fold(19Chun K.T. Bar-Nun S. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22004-22010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was measured as described previously(5Skalnik D.G. Narita H. Kent C. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6836-6841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al.(20Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specific activity was expressed as OD420 nm/(h × mg of protein). The half-lives of HMGal and each chimeric HMGal mutant were measured as described previously(19Chun K.T. Bar-Nun S. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22004-22010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The construction of the chimeric HMGal mutants is listed in Table1. For construction of those mutants, single-stranded DNAs were prepared from pEMBL9 (21Dente L. Cesareni G. Cortese R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1645-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar) containing the cDNAs of either truncated hamster or sea urchin HMG-CoA reductase and used for oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (Amersham Corp.). For each chimeric mutant, oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed to create novel restriction endonuclease sites, which were utilized for the initial screening of mutant cDNAs, in the gene near the regions which encode the putative ends of a membrane-spanning domain of HMG-CoA reductase gene. To avoid extra mutations except the protein sequences from sea urchin enzyme, the unique restriction endonuclease sites were carefully designed by using silent mutations in the hHMGal. The identity of each mutant was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing of single- and double-stranded DNA with Sequenase®174; (United States Biochemicals Corp). After substitution of cDNA fragments encoding putative membrane-spanning domains between hamster and sea urchin enzymes, those chimeric hamster/sea urchin HMGal cDNAs were subcloned into the expression vector pcDLSRα-296 (22Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J.-I. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K.-I. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for expression studies as described(5Skalnik D.G. Narita H. Kent C. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6836-6841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Chun K.T. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4236-4246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding the fusion genes were co-transfected along with pSV2neo (24Southern J.P. Berg P. J. Mol. Appl. Gen. 1982; 1: 327-341PubMed Google Scholar) into CHO cells. Transfection was conducted by Lipofectin®174; reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. 10 μg of pcDL-SRα296 containing the cDNA of different HMGal species and 0.5 μg of pSV2neo were co-transfected into subconfluent monolayers of CHO cells. Transfectants were selected with 0.5-0.75 mg/ml of active G418, and resistant colonies with the highest β-galactosidase activity were isolated using the replica plating procedure as described below. These selected cells were maintained in MEM supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and 0.25 mg/ml active G418. Although we attempted to optimize the transfection conditions, the resulting populations of transfected cells usually did not express sufficient fusion proteins to characterize the phenotype. We therefore had to isolate clones with elevated expression. We used a replica plate procedure that allowed us to screen for the cells whose β-galactosidase activity is high and, at the same time, preserve a “replica” of those colonies. G418-resistant colonies were screened for highest β-galactosidase activity by using the replica plating procedure described by Esko and Raetz (25Esko J.D. Raetz C.R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, 150-200 colonies/100 × 15-mm tissue culture dish were overlaid with a polyester-PeCap HD7-17 filter membrane, a paper filter, and a layer of glass beads. The cells were allowed to grow through the filter membrane for 7-10 days before they were screened for β-galactosidase activity. The filter was carefully removed from the master dish and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) briefly. The medium in the master dish was replaced with fresh medium, and the cells were maintained by further incubation at 37°C. The filter was overlaid on a paper filter (Whatman, no. 42) previously soaked with PBS containing X-Gal (1 mg/ml), which is a membrane-permeable substrate for β-galactosidase, and incubated for several hours at 37°C. After staining with X-Gal, blue colonies were isolated from the master dish. Woodward et al. (12Woodward H.D. Allen J.M. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18411-18418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that sea urchin HMG-CoA reductase activity was expressed during embryonic development, and its levels were not influenced by mevalonate and sterols, unlike mammalian HMG-CoA reductase, suggesting that the sea urchin HMG-CoA reductase is not subject to regulated degradation in sea urchin embryos. To determine if sea urchin HMG-CoA reductase is subject to regulated degradation, we examined the phenotype of uHMGal expressed in a heterologous system, CHO cells, and compared the results to those obtained with hHMGal. Steady-state levels of hHMGal and uHMGal were determined by measuring β-galactosidase activity. For each cell line expressing either hHMGal or uHMGal, the β-galactosidase-specific activity was measured in cells growing in the presence of 2.5 μM 25-hydroxycholesterol and compared to the activity measured in untreated cells. The difference between the amount of activity in treated and untreated cells mirrors the difference between the half-lives of the fusion protein under the different conditions(19Chun K.T. Bar-Nun S. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22004-22010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 2A, the β-galactosidase activity of hHMGal was reduced to about 30-40% of control levels upon treatment with 25-hydroxycholesterol. In contrast, steady-state levels of the uHMGal were insensitive to 25-hydroxycholesterol treatment, suggesting that the sea urchin enzyme is not subject to regulated degradation. Using a pulse-chase protocol, we determined the half-lives of these two fusion proteins to confirm that the half-life of uHMGal is not regulated by 25-hydroxycholesterol. As shown in Fig. 2B, with the hHMGal, 25-hydroxycholesterol accelerates the degradation of the hHMGal protein, reducing the half-life from about 4.6 to 2.0 h. 25-Hydroxycholesterol did not reduce the half-life of uHMGal, which is shorter than the half-life of hHMGal. These results reveal that the sea urchin HMG-CoA reductase is not subject to regulated degradation, when expressed in the CHO cells. Since the degradation of uHMGal is relatively rapid, we wanted to determine that it was being degraded by the normal cellular machinery responsible for regulated degradation of the hamster protein or whether the protein was degraded by a non-physiological mechanism. We have previously shown that ALLN, a cysteine protease inhibitor, strongly blocks both the basal and the accelerated degradation of hamster HMG-CoA reductase and hHMGal(26Inoue S. Bar-Nun S. Roitelman J. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13311-13317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells expressing uHMGal were subjected to pulse-chase analysis without or with 2.5 μM 25-hydroxycholesterol in the absence or presence of 0.2 mM ALLN. As can be seen in Fig. 3, in both cases, with or without 25-hydroxycholesterol, ALLN blocked uHMGal turnover. These results are comparable to those obtained previously with hHMGal(26Inoue S. Bar-Nun S. Roitelman J. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13311-13317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to determine the localization of uHMGal, we stained the CHO cells expressing the uHMGal with X-Gal as a substrate as described previously(23Chun K.T. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4236-4246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The in situ β-galactosidase activity staining pattern of uHMGal is the same as that of hHMGal (data not shown), indicating that the uHMGal is properly localized to the ER. Since the uHMGal is structurally quite similar to hHMGal, localized correctly and the degradation is sensitive to ALLN, it is likely that the same cellular components are responsible for the degradation of both the hHMGal and uHMGal in the CHO cells. It is somewhat surprising that the degradation of uHMGal is not regulated because, based on the amino acid sequence comparison, the membrane domain of sea urchin HMG-CoA reductase shares 62% amino acid sequence identity and 75% similarity with that of hamster reductase. The sea urchin HMG-CoA reductase can thus serve as a natural source of mutations for studying the membrane domain of the hamster enzyme. Using an approach where a specific domain of one protein is replaced with the homologous domain of another protein, we constructed chimeric hamster/sea urchin HMGal mutants to study which regions are essential for regulated degradation. We have previously shown using chimeras of hHMGal and bacteriorhodopsin that certain subregions of the hamster HMG-CoA reductase membrane domain are necessary for regulated degradation. This work suggested that the C-terminal half of the membrane domain which includes the region of membrane spans 5 through 8 (numbering is from the N terminus) plays a prominent role in regulated degradation based on membrane span replacement studies. When the fifth or sixth membrane spans is substituted with the first membrane span of bacteriorhodopsin, the mutant forms of the HMGal lost both sterol- and non-sterol-accelerated degradation. When the seventh and eighth membrane spans were replaced, HMGal stability is dramatically changed(23Chun K.T. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4236-4246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results, however, represent the consequences of gross changes in the structure of HMG-CoA reductase. In order to more finely determine what primary structures within the hamster HMG-CoA reductase are critical in conferring the regulated phenotype, we first constructed two chimeric HMGal mutants in which each half of the membrane domain from hamster enzyme was swapped with the homologous domain from sea urchin enzyme. The amino acid sequence comparison shows that the C-terminal half of the membrane domain (amino acid residues 161-338) of the sea urchin enzyme, containing membrane spans 5 through 8, shares significantly less homology with the C-terminal half of hamster HMG-CoA reductase (Fig. 1). We have designated the hamster/sea urchin chimera 5-8 uHMGal as a mutant in which membrane spans 1 through 4 of the hamster enzyme were fused to membrane spans 5 through 8 of the sea urchin membrane domain (Table1). In 1-4 uHMGal the opposite construct of the 5-8 uHMGal membrane spans 1 through 4 are from sea urchin enzyme while 5 through 8 are from hamster enzyme. The effects of 25-hydroxycholesterol on the steady-state levels of β-galactosidase activities are shown in Fig. 4. In the chimeric mutant 5-8 uHMGal, β-galactosidase activity was reduced by 25-hydroxycholesterol to similar levels as observed with hHMGal. Half-lives of the 5-8 uHMGal were also determined either in the absence or presence of 25-hydroxycholesterol (Table2). The basal half-life was about 5.2 h which is similar to that of hHMGal. When cells were incubated with 25-hydroxycholesterol, the half-life was reduced to about 3.5 h. This 30% reduction of the half-life can approximately explain the loss of β-galactosidase activity observed in steady state experiments. On the other hand, the steady-state β-galactosidase activity of 1-4 uHMGal was quite reproducibly increased to about 140% by the addition of 25-hydroxycholesterol rather than decreased. When the half-life of 1-4 uHMGal was determined it was found to be about 0.42 h which is extremely short. We did not observe acceleration of the degradation in the presence of 25-hydroxycholesterol (Table2). This phenotype is similar to that of the uHMGal, but it is important to note that the half-life of uHMGal has the potential to be accelerated since 1-4 uHMGal has a substantially shorter half-life. Together, these results indicate that the N-terminal half of the membrane domain of the hamster HMG-CoA reductase can confer regulation to the sea urchin enzyme. Amino acid differences in the N-terminal half of the membrane domain of the sea urchin enzyme appear to be responsible both for the lability of the enzyme and the lack of regulation. Having shown that membrane spans 1 through 4 of the hamster enzyme confer regulated degradation onto the unregulated sea urchin enzyme, we attempted to further define the critical regions by constructing additional chimeras and characterizing their degradation phenotypes (Fig. 5). In the first group of chimeric mutants, where the first two membrane-spanning domains of sea urchin enzyme were replaced with the corresponding regions of the hamster enzyme (3-8 uHMGal), steady-state β-galactosidase activity was decreased by 25-hydroxycholesterol, similar to the decrease in hHMGal activity by 25-hydroxycholesterol. However, the replacement of the first membrane-spanning domain (2-8 uHMGal) was not sufficient to confer the regulated phenotype to the sea urchin enzyme based on the steady-state measurements. These results indicated that the sequences responsible for the regulated phenotype are located within membrane spans 1 and 2 and probably in membrane span 2. To determine whether the critical sequences for the regulatory response are located solely in membrane span 2 or in both membrane spans 1 and 2, we also created a chimeric mutant, 1,3-8 uHMGal, in which only the second membrane-spanning domain of the sea urchin enzyme was replaced by the corresponding region of the hamster enzyme. β-Galactosidase activity of 1,3-8 uHMGal, like that of the hamster enzyme, was decreased to about 50% by 25-hydroxycholesterol, suggesting that the second membrane-spanning domain alone is sufficient to confer the regulated phenotype onto the non-regulated sea urchin enzyme. Phenotypes of the next group of chimeric mutants support the results described above. In the second group of mutants, which were reciprocal constructs complementary to the first group of mutants, portions of the sea urchin membrane domain were substituted into the hamster enzyme to determine whether sequences from the sea urchin enzyme could abolish the regulated phenotype of hHMGal. As shown in Fig. 6, substituting the first membrane-spanning domain of the hamster enzyme with that from the sea urchin enzyme (1 uHMGal) did not affect the regulated phenotype. However, when both membrane spans 1 and 2 (1-2 uHMGal), or membrane span 2 (2 uHMGal) from the sea urchin enzyme, were introduced into the hamster HMGal 25-hydroxycholesterol had essentially no effect on steady-state β-galactosidase activity. Half-lives of these chimeric mutant proteins were determined using the pulse-chase protocol. The data are summarized in Table2. As shown in Table 2, half-life data reflect the steady-state phenotype of the chimeric mutants with the exception of 3-8 uHMGal. However, when second membrane-spaning domain of hamster enzyme is introduced into the sea urchin enzyme, its basal degradation rate is about 3.5 h, substantially longer than uHMGal and is accelerated by 25-hydroxysterol. This result reflects the steady-state experiment. Replacing the first membrane-spanning domain did not cause the regulated phenotype of the 2-8 uHMGal mutant. This result is also consistent with the steady-state experiment. Unexpectedly, in the case of 3-8 uHMGal, the basal half-life of the chimeric HMGal was significantly shorter compared to that of hamster enzyme, and its half-life was not accelerated by 25-hydroxycholesterol. These results do not agree with the activity measurements described above. The basal half-life of the mutant is probably too short to be accurately measured using our pulse-chase protocol. For the activity measurements, the 20-h cumulative effect of any difference in half-life may cause the difference in steady-state levels. The degradation rate of the 1 uHMGal mutant, which shows regulated steady-state β-galactosidase activity, is accelerated by 25-hydroxycholesterol reducing its half-life from 2.5 to 1.1 h. This chimeric fusion protein is significantly less stable than the hamster HMGal, but the degradation of this mutant protein and the response of its β-galactosidase activity to 25-hydroxycholestrol are essentially similar to that of the hamster enzyme, suggesting that the mutations within the first membrane-spanning domain do not seem to be critical for the regulated degradation of HMG-CoA reductase. In the case of the 1-2 uHMGal mutant, the basal half-life was quite short, about 1.6 h, and this chimeric mutant lost the regulated degradation by 25-hydroxycholesterol as seen in steady-state β-galactosidase measurements. On the other hand, the membrane span 2 (2 uHMGal mutant) replacement alone which also resulted in a non-regulated mutant form of hHMGal in the steady-state measurements has a relatively longer basal half-life, 7.0 h, compared to that of hamster enzyme, but 25-hydroxycholesterol failed to enhance the rate of degradation in this mutant. These results suggest that the sequences within the first membrane-spanning domain are responsible for lability of the enzyme and that the amino acid differences in membrane span 2 between hamster and sea urchin enzymes are involved in the regulatory response. Together, these results strongly suggest that membrane span 2 of hamster HMG-CoA reductase plays an important role in regulated degradation. The current results show that membrane span 2 of the hamster enzyme is important for regulated degradation. Olender and Simoni (2Olender E.H. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4223-4233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that the first membrane-spanning domain functions as a signal sequence to direct enzyme localization to the ER. Another question that arose was whether the first and second membrane spanning regions alone were sufficient to confer the regulated phenotype to the enzyme. In order to answer this question, we constructed a deletion mutant where the region encoding membrane spans 3 through 8 was deleted. When this mutant protein was expressed in CHO cells it was rapidly degraded, and we could not observe regulated degradation phenotype using either steady-state measurements and pulse-chase experiments (data not shown). These results suggested that the whole multiple membrane-spanning domain is required for regulated degradation and that the degradation system may recognize the tertiary structure of the membrane domain of the enzyme. The ER membrane protein HMG-CoA reductase contains several stretches of hydrophobic residues in its N-terminal domain which topologically are highly conserved between species. The multiple membrane-spanning domain of HMG-CoA reductase has been shown to be both necessary and sufficient to confer sterol- and non-sterol-accelerated degradation upon the enzyme(3Gil G. Faust J.R. Chin D.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1985; 41: 249-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 5Skalnik D.G. Narita H. Kent C. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6836-6841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our focus on studying the role of the hydrophobic membrane domain in regulated degradation is based on the hypothesis that pathway regulatory molecules like sterols, which are themselves hydrophobic, might interact directly with HMG-CoA reductase via the hydrophobic regions of the membrane domain. To test this hypothesis, we have conducted a systematic mutagenesis study of the membrane domain of hamster HMG-CoA reductase in an attempt to localize the subregion(s) within the membrane domain which are required for regulated degradation. In previous studies we have replaced, individually, all eight predicted membrane spans of hamster HMG-CoA reductase with the first membrane span from bacteriorhodopsin(23Chun K.T. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4236-4246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phenotypes of these replacement mutants indicated that several structural components of the membrane domain are required for the regulated degradation of HMG-CoA reductase. These results also indicated that the entire membrane domain of HMG-CoA reductase is not required for the protein's regulated degradation and that it should be possible to identify components of the membrane domain which are necessary for regulated degradation. In order to more precisely define the subregions or residues essential for enhanced degradation in response to regulatory molecules, we first tested which individual subregions were necessary and are sufficient to confer regulation. To accomplish this, we introduced the subregions of interest into a heterologous protein and tested the degradation phenotypes. The choice of a heterologous protein is difficult in the case of a multiple membrane-spanning protein. We chose HMG-CoA reductase from another species, sea urchin, based on reports that the activity of this enzyme is non-responsive to mevalonate and sterols when tested in early sea urchin embryos(12Woodward H.D. Allen J.M. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18411-18418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We examined the membrane domain of sea urchin HMG-CoA reductase using a β-galactosidase fusion protein. When we tested this fusion protein for regulated degradation in transfected CHO cells, the results, shown in Fig. 2, indicated that the degradation of uHMGal is not regulated by exogenous sterols even though uHMGal is properly localized to the ER in this heterologous system. Therefore, we can use the sea urchin enzyme to serve as a source of sequences for identifying subregions from hamster enzyme that confer regulated degradation. To define more precisely the structural features of membrane domain responsible for regulated degradation, we constructed hamster/sea urchin chimeric mutants and tested their phenotypes in CHO cells. When membrane span 2 of hamster and sea urchin enzymes were exchanged, their degradation phenotypes were also exchanged. 2 uHMGal is the mutant where membrane span 2 of the regulated hamster enzyme was replaced with the corresponding region of the non-regulated sea urchin enzyme. The half-life of 2 uHMGal is not accelerated by exogenous sterols, suggesting that membrane span 2 may be involved in sterol signaling. The reciprocal mutant, 1,3-8 uHMGal where membrane span 2 of the hamster enzyme is introduced into the sea urchin enzyme results in a regulated phenotype. These results clearly show that the membrane span 2 of the hamster enzyme is important for the regulated degradation of HMG-CoA reductase. The amino acid sequence in this region shows that membrane span 2 from the sea urchin enzyme has relatively less identity (46%) with that of the hamster enzyme than in other membrane spans, however the membrane span 2 is still highly homologous, with 75% similarity (Fig. 1). One can speculate that sterols accelerate HMG-CoA reductase turnover by a direct interaction with the second membrane-spanning domain. To test this hypothesis, further dissection of the second membrane-spanning domain is required. We are grateful to Kentaro Hanada for helpful advice and discussions during the course of this work. We also thank the members of the Simoni laboratory for critically reviewing this manuscript."

In addition to growth and differentiation activities, one recent study found that NDF/heregulin may function as a paracrine mediator in wound healing and tissue repair in vivo(4Danilenko D.M.

Subsequent cloning and sequencing of NDF and heregulin predicted that the secreted factor was derived from a membrane-bound precursor protein belonging to the EGF family of growth factors(2Wen D.

Until recently, NDF/heregulin was thought to be the direct ligand for HER-2/neu(1Peles E. Bacus S.S. Koski R.A. Lu H.S. Wen D. Ogden S.G. Ben Levy R. Yarden Y.

Science. 1992; 256: 1205-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar); however, several lines of investigation suggested that NDF did not directly stimulate the phosphorylation of HER-2/neu(5Peles E.

It now appears that NDF binds directly to two other members of the EGF receptor family, HER-3 and HER-4, and stimulates phosphorylation of HER-2, HER-3, and HER-4 through the formation of homo- and heterodimeric receptor molecules at the cell surface ((6Plowman G.D.

The HER-2/neu oncogene has been of keen interest to tumor biologists because specific mutations in this receptor tyrosine kinase lead to the development of neuroblastomas and glioblastomas in rats. In humans, it has been shown that amplification and/or overexpression of neu/HER-2 occurs in approximately 25% of breast, ovarian, stomach, pancreatic, and bladder carcinomas. Furthermore, HER-2 overexpression in breast and ovarian cancer is associated with poor prognosis for survival ((12Slamon D.J. Clark G.M. Wong S.G. Levin W.J. Ullrich A.

Less is known about the expression of the newer members of this family in human cancers (HER-3 and HER-4), but studies suggest that these too may be amplified in mammary tumors(16Kraus M.H. Issing W. Miki T. Popescu N.C. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9193-9197Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). The potential role played by the ligand(s) for these receptors, including NDF/heregulin, in normal and malignant cell growth is of great interest and is an area of intense research (for reviews, see (11Carraway III, K.L. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1994; 78: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) and (15Peles E. Yarden Y. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 815-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar)). Two other homologues of NDF have been identified from neuronal sources, one from chicken brain called ARIA (for acetylcholine receptor inducing activity; (17Falls D.L. Rosen K.M. Corfas G. Lane W.S. Fischbach G.D. Cell. 1993; 72: 801-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar)), and one from bovine brain named GGF (for glial growth factor; (18Marchionni M.A. Goodearl A.D.J.

McBurney R.N. Waterfield M.D. Stroobant P. Gwynne D. Nature. 1993; 362: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar)). ARIA was discovered by its ability to induce the synthesis of acetylcholine receptors in muscle. It has subsequently been shown that ARIA also increases the number of sodium channels in muscle (19Corfas G. Fischbach G.D. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 2118-2125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and causes a change in acetylcholine receptor subunit expression from embryonic to adult isoforms(20Martinou J.-C. Falls D.L. Fischbach G.D. Merlie J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7669-7673Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Thus, ARIA may be one of the important factors regulating the architecture of the developing and adult synapse. GGF was identified based on its ability to stimulate the growth of Schwann cells (21Lemke G.E. Brockes J.P. J. Neurosci. 1984; 4: 75-83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Goodearl A.D.J. Davis J.B. Mistry K. Minghetti L. Otsu M. Waterfield M.D. Stroobant P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18095-18102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was recently cloned(18Marchionni M.A. Goodearl A.D.J. Chen M.S. Bermingham-McDonough O. Kirk C. Hendricks M. Danehy F. Misumi D. Sudhalter J. Kobayashi K. Wroblewski D. Lynch C. Baldassare M. Hiles I. Davis J.B. Hsuan J.J. Totty N.F. Otsu M. McBurney R.N. Waterfield M.D. Stroobant P. Gwynne D. Nature. 1993; 362: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). The genomic cloning of GGF suggested that extensive alternative splicing of different functional domains within this single gene gives rise to all of the NDF/heregulin isoforms of this growing family of EGF-related growth/differentiation factors(18Marchionni M.A. Goodearl A.D.J. Chen M.S. Bermingham-McDonough O. Kirk C. Hendricks M. Danehy F. Misumi D. Sudhalter J. Kobayashi K. Wroblewski D. Lynch C. Baldassare M. Hiles I. Davis J.B. Hsuan J.J. Totty N.F. Otsu M. McBurney R.N. Waterfield M.D. Stroobant P. Gwynne D. Nature. 1993; 362: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). At least 15 variants of the NDF/heregulin family have been cloned from mesenchymal and neuronal sources, and many have been shown to display a tissue-specific pattern of expression (for review see (23Ben-Baruch N. Yarden Y. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1994; 206: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar)). Six different isoforms of rat NDF have been identified by exhaustive cDNA cloning from the ras-transformed Rat 1-EJ cells (24Wen D. Suggs S.V. Karunagaran D. Liu N. Cupples R.L. Luo Y. Janssen A.M. Ben-Baruch N. Trollinger D.B. Jacobsen V.L. Meng S.-Y. Lu H.S. Hu S. Chang D. Yang W. Yanigahara D. Koski R.A. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1909-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Based on their DNA sequences, all but one of the NDF cDNAs isolated from Rat 1-EJ were predicted to encode membrane-bound, glycosylated precursors of soluble NDF, henceforth referred to as proNDF. As a prerequisite to understanding the potential functional variation of this structurally diverse family, we have begun to characterize the biosynthetic processing of different NDF isoforms in stably transfected CHO cells expressing individual NDF isoforms, and in the native cell line, Rat 1-EJ. Because of the structural similarity of the proNDFs to proTGFα and other membrane-anchored growth factors(25Bringman T.S. Lindquist P.B. Derynck R. Cell. 1987; 48: 429-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 26Massagué J. Pandiella A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 515-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar), we have also explored the possibility that unprocessed proNDF might be transported intact to the cell surface, where it could undergo regulated proteolysis to control release, and/or be involved in juxtacrine signaling via cell-cell interactions with receptors on neighboring cells(27Bosenberg M.W. Massagué J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 832-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Using a combination of pulse-chase, deglycosylation and cell surface labeling techniques we provide evidence that proNDFs undergo typical glycosylation and trafficking. However, only a portion of the molecules undergo intracellular proteolysis, such that at steady state a significant level of full-length, membrane-bound proNDF is exposed at the cell surface in both native and transfected cells. Finally, we show that proNDF can undergo phorbol ester regulated cleavage from the membrane releasing the soluble growth factor into the medium. The biological implications of these results are considered in the discussion. Chinese hamster ovary cells deficient in dihydrofolate reductase activity (CHO d−, (28Urlaub G. Chasin L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4216-4620Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar)) were transfected with calcium phosphate using pDSRα2-derived expression vectors (29DeClerck Y.A. Yean T.D. Lu H.S. Ting J. Langley K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3893-3899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) containing the rat NDFα2c or NDFβ4 cDNAs ((24Wen D. Suggs S.V. Karunagaran D. Liu N. Cupples R.L.

Biol. 1994; 14: 1909-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar); see Fig. 1). Transfected colonies were cloned and analyzed by Western blot using an antibody directed against Escherichia coli-derived rat NDFα2c (see below). High expressing clones for NDFα2c and NDFβ4 were chosen for further analysis. The expression of NDFβ4 was gradually amplified with methotrexate(30Kaufman R.J. Sharp P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 159: 601-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). CHO d− cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, nonessential amino acids, glutamine, penicillin and streptomycin and hypoxanthine/thymidine. Transfected clones were grown in similar media using 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and lacking hypoxanthine/thymidine; in addition, methotrexate was added to 70 nM for the NDFβ4-expressing clone. Rat 1-EJ, a ras-transformed Rat 1 cell line(2Wen D. Peles E. Cupples R. Suggs S.V. Bacus S.S. Luo Y. Trail G. Hu S. Silbiger S.M. Ben Levy R. Koski R.A. Lu H.S. Yarden Y.

Recombinant E. coli-derived rat NDFα2c used in competition experiments, the generation of rabbit polyclonal antibody 1872 and the generation and purification of CHO d−-derived NDFα2c have been described(24Wen D. Suggs S.V. Karunagaran D. Liu N. Cupples R.L. Luo Y. Janssen A.M. Ben-Baruch N. Trollinger D.B. Jacobsen V.L. Meng S.-Y. Lu H.S. Hu S. Chang D. Yang W. Yanigahara D. Koski R.A. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). The rabbit polyclonal antiserum 1219 was generated using CHO d−-derived NDFα2c as the immunogen. The antibody was purified by affinity chromatography with Actigel ALD as recommended by the manufacturer (Sterogene Bioseparation, Inc., Arcadia, CA). 1.3 mg of recombinant CHO d−-derived rat NDFα2c was coupled to 2 ml of Actigel ALD superflow resin. 20 ml of crude antiserum was bound, the column washed with PBS, and eluted with Immunopure gentle antigen/antibody elution buffer (Pierce). The eluted antibodies were pooled and dialyzed overnight against PBS and concentrated with an Amicon protein concentrator to approximately 1 mg/ml. The rabbit polyclonal antiserum 1310 is an anti-peptide antibody, generated using a peptide from the cytoplasmic domain of (pro)NDF (sequence: CNSFLRHARETPDSYRDS) covalently coupled to keyhole limpet hemacyanin as the immunogen. The affinity purification and characterization procedures were similar to antibody 1219 except that the peptide was coupled to the column matrix. We have determined that antibodies 1872, 1219, and 1310 react specifically with the α and β forms of (pro)NDF in Western blotting and quantitative immunoprecipitation. Cells were grown to 70-80% confluence and then starved in medium lacking methionine and cysteine (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) for 1 h. Cells were labeled with [35S]methionine and -cysteine (Tran35S-label, ICN) at 0.5 mCi/ml. After a 30-min pulse, cells were either extracted in nonionic detergent (N-det) buffer (32Burgess T.L. Craik C.S. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 639-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) or chased with media containing excess unlabeled methionine and cysteine (Life Technologies, Inc.). Media and cell lysates were collected and protease inhibitors added immediately (aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, and o-phenanthroline; Boehringer Mannheim). Samples were brought to 0.3% SDS and 1 × N-det and incubated at room temperature with preimmune serum and protein A-agarose (Boehringer Mannheim) for 5 h. Antibody 1219 (5 μg) or 1872 (25 μg) was prebound to protein A-agarose in immunoprecipitation buffer (N-det with 0.3% SDS and protease inhibitors) for 5 h at room temperature (immune beads). Preimmune treated samples were then added to washed immune beads and incubated overnight at 4°C. Immune complexes were washed, eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and analyzed by 10% reducing SDS-PAGE (Novex, San Diego, CA; (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207139) Google Scholar)). Quantitative depletion of NDF from the samples was shown by re-immunoprecipitation of the supernatants. To reduce the background, Rat 1-EJ samples were eluted and re-immunoprecipitated before SDS-PAGE analysis. Enhancement and fluorography was carried out as described(32Burgess T.L. Craik C.S. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 639-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For competition, 10 μg of recombinant rat NDFα2c was added to the precleared samples prior to adding to the immune beads. Prestained protein molecular weight markers were from Bio-Rad and Amersham Corp. Radiolabeled pulse-chase samples from CHO d− clones were immunoprecipitated and NDF proteins eluted with 60-75 μl of elution buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 1%β-mercaptoethanol). 15-μl aliquots were diluted in water, and CHAPS (Sigma) was added to 19 μM. Glycosidase enzymes were added (endoglycosidase H, 2 milliunits; N-glycanase, 500 milliunits; neuraminidase, 20 milliunits; O-glyconase, 2 milliunits) (Genzyme, Boston, MA) in a final volume of 30 μl. After overnight digestion at 37°C, samples were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. For partial digestion of secreted NDFα2c and NDFβ4a with N-glycanase, the enzyme was used at 62.5, 250, and 1000 milliunits/reaction, then incubated at 37°C for 4 h. Western blotting was carried out essentially as described(1Peles E. Bacus S.S. Koski R.A. Lu H.S. Wen D. Ogden S.G. Ben Levy R. Yarden Y. Cell. 1992; 69: 205-216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), except that blots were blocked, then incubated with affinity-purified 1219 at 2 μg/ml in 5% nonfat dry milk for 2 h, washed three times for 5 min each in 1% nonfat dry milk, and reacted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Corp.) in 1% nonfat dry milk for 30 min. Transfected and untransfected CHO d− cells were grown on Permanox chamber slides (Nunc, Naperville, IL). PBS-rinsed, live cells were incubated at 0°C with antibody 1219 at 1 μg/ml for 1 h. Cells were washed three times with PBS and then incubated with fluorescein-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody for 30 min at 0°C. Cells were washed and fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. Slides were mounted with FITC-Guard (Testog, Chicago, IL) and then viewed and photographed on a Zeiss Axiovert 10 microscope. Cell surface proteins were biotinylated with sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)hexanoate (NHS-LC-biotin, Pierce) following procedures recommended by the manufacturer. Following cell lysis, immunoprecipitation was performed as described above. Cell surface NDF was identified by a subsequent streptavidin Western blot. For cell surface immunoprecipitation, transfected CHO d− cells were grown to confluence. Cells were removed from the culture dishes with PBS containing 5 mM EDTA and 5 mM EGTA at room temperature for 10 min. The intact, suspended cells were washed with PBS three times and then incubated with 5-10 μg/ml antibody 1219 on ice for 1 h. After extensive washing with PBS, cells were lysed with N-det buffer. The nuclei were removed by centrifugation, and supernatants were subjected to immunoprecipitation with protein A-agarose beads as described above. CHO d− clones expressing NDFα2c and NDFβ4 were grown to 70-80% confluence. Growth medium was replaced by serum-free medium for 1 h, followed by addition of fresh serum-free medium containing either 1 μM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, Sigma) and 0.1% Me2SO or 0.1% Me2SO alone as a control. Medium and lysate samples were collected at 10 and 30 min. Medium samples were concentrated 10-fold by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot. The domain structure of the NDF isoforms expressed in Rat 1-EJ cells is shown schematically in Fig. 1(see also (24Wen D. Suggs S.V. Karunagaran D. Liu N. Cupples R.L. Luo Y. Janssen A.M. Ben-Baruch N. Trollinger D.B. Jacobsen V.L. Meng S.-Y. Lu H.S. Hu S. Chang D. Yang W. Yanigahara D. Koski R.A. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1909-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar)). The extracellular portion of all NDF isoforms consists of a common N terminus, which contains an immunoglobulin domain, a spacer region containing multiple N- and O-glycosylation sites, and an EGF-like repeat. The two major classes of NDF molecules diverge in the C terminus of the EGF domain giving rise to the α and β isoforms. Additional variation is seen in the juxtamembrane region following the EGF domain by the insertion of one of three different sequences (numbered 2, 3, or 4). Isoform β3 terminates prior to the transmembrane domain and is predicted to encode a cytoplasmic version of NDF. The other isoforms all contain a common transmembrane domain. Finally, the α isoforms show further variation in the length of their cytoplasmic domains (Fig. 1; i.e. α2a, α2b, or α2c), whereas the β isoforms share the same cytoplasmic tail (Fig. 1; i.e. β2a and β4a). Additional NDF isoforms are expressed in other tissues (for review see (23Ben-Baruch N. Yarden Y. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1994; 206: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar)); for simplicity, only those identified in Rat 1-EJ cells are illustrated here (Fig. 1). Quantitative immunoprecipitates of pulse-chase samples from transfected CHO cells expressing proNDFα2c were analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE and are shown in Fig. 2a (see “Experimental Procedures”). proNDFα2c is initially synthesized as a precursor of ~63 kDa (Fig. 2a, lane1, openarrowhead). Within 30 min the majority of the precursor shows a reduced mobility of ~66 kDa consistent with maturation and addition of carbohydrate moieties (Fig. 2a, lane2, solidarrowhead; see also Fig. 3). After 30 min of chase, and continuing for several hours, this glycosylated species is proteolytically cleaved to yield the mature ~44-kDa NDFα2c molecule, a clear precursor-product relationship is seen (Fig. 2a, lanes 2-6). The prominence of the ~44-kDa species in the cell extracts at 30 min, 2 h, and 4 h of chase (Fig. 2a, lanes2, 3, and 5) and the later appearance of mature NDFα2c in the media samples (Fig. 2a, lanes4 and 6) are consistent with intracellular cleavage and subsequent secretion of the mature ~44-kDa NDFα2c (secreted NDF is not detected at 30 min, but is seen in the media after 1 h of chase; data not shown). Note that by 4 h, most, but not all, of the pulse-labeled ~66-kDa proNDFα2c has been converted to the mature protein. The prominent, long-lived species at ~60 kDa is immunologically related to proNDFα2c (as demonstrated by competition with excess cold NDFα2c, data not shown) and may be an unglycoslyated and/or improperly folded proNDFα2c remaining in the endoplasmic reticulum.Figure 3:Deglycosylation analysis of intracellular and secreted NDF. Anti-NDF 1872 immunoprecipitated 35S-labeled NDFα2c samples were digested with endoglycosidase H (Endo H), N-glycanase (N-glyc.), and O-glycanase (O-glyc.), as indicated, and analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE. a, pro-NDFα2c.

Similar to proNDFα2c, proNDFβ4 is synthesized as a large, glycosylated precursor, which is proteolytically processed to release the ~44-kDa mature NDFβ4. Due to the extended cytoplasmic domain, proNDFβ4 has a significantly larger apparent molecular weight than the proNDFα2c (Fig. 1; (24Wen D. Suggs S.V. Karunagaran D. Liu N. Cupples R.L. Luo Y.

Following the chase, proNDFβ4 migrates at about 110 kDa (Fig. 2b, lanes2, 3, and 5, solidarrowhead). Proteolytic processing of proNDFβ4 begins at a similar time as proNDFα2c; after 30 min"
https://openalex.org/W2028860815,"Pulmonary surfactant protein C (SP-C) is a 3.7-kDa, hydrophobic peptide secreted by alveolar type II epithelial cells. SP-C enhances surface tension lowering activity of surfactant phospholipids that is critical to the maintenance of alveolar volume at end expiration. The proinflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), decreased SP-C mRNA within 24 h of intratracheal administration to mice. In vitro, TNF-α decreased SP-C mRNA in a time- and dose-dependent manner, reducing the steady state levels of SP-C mRNA by 3-5-fold. In contrast, TNF-α induced intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression in both mouse lung and murine lung epithelial cell lines. Nuclear run-on analysis demonstrated that transcription of both the endogenous SP-C gene and a human SP-C promoter-driven transgene was inhibited by TNF-α. TNF-α decreased mouse SP-C-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase mRNA in stably transfected murine lung epithelial cells. Deletion analysis of the SP-C promoter region demonstrated that TNF-α inhibited gene expression in constructs containing 320 base pairs 5′ from the start of transcription of the mouse SP-C gene. Inhibition of surfactant protein C gene transcription by TNF-α may contribute to the abnormalities of surfactant homeostasis associated with pulmonary injury and infection.

Suter S. Girardin E. Roux-Lombard P. Grau G.E. Dayer J. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1992; 145: 1016-1022Google Scholar). TNF-α and other cytokines increase the expression of adhesion molecules including intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, and endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule 1 and alter vascular permeability following injury and infection (reviewed in (2Springer T.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 425-434Google Scholar)). The resulting pulmonary inflammation and increased alveolar permeability cause leakage of serum proteins into the alveolar space leading to surfactant dysfunction and loss of lung compliance. The hydrophobic proteins, SP-B and SP-C, enhance the rate of spreading and stability of surfactant phospholipids and protect against surfactant inactivation by serum proteins (reviewed in (3Beers M.F. Fisher A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: L151-L160Google Scholar)). Surfactant proteins are decreased in bronchoalveolar lavage of ARDS patients(4Gregory T.J. Longmore W.J. Moxley M.A. Whitsett J.A. Reed C.R. Fowler A.A. Hudson L.D. Maunder R.J. Crim C. Hyers T.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1976-1981Google Scholar), indicating that the protective effects of surfactant proteins on respiratory function may be compromised. In laboratory animals, intratracheal administration of TNF-α causes increased pulmonary ICAM-1 expression, acute lung inflammation, and pulmonary edema(5Mulligan M.S. Vaporciyan A.A. Miyasaka M.

In vitro, TNF-α decreased SP-A and SP-B synthesis, the latter mediated by destabilization of SP-B mRNA through element(s) in the 3′-untranslated region of the human SP-B mRNA(8Pryhuber G.S. Church S.L. Kroft T. Panchal A. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: L16-L24Google Scholar).

In the lung, TNF-α is produced primarily by activated pulmonary macrophages and accumulates in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with acute lung injury. Most cells express two distinct high affinity receptors for TNF-α, TNF-R1 (type 1 or 55-kDa receptor) and TNF-R2 (type 2 or 75-kDa receptor)(9Goodwin R.G. Anderson D. Jerzy R. Davis T. Brannan C.I.

Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2830-2834Google Scholar). Induction of ICAM-1 expression by TNF-α is mediated by TNF-R1 signaling as an early event after binding to endothelial cells(11Mackay F. Loetscher H. Stueber D. Gehr G. Lesslauer W. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1277-1286Google Scholar). The pattern of ICAM-1 induction by cytokines (TNF-α and interferon-γ) in primary tracheal epithelial cells is distinct from that in vascular endothelial cells (12Look D.C. Pelletier M.R. Holtzman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8952-8958Google Scholar), supporting the concept that different intracellular pathways are involved in TNF-α signaling in various lung cell types. In the present study, TNF-α decreased SP-C mRNA in vivo and inhibited SP-C gene transcription in vitro. Cis-active signals located within 320 base pairs of the start of transcription of the mouse SP-C gene were sufficient to mediate the inhibitory effects of TNF-α on SP-C gene expression in respiratory epithelial cells. Two- to three-month-old, pathogen-free, FVB/N mice were anesthetized with methoxyflurane vapor. Intratracheal inoculation was performed by exposing the trachea with an anterior midline incision and insertion of a 27-gauge needle attached to a tuberculin syringe parallel to the trachea. A 50-μl inoculum was dispensed into the lungs followed by approximately 0.2 cc of air. The incision was closed with 1 drop of Nexaband liquid (Veterinary Products Laboratories, Phoenix, AZ). At 24 h after administration, mice were sacrificed by exsanguination after lethal intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (Nembutal, Abbott). Total RNA was isolated from the left lung and, in some experiments, from both left and right lower lobes with similar results. Murine lung epithelial cell lines MLE-12 and MLE-15 were maintained in HITES medium with 2% fetal bovine serum as described(13Wikenheiser K.A. Vorbroker D.K. Rice W.R. Clark J.C. Bachurski C.J. Oie H.K. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11029-11033Google Scholar). MLE cells are clonal lines derived from pulmonary tumors in mice transgenic for the human 3.7 SP-C SV40 large T antigen chimeric gene(14Wikenheiser K.A. Clark J.C. Linnoila R.I. Stahlman M.T. Whitsett J.A. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 5342-5352Google Scholar). These lines share several characteristics with pulmonary type II cells including production of surfactant proteins and phospholipids and the presence of multilamellar bodies and microvilli(13Wikenheiser K.A. Vorbroker D.K. Rice W.R. Clark J.C. Bachurski C.J. Oie H.K. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11029-11033Google Scholar). Cells were used at passages 10-20 in culture. Recombinant human TNF-α (rhTNF-α) and mouse TNF-α (rmTNF-α) were kindly provided by Genentech (Palo Alto, CA). Additional rhTNF-α was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. At the time of treatment with TNF-α, cells were maintained in HITES medium with or without hydrocortisone with similar results. At the indicated time points, monolayers were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution (Life Technologies, Inc.) and lysed in 4 M guanidinium thiocyanate, 25 mM Hepes, pH 7, 0.5% Sarkosyl, 0.1 M 2-mercaptoethanol(15Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated using phase lock gels (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Gaithersburg, MD). MLE-15 cells were co-transfected with CAT reporter constructs (described below) and pRSVneo using the CaPO4 co-precipitation method(16Rosenthal N. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 704-720Google Scholar). After 3 days of growth, transfectants were selected by treatment with 400 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) in HITES medium with 2% fetal bovine serum. Pools of clones containing several hundred colonies were trypsinized and treated as mixed populations. At least two independently generated mixed populations were tested for each construct. Murine SP-C promoter sequences were retrieved as several large overlapping Lambda Dash clones from a murine 129/J genomic library (gift of Roger Askew, Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Cincinnati) using previously published (17Glasser S.W. Korfhagen T.R. Bruno M.D. Dey C. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21986-21991Google Scholar) human SP-C cDNA sequences as probes. A 5-kb XbaI fragment was excised and inserted into pUC19's multiple cloning site at XbaI and consists of 4.8-kb promoter sequences, the first exon, and a portion of the first intron. The intron and coding portion of the first exon were removed by Bal-31 digestion from a unique KpnI site, blunt end ligated to XhoI linkers, and liberated by an XhoI and AccI digest. This fragment was directionally cloned into pBLCAT 6 (18Boshart M. Klüppel M. Schmidt A. Schütz G. Luckow B. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 129-130Google Scholar) using the same enzymes. Sequencing determined that this construct (p4.8 muCAT) contains a 4.8-kb murine promoter sequence and 18 bp of the first exon followed by the introduced XhoI site and then the vector-derived reporter gene, CAT. Deletions of p4.8 muCAT were produced using restriction enzymes, which cut uniquely in both the murine promoter and in the multiple cloning region of pBLCAT6 (SphI for p0.8 muCAT and PstI for the p0.32 muCAT). S1 nuclease mapping was done essentially as described previously(19Bachurski C.J. Theodorakis N.G. Coulson R.M.R. Cleveland D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4076-4086Google Scholar). Linearized probes were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP, combined, and hybridized overnight at 56°C with total lung RNA (2 μg) or MLE cell RNA (10 μg). Protected fragments were liberated by digestion with 110 units of S1 nuclease in the presence of excess unlabeled carrier DNA for 1 h at room temperature. The fragments were resolved on 8 M urea, 6% polyacrylamide gels, visualized by autoradiography, and quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. The S1 probe specific for murine SP-C mRNA (20Dranoff G. Crawford A.D. Sadelain M. Ream B. Rashid A. Bronson R.T. Dickersin G.R. Bachurski C.J. Mark E.L. Whitsett J.A. Mulligan R.C. Science. 1994; 264: 713-716Google Scholar) contained the 3′-half of the SP-C gene and was linearized at the BamHI site 135 nucleotides 3′ of the intron-exon junction of exon 6. A portion of the murine cytoplasmic β-actin cDNA(20Dranoff G. Crawford A.D. Sadelain M. Ream B. Rashid A. Bronson R.T. Dickersin G.R. Bachurski C.J. Mark E.L. Whitsett J.A. Mulligan R.C. Science. 1994; 264: 713-716Google Scholar), ScaI to the 3′ end, was subcloned in pGEM7z (f+), and a 1.1-kb Alw44I fragment of this subclone, containing 100 bp of β-actin cDNA, was used as an internal control. In experiments with mouse lung RNA, a probe for mouse ribosomal protein L32 (L32) cDNA was used as an internal control since TNF-α treatment caused a slight induction of β-actin mRNA in vivo. A 0.6-kb HindIII to DraI fragment encompassing most of the L32 cDNA was subcloned from pL32/33 (22Dudov K.P. Perry R.P. Cell. 1984; 37: 457-468Google Scholar) into pGEM7z(f+). A 730-bp PvuII fragment of the subclone containing 400 bp of L32 cDNA was used as a probe for S1 nuclease analysis, and the whole insert (EcoRI to BamHI) was used for Northern blots. For Northern blot analysis, 15 μg of total RNA/lane was resolved by electrophoresis through 1% agarose, 2.2 M formaldehyde gels. RNAs were blotted onto Magna charge nylon membranes (MSI, Westborom, MA), UV cross-linked, and sequentially hybridized to α-32P-labeled probes, as indicated, in hybridization buffer (0.5 M phosphate buffer at pH 7.2, 3.5% SDS, 33% formamide, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mM EDTA, 20 μg/ml yeast tRNA) at 55°C overnight. Blots were washed to 0.2 × SET (1 × SET is 150 mM NaCl, 30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 2 mM EDTA), 0.1% SDS at 55°C, autoradiographed, and quantitated by a PhosphorImager. PhosphorImager data from Northern and S1 nuclease protection assays of mouse lung RNA were analyzed by single-factor analysis of variance and Fischer's protected least significant difference statistic, utilizing Statview 4.0 statistical analysis software (Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA) on a Macintosh computer system. The data were normalized to L32 and are presented as a fraction of the mRNA detected in saline-treated lungs. The CAT GenBlock™ (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) was random primer labeled with [α-32P]dCTP and used as a probe for CAT mRNA. Clone K41.1, containing the mouse ICAM-1 cDNA (23Horley K.J. Carpenito C. Baker B. Takei F. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2889-2896Google Scholar), was digested with EcoRI and HindIII, and the 1.39-kb fragment encompassing the 3′ half of the cDNA was used as a probe for Northern blot analysis. For cytoplasmic β-actin, the 5′ half of the murine actin cDNA(21Alonso S. Minty A. Bourlet Y. Buckingham M. J. Mol. Evol. 1986; 23: 11-22Google Scholar), Asp718 to BglII, was used for Northern blots and subcloned into the Asp718 to BamHI sites of M13 mp18 as a run-on probe. A 1.1-kb HindIII fragment of the SV40 genome (map units 4002-5171) encompassing a portion of the coding region of the SV40 large and small T antigen genes was used for Northern blots and was subcloned into M13 mp18 for use as a run-on probe. An Asp718 to BamHI fragment of the mouse SP-C gene spanning exons 3-6 was subcloned into M13 mp19 for run-on analysis. Identity and orientation of the run-on probes were confirmed by dideoxy sequence analysis. Preparation of nuclei and nuclear run-on assays were done essentially as described previously(24Savant-Bhonsale S. Cleveland D.W. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1927-1939Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclei were harvested from approximately 5 × 107 cells by gentle vortexing in 700 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.4, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation, and cytoplasmic RNA was isolated from the supernatant by adding 2 volumes of guanidinium thiocyanate buffer and processing as for whole cell RNA (see above). The nuclei were resuspended in an equal volume of storage buffer (40% glycerol, 50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA) and frozen at −80°C until assayed. To label nascent transcripts, nuclei were thawed on ice and incubated in 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 2.5 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM dithiothreitol, 75 mM KCl, and 5% glycerol in the presence of 0.35 mM each ATP, GTP, CTP, and 0.4 μM UTP plus 200 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mM, DuPont NEN) for 30 min at 30°C. The reaction was stopped by digestion with RNase-free DNase I for 15 min at 37°C followed by digestion with proteinase K in the presence of 0.1% SDS and extraction with phenol/chloroform. Nucleic acids were precipitated with cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, sequentially washed with 5% trichloroacetic acid and ethanol, and resuspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mM EDTA, and 0.5% SDS. As a control for specificity of transcription, one reaction was performed in the presence of 2 μg/ml α-amanitin to inhibit RNA polymerase II. Hybridization of run-on transcription products to single-stranded M13-based probes bound to nylon filters was performed at 55°C for 48-56 h in the Northern hybridization buffer described above using at least 107 cpm/ml. Intratracheal administration of TNF-α to adult mice inhibited SP-C mRNA within 24 h (Fig. 1). In contrast, ICAM-1 mRNA was markedly induced by TNF-α while MRPL32 (L32), a ribosomal protein mRNA, was unaltered. The animals appeared well and continued normal activities after TNF-α administration. Changes in SP-C mRNA occurred in association with histologic evidence of mild pulmonary inflammation, monocytic infiltration, and decreased SP-B mRNA content. 2G. S. Pryhuber, unpublished observations. SP-A mRNA levels were not significantly altered by TNF-α treatment (data not shown). Both rhTNF-α and rmTNF-α significantly decreased SP-C mRNA and increased ICAM-1 mRNA in vivo. MLE-12 cells, a murine pulmonary epithelial cell line expressing SV40 large T antigen (TAg) under control of the human 3.7SP-C gene promoter(13Wikenheiser K.A. Vorbroker D.K. Rice W.R. Clark J.C. Bachurski C.J. Oie H.K. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11029-11033Google Scholar), were used as a model system to study the mechanisms by which TNF-α inhibits SP-C mRNA. Exposure of MLE-12 cells to mouse or human TNF-α decreased endogenous SP-C mRNA 3-5-fold as assessed by S1 nuclease protection analysis (Fig. 2, toppanel). The endogenous ICAM-1 mRNA and the SV40 TAg mRNA, produced from the human 3.7SP-C SV40 TAg construct used to immortalize the cells, were measured by Northern blot analysis. Human and mouse TNF-α markedly decreased SV40 TAg mRNA and increased ICAM-1 mRNA (Fig. 2, bottompanel). Inhibitory effects of TNF-α on murine SP-C and SV40 TAg mRNAs were time- and dose-dependent. Maximal inhibition of SP-C and SV40 TAg mRNAs was observed with 20-40 ng/ml rmTNF (Fig. 3). TNF-α significantly decreased SV40 TAg mRNA in MLE-12 cells by 12 h of treatment and decreased endogenous SP-C mRNA at all time points after 12 h (Fig. 4). In contrast, ICAM-1 mRNA was maximally induced by 8 h and remained elevated 24 h after treatment with TNF-α. TNF-α did not alter cell viability as assessed by trypan blue exclusion and a non-radioactive cell proliferation assay (Promega, Madison, WI). As observed in vivo, both rh- and rmTNF-α significantly inhibited SP-C mRNA in vitro.Figure 4:Time course of the inhibitory effect of TNF-α on SP-C mRNA. MLE-12 cells were treated with 25 ng/ml rmTNF-α, and total RNA was harvested at the indicated time points. Lane1, untreated; lane2, 8 h; lane3, 12 h; lane4, 15 h; lane5, 18 h; lane6, 21 h; lane7, 24 h. PanelA represents an S1 nuclease analysis of 10 μg/lane for SP-C mRNA using β-actin as an internal control. PanelB represents Northern blot analysis of the same RNA samples (15 μg/lane) as in A, sequentially hybridized with probes for SV40 TAg, β-actin, and ICAM-1 mRNAs. Data representative of three experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) TNF-α inhibited transcription of the endogenous mouse SP-C and human 3.7SP-C promoter-driven SV40 TAg genes in MLE-12 cells as assessed by nuclear run-on assay (Fig. 5A). The inhibitory effect of TNF-α on gene transcription increased with longer incubation times and was maximal by 16 h of exposure to TNF-α (Fig. 5B). Transcription of β-actin was unaffected by TNF-α treatment. The observed inhibition of SP-C and SV40 TAg gene transcription was similar in extent and timing to the decrease in steady state mRNA levels. Constructs containing 4.8-0.32 kb of the murine SP-C proximal promoter were sufficient to confer inhibitory effects of TNF-α on reporter gene expression. Portions of the murine SP-C promoter were fused to the reporter gene, CAT, and stably transfected into MLE-15 cells (constructs are diagrammed in Fig. 6A). TNF-α decreased CAT mRNA in independently generated pools of stably transfected cells harboring the murine SP-C promoter deletion-CAT constructs, including constructs containing 320 bp 5′ of the start of SP-C gene transcription (Fig. 6B). Intratracheal administration of TNF-α to adult mice decreased SP-C mRNA in association with mild pulmonary inflammation in vivo. Transcriptional run-on analysis in MLE cells in vitro demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of TNF-α on SP-C expression was mediated, at least in part, by decreased SP-C gene transcription. TNF-α inhibited the activity of both murine and human SP-C promoter elements in MLE cells, demonstrating that the effects of TNF-α were determined by cis-active elements located within 3.7-4.6 kb of the start of transcription. Deletion analysis of the murine SP-C promoter demonstrated that the inhibitory activity was mediated by cis-acting elements located within 320 bp of the start of SP-C gene transcription. Respiratory distress syndrome in premature infants and in older infants and adults (ARDS) is associated with the lack or dysfunction of pulmonary surfactant that reduces surface tension in the alveolus (see (25Lewis J.F. Jobe A.H. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1993; 147: 218-233Google Scholar), for review). Surfactant proteins and phospholipids are both decreased in ARDS, a condition associated with marked increase in airway TNF-α(1Suter P.M. Suter S. Girardin E. Roux-Lombard P. Grau G.E. Dayer J. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1992; 145: 1016-1022Google Scholar). The finding that TNF-α inhibited surfactant protein synthesis and that high levels of TNF-α are associated with respiratory failure (reviewed in (26Strieter R.M. Kunkel S.L. Bone R.C. Crit. Care Med. 1993; 21: S447-S463Google Scholar)) supports the concept that respiratory distress syndrome is caused, at least in part, by TNF-α-mediated surfactant dysfunction and decreased surfactant production by alveolar type II cells. TNF-α decreased surfactant proteins A and B and mRNA in human adenocarcinoma cells in vitro(27Wispé J.R. Clark J.C. Warner B.B. Fajardo D. Hull W.E. Holtzman R.B. Whitsett J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1954-1960Google Scholar). In previous studies from this laboratory, inhibitory effects of TNF-α on human SP-A gene expression were mediated by inhibition of gene transcription(28Whitsett J.A. Clark J.C. Wispé J.R. Pryhuber G.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: L688-L693Google Scholar). In contrast, TNF-α and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate inhibited SP-B synthesis and mRNA by a process dependent on the destabilization of SP-B mRNA mediated by cis-active elements located in the 3′-untranslated region of the human SP-B mRNA(8Pryhuber G.S. Church S.L. Kroft T. Panchal A. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: L16-L24Google Scholar). The present findings demonstrate that in addition to the effects of TNF-α on expression of surfactant proteins A and B, TNF-α markedly inhibits SP-C mRNA and SP-C gene transcription in vitro. Whether the observed inhibition of SP-C mRNA in vivo occurs by the same mechanism remains to be shown. Like other genes in the respiratory epithelium, SP-C expression is subject to cell-specific, ontogenetic, and humoral regulatory influences. SP-C mRNA and transcriptional activity are first detected in distal respiratory epithelial cells of the developing lung on days 10-11 of gestation in the mouse(29Wert S.E. Glasser S.W. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Dev. Biol. 1993; 156: 426-443Google Scholar). Lung-specific and developmental control of SP-C expression was determined by cis-active elements located within 3-4 kb 5′ from the start of transcription in both the mouse and human SP-C genes(29Wert S.E. Glasser S.W. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Dev. Biol. 1993; 156: 426-443Google Scholar, 30Glasser S.W. Korfhagen T.R. Wert S.E. Bruno M.D. McWilliams K.M. Vorbroker D.K. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: L349-L356Google Scholar). The mouse 4.8 SP-C promoter was transactivated in HeLa cells by co-expression of thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), a nuclear homeodomain containing transcription factor expressed in distal respiratory epithelial cells in both human and mouse lung(31Bohinski R.J. DiLauro R. Whitsett J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5671-5681Google Scholar). TTF-1 activates SP-C promoter function by direct binding to cis-acting elements in the SP-C gene promoter, located within 320 bp of the start of transcription. 3S. E. Kelly, C. J. Bachurski, and S. W. Glasser, unpublished observations. Recently, DNA binding activity and dimerization of TTF-1 were shown to be reduction/oxidation (redox) regulated in vitro(32Arnone M.I. Zannini M. Di Lauro R. J.

The lack of cell lines expressing SP-C limited prior analysis of SP-C gene transcription to in vivo studies in transgenic mice bearing SP-C-driven reporter genes. The recent development of clonal mouse lung epithelial cell lines (MLE-12 and MLE-15) from lung tumors of transgenic mice bearing 3.7SP-C SV40 TAg chimeric gene (13Wikenheiser K.A. Vorbroker D.K. Rice W.R. Clark J.C. Bachurski C.J. Oie H.K. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11029-11033Google Scholar) facilitated the in vitro analysis of SP-C gene transcription. In the present study, TNF-α inhibited promoter activity of both murine and human SP-C reporter gene constructs in the MLE cell model system. TNF-α was equally active in the inhibition of the human and murine SP-C promoter elements consistent with the close sequence conservation of the 5′-flanking region of the SP-C genes in the human and mouse, particularly within the 320-bp proximal promoter region(17Glasser S.W. Korfhagen T.R. Bruno M.D. Dey C. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21986-21991Google Scholar). The inhibitory effects of TNF-α were observed with recombinant human and mouse TNF-α and contrasted sharply with the marked stimulatory effects of human and mouse TNF-α on ICAM-1 gene expression in vitro and in vivo. The present findings are consistent with the modulation of SP-C gene transcription by signaling through the TNF-R1 or the 55-kDa form of the tumor necrosis factor receptor. Most cell types express one or two distinct receptors for TNF-α, specifically the type 1 receptor (TNF-R1) or the 55-kDa form or the type 2 (TNF-R2) 75-kDa form(9Goodwin R.G. Anderson D. Jerzy R. Davis T. Brannan C.I. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Smith C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3020-3026Google Scholar, 10Lewis M. Tartaglia L.A. Lee A. Bennett G.L. Rice G.C. Wong G.H.W. Chen E.Y. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2830-2834Google Scholar). The extracellular domains of these receptors contain four conserved cysteine-rich motifs while the intracellular domains are divergent, suggesting that the two receptors activate distinct intracellular signaling pathways. Human TNF-α selectively binds to the mouse TNF-R1 receptor and does not activate the TNF-R2 receptor(10Lewis M. Tartaglia L.A. Lee A. Bennett G.L. Rice G.C. Wong G.H.W. Chen E.Y. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2830-2834Google Scholar). In the present study, both mouse and human TNF-α inhibited SP-C gene transcription, supporting the concept that the effects of TNF-α on SP-C gene expression are mediated by activation of P55 or type 1 TNF-α receptor. However, the relatively slow time course of TNF-α inhibition of SP-C expression suggests that changes in SP-C gene transcription may be mediated by more complex intracellular signaling pathways than for ICAM-1, a gene known to be activated by P55 receptor signaling(11Mackay F. Loetscher H. Stueber D. Gehr G. Lesslauer W. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1277-1286Google Scholar). In the present study, TNF-α markedly enhanced ICAM-1 mRNA levels in MLE cells within 8 h after exposure. TNF-α activates a number of transcription factors including AP-1, IRF-1 and IRF-2, and NF-IL6 (reviewed in (33Vilcek J. Lee T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7313-7316Google Scholar)) and causes the nuclear translocation of transcription factor NFκB within minutes after TNF-α exposure(34Hohmann G. Remy R. Pöschl B. van Loon A.P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15183-15188Google Scholar). TNF-α increased ICAM-1 in fibroblasts and epithelial cells in a process mediated, at least in part, by translocation of NFκB(35Voraberger G. Schäfer R. Stratowa C. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2777-2786Crossref Google Scholar, 36Degitz K. Lian-Jie L. Caughman S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14024-14030Google Scholar). The rapid effects of TNF-α on ICAM-1 expression in MLE cells were similar to that previously identified in human bronchial epithelial and pulmonary adenocarcinoma cells(35Voraberger G. Schäfer R. Stratowa C. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2777-2786Crossref Google Scholar, 37Bloemen P.G. van den Tweel M.C. Henricks P.A. Engels F. Wagenaar S.S. Rutten A.A. Nijkamp F.P. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1993; 9: 586-593Google Scholar). Inhibitory effects of TNF-α on SP-C gene transcription in MLE cells occurred more slowly. In human adenocarcinoma cells, inhibitory effects of TNF-α on SP-A and SP-B expression were also relatively slow and dependent upon ongoing transcription(26Strieter R.M. Kunkel S.L. Bone R.C. Crit. Care Med. 1993; 21: S447-S463Google Scholar, 27Wispé J.R. Clark J.C. Warner B.B. Fajardo D. Hull W.E. Holtzman R.B. Whitsett J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1954-1960Google Scholar, 38Pryhuber G.S. O'Reilly M.A. Clark J.C. Hull W.M. Fink I. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20822-20828Google Scholar). Thus the mechanisms signaling the inhibitory effects of TNF-α on SP-C transcription remain unclear at present but appear to be distinct from those mediating ICAM-1 induction. TNF-α-mediated inhibition of osteocalcin expression in osteoblasts was dependent on TNF-responsive elements located in the proximal promoter of the human osteocalcin gene(39Li Y. Stashenko P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3714-3721Google Scholar). Comparison of the sequence of the murine SP-C promoter used in the present study with the consensus sequence for the TNF-α response element in the human osteocalcin gene (GGC(A/T)GCC) revealed no obvious homologies. The precise DNA-protein interactions mediating the effects of TNF-α on SP-C gene expression remain to be elucidated. In the present study, TNF-α markedly inhibited surfactant protein C gene expression in association with stimulation of ICAM-1 mRNA, an adhesion molecule that modulates the binding of inflammatory cells to the pulmonary epithelium. Enhancement of ICAM-1 expression by TNF-α may exacerbate the recruitment and activation of leukocytes in the lung, further contributing to lung injury. Thus the combined effects of TNF-α on surfactant protein and ICAM-1 mRNAs may contribute to the pathogenesis of surfactant dysfunction and inflammation associated with various forms of lung injury.

https://openalex.org/W2032113284,"The substrate specificities of two human prohormone convertases, furin and PC1, were examined with a series of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarinamide (MCA) containing peptidyl substrates. Using acetyl-Arg-Ser-Lys-Arg-MCA as model, P4 Arg substitution by Lys or Orn resulted for furin in a 538- and a 280-fold lower kcat/Km value, but only in a 14- and 18-fold decrease for PC1. Substitution of P3 Ser by either Pro, Glu, or Lys does not modify significantly the kcat/Km value for PC1, whereas furin activity is seriously impaired by the Glu substitution. Elongating the peptidyl sequence up to the P8 position decreases the kcat/Km value for furin but not for PC1. In both the P3 or P5 Glu substitution, the decrease of kcat/Km was due primarily to lower kcat rather than higher Km, possibly because of the presence of a negatively charged side chain. Finally, an octapeptidyl chloromethane derivative proved to be a potent irreversible inhibitor of either PC1 and furin. The 811-fold difference in the apparent Kapp/[I] (1.63 × 106 s−1M−1), and kcat/Km determined with the corresponding peptidyl MCA substrate (2.01 × 103 s−1M−1), supports the proposal that cleavage of the acylenzyme represents the rate-limiting step for PC1 and furin.

Recently, a number of convertases were discovered which share a common role in carrying out processing of protein and prohormone precursors at distinct single or pairs of basic residues. So far, six mammalian processing enzymes are known which exhibit significant functional and structural similarities to both yeast kexin and bacterial subtilisins. These subtilisin/kexin-like convertases (reviewed in (1Seidah N.G. Day R. Marcinkiewicz M. Benjannet S. Chrétien M. Enzymes. 1991; 45: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 2Steiner D.F.

Apart from their structural relatedness to kexin, further evidence in favor of their roles in precursor processing in either the constitutive or the regulated pathway of secretion was deduced from cellular co-expression and localization studies. Thus, for example, overexpression of PC1 or PC2 together with proopiomelanocortin in mammalian cells led to specific processing of this precursor at the COOH-terminal side of pairs of basic residues(5Benjannet S. Rondeau N. Day R. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3564-3568Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Similarly, furin when expressed in both endocrine and non-endocrine cell types can also process various precursors at sites characterized by the presence of an Arg-Xaa-Lys/Arg-Arg sequence(6Rehemtulla A. Kaufman R.J. Blood. 1992; 79: 2349-2355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Hatsuzawa K. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 296-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In fact, the number of potential substrates recognized by furin is expanding rapidly to include peptide growth factors such as β-nerve growth factor (8Breshnahan P.A. Leduc R. Thomas L. Thorner J. Gibson H.L. Brake A.J. Barr P.J. Thomas G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2851-2859Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) and viral envelope glycoproteins such as hemagglutinin of influenza virus(9Stieneke-Gröber A. Vey M. Angliker H. Shaw E.

Analysis of the poly(A)+ mRNAs of the convertases in rat tissues and various cell lines by Northern blot analysis demonstrated a unique pattern for each enzyme(4Seidah N.G. Chrétien M. Day R. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Thus, although furin, PACE4, and PC5 mRNAs exhibit a widespread tissue distribution, only furin is ubiquitously expressed. In contrast, Northern and in situ hybridization analysis of PC1 and PC2 indicate that they are primarily expressed in tissues and cells containing secretory granules. Finally, PC4 mRNA is only expressed in germ cells of the testis and ovary. pair of basic amino acids cleaving enzyme 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin t-butyloxycarbonyl t-butyl fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl 4-methylcoumaryl-1-amide prohormone convertase (the prefix h, r, or m denotes the human, rat, or murine prohormone convertase respectively) 2,2,5,7,8-pentamethylchroman-6-sulfonyl reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyl uronium tetrafluoroborate trifluoroethanol thin layer chromatography benzyloxycarbonyl proinsulin. The substrate positions are denoted Pi… P2, P1, P'1, P'2, … P'J in accordance with the site of cleavage. The cellular co-expression of enzyme and substrate was extremely revealing in terms of intracellular activities of the convertases and their cleavage specificities. However, the limiting level of some intracellular convertases, such as furin, suggests that overexpression systems might not be the physiologically relevant way to analyze the functioning of a given convertase(10Walker J.A. Molloy S.S. Thomas G. Sakaguchi T. Yoshida T. Chambers T.M. Kawaoka Y. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1213-1218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, in order to better understand the physiological role as well as the molecular characteristics of these enzymes, an in vitro analysis is mandatory. For this purpose, the use of heterologous expression systems offered a way to produce these enzymes at levels above that of endogenous contaminating enzymes. Until now, only few reports are available regarding the substrate specificities of recombinant furin or recombinant PC1 using in vitro experiments. Those include substrate precursors such as hproinsulin(11Bailyes E.M. Hutton J.C. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), anthrax-protective antigen(12Molloy S.S.

Interestingly, as we and others have demonstrated previously, both recombinant furin and PC1 prefer substrates with an Arg residue occupying the P4 position relative to the cleavage site characterized by the presence of a pair of basic residues such as in Arg-Xaa-Lys/Arg-Arg or of a single basic residue such as in Arg-Xaa-Xaa-Arg. The present comparative study of both human furin and PC1 using fluorogenic substrates aims at describing more precisely the biochemical basis behind their apparent overlapping substrate specificities. The preparation as well as the comparison of the cleavage efficiency as determined by measuring kcat/Km of several 7-amino-4-methylcoumarinamide derivatives are reported. Finally, based upon this study, a peptidyl chloromethane derivative was prepared and shown to be a very potent irreversible inhibitor for both PC1 and furin, useful for specific labeling and titration purposes. All amino acid derivatives (L-form) were purchased from Calbiochem. The reagents and solvents for solid-phase peptide synthesis were from Applied Biosystems (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), whereas other reagents and solvents for liquid-phase peptide synthesis were bought from the Armand Frappier Institute (Laval, Québec, Canada). The fluorogenic substrate pGlu-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-MCA was obtained from Peptide International (Louisville, KY), whereas all other MCA derivatives were prepared in our laboratory. The solid-phase peptide synthesis was carried out using an Applied Biosystems 430A automatic peptide synthesizer model using Fmoc chemistry. Amino acid analyses were performed following 18-h hydrolysis in 5.7 N HCl at 110°C in vacuo, and the hydrolysates were analyzed using a modified Beckman 120C autoanalyser equipped with a Varian DS 604 integrator/plotter and using post-column ninhydrin detection. The crude peptidyl derivatives were purified by RP-HPLC as described previously(17Jean F. Basak A. DiMaio J. Seidah N.G. Lazure C. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). TLC was performed on silica gel precoated (0.2 mm thickness) aluminium sheets (Kiesel gel, Merck Co.). The following solvent systems were used for ascending TLC (v/v): A, CHCl3/MeOH (24:1); B, CHCl3/MeOH (2:1); C, CHCl3/MeOH (12:1); D, n-BuOH/HOAc/H2O/pyridine (15:3:12:10); and E, CHCl3/MeOH (10:7). The spots were revealed by UV illumination or by spraying with molybdate/sulfuric acid or dilute ninhydrin. The two human endoproteases, prohormone convertase 1 (hPC1) and hfurin, were obtained from the medium of somatomammotroph GH4C1 cells following infection with the respective recombinant vaccinia virus as described(15Jean F. Basak A. Rondeau N. Benjannet S. Hendy G.N. Seidah N.G. Chrétien M. Lazure C. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 891-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The two proteases were partially purified through anion exchange chromatography prior to use and their enzymatic activities determined using a fluorometric assay as described previously(15Jean F. Basak A. Rondeau N. Benjannet S. Hendy G.N. Seidah N.G. Chrétien M. Lazure C. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 891-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). One unit of enzymatic activity is defined as the amount of enzyme necessary to release 1 pmol of AMC from the fluorogenic substrate acetyl-Arg-Ser-Lys-Arg-MCA per minute. All peptidyl-MCA derivatives were synthesized according to the scheme described in Fig. 1. The method will be described in detail using the fluorogenic peptide acetyl-Arg-Ser-Lys-Arg-MCA (II), whereas only the final chemical characterization data will be reported for the other derivatives. Fmoc-Arg(Pmc)-OH (2.4 g; 3.2 mmol) was dissolved in dimethylformamide (4 ml) and cooled to −20°C. N-Methylmorpholine (0.39 g; 3.8 mmol) and isobutyl chloroformate (0.5 g; 3.8 mmol) were added. The mixture was stirred for 30 min at −20°C under nitrogen atmosphere prior to addition of AMC (0.5 g; 2.9 mmol). The reaction was stirred at room temperature and compound I was recovered by preparative TLC, RF(A): 0.27. The overall yield of the purified fluorogenic amide was 80-85% (based on weight); FAB-MS: m/z 820 (M + H)+; 1H NMR: data are in agreement with the proposed structure. The synthesis of acetyl-Arg(Pmc)-Ser(tBu)-Lys(Boc)-OH (IIa) was accomplished on an automated peptide synthesizer using the Fmoc chemistry in combination with the preloaded acid labile Rink resin (Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-Rink resin; 0.5 mmol/g resin)(18Rink H. Tetrahedron Lett. 1987; 28: 3787-3790Crossref Scopus (801) Google Scholar). The following side chain protections were used: Boc for Lys, tBu for Ser, and Pmc for Arg. After the removal of the last Fmoc-protecting group, the resin was treated (2 h) with an excess of acetic anhydride (1 mmol). The acetyl-Arg(Pmc)-Ser(tBu)-Lys(Boc)-Rink resin was suspended in a solution of 1% trifluoroacetic acid, dichloromethane (v/v) for 2 min and then the resin was washed with TFE. These steps were repeated two to three times. Evaporation of the solvent gave a white solid residue. TLC revealed the presence of a single component (RF(B): 0.58) identified as IIa by its 1H NMR spectra and its FAB-MS spectra (m/z 854 (M + H)+). The overall yield of the protected tripeptide was 85-90%, based on powder weight. The acetyl-Arg(Pmc)-Ser(tBu)-Lys(Boc)-Arg(Pmc)-MCA (IIb) was obtained by condensing Ia and IIa using the activating reagent TBTU(19Knorr R. Trzeciak A. Bannwarth W. Gillessen D. Tetrahedron Lett. 1989; 30: 1927-1930Crossref Scopus (915) Google Scholar). Compound I (74.1 mg; 90.5 mmol) was added to a solution of 20% piperidine, dimethylacetamide. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue washed with dimethylacetamide several times. The free amine Ia was then added to a solution of compound IIa (75 mg; 90.4 mmol), triethylamine (91 mg; 87.8 mmol) and TBTU (29 mg; 90.4 mmol) in 3 ml of dimethylacetamide, and the resulting mixture was stirred at ambient temperature. After 30 min, TLC analysis showed a major compound; RF(C): 0.42. The reaction mixture was precipitated using an ice-cold acid solution (pH 3; HCl). The resulting precipitate was filtered and dried in vacuo. Purification through preparative TLC plates using solvent system C afforded compound IIb (60-65% yield based on weight). FAB-MS: m/z 1434 (M + H)+. Its 1H NMR spectrum was fully consistent with its structure. The final deprotection of the peptidyl-MCA derivative IIb was performed by reacting with reagent K (20King D.S. Fields C.G. Fields G.B. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1990; 36: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar) for 4 h at room temperature. After appropriate dilution with water and lyophilization, the residue was repetitively washed with ether to remove the excess of scavengers. The material was finally purified by RP-HPLC and eluted at 31.7 min (32% CH3CN). FAB-MS: m/z 745 (M + H)+. Amino acid analysis: Ser1.0(1), Lys1.1(1), Arg1.9(2). The 1H NMR spectrum was fully consistent with its structure. For acetyl-Ser-Lys-Arg-MCA (III): FAB-MS, m/z 589 (M+H)+; RP-HPLC, Rt = 29.05 min (29% CH3CN). Amino acid analysis: Ser0.96(1), Lys1.09(1), Arg0.95(1). For acetyl-Arg-Glu-Lys-Arg-MCA (IV): FAB-MS, m/z 787 (M + H)+; RP-HPLC, Rt = 29.05 min (29% CH3CN). Amino acid analysis: Glu1.20(1), Lys1.03(1), Arg1.87(2). For acetyl-Arg-Lys-Lys-Arg-MCA (V): FAB-MS: m/z 786 (M + H)+. RP-HPLC: Rt = 30.95 min (31% CH3CN). Amino acid analysis: Lys2.40(2), Arg1.60(2). For acetyl-Arg-Pro-Lys-Arg-MCA (VI): FAB-MS, m/z 755 (M + H)+; RP-HPLC, Rt = 30.95 min (31% CH3CN). Amino acid analysis: Pro1.14(1), Lys1.17(1), Arg1.70(2). For acetyl-Arg-Phe-Ala-Arg-MCA (VII): FAB-MS, m/z 748 (M + H)+; RP-HPLC, Rt = 38.95 min (39% CH3CN).

Amino acid analysis: Ser0.97(1), Lys2.06(2), Arg0.97(1). For acetyl-Orn-Ser-Lys-Arg-MCA (IX): FAB-MS, m/z 703 (M + H)+; RP-HPLC, Rt = 31.75 min (32% CH3CN). Amino acid analysis: Ser1.00(1), (Orn + Lys)1.90(1), Arg1.10(1). For acetyl-Tyr-Glu-Lys-Glu-Arg-Ser-Lys-Arg-MCA (X): FAB-MS, m/z 1294 (M + H)+. RP-HPLC, Rt = 31.70 min (32% CH3CN). Amino acid analysis: Ser1.10(1), Glu2.35(2), Tyr0.50(1), Lys2.20(2), Arg1.95(2). This compound was prepared by condensing acetyl-Tyr(tBu)-Glu(tBu)-Lys(Boc)-Glu(tBu)-Arg(Pmc)-Ser(tBu)-Lys(Boc)-OH and NH2-Arg(Z2)-CH2Cl, which was obtained by treating Boc-Arg(Z2)CH2Cl (FAB-MS: m/z 575 (M + H)+) with 25% trifluoroacetic acid, dichloromethane for 30 min. The condensation was accomplished using the activating reagent TBTU as above described. After 50 min, TLC analysis revealed one major product with a RF(E): 0.44. Following precipitation with an ice-cold HCl aqueous solution (pH 3.0), the resulting precipitate was filtered and dried in vacuo. Purification through preparative TLC using solvent system E afforded compound XIa: acetyl-Tyr(tBu)-Glu(tBu)-Lys(Boc)-Glu(tBu)-Arg(Pmc)-Ser(tBu)-Lys(Boc)-Arg(Z2)-CH2Cl (FAB-MS: m/z 2129 (M + H)+. Following complete deprotection of compound XIa by HF, the desired product XI was finally purified by RP-HPLC, whereupon it eluted as a single peak with a Rt of 31.00 min and was characterized by amino acid analysis, Ser1.08(1), Glu2.35(2), Tyr0.50(1), Lys2.06(2), Arg1.14(2), and by ion-spray mass spectrometry, M+: 1169.74. Compound XI (0.88 μg) was iodinated using the lactoperoxidase method as reported previously(21Thorell J.I. Johansson B.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 251: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped after 60 s with 1 ml of aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) and the mixture applied to a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge that was washed sequentially with 20 ml of 1.0% (v/v) acetonitrile and then eluted with five fractions of 1 ml of 60% (v/v) acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The recovered material was purified by RP-HPLC as above mentioned. Only one iodinated form was observed, which eluted at 33% CH3CN and was stored in solution at −20°C until used. The specific activity was estimated at 2.69 fmol/200 cpm. Each fluorogenic substrate was kept as a 10 mM stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide at −20°C. For each assay, the substrate was incubated with proteinase sample in a total volume of 100 μl containing 50 mM sodium acetate (pH 6.0) and 5.0 mM CaCl2 for hPC1 (3.4 units) and 50 mM sodium acetate (pH 7.0) and 1.0 mM CaCl2 for hfurin (2.3 units). Incubations for the determination of kinetic constants were typically carried out in the presence of various concentrations (corrected for peptide content) of fluorogenic peptidyl substrates for 6 h at 25°C before stopping the reaction by addition of 50 μl of acetic acid. All assays were performed in duplicate, and the average value is given. The values of Km and Vmax were determined using a computer-assisted algorithm (Enzfitter; Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam). All fluorescence measurements were made with a Perkin-Elmer MPF-3L spectrofluorimeter using an excitation wavelength set at 370 nm and an emission wavelength set at 460 nm. In duplicate, hPC1 (1.3 units) was mixed with various concentrations (corrected for peptide content) of compound XI in a total volume of 100 μl of sodium acetate (pH 5.5) containing 5 mM CaCl2 and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The activity remaining was assayed by adding acetyl-Arg-Ser-Lys-Arg-MCA to a final concentration of 80 μM. Following incubation for 4 h at 25°C, the reaction was stopped by adding 50 μl of acetic acid, and the AMC released was determined fluorimetrically. Similarly, a set of experiments was accomplished for hfurin (3.3 units) using 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 7.0) and containing 1 mM CaCl2. Inactivation reactions of hPC1 were conducted at 25°C in 1.2 ml of 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.0), containing 5.0 mM in CaCl2. Inactivation reactions were initiated by adding hPC1 (30.4 units) to a solution of compound XI (30 nM). At various time points, from 2 to 90 min, 20 μl of the reaction mixture was removed and added to 80 μl of assay mixture containing 40 μM acetyl-Arg-Ser-Lys-Arg-MCA as substrate. The residual activity was determined after a 22-h incubation period. In order to monitor for time points of less than 2 min, inactivation reactions were made with 0.82 unit of hPC1 in a solution containing 1.5 nM compound XI, and the residual activity was determined after a 4 h incubation period. The same experiment was done in parallel without addition of compound XI to monitor the intrinsic stability of the enzyme in the conditions used. In order to investigate and define the primary structure requirements necessary for an efficient cleavage of the scissile peptide bond by the convertase PC1 and furin, we synthesized a number of peptidyl-MCA substrates and assayed their efficiency of cleavage with respect to the bimolecular rate constant kcat/Km. In doing so, we developed a new synthetic strategy for rapid and efficient preparation of peptidyl-MCAs (Fig. 1). The method used previously relied on the Zimmerman's procedure(22Zimmerman M. Ashe B. Yurewicz E.C. Patel G. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 70: 258-262Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar), which involved exclusively liquid-phase chemistry. That procedure was improved by including an automated solid-phase peptide synthesis step followed by direct coupling to a previously prepared amino acid-MCA moiety. This procedure allowed the preparation of the 10 peptidyl derivatives in a very short period of time and in very good yield. As shown in Tables I and II, both hPC1 and hfurin exhibited similar reactivity toward compounds II and XII, both of which contain the tetrapeptide motif found at the junction between the pro- and mature enzyme in the zymogen molecule, namely Arg-Ser-Lys-Arg for hPC1 and Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg for hfurin. However, when compared with compound II, the removal in compound III of the Arg residue in P4 resulted in a 101-fold decrease in kcat/Km for hPC1 and in an almost complete absence of cleavage by hfurin under the same conditions. Unexpectedly, comparison of compounds II and X revealed that kcat/Km decreased by a factor of 43 for hfurin as compared with only 2 for hPC1. Moreover, for hfurin, this significant reduction is mainly due to an effect on the kcat that decreased by a factor of 30 in contrast to the corresponding Km, which remains almost constant. Clearly, whereas a tetrapeptide containing P4 (Arg) is important for the efficient cleavage of a peptidyl substrate by either hPC1 and hfurin, elongation up to the P8 residue appears to modify significantly the overall efficiency of cleavage by furin but less so by PC1. The presence of a negatively charged glutamic acid in the P5 position could possibly be responsible for such an effect in the case of hfurin as discussed in the next paragraph. Comparison of compounds II and IV demonstrated that the introduction of a negative residue at the P3 position also results in a significant decrease in kcat when assayed in the presence of hfurin with an overall 138-fold decrease in kcat/Km. In contrast, a similar comparison for hPC1 revealed only a small decrease in kcat/Km. In general, our data on the effect of substitutions at the P3 position on the overall efficiency of cleavage indicate a greater sensitivity of hfurin as compared with hPC1 with kcat/Km ranging from 5.8 × 101 to 2.5 × 103 s−1M−1 for compounds IV, V, and VI compared with 1.6 × 103 to 1.9 × 103 s−1M−1, respectively. The importance of the P4 Arg residue is further substantiated by using a peptidyl substrate in which this position is occupied by a Lys (VIII) or an ornithine (Orn, IX) residue. Upon comparison with compound II, the net effect, as observed for hfurin, resulted, respectively, in a 538-fold and a 280-fold decrease in the relative ratio kcat/Km, whereas a comparatively much lower 14- and 18-fold decrease was observed for hPC1. Although poorly cleaved, the peptidyl substrate IX exhibiting a Km equal to 28 μM represents a better recognition motif for hfurin than the peptidyl substrate VIII, which exhibits a Km equal to 106 μM. Finally, we investigated the ability of hPC1 and hfurin to cleave at a single basic amino acid of the type Arg-Xaa-Xaa-Arg. Compound VII, of which structure is identical to the last four residues of the chicken proalbumin sequence, is 5.8 times more efficiently cleaved by hPC1 than by hfurin. However, as indicated in Table 1and Table 2, this single basic amino acid site is much less efficiently cleaved than, for example, compound II (55-fold less for hfurin and 4.8-fold less for hPC1). These results indicate that the decrease in the kcat/Km in relation to II is mainly through substrate discrimination in the ground state (Km) rather than in the transition state (kcat). Nevertheless, those results clearly demonstrate the capability of either furin and especially PC1 in recognizing and cleaving at a single basic amino acid in a peptidyl sequence contributing a P4 Arg residue. In order to develop an irreversible inhibitor of hPC1, we decided to synthesize a chloromethane-containing derivative based on the results obtained using the peptidyl-MCA derivatives. The compound X appeared to be a good candidate as it is cleaved quite efficiently (second best kcat/Km for hPC1, Table 1) and as it contains a tyrosine that can be used for labeling purpose. As shown in Fig. 2, the determination of the parameter Kapp/[I], indicative of the overall potency of an irreversible inhibitor, yields a value of 1.63 × 106 s−1M−1 which represents so far the most potent chloromethane derivative reported for hPC1. Used as an active site titrant as shown in Fig. 3A, the amount of enzymatically active hPC1 (648 pmol) thus estimated is in good agreement with the value obtained (529 pmol) using a radioimmunoassay with an NH2-terminal directed antibody against mPC1. Similarly, the titration of hfurin yielded an estimated value of enzymatically active enzyme in good agreement with the one calculated using the kcat value reported by Hatsuzawa et al.(23Hatsuzawa K. Nagahama M. Takahashi S. Takada K. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16094-16099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the pGlu-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-MCA fluorogenic substrate. Indeed, as shown in Table 2, a value of 5.7 ± 0.4 μM (Km) and 4.8 × 10-2 s−1 (kcat) are obtained for hfurin compared with the reported values of 5.8 μM and 1.15 × 10−1 s−1 for mfurin. The difference in the kcat value can either be explained by the species difference and/or by the different temperature at which the assays were performed. In fact, we observed a significant increase in the kcat value for both hPC1 and hfurin, when the assays are performed at 37°C instead of 25°C as reported herein (data not shown). Thus, even though the kcat of compound X, when compared with the kcat obtained with compound II, is lower for either hPC1 and for hfurin, an identical peptidyl sequence coupled to a chloromethane moiety results in the formation of a covalent enzyme-inhibitor complex. In fact, assuming that in certain experimental conditions the Kapp/[I] approaches k2/Ki(24Kitz R. Wilson I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3245-3249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the bimolecular rate constant of the overall inactivation reaction of hPC1 (k2/Ki) is 811-fold higher than the bimolecular reaction of the cleavage efficiency of the scissile peptide bond (kcat/Km). Since the mechanism for inactivation by peptidyl chloromethane involves formation and stabilization of a tetrahedral hemiketal (Michaelis complex), this step is essentially identical to what occurs during stabilization of the tetrahedral transition state upon substrate hydrolysis. However, as suggested by Powers (25Powers J.C. Weinsten B. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Amino Acids, Peptides and Proteins. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1977: 65-178Google Scholar) and further documented by Ringe et al.(26Kreutter K. Steimetz A.C.U. Liang T.C. Prorok M. Abeles R.H. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13792-13800Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the hemiketal oxyanion displaces chloride to give an epoxy intermediate, which is then attacked by the catalytic histidine at the less hindered carbon to regenerate the hemiketal. Therefore, the main difference between substrate hydrolysis and inactivation by a peptidyl chloromethane is related to the second step of the overall mechanism, namely (i) the deacylation step for the hemiketal complex or (ii) the His alkylation of the Ser-hemiketal adduct for the chloromethane derivative. Thus, the discrepancy observed for the bimolecular rate constant for compound X (kcat/Km: 2.01 × 103 s−1M−1) and XI (Kapp/[I]: 1.63 × 106 s−1M−1) as well as the burst kinetics observed for furin (27Bravo D.A.

In a previous report (Covarrubias, M., and Rubin, E.(1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 90, 6957-6960), we found that low concentrations of ethanol (17-170 mM) selectively inhibited a noninactivating cloned K+ channel encoded by Drosophila Shaw2. Here, we have conducted equilibrium dose-inhibition experiments, single channel recording, and mutagenesis in vitro to study the mechanism underlying the inhibition of Shaw2 K+ channels by a homologous series of n-alkanols (ethanol to 1-hexanol). The results showed that: (i) these alcohols inhibited Shaw2 whole-cell currents, the equilibrium dose-inhibition relations were hyperbolic, and competition experiments revealed the presence of a discrete site of action, possibly a hydrophobic pocket; (ii) this pocket may be part of the protein because n-alkanol sensitivity can be transferred to novel hybrid K+ channels composed of Shaw2 subunits and homologous ethanol-insensitive subunits; (iii) moreover, a hydrophobic point mutation within a cytoplasmic loop of an ethanol-insensitive K+ channel (human Kv3.4) was sufficient to allow significant inhibition by n-alkanols, with a dose-inhibition relation that closely resembled that of wild-type Shaw2 channels; and (iv) 1-butanol selectively inhibited long duration single channel openings in a manner consistent with a direct effect on channel gating. These results strongly suggest that a discrete site within the ion channel protein is the primary locus of alcohol and general anesthetic action. The molecular basis of general anesthetic action on membrane proteins that control ion transport is not yet understood. In a previous report (Covarrubias, M., and Rubin, E.(1993) Proc. Natl. Acad.

These results strongly suggest that a discrete site within the ion channel protein is the primary locus of alcohol and general anesthetic action. Aliphatic alcohols (n-alkanols) and volatile anesthetics are lipophilic agents that can affect the transport of ions across the cell membrane. Therefore, this is thought to be the basis for the biological actions of ethanol and other general anesthetics in the nervous system. According to the Meyer-Overton rule the ability of these agents to partition in lipid-like environments correlates with their general anesthetic potency in vivo(1Meyer H. Arch. Exp. Pathol. Pharmakol. 1901; 46: 338-346Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 2Franks N.P. Lieb W.R. Nature. 1994; 367: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar). Thus, the core of the lipid bilayer was an attractive locus of action (“lipid hypothesis”). This hypothesis predicted that membrane proteins, and especially those involved in ion transport, will be indirectly affected by lipophilic anesthetics as the result of a physical perturbation of the lipid bilayer(3Miller K.W.

However, a number of observations have challenged this hypothesis(2Franks N.P. Lieb W.R. Nature. 1994; 367: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar, 5Weight F.F. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1992; 33: 289-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar): (i) membrane disordering caused by anesthetic concentrations of n-alkanols can be mimicked by a temperature change of ≤ 1°C(2Franks N.P. Lieb W.R. Nature. 1994; 367: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar); (ii) certain enzymes are affected by n-alkanols and volatile anesthetics in the absence of phospholipids(6Franks N.P. Lieb W.R. Nature. 1984; 310: 599-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 7Moss G.W.J. Franks N.P. Lieb W.R. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Lieb W.R. Science. 1991; 254: 427-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar); and (iv) only a limited number of ion channels with diverse functional properties are affected by anesthetic concentrations of n-alkanols and/or other general anesthetics. Such targets include a subset of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels, namely γ-aminobutyric acid receptors and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors(2Franks N.P. Lieb W.R.

Evers A.S. Lingle C.J. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 2226-2240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and certain K+ channels(11Franks N.P. Lieb W.R. Science. 1991; 254: 427-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 14Covarrubias M. Rubin E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although many of these targets are similarly affected by n-alkanols and volatile anesthetics, some show differential sensitivity(16Franks N.P. Lieb W.R. Alcohol Alcohol. 1991; 1: 197-202Google Scholar), thereby suggesting additional specificity. To explain these observations an alternative hypothesis of general anesthesia and alcohol action proposes that lipophilic anesthetics may act directly on membrane proteins (“protein hypothesis”) through an interaction with relatively specific hydrophobic clefts or pockets(2Franks N.P. Lieb W.R. Nature. 1994; 367: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar). Proteins that are sensitive to these agents may have common structural motifs, which are located in or associated with a region of the molecule that is critical to its function. Low affinity bulk sites and high affinity discrete sites may actually coexist in the membrane, but only the latter would be relevant to the anesthetic effect. Low affinity sites could involve the core of the lipid bilayer, the protein-lipid interface, or putative membrane-spanning segments of the polypeptide. In absolute terms, however, the binding affinity of putative general anesthetic and n-alkanol binding sites seems to be in the high micromolar to millimolar range, which suggests weak and unconstrained interactions(4Dietrich R.A. Dunwiddie T.V. Harris R.A. Erwin V.G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1989; 41: 489-537PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the term high affinity is used here in a relative manner when compared with that of low affinity sites like those mentioned above. Although valuable studies have been made to demonstrate the protein hypothesis of alcohol and general anesthetic action(2Franks N.P. Lieb W.R.

Tonner P.H. Dearmendi A.J. Bugge B. Miller K.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 121-130PubMed Google Scholar) most of the evidence is still indirect, and the molecular bases remain unknown. In a previous study we found that a cloned K+ channel encoded by Drosophila Shaw2 is selectively inhibited by physiologically relevant levels of ethanol in a concentration-dependent manner(14Covarrubias M. Rubin E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6957-6960Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Such inhibition was found to be rapid, reversible, and voltage-independent. By contrast, 12 K+ channels homologous to Shaw2 (all members of the Shaker superfamily) required >200 mM to exhibit significant inhibition(14Covarrubias M. Rubin E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6957-6960Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 21Anantharam V. Bayley H. Wilson A. Treistman S.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 499-505Google Scholar). Since the same cell type (Xenopus oocytes) was used in these studies and, therefore, the membrane environment was constant, we proposed that the unique sensitivity of the Shaw2 K+ channel to ethanol was specified by its protein moiety. Compared to other members of the Shaker superfamily, Shaw2 K+ channels also bear unique biophysical properties(14Covarrubias M. Rubin E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6957-6960Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 22Wei A. Covarrubias M. Butler A. Baker K. Pak M.D. Salkoff L. Science. 1990; 248: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), such as lack of inactivation, activation with no apparent delay, low voltage sensitivity, and low open probability. Thus, they are unlikely to control spike repolarization (typically the role of delayed rectifier K+ channels) but may help to determine the passive electrical properties of the membrane. Native channels with functional properties analogous to those of Shaw2 have been recorded from nerve and muscle cells(23Solc C.K. Aldrich R.W. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 2556-2570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Zagotta W.N. Brainard M.S. Aldrich R.W. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 4765-4779Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Tsunoda S. Salkoff L. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1741-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying inhibition of Shaw2 K+ channels by ethanol and its relationship to the bases of general anesthetic action, we studied the interactions between wild-type and mutant channels with members of the homologous series of n-alkanols. These experiments demonstrate the presence of a discrete hydrophobic site of action probably located in the Shaw2 polypeptide. In addition, we show that channel inhibition results from a discrete effect on channel gating. Standard procedures were used to maintain, amplify, and isolate plasmid DNA(26Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1991: 1.0.3-1.8.6Google Scholar). For expression in Xenopus oocytes, Drosophila Shaw2 and hKv3.4 were maintained in pBluescript-MXT. This is a hybrid plasmid that includes the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of Xenopus β-globin flanking the multicloning cassette. hKv3.4 was provided by Dr. B. Rudy (New York University Medical Center). To introduce point mutations we used oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (Altered Sites (Promega)). In this procedure, a second mutagenic oligonucleotide confers antibiotic resistance, thereby allowing selection of putative mutant clones. Inserts to be mutated were subcloned in pALTER-1 (Promega). Mutant clones were confirmed by sequencing using a radioisotopic dideoxy method driven by Sequenase (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) or automated sequencing from Jefferson Cancer Institute (Thomas Jefferson University). Identified mutant inserts were isolated and ligated into the original plasmid vector. The hKv3.4-Shaw2 tandem dimer subunit was created by engineering a 7-amino acid linker (LDGSFAT) between glycine 560 at the C terminus of hKv3.4 and the first methionine at the N terminus of Shaw2. This causes a deletion of 23 amino acids at the C terminus of hKv3.4. DNA templates linearized at the 3′-end of the insert with an appropriate restriction endonuclease were used for the synthesis of run-off sense cRNA. In vitro transcription and 5′-capping of the cRNA was done using the MEGAscript (Ambion). Mature oocytes (Stage V or VI) were obtained and microinjected according to established procedures(27Goldin A.L. Sumikawa K. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 279-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Injected oocytes were kept at 19°C for a maximum of 7-10 days in ND96 (in mM: 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, pH 7.4, titrated with NaOH) supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin. This solution was changed daily. The two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique was used to record whole-oocyte currents. Microelectrodes are fabricated of borosilicate capillary tubing (Dagan) and have tip resistances on the order of 0.2-0.5 megaohms when filled with 3 M KCl and immersed in ND96. Voltage clamping was done using a TEV-200 amplifier (Dagan) following established procedures (28Stuehmer W. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 319-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Pulse protocols and data collection were controlled by a 486 computer equipped with Digidata 1200 acquisition hardware (Axon Instruments) and pCLAMP 5.5 or 6.0 (Axon Instruments). Whole-oocyte currents are generally filtered at 1-2 kHz and digitized at 0.125-1 ms/point. Oocytes were regularly perfused with ND96 using a gravity-driven perfusion system at 3-4 ml/min (chamber volume ≃ 250 μl). Drugs dissolved in ND96 were applied in the recording chamber at the indicated rate. Standard gigaseal patch clamp technique was used to record single channel currents(29Hamill O.P. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflueg. Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (14994) Google Scholar). An Axopatch 200 (Axon Instruments) interfaced with a 486 computer was used as indicated above. Patch clamp microelectrodes were fabricated from borosilicate glass (7052, AM-Systems) using a three-step horizontal puller (Sutter Instruments). To reduce background noise, tips were coated with Sylgard 184 silicone elastomer (Dow Corning). Tip resistances ranged between 2 and 5 megaohms. Before patch clamp recording, individual oocytes were prepared as described previously (28Stuehmer W. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 319-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) and immediately placed in a recording chamber containing ~250 μl of a high potassium bath solution (140 mM potassium aspartate, 10 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2 (titrated with KOH)). This solution clamped the oocyte membrane potential near zero mV, allowing a direct reading of the membrane potential across the patch when recording in the cell-attached configuration. Single channel currents were low pass filtered at 2.5 kHz (8-pole, −3 db cut-off frequency) and digitized at 50 μs/point. Pipette solution for cell-attached patch recording was ND96. Intracellular solution for inside-out patches contained 98 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 11 mM EGTA, and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2 (titrated with N-methyl-D-glucamine). All experiments were recorded at room temperature (21-23°C). Voltage clamp records were analyzed using commercial software (pCLAMP 6.0, Axon Instruments), and customized macro routines were written in a Quattro Pro environment (Borland). Leak current was subtracted assuming a linear leak. Capacitive currents were subtracted using smooth scaled templates that best described the capacitive transients. Nonlinear curve fitting of dose-response curves was conducted using Sigmaplot (Jandel). Single channel records were idealized in operator-controlled mode using a 50% amplitude criterion (FETCHAN, Axon Instruments) or a slope criterion (TRANSIT, A. Van Dongen, Duke University). The event list generated from idealized records was used to produce amplitude and interval duration histograms. Fitting of smooth functions to histograms was done using a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm or a maximum likelihood routine (PSTAT, Axon Instruments). All data were expressed as mean ± S.D. To investigate the presence of a saturable site for aliphatic alcohols, we examined the equilibrium dose-response relation for various members of the homologous series of n-alkanols (C2-C6). Shaw2 K+ channels were expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and whole-cell currents were recorded under voltage clamp conditions. Drugs were applied externally by bath perfusion, as described before(14Covarrubias M. Rubin E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6957-6960Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To ensure equilibrium the bath solution was exchanged with at least 10 volumes (3-4 ml/min), and current was measured as the average amplitude of three traces that did not show further inhibition. All n-alcohols caused inhibition of the whole-cell current (e.g.Fig. 1A). Dose-inhibition relations were hyperbolic, showing clear evidence of saturation especially with longer chain n-alcohols (Fig. 1, B and C). Data were thus analyzed assuming a Langmuir binding isotherm (see legend to Fig. 1). Results were well described by this function with Hill coefficients that ranged between 0.9 and 1.5 (Table 1), implying a one-to-one drug-receptor interaction. To further demonstrate the discrete nature of the binding site we conducted a competition experiment with ethanol and 1-hexanol. These alcohols differ in their apparent equilibrium constants (K½) by more than 2 orders of magnitude (Table 1). Oocytes were exposed to a fixed concentration of ethanol (170 mM) and increasing concentrations of 1-hexanol. As expected, in the absence of 1-hexanol ~50% of the current is inhibited by ethanol. At low concentrations of 1-hexanol, the action of both alcohols is partially additive, and as the concentration increases, the dose-inhibition relation approaches that of 1-hexanol alone. Thus, the alcohol with higher potency (C6) displaces the one with lower potency (C2). These data are well described by a binding isotherm that incorporates simple competition (see legend to Fig. 1). In fact, all parameters in the equation were constrained to values determined separately for ethanol and 1-hexanol (Table 1). Overall, these results are fully consistent with the presence of a discrete saturable site that mediates inhibition of Shaw2 K+ channels by n-alkanols. The thermodynamic binding parameters of the homologous series of n-alkanols can give information about the nature of the binding site. When K (on a log scale) is plotted as a function of the number of methylene groups in the alkyl chain (Fig. 2A), we find an inverse correlation between these variables (r= 0.99). This is to be expected if binding is a direct reflection of the ability of the anesthetic to partition into organic solvents (i.e. as predicted by the Meyer-Overton rule). The following relation was used to calculate the standard free energy of binding: ΔGB = RTlnK, where R is the gas constant and T is absolute temperature. Since we used unitary mole fraction units for this computation, ΔGB represents the transfer energy from the aqueous solution to the binding site(30Tanford C. The Hydrophobic Effect. Wiley-Interscience, New York1973Google Scholar). Accordingly, a plot of ΔGB against the number of methylene groups (Fig. 2B) shows that the change in binding energy per methylene group is −704 cal/mol (−2.9 kJ/mol or ~1.3 RT). This value is close to the standard free energy change per methylene group for the transfer of n-alkanols from water into alkanes(31Aveyard R. Mitchell R.W. Trans. Faraday Soc. 1969; 65: 2645-2653Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, the site of n-alkanol action in Shaw2 might be a hydrophobic pocket and, since no cut-off effect was detected up to 1-hexanol, this pocket can accommodate an alkyl chain of at least six methylene groups. Standard free energy values on the order of −3 kJ/mol have been estimated for the interaction of n-alkanols with voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels from squid axon (32Haydon D.A. Urban B.W. J. Physiol. 1983; 341: 411-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 33Haydon D.A. Urban B.W. J. Physiol. 1986; 373: 311-327Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and muscle nAchR channels(34Murrell R.D. Braun M.S. Haydon D.A. J. Physiol. 1991; 437: 431-448Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, compared to Shaw2, n-alkanols act on these channels with lower potency. To test whether Shaw2 subunits carry the sensitivity to n-alkanols, we made a tandem dimer subunit (Fig. 3A) composed of two distinct monomers, one ethanol-sensitive (Shaw2) and the other ethanol-insensitive (hKv3.4). hKv3.4 is a human homologue of Shaw2 (35Rudy B. Sen K. Vega-Saenz de Miera E.C. Lau D. Ried T. Ward D. J. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 29: 401-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) with an overall amino acid identity of ~50%. 1Mammalian Shaw homologues share ~50% amino acid identity within the core of the polypeptide (S1-S6). The closest homologue (rKv3.3) scores 52%, and hKv3.4 scores 51.5%. Both are members of the Shaw subfamily; therefore, they can coassemble to form a heteromultimer in Xenopus oocytes(36Covarrubias M. Wei A. Salkoff L. Neuron. 1991; 7: 763-773Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The tandem dimer construct is advantageous because the subunit stoichiometry of the hybrid channel can be constrained(37Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar, 38Heginbotham L. Mackinnon R. Neuron. 1992; 8: 483-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Since K+ channels are tetrameric proteins(37Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar, 39Mackinnon R. Nature. 1991; 350: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar), the novel hybrid channel has two subunits of each kind. Fig. 3B represents a possible configuration of a heterotetramer composed of two tandem dimers. Compared with the parent channels, the tandem dimer expressed currents that show intermediate kinetic properties (Fig. 3, C-E). This is probably mediated by a stretch of 28 amino acids at the N terminus of hKv3.4(40Covarrubias M. Wei A. Salkoff L. Vyas T.B. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1403-1412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Moreover, for both ethanol and 1-hexanol, the dose-inhibition relation was also intermediate and uniform (Fig. 4). Thus, the novel phenotype of the heterotetramer is determined by two hKv3.4 subunits conferring intermediate current kinetics and two Shaw2 subunits conferring intermediate n-alkanol sensitivity. As a corollary, we concluded that a Shaw2 subunit itself may carry the n-alkanol binding site. The macroscopic membrane current produced by an ensemble of channels is defined as IM = γ(V - Vr)NPo, where γ is the unitary conductance, V the membrane potential, Vr the reversal potential, N the number of active channels, and Po the open probability. Since n-alkanols mainly decrease the whole-cell current (IM), inhibition of one or more factors in that equation could explain such an effect. To investigate the mechanism underlying n-alcohol-dependent inhibition of Shaw2 currents, we conducted experiments to study the single channel properties of Shaw2 in the absence and presence of 1-butanol. These experiments were carried out using the cell-attached or inside-out configurations of the patch clamp technique. Drugs were applied either extracellularly (cell-attached) or directly to the cytoplasmic face of the patch (inside out). The method of application did not significantly affect the results (see below), probably because short chain alkanols equilibrate rapidly across the membrane(41Brahm J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1983; 81: 283-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Since Shaw2 currents do not inactivate (Fig. 3C), even during 10-s step depolarizations, single channel currents can be recorded under steady-state conditions at a constant depolarization (0 mV). Single channel openings are overall very brief and occur mostly in isolation (Fig. 5), indicating a low open probability. 1-Butanol (88 mM) exerted a conspicuous inhibition of the opening frequency and apparently reduced the mean open time. These effects were fully reversible upon washout. Unitary conductance and reversal potential were not significantly affected (Fig. 6A), but in the presence of 1-butanol the cumulative histogram of open times was clearly dominated by very brief open durations (Fig. 6B). Similar but less pronounced results were observed with 85 mM ethanol and 22 and 44 mM 1-butanol (data not shown). Using a nonparametric test (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) we found that this effect was significant at p ≤ 0.01(42Press W.H. Flannery B.P. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Numerical Recipes. Cambridge University Press, 1989: 473-475Google Scholar). To further investigate the effect of 1-butanol on channel gating, we analyzed logarithmic closed and open time distributions (43Sine S.M. Sigworth F.J. Biophys. J. 1987; 52: 1047-1054Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (631) Google Scholar) from cell-attached and inside out patches in the absence and presence of 22, 44, and 88 mM 1-butanol. Closed time histograms were well described by a single exponential (Fig. 7A) with a time constant that simply represents the mean interval between individual openings. Consistent with a reduced opening frequency, this time constant was longer in the presence of 1-butanol (Table 2). Control and experimental open time histograms were well described by the sum of two exponential components (Fig. 7B, Table 2), indicating the presence of two open states (brief duration and long duration). 1-Butanol significantly reduced the proportion of long duration openings, with little or no effect on the time constants (Table 2). This explains the apparent reduction in open time and the rapid rise of the cumulative open time histogram. Thus, 1-butanol seems to inhibit selectively a gating step that leads to long duration openings. Inhibition of the whole-cell Shaw2 current by n-alcohols is, therefore, mainly due to a reduction in Po. As a secondary effect, there is a distinct possibility that N is reduced too. However, this seems unlikely, since the height of the brief component of the open time distribution, which is proportional to the contribution of brief duration openings, was almost equal in all conditions. We therefore assumed a homogeneous class of channels with complex gating kinetics involving two open states and at least one closed state (see “Discussion”). Only the long duration open state is affected by n-alkanols. The core of a K+ channel subunit includes six putative membrane-spanning domains named S1 to S6 (Fig. 3A). Previous studies have suggested that the linker region located between transmembrane segments S4 and S5 plays an important role in controlling the gating of voltage-gated K+ channels(44McCormack K. Tanouye M.A. Iverson L.E. Lin J.W. Tamaswami M. McCormack T. Pampanelle J.T. Mathew M.K. Rudy B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1991; 88: 2931-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 45McCormack K. Lin L. Sigworth F.J. Biophys. J. 1993; 63: 1740-1748Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Since n-alkanols have a selective effect on gating of Shaw2 K+ channels, it is possible that the S4-S5 loop might contribute to the site of n-alkanol action. According to current molecular models of K+ channels, the S4-S5 loop is supposed to be cytoplasmic(46Durell S.R. Guy R. Biophys. J. 1992; 62: 238-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of several K+ channels revealed similarities and a striking difference within that region (Fig. 8). Isoleucine occupies position 319 in Shaw2 (ethanol-sensitive), whereas glycine occupies the equivalent position in all ethanol-insensitive K+ channels. Compared to glycine, isoleucine is a highly hydrophobic amino acid (47Froemmel C. J. Theor. Biol. 1984; 111: 247-260Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Also, relat"
https://openalex.org/W1608498559,"Multiple forms of carboxylesterase have been identified in rat liver, and five carboxylesterases (designated hydrolases A, B, C, S, and egasyn) have been cloned. Hydrolases A, B, C and egasyn all have a C-terminal consensus sequence (HXEL) for retaining proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, and these carboxylesterases are found in rat liver microsomes. In contrast, hydrolase S lacks this C-terminal consensus sequence and is presumed to be secreted. In order to test this hypothesis, a polyclonal antibody was raised against recombinant hydrolase S from cDNA-directed expression in Escherichia coli. In addition to hydrolases A, B, and C (57-59 kDa), this antibody recognized a 67-kDa protein in rat liver microsomes and a 71-kDa protein in rat serum. The 71-kDa protein detected in rat serum was also detected in the extracellular medium from primary cultures of rat hepatocytes. Non-denaturing gel electrophoresis with staining for esterase activity showed that a serum carboxylesterase comigrated with the 71-kDa protein. Immunoprecipitation of the 71-kDa enzyme from rat serum decreased esterase activity toward 1-naphthylacetate and para-nitrophenylacetate. The 71-kDa protein immunoprecipitated from rat serum had an N-terminal amino acid sequence identical to that predicted from the cDNA encoding hydrolase S, providing further evidence that hydrolase S is synthesized in and secreted by the liver. The levels of the 67-kDa protein in rat liver microsomes and the levels of the 71-kDa protein in rat serum were co-regulated. Deglycosylation of microsomes and serum converted the 67- and 71-kDa proteins to a 58-kDa peptide, which matches the molecular mass calculated from the cDNA for hydrolase S. These results suggest that the 67-kDa protein in liver microsomes is a precursor form of hydrolase S that undergoes further glycosylation before being secreted into serum. In rats, liver appears to be the only source of hydrolase S because no mRNA encoding hydrolase S could be detected in several extrahepatic tissues. Serum carboxylesterases have been found to play an important role in lipid metabolism and detoxication of organophosphates, therefore, the secretion of hydrolase S and the modulation of its expression by xenobiotics may have physiological as well as toxicological significance.

Carboxylesterases play an important role in the metabolism of endogenous lipids and foreign compounds, such as drugs and pesticides(1Leinweber F.J. Drug Metab.

In addition to hydrolyzing numerous chemicals, carboxylesterases can catalyze transesterification reactions, which accounts for the conversion of cocaine (a methyl ester) to ethylcocaine (the corresponding ethyl ester) in the presence of an alcohol(7Boyer C.S. Petersen D.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992; 206: 939-946Google Scholar). Carboxylesterases are abundant cellular components, and they appear to have certain structural roles, which may be important in cellular trafficking. For example, egasyn, a liver microsomal carboxylesterase identified in both rat and mouse, binds to β-glucuronidase via its active site, which results in sequestration of the protein within the endoplasmic reticulum(8Medda S. von-Deimling O. Swank R.T. Biochem. Genet. 1986; 24: 229-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 9Ovnic M. Swank R.T. Fletcher C. Zhen L. Novak E.K. Baumann H. Heintz N. Ganschow R.E. Genomics. 1991; 11: 956-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In rabbits, microsomal carboxylesterases have recently been shown to interact with and regulate the secretion of acute-phase-response proteins, such as C-reactive protein(10Macintyre S. Samols D. Dailey P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24496-24503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Multiple forms of carboxylesterase have been identified in rat liver microsomes by isoelectrofocusing or non-denaturing gel electrophoresis followed by staining for esterase activity(11Mentlein R. Heiland S. Heymann E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 200: 547-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 12Morgan E.W. Yan B. Greenway D. Petersen D.R. Parkinson A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 495-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Previous studies from this laboratory led to the purification and characterization of two carboxylesterases in rat liver microsomes(12Morgan E.W. Yan B. Greenway D. Petersen D.R. Parkinson A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 495-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 13Morgan E.W. Yan B. Greenway D. Parkinson A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 513-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These two carboxylesterases, designated hydrolases A and B, appear to be the only abundant enzymes in rat liver microsomes that rapidly hydrolyze para-nitrophenylacetate. High levels of hydrolase A are present in testis, whereas high levels of hydrolase B are present in kidney, as determined by enzyme kinetics and Western immunoblotting (12Morgan E.W. Yan B. Greenway D. Petersen D.R. Parkinson A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 495-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 13Morgan E.W. Yan B. Greenway D. Parkinson A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 513-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We have recently isolated three full-length cDNAs from libraries prepared from rat testis, kidney, and liver. These cDNAs apparently encode hydrolase A, B, and a third microsomal carboxylesterase designated hydrolase C(14Yan B. Yang D. Brady M. Parkinson A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 899-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 15Yan B. Yang D. Brady M. Parkinson A. J. Biol.

Our initial attempts to clone hydrolases A and B by immunoscreening a rat liver cDNA library with antibodies against the purified proteins invariably resulted in the isolation of a cDNA (partial sequence) encoding a carboxylesterase that is similar but not identical to those present in rat liver microsomes. Other investigators have isolated the same cDNA when screening rat liver cDNA libraries with antibodies against carboxylesterases purified from rat liver microsomes. Consequently, the cDNA isolated by Takagi et al.(17Takagi Y. Morohashi K. Kawabata S. Go M. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 104: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) with antibody against carboxylesterase E1 does not encode this microsomal carboxylesterase, just as the cDNA isolated by Long et al.(18Long R.M. Satoh H. Martin B.M. Kimura S. Gonzalez F.J. Pohl L.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 156: 866-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) does not encode the microsomal carboxylesterase they identified as a target for alkylation by halothane. 1Based on molecular weight, isoelectric point, NH2-terminal amino acid sequence and substrate specificity, carboxylesterase E1 appears to be identical to hydrolase A, which also appears to be the 59-kDa protein that becomes trifluoroacetylated by halothane (12, 13). These cDNAs encode the same protein, which is hereafter designated hydrolase S. Carboxylesterases are widely distributed throughout the body and are present in several subcellular organelles, but the highest concentration of carboxylesterases is found in liver microsomes(12Morgan E.W. Yan B. Greenway D. Petersen D.R. Parkinson A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 495-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), where they are loosely bound to the luminal surface of the endoplasmic reticulum. The retention of soluble proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum of yeast and animal cells is specified by the COOH-terminal consensus sequence, HXEL or KXEL(19Halban P.A. Irminger J.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 20Pelham H.R.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 483-486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Hydrolases A, B, and C all have the COOH-terminal HXEL consensus sequence and are found in rat liver microsomes(15Yan B. Yang D. Brady M. Parkinson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29688-29696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, hydrolase S lacks this COOH-terminal consensus sequence and is presumed to be secreted. It is believed that HXEL-containing proteins bind ERD2 (for endoplasmic reticulum retention) or related proteins in the cis-Golgi apparatus, which leads to retrograde transport of HXEL-containing proteins to the endoplasm reticulum(21Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R.B. Nature. 1990; 348: 162-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 22Wilson D.W. Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7465-7468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that retention or secretion of certain animal proteins is cell typedependent. For example, protein disulfide-isomerase is exclusively localized within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope in rat hepatocytes, whereas this protein is secreted by rat pancreatic cells(23Yoshmori T. Semba T. Takemoto H. Akagi S. Yamamoto A. Tashiro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15984-15990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Takemoto H. Yoshmori T. Yamamoto A. Miyata Y. Yahara I. Inoue K. Tashiro Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 296: 129-136Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Similarly, cDNA directed expression of thioredoxin and interleukin-1β in COS-7 cells results in the secretion of thioredoxin but not of interleukin-1β, although both proteins are secreted by monocytes (25Rubartelli A. Bajetto A. Allavena G. Wollman E. Sitia R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24161-24164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to examine the cellular trafficking of hydrolase S and to test the hypothesis that hydrolase S is a serum carboxylesterase synthesized in and secreted by rat liver. We describe the preparation of a high-affinity antibody against recombinant hydrolase S and demonstrate the presence of hydrolase S in rat serum (in vivo) and the secretion of hydrolase S by primary cultures of rat hepatocytes (in vitro). We also present evidence that hydrolase S exists in two forms: a 67-kDa protein, which is the nascent form in liver microsomes, and a 71-kDa protein, which is the mature form in serum. Both proteins are extensively glycosylated. In rats, the liver appears to be the only source of hydrolase S, inasmuch as no mRNA coding for hydrolase S or the 67-kDa protein could be detected in several extrahepatic tissues.

The first step of PCR amplification was conducted with external paired primers and 0.3 μg of recombinant phage DNA from the liver cDNA library. The second step was conducted with internal paired primers and 0.5 μl of the amplified mixture from the first step. The temperature profile was as follows: 94°C (1 min), 55°C (1 min), and 72°C (2 min) for a total of 25 cycles. The internal paired primers span a 1678-base pair region encoding the entire protein. The sense primer of the internal pair was attached to an EcoRI site, whereas the antisense primer was attached to an XbaI site, which is underlined. The internal primers are as follows: sense, 5′-TCA GAA TTC TGT TCT TCC GCC ATG TGG CTC-3′(88-108); antisense, 5′-GAC TCT AGA AGG CTG GCA GAG ACC CAT TTA-3′ (1747-1766). The external primers are as follows: sense, 5′-TTC ATC ACC ATG GTC TCC-3′ (53-70); antisense, 5′-TTT GCT CCT CTG GTA CTG-3′ (1767-1784). polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The PCR-amplified cDNA was digested with EcoRI and XbaI and separated electrophoretically on a 1.2% agarose gel. The cDNA was recovered with a Qiaex agarose gel extraction kit (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA), inserted into EcoRI-XbaI-digested pUC18 plasmid, and sequenced with a Sequenase 2.0 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) as described previously(14Yan B. Yang D. Brady M. Parkinson A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 899-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The production and purification of recombinant hydrolase S was carried out with a protein fusion and purification kit purchased from New England BioLabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA), essentially as described by the manufacturer. The cDNA encoding hydrolase S was removed from pUC18 plasmid and inserted into the pMAL expression vector downstream from the malE gene, which encodes maltose-binding protein, and was expressed in Escherichia coli. The resultant fusion protein (i.e. maltose-binding protein linked to hydrolase S via a factor Xa protease site) was purified by amylose affinity chromatography, and cleaved with factor Xa to release recombinant hydrolase S. Maltose-binding protein was removed on a second affinity column. The recombinant hydrolase S was recovered in the void volume and concentrated by ultrafiltration with a Diaflo PM-30 membrane (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA). Polyclonal antibodies against recombinant hydrolase S were raised in three male New Zealand White rabbits (Small Stock Industries, Pea Ridge, AK). For the first immunization, each rabbit was injected in the footpads with 150 μg of purified hydrolase S emulsified with an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant (Difco). The second immunization was conducted 2 weeks later, at which time the purified protein was emulsified in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Two weeks after the second immunization, the rabbits received weekly intravenous injections of purified hydrolase S (200 μg/rabbit) via the ear vein. Antibody titer was monitored by Ouchterlony double immunodiffusion, essentially as described by Morgan et al.(13Morgan E.W. Yan B. Greenway D. Parkinson A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 513-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and high titer antiserum was collected from the ear artery 7 days after the last boosting. The IgG fraction was purified from high titer antiserum by Protein A column chromatography with Protein A-agarose (Calbiochem) as described by the manufacturer. Hydrolases A and B were purified from rat liver microsomes, as described by Morgan et al.(12Morgan E.W. Yan B. Greenway D. Petersen D.R. Parkinson A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 495-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies against the purified proteins were raised in rabbits and were subjected to immunoabsorption chromatography to remove cross-reacting antibodies, as described by Morgan et al.(13Morgan E.W. Yan B. Greenway D. Parkinson A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 513-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). After immunoabsorption, the antibody against hydrolase A was specific for hydrolase A, whereas the antibody against hydrolase B recognized both hydrolase B and C, which are 96% identical in amino acid sequence(16Yan B. Yang D. Parkinson A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 317: 222-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Antibody against maltose-binding protein was purchased from New England BioLabs. Proteins were subjected to non-denaturing gel electrophoresis and stained for esterase activity as described by Morgan et al.(12Morgan E.W. Yan B. Greenway D. Petersen D.R. Parkinson A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 495-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. The stacking gel and separating gel contained 3.5 and 7.5% acrylamide, respectively, both at pH 9.0. Electrophoresis was carried out at a constant current of 10 mA for ~2 h and then 25 mA for ~4 h. After electrophoresis, proteins were stained for esterase activity as described previously(12Morgan E.W. Yan B. Greenway D. Petersen D.R. Parkinson A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 495-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), or they were transferred electrophoretically to Immobilon for immunostaining. In addition to hydrolases A, B, and C, the antibody against recombinant hydrolase S recognized a 67-kDa protein in rat liver microsomes and a 71-kDa protein in rat serum (see “Results”). It was presumed that the 67-kDa protein was the precursor form of the 71-kDa protein. To test this hypothesis, the co-regulation of these two proteins by xenobiotic treatment was examined. Mature Sprague-Dawley rats (five per group) were treated with known liver microsomal enzyme inducers as described previously(12Morgan E.W. Yan B. Greenway D. Petersen D.R. Parkinson A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 495-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 27Arlotto M.P. Sonderfan A. Klaassen C.D. Parkinson A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 3859-3866Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). All rats were housed in an American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care accredited facility and allowed free access to Purina Rodent Chow 5001 and water. Liver and trunk blood were collected 24 h after the last injection. Blood samples were allowed to clot at 4°C overnight. Serum was removed and centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 10 min to remove cellular debris, pooled, and stored at −80°C. Liver microsomes were prepared as described by Lu and Levin (28Lu A.Y.H. Levin W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 46: 1334-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and stored at −80°C as suspensions in 250 mM sucrose. The concentration of protein was determined with a commercially available kit (BCA Protein Assay, Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as standard, as described by the manufacturer. Hydrolase S was partially purified from rat serum by ammonium sulfate fractionation and anion-exchange chromatography. A saturated solution of ammonium sulfate (at room temperature) was added dropwise to 10 ml of rat serum to give a final concentration of 30% saturation. After stirring slowly for 30 min at 4°C, the sample was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. Additional saturated ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant fraction to give a final concentration of 60% saturation, and the sample was stirred and then centrifuged as above. The pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and dialyzed overnight at 4°C against 1 liter of buffer A (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.2 mM EDTA). The dialyzed sample was diluted with equal volume of buffer A and applied at 4°C to a Whatman DE52 anion-exchange column (2.5 × 20 cm), which had been conditioned previously with a reverse linear gradient of 400 ml of high salt buffer (buffer A containing 1 M NaCI) versus an equal volume of buffer A. After the sample was loaded, the column was washed with buffer A until no more protein was detected in the eluate at 280 nm. The column was eluted with a linear gradient of 200 ml of buffer A versus an equal volume of high salt buffer. Column fractions (1.5 ml) were screened by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with antibody against hydrolase S, and those fractions containing partially purified hydrolase S were pooled. The concentration of protein was estimated from the absorbance at 280 nm, based on an extinction coefficient of 1.3 for 1 mg/ml(12Morgan E.W. Yan B. Greenway D. Petersen D.R. Parkinson A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 495-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). A final concentration of 20% glycerol was added prior to storing the partially purified preparation of hydrolase S at −80°C. Hydrolase S was immunoprecipitated from the partially purified preparation with antibody against the recombinant protein coupled to Protein G-agarose. Protein G-agarose (50 μl) was washed three times with buffer B (10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, containing 150 mM NaCI) by centrifugation at 500 × g for 2 min/wash. After the last wash, the Protein G-agarose pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of buffer B containing either no antibody (negative control) or 0.15 mg/ml of antibody against hydrolase S or rat serum albumin (i.e. an irrelevant antibody). After a 4-h incubation at 4°C with gentle agitation, the antibody-Protein G complexes were washed three times as described above. Following the last wash, 100 μl of partially purified hydrolase S (about 500 μg of protein) and 400 μl of buffer B were added to each tube. After an overnight incubation at 4°C with gentle agitation, the samples were centrifuged at 3000 × g for 5 min at 4°C. The supernatant fractions were analyzed by Western immunoblotting with antibody against hydrolase S and assayed for enzymatic activity toward para-nitrophenylacetate and 1-naphthylacetate as described by Morgan et al.(12Morgan E.W. Yan B. Greenway D. Petersen D.R. Parkinson A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 495-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes were isolated from mature male Sprague-Dawley rats by the method of Seglen(29Seglen P.O. Methods Cell Biol. 1983; 29: 1767Google Scholar), as modified by Waxman et al.(30Waxman D.J. Morrissey J.J. Naik S. Jauregui H.O. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes (3 × 106 cells) were seeded on rigid (denatured) type 1 collagen (Vitrogen) in 6-cm Lux plastic tissue culture dishes (Nunc, Naperville, IL) in modified Chee's medium containing 100 nM insulin, as described by Waxman et al.(30Waxman D.J. Morrissey J.J. Naik S. Jauregui H.O. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Cells (in the serum-containing media) were allowed to attached for 3 h at 37°C in 95% relative humidity and 5% CO2, and were then overlaid with extracellular matrix (matrigel), as described by Sidhu et al.(31Sidhu J.S. Farin F.M. Omiecinski C.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The medium was then replaced with serum-free modified Chee's medium, which was changed once again on the second day. The cultures were incubated under the same conditions for 3 days. Culture medium was collected, centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 min to remove debris, and stored at −20°C until analyzed for the presence of hydrolase S by Western immunoblotting. Deglycosylation was conducted with endoglycosidases H and F (Boehringer Mannhein). Rat liver microsomes or rat serum was denatured in the presence of 100 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and 0.2% SDS at 95°C for 2 min(32Trimble R.B. Maley F. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 141: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). For endoglycosidase H, samples from liver microsomes (15 μg) or serum (16 μg) were incubated in 15 μl of 50 mM potassium acetate (pH 5.5) and 1.0 milliunits of enzyme. For endoglycosidase F, serum samples (16 or 4 μg) were incubated in 15 μl of the same buffer plus 20 mM EDTA, 0.6% Nonidet P-40, and 3.0 milliunits of enzymes. After a 20-h incubation at 37°C, the samples were analyzed by Western immunoblotting. Proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE according to the method of Laemmli(33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Western immunoblotting with antibodies against hydrolase A, B, or S was conducted as described by Morgan et al.(12Morgan E.W. Yan B. Greenway D. Petersen D.R. Parkinson A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 495-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Northern blotting with cDNA encoding hydrolase S was conducted as described previously(14Yan B. Yang D. Brady M. Parkinson A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 899-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Screening a rat cDNA library by two-step PCR yielded a 1678-base pair cDNA (including primer sequence) encoding the entire polypeptide of hydrolase S. This cDNA was cloned into pUC18, and three clones were sequenced. The sequence of this cDNA was identical to that of the partial cDNA reported by Long et al.(18Long R.M. Satoh H. Martin B.M. Kimura S. Gonzalez F.J. Pohl L.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 156: 866-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), with the exception of 10 nucleotide substitutions. It was also identical to the complete cDNA sequence reported by Takagi et al.(17Takagi Y. Morohashi K. Kawabata S. Go M. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 104: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), with the exception of six nucleotide substitutions. Four of the seven nucleotide substitutions resulted in alterations in the deduced amino acid sequence. As summarized in Table1, hydrolase S is 74-79% identical to hydrolases A, B, C, and egasyn at the nucleotide sequence level and 67-73% identical at the amino acid sequence level.TABLE I Open table in a new tab The cDNA encoding hydrolase S was subcloned into a pMAL expression vector downstream from the malE gene, which encodes maltose-binding protein, and was expressed in E. coli.

It functions in two major metabolic pathways including the tetrahydrofolate-dependent one-carbon cycle and the salvage pathway for methionine. Its dysfunction has several physiological ramifications and leads to the development of megaloblastic anemia. In addition, it is suspected to be involved in the pathogenesis of neural tube defects. An issue that is central in weighing therapeutic options for methionine synthase-related disorders is the extent to which the enzyme exists as apoenzyme in vivo and, thus, can be potentially responsive to vitamin B12 therapy. Despite the importance of this issue, the extent of holo- versus apoenzyme in mammalian tissue is controversial and unresolved. To address this question, we have developed a convenient anaerobic assay that employs titanium citrate to deliver low potential electron equivalents. The reductive activation of this enzyme is essential under in vitro assay conditions. We find that both the human placental and porcine liver methionine synthases exist predominantly in the holoenzyme form (90-100%) in the crude homogenate. In addition, the activity of the pure enzyme measured in the titanium citrate assay is also independent of exogenous cofactor, revealing that the cobalamin is tightly bound to the active site.

In addition, the activity of the pure enzyme measured in the titanium citrate assay is also independent of exogenous cofactor, revealing that the cobalamin is tightly bound to the active site. Methionine synthase (EC 2.1.1.13) is a cytoplasmic enzyme that straddles two major metabolic pathways. It remethylates homocysteine, a toxic catabolite of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) 1The abbreviations used are:AdoMetS-adenosylmethionineDTTdithiothreitiol. and, in so doing, recycles methionine. It also functions to free up the circulating form of folic acid, CH3-H4-folate, which is delivered from the blood stream to the cells, to a more generally usable form, H4-folate. Its activity is dependent on the cofactor, cobalamin, a derivative of vitamin B12. S-adenosylmethionine dithiothreitiol. Metabolic repercussions of methionine synthase dysfunction include depletion of AdoMet and methionine pools with concomitant elevation of homocysteine, a suspected cardiovascular risk factor ((1Clarke R. Daly L. Robinson K. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 324: 114-1155Crossref Scopus (1993) Google Scholar) and (2Green R. Jacobsen D.W. Folate in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, New York1995: 75-121Google Scholar) and references therein). It also lowers the folate pool because intracellular retention of CH3-H4-folate (present predominantly as the monoglutamate(3Cichowitz D.J. Shane B. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar)) is poor and because CH3-H4-folate is not a substrate for any other known enzyme. Thus, pleiotropic effects on both the sulfur- and one carbon-dependent cell cycles ensue. The clinical condition is characterized by megaloblastic anemia(4Allen R.H. Stabler S.P. Savage D.G. Lindenbaum J. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1344-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). An important unresolved and controversial issue concerning methionine synthase is how much of the enzyme in the cell is present as holoenzyme, i.e. has the cofactor bound to it. Resolution of the relative levels of holo- versus apoenzyme in the cell is complicated by the mixed oxidation states of cobalamin in the isolated methionine synthase and the need for a relatively low potential single electron donor to activate the protein. Thus, the estimates of the proportion of holoenzyme have been conflicting, ranging from 10% (5Utley C.S. Marcell P.D. Allen R.H. Antony A.C. Kolhouse J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13656-13665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kolhouse J.F. Utley C. Stabler S.P. Allen R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23010-23015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to 100%(7Taylor R.T. Hanna M.L. Hutton J.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 165: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Methionine synthase can be potentially isolated in four stable forms depicted as species I-IV in Fig. S1. Of these, three are variations of holoenzyme, in which the bound cobalamin is either in an “active form” (IV, CH3-cobalamin) or in an “inactive form” (II and III). The latter two species can be readmitted to the catalytic cycle in a reaction that is independent of added cobalamin but dependent on a reducing system and AdoMet. Recruitment of the apoenzyme form (I) to the catalytic cycle is dependent, in addition, on cobalamin. Several different assays have been employed to monitor methionine synthase activity and to estimate the proportion of holo- versus apoenzyme(5Utley C.S. Marcell P.D. Allen R.H. Antony A.C.

These include the use of either reduced flavins(5Utley C.S. Marcell P.D. Allen R.H. Antony A.C. Kolhouse J.F. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 27193-27197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Matthews R.G. Jencks D.A. Frasca V. Matthews K.D. Methionine Biosynthesis.

Biophys. 1971; 142: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Of these, only the assay utilizing reduced flavin as an electron source can provide an appropriate measure of the holo- and apoenzyme forms. It is, however, tedious and depends on the need for freshly prepared reduced flavins along with spectral monitoring to ensure complete reduction of the flavin. In the absence of these precautions, variable concentrations of reduced flavin are present in the assay mixture leading to an overestimation of the apoenzyme concentration. The problem with the standard assay that is routinely employed to monitor methionine synthase activity is that it relies on the supply of exogenous cobalamin (usually in the form of OH-cob(III)alamin) and a reductant such as dithiothreitol. Hydroxocobalamin potentially plays a dual role. It is required in delivering one-electron equivalent to forms II and III, and it can bind to the apoenzyme form (I), converting it to holoenzyme. Although the specific route of electron transfer is not understood, omission of OH-cobalamin from the assay short circuits the delivery of electron equivalents to the enzyme. This can lead to a gross underestimation of enzyme activity(12Chen Z. Crippen K. Gulati S. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27193-27197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is because (i) the fraction of holoenzyme containing OH-cobalamin (II) or cob(II)alamin (III) is excluded from the catalytic cycle, and (ii) active enzyme initially present as CH3-cob(III)alamin (IV) accumulates in an inactive form (III) due to oxidative escape of cob(I)alamin (I) from the turnover cycle without a functional avenue for reactivation. Hence, an accurate estimation of the proportion of holo- versus apoenzyme must rely on a system where single electron donation is afforded via a route other than exogenous cobalamin. In this study, we describe the development of an anaerobic assay that meets this criterion. This has led us to the surprising finding that the mammalian methionine synthases from both porcine liver and human placenta exist predominantly in the holoenzyme form. Moreover, the cofactor is tightly bound and is retained during multiple purification steps. The following materials were purchased from Sigma: AdoMet, OH-cobalamin, DTT, FMN, and FAD. Titanium chloride was purchased from Aldrich, and titanium citrate was prepared as described previously(14Zehnder A.J.B. Wuhrman K. Science. 1976; 194: 1165-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). (6R,6S)-5-[14C]CH3-H4-folate (barium salt, 55 mCi/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Corp. (6R,6S)-CH3-H4-folate (calcium salt) was obtained from Schircks' Laboratories (Switzerland). The polyclonal antibodies to porcine methionine synthase were generated in rabbits at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation in the laboratory of Dr. Donald Jacobsen. Porcine methionine synthase was purified as described previously(12Chen Z. Crippen K. Gulati S. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27193-27197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that OH-cobalamin was not added to the enzyme or buffers at any stage of the purification. Human methionine synthase was purified from a placenta obtained within minutes of delivery, cubed, and stored frozen at −80°C until the time of purification. The human enzyme was purified through the first four steps of the protocol described previously(12Chen Z. Crippen K. Gulati S. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27193-27197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay based on the method of Bradford (15Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (205570) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The assays were performed in 10-ml serum vials in which the atmosphere had been exchanged for a N2/H2 (19:1) mixture in a Coy anaerobic chamber. All stock reagent solutions were made anaerobic by bubbling nitrogen through them for at least 30 min and were stored in stoppered serum vials. This procedure was repeated periodically with solutions that were stored for long periods of time. The enzyme (placed in a stoppered serum vial on ice) was made anaerobic by gently passing nitrogen over the solution for 30 min. The reaction mixture contained the following: 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 500 μM homocysteine, 19 μM AdoMet, 2 mM titanium citrate or 25 mM DTT, 250 μM (6R,6S)-5-[14CH3]-H4-folate (~2000 dpm/nmol), and enzyme in a final volume of 1 ml. The reaction was run either in the presence or absence of OH-cobalamin (50 μM). The mixture lacking CH3-H4-folate was preincubated at 37°C for 5 min. The reaction was initiated with CH3-H4-folate, incubated for 10 min at 37°C, and terminated by heating at 98°C for 2 min. Beyond this point, the reaction vials were uncapped, and the solutions were handled aerobically. The assay mixture was cooled on ice and then passed through a 0.5 × 6 cm column of Dowex 1 X8 (chloride form). The column was washed with 2 ml of water, and the eluate from the sample loading and rinse was collected in a scintillation vial. A biodegradable scintillation fluid, Ecolite, (10 ml) was added to the aqueous sample and counted. All reported values are corrected for the counts observed in control assays run in parallel from which enzyme had been omitted. Solutions of FMN and FAD (2 mM each) in 5 ml of water containing platinum oxide (30 mg) were reduced by bubbling with hydrogen gas for 1.5 h. Complete reduction was indicated by the disappearance of the 450-nm UV-visible absorption band of the oxidized flavins. The assays were then conducted as described above with the exception that reduced flavin (0.1 mM) replaced DTT or titanium citrate and a stream of hydrogen was passed over the assay mixtures during the course of the reaction. The redox potentials of the DTT/OH-cobalamin and titanium citrate assays were estimated spectrophotometrically. Anaerobic solutions of the reagents were mixed in a sealed cuvette in which the atmosphere had been replaced with nitrogen. To estimate the potential of the DTT/OH-cobalamin assay, the following components were mixed: DTT (25 mM), OH-cobalamin (50 μM), benzylviologen (100 μM) in 1 ml of anaerobic 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. The samples were scanned between 350 and 700 nm. The concentration of the reduced benzylviolgen was estimated from the absorption at 555 nm, using an extinction coefficient of 10 mM-1 cm-1. To estimate the potential of the titanium citrate assay, titanium citrate (2 mM) and methyl viologen (100 μM) were mixed in 1 ml of anaerobic 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. The concentration of the reduced methyl viologen was estimated from the absorption at 604 nm, using an extinction coefficient of 13.6 mM-1 cm-1(16Mayhew S.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 85: 535-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). We have developed an anaerobic assay for methionine synthase that permits evaluation of the extent of apo- versus holoenzyme without some of the ambiguities of the previously published procedures. The assay provides reducing equivalents from titanium citrate to activate methionine synthase, thus bypassing the need for exogenous cobalamin in this role. Under these conditions, only the holoenzyme forms of methionine synthase (, II-IV) contribute to catalytic turnover. In the presence of titanium citrate and exogenous OH-cobalamin, both apoenzyme and holoenzyme forms (I-IV) participate in catalytic turnover. Thus, comparison of activities in the presence and absence of OH-cobalamin provides an estimate of the percentage of apoenzyme (I). To establish that titanium citrate does not adversely affect methionine synthase, the activity of the enzyme was compared in the presence of DTT/OH-cobalamin or titanium citrate, both under anaerobic conditions. As can be seen from Table 1, titanium citrate does not inhibit methionine synthase. In fact, enzyme activity estimated in the presence of titanium citrate is ~1.5-fold higher than that in the standard assay. This is presumably due to the lower reducing potential of titanium citrate versus the DTT/OH-cobalamin system. Our estimates of the ambient redox potential of the DTT/OH-cobalamin and titanium citrate assay mixtures are approximately −350 and −450 mV, 2The midpoint potential of the titanium(III) citrate/titanium(IV) citrate couple is pH-dependent and has been reported to be −480 mV at pH 7 (4). respectively, versus the standard hydrogen electrode. The reductive activation cycle renders the activity of methionine synthase responsive to the ambient redox potential. The mechanism of reductive activation is postulated to be a one-electron reduction of cob(II)alamin to cob(I)alamin that is rapidly trapped by an exergonic methylation reaction with AdoMet(17Fujii K. Huennekens F.M. Biochemical Aspects of Nutrition. Japan Scientific Societies, Tokyo, Japan1979: 173-183Google Scholar, 18Fujii K. Galivan J.H. Huennekens F.M. Arch. Biochem.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1129-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Alternative mechanisms involving a sulfur radical cation intermediate on AdoMet have also been suggested(13Matthews R.G. Jencks D.A. Frasca V. Matthews K.D. Methionine Biosynthesis. Walter de Gruyter & Co., New York1986: 697-707Google Scholar). Although the midpoint potential of cobalamin bound to a mammalian methionine synthase is unknown, it is likely to be comparable with that of the Escherichia coli enzyme at −526 mV(19Banerjee R.V. Harder S.R. Ragsdale S.W. Matthews R.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1129-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The lower ambient potential provided by titanium citrate provides a greater driving force for reduction. This would lead to more efficient return of oxidatively ruined enzyme to the catalytic cycle and result in higher enzyme activity.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The data presented in Table 1demonstrate that OH-cobalamin does not increase the activity of methionine synthase in either the cell extract or the purified state when the titanium citrate assay is employed. In contrast, when DTT is employed as a reductant under anaerobic conditions, a 4-fold diminution in the activity is observed in the absence of OH-cobalamin. These results indicate that the porcine methionine synthase exists predominantly in the holoenzyme form in the crude homogenate and that the enzyme retains its cofactor during the five purification steps. These results also demonstrate that the enzyme is isolated in several holoenzyme states. Apparently a fourth of the enzyme in both the crude and pure states has bound methylcobalamin and is thus active in catalysis even in the absence of a functional activation system. Under standard aerobic assay conditions, there is no detectable activity in the absence of OH-cobalamin (Table 2), presumably due to rapid and irreversible accumulation of enzyme in the inactive forms II and III. The data presented in Table 1and Table 2confirm the electron transfer role played by cobalamin in these assays. Thus, in the presence of thiols, exogenous cobalamins are required for reductive activation accounting for the observed 4-fold increase in activity. A similar role for cobalamin has been reported previously for the methylreductase system from Methanobacterium bryantii(20Whitman W.B. Wolfe R.S. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 164-172Crossref Google Scholar). Oxidation of thiols by corrinoids have been demonstrated in nonbiological systems previously(21Peel J.L. Biochem. J. 1963; 88: 296-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 22Jacobsen D.W. Pezackka E.H. Brown K.L. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1993; 50: 47-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Next, enzyme activity from several different porcine livers was measured to determine if holoenzyme levels vary in individual animals (Table 2). In every instance, 90-100% of the enzyme activity is observed in the absence of exogenous cofactor, indicating that the enzyme is predominantly holoenzyme. The activities of porcine enzyme from five independent preparations are presented in Table 2. We have extended this study to the human enzyme from placenta, which was previously purified and reported to be 10-40% apoenzyme(5Utley C.S. Marcell P.D. Allen R.H. Antony A.C. Kolhouse J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13656-13665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We purified the human enzyme ~2000-fold and have found that, like the porcine enzyme, it is present predominantly in the holoenzyme form (Table 2). In addition, Western analysis of the partially purified human enzyme with antibodies generated against the porcine protein, reveals a single cross-reacting band of identical molecular mass (~155 kDa) by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1). This is in contrast to an earlier report (5Utley C.S. Marcell P.D. Allen R.H. Antony A.C. Kolhouse J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13656-13665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the human placental enzyme is a heterotrimer with subunit molecular masses of 90, 45, and 35 kDa, respectively. The restricted availability of human tissue to us has limited the sample size in this study to a single placenta. However, the results from both Western analysis as well as enzyme activity assays support our conclusion that the human methionine synthase is comparable to the more extensively characterized porcine enzyme. Our results are consistent with an earlier study by Taylor and co-workers (7Taylor R.T. Hanna M.L. Hutton J.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 165: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) on methionine synthase activity in normal and megaloblastic bone marrows. In normal marrow cells, enzyme activity was not stimulated in the presence of exogenous cobalamin, indicating that 100% of the enzyme was present as holoenzyme. This was in contrast to marrow from patients with pernicious anemia characterized by very low serum B12, where only 13% of the methionine synthase was holoenzyme. There are at least two methods that have been widely employed to determine the relative proportions of holo- versus apomethionine synthase concentration. The first uses the inhibitor propylcobalamin, in the presence of thiols(9Taylor R. Weissbach H. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1509-1516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kerwar S.S. Spears C. McAuslan B. Weissbach H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 142: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The second uses reduced flavins as an electron source(6Kolhouse J.F. Utley C. Stabler S.P. Allen R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23010-23015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Loughlin R.E. Elfore H.L. Buchanan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2888-2895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Taylor R.T. Weissbach H. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1502-1508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the first assay, there is no direct avenue for reductive activation of the inactive holoenzyme. 3This assay employs thiols, and during long incubations it is possible that some of the propylcobalamin decomposes to OH-cobalamin, which would then mimic the standard assay. Thus, the amount of apoenzyme is overestimated. We have found that both FADH2 and FMNH2 are comparable with titanium citrate in their ability to activate methionine synthase (Table 3). In addition, the activity of the enzyme with reduced flavins is not increased by adding OH-cobalamin, indicating the predominance of holoenzyme. Although reduced flavins are efficient in reductive activation, these assays are cumbersome and susceptible to significant errors. The need to reduce the flavins by bubbling hydrogen over 1-2 h as well as the maintenance of anaerobiosis by passing a stream of hydrogen gas over the individual assay mixtures is tedious and limits the number of assays that can be readily performed. In addition, incomplete reduction of flavins prior to their use in the assays leads to variability in the results and an overestimation of the apoenzyme form. 4In the methods described in the literature, the flavins are reduced by bubbling with H2 for only 10 min. In our experience, this leads to incomplete reduction as judged by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy. The assay with reduced flavins have been used most recently by Kolhouse and co-workers (5, 6), but precautions were apparently not taken to maintain good anaerobiosis in the reaction mixture. Based on our results, this would lead to an overestimation of the apoenzyme form accounting for their low estimate of the holoenzyme (10-40%). It is thus critical to establish spectrophotometrically that reduction of the flavins is complete before they are employed in the assay. In contrast, titanium citrate is easily prepared and, if handled properly, has a long shelf life, and the assays are highly reproducible.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The kinetic studies described above indicate that methionine synthase is predominantly in the holoenzyme form. We have also examined the UV-visible spectrum of the enzyme purified in the absence of exogenous cobalamin. The enzyme was found to contain 1 mol of cobalamin/mol of enzyme using extinction coefficients for OH-cobalamin of 20.2 mM-1 cm-1 and 8.17 mM-1 cm-1 at 358 and 536 nm, respectively(23Giannotti C. Electronic Spectra of B and Related Systems. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1982: 394-430Google Scholar). 5Comparison of the specific activities of the partially purified (0.53 μmol of methionine/min/mg of protein) and completely purified (1.7 μmol of methionine/min/mg of protein) enzymes indicated that the enzyme used for spectroscopic analysis was 31% pure. The concentration of porcine methionine synthase in the sample was then calculated using a molecular mass of 155 kDa (12). The spectrum is identical to that reported previously for enzyme purified in the presence of OH-cobalamin (added to the buffers(12Chen Z. Crippen K. Gulati S. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27193-27197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Thus, like the bacterial enzyme, the mammalian methionine synthase also binds its cofactor tightly(24Frasca V. Banerjee R.V. Dunham W.R. Sands R.H. Matthews R.G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8458-8465Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have developed a convenient anaerobic assay for methionine synthase and have found that both the porcine liver and human placental enzymes are present predominantly in the holoenzyme form and that the cofactor is tightly bound. Methionine synthase plays a central role in cellular housekeeping as it straddles two major metabolic cycles. While recent clinical studies suggest a correlation between impaired methionine synthase and neural tube defects(25Czeizel A.E. Dudas I. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 327: 1832-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (2550) Google Scholar, 26Kirke P.N. Molloy A.M. Daly L.E. Burke H. Weir D.G. Scott J.M. Q. J.

As vitamin B12 therapies are considered in treatment of such disorders, it will be germane to evaluate the extent to which the enzyme is present as apoenzyme and could potentially thus be responsive to higher doses of the cofactor."

In this study, we demonstrate an association between the IGF-I receptor and p85, Syp, and GAP, but not with PLC-γ in lysates of cells overexpressing the human IGF-I receptor. We further investigated these interactions using glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins containing the amino-terminal SH2 domains of p85 or GAP, or both SH2 domains of Syp or PLC-γ to precipitate the IGF-I receptor from purified receptor preparations and from whole cell lysates. p85-, Syp-, and GAP-GSTs precipitated the IGF-I receptor, whereas the PLC-γ-GST did not. Using phosphopeptides corresponding to IGF-I receptor phosphorylation sites, we determined that the p85- and Syp-GST association with the IGF-I receptor could be inhibited by a carboxyl-terminal peptide containing pY1316 and that the GAP-GST association could be inhibited by a NPXY domain peptide. The GAP-GST binding site was confirmed by showing that a mutant IGF-I receptor with a deletion of the NPXY domain including tyrosine 950 was poorly precipitated by the GAP-GST.

GTPase-activating protein (GAP) is another SH2 domain protein involved in tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor signal transduction. GAP inactivates ras by stimulating the hydrolysis of GTP-ras, thereby functioning as a negative regulator of mitogenic signal transduction(30Polakis P. McCormick F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 268: 9157-9160Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). GAP associates directly with the activated insulin receptor (31Pronk G.J. Medema R.H. Burgering B.M.T. Clark R. McCormick F. Bos J.L.

Phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ) is another SH2 domain protein which is recruited directly to the activated epidermal and platelet-derived growth factor receptors and is an important mitogenic signaling molecule(32Meisenhelder J. Suh P.G. Rhee S.G. Hunter T. Cell. 1989; 57: 1109-1122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). No previous association between PLC-γ and the insulin or IGF-I receptors has been reported. In this study, we investigate the direct association of p85, Syp, GAP, and PLC-γ with the IGF-I receptor and map the sites of receptor interaction utilizing SH2 domain-containing fusion proteins and phosphopeptides modeled after phosphotyrosine-containing domains of the IGF-I receptor. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were transfected as described (33Hsu D. Knudson P.E. Zapf A. Rolband G.C. Olefsky J.M. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 744-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) with the expression vector, Rldn, containing the full-length human IGF-I receptor cDNA previously reported by Ullrich et al.(34Ullrich A. Gray A. Tam A.W. Yang-Feng T. Tsubokawa M. Collins C. Henzel W. Le Bon T. Kathuria S. Chen E. Jacobs S. Francke U. Ramachandran J. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2503-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar). The transfected cells were selected with 400 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.), and a clone expressing 1.5 × 105 receptors per cell, CHOWT, was used in these studies. A similarly transfected cell line overexpressing the human IGF-I receptor with a deletion of the NPXY domain (CHONPXY) was also used in some experiments(33Hsu D. Knudson P.E. Zapf A. Rolband G.C. Olefsky J.M. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 744-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Transfected CHO cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 from Life Technologies, Inc. supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Gemini Bioproducts, Calabasas, CA), 0.5% gentamicin (Gemini Bioproducts), 1% GlutaMAXTM (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 400 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Insulin, IGF-I, 125I-insulin, and 125I-IGF-I were generously provided by Eli Lilly. Electrophoresis equipment and reagents were from Bio-Rad. The antiphosphotyrosine, anti-p85, anti-Syp, and anti-PLC-γ antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), the anti-IGF-I receptor antibody was from Oncogene Science (Uniondale, NY), and the anti-GAP antiserum was from UBI (Lake Placid, NY). The goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase antibody and the enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents were from Amersham. Nitrocellulose was from Schleicher and Schuell. Immunoprecipitin was from Life Technologies, Inc., the Protein G- and Protein A-Sepharose were from Sigma, and the glutathione-Sepharose 4B was from Pharmacia Biotech. Phosphopeptides were from Quality Controlled Biochemicals (Hopkinton, MA) and were modeled after the amino acid sequences of specific IGF-I receptor tyrosine phosphorylation sites. These include the triple tyrosine kinase domain (pYpYpY), the NPXY domain (NPXpY and RPXpY), and the carboxyl-terminal tyrosine, pY1316. The sequences are: pYpYpY, DIpYETDpYpYRK; NPXpY, ASVNPEpYFSA; RPXpY, ASVRPEpYFSA; and pY1316, ASFDERQPpYAHMNGG. The peptide NPXpY was not used because repeat high performance liquid chromatography analysis of this peptide produced two peaks indicating conformational changes in the peptide which we believe prevented consistent phosphotyrosine binding. The molecular cloning of the SH2 domain proteins used in this study is described elsewhere(35Zhu G. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9559-9563Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The p85 fusion protein used contained residues 321 to 440 from p85, including the amino-terminal SH2 domain. The Syp-GST contained residues 1 to 216 of Syp, including both SH2 domains. The GAP-GST contained amino acids 177 to 278 of GAP, including the amino-terminal SH2 domain, and the PLC-γ-GST included residues 550 to 756 of PLC-γ, including the amino- and carboxyl-terminal SH2 domains. The expression and purification of fusion proteins has been described previously(18Staubs P.A. Reichart D.R. Saltiel A.R. Milarski K.L. Maegawa H. Berhanu P. Olefsky J.M. Seely B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27186-27192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5046) Google Scholar). IGF-I receptors were purified from CHOWT cells by wheat germ agglutinin affinity chromatography, and 125I-IGF-I binding studies were performed as described previously(37McClain D.A. Maegawa H. Lee J. Dull T.J. Ulrich A. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14663-14671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 500 fmol of partially purified IGF-I receptors were incubated with 10 μl of kinase buffer (10 mM HEPES, 0.05% Triton X-100, pH 7.4 at 4°C), 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, and 100 ng/ml IGF-I for 30 min at 4°C. 20 μl of an activating mixture (50 μM ATP, 10 mM MnCl2 in kinase buffer) was then added at room temperature, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min before it was terminated with 20 μl of lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mM EDTA, 150 mM sodium chloride, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol, 4 mM sodium vanadate, 200 mM sodium fluoride, and 20 mM sodium pyrophosphate, pH 7.4 at 4°C). 50 μl of a 50% suspension of prewashed glutathione-Sepharose in lysis buffer plus increasing concentrations of the fusion proteins were added. Where indicated, phosphopeptides were also added at this time. The samples were rotated for 90 min at 4°C. After spinning, the supernatants were collected, and the Sepharose was washed twice with lysis buffer. The samples were boiled in solubilizing fluid (6% SDS, 2 mM EDTA, 20% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 125 mM Tris, 0.01% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8) and fractionated by gel electrophoresis. After transfer to nitrocellulose, blots were developed with a monoclonal antiphosphotyrosine antibody using the enhanced chemiluminescence system. Where indicated, whole cell lysates were used instead of purified receptors. After overnight starvation in serum-free Ham's F-12 media, whole cell monolayers were stimulated with IGF-I, 100 ng/ml, for 1 min at 37°C. Pretreatment with phenylarsine oxide (PAO) was performed where indicated by preincubating the cells with 25 μM PAO for 5 min at 37°C. After stimulation with IGF-I for 1 min at 37°C, the media were removed, and 400 μl of lysis buffer was added. 100 μl of the cell lysate was then incubated with the fusion protein of interest and glutathione-Sepharose as described above. The IGF-I receptor was immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysates with a monoclonal anti-IGF-I receptor antibody at a dilution of 1:100. After an overnight incubation, the antibody complex was collected with Protein G-Sepharose. IRS-1 immunoprecipitation was performed with a monoclonal antibody (38Ohmichi M. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21601-21606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at a dilution of 1:100 and was precipitated with prewashed Immunoprecipitin after an overnight incubation at 4°C. The anti-GAP immunoblot was performed using an anti-GAP antiserum at a concentration of 1:1000, the anti-Syp, anti-p85, and anti-PLC-γ immunoblots were performed at 1:250, and antiphosphotyrosine immunoblots at 1:2000. Phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation was performed with the antiphosphotyrosine antibody at a dilution of 1:200. Following a 4-h incubation at 4°C, antibody complexes were collected with Protein G-Sepharose. Fig. 1A demonstrates the different proteins which are tyrosine-phosphorylated in CHOWT in response to IGF-I stimulation. Predominant phosphoprotein bands in IGF-I-stimulated cells are seen at 185 kDa, 120 kDa, and 105 kDa. Immunoprecipitation experiments identified the 185-kDa band as IRS-1 (Fig. 1B) and the 105-kDa band as the IGF-I receptor (Fig. 1C). Although GAP was identified in the total whole cell lysates by an anti-GAP immunoblot (Fig. 1D, lane 1), GAP was not detected in immunoprecipitates using an antiphosphotyrosine antibody (lanes 2 and 3). Even after prolonged exposure, GAP was not seen in the antiphosphotyrosine antibody precipitates. GAP is, therefore, present in the whole cell lysates (lane 1), but is not the tyrosine-phosphorylated protein seen at 120 kDa (lane 5). This protein is tyrosine-phosphorylated both in the stimulated and in the unstimulated cells, and its identity is not known. Fig. 2 shows precipitation experiments performed to demonstrate an interaction between the IGF-I receptor and various signaling molecules in whole cell lysates. In Fig. 2, whole cell monolayers of CHOWT were stimulated with IGF-I for five minutes at 37°C. Lysates were then precipitated overnight with an anti-IGF-I receptor antibody, and antibody complexes were collected with Protein G-Sepharose. Immunoblotting was performed with either a polyclonal anti-p85 antibody, a monoclonal anti-Syp antibody, an anti-GAP antiserum, or a monoclonal PLC-γ antibody. The two isoforms of p85 can be seen in lane 1, the 74-kDa Syp protein can be seen in lane 2, and GAP (lane 3) was precipitated by the IGF-I receptor antibody when the whole cell monolayers were pretreated with phenylarsine oxide. The use of this protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor was suggested by work on the insulin receptor previously reported by Pronk et al.(31Pronk G.J. Medema R.H. Burgering B.M.T. Clark R. McCormick F. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24058-24063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite prolonged exposure, PLC-γ was not detected in the IGF-I receptor antibody precipitates (lane 4). These data indicate that p85, Syp, and GAP, but not PLC-γ, are precipitated along with the IGF-I receptor. It is not clear whether these proteins are associating directly with the IGF-I receptor or indirectly with other proteins which interact with the IGF-I receptor such as IRS-1. To further explore the possibility of direct IGF-I receptor-SH2 domain protein interactions, we studied the ability of SH2 domain-GST fusion proteins to interact directly with the IGF-I receptor. Increasing concentrations of GST fusion proteins containing either the amino-terminal SH2 domain of p85, both SH2 domains of Syp, the amino-terminal SH2 domain of GAP, or both SH2 domains of PLC-γ were incubated with IGF-I-stimulated CHOWT whole cell lysates and glutathione-Sepharose. In each experiment, negligible amounts of receptor precipitated in the presence of the glutathione-Sepharose alone (lane 1, Fig. 3, A-D). The p85-GST was able to precipitate IRS-1, p120, and the IGF-I receptor from whole cell lysates (Fig. 3A). Similar results were achieved when the Syp-GST was used in place of p85 (Fig. 3B). The identity of the p120 precipitated by the p85- and the Syp-GST is unknown. A p120 was also precipitated by the Syp-GST from NIH 3T3 cells transfected with and overexpressing the human insulin receptor and a dominant-negative mutant Syp rendered catalytically inactive by a cysteine to serine point mutation(25Milarski K.L. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21239-21243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IRS-1 was precipitated by both the p85- and the Syp-GST at a lower concentration than was the IGF-I receptor, indicating that these fusion proteins may have a higher affinity for IRS-1 than for the IGF-I receptor. The IGF-I receptor was not precipitated by the GAP-GST or by the PLC-γ-GST (Fig. 3, C and D). No phosphorylated proteins were precipitated by the PLC-γ-GST (Fig. 3D), but the GAP-GST was able to precipitate a 120-kDa, an 80-kDa, and a 62-kDa phosphoprotein from whole cell lysates. A very low molecular mass protein can be seen in the last two lanes of the Syp- and the PLC-γ-GST immunoblots. This band is the molecular mass of the added fusion proteins. It may represent either the tyrosine phosphorylation of the fusion proteins or nonspecific binding by the secondary horseradish peroxidase antibody used in the detection assay. Similar experiments were performed using IGF-I-stimulated wheat germ agglutinin purified receptors from CHOWT. These preparations do not contain IRS-1, therefore, allowing us to test whether IRS-1 is a necessary intermediate in the association of the IGF-I receptor with the p85- and Syp-GSTs. Fig. 4, A and B, clearly show that the p85- and the Syp-GSTs are both able to precipitate the IGF-I receptor in the absence of IRS-1. These data indicate that p85 and Syp can interact directly with the IGF-I receptor. In contrast to the results obtained from the cell lysate experiments, the GAP-GST precipitated the IGF-I receptor from the purified receptor preparations (Fig. 4C). The PLC-γ-GST did not precipitate any phosphoproteins (Fig. 4D), although this fusion protein does precipitate activated nerve growth factor and the epidermal growth factor receptor (38Ohmichi M. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21601-21606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was of interest that the GAP-GST did not precipitate IGF-I receptors from whole cell lysates, but did precipitate purified IGF-I receptors. We preincubated cell monolayers with PAO, a phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, prior to and during IGF-I stimulation in an attempt to potentiate IGF-I receptor phosphorylation to enhance potential interactions between the GAP-GST and the IGF-I receptor in cell lysates. Under these conditions, the IGF-I receptor is precipitated by the GAP-GST. There is also a marked increase in the phosphoprotein bands visualized at 120, 80, and 62 kDa (Fig. 5A, lanes 3 and 4). The identities of these proteins are not known. No phosphoproteins are precipitated by the PLC-γ-GST despite preincubation with PAO (Fig. 5A, lanes 5 and 6). To determine if some of the increase in the phosphorylated protein band at 120 kDa was from tyrosine phosphorylation of GAP, whole cell monolayers of CHOWT were preincubated with PAO, then immunoprecipitated with the antiphosphotyrosine antibody and immunoblotted with an anti-GAP antiserum. Fig. 1D demonstrates that GAP is not tyrosine-phosphorylated in whole cell lysates. However, after PAO preincubation, tyrosine phosphorylation of GAP can be clearly detected (Fig. 5B, lanes 1 and 2). In fact, after 60 min of IGF-I stimulation in the presence of PAO, >90% of the total cellular GAP protein is precipitated by the antiphosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 5B, lanes 2 and 4). GAP can, therefore, become tyrosine-phosphorylated in IGF-I-stimulated whole cells pretreated with PAO. The data presented above suggest a direct association between p85, Syp, and GAP fusion proteins and the IGF-I receptor. We next conducted a series of experiments to localize the specific SH2 domain binding sites on the receptor. We accomplished this by examining the ability of three tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides to compete with the IGF-I receptor for binding to each GST fusion protein. The phosphopeptides were modeled after three regions of the IGF-I receptor with important autophosphorylation sites. These include the triple tyrosine region of the kinase domain(39Kato H. Faria T.N. Stannard B. Roberts C.T. LeRoith D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 40-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), the NPXY domain(33Hsu D. Knudson P.E. Zapf A. Rolband G.C. Olefsky J.M. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 744-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and the carboxyl-terminal region including tyrosine 1316(40Faria T.N. Blakesley V.A. Kato H. Stannard B. LeRoith D. Roberts C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13922-13928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The triple tyrosine peptide is modeled after amino acids 1129 to 1138 in the IGF-I receptor tyrosine kinase domain and includes the three tyrosines important in receptor autophosphorylation. The NPXY peptide was patterned after amino acids 944 to 953 from the IGF-I receptor's transmembrane region. Because this phosphopeptide did not maintain a stable conformation, the similar RPXpY peptide was used in its place. pY1316 is derived from the carboxyl terminus of the IGF-I receptor and includes amino acids 1308 to 1322. Fig. 6A shows that p85-GST binding to the IGF-I receptor is inhibited by increasing concentrations of the pY1316. No receptor is precipitated by the p85-GST in the presence of 750 μM pY1316 (Fig. 6A, lane 6). In contrast, neither the triple tyrosine peptide nor the NPXY peptide was able to inhibit the p85-GST•IGF-I receptor interaction at a concentration of up to 500 μM. Similar experiments were performed with the Syp fusion protein. IGF-I receptor precipitation was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by pY1316 with significant inhibition seen at a concentration of 50 μM (Fig. 7A, lanes 1-3). In contrast, up to 500 μM concentrations of the triple tyrosine phosphopeptide (Fig. 7B, lanes 2-4) or of the RPXpY peptide (lanes 5-7) did not inhibit IGF-I receptor precipitation by the Syp-GST. Taken together, Figure 6:, Figure 7: indicate that both p85 and Syp associate with the phosphorylated IGF-I receptor at tyrosine 1316. Fig. 8A demonstrates that the GAP-GST•IGF-I receptor interaction can be inhibited by increasing concentrations of the RPXpY phosphopeptide (lanes 8-10). In contrast, no inhibition was seen with the triple tyrosine or the carboxyl-terminal phosphopeptides (lanes 1-7). To confirm this finding, a cell line overexpressing mutant IGF-I receptors with deletion of the NPXY sequence motif (residues 947 to 950) was used(33Hsu D. Knudson P.E. Zapf A. Rolband G.C. Olefsky J.M. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 744-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Fig. 8B (lanes 4 and 5) demonstrates that this mutant receptor is readily precipitated by the p85-GST at both 0.1 and 1.0 μM. In contrast, no mutant receptor is precipitated at a 0.1 μM concentration of the GAP-GST, and only a small amount of receptor is precipitated at 1.0 μM GAP-GST. As seen earlier in Fig. 4, the p85 and GAP-GST proteins are relatively equivalent in their abilities to precipitate the wild-type IGF-I receptor. IRS-1 is known to be important in insulin and IGF-I receptor signal transduction. However, recent work in transgenic IRS-1 knockout mice has suggested the existence of IRS-1-independent, alternate signaling pathways(15Tamemoto H. Kadowaki T. Tobe K. Yagi T. Sakura H. Hayakawa T. Terauchi Y. Ueki K. Kaburagi Y. Satoh S. Sekihara H. Yoshioka S. Horikoshi H. Faruta Y. Ikawa Y. Kasuga M. Yazaki Y. Aizawa S.

Nature. 1994; 372: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). In this report, we provide evidence to suggest a direct interaction between p85, Syp, and GAP and the IGF-I receptor. We have also localized the probable sites of SH2 domain binding to the IGF-I receptor utilizing phosphopeptides derived from important autophosphorylation sites on the IGF-I receptor. A monoclonal anti-IGF-I receptor antibody was able to precipitate p85 from IGF-I-stimulated whole cell lysates prepared from a monolayer of CHOWT. Although it cannot be definitively proven in these experiments, this most likely represents a direct and independent interaction between p85 and the IGF-I receptor, rather than an interaction between p85 and IRS-1 in a binary IGF-I receptor•IRS-1 complex. Although the nature of the IGF-I receptor•IRS-1 interaction is poorly defined, it is quite evanescent. IRS-1 does not co-precipitate with the IGF-I receptor when an IGF-I receptor antibody is used(41Piccione E. Case R.D. Domchek S.M. Hu P. Chaudhuri M. Backer J.M. Kahn C.R. White M.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 32: 3197-3202Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar), nor does the IGF-I receptor co-precipitate with IRS-1 when an IRS-1 antibody is used(8Myers M.G. Sun X.J. Cheatham B. Jachna B.R. Glasheen E.M. Backer J.M. White M.F. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1421-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The inability to detect IGF-I receptor•IRS-1 complexes in this fashion makes it unlikely, but not impossible, that the presence of p85 in the anti-IGF-I receptor precipitate results from an IGF-I receptor•IRS-1•p85 interaction. We interpret these data to suggest a direct interaction between p85 and the IGF-I receptor. Backer et al.(42Backer J.M. Myers M.G. Sun X.J. Chin D.J. Shoelson S.E. Miralpeix M. White M.F. J. Biol.

However, transgenic mice with a knockout mutation of the IRS-1 gene are not diabetic despite their inability to signal through IRS-1, suggesting alternate pathways to PI 3-kinase activation including a direct receptor•p85 interaction(15Tamemoto H. Kadowaki T. Tobe K. Yagi T. Sakura H. Hayakawa T. Terauchi Y. Ueki K. Kaburagi Y. Satoh S. Sekihara H. Yoshioka S. Horikoshi H. Faruta Y. Ikawa Y. Kasuga M. Yazaki Y. Aizawa S.

PI 3-kinase activity can associate with immobilized IGF-I receptors and can be competed away with increasing concentrations of a p85 fusion protein(19Yamamoto K. Altschuler D. Wood E. Horlick K.

We have previously reported that the p85-GST containing the amino-terminal SH2 domain of p85 can bind to the carboxyl terminus of the insulin receptor at the binding motif pY1322THM(18Staubs P.A. Reichart D.R. Saltiel A.R. Milarski K.L. Maegawa H. Berhanu P. Olefsky J.M. Seely B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27186-27192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the direct binding of the p85-GST to the IGF-I receptor and localize a binding site to a similar binding motif, pY1316AHM, in the carboxyl terminus. We cannot exclude the possibility that IGF-I receptor phosphotyrosines other than those we studied here may participate in p85 binding. Although IRS-1 and the IGF-I receptor can both associate with p85 after IGF-I stimulation, the relative contribution of each interaction to biological signaling remains unknown. Syp is an SH2-containing tyrosine phosphatase which binds preferentially to phosphotyrosines in a pY-hydrophobic-X-hydrophobic motif(26Sun X.J. Crimmins D.L. Myers Jr., M.G. Miralpeix M. White M.F.

We describe here that an anti-IGF-I receptor antibody can precipitate Syp. As described above for p85, we believe this suggests a direct Syp•IGF-I receptor interaction rather than an IGF-I receptor•IRS-1•Syp interaction because of the evanescent nature of the IGF-I receptor•IRS-1 association. Furthermore, we have also shown in vitro that a Syp-GST may bind directly to the IGF-I receptor at phosphotyrosine 1316 in a pYAHM binding sequence. We have not excluded the possibility that other receptor phosphotyrosyl residues not studied may be involved in Syp binding as well. Recent studies examining the crystal structures of amino-terminal SH2 domain of Syp in separate complexes with two high affinity peptides demonstrate the importance of a hydrophobic residue in the +5 position (50Lee C.-H. Kominos D. Jacques S. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Shoelson S.E. Kuriyan J. Structure. 1994; 2: 423-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The IGF-I receptor has a hydrophobic amino acid, glycine, in the +5 position from tyrosine 1316. The biological relevance of the Syp•IGF-I receptor versus the Syp•IRS-1 interaction has not been defined, but microinjection studies have implicated Syp as a positive regulator of insulin- and IGF-I-induced mitogenesis(24Xiao S. Rose D.W. Sasaoka T. Maegawa H. Burke T.R. Roller P.P. Shoelson S.E. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21244-21248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Milarski K.L. Saltiel A.R. J.

GAP is shown here to associate with IGF-I receptors precipitated from whole cell lysates prepared from monolayers of CHOWT pretreated with phenylarsine oxide. A GAP-GST can associate with purified IGF-I receptors in vitro and with IGF-I receptors from whole cell lysates pretreated with phenylarsine oxide. Using phosphopeptides, we have determined that the SH2 domain of the GAP-GST interacts with the IGF-I receptor at tyrosine 950. The motif consists of a sequence with a hydrophobic amino acid in the +1 and +3 positions and is consistent with GAP binding sites previously described for the platelet-derived growth factor (28Sugimoto S.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27186-27192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is surprising that GAP could be precipitated along with the IGF-I receptor only from cells pretreated with phenylarsine oxide. A possible explanation for this result is that the degree of phosphorylation achieved after pretreatment with this protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor is greater than in its absence. Insulin receptors in a cell-free system, for example, phosphorylate to a greater extent than do receptors in whole cells(52White M.F. Takayama S. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9470-9478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 53Tornqvist H.E. Gunsalus J.R. Nemenoff R.A. Frackelton A.R. Pierce M.W. Avruch J. J. Biol.

We believe we were able to increase the overall tyrosine phosphorylation of the IGF-I receptors in whole cells by pretreatment with a phosphatase inhibitor, thereby allowing detection of the IGF-I receptor•GAP association. Pronk et al.(31Pronk G.J. Medema R.H. Burgering B.M.T. Clark R. McCormick F. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24058-24063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) similarly found an association between the insulin receptor and GAP in whole cell lysates only after pretreatment with PAO. Consistent with the association of GAP and the IGF-I receptor, we have also found that IGF-I stimulation leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of GAP protein. This IGF-I-stimulated GAP tyrosine phosphorylation was only detectable in the presence of the phosphatase inhibitor. In the untreated cell, this tyrosine phosphorylation may be undetectable because of rapid dephosphorylation. These data further indicate that GAP may interact with the IGF-I receptor in vivo under certain conditions and may be a component of the IGF-I receptor signaling cascade. This interaction may be tightly regulated by PAO-sensitive phosphatases. The IGF-I receptor does not associate with PLC-γ, even in the presence of PAO or when the PLC-γ-GST is used at high concentrations. In this report, we show that the IGF-I receptor may directly associate with SH2 domain proteins including p85, Syp, and GAP. We have mapped the IGF-I receptor binding site for p85 and Syp to tyrosine 1316 in the carboxyl terminus and the binding site for GAP to tyrosine 950 in the NPXY domain. The association between these proteins and the IGF-I receptor may provide an alternate mechanism to directly activate these signaling molecules."

Treatment of differentiated HL60 cells or transiently transfected COS-7 cells with C5a or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) results in rapid hyperphosphorylation of the C5aR. In an attempt to gain more insight into the function of phosphorylation in the desensitization of C5aR, we have initiated experiments to identify phosphoacceptor sites at the amino acid level after stimulation of cells with either C5a or PMA. In this report we show that C5aR is phosphorylated exclusively on serine residues in both differentiated HL60 and transfected COS-7 cells irrespective of the stimulus used. Peptide mapping after cyanogen bromide cleavage of phosphorylated C5aR indicates that despite the presence of a protein kinase C consensus motif the third cytoplasmic loop is not phosphorylated when cells are challenged with either C5a or PMA. Thus, whether the cells are stimulated with C5a or PMA, the phosphorylation sites appear to be restricted to serine residues in the carboxyl tail. Phosphoamino acid analysis of a series of mutants in which an individual serine residue was replaced by a threonine residue indicates that the C5aR undergoes C5a-dependent phosphorylation to the maximal stoichiometry of 6 mol of PO4/mol of receptor at Ser314, Ser317, Ser327, Ser332, Ser334, and Ser338. Simultaneous substitution of serine residues by alanine at positions 332, 334, and 338 affected neither the binding of C5a nor the cell surface expression of the mutant, but resulted in a dramatic reduction (more than 80%) of both C5a- and PMA-mediated phosphorylation as compared to the wild type receptor. This result suggests that phosphorylation on the segment extending from Ser332 to Ser338 is required for the subsequent phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal tail of C5aR.

Despite the persistent presence of chemotactic factors, the cellular responses are transient and cells become rapidly refractory to further stimulation with the same agonist(8McLeish K.R.

This phenomenon, termed homologous desensitization, is common to many hormonal and neurotransmitter signaling systems(10Hausdorff W.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J.

Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). Receptor phosphorylation appears to be a key mechanism by which many G protein-coupled receptors are regulated (12Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Tobin A.B. Nahorski S.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 279-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 13Lohse M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 14Haga T. Haga K. Kameyama K. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 400-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).It has been shown recently that the C5aR is phosphorylated rapidly upon binding of C5a, even in presence of staurosporine, a potent inhibitor of protein kinase C(15Tardif M. Mery L. Brouchon L. Boulay F. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3534-3545PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. Didsbury J.R. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24247-24254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, disruption of the signaling pathway by ADP-ribosylation of Gi proteins with pertussis toxin does not reduce phosphorylation mediated by saturating doses of agonist(49Giannini E. Boulay F. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 4055-4064PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore postulated that a specific G protein-coupled receptor kinase(s) (GRK) is involved in the process. Phosphorylation of C5aR is correlated with an attenuation of agonist-mediated GTPase activity in membranes prepared from agonist-treated cells and may explain the homologous desensitization of C5a mediated-responses(16Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. Didsbury J.R. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24247-24254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, C5aR but not the N-formyl peptide receptor (FPR), is phosphorylated in absence of agonist in cells stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a potent activator of protein kinase C(15Tardif M. Mery L. Brouchon L. Boulay F. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3534-3545PubMed Google Scholar). However, although the difference in phosphorylation between C5aR and FPR correlates with the attenuation of C5a-dependent GTPase activity in PMA-treated cells(16Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. Didsbury J.R. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24247-24254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is unclear whether protein kinase C has a functional role in the heterologous desensitization of C5aR in leukocytes stimulated with other chemoattractants. In differentiated HL60 cells, although N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe is thought to activate protein kinase C it is unable to induce phosphorylation of unoccupied C5aR(15Tardif M. Mery L. Brouchon L. Boulay F. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3534-3545PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in transfected RBL-2H3 cells thrombin and antigen have the capacity to induce phosphorylation of unoccupied C5aR(16Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. Didsbury J.R. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24247-24254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).By analogy with the visual and β-adrenergic systems(10Hausdorff W.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2881-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar, 17Wilden U. Hall S.W. Kühn H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1174-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar), one can speculate that chemoattractant receptor phosphorylation impairs coupling with the G proteins. On the other hand, the rapid disappearance of agonist-occupied chemoattractant receptors from the cell surface and the apparent segregation of occupied receptors from the G protein partner (18Painter R.G. Zahler-Bentz K. Dukes R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2959-2971Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 19Jesaitis A.J. Bokoch G.M. Tolley J.O. Allen R.A. J.

Immunol. 1990; 144: 1062-1068PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that the rapid loss of membrane receptors might represent an additional mechanism whereby signal transduction is rapidly attenuated in leukocytes. A definitive functional link between phosphorylation of the C5aR and uncoupling from the G protein is yet to be established. It is currently unknown whether a complete inhibition of the signal transduction requires a molecular interaction between the phosphorylated C5aR and arrestin-like molecules (22Lohse M.J. Andexinger S. Pitcher J. Trukawinski S. Codina J. Faure J.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8558-8564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and whether there is some relationship between the phosphorylation of serine and/or threonine residues and internalization/sequestration of occupied C5aR.Prior to a clear demonstration of the role played by the phosphorylation of C5aR in uncoupling from G protein(s) and internalization/sequestration of occupied C5aR, a precise localization of phosphorylated sites is essential. Based on the hydropathy plot and the predicted topology of C5aR, several putative PKC phosphorylation sites can be identified in the cytoplasmic domain. The third intracellular loop between TMD5 and TMD6 contains the motif LRTWSRRA that conforms to the consensus sequence (R/K)XX(S/T)X(R/K)X for potential phosphorylation by protein kinase C. In addition, the predicted COOH-terminal tail contains 11 serine and threonine residues with several less favorable phosphorylation motifs for PKC.In this report, we identify phosphorylation sites of C5aR in vivo. We show that the putative PKC phosphorylation motif in the third intracellular loop is not modified even when phosphorylation is mediated by PMA; both PMA-induced and C5a-induced phosphorylation of the C5aR map in the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic tail and are restricted to serine residues. In presence of agonist C5aR is phosphorylated with the maximal stoichiometry of 6 mol of PO4/mol of receptor. We also examine the effect of the simultaneous replacement of Ser332, Ser334, and Ser338 by alanine residues and determine that these residues are the main phosphorylation sites in both PMA- and C5a-induced phosphorylation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsCell culture media and fetal calf serum were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Carrier-free [32P]orthophosphoric acid and Na125I were from Amersham Corp. Sepharose 4B-protein A was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Human recombinant C5a (hrC5a), PMA, N6-O-2′-dibutyryl-adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (Bt2cAMP), and bovine serum albumin were from Sigma. Cyanogen bromide (CNBr) was from Merck.Cells and Cell CulturePromyelocytic HL60 cells and COS-7 cells were from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). HL60 cells in suspension and COS-7 monolayers were grown in RPMI 1640 and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, respectively. Culture media contained 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 μML-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. All cells were cultured at 37°C in 5% CO2. Differentiation of HL60 cells was induced by 1 mM Bt2cAMP for 3 days(23Chaplinski T.J. Niedel J. J. Clin. Invest. 1982; 70: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were transfected by electroporation with 10 μg of plasmid DNA/2 × 106 cells as described previously (24Mery L. Boulay F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3457-3463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Oligonucleotide-directed Mutagenesis and Expression of C5aRcDNA encoding human C5aR was excised from pCDM8-C5aR with HindIII and BamHI and subcloned into pSELECT-1 vector to generate a single-stranded DNA. The Promega pSELECT-1 mutagenesis protocol was followed to carry out mutagenesis reactions, using homemade oligonucleotides. Mutations were verified by direct sequencing with the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method with primer extension (25Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52360) Google Scholar) using the Sequenase kit from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Methionine residue 120 was substituted for a leucine residue in order to disrupt a cyanogen bromide cleavage site. Serine residues in the carboxyl-terminal tail of C5aR were individually substituted with a threonine residue. The mutated cDNAs were excised from pSELECT-1 with HindIII and BamHI and subcloned into pCDM8-C5aR after digestion with the HindIII and BstEII. Coding sequences of all mutated cDNAs were sequenced after reinsertion into CDM8. The CDM8 vector carrying wild type C5aR or mutated C5aR was used to transfect COS-7 cells by electroporation.In Vivo Phosphorylation and ImmunoprecipitationDifferentiated HL60 cells were cultured in suspension at a density not exceeding 2 × 106 cells/ml. Transfected COS-7 cells were seeded into 100-mm dishes. Three days after differentiation or transfection, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-free buffer and metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid (0.3-0.5 mCi/ml) as described previously(15Tardif M. Mery L. Brouchon L. Boulay F. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3534-3545PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of C5aR was initiated with 50 nM C5a or 1 μM PMA. After 15 min of incubation at 37°C, the cells were lysed in 500 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer consisting of 10 mM Tris-Cl, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, pH 7.5, supplemented with 5 μg/ml each leupeptin and soybean trypsin inhibitor, 100 ng/ml aprotinin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, diisopropyl fluorophosphate, and pepstatin, 10 mM NaF, 1 mMp-nitrophenyl phosphate, and 10 mM sodium phosphate. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 4°C for 3 min at 15,000 × g. Immunoprecipitation assays were performed by incubating cell lysates with 5 μl of affinity-purified anti-C5aR immunoglobulins (rabbit polyclonal antibody generated against the last 11 amino acid residues of C5aR) that were preadsorbed on 10 mg of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B. The immunoprecipitates were extensively washed as described previously (15Tardif M. Mery L. Brouchon L. Boulay F. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3534-3545PubMed Google Scholar) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1973; 220: 680-685Google Scholar) and autoradiography.Binding of 125I-Labeled C5a to Transfected COS-7 CellsFor receptor binding studies, human recombinant C5a (hrC5a) was labeled with 125I using chloramine T. In brief, 2 mCi of Na125I were mixed with 1 nmol of hrC5a in 25 μl of phosphate buffer (200 mM, pH 7.5) at room temperature. Iodination was initiated with 2 μg of chloramine T and stopped after 1 min by the addition of 40 μg of Na2S2O5. 125I-Labeled C5a was separated from free iodine by gel filtration on P6-DG from Bio-Rad (0.5 cm × 20 cm) equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin. All binding studies were carried out at 4°C with subconfluent COS-7 cell monolayers 3 days after transfection as described previously(4Boulay F. Mery L. Tardif M. Brouchon L. Vignais P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2993-2999Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Data were analyzed by computer fitting using the iterative nonlinear regression program Ligand(27Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7760) Google Scholar).Indirect Immunofluorescence MicroscopyTransfected COS-7 cells were fixed, permeabilized, and treated for immunostaining as described previously(24Mery L. Boulay F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3457-3463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Coverslips were mounted in Aquamount and viewed with a Zeiss IM epifluorescence microscope.Cyanogen Bromide Cleavage and Phosphopeptide AnalysisFor cyanogen bromide cleavage, 32P-labeled C5aR was eluted from protein A-Sepharose CL-4B with 98% formic acid. The eluted receptor was subjected to cyanogen bromide cleavage in 70% formic acid (50 mg of CNBr/ml) for 16 h at room temperature in the dark. Cleavage was terminated by freeze-drying. The CNBr peptides were solubilized in Laemmli buffer and were separated by multiphasic buffer system (Tris/BisTris/Bicine) for SDS-PAGE(28Wiltfang J. Arold N. Neuhoff V. Electrophoresis. 1991; 12: 352-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In brief, the gel consisted of 7.5% (w/v) acrylamide stacking, 10% separating, and 20% resolving gel supplemented with 0.2% linear polyacrylamide (Mr > 5,000,000) to avoid cracking during the drying step. The gels were not fixed but dried immediately after electrophoresis and exposed to Fuji RX film at −80°C. Relative molecular masses were determined after Coomassie Blue staining of molecular weight markers ranging from 2500 to 17,000 (BDH Chemicals).Phosphoamino Acid AnalysisIn situ32P-labeled C5aR was eluted from the Sepharose beads as described above. The eluate was freeze-dried in a SpeedVac, partially hydrolyzed in 200 μl of 6 M HCl at 110°C for 90 min in a sealed glass tube, diluted with 1 ml of water, and dried. The dry residue was resolubilized in 10 μl of buffer at pH 1.9 and spotted on thin-layer cellulose plates (10 × 10 cm; Schleicher & Schüll) with 1 nmol each of phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine as markers for identification of the phosphoamino acid positions by ninhydrin staining. Phosphoamino acids were separated by electrophoresis at pH 1.9 (Buffer 1: formic acid/acetic acid/H2O; 22/78/900 (v/v/v)) for 30 min at 1000 V, followed by a second electrophoresis at pH 3.5 (Buffer 2: pyridine/acetic acid/H2O; 5/50/945 (v/v/v)) for 20 min at 1000 V in the orthogonal direction(29Cooper J.A. Sefton B. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 387-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). After ninhydrin staining the thin layer plates were exposed either to x-ray film at −80°C or to PhosphorImager screen.RESULTSIdentification of in Vivo Phosphoamino Acids in C5aRTo determine the nature of the phosphoacceptor sites of C5aR in the C5a- and PMA-mediated phosphorylation state, we immunopurified the receptor from cells that were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. Labeled C5aR proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with an affinity-purified antibody directed against the last 11 residues of the carboxyl tail of C5aR (15Tardif M. Mery L. Brouchon L. Boulay F. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3534-3545PubMed Google Scholar). For each immunoprecipitation, an aliquot was electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography in order to check the degree of purity of the immunopurified receptor. We examined 32P-labeled C5aR isolated from differentiated HL60 cells (dHL60) or transiently transfected COS-7 cells that were stimulated with either 50 nM C5a or with 1 μM PMA. As shown in Fig. 1A, the 32P-labeled C5aR migrated as two bands with relative molecular masses of 43-48 kDa and 120-130 kDa. Additional studies have provided evidence that the 120-130-kDa species is related to C5aR. When a glycosylation-defective mutant (the consensus glycosylation motif NYT being changed into QYT) was expressed in COS-7 cells, the immunopurified 32P-labeled C5aR migrated in SDS-PAGE as two bands of 39-40 kDa and 80-90 kDa (data not shown). Thus, the upper band is likely to represent a dimeric form of the C5aR. Although one cannot exclude the possibility that dimers are already formed in the plasma membrane, we favor the hypothesis that dimerization rather occurs during the immunoprecipitation step or when the immune complex is dissociated in the Laemmli buffer.To identify the nature of the phosphorylated residues, we subjected the 32P-labeled C5aR, eluted from the protein A-Sepharose beads, to limited acid hydrolysis. The phosphoamino acids were resolved on thin layer cellulose plates by two-dimensional electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography (Fig. 1B). From these experiments (n = 3), we observed that the 32P-labeled C5aR proteins contained exclusively phosphoserine residues whether they were purified from dHL-60 or from transfected COS-7 cells stimulated with either C5a or PMA. This result was quite unexpected in view of the elevated number of threonine residues present in the putative third intracellular loop and the cytoplasmic tail, which have been proved to be the main targets for kinases in numerous receptors.Mapping of the Domains of C5aR Containing Phosphoserine ResiduesTwo potential regions of C5aR, i.e. the putative third intracellular hydrophilic loop that contains a potential PKC consensus motif (LRTWSRRA) and the COOH-terminal region that contains numerous serine residues, are likely to be phosphorylated upon agonist binding or after stimulation of cells with PMA. To define which of these two regions were preferentially modified when cells were stimulated with C5a or with PMA, we cleaved the immunopurified phosphorylated receptors at methionine residues with cyanogen bromide. The scarcity and the peculiar distribution of methionine residues in the primary amino acid sequence of C5aR allowed the generation of a limited number of well resolved CNBr fragments with molecular masses ranging from 8.8 to 16 kDa (Fig. 2, upper part). The 13-kDa fragment represents the NH2-terminal part of the receptor, comprising the first two transmembrane domains (TMD) and the first intracellular and extracellular loops. The 16-kDa fragment encompasses residues 121 to methionine 264 and includes the putative second intracellular loop, between TMD3 and TMD4, and the third cytoplasmic loop with a consensus PKC-phosphorylation motif XRXXSRX, between TMD5 and TMD6. The 8.8-kDa fragment contains the serine/threonine-rich cytoplasmic tail with PKC phosphorylation sites in a less favorable context.Figure 2:Mapping of the phosphorylated regions of C5aR after stimulation with either C5a or PMA. A, positions of methionine residues and putative phosphorylation sites in the primary sequence of the C5aR are indicated. The blackrectangles represent the putative TMDs. The serine/threonine-rich cytoplasmic tail and the putative PKC motif in the third intracellular loop between TMD5 and TMD6 have been expanded. The theoretical masses of the peptides generated by CNBr cleavage are indicated for the wild type and the mutant receptor Met120 → Leu (M120 → L). B, phosphopeptide analysis after CNBr cleavage of 32P-labeled C5aR. 32P-Labeled C5aR was immunoprecipitated with affinity-purified IgG from COS-7 cells that were transfected either with the wild type C5aR (Wt) or with the Met120 → Leu mutant form (M120 → L). Cells were stimulated with either 50 nM C5a (left panel) or with 1 μM PMA (right panel). The phosphorylated receptor was eluted from the Sepharose beads, treated with CNBr for 16 h, and the CNBr-peptides were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions using the multiphasic buffer system described by Wiltfang et al.(28Wiltfang J. Arold N. Neuhoff V. Electrophoresis. 1991; 12: 352-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As illustrated in Fig. 2(lower part), cleavage of wild type C5aR immunoprecipitated from C5a-stimulated COS-7 cells yielded a single phosphorylated fragment that migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 8-9 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Uncleaved C5aR migrated in this electrophoretic system at the interface between the 10% separating gel and the 20% resolving gel. The lack of phosphorylated species in the range of 16 kDa suggests that the third intracellular loop is not phosphorylated after C5a stimulation. Surprisingly, the same pattern of phosphorylation was observed and a 16-kDa phosphorylated species was not detected after cleavage of wild type receptor immunopurified from PMA-treated cells. To rule out the possibility that the 8-9-kDa phosphorylated band is in fact the 16-kDa peptide with an aberrant electrophoretic behavior, we generated a mutant receptor in which the methionine residue at position 120 was replaced by leucine. With this mutant receptor, only two CNBr fragments with molecular masses of 8.8 and 29 kDa were expected (see Fig. 2, upper part). As with the wild type receptor, the mutant receptor yielded a phosphorylated cyanogen bromide fragment in the range of 8-9 kDa whether the phosphorylation was mediated by C5a or by PMA. Lack of phosphorylated 16-kDa species could have resulted from an adsorption of this peptide on the glassware during freeze-drying. To rule out this possibility, experiments were performed in which the cleavage of C5aR was carried out in the gel slice. After washing, the gel slice was further loaded on a gel and phosphorylated peptides were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The same pattern of phosphorylated bands was observed (not shown). Thus, this strongly suggests that the third intracellular loop is not phosphorylated, despite the presence of an amino acid sequence that conforms to a PKC phosphorylation motif.Together the results indicate that the carboxyl-terminal tail of unoccupied C5aR is the exclusive target for a PMA-stimulated kinase, presumably PKC, and that the same domain is also phosphorylated by a staurosporine-insensitive kinase(15Tardif M.

Immunol. 1995; 154: 4055-4064PubMed Google Scholar), presumably a member of the GRK family, which specifically recognizes the agonist-occupied state of C5aR.Identification of Phosphorylated Serine Residues in Agonist-dependent PhosphorylationAs a rule, it is difficult to characterize the phosphorylation sites in the primary sequence of heptahelical receptors, primarily because of problems in sequencing phosphorylated Ser/Thr-rich peptides and difficulties in purifying sufficient amount of phosphorylated material to isolate the COOH-terminal domain after proteolytic cleavage. The observation that phosphorylation occurs exclusively on serine residues in the carboxyl tail of C5aR rendered the identification of phosphorylated serine residues possible without turning to a strategy involving peptide sequencing or mass spectrometry. We reasoned that if a serine residue is phosphorylated, its replacement by threonine might generate a phosphothreonine detectable by phosphoamino acid analysis, inasmuch as the kinase has no strict requirement for a serine residue at this particular position. Six mutants in which serine at position 314, 317, 327, 332, 334, or 338 was replaced by threonine, were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. On the basis of the level of phosphate incorporation, all the mutant receptors were found to be transported to cell surface with an efficiency similar to that of the wild type receptor (not shown). After stimulation with C5a, the phosphorylated mutant receptors were immunopurified and subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis. As illustrated in Fig. 3, a phosphothreonine was detectable whatever the position of the Ser/Thr substitution, suggesting that all serine residues could be phosphorylated upon C5a binding. The"

Previous studies have shown that expression of WAF1 is induced through the p53-dependent pathway; WAF1 is induced in cells with functional p53 but not in cells with either mutant p53 or no p53. Human myeloblastic leukemia cells KG-1 had no constitutive expression of p53, and irradiation did not induce p53. However, irradiation increased WAF1 expression in KG-1 cells and other cell lines containing mutant p53. The KG-1 cells constitutively produced low levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF); irradiation markedly increased the production of TNF. Notably, induction of WAF1 mRNA by irradiation was blocked by anti-TNF antibody. Furthermore, exogenously added TNF increased levels of WAF1 mRNA in these cells. Irradiation increased the rate of WAF1 transcription 3-fold, and the half-life (t) of WAF1 mRNA in these cells increased from <1 h in unirradiated cells to >4 h in irradiated cells. These findings indicate that increased levels of WAF1 transcripts occur, at least in part, through a pathway of TNF production and that the increase in WAF1 mRNA observed after irradiation is regulated by both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms. Our present study strongly suggests that an alternative pathway of induction of WAF1 occurs independent of activation by p53.

Our present study strongly suggests that an alternative pathway of induction of WAF1 occurs independent of activation by p53. The molecular mechanism of cell proliferation is extremely complex; deregulation results in neoplastic transformation. In eukaryotes, proliferation of cells is finely regulated through the cell cycle. Studies have shown that the cell cycle is regulated by a series of enzymes known as cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks)(1Hunter T. Cell. 1993; 75: 839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 2Sherr C.J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar). The activities of Cdks are controlled by their association with regulatory subunits, cyclins; the expression of cyclins and the activation of the different cyclin-Cdk complexes are required for the cell to cycle(1Hunter T. Cell. 1993; 75: 839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 2Sherr C.J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar). Thus, the cell cycle is regulated by activating and inhibitory phosphorylation of the Cdk subunits, and this program has internal check points at different stages of the cell cycle(3Draetta G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). When cells are exposed to external insults such as DNA damaging agents, negative regulation of the cell cycle occurs; arrest in either G1 or G2 stages is induced to prevent the cells from prematurely entering into the next stage before DNA is repaired (4Cohen S.M.

Irradiation is one of the stresses that produce physical and chemical damage to tissues; irradiation induces neoplastic transformation as well as killing of cells. In the presence of oxygen, irradiation increases the formation of radicals including superoxide radicals (O)(10Hall E.J. Radiobiology for the Radiologist. Lippincott, Philadelphia1988: 10Google Scholar, 11Fridovich I. Science. 1978; 201: 875Crossref PubMed Scopus (2771) Google Scholar), and the importance of these reactive oxygen species has been emphasized in irradiation-induced tissue damage(12Scott M.D. Meshnick S.R.

FASEB J. 1993; 7: 361Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The reaction of these radicals with DNA results in DNA strand breaks, which may be a critical step in radiation-induced transformation(14Cross C.E. Halliwell B. Borish E.T. Pryor W.A. Ames B.N.

In response to these stresses, cells express or activate proteins that protect themselves from external insults and also cause inhibition of replicative DNA synthesis(5Hartwell L.H. Weinert T.A.

Recent studies have shown that p53 (a tumor suppressor) plays an important role as a cell cycle check point determinant following irradiation; irradiation causes a transient inhibition of replicative DNA synthesis, G1 arrest in cells having wild-type p53, while the inhibition did not occur in cells without a functional p53 (23Kastan M.

In this study, we examined the effect of irradiation on regulation of the WAF1 gene in a human myeloblast cell line (KG-1) and other cell lines and also explored the possible mechanisms of regulation of its expression. Our data show that irradiation induces WAF1 gene expression in cells containing either no p53 or mutated p53 and that the induction occurs at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. We also found that expression of the WAF1 gene by irradiation requires protein kinase C activation, and increased levels of WAF1 transcripts are also regulated through a pathway that requires production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) 1The abbreviations used are: TNFtumor necrosis factorGygrayILinterleukinkbkilobase(s)TPA12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. 1The abbreviations used are: TNFtumor necrosis factorGygrayILinterleukinkbkilobase(s)TPA12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. in KG-1 cells. tumor necrosis factor gray interleukin kilobase(s) 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. tumor necrosis factor gray interleukin kilobase(s) 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. All cell lines used in the present study were obtained from American Type Tissue Culture Collection. Cells were cultured in α-medium (Cosmo Bio Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 7% fetal calf serum (Mitsubishi Kasei Co., Tokyo, Japan) in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Nonadherent cell lines were cultured at an initial concentration of 2 × 105 cells/ml, and flasks containing 1 × 106 cells/ml were used for experiments. For experiments using adherent cell lines, subconfluent cultures were employed. Cells were irradiated with γ-ray by a 137Cs source emitting at a fixed dose rate of 12 Gy/minute as determined by dosimetry. The p53 monoclonal antibody PAb1801 (Ab-2) and the WAF1 monoclonal antibody EA10 (Ab-1) were purchased from Oncogene Science (Cambridge, MA). The neutralizing antibody against human TNF (polyclonal rabbit anti-human TNFα) was purchased from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA). One microliter of this antibody neutralizes 1000 units of TNF. The antibody against human IL-1β (number 297) was a polyclonal rabbit antibody and was kindly provided by Dr. Tsutomu Nishida (Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Tokushima, Japan). Human recombinant TNF and IL-1β were also from Genzyme, and the specific activities were 1.08 × 108 units/mg protein and 5 × 108 units/mg protein, respectively. Actinomycin D and cycloheximide were purchased from Sigma. Cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mmol/liter Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, 0.1% SDS, 100 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate. After centrifugation, the protein concentrations in each sample were determined by the method of Bradford(33Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248Crossref PubMed Scopus (216033) Google Scholar). Samples, each containing 20 μg of cell lysates in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer were electrophoresed in 12% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon, Millipore, Bedford, MA). Then immunoblotting was performed using anti-human p53 or anti-human WAF1 antibody (10 μg/ml and 1 μg/ml final concentrations, respectively). After washing the blots, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-human mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) diluted 1:2000 was added to the blots. Imunoreactivity on the blots was detected by nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Life Technologies, Inc.). The concentration of TNF in either the culture supernatants or cell lysates was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Conditioned media from cultures of either control or irradiated KG-1 cells were prepared by centrifuging the supernatants at 1000 × g for 10 min. Cell lysates were made by sonicating the cells in ice-cold phosphate buffered saline after irradiation and debris was removed by centrifugation. The content of protein in cellular lysates was measured by the method of Bradford (33Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248Crossref PubMed Scopus (216033) Google Scholar). Standard curves of TNF protein were plotted by serial dilution of purified recombinant human TNF as a standard. This assay was specific and did not detect other cytokines including GM-CSF, G-CSF, M-CSF, IL-1, IL-3, transforming growth factor β, IL-6, and IFN-γ (Genzyme). The plasmid containing human WAF1 cDNA (2.1 kb, NotI) was kindly provided by Dr. B Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD)(29El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R.

The TNF cDNA fragment (0.8 kb, EcoRI) was from pSPl42-2(34Pennica D. Nature. 1984; 312: 724Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). IL-1β cDNA was from pA-26(35Auron P.E. Webb A.C.

Nonadherent cells were lysed in a guanidinium isothiocyanate mixture (4 M guanidinium isothiocyanate, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 20 mM EDTA, 2% (v/v) sodium lauryl sarcosinate, and 140 mM 2 β-mercaptoethanol. The lysed cells were treated with proteinase K, and then their total RNA was extracted by phenol/chloroform. For cytoplasmic RNA from adherent cells, cells were lysed with hypotonic buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, and 0.3% Nonidet P-40. Cytoplasmic RNA was extracted by the phenol/chloroform method as described previously(40Akashi M. Saito M. Koeffler H.P. Blood. 1989; 74: 2383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After denaturation at 65°C, RNA was electrophoresed in agarose-formaldehyde (1%) and transferred to a nylon membrane filter (Amersham Corp.)(41Goldberg D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 57945Google Scholar). Filters were hybridized with 32P-labeled probe for 16-24 h at 42°C in 50% formamide, 2 × SSC (1 × SSC: 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 15 mmol/liter sodium citrate), 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. Filters were washed to a stringency of 0.1 × SSC for 10 min at 65°C and exposed to x-ray film (RX, Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd., Kanagawa, Japan). Autoradiograms were developed at different exposures. For a quantitative analysis, the relative densities of the bands of hybridization of WAF1 in different lanes were scanned by the LKB UltroScan XL laser densitometer. KG-1 cells were exposed to irradiation, the nuclei were isolated by suspending in a hypotonic buffer (10 mmol/liter Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mmol/liter KCl, 3 mmol/liter MgCl2), and lysis was accomplished in 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Nuclei were harvested by centrifugation (500 × g, 5 min), washed in a hypotonic buffer, resuspended in nuclear storage buffer (40% glycerol, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA). Nuclei were incubated for 30 min at 30°C in a reaction buffer containing 150 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.25 mM ATP, 0.25 mM GTP, 0.25 mM CTP, and 200 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol). The reaction was terminated by adding DNase I (10 min at 30°C), and 30 μg of carrier tRNA was added. The reaction mixture was digested by 40 μg/ml proteinase K in a solution containing 10 mM EDTA and 1% SDS, followed by phenol/chloroform extraction. The aqueous phase was precipitated at −70°C with 70% ethanol in the presence of 0.3 M sodium acetate, and the precipitate was collected by centrifugation and dissolved in TE (10 mmol/liter Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mmol/liter EDTA). After denaturation in 0.2 N NaOH (ice-cold) and neutralization in 0.2 mol/liter HEPES, nuclear RNA was run through a Sephadex G50 spun column to remove unincorporated [32P]UTP. Plasmid DNA containing the cDNA coding inserts was denatured by heat and alkalization (0.3 N NaOH). Denatured plasmids (5 μg for WAF1 and p53 and 2 μg for β-actin) were bonded to nylon membranes (Hybond-N) using BIO-DOT SF (Bio-Rad) and immobilized by UV cross-linker. Newly elongated nuclear RNA was hybridized to the filters containing plasmids. Hybridizations were performed with 107 cpm of 32P-labeled RNA/ml in 3 × SSC, 5 mmol/liter EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 10 × Denhardt's solution, 50% formamide, 10 mM NaH2PO4 (pH 7.0), 200 μg/ml of yeast tRNA, and 100 μg/ml of salmon sperm DNA for 3 days at 42°C. After hybridization, filters were rinsed in 2 × SSC at room temperature and then in 2 × SSC and 0.1 × SSC at 42°C. The relative density of bands of hybridization of WAF1 and β-actin in untreated and irradiated lanes was scanned by the LKB UltroScan XL laser densitometer. We determined whether irradiation affected the expression of WAF1 in p53 mutated KG-1 cells by Western blotting using a WAF1 monoclonal antibody (Fig. 1). The KG-1 cells were cultured for 8 h after exposure to irradiation at different doses (0, 5, 10, 20, and 40 Gy). Cells were harvested, and the level of WAF1 in total cellular protein was examined. Unirradiated KG-1 cells constitutively expressed a very low level of WAF1 protein. A significant increased level of WAF1 was observed at 5 Gy of irradiation and continued to increase in a dose-dependent fashion. At 40 Gy of irradiation, the level of WAF1 was approximately 6 times greater than that from unirradiated cells. In contrast, p53 expression was not detected in untreated KG-1 cells, and irradiation did not induce p53 in these cells. The KG-1 cells were cultured for 2 h after exposure to various doses of irradiation as indicated (Fig. 2). To determine the effect of irradiation on WAF1 gene expression, we performed Northern blot analysis of total RNA using 32P-labeled WAF1 cDNA probe (Fig. 2). The KG-1 cells constitutively contained low but detectable concentrations of mRNA coding for WAF1. Irradiation with a dose of 10 Gy increased the WAF1 gene expression to a detectable level; the induction of WAF1 RNA was dependent on the dose of irradiation. The induction of the WAF1 gene was maximal after exposure to 40 Gy of irradiation (greater than 10-fold stimulation over base-line levels). Irradiation also induced TNF and IL-1 mRNAs in these cells in a dose-dependent fashion. The KG-1 cells were irradiated at 40 Gy and harvested sequentially at different durations. Northern blot analysis showed that irradiation markedly increased the level of WAF1 mRNA by 2 h after irradiation, and then these levels slightly decreased by 8 h (Fig. 3). On the other hand, an increase of TNF mRNA was observed 1 h after irradiation. By 2 h, expression of TNF RNA reached nearly plateau levels, and then the levels returned to base line by 8 h after irradiation. Irradiation also increased the levels of IL-1β RNA in a manner almost parallel to that of WAF1. In order to investigate whether irradiation was capable of inducing WAF1 RNA in cells having either mutant p53 or no p53, a variety of cell lines were investigated. Studies that are shown on Fig. 4A analyzed for constitutive expression of p53 and WAF1 mRNA by the various cell lines. The KG-1, THP-1, K562, U937, and SK-OV-3 cells did not express p53 RNA, and these results were consistent with previous studies(42Kastan M.B. Radin A.I. Kuerbitz S.J. Onyekwere O. Wolkow C.A.

Pence J.C. Shorter N.A. Iglehart J.D. Marks J.R. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 127PubMed Google Scholar), and p53 mRNA was easily detectable. These cell lines, except SK-HEP-1 cells, constitutively had either very low or undetectable levels of WAF1. These cells were irradiated at different doses and cultured for 4 h. Cells were harvested and examined by Northern blotting. Exposure to irradiation clearly induced expression of WAF1 RNA in MOLT-4 cells that have a mutation at codon 248 of p53 (49Rodrigues N.R. Rowan A. Smith M.E.F. Kerr I.B. Bodmer W.F. Gannon J.V. Lane D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7555Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar) and SK-HEP-1 cells that have a partial deletion of the p53 gene (48Bressac B. Galvin K.M. Liang T.J. Isselbacher K.J. Wands J.R. Ozturk M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4, B and C). However, irradiation failed to induce WAF1 expression in K562, U937, CEM, HL60, and SK-OV-3 cells; each of these lines contains a mutant p53 gene (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2 and 3, irradiation increased levels of TNF mRNA in KG-1 cells. To investigate whether irradiation affects translation of these transcripts, KG-1 cells were cultured for 8 h after exposure to irradiation at different doses (10-80 Gy) (Fig. 5). As a control, unirradiated cells were cultured for 8 h. Conditioned media and cells were harvested; levels of TNF in conditioned media and cell lysate were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The TNF protein in supernatants of untreated cells was negligible (Fig. 5A). Irradiation induced levels of TNF in a dose-dependent fashion. A significant increase of TNF production was observed at 10 Gy of irradiation (p < 0.01). At 80 Gy of irradiation, the level of TNF was approximately 7 times greater than levels from 10 Gy-irradiated cells (p < 0.001). In parallel, the study of TNF in cell lysates showed that untreated KG1 cells constitutively contained low levels of TNF; irradiation markedly increased the TNF levels in a dose-dependent manner. At a dose of 10 Gy, levels of intracellular TNF were 3 times greater than that in untreated cells (p < 0.01), and at 80 Gy levels were 9-fold (Fig. 5B). To investigate the involvement of endogenously produced TNF in the expression of WAF1 mRNA by irradiation, KG-1 cells were preincubated with antibody against human TNF for 1 h, which neutralizes 1000 units/ml of TNF, and then cells were irradiated with 20 Gy in the presence of anti-TNF antibody (Fig. 6). After 2 h, cells were harvested, and levels of WAF1 mRNA were compared with those in control cells, which were cultured in medium alone. Treatment with anti-TNF antibody blocked the increase in irradiation-induced WAF1 transcripts by 80%. These experiments were repeated twice with similar results. Treatment with exogenously added TNF (100-1000 units/ml) alone for 4 h induced WAF1 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 6). The KG-1 cells also expressed IL-1 mRNA upon irradiation as shown in Fig. 2, 3, and 6A. However, exposure of the cells to IL-1 did not increase the levels of WAF1 mRNA in these cells (data not shown). Cells exposed for prolonged durations to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) reduce their protein kinase C activity, thus making them resistant to repeated exposure to TPA(51Blackshear P.J. Witters L.A. Girard P.R. Kuo J.F. Quamo S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 52Ballester R. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). KG1 cells cultured with TPA (50 nmol/liter) for 4 h had markedly increased accumulation of WAF1 RNA compared with untreated cells, and prolonged exposure (24 h) to TPA (100 nmol/liter) did not affect the increased level of WAF1 RNA (Fig. 7). However, reexposure of these cells to TPA (50 nmol/liter) for 4 h failed to increase the level of WAF1 transcripts as compared with cells cultured with TPA for 24 h alone. Irradiation did not increase the accumulation of WAF1 mRNA in cells exposed to TPA for 24 h. Transcriptional run-on assays were performed to help to determine the mechanisms responsible for the accumulation of WAF transcripts by irradiation (Fig. 8). WAF1 was constitutively transcribed in untreated KG-1 cells. Exposure of the cells to irradiation (20 Gy, 2 h) increased the transcriptional rate of WAF1 3-fold. To examine posttranscriptional regulation of WAF1 mRNA in irradiated KG-1 cells, either unirradiated or 20 Gy-irradiated cells were cultured for 2 h and actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) was added to cultures. Cells were further cultured for an additional 1-4 h and were sequentially harvested and examined for level of WAF1 mRNA (Fig. 9). In order to make clear the constitutive levels of WAF1 mRNA in untreated cells, the blot with WAF1 probe was exposed to x-ray film longer than usual (96 h). The half-life (t) of steady state WAF1 mRNA in unirradiated KG-1 cells was <1 h, while t of WAF1 mRNA after irradiation was >4 h. Many of the damaging effects of ionizing irradiation are mediated by reactive free radicals(10Hall E.J. Radiobiology for the Radiologist. Lippincott, Philadelphia1988: 10Google Scholar, 13Hirose K.

H.(1994) Cancer Res. 54, 1139-1144). We report here the full-length mTIMP-3 cDNA sequence, the promoter sequence and partial characterization, expression and induction of TIMP-3, and the possible molecular basis for the lack of mTIMP-3 expression in neoplastic JB6 cells. There are three transcripts arising from alternative polyadenylation of mouse TIMP-3 gene, having sizes of 4.6, 2.8, and 2.3 kilobase pairs, respectively. All three TIMP-3 transcripts are expressed in preneoplastic but not neoplastic JB6 cells. Computer analysis of cloned TIMP-3 promoter revealed six AP-1 binding sites, two NF-κB sites, a c-Myc site, and two copies of a p53 binding motif separated by eight base pairs with two mismatches at the second motif, along with many other cis elements. TIMP-3 gene expression was inducible by AP-1 and NF-κB activators, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, and tumor necrosis factor-α only in preneoplastic cells with an induction peak at 2 h post-treatment, suggesting classification of mTIMP-3 as a member of the immediate early gene family. Southern blot, mutational analysis, and transient transcriptional activation experiments revealed that the lack of expression of mTIMP-3 in neoplastic JB6 cells was due neither to gross deletion nor to promoter mutation of the gene, nor was there a lack of transcription factors required for transcriptional activation. Instead, the lack of TIMP-3 expression in neoplastic JB6 cells may reflect an abnormal methylation of the gene. Both hyper- and hypomethylation of the mTIMP-3 gene are associated with complete down-regulation of gene expression in neoplastic JB6 cell lines. Treatment of neoplastic cells with the methylase inhibitor 5-azacytidine caused reexpression of the mTIMP-3 gene in a tumor cell line that showed hypermethylation but not in another that showed hypomethylation of the gene, suggesting a complex role for methylation in the silencing of gene expression.

Acta. 1992; 1180: 1-8Google Scholar, 29Pusey M.L. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6202-6210Google Scholar). Differences in the binding of the cofactors Va and VIIIa to activated platelets suggest that factor Va receptors, distinct from phospholipids, may exist (reviewed in (1Nesheim M.E. Furmaniak-Kazmierczak E. Henin C. Côté G. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 80-86Google Scholar)). However, the role of platelet proteins in regulating platelet factor V activity has not yet been determined.The intent of our study was to identify factor V/Va-binding proteins in platelets. Using affinity chromatography, we identified a complex, disulfide-linked multimeric platelet protein that specifically bound factors V and Va and the light chain of factor Va. Immunochemical analyses indicated that this protein was multimerin, a novel soluble multimeric platelet protein that is stored in α-granules and is expressed on the surface of activated platelets(30Hayward C.P.M. Smith J.W. Horsewood P. Warkentin T.E. Kelton J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7114-7120Google Scholar, 31Hayward C.P.M. Warkentin T.E. Horsewood P. Kelton J.G.

Factor V in platelet lysates was found to be complexed with multimerin, and immunoelectron microscopy colocalized factor V with multimerin in platelet α-granules. These studies identify multimerin as a factor V/Va-binding protein and suggest a possible role for multimerin as a carrier protein for factor V stored in platelets.MATERIALS AND METHODSAntibodiesAntibodies used included monoclonal (JS-1) and rabbit polyclonal antibodies to multimerin(30Hayward C.P.M.

Esmon), burro polyclonal anti-human factor V (provided by Drs. Kenneth G. Mann and Paula Tracy), a monoclonal antibody specific for the factor Va light chain (Hematologic Technologies, Essex Junction, VT), and a monoclonal antibody against human Fcγ receptor II (IV.3; Medarex, New Lebanon, NH). Control antibodies included monoclonal antibodies against PECAM-1 (provided by Dr. Alexey V. Mazurov) and against protein C inhibitor (PCI-174; provided by Dr. A. Giles), normal mouse IgG, and normal rabbit IgG. Secondary antibodies included alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-horse IgG (for burro antibodies), goat anti-mouse IgG and goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., Bio/Can Scientific, Inc., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Mississauga), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-horse IgG (Sigma). Nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Bio-Rad) and ECL (Amersham, Oakville, Ontario) were used for immunoblot detection.Protein PreparationFactor V was purified from bovine plasma and converted to factor Va with thrombin as described(34Nesheim M.E. Katzmann J.A. Tracy P.B. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 249-274Google Scholar). The light and heavy chains of bovine factor Va were separated by QAE-Sepharose chromatography (Sigma) in the presence of EDTA. Human prothrombin(35Mann K.G. Elion J. Buthowski R.J. Downing M. Nesheim M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 286-302Google Scholar), thrombin(36Lundblad R.L. Kingdon H.S. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1976; 45: 156-176Google Scholar), and factor Xa (37Miletech J.P. Broze Jr., G.J. Majerus P.W. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 13137-13142Google Scholar) were purified as described. Proteins were quantitated by the method of Bradford(38Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as the standard, and by absorbance at 280 nm. For samples containing Triton X-100, proteins were quantitated by the method of Lowry et al.(39Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar). Radiolabeled factor Va (100 μg) was prepared using 1 mCi of Na125I and two IODO-BEADs (Pierce) in 1 ml of 200 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1 M NaCl. The iodinated factor Va was isolated using a Sephadex G-25 column and had a specific activity of 5000 cpm/ng. Bovine factor Va (84-86% amino acid identity to human factor V in the heavy and light chain domains) (40Guinto E.R. Esmon C.T. Mann K.G. MacGillivray R.T.A. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6508-6514Google Scholar) was used for affinity chromatography and direct binding studies because of the quantities required. For some experiments, active site-blocked factor Xa was prepared using 1,5-dansyl-L-glutamyl-L-glycyl-L-arginine 1The abbreviations used are:dansyl5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonylCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]]-1-propanesulfonic acidPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisBSAbovine serum albuminDAPAdansylarginine-N-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl)amideSCCSsurface-connected canalicular system. chloromethyl ketone (Calbiochem).Platelet PreparationAll studies were approved by the University Ethics Committee. Resting and thrombin-stimulated platelets from healthy volunteers were prepared as described(30Hayward C.P.M. Smith J.W. Horsewood P. Warkentin T.E. Kelton J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7114-7120Google Scholar). For some studies, platelet lysates were prepared from freshly outdated platelet concentrates from the Canadian Red Cross(30Hayward C.P.M. Smith J.W. Horsewood P. Warkentin T.E. Kelton J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7114-7120Google Scholar). Lysates were prepared using 1% Triton X-100, 1% Triton X-114, or 1% CHAPS (30Hayward C.P.M. Smith J.W. Horsewood P. Warkentin T.E. Kelton J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7114-7120Google Scholar) and lysing buffer containing protease inhibitors (20 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, with 0.1 mM leupeptin, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.02 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 5 mMN-ethylmaleimide, with or without 10 mM EDTA). The cytoskeleton was removed from lysates by centrifugation (100,000 × g, 0.5 h, 4°C) before gel filtration or immunoprecipitation. Surface-radiolabeled resting and thrombin-activated platelets were prepared using 125I and lactoperoxidase(30Hayward C.P.M. Smith J.W. Horsewood P. Warkentin T.E. Kelton J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7114-7120Google Scholar). For some experiments, surface-labeled platelets (suspended in lysing buffer with EDTA and protease inhibitors) were subjected to freeze-thaw lysis and sonication (3 × 30 s; Biosonik IV, Bronwill VWR Scientific) followed by separation of the membrane fraction by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 2 h, 4°C). Supernatant and membrane fractions (solubilized in 1% Triton X-100; cytoskeleton removed) were used for immunoprecipitation studies.Immunoprecipitation and ImmunoblottingRadioimmunoprecipitation and immunoblotting studies were performed as described(30Hayward C.P.M. Smith J.W. Horsewood P. Warkentin T.E. Kelton J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7114-7120Google Scholar, 31Hayward C.P.M. Warkentin T.E. Horsewood P. Kelton J.G.

Warkentin T.E. Horsewood P. Kelton J.G. J. Immunol. Methods. 1993; 158: 77-85Google Scholar). Proteins were analyzed by nonreduced and reduced SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting or silver staining(46Merril C.R. Goldman D. Sedman S.A. Ebert M.H. Science. 1981; 211: 1437-1438Google Scholar). For studies of factor V-multimerin complexes, platelet lysate (200 μl of 1 × 109 platelets/ml) was incubated with monoclonal antibodies (20 μg) to factor V (V241 and V771) or to multimerin or with normal mouse IgG. Complexes were captured using protein A beads (50 μl). For some investigations, the bound proteins were treated with thrombin (1 unit/ml, 10 min, 37°C) followed by incubation in buffer with or without 10 mM EDTA. The bead eluates and supernatant fractions were analyzed by reduced SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.Preparation of Multimerin-immunodepleted LysatePlatelet lysate (2 ml of 5 × 109 platelets/ml; prepared using lysing buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl with a 5 μg/ml concentration of the calpain inhibitor E-64 (Boehringer Mannheim, Laval, Quebec, Canada) and 5 mMN-ethylmaleimide) was immunodepleted of multimerin as follows. Six serial immunodepletions were performed (45 min, 4°C) using 100 μl of JS-1-Sepharose, followed by three immunodepletions using polyclonal anti-multimerin bound to protein A beads (40 μg of antibody and 100 μl of protein A beads/depletion) and a final depletion using protein A beads (100 μl) without antisera to remove any unbound IgG-multimerin complexes. Control samples were sham-depleted in parallel using identical volumes of Sepharose beads and protein A beads without antibody. The starting material and sham-depleted and multimerin-depleted fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting and tested for factor V activity. Comparison of standard platelet lysates with those prepared using E-64 and N-ethylmaleimide as inhibitors indicated an identical profile of factor V in immunoblot analyses.Gel Filtration StudiesGel filtration experiments were used to study endogenous platelet factor V and to evaluate complex formation between factor V and platelet proteins. Experiments were carried out using a 1.5 × 60-cm column of either Bio-Gel A-5m (Bio-Rad) or Ultrogel AcA44 (Spectrum Medical Industries Inc., Los Angeles, CA) equilibrated in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 0.01% Triton X-100 containing either 0.1 or 1 M NaCl (final salt concentrations of 0.12 and 1.02 M, respectively). Platelet lysate (1 ml of 2 × 1010 platelets/ml in lysing buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 without EDTA) was applied to the column. In some experiments, 125I-labeled factor Va (40 ng) was added to the buffer, platelet lysate, the aqueous and detergent phases of a Triton X-114 platelet lysate(31Hayward C.P.M. Warkentin T.E. Horsewood P. Kelton J.G. Blood. 1991; 77: 2556-2560Google Scholar), or purified multimerin (5 μg), and the radioactivity of the fractions (1 ml) was quantitated. Immunoblot analyses were used to determine which fractions contained factor V and multimerin. Purified myosin (660 kDa) and plasma factor V (330 kDa; 0.12 and 1.02 M salt separations) were run for comparison.Affinity ChromatographyAffinity columns were prepared by incubating BSA (5 mg) or the isolated bovine factor Va light chain (1 mg) with Affi-Gel 15 (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and remaining active esters on the Affi-Gel were blocked (0.2 M Tris, pH 8.0). Protein assays indicated that >95% of the added protein was coupled to the resin.Platelet extracts used for factor Va affinity chromatography were prepared by lysing fresh human platelets (1 × 1011) at 4°C in lysing buffer (20 mM Tris, 0.1 M NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4, with 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing either 1% Triton X-100 or 1% CHAPS. Insoluble material was removed (100,000 × g, 30 min), and the supernatant was incubated with 5 ml of BSA-Affi-Gel (1 h). The unbound fraction was incubated with 1 ml of factor Va light chain-Affi-Gel or BSA-Affi-Gel. The columns were washed with lysing buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 or 0.1% CHAPS, and bound proteins were eluted with lysing buffer containing 1 M NaCl and 0.1% detergent and concentrated 10-fold (Amicon Centricon-30) prior to analysis. Identical volumes of the eluates from the factor Va light chain and control BSA columns were used for SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analyses.For some experiments, monoclonal anti-multimerin linked to Sepharose was used to affinity purify multimerin from resting platelet lysates (30Hayward C.P.M. Smith J.W. Horsewood P. Warkentin T.E. Kelton J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7114-7120Google Scholar). The affinity column was washed with 10 column volumes of 1 M NaCl prior to elution of the bound multimerin with 3 M MgCl2. The eluate was dialyzed against 10 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl before use.Binding StudiesRadiolabeled bovine factor Va (40 ng) was incubated with monoclonal antibody-purified multimerin (5 μg) or with the multimerin in the factor Va light chain eluate (20 μl). 20 μg of JS-1 and 50 μl of protein A beads were used to separate bound from free proteins. 100-Fold molar excesses of unlabeled intact factors V, Va, and Xa were tested for their ability to compete with labeled factor Va for binding to multimerin. To evaluate nonspecific binding, the binding of labeled factor Va to the capture beads in the absence of added multimerin was measured.For other studies, multimerin (20 μl of the factor Va light chain eluate) was incubated with 10-μg quantities of purified bovine factor V or Va or factor Va light or heavy chain. Bound proteins were captured using monoclonal antibodies (V241 for factors V and Va and the factor Va light chain, V771 for the factor Va heavy chain, and PCI-174 as a control for nonspecific multimerin binding) and analyzed for multimerin content by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with monoclonal anti-multimerin.Immunoelectron Microscopic StudiesImmunoelectron microscopic studies of frozen thin sections of resting and thrombin-stimulated platelets (fixed 5 min after activation with 2 units/ml thrombin in Tyrode's buffer containing 1 mM calcium) were performed as described(32Hayward C.P.M. Bainton D.F. Podor T.J. Smith J.W. Stead R. Horsewood P. Warkentin T.E. Kelton J.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2630-2639Google Scholar). Briefly, platelets were fixed with paraformaldehyde (4% in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, 3 h, 4°C) and embedded in 2.3 M sucrose. Frozen thin sections were prepared from the cell block. Single and double labeling immunochemistries were performed as described(32Hayward C.P.M. Bainton D.F. Podor T.J. Smith J.W. Stead R. Horsewood P. Warkentin T.E. Kelton J.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2630-2639Google Scholar, 47Bainton D.F. Miller L.J. Kishimoto T.K. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 166: 1641-1653Google Scholar, 48McEver R.P. Beckstead J.H. Moore K.L.

Elsevier Science Publishers Ltd., Oxford1984: 129Google Scholar). For double labeling studies, a pool of monoclonal anti-factor V antibodies (1:1 mixture of V231 and V241 and 1:1 mixture of V241 and V237; preparations used undiluted) and polyclonal antibodies to multimerin (1:25 dilution) were used. Secondary antibodies conjugated to different-sized gold particles (goat anti-mouse gold-10 and goat anti-rabbit gold-5, Amersham Corp.) were used for detection of factor V and multimerin(32Hayward C.P.M. Bainton D.F. Podor T.J. Smith J.W. Stead R. Horsewood P. Warkentin T.E. Kelton J.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2630-2639Google Scholar). Controls included primary incubations with normal mouse and normal rabbit sera and omission of the primary antibody.Factor V Activity AssaysThe factor V coagulant assays were used to determine the factor V biologic activity of sham- and multimerin-immunodepleted platelet lysates, prepared using the calpain inhibitors E-64 and N-ethylmaleimide to prevent degradation of platelet factor V by endogenous platelet calpains. Factor V activity was measured using a two-stage assay and factor V-deficient plasma prepared from normal human plasma(34Nesheim M.E. Katzmann J.A. Tracy P.B. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 249-274Google Scholar, 50Bloom J.W. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. Thromb. Res. 1979; 15: 595-599Google Scholar). Briefly, control and sham- and multimerin-depleted lysates were incubated (1 min, room temperature) with human thrombin (20 units/ml) and then diluted 1:50 in 20 mM Tris-HCl, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.4. The diluted samples were assayed for factor V activity using factor V-deficient plasma and rabbit brain thromboplastin (Organon Teknika Corp., Durham, NC). Clotting times were compared with a standard curve using normal pooled plasma as the source of factor V. Dilutions of normal plasma were made in 20 mM Tris-HCl, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.4, containing the same final Triton X-100 concentration as the platelet lysates.Prothrombinase Activity AssaysProthrombinase assays were performed using dansylarginine-N-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl)amide (DAPA; 4 μM); freshly isolated human platelets (1 × 108; activated for 1 min with 1 unit/ml human thrombin in 20 mM Tris, 0.15 M NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, pH 7.5; final reaction volume 1.6 ml); and purified prothrombin (1.4 μM), factor Xa (5 nM), and factor Va (2 nM). The fluorescent thrombin inhibitor DAPA was prepared as described(52Nesheim M.E. Prendergast F.G. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 996-1003Google Scholar). Factor Xa was added to initiate the reaction after all other components had been equilibrated to 22°C in a thermostatted quartz cuvette with a microstirrer. Once all components were added, stirring was discontinued. The rate of conversion of prothrombin to thrombin was measured by monitoring the appearance of a DAPA-thrombin complex using an MPF-66 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer Canada Ltd.). An excitation wavelength of 355 nm, an emission wavelength of 545 nm, and a 430-nm cutoff filter were used. Direct plots of DAPA-thrombin formation (4Tracy P.B. Eide L.L. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2119-2124Google Scholar, 8Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10952-10962Google Scholar) were used to calculate the initial rate of thrombin generation.For some studies, platelets were preincubated with purified intact or F(ab')2 monoclonal or polyclonal anti-multimerin. To prevent platelet activation via Fcγ receptor II, monoclonal antibody IV.3 was used to pretreat platelets in studies employing intact antibodies(53Horsewood P. Hayward C.P.M. Warkentin T.E. Kelton J.G. Blood. 1991; 77: 1019-1026Google Scholar). Control antibodies included preimmune rabbit IgG and normal mouse IgG.RESULTSStudies Investigating the Factor V/Va-Binding Proteins in PlateletsBovine factor Va light chain affinity chromatography was used to identify potential platelet factor V/Va-binding proteins. Silver stain analyses identified a major band, with a reduced molecular mass of 155 kDa, in the eluate from the factor Va light chain column (Fig. 1, silverstain, arrow), but not in the eluate from the BSA column. Analyses using nonreduced SDS-PAGE indicated that the 155-kDa protein was a large, disulfide-linked multimeric protein (Fig. 1, silverstain, arrow). The mobility of the major protein in the factor Va light chain eluate resembled multimerin, a large, soluble, disulfide-linked multimeric protein stored in platelets(30Hayward C.P.M. Smith J.W. Horsewood P. Warkentin T.E. Kelton J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7114-7120Google Scholar, 31Hayward C.P.M. Warkentin T.E. Horsewood P. Kelton J.G. Blood. 1991; 77: 2556-2560Google Scholar, 33Hayward C.P.M. Kelton J.G. Platelets. 1995; 6: 1-6Google Scholar). Immunoblot analyses using both monoclonal (Fig. 1, multimerinimmunoblot) and polyclonal anti-multimerin antibodies confirmed the protein's identity as multimerin. No multimerin was detected in the eluate from the BSA column. Immunodepletion using monoclonal anti-multimerin removed all of the 155-kDa protein from the factor Va light chain eluate.Investigations of Factor V-Multimerin BindingThe binding of multimerin to the factor Va light chain affinity column suggested that multimerin could be a specific factor V/Va-binding protein. Competitive binding studies using 125I-labeled bovine factor Va were therefore performed to study the interaction of factor V with multimerin. Radiolabeled factor Va bound to multimerin, and this interaction was inhibited by a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled intact factor V or Va, but not by active site-blocked factor Xa (Fig. 2A), indicating that multimerin is a specific factor V/Va-binding protein.Figure 2:Binding studies of multimerin and factor V. A, competitive binding studies of 125I-labeled factor Va and purified multimerin, measured in the absence or presence of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled factor V or Va or active site-blocked factor Xa. The data represent the percentage of counts bound (cpm test/cpm in the absence of competing proteins) using factor Va affinity-purified (blackbars) and monoclonal antibody-purified (whitebars) multimerin. The controlbar indicates the binding of labeled factor Va to the antibody capture beads in the absence of multimerin. B, immunoprecipitation studies comparing the binding of multimerin to bovine factor V (laneV), factor Va (laneVa), the light chain of factor Va (laneLC), the heavy chain of factor Va (laneHC), or buffer alone (laneC). The bound proteins were captured (using monoclonal antibodies to factor V or an irrelevant monoclonal antibody (lane C)) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with monoclonal anti-multimerin. An equivalent amount of multimerin (laneM) is shown for comparison. Bands attributable to immunoprecipitating mouse IgG (heavy and light chains, 53 and 23 kDa, respectively) were noted in the eluates (not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Purified multimerin, bovine factors V and Va, and the isolated heavy and light chain domains were studied to determine the"
https://openalex.org/W2062114156,"Using defined elongation complexes formed on dC-tailed templates with <i>Drosophila</i> RNA polymerase II, we have examined elongation, pyrophosphorolysis, and DmS-II-mediated transcript cleavage and the inhibitory effect of α-amanitin on these processes. Analysis of pyrophosphorolysis on soluble or immobilized DNA templates confirmed that NTPs are liberated instead of dinucleotides that are released during DmS-II-meditated transcript cleavage. 10 μg/ml α-amanitin completely inhibited DmS-II-mediated transcript cleavage but allowed extended pyrophosphorolysis and nucleotide addition to occur. α-Amanitin dramatically decreased the <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> for nucleotide addition but only slightly affected the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for nucleotides. Although the processes are mechanistically distinct, both pyrophosphorolysis and DmS-II-mediated transcript cleavage frequently resulted in similar patterns of shortened transcript. Since polymerase molecules encounter similar kinetic barriers during both processes, it is possible that there is a common step in the reverse movement of the polymerase."
https://openalex.org/W1490465614,"In search for a nonmetabolized, superior glucose analogue to study the mechanism of glucose-induced glycogen synthesis, we have tested 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-α-D-glucopyranosyl fluoride, which inhibits muscle phosphorylase b 10-fold better than does glucose (Street, I. P., Armstrong, C. R., and Withers, S. G. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 6021-6027). In a gel-filtered liver extract, 0.6 mM analogue and 10 mM glucose equally accelerated the inactivation of phosphorylase and shortened the latency before the activation of glycogen synthase. The analogue was not measurably defluorinated or phosphorylated by intact hepatocytes, as monitored by 19F NMR. When added to isolated hepatocytes, 10 mM analogue inactivated phosphorylase more extensively than did 50 mM glucose, but unlike glucose, it did not result in the activation of glycogen synthase. Therefore, the binding of glucose to phosphorylase a can account for the inactivation of phosphorylase, but the metabolism of glucose (probably to Glc-6-P) appears to be required to achieve activation of glycogen synthase.The livers of overnight-fasted, anesthetized mice contained appreciable amounts of both phosphorylase a and glycogen synthase a, without net glycogen accumulation. Likewise, hepatocytes isolated from fasted rats and incubated with 10 mM glucose contained 41% of phosphorylase and 32% of glycogen synthase in the a form, and these values remained stable for 1 h, while glycogen accumulated at only 22% of the rate expected from the glycogen synthase activity. The addition of 10 mM analogue decreased phosphorylase a to 10% without significant change in glycogen synthase a (38%), but with a 4-fold increased rate of glycogen accumulation. These findings imply that synthase a is fully active in the liver of the fasted animal and that the absence of net glycogen synthesis is due to continuous glycogenolysis by phosphorylase a. In search for a nonmetabolized, superior glucose analogue to study the mechanism of glucose-induced glycogen synthesis, we have tested 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-α-D-glucopyranosyl fluoride, which inhibits muscle phosphorylase b 10-fold better than does glucose (Street, I.

When added to isolated hepatocytes, 10 mM analogue inactivated phosphorylase more extensively than did 50 mM glucose, but unlike glucose, it did not result in the activation of glycogen synthase. Therefore, the binding of glucose to phosphorylase a can account for the inactivation of phosphorylase, but the metabolism of glucose (probably to Glc-6-P) appears to be required to achieve activation of glycogen synthase. The livers of overnight-fasted, anesthetized mice contained appreciable amounts of both phosphorylase a and glycogen synthase a, without net glycogen accumulation. Likewise, hepatocytes isolated from fasted rats and incubated with 10 mM glucose contained 41% of phosphorylase and 32% of glycogen synthase in the a form, and these values remained stable for 1 h, while glycogen accumulated at only 22% of the rate expected from the glycogen synthase activity. The addition of 10 mM analogue decreased phosphorylase a to 10% without significant change in glycogen synthase a (38%), but with a 4-fold increased rate of glycogen accumulation. These findings imply that synthase a is fully active in the liver of the fasted animal and that the absence of net glycogen synthesis is due to continuous glycogenolysis by phosphorylase a."

This prototype aptamer of thrombin has a unique double G-tetrad structure capable of inhibiting thrombin at nanomolar concentrations through binding to a specific region within thrombin exosite I. Substitution of arginine 70 in thrombin exosite I with glutamic acid effectively eliminated binding of the prototype thrombin aptamer. In contrast, aptamers selected against R70E thrombin were able to bind and inhibit both wild-type and R70E thrombins, and displayed potassium-independent inhibition. Aptamers selected against R70E thrombin bound to sites identical or overlapping with that of the prototype thrombin aptamer. These aptamers retained the potential to form double G-tetrad structures; however, these structures would be destabilized by a T → A substitution, disrupting the T4-T13 base pairing found in the prototype. This destabilization appeared to be partially compensated by newly recruited structural elements. Thus, selection against R70E thrombin did not lead to aptamers that bound to alternative sites, but instead to ssDNA structures with a suppressor mutation that accommodated the mutation in thrombin within a double G-tetrad context. These results provide insight into the aptamer-thrombin interaction and suggest that the binding site for the prototype is the dominant aptamorigenic site on thrombin.

INTRODUCTIONAptamers are oligonucleotide ligands with high binding affinity toward specific molecular targets, identified by systematic selection and amplification of a random sequence library of nucleic acids (7Ellington A.D. Szostak J.W. Nature. 1990; 346: 818-822Google Scholar; 18Kenan D.J. Tsai D.E. Keene J.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 57-64Google Scholar). Using this selection methodology, a single-stranded DNA sequence of 15 nucleotides, d(GGTTGGTGTGGTTGG), with inhibitory activity toward thrombin at nanomolar concentrations was discovered (2Bock L.C. Griffin L.C. Latham J.A. Vermaas E.H. Toole J.J. Nature. 1992; 355: 564-566Google Scholar; 13Griffin L.C. Tidmarsh G.F. Bock L.C. Toole J.J. Leung L.L.K. Blood. 1993; 81: 3271-3276Google Scholar). NMR studies demonstrated that this prototype aptamer for thrombin, also referred to as the prototype, adopted a compact tertiary structure consisting of two tetrads of guanosine base pairs and three loops with a T-T base pairing between the two minor loops (Fig. 2D) (31Wang K.Y.

Cortese R. Molecular Repertoirs and Methods of Selection. Walter De Gruyter, Berlin1995Google Scholar). 1C. S. Gibbs, personal communication. In addition, this prototype thrombin aptamer has demonstrated potent anticoagulant properties in both monkey and sheep (Griffin et al., 1993a; 14Griffin L.C. Toole J.J. Leung L.L.K. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 137: 25-31Google Scholar).The dominant structural features of thrombin include a deep active site cleft and two positively charged surfaces referred to as exosites I and II (3Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Google Scholar). Exosite I is the binding site of multiple macromolecular substrates and ligands of thrombin including fibrinogen, thrombomodulin, hirudin, and heparin cofactor II (9Fenton II, J.W. Olson T.A. Zabinski M.P. Wilner G.D. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7106-7112Google Scholar; 29Tsiang M. Lentz S.R. Dittman W.A. Wen D. Scarpati E.M. Sadler J.E.

McCurdy S.N. Griffin L.C. Toole J.J. Leung L.L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20808-20811Google Scholar) and site-directed mutagenesis of thrombin (Wu et al., 1992; 30Tsiang M. Jain A.K. Dunn K.E. Rojas M.E. Leung L.L.K. Gibbs C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16854-16863Google Scholar) defined the prototype thrombin aptamer binding site as a discrete region within thrombin exosite I and identified arginine 70 as a key residue required for interaction with the prototype thrombin aptamer. The solution of the crystal structure of the prototype thrombin aptamer complex with thrombin indicated that the prototype may interact with both exosites I and II of thrombin (25Padmanabhan K. Padmanabhan K.P. Ferrara J.D. Sadler J.E. Tulinsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17651-17654Google Scholar). However, thrombin exosite II mutants were susceptible to inhibition by the prototype (Tsiang et al., 1995), and analysis of the prototype thrombin aptamer binding to exosite I mutant, R70A, by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy1 indicated that no significant binding outside of exosite I existed.The prototype thrombin aptamer is an inhibitor of both the procoagulant and the anticoagulant functions of thrombin (Wu et al., 1992; Griffin et al., 1993a, 1993b; 20Li W.-X. Kaplan A.V. Grant G.W. Toole J.J. Leung L.L.K. Blood. 1994; 83: 677-682Google Scholar). Thrombin exerts its main procoagulant function by cleaving soluble fibrinogen, which then forms a fibrin clot. When bound to thrombomodulin, thrombin changes its substrate specificity to activate protein C, the activated form of which is a major physiological anticoagulant. The demonstration that thrombin residues involved in fibrinogen clotting and thrombomodulin binding can be dissociated (33Wu Q. Sheehan J.P. Tsiang M. Lentz S.R. Birktoft J.J. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6775-6779Google Scholar) raised interest as to whether aptamers could be selected to target a different region on thrombin than the prototype binding site or to even have inhibitory activities that could discriminate the procoagulant from the anticoagulant functions of thrombin. In an effort to probe these possibilities and to test whether non-G-tetrad structures could be selected (12Griffin L.C. Vermaas E.H. Methods Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar), we conducted aptamer selections using as a target the R70E thrombin, which was highly refractory to inhibition by the prototype. Aptamers selected against R70E thrombin were not targeted to a new binding site but instead accommodated the R70E mutation on thrombin.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsPlasma thrombin, protein C, and rabbit thrombomodulin were from Haematologic Technologies (Essex Junction, VT). R70E prothrombin was purified from the conditioned media of a stably transfected BHK-21 line expressing the mutant prothrombin as described previously (Wu et al., 1991). R70E prothrombin was processed to the thrombin form (abbreviated to IIa in all the tables) by Oxyuranusscutellatus venom and purified by Amberlite CG-50 ion-exchange chromatography (8Fenton II, J.W. Fasco M.J. Stackrow A.B. Aronson D.L. Young A.M. Finlayson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3587-3598Google Scholar).Aptamer SelectionThe starting pool was a library of 97-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing a 60-nucleotide random region flanked by constant regions for primer binding. The diversity of the starting pool was 4 × 1013. The selection cycle involving binding to a thrombin affinity column and polymerase chain reaction amplification of eluted sequences has been described (Bock et al., 1992). For the first five rounds, ~750 pmol of single-stranded DNA were applied to ~4.5 nmol of thrombin bound to 1 ml of concanavalin A-agarose. For rounds 6 and 7, ~750 pmol of single-stranded DNA were applied to ~0.1 nmol of thrombin bound to 0.15 ml of concanavalin A-agarose.Binding AssayThe dissociation constants of the selected ssDNA 2The abbreviations used are: ssDNAsingle-stranded DNAPPACKPhe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketonePBSphosphate-buffered salineBSAbovine serum albumin. pools were determined in a binding assay using microtiter wells coated with thrombin. Maleic anhydride-activated microtiter plates (Pierce) were first coated with 15 μM Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (PPACK) (Sigma) in PBS. After blocking with 3% BSA and 0.05% Tween in PBS, thrombin in selection buffer (20 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2) was added at 750 nM. Immobilization of thrombin with PPACK as a linker between thrombin and the plate, resulted in a uniform coating geometry. Unreacted thrombin was removed by washing the wells with 0.1% BSA, 0.05% Tween in PBS. Single-stranded DNA uniformly labeled with [α-32P]dNTPs was added to the wells at concentrations of 0-573 nM in selection buffer and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with constant rocking. After 2 h, the unbound DNA was removed and the wells were washed with selection buffer, broken apart and individually counted. For competition binding, the wells were coated with 1500 nM thrombin, labeled ssDNA was used at 4 nM and unlabeled ssDNA was used at concentrations of 0-1850 nM.Inhibition of Fibrinogen ClottingPlasma thrombin or R70E thrombin at 18.75 nM were incubated with ssDNA in 200 μl of selection buffer at 37°C for 1 min. Clotting was initiated by addition of 50 μl of 2 mg/ml human fibrinogen freshly diluted in selection buffer from a stock of 10 mg/ml made in calcium-free PBS. Time in seconds from addition of fibrinogen to clot formation was measured with a fibrometer. For potassium-independent inhibition, KCl was omitted from selection buffer and K2HPO4 was substituted with Na2HPO4 in the PBS used to make the fibrinogen stock solution.Inhibition of Protein C ActivationThe reaction contained 3.7 nM plasma thrombin or R70E thrombin, a variable amount of ssDNA, 2 nM rabbit thrombomodulin, and 887 nM protein C in a total volume of 50 μl. Thrombin and ssDNA were mixed in 12.5 μl of selection buffer and incubated at room temperature for 6 min. To start the reaction, 13 μl assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mM CaCl2, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% BSA), 20 μl of rabbit thrombomodulin in assay buffer, and 4.5 μl of protein C in assay buffer were added sequentially. The reaction was incubated at 37°C for 1 h and stopped by addition of antithrombin III and heparin. The activated protein C generated was assayed by hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate S-2366 (PyrGlu-Pro-Arg p-nitroanilide).Cloning and SequencingSelected single-stranded pools were polymerase chain reaction-amplified in the presence of 5′ and 3′ cloning primers containing, respectively, a BamHI site and an EcoRI site. The resulting double-stranded DNA pool was cloned into the phagemid vector pUC218 using these two restriction sites. Ampicillin-resistant, XL1-blue Escherichia coli colonies were picked, and single-stranded DNAs for sequencing were grown in the presence of the helper phage M13K07. Sequencing was by dideoxy chain termination, using Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.).RESULTSSelection against Wild-type and R70E ThrombinsIn an attempt to identify aptamers that bound to alternative sites on thrombin and to further understand how selected ssDNAs interact with thrombin, we conducted parallel selections against wild-type thrombin and R70E thrombin, which does not bind the prototype. In the first round of selection, very few input sequences bound to either wild-type (0.015%) or R70E (0.016%) thrombins. By the second round, wild-type and R70E thrombins could be distinguished, with R70E thrombin binding ~30-fold less (0.063%) of the input sequences than the wild-type (1.906%). However, the few sequences bound to R70E thrombin were quickly enriched to a level (11.221%) similar to that of wild-type thrombin (14.479%) by the third round. This suggested that either sequences capable of binding R70E thrombin were present at a lower frequency in the starting pool than sequences capable of binding wild-type thrombin or that the sequences present bound R70E thrombin with a lower affinity. In either case, R70E thrombin was less capable of serving as a substrate for aptamer selection using single-stranded DNA libraries. We describe this property of the target molecule with respect to a given nucleic acid library as aptamorigenicity. Since nucleic acid ligands selected from combinatorial libraries have been compared to monoclonal antibodies (6Edgington S.M. Bio/Technology. 1993; 11: 285-289Google Scholar), the aptamorigenicity of a target molecule is analogous to the antigenicity of an antigen molecule, i.e. its ability to elicit recognition by antibodies.Binding Properties of Aptamer Pools Selected against Wild-type and R70E ThrombinsWe tested the ability of pools of single-stranded DNA after five rounds of selection (ssP5) to bind either wild-type or R70E thrombins. The pool selected against wild-type thrombin (WTssP5) bound wild-type thrombin with a Kd of 40 ± 6 nM but had very little affinity for R70E thrombin, with a Kd > 1.2 mM. In contrast, the pool selected against R70E thrombin (R70EssP5) bound both R70E thrombin and wild-type thrombin with Kdvalues of 123 ± 37 nM and 45 ± 10 nM, respectively. This result clearly shows that R70EssP5 is different from WTssP5. Next, WTssP5 and R70EssP5 were compared in a competition binding to wild-type thrombin. WTssP5 and R70EssP5, each competed with itself with Kd values of 51 ± 5 nM and 87 ± 15 nM, respectively, consistent with those determined in the direct binding assay. Moreover, WTssP5 and R70EssP5 competed with each other for binding wild-type thrombin with Ki values of 26 ± 3 nM and 62 ± 5 nM, similar to their respective Kd values. This demonstrated that WTssP5 and R70EssP5 bind to the same or an overlapping site on wild-type thrombin. This result was confirmed by competition with the prototype thrombin aptamer for binding wild-type thrombin. Both WTssP5 and R70EssP5 competed with the prototype with an IC50 of ~150 ± 7 nM, showing in addition that the binding site of R70EssP5 is identical or overlapping with that of the prototype. Therefore, instead of selecting aptamers that bound to another site on thrombin, structural accommodation of the R70E mutation must have occurred in R70EssP5 to offset the negative effect of the thrombin mutation.Inhibitory Activities of Aptamer Pools Selected against Wild-type and R70E ThrombinsThe inhibitory activities of the pools selected against wild-type and R70E thrombins were assessed in both fibrinogen clotting and protein C activation assays (Table 1). The prototype thrombin aptamer was used as a positive control. WTssP4 and WTssP5 at 573 nM inhibited wild-type thrombin by 55% in the fibrinogen clotting assay but, like the prototype, had essentially no inhibitory activity toward R70E. In the protein C assay, WTssP4 and WTssP5 displayed the same pattern of inhibition, although the inhibition of wild-type thrombin was less pronounced than in the clotting assay. Therefore, WTssP4 and WTssP5 behaved just like the prototype. In contrast, R70EssP4 and R70EssP5 at 573 nM inhibited both wild-type and R70E thrombins by 20-28% in the clotting assay. This result is consistent with the ability of R70EssP5 to bind both wild-type and R70E thrombins. In the protein C assay, R70EssP4 and R70EssP5 inhibited R70E thrombin to a greater extent than wild-type thrombin, possibly because the R70E mutation also decreased the affinity for thrombomodulin (Wu et al., 1991; Tsiang et al., 1995) and, as a result, allowed for a more effective competition of the aptamer pool against thrombomodulin.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab In an attempt to further reduce the diversity of the pool by selecting for species with higher affinity and slower off rate, two more rounds of selection were performed under competitive conditions where the thrombin concentration was not in excess of the concentration of ssDNA (see “Experimental Procedures”). The inhibitory activity of the resultant pools, WTssP6 and WTssP7, at 573 nM toward wild-type thrombin in fibrinogen clotting increased to 80-90% but remained very low toward R70E thrombin, indicating that the discriminating property of the pool was essentially unaltered (Table 1). The same tendency was also evident in the protein C assay. The inhibitory activity of R70EssP6 and R70EssP7 toward both wild-type and R70E thrombin increased to close to 40% in fibrinogen clotting and to 26% and 43% toward wild-type and R70E thrombins, respectively, in the protein C assay. These results showed that the decrease in protein C activation inhibitory activity for WTssP5 and R70EssP5 after the fifth round was only transitory and that better inhibitory sequences eventually emerged after selection under more stringent conditions.Sequence of Pools Selected against Wild-type or R70E ThrombinsWTssP5 and R70EssP5 were cloned (data not shown). All 12 clones from WTssP5 contained a consensus core sequence with a double G-tetrad motif similar to that of the prototype: GG (N)1-3T GG(N)2-5GG (N)1-2T GG. In addition, sequences flanking the double G-tetrad core of all the clones can potentially base pair to form a more or less rigid duplex stem. These double G-tetrad motifs are consistent with the sequences found in previous pools selected against wild-type thrombin (Bock et al., 1992). The 11 clones from R70EssP5 also displayed a consensus core sequence with a double G-tetrad motif: GG TA GG (N)2-9GG(N)1-2T GG (data not shown). Strikingly, all the positions corresponding to T4 of the prototype, located in the first minor loop, were occupied by adenosine instead of thymidine. Again, sequences flanking the double G-tetrad core of most clones could potentially form a duplex stem. These observations suggested that an adenosine at a position corresponding to T4 in the prototype might play a role in the accommodation of the R70E mutation by the aptamer.Since the inhibition assays suggested further accommodation of the R70E mutation by R70EssP7 after two additional rounds of selection under more stringent conditions, we also sequenced ssP7 pools (Fig. 1). Out of 19 clones from R70EssP7, 13 clones had the same consensus double G-tetrad core sequence as the clones from R70EssP5 (consensus 70ssP7 core 1) (Fig. 1B). However, five clones (1, 2, 6, 10, and 15) had a different consensus sequence (consensus 70ssP7 core 2). This second consensus core sequence had a longer major loop,(N)6-18 and, interestingly, did not have an adenosine at the position corresponding to T4 of the prototype but instead had an adenosine at the position corresponding to T4 of the prototype. In contrast, these two positions were all occupied by thymidines in the consensus core sequences of both WTssP5 (see text above) and WTssP7 (Fig. 1A). Since these two positions were formerly occupied by two thymidines that base pair in the prototype to stabilize its double G-tetrad structure (Wang et al., 1993b), these results suggested that disruption of this base pairing by an adenosine substitution at either of these positions was critical in accommodating the R70E mutation in thrombin. Another trend after limiting target selection concerned the major loop. While its length decreased to an optimum of 3 nucleotides in WTssP7, its average length increased in R70EssP7, suggesting that a longer major loop might also contribute to accommodation.Figure 1:Sequence of pools after seven rounds of selection. A, sequence of WTssP7. B, sequence of R70EssP7. Numbering of the positions is shown under the sequence of the prototype. The last two rounds of selection were under limiting target conditions. The G residues that can potentially form G-tetrad base pairings are in boldface type. Bases in either the 5′- or 3′-flanking regions that can potentially base pair to form a stem structure are underlined. Bases that cannot base pair are represented as N. When the flanking sequences cannot form recognizable duplex regions, they are not shown. The consensus core sequences for each selection are shown, where N represents variable bases.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Inhibitory Activities of Variants of the Prototype Thrombin AptamerIn order to understand which elements in the sequences of R70EssP5 contributed to accommodation of the R70E mutation, the ability of various synthetic oligonucleotides containing the double G-tetrad motif to inhibit fibrinogen clotting was determined (Table 2). Substitution of the guanosine in the major loop of the prototype with thymidine in variant 1b had only a slight effect (8% drop in activity), as expected from the consensus WTssP7 core sequence (Fig. 1A). When thymidine at position 4 of the prototype was substituted with adenosine in variant 1 and variant 3, inhibitory activity toward wild-type thrombin was essentially abolished without any gain in inhibitory activity toward R70E thrombin. In contrast, adenosine substitution at position 12 in variant 2 had little effect as expected from the consensus WTssP7 core sequence. These observations suggested that an adenosine substitution at position 4 of the prototype had a destabilizing effect on the aptamer structure required for binding wild-type thrombin and that it alone was insufficient to accommodate the R70E mutation.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Variant 4 is identical to the double G-tetrad core sequence of clone 7 from R70EssP5. The fact that it inhibited neither wild-type nor R70E thrombins significantly suggested that sequences outside of the double G-tetrad core sequence might also contribute to stabilize the binding structure. To test this hypothesis, we assayed variants found in clones of R70EssP5, with sequences capable of duplex formation flanking the double G-tetrad core. Variant 5 (clone 5) had an inhibitory activity very similar to that of the entire pool R70EssP5. When the flanking sequences of variant 5 were removed in variant 9, inhibitory activity was essentially abolished, suggesting that the duplex region may have a stabilizing effect on the binding structure.Potassium Dependence of WTssP5 and R70EssP5 Inhibitory ActivityPotassium ions have been reported previously to stabilize G-tetrads in DNA tetraplex structures (15Guschlbauer W. Chantot J.-F. Thiele D. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1990; 8: 491-511Google Scholar) and in the prototype thrombin aptamer structure, which is necessary for its inhibitory activity (Wang et al., 1993b). To assess the role of potassium ions on the inhibitory activity of WTssP5 and R70EssP5, we prepared the single-stranded DNA pools in the presence or absence of potassium ions and assayed them in wild-type thrombin catalyzed clotting reactions with and without potassium ions, respectively (Table 3). When potassium ions were absent, sodium ions were present as substitutes. WTssP5, like the prototype, was 55-67% less inhibitory in the absence of potassium ions. This is consistent with the presence of prototype-like core structures in WTssP5. In contrast, R70EssP5 was equally inhibitory whether in the presence or absence of potassium ions, suggesting that the inhibitory structures in R70EssP5 did not require potassium ions for stabilization. In addition, the oligonucleotide variant 5, which was derived from clone 5 of R70EssP5 also displayed potassium-independent inhibition.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONWhen the prototype thrombin aptamer with a double G-tetrad structure was first discovered, it was not clear whether the emergence of this particular sequence and structure reflected a single aptamorigenic determinant on thrombin and a single aptamer consensus sequence or whether other sequences and aptamorigenic sites existed. After the initial discovery of the prototype thrombin aptamer, selection against wild-type thrombin was repeated with several other types of single-stranded DNA libraries (data not shown). All these libraries consistently yielded the same consensus sequence, of which the prototype thrombin aptamer was the highest affinity representative. This result implied that the difference between the consensus sequences of WTssP5 and R70EssP5 was not incidental.To probe for the possibility of aptamer selection by an alternative site on thrombin, we substantially reduced the affinity of the binding site for the prototype thrombin aptamer by a non-conservative substitution of arginine 70 with glutamic acid. Aptamer selection against exosite I mutant R70E thrombin generated (after five rounds) a sublibrary, R70EssP5, that had drastically different inhibitory and binding properties than WTssP5, the corresponding sublibrary generated against wild-type thrombin. Consistent with the inhibitory and binding properties of the prototype thrombin aptamer, WTssP5 was only able to bind and inhibit wild-type thrombin but not R70E thrombin because of the R70E mutation in its binding site (Fig. 2A). In contrast, R70EssP5, which was the result of selection against the mutant thrombin, was able to bind to essentially the same original binding site and inhibit the mutant thrombin through accommodation of the R70E mutation (Fig. 2B). This accommodation of Glu-70 in the mutant thrombin did not affect the ability of R70EssP5 to bind or inhibit wild-type thrombin. In fact, R70EssP5 was a better binder and inhibitor of wild-type thrombin than R70E thrombin (Fig. 2B). This could reflect a difference between arginine and glutamic acid in their interactions with nucleic acids, with the more acidic residue being less conducive to aptamer selection from random nucleic acid libraries. With two more rounds of selection under more stringent conditions, further accommodation of the R70E mutation occurred as demonstrated by an increase in the inhibitory activity of R70EssP7 toward R70E thrombin and to a lesser extent toward wild-type thrombin.Sequence analysis of clones selected against R70E thrombin revealed again a double G-tetrad consensus sequence, however, with a key difference consisting of an T → A substitution at positions corresponding to the only two conserved T bases, either T4 or T4, in the prototype thrombin aptamer (Bock et al., 1992). The NMR structure of the prototype thrombin aptamer revealed that T4 and T4 are involved in hydrogen bonding interactions with each other and base stacking interactions with the G-tetrads (Macaya et al., 1993; Wang et al., 1993b). This suggested that an adenosine substitution could destabilize the prototype structure as evidenced in the loss of inhibitory activity (Table 2) and play a key role in the accommodation of the R70E mutation in thrombin by altering the prototype structure through loss of the T4-T4 base pairing (Fig. 2C). A simpler and non-mutually exclusive interpretation of this observation might be that T4 or T4 contact arginine 70 in the aptamer-thrombin complex. However, the crystal structure of the aptamer-thrombin complex (Padmanabhan et al., 1993) seemed to suggest otherwise. This destabilizing component of the aptamer structure appeared to be compensated by other potentially stabilizing features compatible with the R70E mutation including a duplex region and a larger major loop (Fig. 1), all of which may increase the binding"
https://openalex.org/W2080511074,"Activation of CD4 positive T cells is a primary requirement for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) entry, efficient HIV replication, and progression to AIDS. Utilizing CD4 positive T cell lines and purified T cells from normal individuals, we have demonstrated that native envelope glycoproteins of HIV, gp160, can induce activation of transcription factor, activated protein-1 (AP-1). The stimulatory effects of gp160 are mediated through the CD4 molecule, since treatment of gp160 with soluble CD4-IgG abrogates its activity, and CD4 negative T cell lines fail to be stimulated with gp160. Immunoprecipitation of the gp160-induced nuclear extracts with polyclonal antibodies to Fos and Jun proteins indicates that AP-1 complex is comprised of members of these family of proteins. The gp160-induced AP-1 complex is dependent upon protein tyrosine phosphorylation and is protein synthesis-independent. This stimulation can also be abolished by inhibitors of protein kinase C, but it is unaffected by calcium channel blocker or cyclosporine A. This gp160 treatment adversely affects the functional capabilities of T cells; pretreatment of CD4+ T cells with gp160 for 4 h at 37°C inhibited anti-CD3-induced interleukin-2 secretion. Effects similar to gp160 were seen with anti-CD4 mAb. The aberrant activation of AP-1 by gp160 in CD4 positive T cells could result in up-regulation of cytokines containing AP-1 sites, e.g. interleukin-3 and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and concurrently lead to T cell unresponsiveness by inhibiting interleukin-2 secretion.

INTRODUCTIONThe CD4 molecule is the binding site of the human immunodeficiency virus via the envelope glycoprotein, gp160/gp120(1Capon D. Ward R.H.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 649-678Google Scholar). This interaction occurs at a specific region at the external domain of the CD4 molecule. There have been conflicting reports on the ability of gp160/gp120 to transduce biochemical signals through the CD4 molecule on T cells. While increase in intracellular calcium, hydrolysis of phosphatidyl inositol, and activation of tyrosine kinases have been demonstrated by some(2Kornfeld H. Cruickshank W.W. Pyle S. Berman J.S. Center D.M. Nature. 1988; 335: 445-454Google Scholar, 3Soula M. Fagard R. Fischer S. Int. Immunol. 1992; 4: 295-299Google Scholar, 4Hivroz C. Mazerolles F. Soula M. Fagard R. Graton S. Meloche S.

Retroviruses. 1991; 7: 587-593Google Scholar).The interaction of the CD4 molecule with the nonpolymorphic β2 domain of the MHC 1The abbreviations used are: MHCmajor histocompatibility classHIVhuman immunodeficiency virusAP-1activated protein-1ILinterleukinPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayTCRT cell receptormAbmonoclonal antibody. class II molecule has been demonstrated to play a vital role in activation of mature T cells and in T cell development in the thymus(8Janeway C.A. Semin. Immunol. 1991; 3: 153-160Google Scholar). Several studies have now demonstrated that the CD4-MHC class II interaction is essential for effective signal transduction, at low antigen concentrations, to increase the avidity, in co-receptor-dependent systems(9Glainchenhaus N. Shastri N. Littman D.R. Turner J.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 511-520Google Scholar, 10Zamoyska R. Derham P. Gorman S.D. von Hoegden P. Bolen J.B. Veillette A. Parnes J.R. Nature. 1989; 342: 278-280Google Scholar). Studies demonstrating the association of the src homologous tyrosine kinase p56lck and the putative p32 G-protein with the cytoplasmic tail of the CD4 molecule have demonstrated that biochemical signals can be transduced through the CD4 molecule(11Veillette A. Abraham N. Caron L. Davidson D. Semin. Immunol. 1991; 3: 143-152Google Scholar, 12Telfer J.C. Rudd C.E. Science. 1991; 254: 439-441Google Scholar). In this respect, exposure of CD4+ T cells to anti-CD4 mAb or HIV gp120 has been shown to induce activation of the Raf-1-related 110-kDa polypeptide, and phosphatidylinositol 3- and phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases (13Prasad K.V.S. Keppler R. Janssen O. Repke H. Duke-Cohan J.S. Cantley L.C. Rudd C.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7708-7717Google Scholar) and activation of NF-κB(14Chirmule N. Kalyanaraman V.S. Pahwa S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 498-505Google Scholar).Utilizing soluble envelope glycoproteins of HIV-1, gp160, we have previously demonstrated that CD4-mediated signals result in biological effects. These include up-regulation of CD40 ligand in CD4+ T cells, resulting in polyclonal B cell differentiation(15Chirmule N. Kalyanaraman V.S. Lederman S. Oyaizu N. Yagura H. Yellin M.J. Chess L. Pahwa S. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2478-2486Google Scholar); induction of IL-3, IL-6, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor mRNA and cytokine secretion, which induce increased myelopoiesis(16Than S. Oyaizu N. Pahwa R.N. Kalyanaraman V.S. Pahwa S. Blood. 1994; 84: 184-189Google Scholar); and increased expression of Fas antigen on CD4+ T cells, resulting in accelerated apoptosis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells(17Oyaizu N. McCloskey T. Than S. Hu R. Kalyanaraman V.S. Pahwa S. Blood. 1994; 84: 2622-2631Google Scholar). To delineate the nature of the biochemical signals transduced through the CD4 molecule on T cells, we have investigated the ability of gp160 and anti-CD4 mAbs to induce activation of the transcription factor, activated protein 1 (AP-1).Physiological activation of T cells through the T cell receptor results in the activation of AP-1(18Jain J. Valge-Archer V.E. Rao A. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1240-1250Google Scholar). AP-1 is a collection of homodimeric and heterodimeric protein complexes of the c-fos and c-jun proto-oncogene products(19Curran T. Franza B.R. Cell. 1988; 55: 395-397Google Scholar). These proteins interact with a common DNA binding site, the TPA-responsive element (TGA(C/G)TCA) and activate gene transcription(20Lee W. Mitchell P. Tijan R. Cell. 1987; 49: 741-752Google Scholar). The binding of AP-1 to the TPA-responsive element has been attributed to post-translational modification of preexisting members of the Fos and Jun family of proteins, involving phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events(21Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Google Scholar). Our results have demonstrated that the CD4-induced signals transduced by gp160 or anti-CD4 mAb gp160 in T cells result in activation of AP-1 by a mechanism that involves post-translational activation of Fos and Jun family of proteins.Depression of antigen-specific T cell responses is a relatively early feature of HIV infection and precedes the quantitative decline of CD4+ T cells(22Fauci A. Science. 1988; 239: 617-622Google Scholar). Several investigators have clearly demonstrated the inhibitory effects of gp120 on normal T cell functions (for review, see (23Habeshaw J.A. Dalgleish A.G. Bountiff L. Newell A.L. Wilks D. Walker L.C. Manca F. Immunol. Today. 1990; 11: 418-425Google Scholar)). The mechanism of gp120-mediated inhibition of T cell responses involves inhibition of intracellular calcium mobilization, hydrolysis of inositol phosphates, and activation of protein kinase C, and kinase activity of p56lck(24Chirmule N. Kalyanaraman V.S. Oyaizu N. Slade H. Pahwa S. Blood. 1990; 75: 152-159Google Scholar, 25Oyaizu N. Chirmule N. Kalyanaraman V.S. Hall W.W. Good R.A. Pahwa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 87: 2379-2383Google Scholar, 26Oyaizu N. Chirmule N. Pahwa S. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1807-1816Google Scholar, 27Goldman F. Jensen W.A. Johnson G.L. Heasley L. Cambier J. J.

Retroviruses. 1990; 6: 371-380Google Scholar). The reduced proliferative responses were attributed to inhibition of decreased IL-2 mRNA expression and IL-2 secretion(25Oyaizu N. Chirmule N. Kalyanaraman V.S. Hall W.W. Good R.A. Pahwa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 87: 2379-2383Google Scholar). In this study, we have suggested that binding of envelope glycoproteins of HIV to CD4+ T cells induces aberrant activation of the transcription factor AP-1 (which plays a critical role in IL-2 gene transcription, (18Jain J. Valge-Archer V.E. Rao A. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1240-1250Google Scholar)) and results in inhibition anti-CD3 mAb-induced IL-2 secretion.MATERIALS AND METHODSEnvelope Glycoproteinsgp160 and gp120 were purified from culture supernatants of a clone of HIV-infected Hut-78 cells, 6D4451, as described earlier(28Kalyanaraman V.S. Veronese F. Rahman R. Lusso P. Devico A.L. Copeland T. Oroszlan S. Gallo R.C. Sarngadharan M.G. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1990; 6: 371-380Google Scholar). Briefly, supernatant of cells grown in serum-free HB104 medium was concentrated and passed through a lentil-lectin Sepharose column. Glycoproteins were eluted with 400 mM α-methyl mannoside. gp160 was further purified by affinity chromatography over anti-HIV451 mAb-Sepharose 4B column. The envelope glycoprotein preparations were >95% pure and were not contaminated with endotoxins, as tested by the Limulus amoebocyte lysate assay (E-TOXATE, Sigma).Antibodies and ReagentsThe following reagents and resources were used: mAb to CD4 (Leu3a, IgG1; Becton Dickinson, Mountainview, CA); mAb to CD3 (mAb 454, IgG2a, gift from Dr. N. Chiorazzi, North Shore University Hospital, Manhasset, NY); nonimmune mouse Ig (mIg; Chrompure IgG, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Polyclonal antibodies to Fos and Jun proteins used were as follows; rabbit anti-c-Jun/AP1 and anti-c-Fos (Santa Cruz Biotechologies, Santa Crus, CA) recognize all of the members of the Fos/Jun family of proteins. Polyclonal rabbit anti-gp120451 was developed by Advanced BioScience Labs Inc., Kensington, MD; soluble CD4-IgG was a gift from Genentech, San Fransisco, CA. Herbimycin A (Life Technologies, Inc.), cyclosporine A (Sandoz, East Hanover, NJ), H-7, cycloheximide, 2-mercaptoethanol, verapamil, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) were purchased from Sigma.CellsCD4 positive clone of Jurkat T cells, E6-1, obtained from the National Institutes of Health AIDS Reference Reagent Program, Bethesda, MD, (donated by Dr. A. Weiss, (29Weiss A.L. Skocil R.J. Stobo J.D. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 123-128Google Scholar)) was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Whittaker) supplemented with pennicillin and streptomycin and 10% fetal calf serum. CD4 positive T cells H9, Molt4 were obtained from ATCC, Betheda, MD. CD4 negative Jurkat T cells (JN) were mutant CD4 negative (CD3+) cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis following staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD3 mAb and anti-CD4-conjugated with phycoerythrin (Becton Dickinson, Mountainview, CA).Peripheral blood lymphocytes were purified by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation. T cells were purified from peripheral blood lymphocytes by rosetting 2 times with neuraminidase-treated sheep red blood cells as described earlier(15Chirmule N. Kalyanaraman V.S. Lederman S. Oyaizu N. Yagura H. Yellin M.J. Chess L. Pahwa S. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2478-2486Google Scholar).Immunomagnetic Separation of CD4+ and CD8+ T CellsPurified T cells stimulated with medium alone or with gp160 for 4 h were incubated with anti-CD8 mAb conjugated immunomagnetic beads (Dynal, Great Neck, NY) for 30 min at 4°C on a rotating shaker, as recommended by the manufacturer. The cells were subjected to a magnetic field, and the unbound cells (designated CD8 negative, CD8- T cells) were carefully aspirated. The cells bound to the beads were designated CD8 positive (CD8+) and were >90% CD4+ as determined by flow cytometry. Nuclear proteins were extracted as described below.Nuclear ExtractsSmall scale nuclear extracts were made from 2 × 107 unactivated or activated E6-1 cells as described previously(18Jain J. Valge-Archer V.E. Rao A. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1240-1250Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, cells were stimulated with medium alone or various stimuli for 4 h at 37°C. Cells were washed and resuspended in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and lysed by the addition of Nonidet P-40 to a final concentration of 0.5%. Nuclei were pelleted and washed in the same buffer without Nonidet P-40, and nuclear proteins were extracted in buffer C (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, mM 0.42 NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 0.01% NaN3)(30Dignam J.D. Leibowitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Google Scholar). After pelleting neclear debris, the supernatant was removed and diluted with an equal volume of buffer D (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.01% NaN3). This extract was used directly in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). The equivalence of the extracts was verified by protein estimation using the BCA protein kit (Pierce).EMSADouble-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the consensus AP-1 binding sequence (5′-CGC TTG ATG AGT CAG CGC GAA-3′ (31Angel P. Imagawa M. Chiu R. Stein B. Imbra R.J. Rahmsdorf H.J. Jonat C. Herrlich P. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 49: 729-739Google Scholar)) were obtained commercially (Promega, Madison, WI) and end-labeled with [γ32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase. In some experiments, the binding site of AP-1 to the human IL-2 promoter (5′-AATTCCAAAGAGTCATCAGA-3′) was used as a competitor(18Jain J. Valge-Archer V.E. Rao A. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1240-1250Google Scholar). For each binding reaction, 10,000 cpm (0.2-0.5 ng) of end-labeled oligonucleotide was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 5-8 μg of nuclear extract in the presence of 3 mg of sheared poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The resulting DNA-protein complexes were analyzed by electrophoresis at 4°C of 4% polyacrylamide gels. Unlabeled oligonucleotides used for competitions were added to nuclear extracts and poly(dI-dC) prior to the addition of labeled probe. Gels were dried on a gel drier (Bio-Rad) and visualized by autoradiography. In some experiments, nuclear extracts were incubated with antibodies to c-Jun, c-Fos, or normal rabbit serum for 1 h on ice, followed by incubation with Protein A-conjugated Sepharose (Pharmacia) for 30 min at 4°C. After centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min, supernatants were analyzed for AP-1 binding in EMSA, as described above.IL-2 SecretionCD4+ E6-1 cells, CD4- JN cells, or purified CD4+ T cells were pretreated with medium, various concentrations of gp120, or anti-CD4 mAb (mAb Leu3a) followed by stimulation with anti-CD3 mAb (mAb 454) plus 10 ng/ml PMA for 24 h. Culture supernatants were collected and analyzed for the presence of IL-2 by commercial ELISA kit (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer's protocol.RESULTSgp160-induced AP-1 Activation in CD4+ T CellsFig. 1shows that the basal level of AP-1 activation in the CD4+ E6-1 cells could be enhanced by stimulation with gp160 at a concentration as low as 0.01 mg/ml. This concentration of envelope proteins has been previously reported in the serum of HIV-infected individuals(32Oh S.-Y. Cruickshank W.W. Raina J. Blanchard G.C. Adler W.H. Walker J. Kornfeld H. J. AIDS. 1992; 5: 251-256Google Scholar). Soluble gp120, anti-CD4 mAb (Leu3a) and PMA alone could also induce activation of AP-1 in the CD4+ E6-1 cells. Specific binding was demonstrated by abrogation of the AP-1 binding in the presence of excess unlabeled oligonucleotides corresponding to the AP-1 site in the IL-2 promoter (competitor, lane10). The kinetics of the induction of the proteins was examined by using nuclear extracts from E6-1 cells stimulated for increasing amounts of time. The gp160-induced AP-1 binding was observed within 30 min, peaked at 4 h, persisted for 24 h of stimulation (Fig. 2). The gp160-induced AP-1 binding was specific, since it could be abrogated by pretreatment of gp160 with goat anti-gp120 polyclonal antibody (Fig. 3, compare lane2 with lanes6 and 7); normal goat serum had no significant effect on the stimulatory effect of gp160 (lane8). That the constituents of the gp160-induced AP-1 complex comprises Jun and Fos components was confirmed by abrogation of AP-1 binding by immunoprecipitation of the gp160-stimulated nuclear extracts with polyclonal antibodies to c-Jun and c-Fos (Fig. 4); even the basal level binding of AP-1 was inhibited by the addition of these antibodies. Normal rabbit serum had no significant effect on the gp160-induced AP-1 binding. These results indicate that gp160 can induce activation of AP-1 in CD4+ T cells and that the AP-1 complex consists of Fos/Jun family of proteins.Figure 2:Kinetics of the gp160-induced AP-1 activation. E6-1 cells were stimulated with 1 mg/ml gp160 for various time intervals indicated. AP-1 binding was analyzed by EMSA.

E6-1 cells were stimulated with medium alone (lane1, unsti) or 1 μg/ml gp160 (lanes2-8) in the presence of 10 or 1 μg/ml soluble CD4-IgG (Genentech, CA) (lanes3 and 4) or 1 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, (lane5), 1:1000, 1:3000 dilution of polyclonal goat anti-gp160 antibodies (lanes6 and 7), or 1:1000 dilution of normal goat serum (lane8). EMSA were performed as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 4:The gp160-induced AP-1 complex contains Fos and Jun family of proteins. Nuclear extracts were generated from E6-1 cells either unstimulated (lane1) or stimulated with 1 μg/ml gp160 for 4 h at 37°C (lanes2-8). The gp160-induced nuclear extracts were incubated with medium (lanes1 and 2), 1 μg (in 1 μl), or 0.1 μg (in 0.1 μl) of antibodies to Fos and Jun proteins (which recognize all of the members of the Fos/Jun family of proteins) or normal rabbit serum for 1 h at 4°C. Immune complexes were immunoprecipitated with Protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia), and supernatants were analyzed for AP-1 binding. Results are representative of five separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The gp160-induced Activation of AP-1 Was Mediated through the CD4 MoleculeIn order to demonstrate that the cell surface molecule involved in the gp160-mediated stimulatory effects was CD4, gp160 was first preincubated with soluble CD4- IgG for 30 min at 4°C, prior to addition to the cell cultures. Fig. 3shows that the stimulatory activity of gp160 on E6-1 cells could be abrogated by pretreatment of gp160 with soluble CD4-IgG (compare lane2 with lanes3 and 4). An irrelevant protein, bovine serum albumin, did not have any effect on the gp160-induced activation of AP-1 (lane5).In order to further demonstrate that gp160-induced activation of AP-1 was mediated through the CD4 molecule, CD4+ and CD4 negative T cell lines were analyzed. Fig. 5shows that gp160 could stimulate AP-1 activation in CD4+ H9 cells, Molt4 cells, but not in CD4 negative mutant Jurkat T cells (JN). Here again, pretreatment of gp160 with soluble CD4 abrogated AP-1 activation in CD4+ T cells. All of these cells could be effectively induce AP-1 activation upon stimulation with PMA. These results demonstrate that the stimulatory activity of gp160 on AP-1 activation is mediated through the CD4 molecule.Figure 5:CD4 positive T cell lines, but not CD4 negative T cell lines could be induced by gp160 to increase AP-1 activation. H9 cells were stimulated with medium alone (lane1, unsti), or with PMA, gp160, or gp120 (lanes2, 3, and 4) in the presence of soluble CD4 IgG (lanes5, 6, and 7); E6-1 cells were stimulated with medium alone (lane8), PMA and gp160 (lanes9 and 10) as positive controls. CD4 positive Molt4 and CD4 negative JN (mutant CD4 negative Jurkat cells) were stimulated with medium alone (lanes1 and 7, unsti), gp160, gp120 (lanes2 and 3 and lanes8 and 9) in the presence of soluble CD4-IgG (lanes4 and 5 and lanes10 and 11) or PMA alone (lanes6 and 12).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Gp160 Induced AP-1 Activation in Peripheral Blood CD4+ T CellsIn order to determine the ability of gp160 to activate physiological cells and peripheral blood T cells, purified T cells were first stimulated with gp160 for 4 h at 37°C. CD4+ T cells were separated from CD8+ T cells by negative selection using anti-CD8 mAb-conjugated magnetic beads; cells bound to the beads were designated CD8+, and unbound T cells designated CD8-. Fig. 6shows that stimulation of CD8- T cells (>90% CD4+ by flow cytometry) with gp160 induced AP-1 activation (upperrightpanel) no activation of AP-1 occurred in the CD8+ T cells (upperleftpanel). The stimulatory effects of gp160 on CD8- T cells could be abrogated by pretreatment of gp160 with soluble CD4- IgG (lowerpanel). Soluble CD4- IgG itself did not induce activation of AP-1 (data not shown).Figure 6:gp160 can induce CD8- but not CD8+ peripheral blood T cells to induce AP-1 binding. Upper panel, purified T cells were stimulated with medium alone (lane1, unsti), 1 μg/ml gp160 (lanes2 and 3), or gp120 (lanes4 and 5). CD4 and CD8 positive T cells were separated by anti-CD8 mAb-conjugated magnetic beads (Dynal, Great Neck, NY). Adherent cells were denoted CD8 positive and nonadherent cells as CD4 positive. Nuclear extracts were assessed for AP-1 binding by EMSA. The arrow indicates specific binding for AP-1, and the lower band indicates nonspecific binding (ns). Lower panel, gp160 induced AP-1 binding in CD4+ peripheral blood T cells can be abrogated by soluble CD4- IgG. Purified T cells were stimulated with medium alone (lane1, unsti) or 1 μg/ml gp160 (lanes2 and 3) or gp120 (lanes4 and 5) in the presence of soluble CD4-IgG (lanes3 and 5); 50 ng/ml PMA (lane6). Nuclear extracts of CD4+ T cells were analyzed for AP-1 binding by EMSA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Signal Requirements for the gp160-induced AP-1 ActivationIn order to investigate the nature of the signals involved in the activation of AP-1 by gp160, several pharmacological inhibitors were utilized. Fig. 7shows that addition of herbimycin A (HA, inhibitor of tyrosine phosphorylation), and H7 (inhibitor of protein kinase C) abrogated gp160-induced AP-1 activation. A more specific inhibitor of protein kinase C activity, calphostin (33Gublins H. Coggeshall K.M. Baier G. Telford D. Langlet C. Baier-Bitterlich G. Berrard-Bonnefoy N. Burn P. Wittinghofer A. Altman A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4749-4758Google Scholar) also inhibited the gp160-induced AP-1 binding (data not shown). Cyclosporine A (CsA) and the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide (CHX) had no significant effect on activation of AP-1, as did the calcium channel blocker, verapamil (ver). These studies indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of protein kinase C were involved in the mechanism of the gp160-induced activation of AP-1 binding.Figure 7:The gp160-mediated AP-1 binding is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation, activation of protein kinase C, but not on protein synthesis or increase in intracellular calcium or CsA. E6- 1 cells were pretreated with various concentrations of cyclosporine A (CsA), herbimycin A (HA), verapamil (ver), cycloheximide (CHX), or H7 and stimulated with gp160 for 4 h at 37°C. Electromobility shift assays were performed as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)gp120 Inhibits IL-2 Secretion by CD4+ T CellsE6-1 cells or purified peripheral blood CD4+ T cells were pretreated with 1 μg/ml gp120 or anti-CD4 mAb for 4 h at 37°C (which induced AP-1 binding) and stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb plus PMA for an additional 24 h at 37°C, and culture supernatants were analyzed for IL-2 secretion. Table I shows that gp120- or anti-CD4 mAb-treated E6-1 cells and CD4+ peripheral blood T cells were markedly inhibited in their ability to secrete IL-2 in response to anti-CD3 mAb. Pretreatment of the CD4 negative T cells (JN) cells with gp120 or anti-CD4 mAb, however, had no effect on anti-CD3 mAb plus PMA-induced IL-2 secretion.DISCUSSIONWe have demonstrated that the addition of gp160 to CD4+ T cells induces activation of transcription factor AP-1 by signals transduced directly through the CD4 molecule.Signals transduced through the CD4 molecule on T cells has been shown to play an important role in regulating T cell functional responses mediated through the T cell receptor(8Janeway C.A. Semin. Immunol. 1991; 3: 153-160Google Scholar). Earlier studies had implicated that the binding (adhesion) of the CD4 molecule with its natural ligand, MHC class II molecule, participated in T cell activation by stabilizing the T cell receptor (TCR)-MHC interactions (34Biddison W.E. Rao P.E. Talle M.A. Goldstein G. Shaw S. J. Immunol. 1983; 131: 152-187Google Scholar). In addition, inhibition of T cell activation by anti-CD4 mAbs in MHC class II independent systems suggested that inhibitory signals were transduced through the CD4 molecule(35Bank I. Chess L. J. Exp Med. 1985; 162: 1294-1303Google Scholar). In contrast, recent experiments have indicated that positive signals may be induced via the CD4 molecule, either by anti-CD4 mAbs (36Carrel S. Salvi S. Gallay P. Rapin C. Sekaly R.P. Res.Immunol. 1991; 142: 97-108Google Scholar) or by HIV envelope glycoproteins, gp160/gp120(2Kornfeld H. Cruickshank W.W. Pyle S. Berman J.S. Center D.M.

Several investigators have demonstrated that binding of gp160/gp120 to CD4 molecules on the cell surface results in activation of biochemical signals(2Kornfeld H. Cruickshank W.W. Pyle S. Berman J.S.

Cathepsin E was very active at weakly acidic pH in the processing of chemically synthesized precursors such as the precursor to neurotensin/neuromedin, proopiomelanocortin, the precursor to xenopsin, and angiotensinogen. The processing sites were adjacent to a dibasic motif in the former two precursors and at hydrophobic recognition sites in the latter two. The common structural features that specified the processing sites were found in the carboxyl-terminal sequences of the active peptide moieties of these precursors; namely, the sequence Pro-Xaa-X'aa-hydrophobic amino acid was found at positions P4 through P1. Pro at the P4 position is thought to be important for directing the processing sites of the various precursor molecules to the active site of cathepsin E. Although the positions of Xaa and X′aa were occupied by various amino acids, including hydrophobic and aromatic amino acids, some of these had a negative effect, as typically observed when Glu/Arg and Pro were present at the P3 and P2 positions, respectively. Cathepsin D was much less active or was almost inactive in the processing of the precursors to neurotensin and related peptides as a result of the inability of the Pro-directed conformation of the precursor molecules to gain access to the active site of cathepsin D. Thus, the consensus sequence of precursors, Pro-Xaa-X′aa-hydrophobic amino acid, might not only generate the best conformation for cleavage by cathepsin E but might be responsible for the difference in specificities between cathepsins E and D."

This localization is in agreement with the distribution of the native hair cell current, suggesting that the differential current expression is transcriptionally regulated. The primary structure of cIRK1 is highly homologous to the mouse inward rectifier IRK1. However, we found that cIRK1 exhibited reduced single-channel conductance (17 picosiemens) and lower sensitivity to Ba2+ block (K = 12 μM). We identified Gln-125 near the putative pore region as being responsible for these differences. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to change Gln-125 to Glu (the residue in IRK1), resulting in a channel with a single-channel conductance of 28 picosiemens and a Ba2+ block of K = 2 μM.

In each tissue PSA and PST were highest during early stages of morphogenesis, followed by a decrease as development reached completion. The insertion of the VASE exon in the fourth Ig domain of NCAM was also found to parallel closely the developmental down-regulation of PSA, and on this basis could be considered a potential determinant in the specific polysialylation of NCAM.

In particular, the direct analysis of the native membranes with a patch clamp electrode has provided strong evidence of the presence of high conductance ion channels (reviewed in (1Sorgato M.C. Moran O. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 18: 127-171Google Scholar)). By applying this technique to the IM of mitoplasts (obtained from mitochondria by removal of the OM), at least three types of channels have been found. One has a conductance of around 10 pS (in 100 mM salt) and is distinguishable for the selective permeability toward potassium ions. It is not regulated by voltage but is sensitive to a number of drugs and physiological effectors, including matrix ATP, which acts as inhibitor in the mM range(2Inoue I. Nagase H. Kishi K. Higuti T. Nature. 1991; 352: 244-247Google Scholar). Conversely, the main feature of the other channel, slightly anionic and with a conductance of around 100 pS (in 150 mM KCl) (mitochondrial centum picosiemens (mCS) channel), is the voltage dependence(3Sorgato M.C. Keller B.U. Stühmer W. Nature. 1987; 330: 498-500Google Scholar). At positive (unphysiological) matrix potentials the channel is mainly open, whereas the open probability decreases as the voltage is made negative. Interestingly, the current-voltage relationship of the entire IM shows an identical behavior, thus suggesting a major role of mCS channels in the electric activity of this membrane(1Sorgato M.C. Moran O. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 18: 127-171Google Scholar). The third type of channel, frequently referred to as mitochondrial megachannel, is notable for the peak conductance of 1-1.3 nS (in 150 mM KCl) and the multiple substates(4Kinnally K.W. Campo M.L. Tedeschi H.T. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1989; 21: 497-506Google Scholar, 5Petronilli V. Szabò I. Zoratti M. FEBS Lett. 1989; 259: 137-143Google Scholar).

Fluorescent fatty acid probes show substantial changes in emission spectrum in the presence of rDvA-1L, which can be reversed by fatty acids (oleic, palmitic, stearic, arachidonic) and retinoids, but not by tryptophan, squalene, or cholesterol. Moreover, changes in intrinsic fluorescence of retinol or retinoic acid confirm a retinoid binding activity. Fluorescence titration experiments indicate stoichiometric binding to a single protein site per monomer unit with affinities (Kd) in the range 3 × 10-8M for 11-((5dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl)amino)undecanoic acid, and, by competition, 5 × 10-8M for oleic acid. The extreme blue shift of bound fluorescent fatty acid suggests an unusually low polarity for the protein binding site. The emission spectrum of the single tryptophan of rDvA-1L indicates that it is deeply buried in a non-polar environment, and its spectrum is unaffected by ligand binding. Far UV circular dichroism of rDvA-1L reveals a high α-helix content (53%). Differential scanning calorimetry studies indicate that rDvA-1L is highly stable (Tm≈ 98°C), refolding efficiently following thermal denaturation. DvA-1 therefore represents an example of a new class of lipid binding protein, and is the first product of a polyprotein with this activity to be described.

Fluorescence titration experiments indicate stoichiometric binding to a single protein site per monomer unit with affinities (Kd) in the range 3 × 10-8M for 11-((5dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl)amino)undecanoic acid, and, by competition, 5 × 10-8M for oleic acid. The extreme blue shift of bound fluorescent fatty acid suggests an unusually low polarity for the protein binding site. The emission spectrum of the single tryptophan of rDvA-1L indicates that it is deeply buried in a non-polar environment, and its spectrum is unaffected by ligand binding. Far UV circular dichroism of rDvA-1L reveals a high α-helix content (53%). Differential scanning calorimetry studies indicate that rDvA-1L is highly stable (Tm≈ 98°C), refolding efficiently following thermal denaturation. DvA-1 therefore represents an example of a new class of lipid binding protein, and is the first product of a polyprotein with this activity to be described. Hydrophobic compounds such as fatty acids and retinoids are usually transported and protected in intracellular or extracellular aqueous environments within carrier proteins(1Glatz J.F.C. van der Vusse G.J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1990; 98: 237-251Google Scholar). The small (less than 20 kDa) water-soluble fatty acid and retinoid-binding proteins are usually β-strand-rich and include those with either 8 or 10 strands which form so-called β-barrel or β-clam structures (reviewed in (2Sacchettini J.C. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18399-18402Google Scholar)). Serum albumin is an exception to the predominance of β-sheet in aqueous phase FABPs 1The abbreviations used are: FABPfatty acid-binding proteinβ-LGβ-lactoglobulinBSAbovine serum albuminCDcircular dichroismdansyldimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonylDAUDA11-((5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl)amino)undecanoic acidDSCdifferential scanning calorimetryGdnHClguanidine hydrochlorideKSVStern-Volmer coefficientNPAnematode polyprotein allergenOAF5-(octadecanoyl)aminofluorescein)PBSphosphate-buffered saline. in comprising predominately helical structures, although it is considerably larger and has binding sites for ligands other than fatty acids(3He X.M.

One of the most abundant proteins produced by nematodes is an approximately 15-kDa protein similar to the ABA-1 allergen of the large roundworm of humans, Ascaris lumbricoides(4Tomlinson L.A. Christie J.F Fraser E.M. McLaughlin D. McIntosh A.E. Kennedy M.W. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 2349-2356Google Scholar, 5Christie J.F. Dunbar B. Davidson I. Kennedy M.W. Immunology. 1990; 69: 596-602Google Scholar). These extracellular proteins are produced from large precursors which are subsequently cleaved proteolytically into multiple copies of the 15-kDa polypeptide units(6Culpepper J. Grieve R.B. Friedman L. Mika-Grieve M. Frank G.R. Dale B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 54: 51-62Google Scholar, 7Tweedie S. Paxton W.A. Ingram L. Maizels R.M. McReynolds L.A. Selkirk M.E. Exp.

This manner of synthesis and processing led to the term “nematode polyprotein allergens” (NPA) for these proteins(10McReynolds L.A. Kennedy M.W. Selkirk M.E. Parasitol. Today. 1993; 9: 403-406Google Scholar). The structure of NPA genes is unusual in comprising a head to tail array encoding multiple units of the 15-kDa polypeptides with consensus proteinase cleavage sites at the junctions(6Culpepper J. Grieve R.B. Friedman L. Mika-Grieve M. Frank G.R. Dale B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 54: 51-62Google Scholar, 7Tweedie S. Paxton W.A. Ingram L. Maizels R.M. McReynolds L.A. Selkirk M.E. Exp.

Today. 1993; 9: 403-406Google Scholar). No information on the structure and function of NPAs has been published, and data base searches for similarity with proteins of known function have proved fruitless. Recently we made a fortuitious observation indicating that the ABA-1 allergen protein binds certain hydrophobic ligands, which prompted us to examine the behavior of other NPAs. With very rare exceptions, however, it is not feasible to purify the NPA from parasitic nematodes because of the small size of the organisms or the difficulty in obtaining them in sufficient quantities, particularly from human sources. Here we circumvented this problem by isolation of NPA-encoding nucleic acid from parasites, and expression of the polypeptide in bacteria to provide material for biochemical and structural analysis. In this case we have concentrated on the NPA array of Dictyocaulus viviparus, the highly pathogenic parasite of the lungs of cattle. Using recombinant polypeptide representing a single unit of the polyprotein array, we have been able to demonstrate that the protein has high affinity lipid binding activity and structural characteristics distinguishing it from the β-barrel family of small fatty acid/retinoid-binding proteins of vertebrates. DNA encoding dva-1 repeat unit l was amplified from plasmid pCB10 (GenBank accession number U02568; (11Britton C. Moore J. Gilleard J.S. Kennedy M.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar)) using primers complementary to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the repeat unit (primer L1, ACGACGggatccTTACGAAATAGACGTG; primer L2, ATGTTggatccCCTAATGACGTCGTGCTTTCG; lower case denotes BamHI sites). Amplification was carried out for 30 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 55°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min. The DNA fragments were purified from agarose gel using a siliconized glass wool spin column and Magic clean-up resin (Promega, Southampton, United Kingdom). These were then digested with BamHI and ligated into BamHI digested and dephosphorylated pET 15b expression vector (Novagen, Witney, UK). Transformants containing insert DNA in the correct orientation, as determined by DNA sequencing, were grown to an A600 of 0.6 then induced with 1 mM isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma, Poole, Dorset) at 37°C for 2 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 4,000 × g, resuspended in binding buffer (5 mM imidazole, 0.5 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.9) containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma) and sonicated on ice for five 1-min bursts. Following centrifugation at 15,000 × g, the supernatant was applied to His-Bind metal chelation resin (Novagen) packed in a 2-ml column. The washing procedure and elution of the fusion protein were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. The N-terminal histidine tag was cleaved by treatment with thrombin at a concentration of 1 unit/mg protein and the cleaved tag was then removed by filtration through a Centricon 10 device (Amicon, Stonehouse, Scotland, UK). This leaves a polypeptide representing the entire DvA-1L with a small residual stretch of amino acids remaining after thrombin cleavage or encoded by the BamHI restriction sites engineered into the plasmids used: GSHMLEDP at the N terminus and IP at the COOH terminus. Residual detergent was removed by passage down an Extracti-Gel D column (Pierce). The concentrations of solutions of rDvA-1L protein were determined spectrophotometrically using an ε280 value of 12,090 M-1 cm-1, calculated from the tyrosine and tryptophan content of the protein (12Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Google Scholar). Fast protein liquid chromatographic analysis was carried out with a Superose 12 column (Pharmacia, Sweden) calibrated over the appropriate molecular size range(11Britton C. Moore J. Gilleard J.S. Kennedy M.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). The fluorescent fatty acid analogues 11-((5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl)amino)undecanoic acid (DAUDA), and 5-(octadecanoyl)aminofluorescein) (OAF) were obtained from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR. Dansyl-DL-α-aminocaprylic acid and dansylamide were obtained from Sigma, as were all-trans-retinol, all-trans-retinoic acid, arachidonic acid, oleic acid, stearic acid, palmitic acid, squalene, cholesterol, and L-tryptophan. The fluorophore-conjugated fatty acids and the retinoids were stored as 10 mM stock solutions in ethanol, in the dark at −20°C, and freshly diluted in 171 mM NaCl, 3.3 mM KCl, 17 mM Na2HPO4, 1.84 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.2 (PBS), to approximately 1 μM for use in the fluorescence experiments. Competitors of fluorescent fatty acid binding were prepared as stock solutions in ethanol at approximately 10 mM (except for tryptophan, which was prepared in PBS) and diluted in PBS for use. Reference and control proteins were obtained from Sigma and prepared as stock solutions at 10 mg ml-1 in PBS. Fluorescence measurements were made at 20°C in a Perkin-Elmer LS50 or SPEX FluorMax spectrofluorimeter (Spex Industries, Edison, NJ), using 2-ml samples in a quartz cuvette. Raman and background scattering by the solvent was corrected for where necessary using appropriate blank solutions. Quenching of protein fluorescence by succinimide was performed and analyzed as described previously(13Johnson C.M. Price N.C. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 525-530Google Scholar), using succinimide recrystallized from ethanol before use. Control experiments using dansylamide in a similar system indicated minimal binding of the fluorophore group alone to NPA proteins. 2-ml samples of rDvA-1L at a monomer concentration of 1.6 μM were titrated by addition of 10-μl aliquots of DAUDA at a concentration of 33 μM, and the fluorescence measured at 490 nm, with λExc = 345 nm, in comparison to similar mixtures in the absence of protein. The concentration of the ethanol stock solution of DAUDA was confirmed by absorbance of a 1:10 dilution in methanol at 335 nm, using an extinction coefficient ε335 of 4400 M-1 cm-1(14Haughland R.P. Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals 5th Edition. Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR1992Google Scholar). Fluorescence data (F/Fmax), corrected for dilution, were analyzed by standard nonlinear regression techniques (using Microcal ORIGIN software) in a simple noncompetitive binding model (Fmax/F = 1 + Kd/(CL - nCpF/Fmax); CL = total ligand (DAUDA) concentration; Cp = total protein (rDvA-1L) concentration) to give estimates of the extrapolated maximal fluorescence intensity (Fmax), dissociation constant (Kd), and number of binding sites (n) per rDvA-1L monomer unit. The apparent dissociation constant (Kapp) for oleic acid was estimated from the decrease in fluorescence at 490 nm by the progressive addition of increasing concentrations of oleic acid to a mixture of 1.1 μM rDvA-1L and 1.15 μM DAUDA, where Kapp = K1(1 + [DAUDA]/Kd) and K1 is the competitive inhibition constant for oleic acid. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded at 20°C in a JASCO J-600 spectropolarimeter using quartz cells of path length 0.02 or 0.05 cm. Protein concentrations were typically in the range 0.1 to 0.5 mg ml-1. Molar ellipticity values were calculated using a value of 115 for the mean residue weight calculated from the amino acid sequence of the protein. Analysis of the secondary structure of the protein was performed using the CONTIN procedure (15Provencher S.W. Glöckner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Google Scholar) over the range 240 to 190 nm. Guanidinium hydrochloride (GdnHCl) (ultrapure grade) was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, Scotland, and the concentrations of solutions checked by refractive index measurements(16Nozaki Y. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 26: 43-50Google Scholar). Experiments were performed by standard procedures (17Cooper A. Johnson C.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 22: 109-150Google Scholar) using a Microcal MC2-D instrument at a scan rate of 60°C h-1 over a 20-110°C range using sample concentrations of 0.5-1.5 mg ml-1. Normalized excess heat capacity data were analyzed by standard procedures, using Microcal ORIGIN software, to give the midpoint transition temperatures (Tm) and calorimetric (ΔHcal) transition enthalpies. It has been established from cDNA sequencing that the DvA-1 polyprotein comprises different forms of the approximately 15-kDa DvA-1 polypeptide units(11Britton C. Moore J. Gilleard J.S. Kennedy M.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar), but the expression system used here was designed to provide only the polypeptide encoded by the most 3′ unit of the 12-member array, designated DvA-1L. The recombinant polypeptide (molecular weight 16,410) was designated rDvA-1L, and judged to be homogeneous on the basis of a single band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or a single symmetrical peak in gel filtration. The single gel filtration peak eluted at Mr 29,000 ± 1,000, and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis yielded a single band of Mr 15,000, indicating that the native protein may form a dimer in solution. The fatty acid binding activity of purified rDvA-1L was examined using fluorescent lipid analogues whose emission spectra alter upon entry into binding proteins. The fluorescence emission of DAUDA is polarity-sensitive, and its intensity is increased and shifted to a shorter emission wavelength when bound to liver FABP(18Wilkinson T.C.I. Wilton D.C. Biochem. J. 1986; 238: 419-424Google Scholar). Control experiments with dansylamide revealed minimal binding to DvA-1L, indicating that the fluorophore group itself is probably not contributing significantly to the binding of the dansylated fatty acid. In buffer alone, the peak emission of DAUDA occurred at 543 nm, but moved to 490 nm upon addition of rDvA-1L (Fig. 1), together with a marked increase in emission intensity. This blue shift was greater than that reported for serum albumin (495 nm; (19Wilton D.C. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 163-166Google Scholar)) and rat liver FABP (500 nm; (18Wilkinson T.C.I. Wilton D.C. Biochem. J. 1986; 238: 419-424Google Scholar)). Blue shifting of the emission wavelength of the dansyl fluorophore is usually taken as a measure of the polarity of the binding site in binding proteins(20Macgregor R.B. Weber G. Nature. 1986; 319: 70-73Google Scholar), which can be calibrated semiquantitatively by reference to the emission spectrum of fluorescent probe in a series of organic solvents. The fluorescence spectrum of DAUDA in ethanol, dimethylformamide and cyclohexane showed emission peaks at 506, 505, and 475 nm, respectively, in order of decreasing polarity (data not shown). The observed blue shift to 490 nm of DAUDA in rDvA-1L thus indicates a binding site which is highly apolar or one in which unusual ligand orientation constraints or interactions between DAUDA and protein occur. Similar blue shifts in fluorescence were found with a fluorescent fatty acid probe in which the dansyl fluorophore is attached to the α carbon (dansyl-DL-α-aminocaprylic acid), rather than to the hydrocarbon (ω) terminal, as in DAUDA (data not shown). This similarity in behavior of the two probes could be taken to indicate that the ligand is held entirely within the binding site of rDvA-1L and isolated from polar solvent. X-ray crystallographic studies of intestinal, muscle, and myelin FABPs show the removal of ligand from solvent(21Banaszak L. Winter N. Xu Z. Bernlohr D.A. Cowan S. Jones T.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 89-151Google Scholar, 22Zanotti G. Scapin G. Spadon P. Veerkamp J.H. Sacchettini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18541-18550Google Scholar, 23Sacchettini J.C. Gordon J.I. Banaszak L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 327-339Google Scholar). This feature appears, therefore, to be widespread among FABPs and would have the advantage of protecting oxidation-sensitive ligands such as retinoids and unsaturated fatty acids during transport within an organism or cell. The binding of natural, non-fluorescent fatty acids and other hydrophobic ligands was determined from their competitive effects on the fluorescence of the rDvA-1L•DAUDA complex. For example, progressive additions of arachidonic acid brought about a reversal of the fluorescence effect, presumably by displacement of the DAUDA from the binding site (Fig. 1). Similar experiments revealed strong competitive inhibition by oleic, stearic, and palmitic acids, retinol and retinoic acid, but none with tryptophan, squalene, or cholesterol. Fluorimetric titration of rDvA-1L with DAUDA (Fig. 2A) gave a progressive increase in relative fluorescence intensity consistent (within experimental uncertainty limits) with binding of DAUDA to a single binding site (n = 0.949) on each rDvA-1L monomer, with apparent dissociation constants (Kd) of approximately 3.0 × 10-8M. This Kd is of a similar order to those observed for lipid-binding proteins FABPs(24Thumser A.E.A. Evans C. Worrall A.F. Wilton D.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 103-107Google Scholar), and a similar value was obtained for oleic acid when this was progressively added to a rDvA-1L/DAUDA mixture (K1 = 5 × 10-8M; Fig. 2B). The binding characteristics of rDvA-1L were also investigated using the fluoresceinated fatty acid OAF. This probe has a low level of fluorescence in aqueous solution and binding to proteins can be detected by an increase in fluorescence without a change in λmax. Addition of rDvA-1L to this probe (Fig. 3) gave a substantial increase in fluorescence which occurred with none of the other reference proteins except β-lactoglobulin (β-LG) and serum albumin (BSA), both of which have well established fatty acid binding activities(3He X.M. Carter D.C Nature. 1992; 358: 209-215Google Scholar, 25Papiz M.Z. Sawyer L. Eliopoulos E.E. North A.C.T. Findlay J.B.C. Sivaprasadarao R. Jones T.A. Newcomer M.E. Kraulis P.J. Nature. 1986; 324: 383-385Google Scholar). As with the dansylated probes, the effect of rDvA-1L on OAF fluorescence was reversed upon addition of oleic acid or retinoic acid (data not shown). Interestingly, DAUDA and OAF differentiated the fatty acid binding activities of rDvA-1L and BSA from that of β-LG, in that the former two bound both DAUDA and OAF, whereas β-LG bound only OAF. The binding of retinoids to rDvA-1L, indicated by the above competition experiments, was confirmed directly by the effect on their intrinsic fluorescence. Fig. 4shows the emission spectra of retinol and retinoic acid in which the addition of rDvA-1L resulted in a substantial increase in fluorescence. BSA or β-LG, but none of the other standard proteins used above, had similar effects on the fluorescence of the retinoids (not shown). The change in the fluorescence of both retinoids when bound to rDvA-1L was reversed by the addition of oleic acid, indicating that the binding site for retinol was the same as, or sterically interactive with, that for fatty acids (data not shown). The far UV CD spectrum of rDvA-1L is illustrated in Fig. 5, and shows a strong α helix signal. Analysis of the data over the range 240 to 190 nm by the CONTIN procedure (15Provencher S.W. Glöckner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Google Scholar) yielded the following estimates of secondary structure: 53 ± 2%α-helix, 43 ± 2%β-sheet, and the remainder 4 ± 3%. In our experience, the application of the CONTIN procedure to proteins with a significant content of α-helix can overestimate the β-sheet content considerably(26White M.F. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 743-748Google Scholar). This is presumably a consequence of the smaller signals which arise from β-sheet compared with α-helix and the difficulties caused by noise observed below 195 nm. In such circumstances, however, the estimate of α-helix is fairly reliable. Addition of increasing concentrations of GdnHCl led to a progressive loss in secondary structure as detected by CD (Fig. 5, inset), with the midpoint of the unfolding occurring between 2 and 3 M GdnHCl. The predominance of helical structures within rDvA-1L sets it apart from the small FABPs of the β-barrel family. Acyl-coenzyme A-binding protein is known from crystal studies also to be predominately helical, but it does not bind free fatty acids(27Kragelund B.B. Andersen K.V. Madsen J.C. Knudsen J. Poulsen F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 1260-1277Google Scholar), the nucleotide group of the coenzyme being required to shield the aliphatic tail from the solvent environment. Some fatty acid-binding proteins, such as BSA, β-LG, and intestinal FABP have a tryptophan residue either within the binding cavity and involved in interaction with ligand, or in close proximity to this site (2Sacchettini J.C. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18399-18402Google Scholar, 3He X.M. Carter D.C Nature. 1992; 358: 209-215Google Scholar, 25Papiz M.Z. Sawyer L. Eliopoulos E.E. North A.C.T. Findlay J.B.C. Sivaprasadarao R. Jones T.A. Newcomer M.E. Kraulis P.J. Nature. 1986; 324: 383-385Google Scholar). DvA-1L and its homologs in other species of nematode have a single conserved tryptophan (Trp-15), the environment of which was examined here by fluorescence analysis. The intrinsic fluorescence spectrum of the protein excited in the region of 290 nm showed a sharp emission peak at 307 nm (probably due to tyrosine, of which there are five in DvA-1L) and a shoulder at 318 nm, presumably due to Trp-15 (Fig. 6). Emission by Trp-15 at such a short wavelength indicates that it is isolated from solvent water(28Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 672-680Google Scholar), and deeply buried within the protein's structure. In order to examine the alternative possibility that Trp-15 is instead surface proximal but in an environment in which solvent is excluded, or in which the side chain is under rotational constraint(28Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 672-680Google Scholar, 29Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3891-3899Google Scholar), the accessibility of Trp-15 to the water environment was further tested using quenching of fluorescence by succinimide at excitation and emission wavelengths of 295 and 330 nm, respectively, in order to examine the tryptophan selectively(29Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3891-3899Google Scholar). The results showed that addition of succinimide led to minimal quenching, confirming the highly buried position of the tryptophan. The Stern-Volmer coefficient (KSV) is much lower (0.12 M-1) than that for tryptophan residues in other proteins, such as phosphoglycerate mutase of Schizosacchromyces pombe (2.2 M-1) (13Johnson C.M. Price N.C. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 525-530Google Scholar) and pig heart citrate synthase (1.68 M-1). 2N. C. Price, unpublished observations. Increasing concentrations of GdnHCl, however, led to a red shift in the emission maximum corresponding to the increased exposure of the tryptophan with progressive denaturation of the protein (Fig. 6). In 6 M GdnHCl, the KSV for quenching by succinimide was 3.1 M-1, which is of the same order of magnitude as that of N-acetyltryptophanamide in 6 M GdnHCl (5.2 M-1)(30Moore J.D. Hawkins A.R. Charles I.G. Deka R. Coggins J.R. Cooper A. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 277-285Google Scholar). The major changes in the fluorescence spectrum occurred over the same range (2-3 M GdnHCl) as the most radical changes in the far UV CD spectrum (Fig. 5, inset), suggesting that the losses in secondary and tertiary structure ran largely in parallel. One of the possible reasons for the isolation of Trp-15 from solvent is its involvement in the fatty acid binding site of rDvA-1L. Intrinsic fluorescence spectra with excitation at 290 nm for BSA and β-LG, however, were found to peak at 345 and 336 nm, respectively, indicating that their Trp side chains are only partially excluded from water (data not shown). When oleic acid was added to each of these proteins, the fluorescence intensity of the Trp in β-LG increased (as previously reported; (31Frapin D. Dufour E. Haertle T. J. Protein Chem. 1993; 12: 443-449Google Scholar)), and decreased in BSA (data not shown). This is consistent with a change in the environment of the tryptophans due either to direct interaction with the ligand, a change in the conformation of the protein, or displacement of water from the binding site(32LaLonde J.M. Levenson M.A. Roe J.J. Bernlohr D.A. Banaszak L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25339-25347Google Scholar). In contrast, there was no such change in the spectrum upon addition of oleic acid to rDvA-1L (data not shown), so Trp-15 may not be involved in the binding site. DSC experiments on purified rDvA-1L in neutral buffers consistently showed a high temperature, endothermic thermal transition with midpoint at Tm = 98°C (Fig. 7). The shape of the curve indicated that more than one transition may have occurred. By deconvolution(17Cooper A. Johnson C.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 22: 109-150Google Scholar), the overall transition could be modelled in terms of two independent unfolding processes with Tmof 91 and 100°C, respectively, and ΔHcal for each transition in the region of 50-60 kcal mol-1. This might indicate the existence of two discrete domains within the structure, as reflected by the possible internal duplication which has been noted in the amino acid sequence of the 15-kDa units of NPAs(9Spence H.J. Moore J. Brass A. Kennedy M.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 7: 339-344Google Scholar). Repeated DSC scans showed that the major transition was largely reversible, even after heating to 110°C (Fig. 7). In contrast, control experiments with BSA and β-LG showed transition temperatures around 60-70°C, with no evidence of reversibility. The mechanism of ligand binding to the β-barrel family of FABPs and retinol-binding proteins is understood from crystal studies, and the NPAs such as DvA-1 present a potentially valuable system with which to investigate the binding of hydrophobic ligands to helical proteins. The stability of rDvA-1L bodes well for such studies and the availability of functionally active recombinant material also means that site-directed mutagenesis can be used to identify the crucial amino acid side chains involved in ligand binding and specificity, as has been done with members of the β-barrel family of FABPs(2Sacchettini J.C. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18399-18402Google Scholar). DvA-1L is unusual, if not unique, among products of polyproteins described to date in having lipid binding properties. The advantage to the parasite of this manner of synthesis is obscure but it would permit the efficient production of large quantities of binding proteins. This in turn emphasizes the importance to the organisms of acquisition of fatty acids and retinoids from the host, assuming that the binding propensities shown here are an accurate reflection of the natural condition. Another important consideration is that many anthelmintic drugs are hydrophobic and may therefore interact with DvA-1 and its homologs, and we are currently examining this using the fluorescence-based methods described here. Finally, in all cases examined, the NPAs appear to be released by parasitic nematodes cultured in vitro(6Culpepper J. Grieve R.B. Friedman L. Mika-Grieve M. Frank G.R. Dale B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 54: 51-62Google Scholar, 7Tweedie S. Paxton W.A. Ingram L. Maizels R.M. McReynolds L.A. Selkirk M.E. Exp. Parasitol. 1993; 76: 156-164Google Scholar, 33Kennedy M.W. Qureshi F. Immunology. 1986; 58: 515-522Google Scholar). Assuming that this also occurs in vivo, the binding of arachidonic acid may indicate that NPAs bind both it and its metabolites, and thereby modulate the local immunological and inflammatory environment. We are indebted to Alan B. McCruden for carrying out the FPLC analysis, Andy Brass for much useful discussion and for involvement in the productive collaboration which led to the suggestion that DvA-1L is a hydrophobic binding protein, and to Freya Kennedy for other assistance."

A purification of the enzyme polyphosphate kinase (E.C. 2.7.4.1) from this organism has been reported (Felter, S., and Stahl, A. J. C.(1973) Biochimie (Paris) 55, 245-251). The assay for activity used in this purification was the production of 32P-labeled nucleotide, presumed to be ATP, in the presence of [32P]polyphosphate and ADP. We have found that this assay does not reflect the activity of a polyphosphate kinase but rather the combination of an exopolyphosphatase, releasing free [32P]phosphate from the added [32P]polyphosphate, and the ADP-[32P]phosphate exchange activity of the enzyme diadenosine 5′,5‴-P1,P4-tetraphosphate α,β-phosphorylase (Ap4A phosphorylase). We also present direct evidence for the formation of an enzyme-AMP intermediate in the action of Ap4A phosphorylase. Polyphosphates are a major constituent of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

INTRODUCTIONInorganic polyphosphates (polyP) 1The abbreviations used are: polyPinorganic polyphosphatesPPKpolyphosphate kinaseAp4Adiadenosine-5′,5‴-tetraphosphatePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. are linear polymers of phosphate linked by phosphoanhydride bonds. PolyP has been detected in a wide range of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms (1Kulaev I.S. Vagabov V.M. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1983; 24: 83-171Google Scholar) and is particularly abundant in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in which it can constitute over 10% of the cellular dry weight(2Urech K. Dürr M. Boller T. Wiemken A. Arch. Microbiol. 1978; 116: 275-278Google Scholar). PolyP in yeast is predominantly localized to the vacuole(2Urech K. Dürr M. Boller T. Wiemken A. Arch. Microbiol. 1978; 116: 275-278Google Scholar).There are a number of possible biological functions for polyP in yeast. Foremost, it appears to act as a reservoir or buffer for phosphate. PolyP is hydrolyzed to mobilize free phosphate under conditions of low phosphate availability(3Dürr M. Urech K. Boller T. Wiemken A. Schwencke J. Nagy M. Arch. Microbiol. 1979; 121: 169-175Google Scholar, 4Nicolay K. Scheffers W.A. Bruinenberg P.M. Kaptein R. Arch. Microbiol. 1983; 134: 270-275Google Scholar), and it is produced in very large amounts when phosphate is provided to yeast after a period of phosphate starvation, a phenomenon known as “polyphosphate overcompensation” (3Dürr M. Urech K. Boller T. Wiemken A. Schwencke J. Nagy M. Arch. Microbiol. 1979; 121: 169-175Google Scholar, 5Harold F.M. Bacteriol. Rev. 1966; 30: 772-794Google Scholar). PolyP also appears to play a role in the regulation of cellular Ca2+ by chelating vacuolar Ca2+, thereby providing a Ca2+ sink(6Dunn T. Gable K. Beeler T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7273-7278Google Scholar). More generally, polyP is the major anion in the vacuolar lumen and thus is important for charge balance and osmoregulation in the vacuole, a storage compartment for many ions and metabolites in yeast(7Klionsky D.J. Herman P.K. Emr S.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 266-292Google Scholar). Other possible physiological functions of polyP in yeast remain to be elucidated.There have been numerous observations made over the years of the effects of various physiological factors on the polyP pools in yeast. These factors include phosphate levels(3Dürr M. Urech K. Boller T. Wiemken A. Schwencke J. Nagy M. Arch. Microbiol. 1979; 121: 169-175Google Scholar, 4Nicolay K. Scheffers W.A. Bruinenberg P.M.

Raffard G. Canioni P. Guerin B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11212-11220Google Scholar), and supply of basic amino acids (3Dürr M. Urech K. Boller T. Wiemken A. Schwencke J. Nagy M. Arch. Microbiol. 1979; 121: 169-175Google Scholar). The effects on the polyP pools are presumably mediated by effects on the expression or activity of enzymes involved in polyP metabolism. Yet, without a knowledge of these enzymes, no unified picture of polyP function and regulation in yeast has emerged. Three yeast exopolyphosphatases, which catalyze the progressive hydrolysis of polyP to inorganic phosphate, have recently been purified to homogeneity (14Andreeva N.A. Okorokov L.A. Yeast. 1993; 9: 127-139Google Scholar, 15Wurst H. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10996-11001Google Scholar, 16Lorenz B. Müller W.E.G. Kulaev I.S. Schröder H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22198-22204Google Scholar). However, the enzymatic basis of synthesis of polyP in yeast remains unclear.The only well characterized pathway for polyP synthesis in any organism is via the enzyme polyphosphate kinase (PPK), which catalyzes the following reaction(17Kornberg A. Kornberg S.R. Simms E.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1956; 20: 215-227Google Scholar): polyPn+ATP↔PPKpolyPn+1+ADP(Eq. 1) PPK activity has been observed in several microorganisms(18Wood H.G. Clark J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 235-260Google Scholar, 19Tinsley C.R. Manjula B.N. Gotschlich E.C. Infect. Immunol. 1993; 61: 3703-3710Google Scholar), and the enzymology of polyP synthesis has received growing attention with the purification of PPKs from Escherichia coli and Neisseria meningitidis(19Tinsley C.R. Manjula B.N. Gotschlich E.C. Infect. Immunol. 1993; 61: 3703-3710Google Scholar, 20Ahn K. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11734-11739Google Scholar). The gene encoding E. coli PPK has also recently been sequenced(21Akiyama M. Crooke E. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22556-22561Google Scholar).The purification of an enzyme identified as a polyphosphate kinase from a soluble extract of yeast cells has been reported(22Felter S. Stahl A.J.C. Biochimie (Paris). 1973; 55: 245-251Google Scholar). This is the only report to date of a purification of PPK from yeast, and it is widely cited(1Kulaev I.S. Vagabov V.M. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1983; 24: 83-171Google Scholar, 4Nicolay K. Scheffers W.A. Bruinenberg P.M. Kaptein R. Arch. Microbiol. 1983; 134: 270-275Google Scholar, 15Wurst H. Kornberg A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 11734-11739Google Scholar, 23Shabalin Y.A. Vagabov V.M. Tsiomenko A.B. Zemlenukhina O.A. Kulaev I.S. Biochemistry (USSR). 1977; 42: 1291-1296Google Scholar). The enzyme purified was found to be active for the reverse reaction, synthesis of ATP from polyP, but not the forward reaction. This stands in contrast to PPKs that have been purified from other organisms, which are active in both directions (20Ahn K. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11734-11739Google Scholar, 24Robinson N.A. Wood H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4481-4485Google Scholar). This property of the purified enzyme has led to the suggestion that polyP may play a role as an energy store in yeast by acting as a source of ATP(4Nicolay K. Scheffers W.A. Bruinenberg P.M. Kaptein R. Arch. Microbiol. 1983; 134: 270-275Google Scholar, 22Felter S. Stahl A.J.C. Biochimie (Paris). 1973; 55: 245-251Google Scholar, 25Felter S. Stahl A.J.C. Bull. Soc. Chim. Biol. 1970; 52: 75-87Google Scholar), though in vivo experiments had previously argued against such a role(5Harold F.M. Bacteriol. Rev. 1966; 30: 772-794Google Scholar). Moreover, this finding suggests two possibilities for polyP synthesis in yeast. Either polyP synthesis is due to PPK, but some factor required for polyP synthesis was absent in the in vitro experiments, or alternatively, other routes for polyP synthesis exist in yeast.To better understand polyP metabolism and function in yeast, we attempted to repurify the putative yeast PPK following the protocol of Felter and Stahl (22Felter S. Stahl A.J.C. Biochimie (Paris). 1973; 55: 245-251Google Scholar) and using the same assay for activity, namely the production of 32P-labeled nucleotide (presumed to be ATP) in the presence of [32P]polyP and ADP. We found the activity thus assayed and purified was not due to a PPK but rather to the enzyme diadenosine-5′,5‴-P1,P4-tetraphosphate α,β-phosphorylase (Ap4A phosphorylase)(26Guranowski A. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3542-3547Google Scholar), acting in concert with one or more of the yeast polyphosphatases.DISCUSSIONA number of points from the report of the apparent purification of yeast PPK may be addressed in light of the identification of the activity as Ap4A phosphorylase. Most important, the previous investigators were unable to observe substantial PPK activity in the opposite direction, i.e. synthesis of polyP from ATP. They reported that no more than 4% of radioactivity added as [γ-32P]ATP could be incorporated into a fraction that was attributed to polyphosphate. This fraction was characterized solely as radioactivity that was not adsorbed by charcoal and that was precipitated by BaCl2 at pH 2. Since no further analysis was conducted to demonstrate that this radioactivity actually was in polyP, we believe that it most likely represents a nonspecific background. The difficulty in observing polyP synthesis is explained by the fact that the activity being assayed in the protein preparation is not in fact polyphosphate kinase. The inference, based on this apparent irreversibility, that PPK in yeast acts primarily in the direction of ATP synthesis(22Felter S. Stahl A.J.C. Biochimie (Paris). 1973; 55: 245-251Google Scholar, 25Felter S. Stahl A.J.C. Bull. Soc. Chim. Biol. 1970; 52: 75-87Google Scholar), is thus unsupported. Previous in vivo experiments were unable to detect direct synthesis of ATP from polyP in yeast cells, suggesting that polyP is not used as an energy store by yeast(5Harold F.M. Bacteriol. Rev. 1966; 30: 772-794Google Scholar).Furthermore, it was reported that the supposed PPK activity was inhibited in a competitive manner by phosphate(22Felter S. Stahl A.J.C. Biochimie (Paris). 1973; 55: 245-251Google Scholar). This is explained by the demonstration that phosphate is actually the substrate of the exchange reaction being observed; addition of unlabeled phosphate will dilute the radioactivity of the released [32P]Pi, giving the appearance of competitive inhibition. In fact, phosphate stimulates the activity of most of the polyphosphate kinases that have been characterized(19Tinsley C.R. Manjula B.N. Gotschlich E.C. Infect. Immunol. 1993; 61: 3703-3710Google Scholar, 24Robinson N.A. Wood H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4481-4485Google Scholar, 33Li H.-C. Brown G.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 53: 875-881Google Scholar, 34Levinson S.L. Jacobs L.H. Krulwich T.A. Li H.-C. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1975; 88: 75-85Google Scholar). This may reflect a mechanistic requirement for phosphate to act as a primer or an allosteric effect(19Tinsley C.R. Manjula B.N. Gotschlich E.C. Infect. Immunol. 1993; 61: 3703-3710Google Scholar). Given the role of polyP as a phosphate store, a stimulation of PPK by phosphate would provide a direct means of inducing polyP synthesis in response to high phosphate levels(33Li H.-C. Brown G.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 53: 875-881Google Scholar). The large burst of polyP synthesis in yeast vacuoles during polyphosphate overcompensation is in fact preceded by a rapid increase in vacuolar phosphate concentration(9Bourne R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1067: 81-88Google Scholar).In the case of Ap4A phosphorylase acting in the direction of Ap4A synthesis, the enzyme performs a nucleotidyl transfer to the 5′-phosphate of a nucleotide acceptor, namely ATP. In this respect, its action is similar to that of the guanylyltransferases of eukaryotic mRNA capping enzymes, though Ap4A phosphorylase is unusual in that it uses ADP as an adenylyl donor. As in the Ap4A phosphorylase reaction in which the enzyme is reversibly adenylylated, the RNA capping reaction proceeds via guanylylation of the guanylyltransferase(35Fresco L.D. Buratowski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6624-6628Google Scholar). In the enzyme-GMP intermediate, the GMP is attached to the ε-amino group of a lysine, as is also the case for RNA and DNA ligases. An attachment motif common to both classes of enzymes has been identified, consisting of KXBG(35Fresco L.D. Buratowski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6624-6628Google Scholar). It is possible that the Ap4A phosphorylases act via a similar mechanism. Examination of the sequence of the APA2 gene reveals the presence of this motif, and the region containing the motif shows some similarity to the region surrounding the attachment motif in the RNA-capping guanylyltransferase CEG1 of S. cerevisiae: A tyrosine or phenylalanine appears four residues upstream of the conserved lysine in the guanylyltransferases and is also present in APA2.While yeast has been an organism in which many studies of polyphosphate metabolism have been conducted, no polyphosphate kinase from yeast has yet been purified. A small amount of PPK activity was reported to be detected in yeast vacuoles(23Shabalin Y.A. Vagabov V.M. Tsiomenko A.B. Zemlenukhina O.A. Kulaev I.S. Biochemistry (USSR). 1977; 42: 1291-1296Google Scholar), but it remains to be determined whether a PPK is responsible for the synthesis of the large vacuolar polyP pool or whether alternative or multiple synthetic routes may exist(36Shabalin Y.A. Kulaev I.S. Biochemistry (USSR). 1989; 54: 50-55Google Scholar). Identification of the enzymes involved in polyP synthesis in yeast will shed light on the metabolism and physiological functions of polyP and may suggest mechanisms of polyP synthesis in other eukaryotes.

This property of the purified enzyme has led to the suggestion that polyP may play a role as an energy store in yeast by acting as a source of ATP(4Nicolay K. Scheffers W.A. Bruinenberg P.M. Kaptein R. Arch. Microbiol. 1983; 134: 270-275Google Scholar, 22Felter S. Stahl A.J.C. Biochimie (Paris). 1973; 55: 245-251Google Scholar, 25Felter S. Stahl A.J.C. Bull. Soc. Chim. Biol. 1970; 52: 75-87Google Scholar), though in vivo experiments had previously argued against such a role(5Harold F.M. Bacteriol. Rev. 1966; 30: 772-794Google Scholar). Moreover, this finding suggests two possibilities for polyP synthesis in yeast. Either polyP synthesis is due to PPK, but some factor required for polyP synthesis was absent in the in vitro experiments, or alternatively, other routes for polyP synthesis exist in yeast.To better understand polyP metabolism and function in yeast, we attempted to repurify the putative yeast PPK following the protocol of Felter and Stahl (22Felter S. Stahl A.J.C. Biochimie (Paris). 1973; 55: 245-251Google Scholar) and using the same assay for activity, namely the production of 32P-labeled nucleotide (presumed to be ATP) in the presence of [32P]polyP and ADP. We found the activity thus assayed and purified was not due to a PPK but rather to the enzyme diadenosine-5′,5‴-P1,P4-tetraphosphate α,β-phosphorylase (Ap4A phosphorylase)(26Guranowski A. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3542-3547Google Scholar), acting in concert with one or more of the yeast polyphosphatases. Inorganic polyphosphates (polyP) 1The abbreviations used are: polyPinorganic polyphosphatesPPKpolyphosphate kinaseAp4Adiadenosine-5′,5‴-tetraphosphatePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. are linear polymers of phosphate linked by phosphoanhydride bonds. PolyP has been detected in a wide range of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms (1Kulaev I.S. Vagabov V.M. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1983; 24: 83-171Google Scholar) and is particularly abundant in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in which it can constitute over 10% of the cellular dry weight(2Urech K. Dürr M. Boller T. Wiemken A. Arch. Microbiol. 1978; 116: 275-278Google Scholar). PolyP in yeast is predominantly localized to the vacuole(2Urech K. Dürr M. Boller T. Wiemken A. Arch. Microbiol. 1978; 116: 275-278Google Scholar). inorganic polyphosphates polyphosphate kinase diadenosine-5′,5‴-tetraphosphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. There are a number of possible biological functions for polyP in yeast. Foremost, it appears to act as a reservoir or buffer for phosphate. PolyP is hydrolyzed to mobilize free phosphate under conditions of low phosphate availability(3Dürr M. Urech K. Boller T. Wiemken A. Schwencke J. Nagy M. Arch. Microbiol. 1979; 121: 169-175Google Scholar, 4Nicolay K. Scheffers W.A. Bruinenberg P.M. Kaptein R. Arch. Microbiol. 1983; 134: 270-275Google Scholar), and it is produced in very large amounts when phosphate is provided to yeast after a period of phosphate starvation, a phenomenon known as “polyphosphate overcompensation” (3Dürr M. Urech K. Boller T. Wiemken A. Schwencke J. Nagy M. Arch. Microbiol. 1979; 121: 169-175Google Scholar, 5Harold F.M. Bacteriol. Rev. 1966; 30: 772-794Google Scholar). PolyP also appears to play a role in the regulation of cellular Ca2+ by chelating vacuolar Ca2+, thereby providing a Ca2+ sink(6Dunn T. Gable K. Beeler T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7273-7278Google Scholar). More generally, polyP is the major anion in the vacuolar lumen and thus is important for charge balance and osmoregulation in the vacuole, a storage compartment for many ions and metabolites in yeast(7Klionsky D.J. Herman P.K. Emr S.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 266-292Google Scholar). Other possible physiological functions of polyP in yeast remain to be elucidated. There have been numerous observations made over the years of the effects of various physiological factors on the polyP pools in yeast. These factors include phosphate levels(3Dürr M. Urech K. Boller T. Wiemken A. Schwencke J. Nagy M. Arch. Microbiol. 1979; 121: 169-175Google Scholar, 4Nicolay K. Scheffers W.A. Bruinenberg P.M. Kaptein R. Arch.

Microbiol. 1979; 121: 169-175Google Scholar). The effects on the polyP pools are presumably mediated by effects on the expression or activity of enzymes involved in polyP metabolism. Yet, without a knowledge of these enzymes, no unified picture of polyP function and regulation in yeast has emerged. Three yeast exopolyphosphatases, which catalyze the progressive hydrolysis of polyP to inorganic phosphate, have recently been purified to homogeneity (14Andreeva N.A. Okorokov L.A. Yeast. 1993; 9: 127-139Google Scholar, 15Wurst H. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10996-11001Google Scholar, 16Lorenz B. Müller W.E.G. Kulaev I.S. Schröder H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22198-22204Google Scholar). However, the enzymatic basis of synthesis of polyP in yeast remains unclear. The only well characterized pathway for polyP synthesis in any organism is via the enzyme polyphosphate kinase (PPK), which catalyzes the following reaction(17Kornberg A. Kornberg S.R. Simms E.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1956; 20: 215-227Google Scholar): polyPn+ATP↔PPKpolyPn+1+ADP(Eq. 1) PPK activity has been observed in several microorganisms(18Wood H.G. Clark J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 235-260Google Scholar, 19Tinsley C.R. Manjula B.N. Gotschlich E.C. Infect. Immunol. 1993; 61: 3703-3710Google Scholar), and the enzymology of polyP synthesis has received growing attention with the purification of PPKs from Escherichia coli and Neisseria meningitidis(19Tinsley C.R. Manjula B.N. Gotschlich E.C. Infect. Immunol. 1993; 61: 3703-3710Google Scholar, 20Ahn K. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11734-11739Google Scholar). The gene encoding E. coli PPK has also recently been sequenced(21Akiyama M. Crooke E. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22556-22561Google Scholar). The purification of an enzyme identified as a polyphosphate kinase from a soluble extract of yeast cells has been reported(22Felter S. Stahl A.J.C. Biochimie (Paris). 1973; 55: 245-251Google Scholar). This is the only report to date of a purification of PPK from yeast, and it is widely cited(1Kulaev I.S. Vagabov V.M. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1983; 24: 83-171Google Scholar, 4Nicolay K. Scheffers W.A. Bruinenberg P.M. Kaptein R. Arch. Microbiol. 1983; 134: 270-275Google Scholar, 15Wurst H. Kornberg A. J. Biol.

The enzyme purified was found to be active for the reverse reaction, synthesis of ATP from polyP, but not the forward reaction. This stands in contrast to PPKs that have been purified from other organisms, which are active in both directions (20Ahn K. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11734-11739Google Scholar, 24Robinson N.A. Wood H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4481-4485Google Scholar). This property of the purified enzyme has led to the suggestion that polyP may play a role as an energy store in yeast by acting as a source of ATP(4Nicolay K. Scheffers W.A. Bruinenberg P.M. Kaptein R. Arch. Microbiol. 1983; 134: 270-275Google Scholar, 22Felter S. Stahl A.J.C. Biochimie (Paris). 1973; 55: 245-251Google Scholar, 25Felter S. Stahl A.J.C. Bull. Soc. Chim.

We found the activity thus assayed and purified was not due to a PPK but rather to the enzyme diadenosine-5′,5‴-P1,P4-tetraphosphate α,β-phosphorylase (Ap4A phosphorylase)(26Guranowski A. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3542-3547Google Scholar), acting in concert with one or more of the yeast polyphosphatases. DISCUSSIONA number of points from the report of the apparent purification of yeast PPK may be addressed in light of the identification of the activity as Ap4A phosphorylase. Most important, the previous investigators were unable to observe substantial PPK activity in the opposite direction, i.e. synthesis of polyP from ATP. They reported that no more than 4% of radioactivity added as [γ-32P]ATP could be incorporated into a fraction that was attributed to polyphosphate. This fraction was characterized solely as radioactivity that was not adsorbed by charcoal and that was precipitated by BaCl2 at pH 2. Since no further analysis was conducted to demonstrate that this radioactivity actually was in polyP, we believe that it most likely represents a nonspecific background. The difficulty in observing polyP synthesis is explained by the fact that the activity being assayed in the protein preparation is not in fact polyphosphate kinase. The inference, based on this apparent irreversibility, that PPK in yeast acts primarily in the direction of ATP synthesis(22Felter S. Stahl A.J.C. Biochimie (Paris). 1973; 55: 245-251Google Scholar, 25Felter S. Stahl A.J.C. Bull. Soc. Chim. Biol. 1970; 52: 75-87Google Scholar), is thus unsupported. Previous in vivo experiments were unable to detect direct synthesis of ATP from polyP in yeast cells, suggesting that polyP is not used as an energy store by yeast(5Harold F.M. Bacteriol. Rev. 1966; 30: 772-794Google Scholar).Furthermore, it was reported that the supposed PPK activity was inhibited in a competitive manner by phosphate(22Felter S. Stahl A.J.C. Biochimie (Paris). 1973; 55: 245-251Google Scholar). This is explained by the demonstration that phosphate is actually the substrate of the exchange reaction being observed; addition of unlabeled phosphate will dilute the radioactivity of the released [32P]Pi, giving the appearance of competitive inhibition. In fact, phosphate stimulates the activity of most of the polyphosphate kinases that have been characterized(19Tinsley C.R. Manjula B.N. Gotschlich E.C. Infect. Immunol. 1993; 61: 3703-3710Google Scholar, 24Robinson N.A. Wood H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4481-4485Google Scholar, 33Li H.-C. Brown G.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 53: 875-881Google Scholar, 34Levinson S.L. Jacobs L.H. Krulwich T.A. Li H.-C. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1975; 88: 75-85Google Scholar). This may reflect a mechanistic requirement for phosphate to act as a primer or an allosteric effect(19Tinsley C.R. Manjula B.N. Gotschlich E.C. Infect. Immunol. 1993; 61: 3703-3710Google Scholar). Given the role of polyP as a phosphate store, a stimulation of PPK by phosphate would provide a direct means of inducing polyP synthesis in response to high phosphate levels(33Li H.-C. Brown G.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 53: 875-881Google Scholar). The large burst of polyP synthesis in yeast vacuoles during polyphosphate overcompensation is in fact preceded by a rapid increase in vacuolar phosphate concentration(9Bourne R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1067: 81-88Google Scholar).In the case of Ap4A phosphorylase acting in the direction of Ap4A synthesis, the enzyme performs a nucleotidyl transfer to the 5′-phosphate of a nucleotide acceptor, namely ATP. In this respect, its action is similar to that of the guanylyltransferases of eukaryotic mRNA capping enzymes, though Ap4A phosphorylase is unusual in that it uses ADP as an adenylyl donor. As in the Ap4A phosphorylase reaction in which the enzyme is reversibly adenylylated, the RNA capping reaction proceeds via guanylylation of the guanylyltransferase(35Fresco L.D. Buratowski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6624-6628Google Scholar). In the enzyme-GMP intermediate, the GMP is attached to the ε-amino group of a lysine, as is also the case for RNA and DNA ligases. An attachment motif common to both classes of enzymes has been identified, consisting of KXBG(35Fresco L.D. Buratowski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6624-6628Google Scholar). It is possible that the Ap4A phosphorylases act via a similar mechanism. Examination of the sequence of the APA2 gene reveals the presence of this motif, and the region containing the motif shows some similarity to the region surrounding the attachment motif in the RNA-capping guanylyltransferase CEG1 of S. cerevisiae: A tyrosine or phenylalanine appears four residues upstream of the conserved lysine in the guanylyltransferases and is also present in APA2.While yeast has been an organism in which many studies of polyphosphate metabolism have been conducted, no polyphosphate kinase from yeast has yet been purified. A small amount of PPK activity was reported to be detected in yeast vacuoles(23Shabalin Y.A. Vagabov V.M. Tsiomenko A.B. Zemlenukhina O.A. Kulaev I.S. Biochemistry (USSR). 1977; 42: 1291-1296Google Scholar), but it remains to be determined whether a PPK is responsible for the synthesis of the large vacuolar polyP pool or whether alternative or multiple synthetic routes may exist(36Shabalin Y.A. Kulaev I.S. Biochemistry (USSR). 1989; 54: 50-55Google Scholar). Identification of the enzymes involved in polyP synthesis in yeast will shed light on the metabolism and physiological functions of polyP and may suggest mechanisms of polyP synthesis in other eukaryotes.

The presence of an amino-terminal signal peptide earmarks the protein for insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum from where it is targeted to the plasma membrane via the Golgi apparatus. Many polytopic membrane proteins, however, do not contain cleavable amino termini that can be identified as a signal peptide, yet they are correctly targeted to the plasma membrane(1von Heijne G. J.

It is thought that transmembrane segments in these proteins have targeting information.

Partial sequencing, however, of the amino terminus of the purified bovine cardiac Na+-Ca2+ exchanger indicated that the first amino acid of this protein corresponds to amino acid number 33 of the cloned gene(14Durkin J.T. Ahrens D.C. Pan Y.-C.E. Reeves J.P. ArchBiochem. Biophys. 1991; 290: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Hence it was suggested that the first putative transmembrane α helix (amino acids 1-24) and the next eight amino acids (25-32) that precede the amino terminus (amino acid 33), constitute a signal peptide that is presumably cleaved and hence not detectable in the “mature” protein. In this work, we have examined the importance of the putative signal peptide of the cloned Na+-Ca2+ exchanger gene in functional expression of the transporter. Our studies indicate that neither the hydrophobic core of the putative signal peptide nor the following eight amino acids, which were suggested to be part of the putative signal peptidase cleavage site, are mandatory for functional expression of Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity. rat brain exchanger endoplasmic reticulum. rat brain exchanger endoplasmic reticulum. Truncation of clone RBE-1 (9Furman I. Cook O. Kasir J. Rahamimoff H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 319: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) has been carried out by the method of Kunkel(15Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar). Appropriate phosphorylated antisense primers were annealed to the uracil-containing single-stranded DNA derived from RBE-1. The primers were typically 30-40-mer long and flanking (about half of the nucleotides upstream and the other half downstream) the desired deletion. Synthesis of second strand was carried out in vitro using T4 DNA polymerase and T4 DNA ligase. Selection of mutant plasmids was based on sequencing of the segment containing the mutation. To ensure that no other mutations beyond the planned occurred, either a 0.4-kilobase pair HindIII-NcoI fragment (N21, N26, or N31) or a 0.4-kilobase pair SalI-NcoI fragment (Ala-32 → Asp) containing the desired mutation was subcloned into a corresponding HindIII-NcoI- or SalI-NcoI-digested wild-type RBE-1. The entire subcloned fragment including the ligation sites were fully sequenced. The following antisense primers (5′to3′) were used: CAACATGGGTAAACAACATGTTGTACAATGAG(N21); CTGCAGTTATATGGTCCATGTTGTACAATGAG(N26); TTTCTGCCTCTGTATCCATGTTGTACAATGAG(N31); TTCTGCCTCTGTATCATCAGTTATATGGTCAAC (Ala-32 → Asp). Plasmid preparations were carried out by standard procedures (16Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.38-1.41-7.43-7.45Google Scholar) or with the Wizard®174; Promega plasmid preparation kit. Sequencing was carried out by the dideoxy method (17Sanger F. Nicken S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52756) Google Scholar) using the Sequenase II kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Transient expression of the wild-type cloned (in pBluescript) rat brain Na+-Ca2+ exchanger gene RBE-1 and its mutants in HeLa or L-cells was done essentially as described in (8Low W. Kasir J. Rahamimoff H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 316: 63-67Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and (9Furman I. Cook O. Kasir J. Rahamimoff H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 319: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). 2.5 × 105 cells/well in a 24-well culture plate or 5 × 106 cells/90-mm Petri dish or 12.5 × 106 cells/135-mm Petri dish were transfected with 1.5, 15, or 37.5 μg of plasmid DNA, respectively. Dotap (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) was used for transfection. Prior to transfection, the cells were infected with the recombinant vaccinia virus VTF-7(18Blakely R.D. Clark J.A. Rudnik G. Amara S. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Expression of transport activity was determined 16-17 h following transfection as described previously (8Low W. Kasir J. Rahamimoff H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 316: 63-67Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 9Furman I. Cook O. Kasir J. Rahamimoff H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 319: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Culture media were obtained from Biological Industries, Beit Haemek, Israel. For determination of transport activity in whole cells, these were preincubated for 10 min with 0.14 M NaCl, 0.01 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, after which they were exposed to 45Ca2+ in either 0.01 M Tris-HCl-buffered 0.14 M NaCl or 0.14 M KCl. The reactions were stopped by aspiration of the uptake media and two washes with 0.14 M KCl at 4°C, after which the cells were solubilized with 0.3 N NaOH, neutralized with 0.2 M NaPi, pH 4.5, and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Net Na+ gradient-dependent Ca2+ uptake was calculated by subtraction of the amount of 45Ca2+ associated with the cells in the presence of external NaCl (no gradient) from the amount of 45Ca2+ associated with the cells in the presence of external KCl. Each measurement was done in triplicate. For reconstitution experiments, cells were harvested and dissolved in a solution containing 0.2 M NaPi, pH 7.4, 2% cholate, and 15-20 mg/ml brain phospholipids as described previously(8Low W. Kasir J. Rahamimoff H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 316: 63-67Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 9Furman I. Cook O. Kasir J. Rahamimoff H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 319: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Reconstitution and determination of Na+ gradient-dependent Ca2+ uptake was done as in (19Barzilai A. Rahamimoff H. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6113-6118Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Protein was determined by the method of Lowry et al.(20Lowry O.H. Rosebrough V.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The TNT®174; mRNA-free combined transcription/translation reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) was used. To detect protein synthesis, [35S]methionine (Amersham Corp., SJ1515) was added to the lysate. The manufacturer's instructions were followed with fidelity, except that the K+ concentration was increased by 40 mM. When stated, dog microsomes (Promega) were added to the lysate (2 μl of microsomes/25 μl of final volume of lysate reaction mixture). The proteins synthesized were analyzed on SDS-containing polyacrylamide gels(21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207487) Google Scholar). The acrylamide and N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide concentrations were reduced to 5 and 0.125%, respectively. 8 M urea was always added to the sample buffer, otherwise the proteins synthesized in the lysate aggregated and did not enter the gel. To evaluate the extent of the glycosylation by the microsomes, translation products were treated with peptide N-glycosidase F (New England BioLabs), and the size of the proteins synthesized before and after the treatment was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (see above). Peptide N-glycosidase treatment was carried out as specified by the manufacturer, and it involved boiling for 10 min in 0.5% SDS, 1%β-mercaptoethanol and addition of Nonidet P-40 to a final concentration of 1%. Total RNA was extracted from 17 h postinfected/transfected HeLa cells, using the TRI®174; reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc. Cincinnati OH). RNA separation using formaldehyde-containing 1% agarose gels was carried out by standard procedures(16Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.38-1.41-7.43-7.45Google Scholar). Following electrophoresis, the gels were soaked in 0.5 N NaOH and then in 20 × SSC, after which the denatured RNA was transferred to nitrocellulose by capillary elution. Hybridization was carried out in 50% formamide buffer overnight at 53°C. As probes, we have used either a [α-32P]dCTP-labeled polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA fragment of 863 base pairs corresponding to nucleotides 1936-2799 of the cloned exchanger gene or a [γ-32P]ATP-labeled 53-mer synthetic antisense oligonucleotide corresponding to nucleotides 14-67 (the numbering refers to the open reading frame of the cloned exchanger RBE-1) of the following sequence: 5′-AGAGAGCCACCAGAGTTACCAGACGAAATCCCATTGAAACATTGGGTGGGAGAC-3′. Labeling of the 863-base pair probe was done by random priming using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase, and that of the oligonucleotide with T4 polynucleotide kinase. Quantitative densitometric analysis of the Northern blots was done with the Fuji thermal imager FTI 500 using the Macintosh program Image. Transfected HeLa cells were rinsed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, scraped from the 135-mm culture dish with a rubber policeman, and divided into three parts. One part was used for determination of expression of Na+ gradient-dependent Ca2+ transport activity. The second part was pelleted, suspended in a minimal volume of phosphate-buffered saline, clarified by a 10-s sonication, and used without further treatment. This total cell extract contained the entire repertoire of proteins produced in the transfected HeLa cells. The third part was suspended in 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 0.02 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and subfractionated by differential centrifugation into a plasma membrane-enriched fraction P30, sedimenting at 30,000 × g and an endoplasmic reticulum-enriched fraction P100 sedimenting at 100,000 × g. From each fraction an aliquot was kept for the determination of protein. The different fractions were separated by SDS-containing gel electrophoresis (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207487) Google Scholar) and transfered electrophoretically by standard procedures to nitrocellulose(22Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 490-491-4978-79Google Scholar). As primary antibody, we have used antiserum (AbO-8) obtained from a rabbit immunized with a synthetic pentadecapeptide derived from amino acids 645-659 (9Furman I. Cook O. Kasir J. Rahamimoff H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 319: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) of the cloned rat brain exchanger RBE-1. The peptide was coupled to large nonimmunogenic carriers keyhole limpets hemocyanin, bovine serum albumin, and thyroglobulin using glutaraldehyde(22Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 490-491-4978-79Google Scholar). Each subsequent injection of the peptide was done with a different carrier. Antibody production was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay first against the peptide and then against transfected HeLa cells. Mock transfected cells, with pBluescript were used as controls. For Western blots, the antiserum was purified by preadsorption on HeLa cells. This was done by incubating the antiserum with the cells at a dilution of 1:20 (in 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% NaN3 in phosphate-buffered saline) for 60 min at 25°C, after which the cells were sedimented and discarded. Usually, confluent cells harvested from a 25-ml culture flask were used for each ml of diluted antiserum. Before use, the purified antiserum was further diluted in 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% NaN3 in phosphate-buffered saline to a final dilution of 1:500. 125I-Protein A (DuPont NEN) was used as a secondary antibody. Quantitative analysis of the protein profile was carried out with the Fujix Bas 1000 PhosphorImager using the Tina 2.06 analysis program. The plasma membrane fraction was characterized by measuring the specific activity of 5′-AMP nucleotidase. In the P30 fraction, the specific activity of the enzyme increased between 3- and 6-fold in different preparations over the total cell extract and about 15-fold over the P100 fraction. In order to investigate the role of the amino-terminal segment of the cloned exchanger gene RBE-1 in functional expression of Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity, we have prepared three amino-terminal deletion mutants of the protein: N21, N26, and N31 (see Table1). All of the deletions conserved the initiating methionine. Mutant N21, in which we have deleted the initial 21 amino acids beyond the initiating methionine, was designed to test the role of the hydrophobic core of the putative signal peptide in functional expression. The deletion of amino acids 2-21, removed most of the hydrophobic core of the amino-terminal segment and the two positive charges within it that are thought to be important in the interaction with the negatively charged surface of the inner membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum(24Jain R.G. Rusch S.L. Kendall D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16305-16310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In mutant N26, we had deleted amino acids 2-27. This deletion included the entire hydrophobic segment of the putative signal peptide (amino acids 2-24), and three of the amino acids that presumably form part of the putative signal peptidase recognition and cleavage site(24Jain R.G. Rusch S.L. Kendall D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16305-16310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1403) Google Scholar). The longest truncation was done in mutant N31, in which all of the amino acids between the initiating methionine and the putative amino-terminal aspartic acid were deleted. This mutant lacks the entire putative signal peptide and the putative signal peptidase cleavage site.TABLE I Open table in a new tab All of the amino-terminal mutants were expressed transiently in HeLa cells using the recombinant vaccinia virus VTF-7 expression system (18Blakely R.D. Clark J.A. Rudnik G. Amara S. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The wild-type exchanger (clone RBE-1) was always expressed in parallel to the mutant exchangers. Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity was determined in “whole cells” exactly as described previously(8Low W. Kasir J. Rahamimoff H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 316: 63-67Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 9Furman I. Cook O. Kasir J. Rahamimoff H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 319: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 summarizes the results obtained. In Fig. 1A, Na+ gradient dependent Ca2+ uptake of the three amino-terminal mutants N21, N26, and N31 in whole cells is shown. Since the expression of transport activity varied in different transfection experiments, the numerical value of the average steady state rate of Na+ gradient-dependent Ca2+ uptake (nmol of Ca2+ transported/mg of HeLa cell protein) of the wild-type exchanger RBE-1 in each experiment has been defined as 100%, and the transport activity of the mutant clones is presented in relative values. Fig. 1B, shows the numerical value of the average Ca2+ transport activity in these experiments (n = 12), of the wild-type exchanger RBE-1 in the presence (dottedbar) and in the absence (clearbar) of a driving Na+ gradient (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”). Net Na+ gradient-dependent Ca2+ uptake is calculated by subtracting the amount of Ca2+ transported in the absence of a driving Na+ gradient from that obtained in its presence. It should be also noted, that no endogenous Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity could be detected in infected/nontransfected HeLa cells (8Low W. Kasir J. Rahamimoff H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 316: 63-67Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 9Furman I. Cook O. Kasir J. Rahamimoff H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 319: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) or infected/control plasmid (pBluescript SK) (mock) transfected cells. From the data presented in Fig. 1A, it can be seen that the expression of transport activity of N21 is similar to that of the wild-type clone RBE-1, suggesting that the hydrophobic core of the putative signal peptide does not seem to play a significant role in functional expression of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger. Determination of the transport activity of whole HeLa cells transfected with N26 and N31 revealed that these mutants are functional as well. Na+ gradient-dependent Ca2+ transport activity of these mutants was 35.4% (S.D. = 5.3) and 60.06% (S.D. = 8.48) of that of the wild-type exchanger. Although the expression of transport activity of these amino-terminally truncated mutants is somewhat lower than that of the wild-type clone, the results suggest that mutant protein is synthesized and is inserted in functional form into the plasma membrane. Functional expression of amino-terminal truncated mutants of the cloned Na+-Ca2+ exchanger gene is not restricted to HeLa cells, since transfection of L-cells with the same mutant exchangers resulted in functional expression similar to that obtained in HeLa cells. Relative to the wild-type exchanger RBE-1, 65, 43, and 38.3% of the Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity was obtained when L-cells were transfected with the truncated mutants N21, N26, and N31, respectively (data not shown). There are several ways to explain the somewhat lower transport activity of the truncated mutants N26 and N31 relative to the wild-type exchanger. One explanation could be that these mutants have an impaired trafficking machinery to the plasma membrane. To test this hypothesis, we reconstituted into brain phospholipids the proteins expressed in wild-type and mutant Na+-Ca2+ exchanger-transfected HeLa cells and examined their transport activity. Our rationale was that by solubilization of the transfected cells and reconstitution of the proteins into proteoliposomes, the presence of intracellular Na+-Ca2+ exchangers that were completed but not targeted to the plasma membrane would be revealed. If the proportion of these nontargeted Na+-Ca2+ exchangers within HeLa cells transfected with the mutant exchangers, N26 and N31 is significant, transport activity following reconstitution, should increase and result in values similar to those detected in cells transfected with the wild-type exchanger or mutant N21. The results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 2A. It can be seen, that the transport activity of the reconstituted amino-terminal truncated Na+-Ca2+ exchangers relative to the transport activity of the wild-type exchanger, is in principle similar to the transport activity obtained in the whole cell experiments. Fig. 2B shows the average Ca2+ transport activity (n = 9) of the reconstituted wild-type exchanger RBE-1 in the presence (dottedbar) and in the absence (clearbar) of a driving Na+ gradient. These experiments suggest that truncation of the entire putative signal peptide of the cloned Na+-Ca2+ exchanger gene RBE-1 including the signal peptidase cleavage site (mutant N31) do not result in an accumulation of significant amounts of intracellular Na+-Ca2+ exchangers. To try and elucidate the possible role of the signal peptide and that of the signal peptidase cleavage site in functional expression of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger, a mutant exchanger was prepared in which the putative cleavage site Ala-32 was changed to Asp. We chose this exchange since analysis of the patterns of amino acids near the cleavage site (23von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar) indicated, that Asp was not found in position −1. Transfection of HeLa cells with this mutant clone indicated that its Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity was only 7.7% (S.D. = 4.4; n = 5) when compared with the wild-type exchanger RBE-1 (see Fig. 3), which was tested in parallel, suggesting that the amino acids in the vicinity of cleavage of the signal peptide might be of importance in functional expression. It was interesting to note that reconstitution of the proteins synthesized in the Ala-32 → Asp-transfected HeLa cells led to an increase in transport activity. Compared with the 7.7% relative to the wild-type exchanger in whole cells, following reconstitution, the transport activity increased to 31% (S.D. = 12.07; n = 5). This would suggest that either some protein was not targeted to the plasma membrane or it acquired functional conformation only following reconstitution. To test this possibility, we have isolated RNA from HeLa cells infected with the recombinant vaccinia virus VTF-7 and mock transfected with the plasmid pBluescript KS and from HeLa cells transfected with the wild-type and the three mutant cloned Na+-Ca2+ exchanger genes. Northern blot analysis (Fig. 4A) using a 863-base pair probe (spanning nucleotides 1936-2799 of the cloned rat Na+-Ca2+ exchanger gene) revealed that 1) the probe did not hybridize to RNA isolated from infected HeLa cells (laneA) or infected and mock-transfected (with pBluescript KS) HeLa cells (laneB); 2) the probe hybridized to RNA isolated from HeLa cells transfected with either wild-type (laneC) or the mutant exchangers (lanesD-F); 3) in most experiments (as also in that shown in Fig. 4A), we did not detect significant differences between the amount of the wild-type and mutant mRNAs, although their transport activity was somewhat lower (Fig. 1 and 2). Hence, there is no clear correlation in most experiments between the expression of Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity, which usually was somewhat lower when the cells were transfected with N26 and N31 and the amount of mutant-derived mRNA. We have also hybridized to these RNA preparations an antisense 53-mer-long oligonucleotide derived from the truncated amino-terminal region of the cloned Na+-Ca2+ exchanger genes (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 4B shows that the oligonucleotide hybridized only to RNA isolated from HeLa cells transfected with the wild-type Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (laneB). This rules out any possibility that a contaminant signal peptide containing plasmid, either in the transfecting DNAs or in the cells, was responsible for the transport activity of the truncated mutants. We have also tested directly the correlation between the functional expression of Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity, the length of the putative signal peptide, and the nature of the signal peptidase cleavage site with the amount of Na+-Ca2+ exchanger protein synthesized and targeted to the plasma membrane. Western blot analysis was carried out to detect Na+-Ca2+ exchanger-derived protein in a total extract obtained from tr"

https://openalex.org/W1990678233,"The Na+-Ca2+ exchanger is an unusual membrane transport protein as it contains an NH2-terminal signal sequence which is co-translationally removed in the endoplasmic reticulum during synthesis. To determine if the signal sequence was essential for biosynthesis, mutations were introduced in the NH2 terminus of the cDNA coding for the human renal Na+-Ca2+ exchanger in order to alter processing of the protein. To prevent cleavage of the signal sequence during biosynthesis, the last residue of the consensus signal sequence, Ala-1, was changed to Phe. Deletion mutants were also constructed to encode for exchangers which lacked the signal sequence, the signal sequence and the first extracellular loop, or all of the NH2 terminus including the first transmembrane segment of the mature protein. These mutants were expressed in HEK 293 cells and assayed for Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity. Mutants lacking either a signal sequence or containing a noncleavable signal sequence were still targeted to the plasma membrane, where they exhibited Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity. By contrast, the mutants which had more than the signal sequence deleted did not demonstrate any exchange activity. These mutants were, however, still integrated into the membrane and were resistant to alkali extraction. These results show that the signal sequence is not essential for biogenesis of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger and suggests that the molecule contains one or more internal signal sequences for insertion into the membrane during biosynthesis. The Na+-Ca2+ exchanger is an unusual membrane transport protein as it contains an NH2-terminal signal sequence which is co-translationally removed in the endoplasmic reticulum during synthesis.

To prevent cleavage of the signal sequence during biosynthesis, the last residue of the consensus signal sequence, Ala-1, was changed to Phe. Deletion mutants were also constructed to encode for exchangers which lacked the signal sequence, the signal sequence and the first extracellular loop, or all of the NH2 terminus including the first transmembrane segment of the mature protein. These mutants were expressed in HEK 293 cells and assayed for Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity. Mutants lacking either a signal sequence or containing a noncleavable signal sequence were still targeted to the plasma membrane, where they exhibited Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity. By contrast, the mutants which had more than the signal sequence deleted did not demonstrate any exchange activity. These mutants were, however, still integrated into the membrane and were resistant to alkali extraction. These results show that the signal sequence is not essential for biogenesis of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger and suggests that the molecule contains one or more internal signal sequences for insertion into the membrane during biosynthesis. INTRODUCTIONThe Na+-Ca2+ exchanger is an integral plasma membrane protein which functions primarily to extrude Ca2+ from the cell (see reviews by 30Philipson K.D. Nicoll D.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 678-683Google Scholar, 31Philipson K.D. Nicoll D.A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1993; 137C: 199-227Google Scholar). It is found in a wide variety of tissues including heart, brain, kidney, lung, large intestine, pancreas, and spleen (16Kofuji P. Hadley R.W. Kieval R.S. Lederer W.J. Schulze D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C1241-C1249Google Scholar; 20Lee S.-L. Yu A.S.L. Lytton J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14849-14852Google Scholar). The physiological role of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger has most clearly been established in cardiac muscle. Here, it acts as the dominant mechanism in extruding Ca2+ from the cardiac myocyte after depolarization (2Bers D.M. Lederer W.J. Berlin J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C944-C954Google Scholar; 4Bridge J.H.B. Smolley J.R. Spitzer W. Science. 1990; 248: 376-378Google Scholar).The cardiac isoform of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger, NCX1, was first cloned from canine heart (Nicoll et al., 1990). It soon became apparent that alternatively spliced variants of this gene were expressed in a tissue-specific manner (17Kofuji P. Lederer W.J. Schulze D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5145-5149Google Scholar; Lee et al., 1994; Loo and Clarke, 1994b). Recently, a second gene product, NCX2, has been identified in rat brain and has 65% amino acid identity to NCX1 (22Li Z. Matsuoka S. Hryshko L.V. Nicoll D.A. Bersohn M.M. Burke E.P. Lifton R.P. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17434-17439Google Scholar).Hydropathy analysis of the NCX1 isoform of the exchanger predicts a molecule with 12 transmembrane segments (TM), 1The abbreviations used are:TMtransmembrane segmentPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid. with a large intracellular domain located between transmembrane segments 6 and 7 (Nicoll et al., 1990). This cytosolic domain contains the regulatory sites for calcium binding, inhibition by exchanger inhibitory peptide, and Na+-dependent inactivation (26Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. Reilly R.F. Hilgemann D.W. Philipson K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3870-3874Google Scholar). Mutant exchangers with deletions in the cytosolic domain retain the ability to carry out exchange activity (Matsuoka et al., 1993). These results indicate that ion binding and translocation sites are located within the membrane domains.The first transmembrane segment of the exchanger was predicted to act as a signal sequence for insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane during biosynthesis (Nicoll et al., 1990). It has been postulated that the signal sequence may be necessary to ensure correct orientation of the NH2-terminal end of the molecule (6Durkin J.T. Ahrens D.C. Pan Y.C.E. Reeves J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 290: 369-375Google Scholar) and is removed during biosynthesis (27Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 639: 181-188Google Scholar; Durkin et al., 1991). This is in contrast to most polytopic membrane transport proteins, in which the first TM segment in the mature protein acts as an internal signal sequence that is not cleaved off during synthesis (33Reithmeier R.A.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 583-594Google Scholar). In addition, membrane transport proteins such as P-glycoprotein and the AE1 transporter contain multiple transmembrane segments which have topogenic properties of internal signal sequences (38Zhang J.-T. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18224-18232Google Scholar; 23Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28683-28689Google Scholar; 36Tam L.Y. Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32542-32550Google Scholar). It is possible that the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger may utilize a cleavable leader sequence at the NH2-terminal end because it lacks one or more internal signal sequences. To determine if the presence of a cleavable signal sequence is essential for biosynthesis of the exchanger, mutants were constructed to yield products which contained an uncleavable signal sequence or contained truncations at the NH2-terminal end of the molecule. The mutants were expressed in human kidney cells and assayed for their ability to carry out exchange activity. It was found that a mutant lacking a signal sequence or containing an uncleaved signal sequence were still targeted to the plasma membrane and were functional. By contrast, mutants with deletions greater than the signal sequence did not exhibit Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of MutantsA 2,995-base pair EcoRI to XhoI fragment coding for the human renal isoform of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (Loo and Clarke, 1994b) was cloned into the EcoRI to XhoI sites of the mammalian expression vector, pMT21 (a gift from Dr. R. Kaufman, Genetics Institute, Boston), to create pMT21HEX.An EcoRI to PstI fragment (nucleotides 1 to 532) of the exchanger was subcloned into the polylinker region of Bluescript vector (Stratagene) for site-directed mutagenesis by the method of 19Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Google Scholar. To create a mutant with an uncleavable signal sequence, the codon for Ala-1) of the consensus signal sequence was mutated to Phe with the oligonucleotide 5′-CCATGTAATTTTTGAGACAGAAA-3′.In order to construct a mutant lacking the signal sequence, an NsiI site was created immediately following the initiating codon by changing the codon for Tyr2 to His with oligonucleotide 5′-AGTGTCATGCATAACATGCGG-3′. Similarly, a second NsiI site was also created by changing the codons for Ala-1) to Met and Glu1 to His by using oligonucleotide 5′-GACCATGTAATTATGCATACAGAAATGGAAGGA- 3′. The fragment coding for residues −1 to −35 was then removed by digestion with NsiI, followed by religation of the vector fragment.Deletion mutants missing the first 49 or 64 amino acids of the mature protein were generated by first introducing an NcoI site at the initiating methionine, using oligonucleotide 5′-TTGGAAGTGCCATGGACAACATGC-3′. The fragment coding for residues 1 to 49 was removed as an NcoI fragment. The deletion mutant missing the first 64 amino acids was obtained by creating a second NcoI site at residue 65, with oligonucleotide 5′-CTGATCGGTCCATGGCCTCTATAGA-3′. Cleavage of this construct with NcoI, followed by religation, created an initiating methionine at residue 65 and also changed Ser66 to Gly.Fragments containing the mutations were subcloned back into their original positions in pMT21HEX, for expression in HEK 293 cells. The integrity of the mutated segments of the cDNA were checked by sequencing the entire insert, including the cloning sites, by the dideoxy chain termination method (34Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar).Construction of Chimeric ProteinsTo monitor for size changes due to cleavage of the signal sequence or glycosylation, the fragments coding for the NH2-terminal end of the wild-type or mutant exchanger (residues −35 to 50) were ligated to the fragment coding for human calbindin D-28k (residues 47 to 261). The cDNA for human calbindin D-28k was cloned from the human kidney cortex library (1Bell G.I. Fong N.M. Stempien M.H. Warmsted M.A. Caput D. Ku L Urdes M.S. Rall L.B. Sanchez-Pescador R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 8427-8446Google Scholar) and was found to be identical with that reported by 29Parmentier M. Lawson D.E.M. Vassart G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 170: 207-215Google Scholar. 2T. W. Loo and D. M. Clarke, unpublished data. The EcoRI to PstI fragment (nucleotides 1 to 532) of the exchanger in Bluescript vector (Stratagene) was first digested with NcoI, filled-in with Klenow enzyme, and then digested with XhoI. The 1,100-base pair BstU1to XhoI fragment coding for residues 47 to 261 of human calbindin D-28k was then ligated into the NcoI-Klenow to XhoI sites in Bluescript vector containing the NH2-terminal end of the exchanger. The resulting construct in Bluescript vector contained the cDNA coding for residues −35 to 50 of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger in-frame with that of human calbindin D-28k (residues 47 to 261). The chimeric cDNAs were then subcloned into the EcoRI to XhoI sites of vector pMT21 for expression in HEK 293 cells.Cell Culture and Exchange ActivityProcedures for transfection of human HEK 293 cells have been described previously (25Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7750-7755Google Scholar). Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity was measured on cells 48 h after transfection as [Na+]in-dependent [45Ca2+]out uptake as described by Li et al.(1992).Immunological ProceduresImmunoblotting was performed using either 2 μg/ml anti-calbindin D-28k monoclonal antibody (Sigma) or a 1:500 dilution of rabbit polyclonal antibody against the large cytoplasmic domain of the exchanger (Loo and Clarke, 1994b) and the blots developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham).RESULTSConstruction of Mutants and Expression in HEK 293 CellsThe first 35 amino acids of the human Na+-Ca2+ exchanger is a cleavable signal sequence which is removed during biosynthesis (Nicoll and Philipson, 1991; Durkin et al., 1991) (Fig. 1). The last residue of signal sequences (−1-position) has been observed to be one with a small uncharged side chain such as Ala, Gly, Ser, Cys, Thr, or Gln, which is postulated to fit into a pocket of the signal peptidase (37von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 17-21Google Scholar). It was suggested that the presence of a bulky side chain at the −1-position of the signal sequence would inhibit cleavage by the signal peptidase (von Heijne, 1983). Accordingly, in order to block the cleavage of the leader sequence of the exchanger, we mutated residue Ala-1→ Phe (Fig. 1, construct B). Deletion mutants were also constructed to test whether the NH2-terminal region encompassing the leader sequence and TM1 were essential for synthesis of a functional molecule that is targeted to the plasma membrane (Fig. 1). Mutants lacking the signal sequence (construct C), the signal sequence and the first extracellular loop (construct E), or lacking both the signal sequence and TM1 (construct F) were constructed. In addition, a glycosylation-deficient mutant (construct D) was also generated by mutating Asn9→ Ala. 14Hryshko L.V. Nicoll D.A. Weiss J.N. Philipson K.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1151: 35-42Google Scholar identified Asn9 as the site of glycosylation using site-directed mutagenesis studies.A transient expression system utilizing human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293) was used to monitor expression and function of the mutants. As shown in Fig. 2, HEK 293 cells transfected with the human kidney isoform of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (Loo and Clarke, 1994b) exhibited about 6-fold higher [Na+]in-dependent [Ca2+]out exchange activity compared to cells transfected with vector alone. The exchange activity is rapid and is linear for the first 2 min. Recently, 11Gabellini N. Iwata T. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6917-6924Google Scholar have reported that the level of exchange activity found in HEK 293 cells transfected with NCX1 is comparable with that found in isolated cardiac sarcolemmal membranes, when one considers that only a small percentage (10-20%) of the HEK cells express NCX1. These results suggest that the majority of the expressed NCX1 in HEK 293 cells resides in the plasma membrane. When the Na+ gradient across the cell membrane was abolished, no difference in exchange activity was observed between cells transfected with wild-type exchanger or with vector alone (data not shown). Low levels of Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity were, however, also present in cells transfected with vector alone. The low activity is due to the presence of endogenous Na+-Ca2+ exchanger in these cells. Indeed, the cDNA coding for Na+-Ca2+ exchanger used in this study was previously isolated from HEK 293 cells (Loo and Clarke, 1994b). The level of expression of the endogenous Na+-Ca2+ exchanger, however, was very low and did not appear to interfere with the expression studies (Fig. 3A).Figure 2:Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity of HEK 293 cells transfected with wild-type Na+-Ca2+ exchanger. HEK 293 cells were transfected with cDNA coding for wild-type enzyme (•) or with vector alone (○). 48 h after transfection, the cells were harvested by scraping, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and loaded with Na+ by incubation in 10 mM MOPS, pH 7.4, 140 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ouabain, and 25 μM nystatin as described by 21Li Z. Smith C.D. Smolley J.R. Bridge J.H.B. Frank J.S. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7828-7833Google Scholar. The cells were washed in buffer containing no nystatin, and [Na+]in-dependent [Ca2+]out activity was measured at room temperature in uptake medium containing either 140 mM KCl (uptake) or 140 mM NaCl (blank) and 10 mM MOPS, pH 7.4, 25 μM CaCl2, 0.2 μCi/ml [45Ca2+], and 1 mM ouabain. At various intervals, the reaction was stopped by addition of ice-cold stop solution containing 140 mM KCl, 1 mM EGTA, and 5 mM lanthanum chloride. The cells were collected by centrifugation, and the amount of radioactivity present was measured by liquid scintillation counting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3:Immunoblot analysis of wild-type and mutant forms of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger. A, HEK 293 cells were transfected with cDNAs of wild-type or mutant forms of the exchanger. After 48 h, the transfected cells were solubilized with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, heated for 2 min at 50°C, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose and analyzed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against the cytoplasmic domain of the exchanger (24Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F70-F74Google Scholar) and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, N-glycanase F digestion. HEK 293 cells were transfected with wild-type exchanger, mutant with an uncleaved signal sequence (Ala-1→ Phe), glycosylation-deficient mutant Asn9→ Ala, or vector alone and solubilized with buffer containing 1% (w/v) SDS and 1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. The samples were then incubated in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 at 37°C for 15 min in the presence (+) or absence(-) of PNGase F (1000 units, New England Biolabs). The reaction was stopped by addition of an equal volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, heated at 50°C, and subjected to immunoblot analysis as described above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 3A shows an immunoblot of wild-type renal Na+-Ca2+ exchanger and the NH2-terminal mutants expressed in HEK 293 cells. With the exception of the two largest deletions (Δ49 and Δ64 amino acids, respectively), the major immunoreactive product was a protein of an apparent mass of 115 kDa, which is in agreement with the predicted size of the protein. The 115-kDa products of wild-type exchanger, the mutant with an uncleavable signal sequence (Ala-1→ Phe), and the mutant with a deleted signal sequence (residues −1 to −35) were diffuse, suggesting that there was heterogeneity in glycosylation. Smaller immunoreactive products of approximately 80 kDa and 70 kDa were also observed in all cases and probably correspond to protease degradation products. A small increase in mobility on SDS-PAGE was noted for the glycosylation-deficient mutant Asn9→ Ala, consistent with the absence of oligosaccharide. We consistently observed that the level and pattern of expression were similar in cells expressing either wild-type or mutant exchangers. The full-length product of an apparent mass of 115 kDa was the most prominent product for the wild-type exchanger and all the mutants, except for mutants Δ49 and Δ64. In cells expressing these two mutants, the most prominent immunoreactive products had apparent masses of 70 kDa and 80 kDa, respectively. These observations suggest that the full-length products of mutants Δ49 and Δ64, were degraded more rapidly.Expression of Chimeric ProteinsIt was not possible to reliably ascertain by SDS-PAGE whether mutation of Ala-1→ Phe in the full-length exchanger did indeed prevent the cleavage of the signal sequence because of the small change in the size of the mutant product compared to wild-type enzyme. Similarly, removal of the oligosaccharide by N-glycanase F, resulted in only small changes in their molecular masses (Fig. 3B). In order to overcome these problems, small fusion proteins were made by joining the NH2 termini (segment encompassing residues −35 to 50) of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger to the soluble protein, calbindin D-28k (residues 47 to 261). Calbindin D-28k is a cytosolic vitamin D-dependent calcium-binding protein consisting of 261 amino acid residues (10Fullmer C.S. Wasserman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4772-4776Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, expression of cDNA coding for calbindin D-28k in HEK 293 cells yields an immunoreactive product of an apparent mass of 26 kDa, which is not sensitive to treatment with endoglycosidase H. Endoglycosidase H removes core oligosaccharides which are added to glycosylated proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Proteins whose carbohydrate moieties are further processed in the Golgi apparatus become resistant to treatment with endoglycosidase H. Expression of a chimeric protein consisting of the NH2 terminus of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger and calbindin D-28k (HEX-Calbindin) in HEK 293 cells yielded 3 immunoreactive products of apparent masses of 35 kDa, 32 kDa, and 28.5 kDa. The 32-kDa and 35-kDa products are likely to contain one and two core oligosaccharides, respectively, since only the 28.5-kDa product was observed after treatment with endoglycosidase H. The presence of two glycosylated sites was unexpected since the coding region for the NH2-terminal end of the exchanger does not contain any other consensus sites for N-linked glycosylation (Asn-X-Ser/Thr) other than at Asn9. The calbindin passenger domain, however, contains two potential sites at residues Asn136 and Asn230. Therefore, one of the glycosylated sites must occur within the calbindin passenger domain since the glycosylation-deficient mutant (Asn9→ Ala)-calbindin chimera was also glycosylated and sensitive to endoglycosidase H treatment (Fig. 4). These results indicate that at least part of the calbindin passenger domain in these chimeric proteins traversed the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and entered into the lumen. Mutation of Ala-1→ Phe successfully prevented cleavage of the signal sequence during biosynthesis since both glycosylated and endoglycosidase H-treated samples of HEX(A-1F)-Calbindin were about 3 kDa larger than the wild-type chimera (Fig. 4). The shift in molecular mass from 38.5 kDa to 31.5 kDa upon treatment with endoglycosidase H suggests that two sites had been glycosylated. It was also observed that the efficiency of glycosylation of mutant Ala-1→ Phe was much greater than that of the wild-type chimera (Fig. 4).Figure 4:Expression and enzymatic deglycosylation of chimeric proteins constructed by fusion of the NH2-terminal domain of wild-type and mutant forms of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger and human calbindin D-28k. The cDNAs coding for the chimeric proteins consisting of the fusion of residues 47 to 261 of human calbindin D-28k with the first 85 amino acids of wild-type exchanger (HEX-Calbindin), mutant exchanger with uncleavable (Ala-1→ Phe) signal sequence (HEX(A-1F)-Calbindin), or glycosylation-deficient exchanger (HEX(N9A)-Calbindin), were expressed in HEK 293 cells. The transfected cells were then solubilized with buffer containing 50 mM sodium citrate, pH 5.5, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, 10 mM EDTA, and 1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. The samples were divided into two equal portions, which were then incubated either with (+) or without(-) endoglycosidase Hf (100 units, New England Biolabs) for 15 min at room temperature. The digestion was stopped by addition of an equal volume of buffer containing 0.25 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% (w/v) SDS, 4% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, and 20% (v/v) glycerol. The reaction mixtures were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose, and analyzed with anti-calbindin D-28k monoclonal antibody (Sigma) and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham) as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fusion of the NH2 terminus of the exchanger to calbindin also resulted in translocation of at least a portion of the passenger domain into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum which was subsequently glycosylated. To determine whether the chimeric protein remained membrane-bound or was completely translocated into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, the transfected cells were lysed and crude cytosolic and membrane fractions were prepared. Fig. 5shows that the majority of wild-type exchanger-calbindin chimeric protein was found in the cytosolic fraction, suggesting that the entire passenger molecule had entered the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum following cleavage of the signal sequence. This chimeric protein was subsequently found to be exported from the cell (Fig. 6). By 48 h post-transfection, a greater amount of the wild-type exchanger-calbindin chimera was found in the culture medium compared to that found in the cellular extract. Similar results were obtained with the glycosylation-deficient mutant (Asn9→ Ala)-calbindin chimera (data not shown). By contrast, the mutant exchanger-calbindin chimera with an uncleaved signal remained associated with the membrane as an integral membrane protein since it was resistant to alkaline extraction (Fig. 5). Extraction of membranes with alkali removes all but integral membrane proteins from the membrane (9Fujiki Y. Fowler S. Shiu H. Hubbard A.L. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 103-110Google Scholar). The mutant exchanger-calbindin chimera with an uncleaved signal sequence is not exported since it was not detected in the culture medium (Fig. 6). These results indicate that the hydrophobic domain of the signal sequence (residues −7 to −30) was able to anchor the calbindin domain to the membrane. This would likely explain the increased efficiency of glycosylation of the (Ala-1→ Phe) mutant-calbindin chimeric protein relative to the wild-type chimera (Fig. 4). The wild-type chimeric protein may not be in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum long enough for glycosylation to be completed.Figure 5:Alkali extraction of membranes from cells expressing wild-type or mutant chimeric proteins. HEK 293 cells were transfected with the cDNAs coding for the chimeric proteins generated by fusion of the NH2-terminal segments of wild-type exchanger (HEX-Cal) or mutant exchanger with an uncleavable signal sequence (HEX[A(-1)F]-Cal) with human calbindin D-28k.

Fig. 7shows that the mutant with no signal sequence or with an uncleavable signal sequence exhibited exchange activity at levels comparable to that of the wild-type exchanger. These results indicate that the two mutants were correctly inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum and similar amounts of the exchanger must be present in the plasma membrane. Similarly, the glycosylation-deficient mutant, Asn9→ Ala, was also targeted to the plasma membrane and exhibited exchange activity, in agreement with the results obtained when the glycosylation-deficient mutant of rabbit cardiac exchanger was expressed in Xenopus oocytes (Hryshko et al., 1993). By contrast, no exchange activity was detected when mutants Δ49 or Δ64 were expressed in HEK 293 cells.Figure 7:Comparison of the Na+-Ca2+ exchange activities of wild-type and mutant forms of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 923-930Google Scholar). They act to target the nascent polypeptide chain to the endoplasmic reticulum. In this study we found that the cleavable signal sequence was not essential for biosynthesis and targeting of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger to the plasma membrane. An active exchanger targeted to the cell surface was obtained when the signal sequence was deleted or when cleavage of the signal sequence was blocked. In both instances, the protein product was glycosylated. By contrast, deletions that were greater than the signal sequence resulted in the synthesis of products that were rapidly degraded and whose exchange activity could not be detected. Deletions encompassing part of the TM1 segment of the mature protein may result in the inability of the protein to adopt its native conformation, since TM1 often acts as an internal signal-anchor sequence (18Kolling R. Hollenberg C.P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 155-158Google Scholar). For example, deletion of the first transmembrane sequence of SERCA1 Ca2+-ATPase resulted in an inactive enzyme and which was rapidly degraded (35Skerjanc I.S. Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 168-170Google Scholar). In this case, the mutant was not stably inserted into the membrane, since most of the protein product was removed by alkali extraction. The deletion mutants Δ49 and Δ64, however, remained associated with the membrane, indicating that the exchanger contains other internal signal-anchor sequences. Internal signal-anchor sequences have recently been identified in a number of eukaryotic transport proteins such as AE1 (Tam et al., 1994) and P-glycoprotein (Loo and Clarke, 1994a, 39Zhang J.-T. Lee C.H. Duthie M. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1742-1746Google Scholar).What is the role of the cleavable signal sequence in the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger? One possibility is that it may enhance membrane insertion. Such a situation has been observed for the human β2-adrenergic receptor (13Guan X.-M. Kobilka T.S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21995-21998Google Scholar). It is a type IIIb membrane protein (NH2 terminus on the extracellular side of the membrane but lacking a cleavable signal sequence). When a cleavable signal peptide was fused to this protein, translocation of the receptor protein into the endoplasmic reticulum was increased 2-fold. Such an increase would enhance expression of the exchanger in cell types which express low levels of the protein, but would not be detectable in the high levels of expression achieved by transient transfection in HEK 293 cells. Cleavage of the signal sequence may be required for the molecule to associate with itself or with other molecules. It has been noted that most membrane transport proteins are oligomeric (15Klingenberg M. Nature. 1981; 290: 449-454Google Scholar), but it has not been established whether oligomerization is required for transport. In the Na+-H+ exchanger, it appears that the molecule forms stable dimers but individual monomers can function independently within the oligomeric state (7Fafournoux P. Noel J. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2589-2596Google Scholar). It is likely that the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger may also associate with other proteins in order to be localized to specific subcellular regions. It has been shown that the cardiac exchanger is preferentially localized to transverse tubules in heart sarcolemma (8Frank J.S. Moltino G. Reid D. Molday R.S. Philipson K.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 337-345Google Scholar), while renal exchanger is localized to the basolateral surfaces in the collecting ducts of the kidney (32Reilly R.F. Shugrue C.A. Lattanzi D. Biemesderfer D. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F327-F332Google Scholar; 3Bourdeau J.E. Taylor A.N. Iacopino A.M. J. Am. 7Soc. Nephrol. 1993; 4: 105-110Google Scholar). It is possible that the presence of a signal sequence would interfere with such associations if it was not removed. INTRODUCTIONThe Na+-Ca2+ exchanger is an integral plasma membrane protein which functions primarily to extrude Ca2+ from the cell (see reviews by 30Philipson K.D. Nicoll D.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 678-683Google Scholar, 31Philipson K.D. Nicoll D.A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1993; 137C: 199-227Google Scholar). It is found in a wide variety of tissues including heart, brain, kidney, lung, large intestine, pancreas, and spleen (16Kofuji P. Hadley R.W. Kieval R.S. Lederer W.J. Schulze D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C1241-C1249Google Scholar; 20Lee S.-L. Yu A.S.L. Lytton J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14849-14852Google Scholar). The physiological role of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger has most clearly been established in cardiac muscle. Here, it acts as the dominant mechanism in extruding Ca2+ from the cardiac myocyte after depolarization (2Bers D.M. Lederer W.J. Berlin J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C944-C954Google Scholar; 4Bridge J.H.B. Smolley J.R. Spitzer W. Science. 1990; 248: 376-378Google Scholar).The cardiac isoform of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger, NCX1, was first cloned from canine heart (Nicoll et al., 1990). It soon became apparent that alternatively spliced variants of this gene were expressed in a tissue-specific manner (17Kofuji P. Lederer W.J. Schulze D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5145-5149Google Scholar; Lee et al., 1994; Loo and Clarke, 1994b). Recently, a second gene product, NCX2, has been identified in rat brain and has 65% amino acid identity to NCX1 (22Li Z. Matsuoka S. Hryshko L.V. Nicoll D.A. Bersohn M.M. Burke E.P. Lifton R.P. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17434-17439Google Scholar).Hydropathy analysis of the NCX1 isoform of the exchanger predicts a molecule with 12 transmembrane segments (TM), 1The abbreviations used are:TMtransmembrane segmentPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid. with a large intracellular domain located between transmembrane segments 6 and 7 (Nicoll et al., 1990). This cytosolic domain contains the regulatory sites for calcium binding, inhibition by exchanger inhibitory peptide, and Na+-dependent inactivation (26Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. Reilly R.F. Hilgemann D.W. Philipson K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3870-3874Google Scholar). Mutant exchangers with deletions in the cytosolic domain retain the ability to carry out exchange activity (Matsuoka et al., 1993). These results indicate that ion binding and translocation sites are located within the membrane domains.The first transmembrane segment of the exchanger was predicted to act as a signal sequence for insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane during biosynthesis (Nicoll et al., 1990). It has been postulated that the signal sequence may be necessary to ensure correct orientation of the NH2-terminal end of the molecule (6Durkin J.T. Ahrens D.C. Pan Y.C.E. Reeves J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 290: 369-375Google Scholar) and is removed during biosynthesis (27Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 639: 181-188Google Scholar; Durkin et al., 1991). This is in contrast to most polytopic membrane transport proteins, in which the first TM segment in the mature protein acts as an internal signal sequence that is not cleaved off during synthesis (33Reithmeier R.A.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 583-594Google Scholar). In addition, membrane transport proteins such as P-glycoprotein and the AE1 transporter contain multiple transmembrane segments which have topogenic properties of internal signal sequences (38Zhang J.-T. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18224-18232Google Scholar; 23Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28683-28689Google Scholar; 36Tam L.Y. Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32542-32550Google Scholar). It is possible that the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger may utilize a cleavable leader sequence at the NH2-terminal end because it lacks one or more internal signal sequences. To determine if the presence of a cleavable signal sequence is essential for biosynthesis of the exchanger, mutants were constructed to yield products which contained an uncleavable signal sequence or contained truncations at the NH2-terminal end of the molecule. The mutants were expressed in human kidney cells and assayed for their ability to carry out exchange activity. It was found that a mutant lacking a signal sequence or containing an uncleaved signal sequence were still targeted to the plasma membrane and were functional. By contrast, mutants with deletions greater than the signal sequence did not exhibit Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity."

Steady state fluorescence spectroscopy demonstrated that the basic/helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper domain of USF binds its DNA targets with high affinity and specificity, whereas removal of the leucine zipper yielding the basic/helix-loop-helix minimal DNA binding region reduces both affinity and specificity.

The leucine zipper is also necessary for USF to function as a bivalent homotetramer, capable of binding two distinct recognition sites simultaneously and mediating DNA looping under physiologic conditions. Titration studies revealed that the first binding event has a equilibrium constant Keq = (2.2 ± 2.0) × 109M-1 for major late promoter DNA, whereas the second binding event occurs with a remarkably reduced affinity, Keq = (1.2 ± 0.8) × 108M-1. This anticooperative feature of DNA binding by the homotetramer suggests that USF stimulates transcription by mediating DNA looping between nearby recognition sites located in class II nuclear and viral gene promoters.

INTRODUCTIONThe human transcription factor USF 1The abbreviations used are: USFupstream stimulating factorbbasicHLHhelix-loop-helixZzipperMLPmajor late promoterNSnonspecificLCRlocus control regionIEBinsulin enhancer binding. is involved in the regulation of both cellular and viral genes. USF belongs to the basic (b)/helix-loop-helix (HLH)/leucine zipper (Z) family of transcription factors and stimulates transcription by binding to a specific E-box motif (CACGTG) upstream of many cellular and viral promoters. Earlier studies identified USF as a cellular factor that activates the intrinsically strong adenovirus major late promoter by binding to an E-box located at position −60 with respect to the cap site (6Carthew R.W. Chodosh L.A. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1985; 43: 439-448Google Scholar; 16Miyamoto N.G. Moncollin V. Egly J.M. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3563-3570Google Scholar; 19Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1985; 43: 165-175Google Scholar) and stimulates transcription, possibly by direct interaction with the transcription factor TFIID (20Sawadogo M. Van Dyke M.W. Gregor P.D. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11985-11993Google Scholar; 15Meisterernst M. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 87: 9153-9157Google Scholar; 3Bungert J. Düring F. Seifart K.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 885-898Google Scholar). USF contains four major domains: A, activation; b, basic domain; HLH, helix-loop-helix domain, and Z, leucine zipper domain. The leucine zipper domain was believed to be necessary for high affinity DNA binding by b/HLH/Z (9Ferré-D'Amaré A.R. Pognonec P. Roeder R.G. Burley S.K. EMBO. 1994; 13: 180-189Google Scholar). The present studies used the b/HLH and b/HLH/Z domains of USF. The recent cocrystal structure of b/HLH•DNA has shown that the b/HLH binds to one duplex DNA as a dimer, and other studies suggested that the b/HLH/Z bind two duplex DNAs at the same time as a homotetramer (9Ferré-D'Amaré A.R. Pognonec P. Roeder R.G. Burley S.K. EMBO. 1994; 13: 180-189Google Scholar), but little is known about the binding affinity, specificity, or the rate of this reaction. The duplex DNA oligomer derived from the adenovirus MLP promoter containing a palindromic E-box (underlined) was used in this study. MLP: 5′-TAGGCCACGTG¯ACCGG3′-ATCCGGTGCAC¯TGGCCSEQUENCE 1 A nonspecific (NS) sequence, which contains three mutations (labeled with ∗) on one half of the sequence, was designed to alter the E-box. NS: 5′-TAGGCCACC*TG¯C*CT*GG3′-ATCCGGTGGAC¯GGACCSEQUENCE 2 Recent studies showed that USF is a component of human β-globin locus control region (LCR) transcription complex with a binding site very much like our NS sequence (1Bresnick E.H. Felsenfeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18824-18834Google Scholar). LCR: 5′-TAGA*CCACC*TG¯ACT*GG3′-ATCTGGTGGAC¯TGACCSEQUENCE 3 The comparison of the association constants of USF with LCR, NS and the intrinsically strong MLP sequence will shed light on the sequence-specific interaction of USF with DNA.MATERIALS AND METHODSDNA Oligomers and ProteinUSF DNA binding site oligomers of MLP, LCR, and NS were synthesized, purified, quantitated and annealed as described elsewhere (8Ferré-D'Amaré A.R. Prendergast G.C. Ziff E.B. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 363: 38-45Google Scholar). The overexpression and purification of both protein constructs has been described previously (Ferré-D'Amaréet al., 1994). Cysteine-free mutants, which are indistinguishable from wild-type protein, were employed.Fluorescence MeasurementsThe binding buffer used for fluorescence measurements consisted of 10 mM HEPES-KOH, 100 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mM MgCl2, adjusted to pH 7.5. All chemicals were reagent grade or better. Fluorescence measurements were carried out at 25°C, unless otherwise noted, on a SPEX Fluorolog-τ2 spectrofluorometer equipped with a high intensity xenon arc lamp, and steady state data were collected and analyzed as described previously in detail (21Sha M. Balasta M.L. Goss D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14872-14877Google Scholar; 4Carberry S.E. Rhoads R.E. Goss D.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8078-8083Google Scholar, 5Carberry S.E. Darzynkiewicz E. Stepinski J. Tahara S.M. Rhoads R.E. Goss D.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3337-3341Google Scholar).The kinetics of the binding of the duplex E-box sequence of MLP DNA to the b/HLH and b/HLH/Z domains of USF were followed by measuring the changes of the intrinsic protein fluorescence after rapid mixing by a Hi-Tech Scientific SFA-11 stopped-flow apparatus. The excitation wavelength was 281 nm, and the slit width was 2 mm. Light emitted from the reaction mixture was monitored at a single wavelength, 335 nm, with a integration time of 1 ms. A series of stopped-flow experiments were performed at different temperatures. After rapid mixing of protein (0.1 μM b/HLH dimer or 0.1 μM b/HLH/Z tetramer) with the appropriate DNA solution, the time course of the intrinsic fluorescence intensity was recorded. The plot of ΔF versus time was fitted to a number of nonlinear analytical equations using Peakfit software from Jandel Scientific.RESULTSSteady State Fluorescence MeasurementsThe fluorescence emission spectra of b/HLH•oligonucleotide complexes as a function of oligonucleotide concentration is shown in Fig. 1. Upon complex formation, there is a decrease in the protein fluorescence intensity at 335 nm. Such protein fluorescence quenching has been attributed to the π-π stacking interactions between an aromatic amino acid residue, in this case tryptophan (Trp-218) and the nucleic acid base (12Lawaczek R. Wagner K.G. Biopolymers. 1974; 13: 2003-2014Google Scholar; 2Brun F. Toulme J.J. Helene C. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 558-563Google Scholar; 11Ishida T. Katsuta M. Inoue M. Yamagata Y. Tomita K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 115: 849-854Google Scholar).The Keq of b/HLH•oligonucleotide and b/HLH/Z•oligonucleotide complex formation can be calculated from the relative fluorescence intensity changes in free and complexed protein emission spectra by construction of an Eadie-Hofstee plot, as shown in the inset of Fig. 1. Keq was found to be (4.7 ± 0.6) × 105M-1 for the interaction of b/HLH with MLP oligonucleotide.Quenching of b/HLH Fluorescence by DNAThe recent cocrystal structure of b/HLH•DNA has shown that b/HLH binds to one duplex DNA as a dimer (Ferré-D'Amaréet al., 1994). We used concentration of dimer as the protein concentration in fitting the fluorescence titration data. The binding of MLP, LCR, and NS DNA to b/HLH showed similar simple quenching curves (Fig. 2). All three DNA bind b/HLH with about the same affinity (Table 1, MLP, Keq = (4.7 ± 0.6) × 105M-1; LCR, Keq = (4.0 ± 0.2) × 105M-1; NS, (3.2 ± 0.1) × 105M-1). The specificity of binding is defined as the equilibrium constant for binding to specific DNA sequences divided by the binding equilibrium constant for binding to nonspecific DNA. Thus, the binding specificity of b/HLH for MLP E-box duplex oligonucleotide compared with the NS sequence is only 1.47, and the binding specificity of b/HLH for LCR binding site oligonucleotide compared with the NS sequence is only 1.25, which suggests little specificity of binding for either oligonucleotide (Table 1). This is in dramatic contrast to the b/HLH/Z protein results shown below.Figure 2:1 μ M b/HLH dimer fluorescence quenching by 0-10 μM double-stranded MLP (○), LCR (□), and NS DNA (∆).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Biphasic Binding of b/HLH/Z with DNAb/HLH/Z forms a homotetrameric complex that has been shown to bind two DNA duplex molecules at the same time (Ferré-D'Amaréet al., 1994). We used a stoichiometry of four b/HLH/Z monomer/two DNA duplex for analysis of the fluorescence titrations. The binding of MLP and LCR DNA to b/HLH/Z showed a dramatic biphasic binding mode (enhancement of fluorescence followed by fluorescence quenching (Fig. 3, A and B)), while the binding of the NS sequence to b/HLH/Z showed a single binding mode (Fig. 3C) as seen for the b/HLH protein. For the biphasic binding of b/HLH/Z to MLP and LCR, the turning point from fluorescence enhancement to fluorescence quenching was at a 1:1 ratio of tetramer b/HLH/Z to duplex DNA (Fig. 3A, 50 nM b/HLH/Z tetramer, 50 nM DNA duplex; Fig. 3B, 0.5 μM b/HLH/Z tetramer, 0.5 μM DNA duplex). Which clearly indicates that two DNAs are binding to a single tetrameric b/HLH/Z and that the two DNA binding sites on the same protein tetramer are not equivalent. The first DNA molecule binding induced a fluorescence enhancement, while the second DNA molecule binding induced fluorescence quenching. b/HLH/Z showed very specific binding toward MLP DNA. The binding constant of b/HLH/Z for MLP is about 1,000-10,000-fold stronger than the binding of the other two DNA (Table 1; MLP, first binding mode, (2.2 ± 2.0) × 109M-1; second binding mode, (1.2 ± 0.8) × 108M-1; LCR, first binding mode, (3.1 ± 3.7) × 106M-1; second binding mode, (3.3 ± 0.6) × 105M-1; NS, second binding mode only, (1.1 ± 0.3) × 105M-1). The specificity of b/HLH/Z binding to MLP E-box compared with the NS sequence is 2.0 × 104 for the first and 1.1 × 103 for the second binding mode. The specificity of b/HLH/Z binding to the LCR sequence compared with the NS sequence is 28 for the first and 3.0 for the second binding mode (Table 1). Results showed that b/HLH/Z has highly specific binding to the adenovirus major late promoter palindromic E-box sequence and moderately specific binding for human locus control region nonpalindrome E-box like sequence when compared with the nonspecific DNA sequence.Figure 3:A, biphasic fluorescence changes of 50 nM tetramer b/HLH/Z upon binding of 0-400 nM MLP E-box sequence; B, biphasic fluorescence changes of 0.5 μM tetramer b/HLH/Z binding with LCR DNA; C, single-phase fluorescence changes of 0.5 μM tetramer b/HLH/Z binding with NS DNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Stopped Flow Fluorescence KineticsThe stopped-flow data for the binding of MLP DNA to the b/HLH and b/HLH/Z were plotted as ΔFversus time as shown in Fig. 4. Fitted curves correspond to the following single-exponential equation (17Olsen K. Christensen U. Sierks M.R. Svensson B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9686-9693Google Scholar).

Bottominset is the residue of fitting plotted on the same × and but different y axis (rightsidebottom).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)where kobs is the observed first-order rate constant, and the ΔF∞ is the maximum fluorescence change.Mechanisms for MLP-b/HLH InteractionTwo possible schemes, a one-step reaction and a two-step reaction, for simple quenching of b/HLH by MLP E-box sequences were considered (10Garland D.L. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4266-4272Google Scholar).The one-step reaction is P+D⇌k−1k1PDREACTION I where k1 and k-1 are forward and reverse rate constants, respectively; P an D refer to protein and DNA. Under the pseudo-first order condition, the observed rate constant is predicted to be a linear function of substrate concentration, i.e.kobs = k1[C] + k-1.The two-step reaction is P+D⇌k−1k1PD*⇌k−2k2PDREACTION II which involves a fast association of protein and DNA followed by a slow change of conformation of the first association complex, PD∗, to the stable complex, PD.The interaction of b/HLH (0.1μM) with MLP E-box under different concentrations of DNA (1,2, and3.5μM) gave about the same kobs (125.8 ± 4.9, 128.9 ± 8.6, and 129.7 ± 5.9 s-1, respectively) within experimental error. The reaction is not a single-step pseudo-first order reaction (). Earlier CD experiments have shown that the b/HLH protein undergoes a 48% conformational change upon binding to MLP sequence (Ferré-D'Amaréet al., 1994), in agreement with Reaction II. Reaction II can be written as (Olsen et al., 1993) kobs=k21+K1[D]+k−2(Eq. 2) where K1 = (k-1)/k1. rearranges to kobs−k−2=k2[D][D]+K1(Eq. 3) If one assumes that k¯2kobs, then kobs=k2[D][D]+K1(Eq. 4) and 1kobs=1k2+Kk2[D](Eq. 5) A plot of 1/kobs versus 1/[D] will give an intercept of 1/k2 (Fig. 5).Figure 5:Kinetics plot of 1/kobsversus 1/[D] of 0.1 μM b/HLH under different MLP DNA concentrations (1, 2, 3.5, and 5 μM, respectively). k2 was obtained as the reciprocal of y intercept (134.4 ± 9.8 s-1).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)This simple model gives a k2 value of 134.4 ± 9.8 s-1 for b/HLH binding with MLP DNA. While more complex models with additional conformational changes will also fit the data, at present there is no experimental data to suggest that such a mechanism is required.Mechanisms for MLP-b/HLH/Z InteractionFour possible mechanisms that can be written for the biphasic (enhancement-quenching) binding behavior of MLP to b/HLH/Z are shown below. |←enhancement→|←quenching→|P+D⇌k−1k1P+D+D⇌k−2k2PD2SCHEME 1 |←enhancement→|←quenching→|P+D⇌k−1k1P+D+D⇌k−2k2DP+D⇌k−3k3PD2SCHEME 2 |←enhancement→|←quenching→|P+D⇌k−1k1PD*⇌k−2k2P+D+D⇌k−3k3PD2SCHEME 3 |←enhancement→|←quenching→|P+D⇌k−1k1PD*⇌k−2k2P+D+D⇌k−3k3DP+D⇌k−4k4PD2SCHEME 4 Assuming that the b/HLH/Z protein complex is a symmetrical homotetramer, the two DNA binding sites would be equivalent prior to the first DNA binding. However, the two DNA binding sites on b/HLH/Z are dramatically different, one causes fluorescence enhancement, and the other causes fluorescence quenching. This can be explained as the result of the first DNA binding causing a conformational change on the second DNA binding site on b/HLH/Z. The conformational change on the first DNA binding event further exposes the tryptophan on the second binding site, thus giving tryptophan fluorescence enhancement instead of fluorescence quenching. The confirmation of conformational changes for first DNA binding rules out the possible Schemes 1 and 2, which suggested one simple binding in the enhancement mode that does not contain a conformational change.The stopped-flow data of b/HLH/Z interaction with MLP DNA was measured as previous described for b/HLH protein. The first DNA binding (fluorescence enhancement phase) for the kinetic interaction was too fast to be observed. We have been able to capture only the fluorescence change of the quenching phase (second DNA binding) of the b/HLH/Z DNA interaction. A simple relaxation curve resembling the curve obtained from b/HLH•DNA interaction was fitted by the same method as described earlier. The similar concentration independence of kobs, 82.4 ± 7.2, 84.5 ± 8.9, and 85.4 ± 4.5 s-1, at different DNA concentrations respectively (Table 2), suggested the involvement of a conformational change as discussed in detail for b/HLH DNA interaction. The initial binding of second DNA is much faster than the conformational change step that follows. The observed kobs approximately equals to the calculated k4 (Table 2, k4 = 87.5 ± 10.6 s-1), the rate constant for the last step (conformational change) in b/HLH/Z MLP binding. The only mechanism that contains two conformational changes is for b/HLH/Z binding with MLP DNA. This mechanism is consistent with the observed kinetics.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONAlthough the leucine zipper motif is not involved in direct contact with DNA during b/HLH/Z binding, it has some crucial effects on DNA binding to the protein. The fact that b/HLH/Z had 1000-100-fold (first DNA binding and second DNA binding, respectively) higher affinity to MLP than b/HLH suggests that the leucine zipper is necessary for high affinity DNA binding. Deletion of the leucine zipper causes the protein to lose the ability to discriminate among DNA sequences (Table 1). Presumably the leucine zipper motif maintains tetramerization of the protein that seems to be important both in binding affinity and in specificity.Both LCR and NS DNA have a significantly lower affinity for b/HLH/Z compared with MLP DNA (Table 1). However, LCR DNA still exhibits a biphasic interaction (enhancement, then quenching), while the NS DNA has only one quenching mode. Although no longer a palindrome, the LCR sequence maintained a less distorted E-box than that of the NS oligonucleotide, which has an extra mutation next to the E-box.These binding affinity results demonstrated that the base immediately outside the E-box has some effect on specific binding especially on a slightly modified E-box sequence. The palindrome in the E-box is a crucial factor for high affinity binding, even a one-base substitution that disturbed this symmetry (from MLP to LCR or NS) caused at least a 100-fold affinity decrease (Table 1).It was demonstrated earlier that the b/HLH/Z tetramer binds two DNA simultaneously (Ferré-D'Amaréet al., 1994). This study shows a sequential binding of two DNA molecules to b/HLH/Z that exhibits an unusual negative cooperativity. A 10-fold decrease on the second DNA binding affinity was observed for both the MLP and the LCR sequences. An anti-cooperative binding mechanism, although unusual, will benefit DNA looping and mismatch correction in the transcription system as explained below (Fig. 6). DNA looping for USF was suggested earlier (Ferré-D'Amaréet al., 1994). DNA looping by USF requires two E-box sequences on the same DNA functioning together. Double E-box sequences are found in many systems. Two equivalent E-box sequences, the insulin enhancer binding sequences (IEB1 and IEB2) were found in the human insulin gene enhancer that binds a helix-loop-helix transcription factor, insulin enhancer factor IEF1. At least one of the IEB sequences was found to bind USF (18Read M.L. Clark A.R. Docherty K. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 233-237Google Scholar). The in vivo transcriptional activity of the insulin gene was only modestly affected (less than 2-fold) when the distance between the two E-box (IEB1 and IEB2) elements are changed in half-integral number of double-helical turns, and the introduction of more than two E-boxes sharply reduce the activity (13Leshkowitz D. Aronheim A. Walker M.D. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 549-558Google Scholar). Two copies of LCR sequences in mice were found binding to USF and functioning together. No activity was observed when there is only one LCR (7Ellis J. Talbot D. Dillon N. Grosveld F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 127-134Google Scholar). Paired E-box sequences were found necessary in mouse muscle creatin kinase gene enhancer, which loses activity when one E-box is removed (14Martin K.A. Walsh K. Mader S.L. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 142: 275-278Google Scholar).Figure 6:Model of selectivity for looped DNA•USF complex formation by anti-cooperative binding during transcription activation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Although USF in different systems may stimulate transcription in a variety of ways, many studies have suggested that in some double E-boxed transcription systems, USF stimulate transcription by DNA looping. In a system where DNA looping is necessary for transcription activation, the anticooperative binding of E-box to USF measured in this study will actually benefit DNA looping and mismatch correction (a model is shown in Fig. 6). Because only looped DNA is activated, two DNA templates connected together by USF (mismatch) on their E-box will not function. However, the second DNA binding is 10 times less than the first one, therefore release of the second DNA from the USF•DNA complex is relatively easy and allows reconstruction of the USF•looped DNA complex. The second E-box on the same DNA is generally closer and more available, i.e. has a much higher effective concentration compared with the E-box on another DNA strand. This negative cooperativity derived selectivity on looped DNA formation will benefit looping and enhance transcription activation. INTRODUCTIONThe human transcription factor USF 1The abbreviations used are: USFupstream stimulating factorbbasicHLHhelix-loop-helixZzipperMLPmajor late promoterNSnonspecificLCRlocus control regionIEBinsulin enhancer binding. is involved in the regulation of both cellular and viral genes. USF belongs to the basic (b)/helix-loop-helix (HLH)/leucine zipper (Z) family of transcription factors and stimulates transcription by binding to a specific E-box motif (CACGTG) upstream of many cellular and viral promoters. Earlier studies identified USF as a cellular factor that activates the intrinsically strong adenovirus major late promoter by binding to an E-box located at position −60 with respect to the cap site (6Carthew R.W. Chodosh L.A. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1985; 43: 439-448Google Scholar; 16Miyamoto N.G. Moncollin V. Egly J.M. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3563-3570Google Scholar; 19Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1985; 43: 165-175Google Scholar) and stimulates transcription, possibly by direct interaction with the transcription factor TFIID (20Sawadogo M. Van Dyke M.W. Gregor P.D. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11985-11993Google Scholar; 15Meisterernst M. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 87: 9153-9157Google Scholar; 3Bungert J. Düring F. Seifart K.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 885-898Google Scholar). USF contains four major domains: A, activation; b, basic domain; HLH, helix-loop-helix domain, and Z, leucine zipper domain. The leucine zipper domain was believed to be necessary for high affinity DNA binding by b/HLH/Z (9Ferré-D'Amaré A.R. Pognonec P. Roeder R.G. Burley S.K. EMBO. 1994; 13: 180-189Google Scholar). The present studies used the b/HLH and b/HLH/Z domains of USF. The recent cocrystal structure of b/HLH•DNA has shown that the b/HLH binds to one duplex DNA as a dimer, and other studies suggested that the b/HLH/Z bind two duplex DNAs at the same time as a homotetramer (9Ferré-D'Amaré A.R. Pognonec P. Roeder R.G. Burley S.K. EMBO. 1994; 13: 180-189Google Scholar), but little is known about the binding affinity, specificity, or the rate of this reaction. The duplex DNA oligomer derived from the adenovirus MLP promoter containing a palindromic E-box (underlined) was used in this study. MLP: 5′-TAGGCCACGTG¯ACCGG3′-ATCCGGTGCAC¯TGGCCSEQUENCE 1 A nonspecific (NS) sequence, which contains three mutations (labeled with ∗) on one half of the sequence, was designed to alter the E-box.

LCR: 5′-TAGA*CCACC*TG¯ACT*GG3′-ATCTGGTGGAC¯TGACCSEQUENCE 3 The comparison of the association constants of USF with LCR, NS and the intrinsically strong MLP sequence will shed light on the sequence-specific interaction of USF with DNA."

https://openalex.org/W1997946016,"The potential of the CREM family of proteins to activate transcription of the genes encoding the testis-specific isozyme of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACET) and the gluconeogenic enzyme, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) (PEPCK) (EC 4.1.1.32) were investigated. Both CREMτ and CREMα bind efficiently to the putative cyclic AMP response element (CRE) present in the ACET gene (CRET) and to the CRE in the PEPCK gene. In HepG2 cells, the CRE was required for the strong stimulation by CREMτ of the expression of a chimeric PEPCK (−210 to +73)-chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) gene. The CRE could be mutated to the CRET sequence without losing the stimulatory effects of CREMτ. However, a similar chimeric gene driven by the regulatory region of the ACET gene, which contains the CRET site, could only be stimulated by CREMτ when its imperfect TATA element was mutated to an authentic TATA. Surprisingly, CREMα, an alleged inhibitor of CRE-mediated transcription, stimulated the expression of both PEPCK-CAT and ACET-CAT genes in HepG2 cells, a process which required the presence of the CRE and the CRET sites, respectively. In contrast, when the same CRE elements were used to drive the transcription of a chimeric gene containing the thymidine kinase promoter linked to the CAT structural gene, CREMα inhibited its expression in HepG2 and JEG3 cells. The expression of the same chimeric gene, however, was stimulated by CREMα in F9 embryonal carcinoma cells. These results demonstrated that the nature of the transcriptional effects of CREM isoforms on CRE-mediated transcription depends on the specific gene, the specific cell type and the promoter context of the CRE site.

Soffer R. Biochemical Regulation of Blood Pressure. Wiley & Sons, New York1981: 123-164Google Scholar). ACE has two isozymic forms. The larger protein, ACEP, is expressed in vascular endothelial cells, kidney and intestinal epithelial cells, macrophages and brain cells(2Patchett A.A. Cordes E.H. Adv. Enzymol. 1985; 57: 1-84PubMed Google Scholar, 3Berg T. Solner J. Lai C.Y. Soffer R.L. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1986; 34: 753-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 4Caldwell P.R.B. Seegal B.C.

Histochem. Cytochem. 1986; 34: 753-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The two isozymes are the products of 5- and 2.5-kilobase mRNAs which are transcribed from the same gene by a tissue-specific choice of two alternative transcription initiation sites and two alternative polyadenylation sites in the gene(6Kumar R.S. Kusari J. Roy S.N. Soffer R.L. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16754-16758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our studies have identified positive and negative regulatory elements present in the 5′-upstream region of the rabbit ACEP transcription unit, which are used both in the vascular endothelial and kidney epithelial cells(7Goraya T.Y. Kessler S.P. Kumar R.S. Douglas J. Sen G.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1194-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This report, on the other hand, deals with the regulation of ACET mRNA transcription.Inspection of the nucleotide sequence 5′ to the rabbit ACET transcription initiation site revealed several putative, but no authentic, transcriptional regulatory elements. There is a TATA-like sequence at −27 and a cyclic AMP response element (CRE)-like sequence at −52(8Kumar R.S. Thekkumkara T.J. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3854-3862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further upstream at −114 and −121, there are sequence motifs similar to one present in the PGK2 gene which is also expressed in sperm cells(9Robinson M.O. McCarrey J.R. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8437-8441Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 10Gebara M.M. McCarrey J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1422-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The ACET gene contains, in addition, several palindromic and repeat sequences which may contribute to its tissue-specific expression(8Kumar R.S. Thekkumkara T.J. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3854-3862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Experimental analysis of the functional roles of these putative sites has, however, been difficult mainly because of the unavailability of in vitro culture systems of the relevant cell types which can be used for transfection of reporter genes and measurements of their resultant expression. To circumvent these problems, transgenic assays have been used. Mice carrying reporter transgenes driven by putative regulatory regions of the ACET gene have been tested for reporter gene expression in the testis. Such an analysis with the rabbit gene has indicated that a region containing 325 bp 5′ to the ACET transcription start site is sufficient for driving sperm-specific expression of the reporter gene. 2R. Erickson, S. P. Kessler, and G. C. Sen, unpublished results. 2R. Erickson, S. P. Kessler, and G. C. Sen, unpublished results. Similar analysis with the mouse gene has narrowed down the regulatory region to 91 bp upstream of the transcription start site(11Howard T. Balogh R. Overbeek P. Bernestein K.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). There are two putative regulatory sites in this region, a CRE-like sequence, CRET, and a TATA-like sequence. We have examined the transcriptional roles, if any, of these elements using a heterologous cell culture system.Our transfection analyses was performed using the HepG2 cell, a hepatoma cell line which has been widely used for studying transcriptional regulation of cAMP-responsive genes. One such gene encodes the gluconeogenic enzyme, PEPCK. The transcriptional regulation of the PEPCK gene has been extensively studied by us (12Park E.A. Roesler W.J. Liu J. Klemm D.J. Gurney A.L.

We have shown that a chimeric PEPCK-CAT gene containing a region from −210 to +73 of the PEPCK promoter is responsive to cAMP in hepatoma cells(14Park E.A. Gurney A.L. Nizielski S.E. Hakini P. Cao Z. Moorman A. Hanson R.W. J. Biol Chem. 1993; 268: 613-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A CRE present in this region mediates the major portion of the cAMP response(13Liu J. Park E.A.

Chem. 1992; 267: 2530-2536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several trans-acting factors can bind to this element and activate transcription(14Park E.A. Gurney A.L. Nizielski S.E.

In the current study, we have analyzed the potential role of CREMτ and CREMα in the regulation of PEPCK gene transcription in HepG2 cells and have compared the results of this analysis with the induction of transcription of the gene for ACET.Since the CRE-like site may be involved in sperm-specific regulation of ACET expression, we were also interested in determining the trans-acting factors which are preferentially expressed in sperm cells and bind to this regulatory element. One such family of proteins, the CREM proteins, has been recently described(20Foulkes N.S. Borrelli E. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1991; 64: 739-749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). This family of proteins originates from the same gene by cell-specific alternative splicing. They all contain DNA-binding domains, which recognize the CRE, and a phosphorylation box which is the target of phosphorylation by cAMP-activated PKA. Some isoforms such as CREMτ contain, in addition, glutamine-rich domains which are absent from other isoforms such as CREMα. CREMτ is a strong activator of transcription, which is cAMP dependent and mediated by the CRE. On the other hand, other forms lacking the glutamine-rich domain, such as CREMα, have been shown to repress CRE-mediated transcription(21Delmas V. Laoide B.M. Masquilier D. DeGroot R.P. Foulkes N.S. Sassone-Corsi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4226-4230Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Thus, the relative levels of CREMτ and CREMα can control the extent of cAMP-mediated gene transcription in cell types which express these proteins. Both activator and repressor isoforms of CREM are found at a low level in immature sperm cells. But during later stages of sperm differentiation, there is a pronounced isoform switch so that a large level of CREMτ, the activator form, is produced(22Foulkes N.S. Mellstrom B. Benusiglio E. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1992; 355: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 23Foulkes N.S. Schlotter F. Pevet P. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1993; 362: 264-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Since ACET is expressed in maturing sperm, CREMτ could be a strong candidate for promoting its transcription. This hypothesis was tested in the current study.Our studies demonstrated that CREMτ stimulated transcription via both the CRE of the PEPCK gene and the CRET of the ACET gene. Expression of the latter gene in HepG2 cells required, in addition, mutation of the TATA-like sequence to an authentic TATA. Unexpectedly, CREMα also stimulated transcription of both genes. Further experiments demonstrated that the ability of CREMα to stimulate or repress gene transcription depends on the promoter context of the CRE sequence and the cell type.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsAll DNA-modifying enzymes were obtained from either Life Technologies, Inc. or Boehringer Mannheim. Oligonucleotides were obtained from Operon Technologies Inc. [14C]Chloramphenicol (50.10 mCi/mmol) and [α-32P]dCTP (3000Ci/mmol) at 10 mCi/ml were purchased from Dupont NEN. Cell culture products were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. and Cell Culture Laboratories, Cleveland, OH. Sequencing reactions were performed using Sequenase and dideoxy reagents purchased from U. S. Biochemical Corp.Construction of PlasmidsThe PEPCK-CAT expression plasmids have been described previously(12Park E.A. Roesler W.J. Liu J. Klemm D.J. Gurney A.L. Thatcher D. Shuman J. Friedman A.

Plasmids pSVCREMτ and pSVCREMα were kind gifts of P. Sassone-Corsi. They contain the CREMτ and CREMα cDNAs cloned in the EcoRI site of the pSG5 vector(20Foulkes N.S. Borrelli E. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1991; 64: 739-749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 21Delmas V. Laoide B.M. Masquilier D. DeGroot R.P. Foulkes N.S. Sassone-Corsi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4226-4230Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This vector contains both the SV40 early promoter and the T7 promoter and therefore can be used for both in vivo and in vitro eukaryotic expression(25Green S. Isemann I. Sheer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 369Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). The expression vector for the C subunit of PKA contains the ubiquitously active SRα promoter to direct the expression of the catalytic subunit of PKA and was provided by M. Muramatsu(26Muramatsu M. Kaibuchi K. Arai K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 831-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).Site-directed mutagenesis of the PEPCK-CAT and ACET-CAT vectors was performed using the Muta-Gene®174; phagemid in vitro mutagenesis system from Bio-Rad, strictly following the manufacturer's instructions. All mutations of the PEPCK gene promoter were performed in the single stranded replicative form of the PTZ18R derived PEPCK-CAT expression vectors, as described previously(12Park E.A. Roesler W.J. Liu J. Klemm D.J. Gurney A.L. Thatcher D. Shuman J. Friedman A. Hanson R.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6264-6272Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 24Liu J. Roesler W.J. Hanson R.W. Biotechniques. 1990; 9: 738-742PubMed Google Scholar). −210CRE2 mCREmPEPCK-CAT and −210CRE2 mACETPEPCK-CAT constructs were thus obtained by using mutagenizing oligonucleotides, CRE1 mTYGS and CRETOACET, on the −210CRE2 mPEPCK-CAT background, respectively. Mutagenesis of −85ACET gene promoter was performed by subcloning this gene segment in the pBlueScript(KS) vector. TATAm oligonucleotide was used to generate the −85ACETTATAm vector. All subcloning reactions were performed using directional cloning strategies and were confirmed by multiple restriction digestion analysis. All site-directed mutations were confirmed by sequencing using the dideoxy sequencing reaction.The chimeric TK-CAT gene contains a −109 to +51 segment of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene (where transcription state site is designated as +1), ligated upstream of the CAT gene. To generate the CRETK-CAT and CRETTK-CAT plasmids, blunted double-stranded 18-bp oligonucleotides containing the CRE and CRET sequences were cloned 5′ to the TK promoter in the blunted BamHI site of the TK-CAT vector. Plasmids with single copies of CRE and CRET sequences inserted at the correct position and orientation were selected by sequencing several clones.In Vitro Transcription and Translation of CREM Transcription FactorsTNTTM-coupled reticulocyte lysate system from Promega was used to synthesize CREM proteins for electrophoretic mobility-shift assays. Briefly, the reaction consisted of TNT rabbit reiculocyte lysate, 25 μl; TNT reaction buffer, 2 μl; T7 RNA polymerase, 1 μl; 1 mM amino acid mixture minus methionine, 1 μl; 1 mM methionine, 1 μl; RNasin ribonuclease inhibitor (40 units/μl), 1 μl; miniprep plasmid DNA substrate, 2 μl; and diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated H2O to a final volume of 50 μl. Incubation was carried out at 30°C for 90 min. In vitro translated proteins were used either fresh or after storing at −70°C. It is critical that the substrate plasmid DNA isolated using Qiagen is extracted with phenol:cholroform to remove any traces of RNase A. In order to confirm that CREMα and CREMτ protein of the correct size were produced, the synthesis reaction was also performed by substituting cold methionine with 2 μl of [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml). The radioactive products were visualized by separation on a 4% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography (results not shown).Electrophoretic Mobility Shift AssayAn electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed using a modification of the method described by Sassone-Corsi et al.(27Sassone-Corsi P. Lamph W.W. Kamps M. Verma I.M. Cell. 1988; 54: 553-560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). DNA-protein binding was carried out in a final volume of 20 μl. One μl of reticulocyte lysate reaction mixture was incubated with 1 μg of poly(dI•dC) in 1 × TM buffer at room temperature for 20 min. 5 × TM buffer stock solution consists of 250 mM Tris pH 7.9, 62.5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol, and 70% glycerol. A synthetic 18-bp double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide containing the CRE sequence from the PEPCK gene was labeled with 32P by filling-in with Klenow using [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) at 10 mCi/ml. Approximately 50 pg of the 32P-labeled probe (~40,000 cpm) and any competitor cold DNA were added together to the preincubated protein extracts. After another incubation at room temperature for 10 min, the DNA-protein complexes were separated on a 4% polyacrylamide gel (39:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) in 0.25 × TBE (1 × TBE is 50 mM Tris borate (pH 8.3), 1 mM EDTA). The gels were dried and exposed for autoradiography; quantification of bands was performed using a PhosphorImager.Double-stranded CRE, CRE2, CREmut, and CRET probes were prepared by annealing synthetic complimentary oligodeoxynucleotides followed by enzymatic filling-in of the shorter strands: ACETCRESEN, GGCCCCTTACGTCAGAGG; ACETCREAS, CCTCTGACGTAAGGGGCC; CRE2S, GGCCGGCCCCTTAGGTCAGAGGCGAGC; CRE2AS, GCCTCTGACCTAAGGGGCC; CREmTYGS, GGCCGGCCCCCTGCGGACAGAGGCGAGC; CREmTYGAS, GCCTCTGTCCGCAGGGGCC; CRE1TOACET, GGCCGGCCCCCTGAGGTCAGAGGCGAGC; ACEtAS, GCCTCTGACCTCAGGGGCC.Cell CultureCell lines derived from American opossum kidney (OPK), JEG-3 cells, mouse F9 embryonal carcinoma cells, and human cervical carcinoma (Hela) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mML-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (complete medium). F9 cells were cultured on gelatin-coated plates. Human hepatoma (HepG2) cell line was grown in minimum essential medium-α supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For maintenance in culture, all cells were grown in 175-mm2 flasks and split at a ratio of 1:5 upon achievement of confluence. Hela and HepG2 cells were split from one confluent flask into eight 100-mm plates a day before the transfection. This way the cells were at approximately 60% confluence for transfection the next day. F9 cells were trypsinized and replated every other day to prevent their spontaneous differentiation.DNA Transient Transfection AssaysPlasmid DNA was purified using Qiagen columns (Qiagen, Inc.) and transfected into F9, OPK, Hela, or HepG2 cells using calcium phosphate precipitation method(28Kalvakolanu D.V.R. Bandyopadhyay S.K. Tiwari R.K. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 873-879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfections were carried out in 100-mm plates using 5 or 10 μg of reporter CAT plasmid and where indicated, 5 μg of Srα-PKA expression plasmid and 5 μg of CREMτ or CREMα expression plasmids. Total amount of transfected DNA in each plate was kept constant at 15 or 20 μg by using 5 or 10 μg of pUC 18 plasmid. Cell cultures grown to 60% confluence received DNA-calcium phosphate precipitate in 3 ml of complete medium. Sixteen hours later, cells were shocked with 20% dimethyl sulfoxide in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 2 min and then incubated in complete medium. Cells were harvested 40 h post-transfection. Extracts were prepared by repeated freeze-thawing, and CAT activity was assayed as described previously (28Kalvakolanu D.V.R. Bandyopadhyay S.K. Tiwari R.K. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 873-879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Acetylated and non-acetylated forms of chloramphenicol on the TLC were quantified using a PhosphorImager screen (Molecular Dynamics). Percent acetylation/unit volume of cell extract was normalized to the protein concentrations of cell extracts and expressed as relative CAT activities in arbitrary units. To ensure reproducibility of results, each experiment was performed in duplicate or triplicate and repeated at least three times using different batches of cells and plasmid DNA preparations.RESULTSDifferent Affinities of Different CRE Sequences for Binding to CREMτ and CREMαIn order to evaluate the potential of the CREs present in the genes for ACET and PEPCK, to mediate CREM-driven transcriptional stimulation, we first determined the relative affinities of these sequences for binding two members of the CREM family of proteins: CREMτ and CREMα. These proteins, generated by in vitro transcription/translation of the corresponding cDNAs, were used for electrophoretic mobility shift assays (Fig. 1). The radiolabeled probe used for this assay was the CRE present in the PEPCK gene (Table1). CREMα produced two prominent shifted complexes (Fig. 1, lane 3), which probably represent the probe bound to a monomer or a dimer of CREMα. Two slower moving complexes were formed with CREMτ (lane 4), which is a larger protein than CREMα. When competed for binding to the probe, the unlabeled CRE was very effective (lanes 5-8), whereas a cryptic CRE (CRE2) present in the PEPCK gene between −155 and −135, and the CRET sequence present in the ACET gene were less effective. A mutated CRE sequence (CREmut) failed to compete even at the highest concentration tested. The profile for binding of different CRE sequences to CREMα was parallel to that for CREMτ (data not shown). In order to assign quantitative values to the binding efficiencies of the different CREs to CREMτ and CREMα, we determined the molar amounts of each oligonucleotide required to diminish the labeled shifted bands by 50% (Table1). The amount of unlabeled PEPCK CRE required to achieve 50% reduction of the band intensity was assigned the value of 1. To obtain the same level of reduction, 16-fold more CRET was required for binding to CREMτ and 5-fold more CRET was required for binding to CREMα. CRE2 was even less efficient than CRET for binding to either protein, whereas CREmut was at least two orders of magnitude less efficient than the functional CRE from the PEPCK promoter. It is curious to note that CRET has a higher affinity than CRE2, although the latter varies from the functional CRE in the PEPCK promoter in only one position, whereas the former has changes in two nucleotides out of eight. These results suggested that CRE and CRE2 of the PEPCK gene and CRET from the gene for ACET all have the potential to interact with CREMτ and CREMα.TABLE I Open table in a new tab Transcription Stimulation by CREMτ via CRE and CRE2 of PEPCK GeneIn the next series of experiments, we tested the ability of the CRE and CRE2 sites of the PEPCK gene to mediate transcriptional activation by CREMτ, a protein known to activate gene transcription. The transcriptional response of a series of chimeric PEPCK-CAT genes to expression of CREMτ was determined. These studies were performed using HepG2 cells in which the PEPCK promoter has been previously shown to control the transcription of linked structural genes in a regulated manner. The PEPCK promoter extending from the −210 upstream position to the +73 position relative to the start site (−210PEPCK-CAT) (Fig. 2A) drove the expression of the CAT gene at a low level in these cells. Upon cotransfection with the SRαPKA plasmid, that encodes the catalytic subunit of PKA under the control of a constitutively active promoter, the level of CAT expression increased by about 2-fold (Fig. 2B). Upon cotransfection with pSVCREMτ the level of CAT expression increased dramatically both in the presence and absence of PKA. As expected, the overall levels of stimulation observed in the presence of PKA were much higher than in its absence.Figure 2:Transcription stimulation by CREMτ via the CRE sites of PEPCK gene. A, schematic diagram of the PEPCK-CAT promoter from −210 to +73 positions, where +1 is the transcription start site. Important protein binding domains within this region of the PEPCK gene are outlined above the promoter. B, HepG2 cells were transfected with plasmids containing the PEPCK-CAT with serial 5′ deletions in the PEPCK promoter starting at positions indicated below the bars. 5 μg of PEPCK-CAT plasmid were transfected alone (open bar); cotransfected with 5 μg of CREMτ expression vector (striped bar); cotransfected with 5 μg of an expression plasmid for the C subunit of PKA (hatched bar); cotransfected with SRα-PKA and CREMτ expression plasmids (solid bar). Each bar represents the mean value from a duplicate experiment, and the dot over the bar shows the higher value. Each experiment was performed at least three times using at least two different plasmid DNA preparations and batches of cells. C, transfections were carried out in HepG2 cells using 5 μg of −210PEPCK-CAT plasmids containing specific mutations in the protein binding domains of the promoter. The sites which were block mutated are indicated on the horizontal axis. Open bar, cotransfected with 5 μg of SRα-PKA; solid bar, 5 μg of SRα-PKA and 5 μg of CREMτ. Data analysis and presentation are similar to those described for B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Since the region of the PEPCK promoter between −210 and +73 contains several well characterized cis-acting binding sites (Fig. 2A), a series of 5′-deletion mutants were tested to identify the site responsible for the mediation of CREMτ stimulation. The PEPCK promoter deleted to −174 (−174 to +73) lacks the HNF-1 binding site and was stimulated by the C subunit of PKA and CREMτ to levels very similar to those seen with the PEPCK promoter deleted to −210 (Fig. 2B). The region of the PEPCK promoter between −174 and +73 contains two putative CRE sites (CRE and CRE2) and an NF-1 binding site. Further deletion to −109 upstream position of PEPCK promoter decreased its basal activity to about 15% of that noted with the promoter deleted to −210 but a pronounced stimulation was still observed with the cotransfection of CREMτ. The PEPCK promoter deleted to −109 contains only the CRE which has previously been shown to bind CREB, Fos/Jun heterodimers and members of C/EBP family of transcription factors. These results suggest that the CRE is sufficient for mediating the effect of CREMτ on transcription from the PEPCK promoter.To further elucidate the role of the various cis-elements, mutants of these sites in the PEPCK promoter bretween −210 and +73 were tested. When the CRE2 site was mutated, there was a negligible effect on transcription from the PEPCK promoter in HepG2 cells (Fig. 2C). Similarly, mutation of the NF-1 site did not alter either the basal level of transcriuption from the PEPCK promoter or the CREMτ-induced level of expression. Mutation of the CRE, on the other hand, decreased both levels drastically. Since transcription was stimulated to a slight extent with the CRE mutated, it is possible that at least some effects of CREMτ on PEPCK gene expression is mediated through the CRE2 site. This observation is consistent with the observed weaker but detectable binding of CRE2 to CREMτ in gel shift assays (Table1). When both CRE and CRE2 sites were mutated, the response to CREMτ was completely abrogated.Transcriptional Stimulation by CREMτ via CRETIn order to assess whether the putative CRE-like site from the ACET promoter (CRET) supports CREMτ mediated stimulation in vivo, the C"

Recent experiments suggest that 3-base pair homology adjacent to the points of exchange at each end of the spacer is utilized in a base complementarity-dependent strand joining reaction. Homology of the central 2 base pairs of the spacer is also critical, but how homology is tested at these two positions is unknown. We have addressed the role of homology-dependent branch migration in Flp recombination by assaying strand cleavage and resolution in a set of synthetic Holliday junctions in which the branch point is freely or partially mobile through the spacer, or is immobilized at each position within the spacer or immediately flanking it. A strong bias in the direction of Holliday resolution is observed only when the branch point is located just outside the spacer (at the junction of the Flp binding element and the spacer). A significantly smaller bias is noticed when the branch point is frozen immediately adjacent to this position within the spacer. Resolution in these cases is most often mediated by exchange of the scissile phosphodiesters at the branch point or proximal to it, and rarely by exchange of the scissile phosphodiesters distal to it. In light of these and previous results, we discuss possible checkpoints for testing partner compatibility during Flp recombination.

Recombination catalyzed by site-specific recombinases of the Int family, for example, the λ Int protein, the Flp protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the Cre protein from phage P1, proceeds in two steps of single strand exchanges, a Holliday junction being an obligatory intermediate. The reaction is dependent on absolute homology between partner substrates within the region of strand exchange (or overlap segment, or spacer) (12Craig N.L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 77-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar; 28Sadowski P.D. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 760-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The λ Int reaction has been extensively explored with regard to its requirement for homology between recombination partners. Results from a large number of experiments (32Weisberg R.A. Enquist L.W.

The yield of the Holliday intermediate is dependent on the position of heterology. When the heterology is immediately adjacent to the point of top strand exchange, Holliday junctions are not detected. Presumably, a junction blocked in the immediate vicinity of the first exchange point is resolved to the parental strands by a reversal of the exchange reaction. As pointed out, the Flp site-specific recombinase (which plays a central role in the copy number control of the yeast plasmid 2-μm circle; reviewed in 6Broach J.R. Volkert F.C. Broach J.R.

Recent studies using half-site and full-site substrates have yielded new insights into how homology is utilized by the Flp recombinase in testing compatibility between partner substrates (19Lee J. Jayaram M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4042-4052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The first critical functional role of homology during recombination appears to be in aligning the 5′-hydroxyl group of a nicked DNA strand using Watson-Crick base pairing during the strand joining reaction. The results are consistent with a model in which homology-dependent branch migration of the Holliday intermediate may be limited essentially to the central 2-4 bp 1The abbreviation used is: bpbase pair(s). region of the spacer sequence (see Fig. 1). One implication of this model is that the cross-over point might be fixed within the spacer during the strand joining events that generate the covalently closed Holliday intermediate and the strand cleavage events that lead to its resolution. base pair(s). Synthetic Holliday junctions have been used as substrates in the analysis of recombination reactions carried out by at least three recombinases of the Int family: λ Int, Flp, and the XerC/XerD proteins of Escherichia coli (15Hsu P.L.

In principle, a Holliday junction may be resolved in one of two modes, giving rise to “parental” or “recombinant” duplexes. In this study, we have used a series of synthetic Flp Holliday junctions to address the following question: does the placement of the cross-over point within the spacer region constrain the resolution of the Holliday junction to parentals or recombinants? The model proposed by Lee and Jayaram(1995) supposes that some branch migration within the spacer may be required (or occurs commensurate with) the switching of the recombination complex from the Holliday forming mode (first pair of exchanges) to the recombinant yielding mode (second pair of exchanges). Arresting branch migration at specific points may then be expected to introduce detectable bias in the direction of Holliday resolution. We tested this notion by assaying the resolution of synthetic immobilized Holliday junctions by Flp. While this study was in progress, Dixon and Sadowski (1994) reported that Holliday structures in which the branch point within the spacer was placed adjacent to one pair of Flp binding elements or 4 or 5 bp away from them could be resolved by Flp. However, a large bias in the direction of resolution was observed only with the first of these three junctions. The Dixon-Sadowski results provided further impetus to complete the analyses presented in this paper. Reactions were done with the wild-type Flp protein. The protein was partially purified essentially as described by 26Prasad P.V. Young L.-J. Jayaram M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2189-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar. Further purification was achieved by chromatography on an affinity column containing oligomeric Flp-site oligodeoxynucleotides linked to CNBr-activated Sepharose (25Parson R.L. Evans B.R. Zheng L. Jayaram M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4527-4533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purity of the final Flp preparations was approximately 90%. Flp protein concentrations were estimated by comparisons between densitometric scans of Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained Flp aliquots (fractionated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels) and similar scans of known amounts of bovine serum albumin. Oligodeoxynucleotides for construction of Holliday junctions were synthesized in an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer (model 380A) using phosphoramidite chemistry (5Beaucage S.L. Caruthers M.H. Tetrahedron Lett. 1981; 22: 1859-1862Crossref Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). Approximately 2-4 pmol each of the appropriate oligodeoxynucleotides were mixed in TE (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8 at 23°C, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0), heated to 65°C for 10 min, and cooled slowly to room temperature. Normally the radioactively labeled strand was held at one-half to one-third the concentration of the unlabeled partner strands during hybridization. The synthetic Holliday junctions were gel purified prior to being used in strand cleavage or resolution assays. The relevant features of the synthetic substrates are described under “Results” and displayed in the figures. The complete sequences of the substrates are available upon request. The 3′ end of a deoxyoligonucleotide was labeled with 3-α-32P-labeled cordycepin triphosphate using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase enzyme. The excess unreacted cordycepin triphosphate was removed by spin-dialysis on a Sephadex G-25 column. Hybridization to the partner oligodeoxynucleotide(s) was done in TE. The conditions for the assays were essentially the same as those described previously for recombination assays (7Chen J.W. Lee J. Jayaram M. Cell. 1992; 69: 627-658Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Normally the reactions contained approximately 0.02 pmol of the Holliday junction and an excess of Flp (4-8 pmol of Flp/pmol of Flp binding element) in a reaction volume of 30 μl. Reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS (0.1% final concentration) and treated with proteinase K (100 μg/reaction for 1 h at 37°C). After chloroform-phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, the DNA was fractionated by electrophoresis in 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gels (acrylamide/bis-acrylamide, 19:1). Since the reactions contained a radioactively labeled substrate, the strand cleavage and resolution products were visualized by autoradiography. Restriction enzyme digestions, isolation of plasmid DNA, and other miscellaneous procedures were done as described by 21Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar. A recent model for Flp site-specific recombination (Lee and Jayaram(1995); see Fig. 1) proposes that, following cleavage of the two phosphodiester bonds at one end of the spacer (say left), three nucleotides adjacent to the cut are swapped between partner substrates (Fig. 1, A and B). After testing complementarity between the swapped segments and the uncut strands, ends are sealed to form a covalently closed Holliday intermediate (Fig. 1C). At this stage of the reaction, the cross-strand junction is placed 3 bp away from the point of initial exchange (between spacer positions 3 and 4). An isomerization of the recombination complex is thought to occur by which the cross is positioned 3 bp away from the right end of the spacer (between positions 4′ and 3′; Fig. 1D). This step would likely involve branch migration through the central 2 bp of the spacer (4 and 4′). Cleavage of the phosphodiesters at the right end, three nucleotide swapping (E) and strand joining (F) will then yield reciprocally recombinant products. This model has striking parallels to that arrived at for λ Int recombination from the pattern of resolution by Int of Holliday structures in which the junction is immobilized at different points within the spacer sequence (22Nunes-Duby S.E. Matsumoto L. Landy A. Cell. 1987; 50: 779-788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The relative efficiency of resolution as well as the bias in the direction of resolution (exchange of top strands or bottom strands) is found to be exquisitely dependent upon where, within the spacer, the junction is frozen. These results would be consistent with features of the Lee-Jayaram model for Flp recombination outlined above. The issue then is: does the branch point within the Holliday structure exert positional effects in the efficiency and direction of resolution reactions mediated by Flp? Two synthetic Holliday structures were constructed, such that the junction was freely mobile from end to end within the spacer in one (Fig. 2A), and only partially mobile (between positions 3 and 3′) in the other (Fig. 2B). In the latter substrate, the points at which the strand crossing would be trapped (between 3 and 4 at the left and between 3′ and 4′ on the right) correspond to those positions where the Lee-Jayaram model implicates them to be positioned at the Holliday forming and Holliday resolving steps of recombination. Cleavage of each of the four strands and the corresponding resolution events mediated by Flp were assayed in four separate experiments with each of the two substrates. Data are presented for one pair of matched assays (for cleavages occurring at C1 (right) and C2 (left)) per substrate. The other pair of matched assays (for cleavages occurring at C3 (right) and C4 (left)) yielded comparable results. The cleavage products are denoted by Cand the resolution product by R (Fig. 2). For example, the cleavage product from strand 1 is called C1, and the corresponding resolution product resulting from strand 1 to strand 3 joining is called R1,3. The extent of reaction at the scissile phosphodiester within a strand was quantitated from densitometric scans as the sum of the intensities of the cleavage plus resolution bands. The index of resolution bias to the left, IL, calculated from the data in Fig. 2 are arranged in Table1(bottom two rows). The index of the rightward resolution bias, IR, would be 1/IL. We conclude that there is no detectable bias in the direction of resolution of the fully mobile or the partially mobile Holliday junction. This result would be in agreement with the expectation from the Lee-Jayaram model.TABLE I Open table in a new tab Can a bias in the resolution mode be detected if the junction is trapped closer to one or the other end of the spacer? If a bias does exist, does it favor resolution at the exchange points proximal to it or those distal to it? To answer these questions, a series of Holliday junctions were synthesized (A-I, Fig. 3) in which the cross-over points were placed at the indicated positions by flanking them with heterologies on either side. Strand cleavage and resolution within these substrates were assayed as described for experiments in Fig. 2. The results are displayed in Fig. 4A-I, and summarized in Table1. We know, from previous analyses (Lee and Jayaram, 1995), that the strand joining reaction is adversely affected by base non-complementarity at 2-3 nt positions adjacent to the 5′-hydroxyl that serves as the phosphoryl acceptor. Since the construction of the immobilized junctions requires placement of heterologies on either side of the cross, strand joining during the resolution event is not expected to follow similar kinetics for each of the nine synthetic Holliday structures. It is also likely that the individual spacer sequences will have some effect (though modest) on the strand cleavage and resolution events. The data from Fig. 4 do indeed show that not all Holliday substrates are cleaved and/or resolved with equal efficiency. Given these variabilities, the results from Fig. 4 and Table. I reveal certain clear-cut trends. Two junctions, those in which the branch was located at the normal strand cleavage/joining points of a recombination reaction (between 0 and 1 and 1′ and 0′), showed a strong preference in the mode of resolution (rows A and I of Table1). Similarly, the junctions immobilized between spacer positions 1 and 2 and 2′ and 1′ were also resolved with an obvious, but less pronounced bias (rows B and H of Table1). Furthermore, the junction immobilized at or adjacent to the left end of the spacer was resolved predominantly by cleavage of the scissile phosphodiesters at the left. Conversely, the junction immobilized at or adjacent to the right end of the spacer showed preferential resolution at the right. These conclusions were corroborated (although the data are not shown here) by the indices of resolution bias estimated for cleavage/joining reactions at C3 and C4 rather than at C1 and C2 (see Fig. 3 and legend to Table 1). In four of the five remaining junctions (each harboring a branch point internal to the spacer), a significant correlation between the locations of the cross and the choice of the exchange points for resolution was not observed (rows C-E, and G of Table1). The exception to this rule was the junction with the cross-over point fixed between spacer positions 4′ and 3′. It was resolved with a distinct bias (roughly 2-fold) to the right (row F, Table1).Figure 4:Resolution of immobilized junctions by Flp. Results from two separate assays with each Holliday structure (A-I, see Fig. 3) carried out as described under Fig. 2 are shown. The symbols S, C, and R refer to substrate, cleavage product, and resolution product, respectively. The asterisk stands for the 3′ end-label.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The resolution bias observed for the various junction substrates could result from a bias in strand cleavage, or in strand joining following cleavage, or may reflect the balance between these two reactions. Lee and Jayaram(1995) observed that the strand joining reaction uses base complementarity primarily at the two spacer positions adjacent to the nick, with a minor contribution from the third position as well. Spacer positions beyond the third nucleotide appear to have little effect on the kinetics of joining. In the case of the left end junctions A and B, there is no heterology at the right end and hence no bias in joining imposed by base non-complementarity. On the other hand, at the left end, heterology would favor joining in the parental mode rather than in the resolution mode. As a result, the bias toward left resolution observed here for A and B is likely to be underestimated. By similar arguments, the right bias for H and I would also be under-represented. As the heterology responsible for trapping the cross is moved away from spacer positions that influence the joining reaction, interference to resolution by non-complementarity should fade. The relatively higher levels of resolution products obtained with such junctions (for example, compare D, E, and F to A and B, and H and I in Fig. 4) agree with this idea. The above results complement and extend those obtained by Dixon and Sadowski(1994). We find that the lack of resolution bias they observed at two positions within the spacer holds true for several other positions internal to the spacer. In addition, the strong resolution bias seen at the exchange point flanking the spacer at one end is reproducible at the other end as well, but in the opposite direction. The Flp site-specific recombination is exquisitely sensitive to spacer non-homology between DNA partners at every nucleotide position within the 8-bp strand exchange region. A single base pair spacer heterology between partner substrates is sufficient to reduce recombination to undetectable levels under in vitro reaction conditions (1Andrews B.J. Mcleod M. Broach J.

According to a recent proposal (19Lee J. Jayaram M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4042-4052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar; see Fig. 1), part of the spacer homology is utilized in ensuring strand joining between correct partner substrates. The model speculates that the remainder of the homology is likely involved in coupling limited branch migration of the Holliday intermediate to an isomerization step in which the active site configuration of the recombinase tetramer is reorganized to perform the resolution reaction. Observations regarding resolution of synthetic Holliday junctions by the λ Int protein (24Nunes-Duby S.E. Azaro M.A. Landy A. Current Biol. 1995; 5: 139-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) fit into a model that has close parallels to features of the Lee-Jayaram model. They found that a Holliday junction in which the branch can migrate through just the central base pair of the overlap region, but is blocked 3 bp from the exchange points at either end, is resolved by Int with roughly equal probability to parentals or to recombinants. Furthermore, in two junctions in which the strand crossing is trapped between the central base pair and its immediate left neighbor or its immediate right neighbor, the resolution reactions show a large bias, toward parentals in one case and toward recombinants in the other. It would seem likely therefore that the limited requirement for branch migration in the Flp and Int systems might serve the same functional purpose. Impressed by the apparent congruence of the roles of homology in Int and Flp recombinations, arrived at from two widely different approaches, we tested whether the correlation between the location of the cross and the mode of Holliday resolution seen with Int is reproducible with Flp as well. We find that a fully mobile junction, or one restricted in mobility through the central 2-bp core of the spacer, is resolved efficiently by Flp with no obvious bias in the direction of resolution. This result is analogous to that obtained with Int and is fully expected from the Lee-Jayaram model. However, our results and those of Dixon and Sadowski(1994) show a general lack of large resolution bias internal to the spacer, regardless of the spacer position at which a junction is locked in. In this regard, the Flp and Int results are quite distinct. Only when the junction is immobilized at the normal exchange points to the immediate left or the immediate right of the spacer does a strong preference in the resolution mode become apparent with Flp. In summary, the inference from the Lee-Jayaram model that an immobilized Holliday structure resolved by Flp with a large bias in one direction must have a symmetric counterpart resolved in the opposite direction is satisfied by the experimental results recorded here. Intuitively, one would have expected these immobilization points to be 3 bp away from one spacer end in one case, and 3 bp away from the opposite spacer end in the other. In reality, they are located at either end of the spacer and not internal to it. One interpretation of the results cited above is that the effect of spacer heterology in Flp recombination is much less pronounced than is generally believed. Provided a Holliday junction is formed with its branch point located away from the Flp binding element-spacer junction, it has roughly equal chances for being resolved into recombinants or into parentals. The failure then to obtain recombinants in presence of spacer heterology likely results from a reverse recombination of the spacer mismatched products before they dissociate from the reaction complex. Can we envisage an alternate reaction scheme for Flp recombination in which our present results on Holliday junction resolution can be reconciled with the basic features of the Lee-Jayaram proposal? In attempting to do so, we rely primarily on the special architectural design of the Flp active site (7Chen J.W. Lee J. Jayaram M. Cell. 1992; 69: 627-658Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 8Chen J.W. Evans B.R. Rosenfeldt H. Jayaram M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 119: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar; 33Yang S.H. Jayaram M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12789-12796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assembly of a functional strand cleavage pocket within a Flp monomer bound adjacent to a scissile phosphodiester requires that the active nucleophile (Tyr343) be delivered in trans from a partner Flp monomer bound across the spacer (20Lee J. Whang I. Lee J. Jayaram M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5346-5354Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This delivery is accommodated by the large protein induced bend within the spacer DNA (31Schwartz C.J.E. Sadowski P.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar; 8Chen J.W. Evans B.R. Rosenfeldt H. Jayaram M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 119: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Similarly, the strand joining pocket within the same Flp monomer is rendered functional when the 5′-hydroxyl group from the Flp-nicked strand is delivered to it in trans and oriented within it via Watson-Crick base pairing (Lee and Jayaram, 1995). Thus a Flp monomer is able to perform a concerted cleavage-joining event through a composite active site which recruits the appropriate reactive group for each reaction from a second Flp monomer or from the Flp-cleaved DNA substrate. In principle, therefore, two monomers of Flp separated by the spacer can cooperate to assemble two active sites, a Holliday forming pocket and a Holliday resolving pocket (9Chen J.W. Yang S.H. Jayaram M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14417-14425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, strong circumstantial evidence indicates that at one time only one of the two active sites can be organized (27Qian X.-H. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21779-21788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2J. Lee and M. Jayaram, unpublished data. For example, within a full-site occupied by two Flp monomers, cleavages are almost exclusively single-stranded. Similarly, within the dimeric form of a Flp-half-site complex, the maximum obtainable cleavage corresponds to cutting at half of the scissile phosphodiesters. Exclusion of the second active site upon assembly of the first is functionally analogous to the phenomenon of half of the sites activity seen in certain allosteric enzymes. Thus, for successful completion of recombination, the active sites mediating formation of Holliday intermediate (at one end of the spacer) must be disassembled, and those mediating its resolution (at the other end of the spacer) must be assembled within the two “across the spacer” Flp pairs. 3J. Lee and M. Jayaram, manuscript submitted for publication. We consider this disassembly-assembly process to be synonymous with the branch migration (or isomerization) step that is central to the Lee-Jayaram model (see Fig. 1). Given the shared active site and half of the sites activity of Flp, one may imagine that, during one round of recombination, the reactive protein•DNA complex can exist in one of two metastable structural forms (Fig. 5; form III and its symmetric counterpart). These would correspond to locking in of active site configuration 1 or active site configuration 2, and result directly from the nature Flp-Flp interactions across the spacer. One would expect that in these structures the branch point is likely to be constrained. The Holliday resolution experiments support this notion. They indicate that the points of restraint are located at the left or right borders of the spacer region. According to Lee and Jayaram(1995) partner compatibility between DNA substrates is not tested till after strand cleavage has occurred. If nonhomology exists at the three spacer positions adjacent to the cleaved end, formation of a covalent Holliday intermediate is inhibited. The active site configuration 1 will not be disengaged, and the preferred joining reaction will be the reversal of cleavage. Hence parental configuration of the DNA partners will be restored. If these spacer positions are homologous, formation of Holliday intermediate will occur. Under normal conditions (no heterology within the spacer), isomerization of the recombination complex drives the branch point to the position at which active site configuration 2 is engaged and resolution proceeds in the recombinant mode. According to the Lee-Jayaram model, this transition point could potentially be located 3 bp away from the resolution point or at the resolution point itself. Lee and Jayaram preferred the former case because of the limited branch migration involved and because of the symmetry conferred by this arrangement on the first and second pair of cleavage-joining reactions. If heterology beyond the three spacer positions adjoining the initial cleavage point precludes active site configuration 2 or inhibits strand joining in the recombinant mode following cleavage by active site 2, the recombination complex reverts to active site configuration 1 whose structural constraints force the cross-over point to be trapped at the spacer extremity (form III, Fig. 5). Hence resolution can occur only in the parental mode, and no recombinants can be produced. Thus, regardless of whether the reaction is initiated at the left or at the right, effect of spacer heterology would be to freeze Holliday junctions at the initiation end. In either situation, recombination would be aborted by resolution in the parental mode. Our current results may now be explained as follows. This explanation must be tempered by the caveat that preformed Holliday structures are likely to permit greater degrees of freedom in protein-protein interactions upon Flp binding than are feasible in similar structures produced during the act of recombination. In all likelihood, reactions with these artificial substrates cannot exactly reproduce, but only approximate the natural situation. When Flp monomers associate with synthetic Holliday junctions immobilized at positions within the spacer, either active site configuration 1 or 2 can be established with roughly equal probability. As a result, resolution in the parental or recombinant mode is equally likely. However, during a regular recombination reaction (where the first exchange is mediated by Flp rather than the experimenter), such Holliday structures may be too short lived to contribute significantly to the reaction (even when their presence might be expected based on heterology). A stalling branch point, resulting from spacer heterology, is forced to its limit position by the nature of the metastable states accessible to the recombination complex, and is thus resolved in the non-recombinant mode. Only two of the synthetic junctions used in our experiments, those in which the cross-over point lies between 0 and 1 or 1′ and 0′, would mimic the situation in which the active sites responsible for initiating the reaction (at the left or the right of the spacer) are frozen in that configuration. We find that these two junctions are resolved with a large bias, and in the expected direction. The smaller resolution bias observed with junctions trapped between 1 and 2 and 2′ and 1′ is most easily accommodated by a “spill-over” effect. We have no satisfactory explanation for the resolution preference (though small) obtained when the branch point is frozen between spacer positions 4′ and 3′. We feel that this is a peculiarity of the particular Holliday substrate used rather than a special feature of the recombination reaction. Another Holliday structure immobilized at the same position was found to be resolved equally well in either direction by Dixon and Sadowski(1994). Overall, the results summarized here on Holliday resolution together with the earlier findings of Lee and Jayaram(1995) indicate that partner discrimination during Flp recombination occurs at several levels. First, following cleavage the spacer segment is subjected to a limited homology test prior to strand joining and formation of a covalently closed Holliday junction. A second homology test is applied during the disengagement of the first pair of Flp active sites (responsible for Holliday formation) and assembly of the second pair of active sites (responsible for Holliday resolution). If heterology is detected at this step, disassembly is blocked, and the active site pair reverses the reaction to yield parental, and not recombinant, molecules. Assuming that the resolution pockets are assembled and that they proceed to execute strand cleavage, a third homology test comes into play at the joining step required to yield the mature recombinant products. If a fraction of molecules can escape each of these check points, total exclusion of recombination between two DNA substrates harboring spacer heterology will not be possible. However, if product dissociation from the recombination complex is a slow step, the system will have yet a final chance to eliminate the progeny of an illegitimate union by reversing the reaction.

INTRODUCTIONThe energy for muscle contraction is derived from the hydrolysis of MgATP by myosin and the activation of this process by actin. During this process, myosin forms a series of intermediates resulting in the formation of a steady-state intermediate MADP•Pi which upon reassociation with actin forms AMADP•Pi, a non-force-producing state, which subsequently isomerizes to force-bearing states with and without Pi (AMADP•Pi or AMADP), respectively (16Hibberd M.G. Trentham D.R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 119-161Google Scholar; 9Dantzig J.A. Goldman Y.E. Millar N.C. Lacktis J. Homsher E. J. Physiol. 1992; 451: 247-248Google Scholar). Thus, a key question related to the structural basis of force generation is how different is the S1 1The abbreviations used are: S1myosin subfragment 1VivanadateBeFAlF, and ScF are generalized representations of fluorometal complexes formed with beryllium, aluminum, and scandium. structure in the MADP•Pi and MADP•Pi or MADP states. Unfortunately, the former two intermediates have only limited lifetimes, and it appears that the latter state when bound to actin is different in structure from that formed by the binding of MgADP to actoS1 (29Sleep J.A. Hutton R.L. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 1276-1283Google Scholar). Therefore, stable analogs corresponding to these species would be useful in obtaining information of their structures.Since the demonstration by Goodno(1979) that orthovanadate ion in the presence of MgADP was able to form a stable ATPase-inhibitory complex with myosin S1, corresponding to a 1:1:1 ternary complex designated MADP•Vi, much interest has been devoted in its characterization as it appears to have some properties in common with the steady-state intermediate, MADP•Pi, of the MgATPase hydrolysis cycle by S1 (13Goodno C.C. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85B: 116-123Google Scholar; 30Smith S.J. Eisenberg E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 69-73Google Scholar; see also 14Goodno C.C. Taylor E.R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 21-25Google Scholar for a review)). Because of the simple stoichiometry of the complex and because of its inhibitory nature, it is generally assumed that the nucleoside diphosphate resides at the nucleotide binding site with the Vi taking the place of the terminal γ Pi group and, in this way, forms a stable analog of the transition state. Such an interpretation is also supported by the fact that structurally the vanadate ion is similar to orthophosphate (19Lindquist R.N. Lymn J.L. Lienhard G.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1973; 95: 8762-8768Google Scholar).More recently, the use of other complex anions with similarity to Pi has been investigated for their ability to stabilize the transition states of phosphotransferases and nucleotidases in the presence of nucleotide diphosphate (5Chabre M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 6-10Google Scholar). These include fluoride complexes of beryllium and aluminum, BeFx and AlFx, respectively, and their efficacy in forming stable transition state analog states has been studied with actin (6Combeau C. Carlier M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19017-19021Google Scholar, 1990), with smooth muscle heavy meromyosin (21Maruta S. Henry G.D. Sykes B.D. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7093-7100Google Scholar) and skeletal myosin S1 (26Phan B. Reisler E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4787-4793Google Scholar; 3Beck T.W. Chase P.B. Kushmerick M.J. Biophys.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10451-10456Google Scholar).In the present paper we present evidence that fluoroscandium anion (presumably ScFx) can also lead to effective trapping of ADP in S1 in both the presence and absence of Mg2+ with concomitant inactivation of the ATPase properties of the protein. Surprisingly, free nucleoside diphosphate is more stably trapped than the MgADP form with fluoroscandium. Actin binding to these complexes results in a faster release of trapped ADP in accord with the usual effect of actin in accelerating product release from S1.MATERIALS AND METHODSDistilled water further purified through a Millipore QTM system was used throughout. ATP, ADP, dithioerythritol, HEPES, Tris, NaF, KF, sodium orthovanadate, BeCl2, AlCl3, and chymotrypsin were from Sigma and Aldrich. ScCl3 was purchased from Johnson Mathey Electronics with a purity of 99.9%. A stock solution of ScCl3 (100 mM) was made in water and stored at −20°C. [14C]ADP (specific activity 2.4 × 1013 cpm/mol) was purchased from DuPont NEN. All other reagents were of analytical grade.Protein PreparationThe preparations of myosin and S1 were done as described by 10Godfrey J.E. Harrington W.F. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 886-893Google Scholar and 34Weeds A.G. Taylor R.S. Nature. 1975; 257: 54-56Google Scholar, respectively. Actin was prepared as described by 31Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4873Google Scholar. Protein concentrations were determined by the absorption at 280 nm employing E1% of 5.5, 7.5, and 11.0 for myosin, S1, and actin, respectively, or by the 4Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar using myosin or S1 as standards.Formation of Inhibitory Complexes in the Presence of NaF and ScCl3Trapping by the phosphate analogs was done by incubating S1 (10-20 μM) at 25°C in 0.03 M Tris, 10 mM NaF (or KF for trapping with beryllium or scandium) and 0.2 mM ADP at pH 7.9, adjusted at room temperature (Solvent A), with or without 1.0 mM MgCl2. After 5 min, the Pi analogs were added (up to 200 μM) and incubated for an additional 30 min. After incubation, an aliquot was diluted and stored on ice prior to determination of the NH4+/K+(EDTA) ATPase as described below. For experiments to determine the rates of inhibition by the Pi analogs, S1 was incubated as just described, and the reaction was started by addition of the Pi analogs to give a final concentration of 200 μM. Aliquots were removed and immediately assayed for ATPase activity. The rate of inhibition was also studied in the same buffer in the presence of 1.0 mM ATP by following the rates of Pi formation as described by 36White H.D. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85B: 698-708Google Scholar.Determination of Scandium Trapped in the Inhibitory ComplexesThese were done using the inductively coupled plasma analysis by Galbraith Laboratories Inc.ATPase MeasurementsATPase assays were performed on the samples at 25°C in 1-ml aliquots containing 0.054 μM S1, 2 mM ATP, 0.56 M NH4Cl, 0.23 M KCl, 0.036 M EDTA, and 0.06 M Tris, pH 8.0. The amount of phosphate released was measured as reported by White(1982).Recovery of EDTA/ATPase Activity on Incubation with ActinThe stable S1 complexes were freed from excess reagents by sedimentation gel filtration (25Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2891-2899Google Scholar) as described above in Sephadex G-50 equilibrated in 0.05 M Tris and 0.05 M KCl, pH 7.9 (adjusted at room temperature). F-actin was added to a final concentration of 10 μM, and the S1 complexes were 5 μM. The solutions were adjusted to 1.0 mM MgCl2. The samples were incubated at 25°C, and the release of ADP was estimated by the regain of the NH4+/K+(EDTA) ATPase at the time intervals indicated.Stability of the Inhibitory ComplexesThe stability of the complexes was followed by monitoring the release of trapped [14C]ADP upon addition of cold ADP as follows. [14C]ADP was trapped in S1 by incubation at 25°C in 0.05 M Tris, pH 7.9 (adjusted at 4°C), for 2 h with 10 mM NaF, 0.5 mM ScCl3, 5 mM MgCl2, 34.8 μM [14C]ADP, and S1 (17.4 μM). The untrapped reagents were removed by gel filtration sedimentation as described above and then for a second time in the gel equilibrated in 0.03 M Tris, 0.03 M NaCl, pH 7.9 (adjusted at 4°C). Both MgCl2 and ADP were added to 1.0 mM to the complex trapped with MgADP, and 1 mM ADP was added to the complex trapped in the absence of MgCl2. The release of [14C]ADP at 4°C with time was followed by determining the radioactivity and protein concentration after gel filtration sedimentation.Photocleavage of S1Photocleavage of the S1•ADP•ScFx and S1•MgADP•ScFx complexes was done in the presence of 0.5 or 1.0 mM Vi in 30 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, using the apparatus previously described (27Rajasekharan K.N. Sivaramakrishnan M. Burke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11207-11214Google Scholar). Irradiations were done at 4°C for 10 min using a Pyrex Petri dish filter to eliminate far-UV.Gel ElectrophoresisSDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was done by the procedure of 18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar. The proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. A Xerox copy of the stained gel was made on Write-On Transparency Film (AF 4300, 3M Co.) yielding high quality images. Molecular weights were estimated with reference to the mobilities of reference proteins such as S1 and the light chains and the reported molecular weights for the Vi cleavage fragments of S1 (23Mocz G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 373-378Google Scholar; Werber et al., 1992).Fluorescence MeasurementsThese were done on a Perkin-Elmer LS-5B spectrofluorometer at 20°C. To S1 (0.9-1 μM) in 1 mM MgCl2, 30 mM Tris-HCl, 0.2 mM ADP, and 10 mM NaF, pH 7.9 (adjusted at room temperature), was added ScCl3 to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. The excitation wavelength was 295 nm, and the emission spectra were monitored between 310 and 390 nm.RESULTSIncubation of S1 at 25°C for 30 min in the presence of 0.2 mM ADP, 0.5 mM ScCl3, and 10 mM NaF in buffer A resulted in virtually complete inhibition of the EDTA ATPase of the protein. ADP and NaF were found to be essential for this inhibitory action since omission of either one had no effect on the ATPase activity of the S1. However, the presence of Mg2+ ions was not required to produce inhibition with ADP and fluoroscandium, except in this case lower extents of inhibition were observed at low concentrations of scandium (Fig. 1). The inactivation was studied as a function of the Sc3+ concentration, and the data are shown in Fig. 1in the presence of ADP (no MgCl2) and MgADP. In the latter case, 90% inhibition was observed with 0.1 mM scandium. The concentration dependence of the inhibition in the absence of Mg2+ ions is more complex and 90% inhibition required about 0.2 mM scandium. The loss of ATPase function is consistent with the formation of a stable inhibitory complex, and, since ADP, scandium, and NaF are all essential for this to occur, it is likely that this complex involves formation of a ternary complex in which MgADP or ADP and ScFx are simultaneously bound to the S1.The presence of MgATP in the incubation solution retards the onset of inhibition as shown in Fig. 2. This is consistent with the S1 being primarily in the MADP•Pi conformation and the occupancy of the site with MgADP and Pi with the latter retarding the binding of ScFx. The rate constant (kobs) for the inactivation in the presence of 500 μM scandium was obtained from the semilogarithmic plot of the residual ATPase activity versus time and has the value of 2.8 × 10-5 s−1, corresponding to an apparent second order rate constant (kapp) of 0.056 M−1 s−1. The latter second order rate constant is about an order of magnitude lower than that observed with Vi and beryllium suggesting weaker binding of the ScFx to S1•MgADP (Goodno, 1979; Phan and Reisler, 1992).Figure 2:Effect of the presence of MgATP (1.0 mM) on the rate of formation of Pi by S1 in the absence and presence of ScFx. To S1 (0.5 μM) at 25°C in the presence of 5.0 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ADP, 0.03 M HEPES, and 10 mM NaF at pH 7.0 (adjusted at room temperature) was added MgATP (1.0 mM), and the rate of Pi formation was followed in the absence (○) and presence (∆) of ScCl3 (500 μM).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The inactivation of the ATPase activity induced by preincubation of S1 with MgADP in the presence of ScCl3 and KF was followed as a function of the preincubation time, and the data are shown in Fig. 3. The rate constant (kobs) for the inactivation in this case was obtained from the slope of the semilogarithmic plot of the residual activity versus time and was found to be 1.73 × 10-3 s−1 yielding an apparent second order rate constant of 8.7 M−1 s−1. While clearly faster than the apparent second order rate constant measured for the inactivation in the presence of MgATP, both rates are far too slow to correspond to a simple collisional process. It is more likely that the inactivation proceeds in a manner analogous to that suggested for Vi by Goodno(1979) and involves a rapid equilibrium binding step of ScFx to S1•MgADP followed by a slow isomerization step. Analyses of the amount of scandium trapped in the two complexes were done in triplicate on two different preparations of S1 and yielded 1.78 ± 0.3 and 1.61 ± 0.2 mol of scandium per mol of S1 for the inhibitory complexes containing MgADP and ADP, respectively. Since the amounts of nucleotide trapped in the S1 by the fluoroscandium anion were 0.72 ± 0.2 and 0.70 ± 0.1 for MgADP and ADP, respectively, per mol of S1, it appears that close to 2.0 mol of scandium per mol of S1 are present in these complexes. The amount of magnesium present in the complex formed with and without MgCl2 was 0.85 ± 0.02 and less than 0.14, respectively. S1 incubated with ScFx in the absence of MgCl2 and ADP showed less than 0.14 mol of scandium per mol of S1 after gel filtration centrifugation indicating that no high affinity binding site exists for ScFx when ADP is absent. Assuming that the total inactivation of the S1 ATPase is associated with the binding of 2.0 mol of Sc3+, a Scatchard analysis (data not shown) of the inactivation data versus free ScFx gave an association constant of approximately 6.0 × 104M−1. This is about an order of magnitude lower than that reported for the binding of BeFx to S1•MgADP (Phan and Reisler, 1992).Figure 3:Time dependence of inactivation of S1 by ScFx. S1 was incubated as described in Fig. 1(10 mM KF for beryllium and scandium), and the inactivation was followed as a function of time upon addition of ScCl3 (∇), BeCl2 (○), or Vi (∆) to a final concentration of 200 μM as described under “Materials and Methods.”◊, inactivation by ScCl3 in the absence of MgCl2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The stability of the inhibitory complexes formed in the presence or absence of MgCl2 was next examined by following the release of bound radiolabeled ADP by a chase experiment with 1.0 mM ADP. The results are shown in Fig. 4for the ternary complexes formed with either ADP or MgADP. The data for both processes indicate that the release is biphasic, with the fast phase having the same apparent rate constant (kobs) for both complexes of 8.0 × 10-5 s−1. However, the fractions of fast and slow components are quite different. In the case of the MgADP-containing complex, the fast component corresponds to about 0.46 of the total S1, while for the ADP-containing complex the fast fraction corresponds to only about 0.11 of the total S1. The slower phases yielded apparent rate constants of 8.0 × 10-6 s−1 and 3.9 × 10-6 s−1, corresponding to half-lives of 24 and 49 h for the MgADP- and ADP-containing inhibitory complexes, respectively, at 4°C.Figure 4:Rate of trapped [14C]ADP release. The inhibitory complexes formed with [14C]ADP and ScFx in the presence (○ and absence (∆) of MgCl2 were isolated at 4°C, and MgADP and ADP were added immediately to a final concentration of 1.0 mM respectively. The release of [14C]ADP was followed as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Actin is known to be able to decompose the ternary inhibitory complexes formed between S1 and MgADP with Vi (Goodno and Taylor, 1982) or BeFx or AlFx (Phan and Reisler, 1992; Werber et al., 1992). The decomposition of the inhibitory complex is conveniently followed by the regain of the EDTA ATPase activity which is measured at high ionic strength where the activating effect by actin is minimal. The results of such an experiment with the ternary complexes formed with MgADP and ADP with ScFx and with MgADP and Vi (as a control) are presented in Fig. 5. It is clear that actin binding dissociates the ternary complex and results in the regain of the EDTA ATPase activity. The actin-induced rates of decomposition of these complexes can be roughly estimated from the half-life of regain of full ATPase activity. This gives a lower limit for the observed rate of complex decomposition (kobs), and the values were found to be 1.28 × 10-3 s−1 for both the MgADP-containing complexes trapped by Vi or ScFx. This is in reasonable agreement with the data of Werber et al.(1992) for the MMgADP•Vi complex under similar conditions. In contrast, the ADP-containing complex formed with ScFx is decomposed more slowly by actin at a rate of about 0.29 × 10-3 s−1.Figure 5:Effect of actin on the inhibitory complex. F-actin was added to a final concentration of 10 μM, and the S1 complexes were 5 μM. The solutions were adjusted to 1.0 mM MgCl2. The samples were incubated at 25°C, and the release of ADP was estimated by the regain of the NH4+/(EDTA) ATPase at the time intervals indicated. ∆, Vi; ○, ScFx(MgCl2); ◊, ScFx.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)It is well established that the tryptophyl fluorescence of S1 is sensitive to the state of the bound nucleotide, and, therefore, the intrinsic tryptophyl fluorescence of S1 in the presence of MgADP and NaF showed an enhancement of about 7.0% over that of S1 alone. Addition of Sc3+ caused an additional enhancement of 10% corresponding to a 17% enhancement of that for S1 in the absence of nucleotide. This is close to the value of 20% observed for the addition of MgATP to S1 and suggests that similar if not identical conformations exist for the MMgADP•ScFx and the MMgADP•Pi complexes. In the absence of MgCl2, addition of ADP to S1 in the presence of NaF resulted in a 2% enhancement of the tryptophyl fluorescence, which upon addition of the Sc3+ resulted in an additional enhancement of 14.6%, corresponding to a total enhancement of 16.6% over that of free S1. Thus, both the magnesium-containing and magnesium-free complexes stabilized by ScFx show very similar if not identical levels of intrinsic tryptophyl fluorescence.8Cremo C.R. Grammer J.C. Yount R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6608-6611Google Scholar have shown that irradiation of the MMgADP•Vi complex results in photo-oxidation of Ser-180 which is located in the Walker A consensus sequence of some ATP-requiring proteins. This result indicates that the bound Vi is located within chemical bond length of this seryl residue. In the absence of MgADP, irradiation of S1 in the presence of Vi results in cleavage at sites located at 23, 31, and 74 kDa from the N terminus with those at 23 and 31 kDa attributed to Vi binding to the same consensus sequence in S1 and a proximal serine, probably Ser-243 (28Ringel I. Peyser Y.M. Muhlrad A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9091-9096Google Scholar). These cleavages give rise to bands of 74, 51, 46, and 23 kDa in SDS gel electrophoretograms. Addition of Vi to the ternary complexes formed with ScFx, and subsequent irradiation by near-UV light showed cleavage only at the 74-kDa site (Fig. 6). The failure to observe bands of 31 and 23 kDa in the two forms of ScFx complexes upon irradiation in the presence of Vi suggests that Vi is unable to bind to the consensus sequence site due to the occupancy by the ScFx anion.Figure 6:SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analyses of the effect of Vi-induced photolysis of S1 and of the inhibitory complexes formed with ScFx and MgADP or ADP. Lanes: a, S1 with Vi (1.0 mM); b, S1•MgADP•ScFx with Vi (0.5 mM); c, same as b except Vi was 1.0 mM; d, S1•DP•ScFxwith Vi (0.5 mM); e, same as d except Vi was 1.0 mM; f, control S1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe present study was undertaken to examine whether fluoride complexes of a transition metal cation such as scandium could also mimic BeFx and AlFx in trapping MgADP in S1 to form a stable complex at low temperature. The reasons for choosing scandium were as follows. (i) The stability of the fluoroscandium complexes is similar to fluoroaluminates (11Goldstein G. Anal. Chem. 1964; 36: 243-244Google Scholar) which have already been used to trap MgADP in S1. (ii) The exchange rates of ligands for scandium lie between those of beryllium and aluminum ions (32van Eldik R. Inorganic High Pressure Chemistry: Kinetics & Mechanisms. Elsevier Science Publishing Co. Inc., New York1986Google Scholar; 37Wilkins R.G. Kinetics and Mechanism of Reactions of Transition Metal Complexes. VCH Publishers, New York, 2nd Ed1991Google Scholar). (iii) We were interested to determine whether the hexacoordinated scandium anions, which may be in a deformed octahedral configuration (24Nowacki W. Z. Kristallogr. 1939; 101: 273-283Google Scholar), would be effective in the protein to trap MgADP or free ADP. The data presented in Fig. 1and Fig. 2indicate that fluoroscandium anion (presumably ScF4¯) can indeed produce an inhibitory complex of S1 in the presence of MgADP. Surprisingly, inhibition was also observed when Mg2+ ions were omitted from the incubation mixture, indicating that ADP can also be trapped in S1 by fluoroscandium. Direct chemical analyses of the total amount of magnesium in solutions of S1 (13 μM) in the absence of MgCl2 yielded a maximum of 3.2 μM magnesium content, while in solutions of the purified complex (at 13 μM) formed in the absence of magnesium, the concentration of total magnesium was less than 2.0 μM which would yield a total concentration of less than 0.5 μM in MgADP in these solutions which is far too low to account for stoichiometric trapping of MgADP in the protein.Analysis for the amount of scandium present in these complexes indicate that 2 mol of scandium are present per mol of S1. The reason for this is not as yet apparent. It is, however, possible to rule out a high affinity site for the binding of ScFx in the absence of ADP, since little binding was observed when ADP and MgCl2 were absent (see “Materials and Methods”). It is unlikely that any of the bound scandium is in the form of Sc3+ based on the association constants for the formation of the fluoroscandium species in the presence of the high concentrations of NaF employed (Goldstein, 1964). Therefore, it is highly improbable that the complex formed in the absence of MgCl2 involves any substitution of Sc3+ for Mg2+ in coordinating to the bound ADP. We have also found that inhibition occurs with BeFx and AlFx with ADP in the absence of free Mg2+, but much higher concentrations of the fluorometal anions are needed. 2D. Gopal and M. Burke, unpublished data. The apparent second order rate constants (kapp) for the onset of inhibition, 0.056 M−1 s−1 in the presence of MgATP and 8.7 M−1 s−1 for preincubation in its absence, are far too slow for a simple collisional process of ScFx with S1•MgADP and suggest that a very slow rate-limiting isomerization step occurs after formation of the collisional complex as originally suggested by Goodno (1979) for the Vi-induced inhibition of S1 in the presence of MgADP.The stability of the ternary complexes formed with fluoroscandium anion and MgADP or ADP at 4°C was followed by the release of the trapped 14C-nucleotide by chasing the isolated complexes with cold ADP as described in Fig. 4. The time dependence of the release indicated that it was biphasic for both forms of the complex. A similar biphasic release was also observed with the complex stabilized with BeFx (Phan and Reisler, 1992). For the two ScFxcomplexes, the fast phase appeared to be identical (kobs = 8.0 × 10-5 s−1) but the fractions of S1 associated with the fast phase were different being 0.46 and 0.11 for the MgADP-containing and ADP-containing complexes, respectively. The rates of the slow phases were also found to be different for these complexes. The biphasic nature of the release of nucleotide from these ternary complexes suggests the possibility that the ternary complex may be in equilibrium between two distinct conformations, one in which the nucleotide can be released more rapidly and a form where the nucleotide is more strongly trapped. A similar mechanism has been proposed by Mihashi et al.,(1990) for the MMgADP•Vi complex. In that study it was shown, using an exchange procedure, that nucleotide could undergo exchange with trapping, suggesting that release of nucleotide from the inhibitory equilibrium mixture preceded release of the Vi anion. Furthermore, the rate constant of the rapid phase for the exchange in the case of the Vi-stabilized complexes was 4.5 × 10-4 s−1 which is about a factor of 6 times greater than that observed for the release of ADP from the ScFx-trapped MgADP in S1 measured at 4°C. The rates of the slow phase of releases of ADP from the MgADP-containing ScFx and ADP-containing complexes, 8.0 × 10-6 s−1 and 3.9 × 10-6 s−1, respectively, are in reasonable accord with the slow rate of exchange measured for the MMgADP•Vi complex (6.7 × 10-6 s−1) (Mihashi et al., 1990).The enhancement of tryptophyl fluorescence associated with the formation of the two complexes (presence and absence of MgCl2) is quite similar, allowing for experimental error, and shows levels of enhancement over that of unliganded S1 of about 17 ± 2%. This is somewhat lower than that observed for the MMgADP•Pi complex (20%± 2%) but suggests that the conformations of the complexes may be closely related to this steady-state intermediate. The failure to detect any photocleavage at the two sites (21 and 31 kDa from the N terminus) in the presence of added Vi for the two complexes indicates that Vi probably does not bind to the region of S1 containing the ATP consensus sequence (33Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Google Scholar), since it is thought that occupancy of this region by Vi is essential for the photocleavage to occur (Werber et al., 1992). This observation is essentially identical with that noted for the complexes stabilized with BeFx and AlFx, respectively, and would be consistent with"

Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT, 1The abbreviations used are: ChATcholine acetyltransferasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. EC 2.3.1.6) catalyzes the reversible transfer of an acetyl group between acetyl coenzyme A and choline, resulting in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine(1Tucek S. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 1988; 86: 129-131Google Scholar). Since its discovery more than 50 years ago(2Nachmansohn D. Machado A.L. J. Neurophysiol. 1943; 6: 397-403Google Scholar), ChAT has been extensively studied, but little is known about structure/function relationships for this molecule as a catalyst. Initially, the kinetic mechanism catalyzed by this enzyme was postulated as an ordered bireactant or ping-pong mechanism(3Schuberth J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 122: 470-481Google Scholar). Now it is generally accepted that this is predominantly an ordered sequential Theorell-Chance mechanism with acetyl coenzyme A as the leading substrate, although a minor component of a random sequential pathway does occur(4Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12820-12825Google Scholar). The reaction is thought to proceed via general base catalysis by an imidazole residue enhancing the nucleophilicity of the hydroxy group of choline to attack the thioester bond in the forward reaction(5Currier S.F. Mautner H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3355-3358Google Scholar). The presence of an active site histidine was first postulated by White and Cavallito(6White H.L. Cavallito C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 206: 343-358Google Scholar). Recently, this active site histidine has been identified by site-directed mutagenesis as His-426 in Drosophila ChAT(7Carbini L.A. Hersh L.B. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 247-253Google Scholar). choline acetyltransferase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Over the years multiple forms of choline acetyltransferase, which vary in charge and size, were observed using either column chromatography or electrophoretic methods(8Mautner H.G. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 4: 341-370Google Scholar, 9McGeer P.L. McGeer E.G. Peng J.H. Life Sci. 1984; 34: 2319-2338Google Scholar, 10Mautner H.G. Neurotransmitter Enzymes. 1986; 5: 273-317Google Scholar). However, the nature and physiological function of these variants remain unclear. Multiple charge forms of ChAT have been observed in all sources from which ChAT has been purified(8Mautner H.G. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 4: 341-370Google Scholar, 9McGeer P.L. McGeer E.G. Peng J.H. Life Sci. 1984; 34: 2319-2338Google Scholar, 10Mautner H.G. Neurotransmitter Enzymes. 1986; 5: 273-317Google Scholar). They do not represent distinct gene isoforms since the ChAT gene is a single copy in the genome(11Hahn M. Hahn S.L. Stone D.M. Joh T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sc. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4387-4391Google Scholar), nor do they represent alternative splicing products since a single transcript has the capacity to generate them(12Wu D. Hersh L.B. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 1653-1663Google Scholar). Instead, multiple charge forms have been attributed to the possible association with other proteins(13Cozzari C. Hartman B.K. Brain Res. 1983; 276: 109-117Google Scholar), to deamidation(14Bruce G. Wainer B.H. Hersh L.B. J. Neurochem. 1985; 45: 611-620Google Scholar), or to phosphorylation(15Bruce G. Hersh L.B. Neurochem. Res. 1989; 14: 613-620Google Scholar). On the other hand, the size variants of ChAT may simply reflect artifacts generated during purification since they appeared to be somewhat variable depending on which purification scheme was used. For example, in the case of bovine brain ChAT, molecular sizes of 100-120 kDa(6White H.L. Cavallito C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 206: 343-358Google Scholar, 8Mautner H.G. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 4: 341-370Google Scholar), 72-76 kDa(13Cozzari C. Hartman B.K. Brain Res. 1983; 276: 109-117Google Scholar), 65-70 kDa (16Glover V.A.S. Potter L.T. J. Neurochem. 1971; 18: 571-579Google Scholar, 17Ryan R.L. McClure W.O. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5357-5365Google Scholar) and six subunits of 14.7 kDa (18Chao L.P. J. Neurochem. 1975; 25: 261-266Google Scholar) have all been reported. Hersh et al.(19Hersh L.B. Wainer B. Andrews L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1253-1258Google Scholar) attempted to address the nature of size and charge heterogeneity of ChAT from bovine brain and found that the 68-kDa form can be converted to a 63-kDa form by exogenously added Staphylococcus aureas protease, but not by autolysis in the extracts. However, only a 73-kDa form was observed when purification was carried out in the presence of a variety of proteolytic inhibitors(19Hersh L.B. Wainer B. Andrews L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1253-1258Google Scholar). Recently, Benecke et al.(20Benecke S. Ostermann-Latif C. Mäder M. Schmidt B. Unger J.W. Westarp M.E. Felgenhauer K. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 804-811Google Scholar) reported the presence of 45- and 30-kDa forms, but not the intact 68-kDa form in partial purified ChAT samples. A 68-kDa form was, however, obtained in immunoaffinity-purified ChAT preparations(20Benecke S. Ostermann-Latif C. Mäder M. Schmidt B. Unger J.W. Westarp M.E. Felgenhauer K. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 804-811Google Scholar), suggesting that multiple sizes of ChAT were caused by proteolysis. In the case of Drosophila, cleavage of ChAT from 68 to 57 kDa and 13 kDa occurred with the wild-type enzyme, but not with two temperature-sensitive mutants(21Salvaterra P.M. McCaman R.E. J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 903-910Google Scholar), indicating that proteolytic processing may be important for ChAT function. Thus, these studies clearly demonstrated the presence of proteolysis of ChAT, although the consequence and/or effects on catalysis were not investigated. In order to address the nature of different size variants of ChAT and to better understand the process and effects proteolysis has on ChAT activity, limited proteolysis was carried out with known proteinases. In this report, we describe the activation of recombinant rat ChAT by limited proteolysis and the characterization of proteolytically activated enzyme. A rat ChAT cDNA clone, previously isolated in two fragments(11Hahn M. Hahn S.L. Stone D.M. Joh T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sc. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4387-4391Google Scholar), corresponding to nucleotides 181-1604 and 1153-2153(22Brice A. Berrard S. Raynaud B. Ansieau S. Copolla T. Weber M.J. Mallet J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1989; 23: 266-273Google Scholar), was used to link a polyhistidine to the N terminus of recombinant rat ChAT. An overlapping NdeI site was used to first join the two cloned fragments. Two additional oligonucleotides were then used to introduce a unique BglII site and a Factor Xa site at the 5′ end, such that the rat ChAT cDNA could be fused inframe with the polyhistidine in the expression plasmid pQE9 (Qiagen), with the Factor Xa site behind it. The final expression plasmid was constructed by three-fragment ligation with BamHI- and SalI-digested pQE9, BglII- and KpnI-digested 5′ fragment, and KpnI- and XhoI-digested 3′ fragment. The construct was identified by colony hybridization, and the polymerase chain reaction-generated fragments were checked by dideoxy sequencing(23Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar). To express the recombinant rat ChAT, Escherichia coli SG12036 containing the above expression plasmid was grown at 22°C for 4 days in LB media. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and frozen at −80°C until further use. The recombinant enzyme was purified in a two-step procedure that involved binding of the introduced N-terminal polyhistidine to immobilized nickel, followed by dye binding chromatography. All purification steps were performed at 4°C. 1 g of frozen cells was resuspended in 10 ml of 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μM benzamidine, 10 mM MgSO4, and 2 μg/ml DNase I. Cells were broken by passage twice through a French pressure cell at 9,000-16,000 p.s.i. The homogenate was centrifuged at 39,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was applied directly to a 3-ml column of nickel-tritrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) equilibrated with 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6. The column was washed successively with 50 ml of the phosphate buffer containing (a) 0.1 M NaCl, (b) 1.0 M NaCl, (c) 2.0 M NaCl, (d) 1.0 M NaCl + 0.1% Triton X-100, (e) buffer alone, and finally (f) buffer + 5 mM imidazole, pH 7.4. The enzyme was eluded with a concave gradient of 5-250 mM imidazole, pH 7.6. The active fractions were pooled, diluted 1/10 with 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, and applied directly to a 5-ml column of blue agarose (Amicon), previously equilibrated with 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6. After washing the column with 10 column volumes of equilibration buffer, the enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient to 2 M sodium chloride. The enzyme, which eluted at approximately 0.5 M NaCl, was concentrated/dialyzed in an Centricon 30 concentrator (Amicon). A summary of the purification scheme is given in Table 1. Analysis of the purified enzyme by SDS-PAGE revealed a single band. The addition of the polyhistidine to the enzyme had no effect on its kinetic properties as demonstrated by its removal with Factor Xa. 2D. Wu and L. B.

Neurochem. 1975; 24: 407-409Google Scholar) or the fluorometric assay of Hersh et al.(25Hersh L.B. Coe B. Cassey L. J. Neurochem. 1978; 30: 1077-1085Google Scholar). The reaction mixture for the radioactive assay routinely contained 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 100 mM sodium chloride, 0.5 mM EDTA, 15 μM eserine, 0.2 mM [3H]CoASHAc (specific activity = 2 × 107 cpm/μmol) and 10 mM choline in a total volume of 50 μl. The reaction was started by the addition of enzyme and incubated at 37°C for 10 min, after which time an aliquot was removed and the formation of [3H]acetylcholine was determined as described previously (24Fonnum F. J. Neurochem. 1975; 24: 407-409Google Scholar). The fluorometric assay followed the reverse reaction in which acetyl-CoA formation was measured in a coupled assay using citrate synthase and malate dehydrogenase. Reaction mixtures of 0.4 ml contained 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 100 mM sodium chloride, 0.25 mM NAD, 0.5 mML-malate, 0.1 mMDL-dithiothreitol, 1.0 unit of pig heart citrate synthase, 5 units of pig heart malate dehydrogenase, and 10 mM acetylcholine chloride and 200 μM CoA. The reaction was initiated by the addition of acetylcholine chloride, and NADH formation was monitored over a 3-5 min time period using a Ratio-2 fluorometer equipped with a strip chart recorder. An excitation wavelength of 340 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm were used. Stock solutions of trypsin, chymotrypsin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor were prepared daily. Limited proteolysis of ChAT was routinely carried out at 22°C in 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.6, with one mg/ml of ChAT and a proteinase to ChAT ratio of 1:10. The reaction with trypsin was terminated by the addition of 2 mg of soybean trypsin inhibitor/mg of trypsin. In those experiments, where physical properties such as molecular size determination, N-terminal sequencing, pH activity studies, and kinetic measurements were investigated, the proteinase-treated ChAT was separated from proteinase by gel filtration and concentrated/dialyzed for further studies. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce), using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Gel filtration was performed according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol using a Superdex-75 column from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Discontinuous SDS-PAGE was performed by the method of Lamelli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) using a 10% acrylamide gel run at a constant current of 20-40 mA/gel. Gels were silver-stained by the method of Bloom et al.(27Bloom H. Beier H. Gross H.S. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Google Scholar). Measurement of the initial rates of enzymatic acetyl group transfer utilized the conditions described for the fluorometric enzyme assay with substrate concentration varied in the range of 0.3-5.0 × the Km. The Km for acetylcholine was measured at a saturating concentration of CoASH (200 μM), while the Km for CoA was measured at a saturating concentration of acetylcholine (20 mM). Data from kinetic experiments were fit to the weighted least squares kinetic programs of Cleland(28Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-137Google Scholar). The pH-activity profile for the enzyme was obtained by assaying the enzyme in 5 mM sodium phosphate buffer with or without added NaCl (250 mM) at the desired pH. Assays were conducted at 0.2 mM acetyl-CoA and 5 mM choline using the radioactive assay(24Fonnum F. J. Neurochem. 1975; 24: 407-409Google Scholar). 100 μg of ChAT proteolytically activated either by trypsin or chymotrypsin were denatured and separated by SDS-PAGE on a 15% polyacrylamide gel as described above and transferred on to a polyvinylidine difluoride membrane. The membrane was first stained with 0.5% Ponceau S, and after destaining in 5% acetic acid, each band was excised and subjected to amino acid sequence analysis with a model 477A Applied Biosystems protein sequenator equipped with an on-line phenylthiohydantoin analyzer by the University of Kentucky Molecular Structure Core. Similarly, 50 μg of ChAT, proteolytically activated either by trypsin or chymotrypsin, were directly applied onto polyvinylidine difluoride membranes and subjected to N-terminal sequence determination. Highly purified recombinant rat choline acetyltransferase was incubated in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml of trypsin in 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.6. Fig. 1shows that incubation of ChAT with trypsin produces a time-dependent 5.5-fold increase in enzyme activity. Incubation with increasing concentrations of trypsin results in a similar 5-6-fold increase in ChAT activity when assayed in the presence of 100 mM sodium chloride. Maximal activation was achieved at a trypsin concentration of 100 μg/ml for a 30-min incubation period. Decreasing the trypsin concentration below 100 μg/ml increased the time required to achieve maximum activation. However, increasing the trypsin concentration above 100 μg/ml was ineffective and actually decreased the maximal activation achieved, presumably due to secondary cleavages. In order to minimize this effect, 100 μg/ml trypsin was chosen with a 30-min incubation time at 22°C as the standard activation condition for subsequent experiments. The molecular size of ChAT after treatment with trypsin was compared with that of the native enzyme by molecular sieve chromatography. As shown in Fig. 2, trypsin-activated ChAT migrated at the same position as native ChAT, indicating first, that trypsin activation does not result from the formation of a stable complex with ChAT, and second that trypsin does not remove a large inhibitory domain of ChAT. In order to find out where cleavage had occurred, trypsin-activated ChAT was first separated from trypsin by gel filtration, denatured under reducing conditions, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fig. 3shows one band of 68 kDa for native ChAT prior to trypsin incubation and at least three distinct bands of 31 kDa (Ta), 21 kDa (Tb), and 14 kDa (Tc1, Tc2, and Tc3) after trypsin treatment, indicating nicking and/or gapping was caused by proteinase treatment.Figure 3:SDS-PAGE analysis of recombinant choline acetyltransferase before and after limited proteolysis with trypsin. Native recombinant rat ChAT (5 μg; lane2) and trypsin-activated ChAT (5 μg; lane3) were analyzed on a 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were visualized by silver staining.

The results of the kinetic analysis of the native and activated ChAT are summarized in Table II. It can be seen that activated ChAT exhibited kinetic properties significantly different from the native enzyme. Trypsin treatment increases the Km for both substrates, acetylcholine, and coenzyme A, as well as kcat. Fig. 4shows the activity of both the native and activated enzyme in buffers containing different concentrations of sodium chloride. The native recombinant enzyme displays an ~5-fold enhancement in activity with increasing salt concentration consistent with previous reports of salt effects on this enzyme(29Rossier J. Int. Rev. Neurol. 1977; 28: 283-334Google Scholar, 30Hersh L.B. Nair R.V. Smith D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 254: 11988-11992Google Scholar). However, trypsin-treated ChAT appeared to be maximally activated and did not show any significant salt effect. This suggests that the difference in activity between the trypsin-activated and native forms of the enzyme is dependent on the ionic strength of the assay buffer. The pH optima of both native and activated enzyme were examined at both low and high ionic strength (Fig. 5). It can be seen that the pH optimum of native ChAT is between pH 6.5 and 7 at the low salt condition, while that of the activated ChAT under the same conditions has been shifted to a value between pH 7.5 and 8. The pH optimum for both the native and trypsin-activated ChAT at high salt are both between pH 7.5 and 8. To investigate the specificity of activation, different proteinases were tested for their ability to activate ChAT (Table III). The specificity of activation by trypsin was studied by comparing clostripain endoproteinases Arg-C and Lys-C. It is an established fact that trypsin recognizes and cleaves at the carboxyl group of either an arginine or lysine amide bond; endoproteinase Arg-C recognizes and cleaves at the carboxyl group of only the arginine amide bond while endoproteinase Lys-C recognizes and cleaves at the carboxyl group of only the lysine amide bond. Incubation with 100 μg/ml endoproteinase Lys-C activated ChAT, while the same concentration of endoproteinase Arg-C caused inactivation of ChAT. Treatment with equal amounts of both proteinases activated ChAT. This result suggests that treatment with trypsin may cause activation of ChAT and inactivation at the same time, specifically, cleavage at some lysine residue(s) activates ChAT while cleavage at some arginine residue(s) inactivates ChAT. Treatment with chymotrypsin also activates ChAT, suggesting that instead of specific cleavage at certain residue(s) being essential for activation, the cleavages at certain specific regions such as an accessible loop is essential for the activation. Activation of ChAT by trypsin appeared more efficient than by chymotrypsin, although combined incubation with both trypsin and chymotrypsin did not cause further activation. Furthermore, treatment of the trypsin-activated ChAT with chymotrypsin did not affect ChAT activity (data not shown). When the chymotrypsin-treated ChAT was purified away from chymotrypsin and separated on a denaturing SDS-PAGE gel, three bands of 33 kDa Ca, 28 kDa Cb, 21 kDa Cc, were observed (Fig. 6). Compared with trypsin-activated ChAT, there is overall similarity of the nicking/gapping pattern of trypsin-treated ChAT and that of chymotrypsin. There are two peptides (Ta and Ca, Tb, and Cc) of similar sizes generated by either trypsin or chymotrypsin activation as determined by SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 3and 6). It is probable that the common region where both trypsin and chymotrypsin cleave could be the event that causes the structural change necessary for ChAT activation. Other proteinases such as papain and protease K did not activate ChAT, on the contrary, they caused irreversible inactivation. Sequence determination of both individual fragments and the mixture of the fragments of the activated ChAT was prepared in order to understand the structural basis for trypsin and chymotrypsin activation. Activated ChAT was separated from either trypsin or chymotrypsin by gel filtration as described under “Experimental Procedures” before being denatured and run on a preparative SDS-PAGE gel. The fragments of ChAT were subjected to protein N-terminal sequence analysis, where the sequence of the first 10 amino acids was determined. As shown in Table IV, the sequence of the 31-kDa fragment generated by trypsin treatment is ASSWEELDLP, which corresponds to cleavage at position 15 when compared with the complete amino acid sequence deduced from a cDNA of rat ChAT(22Brice A. Berrard S. Raynaud B. Ansieau S. Copolla T. Weber M.J. Mallet J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1989; 23: 266-273Google Scholar), while the sequence of the 21-kDa fragment by trypsin treatment is GQLSGQPLXM, which corresponds to cleavage at position 153. The sequence of the 14-kDa fragment by trypsin treatment turned out to yield a mixture of three different fragments. The fragments were consistent with AAMPASEKLQ (481), ADSVSELPAP (363), and ASSWEELDLP(15Bruce G. Hersh L.B. Neurochem. Res. 1989; 14: 613-620Google Scholar). The sequence of the 33-kDa fragment generated by chymotrypsin treatment is EELDLPKLPV, which corresponds to cleavage at position 18. The sequence of the 28-kDa fragment by chymotrypsin treatment, VRADSVSELP, corresponds to cleavage at position 361 and that of the 21-kDa fragment AKGQLSGQPL 151. The trypsin cleavage sites KA (14-15), KG (152-153), RA (362-363), and KA (480-481) are consistent with trypsin specificity. Similarly, the chymotrypsin cleavage sites WE (18-19), WA (150-151), and LV (360-361) are consistent with chymotrypsin specificity. The cleavage sites around amino acids 15-18, 151-153, and 361-363 are in the same regions cut by both trypsin and chymotrypsin, suggesting that those regions are exposed at the surface of ChAT and cleavage of these regions leads to the activation of ChAT. The trypsin cleavage site of AAMPASEKLQ (#481) appears to be unique and therefore probably is not responsible for the activation event. Both trypsin and chymotrypsin-activated ChAT were subjected to N-terminal sequencing as a mixture in order to determine the presence of any small peptide fragments that may not be readily visible and recovered from SDS-PAGE. The results are shown in Table 5, which also contains the different sequences determined from the separated fragments. No new sequences were found, indicating that no small peptides were associated with the activated ChAT. On the other hand, the presence of small gaps cannot be ruled out since only the N-terminal sequence of the fragments were determined. Based on these data, a diagram to illustrate the activated ChAT and its proteolysis sites is shown in Fig. 7.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Recombinant rat ChAT after trypsin treatment exhibits altered kinetic properties when compared with the native enzyme. The Km values for both substrates increase significantly, as does Vmax. The observed 5~6-fold increase in Vmax, at a physiological ionic strength, is a minimal estimate since it has been shown with endopeptidase Arg-C that cleavage leading to decreased activity can also occur. Previous studies from this laboratory indicated that the rate-limiting step in the acetylation reaction is primarily the dissociation of the CoA product(30Hersh L.B. Nair R.V. Smith D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 254: 11988-11992Google Scholar). Therefore, activation may represent a structural alteration from which the rate of CoA/acetyl-CoA dissociation from the enzyme is increased. Based on its Theorell-Chance mechanism, the Km for CoA is k5/k1, and the Km for ACh is k5/k3, while kcatis defined as k5 (see Scheme 1). The activated enzyme exhibits an approximate 5-10-fold increase in the Km value for both of its substrates and a 5-fold increase in the turnover number k5, consistent with the hypothesis that limited proteolysis causes an increase in the coenzyme A dissociation rate constant, k5. The mechanism by which salt increases choline acetyltransferase activity has also been proposed to be due to an increase in the coenzyme A dissociation rate(30Hersh L.B. Nair R.V. Smith D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 254: 11988-11992Google Scholar). There are some interesting similarities between salt effects and proteolytic activation of choline acetyltransferase. The pH activity profile of the activated ChAT is very similar to that of the native enzyme in high salt. High salt did not enhance the activity of proteolytically activated ChAT under the same condition in which salt increased the activity of native ChAT. Although high salt does not increase k5to the same extent proteolysis does, it seems feasible to suggest that the catalytic residues in proteinase-activated ChAT may experience a similar structural change to those of the native enzyme in high salt. Thus, it seems reasonable to postulate that native choline acetyltransferase is normally in a restrained conformation such that maximal catalytic turnover cannot be achieved and that in the presence of high ionic strength buffer or “fixed ion pairs” generated by proteolysis, the conformation of the enzyme undergoes alteration such that the “optimal” catalytic capacity is now able to be manifested. The failure to “super-activate” trypsin-activated ChAT by chymotrypsin or vise versa appears to agree with the proposed model. N-terminal sequence analysis of ChAT activated either by trypsin or chymotrypsin indicates that amino acids 14-18, 150-153, 360-363, and 480-481 are localized on the surface accessible to proteinases. Not all cleavages of these bonds are required for activation. For example, digestion of the 480-481 bond appeared unique to trypsin-activated ChAT, suggesting that it is not a trigger for activation. This was proven to be true by mutagenesis in which this trypsin recognition site was changed and trypsin treatment still activated the mutant enzyme. 3D. Wu and L. B. Hersh, unpublished observations. The cleavage around amino acids 150-153, although present in both trypsin and chymotrypsin-activated ChAT, cannot be responsible for activation. Cleavage of amide bonds around amino acids 150-153 leads to the disappearance of the 31- or 33-kDa bands, which does not result in any further enhancement of ChAT activity. Thus it appears that the cleavage of either amino acids 14-18 and/or 360-363 are required for activation. The activation of ChAT by proteolysis was also observed with mammalian ChAT purified from brain sources,3 and therefore is not a result of expression of the recombinant protein. In general, limited proteolysis leading to enzymatic activation can be an important regulatory event in many physiological processes. For example, zymogen activation is a controlled process in terms of temporal and spatial regulation where large amounts of enzyme protein can be initially synthesized and stored in its inactive state and enormous activity can be generated by proteolytic activation in a short period of time or upon release to the location of action. Limited proteolysis has been shown to cause rearrangement of the conformation of the zymogen. This phenomenon is generally seen where regulation at the transcription level is too slow, and reversible mechanisms such as group transfers are not well suited to create a permanent change in the molecular environment. Choline acetyltransferase is synthesized in an active state and it is not known at this time if an in vivo activation mechanism occurs at the site of physiological action by limited proteolysis. However, it is worth noting that in mature sperm, choline acetyltransferase is located in the middle ring of the acrosome followed immediately in cellular space by acrosin, a trypsin-like serine proteinase(31Ibanez C.F. Pelto-Huikko M. Soder O. Ritzen E.M. Hersh L.B. Hokfelt T. Persson H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3676-3680Google Scholar). At lease three cholinergic markers have been reported to exist in sperm, including the nicotinic receptor acetylcholinesterase and choline acetyltransferase, and these cholinergic components are believed to be involved in sperm maturation and motility(32Sastry B.V. Janson V.E. Chaturvedi A.K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1981; 216: 378-384Google Scholar). It seems possible that choline acetyltransferase could be activated to increase the rate of biosynthesis of ACh by acrosin. It is of interest to note that Cozzari and Hartman observed both activator(s) and inhibitor(s) of mammalian ChAT(13Cozzari C. Hartman B.K. Brain Res. 1983; 276: 109-117Google Scholar). These factors could represent proteinases. In summary, we have reported a novel proteolytic activation phenomenon for choline acetyltransferase and have addressed the activation mechanism by both kinetic and structural analysis.

We studied the ability of these fragments to restore the steady state isometric force in TnC-depleted skinned skeletal muscle fibers. Interestingly, we found that all investigated fragments of RSTnC possessed some of the properties of native RSTnC, but none of them could fully regulate contraction in the fibers like intact RSTnC. TH1 was the most effective in the force restoration (65%) whereas the smaller fragments developed about 50% (TH3 and TH4) or 20% (TH2) of the initial force of unextracted fibers. Additionally, much higher concentrations of TH2, TH3, and TH4 compared to RSTnC or TH1 were necessary for force development suggesting a decreased affinity of these fragments to their binding site(s) in the fibers. Like intact RSTnC, TH1 was able to interact with the fibers in a Ca2+-independent (Mg2+-dependent) manner, indicating that at a minimum, Ca2+-binding site III is required for this type of binding. The initial binding of the other fragments to the TnC-depleted fibers occurred only in the presence of Ca2+. TH2 and TH4 appeared to bind to two different binding sites in the fibers. The binding to one of the sites caused partial force restoration. This binding of TH2 and TH4 was abolished when Ca2+ was removed. TH2 and TH4 binding to the second site required Ca2+ initially but was maintained in the presence of Mg2+. This interaction of TH2 and TH4 partially blocked the rebinding of RSTnC to the fibers. The latter results suggest that site III or IV in these small fragments, when removed from the constraints of the parent protein, may assume conformations that allow them to function, to a certain extent, like both the regulatory sites (I and II) and the Ca2+-Mg2+ sites (III and IV) of TnC.

Germ cells in mammalian ovaries grow to maturity in individual follicles(1Hirshfield A.N. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1991; 124: 43-101Google Scholar). A single primordial follicle, which contains a germ cell enveloped by only one layer of flattened follicular cells, is transformed into a ripe, preovulatory follicle with thousands of highly differentiated cells. Each fully matured folicle contains large amounts of fluid in the follicular space. It is generally thought that the constituents of the fluid are derived from either plasma or follicular tissue itself. Among the proteins present in the fluid are proteolytic enzymes which have attracted special attention in connection with follicular maturation and/or ovulation(2Schochet S.S. Anat.

The enzyme consists of two different polypeptide chains having Mr = 45,000 and 32,000 and is shown to be structurally homologous with human plasma kallikrein and factor XIa. 4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis t-butyloxycarbonyl benzyloxycarbonyl active two-chain tissue-type plasminogen activator single-chain precursor tissue-type plasminogen activator polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis high performance liquid chromatography. The physiological role of follipsin is not known at present. In order to determine the physiological substrate(s), it is necessary to understand its substrate specificity in detail. The aim of the present study is to investigate the action of follipsin toward various synthetic and peptide substrates. Based on the results, the specificities of some of the side chain-binding pockets of the enzyme were deduced. We also describe the proteolytic conversion of human single-chain precursor tissue-type plasminogen activator (sctPA) to its mature form (tPA) by follipsin. Fresh porcine ovaries were obtained from a local slaughterhouse. Synthetic peptide substrates containing MCA, angiotensin II, [Asn1, Val5]angiotensin II, serum thymic factor, mastoparan, and α-neo-endorphin were purchased from the Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan). [Tyr38, Phe42,46]Osteocalcin, α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (αMSH), neurotensin, oxidized insulin B-chain, trypsin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, benzamidine HCl, and aprotinin were obtained from Sigma. A mixture of molecular weight marker proteins for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was from Bio-Rad. Vectastain ABC kit for detection of antigens was obtained from Vector Laboratories, Inc. Human sctPA, two-chain tPA, and goat anti-human melanoma tPA antibody were purchased from Biopool AB (Umea, Sweden). Polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane was purchased from Millipore Corp. Other reagents used were of the highest grade available. A 10-residue peptide (Gln-Pro-Gln-Phe-Arg-Ile-Lys-Gly-Gly-Leu) containing a connecting part of the A/B chain sequence of human tPA was synthesized on an Applied Biosystems model 430A solid-phase synthesizer. The peptide was HPLC purified to >95% purity. Enzyme activities toward peptide MCA substrates were assayed at pH 8.0 as described(13Hamabata T. Okimura H. Yokoyama N. Takahashi T. Takahashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17899-17904Google Scholar). Human tPA activity was assayed at pH 8.0 using 0.1 mM Boc-Gln-Gly-Arg-MCA. The enzyme activity of the samples containing follipsin or trypsin was selectively determined with the same substrate in the presence of soybean trypsin inhibitor or aprotinin, strong inhibitors of both follipsin and trypsin. Initial velocities, extrapolated from the plot of product versus time, were transformed into double-reciprocal plots of Lineweaver and Burk(14Lineweaver H. Burk D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1934; 56: 658-663Google Scholar). Maximum velocities (Vmax), Km, and kcat values were obtained from intercepts of these plots. Samples of human tPA treated with follipsin were separated by SDS-PAGE (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane(16Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Google Scholar). The blotted membrane was incubated with mouse anti-human tPA monoclonal antibody at 1:2000 dilution and subsequently with biotinylated anti-mouse IgG antibody. The membrane was then incubated with avidin conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and stained with hydrogen peroxide and diaminobenzidine. HPLC separation of peptides was performed with a reversed-phase SG-120 C-18 column (0.46 × 25 cm, Shiseido) on a Gilson HPLC using a solvent system of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and acetonitrile. The column was eluted at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min and monitored at 220 or 230 nm. The peak fractions collected from HPLC of peptides were subjected to amino acid analysis using an Applied Biosystems automated Derivatizer-Analyzer (420A/130A). Human tPA incubated with follipsin was electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE. The product polypeptides were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and analyzed directly for NH2-terminal sequences (17Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Google Scholar) in an Applied Biosystems model 477A sequenator with an on-line model 120A phenylthiohydantoin-derivative analyzer. Previously, we have shown that follipsin preferentially hydrolyzes Arg-X bonds using synthetic peptide substrates containing MCA(13Hamabata T. Okimura H. Yokoyama N. Takahashi T. Takahashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17899-17904Google Scholar). A detailed specificity study was carried out for the enzyme toward substrates with Arg at the P1 position. Among the substrates tested, Boc-Gln-Arg-Arg-MCA is the best substrate for follipsin based on its kcat/Km value (Table 1). Z-Arg-Arg-MCA is a poor substrate for the enzyme, having the lowest kcat among the tested substrates. The kcat/Km value for Z-Phe-Arg-MCA is about 6-fold greater than that for Z-Arg-Arg-MCA. Peptide substrates containing Arg and/or Lys residues were tested for hydrolysis by follipsin. Relative hydrolysis rates were calculated for the peptides, and the results are summarized in Table 2. Cleavage occurred only on the COOH-terminal side of Arg residues. The specificity is thus consistent with that found with MCA substrates. Interestingly, the enzyme rapidly hydrolyzed peptides having hydrophobic amino acids (Phe, Leu, and Pro) at P2 position. The Arg-Phe peptide bond of [Tyr38, Phe42,46]osteocalcin was not hydrolyzed by the enzyme at all. A decapeptide (Gln-Pro-Gln-Phe-Arg-Ile-Lys-Gly-Gly-Leu) containing a proteolytic activation site of human sctPA was synthesized. It contains 1 internal residue each of Arg and Lys. Incubation of the peptide with follipsin resulted in two new HPLC peaks (Fig. 1). Amino acid analysis of the peptides revealed that hydrolysis takes place at the Arg-Ile bond. Human sctPA, which has little or no activity as assayed with the substrate Boc-Gln-Gly-Arg-MCA, was activated by follipsin (Fig. 2). The tPA activity increased rapidly within 60 min and then slowly leveled off. In contrast, tPA activity caused by trypsin activation first increased up to a level comparable to that observed with follipsin and declined thereafter. This is probably due to extensive hydrolysis of the activated tPA by trypsin. Consistent with the previous observations from several laboratories(18Andreasen P.A. Nielsen L.S. Grondahl-Hansen J. Skriver L. Zeuthen J. Stephens R.W. Dano K. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 51-56Google Scholar, 19Ichinose A. Kisiel W. Fujikawa K. FEBS Lett. 1984; 175: 412-418Google Scholar), sctPA was not activated autocatalytically. As shown in Fig. 3, incubation of sctPA with follipsin brought about the production of two polypeptide chains having Mr = 34,000 and 32,000 with a concomitant decrease in the staining of the 61-kDa precursor protein. These results indicate that proteolytic cleavage at a single internal peptide bond underlies the activation of tPA by follipsin. In order to determine the cleavage site, the NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of the products were analyzed. A single amino acid sequence (Ile-Lys-Gly-Gly-Leu-) was obtained for the 32-kDa polypeptide. This sequence corresponds to part of sctPA (Ile276-Leu280) (20Pennica D. Holmes W.E. Kohr W.J. Harkins R.N. Vehar G.A. Ward C.A. Bennett W.F. Yelverton E. Seeburg P.H. Heyneker H.L. Goeddel D.V. Collen D. Nature. 1983; 301: 214-221Google Scholar) indicating that the product is derived from the COOH-terminal portion of the precursor protein. The sequence analysis of 34-kDa polypeptide, which is derived from the NH2-terminal portion of sctPA, did not give clear results because of lower yields of phenylthiohydantoin amino acids. This is presumably due to heterogeneity in the NH2-terminal region of the polypeptide. In fact, Wallen et al. (21Wallen P. Pohl G. Bergsdorf N. Ranby M. Ny T. Jornvall H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 132: 681-686Google Scholar) documented that the NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of sctPA purified from the culture medium of human melanoma cells always contain several sets of amino acid sequneces. Nevertheless, the results clearly indicate that the Arg275-Ile276 peptide bond in sctPA was selectively cleaved by follipsin. In order to compare the nature of follipsin action on sctPA and the tPA peptide, the kinetic parameters for these substrates were determined. As shown in Table 3, similar kcat values were obtained for the two substrates. However, the kcat/Km value of the enzyme for the protein substrate was approximately 7 times greater than for the peptide substrate. This is mainly due to the difference in the affinities for the two substrates. The present study clearly establishes that porcine follipsin is an endopeptidase capable of hydrolyzing Arg-X bonds of both MCA-containing substrates and peptides. No hydrolyzing activity at Lys-X bonds could be found for the enzyme with either synthetic or peptide substrates. These results support the suggestion that substrate recognition subsite S1 of the enzyme can be occupied only by Arg. The Km values of follipsin for the MCA substrates tested in this study were found to be fairly close to each other. Similarly the enzyme showed similar kcat values for the substrates with the exception of Z-Arg-Arg-MCA. The difference in the kcat/Km values of Z-Phe-Arg-MCA and Z-Arg-Arg-MCA suggests some preference for amino acid residues with a hydrophobic side chain in S2. Such a subsite specificity was more clearly shown in the experiments using peptide substrates. Hydrophobic amino acids (Phe, Leu, and Pro) are commonly present at the P2 position in the peptide that are hydrolyzed by follipsin. In this regard, the cleavage profile of [Tyr38, Phe42,46]osteocalcin is noteworthy. This peptide was presumed to be cleaved at two sites because it contains paired Arg residues. However, the enzyme cleaved only at the Arg-Arg bond, indicating that Phe42, but not Arg43, of the peptide binds the S2 site for hydrolysis. The specificity of subsite S2 for hydrophobic amino acid residues is not absolute. This subsite could be occupied by basic amino acids (Arg and Lys) since the synthetic substrates Boc-Gln-Arg-Arg-MCA and Boc-Leu-Lys-Arg-MCA (13Hamabata T. Okimura H. Yokoyama N. Takahashi T. Takahashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17899-17904Google Scholar) are well hydrolyzed by follipsin. However, acidic side chains are apparently not favored. This notion is supported by the following observations. [Asn1, Val5]Angiotensin II was hydrolyzed by the enzyme to some extent, whereas angiotensin II was completely resistant to hydrolysis. In addition, no cleavage occurred on the COOH-terminal side of the Arg residue of oxidized insulin B-chain. Aspartyl (angiotensin II) and glutamyl (oxidized insulin B-chain) residues are at a position 1 residue to the left of the Arg in these peptides. Although the specificity of other side chain-binding pockets cannot be deduced clearly, our results appear to indicate that they have broad specificities. We presume that as far as the results obtained with synthetic and peptide substrates are concerned, the specificity of follipsin is dependent primarily on S1 and S2 side chain recognition, and the number and nature of other residues in the substrates are only of secondary importance. Since follipsin is present in the fluids of mature follicles in mammalian ovaries, it is reasonable to postulate that the enzyme is involved in a proteolytic event associated with follicular maturation and/or ovulation. Recent studies indicate that follicular rupture in ovulation is mediated by plasmin generated from plasminogen by tPA (6Beers W.H. Cell. 1975; 6: 379-386Google Scholar, 7Beers W.H. Strickland S. Reich E. Cell. 1975; 6: 387-394Google Scholar, 8Canipari R. Strickland S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5121-5125Google Scholar, 9Liu Y.X. Peng X.R. Ny T. Eur. J.

Endocrinology. 1989; 121: 415-421Google Scholar) and that tPA is secreted as the inactive single-chain precursor into the fluid from granulosa cells of matured follicles(22Milwidsky A. Laufer N. Kaneti H. Tsafriri A. Finci Z. Mayer M. Fertil. Steril. 1989; 52: 274-280Google Scholar). Therefore, the activation of tPA must be a prerequisite for degradation of the follicle wall although a proteinase(s) responsible for the activation has not yet been identified. The amino acid sequence (-Pro272-Gln-Phe-Arg-Ile-Lys-Gly-Gly-Leu280-, in human tPA residue number) around the activation site is conserved completely in tPAs from human(20Pennica D. Holmes W.E. Kohr W.J. Harkins R.N. Vehar G.A. Ward C.A. Bennett W.F. Yelverton E. Seeburg P.H. Heyneker H.L. Goeddel D.V. Collen D. Nature. 1983; 301: 214-221Google Scholar), rat(23Ny T. Leonardsson G. Hseuh A.W. DNA. 1988; 7: 671-677Google Scholar), and mouse(24Rickless R.J. Darrow A.L. Strickland S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1563-1569Google Scholar). Considering that when Phe is located at the P2 position follipsin efficiently cleaves peptide bonds on the COOH-terminal side of Arg residues, the Arg275-Ile276 bond in sctPA could be cleaved by the enzyme. In the present study, we demonstrated that follipsin is indeed capable of specifically cleaving this bond and converting sctPA to active tPA in vitro. Comparison of the rates of sctPA activation and of the tPA peptide hydrolysis by follipsin revealed that the former is a more efficient substrate than the latter based on the kcat/Km values. It is interesting that the Km value for sctPA was one-fifth that for the peptide substrate, and is 1-2 orders of magnitude smaller than those for the synthetic MCA substrates. Such a high affinity for sctPA may reflect the presence of additional substrate interaction sites other than the catalytic domain on the enzyme molecule. In a manner analogous to the important role of the noncatalytic heavy chain of plasma kallikrein in the expression of coagulant activity, neutrophil aggregation, and elastase release (25van der Graaf F. Tans G. Bouma B.N. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14300-14305Google Scholar, 26Schapira M. Despland E. Scott C.F. Boxer L.A. Colman R.W. J. Clin.

Takahashi T. Takahashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17899-17904Google Scholar) perhaps facilitates its specific interaction with sctPA. The present finding that porcine follipsin specifically activates human sctPA in vitro prompts us to speculate its role in the process of follicle wall degradation upon ovulation. To establish the validity of this assumption, tPA activation experiments using proteins from the same species are required. Since neither porcine sctPA nor human follipsin is available, such experiments were not conducted in the present study. However, we have recently detected a follipsin-like enzyme activity in follicular fluid from human ovaries obtained during in vitro fertilization procedures. 2J. Ohnishi and T. Takahashi, unpublished results. The purification of the enzyme from the fluid is thus under way in our laboratory. From a physiological point of view, it would be particularly interesting to compare its efficiency in tPA activation with those of plasmin, grandular kallikrein, and factor XIa, the enzymes known to activate tPA in vitro(19Ichinose A. Kisiel W. Fujikawa K. FEBS Lett. 1984; 175: 412-418Google Scholar). We thank Dr. Ronald T. MacFarland for critical reading of this manuscript and Yasuko Sakurai for her technical assistance."
