Resorting to this energy-conserving process was infrequent and could be correlated with reduced opportunity for energy intake."
https://openalex.org/W2074441611,"Pristiguana brasiliensis, new genus and species, from the Upper Cretaceous BaurÃº Formation of Brazil, is the oldest fossil referable to the living lizard family Iguanidae. It resembles living primitive South American iguanids in some features, but also shows similarity to members of the related family Teiidae. Iguanid fossils do not appear in North America until the early Eocene, probably by waif dispersal from South America during the late Paleocene or early Eocene. A southern continental (Gondwanan) origin of iguanids is more plausible than the northern one often suggested."

https://openalex.org/W1996924687,"The difference between the energy spectra of iron and other cosmic rays is interpreted in terms of two source mechanisms. One mechanism, possibly acceleration at neutron star surfaces, produces the iron, and another is responsible for the rest of the primary nuclei. Within this model, observations of high-energy cosmic rays could determine whether secondary nuclei are produced in the sources or in the interstellar medium."

The rate constant at 3000 degrees K for OH + O(3)-->HO(2) + O(2) is 8 x 10(-14) cubic centimeters per second. The rate constant for HO(2) + O(3)--> OH + 2O(2), is 3 x 10(-15) cubic centimeters per second. These results have implications concerning stratospheric ozone."

The most prominent feature observed is a band of permanent red aurora on the dayside of the earth, centered on magnetic noon at about 78 degrees magnetic (invariant) latitude, brighter than the quiet-time nightside aurora."

https://openalex.org/W1980144199,"An ovary placed in the spleen of an animal that has one normal ovary undergoes atrophy that starts as early as 24 days after transplantation. Severe atrophy is reached before 55 days, and subsequent changes are minor. The degree of atrophy is almost as intense as that noted in the hypophysectomized castrate animal with an ovarian transplant in the spleen (2). The transplanted ovary shows no evidence of any type of response to the hormonal influence that has stimulated the ovary that remained in situ. Removal of the normal ovary introduces the hormonal imbalance that was present in the original tumor animals. The atrophic ovarian parenchyma in the spleen in these, as well as in the hypophysectomized animals previously reported, retained its growth potentials and responded to the hormonal forces by assuming the changes that characterized the development of the luteoma. The action of the atrophic ovarian parenchyma is reminiscent of malignant cell deposits that may remain dormant or quiescent for long periods and then, for some unknown reason, suddenly undergo growth."

https://openalex.org/W2033266291,"Three different groups of hydration rinds have been measured on thin sections of obsidian from Obsidian Cliff, Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming. The average thickness of the thickest (oldest) group of hydration rinds is 16.3 micrometers and can be related to the original emplacement of the flow 176,000 years ago (potassium-argon age). In addition to these original surfaces, most thin sections show cracks and surfaces which have average hydration rind thicknesses of 14.5 and 7.9 micrometers. These later two hydration rinds compare closely in thickness with those on obsidian pebbles in the Bull Lake and Pinedale terminal moraines in the West Yellowstone Basin, which are 14 to 15 and 7 to 8 micrometers thick, respectively. The later cracks are thought to have been formed by glacial loading during the Bull Lake and Pinedale glaciations, when an estimated 800 meters of ice covered the Obsidian Cliff flow."

It has also proved applicable for the study of the relationship of some of the thoracic muscles of an adult homopteran insect (Ceresa biibalus) and was particularly useful for delineating the muscles of the small labium. It is possible that the staining and optical properties of this technique, with various modifications, may be useful for the study of the musculature of other insects and soft-bodied invertebrates."
