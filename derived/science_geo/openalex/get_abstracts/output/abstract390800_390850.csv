https://openalex.org/W1967677046,"Wired for Life Syntrophic bacteria live on the metabolic by-products of a partner species. The exchange of the by-products accompanies a flow of electrons in the opposite direction that helps some species grow in conditions that would otherwise be unfavorable. In mixed anaerobic cultures of two related Geobacter species, Summers et al. (p. 1413 ) observed that one species evolved to promote the transfer of electrons directly to the other, in large aggregated cell clusters, without coupling to common anaerobic by-products such as hydrogen or formate. Selection pressures in nine parallel populations all resulted in a point mutation that truncated a protein involved in the production of small hairlike projections involved in intercellular communication—pili—and indirectly increased the expression of a c -type multiheme cytochrome responsible for extracellular electron transfer. The evolved aggregates were conductive, suggesting that the direct exchange of electrons between partner species is a possible alternative route to anaerobic syntrophy rather than interspecies hydrogen transfer; indeed, deleting a gene that encodes a hydrogenase involved in hydrogen transfer conferred a growth advantage in the cocultures."
https://openalex.org/W2096138335,"Optical imaging in vivo with molecular specificity is important in biomedicine because of its high spatial resolution and sensitivity compared with magnetic resonance imaging. Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy allows highly sensitive optical imaging based on vibrational spectroscopy without adding toxic or perturbative labels. However, SRS imaging in living animals and humans has not been feasible because light cannot be collected through thick tissues, and motion-blur arises from slow imaging based on backscattered light. In this work, we enable in vivo SRS imaging by substantially enhancing the collection of the backscattered signal and increasing the imaging speed by three orders of magnitude to video rate. This approach allows label-free in vivo imaging of water, lipid, and protein in skin and mapping of penetration pathways of topically applied drugs in mice and humans."
https://openalex.org/W1968667083,"Systematic characterization of cancer genomes has revealed a staggering number of diverse aberrations that differ among individuals, such that the functional importance and physiological impact of most tumor genetic alterations remain poorly defined. We developed a computational framework that integrates chromosomal copy number and gene expression data for detecting aberrations that promote cancer progression. We demonstrate the utility of this framework using a melanoma data set. Our analysis correctly identified known drivers of melanoma and predicted multiple tumor dependencies. Two dependencies, TBC1D16 and RAB27A, confirmed empirically, suggest that abnormal regulation of protein trafficking contributes to proliferation in melanoma. Together, these results demonstrate the ability of integrative Bayesian approaches to identify candidate drivers with biological, and possibly therapeutic, importance in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1988263223,"DNA Damage Pathways Revealed Despite the dynamic nature of cellular responses, the genetic networks that govern these responses have been mapped primarily as static snapshots. Bandyopadhyay et al. (p. 1385 ; see the Perspective by Friedman and Schuldiner ) report a comparison of large genetic interactomes measured among all yeast kinases, phosphatases, and transcription factors, as the cell responded to DNA damage. The interactomes revealed were highly dynamic structures that changed dramatically with changing conditions. These dynamic interactions reveal genetic relationships that can be more effective than classical “static” interactions (for example, synthetic lethals and epistasis maps) in identifying pathways of interest."
https://openalex.org/W2028083589,"Although the proteins BAX and BAK are required for initiation of apoptosis at the mitochondria, how BAX and BAK are activated remains unsettled. We provide in vivo evidence demonstrating an essential role of the proteins BID, BIM, and PUMA in activating BAX and BAK. Bid, Bim, and Puma triple-knockout mice showed the same developmental defects that are associated with deficiency of Bax and Bak, including persistent interdigital webs and imperforate vaginas. Genetic deletion of Bid, Bim, and Puma prevented the homo-oligomerization of BAX and BAK, and thereby cytochrome c-mediated activation of caspases in response to diverse death signals in neurons and T lymphocytes, despite the presence of other BH3-only molecules. Thus, many forms of apoptosis require direct activation of BAX and BAK at the mitochondria by a member of the BID, BIM, or PUMA family of proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2009082877,"Cultivated beets (Beta vulgaris ssp. vulgaris) are unable to form reproductive shoots during the first year of their life cycle. Flowering only occurs if plants get vernalized, that is, pass through the winter, and are subsequently exposed to an increasing day length (photoperiod) in spring. Here, we show that the regulation of flowering time in beets is controlled by the interplay of two paralogs of the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) gene in Arabidopsis that have evolved antagonistic functions. BvFT2 is functionally conserved with FT and essential for flowering. In contrast, BvFT1 represses flowering and its down-regulation is crucial for the vernalization response in beets. These data suggest that the beet has evolved a different strategy relative to Arabidopsis and cereals to regulate vernalization."
https://openalex.org/W1966351672,"Synaptic plasticity is a key mechanism for chronic pain. It occurs at different levels of the central nervous system, including spinal cord and cortex. Studies have mainly focused on signaling proteins that trigger these plastic changes, whereas few have addressed the maintenance of plastic changes related to chronic pain. We found that protein kinase M zeta (PKMζ) maintains pain-induced persistent changes in the mouse anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Peripheral nerve injury caused activation of PKMζ in the ACC, and inhibiting PKMζ by a selective inhibitor, ζ-pseudosubstrate inhibitory peptide (ZIP), erased synaptic potentiation. Microinjection of ZIP into the ACC blocked behavioral sensitization. These results suggest that PKMζ in the ACC acts to maintain neuropathic pain. PKMζ could thus be a new therapeutic target for treating chronic pain."
https://openalex.org/W2089740526,"Shake It to Wake It Viscoelastic materials combine the recoverable stretchiness found in elastic materials with the slow-flowing behavior of a thick fluid, like honey. When subjected to an oscillatory motion, the response will depend on the frequency. At low frequencies, the viscous behavior will dominate and lead to a dissipation of the applied energy as heat, while at fast frequencies the elastic behavior dominates. Xu et al. (p. 1364 ; see the Perspective by Gogotsi ) developed a viscoelastic material with an exceptionally broad operating temperature range, based on a network of carbon nanotubes. The responsiveness of the material was probably caused by the “zipping” and “unzipping” of the nanotubes at points of contact."
https://openalex.org/W2155048015,"Tau, a neuronal protein involved in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer disease, which is primarily described as a microtubule-associated protein, has also been observed in the nuclei of neuronal and non-neuronal cells. However, the function of the nuclear form of Tau in neurons has not yet been elucidated. In this work, we demonstrate that acute oxidative stress and mild heat stress (HS) induce the accumulation of dephosphorylated Tau in neuronal nuclei. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we demonstrate that the capacity of endogenous Tau to interact with neuronal DNA increased following HS. Comet assays performed on both wild-type and Tau-deficient neuronal cultures showed that Tau fully protected neuronal genomic DNA against HS-induced damage. Interestingly, HS-induced DNA damage observed in Tau-deficient cells was completely rescued after the overexpression of human Tau targeted to the nucleus. These results highlight a novel role for nuclear Tau as a key player in early stress response.

Interestingly, HS-induced DNA damage observed in Tau-deficient cells was completely rescued after the overexpression of human Tau targeted to the nucleus. These results highlight a novel role for nuclear Tau as a key player in early stress response. Tau was first described as an essential factor for cytoskeletal microtubule assembly (1Weingarten M.D. Lockwood A.H. Hwo S.Y. Kirschner M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1975; 72: 1858-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (2252) Google Scholar). Since then, Tau has been primarily described as a regulator of microtubule dynamics. However, due to its diverse cellular distribution, Tau likely has multiple functions. Furthermore, although Tau is primarily seen as a cytosolic protein, the nuclear localization of Tau has been described in neuronal (2Loomis P.A. Howard T.H. Castleberry R.P. Binder L.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1990; 87: 8422-8426Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 3Wang Y. Loomis P.A. Zinkowski R.P. Binder L.I. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and non-neuronal cells (4Thurston V.C. Zinkowski R.P. Binder L.I.

Biochem. 2000; 78: 305-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In mitotic HeLa cells and fibroblasts, Tau is localized to the nucleolus and is associated with the nucleolar organizer regions, and it has been suggested that Tau plays a role in the nucleolar organization and/or heterochromatization of rRNA genes (6Sjöberg M.K. Shestakova E. Mansuroglu Z. Maccioni R.B. Bonnefoy E. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 2025-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in vitro studies have shown that purified Tau directly binds to polynucleotides with a preference toward AT-rich DNA compared with GC-rich DNA sequences. However, contradictory in vitro results have shown a protective or deleterious role of Tau in DNA integrity (7Hua Q. He R.Q. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1645: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 8Wei Y. Qu M.H. Wang X.S. Chen L. Wang D.L. Liu Y. Hua Q. He R.Q.

In addition, a recent study reported chromosomal aberrations in fibroblasts and lymphocytes from patients carrying a Tau mutation (10Rossi G. Dalprà L. Crosti F. Lissoni S. Sciacca F.L. Catania M. Di Fede G. Mangieri M. Giaccone G. Croci D. Tagliavini F. Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 1788-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, although Tau has been detected in brain nuclei (11Brady R.M. Zinkowski R.P. Binder L.I. Neurobiol. Aging. 1995; 16: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the function of neuronal nuclear Tau has not yet been elucidated. Furthermore, unlike other proteins present in both cellular compartments, nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Tau has not yet been reported. The protection of genomic integrity is a major challenge for living cells that are continuously exposed to DNA-damaging injuries, especially in the brain. However, whether endogenous Tau has the capacity to protect neuronal DNA in situ has remained an unanswered question. In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential protective effects of Tau against DNA damage in central neurons. Wild-type and knock-out Tau mouse primary cortical cultures were prepared as described previously (12Galas M.C. Dourlen P. Bégard S. Ando K. Blum D. Hamdane M. Buée L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19296-19304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). HAdV-5-hTau44Wt (wild-type Tau isoform 2-3-10-) and HAdV-5-hTau44-NLS were constructed using the gateway system (Invitrogen), and they were amplified and purified in our laboratory as described previously (13Rogée S.

HAdV-5-hTau44-NLS was obtained by insertion of a nuclear localization signal (NLS) 2The abbreviations used are: NLS, nuclear localization signal; HS, heat stress; hTau, human Tau; AD, Alzheimer disease; OTM, Olive tail moment; HAdV, human adenovirus; NS, nonstructural protein. from the Epstein-Barr virus mRNA export factor EB2 (14Hiriart E.

After standard virus purification by ultracentrifugation in CsCl gradient, viral genomes were quantified by measuring UV absorption at 260 nm, and the virus titer was expressed as viral physical particles per ml. Primary cultured cells were seeded in six-well culture plates at a density of 1.28 × 106 cells per well. Cells were then infected with 2000 physical particles/cell of HAdV-5-hTau44 or HAdV-5-hTau44NLS vectors for 2 h at 37 °C in minimum volume. Culture medium was added following infection for 24 h at 37 °C. At 10 days in vitro, cells were maintained at 37 °C (control condition(C)) or exposed to 44 °C (HS) in a 5% CO2 incubator for 1 h, or to 1 mm H2O2 for 1 h at 37 °C. Netropsin dihydrochloride (Sigma Aldrich) or methyl green (Sigma Aldrich) was added 1 h before treatment and was not removed during treatment. Anti-Tau antibodies have been described previously (12Galas M.C. Dourlen P. Bégard S. Ando K. Blum D. Hamdane M. Buée L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19296-19304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 15Buée L. Bussière T. Buée-Scherrer V. Delacourte A. Hof P.R. Brain Res. Rev. 2000; 33: 95-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar). The anti-lamin B and anti-Hsc70 antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, the anti-Tau3R from Sigma and the anti-human Tau antibody HT7 from Thermo Scientific. Cell fractionation was prepared as described previously (16Hamdane M. Bretteville A. Sambo A.V. Schindowski K. Bégard S. Delacourte A. Bertrand P. Buée L. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1291-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Aliquots of cytoplasmic or nuclear extracts were processed as described previously (12Galas M.C. Dourlen P. Bégard S. Ando K. Blum D. Hamdane M. Buée L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19296-19304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Immunolabeling was observed with an Image Reader LAS3000 (Fujifilm) and quantified by densitometry. Phosphorylated and total Tau levels were normalized against synaptophysin for the cytoplasmic fraction and lamin B for the nuclear fraction. Phosphorylated Tau levels were further normalized against the level of total Tau to measure the exact phosphorylation state. Lactate dehydrogenase assay was assayed as described by the manufacturer (Promega). Cell cultures were fixed in cold 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Permeabilization was carried out in 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min. After a 30-min saturation in 2% bovine serum albumin, immunostainings were carried out using Tau antibodies. Tau staining was revealed with goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG (Heavy and Light chains) antibodies coupled to Alexa Fluor® 488 (Molecular Probes). DAPI was present in the Vectashield mounting medium for fluorescence (Vector). Slides were analyzed with a Zeiss LSM710 confocal laser scanning microscope (60× magnification). Images were collected in the z direction at 0.50-μm intervals. For Tau1 labeling, cells were incubated with 1 μm ToPro3 (Molecular Probe) for 30 min and analyzed with a Leica-DMRBE microscope with a TCS 4D confocal head. Alternatively, permeabilization (0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min) was carried out before 10 min of ice-cold methanol fixation to remove soluble proteins. Cell cultures were fixed with 0.05% glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.2 m Pipes buffer for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were then incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% fetal calf serum, scraped, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g. Pellets were soaked overnight in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2.3 m sucrose and 20% polyvinylpyrrolidone. Cells were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen ultrathin sections were made with a cryo-ultramicrotome (Leica) at a thickness of 85 nm. The sections were picked up on formvar-carbon-coated nickel grids. After a 30-min saturation in 2% bovine serum albumin, immunostaining was carried out using Tau5, an anti-total Tau antibody. Tau5 staining was revealed with a goat anti-mouse IgG gold conjugate (12 nm in diameter) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Negative staining of the ultrathin sections was carried out using 0.4% uranyl acetate and 1.8% methyl cellulose. Labeling was observed under a Zeiss 902 electron microscope. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was carried out as described previously (18Lemay J. Maidou-Peindara P. Bader T. Ennifar E. Rain J.C. Benarous R. Liu L.X. Retrovirology. 2008; 5: 47Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA from control and HS-treated cells were immunoprecipitated either with Tau1 antibody or with a polyclonal antibody directed against the nonstructural NSs protein encoded by Rift Valley Fever Virus (a generous gift from Dr. Michèle Bouloy). Immunoprecipitated and input (corresponding to 20 μg of total nonimmunoprecipitated genomic DNA) DNAs were 5′-end radioactively labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (exchange reaction) and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol). 32P-labeled DNA was quantified after migration on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel using a PhosphorImager. Comet and fast halo assays (four cells/slide) were embedded in a layer of 0.5% of low melting point agarose (Bio-Rad) and kept at 37 °C previously coated upon slides. Slides were replaced on a slide tray on ice packs for 3 to 5 min. Four slides (two for the nondenaturing fast halo assay and two for the Comet assay) were prepared for each cell suspension. The fast halo assay was used to identify DNA fragmentation due to apoptosis and/or necrosis and/or true genotoxicity. It was performed under alkaline conditions following the procedure of Sestili et al. (19Sestili P. Martinelli C. Stocchi V. Mutat. Res. 2006; 607: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The essential steps of the fast halo assay consisted of the following. Slides were immersed in the pH 10.1 lysis solution for 10 min at +4 °C in the dark. The slides were then rinsed in PBS for <30 s and neutralized for 15 min in PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.1 mg/ml RNase. The DNA was then exposed for 5 min to absolute ethanol to preserve all the halo assay slides. After the top layer of agarose had solidified, the slides were immersed for at least 1 h at +4 °C in the dark in a lysis solution consisting of 2.5 m NaCl, 100 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 10, to which 1% Triton X-100 and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide were freshly added. The slides were then removed and placed on a horizontal gel electrophoresis unit, and the unit filled was with freshly prepared alkaline buffer (1 mm EDTA and 300 mm NaOH, pH > 13) to ∼0.25 cm above the slides. To reduce the variability associated with gel box slide position or multiple electrophoresis runs, slides were randomly distributed. The cells were exposed to the alkaline solution for 20 min to allow DNA unwinding and expression of single-strand breaks and alkali-labile sites. Next, electrophoresis was conducted for 20 min at 0–4 °C by applying an electric current of 0.7 V/cm (25 V/300 mA). All of these steps were conducted in the absence of daylight to prevent additional DNA damage. After electrophoresis, the slides were neutralized with 0.4 m Tris (pH 7.5), and the DNA was exposed for 5 min to absolute ethanol to preserve all the comet assay samples. Subsequently, the slides were air-dried and then stored at room temperature until scored for DNA migration (20Tice R.R. Agurell E. Anderson D. Burlinson B. Hartmann A. Kobayashi H. Miyamae Y. Rojas E. Ryu J.C. Sasaki Y.F. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 2000; 35: 206-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (4097) Google Scholar). Just prior to scoring, the DNA was stained using propidium iodide (20 μg/ml distilled water; 25 μl/slide). Slides were coded and examined at 200× magnification using a fluorescent microscope (Leica Microsystems SAS-DM 2000, Heerbrugg, Switzerland), equipped with an excitation filter of 515–560 nm and a barrier filter of 590 nm, connected through a gated monochrome CCD IEEE1394 FireWire video camera (Allied Vision Technologies) to a Comet Assay IV Image Analysis System (version 4.11) with Windows XP Pro Software (Perceptive Instruments Ltd, Suffolk, UK). Images of at least 50 randomly selected cells were analyzed from the two slides prepared, i.e. 100 cells per culture. For the fast Halo assay, 100 hundred cells per slide were also randomly scored. The Olive tail moment (OTM), developed by Olive (21Olive P.L. Banáth J.P. Durand R.E. Radiat. Res. 1990; 122: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar), was used to evaluate DNA damage. The OTM, expressed in arbitrary units, is calculated by multiplying the percent of DNA (fluorescence) in the tail by the length of the tail in micrometers (22Hellman B. Vaghef H. Boström B. Mutat. Res. 1995; 336: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The tail length is measured between the edge of comet head and the end of the comet tail. A major advantage of using the OTM as an index of DNA damage is that both the amount of damaged DNA and the distance of migration of the genetic material in the tail are represented by a single number (23Ashby J. Tinwell H. Lefevre P.A. Browne M.A. Mutagenesis. 1995; 10: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Brain slices were prepared as described previously (17Kimura R. Devi L. Ohno M. J. Neurochem. 2010; 113: 248-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Mouse brains were quickly removed and placed in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing: 117 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 23 mm NaHCO3, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, and 25 mm glucose, continuously oxygenated with 95% O2, 5% CO2 (pH 7.4). Transverse brain slices (400 μm) were cut using a Vibratome (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Slices were obtained from 1.70 mm anterior to the bregma. For allowing recovery from damage, the slices were maintained for 30 min at room temperature in homemade incubation chambers containing artificial cerebrospinal fluid and continuously bubbled with 95% O2, 5% CO2. The slices were then transferred to oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid at 37 °C for 1 h. For each brain, one of the two batches was then transferred to oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid at 44 °C for 1 h, and the other one was kept at 37 °C. Slices were then dissected, and the appropriate quantity of cortex was removed. Results are expressed as means ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments. ImageJ software was used for quantification. The Mann-Whitney test and the two-way analysis of variance test were used to statistically analyze the expression of proteins visualized by Western blots. The Student's t test was used to statistically analyze the OTM values in the Comet assay. Mild hyperthermia shares common mechanisms with oxidative stress such as that induced by exposure to H2O2 and reactive oxygen species production (24Bruskov V.I. Malakhova L.V. Masalimov Z.K. Chernikov A.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1354-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 25Zhao Q.L. Fujiwara Y. Kondo T. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2006; 40: 1131-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). H2O2 and HS were previously reported to reduce the phosphorylation of Tau in neuronal cultures through protein phosphatase 2A activation (12Galas M.C. Dourlen P. Bégard S. Ando K. Blum D. Hamdane M. Buée L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19296-19304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 26Goldbaum O. Richter-Landsberg C. Glia. 2002; 40: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Given that neuronal nuclear Tau has primarily been described under a dephosphorylated state, based on Tau1 labeling using an antibody (27Binder L.I. Frankfurter A. Rebhun L.I. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1371-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar), we examined whether oxidative stress or HS could modulate the cellular localization of Tau. The influence of H2O2 and HS on the cellular localization of Tau was evaluated in neurons by exposing cortical primary cultures of neurons to 1 mm H2O2 or hyperthermia (44 °C) for 1 h. H2O2 (Fig. 1A) and HS (Fig. 1B) induced a strong increase in Tau level in the nuclear fraction. A slight but significant decrease in Tau level was also detected in the cytosol after both stresses. Low molecular weight bands, indicative of Tau degradation, were not detected in the nucleus. HS-induced dephosphorylation of Tau was analyzed by immunoblotting with Tau1 antibody, which recognizes Tau only when serine residues (195–202) are dephosphorylated. Dephosphorylated Tau, detected by Tau1, increased after oxidative and heat treatment in both cytosolic and nuclear fractions. Taken together, our results suggest that both stresses induced Tau dephosphorylation and increased the nuclear localization of dephosphorylated Tau in cultured neurons. A lactate dehydrogenase assay was used to test the effect of 1 h H2O2 and HS treatments on cell viability in cultured cortical neurons and after a recovery of 24 or 48 h at 37 °C (Fig. 2). Only H2O2 significantly increased lactate dehydrogenase release 24 h after treatment. These results show that an acute stress induced by H2O2 induces cell death in neuronal cultures. Contrary to H2O2, stress induced by mild hyperthermia was not cytotoxic, demonstrating that HS-induced accumulation of Tau in the nuclei of neurons did not induce cell death. Mild hyperthermia was chosen in the following study to characterize and study the function of stress-induced nuclear Tau accumulation, free from interfering cell death mechanisms. To study the consequences of HS-induced accumulation of nuclear Tau, cells were allowed to recover for 24 h at 37 °C after HS. The results shown in Fig. 3 (A and B) demonstrate that the level of nuclear Tau, as detected by anti-total Tau and Tau1 antibody, was strongly reduced after heat-stressed cells recovered at 37 °C, with the amount of nuclear Tau returning to a level similar to that observed before HS. The absence of lower molecular weight bands indicates that Tau was not degraded. These results suggest that stress-induced Tau dephosphorylation and nuclear accumulation is reversible. The results obtained with Tau1 antibody in Fig. 1B suggested that HS induced the dephosphorylation of Tau. HS-induced dephosphorylation of Tau was further confirmed by immunoblotting with the phosphodependent Tau antibodies anti-pT212-Tau, AT180, 12E8, and AD2. Fig. 4A illustrates that HS led to a strong decrease of phosphorylated Tau. None of these phosphorylated forms of Tau were detected in the nuclear fraction under control or HS conditions, confirming that the dephosphorylated state of the nuclear form of Tau accumulated after HS. In primary neuronal cultures, neurons were studied after 10 days in vitro and thus were mainly differentiated. Nevertheless, to overcome any potential artifactual effects related to the embryonic origin of the neurons, we also tested the effect of HS in the adult mouse brain. Ex vivo slices from the cerebral cortex of adult mice were incubated for 1 h at 37 or 44 °C, and the cytosolic and nuclear fractions were analyzed under the same conditions as in Figs. 1B and 4A. Hyperthermia induced an increase in the level of nuclear Tau in the adult mouse brain, as previously observed in embryonic neuronal cultures. The phosphorylation state of stress-induced nuclear Tau was analyzed in brain slices from adult mice (Fig. 4B) using the same phospho-specific antibodies as in Fig. 4A. Similar results were obtained with Tau1 (as in Fig. 1B), p-T212, AT180, and AD2 antibodies, but not with the 12E8 antibody. At 37 °C as well as after HS, nuclear Tau was detected not only with Tau1 but also, surprisingly, with 12E8. Under HS, a specific increase of Tau1 and 12E8 labeling was observed. Overall, these data indicate that in the ex vivo model of cortical slices, nuclear Tau was mainly dephosphorylated both in the control condition and under HS, except for at Ser262 and Ser356 ((Lys-X-Gly-Ser) motifs). This is consistent with previous findings that Tau is mainly dephosphorylated, except at Ser262, in cerebral extracts from heat-shocked rats (28Shanavas A. Papasozomenos S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 14139-14144Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although the majority of Ser/Thr-Pro sites that flank the microtubule-binding repeats are phosphorylated by so-called Ser/Thr-Pro kinases such as Cdk5 and GSK3 (15Buée L. Bussière T. Buée-Scherrer V. Delacourte A. Hof P.R. Brain Res. Rev. 2000; 33: 95-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar), Ser262 and Ser356 are located within microtubule-binding domains and form KXGS motifs that are preferentially phosphorylated by MARK (Microtubule Affinity-Regulating kinase)/Par-1 kinase, CamKII (Calmodulin-Dependent Protein kinase II) or ChK2 (29Trinczek B.

A differential expression and/or regulation of these kinases between embryonic and adult neurons could explain the differences observed here with the Tau 12E8 antibody. The accumulation of Tau in the nuclei of neuronal cultures after HS was further analyzed by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy analysis (Fig. 5, A–C). Under the control condition, total Tau antibody clearly stained the cellular body and neurites but only weakly labeled the nucleus (Fig. 5A, upper panel). Under the HS condition, however, accumulation of Tau was clearly observed in the nuclei of cortical primary cultured neurons (Fig. 5A, lower panel). The location of Tau was also studied after removing soluble proteins by permeabilization of the cells before ice-cold methanol fixation (Fig. 5B). In this condition, Tau tightly bound to insoluble cell structures (“bound” Tau) was immunolabeled using an anti-total Tau antibody. Nuclear fluorescence was quantified using a Zeiss confocal microscope program. The average ratio of bound Tau under the HS versus the control condition was 2.06 ± 0.17 (p < 0.001). The accumulation of dephosphorylated Tau in the nuclei of neuronal cultures after HS was illustrated using Tau1 antibody (Fig. 5C). Under control conditions, no labeling was detected in neuronal nuclei, and only weak labeling was observed in the cellular body (Fig. 5C, upper panel). Conversely, clear staining of dephosphorylated Tau was detected on the entire cell body and the nucleus after HS treatment (Fig. 5C, lower panel). The accumulation of nuclear Tau under HS was also visualized by electron microscopy (Fig. 6). Tau was detected in the nuclei of frozen sections derived from cortical neuronal cultures only under stress conditions (Fig. 6, C (I, II, and III) associated with DNA (light gray regions in Fig. 6, C (II) as well as with nucleoli (Fig. 6, C (III)). This nucleolar localization is consistent with previous studies describing nucleolar localization of Tau in various cell lines (4Thurston V.C. Zinkowski R.P. Binder L.I.

Protein Pept. Lett. 2002; 9: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To analyze the ability of Tau to interact in situ with neuronal DNA before and after HS treatment, we carried out ChIP experiments (Fig. 7). During these experiments, genomic DNA from control and HS-treated cells was immunoprecipitated with either Tau1 antibody or an antibody directed against the nonstructural NSs protein encoded by the Rift Valley fever virus, which was used here as an arbitrary negative control. The total amount of immunoprecipitated DNA was labeled at the 5′-end with [γ-32P]ATP and submitted to nondenaturing polyacrylamide electrophoresis (Fig. 7). These results indicate that the capacity of Tau protein to interact with DNA, previously described in vitro, could also be observed in situ in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, we found that the total amount of DNA interacting with nuclear Tau was ∼2-fold higher in heat-stressed cells compared with control cells (Fig. 7). The difference was even more significant considering that overall labeling of input DNA, corresponding to total genomic DNA before immunoprecipitation, was slightly weaker after HS compared with the control condition. As expected, no DNA immunoprecipitated with the anti-NSs antibody in control or in HS cells. In parallel, the concentration of DNA that immunoprecipitated with the anti-Tau1 antibody under control or HS conditions was measured using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer. The average ratio of immunoprecipitated DNA (% of input) under HS versus control conditions was 1.8 ± 0.07 (p < 0.001). This result was correlated with the increase in nuclear bound Tau observed under HS (Fig. 5B). Taken together, these data show that in addition to enhancing the nuclear fraction of Tau, HS also enhanced the amount of Tau interacting with DNA, suggesting that under the HS condition, the majority of nuclear Tau forms protein-DNA complexes with endogenous cellular DNA. Previous studies demonstrated that, in vitro, purified Tau binds to synthesized DNA specifically through the minor groove (8Wei Y. Qu M.H. Wang X.S. Chen L. Wang D.L. Liu Y. Hua Q. He R.Q. PLoS One. 2008; 3: 2600Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To assess this specificity in situ, competitor experiments were performed using netropsin, a naturally occurring antibiotic that binds to the minor groove of DNA in spots rich in AT, and methyl green, a DNA major groove binding drug. Competitive effects were tested on Tau nuclear accumulation (Fig. 8, A and B). Netropsin significantly decreased the level of nuclear Tau under heat stress conditions. Concentrations from 10 to 25 μm induced a similar effect on nuclear Tau accumulation (data not shown). Identical concentrations of methyl green did not alter heat shock-induced Tau accumulation in the nucleus. As heat shock is known to induce rapid Hsc70 accumulation into cellular nuclei independent of minor groove binding, the detection of Hsc70 was used first to check the lack of effect of netropsin on the integrity of nuclear shuttling mechanisms and second as a negative control to check the specificity of netropsin binding to DNA at the minor groove. As expected, netropsin did not modify the heat shock-induced nuclear increase of Hsc70. Netropsin partially prevented stress-induced nuclear Tau accumulation. These data suggest"

We used single-particle light-harvesting action spectroscopy to probe the impact of particle morphology on energy transfer and carrier relaxation across a heterojunction. The generic form of an action spectrum [in our experiments, photoluminescence excitation (PLE) under absorption in CdS and emission from CdSe in nanocrystal tetrapods, rods, and spheres] was controlled by the physical shape and resulting morphological variation in the quantum confinement parameters of the nanoparticle. A correlation between single-particle PLE and physical shape as determined by scanning electron microscopy was demonstrated. Such an analysis links local structural non-uniformities such as CdS bulbs forming around the CdSe core in CdSe/CdS nanorods to a lower probability of manifesting excitation energy-dependent emission spectra, which in turn is probably related to band alignment and electron delocalization at the heterojunction interface."
https://openalex.org/W1971703620,"The activity of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complexes regulates essential cellular processes, such as growth, proliferation, or survival. Nutrients such as amino acids are important regulators of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activation, thus affecting cell growth, protein synthesis, and autophagy. Here, we show that amino acids may also activate mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). This activation is mediated by the activity of class I PI3K and of Akt. Amino acids induced a rapid phosphorylation of Akt at Thr-308 and Ser-473. Whereas both phosphorylations were dependent on the presence of mTOR, only Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 was dependent on the presence of rictor, a specific component of mTORC2. Kinase assays confirmed mTORC2 activation by amino acids. This signaling was functional, as demonstrated by the phosphorylation of Akt substrate FOXO3a. Interestingly, using different starvation conditions, amino acids can selectively activate mTORC1 or mTORC2. These findings identify a new signaling pathway used by amino acids underscoring the crucial importance of these nutrients in cell metabolism and offering new mechanistic insights."

TLRs are type I transmembrane proteins that contain an amino-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain and a carboxyl-terminal Toll-interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain (4Takeda K. Kaisho T. Akira S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 335-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (4731) Google Scholar). The leucine-rich repeat domain is responsible for the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns, whereas the TIR domain is required for initiating intracellular signaling (3Shi Z. Cai Z. Wen S. Chen C. Gendron C. Sanchez A. Patterson K. Fu S. Yang J. Wildman D. Finnell R.H. Zhang D. J. Biol.

Signal transduction by TLRs after ligand engagement is initiated with the recruitment of the cytosolic TIR-containing adaptor proteins such as MyD88 and TRIF (also known as TICAM1) (5O'Neill L.A.

MyD88 is utilized by all TLRs except for TLR3 (5O'Neill L.A. Immunity. 2008; 29: 12-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). For the MyD88-dependent pathway, MyD88 subsequently recruits the serine/threonine interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) to the receptor complex through a homophilic interaction of the death domains (8Ozinsky A. Underhill D.M. Fontenot J.D. Hajjar A.M. Smith K.D. Wilson C.B. Schroeder L. Aderem A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 13766-13771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1675) Google Scholar). The recruited IRAK is then auto-phosphorylated and, after associating with the cytosolic adaptor protein TRAF6, dissociates from the receptor and is degraded (5O'Neill L.A. Immunity. 2008; 29: 12-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Finally, TRAF6 activates the IκB kinase complex through the adaptor protein TAK1 (5O'Neill L.A.

The MyD88-independent pathway is the TRIF pathway. TLR3 and TLR4 recognize double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and LPS, respectively, to activate this pathway. This results in the activation of IRF3 and the subsequent induction of type I interferons and IFN-inducible genes (9Brinkmann M.M. Spooner E. Hoebe K. Beutler B. Ploegh H.L. Kim Y.M. J.

IRF7 is a key transcription factor for the induction of type I interferons, and its activation occurs via both the MyD88-dependent pathway and the TRIF-dependent pathway (12Tabeta K. Hoebe K.

The subcellular localization of different TLRs correlates with the nature of their ligands. In the TLR family, TLR1, -2, -4, -5, -6, and -11 are present on the cell surface membrane, whereas TLR3, -7, -8, and -9 are expressed in the intracellular endosomal compartments. Intracellular TLRs are sensors of nucleic acids that have been well studied in the recognition of viral infection. After viruses are internalized and delivered to the endosome, the released nucleic acids might be recognized by these TLRs. Although Toll-like receptors share common sequence features including an amino-terminal leucine-rich repeat domain and a carboxyl-terminal TIR domain, there is as little as ∼30% homology in the full-length amino acid sequence among different TLR family members. However, the TIR domain among TLRs is highly conserved. We used the TIR domain of our recently identified tlr11 (1Zhang D. Zhang G. Hayden M.S. Greenblatt M.B. Bussey C. Flavell R.A. Ghosh S. Science. 2004; 303: 1522-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar) to search NCBI databases for related sequences. We identified a novel TIR domain-containing sequence (GenBankTM accession number AY510706), which represents a potential novel TLR, dubbed tlr13, based on the sequence of its discovery. Although a partial sequence was reported (2Tabeta K. Georgel P. Janssen E. Du X. Hoebe K. Crozat K. Mudd S. Shamel L. Sovath S. Goode J. Alexopoulou L. Flavell R.A. Beutler B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 3516-3521Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar), the function of this novel TLR is completely unknown. Here we report the cloning and characterization of tlr13. This TLR displays a pattern of expression in dendritic cells and macrophages. Tlr13 is an intracellular TLR and activates the MyD88-dependent pathway. Moreover, consistent with its subcellular localization, tlr13 is able to recognize the vesicular stomatitis virus to activate innate immune antiviral responses. RAW 264.7, NIH3T3, and HEK293 cells were purchased from ATCC. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) of MyD88−/− were kindly provided by R. Medzhitov (Yale University). TAK1-deficient MEFs were obtained from M. Schneider (Baylor College of Medicine). Cells were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 incubator in DMEM (Invitrogen) and supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HyClone), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 g/ml streptomycin. TLR ligands were purchased from Invivogen, including polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), a synthetic analog of viral dsRNA that is recognized by TLR3; single-stranded RNA40 is a U-rich single-strand RNA derived from the HIV-1 long terminal repeat that is recognized by TLR8; R848, a low molecular weight synthetic imidazoquinoline compound, activates immune cells via TLR7/8 MyD88-dependent signaling pathway. Mouse tlr13 open reading frame was amplified from cDNA made from mRNA isolated from RAW 264.7 cells using the following primers 5′-CACCATGAGTGGGCTCTACAGGATC-3′ and 5′-AGCCGCCTCAACAACAATTAGATGTG-3′ and was cloned into pcDNA3.1/V5/His-TOPO (Invitrogen). Constitutively active CD4/tlr13 was constructed by fusing cDNAs encoding the extracellular domain of murine CD4 (amino acids 1–391) to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of murine tlr13 (amino acids 769–991). CD4/TLR4 plasmid was kindly provided by R. Medzhitov (Yale University). Various cell types were sorted from single-cell suspensions of C57BL/6 mouse spleens. Cells were stained with combinations of fluorescence-conjugated monoclonal antibodies (BD Pharmingen) and were sorted by a FACSAria (BD Biosciences) with the following sorting criteria for each cell type: B cell, CD19+; CD4 T cell, CD3+CD4+; macrophage, CD11b+F4/80+; myeloid dendritic cell, CD11c+CD11b+. Dendritic cells were further sorted with CD11c+CD45RAhighCD11blow for plasmatocytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and CD11c+CD45RAnegCD11bhigh for cDCs. The purity of all the sorted cell types was greater than 96%, as determined by post-sorting flow cytometry with a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). These procedures were performed as previously described (3Shi Z. Cai Z. Wen S. Chen C. Gendron C. Sanchez A. Patterson K. Fu S. Yang J. Wildman D. Finnell R.H. Zhang D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 20540-20547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). HEK293, MEFs, or NIH3T3 cells were seeded into 24-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well in antibiotic-free media. The next day cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Briefly, 0.8 μg of DNA including TLRs, CD4-TIRs, and reporter plasmids were diluted with Opti-MEM and then mixed with diluted Lipofectamine 2000. After 20 min of incubation at room temperature, the mixtures were added to each well. Dual-luciferase assays (Promega) were performed 24 h after transfection according to the manufacturer's protocol. After a PBS wash, cells were lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, and then the supernatant was incubated with 0.5 μg of antibody and rotated for 3 h at 4 °C. After adding a protein G-agarose bead suspension (Santa Cruz), the mixture was further incubated with rotation for 3 h at 4 °C. After washing with the washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate) 3 times, the beads were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Immunoprecipitates or whole cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF transfer membrane (Thermo Scientific). The membranes were probed with appropriate antibodies. IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies followed. The proteins on the membrane were detected using the ECL-Plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). HEK293 cells and NIH3T3 cells seeded on glass coverslips were transiently transfected with tlr13-GFP and UNC93B1-RFP using Lipofectamine 2000. After 24 h, coverslips were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Subcellular localizations of tlr13-GFP and UNC93B1 were visualized by an LSM 510 laser confocal system (Zeiss) with an oil immersion lens (magnification, ×63). For retroviral gene transduction, tlr13-GFP and UNC93B1-RFP were cloned into pBabe-puro plasmids. To produce the replication incompetent virions, HEK293T cells were transfected with respective pBabe-puro-tlr13-GFP or pBabe-puro-UNC93B1-RFP and helper plasmids (Oligoengine) using Lipofectamine 2000. Twenty-four and forty-eight hours after transfection, the viral supernatant was collected, filtered, and frozen. The viruses were added to RAW264.7 macrophages or bone marrow dendritic cells seeded onto glass coverslips in the presence of Polybrene (8 μg/ml) (Sigma). Twenty-four hours after viral infection, cells were washed and fixed, then visualized by laser confocal microscope as described above. VSV-AV1, a VSV harboring a point mutation in the M gene, was a gift from Glen Barber (University of Miami). Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was generated and titered on baby hamster kidney (BHK21) cells. In brief, BHK21 cells were infected with VSV-AV1 at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01, incubated until more than 70% cells exhibit clear cytopathic effects. Cell supernatant was harvested and separated into aliquots at −80 °C. To titer VSV-AV1, BHK21 cells were seeded on a 6-well plate at 8 × 105 cells per well. The next day serial dilutions of the stocked virus were made in DMEM without serum. 300 μl of the diluted virus suspension was then added to PBS-washed BHK21 cells. After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, viruses were removed. Subsequently, wells were overlaid with 2 ml of growth medium with 1% low-melting agarose and incubated at 37 °C for 36 h. After staining with crystal violet/methanol mix, the viral titer was estimated by counting the plaque number. Mouse cDNA encoding full-length TLR7, UNC93B1, IRF3, and IRF7 were amplified from the mouse spleen cDNA. Tlr13 cDNA was cloned into pCMV-Tag2 (Stratagene) and pEGFP-N3 (Clontech) vectors. UNC93B1 was inserted into both pCMV-Tag2 and pDsRed1-N1 (Clontech) vectors. Others were cloned into pCMV-Tag2 vector. IFN-β promoter-driven luciferase reporter construct was kindly provided by Dr. S. Akira (Japan). A pSuper-retro vector (Ambion) was used to generate shRNA plasmids for tlr13 knockdown. The following target sequences have been selected: 5′-TGAAAAAACTCCAGTCTTT-3′ (shTLR13–1), 5′-CAATCTGTCTGCTCTGGTG-3′ (shTLR13–2). The authenticity of these plasmids was confirmed by sequencing. The silencing vector expressing siRNA targeting TRIF was obtained from InvivoGen. We used quantitative real-time RT-PCR to examine the profile of expression of tlr13 in different mouse organs and found that tlr13 was expressed strongly only in the spleen (Fig. 1A). tlr13 expression in different cell types of the spleen was further analyzed by RT-PCR after cell sorting of splenocytes by FACS. We isolated CD4+T cells, B cells, macrophages, and DCs cells. RNA from these cells was isolated and used for tlr13 expression analysis by RT-PCR. β-Actin was used as a control to normalize the level of tlr13 expression. tlt13 was expressed strongly in DCs and macrophages (Fig. 1B), indicating that tlr13 is involved in innate immune responses. The dendritic cells were further sorted to isolate pDCs and cDCs. Unlike TLR7, which was expressed in pDCs, tlr13 was expressed predominately in cDCs (Fig. 1C). We then determined whether tlr13 is capable of activating signal transduction pathways that lead to the activation of NF-κB and interferon (4Takeda K. Kaisho T. Akira S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 335-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (4731) Google Scholar, 5O'Neill L.A. Immunity. 2008; 29: 12-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). A constitutive activated TLR can be generated by using the CD4 extracellular domain and the TLR intracellular TIR domain chimera (6Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Janeway Jr., C.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (4416) Google Scholar). Because CD4 autodimerizes, the functional TLR-TIR domain will activate TLR signaling pathways. We generated a CD4-tlr13 fusion construct and overexpressed it along with an NF-κB or IFN-β luciferase reporter into 293 cells and MEF cells. Like the expression of CD4-TLR4 (6Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Janeway Jr., C.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (4416) Google Scholar), the expression of CD4-tlr13 led to the activation of both NF-κB and IFN-β (Fig. 2). This result suggests that tlr13 is a functional TLR that activates the TLR signal transduction pathway leading to the activation of both NF-κB and IFN-β. Signal transduction by TLRs after ligand engagement is initiated with the recruitment of cytosolic TIR-containing adaptor proteins, including MyD88, TIRAP (MAL), TRIF (TICAM1), and TRAM (TICAM2). MyD88 is utilized by all TLRs except TLR3. To determine the tlr13 signaling pathway, we cotransfected constitutive active CD4/tlr13 alone with IFN-β luciferase reporter into MyD88 knock-out, TRIF knockdown, or TAK1 knock-out MEFs. The IFN-β activation was abolished in both MyD88- and TAK1-deficient cells but not in TRIF knockdown cells (Fig. 3, A and B), suggesting that overexpression of tlr13 activates the MyD88- and TAK1-dependent pathway. Then we determined whether tlr13 was able to interact directly with TRIF or MyD88. Indeed, we found that tlr13 was able to interact with MyD88 (Fig. 3C) but not with TRIF (data not shown). TLR2 requires heterodimerization with either TLR1 or TLR6 to promote signal transduction (7Bulut Y. Faure E. Thomas L. Equils O. Arditi M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 987-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 8Ozinsky A. Underhill D.M. Fontenot J.D. Hajjar A.M. Smith K.D. Wilson C.B. Schroeder L. Aderem A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 13766-13771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1675) Google Scholar). This heterodimerization may help to significantly increase the spectrum of ligands recognized by these receptors. Does tlr13 collaborate with any of the other Toll-like receptors? It is well known that the majority of the current commercial TLR antibodies lack specificity, whereas small epitope-tag antibodies such as anti-V5, anti-Myc, and anti-FLAG tags do work well. For this reason, we generated FLAG epitope-tagged mouse TLR constructs and a V5 and Myc epitope-tagged mouse tlr13 constructs. We co-transfected these constructs into 293 cells and immunoprecipitated the tagged tlr13 from transfected cell extracts. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed on SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-V5, anti-FLAG, or anti-myc antibodies to identify interactions between TLRs and tlr13. We did not identify heterodimerization between tlr13 with other TLRs (data not shown); however, tlr13 can become a homodimer (Fig. 3D). Among TLRs, TLR1, -2, -4, -5, -6, and -11 are expressed on the cell surface and specialize in the detection of bacteria; in contrast, TLR3, -7, -8, and -9 are expressed intracellularly and specialize in viral detection. The mechanisms by which their ligands, including double and single-stranded RNA and unmethylated CpG DNA, activate their respective intracellular TLRs have not been determined, although it has been shown that stimulation by CpG requires its internalization into late endosomal or lysosomal compartments. We first used immune-staining analysis with confocal microscopy to determine the subcellular localization of tlr13 in its expressed 293, NIH3T3 cells, and Raw264.7 cells (Fig. 4 and data not shown). Tlr13 appeared to be an intracellular receptor. It has been demonstrated that UNC93B, an endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein, associates with TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9, and it resides in the endoplasmic reticulum and endosomes (9Brinkmann M.M. Spooner E. Hoebe K. Beutler B. Ploegh H.L. Kim Y.M. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 10Kim Y.M. Brinkmann M.M. Paquet M.E. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 2008; 452: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). UNC93B also plays an important role in the activation of these intracellular TLRs. We then wanted to determine whether tlr13, as a novel intracellular TLR, behaved the same way as other intracellular TLRs. Indeed, our results showed tlr13 and UNC93B displayed co-localization when we cotransfected them into both HEK293 and NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 4) (9Brinkmann M.M. Spooner E. Hoebe K. Beutler B. Ploegh H.L. Kim Y.M. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 10Kim Y.M. Brinkmann M.M. Paquet M.E. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 2008; 452: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Tlr13 is a novel and poorly characterized member of the Toll-like receptor family, and elucidation of the function of this novel TLR depends mainly on the identification of its natural ligand. To begin to identify and characterize the ligand for tlr13, it was necessary to have a cell line that can demonstrate tlr13-specific activity. After testing many cell lines, we found that NIH3T3 is a good cell model as it does not respond to TLR ligands unless TLRs are overexpressed (11Burger-Kentischer A. Abele I.S. Finkelmeier D. Wiesmüller K.H. Rupp S. J. Immunol. Methods. 2010; 358: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We first tested whether the known ligands of other TLRs can activate the tlr13 signaling pathways by measuring NF-κB or IFN-β activity. As shown in Fig. 5, A and B, none of the tested cognate ligands for TLRs was able to activate NF-κB or IFN-β in the tlr13-expressing NIH3T3 cells, indicating that tlr13 recognizes a novel tlr13 specific ligand. To seek the pathogen that might be recognized by tlr13, we tested the Gram-positive Staphylococcus K2 strain and the Gram-negative Salmonella SR11 strain to stimulate NF-κB activity in the cells. Our results demonstrate that tlr13 recognizes neither Gram-positive nor Gram-negative bacteria (data not shown). Although we do not know the natural ligand for tlr13, we do know that tlr13 is an intracellular TLR (Fig. 4) (10Kim Y.M. Brinkmann M.M. Paquet M.E. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 2008; 452: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 12Tabeta K. Hoebe K. Janssen E.M. Du X. Georgel P. Crozat K. Mudd S. Mann N. Sovath S. Goode J. Shamel L. Herskovits A.A. Portnoy D.A. Cooke M. Tarantino L.M. Wiltshire T. Steinberg B.E. Grinstein S. Beutler B. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 156-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). We then made an assumption that the intracellular tlr13 might recognize viruses, similar to other intracellular TLRs including TLR3, -7, -8, and -9. Indeed, tlr13 is involved in the recognition of VSV, and it induces tlr13-specific INF-β activity (Fig. 5, C and D); however, tlr13 appeared not to respond to VSV RNA (Fig. 5B). To confirm tlr13 specificity we then knocked down tlr13 by using of RNA interference. We designed shRNAs targeting tlr13 and cloned them into the pSUPER Retro vector (13Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3963) Google Scholar). An shRNA with the most efficient suppression of the expression of tlr13 was used. To test the role of tlr13 in VSV infection, we transfected the shRNA or scramble vector into MEF cells. The cells with silenced tlr13 almost lost the ability to inhibit VSV (Fig. 5, E and F), indicating that VSV contains a tlr13-specific activity. TLRs sense viruses that enter the endosome through endocytosis. Then the downstream pathway leads to the activation of the transcription factors NF-κB, IRF3, and IRF7, ultimately inducing the production of type I interferons (14Akira S. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O. Cell. 2006; 124: 783-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8722) Google Scholar, 15Xagorari A. Chlichlia K. Open Microbiol. J. 2008; 2: 49-59Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IRF3 and IRF7 are the key regulators that potently induce IFN-β production during viral infection in different cell types (16Honda K. Takaoka A. Taniguchi T. Immunity. 2006; 25: 349-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar, 17Honda K. Yanai H. Negishi H. Asagiri M. Sato M. Mizutani T. Shimada N. Ohba Y. Takaoka A. Yoshida N. Taniguchi T. Nature. 2005; 434: 772-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar). To analyze which IRF is utilized by tlr13 to activate IFN-β, NIH3T3 cells were overexpressed with tlr13 and vector plasmids or IRFs followed by VSV infection for 12 h. We found that IRF7, not IRF3, is the downstream molecule of tlr13 responsible for triggering IFN-β activation (Fig. 6, A and B). Tlr13 is a novel and uncharacterized member of the mammalian TLR family, although only its partial sequence has been reported (2Tabeta K. Georgel P. Janssen E. Du X. Hoebe K. Crozat K. Mudd S. Shamel L. Sovath S. Goode J. Alexopoulou L. Flavell R.A. Beutler B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 3516-3521Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Based on phylogenetic analysis, Beutler and co-workers (2Tabeta K. Georgel P. Janssen E. Du X. Hoebe K. Crozat K. Mudd S. Shamel L. Sovath S. Goode J. Alexopoulou L. Flavell R.A. Beutler B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 3516-3521Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar), using a multiple sequence alignment of leucine-rich repeat domains of TLRs, claimed that tlr13 belongs to the TLR3 subfamily. In contrast, Aderem and co-workers (18Roach J.C. Glusman G. Rowen L. Kaur A. Purcell M.K. Smith K.D. Hood L.E. Aderem A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 9577-9582Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar), by performing a multiple sequence alignment of the full-length amino acids of TLRs and by using systemic evolutionary analysis, indicated that tlr13 belongs to the tlr11 subfamily. However, our experimental results demonstrate that tlr13 function does not belong to either the TLR3 or the tlr11 subfamily. TLR3 is an intracellular TLR that activates only the MyD88-independent TRIF pathway (19Alexopoulou L. Holt A.C. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4908) Google Scholar), whereas tlr11 is a cell-surface TLR and activates the MyD88-dependent pathway (1Zhang D. Zhang G. Hayden M.S. Greenblatt M.B. Bussey C. Flavell R.A. Ghosh S. Science. 2004; 303: 1522-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar, 20Yarovinsky F. Zhang D. Andersen J.F. Bannenberg G.L. Serhan C.N. Hayden M.S. Hieny S. Sutterwala F.S. Flavell R.A. Ghosh S. Sher A. Science. 2005; 308: 1626-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). As for tlr13, although it is an intracellular TLR, it activates the MyD88-dependent pathway, a characteristic similar to TLR7/8 (21Takeuchi O. Akira S. Cell. 2010; 140: 805-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5704) Google Scholar). The elucidation of the function of tlr13 depends mainly on the identification of its natural ligand. An intracellular TLR almost exclusively functions as a nucleic acid sensor. For example, TLR3 recognizes dsRNA, TLR7/8 recognizes single-stranded RNA, and TLR9 recognizes CpG DNA (21Takeuchi O. Akira S. Cell. 2010; 140: 805-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5704) Google Scholar, 22Iwasaki A. Medzhitov R. Science. 2010; 327: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar, 23Beutler B. Immunol. Rev. 2009; 227: 248-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Therefore tlr13, as another intracellular TLR, might recognize DNA or RNA. Tlr13 appears to be able to recognize VSV, but the exact natural ligand of tlr13 is currently unknown and needs to be further identified. VSV is a single-stranded RNA virus member of the Rhabdoviridae family. The role of innate immunity in the recognition of this virus represents an insight of antiviral responses triggered by the host. Beyond tlr13, TLR7 has been implicated in the recognition of VSV. Lund et al. (24Lund J.M. Alexopoulou L. Sato A. Karow M. Adams N.C. Gale N.W. Iwasaki A. Flavell R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 5598-5603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar) demonstrated that in pDCs TLR7 was necessary for the production of IFN-α, a cytokine implicated in the induction of innate and the adaptive immunity during viral infections. Moreover, it was shown that the recognition of VSV by TLR7 was in endosomal compartments. Additionally, in vivo studies demonstrated a reduction in the response to VSV in mice deficient in TLR7 or MyD88. Another study found that although VSV intranasal infection was MyD88-dependent, VSV intravenous infection was not (25Zhou S. Kurt-Jones E.A. Fitzgerald K.A. Wang J.P. Cerny A.M. Chan M. Finberg R.W. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 5173-5181Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Other studies suggested that as VSV replicated in lung epithelial cells, the viral ribonucleoprotein induced the activation of TBK1 and the up-regulation of IκB kinase ϵ, which are noncanonical IκB kinase-related kinases involved in the production of type 1 interferons (26tenOever B.R. Sharma S. Zou W. Sun Q. Grandvaux N. Julkunen I. Hemmi H. Yamamoto M. Akira S. Yeh W.C. Lin R. Hiscott J. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 10636-10649Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Oganesyan et al. (27Oganesyan G. Saha S.K. Guo B. He J.Q. Shahangian A. Zarnegar B. Perry A. Cheng G. Nature. 2006; 439: 208-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar) showed that TRAF3-deficient MEF cells and Flt3-ligand-derived dendritic cells from Traf3−/− mice had higher susceptibility to VSV infection. Taken together, their findings suggest that this molecule is necessary for the production of type I interferons induced both by TLR-dependent and TLR-independent pathways. Besides TLRs, the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase PKR and the retinoic acid-inducible protein I (RIG-I) have been related in the protection against VSV infection. Mice deficient in PKR showed an increased in susceptibility to this kind of infection (28Balachandran S. Roberts P.C. Brown L.E. Truong H. Pattnaik A.K. Archer D.R. Barber G.N. Immunity. 2000; 13: 129-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Akira and co-workers demonstrated that RIG-1 was important for the response against VSV in several cells but not in pDCs (29Kato H. Sato S. Yoneyama M. Yamamoto M. Uematsu S. Matsui K. Tsujimura T. Takeda K. Fujita T. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Immunity. 2005; 23: 19-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). Moreover, bone marrow-derived DCs generated by granulocyte-macrophage-stimulating factor and transfected with RNAs prepared from VSV showed a RIG-I-dependent production of IFN-α. Also, RIG-I−/− mice presented higher susceptibility to VSV infection and a diminished interferon response (30Kato H. Takeuchi O. Sato S. Yoneyama M. Yamamoto M. Matsui K. Uematsu S. Jung A. Kawai T. Ishii K.J. Yamaguchi O. Otsu K. Tsujimura T. Koh C.S. Reis e Sousa C. Matsuura Y. Fujita T. Akira S. Nature. 2006; 441: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (2887) Google Scholar). Our data showed that tlr13 represents another molecule that recognizes VSV. The relationships between tlr13 and TLR7 as well as tlr13 with RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) family members need to be further defined. In summary, tlr13 is a novel and functional TLR that is predominantly expressed in DCs and macrophages. Tlr13 not only activates a MyD88- and TAK1-dependent TLR signaling pathway to activate NF-κB but also induces type 1 interferon through IRF7. As an intracellular TLR, Tlr13 is involved in the recognition of VSV infection. We thank Lida Keene for critical reading of the manuscript and S. Ghosh for advice."

Little is known about the abundance and sources of CO prior to the industrial age, or about the importance of anthropogenic activities on its budget. Wang et al. (p. 1663 , published online 2 December; see the Perspective by Prentice ) present a 650-year-long record of CO atmospheric concentration and isotopic composition, using samples from Antarctic ice cores, in order to begin to reconstruct past CO variability and its causes. The concentration of CO decreased by ∼25% from the mid-1300s to the 1600s, and then recovered completely by the late 1800s. Large variations in the degree of biomass burning in the Southern Hemisphere are likely to have been primarily responsible for the observed changes."

The early Holocene SSTs were also characterized by millennial-scale fluctuations that correlate with cosmogenic nuclide proxies of solar variability, with inferred solar minima corresponding to El Niño-like (warm) conditions, in apparent agreement with the theoretical ""ocean dynamical thermostat"" response of ENSO to exogenous radiative forcing."
https://openalex.org/W2010605544,"Poor memory after brain damage is usually considered to be a result of information being lost or rendered inaccessible. It is assumed that such memory impairment must be due to the incorrect interpretation of previously encountered information as being novel. In object recognition memory experiments with rats, we found that memory impairment can take the opposite form: a tendency to treat novel experiences as familiar. This impairment could be rescued with the use of a visual-restriction procedure that reduces interference. Such a pattern of data can be explained in terms of a recent representational-hierarchical view of cognition."

Calmegin (CLGN) and calsperin (CALR3) have been reported to be testis-specific homologs of CANX and CALR, respectively (19Watanabe D. Okabe M. Hamajima N. Morita T. Nishina Y. Nishimune Y.

We have shown previously that CLGN is a CANX-like lectin chaperone during spermatogenesis and is required for the assembly of ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) sperm fertilizing proteins ADAM1A/ADAM2 and ADAM1B/ADAM2 (21Ikawa M.

The ADAM1B/ADAM2 complex, also known as fertilin, was first identified as a protein required for sperm-egg fusion but was later proved to be dispensable for fertilization using gene-disrupted mice (23Cho C.

On the contrary, ER-resident ADAM1A/ADAM2 is critical for subsequent ADAM3 maturation and sperm fertilizing ability (24Kim E. Yamashita M. Nakanishi T. Park K.E. Kimura M. Kashiwabara S. Baba T. J.

CALR3 was first identified as a CALR homolog through BLASTP analysis, and its testis-specific expression was demonstrated by Northern blot analysis (20Persson S. Rosenquist M. Sommarin M.

In this study, we generated Calr3−/− mice and describe the indispensable role of CALR3 in the development of sperm fertilizing ability. In contrast to CLGN, CALR3 does not have broad lectin-like activity but directly associates with ADAM3 and is required for its maturation. We therefore conclude that the testis-specific calreticulin homologs CLGN and CALR3 have distinct but cooperative roles in the maturation of ADAM3 during spermatogenesis and subsequent sperm fertilizing ability. Rabbit antisera against the CALR C-terminal peptide (EEDEKEEDEEESPGQAKDEL) and the CALR3 C-terminal peptide (MGKFHRHWHLSRFHRQGEL) were raised for this study (supplemental Fig. S1).

Monoclonal antibodies were described previously (TRA369 for CLGN (30Watanabe D. Sawada K. Koshimizu U. Kagawa T. Nishimune Y. Mol. Reprod.

Reprod. 2006; 75: 760-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar)), established in this study (KS107–158 for ADAM1B, KS107–190 for ADAM2, and KS64–125 for IZUMO1), or purchased (7C1 for ADAM3 (Chemicon), 7C5 for ZP3R (SP56; QED Bioscience), and SC53029 for α-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)). Immunoblot analysis was performed as described previously (26Yamaguchi R. Yamagata K. Ikawa M. Moss S.B. Okabe M. Biol. Reprod. 2006; 75: 760-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, sperm from the epididymis and vas deferens were collected and incubated in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 for 20 min on ice. The various tissues were excised and homogenized in lysis buffer and then placed on ice for 1 h. These extracts were centrifuged, and the supernatants were collected. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore). After blocking, blots were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Detection was performed using an ECL Western blotting detection kit (GE Healthcare). Testes were collected from adult mice and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS overnight at 4 °C, cryopreserved in graded 10–30% sucrose, and embedded in a Tissue-Tek O.C.T. compound (Sakura Finetechnical Co.). Frozen sections (8 μm) were mounted on aminopropyltriethoxysilane-coated glass slides. After washing with PBS, slides were blocked with 10% newborn calf serum/PBS for 1 h and incubated with primary antibodies in 10% newborn calf serum/PBS at 4 °C overnight. After washing with PBS, the slides were incubated with secondary antibodies with Alexa Fluor 488 or 546 (Invitrogen) in 10% newborn calf serum/PBS for 2 h. After washing with PBS, the slides were observed under an Olympus IX-70 fluorescence microscope with a Nipkow disk confocal scanner unit (CSU-X1, Yokogawa Electric) and a cooled charge-coupled device camera (CoolSNAP HQ, Photometrics). Device control and image capture were performed with MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices). Immunoprecipitation was performed by magnetic bead separation (MACS separation, Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer's protocol with minor modifications. Briefly, wild-type or Calr3−/− testis was solubilized with 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 1% protease inhibitor mixture (Nacalai Tesque). Lysates were centrifuged at 15,300 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. One mg of testis lysate was incubated with 2 μl of each antiserum and 50 μl of Protein A-conjugated MicroBeads (MACS Protein A MicroBeads, Miltenyi Biotec) for 2 h at 4 °C. The samples were applied to columns in the magnetic field of the μMACS separator, and the columns were rinsed four times with 200 μl of wash buffer (1 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)) and once with 100 μl of low salt wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 1% Nonidet P-40). Finally, 70 μl of preheated (96 °C) 1× SDS sample buffer was applied to the columns, and eluate fractions were collected for analysis by SDS-PAGE. For deglycosylation, the testis lysates prepared as described above were treated with endoglycosidase H (Roche Applied Science) at 37 °C overnight according to the manufacturer's instructions. The treated lysates were used for immunoprecipitation assays. Testes from mutant mice were homogenized in lysis buffer containing 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, and 20 mm iodoacetamide (Nacalai Tesque) to prepare 1 mg/ml lysate. The lysate was incubated with 0, 0.25, 0.75, 1.25, and 2.5 μg/ml l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C. Trypsin digestion was terminated by the addition of 200 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). Samples were analyzed by reducing or nonreducing SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-ADAM3 antibody. For cell-surface proteins, live germ cells were collected from testes. The seminiferous tubules were minced with a razor blade to release germ cells. The cell suspension in PBS was filtered through a nylon mesh, the cells were collected by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 5 min, and the cell pellet was resuspended in PBS. The germ cells (5 × 107 cells/ml) were incubated with 0, 20, and 40 μg/ml l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin for 5 min at 20 °C and then homogenized in lysis buffer. Three B6D2F1 females were caged with each male for 1 month and kept another 3 weeks to observe pregnancy. Four males were examined for each group. Sperm migration from the uterus into the oviduct was examined as described previously (22Ikawa M. Nakanishi T. Yamada S. Wada I. Kominami K. Tanaka H. Nozaki M. Nishimune Y. Okabe M. Dev. Biol. 2001; 240: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Briefly, oviducts with the proximal part of the uterus were excised 2 h after copulation and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS. Frozen sections containing the uterotubal junction were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and observed under the microscope. Eggs collected from superovulated females, 14 h after human chorionic gonadotropin injection, were treated with hyaluronidase (1 mg/ml) for 5 min to remove cumulus cells and then placed in a 200-μl TYH medium (44Toyoda Y. Yokoyama M. Hoshi T. Jpn. J. Anim. Reprod. 1971; 16: 147-151Crossref Google Scholar) drop covered with paraffin oil. Epididymal sperm were collected from 3-month-old male mice and incubated in TYH medium for 2 h for capacitation. Capacitated sperm were added to the drop containing eggs at a final concentration of 2 × 105 sperm/ml. After 8 h of co-incubation, the formation of pronuclei was observed under a Hoffman modulation contrast microscope. To assess the zona pellucida binding ability, cumulus-free eggs were incubated with capacitated sperm for 20 min prior to observation. To assess the fusion ability, the zona pellucida was dissolved in acidic Tyrode's solution for 30 s to 1 min, and the eggs were preloaded with Hoechst 33342 (1 μg/ml) by incubation for 10 min and washing them before insemination. After 30 min of co-incubation with capacitated sperm, the eggs were fixed in 0.25% glutaraldehyde and observed under a fluorescence microscope with ultraviolet excitation (31Inoue N. Okabe M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2008; 475: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Partial zona dissection was performed with a piezo-micromanipulator with a glass capillary needle (diameter of 5–10 μm) (32Yamagata K. Nakanishi T. Ikawa M. Yamaguchi R. Moss S.B. Okabe M. Dev. Biol. 2002; 250: 348-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fertilized eggs were counted at the two-cell stage and then transferred into the oviduct of pseudopregnant females. All values are the means ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments. Statistical analyses were performed using Student's t test. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. We raised anti-CALR3 antibodies and showed that expression of CALR3 was testis-specific (Fig. 1A). We next determined the differentiation stage-specific expression of CALR3 in mouse testis (Fig. 1, B–D). Whereas constitutive expression of CALR and CANX started at birth, CLGN and CALR3 appeared at 2 and 3 weeks of age, respectively (Fig. 1B). In mouse, spermatogenesis begins at birth, and germ cells enter and exit meiosis at approximately 11 and 21 days of age (33Clermont Y. Trott M. Fertil. Steril. 1969; 20: 805-817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Therefore, the onset of CLGN and CALR3 expression was considered to be meiotic and post-meiotic, respectively. It is notable that CLGN expression preceded that of CALR3, mirroring the offset expression of ADAM1B/ADAM2 and ADAM3 (Fig. 1B). When we stained testicular sections with antibodies (Fig. 1, C and D), post-meiotic expression of CALR3 was reconfirmed, whereas CLGN expression faded after meiosis. The stage-specific expression and co-localization of CLGN and CALR3 suggested that they may have independent yet cooperative functions. To analyze the physiological function of CALR3 in vivo, we generated Calr3−/− mice. The targeting vector was constructed by substituting exons 3 and 4 with a neomycin resistance gene cassette in reverse orientation relative to the CALR3 transcriptional unit (supplemental Fig. S2A). The targeting event in embryonic stem cells and the germ line transmission were confirmed by PCR analysis (supplemental Fig. S2B). Intercrosses between heterozygous F1 mice yielded offspring that segregated in a Mendelian distribution: 28 wild-type mice (+/+) and 51 heterozygous (+/−) and 26 homozygous (−/−) mutant mice. No overt developmental abnormalities were observed in Calr3−/− mice. In Calr3−/− testis, Calr3 mRNA was not detected (supplemental Fig. S2C). Apart from the lack of CALR3, we found no significant differences in the protein amount of CANX, CALR, CLGN, and the Hsp70 ER chaperone HSPA5 (Bip/GRP78) (supplemental Fig. S2D). When we observed testicular sections, disruption of CALR3 in the testis caused no deleterious effect on spermatogenesis (supplemental Fig. S2E). Whereas Calr3−/− females were as fertile as wild-type females, Calr3−/− males were almost sterile despite normal mating behavior, with successful sperm ejaculation and vaginal plug formation. Only one litter with two pups was obtained from 50 copulations with four Calr3−/− males, whereas 21 litters from 22 copulations were obtained from four wild-type males (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S3). Even though ejaculated Calr3−/− sperm in the uterus showed a normal appearance and motility, their migration into the oviduct was severely impaired (Fig. 2, B–D). Almost no Calr3−/− sperm were found in the uterotubal junction even 2 h after copulation. Therefore, impaired sperm migration into the oviduct is the primary cause of Calr3−/− male sterility. We next examined sperm fertilizing ability in vitro. Epididymal sperm collected from Calr3−/− mice showed a normal morphology and viability in the in vitro fertilization medium. When sperm parameters were analyzed with the computer-aided sperm analysis system (SMAS, Kaga Solution Network Co., Ltd.), there were no significant differences in motility, velocity, and linearity over 2 h (supplemental Table S1). However, when the sperm were co-incubated with unfertilized eggs, Calr3−/− sperm could not bind to the zona pellucida despite frequent collisions with the eggs (Fig. 3A and supplemental Movies S1 and S2). As a result, in vitro fertilization efficiency was drastically decreased in Calr3−/− sperm (94.2 ± 1.8% with +/+ and 0% with −/− sperm (n = 3), p < 0.001) (Fig. 3B). When zona pellucida binding and penetration were bypassed by removal of the zona pellucida, Calr3−/− sperm were able to fuse with 94.6 ± 0.2% of eggs (100% with +/+ sperm, n = 3) (Fig. 3, C and D). Because solubilized zona remnants coat the egg plasma membrane and attract +/+ sperm, less binding was observed with Calr3−/− sperm, similar to that seen with Clgn−/− sperm (32Yamagata K. Nakanishi T. Ikawa M. Yamaguchi R. Moss S.B. Okabe M. Dev. Biol. 2002; 250: 348-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Zona removal tends to lead to polyspermy (Fig. 3C), so we performed partial zona dissection prior to in vitro fertilization to decrease the risk of polyspermy and examined the developmental ability of eggs fertilized with Calr3−/− sperm (Fig. 3, E–G). Healthy and fertile offspring developed from eggs fertilized in this way, indicating the genomic integrity of Calr3−/− sperm. As we expected, all the offspring were +/− mutants and showed normal fecundity. To exclude the possibility that the phenotype was caused by a side effect of genetic and/or epigenetic interference from the mutant Calr3 locus, at which there are three other genes starting within 3 kbp upstream and downstream of Calr3 (supplemental Fig. S2A), we generated transgenic mouse lines expressing Calr3 on the Calr3−/− background (supplemental Fig. S3). The recovery of male fertility was observed in two independent transgenic lines (litter size of 8.6 ± 2.7 and 9.0 ± 2.9), demonstrating that the CALR3 disruption by itself diminished the sperm fertilizing ability. Because CALR3 is absent in mature sperm (Fig. 1A), the sperm defects are likely to be secondary effects of CALR3 disruption during spermatogenesis. Previously, we have demonstrated that ADAM2 is specifically recognized by CLGN, but not by CANX, and that the heterodimerization of ADAM1A/ADAM2 and ADAM1B/ADAM2 is diminished with CLGN disruption (22Ikawa M. Nakanishi T. Yamada S. Wada I. Kominami K. Tanaka H. Nozaki M. Nishimune Y. Okabe M. Dev. Biol. 2001; 240: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In contrast, heterodimerization was not disrupted in Calr3−/− testis (Fig. 4A). Unlike CLGN, CALR3 did not associate with ADAM1B and ADAM2 in wild-type testis (Fig. 4B). Using a co-immunoprecipitation assay, we found that CALR3 and CANX, but not CALR, specifically associated with ADAM3 (Fig. 4B), demonstrating chaperone and client selectivity. To investigate whether CALR3 can interact with other client proteins, we performed biochemical studies on HepG2 transfectants in the presence of the glucosidase inhibitor castanospermine. Although CALR clearly interacted with putative clients in a lectin-dependent manner, CALR3 was not a lectin chaperone for general nascent proteins (supplemental Fig. S4). We next examined whether endoglycosidase H treatment of ADAM3 influences its interaction with CLGN and CALR3 and found that the treatment did not interfere with CLGN/ADAM3 and CALR3/ADAM3 interactions (Fig. 4C). This suggested that ADAM3 is a lectin-independent client of CLGN and CALR3. We further examined whether the CLGN-mediated maturation of ADAM3 is a prerequisite for CALR3 interaction and found that both CLGN/ADAM3 and CALR3/ADAM3 interactions were not disturbed in Calr3−/− and Clgn−/− testis, respectively (Fig. 4D). To investigate the maturation status/conformation of ADAM3 in Clgn−/− and Calr3−/− mice, we tested the trypsin sensitivity of ADAM3 during spermatogenesis. When cellular extracts were trypsinized, a similar digestion pattern of ADAM3 was observed in all of the wild-type, Clgn−/−, and Calr3−/− testicular cells (Fig. 5A). However, when live spermatogenic cells were trypsinized, ADAM3 was similar in the wild-type and Clgn−/− cells but was absent in the Calr3−/− cells (Fig. 5B). In contrast, ADAM2 was unaffected in Calr3−/− spermatogenic cells but was absent in Clgn−/− cells. The data in Fig. 5B indicate that ADAM3 remains in the secretory pathway in the absence of CALR3, whereas it is transported onto the sperm surface in the absence of CLGN. The absence of ADAM3 in mature sperm of the Calr3−/− mouse was unique among the various sperm fertilizing proteins analyzed (Fig. 6), reinforcing the view that CALR3 does not function as a general chaperone but is client-specific.FIGURE 6Disappearance of ADAM3 from mature Calr3−/− sperm.

B, immunofluorescence staining of sperm with antibodies against ADAM1B, ADAM2, and ADAM3. Fresh sperm collected from the epididymis of mutant mice were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and then immunostained with the following antibodies: KS107–57 (rat anti-mouse ADAM1B), KS107–190 (rat anti-mouse ADAM2), and rabbit anti-mouse ADAM3 (25Nishimura H. Kim E. Nakanishi T. Baba T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34957-34962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). All ADAM proteins were detected in the head region of control +/+ sperm. Whereas Clgn−/− sperm lack all ADAM proteins, Calr3−/− sperm lack only ADAM3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this study, we have shown that CALR3 is a male haploid-specific homolog of a ubiquitously expressed ER lectin-like chaperone, CALR. Whereas CLGN is a lectin chaperone during meiosis (21Ikawa M. Wada I. Kominami K. Watanabe D. Toshimori K. Nishimune Y. Okabe M. Nature. 1997; 387: 607-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), our data suggest that CALR3 lacks broad lectin activity and no longer functions as a general chaperone for nascent N-glycoproteins. Because the essential amino acids required for oligosaccharide binding in CALR are well conserved in CALR3 (34Martin V. Groenendyk J. Steiner S.S. Guo L. Dabrowska M. Parker J.M. Müller-Esterl W. Opas M. Michalak M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2338-2346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the lectin deficiency is likely due to differences in the divergent P domain (20Persson S. Rosenquist M. Sommarin M. Gene. 2002; 297: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 35Michalak M. Groenendyk J. Szabo E. Gold L.I. Opas M. Biochem. J. 2009; 417: 651-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). However, CALR3 directly associates with ADAM3 and controls its maturation. Lectin-deficient chaperone activity was also reported in CALR (18Ireland B.S. Brockmeier U. Howe C.M. Elliott T. Williams D.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 2413-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, we propose that CALR3 is a bona fide molecular chaperone capable of selectively interacting with ADAM3. Our data indicate that CLGN and CALR3 have distinct and specific roles in the maturation of ADAM proteins, similar to that observed for CANX and CALR in the maturation of influenza HA protein (11Molinari M. Eriksson K.K. Calanca V. Galli C. Cresswell P. Michalak M. Helenius A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 125-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). For the assembly of ADAM1A/ADAM2 and ADAM1B/ADAM2, CLGN was essential, but CALR3 was not. For ADAM3 quality control, CALR3 was essential for ADAM3 transport onto the sperm surface, but CLGN was not (Fig. 5). This result adds significantly to our understanding of the distinct roles of CLGN and CALR3 in the quality control of ADAM3. The different chaperone requirements could be explained by the stage-dependent expression, the client specificity, and/or the topological difference that CLGN is membrane-anchored whereas CALR3 is soluble. The defects found in Calr3−/− sperm are very similar to those in sperm from mice lacking CLGN (21Ikawa M. Wada I. Kominami K. Watanabe D. Toshimori K. Nishimune Y. Okabe M. Nature. 1997; 387: 607-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), ADAM1A (25Nishimura H. Kim E. Nakanishi T. Baba T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34957-34962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), ADAM2 (23Cho C. Bunch D.O. Faure J.E. Goulding E.H. Eddy E.M. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. Science. 1998; 281: 1857-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), ADAM3 (27Yamaguchi R. Muro Y. Isotani A. Tokuhiro K. Takumi K. Adham I. Ikawa M. Okabe M. Biol. Reprod. 2009; 81: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), or angiotensin-converting enzyme (36Hagaman J.R. Moyer J.S. Bachman E.S. Sibony M. Magyar P.L. Welch J.E. Smithies O. Krege J.H. O'Brien D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 2552-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Because ADAM3 is the only protein commonly disrupted or displaced in these sperm (27Yamaguchi R. Muro Y. Isotani A. Tokuhiro K. Takumi K. Adham I. Ikawa M. Okabe M. Biol. Reprod. 2009; 81: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 37Ikawa M. Inoue N. Benham A.M. Okabe M. J. Clin. Invest. 2010; 120: 984-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), we believe that ADAM3 plays a central role in both sperm migration into the oviduct and sperm binding to the zona. This is supported by the fact that the ADAM3 directly binds to ZP3 zona pellucida protein (38Kim E. Baba D. Kimura M. Yamashita M. Kashiwabara S. Baba T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 18028-18033Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Recently, a testis-specific homolog of protein-disulfide isomerase (PDILT) was reported (39van Lith M. Hartigan N. Hatch J. Benham A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1376-1383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 40van Lith M. Karala A.R. Bown D. Gatehouse J.A. Ruddock L.W. Saunders P.T. Benham A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2795-2804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because ubiquitously expressed protein-disulfide isomerases such as ERp57 cooperate together with ER lectin chaperones and help in protein disulfide bond formation (41Oliver J.D. van der Wal F.J. Bulleid N.J. High S. Science. 1997; 275: 86-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), it is possible that CALR3 cooperates with PDILT or with other protein-disulfide isomerases during quality control in testes. The elucidation of PDILT function will help us to understand why the testis ER requires specific quality control and how the sperm fertilizing proteins mature during spermatogenesis. It is interesting to note that a plant-specific CALR homolog, also called CRT3, is largely tissue-specific, being expressed mainly in the leaves. Plant CRT3 has been implicated in the specialized quality control of the leucine-rich repeat receptor protein EFR, a protein involved in innate immunity (42Li J. Zhao-Hui C. Batoux M. Nekrasov V. Roux M. Chinchilla D. Zipfel C. Jones J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 15973-15978Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Thus, both plant leaves and mammalian testis have converged upon the same strategy, namely to release a calreticulin homolog from an essential role in calcium homeostasis to mediate distinct quality control processes in the ER. This also suggests that CALR engineering to improve the production of hard to fold glycoproteins may be achievable without adverse effects on the quality control of bystander proteins. We conclude that the testis-specific chaperones CLGN and CALR3 regulate sperm fertilizing ability by playing essential but contrasting functions in ADAM3 maturation. Taken together with the observation that the defective binding of sperm to the zona is reminiscent of unexplained male infertility, manipulation of the testis-specific CLGN/CALR3 ER quality control system could be exploited to develop novel therapeutic approaches for both contraception and treatment of male infertility.

https://openalex.org/W2100826628,"Making a Germ Cell When it comes to generating the germ line, animals fall into two classes: those, like mammals, which use inductive interactions to specify the germ line and those, like nematodes, which use germ plasm—a specialized egg cytoplasm that segregates asymmetrically in embryos. Germ plasm contains germ, or P, granules—RNA-protein aggregates that have been thought to harbor the germ line determinants. Now, Gallo et al. (p. 1685 , published online 2 December) describe a Caenorhabditis elegans mutant that challenges this belief. The germ line still formed even when germ granule components were missegregated. Thus, even in animals with germ plasm, germ granules appear to be a consequence, not a cause, of germ cell specification."

MPTP activates p38MAPK pathway in the dopaminergic neuron (18Karunakaran S. Saeed U. Mishra M. Valli R.K. Joshi S.D. Meka D.P. Seth P. Ravindranath V. J.

Other oxidative neurotoxins such as rotenone and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) also enhance the phosphorylation of p38MAPK (19Gomez-Lazaro M. Galindo M.F. Concannon C.G. Segura M.F. Fernandez-Gomez F.J.

Interestingly, it was previously reported that phosphorylated p38MAPK can regulate ATF6α function via phosphorylation (21Thuerauf D.J. Arnold N.D. Zechner D. Hanford D.S. DeMartin K.M. McDonough P.M.

This was based on the following findings: 1) ATF6α controls the levels of ER chaperones and ERAD component in dopaminergic neurons-containing brain regions (Figs. 1, A–D) and 2). Both MPTP and MPP+ upregulate the expression levels of ER chaperones and ERAD component by activating ATF6α in dopaminergic neurons and SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 2, A, B, C, F, G, H and 4, A, B, E, F, and G); 3) MPTP triggers more formation of clusters of ubiquitin-immunoreactive material in the striatum of ATF6α KO mice than in WT mice (Fig. 3, A and B); 4) Dopaminergic neurons under ATF6α KO conditions are more vulnerable to MPTP neurotoxicity (Fig. 3, C–F). Previous studies showed that MPTP and 6-OHDA induce various ER stress mediators in vitro (24Holtz W.A. O'Malley K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19367-19377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 25Ryu E.J. Harding H.P. Angelastro J.M. Vitolo O.V. Ron D. Greene L.A. J.

Greene L.A. Burke R.E. J. Neurochem. 2005; 95: 974-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). However, it has been unclear how these neurotoxins induce UPR.A plausible mechanism is that MPTP decreases the protein degradation function of striatal UPS (27Fornai F. Schlüter O.M. Lenzi P. Gesi M. Ruffoli R. Ferrucci M. Lazzeri G. Busceti C.L. Pontarelli F. Battaglia G. Pellegrini A. Nicoletti F. Ruggieri S. Paparelli A. Südhof T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 3413-3418Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). A single or intermittent dose of MPTP decreases UPS activity only for a short time and does not lead to the ubiquitinated inclusion bodies in rodent brain (28Shimoji M. Zhang L. Mandir A.S. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2005; 134: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In contrast, continuous MPTP administration causes long-lasting impairment of UPS and the production of inclusion bodies immunoreactive for ubiquitin and α-synuclein in the rodent SNc (27Fornai F. Schlüter O.M. Lenzi P. Gesi M. Ruffoli R. Ferrucci M. Lazzeri G. Busceti C.L. Pontarelli F. Battaglia G. Pellegrini A. Nicoletti F. Ruggieri S. Paparelli A. Südhof T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 3413-3418Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). This report suggests that the inhibition of UPS by MPTP causes the accumulation of unfolded proteins followed by activation of UPR, finally leading to ER stress-induced cell death.Consistent with this hypothesis, our study demonstrated that UPR attenuation caused by ATF6α deletion accelerates the MPTP-induced formation of ubiquitin immunopositive inclusion body in the striatum as well as dopaminergic neuronal death (Fig. 3). This result suggests that MPTP induces accumulation of ubiquitin-positive aggregates presumably as a result of oxidative protein damage to protein folding and its machineries (29Holtz W.A. Turetzky J.M. Jong Y.J. O'Malley K.L. J. Neurochem. 2006; 99: 54-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 30Haynes C.M. Titus E.A. Cooper A.A. Mol.

U.S.A. 2008; 105: 18525-18530Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar) and that activated ATF6α promotes refolding and/or elimination of ubiquitinated proteins in the nerve terminal of dopaminergic neuron by the action of induced ER chaperones and ERAD components. These findings strongly suggest that both UPS and UPR are involved in MPTP-induced dopaminergic neuronal depletion. In our study we stained the striatal sections from MPTP-treated ATF6α WT and KO mice with thioflavin T (amyloid-specific dye) and immunostained with anti-α-synuclein antibody and anti-phosphorylated α-synuclein. However we could not detect any stained aggregates for them (supplemental Fig. S2B). Although it remains to be elucidated what is the major component of the ubiquitinated aggregates in this study, we speculates that oxidative products should be ubiquitinated and accumulated after oxidative stress induced by MPTP.MPP+ interferes with the mitochondrial complex-1, generates ROS. ROS are also generated in the degradation process of dopamine and therefore dopamine is the most oxidative neurotransmitter in brain (16Eisenhofer G. Kopin I.J. Goldstein D.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2004; 56: 331-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). In the present study, ATF6α was activated particularly in the dopaminergic neuron system (Fig. 1, A and B) and the metabolism of dopamine is decreased in ATF6α KO mice (Fig. 1E), suggesting that ROS generated from dopamine metabolic process may play a critical role in the up-regulation of ATF6α-mediated UPR.Previous study showed that ROS induced by both MPP+ and dopamine metabolism promotes phosphorylation of p38MAPK (17Junn E. Mouradian M.M. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 374-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 18Karunakaran S. Saeed U. Mishra M. Valli R.K. Joshi S.D. Meka D.P. Seth P. Ravindranath V. J.

Bymaster F.P. Paul S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 14669-14674Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated p38MAPK phosphorylates ATF6α and mediates the transcriptional induction of the atrial natriuretic factor gene through a serum response element (21Thuerauf D.J. Arnold N.D. Zechner D.

Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 787-795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To explore the relationship between oxidative stress by ROS and UPR by ATF6α, we focused on p38MAPK.We demonstrated that: 1) Both MPTP and MPP+ induce the phosphorylation of p38MAPK in dopaminergic neurons as well as in SH-SY5Y cells (Figs. 2, A, E, K, L and 4, A and D). 2) MPP+ induces ATF6α-mediated up-regulation of BiP expression level in a p38MAPK-dependent manner (Fig. 4, A, E, F, and G). 3) MPP+ triggers the translocation of N-terminal ATF6α to the nucleus and the binding of N-terminal ATF6α with phosphorylated p38MAPK to enhance the transcriptional activity of ATF6α in dopaminergic neurons (Fig. 5, C–J). Hydrogen peroxide, a representative ROS, also activated ATF6α and phosphorylated p38MAPK (supplemental Fig. S2A). Hydrogen peroxide promoted the formation of N-ATF6α-p-p38MAPK complex and enhanced the transcriptional activity of ATF6α to up-regulate ER chaperones and ERAD components (supplemental Fig. S3, D–J).Based on these data, we propose that MPP+-derived oxidative stress results in phosphorylation of p38MAPK, enhancement of ATF6α transcriptional activity, induction of ER chaperones and ERAD components and degradation of ubiquitinated accumulated proteins in dopaminergic neurons. In contrast, under ATF6α-deleted condition, MPP+ triggers the formation of ubiquitinated aggregates in the striatum, and this protein accumulation lead to apoptosis of the dopaminergic neurons (Fig. 6).ER stress and oxidative stress are closely linked events. Another oxidative neurotoxin, 6-OHDA, causes rapid generation of ROS, oxidative modification of protein and activates UPR. Antioxidants reduce UPR activation and apoptosis, and improve protein secretion (29Holtz W.A. Turetzky J.M. Jong Y.J. O'Malley K.L. J. Neurochem. 2006; 99: 54-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This study suggests that UPR protects against oxidative stress-induced cell death. ER stress preconditioning of BiP attenuates H2O2-induced cell injury in LLC-PK1 cells (34Hung C.C. Ichimura T. Stevens J.L. Bonventre J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29317-29326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Precondition of ER chaperones in the striatum expressed by ATF6α under physiological conditions may also suppress dopaminergic neurons depletion induced by MPP+-derived oxidative stress.The p38MAPK pathway is stimulated by cellular stresses, such as free radicals and inflammatory agents, and mediates various kinds of signaling cascades, including; the cell cycle, apoptosis, and cell survival. Previous studies reported that p38MAPK plays a critical role in suppressing ER stress-induced macrophage apoptosis in vitro and advanced lesional macrophage apoptosis in vivo (35Seimon T.A. Wang Y. Han S. Senokuchi T. Schrijvers D.M. Kuriakose G. Tall A.R. Tabas I.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 886-898PubMed Google Scholar). On the contrary, p38MAPK also has a pro-apoptotic role in maintaining homeostasis under various stresses. Phosphorylation of p53 following phosphorylation of p38MAPK up-regulates transcription of Bax and Puma, leading to apoptotic cell death (18Karunakaran S. Saeed U. Mishra M. Valli R.K. Joshi S.D. Meka D.P. Seth P. Ravindranath V. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 12500-12509Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Whether p38MAPK serves as pro- or anti-apoptotic agent seems to be context-dependent.It should be noted that p38MAPK does not activate ATF6α (Fig. 5I) and a p38MAPK phosphorylation inhibitor does not suppress proteolytic cleavage of N-terminal ATF6α in our vitro study (Fig. 4B and supplemental Fig. S2A). This suggests that neither p38MAPK nor phospho-p38MAPK initiates ATF6α-mediated UPR. Mechanism underlying oxidative stress-mediated ATF6α cleavage should be elucidated in the future.The interaction between phosphorylated p38MAPK and cleaved N-terminal ATF6α could results in a protective effect against the vicious cycle of oxidative stress-ER stress by induction of ER chaperones and ERAD components. This p38MAPK-ATF6α interaction provides a new link between oxidative stress and ER stress. ATF6α-mediated induction of ER chaperones and ERAD components via p38MAPK pathway may provide a therapeutic target for Parkinson disease and other neurodegenerative diseases associated with protein misfolding.

Because of its diverse biological function and simultaneous description in different studies, IL-6 was initially assigned several names. It was identified as a T-cell-derived B-cell differentiation factor, as it induced activated B-cells into antibody-producing cells: interferon-β2 (26 kDa protein), a hybridoma/plasmacytoma growth factor and a hepatocyte-stimulating factor. The name IL-6 was proposed when the cDNA nucleotide sequences for these proteins had been determined, and the molecules were found to be identical (1Nishimoto N. Kishimoto T. Nat. Clin.

In addition, IL-6 plays a key role in inflammation, being the main inducer of fibrinogen, serum amyloid A protein, the acute phase response and is one of the most important mediators of fever. In muscle and fatty tissues, IL-6 stimulates energy mobilization. The IL-6 promoter is rapidly activated by cytokines, including IL-1 and TNF-α, as well as by phorbol esters and cyclic AMP. The promoter-region of the IL-6 gene contains multiple regulatory elements such as nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), nuclear factor-IL6 (NF-IL6) (also referred to as C/EBPβ), cAMP response element (CRE), TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) responsive element (TRE; also referred to as the AP-1 binding site), and the glucocorticoid response element (GRE) (2Dendorfer U. Oettgen P. Libermann T.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 4443-4454Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Structurally related to TRE is the antioxidant responsive element (ARE, 2The abbreviations used are: ARE, antioxidant responsive element; l-sulforaphane, (R)-1-isothiocyanato-4-(methylsulfinyl)butane, 4-methylsulfinylbutyl isothiocyanate; DDC, 1,4-dihydro-3,5-dicarbethxycollidine; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; GOI, gene of interest; HK, housekeeping; ALT, alanine aminotransferase. also referred to as the electrophile responsive element (EpRE)) (3Rushmore T.H.

Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Some TREs are found to be embedded within an ARE, such as in the promoter region of human NAD(P)H:quinine oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1), rat and mouse glutathione S-transferase (GST) Ya subunit, and rat GST-P (5Xie T. Belinsky M. Xu Y. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6894-6900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). ARE is commonly found in the promoter region of genes encoding phase II detoxification as well as antioxidant enzymes such as NQO1, thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase, glutathione peroxidase, and hemeoxygenase-1 (6Wasserman W.W. Fahl W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 5361-5366Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Analyses of ARE-nuclear protein complexes have identified numerous nuclear transcription factors including c-Jun, Jun-B, Jun-D, c-Fos, Fra1, Nrf1, Nrf2, Nrf3, c-Maf, MafG, MafK, Bach1, Bach2, the Ah (aromatic hydrocarbon) and estrogen receptor. Nrf2 is described as being the most potent inducer of ARE-mediated expression among these transcription factors. Nrf2 associates with small Maf (MafG or MafK) or Jun (c-Jun, Jun-B, and Jun-D) proteins to up-regulate ARE-mediated expression and coordinate the induction of detoxifying enzymes in response to antioxidants and xenobiotics (7Dhakshinamoorthy S.

Numerous studies support this hypothesis and show that Nrf2 protects various cell types and organs from oxidative stress (10Lee J.M. Li J. Johnson D.A. Stein T.D. Kraft A.D. Calkins M.J. Jakel R.J.

Histopathology. 2009; 55: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Oxidative stress is one main feature in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and its mouse model DDC feeding (12Farrell G.C.

In this study we show that Nrf2 binds to ARE within the promoter region of the IL-6 gene thus highly activating IL-6 transcription. The IL-6 gene appears to be an Nrf2-target. IL-6 expression is induced by Nrf2 stimuli as well as oxidative or electrophilic stress. The results are discussed according to the diverse physiological and pathological functions of IL-6 and Nrf2. Nrf2-Knock-out mice were produced by specifically deleting the Nrf2 gene segment (15Chan K. Lu R. Chang J.C. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 13943-13948Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). WT control mice were littermates of the Nrf2-KO mice. All mice used in this study were 6–8-week-old and maintained in our animal facilities under specific, pathogen-free conditions. The mice were given oral l-sulforaphane ((R)-1-isothiocyanato-4-(methylsulfinyl) butane, 4-methylsulfinylbutyl isothiocyanate, Sigma-Aldrich) at 50 mg/kg body weight/day dissolved in PBS or PBS alone as described in Ref. 16Kong L. Tanito M. Huang Z. Li F. Zhou X. Zaharia A. Yodoi J. McGinnis J.F. Cao W. J. Neurochem. 2007; 101: 1041-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar. For DDC experiments, 6–8-week-old male mice were treated with standard chow containing 0.1% DDC and fed normal drinking water for up to 12 weeks. Liver samples were shock-frozen for homogenization. The plasmid pIL6-luc651 containing 651-bp found directly upstream of the transcriptional start site in the human IL-6 gene promoter was fused to a luciferase gene (17Eickelberg O. Pansky A. Mussmann R. Bihl M. Tamm M. Hildebrand P. Perruchoud A.P. Roth M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12933-12938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The ARE consensus sequence (positions −289 to −276) of the pIL6-luc651 (5′-GTGACTCAGCA-3′) was altered to pIL6-luc651ΔARE (5′-GTGACTCAAGA-3′) by site-directed mutagenesis using QuickChange II Kit from Stratagene. This mutation was previously shown to inhibit Nrf2 binding (6Wasserman W.W. Fahl W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 5361-5366Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). All mutant clones were verified by DNA sequencing. The Nrf2 expression plasmid pcDNA-Nrf2 is described in Ref. 18Wruck C.J. Götz M.E. Herdegen T. Varoga D. Brandenburg L.O. Pufe T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 73: 1785-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar. Human hepatoblastoma (Hep-G2) cells were grown in monolayer cultures in Eagle's minimum essential medium (DMEM) plus fetal bovine serum to a final concentration of 10% (all purchased from LGC Promochem, Wesel, Germany). pIL6-luc651 or pIL6-luc651ΔARE and pRL-TK (4:1 ratio) were mixed with different concentrations of an empty expression plasmid pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) alone or together with pcDNA-Nrf2 and cotransfected in Hep-G2 cells using Lipofectamine2000 from Invitrogen using procedures supplied by the manufacturer. All experiments were conducted using 96-well plates containing 100 μl Medium and ∼3 × 104 cells per well. The Dual Luciferase assay was performed as described in Ref. 18Wruck C.J. Götz M.E. Herdegen T. Varoga D. Brandenburg L.O. Pufe T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 73: 1785-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar. pIL6-luc651 or pIL6-luc651ΔARE reporter plasmids and pRL-TK plasmids (Promega) were cotransfected into HepG2-cells. 24 h after transfection, the cells were seeded to a 96-well plate (3 × 104 cells per well). The activity of both firefly and Renilla luciferases was determined 48 h after transfection with the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured over 10 s in a luminometer (Promega). The luciferase activities were normalized to the Renilla luciferase activity of the internal control. HepG2 cells were grown in the 1.5 ml medium described above using 6-well plates with ∼7 × 107 cells per well. For IL-6 detection within the cell medium (20 μl) we utilized a human IL-6 ELISA from Invitrogen executed in duplicates according to the supplier's recommendation. Mice were treated as described above. Measurements of liver IL-6 expression were performed in duplicates using microsphere-based Luminex xMAP technology with antibodies directed against mice IL-6 protein (Invitrogen). 30 μg of liver homogenates were analyzed in duplicates using procedures recommended by the manufacturer. Mice were treated as described above. mRNA concentrations in liver lysates were measured using the QuantiGene multiplex assay (Panomics). 30 μg of liver homogenates were analyzed in duplicates using procedures recommended by the manufacturer. The expression of target-specific RNA molecules was calculated as the mean value from triplicates and corrected to hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Liver samples were fixed in 3.5% formaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, cut, and stained with H&E. Images were captured using light microscopy (Nikon Eclipse 55i) and evaluated using the ImageJ software (11Wruck C.J. Huppertz B. Bose P. Brandenburg L.O. Pufe T. Kadyrov M. Histopathology. 2009; 55: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). ALT activities in plasma were determined by an automated enzyme assay (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) as described in Ref. 19Streetz K.L. Wustefeld T. Klein C. Kallen K.J. Tronche F. Betz U.A. Schütz G. Manns M.P. Muller W. Trautwein C. Gastroenterology. 2003; 125: 532-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar. Results were compared using a two-tailed paired Student's t test. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. ClustalW was used for multiple sequence alignments. Cross-species conservation of promoter elements is an important functionality indicator. We therefore compared TRE-containing IL-6 promoter regions in humans, mice, rats, and dogs. TRE was embedded in an entire ARE consensus sequence, and this finding was conserved in all selected species (Fig. 1). To investigate the functionality of the ARE consensus sequence within the IL-6 promoter dual luciferase reporter gene assays were performed. In the human IL-6 promoter construct, pIL6-luc651 (17Eickelberg O. Pansky A. Mussmann R. Bihl M. Tamm M. Hildebrand P. Perruchoud A.P. Roth M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12933-12938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), point mutations within the ARE consensus sequence were produced to form an ARE-deficient promoter (pIL6-luc651ΔARE). Previous studies have shown that an over-expression of Nrf2 leads to ARE activation (20Venugopal R. Jaiswal A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 14960-14965Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Therefore, we co-transfected HepG2 cells with various amounts of an Nrf2-expression vector along with pIL6-luc651 and pRL-TK. A dose-dependent activity increase was seen in firefly luciferase but not in Renilla luciferase (internal control). The ratio of firefly and Renilla luciferase activity reached a height by a 4-fold induction compared with control (Fig. 2A). Sulforaphane is known for its Nrf2 activation properties (21McMahon M. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Chanas S.A. Henderson C.J. McLellan L.I. Wolf C.R. Cavin C. Hayes J.D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3299-3307PubMed Google Scholar) and was therefore used as positive control (Fig. 2A). In contrast, Nrf2-expression vector co-transfection with pIL6-luc651ΔARE insufficiently enhanced luciferase activity (Fig. 2B). Stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) demonstrated the intact functionality of TRE within the pIL6-luc651ΔARE vector (Fig. 2B). All experiments were conducted on 96-well plates with n = 8. In vitro and in vivo studies were performed to investigate the effect of common Nrf2 activators on the hepatic expression of IL-6. Fig. 3 demonstrates a characteristic IL-6 ELISA from human HepG2 cells treated with 10 μm methysticin or 2 μm sulforaphane for 16 h. Both Nrf2 activators significantly up-regulated IL-6 secretion to a dimension comparable to that seen after TNF-α treatment (Fig. 3). Subsequent in vivo studies utilizing Nrf2 knock-out and wild-type mice further support the in vitro findings and additionally identify Nrf2 as the transcription factor involved. We performed a Quantigene multiplex assay to detect mRNA coding for IL-6, thioredoxin-1 (Trx1), thioredoxin reductase-1 (Trxrd1), hemoxigenase-1 (Hmox1), NAD(P)H:quinine oxidoreductase-1 (Nqo1), TNF-α, and hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6pd, used as a housekeeping gene). Serving as an internal control, the measured fluorescence values of the genes of interests (GOI) were divided by the corresponding values of the housekeeping gene (HK). As shown in Fig. 4A, IL-6 mRNA was clearly up-regulated in liver homogenates of wild-type mice treated with sulforaphane for 24 h. In contrast, liver homogenates from sulforaphane treated Nrf2 knock-out mice and untreated control IL-6 mRNA were not detectable (Fig. 4A). As expected, the mRNA of the Nrf2 target genes Trx1, Trxrd1, Hmox1, and Nqo1 were up-regulated in sulforaphane-treated wild-type but not in Nrf2 knock-out mice liver. TNF-α mRNA was not detectable in all three groups (Fig. 4A). IL-6 mRNA levels of the mice cohorts were then analyzed for their association with IL-6 secretion. We conducted an IL-6 protein Luminex assay using the same liver homogenates used for the Quantigene multiplex assay. IL-6 protein in liver homogenates from WT control was below the detection limit. As expected, we measured a significant increase of IL-6 protein in the homogenates from sulforaphane-treated mice compared with untreated mice. Nrf2 knock-out mice showed no IL-6 up-regulation in response to sulforaphane treatment (Fig. 4B). It is known that the IL-6 production is elevated in the liver of DDC-treated mice (14Plum W. Tschaharganeh D.F. Kroy D.C. Corsten E. Erschfeld S. Dierssen U. Wasmuth H. Trautwein C. Streetz K.L. Am. J. Pathol. 2010; 176: 2236-2246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To explore if Nrf2 is the transcription factor inducing the IL-6 up-regulation under these conditions we treated Nrf2-knock-out and wild type mice with DDC for 3 weeks. We then determined hepatic expression levels of IL-6 by Luminex technique. IL-6 protein expression was significantly induced about 2.5-fold in DDC-treated wild-type mice (1284 pg of IL-6/ml liver homogenate) compared with untreated wild-type mice (522 pg IL-6/ml liver homogenate). However, DDC treated Nrf2-knock-out mice (264 pg of IL-6/ml liver homogenate) failed to up-regulate IL-6 expression compared with untreated Nrf2-knock-out mice (456 pg of IL-6/ml liver homogenate). There were no significant differences between untreated wild type, and Nrf2-knock-out mice (Fig. 5A). ALT level increased after 3 weeks of DDC feeding in both groups (Fig. 5B) with no significant differences between Nrf2-knock-out and wild-type mice. To better characterize the impact of Nrf2 deletion on liver injury we next performed H&E stainings of liver sections. In Nrf2-knock-out mice significant more necrosis (higher numbers and larger areas) was found 3 weeks after DDC feeding compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 5C). A quantification of necrotic areas showed significant more (and larger) necrotic areas in DDC treated Nrf2-knock-out livers. AREs containing TRE elements mediate high basal transcription of the human NQO1, rat and mouse GST Ya subunit, and rat GST-P and its induction in response to xenobiotics and oxidative stress (5Xie T. Belinsky M. Xu Y. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6894-6900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We found this special promoter element construction in all examined IL-6 promoters (human, mouse, rat, and dog; Fig. 1), thus supporting our hypothesis regarding sequence function. Utilizing promoter studies in a human hepatic cell line with a cloned IL-6 promoter containing either wild-type or mutated ARE sequences, we experimentally confirmed the ARE consensus sequence function within in the IL-6 promoter. The conducted luciferase assays demonstrated that Nrf2 over-expression induced luciferase activity in wild-type but not in ARE-deficient IL-6 promoter vectors (Fig. 2, A and B). These results demonstrate both the functionality of the ARE sequence as well as the role of Nrf2 as a transcription factor involved. Further in vitro studies showed that not only an artificial IL-6 promoter construct but also natural IL-6 promoter react to Nrf2 activation. Stimulation of a human hepatic cell line with the well estabished Nrf2 activators methysticin (18Wruck C.J. Götz M.E. Herdegen T. Varoga D. Brandenburg L.O. Pufe T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 73: 1785-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and sulforaphane (21McMahon M. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Chanas S.A. Henderson C.J. McLellan L.I. Wolf C.R. Cavin C. Hayes J.D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3299-3307PubMed Google Scholar) leads to a significant enhanced IL-6 secretion (Fig. 3). Subsequently, we brought the study forward into an in vivo mouse model. We demonstrated that sulforaphane administration enhanced IL-6 mRNA expression in wild-type but not in Nrf2-knock-out mice liver (Fig. 4A). We also measured mRNAs of known Nrf2 target genes. As suspected, these genes where up-regulated in wild-type mice but not in Nrf2-knock-out mice and verify the assay integrity (Fig. 4A). We then tested whether an increased IL-6 mRNA production results in an up-regulation of IL-6 protein expression. Our experiment demonstrated an increased IL-6 production in WT but not in Nrf2-knock-out mice treated with sulforaphane (Fig. 4B). We next tested IL-6 expression in a mouse model for steatohepatitis where IL-6 is up-regulated and has a well known protective function (14Plum W. Tschaharganeh D.F. Kroy D.C. Corsten E. Erschfeld S. Dierssen U. Wasmuth H. Trautwein C. Streetz K.L. Am. J. Pathol. 2010; 176: 2236-2246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). As expected, the expression of IL-6 was up-regulated in DDC-treated wild-type mice. In contrast, Nrf2-knock-out mice are not able to up-regulate IL-6 expression in response to DDC treatment (Fig. 5A). These findings further documented an Nrf2, and therefore ARE, driven IL-6 production. DDC feeding causes cholestatic liver damage and resembles many aspects of certain human chronic liver diseases like necrosis of hepatocytes and elevated blood ALT levels. As expected, DDC treated Nrf2 knock-out mice showed significantly more and larger necrotic areas as DDC treated wild-type mice (Fig. 5, C and D). Further experiments has to be conducted to clarify to which extent the absence of IL-6 expression leads to this enhanced susceptibility to DDC treatment of the Nrf2-knock-out mice. Albeit the levels of ALT increases in both groups to the same extend (Fig. 5B). We speculated that the Nrf2 knock-out and wild-type mice might have comparable initial liver injury and therefore equivalent ALT levels, but the Nrf2 knock-out mice have insufficient mechanisms for liver regeneration leading to extensive necrotic damage (22Beyer T.A. Xu W. Teupser D. auf dem Keller U. Bugnon P. Hildt E. Thiery J. Kan Y.W. Werner S. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 212-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Because IL-6 is neither an antioxidant nor detoxification enzyme, it is surprising to find an entire ARE-consensus sequence contained in the IL-6 gene. However, several studies have shown that IL-6 is redox-regulated and can maintain a protective function in organs subjected to oxidative stress, yet little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved. Studies regarding possible interactions between IL-6 and Nrf2 are numerous and this research describes one possible relation between Nrf2 and its target gene IL-6. Hepatic IL-6 expression is enhanced in response to oxidative stress, protects the liver against oxidative injury and reverses hepatic steatosis and alcohol-induced liver injury (23Cressman D.E.

As IL-6-deficient mice, Nrf2-knock-out mice are prone to ethanol-induced hepatic apoptosis and steatosis and displayed a dramatically increased mortality associated with liver failure when fed with ethanol (27Lamlé J. Marhenke S. Borlak J. von Wasielewski R. Eriksson C.J. Geffers R. Manns M.P. Yamamoto M. Vogel A. Gastroenterology. 2008; 134: 1159-1168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This similarity in IL-6 and Nrf2 function is also seen in models of hyperoxia-induced lung injury. Both IL-6 and Nrf2 protect pulmonary epithelial cells against oxidative stress (28McGrath-Morrow S.

Several studies have demonstrated a redox-dependent up-regulated IL-6 expression in lung epithelial cells allowing the assumption that Nrf2 may be involved in this process (31Simeonova P.P.

IL-6 is also found in two groups of cytokines: the myokines and adipocytokines, produced in muscle and visceral fat, respectively. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying IL-6 up-regulation in muscle and fat remain limited, it is generally accepted that oxidative stress causes IL-6 dysregulation. The IL-6 elevation in response to muscle contraction is inhibited by supplementation of the potent antioxidants Vitamin C and E (33Fischer C.P. Hiscock N.J. Penkowa M. Basu S. Vessby B. Kallner A.

In obesity, oxidative stress in adipose tissue causes an up-regulation of IL-6 and may contribute to obesity-associated metabolic syndrome (35Higdon J.V. Frei B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Here, IL-6 expression was activated by angiotensin II and inactivated by antioxidants and the ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059, which are both known to block Nrf2-mediated gene expression. Lee et al. (39Lee P.C. Ho I.C. Lee T.C. Toxicol.

Both publications demonstrate oxidative stress induced IL-6 expression in the cardiovascular system and imply the participation of Nrf2. A variety of in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated the neuroprotective properties of IL-6 as well as Nrf2 against oxidative damage. As in Nrf2-knock-out mice, IL-6-deficient mice suffer from increased oxidative stress and neurodegeneration after brain injury (40Li J. Calkins M.J. Johnson D.A. Johnson J.A. Methods Mol.

These findings may link neuronal IL-6 up-regulation to Nrf2 activation. Oxidative stress and a generalized inflammatory state are the main features of preeclampsia. Recently, we described a direct relationship in the etiology of preeclampsia between an Nrf2-mediated fetal defense against oxidative stress and consequent placental toxicity (11Wruck C.J. Huppertz B. Bose P. Brandenburg L.O. Pufe T. Kadyrov M. Histopathology. 2009; 55: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Because IL-6 expression is also elevated in preeclamptic patients (46Bernardi F. Guolo F. Bortolin T. Petronilho F. Dal-Pizzol F. J. Obstet. Gynaecol. Res. 2008; 34: 948-951PubMed Google Scholar), one can assume that excessive Nrf2 activity results in a critically enhanced IL-6 expression. What can be hypothesized about the function of Nrf2 up-regulated IL-6 expression? It is well known that Nrf2 orchestrates the transcription of a battery of antioxidant and detoxifying genes in a variety of cells and organs (10Lee J.M. Li J. Johnson D.A. Stein T.D. Kraft A.D. Calkins M.J. Jakel R.J. Johnson J.A. Faseb J. 2005; 19: 1061-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). However, IL-6 activates the transcription of another category of protective genes such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, FLIP, Ref-1, cyclin D1, and c-Myc, via STAT3 activation (47Taub R. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 978-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). It may therefore be speculated that Nrf2 broadens its protection by interacting with the IL-6/STAT3 pathway. An Nrf2-dependent IL-6 up-regulation is described in the study at hand. In addition to Nrf2, ARE can be bound by various other factors, functioning as both an activator and inhibitor of transcription. Yang et al. (48Yang Y. Ochando J. Yopp A. Bromberg J.S. Ding Y. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 2720-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) reported that only IL-6, rapidly up-regulates c-Maf transcription. Considering that c-Maf homodimers are negative regulators of ARE-driven transcription (49Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5301-5312Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), this may be indicative of a negative feedback loop. However, our present findings are limited to hepatic Nrf2 driven IL-6 expression. They provide a first step in understanding the contribution of the ARE-system in IL-6 expression. Nrf2 may have an important function in the regulation of inflammatory processes and may indicate the possible role of IL-6 in oxidative stress defense.

https://openalex.org/W2069621804,"Studies on a variety of interesting biological problems, ranging from circadian rhythm to cancer cell growth to longevity, have begun to give evidence that the physiological state of cells and tissues reflects both the cell’s regulatory systems and its state of intermediary metabolism. It is appreciated that the regulatory state of a cell or tissue, as driven by transcription factors and signaling pathways, can impose itself upon the dynamics of metabolic state. It follows that the reciprocal must also be the case, that metabolic state will feed back to impose itself on regulatory state. An appreciation and understanding of this reciprocity may be required to crack open problems in biological research that have heretofore been insoluble."

Melo R.C. Jin Z. Dvorak A.M. Weller P.F. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 23Brasaemle D.L. Dolios G. Shapiro L. Wang R. J. Biol.

Biochem. 2006; 139: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Originally, the AUP1 gene was identified as a part of the mnd2 (motor neuron degeneration 2) locus in mouse, mutation of which results in a lethal neuromuscular disorder (27Jang W. Weber J.S. Bashir R. Bushby K. Meisler M.H. Genomics. 1996; 36: 366-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Independently, AUP1 was found as a binding partner of adenoviral proteins (28Karpisheva K.V.

AUP1 was also reported as a cytosolic protein that binds to integrin α subunits and supports inside-out signaling in platelets (30Kato A. Kawamata N. Tamayose K. Egashira M. Miura R. Fujimura T. Murayama K. Oshimi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28934-28941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 31Kato A. Oshimi K. Platelets. 2009; 20: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Very recently, AUP1 was identified as a component of the Sel1l complex at the ER (32Mueller B. Klemm E.J. Spooner E. Claessen J.H. Ploegh H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 12325-12330Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 33Claessen J.H. Mueller B. Spooner E. Pivorunas V.L. Ploegh H.L. J. Biol.

We show that AUP1 is a monotopic membrane protein with both termini facing the cytosol. We demonstrate that AUP1 binds to the E2 conjugase Ube2g2 and recruits it to LDs. Thereby AUP1 provides a molecular link between LDs and ubiquitination.DISCUSSIONWe identified and characterized AUP1 as an LD protein that provides a molecular connection of LDs to the ubiquitination machinery. Although AUP1 is highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed, little is currently known about the protein. In recent years, AUP1 was found in several LD proteomes (22Wan H.C. Melo R.C. Jin Z. Dvorak A.M. Weller P.F. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 23Brasaemle D.L. Dolios G. Shapiro L. Wang R. J. Biol.

Biochem. 2006; 139: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Our subcellular fractionation and microscopic localization data demonstrate that AUP1 is a specific component of LDs in several different cell types. The failure to detect AUP1 localization to LDs in former studies (30Kato A. Kawamata N. Tamayose K. Egashira M. Miura R. Fujimura T. Murayama K. Oshimi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28934-28941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 32Mueller B. Klemm E.J. Spooner E. Claessen J.H. Ploegh H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Tsitologiia. 2002; 44: 846-851PubMed Google Scholar) is likely due to the cell lines used in those studies and their respective metabolic state. Although some cell lines, e.g. HeLa cells, contain only few and small LDs in the absence of oleate supplementation, our standard cell lines, A431 and Huh7, contain easily detectable LDs under normal growth conditions. Because AUP1 can dually localize to LDs and ER membranes, it will be found on ER membranes in the absence of LDs. Similarly, overexpressed AUP1 tends to localize to the ER because the available LD surface cannot cope with large amounts of AUP1 protein, especially in cells with few or small LDs (see AUP1 in COS7 cells under FCS conditions in Fig. 5A). Another reason for the previous failure to detect AUP1 at LDs may be differences in the fixation and permeabilization procedure before microscopy. It was shown (49DiDonato D. Brasaemle D.L. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2003; 51: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 50Ohsaki Y. Maeda T. Fujimoto T. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 124: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) that some LD proteins are not detected on LDs when cells are treated with Triton X-100 for permeabilization.It has been reported previously that LDs are connected to ubiquitination and protein degradation. Some peripheral LD proteins such as adipophilin and perilipin are known to be ubiquitinated and degraded via the proteasome (51Xu G. Sztalryd C. Lu X. Tansey J.T. Gan J. Dorward H. Kimmel A.R.

Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 87-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Whether integral LD proteins such as caveolin, DGAT2, or NSDHL use similar mechanisms is unclear. Recently, the importance of E3 ligases for LD turnover was reported, but further molecular components or mechanistic details are lacking (54Eastman S.W. Yassaee M. Bieniasz P.D. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 184: 881-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Apolipoprotein B accumulates in crescent-shaped structures around LDs in hepatocytes after inhibition of the proteasome or autophagy (7Ohsaki Y. Cheng J. Fujita A. Tokumoto T. Fujimoto T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2674-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 55Fujimoto T. Ohsaki Y. Autophagy. 2006; 2: 299-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), suggesting a role of LDs in degradation of excess apolipoproteins. In support of this function of LDs, a recent study (56Hartman I.Z. Liu P. Zehmer J.K. Luby-Phelps K. Jo Y. Anderson R.G. DeBose-Boyd R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 19288-19298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) demonstrated accumulation of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase around LDs under conditions of impaired proteasomal degradation.AUP1 provides a direct molecular connection of LDs to the ubiquitination machinery by binding and recruiting the E2 conjugase Ube2g2 (Fig. 8). Remarkably, Ube2g2 is the E2 conjugase that plays a central role in the ERAD process. Whether the AUP1-Ube2g2 complexes on LDs participate in an ERAD-like process now has to be addressed by further functional studies. Being specifically concentrated on LDs, AUP1 may participate in the regulation of LDs by linking LD turnover to the proteasomal degradation machinery in a cell. Recent data support this concept of AUP1 activity, because AUP1 was found in a complex with Sel1l, a component of the Hrd1-ligase complex, participating in the dislocation of misfolded glycoproteins on the ER (32Mueller B. Klemm E.J. Spooner E. Claessen J.H. Ploegh H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 12325-12330Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar).The assembly of a functional ubiquitination complex at the LD surface should require the presence of an E3 ligase, in addition to the AUP1-Ube2g2 complex. So far, LD proteome analyses have not revealed a candidate E3 ligase. Ube2g2 and its yeast homologue Ubc7p can assemble pre-formed polyubiquitin chains that are transferred to the substrate protein by its cognate E3 ligases AMFR/gp78 or Hrd1p, respectively (47Bazirgan O.A. Hampton R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12797-12810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 57Li W. Tu D. Brunger A.T. Ye Y.

The formation of polyubiquitin chains on Ube2g2 depends on the G2BR of AMFR/gp78 (59Li W. Tu D. Li L. Wollert T. Ghirlando R. Brunger A.T. Ye Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 3722-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), which turns out to be an allosteric activator of Ube2g2 transfer activity (39Das R. Mariano J. Tsai Y.C. Kalathur R.C. Kostova Z. Li J. Tarasov S.G. McFeeters R.L. Altieri A.S. Ji X. Byrd R.A. Weissman A.M. Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 674-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Although the G2BR of AUP1 may functionally replace the G2BR of AMFR/gp78, there is no RING finger domain on AUP1 that might catalyze the actual ubiquitin chain transfer. The missing E3 may either be an (overlooked) LD protein or a cytoplasmic protein or a component of the ER that closely associates with LDs. Further studies are necessary to elucidate its identity.In summary, we demonstrate that AUP1 is a monotopic membrane protein that localizes to lipid droplets. AUP1 binds the E2-conjugase Ube2g2 via its G2BR domain and recruits it to LDs. Further understanding of AUP1, its control by upstream signaling events, and its role in Ube2g2-dependent ubiquitination will improve our understanding of LD turnover and the role of LDs in protein degradation.

Originally, the AUP1 gene was identified as a part of the mnd2 (motor neuron degeneration 2) locus in mouse, mutation of which results in a lethal neuromuscular disorder (27Jang W. Weber J.S. Bashir R. Bushby K. Meisler M.H. Genomics. 1996; 36: 366-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Independently, AUP1 was found as a binding partner of adenoviral proteins (28Karpisheva K.V.

AUP1 was also reported as a cytosolic protein that binds to integrin α subunits and supports inside-out signaling in platelets (30Kato A. Kawamata N. Tamayose K. Egashira M. Miura R. Fujimura T.

We show that AUP1 is a monotopic membrane protein with both termini facing the cytosol. We demonstrate that AUP1 binds to the E2 conjugase Ube2g2 and recruits it to LDs. Thereby AUP1 provides a molecular link between LDs and ubiquitination."

Diphenylhexatriene anisotropy is a good reporter of global membrane order. The fluorescence lifetimes of trans-parinaric acid are particularly sensitive to the presence and nature of ordered domains, but thus far they have not been measured in yeast cells. A long lifetime typical of the gel phase (>30 ns) was found in wild-type (WT) cells from two different genetic backgrounds, at 24 and 30 °C, providing the first direct evidence for the presence of gel domains in living cells. To understand their nature and location, the study of WT cells was extended to spheroplasts, the isolated plasma membrane, and liposomes from total lipid and plasma membrane lipid extracts (with or without ergosterol extraction by cyclodextrin). It is concluded that the plasma membrane is mostly constituted by ordered domains and that the gel domains found in living cells are predominantly at the plasma membrane and are formed by lipids. To understand their composition, strains with mutations in sphingolipid and ergosterol metabolism and in the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor remodeling pathway were also studied. The results strongly indicate that the gel domains are not ergosterol-enriched lipid rafts; they are mainly composed of sphingolipids, possibly inositol phosphorylceramide, and contain glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins, suggesting an important role in membrane traffic and signaling, and interactions with the cell wall.

For example, during cellular adaptation to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we found that, together with alterations in the plasma membrane permeability to H2O2 (5Sousa-Lopes A.

However, the physiological presence and role of stable domains formed on the sole basis of specific lipid-lipid interactions are still debatable (9Lingwood D. Simons K. Science. 2010; 327: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (3261) Google Scholar). Yeast cells have been used to address important questions regarding membrane microdomain organization and function. In this respect, they exhibit several advantages, such as a much simpler lipidome than mammalian cells and a considerably lower number of genes involved in lipid metabolic pathways (10Goffeau A. Barrell B.G. Bussey H. Davis R.W. Dujon B. Feldmann H. Galibert F. Hoheisel J.D. Jacq C. Johnston M. Louis E.J. Mewes H.W. Murakami Y. Philippsen P. Tettelin H. Oliver S.G.

Two different types of domains, thought to be the equivalent of liquid ordered domains in higher eukaryotes, have been observed in the plasma membrane of S. cerevisiae as follows: membrane domains enriched in sterols called MCC 2The abbreviations used are: MCCmembrane compartment occupied by Can1pMCPmembrane compartment occupied by Pma1pDPH1,6-diphenyl-1,3,6-hexatrienet-PnAtrans-parinaric acidGPIglycosylphosphatidylinositolPOPC1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholineTMAtrimethylammoniumMLVmultilamellar vesicleIPCinositol phosphorylceramide. for “membrane compartments occupied by Can1p” and domains called MCP for “membrane compartments occupied by Pma1p,” which are possibly sphingolipid-rich domains (12Malínská K. Malínský J. Opekarová M. Tanner W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4427-4436Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 13Malinska K. Malinsky J. Opekarova M. Tanner W. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 6031-6041Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Recently, another type of compartment has been proposed (14Berchtold D. Walther T.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 1565-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae is thus highly suited to study the biophysical properties of different membrane compartments. To address that subject, the plasma membrane of S. cerevisiae was labeled with either of the following: 1) 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,6-hexatriene (DPH), one of the most commonly used membrane probes and known to distribute evenly among most membrane domains, thus giving an indication of the average or global order of the lipid bilayer (15de Almeida R.F. Fedorov A. Prieto M. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 2406-2416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar); or 2) trans-parinaric acid (t-PnA), which is one of the few probes that partitions preferentially into ordered domains, where it displays increased fluorescence quantum yield (16Sklar L.A. Hudson B.S. Simoni R.D. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 819-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), thus being especially sensitive to changes in the amount and composition of those ordered domains (17de Almeida R.F. Loura L.M. Prieto M. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2009; 157: 61-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). For both probes, the chromophore is buried in the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer, providing direct information on acyl chain packing. Thus, the results can be interpreted without taking into consideration biophysical complexities on the lipid-water interface/lipid headgroup region or interactions with extra membrane molecules or domains of membrane proteins. The probe t-PnA presents the additional benefit of displaying a long lifetime component in its fluorescence intensity decay that is characteristic of the type of ordered domains being detected, namely gel ordered (if clearly above 30 ns) or liquid ordered (below 30 ns) domains (18Reyes Mateo C.

The results obtained in this study show that the yeast plasma membrane contains a significant fraction of gel-like highly ordered sphingolipid-enriched microdomains, with a composition independent of sterol content, and possibly involving glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins. Those domains cannot be detected by changes in the global order of the membrane, because the latter is inversely related to the abundance of the former.

Yeast lytic enzyme (Arthrobacter luteus) was purchased from ICN Biomedicals (Aurora, OH). t-PnA and DPH were purchased from Invitrogen, and Ludox (colloidal silica diluted to 50 weight % in water) and ergosterol were purchased from Sigma. 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) and phytoceramide from S. cerevisiae (N-octadecanoyl(2S,3S,4R)-2-amino-1,3,4-octadecanetriol) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Organic solvents were analytical grade (lipid extraction) and spectroscopic grade (lipid and probe stock solutions) from Merck. Unless otherwise indicated, S. cerevisiae cells were inoculated at an A600 of 0.15 and cultured in synthetic complete medium (SC) containing 6.8% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base, 2% (w/v) glucose, and the amino acids as indicated in Ref. 6Branco M.R. Marinho H.S. Cyrne L. Antunes F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6501-6506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar. Cells were grown overnight at 30 °C with shaking at 160 rpm and reinoculated into SC medium at an A600 of ∼0.15. After incubation for 5–6 h, cells in exponential phase were harvested at an A600 = 0.6. Harvested cells (WT, erg6Δ, scs7Δ, per1Δ, and erg2Δerg6Δ) were washed twice with sterile water and then suspended in buffer A (100 mm sodium dihydrogenophosphate, 100 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). The probes DPH and t-PnA were added from a concentrated ethanol stock solution to the cells to a final concentration of 2 μm and incubated for 20 and 5 min, respectively, at room temperature (24 °C) or at 30 °C. Harvested cells were washed once with sterile water and washed once with buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). The pellet was then suspended in buffer D to an A600 = 0.5. Hydrolysis was made by adding Yeast Lytic Enzyme (250 μl of a 1.25 mg/ml solution for each 10 ml of culture) to the culture and incubating for 90 min at 35 °C. Cell wall digestion by zymolyase was checked by measuring the decrease of absorbance at 600 nm of cell suspensions. After a centrifugation (5 min at 300 × g), the pellet containing spheroplasts was resuspended with buffer C, and addition of the probes was as described above. S. cerevisiae cells were inoculated at an A600 of 0.075 and were harvested at A600 = 0.3. They were then centrifuged at 7200 × g for 5 min, washed once with 0.4 m sucrose in buffer C (25 mm imidazole HCl, pH 7.0), resuspended in 0.4 m sucrose in buffer C with protease inhibitor PMSF, and lysed by vortexing three times with glass beads for 2 min, alternated with 2 min on ice. Immediately after, lipids were extracted using the Folch method (24Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The isolation of the plasma membrane was carried out according to Ref. 25Panaretou B. Piper P. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 313: 27-32PubMed Google Scholar with some minor modifications (7Pedroso N. Matias A.C. Cyrne L. Antunes F. Borges C. Malhó R. de Almeida R.F. Herrero E. Marinho H.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2009; 46: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (300 A600) were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min and washed once with 0.4 m sucrose in buffer C (25 mm imidazole HCl, pH 7.0). Cells were resuspended in 0.4 m sucrose in buffer C, containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (100 mm PMSF, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.15 mg/ml benzamidine, and 0.1 mg/ml pepstatin), and lysed by vortexing with glass beads. After a low speed centrifugation at 530 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was recovered and centrifuged at 22,000 × g for 30 min to obtain a pellet containing a crude membrane extract. The crude membrane extract was resuspended in 2 ml of buffer C with the protease inhibitor mixture, applied on top of a discontinuous sucrose gradient (constituted by 12 ml of three layers of 2.25, 1.65, and 1.1 m sucrose in buffer C), and centrifuged in a Beckman SW 28 rotor at 22,000 rpm (90,000 × g) for 18 h. Purified plasma membranes were obtained from the interface between the 2.25 and 1.65 m sucrose layers. The pure plasma membranes were resuspended in buffer C and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 40 min. The final pellet was resuspended either in buffer C or in buffer D (buffer C plus glycerol (1:1, v/v)) when stored at −80 °C. Plasma membrane lipids were extracted from purified plasma membranes in buffer C using the Folch method (24Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipid stock solutions were made in chloroform except for phytoceramide, which was dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). Multilamellar vesicles (MLV) of binary and ternary mixtures of POPC with ergosterol and/or phytoceramide or of lipid extracts from plasma membrane fractions and whole cells were prepared in buffer A with either t-PnA or DPH, as described previously (15de Almeida R.F. Fedorov A. Prieto M. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 2406-2416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar, 21Castro B.M. Silva L.C. Fedorov A. de Almeida R.F. Prieto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 22978-22987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Total lipid concentration in MLV suspensions was 0.2 mm in the binary mixtures to avoid incomplete hydration of ceramide and 0.4 mm for the ternary mixtures. The probe/lipid ratio was 1:200 in ergosterol-containing systems to minimize sterol autofluorescence to negligible levels. In the case of ergosterol-containing samples, in all steps of the experimental procedure the solutions and suspensions were bubbled with N2 (g) and at all times the samples were protected from light. The absence of oxidation products of ergosterol was confirmed by inspection of the ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra. The removal of ergosterol through incubation with methyl-β-cyclodextrin followed the procedure described in Ref. 26Lagane B. Gaibelet G. Meilhoc E. Masson J.M. Cézanne L. Lopez A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33197-33200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, with minor modifications. Briefly, the liposome suspensions were incubated with 20 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin for 30 min at room temperature with shaking. They were then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 45 min. The precipitated liposomes were resuspended in buffer A and labeled with t-PnA as described above for untreated liposomes. Fluorescence measurements were carried out on a Horiba Jobin Yvon FL-1057 Tau 3 spectrofluorometer. The experiments were carried out at 24 or 30 °C in a temperature-controlled sample compartment with magnetic stirring. For steady-state measurements, the excitation and emission wavelengths were 358 and 430 nm for DPH and 320 and 404 nm for t-PnA. The steady-state anisotropy (r) was calculated according to Equation 1, r=(IW−G×IVH)/(IW+2G×IVH)(eq.1) in which G is the instrumental correction factor (15de Almeida R.F. Fedorov A. Prieto M. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 2406-2416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Subscripts V and H represent the vertical and horizontal orientations of the polarizers, and the order of the subscripts corresponds to the excitation and emission. An adequate blank was subtracted from each intensity reading. For time-resolved measurements by the single photon counting technique, nanoLED N-320 (Horiba Jobin Yvon) was used for the excitation of t-PnA, and emission wavelength was 404 nm. Ludox was used as the scatterer to obtain the instrumental response function. The program TRFA data processor version 1.4 (Minsk, Belarus) was used for the analysis of the experimental fluorescence decays. A global analysis method was applied to completely separate probe emission from the autofluorescence of the cells. The decays were analyzed by fitting a sum of exponentials as shown in Equation 2, I(t)=∑i=1nαiexp(−t/τi)(eq.2) where αi and τi are the normalized amplitude and lifetime of component i, respectively. The mean fluorescence lifetime was obtained through Equation 3, 〈τ〉=Σαiτi2/Σαiτi(eq.3) The quality of fit was judged by a reduced χ2 value close to 1 and random distribution of weighted residuals and residuals autocorrelation (see supplemental Fig. S1, A and B for examples). Labeling and fluorescence measurements did not affect cell viability determined using trypan blue (data not shown). The readings of DPH fluorescence anisotropy were stable at least 5–20 min after probe addition (data not shown). The plasma membrane of S. cerevisiae WT cells was labeled with t-PnA, and the fluorescence decay of the probe was obtained. As can be seen in Fig. 1A, a long lifetime component of 41 ns was present (see also supplemental Fig. S1A). This long component is a fingerprint of a gel phase, i.e. a solid ordered phase. This gel lipid phase is not commonly found in living cells, especially eukaryotic cells, under physiological conditions (27Welti R. Rintoul D.A. Goodsaid-Zalduondo F. Felder S. Silbert D.F. J. Biol.

Although the amplitude of this lifetime component was small (Fig. 1B), the contribution to the total fluorescence intensity decay was very significant, due to the long lifetime value, and the average fluorescence lifetime was also among the highest found in cells labeled with t-PnA (Fig. 1C). To confirm that the long component was due to the probe being stably incorporated in the plasma membrane, the fluorescence decay of t-PnA labeling WT cells was obtained for different incubation times (2, 5, and 15 min). Although a very small decrease of the mean fluorescence lifetime could be noted (supplemental Fig. S2A), no significant differences were found in the long component lifetime (supplemental Fig. S2C). At short incubation times, the probe was still incorporating in the plasma membrane, as shown by the time-dependent steady-state fluorescence intensity (supplemental Fig. S2B), which reached a plateau at ∼5–10 min after probe addition. This is the minimum incorporation time found for single bilayer systems, such as unilamellar liposomes or platelets (23Mateo C.R. Lillo M.P. González-Rodríguez J. Acuña A.U. Eur. Biophys. J. 1991; 20: 41-52PubMed Google Scholar, 31de Almeida R.F. Loura L.M. Fedorov A. Prieto M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 1109-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Thus, the presence of the long lifetime component of t-PnA at short incubation times (supplemental Fig. S2C) indicates that this long lifetime reflects a property of the plasma membrane and not of intracellular membranes or structures (see also text accompanying supplemental Fig. S2). To rule out any temperature effect, controls were also performed where all the procedures and measurements were carried out at 30 °C, and the results are shown in supplemental Fig. S3. The long component is still present (supplemental Fig. S3, panel A), and is slightly shorter (37 ns) than at 24 °C. This was expected because, for a solid ordered domain, the maximum degree of order or rigidity of the lipid bilayer decreases with temperature. However, the amplitude (supplemental Fig. S3, panel B) is the same at both temperatures, i.e. the relative abundance of the domains remains the same at 24 and 30 °C. However, fast redistribution of probe through intracellular membranes accompanied by continued incorporation of probe in the plasma membrane could not be ruled out. Thus, the plasma membrane fraction from WT cells was isolated, and the fluorescence properties of t-PnA labeling these membranes were characterized. It was previously shown that in mammalian (Chinese hamster ovary) cells the plasma membrane isolated by ultracentrifugation retains to a very significant extent the domain organization of the plasma membrane in intact cells (32Scolari S. Engel S. Krebs N. Plazzo A.P. De Almeida R.F. Prieto M. Veit M. Herrmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 15708-15716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 1A, the long lifetime component is present in the plasma membrane fraction of WT cells and thus it can be safely assigned to plasma membrane domains. The lifetime is slightly longer than in the plasma membrane of living cells, which may be due to the fact that these are much more dynamic than the isolated plasma membrane fraction. In contrast, the amplitude of the long component (Fig. 1B) and mean lifetime (Fig. 1C) of t-PnA in the isolated plasma membrane are much higher than in intact cells, suggesting that the shorter components are due to t-PnA incorporated in intracellular membranes, as will be discussed below. Notwithstanding, the fact that the long component was found in an intact cell, with a thick and rigid cell wall, could raise the question of an artifact due to the presence of that cellular structure. This was ruled out by the presence of the same t-PnA fluorescence lifetime component of 41 ns in spheroplasts, i.e. WT cells where the cell wall was removed (Fig. 1A). Finally, to test if yeast lipids alone are able to form sufficiently rigid domains to yield a fluorescence lifetime component of t-PnA longer than 30 ns, total lipid extracts were obtained from WT cells and reconstituted into liposomes, and these were labeled with t-PnA. The fluorescence properties of the probe in those liposomes were determined (Fig. 1A). As can be clearly seen, the long component of the fluorescence decay was still present, and in fact, it was even longer (∼48 ns) than the one obtained in the plasma membrane of intact cells. Thus, yeast lipids in the absence of proteins have the ability to form domains that are even more rigid. The higher rigidity observed in the lipid extracts could also be due to a reorganization of the lipids upon mixing of intracellular and plasma membrane lipids. To test if this was the case, lipid extracts were also prepared from the isolated plasma membrane, reconstituted into liposomes, and labeled with t-PnA. The long lifetime component was again detected (Fig. 1A), and the value was identical to the one measured in total lipid extracts. This identity reinforces the following: 1) the plasma membrane lipids are the ones responsible for the formation of the very ordered domains, and 2) the presence of proteins somehow limits the rigidity/compactness of those domains (see supplemental text on the relation between the value of the long lifetime component and rigidity of the environment of the fluorescent probe). The yeast plasma membrane had never been studied with t-PnA, and a priori, the properties of sterol-enriched domains, known as lipid rafts, could be different in yeast and in mammalian plasma membrane. Therefore, it was also hypothesized that the long fluorescence lifetime could be due to incorporation of the probe into ergosterol-enriched ordered domains. However, the 41-ns component was also present in t-PnA fluorescence decay when the probe was labeling the plasma membrane of erg6Δ cells (Fig. 2A), which have deficient lipid rafts (33Bagnat M. Keränen S. Shevchenko A. Shevchenko A. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 3254-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). These cells synthesize zymosterol and cholesta-5,7,24-trienol instead of ergosterol (see supplemental Table S1). It is thus concluded that gel-like domains are present in the plasma membrane of WT cells and spheroplasts and of erg6Δ cells. Moreover, they should have similar compositions because their rigidity is the same, as explained in the supplemental text. erg6Δ cells, unlike WT cells, do not possess one major sterol. Therefore, experiments were also carried out with erg2Δerg6Δ cells, which accumulate only the non-raft-promoting zymosterol (see also supplemental Table S1) (34Heiderpriem R.W. Livant P.D. Parish E.J. Barbuch R.J. Broaddus M.G. Bard M. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 741-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Because these mutant cells were obtained from a different genetic background than the BY4741 cells, the corresponding WT cells (RH3435) were also analyzed. A long lifetime component of 42 ns was detected in RH3435 cells, which is not significantly different from the one found in the BY4741 WT strain (Fig. 2A). The amplitude and mean fluorescence lifetime were also identical in both WT strains (Fig. 2, B and C). This result shows that the very ordered domains detected by t-PnA are not specific of one genetic background but are a general feature in the organization of S. cerevisiae plasma membrane. Regarding erg2Δerg6Δ cells, a long lifetime component (>30 ns) in t-PnA fluorescence decay was also detected (Fig. 2A). Because erg2Δerg6Δ cells have no sterols with ordering effect, the ordered domains have to be formed by other classes of lipids and should not correspond to a liquid ordered phase. It should be noted that while in erg6Δ cells, the sphingolipid composition remains very similar to WT cells, and in erg2Δerg6Δ cells, in addition to a very different sterol profile, there are profound changes in sphingolipid composition (supplemental Table S2). If the domains detected by the long component of t-PnA are sterol-depleted, they should be mainly composed by sphingolipids, because these are the other membrane lipids usually associated with membrane ordered domains. Therefore, a major change in sphingolipid composition should lead to an alteration in the value of t-PnA long lifetime component. Thus, scs7Δ cells, which lack α-hydroxylation of sphing"

We examined the role of microRNAs in mediating the effects of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), which suppresses the proliferation of estrogen receptor-positive (ERα(+)) breast carcinoma cells, such as MCF-7, but not estrogen receptor-negative cells, such as MDA-MB-231. We found that pro-oncogenic miR-21 is selectively induced by ATRA in ERα(+) cells. Induction of miR-21 counteracts the anti-proliferative action of ATRA but has the potentially beneficial effect of reducing cell motility. In ERα(+) cells, retinoid-dependent induction of miR-21 is due to increased transcription of the MIR21 gene via ligand-dependent activation of the nuclear retinoid receptor, RARα. RARα is part of the transcription complex present in the 5'-flanking region of the MIR21 gene. The receptor binds to two functional retinoic acid-responsive elements mapping upstream of the transcription initiation site. Silencing of miR-21 enhances ATRA-dependent growth inhibition and senescence while reverting suppression of cell motility afforded by the retinoid. Up-regulation of miR-21 results in retinoid-dependent inhibition of the established target, maspin. Knockdown and overexpression of maspin in MCF-7 cells indicates that the protein is involved in ATRA-induced growth inhibition and contributes to the ATRA-dependent anti-motility responses. Integration between whole genome analysis of genes differentially regulated by ATRA in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, prediction of miR-21 regulated genes, and functional studies led to the identification of three novel direct miR-21 targets: the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL1B, the adhesion molecule ICAM-1 and PLAT, the tissue-type plasminogen activator. Evidence for ICAM-1 involvement in retinoid-dependent inhibition of MCF-7 cell motility is provided."
https://openalex.org/W1991925601,"Extracellular heat shock protein HSP90α was reported to participate in tumor cell growth, invasion, and metastasis formation through poorly understood signaling pathways. Herein, we show that extracellular HSP90α favors cell migration of glioblastoma U87 cells. More specifically, externally applied HSP90α rapidly induced endocytosis of EGFR. This response was accompanied by a transient increase in cytosolic Ca2+ appearing after 1–3 min of treatment. In the presence of EGF, U87 cells showed HSP90α-induced Ca2+ oscillations, which were reduced by the ATP/ADPase, apyrase, and inhibited by the purinergic P2 inhibitor, suramin, suggesting that ATP release is requested. Disruption of lipid rafts with methyl β-cyclodextrin impaired the Ca2+ rise induced by extracellular HSP90α combined with EGF. Specific inhibition of TLR4 expression by blocking antibodies suppressed extracellular HSP90α-induced Ca2+ signaling and the associated cell migration. HSPs are known to bind lipopolysaccharides (LPSs). Preincubating cells with Polymyxin B, a potent LPS inhibitor, partially abrogated the effects of HSP90α without affecting Ca2+ oscillations observed with EGF. Extracellular HSP90α induced EGFR phosphorylation at Tyr-1068, and this event was prevented by both the protein kinase Cδ inhibitor, rottlerin, and the c-Src inhibitor, PP2. Altogether, our results suggest that extracellular HSP90α transactivates EGFR/ErbB1 through TLR4 and a PKCδ/c-Src pathway, which induces ATP release and cytosolic Ca2+ increase and finally favors cell migration. This mechanism could account for the deleterious effects of HSPs on high grade glioma when released into the tumor cell microenvironment.

Cell surface HSP90α interacts specifically with the extracellular domain of HER-2 (also known as ErbB2), a ligand-less receptor, forming heterodimers with ligand-bound members ErbB1 (EGFR), ErbB3, and ErbB4.

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of extracellular HSP90α in signaling events triggered by EGFR in the human astrocytoma cell line (U87). We show that exogenously applied HSP90α mediates a cross communication between TLR4 and EGFR and accelerates cell migration. Human astrocytoma cell line (U87-MG; European Collection of Cell Cultures, Sigma-Aldrich) was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (Lonza) (5% CO2; 37 °C). Cells were incubated 12–24 h in serum-free culture medium before use. Rabbit polyclonal anti-HSP90α and anti-HSP70 antibodies were purchased from Affinity Bioreagents. Human recombinant HSP90α protein was from StressGen (assay designs) and from BPS Bioscience. Neutralizing anti-TLR4, mouse monoclonal anti-TLR4, and rat monoclonal anti-EGFR (ErB1) antibodies were from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Rabbit monoclonal anti-P-EGFR (Tyr-1068) and antibodies to phospho- and total SAPK/JNK (Tyr-183/185), NFκB p65 (Ser-536), IRF-3 (Ser-396), Akt (Ser-473), and p44/p42 MAPK (Thr-202/204) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Goat polyclonal clathrin-HC-FITC and mouse monoclonal caveolin-1-FITC were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The antibody to proHB-EGF was purchased from R&D Systems Inc. Human recombinant EGF, LPSs from Escherichia coli, fura-2-acetometoxymethyl ester (fura-2/AM), Alexa Fluor dye conjugates, phalloidin, and secondary antibodies were from Molecular Probes. Human TLR4 shRNA, EGFR (ErbB1), and control lentiviral particles purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. HER2 (ErbB2) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Gefitinib) was provided by AstraZeneca. The phospholipase C inhibitor (U73122), the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor (bisindolylmaleimide), the specific PKCδ inhibitor (rottlerin), the c-Src kinase-specific inhibitor (4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine, PP2) and its inactive isomer (4-amino-7-phenylpyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine, PP3), EGFR (ErbB1) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (tyrphostin AG1478), galardin (GM6001), diphtheria toxin mutant (CRM197), and specific inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPases (thapsigargin (TSG)) were purchased from Calbiochem. The IκBα/NFκB-p65 phosphorylation inhibitor, (E)-3-[4-methyl-phenylsulfonyl]-2-proprenenitrile (BAY11-7082), was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. EGF was used at a unique dose of 10 ng/ml. To rule out the possible implication of HER2 in EGF-induced cell responses, 5 μm gefitinib was added. For cholesterol depletion, cells were incubated for 30–60 min at 37 °C in serum-free medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 7.5 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD), a mixture known to reduce plasma membrane cholesterol levels with no cell death (21Barabé F.

Cells were preincubated with Polymyxin B, a potent LPS inhibitor (10 μm; 30–60 min), to avoid bacterial contamination of HSP90α before activation. An additional control was to boil HSP90α at 100 °C for 1 h to suppress the specific effect of HSP90α because LPSs are resistant to heat inactivation but not HSPs (22Asea A. Rehli M. Kabingu E.

Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were incubated with the primary antibody for 2 h and then secondary antibody (F(ab′)2 fragment of IgG) conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 nm or 568 nm (1:500) or with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated phalloidin for 30 min. Substituting the primary antibody with preimmune serum demonstrates specificity of labeling. Counterstaining of nuclei was made using 40,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; 3 μg/ml, 1–3 min). Images were collected on Axioplan 2 microscope using Axiovision Viewer 3 software (Zeiss). The intensity of labeled area (10 μm2) was measured with ImageJ analysis software. In some experiments, imaging was performed with a Leica SP2 RS confocal microscope, and Z-series of optical sections taken from 0.4-μm intervals were collected using the scanning format 1024 × 1024 pixels. Flow cytometry was carried out using the LSRII and FlowJO software. Briefly, cells were washed twice with PBS containing 1% BSA and stained with primary antibodies (1:200 to 1:100, 1 h at 4 °C) and then with Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1000; 30 min at 4 °C; Molecular Probes). Changes in Fura-2 fluorescence were used to measure [Ca2+]i. Briefly, confluent cells were incubated with 2 μm fura-2-acetometoxymethyl ester in culture medium (40 min at 37 °C) and then in HEPES-buffered saline solution containing in mm: 120 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 0.8 MgCl2, 10 glucose, and 20 HEPES, pH 7.4. In nominally Ca2+-free conditions, no CaCl2 addition was made. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or ethanol, used to dissolve drug, was added in other solutions. Measurements were made on an inverted microscope (Nikon TS100) equipped with a 20× objective (Nikon S Fluor, 0.75 NA) attached to a dual-excitation spectrofluorometer with excitation wavelengths alternating between 340 and 380 nm. Emission fluorescence (510 nm) was collected at a rate of 20/min. The 340/380 nm ratio was determined for each cell, and average values were reported as a function of time. Cells were exposed to HSP90α and/or EGF, and then the supernatants were collected to assess the amount of ATP release with luciferin-based ENLITEN ATP assay (Promega) at various time periods. Briefly, 100 μl of luciferin-luciferase solution were added to supernatants, and light emission was recorded with a FLUOstar luminometer (BMG LABTECH). We calibrated light emission by using standard samples furnished by the manufacturer. Cells were incubated with 200 μg/ml anti-HSP90 for various time periods from 5 min to 2 h and then washed and fixed in paraformaldehyde. To detect possible internalization of anti-HSP90 antibody, permeabilized cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody. For endocytosis analysis, cells were incubated 15 min in HEPES-buffered saline solution with CaCl2 before experiment. The control solution containing 5 μm BSA-Alexa Fluor 568 was applied 15 min to attest the absence of nonspecific endocytosis. EGF-BSA-Alexa Fluor 488 or BSA-Alexa Fluor 568 (1:20) were applied for 15 min (about 20 nm EGF) with or without HSP90α. Cells were post-fixed and mounted on slides to be analyzed. Cell monolayers were washed five times with ice-cold PBS and lysed (45 min on ice) using 1 ml of lysis buffer containing: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaF, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cells were scraped and centrifuged, and lysates were collected. Proteins were boiled for 5 min in 2 μl of SDS buffer, fractionated using 8% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked for 1 h with 5% BSA in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (0.1%) (TBS-T) and incubated overnight with antibodies. For EGFR phosphorylation, proteins (20–60 μg/lane) were immunoblotted with anti-P-EGFR (1:50) and revealed with ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Membrane was stripped and reprobed with antibody against EGFR to evaluate the total amount of EGFR. A 1-mm-wide cell-free area was generated by gently scratching the cell monolayer with a sterile yellow Gilson pipette tip. The recording DMEM containing drugs or specific antibodies was applied (5% CO2 in air at 37 °C). Migration of astrocytes within the gap was monitored at given time intervals, using a Zeiss microscope equipped with a video camera. The extent of healing was defined as the ratio of denuded areas of the original wound and the wound after 11–22 h. Serum-starved U87 cells cultured in the presence or absence of agents were exposed to bromodeoxyuridine at a concentration of 3 mm for 1 h. Cells were subsequently rinsed and fixed in 70% ethanol overnight, then washed and reincubated for another 10 min in 2 m HCl containing 0.1% Triton X-100 followed by a 20-min incubation in 0.1 m sodium borate. Cells were processed for immunofluorescence using an anti-bromodeoxyuridine antibody (Dako) and an appropriate Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody. One-way analysis of variance (Statview Software) was used to compare data groups. p values < 0.05 were significant. Immunofluorescence analyses detected the HSP90α isoform at the cell surface of glioblastoma U87 cells (Fig. 1A). HSP90α isoform was mainly expressed at the front edge of migration of cells. The extracellular localization of HSP90α was confirmed by flow cytometry. In contrast, no HSP70 was detected at the cell surface (Fig. 1A, right panel). To analyze the cellular basis for the invasive effect of extracellular HSP90α, we used a wound healing assay. The addition of recombinant HSP90α protein to serum-free medium enhanced cell invasion in a dose-dependent manner (i.e. in the range from 60 ng/ml to 6 μg/ml). This resulted in higher rates of gap closure observed as early as the first hour of cell incubation and confirmed in the following hours, 6 and 12 h (Fig. 1B). It is worthy to note that the effect of HSP90α is directed more toward cell migration than toward cell proliferation because a lower percentage of bromodeoxyuridine incorporation was observed (Fig. 1B, table). For instance, cell proliferation and invasion were respectively increased by 5 ± 1 and 15 ± 2% from control values following 6 h of cell exposure to 6 μg/ml HSP90α. Such an increase in cell migration was also observed with 10 ng/ml EGF and amplified by the combination of the two molecules (Fig. 1C). An additive effect of the activation of cell invasion was observed when both agents were added together into the cell bath medium. These results suggested that extracellular HSP90α exerted an additive effect on the ability of EGF to promote U87 cell migration. To determine the role of Ca2+ store in U87 response to HSP90α, we measured [Ca2+]i, in the presence and absence of extracellular calcium, in fura-2-loaded cells. Recombinant HSP90α induced a transient increase in [Ca2+]i within 1–3 min (Fig. 2A, left panel), whereas EGF induced a more sustained biphasic calcium response with a rapid peak followed by a plateau phase (Fig. 2A, right panel). In a few experiments, the agonist was applied in the absence of external Ca2+ to reveal release from internal stores. Then, Ca2+ was restored extracellularly to reveal increase in plasma membrane Ca2+ permeability (Fig. 2B). A subsequent application of 2 μm TSG was made at the end of some recordings to estimate the Ca2+ content of intracellular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) pools. In nominally Ca2+-free conditions, 6 μg/ml HSP90α induced a transient Ca2+ release from intracellular pools (Fig. 2B, left panel). The addition of Ca2+ to the bath medium did not induce a significant increase in [Ca2+]i, whereas TSG drastically increased [Ca2+]i in the absence of external Ca2+, demonstrating that HSP90α did not deplete completely internal stores. In Ca2+-free conditions, the amplitude of Ca2+ peak induced by EGF remained unchanged, but the duration of the plateau phase was decreased, and Ca2+ readdition to the bath medium resulted in a transient Ca2+ influx through plasma membrane channels due to capacitative Ca2+ entry (Fig. 2B, right panel). Upon stimulation with EGF, the cells showed calcium oscillations in response to HSP90α (i.e. with a frequency of three spikes per 5 min; 98%, n = 50), which were rapidly abolished by the removal of HSP90α (Fig. 2C) or the addition of the EGFR/ErbB1 inhibitor Tyrphostin (AG1478), whereas the addition of ErbB2 inhibitor Gefitinib had no effect (supplemental Fig. S2). These results suggested that HSP90α could promote calcium oscillation through EGFR/ErbB1. To determine whether the calcium oscillatory process elicited by HSP90α and EGF may involve the release of ATP/ADP and their interaction with purinergic (P2) receptors (25Bryant J.A. Finn R.S. Slamon D.J. Cloughesy T.F. Charles A.C. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2004; 3: 1243-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 26Bowser D.N. Khakh B.S. J Gen. Physiol. 2007; 129: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), we pretreated U87 cells with the P2 receptor antagonist suramin (10 μm for 10 min) and the extracellular ATP scavenger apyrase (40 units/ml for 10 min). Both compounds drastically attenuated Ca2+ oscillations generated by exogenously added EGF plus HSP90α (Fig. 2C, right panel). To assess the effect of HSP90α and EGF on the subsequent ATP release, cells were exposed to these agents for various periods of time (from 15 min to 1, 6, and 12 h), and supernatants were collected to evaluate amounts of ATP by bioluminescence assay (Fig. 2D). Clearly no significant release of ATP could be detected in the absence or presence of HSP90α. In contrast, HSP90α plus EGF released ATP from U87 cells to a higher extent than did EGF alone within the first 15–30 min of cell stimulation. Altogether, EGF triggers Ca2+ oscillations that are amplified by extracellular HSP90α through release of ATP acting on purinergic P2 receptors. Cell exposure to HSP90α for 15 min markedly reduced EGFR surface expression (Fig. 3A). U87 cells were incubated in the presence of BSA-Alexa Fluor 568, a membrane-impermeable macromolecule, before adding HSP90α for 15 min and then staining permeabilized cells. Green EGFR was identified at the cell periphery and in the juxtanuclear region (Fig. 3B). In HSP90α-stimulated cells, BSA co-localized with EGFR in the juxtanuclear region, suggesting a rapid internalization (Fig. 3B). Pretreatment with MβCD to deplete cholesterol and disrupt lipid raft organization prevented the calcium response to HSP90α in the absence or presence of EGF, suggesting that lipid raft integrity may be essential for HSP90α-induced Ca2+ signaling (Fig. 3C). Cell exposure to HSP90α did not change significantly the level of ErbB1 versus total EGFR proteins (not shown). Both EGF and HSP90α induced EGFR phosphorylation at Tyr-1068 within 15 min, which was attenuated by cell pretreatment with the PKCδ inhibitor, rottlerin (Fig. 4A). Because PKC isozymes do not directly phosphorylate proteins at tyrosine residues, we examined the role of c-Src as an intermediate kinase between PKC and EGFR (supplemental Fig. S3). We found that the c-Src inhibitor PP2 inhibited HSP90α-induced EGFR phosphorylation, whereas its inactive form (PP3) did not. Because this EGFR transactivation was attenuated by the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor (GM6001) and the heparin-binding (HB)-EGF inhibitor (CRM197; see supplemental Fig. S4), MMP activation and proHB-EGF shedding slightly contribute to this process. Thus, HSP90α interacts with PKCδ, which in turn phosphorylates Src to activate EGFR.FIGURE 4Tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR and partial co-localization of TLR4 and EGFR in glioblastoma cells. A, extracellular HSP90α induces EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation. U87 cells were unstimulated (control (Cont.)) or stimulated with EGF or HSP90α and 1 μg/ml LPS for 15 min; EGFR phosphorylation at Tyr-1068 was analyzed by Western blot. In a few cases, U87 cells were pretreated for 60 min with the PKCδ inhibitor, rottlerin (10 μm). The membrane was stripped and reprobed for total ErbB1 subtype.

As observed for HSP90α, the bacterial LPS (1 μg/ml), a representative TLR4 ligand, also induced EGFR phosphorylation at Tyr-1068 within 15 min (Fig. 4A). Flow cytometry analysis indicated that TLR4 was expressed, whereas TLR2 could not be detected at the cell surface of U87 cells (Fig. 4B). No significant cell expression of TLR2 was shown (supplemental Fig. S5). Following external application of HSP90α, TLR4 totally disappeared at the cell surface within 15 min. Cell surface expression of EGFR was also significantly reduced on U87 cells treated with LPS. Confocal microscopy observations revealed distinct patterns of cell expression, i.e. EGFR was mainly located at the cell periphery, whereas TLR4 was found throughout the cell (Fig. 4C). However, the two receptors co-localized on the plasma membrane and concentrated in pseudopodia (or filopodia). Upon cell stimulation with HSP90α, EGFR was redistributed from the cell membrane to the juxtanuclear region where it co-localized with a small pool of internalized TLR4 (Fig. 4C). (Internalized EGFR by HSP90α is not targeted for degradation; see supplemental Fig. S7.) To determine the downstream signaling events of both TLR4 and EGFR activation, cells were incubated with 6 μg/ml HSP90α for 0, 5, 10, 30, 60, and 320 min (Fig. 4D). Phosphorylated and total AKT, p44/42 MAPK, SAPK/JNK, NFκB p65, and IRF-3 were examined by Western blot analysis. The AKT phosphorylation was induced within 5–10 min and then decreased progressively with time. The phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK observed within 5 min reached a peak at 10 min and then returned to basal level by 6 h. The phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK also occurred rapidly within 5 min and followed a similar time course as AKT but to a lesser extent. The transcription factors, NFκB p65 and IRF-3, related to TLR4 activation, were phosphorylated within the first 10 min of HSP90α application and maintained for at least 6 h.

https://openalex.org/W2005617754,"In skeletal muscle cells, the PC4 (Tis7/Ifrd1) protein is known to function as a coactivator of MyoD by promoting the transcriptional activity of myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C). In this study, we show that up-regulation of PC4 in vivo in adult muscle significantly potentiates injury-induced regeneration by enhancing myogenesis. Conversely, we observe that PC4 silencing in myoblasts causes delayed exit from the cell cycle, accompanied by delayed differentiation, and we show that such an effect is MyoD-dependent. We provide evidence revealing a novel mechanism underlying the promyogenic actions of PC4, by which PC4 functions as a negative regulator of NF-κB, known to inhibit MyoD expression post-transcriptionally. In fact, up-regulation of PC4 in primary myoblasts induces the deacetylation, and hence the inactivation and nuclear export of NF-κB p65, in concomitance with induction of MyoD expression. On the contrary, PC4 silencing in myoblasts induces the acetylation and nuclear import of p65, in parallel with a decrease of MyoD levels. We also observe that PC4 potentiates the inhibition of NF-κB transcriptional activity mediated by histone deacetylases and that PC4 is able to form trimolecular complexes with p65 and HDAC3. This suggests that PC4 stimulates deacetylation of p65 by favoring the recruitment of HDAC3 to p65. As a whole, these results indicate that PC4 plays a role in muscle differentiation by controlling the MyoD pathway through multiple mechanisms, and as such, it positively regulates regenerative myogenesis.

Skeletal myoblast differentiation is a multistep process characterized by permanent exit from the cell cycle, maturation into mononucleated myocytes, and fusion in multinucleated myotubes. This differentiation program is controlled by the basic helix-loop-helix family of myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs), 4The abbreviations used are: MRFmyogenic regulatory factorGMgrowth mediumDMdifferentiation mediumntnucleotidertTAreverse tetracycline-regulated TransActivatorCTcontrolTGtransgenePpostnatal dayTAtibialis anteriorTRITCtetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanateTREtetracycline-responsive elementHDAChistone deacetylaseMCKmuscle creatine kinase. including MyoD, Myf-5, myogenin, and MRF4/Myf6/Herculin (Refs. 1Braun T.

The MRFs form heterodimers with the ubiquitously expressed basic helix-loop-helix E proteins to bind to a consensus sequence, termed E-box, present in the regulatory regions of many muscle-specific genes (8Lassar A.B.

Activation of muscle gene expression by MRFs is also dependent on their functional interaction with members of the myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) family of transcription factors, which bind to a conserved A/T-rich sequence often located in close proximity to E-boxes in muscle gene control regions (9Naya F.J.

The gene PC4, also known as Tis7 or IFRD1 (in rat, mouse, and human, respectively), participates to the process of skeletal muscle cell differentiation. In fact, inhibition of PC4 function in C2C12 myoblasts, by antisense PC4 cDNA transfection or microinjection of anti-PC4 antibodies, prevents their morphological and biochemical differentiation (11Guardavaccaro D. Ciotti M.T. Schäfer B.W. Montagnoli A. Tirone F. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 159-169PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a role for PC4 in muscle differentiation has been observed also in vivo. Muscles from mice lacking Tis7 display decreased protein and mRNA levels of MyoD, myogenin, and laminin-alfa2 (12Vadivelu S.K. Kurzbauer R. Dieplinger B. Zweyer M. Schafer R. Wernig A. Vietor I. Huber L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3514-3525Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Remarkably, it was observed that myofibers of Tis7 null 24-month-old mice were reduced in diameter and number and that after muscle crash damage in young mice there was a delay in regeneration, as defined by an alteration of the isometric contractile properties of skeletal muscle. The misregulation of key regulatory proteins and the reduced regeneration occurring in adult muscles of Tis7 null mice suggest that Tis7 plays an important role in the differentiation of adult muscle stem cells. However, no indication about the underlying molecular mechanism(s) was obtained from the knock-out experiments. In this regard, we have recently found that PC4 (as we refer to both the mouse and rat gene) cooperates with MyoD at inducing the transcriptional activity of MEF2C by counteracting the inhibition exerted by histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) on MEF2C. This relies on the ability of PC4 to bind selectively MEF2C, thus inhibiting its interaction with HDAC4 (13Micheli L. Leonardi L. Conti F. Buanne P. Canu N. Caruso M. Tirone F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2242-2259Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Therefore, PC4 appears to act as a positive cofactor of MyoD (13Micheli L. Leonardi L. Conti F. Buanne P. Canu N. Caruso M. Tirone F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2242-2259Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). MyoD knock-out mice models indicate a unique requirement of MyoD during adult muscle regeneration, rather than during embryonic muscle development, where other myogenic regulatory factors can compensate (14Megeney L.A. Kablar B. Garrett K. Anderson J.E. Rudnicki M.A. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1173-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Remarkably, PC4 is expressed in vivo in adult skeletal muscle, although it is barely detectable during embryonic development (15Buanne P. Incerti B. Guardavaccaro D. Avvantaggiato V. Simeone A. Tirone F. Genomics. 1998; 51: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), which suggests a prevalent role for PC4 in MyoD-dependent post-developmental myogenesis. However, an important question still unanswered is whether PC4 plays an active part in vivo as inducer of adult muscle regeneration. A second question is whether the ability of PC4 to coactivate MyoD is at the origin of the role played by PC4 in myoblast differentiation or if other mechanisms are involved. To answer these questions, we analyzed the muscle regeneration potential of a mouse model where PC4 was up-regulated in skeletal muscle, as well as the differentiation process of myoblasts deprived of PC4 expression through RNA interference. We observed that up-regulation of PC4 in vivo potentiated injury-induced muscle regeneration and that deprivation of PC4 in myoblasts led to down-regulation of MyoD expression, which was responsible for delayed exit from the cell cycle and impairment of terminal differentiation. Furthermore, our data reveal a novel mechanism underlying the promyogenic activity of PC4; in fact, we found that PC4 acts as a repressor of NF-κB transcriptional activity, which is known to inhibit MyoD mRNA accumulation. We also found that PC4 represses the activity of NF-κB by enhancing the HDAC-mediated deacetylation of the p65 subunit. Our results indicate that PC4 can influence muscle regeneration acting as a pivotal regulator of the MyoD pathway through multiple mechanisms. The TRE-PC4 construct (pUHD10-3-PC4) was generated by subcloning the PC4 (rat sequence) open reading frame (ORF; 1.38 kb (16Tirone F. Shooter E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1989; 86: 2088-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar)) into the EcoRI site of pUHD10-3 (17Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4245) Google Scholar). The 2.3-kb transgene (PacI-HindIII fragment of pUHD10-3-PC4, where the PacI site was added in close proximity to the XhoI site of pUHD10-3) included the PC4 ORF under the control of seven copies of the tetracycline-responsive element (TRE), followed by the minimal cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (PacI-BamHI fragment) and the simian virus 40 (SV40) poly(A) site downstream of the PC4 ORF (BamHI-HindIII fragment). The activator transgene, CMV-βactin-rtTA, which produces the reverse tetracycline-regulated transactivator (rtTA) that binds and activates TRE-PC4 in the presence of tetracycline (or of its analog doxycycline), was constructed as described previously, by cloning the rtTA sequence between the CMV enhancer/chicken β-actin promoter and the rabbit β-globin polyadenylation signal (18Wiekowski M.T. Chen S.C. Zalamea P. Wilburn B.P. Kinsley D.J. Sharif W.W. Jensen K.K. Hedrick J.A. Manfra D. Lira S.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 7102-7110Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The bitransgenic CMV-βactin-rtTA/TRE-PC4 mouse line is the progeny of two mouse lines, each carrying a transgene as follows: the CMV-βactin-rtTA transgene, encoding rtTA driven by the β-actin promoter, and the TRE-PC4 transgene, carrying the PC4 coding region under control of TRE (see above). The bitransgenic CMV-βactin-rtTA/TRE-PC4 mouse line used for experiments was isogenic, having been previously interbred for at least six generations. The TRE-PC4 transgenic line was generated by injecting into zygotes derived from 4- to 8-week-old FVB female mice the purified 2.3-kb PacI-HindIII DNA fragment of TRE-PC4 (5 ng/ml; see above). Injected embryos were transferred to the oviducts of pseudopregnant FVB foster females aged 2–8 months, as described previously (19Hogan B. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995Google Scholar). The identification of transgenic founders was conducted by PCR analysis on genomic DNA from tail tips using primers that amplified the whole transgene, being complementary to regions of the vector pUHD10-3-PC4 upstream and downstream to the PC4 insert (forward, 5′-CCACTCCCTATCAGTGATAG3–3′; backward, 5′-CTCATCAATGTATCTTATCATGTC-3′). Further controls were also performed by using other sets of primers internal and external to the PC4 insert. Screening of transgenic mice for routine genotyping was performed by PCR, using the forward primer complementary to a region of the vector immediately upstream to the PC4 insert (5′-TGACCTCCATAGAAGACACC-3′) and the backward primer within the PC4 transgene (5′-AATCCCGTTCCTCCACAG-3′). The production and characterization of mice carrying the rtTA transgene under the control of CMV enhancer/chicken β-actin promoter have been described previously (18Wiekowski M.T. Chen S.C. Zalamea P. Wilburn B.P. Kinsley D.J. Sharif W.W. Jensen K.K. Hedrick J.A. Manfra D. Lira S.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 7102-7110Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Primers used to identify CMV-βactin-rtTA transgenic animals amplified 945 bp of the tTA transgene as follows: ftTA2 (5′-TGCTTAATGAGGTCGGAATCG-3′) and rtTA2 (5′-CCAAGGGCATCGGTAAACATC-3′). To evaluate the muscle regeneration process, we used bitransgenic CMV-βactin-rtTA/TRE-PC4 and control mice (the progeny of bitransgenic mice that did not inherit the TRE-PC4 transgene), and both were treated with doxycycline (2 μg/ml in drinking water) to equalize any possible effect of doxycyline on regeneration. Injury was performed on the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle of 2-month-old mice by injecting 20 μl of 10 μm cardiotoxin. Regeneration was evaluated in mice with the transgene activated by doxycycline at P30 and analyzed at P60. Mice were killed 5, 7, and 20 days after cardiotoxin injection in TA; then TA muscles were collected and embedded in OCT (Tissue-Tek; Sakura Finetek Europe, The Netherlands), and 10-μm cryosections were cut and processed for histological analysis through immunohistochemistry. At least three animals from each group (control and bitransgenic mice) per time point were analyzed. Images using a 20× lens objective were captured in three sections per group in the regenerative area, and the number of central nucleated myofibers was counted. Results are reported as the average number of fibers per area. In addition, the area of the central nucleated fibers was measured. A minimum of 2000 muscle fibers per group per time point was analyzed. Satellite cells were quantified by counting Pax7-positive cells and the total fibers in sections in the belly of the TA. Five animals for each group were analyzed. Mice were treated with doxycyline from gestation until they were killed at P45. Primary myoblasts were isolated as described by Rando and Blau (20Rando T.A. Blau H.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1275-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). Briefly, adult hindlimb muscles from 2-month-old mice were minced into a coarse slurry using razor blades and enzymatically digested at 37 °C in PBS 1×, 2 mg/ml collagenase/dispase (Roche Diagnostics). The slurry was passed through a 40-μm cell strainer (BD Biosciences). The filtrate was centrifuged at 350 × g to sediment the dissociated cells; the pellet was resuspended in growth medium, and the suspension was preplated for 2 h on noncoated dishes. The medium containing floating cells was then centrifuged, and cells were plated on collagen-coated dishes. Primary myoblasts were grown in Ham's F-10 nutrient mixture (Invitrogen), containing penicillin (200 units/ml) and streptomycin (200 μg/ml), and supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) and 5 ng/ml basic FGF (PeproTech Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ). Cells were differentiated in DMEM with 5% horse serum. Tissue culture dishes were coated with 0.01% type I collagen (Sigma). Cells were grown in a humidified incubator at 37 °C in 5% CO2. C2C12 cells from the 16th passage were obtained from H. Blau (Stanford University, Stanford, CA) and propagated in GM (Dulbecco's modified medium (DMEM) with 20% fetal bovine serum) in a humidified atmosphere of 10% CO2 at 37 °C. Differentiation was obtained by shifting the cultures to DM (DMEM with 2% horse serum), with a change of medium every 24 h. C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts were also grown in GM or DM. The 19-nucleotide siRNA sequences specific to PC4/Tis7 (i.e. both mouse and rat sequences) were designed by the on-line Design Tool software (MWG, Ebersberg, Germany). Candidate sequences were used to synthesize a pair of 64-mer oligonucleotides that were annealed and cloned in the pSUPER.retro.puro siRNA expression vector, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Oligoengine, Inc., Seattle) (21Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3963) Google Scholar). The PC4/Tis7 siRNA sequences were as follows: PC4/2, 5′-GAGAGCAGATGTTGGAGAA-3′; PC4/7, 5′-GCGCATGTATATTGATAGC-3′. The control sequence from the luciferase gene was 5′-ACGGATTACCAGGGATTTC-3′. The presence of the correct sequence cloned in pSUPER.retro.puro was confirmed by sequencing. The pSUPER.retro.puro-PC4/2, pSUPER.retro.puro-PC4/7, pSUPER.retro.puro-LUC constructs, or the empty pSUPER.retro.puro vector (Oligoengine, Inc.) were transfected into the packaging Phoenix helper cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The supernatants were collected after 48 and 72 h and used for infection. C2C12 myoblasts or C3H10T1/2 cells were plated in 90-mm dishes (6 × 105 cells) and infected the first time with the viral supernatant after 24 h and then a second time after 48 h. 72 h after plating, the cells were split and selected with puromycin (2 μg/ml) in GM for 4 days. Infected cells were then reseeded to analyze protein and mRNA expression (60-mm dishes; 4 × 105 cells) and cell cycle progression (60-mm dishes; 2 × 105 cells) or for immunofluorescence staining with myosin heavy chain (MHC) (35-mm dishes; 2 × 105 cells) or for transient luciferase reporter transfection experiments (35-mm dishes; 5–7 × 105 cells). pcDNA3-FLAG-MyoD was a gift of V. Sartorelli. pCDNA1-MEF2C, 4RE-luciferase, and 3×MEF2-luciferase were provided by E. Olson (22Molkentin J.D. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell.

Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6091-6101Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). MHC was detected by immunofluorescence staining in C2C12 cell cultures grown on 35-mm dishes and fixed for 10 min at room temperature in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 3.75% paraformaldehyde. Cells were then washed in PBS, permeabilized by a 5-min incubation in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS, washed in PBS, and incubated for 60 min at room temperature with the mouse monoclonal anti-MHC (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa; clone MF20; 1:1). The antigen was revealed by fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) secondary antibody. Immunofluorescence was observed by using an Olympus BX51 microscope (Tokyo, Japan) with a Diagnostic Instruments digital camera (model 1.3.0). Normal and lesioned TA skeletal muscles were dissected from adult mice (2.5 months), embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT (Sakura, Torrance, CA), and frozen in liquid N2-cooled isopentane. Immunocytochemistry of muscle was performed on serial sections cut transversely at a 9-μm thickness at −25 °C in a cryostat. Cryosections were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, quenched with 100 mm glycine, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100, and blocked in PBS containing 3% normal donkey serum and 0.3% Triton X-100. Sections were then incubated overnight with an antibody against laminin (Sigma; rabbit polyclonal L9393; 1:400) diluted in blocking solution. As for Pax7 immunodetection, TA cryosections fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde were permeabilized in methanol and treated with hot 0.01 m citric acid for 10 min for antigen retrieval. Dividing muscle progenitor cells were detected by visualizing the incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), injected daily (95 mg/kg intraperitoneal) during 4 days before killing mice for analysis (at P10, P15, and P30). BrdU incorporation was detected following pretreatment of sections to denature the DNA, with 2 n HCl for 45 min at 37 °C and then with 0.1 m sodium borate buffer, pH 8.5, for 10 min. Afterward, sections were incubated with a rat monoclonal antibody against BrdU (Serotec, Raleigh, NC; MCA2060; 1:150). Antigens were revealed by Cy2-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit, TRITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse or donkey anti-rat secondary antibodies (all from Jackson ImmunoResearch). Nuclei were counterstained by Hoechst 33258. Images of the immunostained sections were obtained by laser scanning confocal microscopy using a TCS SP5 microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). All analyses were performed in sequential scanning mode to rule out cross-bleeding between channels. Differentiation index and fusion index were calculated as described previously (26Soddu S. Blandino G. Scardigli R. Coen S. Marchetti A. Rizzo M.G. Bossi G. Cimino L. Crescenzi M. Sacchi A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 27Jacquemin V. Butler-Browne G.S. Furling D. Mouly V. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 670-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Differentiation index corresponded to the percent ratio of cells labeled by MHC to the total number of cells, as detected by the staining of nuclei with Hoechst 33258 dye. The fusion index was measured as percent ratio of the number of nuclei detected in MHC-labeled cells to the total number of nuclei. C2C12 myoblasts and C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts, either control-infected or shRNA PC4-infected, or primary myoblasts from Tg PC4 were lysed by sonication in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, with protease inhibitors 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm 2-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 5 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2. In experiments analyzing the protein acetylation state, deacetylase inhibitors were added (5 mm sodium butyrate and 600 nm trichostatin A). Transgenic mouse tissues were homogenized in Laemmli buffer (170 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 9% glycerol, 2.1% SDS, 4% 2-mercaptoethanol, with protease inhibitors). Proteins were electrophoretically separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose filters, as described previously (28Guardavaccaro D. Corrente G. Covone F. Micheli L. D'Agnano I. Starace G. Caruso M. Tirone F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1797-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Immunoblots were performed hybridizing filters to the following mouse monoclonal antibodies: against PC4/Tis7 (Sigma; T2576; 1:400); myogenin (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank; clone IF5D7/2; 1:3); MyoD (DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark; M3512; 1:500); Pax7 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank; 1:1); myosin heavy chain (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank; clone MF20; 1:3); sarcomeric α-actin (Sigma; A2172; 1:2000); cyclin D1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; clone 72-13G, sc450; 1:200); pRb (BD Biosciences; clone G3-245, 554136; 1:1000); α-tubulin (Sigma; clone 5C5, A2172; 1:2000); FLAG (Sigma; clone M2, F3165; 1:1000); c-myc tag (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; clone 9E10; 1:100); or to the following rabbit polyclonal antibodies against: MEF2C (Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Danvers, MA; 9792; 1:500); MEF2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc313; 1:200); Myf5 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc302; 1:200); cyclin D3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc182; 1:200); cyclin A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc596; 1:400); cyclin E (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc481; 1:200); p21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc397; 1:200); p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc372; 1:1000); p65 acetyl-K310 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK; ab52175; 1:500); or goat polyclonal antibody against HDAC4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc5246; 1:200). C2C12 myoblasts clone S4 grown in 90-mm dishes, transfected with Myc-HDAC3 or pcDNA3, were lysed by sonication in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitors, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm 2-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 5 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm sodium butyrate, 600 nm trichostatin A. Then 0.3 mg of total protein lysate was immunoprecipitated overnight with agarose-conjugated rabbit polyclonal anti-p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc372AC), or with agarose-conjugated control IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; normal rabbit IgG; sc2345). Total cellular RNA, obtained from tissues or cells according to the procedure of Chomczynski and Sacchi (29Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63149) Google Scholar), was reverse-transcribed as described previously (28Guardavaccaro D. Corrente G. Covone F. Micheli L. D'Agnano I. Starace G. Caruso M. Tirone F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1797-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Total RNA was analyzed by real time RT-PCR amplification, using TaqMan probe-based fluorogenic 5′-nuclease chemistry in duplicate samples and a 7900HT System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Relative quantification was performed by the comparative cycle-threshold method (30Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (123424) Google Scholar). The mRNA expression values were normalized to those of the TATA-binding protein gene, used as endogenous control. Statistical analysis of mRNA expression values was performed by Student's t test on data normalized to the endogenous controls but not relativized in fold expression of the calibrator sample. Specific real time RT-PCR primers for mouse mRNA primers of PC4/Tis7, muscle and cell cycle genes, and of the endogenous controls were deduced from published murine cDNA sequences and are available on request. ChIP assays were carried out as described, with modifications in the procedure of sample analysis (31Farioli-Vecchioli S. Tanori M. Micheli L. Mancuso M. Leonardi L. Saran A. Ciotti M.T. Ferretti E. Gulino A. Pazzaglia S. Tirone F. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 2215-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, cross-linking of C2C12 cells, either infected with shRNA-expressing viruses or not, was performed with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Then, chromatin was prepared from cell lysates in SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8) according to standard protocols (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Cellular lysates were sonicated to obtain DNA fragments of average size of 500–700 bp and immunoprecipitated with anti-MyoD antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; rabbit polyclonal M-318 sc-760), or normal rabbit serum as control. The immunoprecipitated DNA and the input DNA were analyzed in duplicate samples by real time PCR using SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and a 7900HT System (Applied Biosystems). The amount of immunoprecipitated promoter sequence was calculated as percentage of input (ratio of the average value of the DNA detected in immunoprecipitated samples to the average value of the DNA present in input lysates; as described by Heard et al. (32Heard E. Rougeulle C. Arnaud D. Avner P. Allis C.D. Spector D.L. Cell. 2001; 107: 727-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar)). For each cell treatment, we calculated in parallel the percentages of DNA immunoprecipitated by immune and normal serum. PCR primers used to amplify were as follows: (a) myogenin promoter (region of 140 nt before the transcription start), 5′-GGAATCACATGTAATCCACTGGAAACG-3′ and 5′-GGCTCAGGTTTCTGTGGCGTT-3′; (b) muscle creatine kinase (MCK) enhancer (region 1100 nt before transcription star; (33Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2627-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar)), 5′-GGATGAGAGCAGCCACTACGG-3′ and 5′-CCAGGCATCTCGGGTGTCC-3′; (c) PC4/Tis7 mouse promoter (region 780 nt before transcription start), 5′-TTTGCGACTGTTGATATAACTCATGTATG-3′ and 5′-CAGTTTGGAGGTCAGTTTGGGATAAG-3′; and (d) NeuroD1 promoter, 5′-GTTAGA-AGAGGAACTGGAAAGAGAAAGG-3′ and 5′-TGAC-AGAGGAGGAGGAGGAATGG-3′. The distribution of cells in the different phases of the cell cycle was studied by using propidium iodide staining. Cells grown as described above were harvested, washed in PBS, fixed in 70% cold ethanol for at least 1 h, and after removing alcoholic fixative, stained with a solution containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) and 75 KU/ml RNase (Sigma) in PBS, overnight at room temperature in the dark. Twenty thousand events per sample were acquired by using a FACScan cytofluorimeter (BD Biosciences). The percentages of the cell cycle phases we"

The molecular composition of the channel includes the pore-forming α1 subunit and auxiliary α2/δ-1 and β subunits. Ca(2+) channel γ subunits, of which there are 8 isoforms, consist of 4 transmembrane domains with intracellular N- and C-terminal ends. The γ1 subunit was initially detected in the skeletal muscle Ca(v)1.1 channel complex, modulating current amplitude and activation and inactivation properties. The γ1 subunit also shifts the steady-state inactivation to more negative membrane potentials, accelerates current inactivation, and increases peak currents, when coexpressed with the cardiac α1c subunit in Xenopus oocytes and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. The γ1 subunit is not expressed, however, in cardiac muscle. We sought to determine whether γ subunits that are expressed in cardiac tissue physically associate with and modulate Ca(v)1.2 function. We now demonstrate that γ4, γ6, γ7, and γ8 subunits physically interact with the Ca(v)1.2 complex. The γ subunits differentially modulate Ca(2+) channel function when coexpressed with the β1b and α2/δ-1 subunits in HEK cells, altering both activation and inactivation properties. The effects of γ on Ca(v)1.2 function are dependent on the subtype of β subunit. Our results identify new members of the cardiac Ca(v)1.2 macromolecular complex and identify a mechanism by which to increase the functional diversity of Ca(v)1.2 channels."

Our previous work showed a critical role of this disulfide-linked cell adhesion protein in maintenance of periodontium integrity in response to occlusal load. In this study, we attempted to address whether this mechanical response molecule played a direct role in postnatal tooth development. Our key findings are 1) periostin is expressed in preodontoblasts, and odontoblasts; and the periostin-null incisor displayed a massive increase in dentin formation after mastication; 2) periostin is also expressed in the ameloblast cells, and an enamel defect is identified in both the adult-null incisor and molar; 3) deletion of periostin leads to changes in expression profiles of many non-collagenous protein such as DSPP, DMP1, BSP, and OPN in incisor dentin; 4) the removal of a biting force leads to reduction of mineralization, which is partially prevented in periostin-null mice; and 6) both in vitro and in vivo data revealed a direct regulation of periostin by TGF-β1 in dentin formation. In conclusion, periostin plays a novel direct role in controlling postnatal tooth formation, which is required for the integrity of both enamel and dentin."
https://openalex.org/W2085048595,"Contraction and insulin promote glucose uptake in skeletal muscle through GLUT4 translocation to cell surface membranes. Although the signaling mechanisms leading to GLUT4 translocation have been extensively studied in muscle, the cellular transport machinery is poorly understood. Myo1c is an actin-based motor protein implicated in GLUT4 translocation in adipocytes; however, the expression profile and role of Myo1c in skeletal muscle have not been investigated. Myo1c protein abundance was higher in more oxidative skeletal muscles and heart. Voluntary wheel exercise (4 weeks, 8.2 ± 0.8 km/day), which increased the oxidative profile of the triceps muscle, significantly increased Myo1c protein levels by ∼2-fold versus sedentary controls. In contrast, high fat feeding (9 weeks, 60% fat) significantly reduced Myo1c by 17% in tibialis anterior muscle. To study Myo1c regulation of glucose uptake, we expressed wild-type Myo1c or Myo1c mutated at the ATPase catalytic site (K111A-Myo1c) in mouse tibialis anterior muscles in vivo and assessed glucose uptake in vivo in the basal state, in response to 15 min of in situ contraction, and 15 min following maximal insulin injection (16.6 units/kg of body weight). Expression of wild-type Myo1c or K111A-Myo1c had no effect on basal glucose uptake. However, expression of wild-type Myo1c significantly increased contraction- and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, whereas expression of K111A-Myo1c decreased both contraction-stimulated and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Neither wild-type nor K111A-Myo1c expression altered GLUT4 expression, and neither affected contraction- or insulin-stimulated signaling proteins. Myo1c is a novel mediator of both insulin-stimulated and contraction-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle.

Myo1c is a novel mediator of both insulin-stimulated and contraction-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. Glucose uptake in skeletal muscle provides energy for muscle fibers and is also critical in the maintenance of whole body glucose homeostasis. In people with type 2 diabetes, defects in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle are a major factor in impaired glucose homeostasis. Therefore, elucidating the molecular mechanisms regulating glucose uptake in muscle has been the focus of considerable research and could eventually lead to the development of new treatments for type 2 diabetes. Contraction and insulin are the major physiological stimulators of glucose uptake in muscle, and both stimuli increase uptake by increasing the number of glucose transporter proteins at the sarcolemma and transverse tubules (1Huang S.

Glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) is the major glucose transporter protein expressed in skeletal muscle, and in the basal state, it is contained in specialized intracellular vesicular structures. Insulin stimulates GLUT4 translocation in muscle via a distinct, well characterized intracellular signaling cascade that includes phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate-1/2 (IRS-1/2), activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase), and phosphorylation of Akt (6Kido Y.

These Rab GTPase-activating proteins (Rab-GAP) are thought to function by releasing intracellular GLUT4 vesicles, allowing movement to the sarcolemma and transverse tubules. Beyond AS160 and TBC1D1, little is known about the molecules that bring about the physical movement of GLUT4 toward the cell surface membranes in skeletal muscle. The cytoskeleton consists of an elaborate array of distinct protein filaments that, among other functions, participates in the intracellular transport of cellular proteins. Actin and microtubule networks are the major components of the cytoskeleton and have been reported to play roles in GLUT4 translocation in cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes, whereas only the actin network has been shown to be involved in glucose uptake in rat skeletal muscle (13Ai H.

Furthermore, F-actin staining was decreased in epitrochlearis muscles isolated from insulin-resistant hyperinsulinemic Zucker fatty rats (17McCarthy A.M. Spisak K.O. Brozinick J.T. Elmendorf J.S. Am.

In contrast, depolymerization of microtubules with colchicine, an agent that binds free tubulin monomers and acts by disrupting the microtubule lattice at the growing ends, did not inhibit insulin- or contraction-stimulated glucose uptake in multiple rat skeletal muscles despite the disappearance of the majority of the microtubule network (13Ai H.

Taken together, these observations suggest that the actin cytoskeleton, but not the microtubules, plays a role in the movement or fusion of GLUT4 to the cell surface membrane in skeletal muscle. Myo1c (previously called MM1β/Myr2) is a single-headed, actin-associated molecular motor protein of ∼120 kDa belonging to the class I myosin family. Myo1c consists of three domains: an amino-terminal motor domain, a regulatory domain (neck domain or lever arm), and a carboxyl-terminal tail domain (18Reizes O. Barylko B. Li C. Südhof T.C. Albanesi J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 6349-6353Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The motor domain is conserved and contains the ATPase catalytic and actin-binding sites. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, Myo1c functions as one component of the GLUT4-vesicle carrier system that promotes GLUT4 translocation to the cell surface membrane (19Bose A. Guilherme A. Robida S.I.

In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, it was also demonstrated that insulin regulates Myo1c function via CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation that increased Myo1c ATPase activity, the domain responsible for motor activity (23Yip M.F.

In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that Myo1c is expressed in skeletal muscle and functions in the regulation of glucose uptake. For this purpose, we determined the expression profile of Myo1c in various metabolic states in mouse skeletal muscle and used in vivo gene transfection and glucose uptake measurements to determine whether Myo1c regulates contraction- and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. We found that Myo1c protein abundance is associated with the metabolic phenotype of the muscle and that this protein functions in the control of glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. Female ICR mice (8–9 weeks, 25–30 g) were obtained from Taconic Laboratory (Hudson, NY) or Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA), and female db/db mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories. Mice were housed at 20–22 °C with a 12-h light/dark cycle. For the exercise training studies, female ICR mice were housed in wheel cages for 4 weeks, and the corresponding control mice for these experiments were housed in separate cages that did not have a wheel. These mice received LabDiet® rodent chow (Purina Mills Inc., St. Louis, MO) and water ad libitum. A separate cohort of 6-week-old C57BL/6NHsd male mice was fed a high fat diet (60% kcal fat) or normal chow diet from Harlan Labs for 9 weeks (TD 06414). All experiments were performed in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Joslin Diabetes Center and the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. A mouse wild-type Myo1c cDNA construct was purchased from OriGene (MC201330, Rockville, MD). Myo1c DNA was excised from the original pCMV6 vector, affixed to a single hemagglutinin (HA) tag sequence at the NH2-terminal via specific primers and PCR amplification, and subcloned into pCS2+ plasmids. An ATPase-inactive mutant of Myo1c (K111A-Myo1c) was generated by mutating Lys111 to Ala111 using site-directed mutagenesis (200522; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). This mutation has previously been shown to eliminate Myo1c ATPase activity (23Yip M.F. Ramm G. Larance M. Hoehn K.L. Wagner M.C. Guilhaus M. James D.E.

Myo1c cDNA constructs were sequenced to confirm accuracy using the high throughput DNA sequencing service at the Brigham and Women's Hospital (Boston, MA). Plasmid DNA was amplified in Escherichia coli TOP10 cells (Invitrogen), extracted using an endotoxin-free plasmid mega kit (Qiagen), and solubilized in saline at 4 μg/μl. Myo1c plasmids and empty vector (100 μg) were injected into mouse tibialis anterior muscles followed by electroporation as we have previously described (7Witczak C.A. Jessen N. Warro D.M. Toyoda T.

The mice were fasted overnight (9 p.m. to 8 a.m.) prior to study and anesthetized (100 mg of pentobarbital/kg of body weight), and one leg was sham-treated and the other leg was contracted in situ by peroneal nerve stimulation for 15 min as we have previously described (25An D.

Lysates (40 μg of protein) were separated by SDS-PAGE before immunoblotting (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205516) Google Scholar). Antibody-bound proteins were visualized with chemiluminescence detection reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and detected on a film or using the FluorChemTM 8000 (Alpha Innotech Co., San Leandro, CA). Protein bands in the film were scanned with an ImageScanner (GE Healthcare). Images were quantitated by densitometry (Fluor-Chem 2.0, Alpha Innotech). Quantification of protein expression was calculated relative to the loading control. Fold increases were expressed relative to the average of the empty vector-injected control group (Basal or Saline). Anti-Myo1c was a gift from Michael P.

Aliquots of muscle lysates were added to microcentrifuge tubes containing 30% KOH, 5% Na2SO4 and then heated at 60 °C for 10 min. Glycogen was precipitated by adding 100% ethanol and placed at −20 °C overnight. Tubes were centrifuged and decanted; the precipitates were washed with 100% ethanol and then centrifuged and decanted once more. The precipitates were hydrolyzed by heating at 95 °C for 1 h in 6 n H2SO4 (30Lo S. Russell J.C. Taylor A.W. J. Appl. Physiol. 1970; 28: 234-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Neutralized supernatants were used for measurement of glucose (31Bondar R.J. Mead D.C. Clin. Chem. 1974; 20: 586-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), and glycogen content was expressed as glucose units in muscle lysates. Data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Statistical analyses were performed using unpaired t tests, one-way analysis of variance, or two-way analysis of variance (SigmaStat 3.5, Systat, San Jose, CA). When differences between means were detected by one- or two-way analysis of variance, the Student-Newman-Keuls test was used for post hoc testing. The differences between groups were considered significant when p < 0.05. The expression profile of Myo1c in skeletal muscle has not been previously investigated. Because muscles composed of a higher percentage of oxidative fibers have greater levels of GLUT4 and glucose transport when compared with muscles containing more glycolytic fiber types (32Henriksen E.J. Bourey R.E. Rodnick K.J. Koranyi L. Permutt M.A. Holloszy J.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: E593-E598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Hayasaki H. Shimada M. Kanbara K. Watanabe M. Acta Histochem. 2001; 103: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that oxidative muscles would express greater levels of Myo1c. Myo1c protein abundance was greatest in soleus muscle followed by red gastrocnemius, extensor digitorum longus, tibialis anterior muscle, and white gastrocnemius (Fig. 1A). The heart, which is also a highly oxidative muscle, also had high levels of Myo1c expression (Fig. 1A). There was a significant correlation between Myo1c and GLUT4 protein abundance in red and white gastrocnemius muscle (supplemental Fig. S1). Thus, Myo1c is expressed at higher levels in more oxidative muscle types that also have a greater abundance of GLUT4. We next tested the effects of chronic metabolic alterations on Myo1c expression. Exercise training can induce profound changes in muscle phenotype including increases in oxidative capacity and GLUT4 expression in skeletal muscle (34Rodnick K.J. Holloszy J.O. Mondon C.E. James D.E. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 1425-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 35Terjung R.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1976; 230: 946-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 36Röckl K.S. Witczak C.A. Goodyear L.J. IUBMB Life. 2008; 60: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). To determine whether exercise training alters Myo1c abundance in skeletal muscle, mice were housed in exercise wheel cages for 4 weeks. The mice completed high levels of voluntary exercise during the 4-week period (8.2 ± 0.8 km/day), which we have previously shown results in significant increases in oxidative muscle fiber types and increases in citrate synthase activity (37Rodnick K.J.

Wheel cage training significantly increased Myo1c and GLUT4 protein in triceps muscle by 1.9- and 2.1-fold, respectively, when compared with sedentary controls (Fig. 1, B and C). Taken together, these results demonstrate that muscles that have a higher level of oxidative capacity have a higher level of Myo1c expression. High fat-fed mice and db/db mice are animal models of insulin resistance that have impaired insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle (42Fujii N. Ho R.C. Manabe Y. Jessen N. Toyoda T.

To determine whether Myo1c abundance is altered with high fat feeding, 6-week-old mice were fed a high fat diet (60% kcal from fat) for 9 weeks, and tibialis anterior muscles were studied. Myo1c protein was significantly decreased in the muscles when compared with chow-fed control mice (Fig. 1D). Consistent with these findings, Myo1c protein tended to be decreased in tibialis anterior muscles from db/db mice (Fig. 1E), a model of insulin resistance by virtue of an inactivating mutation of the leptin receptor. Thus, Myo1c has a propensity to be decreased in muscles from insulin-resistant animal models, consistent with the idea that Myo1c may have a specialized function to regulate glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle. To study Myo1c function in skeletal muscle, we used in vivo injection and electroporation methods to overexpress wild-type Myo1c in tibialis anterior muscles of mice. Seven days after cDNA plasmid injection, expression of Myo1c was severalfold higher in mouse tibialis anterior muscles when compared with endogenous Myo1c obtained from empty vector-injected controls (Fig. 2A). To determine whether Myo1c regulates contraction-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle in vivo, mice were anesthetized and administered 2-[3H]deoxyglucose via the retro-orbital sinus. One leg was sham-treated, and the other leg was contracted by electrical stimulation of the peroneal nerve for 15 min, and tibialis anterior muscles were obtained 30 min later. Overexpression of wild-type Myo1c had no effect on basal rates of glucose uptake. However, contraction-stimulated glucose uptake was significantly increased when compared with the empty vector control-injected muscles (Fig. 2B). We next examined whether Myo1c regulates insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle in vivo. Anesthetized mice were administered 2-[3H]deoxyglucose together with both insulin (16.6 units/kg of body weight) and 20% glucose (1 g of glucose/kg of body weight) to prevent hypoglycemia via the retro-orbital sinus. Fifteen min after injection, muscles were harvested and processed for measurements of muscle glucose uptake. Overexpression of wild-type Myo1c had no effect on basal rates of glucose uptake (Fig. 2C). However, muscles overexpressing wild-type Myo1c exhibited a significant increase in maximal insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (Fig. 2C). Thus, exogenous Myo1c can enhance maximal insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Myo1c has been reported to associate with GLUT4-containing vesicles (19Bose A. Guilherme A. Robida S.I. Nicoloro S.M.

Cell. 2007; 13: 391-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined whether overexpression of wild-type Myo1c alters the abundance of GLUT4 in the transfected muscles. There was no difference in GLUT4 protein expression among muscles injected with empty vector or wild-type Myo1c constructs (Fig. 3A and supplemental Table S1). In addition, overexpression of wild-type Myo1c did not alter GLUT1 protein expression or the glycolytic enzyme hexokinase II, which can be a critical regulator of glucose uptake in skeletal muscle (Fig. 3A and supplemental Table S1). Contraction and insulin activate numerous signaling proteins in skeletal muscle that could regulate glucose uptake. Therefore, we determined whether overexpression of wild-type Myo1c altered the protein expression of the AMPKα1 and -α2 catalytic subunits, the CaMKII βM and γ/δ isoforms, IRS-1, Akt, and the Rab-GAP proteins AS160 and TBC1D1. The immunoblots showed that there was no effect of overexpressing wild-type Myo1c on the expression of any of these key signaling proteins (Fig. 3A and supplemental Table S1).

Highly conserved annexins may modulate the phagocytic cell removal by acting as bridging molecules to phosphatidylserine, a characteristic phagocytosis signal of dying cells. In this study five members of the structurally and functionally related annexin family were characterized for their capacity to interact with phosphatidylserine and dying cells. The results showed that AnxA3, AnxA4, AnxA13, and the already described interaction partner AnxA5 can bind to phosphatidylserine and apoptotic cells, whereas AnxA8 lacks this ability. Sequence alignment experiments located the essential amino residues for the recognition of surface exposed phosphatidylserine within the calcium binding motifs common to all annexins. These amino acid residues were missing in the evolutionary young AnxA8 and when they were reintroduced by site directed mutagenesis AnxA8 gains the capability to interact with phosphatidylserine containing liposomes and apoptotic cells. By defining the evolutionary conserved amino acid residues mediating phosphatidylserine binding of annexins we show that the recognition of dying cells represent a common feature of most annexins. Hence, the individual annexin repertoire bound to the cell surface of dying cells may fulfil opsonin-like function in cell death recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2050903035,"Dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinases, DYRKs, are a family of conserved protein kinases that play key roles in the regulation of cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival. Of the five mammalian DYRKs, DYRK4 is the least studied family member. Here, we show that several splice variants of DYRK4 are expressed in tissue-specific patterns and that these variants have distinct functional capacities. One of these variants contains a nuclear localization signal in its extended N terminus that mediates its interaction with importin α3 and α5 and that is capable of targeting a heterologous protein to the nucleus. Consequently, the nucleocytoplasmic mobility of this variant differs from that of a shorter isoform in live cell imaging experiments. Other splicing events affect the catalytic domain, including a three-amino acid deletion within subdomain XI that markedly reduces the enzymatic activity of DYRK4. We also show that autophosphorylation of a tyrosine residue within the activation loop is necessary for full DYRK4 kinase activity, a defining feature of the DYRK family. Finally, by comparing the phosphorylation of an array of 720 peptides, we show that DYRK1A, DYRK2, and DYRK4 differ in their target recognition sequence and that preference for an arginine residue at position P -3 is a feature of DYRK1A but not of DYRK2 and DYRK4. Therefore, we highlight the use of subcellular localization as an important regulatory mechanism for DYRK proteins, and we propose that substrate specificity could be a source of functional diversity among DYRKs."
https://openalex.org/W1971725412,"Elongation of transcription by mammalian RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) is regulated by specific factors, including transcription factor IIS (TFIIS) and positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb). We show that the E3 ubiquitin ligase UBR5 associates with the CDK9 subunit of positive transcription elongation factor b to mediate its polyubiquitination in human cells. TFIIS also binds UBR5 to stimulate CDK9 polyubiquitination. Co-localization of UBR5, CDK9, and TFIIS along specific regions of the γ fibrinogen (γFBG) gene indicates that a ternary complex involving these factors participates in the transcriptional regulation of this gene. In support of this notion, overexpression of TFIIS not only modifies the ubiquitination pattern of CDK9 in vivo but also increases the association of CDK9 with various regions of the γFBG gene. Notably, the TFIIS-mediated increase in CDK9 loading is obtained during both basal and activated transcription of the γFBG gene. This increased CDK9 binding is paralleled by an increase in the recruitment of RNAPII along the γFBG gene and the phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of the RNAPII largest subunit RPB1 on Ser-2, a known target of CDK9. Together, these results identify UBR5 as a novel E3 ligase that regulates transcription and define an additional function of TFIIS in the regulation of CDK9."

Mutations in GLIS2 are linked to nephronophthisis, a chronic kidney disease characterized by renal fibrosis and atrophy in children and young adults. Currently, very little information exists about the mechanism of action of Glis2, its target genes, or the signaling pathways that regulate its activity. In this study, we show that a region within ZF3 is required for the nuclear localization of Glis2. Analysis of Glis2 DNA binding demonstrated that Glis2 binds effectively to the consensus Glis binding sequence (GlisBS) (G/C)TGGGGGGT(A/C). Although Glis2 was unable to induce transactivation of a GlisBS-dependent reporter, it effectively inhibited the GlisBS-mediated transactivation by Gli1. Mutations that disrupt the tetrahedral configuration of each ZF within Glis2 abolished Glis2 binding to GlisBS and also abrogated its inhibition of Gli1-mediated transactivation. In contrast, Glis2 was able to activate the murine insulin-2 (Ins2) promoter by binding directly to two GlisBS elements located at −263 and −99 within the Ins2 promoter. Phosphomimetic mutation of Ser245 inhibited the binding of Glis2 to GlisBS and dramatically affected its transactivation of the Ins2 promoter and its ability to inhibit GlisBS-dependent transactivation by Gli1. In this study, we demonstrate that Glis2 can function as a transcriptional activator and that post-translational modification within its DNA-binding domain can regulate its transcriptional activity.

Mice deficient in Glis2 develop progressive tubular atrophy, severe interstitial fibrosis, glomerulosclerosis, and infiltration of inflammatory cells that ultimately result in renal failure and premature death.

Although relatively little is understood about the various stages involved in Glis2-mediated transcriptional regulation, recent studies have provided some clues about the signaling pathways that may regulate its function (3Kim S.C.

Both Glis2 and Glis3 localize to the primary cilium, suggesting that Glis proteins may be involved in signaling pathways that originate from the primary cilium (7Attanasio M. Uhlenhaut N.H.

Moreover, several Glis2-interacting proteins have been identified, including CtBP1 (C-terminal binding protein 1) that functions as a co-repressor of Glis2 (3Kim S.C. Kim Y.S. Jetten A.M. Nucleic. Acids. Res. 2005; 33: 6805-6815Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although other studies have demonstrated the interaction of Glis2 with β-catenin and p120 catenin (3Kim S.C. Kim Y.S.

In this study, we demonstrate that Glis2 is able to activate the mouse insulin-2 (Ins2) promoter by binding two proximal GlisBS elements. We further characterize several other key steps involved in Glis2-mediated transactivation, including Glis2 nuclear localization and DNA binding, and identify a critical role for Ser245 phosphorylation, a previously identified target of the EGF signaling pathway (18Olsen J.V.

Our data suggest that Glis2 can function as an activator of transcription and that its activity can be modulated by post-translational modifications. It is likely that these processes play an important role in regulating Glis2-dependent gene expression and functions in the kidney. HEK293, HeLa, and mIMCD3 (mouse inner medullary collecting duct) cells were purchased from ATCC. HEK293 and HeLa cells were grown in DMEM (Invitrogen) and mIMCD3 cells in DMEM/F12 (1:1) supplemented with fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. N-terminal FLAG-tagged Glis2 and mutant Glis2 mammalian expression vectors were generated by cloning the respective cDNAs into the HindIII-BamHI sites of p3XFLAG-CMV10 (Sigma). Point mutations within p3XFLAG-CMV10 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's protocol. To generate the Glis2(237–264)-EGFP and Glis2(237–286)-EGFP expression plasmids, the respective cDNAs together with an upstream Kozak sequence were cloned into the EcoRI-BamHI sites of pEGFP-N2 (Clontech). A putative translation initiation site in the EGFP sequence downstream of BamHI was mutated to CTG. MBP-Glis2 fusion proteins were constructed by cloning the PCR product of the targeted region of Glis2 into the EcoRI-HindIII sites of pMAL-c2x (New England Biolabs). Mouse Ins2 promoter constructs were generated by PCR amplification of the −696 to +8 region of the mouse Ins2 gene by using mouse genomic DNA as template and cloned into the NheI-HindIII sites of pGL4.10 luciferase reporter vector. mouse Ins2(−696/+8) was used as template for the subsequent deletion constructs of mouse Ins2. Site-directed mutagenesis of the two GlisBS sites within the mouse Ins2 promoter was carried out by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutated bases are underlined in the following: GlisBS(−99) (5′-CTGCTGACCTACTTCACCTGGAGCCC) and GlisBS(−263) (5′-GGAACAATGTCTTCTGCTGTGAAC). Lipofectamine 2000 and OptiMEM (Invitrogen) were used in all transfections as per the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were processed for the required application between 24–40 h post transfection. For luciferase assays, 293T cells were transfected with 200 ng of luciferase reporter constructs per well of a 12-well plate and 100 ng, 5 ng of β-galactosidase, and 100 ng of each cotransfectant or as indicated. Cells were lysed with passive lysis buffer (Promega), firefly luciferase assayed with luciferase reagent substrate (Promega), and normalized with β-galactosidase activity assayed with luminescent substrate (Clontech). mIMCD3 or HeLa cells were transfected with 0.25 μg of the indicated FLAG-Glis2 or Glis2-EGFP plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 and fixed 24 h later in 4% paraformaldehyde, quenched (20 mm glycine, 75 mm ammonium chloride), permeabilized, and blocked in 0.2% Triton X-100 in SuperBlock buffer (Thermo Scientific). Cells were washed in PBS, subsequently incubated for 1 h with anti-FLAG M2 mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma) in SuperBlock buffer, washed with PBS, and incubated with goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 40 min. Cells were washed with PBS, and nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Fluorescence was observed with a Zeiss confocal microscope LSM 510 NLO (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). MBP-Glis2 fusion protein constructs were transformed in Rosetta cells. Bacteria were induced with 0.3 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 16 °C for 24 h. After sonication in extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 200 mm NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mm immidazole), bacterial lysates were centrifuged, and supernatant was mixed with prewashed amylose binding resin (New England Biolabs) for 30 min. Fusion proteins were eluted by incubation with 10 mm maltose for 10 min in extraction buffer twice, and purity was checked by SDS-PAGE (supplemental Fig. 1). Annealed probes were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. Binding reactions were carried out with 2 μg of purified MBP-Glis2 fusion protein and 50,000 cpm of the labeled probe at room temperature in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, and 2.5 μg/ml BSA. DNA-protein complexes were then separated on a 6% tris-borate-EDTA polycacrylamide gel, dried, and exposed for autoradiography. RNA from rat tissues and cell lines was isolated with an RNeasy mini kit as described previously (19Kang H.S. Angers M. Beak J.Y. Wu X. Gimble J.M. Wada T. Xie W. Collins J.B. Grissom S.F. Jetten A.M. Physiol. Genomics. 2007; 18: 281-294Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The RNA was reverse-transcribed using a high capacity cDNA archive kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Quantitative RT-PCR reactions were performed using the TaqMan system. The sequences of Glis2 primer and probe sets were as follows: forward primer (TGGCCACTTTGTGTCACATGA), Glis2 reverse primer (CGCTGACATAGGAGCCACTGT), and Glis2 probe (CAGCTGCGCCCACCCCCTAA). All results were normalized relatively to the 18 S RNA transcripts. Glis2, to exert its function as a transcription factor, requires translocation to the nucleus. Although Glis2 also localizes to the primary cilium in renal epithelial cells (7Attanasio M. Uhlenhaut N.H. Sousa V.H. O'Toole J.F. Otto E. Anlag K. Klugmann C. Treier A.C. Helou J. Sayer J.A. Seelow D. Nürnberg G. Becker C. Chudley A.E. Nürnberg P. Hildebrandt F. Treier M. Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 1018-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), it must translocate to the nucleus to regulate gene expression. To understand the domains involved in its nuclear translocation, we analyzed the effect of several deletions on the subcellular localization of Glis2 in mIMCD3 cells. C-terminal deletions up to aa 264 and N-terminal deletions up to aa 237 had little effect on the nuclear localization of Glis2, whereas further deletions at either end greatly affected the accumulation of Glis2 into the nucleus (Fig. 1A). These data suggested that the region required for nuclear localization of Glis2 resided in ZF3 spanning the residues 237–264. Analysis of additional N-terminal deletions within the ZF3 up to aa 246 and 256 confirmed that the region between aa 237 and 246 was required for nuclear localization. Additional C-terminal deletions within the ZF3 up to aa 256 and 246 slightly enhanced cytoplasmic staining of Glis2, whereas a deletion up to aa 237 abolished the accumulation of Glis2 into the nucleus suggesting that the region between aa 237–265 is required for the optimal nuclear localization of Glis2 with the 237–246 sequence being the most critical (Fig. 1, B and C). Mutation of one of the cysteines within ZF3 did not affect the accumulation of Glis2 in the nucleus significantly (supplemental Fig. 2) indicating that the tretrahedral conformation of ZF3 was not required. Similar mutations in the other ZF motifs also did not affect the nuclear localization of Glis2 (supplemental Fig. 2). To examine the ability of ZF3 to promote nuclear accumulation, we analyzed the subcellular localization of two chimeric proteins, Glis2(237–286)-EGFP and Glis2(237–264)-EGFP. In contrast to EGFP, which was distributed almost equally between the nucleus and cytoplasm, both Glis2(237–286)- and Glis2(237–64)-EGFP fusion proteins were predominantly localized to the nucleus in both HeLa (Fig. 1D) and mIMCD3 cells (data not shown). These data suggest that ZF3 alone is capable of promoting nuclear retention of EGFP. In contrast to FLAG-Glis2 mutants (Fig. 1, A and B), both Glis2-EGFP fusion proteins also localized to the nucleoli. Shorter regions of ZF3 did not promote the nuclear accumulation of EGFP (data not shown) suggesting that under these conditions the entire ZF3(237–264) is required to induce nuclear retention. Glis proteins modulate gene transcription by binding to specific DNA binding sites in the promoter of target genes (4Kang H.S. ZeRuth G. Lichti-Kaiser K. Vasanth S. Yin Z. Kim Y.S. Jetten A.M. Histol. Histopath. 2010; 25: 1481-1496PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies identified TGGGTGGTC (GBS) and (G/C)TGGGGGGT(A/C) (GlisBS) as the consensus optimal binding sites for Gli1 and Glis3, respectively (12Beak J.Y. Kang H.S. Kim Y.S. Jetten A.M. Nucleic. Acids. Res. 2008; 36: 1690-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 20Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 634-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Although the DNA binding element for Glis2 has not yet been clearly defined, we hypothesized that given the high degree of homology between the zinc finger domains, the binding site of Glis2 might resemble that of Gli1 and Glis3. To analyze the Glis2 DNA binding, we examined the binding of an MBP-Glis2(166–349) fusion protein containing the complete zinc finger domain of Glis2 to 32P-labeled consensus GlisBS and GBS probes by EMSA. This analysis demonstrated that Glis2 was able to bind the 32P-labeled GlisBS consensus sequence. Moreover, it revealed unlabeled GlisBS competed more efficiently with 32P-labeled GlisBS for Glis2 binding than GBS suggesting that GlisBS has a stronger binding affinity for Glis2 than GBS (Fig. 2A). The latter was supported by data showing that unlabeled GlisBS competed also more efficiently with 32P-labeled GBS for Glis2 binding than GBS (Fig. 2B). Mutation of the first Cys to Gly in either the fourth (C265G) or the fifth (C295G) zinc finger domain (ZFD) of Glis2, which destroys the tetrahedral conformation of the ZF, completely abolished Glis2 binding to GlisBS (Fig. 2A) and GBS (Fig. 2B), thereby ascertaining the requirement of the structural integrity of the ZFD for Glis2 DNA binding. To further analyze the binding specificity of Glis2, we examined the ability of a series of unlabeled GlisBS point mutants (M1–M11) to compete against the radiolabeled consensus GlisBS for Glis2 binding (Fig. 2, C and D). Fig. 2C shows that the GlisBS mutants M1–M4 did not efficiently compete with 32P-labeled GlisBS for Glis2 binding indicating a low affinity of Glis2 for these sequences. In contrast, GlisBS mutants M5–M11 competed well with 32P-labeled GlisBS for Glis2 binding. Substitution of the T in the GlisBS consensus for A, as in M1, abolished the ability to compete, whereas mutation to C, as in M8, did not affect its competition. Similarly, substitution of the fifth G for a C or A, as in M4 and M10, respectively, either abolished or had little effect on the interaction with Glis2. These data suggest that single nucleotide changes in the GlisBS sequence can significantly influence the binding of Glis2. However, none of the mutants competed more effectively than the GlisBS consensus indicating that among the binding sites tested, Glis2 exhibits the highest affinity for the consensus GlisBS. The finding that Glis2 could bind the GlisBS led us to analyze its ability to activate a luciferase reporter under the control of six tandem repeats of GlisBS (12Beak J.Y. Kang H.S. Kim Y.S. Jetten A.M. Nucleic. Acids. Res. 2008; 36: 1690-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In contrast to Gli1, which effectively induced GlisBS-dependent activation of the reporter, Glis2 had little effect on Luc reporter activity in HEK293 cells (Fig. 3A). Cotransfection of Glis2 with Gli1, however, greatly suppressed Gli1-induced reporter activity in a dose-dependent manner. The fact that the deletion mutant Glis2(164–327), containing only the DNA binding domain, was also able to repress Gli1-mediated transactivation suggested that the observed suppression is likely attributable to the competition between Glis2 and Gli1 for GlisBS binding (Fig. 3A). To determine whether the binding of Glis2 to DNA is required for suppression of Gli1 transactivation function, the effects of several single Cys-to-Gly mutations, which destroy the tetrahedral configuration of each of the five zinc fingers, were examined. As shown in Fig. 3B, each ZF mutation abolished the ability of Glis2 to suppress Gli1-mediated activation of the GlisBS reporter. Western blot analysis of the protein lysates used in the reporter assay showed that co-expression with Glis2 did not significantly affect the level of Gli1 protein suggesting that Glis2-mediated suppression of Gli1 activation was unrelated to changes in Gli1 protein levels. These data further suggest that this suppression requires the intact structure of each zinc finger motif of Glis2 and likely involves competition between Glis2 and Gli1 for GlisBS binding. This conclusion is consistent with EMSA results showing that the Cys-to-Gly mutations within zinc finger 4 and 5 totally abolished the binding of Glis2(166–349) to GlisBS (Fig. 2, A and B). Although many genes have been reported to be aberrantly regulated in the kidney as a result of the loss of Glis2 expression, the mechanisms by which Glis2 controls these genes still remains poorly understood (7Attanasio M. Uhlenhaut N.H. Sousa V.H. O'Toole J.F. Otto E. Anlag K. Klugmann C. Treier A.C. Helou J. Sayer J.A. Seelow D. Nürnberg G. Becker C. Chudley A.E. Nürnberg P. Hildebrandt F. Treier M. Nat.

Although Glis2 binds the consensus GlisBS efficiently (Fig. 2A), it fails to induce (GlisBS)6-mediated transcriptional activation in HEK293 cells (Fig. 3A). Recent studies showed that Glis3 strongly activated the Ins2 promoter through two GlisBS in the proximal (−300 nt) promoter region (10Kang H.S. Beak J.Y. Kim Y.S. Herbert R. Jetten A.M. Mol. Cell.

Res. 2009; 37: 2529-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Because Glis2 was able to bind GlisBS elements, we investigated whether Glis2 was able to mediate transcriptional activation through this promoter. We first established that Glis2 was expressed in two different pancreatic β-like cell lines, INS-1 832/13 and INS-1 832/3, at a level comparable with that of kidney, whereas its expression was significantly lower in whole pancreas and very low in liver (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4C, coexpression of Glis2 with a reporter plasmid in which luciferase is under the control of the −696/+8 region of the mouse Ins2 promoter, showed that Glis2 strongly activated transcription through this promoter in HEK293 cells in a dose-dependent manner. This is the first evidence that clearly demonstrates the transactivation potential of Glis2, rather than its suggested role as transcriptional repressor as reported previously (3Kim S.C. Kim Y.S. Jetten A.M. Nucleic. Acids. Res. 2005; 33: 6805-6815Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 16Kim Y.S. Kang H.S. Jetten A.M. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 858-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In contrast to wild type Glis2, the mutants Glis2(C625G), containing a point mutation within the fourth ZFD that destroys Glis2 binding to GlisBS, and Glis2(164–327), containing only the ZFD of Glis2, did not activate the Ins2 promoter (Fig. 4, B and C). Additionally, the C- and N-terminal deletion mutants, Glis2(1–327) and Glis2(164–521), respectively, were both able to modestly activate the Ins2 promoter, albeit less efficiently than full-length Glis2 (Fig. 4D). Taken together, these data suggest that Glis2-mediated Ins2 transactivation is dependent upon DNA binding and that both the N and C termini of Glis2 are essential for maximal transactivation. To further demonstrate that the activation of Ins2 by Glis2 involves binding of Glis2 to the two GlisBS, GlisBS(−99) (TACCCCAC) and GlisBS(−263) (GTCCCCTGC), located at −99 and −263 of Ins2, respectively (Fig. 5A), we analyzed by EMSA the ability of these GlisBS sites to compete with radiolabeled consensus GlisBS for Glis2 binding (Fig. 5B). Both Ins2 GlisBS(−99) and GlisBS(−263) competed very effectively with the consensus GlisBS for Glis2 binding, whereas mutated GlisBS(−263) or GlisBS(−99) were not very efficient in competing for Glis2 binding (Fig. 5B). Upon screening the promoter for possible additional GlisBS sites, a third putative GlisBS element at −331 (GlisBS(−331), GTCCCCAAC) was considered. However, GlisBS(−331) failed to compete with the consensus GlisBS for Glis2 binding (Fig. 5B). We next examined the binding of Glis2 to 32P-labeled GlisBS(−99) or GlisBS(−263). The EMSA analysis in Fig. 5C supported the conclusion that Glis2 bound to these sites directly. GlisBS(−99) competed better than GlisBS(−263) suggesting that Glis2 might have a higher affinity for GlisBS(−99) than GlisBS(−263). Mutant GlisBS(−99) and GlisBS(−263), and GlisBS(−331) did not compete effectively for with GlisBS(−99) for Glis2 binding (Fig. 5, C and D). To ascertain whether one or both of the GlisBS elements were involved in the activation of the Ins2 promoter by Glis2, we examined the effect of a series of deletions and point mutations within the Ins2 promoter on the transactivation of the Luc reporter. Deletions up to −288 had no significant effect on the Ins2 promoter activity (Fig. 6A). However, deletion of up to −256, which removed the GlisBS(−263), greatly diminished promoter activity. We next examined the effect of point mutations within GlisBS(−263) and GlisBS(−99) on Ins2(−696/+8)-Luc activation. Mutations in a single binding site resulted in a significant reduction in Glis2-induced activation of Ins2(−696/+8)-Luc, whereas mutations in both sites reduced activation by 80% (Fig. 6B). The GlisBS(−263) mutation reduced the activity to a similar extent as the −256 deletion consistent with the loss of the GlisBS(−263) site in both constructs (Fig. 6A). The Ins2 promoter has been wel"

The aim of this study was to expand knowledge of the chemical-sensing capabilities of TRPC5 by investigating dietary antioxidants. Human TRPC5 channels were expressed in HEK 293 cells and studied by patch clamp and intracellular Ca(2+) recording. GFP- and HA-tagged channels were used to quantify plasma membrane localization. Gallic acid and vitamin C suppressed TRPC5 activity if it was evoked by exogenous hydrogen peroxide or lanthanide ions but not by lysophosphatidylcholine or carbachol. Catalase mimicked the effects, suggesting that lanthanide-evoked activity depended on endogenous hydrogen peroxide. Trans-resveratrol, by contrast, inhibited all modes of TRPC5, and its effect was additive with that of vitamin C, suggesting antioxidant-independent action. The IC(50) was ∼10 μM. Diethylstilbestrol, a related hydroxylated stilbene, inhibited TRPC5 with a similar IC(50), but its action contrasted sharply with that of resveratrol in outside-out membrane patches where diethylstilbestrol caused strong and reversible inhibition and resveratrol had no effect, suggesting indirect modulation by resveratrol. Resveratrol did not affect channel surface density, but its effect was calcium-sensitive, indicating an action via a calcium-dependent intermediate. The data suggest previously unrecognized chemical-sensing properties of TRPC5 through multiple mechanisms: (i) inhibition by scavengers of reactive oxygen species because a mode of TRPC5 activity depends on endogenous hydrogen peroxide; (ii) direct channel blockade by diethylstilbestrol; and (iii) indirect, antioxidant-independent inhibition by resveratrol."
https://openalex.org/W2094352910,"Integrins are cell adhesion receptors that mediate cell-to-cell, or cell-to-extracellular matrix adhesion. They represent an attractive target for treatment of multiple diseases. Two classes of small molecule integrin inhibitors have been developed. Competitive antagonists bind directly to the integrin ligand binding pocket and thus disrupt the ligand-receptor interaction. Allosteric antagonists have been developed primarily for α(L)β(2)- integrin (LFA-1, lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1). Here we present the results of screening the Prestwick Chemical Library using a recently developed assay for the detection of α(4)β(1)-integrin allosteric antagonists. Secondary assays confirmed that the compounds identified: 1) do not behave like competitive (direct) antagonists; 2) decrease ligand binding affinity for VLA-4 ∼2 orders of magnitude; 3) exhibit antagonistic properties at low temperature. In a cell based adhesion assay in vitro, the compounds rapidly disrupted cellular aggregates. In accord with reports that VLA-4 antagonists in vivo induce mobilization of hematopoietic progenitors into the peripheral blood, we found that administration of one of the compounds significantly increased the number of colony-forming units in mice. This effect was comparable to AMD3100, a well known progenitor mobilizing agent. Because all the identified compounds are structurally related, previously used, or currently marketed drugs, this result opens a range of therapeutic possibilities for VLA-4-related pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W2056732935,"Flavoproteins can dramatically adjust the thermodynamics and kinetics of electron transfer at their flavin cofactor. A versatile regulatory tool is proton transfer. Here, we demonstrate the significance of proton-coupled electron transfer to redox tuning and semiquinone (sq) stability in photolyases (PLs) and cryptochromes (CRYs). These light-responsive proteins share homologous overall architectures and FAD-binding pockets, yet they have evolved divergent functions that include DNA repair, photomorphogenesis, regulation of circadian rhythm, and magnetoreception. We report the first measurement of both FAD redox potentials for cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer PL (CPD-PL, Anacystis nidulans). These values, E(1)(hq/sq) = -140 mV and E(2)(sq/ox) = -219 mV, where hq is FAD hydroquinone and ox is oxidized FAD, establish that the sq is not thermodynamically stabilized (ΔE = E(2) - E(1) = -79 mV). Results with N386D CPD-PL support our earlier hypothesis of a kinetic barrier to sq oxidation associated with proton transfer. Both E(1) and E(2) are upshifted by ∼ 100 mV in this mutant; replacing the N5-proximal Asn with Asp decreases the driving force for sq oxidation. However, this Asp alleviates the kinetic barrier, presumably by acting as a proton shuttle, because the sq in N386D CPD-PL oxidizes orders of magnitude more rapidly than wild type. These data clearly reveal, as suggested for plant CRYs, that an N5-proximal Asp can switch on proton transfer and modulate sq reactivity. However, the effect is context-dependent. More generally, we propose that PLs and CRYs tune the properties of their N5-proximal residue to adjust the extent of proton transfer, H-bonding patterns, and changes in protein conformation associated with electron transfer at the flavin."

Tight regulation of p53 is thus essential for the maintenance of genome integrity and normal cell proliferation. Previously, we reported that JFK, the only Kelch domain-containing F-box protein in human, promotes ubiquitination and degradation of p53 and that unlike the other E3 ligases for p53, all of which possess an intrinsic ubiquitin ligase activity, JFK destabilizes p53 through the assembly of a Skp1-Cul1-F-box complex. Here, we report that the substrate recognition by JFK requires phosphorylation of p53 in its central core region by CSN (COP9 signalosome)-associated kinase. Significantly, inhibition of CSN-associated kinase activity or knockdown of CSN5 impairs JFK-promoted p53 degradation, enhances p53-dependent transcription, and promotes cell growth suppression, G1 arrest, and apoptosis. Moreover, we showed that JFK is transcriptionally regulated by p53 and forms an auto-regulatory negative feedback loop with p53. These data may shed new light on the functional connection between CSN, Skp1-Cul1-F-box ubiquitin ligase, and p53 and provide a molecular mechanism for the regulation of JFK-promoted p53 degradation.

https://openalex.org/W1998942167,"Perturbed cell adhesion mechanisms are crucial for tumor invasion and metastasis. A cell adhesion protein, TSLC1 (tumor suppressor in lung cancer 1), is inactivated in a majority of metastatic cancers. DAL-1 (differentially expressed in adenocarcinoma of the lung protein), another tumor suppressor, binds through its FERM domain to the TSLC1 C-terminal, 4.1 glycophorin C-like, cytoplasmic domain. However, the molecular basis for this interaction is unknown. Here, we describe the crystal structure of a complex between the DAL-1 FERM domain and a portion of the TSLC1 cytoplasmic domain. DAL-1 binds to TSLC1 through conserved residues in a well defined hydrophobic pocket in the structural C-lobe of the DAL-1 FERM domain. From the crystal structure, it is apparent that Tyr(406) and Thr(408) in the TSLC1 cytoplasmic domain form the most important interactions with DAL-1, and this was also confirmed by surface plasmon resonance studies. Our results refute earlier exon deletion experiments that indicated that glycophorin C interacts with the α-lobe of 4.1 FERM domains."
https://openalex.org/W2031137786,"The human Eg5 (HsEg5) protein is unique in its sensitivity to allosteric agents even among phylogenetic kin. For example, S-trityl-l-cysteine (STC) and monastrol are HsEg5 inhibitors that bind to a surface pocket created by the L5 loop, but neither compound inhibits the Drosophila Kinesin-5 homologue (Klp61F). Herein we ask whether or not drug sensitivity can be designed into Klp61F. Two chimeric Klp61F motor domains were engineered, bacterially expressed, and purified to test this idea. We report that effector binding can elicit a robust allosteric response comparable with HsEg5 in both motor domain chimeras. Furthermore, isothermal titration calorimetry confirms that the Klp61F chimeras have de novo binding affinities for both STC and monastrol. These data show that the mechanism of intramolecular communication between the three ligand binding sites is conserved in the Kinesin-5 family, and reconstitution of a drug binding cassette within the L5 pocket is sufficient to restore allosteric inhibition. However, the two compounds were not equivalent in their allosteric inhibition. This surprising disparity in the response between the chimeras to monastrol and STC suggests that there is more than one allosteric communication network for these effectors."
https://openalex.org/W2035107475,"Human acute promyelocytic leukemia is causally linked to chromosomal translocations that generate chimeric retinoic acid receptor-α proteins (x-RARα fusions). Wild-type RARα is a transcription factor that binds to the SMRT/NCoR family of corepressors in the absence of hormone but releases from corepressor and binds coactivators in response to retinoic acid. In contrast, the x-RARα fusions are impaired for corepressor release and operate in acute promyelocytic leukemia as dominant-negative inhibitors of wild-type RARα. We report that the two most common x-RARα fusions, PML-RARα and PLZF-RARα, have gained the ability to recognize specific splice variants of SMRT and NCoR that are poorly recognized by RARα. These differences in corepressor specificity between the normal and oncogenic receptors are further magnified in the presence of a retinoid X receptor heteromeric partner. The ability of retinoids to fully release corepressor from PML-RARα differs for the different splice variants, a phenomenon relevant to the requirement for supraphysiological levels of this hormone in differentiation therapy of leukemic cells. We propose that this shift in the specificity of the x-RARα fusions to a novel repertoire of corepressors contributes to the dominant-negative and oncogenic properties of these oncoproteins and helps explain previously paradoxical aspects of their behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2045310201,"Early downstream responses of T lymphocytes following T cell antigen receptor (TCR) activation are mediated by protein complexes that assemble in domains of the plasma membrane. Using stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture and mass spectrometry, we quantitatively related the proteome of αCD3 immunoisolated native TCR signaling plasma membrane domains to that of control plasma membrane fragments not engaged in TCR signaling. Proteins were sorted according to their relative enrichment in isolated TCR signaling plasma membrane domains, identifying a complex protein network that is anchored in the vicinity of activated TCR. These networks harbor widespread mediators of plasma membrane-proximal T cell activities, including propagation, balancing, and attenuation of TCR signaling, immune synapse formation, as well as cytoskeletal arrangements relative to TCR activation clusters. These results highlight the unique potential of systematic characterizations of plasma membrane-proximal T cell activation proteome in the context of its native lipid bilayer platform."

We have investigated recruitment of U1 small nuclear ribonuclear protein (snRNP) by G1M2 and ISE and examined the effect of splice site strength, distance, and context on G run function. G1M2 is necessary for initial recruitment of U1snRNP to the DM20 5′ splice site independent of the strength of the splice site. G1M2 regulates E complex formation and supports DM20 splicing when functional U1snRNP is reduced. By contrast, the ISE is not required for the initial recruitment of U1snRNP to the PLP 5′ splice site.

Alternative splicing is broadly utilized to generate multiple protein isoforms from a single transcript in a cell- and development-dependent fashion. Genome-wide analyses have shown that alternatively spliced sites are generally weak and that flanking regulatory sequences orchestrate their selection through the interaction with auxiliary splicing factors (for review, see Refs. 1Black D.L.

Removal of introns from pre-mRNAs takes place within the spliceosome, a ribonuclear complex of RNA, and proteins whose assembly occurs in a stepwise fashion (reviewed in Refs. 3Brow D.A. Annu. Rev.

The first step is the formation of the commitment complex, or E complex, that contains the U1snRNP bound to the 5′ splice site, U2AF bound to the 3′ acceptor site and at least one member of the SR (serine arginine) proteins. The second step is the formation of the prespliceosome, termed complex A, characterized by the ATP-dependent addition of U2 snRNP. Next, U1 snRNP is replaced by U5 and U6 snRNPs, which base pair with the 5′ splice site, and the splicing reaction is completed (6Hwang D.Y. Cohen J.B.

U1snRNP is composed of the U1snRNA, U1-specific proteins (U1 70K, U1A, and U1C), and general Sm spliceosomal proteins that are also present in the U2, U5, and U6 snRNP complexes (8Green M.R. Annu.

The recognition of the 5′ splice site by the RNA moiety of the U1snRNP, through direct base pairing between the 5′ end of the U1snRNA and the 5′ splice site of the pre-RNA, commits the pre-RNA to splicing. However, in some genes, interactions other than direct base pairing of the U1snRNA with the 5′ splice site contribute significantly to the first step of splicing, and removal of the first 7 nucleotides of the U1snRNA does not prevent formation of the E complex (9Du H.

We have previously shown that hnRNPH and hnRNPF regulate the PLP/DM20 ratio mostly by recruitment of U1snRNP through G1 and M2 located downstream of the DM20 5′ splice site.

Collectively, the data suggest that G1M2 and ISE regulate DM20 and PLP 5′ splice site selection through different mechanisms. In the current study, we sought to gain additional insights into the mechanism of G1M2- and ISE-mediated regulation of 5′ splice site selection. We have examined whether G1M2 and ISE recruit U1snRNP to the DM20 and PLP 5′ splice sites by direct association with the U1snRNA and whether context, distance, and strength of the splice site influence the function of G-rich sequences to recruit U1snRNP, thereby regulating alternative splicing. We show that a direct interaction of U1snRNA with G1M2 plays a critical role in DM20 5′ splice site recognition and that this interaction does so independently from the strength of the splice site. G1M2 promotes E complex formation and supports DM20 splicing when functional U1snRNA is reduced. By contrast, the ISE is not required for the initial recruitment of U1snRNA to the PLP 5′ splice site, and its function in both U1snRNA recruitment and splicing is under complex regulation by gene context, position, and distance from the splice site. The data suggest that different mechanisms underlie G run-mediated recognition of 5′ splice sites and that context and position play a critical role.

Briefly, 2 units of RNase H and 10 μg of an oligonucleotide complementary to nucleotides 1–11 of the U1snRNA (GAACYYACCUG) (see Fig. 2A) were added to HeLa cell splicing competent extracts (100 μg) and incubated at 30 °C. The subsequent complex formation was initiated by adding biotinylated RNA templates for streptavidin bead precipitations. Primer extension was carried out using an oligonucleotide complementary to nucleotides 64–75 in loop 2 of the U1snRNA (CAUUGCACUCCG) (see Fig. 2A). The products were separated in 6% acrylamide, 6 m urea denaturing gels and visualized by autoradiography. The bands were quantified using National Institutes of Health Image J software package. HeLa cell splicing competent nuclear extracts were a generous gift from Dr. McCullough. The sequences of the RNA templates used for RNA affinity precipitations and primer extension are shown in Table 1. RNA affinity precipitations were performed with biotinylated RNA templates, as described previously (27Wang E. Cambi F. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 11194-11204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). All of the RNA templates were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., with the exception of PLPISE, which was synthesized by Dharmacon. Natural or RNase-treated HeLa extracts (100 μg) were incubated with 500 pmol of the biotinylated RNA templates under splicing conditions at 30 °C for 30 min followed by streptavidin bead precipitation (27Wang E. Cambi F. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 11194-11204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). RNA was extracted with phenol and chloroform, ethanol-precipitated, and subjected to primer extension. To ensure that binding reactions were carried out with excess template, we incubated 500 and 750 pmol of the ataxia telangectasia RNA template (see Table 1) (31Buratti E. Baralle M. De Conti L.

We show that 500 pmol of the template is in excess of the U1snRNA, and an extension product of similar intensity was detected with the higher concentration of template, indicating that differences in extension products quantitatively reflected the amount of U1snRNA bound to the template (supplemental Fig. S1A). For protein analysis, the RNA affinity precipitations were analyzed by Western blot with antibodies to hnRNPH (Bethyl Laboratories, Cambridge, MA), hnRNPF (rabbit polyclonal antibody, generous gift of Dr. Doug Black), U1A (Aviva Systems Biology, San Diego, CA), U170K (Abcam), and hnRNPL antibody (Abcam) diluted 1:2000 and reacted with ECL (Amersham Biosciences), as described previously (27Wang E. Cambi F. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 11194-11204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To ensure that the reactions were carried out with excess template, we incubated 500 and 750 pmol of PLPISE and DM20G1M2 with 50-μg HeLa extracts and performed Western blot with hnRNPL antibody (supplemental Fig. S1B).TABLE 1Sequences of the RNAsATM5′-UGGCCAGGUAAGUGAUAUAU-3′DM20ss5′-GCAACGGUAACAGG-3′DM20G1M2 (WT)5′-GAGCGCAACGGUAACAGGGGGCCAGAAGGGGAGGGGUUCCAGAGG-3′MT5′-GAGCGCAACGGUAACAUUUUUCCAGAAUUUUUUUUUUUCCAGAGG-3G1M25′-CAGGGGGCCAGAAGGGGAGGGGUU-3′G1MT5′-CAUUUUUCCAGAAGGGGAGGGGUU-3′M2MT5′-CAGGGGGCCAGAAUUUUUUUUUUU-3′PLPss5′-UCCCGACAAGgugaucauccucaggauu-3′PLPISE (WT)5′-UCCCGACAAGgugaucauccucaggauuuuguggcaauaacaaggggugggggaaaauuggg-3′ISE5′-uaacaaggggugggggaaa-3′ISEdel5′-UCCCGACAAGgugaucauccucaggauuuuguggcaa.....auuggg-3′ISEMT35′-uugcaaaagguacaugaaa-3′C → Ass5′-GCAAAGGUAACAGG-3′C → A-MT5′-GAGCGCAAAGGUAACAUUUUUCCAGAAUUUUUUUUUUUCCAGAGG-3′AU-MT5′-GAGCGCAAAGGUAAGUUUUUUCCAGAAUUUUUUUUUUUCCAGAGG-3′AUss5′-GCAAAGGUAAGUGG-3′C → A5′-GAGCGCAAAGGUAACAGGGGGCCAGAAGGGGAGGGGUUCCAGAGG-3′AU5′-GAGCGCAAAGGUAAGUGGGGGCCAGAAGGGGAGGGGUUCCAGAGG-3′GLO5′-GAGCGUCAAGGUGAGCGGGGGCCAGAAGGGGAGGGGUUCCAGAGG-3′PLPISE+65′-UCCCGACAAGgugaucggggugggggaaaauuggg-3′PLPISE+125′-UCCCGACAAGgugaucauccucggggugggggaaaauuggg-3′G1-ISE5′-GAGCGCAACGGUAACAGGGGGCAACAAGGGGUGGGGGAAAAGAGG-3′G1MT-ISE5′-GAGCGCAACGGUAACAUUUUUCAACAAGGGGUGGGGGAAAAGAGG-3′ Open table in a new tab Mutant PLP-neo constructs were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The sequences and schematics of all of the constructs are shown in Fig. 1. The minigene constructs used for in vitro splicing were generated in the single intron PY7NS minigene construct (kind gift of Dr. Buratti) (33Buratti E. Brindisi A. Pagani F. Baralle F.E. Am. J. Hum.

EMBO J. 2010; 29: 749-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We cloned the last 10 nucleotides of PLP exon 3A and exon 3B and the first 100 nucleotides of intron 3 into SmaI and NdeI restriction sites in the intron of the PY7NS construct. The primers used for PCR amplification of the PLP sequences in PLP-neo (WT) and G1M2MT (MT) (Fig. 1) (25Wang E. Dimova N. Cambi F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 4164-4178Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) are: forward primer: 5′-AAAGCTCCCGGGGAGCGCAACGGTAACAG-3′ (underlined is the SmaI site); and reverse primer: 5′-AAAGCTCATATGCCCCTAGAGAGGACCCAGCCT-3′ (underlined is the NdeI site). To generate minigene splicing constructs containing only the DM20 5′ss (DM20 WT and DM20 MT), the tropomyosin 5′ss and the PLP 5′ss were abolished by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All of the constructs were verified by sequencing. The custom-made double-stranded siRNA, siF/H (25Wang E. Dimova N. Cambi F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 4164-4178Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and Silencer® Negative Control 1 siRNA were purchased from Applied Biosystems (ABI, Foster City, CA). Oli-neu cells, an oligodendrocyte cell line, were cultured in SATO medium with 1% horse serum (25Wang E. Dimova N. Cambi F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 4164-4178Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and were co-transfected with plasmid DNAs (0.5 μg) and siRNAs (80 nm) using the siPORT amine transfection agent according to the reversed transfection protocol (ABI, Foster City, CA) (25Wang E. Dimova N. Cambi F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 4164-4178Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and was treated with the DNA-free kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription was performed with 1 μg of total RNA using random hexamer primer mixture according to the manufacturer's instructions (ABI, Foster City, CA). The PCR products derived from the wild type, and mutated PLP-neo constructs were amplified using a primer set described previously (Fig. 1) (25Wang E. Dimova N. Cambi F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 4164-4178Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 29Wang E. Huang Z. Hobson G.M. Dimova N. Sperle K. McCullough A. Cambi F. J. Cell Biochem. 2006; 97: 999-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In vitro splicing reactions were carried out in 30% nuclear extract containing SP6 generated 32P-labeled RNA transcripts as the template, 1.0 mm ATP, 20 mm creatine phosphate, 3.2 mm MgCl2. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for a determined time course indicated in figure legends. Following incubation, the reactions were digested with proteinase K, phenol chloroform-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, resolved on 6% denaturing PAGE, and analyzed by Phosphor Imager analysis (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The percentage spliced is defined as mol of spliced product/(mol unspliced product + mol spliced product). To derive kinetic rate constants, the percentage spliced/time was fit to a first order rate description for product appearance. The background was determined individually for each lane. Reactions for in vitro complex formation were carried out as described (35Lim S.R. Hertel K.J. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 477-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), based on the protocol of Das and Reed (36Das R. Reed R. RNA. 1999; 5: 1504-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and incubated at 30 °C for a determined time course indicated in figure legends. All E complex reactions were fractionated on 1.75% low melt agarose gels using a 50 mm Tris, 50 mm glycine, pH 7.5 running buffer. Time points were loaded onto a running gel, causing a slight but apparent retardation of E complex at later time points. Analysis was carried out as described in the in vitro splicing section. Selective targeting of U1 snRNA was carried out via RNase H digestion with a U1 snRNA complementary DNA oligonucleotide. RNase H-mediated depletion of functional U1 snRNA was carried out in 1.5 mm ATP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 1.6 mm MgCl2, 40 mm anti-snRNA DNA oligonucleotides, and 93% nuclear extract at 30 °C for 30 min. This treatment resulted in nuclear extract with significantly decreased splicing efficiency. The depleted extracts were then used to carry out splicing reactions at identical experimental conditions as described above. Control extract was also made by carrying out the same reaction with water in place of the DNA oligonucleotide. The sequence of DNA oligonucleotide used was 5′-GCCAGGTAAGTAT-3′ (against U1 snRNA). To determine whether a direct interaction between G1M2 and the U1snRNA contributes to the recognition of the DM20 5′ splice site (DM20ss), we have incubated a biotinylated DM20G1M2 RNA template (WT) with splicing competent HeLa nuclear extracts either untreated or RNase H-treated for oligonucleotide-targeted removal of the 5′ end of the U1snRNA (nucleotide 1–11) (Fig. 2A). The WT substrate and associated U1snRNA were precipitated with streptavidin beads (27Wang E. Cambi F. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 11194-11204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and the U1snRNA was measured by primer extension using an oligonucleotide specific for nucleotides 64–75 in loop 2 of the U1snRNA. We first ascertained that the digestion of U1snRNA by RNase H was complete by measuring U1snRNA extracted from treated and untreated nuclear extracts (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 1 and 2). A single extension product, shorter than the product from the untreated extracts, was detected from RNase H-treated extracts, thus indicating that the 5′ end of U1snRNA had been removed. Both cleaved and uncleaved U1snRNAs bound the WT RNA with similar intensities, indicating that the association of U1snRNA is largely independent of base pairing with the 5′ss (Fig. 2B, lanes 5 and 6). A strong U1snRNA product was detected in uncleaved extract incubated with ataxia telangectasia, used as control RNA (Table 1), which strongly base pairs with the U1snRNA 5′ end (32Pagani F. Buratti E. Stuani C. Bendix R. Dörk T. Baralle F.E. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 426-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 34Dhir A. Buratti E. van Santen M.A. Luhrmann R. Baralle F.E. EMBO J. 2010; 29: 749-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 37Buratti E. Muro A.F. Giombi M. Gherbassi D. Iaconcig A. Baralle F.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 1387-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), whereas no product was detected in the cleaved extract (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4). To determine whether G1M2 recruits U1snRNA to WT, we have measured the association of U1snRNA with the DM20 5′ss alone (DM20ss) and with an RNA, in which both G1 and M2 have been replaced by polyU (MT) (Table 1) (Fig. 3A) (27Wang E. Cambi F. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 11194-11204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Significantly less U1snRNA was associated with DM20ss and MT in the uncleaved extract compared with WT, 15 and 20%, respectively (Fig. 3A, compare lane 1 with lanes 2 and 6), whereas U1snRNA was barely detectable in cleaved extract (Fig. 3A, lanes 8 and 12). Cleaved and uncleaved U1snRNA were associated with G1M2 RNA, indicating that U1snRNA interacts with G1M2 independently of its 5′ end (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 9). The intensity of the extension product from G1M2 is slightly lower than that of WT, consistent with base pairing of the U1snRNA with the DM20 5′ss in WT (Fig. 3A, compare lane 3 with lane 1). Mutations of either G1 (G1MT) or M2 (M2MT) nearly abolished the association of cleaved and uncleaved U1snRNA with the RNA (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 4 and 5 with lane 3, and lanes 10 and 11 with lane 9). The fairly equal contribution of G1 and M2 to U1snRNA binding is in keeping with in vivo splicing results, which showed equal contribution of G1 and M2 to the regulation of the PLP/DM20 ratio (27Wang E. Cambi F. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 11194-11204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Next, we examined the assembly of hnRNPH/F and specific spliceosomal proteins onto G1MT, M2MT, and DM20ss compared with WT and G1M2 (Fig. 3B). U1A and U1 70K were detected in affinity precipitates with G1M2 similarly to WT (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 2), whereas they were hardly detected in precipitates with DM20ss and M2MT and were greatly reduced with G1MT (Fig. 3B, compare lane 5 with lane 1 and lanes 3 and 4 with lane 2), in keeping with the primer extension data. hnRNPH and hnRNPF were decreased by ∼50% in precipitates with G1MT and M2MT compared with G1M2, suggesting that hnRNPH/F interact with each G run with similar affinity. Interestingly, SF2/ASF was greatly reduced in precipitates with M2MT compared with G1MT and correlated with the near absence of U1A and U170K (Fig. 3B, compare lane 4 with lane 3). The data indicate that G1 and M2 are both required for recruitment of U1snRNA; however, M2 may have a greater impact on the assembly of U1-specific spliceosomal proteins, possibly through binding of SF2/ASF. The G run class of enhancers is highly conserved downstream of 5′ splice sites, and their activity is highest for splice sites of intermediate strength (4–8 bits), suggesting functional conservation (19Xiao X. Wang Z. Jang M. Nutiu R. Wang E.T. Burge C.B. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 1094-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, the DM20 and the PLP 5′ss are of intermediate strength, 5.4 and 6.8 bits, respectively (28Hobson G.M. Huang Z. Sperle K. Sistermans E. Rogan P.K. Garbern J.Y. Kolodny E. Naidu S. Cambi F. Hum. Mutat. 2006; 27: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Importantly, PLP and DM20 5′ss strength contributes to the PLP/DM20 ratio in vivo, and a disease-associated mutation, predicted to strengthen the DM20 5′ss, increases DM20 splicing (28Hobson G.M. Huang Z. Sperle K. Sistermans E. Rogan P.K. Garbern J.Y. Kolodny E. Naidu S. Cambi F. Hum. Mutat. 2006; 27: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, we sought to determine whether increasing the strength of the DM20 5′ss reduces its dependence on G1M2. To test this, we have: 1) replaced the DM20 5′ss in WT with two strong 5′ss (>8 bits): the α-globin exon 2 (11McCullough A.J. Berget S.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 9225-9235Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) (GLO) and a canonical 5′ss (AU) (38Lynch K.W. Weiss A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24341-24347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) (Table 1) and 2) changed C → A at −2 in the DM20 5′ss (Table 1) (C → A), predicted to increase the strength of the splice site to 7.4 bits (28Hobson G.M. Huang Z. Sperle K. Sistermans E. Rogan P.K. Garbern J.Y. Kolodny E. Naidu S. Cambi F. Hum. Mutat. 2006; 27: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). U1snRNA bound to each template with similar intensity in uncleaved and cleaved extracts (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 1–3 with lanes 4–6), indicating that, in the presence of G1M2, recruitment of U1snRNA to the strengthened 5′ss is independent of U1snRNA base pairing with the splice site. The association of uncleaved U1snRNA to templates containing only the AUss and C → Ass or AU and C → A in the MT RNA (AU-MT and C → A-MT) (Table 1) (Fig. 4B, compare lane 2 with lane 1 and lane 4 with lane 3) was proportional to the predicted strength of the 5′ss. Cleaved U1snRNA was drastically reduced (Fig. 4B, lanes 5–8), consistent with base pairing of the 5′ end of U1snRNA with the 5′ss in these RNAs. Together, these data show that, in the presence of G1M2, recruitment of U1snRNA is largely independent of the 5′ss strength. To directly test the functional relationship of G1M2 and the 5′ss strength in vivo, we have replaced the DM20 5′ss with the AUss (AU) (Figs. 1 and 4C) in the PLP-neo minigene. In addition, we have replaced the DM20 5′ss with AU, GLO, and C → A in the MT minigene construct, in which both G1M2 are replaced by polyT (27Wang E. Cambi F. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 11194-11204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) (Figs. 1 and 4C). The PLP/DM20 ratio derived from the AU is much lower (<0.01) than from WT (0.34), consistent with the increased 5′ss strength (Fig. 4C). The C → A was previously shown to decrease the PLP/DM20 ratio, consistent with the predicted greater 5′ss strength (28Hobson G.M. Huang Z. Sperle K. Sistermans E. Rogan P.K. Garbern J.Y. Kolodny E. Naidu S. Cambi F. Hum. Mutat. 2006; 27: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The PLP/DM20 ratio derived from AU-MT, GLO-MT, and C → A-MT is very low (<0.01) compared with MT (3.99 ± 0.98), reflecting the increased strength of the 5′ss (Fig. 4C). The data suggest that, although recruitment of the U1snRNA by G1M2 is largely independent of the 5′ splice site strength, DM20 splicing in vivo is strongly influenced by the 5′ss strength and is rescued by a strong 5′ss in the absence of G1M2, possibly through spliceosomal interactions at later stages of the sp"
https://openalex.org/W2081341596,"Polysialic acid is an anti-adhesive glycan that modifies a select group of mammalian proteins. The primary substrate of the polysialyltransferases (polySTs) is the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). Polysialic acid negatively regulates cell adhesion, is required for proper brain development, and is expressed in specific areas of the adult brain where it promotes on-going cell migration and synaptic plasticity. The first fibronectin type III repeat (FN1) of NCAM is required for polysialylation of the N-glycans on the adjacent immunoglobulin-like domain (Ig5), and acidic residues on the surface of FN1 play a role in polyST recognition. Recent work demonstrated that the FN1 domain from the unpolysialylated olfactory cell adhesion molecule (OCAM) was able to partially replace NCAM FN1 (Foley, D. A., Swartzentruber, K. G., Thompson, M. G., Mendiratta, S. S., and Colley, K. J. (2010) J. Biol. Chem. 285, 35056-35067). Here we demonstrate that individually replacing three identical regions shared by NCAM and OCAM FN1, (500)PSSP(503) (PSSP), (526)GGVPI(530) (GGVPI), and (580)NGKG(583) (NGKG), dramatically reduces NCAM polysialylation. In addition, we show that the polyST, ST8SiaIV/PST, specifically binds NCAM and that this binding requires the FN1 domain. Replacing the FN1 PSSP sequences and the acidic patch residues decreases NCAM-polyST binding, whereas replacing the GGVPI and NGKG sequences has no effect. The location of GGVPI and NGKG in loops that flank the Ig5-FN1 linker and the proximity of PSSP to this linker suggest that GGVPI and NGKG sequences may be critical for stabilizing the Ig5-FN1 linker, whereas PSSP may play a dual role maintaining the Ig5-FN1 interface and a polyST recognition site."
https://openalex.org/W2022075301,"The tip-growing pollen tube is a useful model for studying polarized cell growth in plants. We previously characterized LePRK2, a pollen-specific receptor-like kinase from tomato (1). Here, we showed that LePRK2 is present as multiple phosphorylated isoforms in mature pollen membranes. Using comparative sequence analysis and phosphorylation site prediction programs, we identified two putative phosphorylation motifs in the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane (JM) domain. Site-directed mutagenesis in these motifs, followed by transient overexpression in tobacco pollen, showed that both motifs have opposite effects in regulating pollen tube length. Relative to LePRK2-eGFP pollen tubes, alanine substitutions in residues of motif I, Ser(277)/Ser(279)/Ser(282), resulted in longer pollen tubes, but alanine substitutions in motif II, Ser(304)/Ser(307)/Thr(308), resulted in shorter tubes. In contrast, phosphomimicking aspartic substitutions at these residues gave reciprocal results, that is, shorter tubes with mutations in motif I and longer tubes with mutations in motif II. We conclude that the length of pollen tubes can be negatively and positively regulated by phosphorylation of residues in motif I and II respectively. We also showed that LePRK2-eGFP significantly decreased pollen tube length and increased pollen tube tip width, relative to eGFP tubes. The kinase activity of LePRK2 was relevant for this phenotype because tubes that expressed a mutation in a lysine essential for kinase activity showed the same length and width as the eGFP control. Taken together, these results suggest that LePRK2 may have a central role in pollen tube growth through regulation of its own phosphorylation status."
