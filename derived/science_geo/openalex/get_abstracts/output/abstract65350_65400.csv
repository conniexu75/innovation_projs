https://openalex.org/W1578349954,"Abstract Two routes of putrescine biosynthesis exist in Escherichia coli both emanating from the latter portion of the arginine-biosynthetic pathway. Isotope competition experiments indicate that both arginine and ornithine can give rise to putrescine. The formation of putrescine from ornithine is independent of the conversion of the latter to arginine. The decarboxylation of ornithine to yield putrescine is catalyzed by cell-free preparations. This enzyme has been termed ornithine decarboxylase to distinguish it from the inducible degradative ornithine decarboxylase, from which it differs in many properties. Cell-free extracts also carry out the conversion of arginine to putrescine. In this pathway, the arginine carboxyl group is first released as CO2, and the amidine group is then removed as urea. The arginine decarboxylase has optimal activity at pH 8 and an absolute magnesium ion requirement. Both of these characteristics distinguish it from the catabolic arginine decarboxylase. Agmatine ureohydrolase, the enzyme catalyzing the second step of this pathway, is also present in cell-free extracts. Arginine biosynthesis in E. coli involves a branched pathway, the branch point to putrescine and arginine occurring at ornithine. The existence of two pathways of putrescine biosynthesis is interpreted in relation to control mechanisms of the arginine biosynthetic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1622205958,"The ability of Escherichia coli W2244 to concentrate methyl-β-thiogalactoside and methyl-α-glucoside was substantially reduced when the cells were subjected to osmotic shock. The shocked cells contained only a fraction of their normal content of a heat-stable protein, previously characterized as a component of a phosphotransferase system. When the shocked cells were incubated with the purified heat-stable protein, the ability to accumulate the glycosides was restored. The results suggest that the phosphotransferase system may be an important component of the glycoside permease systems."
https://openalex.org/W2058675616,"Fluorescein labeled antibodies to protein- polysaccharides from rat and calf cartilage were used for the histochemical localization of protein- poly saccharide in epiphyseal cartilage. There was less protein- polysaccharide in the zone of provisional calcification than in the proliferating and maturing zones, and none was demonstrable in the metaphysis. During or just preceding cal cification, protein- polysaccharide or its protein component is lost or drastically altered."
https://openalex.org/W148800190,"Abstract In Escherichia coli B the enzymatic reductions of cytidine diphosphate and uridine diphosphate require four different protein fractions (thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase, Enzyme B1, and Enzyme B2), reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide, and magnesium ions. Both reactions are stimulated by different nucleoside triphosphates, in particular adenosine triphosphate and deoxythymidine triphosphate. dTTP (apparent Km value in CDP reduction, 1.5 x 10-6 m) is effective at much lower concentrations than ATP (apparent Km value in CDP reduction, 0.7 x 10-4 m), but the same maximal velocity is attained with both nucleotides. The simultaneous addition of ATP and dTTP results in a rather complex type of inhibition. dATP strongly inhibits both reactions. The inhibition is reversed by ATP but not by dTTP. The different nucleoside triphosphates are considered to act as allosteric effectors in the reduction of pyrimidine ribonucleoside diphosphates. CDP and UDP inhibit the reduction of each other in a competitive manner, an indication that the same enzyme is involved in both reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1487476958,"The ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase system from Escherichia coli B, which catalyzes the reductive formation of deoxycytidine diphosphate and deoxyuridine diphosphate from CDP and UDP, also catalyzed the corresponding reductions of adenosine diphosphate and guanosine diphosphate. Evidence was obtained that the identical highly purified proteins (Enzymes B1 and B2, thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase) participated in all four reactions. Under optimal conditions the maximal velocity with each substrate was of about the same magnitude. The specificity of the enzyme system was strongly influenced by different nucleoside triphosphates. ATP, which stimulated the reductions of pyrimidine ribonucleotides, had little effect on the reductions of purine ribonucleotides. Rather, these reactions were stimulated by deoxythymidine triphosphate and dGTP, dTTP being the somewhat better stimulator for GDP reduction, and dGTP for ADP reduction. dATP strongly inhibited both reactions, and this inhibition was reversed by ATP but not by dTTP. According to our present interpretation the different nucleotides act as allosteric effectors, stabilizing certain states of one or several of the enzymes and thereby determining the substrate specificity. Thus ATP stabilizes a state favorable for the reduction of pyrimidine ribonucleotides; dGTP, a state favorable for purine ribonucleotides; and dTTP, a state favorable for both types of nucleotides. dATP stabilizes an inactive state of the enzyme. The simultaneous presence of ATP and dTTP results in a relative inhibition which is much more pronounced with pyrimidine ribonucleotides than with purine ribonucleotides. These effects may form the basis of a physiological mechanism responsible for a balanced supply of the substrates required for the enzymatic synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1570144631,"Abstract Cytochrome b562 (Escherichia coli) was obtained from E. coli B cells by sonic oscillation of the cell paste or by extraction of acetone-dried cell powders. The purification of cytochrome b562 was carried out with calcium phosphate gel-cellulose and diethylaminoethyl cellulose column chromatography. Crystallization of the hemoprotein was accomplished in 70 to 80% saturated ammonium sulfate. The oxidized form of cytochrome b562 crystallizes as needles. The reduced form crystallizes in a hexagonal form. The heme prosthetic group of cytochrome b562 is iron-protoporphyrin IX. Cytochrome b562 has absorption bands at 562, 531.5, 427, and 324 mµ in the reduced form and 418 and 363 mµ in the oxidized form. Only a weak shoulder was observed in the 280 mµ region. The ratio of ϵ562 (reduced): ϵ280 (oxidized) is 1.5. The α-band shifts from 562 to 558 mµ at liquid nitrogen temperature and does not split. The apoprotein has an absorption peak at 277 mµ and combines with protohemin to reconstitute the original cytochrome. The oxidation-reduction potential (E'0) of cytochrome b562 is 113 mv. The sedimentation constant (s20,w) of cytochrome b562 is 1.64 S. The diffusion coefficient (D) of cytochrome b562 is 11.9 x 10-7 cm2 sec-1. The minimal molecular weight of cytochrome b562 based on an analysis of the ratio of heme to dry weight is 12,000. The molecular weight of cytochrome b562 based on hydrodynamic measurements is 11,700 to 12,700. The molecular weight of cytochrome b562 based on the summation of heme plus amino acid residues is 11,954. The amino acid composition of cytochrome b562 is Lys11, His2, Arg4, Asp16, Thr6, Ser3, Glu14, Pro5, Gly4, Ala15, Val5, Met2, Ile3, Leu9, Tyr2, Phe2, and ammonia11. Cytochrome b562 does not contain cysteine, cystine, or tryptophan residues."

This preparation also catalyzes the formation of lysophosphatidic and phosphatidic acids from glycerol 3-phosphate and palmityl coenzyme A.
https://openalex.org/W1521367490,"Uptake processes for 1,4-diaminobutane, spermidine, and spermine have been studied in Escherichia coli. The uptake systems can be divided into two components. One is a rapid adsorption that is not dependent on active metabolic processes, and can be observed at 0° as well as at 37°. The adsorbed amine can be largely removed by washing the bacteria with the nonradioactive amine or with salt-containing media. The amount of the adsorbed amine was less than 1% of the added amine for 1,4-diaminobutane, 3 to 5% for spermidine, and 7 to 15% for spermine. The second is a larger, time-dependent component which depends on metabolic processes, does not occur at 0°, and is markedly decreased by the omission of glucose or by the addition of dinitrophenol. The accumulated amines cannot be removed by washing the bacteria with solutions of the nonradioactive amines; they are released, however, by treatment of the bacteria with toluene or butanol-1. Studies are also reported on the effect of pH, concentration, and inhibitors on these systems."

Renal transplants in dogs treated with this antiserum survived for long periods, two of the grafts surviving beyond 350 days with normal function and histologic appearance."
https://openalex.org/W1543477124,"Acetyl coenzyme A-acyl carrier protein transacylase (acetyl transacylase) and malonyl coenzyme A-acyl carrier protein transacylase (malonyl transacylase) have been purified 90- and 255-fold, respectively, from Escherichia coli extracts and exhibited the following properties. Acetyl transacylase is heat-labile whereas malonyl transacylase is comparatively heat-stable, 80% of its activity surviving for 20 min at 80°. Both enzymes have pH optima in the region of 6.5. The reactions are readily reversible, and equilibrium constants are 2.09 for acetyl transacylase and 2.33 for malonyl transacylase. Inhibition of the enzymes by N-ethylmaleimide and iodoacetamide demonstrates that both are sulfhydryl enzymes. Acetyl transacylase is relatively specific for acetyl-CoA but can transacylate coenzyme A esters of propionic, butyric, and hexanoic acids at a rate of 23.4, 9.8, and 4.5% that of acetyl-CoA, respectively. Evidence is presented in support of a mechanism of action of acetyl transacylase involving the intermediary formation of an acetyl—S—enzyme which can then transfer the acetyl group to acyl carrier protein or coenzyme A."

https://openalex.org/W1651552772,"The growth of Escherichia coli cells in rich, thymine-containing medium was stopped by the addition of trimethoprim, an inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase. In an extract of these cells (supernatant from an extract centrifuged at 30,000g) amino acid incorporation at 0.005M magnesium-ion concentration, directed by f2 bacteriophage RNA depended strictly on added formylmethionyl-transfer RNA or N5-formyltetrahydrofolate. Hydroxylamine inhibited the amino acid incorporation directed by f2 bacteriophage RNA, when N5-formyltetrahydrofolate had been added, but had no effect when formylmethionyl-transfer RNA had been added."
https://openalex.org/W1655277821,Abstract Cytidine monophosphate 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate synthetase catalyzes the reversible formation of cytidine monophosphate 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate from cytidine triphosphate and 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate. The synthetase has been purified approximately 170-fold from crude extracts of Escherichia coli 0111-B4. The purified enzyme exhibits an absolute requirement for a divalent cation (Mg++) and is specific for cytidine triphosphate (Km = 2.2 x 10-4 M) and 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate (Km = 8 x 10-4 M).
https://openalex.org/W1558278081,Abstract The conversion of 14C-glycerol 3-phosphate to lysophosphatidic acid in the presence of palmityl coenzyme A is catalyzed by particles plus a soluble protein fraction from sonic extracts of Clostridium butyricum. This conversion is markedly stimulated by the addition of 10-5 M acyl carrier protein isolated from Escherichia coli.
https://openalex.org/W1583450622,"Abstract A large sample of highly purified phenylalanine transfer ribonucleic acid from Escherichia coli B was prepared by reversed phase chromatography followed by gel filtration to remove ribonucleic acid contaminants of higher molecular weight. The phenylalanine acceptance and terminal adenosine content of this sample were identical, indicating that the sample was all active phenylalanine transfer ribonucleic acid. An independent measurement of purity obtained on a weight basis gave a minimum value of 83%. Preliminary data indicate that the phenylalanine transfer ribonucleic acid molecular weight is approximately 26,000."
https://openalex.org/W2054212906,"Mutants isolated as sucrose-dependent include many with apparent envelope defects, which fact often leads to filamentous growth or lysis in the absence of sucrose. One mutant can grow exponentially in 4 percent sucrose, but is very fragile: it releases all of its RNA and soluble protein when treated with 0.5 percent sodium deoxycholate. These characteristics permit the study of unstable structures and rapid processes in actively growing cells."
https://openalex.org/W1530558050,"Abstract The α-hydrazino analogue of histidine was found to be an effective inhibitor of the growth of Salmonella typhimurium wild type as well as Escherichia coli W and E. coli K-12. A mutant, hisP1650, which is resistant to the inhibitory action of the compound was isolated and found to be defective in the histidine-specific transport system. The hydrazino analogue reacts rapidly with pyridoxal phosphate in a nonenzymatic reaction to give a product which does not have the spectral properties expected of a hydrazone. The analogue inactivates several pyridoxal phosphate enzymes. Evidence is presented suggesting that the primary point of inhibition in the cell is the pyridoxal phosphate moiety of acetylornithine transaminase in the pathway of arginine biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2063584606,"The incorporation of glycine-C(14), leucine-C(14), and adenine-C(14) into the respective protein and nucleic acid fractions of Escherichia coli K-12 is markedly affected by application of moderately high hydrostatic pressure. Presure application may result in either stimulation or inhibition of incorporation depending on the temperature."

https://openalex.org/W1511379608,"Abstract The soluble amino acid incorporation system from Escherichia coli was fractionated by density gradient centrifugation and was shown to contain aminoacyl soluble ribonucleic acid (S-RNA) transfer factor, aminoacyl S-RNA synthetase, and acceptor molecules which accept amino acids from aminoacyl S-RNA, but direct evidence that aminoacyl S-RNA transfer factor participates in the soluble system is still lacking. The acceptor molecules are shown to be present also on the ribosomes. Thus the 14C-leucine or 14C-phenylalanine-labeled product of the soluble system was identical with the major product of the ribosomal system obtained in the absence of added messenger RNA. The product of the soluble amino acid incorporation system was digested by trypsin and subjected to paper chromatography and paper electrophoresis. At least four different radioactive components were obtained by these procedures. When 14C-leucine and 14C-phenylalanine are incorporated by the ribosomal system, without of messenger RNA, the major portion of the incorporated amino acids had free amino groups which were revealed by the dinitrofluoro-benzene technique for NH2-terminal analysis. This observation suggests that even with the conventional ribosomal system, if the incorporation was studied in the absence of added messenger, the major portion of 14C-leucine and 14C-phenylalanine incorporation is an of amino acid to the NH2 group of a preformed acceptor or to a lysine NH2 group in the internal linkage. This incorporation is tentatively called NH2-group addition to distinguish it from the usual incorporation representing a chain elongation through successive of amino acid at the COOH-terminal end. The NH2 group involving ribosomes is dependent on aminoacyl S-RNA, soluble enzymes, and the acceptor substance on ribosomes. It was sensitive to RNase and puromycin but was not dependent on added guanosine triphosphate or messenger RNA. Some release of radioactive product takes place from the ribosomes during the incorporation reaction."

https://openalex.org/W1534099938,"Abstract An alkaline phosphatase-negative mutant of Escherichia coli has been found to synthesize a cross-reacting material that is deficient in zinc. Addition of zinc ions to the purified inactive protein leads to enzyme with activity that is 20% that of wild type enzyme. Activation consists of the binding of metal to the dimer form of this protein and is accompanied by changes in the spectral properties of the enzyme. Phosphate ions greatly stimulate this activation and, in growing cultures of a constitutive strain of this mutant, are shown to suppress the phenotypic expression of the structural gene mutation."
https://openalex.org/W1602009701,"Abstract A method is presented for the purification of the isomerase catalyzing the fourth step of histidine biosynthesis in Salmonella typhimurium. The enzyme was isolated from extracts of histidine auxotrophs which (when derepressed) produced 25 to 30 times the wild type levels of enzyme. The purification procedure involved fractionation with protamine sulfate and ammonium sulfate, gel filtration on Sephadex G-100, ion exchange chromatography on diethylaminoethyl Sephadex, and continuous flow high voltage electrophoresis. The final product is homogeneous with respect to size, with a weight average molecular weight of 29,000, but is composed of three enzymically active forms (in the ratio 90:9:1) which may be distinguished by their differing electrophoretic mobilities in alkaline polyacrylamide gels."
https://openalex.org/W1505019640,"Abstract The soluble protein of Escherichia coli B was separated into six approximately equal fractions by precipitation with ammonium sulfate. These six fractions were further fractionated by chromatography with diethylaminoethyl cellulose. The chromatographic effluents were assayed for deoxyribonuclease activity with native deoxyribonucleic acid, heat-denatured DNA, and deoxyribo-oligonucleotides as substrates. This fractionation procedure separated five chromatographically distinct deoxyribonucleases from E. coli. Three of the enzymes have been previously described and were identified by their published properties. Endonuclease I was identified by its marked inhibition in the presence of soluble RNA, exonuclease I by its ability to degrade heat-denatured DNA, and exonuclease II by the DNA polymerase activity with which it is associated. Two distinct fractions with deoxyribo-oligonucleotidase activity were also separated from E. coli extract. These two oligonucleotidases, which we have termed exonuclease IV-A and exonuclease IV-B, are distinguished from the nucleases previously described by their ability to catalyze the release of acid-soluble products from oligonucleotides 20 times more rapidly than from either native or heat-denatured DNA. The two oligonucleotidases also cleave dinucleotides. Both enzymes produce 5'-mononucleotide products and are optimally active in alkaline solution. Although similar with respect to enzymatic properties, exonucleases IV-A and IV-B separate widely on diethylaminoethyl cellulose chromatography and rechromatography of either enzyme under a variety of conditions gives a single peak of enzymatic activity."

https://openalex.org/W1556756761,"Abstract A method has been developed for separating α-acetyllysine oligopeptides from e-acetylated contaminants by chromatography on carboxymethyl cellulose columns with buffered eluents. An Escherichia coli lysine auxotroph will utilize α-acetyltrilysine as a source of lysine, but will not utilize α-acetyl- di- or α-acetyltetralysine. It was concluded that the nutritional ineffectiveness of α-acetylated di- and tetralysine is due to an inability to penetrate the cell envelope. Growth on α-acetyltrilysine was a linear function of time, and growth rate was dependent on the concentration of the acetylated tripeptide. It was therefore concluded that α-acetyltrilysine limits the availability of lysine to the E. coli auxotroph. This property was used to study derepression in the lysine pathway. The pyruvate-aspartic semialdehyde-condensing enzyme and the diaminopimelate epimerase concentrations in cells grown on α-acetyltrilysine increased to a considerably lesser extent than dihydrodipicolinic acid reductase, indicating a lack of coordinate repression in the lysine pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2050030191,Ultraviolet-induced pyrimidine dimer formation in DNA and polyuridylic acid was inhibited on irradiation at 77 degrees K. Enhancement of thymine dimer formation in solutions of DNA occurred upon addition of ethylene glycol. Low temperature measurements of absorbance of polyuridylic acid at low temperature showed that no significant alteration of the residues occurred after irradiation at 77 degrees K and before thawing.

Other nucleotide-linked sugars were isolated from this organism and tentatively identified as cytidine diphosphate abequose, cytidine diphosphate glucose, uridine diphosphate glucose, uridine diphosphate galactose, deoxythymidine diphosphate rhamnose, adenosine diphosphate hexose, and guanosine diphosphate mannose."

https://openalex.org/W1439331151,"Abstract To obtain further information about the role of bacterial peptidases in vivo, the enzymic activity of Escherichia coli strain K-12 was studied. The substrates were four glycine-containing dipeptides in which the other amino acid was either l-leucine or l-phenylalanine, and the bacteria were harvested from cultures that varied in age from 24 hours (young cultures) to 144 hours (fully aged cultures). The specific enzymic activity of broken cell preparations toward a given substrate remains constant regardless of the age of the bacterial culture, but the relative activity (measured under the same conditions) increases in the following order: glycylleucine, glycylphenylalanine, leucylglycine, phenylalanylglycine. On the other hand, intact cells from young cultures show equal specific activity for the four substrates. This activity decreases in parallel during aging of the cultures, reaching a minimal level in about 72 hours when the pH of the culture is allowed to fall below about 6.0; at pH values nearer neutrality, the decrease in activity is less complete and occurs less rapidly. The peptidase activity of whole cell preparations is comparable to that of broken cell preparations only with glycylleucine as substrate; even with this substrate full enzymic activity is seen only with intact bacteria from young cultures. The enzymic activity of intact bacteria toward the other substrates represents only a fraction of the activity observed in broken cell preparations. The significance of these results is discussed, and it is concluded that the low specific activity of resting cells is not explicable in terms of the differential permeability of bacteria to the dipeptides."

https://openalex.org/W2413253781,"Abstract The relationship in vitro of the enzyme polyriboadenylate polymerase to ribonucleoprotein particles was investigated. The enzyme was predominantly bound to 70 S ribosomes in solutions containing 10 mM MgCl2, and to 50 S ribosomes in 1 mM and 0.1 mM MgCl2. Little if any enzymic activity was found associated with 100 S ribosomes. Dissociation of the enzyme from ribosomes in low concentrations of MgCl2 was reversible. Purified polyriboadenylate polymerase was also found to bind to 70 S, 50 S, and 30 S particles. The polyriboadenylate product of the reaction catalyzed by the ribosomal enzyme was bound to ribonucleoprotein particles in a rapidly sedimenting complex. With increasing time of incubation the sedimentation rate of this complex increased. After 5 min, it was about 130 S; 20 min, 190 S; and 60 min, greater than 300 S. This increase in sedimentation velocity of the polyriboadenylate-ribosome complex appeared to be due to aggregation of polyriboadenylate rather than to chain prolongation; the average polymer size between 5 to 60 min of incubation remained constant at approximately 200 adenylate units. The sedimentation coefficient of polyriboadenylate dissociated from ribosomes in 0.1 mM MgCl2 was 5 to 8 S. The rapid sedimentation of the complex was not changed by pancreatic ribonuclease, but after limited incubation with micrococcal nuclease, polyriboadenylate sedimented with 70 to 100 S ribosomes. Although less than 1% of total ribosomes was present in the polyriboadenylate-ribosome complex, these ribosomes were associated with most of the enzymic activity."

The synthetic product contained all of the eight possible isomers. These were separated into four racemic pairs with the use of aromatic sulfonic acids as precipitants. One of the racemic pairs was found to support the growth of an α, ϵ-diaminopimelic acid-requiring auxotroph of Escherichia coli, strain 173-25, in a synthetic medium containing L-lysine but devoid of α, ϵ-diaminopimelic acid. It was also shown that cells grown on this racemic pair contained β-hydroxy-α, ϵ-diaminopimelic acid, but not α, ϵ-diaminopimelic acid, in the mucopeptide layer of the cell wall."
https://openalex.org/W2035346169,"When the histidine Operon in Salmonella typhimurium becomes derepressed in the presence of 4-amino-5-imidazole carboxamide ribonucleoside, derepression of the enzymes for histidine biosynthesis Occurs in a temporal sequence which corresponds with the positional sequence of the genes in the histidine Operon, approximately 20 minutes intervening between the derepression of the first and that of the last enzyme studied. In the case of the deletion mutant, hisH,B22, the interval between the derepression of the first and that of the last enzyme was reduced from 20 minutes to 10 minutes. This reduction was due exclusively to the fact that the interval between the derepressions of the two enzymes, the structural genes for which are located on either side of the deletion, was almost completely eliminated. The results support the genetic evidence for the physical absence of genetic material situated between these two genes."
