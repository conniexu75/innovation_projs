In practice though, commonly used flat boluses fail to make a perfect contact with the irregular surface of the patient’s skin, resulting in air gaps. Hence, we fabricated a customized bolus using a 3-dimensional (3D) printer and evaluated its feasibility for radiotherapy. Methods We designed two kinds of bolus for production on a 3D printer, one of which was the 3D printed flat bolus for the Blue water phantom and the other was a 3D printed customized bolus for the RANDO phantom. The 3D printed flat bolus was fabricated to verify its physical quality. The resulting 3D printed flat bolus was evaluated by assessing dosimetric parameters such as D1.5 cm, D5 cm, and D10 cm. The 3D printed customized bolus was then fabricated, and its quality and clinical feasibility were evaluated by visual inspection and by assessing dosimetric parameters such as Dmax, Dmin, Dmean, D90%, and V90%. Results The dosimetric parameters of the resulting 3D printed flat bolus showed that it was a useful dose escalating material, equivalent to a commercially available flat bolus. Analysis of the dosimetric parameters of the 3D printed customized bolus demonstrated that it is provided good dose escalation and good contact with the irregular surface of the RANDO phantom. Conclusions A customized bolus produced using a 3D printer could potentially replace commercially available flat boluses."
https://openalex.org/W2017545901,"The human tRNA thiouridine modification protein (TUM1), also designated as 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MPST), has been implicated in a wide range of physiological processes in the cell. The roles range from an involvement in thiolation of cytosolic tRNAs to the generation of H2S as signaling molecule both in mitochondria and the cytosol. TUM1 is a member of the sulfurtransferase family and catalyzes the conversion of 3-mercaptopyruvate to pyruvate and protein-bound persulfide. Here, we purified and characterized two novel TUM1 splice variants, designated as TUM1-Iso1 and TUM1-Iso2. The purified proteins showed similar kinetic behavior and comparable pH and temperature dependence. Cellular localization studies, however, showed a different localization pattern between the isoforms. TUM1-Iso1 is exclusively localized in the cytosol, whereas TUM1-Iso2 showed a dual localization both in the cytosol and mitochondria. Interaction studies were performed with the isoforms both in vitro using the purified proteins and in vivo by fluorescence analysis in human cells, using the split-EGFP system. The studies showed that TUM1 interacts with the l-cysteine desulfurase NFS1 and the rhodanese-like protein MOCS3, suggesting a dual function of TUM1 both in sulfur transfer for the biosynthesis of the molybdenum cofactor, and for the thiolation of tRNA. Our studies point to distinct roles of each TUM1 isoform in the sulfur transfer processes in the cell, with different compartmentalization of the two splice variants of TUM1."
https://openalex.org/W2009528971,"Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) are one of the most common diabetes-related cause of hospitalization and often lead to severe infections and poor healing. It has been recently reported that patients with DFU have lower levels of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) at the lesion area, which contributes with the impairment of wound healing. The aim of this study was to determine whether 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25 (OH)2 D3) and L-isoleucine induced HBD-2 and LL-37 in primary cultures from DFU. We developed primary cell cultures from skin biopsies from 15 patients with DFU and 15 from healthy donors. Cultures were treated with 1,25 (OH)2D3 or L-isoleucine for 18 h. Keratinocytes phenotype was identified by western blot and flow cytometry. Real time qPCR for DEFB4, CAMP and VDR gene expression was performed as well as an ELISA to measure HBD-2 and LL-37 in supernatant. Antimicrobial activity, in vitro, wound healing and proliferation assays were performed with conditioned supernatant. The results show that primary culture from DFU treated with 1,25(OH)2D3, increased DEFB4 and CAMP gene expression and increased the production of HBD-2 and LL-37 in the culture supernatant. These supernatants had antimicrobial activity over E. coli and induced remarkable keratinocyte migration. In conclusion the 1,25(OH)2D3 restored the production of AMPs in primary cell from DFU which were capable to improve the in vitro wound healing assays, suggesting their potential therapeutic use on the treatment of DFU."
https://openalex.org/W2019298345,"Humans are colonized by thousands of bacterial species, but it is difficult to assess the metabolic and pathogenic potential of the majority of these because they have yet to be cultured. Here, we characterize an uncultivated vaginal mycoplasma tightly associated with trichomoniasis that was previously known by its 16S rRNA sequence as “Mnola.” In this study, the mycoplasma was found almost exclusively in women infected with the sexually transmitted pathogen Trichomonas vaginalis, but rarely observed in women with no diagnosed disease. The genomes of four strains of this species were reconstructed using metagenome sequencing and assembly of DNA from four discrete mid-vaginal samples, one of which was obtained from a pregnant woman with trichomoniasis who delivered prematurely. These bacteria harbor several putative virulence factors and display unique metabolic strategies. Genes encoding proteins with high similarity to potential virulence factors include two collagenases, a hemolysin, an O-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase and a feoB-type ferrous iron transport system. We propose the name “Candidatus Mycoplasma girerdii” for this potential new pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W2035103791,"The Wnt signaling pathway plays an important role in developmental processes, including embryonic patterning, cell specification, and cell polarity. Wnt components participate in the development of the central nervous system, and growing evidence indicates that this pathway also regulates the function of the adult nervous system. In this study, we report that Wnt-5a, a noncanonical Wnt ligand, is a potent activator of mitochondrial dynamics and induces acute fission and fusion events in the mitochondria of rat hippocampal neurons. The effect of Wnt-5a was inhibited in the presence of sFRP, a Wnt scavenger. Similarly, the canonical Wnt-3a ligand had no effect on mitochondrial fission-fusion events, suggesting that this effect is specific for Wnt-5a alone. We also show that the Wnt-5a effects on mitochondrial dynamics occur with an increase in both intracellular and mitochondrial calcium (Ca2+), which was correlated with an increased phosphorylation of Drp1(Ser-616) and a decrease of Ser-637 phosphorylation, both indicators of mitochondrial dynamics. Electron microscope analysis of hippocampal tissues in the CA1 region showed an increase in the number of mitochondria present in the postsynaptic region, and this finding correlated with a change in mitochondrial morphology. We conclude that Wnt-5a/Ca2+ signaling regulates the mitochondrial fission-fusion process in hippocampal neurons, a feature that might help to further understand the role of Wnt-related pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, and represents a potentially important link between impaired metabolic function and degenerative disorders.Mitochondrial dynamics play a role in maintaining energy production and metabolism in mammalian cells.ResultsWnt-5a signaling stimulated mitochondrial dynamics in neurons, triggering the fission-fusion process through calcium mobilization.ConclusionWnt-5a signaling controls mitochondrial morphology and dynamics in postsynaptic regions.SignificanceNoncanonical Wnt-5a signaling modulates mitochondrial dynamics in normal neurons, and it is a new therapeutic target for brain disease.

https://openalex.org/W2168130841,"Refractive errors in vision can be caused by aberrant axial length of the eye, irregular corneal shape, or lens abnormalities. Causes of eye length overgrowth include multiple genetic loci, and visual parameters. We evaluate zebrafish as a potential animal model for studies of the genetic, cellular, and signaling basis of emmetropization and myopia. Axial length and other eye dimensions of zebrafish were measured using spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). We used ocular lens and body metrics to normalize and compare eye size and relative refractive error (difference between observed retinal radial length and controls) in wild-type and lrp2 zebrafish. Zebrafish were dark-reared to assess effects of visual deprivation on eye size. Two relative measurements, ocular axial length to body length and axial length to lens diameter, were found to accurately normalize comparisons of eye sizes between different sized fish (R2=0.9548, R2=0.9921). Ray-traced focal lengths of wild-type zebrafish lenses were equal to their retinal radii, while lrp2 eyes had longer retinal radii than focal lengths. Both genetic mutation (lrp2) and environmental manipulation (dark-rearing) caused elongated eye axes. lrp2 mutants had relative refractive errors of -0.327 compared to wild-types, and dark-reared wild-type fish had relative refractive errors of -0.132 compared to light-reared siblings. Therefore, zebrafish eye anatomy (axial length, lens radius, retinal radius) can be rapidly and accurately measured by SD-OCT, facilitating longitudinal studies of regulated eye growth and emmetropization. Specifically, genes homologous to human myopia candidates may be modified, inactivated or overexpressed in zebrafish, and myopia-sensitizing conditions used to probe gene-environment interactions. Our studies provide foundation for such investigations into genetic contributions that control eye size and impact refractive errors."
https://openalex.org/W1970795454,"Focal radiotherapy for cancer patients has detrimental effects on bones within the radiation field and the primary clinical signs of bone damage include the loss of functional osteoblasts. We reported previously that daily injection of parathyroid hormone (PTH, 1–34) alleviates radiation-induced osteopenia in a preclinical radiotherapy model by improving osteoblast survival. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms, we irradiated osteoblastic UMR 106-01 cells and calvarial organ culture and demonstrated an anti-apoptosis effect of PTH1–34 on these cultures. Inhibitor assay indicated that PTH exerts its radioprotective action mainly through protein kinase A/β-catenin pathway. γ-H2AX foci staining and comet assay revealed that PTH efficiently promotes the repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in irradiated osteoblasts via activating the β-catenin pathway. Interestingly, Wnt3a alone also blocked cell death and accelerated DNA repair in primary osteoprogenitors, osteoblastic and osteocytic cells after radiation through the canonical signaling. Further investigations revealed that both Wnt3a and PTH increase the amount of Ku70, a core protein for initiating the assembly of DSB repair machinery, in osteoblasts after radiation. Moreover, down-regulation of Ku70 by siRNA abrogated the prosurvival effect of PTH and Wnt3a on irradiated osteoblasts. In summary, our results identify a novel role of PTH and canonical Wnt signaling in regulating DSB repair machinery and apoptosis in osteoblasts and shed light on using PTH1–34 or Wnt agonist as possible therapy for radiation-induced osteoporosis.PTH1–34 alleviates radiation-induced osteoporosis in a preclinical radiotherapy model.ResultsPTH1–34 attenuates radiation damage on osteoblasts by increasing Ku70 amount, accelerating DNA repair, and suppressing osteoblast apoptosis.

https://openalex.org/W1992550773,"Cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) is a key enzyme in sulfur metabolism, and its inherited deficiency causes homocystinuria. Mammalian CBS is modulated by the binding of S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) to its regulatory domain, which activates its catalytic domain. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we performed x-ray crystallography, mutagenesis, and mass spectrometry (MS) on human CBS. The 1.7 Å structure of a AdoMet-bound CBS regulatory domain shows one AdoMet molecule per monomer, at the interface between two constituent modules (CBS-1, CBS-2). AdoMet binding is accompanied by a reorientation between the two modules, relative to the AdoMet-free basal state, to form interactions with AdoMet via residues verified by mutagenesis to be important for AdoMet binding (Phe(443), Asp(444), Gln(445), and Asp(538)) and for AdoMet-driven inter-domain communication (Phe(443), Asp(538)). The observed structural change is further supported by ion mobility MS, showing that as-purified CBS exists in two conformational populations, which converged to one in the presence of AdoMet. We therefore propose that AdoMet-induced conformational change alters the interface and arrangement between the catalytic and regulatory domains within the CBS oligomer, thereby increasing the accessibility of the enzyme active site for catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1973956721,"Human motor neurons derived from embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells (hESCs and hiPSCs) are a potentially important tool for studying motor neuron survival and pathological cell death. However, their basic survival requirements remain poorly characterized. Here, we sought to optimize a robust survival assay and characterize their response to different neurotrophic factors. First, to increase motor neuron yield, we screened a small-molecule collection and found that the Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y-27632 enhances motor neuron progenitor proliferation up to 4-fold in hESC and hiPSC cultures. Next, we FACS-purified motor neurons expressing the Hb9::GFP reporter from Y-27632-amplified embryoid bodies and cultured them in the presence of mitotic inhibitors to eliminate dividing progenitors. Survival of these purified motor neurons in the absence of any other cell type was strongly dependent on neurotrophic support. GDNF, BDNF and CNTF all showed potent survival effects (EC50 1–2 pM). The number of surviving motor neurons was further enhanced in the presence of forskolin and IBMX, agents that increase endogenous cAMP levels. As a demonstration of the ability of the assay to detect novel neurotrophic agents, Y-27632 itself was found to support human motor neuron survival. Thus, purified human stem cell-derived motor neurons show survival requirements similar to those of primary rodent motor neurons and can be used for rigorous cell-based screening."

We sought to determine whether EAT thickness was associated or not with the presence and extent of angiographic coronary artery disease (CAD).We measured epicardial fat thickness by computed tomography and assessed the presence and extent of CAD by coronary angiography in participants from the prospective EVASCAN study. The association of EAT thickness with cardiovascular risk factors, coronary artery calcification scoring and angiographic CAD was assessed using multivariate regression analysis.Of 970 patients (age 60.9 years, 71% male), 75% (n = 731) had CAD. Patients with angiographic CAD had thicker EAT on the left ventricle lateral wall when compared with patients without CAD (2.74±2.4 mm vs. 2.08±2.1 mm; p = 0.0001). The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for a patient with a LVLW EAT value ≥2.8 mm to have CAD was OR = 1.46 [1.03-2.08], p = 0.0326 after adjusting for risk factors. EAT also correlated with the number of diseased vessels (p = 0.0001 for trend). By receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, an EAT value ≥2.8 mm best predicted the presence of>50% diameter coronary artery stenosis, with a sensitivity and specificity of 46.1% and 66.5% respectively (AUC:0.58). Coronary artery calcium scoring had an AUC of 0.76.Although left ventricle lateral wall EAT thickness correlated with the presence and extent of angiographic CAD, it has a low performance for the diagnosis of CAD."
https://openalex.org/W2115032165,"Recently, it has been suggested that pectinases could be used to hydrolyze pectin in biorefineries based on pectin-rich agro-industrial wastes. However, for this to be viable, the cost of their production would need to be lowered significantly. In fact, over the last few decades, there have been many attempts to improve pectinase production by existing strains or to screen for new strains from environmental isolates. In these studies, it is necessary to measure pectinase activities. Many researchers use single-time-point assays that involve incubation of pectinolytic extracts with pectic substrates for a fixed time, followed by determination of the liberated reducing sugars. However, different researchers use quite different conditions for this assay. Furthermore, no attention has been given to the reaction profile during the assay. In the current work, we show, for the first time, that a significant deceleration of the rate of liberation of reducing sugars occurs over the first ten minutes of the reaction. As a consequence, the incubation time used in a single-time-point assay has a large effect on the value obtained for the activity. In fact, we demonstrate that, depending on the particular combination of incubation time, pectin concentration and reaction temperature, the same extract could be reported to have activities that differ by an order of magnitude. In addition, we show that the relative activities obtained with polygalacturonic acid do not correlate with those obtained with pectin. We conclude that it is currently impossible to make meaningful comparisons between pectinase activities reported in the literature by workers who have used different assay conditions. Therefore there is an urgent need for the development of a standardized assay for evaluating the saccharification potential of pectinase complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2092614674,"Fabry disease (FD) is one of the X-linked lysosomal storage disorders caused by deficient functioning of the alpha-galactosidase A (α-GalA) enzyme. The α-GalA deficiency leads to multi-systemic clinical manifestations caused by the preferential accumulation of globotriaosylceramide in the endothelium and vascular smooth muscles. A hallmark symptom of FD patients is peripheral pain that appears in the early stage of the disease. Pain in FD patients is a peripheral small-fiber idiopathic neuropathy, with intra-epidermal fiber density and integrity being used for diagnosing FD in humans. However, the molecular correlates underlying pain sensation in FD remain elusive. Here, we have employed the α-GalA gene KO mouse as a model of FD in rodents to investigate molecular changes in their peripheral nervous system that may account for their algesic symptoms. The α-GalA null mice display neuropathic pain as evidenced by thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia, with histological analyses showing alterations in cutaneous innervation. Additionally, KO mice showed a decreased and scattered pattern of neuronal terminations consistent with the reduction in neuronal terminations in skin biopsies of patients with small fiber neuropathies. At the molecular level KO animals showed an increase in the expression of TRPV1 and Nav1.8, and a decrease in the expression of TRPM8. Notably, these alterations are observed in young animals. Taken together, our findings imply that the α-GalA KO mouse is a good model in which to study the peripheral small fiber neuropathy exhibited by FD patients, and provides molecular evidence for a hyperexcitability of small nociceptors in FD."

Although this moth has a wide distribution and is a pest of many crop plants including sugarcane, corn, sorghum and rice, it is considered one species. The objective was to investigate whether more than one introduction of D. saccharalis had occurred in the southern United States and whether any cryptic species were present. We field collected D. saccharalis in Texas, Louisiana and Florida in the southern United States. Two molecular markers, AFLPs and mitochondrial COI, were used to examine genetic variation among these regional populations and to compare the sequences with those available in GenBank and BOLD. We found geographic population structure in the southern United States which suggests two introductions and the presence of a previously unknown cryptic species. Management of D. saccharalis would likely benefit from further investigation of population genetics throughout the range of this species."

Selenoprotein H (SelH), a nuclear selenoprotein, is proposed to carry redox and transactivation domains. To determine the role of SelH in genome maintenance, shRNA knockdown was employed in human normal and immortalized cell lines. SelH shRNA MRC-5 diploid fibroblasts under ambient O2 displayed a distinct profile of senescence including β-galactosidase expression, autofluorescence, growth inhibition, and ATM pathway activation. Such senescence phenotypes were alleviated in the presence of ATM kinase inhibitors, by p53 shRNA knockdown, or by maintaining the cells under 3% O2. During the course of 5-day recovery, the induction of phospho-ATM on Ser-1981 and γH2AX by H2O2 treatment (20 μm) subsided in scrambled shRNA but exacerbated in SelH shRNA MRC-5 cells. Results from clonogenic assays demonstrated hypersensitivity of SelH shRNA HeLa cells to paraquat and H2O2, but not to hydroxyurea, neocarzinostatin, or camptothecin. While SelH mRNA expression was induced by H2O2 treatment, SelH-GFP did not mobilize to sites of oxidative DNA damage. The glutathione level was lower in SelH shRNA than scrambled shRNA HeLa cells, and the H2O2-induced cell death was rescued in the presence of N-acetylcysteine, a glutathione precursor.

Because SelH expression is enriched in nucleoli, and this organelle has been proposed as a stress-sensing center in the nucleus (24Novoselov S.V. Kryukov G.V. Xu X.M. Carlson B.A. Hatfield D.L.

Thus, we stably knocked down SelH expression in human normal diploid fibroblasts and cancerous cells to evaluate their cellular and biochemical responses to various DNA-damaging agents. Our results suggested a new role of SelH specifically in the cellular response to oxidative stress that suppresses senescence and gatekeeps genomic integrity in a manner depending on ATM and p53.

Because selenium inevitably appears in FBS, a typical cell culture medium containing 10–15% FBS can support selenoprotein expression at nutritional level. By analysis, the batch of FBS used in this study contains selenium at 355 nm. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC), a GSH precursor, was dissolved in water. KU 60019 and KU 55933 (Tocris, Ellisville, MO) were dissolved in DMSO. All chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise indicated. SelH and SelH2 shRNA sequences targeting the 3′ SelH mRNA at nucleotides 333–353 and 503–523 were designed based on Invitrogen Block-itTM RNAi designer, and the human non-target scrambled sequence (5′-CCTAAGGTTAAGTCGCCCTCGC-3′) was adapted from Addgene Organization. The lentiviral particles containing shRNA cassette were produced by BLOCK-iT™ Lentiviral RNAi Expression System (Life Technologies) and used to infect cells in culture. After viral infection (1 day), recovery (1 day), and blasticidin selection (14 days), 12 viable clones were picked from each viral infection and sub-cultured to confirm the knockdown efficiency by using quantitative RT-PCR. Human TaqMan probes (FAM-tagged) and primers were purchased from Applied Biosystems using inventoried TaqMan gene expression assays: SelH (Hs00415057_m1) and GAPDH (Hs99999905_m1). Cells containing SelH or SelH2 shRNA sequences expressed ∼80% less SelH mRNA as compared with scrambled shRNA cells. A viable colony is defined as one containing more than 50 cells. Passage 2 SelH shRNA MRC-5 cells were employed for experiments unless otherwise indicated. p53 shRNA knockdown was performed as described previously (36Wu M. Wu R.T. Wang T.T. Cheng W.H.

Levels of intracellular ROS were assessed by using 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (CM-H2DCFDA, Invitrogen). CM-H2DCFDA stock (1 m) was prepared in DMSO. MRC-5 cells on coverslips were washed twice with PBS, incubated in phenol red-free RPMI medium containing 5 μm CM-H2DCFDA for 15 min, washed twice with PBS, and then incubated in phenol red-free RPMI medium for an additional 15 min in an incubator. Cells were then imaged under a Zeiss AxioObserver 100 fluorescence microscope for image acquisition using the FITC 488-nm excitation spectra setting. Immunofluorescence and immunoblotting analyses were performed as described previously (34Wu M. Kang M.M. Schoene N.W. Cheng W.H. Selenium compounds activate early barriers of tumorigenesis.J. Biol.

Briefly, permeabilized cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibodies against phospho-H2AX on Ser-139 (γH2AX, 1:200; Abcam, Cambridge, MA), phospho-ATM on Ser-1981 (pATM Ser-1981, 1:500; Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA), H2AX (1:500; Abcam), and ATM (1:500; Epitomics, Burlingame, CA). γH2AX and pATM Ser-1981 are well-defined markers for DNA breaks and ATM pathway activation, respectively (38Löbrich M.

Six pictures were randomly taken from each slide. Nuclear fraction was prepared by using a Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Kit (G-Bioscience, MO), separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto PVDF membranes. Blots were incubated with antibodies against phospho-Nrf2 on Ser-40 (pNrf2, 1:1000; Epitomics), Nrf2 (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and lamin B (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and chemiluminescent reagents (Super Signal, Pierce) for signal acquisition. All experiments were performed in duplicate and a minimum of three times. The activity of senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal), a senescence marker undetectable in actively proliferating cells (10Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C.

U.S.A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5707) Google Scholar), was determined using a Senescence Detection Kit (BioVision, San Francisco, CA) according to manufacturer's instruction. MRC-5 cells were seeded onto 12-well plates (104 cells/well) in the presence or absence of H2O2 (20 μm) in a 3% or a 20% O2 incubator. Images were captured under a light microscope for quantification. Autofluorescence is another index of aging in cultured human diploid fibroblasts (40Wilhelm J. Vytásek R. Ostádalová I. Vajner L. Evaluation of different methods detecting intracellular generation of free radicals.Mol. Cell Biochem. 2009; 328: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Passage 4 SelH and scrambled shRNA MRC-5 cells were subjected to Zeiss AxioObserver 100 fluorescence microscope at 200× magnification. The fluorescence signal was acquired by using filter cube set 49 (excitation, 365 nm; filter, 395 nm; emission, 445 nm), and the intensity of autofluorescence was analyzed by Axiovision software. After being seeded (750 cells/6-cm dish) for 24 h, SelH and scrambled shRNA HeLa and HCT116+hMLH1 cells were incubated with a gradient concentration of DNA-damaging agents, including hydroxyurea, neocarzinostatin, camptothecin, paraquat, and H2O2 (Fisher Scientific) for 24 h. Then, the drug-containing medium was replaced by a complete medium and cultured for additional 7 days. Cells were washed with 1× PBS, fixed in 90% methanol, and stained by 0.5% crystal violet (Alfa Aesar, MA) in 25% methanol. A viable colony is defined as one composing of more than 50 cells. A mixture of oxidative and broken DNA damage was generated in live cell nuclei by laser-induced microirradiation using a pulsed nitrogen laser as previously described (41Uematsu N. Weterings E.

The laser system was coupled to a Zeiss Axiovert microscope for live cell, time lapse image capture. Total intracellular GSH was estimated using monochlorobimane (mBCL), which formed fluorescent adducts with GSH (42Sebastià J. Cristòfol R. Martín M. Rodríguez-Farré E. Sanfeliu C.

Adherent cells were collected and preloaded with mBCl (40 μm) in PBS for 10 min, followed by incubation with propyl iodide permeable only to dead cells. The stained cells were applied to FACSCanto II flow cytometer (BD Bioscience, CA) immediately to determine the content of GSH per 10,000 live cells. Apoptotic cells were determined by a Mitocapture kit (Biovision) on the basis of the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential. The Mitocapture reagent accumulated in the mitochondria and showed red fluorescence only in live cells, but could not aggregate and showed green fluorescence in apoptotic cells. Cells on coverslips were incubated with 1:1000 Mitocapture reagent (diluted in pre-warmed incubation buffer) in an incubator for 15 min, and washed three times with incubation buffer. The stained cells were subjected to fluorescent microscopic analyses of GFP and DsRed signals. Eight pictures were randomly taken from each slide. Strikingly, SelH shRNA MRC-5 cells barely proliferated, accumulated non-dividing large and flat cells, and showed completely stalled growth by passage 4 or 36 days after clonal selection, whereas scrambled shRNA MRC-5 cells proliferated exponentially (Fig. 1, A and B). These results indicate that SelH deficiency restricts replicative lifespan in human diploid fibroblasts. Old or senescent cells in culture have previously been shown to exhibit elevated autofluorescence (40Wilhelm J. Vytásek R. Ostádalová I. Vajner L. Evaluation of different methods detecting intracellular generation of free radicals.Mol. Cell Biochem. 2009; 328: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 44Kuilman T. Michaloglou C. Mooi W.J. Peeper D.S. The essence of senescence.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 2463-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, microscopic analyses of passage 4, non-proliferating SelH shRNA MRC-5 cells showed 7-fold greater autofluorescence signal as compared with scrambled shRNA cells (Fig. 1B). Further microscopic analyses of CM-H2DCFDA fluorescence demonstrated that level of intracellular ROS was 2-fold greater in SelH than in scrambled shRNA MRC-5 cells at passage 4 when cultured under 20% O2 (Fig. 1C). Overall, these results implicate ROS in the slow proliferation and the formation of senescence-like phenotypes in SelH shRNA MRC-5 cells. Because fibroblasts cultured in a typical 20% O2 incubator is believed to be under chronic oxygen tension and can accelerate replicative senescence (45Parrinello S. Samper E. Krtolica A. Goldstein J. Melov S. Campisi J. Oxygen sensitivity severely limits the replicative lifespan of murine fibroblasts.Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar, 46Poulios E.

Sci. 2007; 1119: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), features of senescence in MRC-5 cells were also assessed under a 3% O2 (physiological level) culture condition. While SA-β-gal expression was significantly greater (p < 0.05) in SelH than in scrambled shRNA MRC-5 cells being cultured either in a 3% or a 20% O2 incubator for 7 days (Fig. 1D), the extent of which was significantly reduced when cultured under 3% O2 in both SelH and scrambled shRNA MRC-5 cells. Moreover, the complete growth inhibition of SelH shRNA MRC-5 cells maintained under 20% O2 for 5 weeks could be partially rescued when grown in a 3% O2 incubator, although SelH shRNA MRC-5 cells remained to proliferate poorly (∼300-fold slower) as compared with scrambled shRNA MRC-5 cells (Fig. 1, A and E). Similarly, scrambled shRNA MRC-5 cells proliferated 55-fold faster in a 3% than in a 20% O2 incubator. Altogether, these results suggest that SelH is required for cellular proliferation and the suppression of replicative senescence in a manner depending on ROS in human diploid fibroblasts. Senescence in human diploid fibroblasts is associated with persistent broken and oxidative DNA damage (47Campisi J. d'Adda di Fagagna F. Cellular senescence: when bad things happen to good cells.Nat.

Thus, SelH and scrambled shRNA MRC-5 cells were treated with H2O2 (20 μm) for 1 day, followed by 0–5 days recovery.

Since EMT-induced motility and invasion play a critical role in cancer metastasis, EMT-related molecules are emerging as novel targets of anti-cancer therapies. Traf2- and Nck-interacting kinase (TNIK) has recently been considered as a first-in-class anti-cancer target molecule to regulate Wnt signaling pathway, but pharmacologic inhibition of its EMT activity has not yet been studied. Here, using 5-(4-methylbenzamido)-2-(phenylamino)thiazole-4-carboxamide (KY-05009) with TNIK-inhibitory activity, its efficacy to inhibit EMT in cancer cells was validated. The molecular docking/binding study revealed the binding of KY-05009 in the hinge region of TNIK, and the inhibitory activity of KY-05009 against TNIK was confirmed by an ATP competition assay (Ki, 100 nM). In A549 cells, KY-05009 significantly and strongly inhibited the TGF-β-activated EMT through the attenuation of Smad and non-Smad signaling pathways, including the Wnt, NF-κB, FAK-Src-paxillin-related focal adhesion, and MAP kinases (ERK and JNK) signaling pathways.

In order to identify useful biomarkers for accurately classifying prognostic risks for ESCC patients, we examined the expression of six proteins by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 590 paraffin-embedded ESCC samples. The candidate proteins include p53, EGFR, c-KIT, TIMP1 and PI3K-p110α reported to be altered in ESCC tissues as well as another important component of PI3K, PI3K-p85α. Of the six proteins tested, p53, EGFR, c-KIT, TIMP1 and PI3K-p85α were detected with high expression in 43.0%, 36.6%, 55.9%, 70.7% and 57.1% of tumors, respectively. Significant associations were found between high expression of PI3K-p85α, EGFR and p53 and poor prognosis (P = 0.00111; 0.00001; 0.00426). Applying these three proteins as an IHC panel could divide patients into different subgroups (P<0.000001). Multivariate cox regression analysis indicated that the three-protein panel was an independent prognostic factor with very high statistical significance (HR = 2.090, 95% CI: 1.621-2.696, P = 0.00000001).

We previously identified a four-residue segment (residues 212–215) of the dopamine D2 receptor that is necessary for arrestin binding in an in vitro heterologous expression system but that also impairs receptor expression. We now describe the characterization of additional mutations at that arrestin binding site in the third intracellular loop. Mutating two (residues 214 and 215) or three (residues 213–215) of the four residues to alanine partially decreased agonist-induced recruitment of arrestin3 without altering activation of a G protein. Arrestin-dependent receptor internalization, which requires arrestin binding to β2-adaptin (the β2 subunit of the clathrin-associated adaptor protein AP2) and clathrin, was disproportionately affected by the three-residue mutation, with no agonist-induced internalization observed even in the presence of overexpressed arrestin or G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2. The disjunction between arrestin recruitment and internalization could not be explained by alterations in the time course of the receptor-arrestin interaction, the recruitment of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2, or the receptor-induced interaction between arrestin and β2-adaptin, suggesting that the mutation impairs a property of the internalization complex that has not yet been identified.

Dopaminergic neurotransmission via the D2 receptor contributes to the rewarding properties of drugs of abuse (1Baik J.H. Dopamine signaling in reward-related behaviors.Front.

As well as being crucial for termination of G protein-dependent signaling and receptor internalization, arrestins act as scaffolds for signaling proteins (12Rajagopal S. Rajagopal K. Lefkowitz R.J. Teaching old receptors new tricks: biasing seven-transmembrane receptors.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2010; 9: 373-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Agonist-induced recruitment of arrestin by a GPCR may activate a unique set of signaling pathways that have distinctive behavioral consequences. For example, the D2 receptor mediates arrestin-dependent dephosphorylation of the protein kinase Akt by protein phosphatase 2A and a net increase in glycogen synthase kinase 3β activity, which contributes to amphetamine-induced locomotor activation (13Beaulieu J.M. Sotnikova T.D. Yao W.-D. Kockeritz L. Woodgett J.R. Gainetdinov R.R. Caron M.G. Lithium antagonizes dopamine-dependent behaviors mediated by an AKT/glycogen synthase kinase 3 signaling cascade.Proc.

In the standard model of arrestin-mediated desensitization, GPCR phosphorylation by GRK increases the affinity of arrestin for the receptor, leading to subsequent receptor desensitization and internalization (18Gurevich V.V. Gurevich E.V. The molecular acrobatics of arrestin activation.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 25: 105-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 19Violin J.D. Ren X.R.

However, although IL3 of the D2 receptor is the site of GRK2 phosphorylation and directly interacts with arrestin3, receptor phosphorylation by GRK2 may not be required for either arrestin3 recruitment or receptor internalization (20Namkung Y. Dipace C. Javitch J.A. Sibley D.R. G protein-coupled receptor kinase-mediated phosphorylation regulates post-endocytic trafficking of the D2 dopamine receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 15038-15051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that arrestin3 binding to the D2 receptor is greatly reduced when amino acids 212–215 (IYIV), located within IL3 of the D2 receptor, were mutated to alanine residues. This mutation abolishes agonist-induced receptor internalization, with less effect on G protein-mediated signaling (9Lan H. Liu Y. Bell M.I. Gurevich V.V. Neve K.A. A dopamine D2 receptor mutant capable of G protein-mediated signaling but deficient in arrestin binding.Mol. Pharmacol. 2009; 75: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This mutation also greatly impairs trafficking of the receptor to the cell membrane, thereby reducing its value as a tool to study the relationships between specific signaling pathways and dopamine-dependent behaviors. The purpose of this study was to develop a D2 receptor mutant that is significantly impaired in arrestin3 recruitment yet maintains G protein signaling and receptor expression. Herein we describe the creation and characterization of a mutant D2 dopamine receptor that has modestly diminished agonist-induced recruitment of GRK2 and arrestin3 yet maintains G protein-dependent signaling and normal expression. Surprisingly, despite retaining substantial ability to recruit arrestin3 and to promote arrestin3-dependent interaction with β2-adaptin (the β2 subunit of the clathrin-associated adaptor protein AP2), this mutant D2 receptor failed to undergo agonist-induced receptor internalization. Quinpirole, dopamine hydrochloride, (+)-butaclamol, haloperidol, (S)-(−)-sulpiride, and G418 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Phosphatase inhibitor mixture set II and protease inhibitor mixture set III were purchased from Calbiochem, and coelenterazine h was from Dalton Chemical Laboratories (Toronto, Canada).

Chem. 2007; 282: 29089-29100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and pcDNA3.1 plasmids were used. Human arrestin3 fused to Rluc8 at its C terminus with a SRPPVAT amino acid linker (Arr3-Rluc8) was created in pcDNA3.1. The arrestin translocation assay used Rluc8-arrestin3 with an SH3-binding peptide (Sp1) at its C terminus (Rluc8-arrestin3-Sp1) and a doubly palmitoylated fragment of GAP43 linked to citrine and an SH3 domain through a serine- and glycine-rich linker (mem-linker-citrine-SH3). For internalization and immunoblotting assays, plasmids carrying rat D2L receptor, wild type and mutants of arrestin3, and GRK2 were used. Multiple point mutations of both the D2L receptor, D2-Rluc8, and arrestin were constructed using the QuikChange® Lightning site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) per the manufacturer's instructions to introduce alanine substitution of residues 214 and 215 (A2), 213–215 (A3), or 212–215 (A4) within IL3. Residues of arrestin3 were deleted (373LIEFD377) or mutated (R395E) alone or in combination using this method. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% bovine calf serum (Thermo Scientific, Logan, UT), 5% fetal clone serum (Thermo Scientific), and 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (Thermo Scientific) at 37 °C with 10% CO2. HEK293T cells were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Corning Inc.) at 37 °C with 10% CO2. For the internalization and Western blot studies, stable expression of either wild type or mutant D2L receptors in HEK293 cells was obtained by transfecting 6 μg of D2 receptor cDNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Pools of stably transfected cells were then maintained under selective pressure using 600 μg/ml G418 for 3 weeks, after which the amount of G418 in the growth medium was decreased to 300 μg/ml. Transient expression of arrestin3, GRK2, and/or pcDNA3.1 into HEK293 cells stably expressing wild type or mutant D2L receptors was obtained by transfecting 3 μg of cDNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After overnight incubation at 37 °C, transfection complexes were rinsed off, and the cells were split into new plates and incubated for an additional 48 h before conducting experiments. Protein expression was confirmed by immunoblotting. For all BRET studies, constructs were transiently transfected into either HEK293 or HEK293T cells using polyethyleneimine (PEI; Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA), as described previously (22Newman A.H. Beuming T. Banala A.K. Donthamsetti P. Pongetti K. LaBounty A. Levy B. Cao J. Michino M. Luedtke R.R. Javitch J.A. Shi L. Molecular determinants of selectivity and efficacy at the dopamine D3 receptor.J. Med. Chem. 2012; 55: 6689-6699Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The quantity of transfected DNA was adjusted so that the levels of membrane expression of wild type and mutant D2 receptors were similar as determined by radioligand binding assay or FACS, as described below. For the arrestin3 mutant internalization studies, 2 μg of GRK2 were contransfected with 2 μg of pcDNA3.1, Arr3-WT, Arr3-ΔLIEFD, Arr3-R395E, or Arr3-ΔLIEFD/R395E into HEK293 cells stably expressing wild-type D2L receptors using PEI at a ratio of 2 μl of PEI (1 μg/μl) per 1 μg of cDNA. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, cells were washed with PBS, split into new plates, and incubated for an additional 48 h before conducting experiments. HEK293 or HEK293T cells were transiently co-transfected with plasmids as described above. For mVenus-Arr3 and β2-AP-EYFP recruitment to the receptor, cells were harvested and split into two plates, one for radioligand binding assays and one for BRET assays. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested, resuspended in assay buffer (PBS with Ca2+, MgCl2, and 0.2 μm ascorbic acid), and plated at ∼150,000 cells/well in 96-well OptiPlates (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Vehicle or quinpirole was added with 2 μm coelenterazine h and incubated at 25 °C. Emission of the donor (460 nm) and the acceptor (535 nm) was then measured once at 10 min or every 5 min for 30 min using a VictorTM X Light luminescence reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and the BRET ratio was calculated as described previously (26Pfleger K.D. Seeber R.M. Eidne K.A. Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) for the real-time detection of protein-protein interactions.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Cells used in the G protein activation, GRK2 recruitment to receptor, and arrestin3 recruitment to β2-AP-EYFP BRET assays were prepared and assayed as described previously (22Newman A.H. Beuming T. Banala A.K. Donthamsetti P. Pongetti K. LaBounty A. Levy B. Cao J. Michino M. Luedtke R.R. Javitch J.A. Shi L. Molecular determinants of selectivity and efficacy at the dopamine D3 receptor.J. Med. Chem. 2012; 55: 6689-6699Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and were measured 2, 2, and 20 min, respectively, after the addition of quinpirole. For the arrestin translocation assay, pcDNA3.1 encoding wild type or mutant D2 receptors was cotransfected with plasmids containing GRK2, Rluc8-arrestin3-Sp1, and a membrane marker mem-linker-citrine-SH3. The Sp1 and SH3 helper peptides, adapted from the helper interaction FRET system (27Grünberg R. Burnier J.V. Ferrar T. Beltran-Sastre V. Stricher F. van der Sloot A.M. Garcia-Olivas R. Mallabiabarrena A. Sanjuan X. Zimmermann T. Serrano L. Engineering of weak helper interactions for high-efficiency FRET probes.Nat. Methods. 2013; 10: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), were used to enhance the interaction between arrestin recruited to the plasma membrane by receptor and the membrane marker, thus increasing the dynamic range of the assay. Dopamine- and quinpirole-induced arrestin recruitment to the membrane was measured after 10 min of stimulation. D2-mediated inhibition of cAMP was measured using a BRET-based cAMP sensor, CAMYEL. Cells transiently transfected with D2-WT or A4 receptor and CAMYEL were preincubated for 10 min with 10 μm forskolin (Sigma) to stimulate cAMP production, followed by the addition of quinpirole. Quinpirole-mediated inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP was measured after 10 min. For all BRET studies, the vehicle BRET ratio was subtracted from the quinpirole BRET ratio and presented as a percentage of the Emax fit of quinpirole at the wild type receptor. Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using Prism (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). To depict the variability in the activity of D2-WT and mutant receptors across replicate experiments, we calculated the mean of the Emax values for D2-WT, converted the Emax value for each replicate to a percentage of that value, and then determined the mean ± S.E. for all replicates. To compare membrane expression of D2 receptors, cells were lysed in ice-cold hypotonic buffer (1 mm HEPES, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) for 20 min at 4 °C, scraped from the plate, and centrifuged at 17,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in TBS (50 mm Tris, 120 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) and homogenized for 10 s using a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkmann Instruments, Westbury, NY). Protein concentration of the membranes was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific) and 5 μg of protein was incubated in TBS containing 0.02% BSA (Fisher) at a volume of 1 ml with [3H]YM-09151-2 for 1 h at 25 °C. Nonspecific binding was assessed using (+)-butaclamol (2 μm). Membranes were then harvested, and radioactivity was measured as described previously (9Lan H. Liu Y. Bell M.I. Gurevich V.V. Neve K.A. A dopamine D2 receptor mutant capable of G protein-mediated signaling but deficient in arrestin binding.Mol. Pharmacol. 2009; 75: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using GraphPad Prism to determine Kd and Bmax values. Transfected cells expressing N-terminal FLAG- or c-Myc-tagged D2 receptor were dissociated, and surface receptors were labeled using mouse anti-FLAG or anti-c-Myc antibodies and goat anti-mouse-Alexa647 antibodies diluted 1:400 in PBS (with 0.1% BSA and 0.1% NaN3) and quantitated using a C6 Flow Cytometer (Accuri). This FACS assay was used to equalize receptor expression in the assays for G protein activation (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 3, A and B), inhibition of cAMP (Fig. 1D), GRK2-Venus recruitment (Fig. 6), and the interaction between arrestin and β2-adaptin (Fig. 9).FIGURE 1D2-A4-mediated inhibition of cyclic AMP accumulation and G protein activation.

https://openalex.org/W2073656830,"Background Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) is an emerging multidrug-resistant nosocomial pathogen, spreading to hospitalized elderly patients. Risk factors in this setting are unclear. Our aims were to explore the contribution of multi-morbidity and disease severity in the onset of CRKP colonization/infection, and to describe changes in epidemiology after the institution of quarantine-ward managed by staff-cohorting. Methods and Findings With a case-control design, we evaluated 133 CRKP-positive patients (75 M, 58 F; mean age 79±10 years) and a control group of 400 CRKP-negative subjects (179 M, 221 F; mean age 79±12 years) admitted to Internal Medicine and Critical Subacute Care Unit of Parma University Hospital, Italy, during a 10-month period. Information about comorbidity type and severity, expressed through Cumulative Illness Rating Scale-CIRS, was collected in each patient. During an overall 5-month period, CRKP-positive patients were managed in an isolation ward with staff cohorting. A contact-bed isolation approach was established in the other 5 months. The effects of these strategies were evaluated with a cross-sectional study design. CRKP-positive subjects had higher CIRS comorbidity index (12.0±3.6 vs 9.1±3.5, p<0.0001) and CIRS severity index (3.2±0.4 vs 2.9±0.5, p<0.0001), along with higher cardiovascular, respiratory, renal and neurological disease burden than control group. CIRS severity index was associated with a higher risk for CRKP-colonization (OR 13.3, 95%CI6.88–25.93), independent of comorbidities. Isolation ward activation was associated with decreased monthly incidence of CRKP-positivity (from 16.9% to 1.2% of all admissions) and infection (from 36.6% to 22.5% of all positive cases; p = 0.04 derived by Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Mortality rate did not differ between cases and controls (21.8% vs 15.2%, p = 0.08). The main limitations of this study are observational design and lack of data about prior antibiotic exposure. Conclusions Comorbidities and disease severity are relevant risk factors for CRKP-colonization/infection in elderly frail patients. Sanitary measures may have contributed to limit epidemic spread and rate of infection also in internal medicine setting."
https://openalex.org/W2014245961,"Extracellular heparanase activity releases growth factors and angiogenic factors from heparan sulfate (HS) storage sites and alters the integrity of the extracellular matrix. These activities lead to a loss of normal cell matrix adherent junctions and correlate with invasive cellular phenotypes. Elevated expression of heparanase is associated with several human cancers and with vascular remodeling. Heparanase cleaves only a limited fraction of glucuronidic linkages in HS. There have been few investigations of the functional consequences of heparanase activity, largely due to the heterogeneity and complexity of HS. Here, we report a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based approach to profile the terminal structures created by heparanase digestion and reconstruct the heparanase cleavage sites from the products. Using this method, we demonstrate that heparanase cleaves at the non-reducing side of highly sulfated HS domains, exposing cryptic growth factor binding sites. This cleavage pattern is observed in HS from several tissue sources, regardless of overall sulfation degree, indicating a common recognition pattern. We further demonstrate that heparanase cleavage of HS chains leads to increased ability to support FGF2-dependent cell proliferation. These results suggest a new mechanism to explain how heparanase might potentiate the uncontrolled cell proliferation associated with cancer through its ability to activate nascent growth factor-promoting domains within HS."
https://openalex.org/W1965330957,"P311, a conserved 8-kDa intracellular protein expressed in brain, smooth muscle, regenerating tissues, and malignant glioblastomas, represents the first documented stimulator of TGF-β1-3 translation in vitro and in vivo. Here we initiated efforts to define the mechanism underlying P311 function. PONDR® (Predictor Of Naturally Disordered Regions) analysis suggested and CD confirmed that P311 is an intrinsically disordered protein, therefore requiring an interacting partner to acquire tertiary structure and function. Immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectroscopy identified eIF3 subunit b (eIF3b) as a novel P311 binding partner. Immunohistochemical colocalization, GST pulldown, and surface plasmon resonance studies revealed that P311-eIF3b interaction is direct and has a Kd of 1.26 μm. Binding sites were mapped to the non-canonical RNA recognition motif of eIF3b and a central 11-amino acid-long region of P311, here referred to as eIF3b binding motif. Disruption of P311-eIF3b binding inhibited translation of TGF-β1, 2, and 3, as indicated by luciferase reporter assays, polysome fractionation studies, and Western blot analysis. RNA precipitation assays after UV cross-linking and RNA-protein EMSA demonstrated that P311 binds directly to TGF-β 5'UTRs mRNAs through a previously unidentified RNA recognition motif-like motif. Our results demonstrate that P311 is a novel RNA-binding protein that, by interacting with TGF-βs 5'UTRs and eIF3b, stimulates the translation of TGF-β1, 2, and 3."

Studies indicate that the Ca2+-activated protease calpain cleaves NCX1. We hypothesized that calpain is an important regulator of NCX1 in response to pressure overload and aimed to identify molecular mechanisms and functional consequences of calpain binding and cleavage of NCX1 in the heart. NCX1 full-length protein and a 75-kDa NCX1 fragment along with calpain were up-regulated in aortic stenosis patients and rats with heart failure. Patients with coronary artery disease and sham-operated rats were used as controls. Calpain co-localized, co-fractionated, and co-immunoprecipitated with NCX1 in rat cardiomyocytes and left ventricle lysate. Immunoprecipitations, pull-down experiments, and extensive use of peptide arrays indicated that calpain domain III anchored to the first Ca2+ binding domain in NCX1, whereas the calpain catalytic region bound to the catenin-like domain in NCX1. The use of bioinformatics, mutational analyses, a substrate competitor peptide, and a specific NCX1-Met369 antibody identified a novel calpain cleavage site at Met369.

NCX1 is a bidirectional transporter that mediates the exchange of three Na+ for one Ca2+ across the plasma membrane in either forward mode (Ca2+ efflux) or reverse mode (Ca2+ influx) (1Blaustein M.P. Lederer W.J. Sodium/calcium exchange: its physiological implications.Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 763-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar, 2Kang T.M. Hilgemann D.W. Multiple transport modes of the cardiac Na+/Ca2+ exchanger.Nature. 2004; 427: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The direction of ion transport depends on the membrane potential and the intracellular and extracellular concentrations of Ca2+ and Na+. Under physiological conditions, NCX1 functions predominantly as a Ca2+ extrusion mechanism, and the contribution to decline of the Ca2+ transient varies from 9 to 30%, dependent on species (3Bers D.M. Excitation-Contraction Coupling and Cardiac Contractile Force. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic, Dordrecht, Netherlands2001: 147-253Google Scholar). In pathological settings, the reverse mode of NCX1 function is often augmented (4Khananshvili D.

Interestingly, in animal models of myocardial infarction, increased NCX1 activity was accompanied by only a modest increase in the NCX1 protein level, indicating that other regulators of the exchanger are also involved (6Wasserstrom J.A.

The large intracellular loop between TM5 and TM6 consists of ∼500 amino acids, containing two Ca2+ binding regulatory domains, CBD1 and CBD2 (7Hilge M. Aelen J. Vuister G.W. Ca2+ regulation in the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger involves two markedly different Ca2+ sensors.Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Ca2+ also activates a variety of Ca2+-dependent signaling molecules, including the ubiquitously expressed, non-lysosomal cysteine protease calpain (8Campbell R.L. Davies P.L. Structure-function relationships in calpains.Biochem. J. 2012; 447: 335-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Calpain is a cytoplasmic heterodimer composed of a catalytic subunit (80 kDa) and a regulatory subunit (30 kDa). There are two major catalytic isoforms, calpain-1 and calpain-2, which are activated by micromolar and nearly millimolar Ca2+ concentrations, respectively. Active calpain cleaves its substrate with a limited specific proteolysis, suggesting that it is a regulatory protease. Calpain is implicated in various pathological conditions associated with Ca2+ overload (9Bano D. Young K.W. Guerin C.J. Lefeuvre R. Rothwell N.J. Naldini L. Rizzuto R. Carafoli E. Nicotera P.

The human myocardial biopsy protocol conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Regional Committee for Research Ethics in Eastern Norway (Project 2010/2226). Informed written consent was obtained from all patients. LV apical myocardial biopsies (5–10 mg) were obtained immediately before cross-clamping the aorta in eight patients undergoing elective aortic valve replacement for severe aortic stenosis (AS). All patients exhibited preserved ejection fraction (>50%) and no significant coronary artery stenosis. Myocardial biopsies were also obtained from eight patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, which served as controls. This patient group exhibited ejection fraction >50%, stable angina pectoris, and no evidence of peri-operative ischemia, previous myocardial infarction, or significant valvular disease. If left ventriculography was normal, echocardiography was not performed in control patients, in accordance with hospital guidelines. The included patients were receiving the following cardiovascular medications (aortic valve replacement/control): salicylates (2/7), warfarin (2/1), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (4/3), Ca2+ antagonists (2/1), cholesterol-lowering medication (3/8), diuretics (2/0), and β-blockers (2/3). Biopsies were taken from normal appearing and contracting regions of the myocardium using a 16G MaxCore disposable biopsy instrument (Bard, Tempe, AZ), snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C. Animal handling and experiments were approved by the Norwegian Animal Research Committee (FOTS ID 3820) and conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication 85-23, revised 1996). Male Wistar rats (Møllergaard Breeding and Research Center, Skensved, Denmark) weighing ∼170 g were subjected to aortic banding as described previously (15Brattelid T. Qvigstad E. Birkeland J.A.

In short, anesthesia was induced in an anesthesia chamber containing a mixture of 67% N2O, 28% O2, and 4% isoflurane. Ventilation was performed by subsequent endotracheal intubation with a respirator (Zoovent, Triumph Technical Services, Milton Keynes, UK), and anesthesia was maintained by administration of a mixture of 69% N2O, 29% O2, and 2% isoflurane. The chest was opened in the left, second intercostal space, and the ascending aorta was carefully dissected. A significant stenosis was induced by a tight banding of the ascending aorta with a 3.0 silk suture. For sham-operated animals, the silk suture around the ascending aorta was not tightened. Buprenorphine was administered for postoperative analgesia. After 6 weeks, echocardiography was performed with a Vevo 2100 (Fujifilm VisualSonics, Canada), and short and long axis images of the LV and atrium were obtained. Flow through the mitral and aortic valve was measured. Classification of aortic banding animals into hypertrophy (ABHT) or congestive HF (ABHF) groupings was determined by echocardiographic, hemodynamic, and post-mortem analyses. Criteria for inclusion in the ABHT group were increased posterior wall diameter (>1.9 mm), increased LV weight (>0.75 g), and preserved lung weight (<2.0 g). The criteria for inclusion in the ABHF group were the same as for ABHT, except with increased lung weight (>2.5 g) and left atrial diameter >5.0 mm (16Lunde I.G. Aronsen J.M. Kvaløy H. Qvigstad E.

Cultures of rat neonatal cardiomyocytes were prepared from the LV of 1–3-day-old Wistar rats. The LV was excised, minced, and enzymatically digested with collagenase solution. The cell suspension was incubated in uncoated culture flasks in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 20 min. After 20 min, the non-adherent cells were isolated as cardiomyocytes and seeded onto 6-well culture plates (precoated with 0.2% gelatin and 0.1% fibronectin (both from Sigma-Aldrich)) at a density of 3.75 × 105 ml−1 in plating medium consisting of DMEM (D1152, Sigma-Aldrich), M-199 (M2520, Sigma-Aldrich), penicillin/streptomycin (P0781, Sigma-Aldrich), horse serum (14-403E, BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD), and fetal bovine serum (FBS) (14-701F, BioWhittaker). The cells were incubated in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 24 h before protein fractionation. Rats were anesthetized in a chamber filled with 95% room air and 5% isoflurane (Abbott Scandinavia Ab, Solna, Sweden). Cervical dislocation was performed after abolished pain reflexes were verified. Hearts were then quickly excised and placed in cold 0.15 m NaCl solution with heparin (Heparin LEO, 5000 IE/ml; Orifarm AS, Oslo, Norway). The aorta was then cannulated and retrogradely perfused with a cell isolation buffer containing 130 mm NaCl, 25 mm Hepes, 22 mm d-glucose, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm NaH2PO4, (pH 7.4) (all from Sigma) to wash out blood. The heart was thereafter perfused with cell isolation buffer containing 200 units ml−1 collagenase type II (Worthington) and 0.1 mm Ca2+. After a 20-min perfusion, the heart was cut down, and the atria and right ventricle were removed. The LV was minced and gently shaken at 37 °C for 3–4 min in the same solution used in the perfusion but with the addition of 1% BSA and 0.02 units/ml deoxyribonuclease I (Worthington). The digested ventricular tissue was then filtered (200-μm nylon mesh), and cardiomyocytes were sedimented. The cardiomyocyte pellet was resuspended in cell isolation buffer with 1% BSA and 0.1 mm Ca2+ solution. Isolated cardiomyocytes were stored at room temperature until use. Anti-NCX1 (custom-made, epitope: GQPVFRKVHARDHPIPST), anti-Met369-NCX1 (custom-made, epitope: TRLMTGAGNILKRH), and anti-His were obtained from Genscript Corp. (Piscataway, NJ). Anti-calpain (H-240) (sc-30064), anti-PKC-α (C-20) (sc-208), anti-EGFR (1005) (sc-03), and anti-GAPDH (V-18) (sc-20357) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-calpain-1 (ab39170 and ab89778) were from Abcam (Cambridge, MA), and anti-calpain-1 domain III (9A4H8D3) (208728) was from Calbiochem. Anti-GFP (Living Colors A.v.

Anti-calsequestrin (PA1–913) was from Thermo Scientific. Anti-mouse IgG HRP (NA931V), anti-rabbit IgG HRP (NA934V) affinity-purified polyclonal antibody (both from GE Healthcare), and anti-goat IgG HRP (HAF109, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MI) were used as secondary antibody. Rat hearts and cardiomyocyte cultures were fractionated according to the manufacturer (2145, Compartment protein extraction kit, Millipore). Human and rat lysates were made in parallel to ensure identical treatment of the samples. Protein lysates from human biopsies were prepared using ice-cold PBS-based lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 (X100-500ML, Sigma-Aldrich), 0.1% Tween 20 (161-0781, Bio-Rad), and protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Complete EDTA-free and PhosStop tablets, Roche Applied Science). Biopsies were homogenized twice for 30 s with a Polytron 1200 homogenizer, left on ice for 30 min, and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were stored at −70 °C. Frozen LVs from rats were pulverized in a mortar with liquid nitrogen before transfer to lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton) supplemented with 1 mm PMSF (93482, Sigma-Aldrich) and a Complete Mini EDTA-free tablet (Roche Applied Science). Protease inhibitors were omitted for rat LV lysate treated with active calpain. Tissue samples were homogenized three times for 1 min on ice with a Polytron 1200 homogenizer and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected and stored at −70 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the Micro BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Cloning and mutations of NCX1 and calpain-1 constructs were performed by Genscript. The Mammalian Gene Collection mouse clone BC079673 was used for NCX1 constructs. WT NCX1 (full-length) was cloned into pEGFP-N1 with and without a stop codon before GFP (Clontech) or into the first reading frame of pAdTrack-cytomegalovirus (CMV) shuttle vector (plasmid 16405, Addgene, Cambridge, MA). Alanine mutants (Ala327–336 and Ala364–373) were mutated into NCX1/pEGFP-N1. Deletion mutants of the cytoplasmic loop of NCX1 (NCX1(243–787), NCX1(243–705), NCX1(243–532), NCX1(243–460), and NCX1(243–402)) were cloned into pEGFP-C2 (Clontech). WT rat calpain-1 catalytic subunit (BC061880) was cloned into pCEP4 (Invitrogen), as were the C-terminal FLAG-tagged calpain-1(1–220), calpain-1(213–365), calpain-1(357–525), and calpain-1(519–713). The fidelity of the cloning procedure and mutagenesis were verified by sequence analysis (Genscript). The empty vectors pcDNA3.1 and EGFP-N1 were obtained from Invitrogen and Clontech, respectively.

HEK293 cells were cultured in DMEM (41965-039, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (14-701F, BioWhittaker), 1% non-essential amino acids (10370-021, Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (penicillin/streptomycin, P4333, Sigma-Aldrich) and maintained in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 humidified incubator. The HEK293 cells were transfected with DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 as instructed by the manufacturer (11668-019, Invitrogen). After 24 h, the cells were either subjected to cell lysis or transferred to coverslips for patch clamp experiments. Cell lysis buffer contained 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100 with complete protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science). Protease inhibitors were omitted for HEK293 lysate treated with active calpain. The glass coverslips were precoated with poly-l-lysine (P4707, Sigma-Aldrich), and the transfected cells on the coverslips were incubated for 24 h prior analysis.

The intracellular loop (amino acids 243–799) of rat NCX1 protein (EDM02743) and full-length rat calpain-1 (BC061880) were synthesized as 20-mer peptides with 3-amino acid offsets on cellulose membranes using a Multipep automated peptide synthesizer (INTAVIS Bioanalytical Instruments AG, Köln, Germany) as described (19Frank R. Overwin H. SPOT synthesis: epitope analysis with arrays of synthetic peptides prepared on cellulose membranes.Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 66: 149-169PubMed Google Scholar). The peptide array membranes were blocked in 1% casein in TBST (Tris-buffered saline with 1% Tween) overnight at 4 °C. The calpain and NCX1 overlay were conducted by incubating the membranes with 1 μg/ml recombinant His-TF-NCX1cyt (in 1% casein) or 1 μg/ml recombinant calpain-1 (human erythrocytes, 208713, Calbiochem) (in 1× calpain buffer: 10 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), and 20 mm CaCl2). Thereafter, the membranes were washed five times in TBST for 5 min before binding was detected by immunoblotting. Monoclonal anti-biotin-conjugated beads (A-1559, Sigma-Aldrich) were incubated with 8 μm peptides in 100 μl of PBS for 2 h with rotation. The beads were then washed three times with PBS before incubation with 1 μg of recombinant calpain-1 (Calbiochem) for 2 h at 4 °C. The protein complexes were subsequently washed three times in lysis buffer and boiled for 5 min at 96 °C in 2× SDS loading buffer before SDS-PAGE analysis. Immunoprecipitations were performed using 2 μg of the appropriate antibody. The immunocomplexes were collected by protein A/G-agarose beads (sc-2003, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), washed three times in immunoprecipitation buffer, and boiled in SDS loading buffer before SDS-PAGE analysis. Equal amounts of rabbit IgG (sc-2027) and mouse IgG (sc-2025, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used as negative controls. Isolated adult rat cardiomyocytes were plated on laminin (Sigma-Aldrich)-coated glass coverslips and left to adhere for 1 h. The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (158127, Sigma-Aldrich), permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 (X100, Sigma-Aldrich), and incubated with anti-NCX1 (custom-made, Genscript) and anti-calpain-1 (ab89778, Abcam) overnight at 4 °C. Staining with a custom-made NCX1 blocking peptide (Genscript) or staining in the absence of primary antibodies served as a negative control. The proximity ligation assay (PLA) was performed using the Duolink kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Sigma-Aldrich). In brief, species-specific secondary antibodies, called PLA probes, were added to the cells. These PLA probes, each having a unique short DNA strand attached to it, bound to the primary antibodies. When the PLA probes were in close proximity, <40 nm, the DNA strands hybridized when enzyme ligase solution was added. The signal was amplified via rolling circle amplification using an amplification solution consisting of polymerase, nucleotides, and fluorescence-labeled oligonucleotides. The output signal was visible as distinct fluorescent green spots because we used the green Duolink® In Situ detection reagent (excitation 488 nm, emission 510 nm). The cells were then incubated with 600-nm SYTOX Orange (S-11368; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) (excitation 543 nm, emission 650 nm), a nucleic acid stain, for 10 min at room temperature and rinsed three times for 5 min with PBS. Imaging experiments were performed at 25 °C. The water-based In Situ Mounting Medium (refractive index 1.44), provided in the kit was used to mount the glass coverslip to the glass slide. The cells were visualized with an inverted LSM 710 confocal microscope (Zeiss GmbH, Jena, Germany) equipped with a LD C-Apochromat ×40 objective (numerical aperture 1.1). Sequential optical scans were acquired using the Zeiss ZEN imaging software. Rat heart extract or HEK293 lysates were diluted (1:1) in 2× calpain buffer (1× calpain buffer: 10 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), and 20 mm CaCl2). Subsequently, 1 μg of calpain-1 (Calbiochem) was added, and proteolysis was performed at 37 °C for 1 h. To inhibit calpain, lysates were incubated with 5 μm calpastatin (Millipore) at 37 °C for 30 min before adding active calpain. The reaction was stopped by adding 4× SDS loading buffer. Cleavage was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. AcTEV cleavage was conducted according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer (12575-015, Invitrogen). To induce activation of endogenous calpain, 4 mm CaCl2 was added to the neonatal cardiomyocyte culture. To inhibit calpain, 10 μm calpeptin (Calbiochem) was added prior to the addition of CaCl2. After a 24-h incubation, the membrane proteins were isolated using the Compartment protein extraction kit (Millipore). Lysates and immunoprecipitates were analyzed on 4–15 or 15% SDS-PAGE Criterion (Bio-Rad) and blotted onto PVDF membranes (RPN 303F, GE Healthcare). The PVDF membranes and peptide arrays were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk or 1% casein in TBST for 60 min at room temperature, incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies, washed 3–5 times for 5 min in TBST, and incubated with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. Blots were developed by using ECL Plus or Prime (RPN 2132 or RPN 2232, GE HealthCare). The chemiluminescence signals were detected by Las 1000 or Las-4000 (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). The CaMPDB (Calpain for Modulatory Proteolysis Database) with PSSM and SVM (RBF Kernel) prediction models were used to identify putative calpain cleavage sites in the cytoplasmic region of NCX1 (20DuVerle D.A. Ono Y. Sorimachi H. Mamitsuka H. Calpain cleavage prediction using multiple kernel learning.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e19035Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Whole cell patch clamp experiments were conducted with either pEGFP-N1- or pAdTrack-CMV-transfected HEK293 cells using an Axoclamp 2B amplifier (Axon Instruments) and low resistance pipettes (1–2.5 megaohms). The recordings were performed in an extracellular solution containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm CsCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4 (CsOH), and osmolality 290 mosm. K+, Ca2+, Cl−, and Na+-K+ ATPase currents were blocked by inclusion of cesium, nifedipine (20 μm), niflumic acid (30 μm), and ouabain (1 mm), respectively, in the solution. Patch pipettes were filled with a solution containing 100 mm cesium glutamate, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm Na2-ATP, 10 mm EGTA, CsCl2, pH 7.2, and osmolality 270 mosm. The NCX1 reversal potential under these conditions was −43 mV at 37 °C. Cells were voltage-clamped at −43 mV for 4–5 min to allow sufficient intracellular dialysis. Following a prepulse protocol, NCX1 current was elicited by a descending voltage ramp from 120 to −100 mV. The NCX1 current was calculated as the difference current prior to and following the application of 5 mm Ni2+.

https://openalex.org/W2054650032,"Accurate tool tracking is a crucial task that directly affects the safety and effectiveness of many interventional medical procedures. Compared to CT and MRI, ultrasound-based tool tracking has many advantages, including low cost, safety, mobility and ease of use. However, surgical tools are poorly visualized in conventional ultrasound images, thus preventing effective tool tracking and guidance. Existing tracking methods have not yet provided a solution that effectively solves the tool visualization and mid-plane localization accuracy problem and fully meets the clinical requirements. In this paper, we present an active ultrasound tracking and guiding system for interventional tools. The main principle of this system is to establish a bi-directional ultrasound communication between the interventional tool and US imaging machine within the tissue. This method enables the interventional tool to generate an active ultrasound field over the original imaging ultrasound signals. By controlling the timing and amplitude of the active ultrasound field, a virtual pattern can be directly injected into the US machine B mode display. In this work, we introduce the time and frequency modulation, mid-plane detection, and arbitrary pattern injection methods. The implementation of these methods further improves the target visualization and guiding accuracy, and expands the system application beyond simple tool tracking. We performed ex vitro and in vivo experiments, showing significant improvements of tool visualization and accurate localization using different US imaging platforms. An ultrasound image mid-plane detection accuracy of ±0.3 mm and a detectable tissue depth over 8.5 cm was achieved in the experiment. The system performance is tested under different configurations and system parameters. We also report the first experiment of arbitrary pattern injection to the B mode image and its application in accurate tool tracking."
https://openalex.org/W2019315922,"The African penguin Spheniscus demersus has an 'Endangered' conservation status and a decreasing population. Following abandonment, 841 African penguin chicks in 2006 and 481 in 2007 were admitted to SANCCOB (Southern African Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds) for hand-rearing from colonies in the Western Cape, South Africa, after large numbers of breeding adults commenced moult with chicks still in the nest. Of those admitted, 91% and 73% respectively were released into the wild. There were veterinary concerns about avian malaria, airsacculitis and pneumonia, feather-loss and pododermatitis (bumblefoot). Post-release juvenile (0.32, s.e. = 0.08) and adult (0.76, s.e. = 0.10) survival rates were similar to African penguin chicks reared after oil spills and to recent survival rates recorded for naturally-reared birds. By December 2012, 12 birds had bred, six at their colony of origin, and the apparent recruitment rate was 0.11 (s.e. = 0.03). Hand-rearing of abandoned penguin chicks is recommended as a conservation tool to limit mortality and to bolster the population at specific colonies. The feasibility of conservation translocations for the creation of new colonies for this species using hand-reared chicks warrants investigation. Any such programme would be predicated on adequate disease surveillance programmes established to minimise the risk of disease introduction to wild birds."
https://openalex.org/W2034637872,"Cryptococcus gattii is a basidiomycetous human fungal pathogen that typically causes infection in tropical and subtropical regions and is responsible for an ongoing outbreak in immunocompetent individuals on Vancouver Island and in the Pacific Northwest of the US. Pathogenesis of this species may be linked to its sexual cycle that generates infectious propagules called basidiospores. A marked predominance of only one mating type (α) in clinical and environmental isolates suggests that a-α opposite-sex reproduction may be infrequent or geographically restricted, raising the possibility of an alternative unisexual cycle involving cells of only α mating type, as discovered previously in the related pathogenic species Cryptococcus neoformans. Here we report observation of hallmark features of unisexual reproduction in a clinical isolate of C. gattii (isolate 97/433) and describe genetic and environmental factors conducive to this sexual cycle. Our results are consistent with population genetic evidence of recombination in the largely unisexual populations of C. gattii and provide a useful genetic model for understanding how novel modes of sexual reproduction may contribute to evolution and virulence in this species."

However, the physiological significance of Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination during mitophagy is not fully understood. Here, we report that the suppression of Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination through the removal of Ubc13 activity essentially affects neither PINK1 activation nor the degradation of depolarized mitochondria. Moreover, the inactivation of Ubc13 did not modulate the mitochondrial phenotypes of PINK1 knockdown Drosophila.

https://openalex.org/W1977244401,"The transmembrane ADAM8 (A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase 8) protein is abundantly expressed in human breast tumors and derived metastases compared with normal breast tissue, and plays critical roles in aggressive Triple-Negative breast cancers (TNBCs). During ADAM8 maturation, the inactive proform dimerizes or multimerizes and autocatalytically removes the prodomain leading to the formation of the active, processed form. ADAM8 is a glycoprotein; however, little was known about the structure or functional role of these sugar moieties. Here, we report that in estrogen receptor (ER)α-negative, but not -positive, breast cancer cells ADAM8 contains N-glycosylation, which is required for its correct processing and activation. Consistently ADAM8 dimers were detected on the surface of ERα-negative breast cancer cells but not on ERα-positive ones. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed four N-glycosylazhytion sites (Asn-67, Asn-91, Asn-436, and Asn-612) in human ADAM8. The Asn-67 and Asn-91 prodomain sites contained high mannose, whereas complex type N-glycosylation was observed on Asn-436 and Asn-612 in the active and remnant forms. The Asn-91 and Asn-612 sites were essential for its correct processing and cell surface localization, in particular its exit from the Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum, respectively. The N436Q mutation led to decreased ADAM8 stability due to enhanced lysosomal degradation. In contrast, mutation of the Asn-67 site had only modest effects on enzyme stability and processing. Thus, N-glycosylation is essential for processing, localization, stability, and activity of ADAM8."
https://openalex.org/W2048351097,"Integrated analysis of genomic and transcriptomic level changes holds promise for a better understanding of colorectal cancer (CRC) biology. There is a pertinent need to explain the functional effect of genome level changes by integrating the information at the transcript level. Using high resolution cytogenetics array, we had earlier identified driver genes by ‘Genomic Identification of Significant Targets In Cancer (GISTIC)’ analysis of paired tumour-normal samples from colorectal cancer patients. In this study, we analyze these driver genes at three levels using exon array data – gene, exon and network. Gene level analysis revealed a small subset to experience differential expression. These results were reinforced by carrying out separate differential expression analyses (SAM and LIMMA). ATP8B1 was found to be the novel gene associated with CRC that shows changes at cytogenetic, gene and exon levels. Splice index of 29 exons corresponding to 13 genes was found to be significantly altered in tumour samples. Driver genes were used to construct regulatory networks for tumour and normal groups. There were rearrangements in transcription factor genes suggesting the presence of regulatory switching. The regulatory pattern of AHR gene was found to have the most significant alteration. Our results integrate data with focus on driver genes resulting in highly enriched novel molecules that need further studies to establish their role in CRC."

We present the structure of SbnG bound to the inhibitor calcium and an active site variant in complex with oxaloacetate. The overall fold of SbnG is structurally distinct from TCA cycle citrate synthases yet similar to metal-dependent class II aldolases. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that SbnG forms a separate clade with homologs from other siderophore biosynthetic gene clusters and is representative of a metal-independent subgroup in the phosphoenolpyruvate/pyruvate domain superfamily.

Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive bacterium that colonizes a variety of mammalian hosts, specifically skin and mucosal membranes of the nasal passage and respiratory tract. In hospital settings, S. aureus has a substantial negative impact because of nosocomial cases of pneumonia and surgical wound infections (1Lowy F.D. Staphylococcus aureus infections.N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 520-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (4597) Google Scholar). S. aureus can infiltrate and colonize many human tissue types, leading to a broad range of diseases from boils and sinusitis to more serious conditions like endocarditis and meningitis. Survival of S. aureus depends on the ability to extract iron from the mammalian host. However, iron is actively sequestered as a form of innate immunity against bacterial infection by host proteins such as transferrin, lactoferrin, haptoglobin, and hemopexin (2Weinberg E.D. Iron and susceptibility to infectious disease.Science. 1974; 184: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In response, S. aureus has evolved multiple iron transport systems to maintain a supply of iron from various host sources (3Hammer N.D. Skaar E.P. Molecular mechanisms of Staphylococcus aureus iron acquisition.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2011; 65: 129-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). One of the most commonly employed strategies by bacterial pathogens is the use of siderophore iron acquisition systems. Siderophores are low molecular weight, ferric iron chelators that are synthesized and secreted to scavenge iron from the extracellular environment (for a review, see Ref. 4Hider R.C. Kong X. Chemistry and biology of siderophores.Nat. Prod. Rep. 2010; 27: 637-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar).

Staphyloferrin A is composed of two citrate molecules linked to d-ornithine, assembled by synthetases encoded in the sfa gene cluster (7Beasley F.C. Vines E.D. Grigg J.C. Zheng Q. Liu S. Lajoie G.A.

In contrast to SA, SB is not widespread among staphylococcal spp. and is largely limited to the more pathogenic coagulase-positive staphylococci (10Beasley F.C. Heinrichs D.E. Siderophore-mediated iron acquisition in the staphylococci.J. Inorg. Biochem. 2010; 104: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).

Iron restriction results in the up-regulation of iron uptake systems, including the staphyloferrin siderophore pathways. Conversely, many metabolic pathways with iron-containing enzymes are down-regulated in an effort to conserve the iron pool necessary for survival. A notable down-regulation is observed of TCA enzymes including the citrate synthase, CitZ (12Friedman D.B. Stauff D.L. Pishchany G. Whitwell C.W. Torres V.J. Skaar E.P.

The precursors to citrate production, oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA, are also predicted to be available under iron restriction, through anaplerotic reactions and decarboxylation of pyruvate by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (pdhABC), respectively (12Friedman D.B. Stauff D.L. Pishchany G. Whitwell C.W. Torres V.J. Skaar E.P. Staphylococcus aureus redirects central metabolism to increase iron availability.PLoS Pathog. 2006; 2: e87Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 16Sheldon J.R. Marolda C.L. Heinrichs D.E.

Microbiol. 2014; 92: 824-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). SbnG, therefore, provides an alternate route for citrate to enter the biosynthetic pathway for SB, independent of TCA cycle activity. Homologs of SbnG have also been identified in the biosynthetic gene clusters that produce the siderophores achromobactin and vibrioferrin, suggesting that a unique group of citrate synthases may have evolved for siderophore biosynthesis out of the requirement for citrate to be generated during iron restricted growth. Indeed, SbnG represents a unique citrate synthase, originally annotated as a metal-dependent class II aldolase by sequence analysis; instead, SbnG was reclassified as a metal-independent citrate synthase that utilizes oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA (17Cheung J. Murphy M.E. Heinrichs D.E. Discovery of an iron-regulated citrate synthase in Staphylococcus aureus.Chem. Biol. 2012; 19: 1568-1578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the catalytic mechanism, we report the x-ray crystal structure of SbnG and an active site variant bound to oxaloacetate. Although SbnG is homologous to metal-dependent class II aldolases, we demonstrate through phylogenetic analysis that SbnG is the archetype of a separate metal-independent clade with homologs from other siderophore biosynthetic gene clusters. Furthermore, structural and functional evidence is presented to support a model for convergent evolution in the active site architecture of SbnG and TCA cycle citrate synthases. The SbnG coding region was cloned into pET28a as previously described (17Cheung J. Murphy M.E. Heinrichs D.E. Discovery of an iron-regulated citrate synthase in Staphylococcus aureus.Chem. Biol. 2012; 19: 1568-1578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). SbnG variants (E46Q, H47A, R72A, H96A, E151Q, and D177A) were produced using a modified whole plasmid PCR technique as previously described (18MacPherson I.S. Rosell F.I. Scofield M. Mauk A.G. Murphy M.E. Directed evolution of copper nitrite reductase to a chromogenic reductant.Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2010; 23: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). SbnG variants were introduced into Escherichia coli BL21(λDE3), and the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. His6-SbnG was expressed from E. coli BL21(λDE3) cells inoculated from 5-ml overnight cultures into 2× YT medium supplemented with 25 μg/ml kanamycin and grown at 30 °C to an A600 of ∼0.8. Cultures were then induced with 0.3 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and incubated for ∼16 h at 25 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. Cell pellets were collected by centrifugation at 4400 × g for 10 min, resuspended in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, and lysed at 10,000 psi with an EmulsiFlex-C5 homogenizer (Avestin). The supernatant was isolated after centrifugation at 39,000 × g for 45 min, and His6-SbnG was purified using a 5-ml HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare) with a linear imidazole gradient (0–500 mm). Protein fractions were dialyzed into 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl at 4 °C. The His6 tag was removed by thrombin digestion at a 1:500 mass ratio (thrombin to protein) and incubated over 16 h at 4 °C, followed by dialysis into 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) for 2 h at 4 °C. SbnG was further purified by anion exchange chromatography using a Source 15Q column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and eluted with a NaCl gradient (0–500 mm). SbnG was dialyzed into 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), concentrated to 20 mg/ml, and stored at −80 °C. Selenomethionine-incorporated SbnG was produced by methods previously described (19Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. Atomic structures of the human immunophilin FKBP-12 complexes with FK506 and rapamycin.J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar) and purified in a similar manner to native SbnG. All SbnG variants (E46Q, H47A, R72A, H96A, E151Q, and D177A) were also purified in a similar manner to native SbnG. Selenomethionine-labeled SbnG crystals were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion at room temperature in 1:1 mixtures of 20 mg/ml SbnG in 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0) with reservoir solution of 0.2 m calcium acetate, 0.1 m imidazole (pH 9.0), and 4–6% (w/v) PEG 8000. Crystals were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen following a brief soak in the same buffer supplemented with 20% (v/v) PEG 400 for cryoprotection. Multiwavelength anomalous diffraction data for selenomethionine protein crystals were collected at the Canadian Light Source on Beamline 08B1. The data were processed and scaled using XDS (20Kabsch W. XDS.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (11225) Google Scholar, 21Kabsch W.

Crystals grew in the space group P312 with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. Phase determination and model building were done using AutoSol (initial figure of merit 0.73) and Autobuild (225 of 259 residues built) programs in Phenix (22Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkoczi G.

Native SbnG was crystallized under similar conditions with the addition of 5 mm citrate to the reservoir, and diffraction data were collected at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory on Beamline 7-1. SbnG E151Q crystals were grown by sitting drop at room temperature in a 1:1 mixture of 20 mg/ml SbnG E151Q in 5 mm oxaloacetate, 5 mm coenzyme A, and 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0) with reservoir solution of 5% (v/v) tascimate (pH 7.0), 0.1 m HEPES (pH 7.0), 10% (w/v) PEG monomethyl ether 5000 and ∼40 mm guanidine hydrochloride. SbnG E151Q crystals were soaked for 10 min in 5 mm oxaloacetate/CoA mixture in the same buffer and supplemented with 20% (v/v) PEG 400 for cryoprotection before data collection with a Rigaku MicroMax 007-HF generator, VariMax HR optics, and Saturn CCD 944+ detector. The data sets were processed using Mosflm (23Leslie A.G.W. Powell H.R. Evolving Methods for Macromolecular Crystallography.

A total of three active site residues (15 atoms) from SbnG E151Q (His47, His96, and Asp177) were selected for alignment with the citrate synthase types I and II. Citrate synthase activity of wild type SbnG and variants was measured using the reagent DTNB to quantify the generation of CoA. The concentration of resulting TNB dianion was monitored at 412 nm on a Varian Cary 50 UV-visible spectrophotometer using an extinction coefficient of 14150 m−1 cm−1. Each reaction contained 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm oxaloacetate, 0.2 mm acetyl-CoA, and 10 μm protein. Each reaction was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C followed by the addition of 0.1 mm DTNB reagent. Individual blanks for each reaction contained all required components minus protein. Oxaloacetate-independent activity was recorded by performing the reactions in the absence of oxaloacetate. All reactions were performed in triplicate.

https://openalex.org/W2033971487,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is currently an incurable fatal motor neuron syndrome characterized by progressive weakness, muscle wasting and death ensuing 3–5 years after diagnosis. Neurotrophic factors (NTFs) are known to be important in both nervous system development and maintenance. However, the attempt to translate the potential of NTFs into the therapeutic options remains limited despite substantial number of approaches, which have been tested clinically. Using quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) technique, the present study investigated mRNA expression of four different NTFs: brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), neurotrophin-4/5 (NT-4) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in limb muscles and extraocular muscles (EOMs) from SOD1G93A transgenic mice at early and terminal stages of ALS. General morphological examination revealed that muscle fibres were well preserved in both limb muscles and EOMs in early stage ALS mice. However, in terminal ALS mice, most muscle fibres were either atrophied or hypertrophied in limb muscles but unaffected in EOMs. qRT-PCR analysis showed that in early stage ALS mice, NT-4 was significantly down-regulated in limb muscles whereas NT-3 and GDNF were markedly up-regulated in EOMs. In terminal ALS mice, only GDNF was significantly up-regulated in limb muscles. We concluded that the early down-regulation of NT-4 in limb muscles is closely associated with muscle dystrophy and dysfunction at late stage, whereas the early up-regulations of GDNF and NT-3 in EOMs are closely associated with the relatively well-preserved muscle morphology at late stage. Collectively, the data suggested that comparing NTFs expression between limb muscles and EOMs from different stages of ALS animal models is a useful method in revealing the patho-physiology and progression of ALS, and eventually rescuing motor neuron in ALS patients."
https://openalex.org/W2079803562,"Pharmacological MRI (phMRI) is a neuroimaging technique where drug-induced hemodynamic responses can represent a pharmacodynamic biomarker to delineate underlying biological consequences of drug actions. In most preclinical studies, animals are anesthetized during image acquisition to minimize movement. However, it has been demonstrated anesthesia could attenuate basal neuronal activity, which can confound interpretation of drug-induced brain activation patterns. Significant efforts have been made to establish awake imaging in rodents and nonhuman primates (NHP). Whilst various platforms have been developed for imaging awake NHP, comparison and validation of phMRI data as translational biomarkers across species remain to be explored.We have established an awake NHP imaging model that encompasses comprehensive acclimation procedures with a dedicated animal restrainer. Using a cerebral blood volume (CBV)-based phMRI approach, we have determined differential responses of brain activation elicited by the systemic administration of buprenorphine (0.03 mg/kg i.v.), a partial µ-opioid receptor agonist, in the same animal under awake and anesthetized conditions. Additionally, region-of-interest analyses were performed to determine regional drug-induced CBV time-course data and corresponding area-under-curve (AUC) values from brain areas with high density of µ-opioid receptors.In awake NHPs, group-level analyses revealed buprenorphine significantly activated brain regions including, thalamus, striatum, frontal and cingulate cortices (paired t-test, versus saline vehicle, p<0.05, n = 4). This observation is strikingly consistent with µ-opioid receptor distribution depicted by [6-O-[(11)C]methyl]buprenorphine ([(11)C]BPN) positron emission tomography imaging study in baboons. Furthermore, our findings are consistent with previous buprenorphine phMRI studies in humans and conscious rats which collectively demonstrate the cross-species translatability of awake imaging. Conversely, no significant change in activated brain regions was found in the same animals imaged under the anesthetized condition.Our data highlight the utility and importance of awake NHP imaging as a translational imaging biomarker for drug research."
https://openalex.org/W2171429164,"Corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), a negative acute phase protein produced primarily in the liver, is responsible for the transport of glucocorticoids (GCs). It also modulates the bioavailability of GCs, as only free or unbound steroids are biologically active. Fluctuations in CBG levels therefore can directly affect GC bioavailability. This study investigates the molecular mechanism whereby GCs inhibit the expression of CBG. GCs regulate gene expression via the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which either directly binds to DNA or acts indirectly via tethering to other DNA-bound transcription factors. Although no GC-response elements (GRE) are present in the Cbg promoter, putative binding sites for C/EBPβ, able to tether to the GR, as well as HNF3α involved in GR signaling, are present. C/EBPβ, but not HNF3α, was identified as an important mediator of DEX-mediated inhibition of Cbg promoter activity by using specific deletion and mutant promoter reporter constructs of Cbg. Furthermore, knockdown of C/EBPβ protein expression reduced DEX-induced repression of CBG mRNA, confirming C/EBPβ’s involvement in GC-mediated CBG repression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) after DEX treatment indicated increased co-recruitment of C/EBPβ and GR to the Cbg promoter, while C/EBPβ knockdown prevented GR recruitment. Together, the results suggest that DEX repression of CBG involves tethering of the GR to C/EBPβ."
https://openalex.org/W2037435968,"A new strategy for identifying potent RNase H-dependent antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) is presented. Our analysis of the human transcriptome revealed that a significant proportion of genes contain unique repeated sequences of 16 or more nucleotides in length. Activities of ASOs targeting these repeated sites in several representative genes were compared to those of ASOs targeting unique single sites in the same transcript. Antisense activity at repeated sites was also evaluated in a highly controlled minigene system. Targeting both native and minigene repeat sites resulted in significant increases in potency as compared to targeting of non-repeated sites. The increased potency at these sites is a result of increased frequency of ASO/RNA interactions which, in turn, increases the probability of a productive interaction between the ASO/RNA heteroduplex and human RNase H1 in the cell. These results suggest a new, highly efficient strategy for rapid identification of highly potent ASOs."
https://openalex.org/W2007776026,"Introduction The widespread application of microarray experiments to cancer research is astounding including lung cancer, one of the most common fatal human tumors. Among non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), there are two major histological types of NSCLC, adenocarcinoma (AC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Results In this paper, we proposed to integrate a visualization method called Radial Coordinate Visualization (Radviz) with a suitable classifier, aiming at discriminating two NSCLC subtypes using patients' gene expression profiles. Our analyses on simulated data and a real microarray dataset show that combining with a classification method, Radviz may play a role in selecting relevant features and ameliorating parsimony, while the final model suffers no or least loss of accuracy. Most importantly, a graphic representation is more easily understandable and implementable for a clinician than statistical methods and/or mathematic equations. Conclusion To conclude, using the NSCLC microarray data presented here as a benchmark, the comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanism associated with NSCLC and of the mechanisms with its subtypes and respective stages will become reality in the near future."
https://openalex.org/W1998440318,"Malaria is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among children in Ghana. As part of the effort to inform local and national decision-making in preparation for possible malaria vaccine introduction, this qualitative study explored community-level factors that could affect vaccine acceptance in Ghana and provides recommendations for a health communications strategy. The study was conducted in two purposively selected districts: the Ashanti and Upper East Regions. A total of 25 focus group discussions, 107 in-depth interviews, and 21 semi-structured observations at Child Welfare Clinics were conducted. Malaria was acknowledged to be one of the most common health problems among children. While mosquitoes were linked to the cause and bed nets were considered to be the main preventive method, participants acknowledged that no single measure prevented malaria. The communities highly valued vaccines and cited vaccination as the main motivation for taking children to Child Welfare Clinics. Nevertheless, knowledge of specific vaccines and what they do was limited. While communities accepted the idea of minor vaccine side effects, other side effects perceived to be more serious could deter families from taking children for vaccination, especially during vaccination campaigns. Attendance at Child Welfare Clinics after age nine months was limited. Observations at clinics revealed that while two different opportunities for counseling were offered, little attention was given to addressing mothers’ specific concerns and to answering questions related to child immunization. Positive community attitudes toward vaccines and the understanding that malaria prevention requires a comprehensive approach would support the introduction of a malaria vaccine.

https://openalex.org/W2026443912,"d-Serine is a physiological activator of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) in the nervous system that mediates several NMDAR-mediated processes ranging from normal neurotransmission to neurodegeneration. d-Serine is synthesized from l-serine by serine racemase (SR), a brain-enriched enzyme. However, little is known about the regulation of d-serine synthesis. We now demonstrate that the F-box only protein 22 (FBXO22) interacts with SR and is required for optimal d-serine synthesis in cells. Although FBXO22 is classically associated with the ubiquitin system and is recruited to the Skip1-Cul1-F-box E3 complex, SR interacts preferentially with free FBXO22 species. In vivo ubiquitination and SR half-life determination indicate that FBXO22 does not target SR to the proteasome system. FBXO22 primarily affects SR subcellular localization and seems to increase d-serine synthesis by preventing the association of SR to intracellular membranes. Our data highlight an atypical role of FBXO22 in enhancing d-serine synthesis that is unrelated to its classical effects as a component of the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway. d-Serine is a physiological activator of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) in the nervous system that mediates several NMDAR-mediated processes ranging from normal neurotransmission to neurodegeneration. d-Serine is synthesized from l-serine by serine racemase (SR), a brain-enriched enzyme.

https://openalex.org/W2099511338,"The ectopic expression of the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) in the human adrenal gland causes significant hypercortisolemia after ingestion of each meal and leads to Cushing’s syndrome, implying that human GIPR activation is capable of robustly activating adrenal glucocorticoid secretion. In this study, we transiently transfected the human GIPR expression vector into cultured human adrenocortical carcinoma cells (H295R) and treated them with GIP to examine the direct link between GIPR activation and steroidogenesis. Using quantitative RT-PCR assay, we examined gene expression of steroidogenic related proteins, and carried out immunofluorescence analysis to prove that forced GIPR overexpression directly promotes production of steroidogenic enzymes CYP17A1 and CYP21A2 at the single cell level. Immunofluorescence showed that the transfection efficiency of the GIPR gene in H295R cells was approximately 5%, and GIP stimulation enhanced CYP21A2 and CYP17A1 expression in GIPR-introduced H295R cells (H295R-GIPR). Interestingly, these steroidogenic enzymes were also expressed in the GIPR (–) cells adjacent to the GIPR (+) cells. The mRNA levels of a cholesterol transport protein required for all steroidogenesis, StAR, and steroidogenic enzymes, HSD3β2, CYP11A1, CYP21A2, and CYP17A1 increased 1.2-2.1-fold in GIP-stimulated H295R-GIPR cells. These changes were reflected in the culture medium in which 1.5-fold increase in the cortisol concentration was confirmed. Furthermore, the levels of adenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) receptor and ACTH precursor proopiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA were upregulated 2- and 1.5-fold, respectively. Immunofluorescence showed that ACTH expression was detected in GIP-stimulated H295R-GIPR cells. An ACTH-receptor antagonist significantly inhibited steroidogenic gene expression and cortisol production. Immunostaining for both CYP17A1 and CYP21A2 was attenuated in cells treated with ACTH receptor antagonists as well as with POMC siRNA. These results demonstrated that GIPR activation promoted production and release of ACTH, and that steroidogenesis is activated by endogenously secreted ACTH following GIP administration, at least in part, in H295R cells."
https://openalex.org/W1999774173,"GPR22 is an orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). Since the ligand of the receptor is currently unknown, its biological function has not been investigated in depth. Many GPCRs and their intracellular effectors are targeted to cilia. Cilia are highly conserved eukaryotic microtubule-based organelles that protrude from the membrane of most mammalian cells. They are involved in a large variety of physiological processes and diseases. However, the details of the downstream pathways and mechanisms that maintain cilia length and structure are poorly understood. We show that morpholino knock down or overexpression of gpr22 led to defective left-right (LR) axis formation in the zebrafish embryo. Specifically, defective LR patterning included randomization of the left-specific lateral plate mesodermal genes (LPM) (lefty1, lefty2, southpaw and pitx2a), resulting in randomized cardiac looping. Furthermore, gpr22 inactivation in the Kupffer's vesicle (KV) alone was still able to generate the phenotype, indicating that Gpr22 mainly regulates LR asymmetry through the KV. Analysis of the KV cilia by immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), revealed that gpr22 knock down or overexpression resulted in changes of cilia length and structure. Further, we found that Gpr22 does not act upstream of the two cilia master regulators, Foxj1a and Rfx2. To conclude, our study characterized a novel player in the field of ciliogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2025609859,"Objective Polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40) sequences have been detected in various human specimens and SV40 antibodies have been found in human sera from both healthy individuals and cancer patients. This study analyzed serum samples from healthy pregnant women as well as cord blood samples to determine the prevalence of SV40 antibodies in pregnancy. Methods Serum samples were collected at the time of delivery from two groups of pregnant women as well as cord bloods from one group. The women were born between 1967 and 1993. Samples were assayed by two different serological methods, one group by neutralization of viral infectivity and the other by indirect ELISA employing specific SV40 mimotopes as antigens. Viral DNA assays by real-time polymerase chain reaction were carried out on blood samples. Results Neutralization and ELISA tests indicated that the pregnant women were SV40 antibody-positive with overall prevalences of 10.6% (13/123) and 12.7% (14/110), respectively. SV40 neutralizing antibodies were detected in a low number of cord blood samples. Antibody titers were generally low. No viral DNA was detected in either maternal or cord bloods. Conclusions SV40-specific serum antibodies were detected in pregnant women at the time of delivery and in cord bloods. There was no evidence of transplacental transmission of SV40. These data indicate that SV40 is circulating at a low prevalence in the northern Italian population long after the use of contaminated vaccines."

Compared with other non-viral methods such as lipid or polymer-based DNA delivery vectors, peptide-based DNA delivery systems are biocompatible and biodegradable, which leads to lower immunogenicity and lower toxicity. Moreover, peptide vectors are easier to produce and their compositions easier to control because solid-phase peptide synthesis has been extensively developed. However, peptide-based systems for DNA delivery toward special tumor cells or tissues are still lacking. In this study, we constructed a non-viral 9rR-LTVSPWY peptide-based DNA delivery system and showed that it is able to efficiently and selectively transfect DNA into targeted tumor cells.

https://openalex.org/W2071585496,"Understanding of how neurons transform fluctuations of membrane potential, reflecting input activity, into spike responses, which communicate the ultimate results of single-neuron computation, is one of the central challenges for cellular and computational neuroscience. To study this transformation under controlled conditions, previous work has used a signal immersed in noise paradigm where neurons are injected with a current consisting of fluctuating noise that mimics on-going synaptic activity and a systematic signal whose transmission is studied. One limitation of this established paradigm is that it is designed to examine the encoding of only one signal under a specific, repeated condition. As a result, characterizing how encoding depends on neuronal properties, signal parameters, and the interaction of multiple inputs is cumbersome. Here we introduce a novel fully-defined signal mixture paradigm, which allows us to overcome these problems. In this paradigm, current for injection is synthetized as a sum of artificial postsynaptic currents (PSCs) resulting from the activity of a large population of model presynaptic neurons. PSCs from any presynaptic neuron(s) can be now considered as ""signal"", while the sum of all other inputs is considered as ""noise"". This allows us to study the encoding of a large number of different signals in a single experiment, thus dramatically increasing the throughput of data acquisition. Using this novel paradigm, we characterize the detection of excitatory and inhibitory PSCs from neuronal spike responses over a wide range of amplitudes and firing-rates. We show, that for moderately-sized neuronal populations the detectability of individual inputs is higher for excitatory than for inhibitory inputs during the 2-5 ms following PSC onset, but becomes comparable after 7-8 ms. This transient imbalance of sensitivity in favor of excitation may enhance propagation of balanced signals through neuronal networks. Finally, we discuss several open questions that this novel high-throughput paradigm may address."

Six novel GSK3β transcripts were identified in different tissues and designated as GSK3β1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. RT-PCR was used to further determine whether the six GSK3β transcripts existed in different goat tissues. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the catalytic domain (S_TKc domain) is missing from GSK3β2 and GSK3β4. GSK3β3 and GSK3β6 do not contain the negative regulatory sites that are controlled by p38 MAPK. Furthermore, qRT-PCR and western blot analysis revealed that all the GSK3β transcripts were expressed at the highest level in the heart, whereas their expression levels in the liver, spleen, kidney, brain, longissimus dorsi muscle and uterus were different.

PMI on days 4, 11 and 25 was determined by interaction of N-acetyl glucosamine with the glycosylation dependent desorption of EPO isoforms. At day 25, plasma-EPO in both rhEPO groups had returned to values not different from the placebo group. PMI with placebo, reflecting the endogenous EPO isoforms, averaged 82.5 (10.3) % (mean (SD)). High-dose Epoetin beta decreased PMI on days 4 and 11 to 31.0 (4.2)% (p<0.00001) and 45.2 (7.3)% (p<0.00001). Low-dose Epoetin beta decreased PMI on days 4 and 11 to 46.0 (12.8)% (p<0.00001) and 46.1 (10.4)% (p<0.00001). In both rhEPO groups, PMI on day 25 was still decreased (high-dose Epoetin beta: 72.9 (19.4)% (p=0.029); low-dose Epoetin beta: 73.1 (17.8)% (p=0.039)). In conclusion, Epoetin beta leaves a footprint in the plasma-EPO isoform pattern. MAIIA can detect changes in EPO isoform distribution up til at least three weeks after administration of Epoetin beta even though the total EPO concentration has returned to normal."

To understand in more detail the evolutionary aspects of the transformation of a bacterial multidrug transporter to a mammalian neurotransporter and to learn about mechanisms in a milieu amenable for structural and biochemical studies, we identified, cloned, and partially characterized bacterial homologues of the rat vesicular monoamine transporter (rVMAT2). We performed preliminary biochemical characterization of one of them, Brevibacillus brevis monoamine transporter (BbMAT), from the bacterium B. brevis. BbMAT shares substrates with rVMAT2 and transports them in exchange with >1H+, like the mammalian transporter. Here we present a homology model of BbMAT that has the standard major facilitator superfamily fold; that is, with two domains of six transmembrane helices each, related by 2-fold pseudosymmetry whose axis runs normal to the membrane and between the two halves. The model predicts that four carboxyl residues, a histidine, and an arginine are located in the transmembrane segments.

The above findings led us to study bacterial homologues to try to understand in greater detail the evolutionary aspects of the transformation of a bacterial MDT to a mammalian vesicular neurotransmitter transporter and to unveil mechanisms in a milieu more amenable to structural, biochemical, and biophysical studies. Crystal structures and subsequent mechanistic studies of prokaryotic homologues of mammalian neurotransporters have had a major impact on the field (11Singh S.K.

We identified over a dozen candidate transporters and chose to biochemically characterize one from Brevibacillus brevis (B. brevis monoamine transporter, BbMAT). It displays high sequence homology (25% identity and 52% similarity) to and shares some of the substrates (MPP+ and acriflavine) with rVMAT2, using exchange for multiple protons as the driving force. Because these bacterial multidrug transporters translocate toxic compounds and antibiotics away from the cytoplasm, they confer resistance against these toxins, and they have been associated with the phenomenon of resistance to multiple antibiotics. Antimicrobial resistance has been identified recently as one of the most serious health threats in a 2013 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report (15Center for Disease Control (2013) Annual Report of the Centers for Disease Control. USA Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA.Google Scholar). Therefore, study of these homologues should also aid in understanding basic mechanisms of antibiotic resistance. Despite exciting recent progress, three-dimensional structures are available for only 13 MFS proteins, none of which have been shown to function as an H+-coupled antiporter (16Yan N. Structural advances for the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporters.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2013; 38: 151-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar).

As expected, the model contains 12 transmembrane (TM) helices, arranged in two domains of six TMs each, which are related by 2-fold pseudosymmetry with an axis that runs normal to the membrane and between the two halves. According to this model, there are four membrane-embedded carboxylic amino acids, but we show that only two, Asp-25 (TM1) and Glu-229 (TM7), are essential for transport. Given that the equivalent residues in rVMAT2 are crucial for transport activity, we suggest analogous roles for these residues in the two proteins. A BLAST search using the rVMAT2 sequence as a query against the non-redundant database of the available microbial genomes was performed using the NCBI server.

To build a molecular model of BbMAT, we searched for a template structure using the following search tools: PSI-BLAST v2.2.29 (20Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W.

Kucukural A. Zhang Y. I-TASSER: a unified platform for automated protein structure and function prediction.Nat. Protoc. 2010; 5: 725-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4695) Google Scholar) on the basis of multiple-threading alignments obtained from the LOMETS (22Wu S. Zhang Y. LOMETS: a local meta-threading-server for protein structure prediction.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 3375-3382Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar) metaserver, and HHblits (from HH-suite v2.0) (23Remmert M. Biegert A. Hauser A. Söding J. HHblits: lightning-fast iterative protein sequence searching by HMM-HMM alignment.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9: 173-175Crossref Scopus (1321) Google Scholar) using a non-redundant PDB sequence database clustered at 70% sequence identity. Databases were dated July 12, 2014. The crystal structure of a putative proton-driven E. coli transporter, YajR, in an outward-facing conformation (PDB code 3WDO) (17Jiang D. Zhao Y. Wang X. Fan J. Heng J. Liu X. Feng W. Kang X. Huang B. Liu J. Zhang X.C. Structure of the YajR transporter suggests a transport mechanism based on the conserved motif A.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 14664-14669Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) exhibited the highest sequence identity (∼20%) and excellent coverage (∼90%), with E-values from PSI-BLAST and HHblits of 6 × 10−38 and 8.6 × 10−34, respectively. The structure of YajR was therefore selected as the most suitable template. In preparation for modeling, a preliminary pair-wise sequence alignment of YajR and BbMAT was constructed using the AlignMe PST mode on the AlignMe server v1.1 (24Stamm M. Staritzbichler R. Khafizov K. Forrest L.R. AlignMe: a membrane protein sequence alignment web server.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: W246-W251Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Conserved MFS and DHA12 sequence motifs were aligned correctly (10Vardy E. Steiner-Mordoch S. Schuldiner S.

Alternative sequence matches were identified on the basis of a multiple sequence alignment obtained using the PRALINETM server (26Simossis V.A. Heringa J. PRALINE: a multiple sequence alignment toolbox that integrates homology-extended and secondary structure information.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W289-W294Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) and on a multiple structure alignment generated using MAMMOTH-mult (27Lupyan D.

These proteins were identified with the search tools used to find the template. Adjustments to the AlignMe alignment were made in the following residues of the BbMAT sequence: 42–43, 113–116, 133–134, 199–206, 241–301, and 324–334. The adjustments were selected to optimize the agreement with PSIPRED v3.2 (28Jones D.T. Protein secondary structure prediction based on position-specific scoring matrices.J. Mol.

For each adjustment, the effect on the per-residue and total ProQM (31Ray A. Lindahl E. Wallner B. Model quality assessment for membrane proteins.Bioinformatics. 2010; 26: 3067-3074Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) scores was tracked. In the final alignment, ∼17% of the residues are identical, and the similarity reaches ∼44%, as estimated over the whole sequence but excluding residues 1–6 in the N terminus and residues 389–405 in the C terminus. The four helices that contain the pore-lining residues investigated in this study, namely TM1, TM4, TM7, and TM11, exhibit a similarity with the template of 45, 54, 43, and 63%, respectively. The final alignment (Fig. 3B) was used to build a total of 300 homology models of BbMAT on the basis of YajR using MODELLER (version 9.13) (32Eswar N. Webb B. Marti-Renom M.A. Madhusudhan M.S.

Protein Sci. 2007; 50: 2.9.1-2.9.31Crossref Google Scholar). α Helix constraints were applied for residues 113–119 and 311–315 of TM4 and TM10, respectively. The best BbMAT model (Fig. 3A) was selected as that with the lowest Molpdf energy value of MODELLER (32Eswar N. Webb B. Marti-Renom M.A. Madhusudhan M.S. Eramian D. Shen M.Y. Pieper U. Sali A.

The desired gene was cloned into pT7-7-Myc-His6 plasmid by PCR using genomic DNA from B. brevis as the template (DSM30, ATCC, catalog no. 8246). Primers were designed to overlap the ends of the gene and included restriction sites for NdeI and EcoRI. The plasmid was named pT7-7 BbMAT. For simplicity, the BbMAT-Myc-His6 protein is termed BbMAT. Site-directed mutagenesis was accomplished with the QuikChange® II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and the sequences of all constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The sequence of BbMAT cloned and sequenced from the above strain differs from Uniprot entry C0ZB03 as follows: K42M, I59V, M75V, G102A, T137A, K194R, V196E, M260L, G270S, Y275F, K276Q, M283I, W294L, I308V, G321A, T394A, S395R, S397C, and I398T (the first letter denotes the amino acid in the Uniprot entry C0ZB03 sequence, the number is the position in the sequence, and the second letter is the amino acid as sequenced in our laboratory). The new, experimentally determined sequence was used in all our studies. Resistance to toxic compounds was assessed essentially as described in Ref. 36Rotem D. Schuldiner S.

For experiments on solid medium, cells were diluted to an A600 of 0.2, and 4.5 μl of a series of 10-fold dilutions were spotted on LB plates containing 30 mm BisTris propane (pH 7) and 100 μg/ml ampicillin with or without the addition of the indicated concentration of the toxic compound. Growth was analyzed after overnight incubation at 37 °C. For experiments in liquid medium, cells were diluted to an A600 of 0.01 and grown for 12 h in LB medium containing 30 mm BisTris propane (pH 7) and 100 μg/ml ampicillin with or without the addition of an increasing concentration of the toxic compound. The cells were grown in a Synergy 2 Alpha microplate reader (BioTek) at 37 °C, and A600 was measured automatically by the device. IC50 was calculated from growth observed after 6 h. Overexpression, purification, and reconstitution of BbMAT were performed essentially as described for EmrE, with the following modifications (38Soskine M. Adam Y. Schuldiner S. Direct evidence for substrate-induced proton release in detergent-solubilized EmrE, a multidrug transporter.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9951-9955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). E. coli C41 cells bearing the pT7-7 plasmid with either wild-type BbMAT or different mutants were grown in LB medium to an A600 of 0.5. Protein expression was induced by adding isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 300 μm, followed by a 10- to 12-h incubation at 20 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice with lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 15 mm Tris (pH 7.5), and 250 mm sucrose) before further handling or storage at −70 °C. Cells were then resuspended in sodium-sucrose buffer containing 2.5 mm MgSO4, 15 μg/liter culture DNase, and 1 mm PMSF and lysed with a LV1 microfluidizer (Microfluidics) at 16,000 psi. Unbroken cells were sedimented by centrifugation, and the membrane fraction was collected by ultracentrifugation at 245,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C and resuspended in sodium-sucrose buffer. The membranes were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. Reconstitution was performed by solubilizing membranes containing ∼10 μg of His-tagged protein in sodium buffer (150 mm NaCl, 15 mm Tris (pH 7.5)) containing 0.5% lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (Anatrace) and 0.5 mm PMSF. After 60 min at 4 °C, unsolubilized material was pelleted by centrifugation (208,000 × g for 15 min), imidazole was added to 10 mm, and the His-tagged protein was incubated with 10 μl Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen) for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were then washed once with 10 volumes of sodium buffer with 0.005% lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol and 20 mm imidazole and washed three times with 10 volumes of the same solution but with 1% octyl-glucoside (Anatrace) instead of lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol. The protein was eluted with 500 μl of the octyl-glucoside buffer containing 450 mm imidazole and mixed with 5 mg of E. coli polar lipid extract (Avanti) suspended in 500 μl of sodium buffer and 1.2% octyl-glucoside. Eluted protein and phospholipids were sonicated together in a bath-type sonicator to clarity. To remove detergent, the mixture was dialyzed (dialysis membrane molecular weight cutoff 12–14 kDa) overnight at 4 °C against 300 volumes of the appropriate buffer (140 mm (NH4)2-SO4 with 15 mm Tris-SO4 (pH 7.4)). Dialysis buffer was exchanged with fresh buffer for an additional 2 h, and then the mixture was ultracentrifuged for 70 min at 200,000 × g. The liposome pellet was resuspended in 150 μl of the above buffer, divided into 25-μl aliquots, and stored at −70 °C. To quantify the amount of protein, liposomes were solubilized in a denaturing buffer (15 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 2% SDS, and 6 m urea) at room temperature for 20 min. The solubilized liposomes were then centrifuged (208,000 × g, 20 min) to remove the insoluble fraction. The supernatant was incubated at 4 °C with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads for 1 h, and the beads were subsequently washed with denaturing buffer. Protein was eluted with sample buffer containing 450 mm imidazole, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on 15% Laemmli gels (39Laemmli U. Cleavage of structural proteins during the assembly of the head of bacteriophage T4.Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar), stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and digitally analyzed with Image Gauge 3.46 Fujifilm software. To evaluate expression levels, membranes were solubilized, separated via SDS-PAGE, and analyzed as described above. Liposomes were thawed and sonicated to clarity in a bath-type sonicator. Uptake was measured in reaction buffer containing 140 mm K2SO4, 15 mm Tricine, 15 mm glycine, and 5 mm MgCl2 (pH 9). Liposomes (1.5 μl) were diluted into 200 μl of reaction buffer with 50 nm valinomycin (unless indicated otherwise) and the indicated concentrations of the radiolabeled MPP+, usually 1 μm. Nonspecific accumulation of [3H]MPP+ was measured in the presence of the ionophore nigericin (15 μm) and subtracted from total transport. The reaction was terminated at the indicated time points by diluting the mixture in 2 ml of ice-cold buffer, filtering through 0.2-μm Supor®-200 filters (PALL), and washing with an additional 2 ml of ice-cold buffer. Radioactivity in the liposomes was measured via liquid scintillation. To assess inhibition by different compounds, liposomes were incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of the indicated compound together with [3H]MPP+ (1 μm). Data were analyzed with Origin 8.6 (OriginLab). All experiments were performed in duplicate and repeated at least twice (the lowest R-squared value is 0.95). Transport of ethidium in whole cells can be followed conveniently because of the intense increase in ethidium fluorescence after binding with DNA. In this assay, the endogenous energy sources and the proton electrochemical gradient are depleted by treatment with an uncoupler. Under these conditions, ethidium transport is driven only by its chemical gradient. The proton electrochemical gradient can be restored quickly, after removal of the uncoupler, by the addition of glucose. The protocol used for this assay was essentially as described previously (40Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. EmrE, an Escherichia coli 12-kDa multidrug transporter, exchanges toxic cations and H+ and is soluble in organic solvents.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6856-6863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. EmrE and MdfA are the primary endogenous ethidium transporters in E. coli, so we used the knockout strain BW251113 ΔemrEΔmdfA, which has very low background activity (34Tal N. Schuldiner S.

https://openalex.org/W2006788042,"Botulinum neurotoxin type A1 (BoNT/A1) is a potent protein toxin responsible for the potentially fatal human illness botulism. Notwithstanding, the long-lasting flaccid muscle paralysis caused by BoNT/A has led to its utility as a powerful and versatile bio-pharmaceutical. The flaccid paralysis is due to specific cleavage of neuronal SNAREs by BoNTs. However, actions of BoNTs on intoxicated neurons besides the cleavage of SNAREs have not been studied in detail. In this study we investigated by microarray analysis the effects of BoNT/A and a catalytically inactive derivative (BoNT/A ad) on the transcriptome of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neurons at 2 days and 2 weeks after exposure. While there were only minor changes in expression levels at 2 days post exposure, at 2 weeks post exposure 492 genes were differentially expressed more than 2-fold in BoNT/A1-exposed cells when compared to non-exposed populations, and 682 genes were differentially expressed in BoNT/A ad-exposed cells. The vast majority of genes were similarly regulated in BoNT/A1 and BoNT/A ad-exposed neurons, and the few genes differentially regulated between BoNT/A1 and BoNT/A ad-exposed neurons were differentially expressed less than 3.5 fold. These data indicate a similar response of neurons to BoNT/A1 and BoNT/A ad exposure. The most highly regulated genes in cells exposed to either BoNT/A1 or BoNT/A ad are involved in neurite outgrowth and calcium channel sensitization."
https://openalex.org/W1976275167,"We have reported previously that nonmuscle myosin II-interacting guanine nucleotide exchange factor (MyoGEF) plays an important role in the regulation of cell migration and cytokinesis. Like many other guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), MyoGEF contains a Dbl homology (DH) domain and a pleckstrin homology domain. In this study, we provide evidence demonstrating that intramolecular interactions between the DH domain (residues 162-351) and the carboxyl-terminal region (501-790) of MyoGEF can inhibit MyoGEF functions. In vitro and in vivo pulldown assays showed that the carboxyl-terminal region (residues 501-790) of MyoGEF could interact with the DH domain but not with the pleckstrin homology domain. Expression of a MyoGEF carboxyl-terminal fragment (residues 501-790) decreased RhoA activation and suppressed actin filament formation in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Additionally, Matrigel invasion assays showed that exogenous expression of the MyoGEF carboxyl-terminal region decreased the invasion activity of MDA-MB-231 cells. Moreover, coimmunoprecipitation assays showed that phosphorylation of the MyoGEF carboxyl-terminal region by aurora B kinase interfered with the intramolecular interactions of MyoGEF. Furthermore, expression of the MyoGEF carboxyl-terminal region interfered with RhoA localization during cytokinesis and led to an increase in multinucleation. Together, our findings suggest that binding of the carboxyl-terminal region of MyoGEF to its DH domain acts as an autoinhibitory mechanism for the regulation of MyoGEF activation."
https://openalex.org/W1985045896,"Background An association between male fertility and risk of prostate cancer has been suggested, possibly through lower androgen levels in subfertile men. We evaluated male fertility in relation to risk of prostate cancer by assessing the frequency of fathering of dizygotic twins, a marker of high fertility, among cases of prostate cancer and controls. Methods We performed a case-control study in Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden (PCBaSe), a nationwide, population-based cohort. PCBaSe was linked to the Swedish twin register for information on zygosity for same-sex twins and to other nationwide health care registers and demographic databases for information on socioeconomic factors, comorbidity, and tumor characteristics for 96 301 prostate cancer cases and 378 583 matched controls. To account for the influence of in vitro fertilization on dizygotic twinning, analyses were restricted to men who had fathered children before 1991, when in vitro fertilization was still uncommon in Sweden. Results 1 112 cases and 4 538 controls had fathered dizygotic twins. Men with dizygotic twins had no increased risk of prostate cancer compared to fathers of singletons; neither for total prostate cancer odds ratio (OR) 0.95(95% CI 0.89–1.02), nor for any risk category, OR 0.97 (95% CI 0.84–1.12) for low-risk disease, and OR 1.04 (95% CI 0.90–1.22) for metastatic disease. Conclusion The lack of association between fathering of dizygotic twins and prostate cancer risk give no support for an association between male fertility and prostate cancer risk."
