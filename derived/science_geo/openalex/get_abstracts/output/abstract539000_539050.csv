https://openalex.org/W1952608303,"Many proteins contain disordered regions of low-sequence complexity, which cause aging-associated diseases because they are prone to aggregate. Here, we study FUS, a prion-like protein containing intrinsically disordered domains associated with the neurodegenerative disease ALS. We show that, in cells, FUS forms liquid compartments at sites of DNA damage and in the cytoplasm upon stress. We confirm this by reconstituting liquid FUS compartments in vitro. Using an in vitro ""aging"" experiment, we demonstrate that liquid droplets of FUS protein convert with time from a liquid to an aggregated state, and this conversion is accelerated by patient-derived mutations. We conclude that the physiological role of FUS requires forming dynamic liquid-like compartments. We propose that liquid-like compartments carry the trade-off between functionality and risk of aggregation and that aberrant phase transitions within liquid-like compartments lie at the heart of ALS and, presumably, other age-related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1945156854,"Regulatory T (Treg) cells suppress immune responses to a broad range of non-microbial and microbial antigens and indirectly limit immune inflammation-inflicted tissue damage by employing multiple mechanisms of suppression. Here, we demonstrate that selective Treg cell deficiency in amphiregulin leads to severe acute lung damage and decreased blood oxygen concentration during influenza virus infection without any measureable alterations in Treg cell suppressor function, antiviral immune responses, or viral load. This tissue repair modality is mobilized in Treg cells in response to inflammatory mediator IL-18 or alarmin IL-33, but not by TCR signaling that is required for suppressor function. These results suggest that, during infectious lung injury, Treg cells have a major direct and non-redundant role in tissue repair and maintenance-distinct from their role in suppression of immune responses and inflammation-and that these two essential Treg cell functions are invoked by separable cues."

Recently, we harnessed Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (SaCas9), which is significantly smaller than Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9), to facilitate efficient in vivo genome editing. Here, we report the crystal structures of SaCas9 in complex with a single guide RNA (sgRNA) and its double-stranded DNA targets, containing the 5'-TTGAAT-3' PAM and the 5'-TTGGGT-3' PAM, at 2.6 and 2.7 Å resolutions, respectively. The structures revealed the mechanism of the relaxed recognition of the 5'-NNGRRT-3' PAM by SaCas9. A structural comparison of SaCas9 with SpCas9 highlighted both structural conservation and divergence, explaining their distinct PAM specificities and orthologous sgRNA recognition. Finally, we applied the structural information about this minimal Cas9 to rationally design compact transcriptional activators and inducible nucleases, to further expand the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing toolbox."
https://openalex.org/W2123985235,"Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons constitute a major neuromodulatory system implicated in normal cognition and neurodegenerative dementias. Cholinergic projections densely innervate neocortex, releasing acetylcholine to regulate arousal, attention, and learning. However, their precise behavioral function is poorly understood because identified cholinergic neurons have never been recorded during behavior. To determine which aspects of cognition their activity might support, we recorded cholinergic neurons using optogenetic identification in mice performing an auditory detection task requiring sustained attention. We found that a non-cholinergic basal forebrain population-but not cholinergic neurons-were correlated with trial-to-trial measures of attention. Surprisingly, cholinergic neurons responded to reward and punishment with unusual speed and precision (18 ± 3 ms). Cholinergic responses were scaled by the unexpectedness of reinforcement and were highly similar across neurons and two nuclei innervating distinct cortical areas. These results reveal that the cholinergic system broadcasts a rapid and precisely timed reinforcement signal, supporting fast cortical activation and plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W1918704078,"The exosome regulates the processing, degradation, and surveillance of a plethora of RNA species. However, little is known about how the exosome recognizes and is recruited to its diverse substrates. We report the identification of adaptor proteins that recruit the exosome-associated helicase, Mtr4, to unique RNA substrates. Nop53, the yeast homolog of the tumor suppressor PICT1, targets Mtr4 to pre-ribosomal particles for exosome-mediated processing, while a second adaptor Utp18 recruits Mtr4 to cleaved rRNA fragments destined for degradation by the exosome. Both Nop53 and Utp18 contain the same consensus motif, through which they dock to the ""arch"" domain of Mtr4 and target it to specific substrates. These findings show that the exosome employs a general mechanism of recruitment to defined substrates and that this process is regulated through adaptor proteins."

Thus, TMEM175 comprises a K+ channel that underlies the molecular mechanism of lysosomal K+ permeability. A hallmark of eukaryotic cells is the separation of cellular functions in membrane-bound organelles in the cytosol. Voltage gradients exist across both plasma and organelle membranes. The plasma membrane potential (Vm) regulates cellular processes fundamental to life, including fertilization, gene expression, secretion, neuronal communication, and the beating of cardiac cells. At rest, the plasma membrane is much more permeable to K+ than to Na+, leading to a resting Vm closer to the equilibrium potential of K+ (EK) (see Hille, 2001Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes.Third Edition. Sinauer Associates, 2001Google Scholar for review). K+ channels represent the largest superfamily of ion-selective channels, with ∼80 pore-forming subunit-encoding genes and many more “auxiliary” subunit ones in humans (see Huang and Jan, 2014Huang X.

Despite the divergence in sequence and structure among the ∼80 K+ channels, their ion-selective filters are all formed by similar membrane re-entrant P loops containing the GYG/GFG K+ channel signature (Doyle et al., 1998Doyle D.A.

Mutations affecting internal TEA blockade identify the probable pore-forming region of a K+ channel.Science. 1991; 251: 939-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). In addition to voltage-dependent K+ channels, there is also a family of voltage- and time-independent “leak” (K2P) K+ channels (see Goldstein et al., 2001Goldstein S.A. Bockenhauer D. O’Kelly I. Zilberberg N. Potassium leak channels and the KCNK family of two-P-domain subunits.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar for review). K2Ps regulate resting background K+ conductance. Intriguingly, K2Ps are only found in eukaryotes. It is unknown whether the plasma membranes of bacteria and archaea also have “leak-like” K+ channels. In lysosomes and endosomes, electrical potential across the organelle membrane (ΔΨ, defined as Vcytosol − Vlumen; Bertl et al., 1992Bertl A. Blumwald E. Coronado R. Eisenberg R. Findlay G. Gradmann D. Hille B. Köhler K. Kolb H.-A. MacRobbie E. et al.Electrical measurements on endomembranes.Science. 1992; 258: 873-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar; Figure 1A) may vary among cells and individual organelles as the organelles mature from early to late endosomes. The ionic conductances determining ΔΨ have not been well studied. Earlier indirect studies using the measurement of each ion’s ability to influence lysosome luminal pH or to protect the organelles from osmotic lysis suggest that lysosomes are permeable to cations with an approximate permeability sequence of Cs+>K+>>Na+ (Casey et al., 1978Casey R.P.

Acta. 1978; 508: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, Henning, 1975Henning R. pH gradient across the lysosomal membrane generated by selective cation permeability and Donnan equilibrium.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 401: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Recent studies have uncovered several lysosomal ion channels/transporters conducting Cl−, H+, Ca2+, and Na+ (see Xu and Ren, 2015Xu H. Ren D. Lysosomal physiology.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2015; 77: 57-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) for review). However, the molecular identity of the large K+ permeability, its contribution to ΔΨ, and ΔΨ’s roles in cellular functions are little understood. In this report, we discovered a “leak-like” K+ conductance KEL on endosomes and lysosomes. Using candidate gene screening, we found that TMEM175, a previously uncharacterized family of transmembrane proteins, form KEL. Bacteria and archaea also have TMEM175 homologs that form plasma membrane K+-permeable channels. Therefore, TMEM175 represents a new K+ channel family found in all the three domains of life. Unlike plasma membranes, the organelle membrane has little redundancy to K+ channel proteins; knocking out TMEM175 eliminates the K+ conductance and leads to compromised organelle lysosomal pH stability and abnormal organelle fusion during autophagy. To directly record the K+ permeability, we used whole-organelle patch clamp to measure the charge flow rates (currents) across lysosomal membranes with K+ as the major ion (Figure 1A). Similar to those we previously recorded from peritoneal macrophages (Cang et al., 2014Cang C. Bekele B. Ren D. The voltage-gated sodium channel TPC1 confers endolysosomal excitability.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2014; 10: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), lysosomes from primary cells cultured from mice, including glia (Figures 1B–1D), neurons, cardiac myocytes, and cardiac fibroblasts (Figure S1), all had high densities (∼50 pA/pF at +100 mV) of K+ currents. On plasma membranes, there is a large degree of heterogeneity in the kinetics of activation, inactivation, and deactivation in the K+ conductances (Hille, 2001Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes.Third Edition. Sinauer Associates, 2001Google Scholar). Such heterogeneity appeared to be absent or minimal in lysosomes recorded from both excitable and non-excitable cells. In response to changes in voltage, the current amplitudes changed instantaneously, were proportional to the applied voltages, and had no obvious inactivation or rectification, properties of a voltage- and time-independent, leak-like K+ channel conductance (Figures 1C and S1). To test whether similar K+ conductance is present in other intracellular organelles, we patch clamped endosomes (Saito et al., 2007Saito M. Hanson P.I. Schlesinger P. Luminal chloride-dependent activation of endosome calcium channels: patch clamp study of enlarged endosomes.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27327-27333Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To facilitate whole-organelle recording, we enlarged the endosomes with transfection of Rab5-Q79L, a Rab5 mutant that enlarges endosomes (Stenmark et al., 1994Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lütcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. Inhibition of rab5 GTPase activity stimulates membrane fusion in endocytosis.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). In endosomes tested in all the cell types cultured from mice, including neurons (Figures 1E and 1F), glia (Figure 1G) and cell lines, we detected K+ currents with properties similar to those found in lysosomes. These results indicate that both endosomes and lysosomes have a leak-like K+ conductance (KEL), which presumably underlies the K+ permeability. Consistent with the idea that KEL is constitutively open, the resting ΔΨ of lysosomes, like that of Vm, was highly dependent on [K+] (Figures 1H and 1I). We set out to identify the KEL-encoding gene. Among the ∼80 canonical K+ channels characterized on plasma membranes, only the K2P family has biophysical properties that resemble KEL (Goldstein et al., 2001Goldstein S.A. Bockenhauer D. O’Kelly I. Zilberberg N. Potassium leak channels and the KCNK family of two-P-domain subunits.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). K2P1 protein has been detected in endosomes using immunostaining (Honoré, 2007Honoré E. The neuronal background K2P channels: focus on TREK1.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Overexpressing K2P1 in HEK293T cells, however, led to no obvious increase in KEL-like currents recorded from endosomes (enlarged with Rab5-Q79L) or lysosomes (enlarged with vacuolin-1) (n = 15). We next used a whole-organelle patch-clamp-based candidate gene screening to test whether previously under-characterized proteins form KEL. We used the following candidate selection criteria: (1) the protein was found in our previous lysosomal proteomic analysis (Chapel et al., 2013Chapel A. Kieffer-Jaquinod S. Sagné C. Verdon Q. Ivaldi C. Mellal M. Thirion J. Jadot M. Bruley C. Garin J. et al.An extended proteome map of the lysosomal membrane reveals novel potential transporters.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2013; 12: 1572-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) or is known to lead to lysosome-related disease when mutated; (2) the protein is predicted to have at least one transmembrane spanning (TM) domain; and (3) the protein has not been functionally established as an ion channel/transporter. Because of the small size (∼−80 pA at −100 mV in HEK293T cell lysosomes) of the native KEL current (IKEL) and potential genetic redundancy, a loss-of-function approach with shRNAs to partially knockdown candidate proteins might not be sufficiently sensitive for the screening. We instead used a gain-of-function approach by testing whether overexpression of candidate proteins increased lysosomal currents. To screen proteins for channel current, we performed recordings under conditions that detected K+, Na+, and Cl− currents. We also included amino acids in the pipette solution to detect amino-acid-activated conductance. Out of the 16 candidates, 12 of which were detected in our previous proteomic analysis (Chapel et al., 2013Chapel A. Kieffer-Jaquinod S. Sagné C. Verdon Q. Ivaldi C. Mellal M. Thirion J. Jadot M. Bruley C. Garin J. et al.An extended proteome map of the lysosomal membrane reveals novel potential transporters.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2013; 12: 1572-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), only 1 (TMEM175) led to a large increase of IKEL-like currents (Figure 2). TMEM175 (transmembrane protein 175) has no significant sequence similarity to any other protein with known function. Homologs are found in archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes and are grouped together into a superfamily by the presence of one (in archaea and bacteria) or two (in eukaryotes) copies of DUF1211 (domain-of-unknown-function). Within eukaryotes, TMEM175 is found in both unicellular organisms such as the choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta (Genbank: XP_004995857) and marine microalgae Nannochloropsis gaditana (EWM26717) and multicellular organisms, including invertebrate and vertebrate animals. Among animals, TMEM175s are highly conserved (81% identity between human and mouse, 62% between human and zebrafish). Expressed-sequence-tag and RNA-sequencing databases suggest that human TMEM175 (hTMEM175) is expressed in all tissues/organs, including the heart, brain, testis, kidney, and liver, and in cultured cell lines. Using hydrophobicity analysis (Figure 3A) and a hidden Markov model method (Tusnády and Simon, 2001Tusnády G.E. Simon I. The HMMTOP transmembrane topology prediction server.Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 849-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar), hTMEM175 is predicted to have a two-repeat structure, with each repeat containing six TMs (S1–S6, Figure S2A). The two repeats have significant sequence similarity (Figure S2B), especially in the first TMs (IS1 and IIS1). This 2 × 6TM structure is similar to that of the two-repeat Na+ channels TPCs (Zhu et al., 2010Zhu M.X. Ma J. Parrington J. Calcraft P.J. Galione A. Evans A.M. Calcium signaling via two-pore channels: local or global, that is the question.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2010; 298: C430-C441Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). TMEM175’s S4s have no obvious voltage-sensing domains characterized by the presence of charged residues, unlike in KVs, NaVs, CaVs, and TPCs. Intriguingly, the predicted S5–S6 linkers in both the repeats are short (4 aa). A GYG/GFG-signature-containing P loop (Figure S2A), a linker that reenters the membrane to form the selectivity filter of all the known K+ channels, is lacking (MacKinnon and Miller, 1989MacKinnon R.

Using an accessible-cavity geometry-based set of criteria (Pore-Walker) (Nugent and Jones, 2012Nugent T. Jones D.T.

To elucidate the localization of TMEM175, we tagged hTMEM175 with fluorescence proteins at its N terminus (with EYFP) or C terminus (with EGFP) (Figure 3B). The tagged TMEM175 partially colocalized with endosomal (Rab5, Figures 3C and 3E) and lysosomal (Lamp1, Figures 3D and 3F; Chapel et al., 2013Chapel A. Kieffer-Jaquinod S. Sagné C. Verdon Q.

Because GFP and YFP lose fluorescence at acidic pH found in the lumen of lysosomes, the detection of bright YFP and GFP signals overlapping with Lamp1 suggests that the N and C termini of TMEM175 are localized in the cytosol (Figure 3A), a topology similar to that of TPCs (Zhu et al., 2010Zhu M.X. Ma J. Parrington J. Calcraft P.J. Galione A. Evans A.M. Calcium signaling via two-pore channels: local or global, that is the question.Am. J. Physiol.

We transfected HEK293T cells with YFP-tagged hTMEM175 to identify TMEM175-expressing organelles to use for patch clamping. Overexpressing hTMEM175 led to large K+ currents in both endosomes (438.5 ± 133.5 pA/pF at +100 mV; n = 13; Figures 4A–4F) and lysosomes (374.3 ± 96.8 pA/pF, n = 6; Figures 4G–4I). Like the native IKEL, TMEM175 currents (ITMEM175) rose and fell instantaneously upon voltage changes without rectification (Figures 4E and 4H). Unlike KVs, TMEM175 did not inactivate even when tested with pulses of 10 s duration (Figure S3A).Figure S3Properties of TMEM175, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) Current traces elicited by voltage pulses of 10 s duration from an hTMEM175 expressing lysosome demonstrating that TMEM175 does not inactivate.

Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Removing K+ from the bath containing Cl− abolished the current, indicating that hTMEM175 is not permeable to anions (Figure 5A). The current increased when K+ was replaced with Rb+, suggesting that, like many canonical K+ channels, hTMEM175 is Rb+ permeable (Figure 5A). To determine hTMEM175’s cation selectivity, we recorded ITMEM175 under various ionic conditions. Replacing bath K+ with NMDG, Na+, or Ca2+ largely abolished the outward currents (moving into lysosomes) (Figures 5A–5C), suggesting that hTMEM175 is minimally permeable to NMDG, Na+ and Ca2+. We recorded IhTMEM175 under bi-ionic conditions and used the resulting reversal potentials to quantify hTMEM175’s relative permeability (Figures 5D and 5E). hTMEM175 was selective for K+ over Na+ and Ca2+ (PK/PNa = 36.0 ± 4.4, n = 11; PK/PCa = 141.6 ± 27.7, n = 9), with a PK/PNa within the range of those of KV and K2P channels (Heginbotham et al., 1994Heginbotham L.

We tested whether K+ conduction through hTMEM175 required a co-movement of H+, a property of H+ cotransporter/exchangers. Under conditions where there was no H+ gradient (pHlumen = pHcytosol = 7.2) and K+ was the only other permeable cation, the reversal potential follows the changes in [K+]cyt with a slope of 56.8 mV/decade (Figure 5F), close to that of a pure K+ electrode (58.8 mV/decade at 23°C), suggesting that H+ co-movement is not required (Accardi and Miller, 2004Accardi A. Miller C. Secondary active transport mediated by a prokaryotic homologue of ClC Cl- channels.Nature. 2004; 427: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). The highest sequence similarity among TMEM175s is found in IS1 and IIS1. These two regions contain an FSD signature conserved in TMEM175s of eukaryotes (Figure S2A), bacteria, and archaea. TMEM175 with the FSD signature mutated generated proteins comparable to that of the wild-type (WT; as judged by the intensity of the attached YFP protein, data not shown). However, the mutants exhibited no active channel activity (Figures S3B and S3C). ITMEM175 was not inhibited by Cs+, Ba2+, tetraethylammonium, or quinine at concentrations commonly used to block canonical K+ channels but was sensitive to Zn2+ (IC50, 38.4 μM) and 4-aminopyridine (4-AP; IC50, 35.0 μM) (Figures S3D–S3G). The lack of voltage dependence and the distinct pharmacological properties suggest that ITMEM175 was not the result of a potential upregulation of canonical K+ channel proteins caused by overexpressing TMEM175. The predicted 2 × 6TM structure of hTMEM175 is similar to that of the TPC channels but deviates from those of most other ion channels whose structures are 2TMs, 6TMs, or 4 × 6TM. To test whether proteins with only one of the two repeats can form ion channels, we expressed the bacterial TMEM175 homologs (bacTMEM175s) from gram-positive (Chryseobacterium; Genbank: KFF73457; cbTMEM175) and gram-negative (Streptomyces collinus, Genbank: AGS72644; scTMEM175) bacteria in HEK293T cells. The prokaryotic TMEM175s are small (192 aa in cbTMEM175 and 206 aa in scTMEM175) and are predicted to have only one 6TM repeat (Figure 6A). Bacterial and human TMEM175s are conserved, especially in the first two TMs (cbTMEM175 versus hTMEM175 repeat II: 39% identity, 56% similarity; Figures S4A–S4D). As a reference, the mammalian protein with the highest similarity to the bacterial Na+ channel NaChBac is the 4 × 6TM T-type Ca2+ channel CaV3.1. The identity and similarity between CaV3.1 and NaChBac are 27% and 51%, respectively.Figure S4Bacterial TMEM175 Homologs, Related to Figure 6Show full caption(A–E) Partial sequences of cbTMEM175 (from gram-positive bacterium Chryseobacterium; full-length, 192 aa) and scTMEM175 (from gram-negative bacterium Streptomyces collinus; full-length, 206 aa) are aligned against repeats I and II of hTMEM175 (A-D) and against each other (E).

Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Unlike most other bacterial ion channel proteins, bacTMEM175s were readily expressed in mammalian cells. HEK293T transfected with bacTMEM175s had large K+ currents when recorded under symmetric [K+] conditions (Figures 6, S4F, and S4G). Thus, prokaryotes use TMEM175 homologs, instead of K2Ps, to form K+-permeable leak-like channels. As bacteria and archaea have no intracellular organelles, the function of TMEM175 is perhaps to set the membrane potentials of the cells and/or to regulate cellular osmolarity. The sequence similarity between the two bacTMEM175s (35% identity, 59% similarity) is only as large as the similarity between each and hTMEM175 (Figure S4). The two, however, generated currents with similar properties. Like hTMEM175, bacTMEM175s also had linear current (I)-voltage (V) relationships and the currents did not inactivate (Figures 6D, 6E, and S4F). Compared to hTMEM175, bacTMEM175s were less permeable to Cs (PK/PCs: 2.1 ± 0.7, n = 4 for cbTMEM175; 2.3 ± 0.3, n = 5 for scTMEM175) and were noticeably permeable to Na+ (PK/PNa: 2.4 ± 0.5, n = 4 for cbTMEM175; 4.4 ± 1.4, n = 5 for scTMEM175). Unlike hTMEM175, bacTMEM175s were not inhibited by 4-AP when applied either in the bath or in the pipette solutions (Figures"

Previous study reported the specific-species phytotoxicity of CeO2 NPs by lettuce (Lactuca sativa), but their physiological impacts and vivo biotransformation are not yet well understood, especially in relative realistic environment. Butterhead lettuce were germinated and grown in potting soil for 30 days cultivation with treatments of 0, 50, 100, 1000 mg CeO2 NPs per kg soil. Results showed that lettuce in 100 mg·kg-1 treated groups grew significantly faster than others, but significantly increased nitrate content. The lower concentrations treatment had no impact on plant growth, compared with the control. However, the higher concentration treatment significantly deterred plant growth and biomass production. The stress response of lettuce plants, such as Superoxide dismutase (SOD), Peroxidase (POD), Malondialdehyde(MDA) activity was disrupted by 1000 mg·kg-1 CeO2 NPs treatment. In addition, the presence of Ce (III) in the roots of butterhead lettuce explained the reason of CeO2 NPs phytotoxicity. These findings demonstrate CeO2 NPs modification of nutritional quality, antioxidant defense system, the possible transfer into the food chain and biotransformation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1922466910,"The etiopathogenesis of sporadic Parkinson’s disease (PD) remains elusive although mitochondrial dysfunction has long been implicated. Recent evidence revealed reduced expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator−1 α (PGC−1α) and downstream regulated nuclear encoded respiratory complex genes in affected brain tissue from PD patients. We sought to determine whether epigenetic modification of the PGC−1α gene could account for diminished expression. In substantia nigra from PD patients but not control subjects, we show significant promoter-proximal non-canonical cytosine methylation of the PGC−1α gene but not an adjacent gene. As neuroinflammation is a prominent feature of PD and a mediator of epigenetic change, we evaluated whether the pro-inflammatory fatty acid, palmitate, would stimulate PGC−1α promoter methylation in different cell types from the CNS. Indeed, in mouse primary cortical neurons, microglia and astrocytes, palmitate causes PGC−1α gene promoter non-canonical cytosine methylation, reduced expression of the gene and reduced mitochondrial content. Moreover, intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of palmitate to transgenic human α−synuclein mutant mice resulted in increased PGC−1α promoter methylation, decreased PGC−1α expression and reduced mitochondrial content in substantia nigra. Finally we provide evidence that dysregulation of ER stress and inflammatory signaling is associated with PGC−1α promoter methylation. Together, these data strengthen the connection between saturated fatty acids, neuroflammation, ER stress, epigenetic alteration and bioenergetic compromise in PD."

Our data provide mechanistic insight into how an NPC-associated adaptor complex accesses the core transcription machinery. Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are both gateways for molecular transport and attachment sites for chromosomes. Genome-wide studies in yeast, flies, and humans have shown that nuclear pore proteins (nucleoporins) interact with numerous active genes, but also with heterochromatin boundaries and repressed genes (Ibarra and Hetzer, 2015Ibarra A. Hetzer M.W. Nuclear pore proteins and the control of genome functions.Genes Dev. 2015; 29: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). At present, the physical and functional connection between nucleoporins and the transcription machinery is poorly understood. A relay between nucleoporins and transcription could operate through an intermediate layer of adaptor proteins. Known candidates are the chromatin modifier SAGA (Köhler et al., 2008Köhler A.

Earlier work reported dynamic, potentially indirect, interactions with promoter-bound co-activators like SAGA (Rodríguez-Navarro et al., 2004Rodríguez-Navarro S. Fischer T. Luo M.J. Antúnez O.

Yeast TREX-2 consists of Sac3, Thp1, Sem1, Sus1, and Cdc31 and can be divided into a PCI domain part (a protein scaffold also found in the proteasome lid, CSN, and eIF3 complexes) and an NPC-anchor element (Figure 1A). A recent study revealed the structure of the PCI domains of Sac3 and Thp1 and the Sem1 protein (Ellisdon et al., 2012Ellisdon A.M. Dimitrova L. Hurt E. Stewart M. Structural basis for the assembly and nucleic acid binding of the TREX-2 transcription-export complex.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This study also showed that TREX-2 binds to different nucleic acids in vitro and concluded that it may interact with RNA and/or DNA in vivo. However, the biological relevance of these interactions and their potential impact on transcription remained unclear. No specific interactions with any protein of the transcription machinery have been identified for the TREX-2 PCI domains. Transcription initiation at eukaryotic protein-coding genes requires RNA Pol II, general transcription factors, and Mediator. Assembly of these factors on promoter DNA results in a core initiation complex, which recruits TFIIH to unwind DNA and phosphorylate the Pol II C-terminal domain (CTD). Mediator is recruited by transcription activators, stabilizes the initiation complex and stimulates TFIIH kinase activity (Poss et al., 2013Poss Z.C. Ebmeier C.C. Taatjes D.J. The Mediator complex and transcription regulation.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2013; 48: 575-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). RNA synthesis leads to release of the general factors and formation of an elongation complex, which produces an mRNA nucleoprotein particle (mRNP) with a 5′ cap, 3′ poly(A)-tail and protein coat of various export factors. In the present work, we identify Mediator as a direct TREX-2 target and unravel a relay mechanism by which Mediator establishes the communication between TREX-2 and Pol II. We hypothesized that the ability of TREX-2 to regulate both transcription and mRNA export is encoded in its PCI portion that represents the evolutionary most conserved part of the complex. Among PCI proteins two different types can be discerned: the TREX-2 subunit Thp1 contains a “typical” PCI, whereas Sac3 contains a less common “atypical” PCI, which features an additional N-terminal extension (Pick et al., 2009Pick E. Hofmann K. Glickman M.H. PCI complexes: Beyond the proteasome, CSN, and eIF3 Troika.Mol. Cell. 2009; 35: 260-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignments of Sac3 revealed a conserved region (Sac3 aa 200–300), which corresponds to the atypical PCI extension (Figure S1A). Despite being highly conserved, this region was not functionally characterized in a recent study reporting the crystal structure of the yeast Sac3(253–551)/Thp1/Sem1 complex (PDB: 3t5v) (Ellisdon et al., 2012Ellisdon A.M. Dimitrova L. Hurt E. Stewart M. Structural basis for the assembly and nucleic acid binding of the TREX-2 transcription-export complex.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To address the function of the most conserved region of Sac3 we determined the crystal structure of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae TREX-2 sub-complex containing an N-terminally extended variant of Sac3 (Sac3(222–572)/Thp1(170–455)/Sem1) at 3.1 Å resolution revealing an overall organization that was highly similar to the reported structure (root-mean-square deviation [rmsd] values: Sac3 0.8 Å, Thp1 1.4 Å, and Sem1 2.8 Å for 299, 450, and 56 equivalent Ca atoms, respectively) (Figure 1B). Despite their conservation, Sac3 residues 222–252 were not defined by electron density, most likely because this segment is inherently flexible. Strikingly, mapping the sequence conservation onto the TREX-2 PCI structure highlighted a distinct surface patch in the atypical part of the Sac3 PCI domain as the largest conserved region of the entire Sac3/Thp1/Sem1 complex (Figure 1C). This region includes Sac3 helices α1, α2, and α4 and consists of two clusters of positively charged residues centered around R256 and R288 (Figure 1D). To analyze the function of this region, we phenotypically characterized the impact of point mutations in residues that are identical between yeast and human (Figures 1E and S1A). Interestingly, both sac3 R256D and R288D mutations, exhibited pronounced growth defects with the R288D mutation being more severely affected on galactose-containing medium, a condition that requires highly inducible transcription of the NPC-targeted GAL1 gene (Figure 1E). The respective alanine substitutions resulted in weaker phenotypes, while other mutations (e.g., D351R) showed no readily detectable growth defects. The observed phenotypes do not result from Sac3 protein instability, as the mutant proteins assembled into stable complexes with the other TREX-2 subunits (Figures S1B and S1C) and localized to NPCs in vivo (Figure S1D). Sac3 residues K467 and K468, located in the remote winged helix subdomain, were reported to be crucial for nucleotide binding and mRNA export (Ellisdon et al., 2012Ellisdon A.M. Dimitrova L. Hurt E. Stewart M. Structural basis for the assembly and nucleic acid binding of the TREX-2 transcription-export complex.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, upon mutation (sac3 K467D/K468D) we detected comparatively minor growth phenotypes under the conditions of our assay, consistent with these residues being poorly conserved (Figures S1A and S2A ). Thus, our analysis assigns a critical function to the N-terminal region of the atypical Sac3 PCI domain.Figure S2Structural, Biochemical, and Genetic Characterization of TREX-2, Mediator, and Pol II, Related to Figures 1 and 2Show full caption(A) Top view of the yeast Sac3(222-572)/Thp1(170-455)/Sem1 complex in ribbon representation, showing the electrostatic surface potential and the surface conservation of the trimeric complex (left to right).

To address the role of the Sac3 PCI domain in transcription, we reasoned that it might influence the formation of the preinitiation complex, a multi-protein assembly at gene promoters, which includes RNA Pol II, the general transcription factors and Mediator. As potential TREX-2 interactors, we considered factors with a known capacity to respond to external signals. In yeast and metazoa, Mediator is the key “processor,” which binds transcription factors, facilitates preinitiation complex assembly, recruits Pol II, and releases it into elongation (Flanagan et al., 1991Flanagan P.M.

The Mediator complex and transcription regulation.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2013; 48: 575-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Affinity-purification of the TAP-tagged Mediator subunit Med7 (part of the middle module) showed a characteristic Mediator subunit profile in wild-type cells (Figure 2A). Intriguingly, in sac3Δ cells, Mediator lost its Cdk8 kinase subunit as assessed by mass spectrometry and immunoblotting (Med13 and Med12 were also affected but to a lesser extent). The stoichiometry of other Mediator proteins was not markedly altered. Cdk8 levels were unchanged in sac3Δ cells (Figure 2A) and loss of Cdk8 was also seen when using TAP-tagged Med15 (tail) as bait for purification (Figure S2C). Together, these data suggest that TREX-2 affects the association of Mediator with its Cdk8 kinase module. Mediator function is linked to multi-site phosphorylation of the Pol II C-terminal domain (CTD), a repetitive heptapeptide array (YSPTSPS27) in the Rpb1 subunit. The CTD is thought to be largely unphosphorylated during preinitiation complex assembly (Robinson et al., 2012Robinson P.J. Bushnell D.A. Trnka M.J. Burlingame A.L. Kornberg R.D. Structure of the mediator head module bound to the carboxy-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 17931-17935Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Upon phosphorylation of Ser5 residues, Pol II escapes from the promoter and starts mRNA synthesis (Liu et al., 2004Liu Y. Kung C. Fishburn J. Ansari A.Z. Shokat K.M. Hahn S.

Chem. 2007; 282: 14113-14120Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To test whether TREX-2 has a regulatory influence on Pol II, we isolated Mediator and determined the total amount and phospho-status of the interacting Pol II (Figure 2B). We observed substantially less Pol II co-purifying with Mediator in sac3Δ cells when probing with an antibody against the CTD of Rpb1 (mAb clone 8WG16). Remarkably, this fraction of Pol II exhibited strongly increased Ser5 phosphorylation (Ser5-P) levels in sac3Δ cells when assayed with a site-specific antibody (mAb clone 4H8). The TREX-2-dependent increase in Pol II Ser5 phosphorylation was also detected in total cell extracts. On the other hand, Ser2 phosphorylation, a CTD mark that accumulates at the 3′ region of a gene, remained largely unchanged. These results were confirmed by directly purifying Pol II from wild-type and sac3Δ cells (Figure S2D). Taken together, our data indicate that TREX-2 is important for maintaining normal cellular levels of RNA Pol II Ser5-P and further suggest that the strongly increased Ser5 CTD phosphorylation may partially disrupt the interaction with Mediator as reported earlier (Søgaard and Svejstrup, 2007Søgaard T.M. Svejstrup J.Q. Hyperphosphorylation of the C-terminal repeat domain of RNA polymerase II facilitates dissociation of its complex with mediator.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 14113-14120Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Given that TREX-2 affects both Ser5 phosphorylation of Pol II and Cdk8 integration into Mediator, we explored the impact of the Cdk8 kinase module on Ser5 phosphorylation in vivo. Kin28 (human CDK7), a subunit of the general transcription factor TFIIH, is regarded as the main Ser5 CTD kinase. Human CDK8 was reported to inhibit CDK7 by phosphorylation (Akoulitchev et al., 2000Akoulitchev S. Chuikov S. Reinberg D. TFIIH is negatively regulated by cdk8-containing mediator complexes.Nature. 2000; 407: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), raising the possibility of a similar cross-talk in yeast. We isolated the Mediator complex from cells carrying deletions of CDK8, MED12, and MED13 (see cartoon in Figure 2C). These deletions disrupted the Cdk8 kinase module (CKM) to different degrees as med13Δ led to the dissociation of the entire module from Mediator, med12Δ dissociated mainly Cdk8 (CycC was not determined) and cdk8Δ lacked the kinase (Figure S2E). We found similar, although less pronounced, effects as in sac3Δ cells: the amount of Pol II co-purifying with Mediator was reduced, while CTD Ser5 phosphorylation of the residually interacting Pol II was increased (Figure 2C). To substantiate the functional link between TREX-2 and Cdk8 in vivo we employed yeast genetics. Deletion of CDK8 alone confers a growth defect but is not lethal, implying genetic buffering by other factors. Interestingly, the combination with a SAC3 deletion caused synthetic lethality (Figure 2D) and this relates to the SAC3 R288 residue within the PCI domain and the catalytic activity of CDK8 as shown by a point mutation in the enzyme’s active site (Figure 2E). These genetic links are specific to the conserved N-terminal region of the Sac3 PCI domain because a K467D/K468D double mutant located in the Sac3 winged helix domain did not exhibit a synthetic growth defect with cdk8Δ (Figure 2D). Taken together, our biochemical and genetic data demonstrate a functional synergy between Cdk8 and TREX-2 in vivo and are consistent with their joint regulatory effect on Pol II Ser5 phosphorylation. To find out whether the influence of TREX-2 on Mediator is direct, Mediator was purified from cells expressing N-terminally myc-tagged versions of Sac3 (Figure 3A). Indeed, the TREX-2 core subunit Sac3 could be readily detected in Mediator purifications. Notably, mutation of either Sac3 R256 or R288 resulted in significantly lower amounts of TREX-2 associated with Mediator. This effect was particularly pronounced when the charge of the side-chain was inverted (i.e., R256D and R288D). The sac3 R288D mutant, which displayed the weakest affinity toward Mediator partially recapitulated the deletion of the entire SAC3 gene with respect to Cdk8 disassembly, Pol II dissociation, and increased Ser5 phosphorylation levels. To investigate whether TREX-2 binds Mediator through the CKM, we tested whether deletions of kinase module subunits would impair TREX-2 binding. However, TREX-2 co-purified efficiently with Mediator even when the module was disrupted (Figure 3B). Thus, TREX-2 regulates association of the CKM with Mediator, yet, without using the CKM as a docking site. The CKM interacts with core Mediator primarily through the middle and “head” module (see Figure 2C) (Tsai et al., 2013Tsai K.L. Sato S. Tomomori-Sato C. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Asturias F.J. A conserved Mediator-CDK8 kinase module association regulates Mediator-RNA polymerase II interaction.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). We considered that the TREX-2 PCI domain might interact with Mediator in vicinity of the CKM and initially focused on the elongated Mediator middle module, which extends from Med19 at the tip downward to the Med1 subunit (Figure 3C) (Tsai et al., 2014Tsai K.L. Tomomori-Sato C. Sato S. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Asturias F.J. Subunit architecture and functional modular rearrangements of the transcriptional mediator complex.Cell. 2014; 157: 1430-1444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). As Med4, Med7, Med10, and Med21 deletions are lethal and Med19 deletion destabilizes Mediator (data not shown), we analyzed the co-purification of myc-tagged Sac3 in Mediator purifications deleted for Med1, Med9, and Med31. Notably, TREX-2 association with Mediator was impaired specifically upon loss of the Med31 subunit (Figure 3D). Med31 is one of the most conserved Mediator subunits and required for activated transcription (Koschubs et al., 2009Koschubs T. Seizl M. Larivière L. Kurth F. Baumli S. Martin D.E. Cramer P. Identification, structure, and functional requirement of the Mediator submodule Med7N/31.EMBO J. 2009; 28: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It interacts with the Med7 N terminus and forms a distinct protrusion on the middle module as seen by cryo-EM (Figure 3C) (Plaschka et al., 2015Plaschka C. Larivière L. Wenzeck L. Seizl M. Hemann M.

https://openalex.org/W1922885767,"Recent technological innovations have led to the development of miniature, accelerometer-containing electronic loggers which can be attached to free-living animals. Accelerometers provide information on both body posture and dynamism which can be used as descriptors to define behaviour. We deployed tri-axial accelerometer loggers on 12 free-ranging Eurasian beavers Castor fiber in the county of Telemark, Norway, and on four captive beavers (two Eurasian beavers and two North American beavers C. canadensis) to corroborate acceleration signals with observed behaviours. By using random forests for classifying behavioural patterns of beavers from accelerometry data, we were able to distinguish seven behaviours; standing, walking, swimming, feeding, grooming, diving and sleeping. We show how to apply the use of acceleration to determine behaviour, and emphasise the ease with which this non-invasive method can be implemented. Furthermore, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of this, and the implementation of accelerometry on animals, illustrating limitations, suggestions and solutions. Ultimately, this approach may also serve as a template facilitating studies on other animals with similar locomotor modes and deliver new insights into hitherto unknown aspects of behavioural ecology."
https://openalex.org/W2116105136,"In response to cellular genome breaks, MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 (MRN) activates a global ATM DNA damage response (DDR) that prevents cellular replication. Here, we show that MRN-ATM also has critical functions in defending the cell against DNA viruses. We reveal temporally distinct responses to adenovirus genomes: a critical MRN-ATM DDR that must be inactivated by E1B-55K/E4-ORF3 viral oncoproteins and a global MRN-independent ATM DDR to viral nuclear domains that does not impact viral replication. We show that MRN binds to adenovirus genomes and activates a localized ATM response that specifically prevents viral DNA replication. In contrast to chromosomal breaks, ATM activation is not amplified by H2AX across megabases of chromatin to induce global signaling and replicative arrest. Thus, γH2AX foci discriminate “self” and “non-self” genomes and determine whether a localized anti-viral or global ATM response is appropriate. This provides an elegant mechanism to neutralize viral genomes without jeopardizing cellular viability."
https://openalex.org/W1939804949,"Background Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major global health problem with cigarette smoke (CS) as the main risk factor for its development. Airway inflammation in COPD involves the increased expression of inflammatory mediators such as CXCL-8 and IL-1β which are important mediators for neutrophil recruitment. Macrophages are an important source of these mediators in COPD. Lactobacillus rhamnosus (L. rhamnosus) and Befidobacterium breve (B. breve) attenuate the development of ‘allergic asthma’ in animals but their effects in COPD are unknown. Objective To determine the anti-inflammatory effects of L. rhamnosus and B. breve on CS and Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation. Design We stimulated the human macrophage cell line THP-1 with CS extract in the presence and absence of L. rhamnosus and B. breve and measured the expression and release of inflammatory mediators by RT-qPCR and ELISA respectively. An activity assay and Western blotting were used to examine NF-κB activation. Results Both L. rhamnosus and B. breve were efficiently phagocytized by human macrophages. L. rhamnosus and B. breve significantly suppressed the ability of CS to induce the expression of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-23, TNFα, CXCL-8 and HMGB1 release (all p<0.05) in human THP-1 macrophages. Similar suppression of TLR4- and TLR9-induced CXCL8 expression was also observed (p<0.05). The effect of L. rhamnosus and B. breve on inflammatory mediator release was associated with the suppression of CS-induced NF-κB activation (p<0.05). Conclusions This data indicate that these probiotics may be useful anti-inflammatory agents in CS-associated disease such as COPD."
https://openalex.org/W1945441522,"Introduction Studies have shown that depression or anxiety occur in 10–20% of pregnant women. These disorders are often undertreated and may affect mothers and children’s health. This study investigates the relation between antenatal maternal depression, anxiety and children’s early cognitive development among 1380 two-year-old children and 1227 three-year-old children. Methods In the French EDEN Mother-Child Cohort Study, language ability was assessed with the Communicative Development Inventory at 2 years of age and overall development with the Ages and Stages Questionnaire at 3 years of age. Multiple regressions and structural equation modeling were used to examine links between depression, anxiety during pregnancy and child cognitive development. Results We found strong significant associations between maternal antenatal anxiety and poorer children’s cognitive development at 2 and 3 years. Antenatal maternal depression was not associated with child development, except when antenatal maternal anxiety was also present. Both postnatal maternal depression and parental stimulation appeared to play mediating roles in the relation between antenatal maternal anxiety and children’s cognitive development. At 3 years, parental stimulation mediated 13.2% of the effect of antenatal maternal anxiety while postnatal maternal depression mediated 26.5%. Discussion The partial nature of these effects suggests that other mediators may play a role. Implications for theory and research on child development are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1621375610,"Background Despite widespread implementation across Africa, there is limited evidence of the effect of payment for performance (P4P) schemes in low income countries on the coverage of quality services and affordability, consistent with universal health coverage objectives. We examined the effect of a government P4P scheme on utilisation, quality, and user costs of health services in Tanzania. Methods We evaluated the effects of a P4P scheme on utilisation of all maternal and child immunization services targeted by the scheme, and non-targeted general outpatient service use. We also evaluated effects on patient satisfaction with care and clinical content of antenatal care, and user costs. The evaluation was done in 150 facilities across all 7 intervention districts and 4 comparison districts with two rounds of data collection over 13-months in January 2012 and February 2013. We sampled 3000 households of women who had delivered in the 12 months prior to interview; 1500 patients attending health facilities for targeted and non-targeted services at each round of data collection. Difference-in-difference regression analysis was employed. Findings We estimated a significant positive effect on two out of eight targeted indicators. There was an 8.2% (95% CI: 3.6% to 12.8%) increase in coverage of institutional deliveries among women in the intervention area, and a 10.3% (95% CI: 4.4% to 16.1%) increase in the provision of anti-malarials during pregnancy. Use of non-targeted services reduced at dispensaries by 57.5 visits per month among children under five (95% CI: -110.2 to -4.9) and by 90.8 visits per month for those aged over five (95% CI: -156.5 to -25.2). There was no evidence of an effect of P4P on patient experience of care for targeted services. There was a 0.05 (95% CI: 0.01 to 0.10) increase in the patient satisfaction score for non-targeted services. P4P was associated with a 5.0% reduction in those paying out of pocket for deliveries (95% CI: -9.3% to -0.7%) but there was no evidence of an effect on the average amount paid. Conclusion This study adds to the very limited evidence on the effects of P4P at scale and highlights the potential risks of such schemes in relation to non-targeted service use. Further consideration of the design of P4P schemes is required to enhance progress towards universal health coverage, and close monitoring of effects on non-targeted services and user costs should be encouraged."
https://openalex.org/W1933182380,"NAC [no apical meristem (NAM), Arabidopsis transcription activation factor [ATAF1/2] and cup-shaped cotyledon (CUC2)] proteins is one of the largest groups of plant specific transcription factors and plays a crucial role in plant growth, development, and adaption to the environment. Currently, no information is known about the NAC family in cassava. In this study, 96 NAC genes (MeNACs) were identified from the cassava genome. Phylogenetic analysis of the NACs from cassava and Arabidopsis showed that MeNAC proteins can be clustered into 16 subgroups. Gene structure analysis found that the number of introns of MeNAC genes varied from 0 to 5, with the majority of MeNAC genes containing two introns, indicating a small gene structure diversity of cassava NAC genes. Conserved motif analysis revealed that all of the identified MeNACs had the conserved NAC domain and/or NAM domain. Global expression analysis suggested that MeNAC genes exhibited different expression profiles in different tissues between wild subspecies and cultivated varieties, indicating their involvement in the functional diversity of different accessions. Transcriptome analysis demonstrated that MeNACs had a widely transcriptional response to drought stress and that they had differential expression profiles in different accessions, implying their contribution to drought stress resistance in cassava. Finally, the expression of twelve MeNAC genes was analyzed under osmotic, salt, cold, ABA, and H2O2 treatments, indicating that cassava NACs may represent convergence points of different signaling pathways. Taken together, this work found some excellent tissue-specific and abiotic stress-responsive candidate MeNAC genes, which would provide a solid foundation for functional investigation of the NAC family, crop improvement and improved understanding of signal transduction in plants. These data bring new insight on the complexity of the transcriptional control of MeNAC genes and support the hypothesis that NACs play an important role in plant growth, development, and adaption of environment."
https://openalex.org/W1915698791,"Axonal branching contributes substantially to neuronal circuit complexity. Studies in Drosophila have shown that loss of Dscam1 receptor diversity can fully block axon branching in mechanosensory neurons. Here we report that cell-autonomous loss of the receptor tyrosine phosphatase 69D (RPTP69D) and loss of midline-localized Slit inhibit formation of specific axon collaterals through modulation of Dscam1 activity. Genetic and biochemical data support a model in which direct binding of Slit to Dscam1 enhances the interaction of Dscam1 with RPTP69D, stimulating Dscam1 dephosphorylation. Single-growth-cone imaging reveals that Slit/RPTP69D are not required for general branch initiation but instead promote the extension of specific axon collaterals. Hence, although regulation of intrinsic Dscam1-Dscam1 isoform interactions is essential for formation of all mechanosensory-axon branches, the local ligand-induced alterations of Dscam1 phosphorylation in distinct growth-cone compartments enable the spatial specificity of axon collateral formation."

Demographic information and data on KAP were obtained using a self-administered standardized questionnaire. The percentage KAP scores were categorised as good and poor. Independent predictors of good knowledge of EVD were ascertained using a binary logistic regression model.Out of 1035 study participants with median age of 32 years, 648 (62.6%) were males, 846 (81.7%) had tertiary education and 441 (42.6%) were HCW. There were 218, 239 and 578 respondents from Bayelsa, Cross River and Kano states respectively. The overall median percentage KAP scores and interquartile ranges (IQR) were 79.46% (15.07%), 95.0% (33.33%) and 49.95% (37.50%) respectively. Out of the 1035 respondents, 470 (45.4%), 544(52.56%) and 252 (24.35%) had good KAP of EVD defined using 80%, 90% and 70% score cut-offs respectively. Independent predictors of good knowledge of EVD were being a HCW (Odds Ratio-OR-2.89, 95% Confidence interval-CI of 1.41-5.90), reporting 'moderate to high fear of EVD' (OR-2.15, 95% CI-(1.47-3.13) and 'willingness to modify habit' (OR-1.68, 95% CI-1.23-2.30).Our results reveal suboptimal EVD-related knowledge, attitude and practice among adults in Nigeria.

Methods This study recruited 79 normal glucose tolerance (NGT) subjects and 76 newly diagnosed T2DM patients. NGT and T2DM groups were divided into normal weight (NW) and obese (OB)subgroups respectively. Anthropometric parameters such as height, weight, waist circumference, hip circumference and blood pressure were measured. Plasma concentrations of HMGB1, IL-6, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2 hours post challenge plasma glucose (2hPG), serum lipid, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) and fasting insulin (FINS) were examined. The homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) was performed to assess IR status. Results Plasma HMGB1 levels were higher in T2DM group than that in NGT group. The concentrations of serum HMGB1 were also higher in subjects with OB than those in subjects with NW both in NGT and T2DM groups. Plasma levels of HMGB1 were positively correlated with waist hip ratio (WHR), blood pressure, FPG, FINS, HOMA-IR, TG, IL-6 and negatively correlated with HOMA-βand high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-c) independent of age, gender and BMI. Plasma levels of HMGB1 were significantly correlated with diabetes in fully adjusted models. Conclusion Plasma HMGB1 levels were increased in Chinese subjects with pure T2DM, which might be caused by IR. Serum HMGB1 participated in the pathological process of obesity and T2DM via its proinflammatory effect."
https://openalex.org/W2141596440,"In two experimental studies, we investigated mechanisms hypothesized to underpin two pervasive and interrelated phenomena: that certain forms of group movement and exercise lead to social bonding and that social bonding can lead to enhanced exercise performance. In Study 1, we manipulated synchrony and exercise intensity among rowers and found that, compared with low intensity exercise, moderate intensity exercise led to significantly higher levels of cooperation in an economic game; no effect of synchrony vs. non-synchrony was found. In Study 2, we investigated the effects of bonding on performance, using synchrony as a cue of existing supportive social bonds among participants. An elite, highly bonded team of rugby players participated in solo, synchronized, and non-synchronized warm-up sessions; participants' anaerobic performance significantly improved after the brief synchronous warm-up relative to the non-synchronous warm-up. The findings substantiate claims concerning the reciprocal links between group exercise and social bonding, and may help to explain the ubiquity of collective physical activity across cultural domains as varied as play, ritual, sport, and dance."
https://openalex.org/W2210593549,"Studies that assess the distribution of benefits provided by ecosystem services across urban areas are increasingly common. Nevertheless, current knowledge of both the supply and demand sides of ecosystem services remains limited, leaving a gap in our understanding of balance between ecosystem service supply and demand that restricts our ability to assess and manage these services. The present study seeks to fill this gap by developing and applying an integrated approach to quantifying the supply and demand of a key ecosystem service, carbon storage and sequestration, at the local level. This approach follows three basic steps: (1) quantifying and mapping service supply based upon Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) processing and allometric models, (2) quantifying and mapping demand for carbon sequestration using an indicator based on local anthropogenic CO2 emissions, and (3) mapping a supply-to-demand ratio. We illustrate this approach using a portion of the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area of Minnesota, USA. Our results indicate that 1735.69 million kg carbon are stored by urban trees in our study area. Annually, 33.43 million kg carbon are sequestered by trees, whereas 3087.60 million kg carbon are emitted by human sources. Thus, carbon sequestration service provided by urban trees in the study location play a minor role in combating climate change, offsetting approximately 1% of local anthropogenic carbon emissions per year, although avoided emissions via storage in trees are substantial. Our supply-to-demand ratio map provides insight into the balance between carbon sequestration supply in urban trees and demand for such sequestration at the local level, pinpointing critical locations where higher levels of supply and demand exist. Such a ratio map could help planners and policy makers to assess and manage the supply of and demand for carbon sequestration."
https://openalex.org/W1929157952,"Iron and zinc are important micronutrients for both the growth and nutrient availability of crop plants, and their absorption is tightly controlled by a metal uptake system. Zinc-regulated transporters, iron-regulated transporter-like proteins (ZIP), is considered an essential metal transporter for the acquisition of Fe and Zn in graminaceous plants. Several ZIPs have been identified in maize, although their physiological function remains unclear. In this report, ZmIRT1 was shown to be specifically expressed in silk and embryo, whereas ZmZIP3 was a leaf-specific gene. Both ZmIRT1 and ZmZIP3 were shown to be localized to the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum. In addition, transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing ZmIRT1 or ZmZIP3 were generated, and the metal contents in various tissues of transgenic and wild-type plants were examined based on ICP-OES and Zinpyr-1 staining. The Fe and Zn concentration increased in roots and seeds of ZmIRT1-overexpressing plants, while the Fe content in shoots decreased. Overexpressing ZmZIP3 enhanced Zn accumulation in the roots of transgenic plants, while that in shoots was repressed. In addition, the transgenic plants showed altered tolerance to various Fe and Zn conditions compared with wild-type plants. Furthermore, the genes associated with metal uptake were stimulated in ZmIRT1 transgenic plants, while those involved in intra- and inter- cellular translocation were suppressed. In conclusion, ZmIRT1 and ZmZIP3 are functional metal transporters with different ion selectivities. Ectopic overexpression of ZmIRT1 may stimulate endogenous Fe uptake mechanisms, which may facilitate metal uptake and homeostasis. Our results increase our understanding of the functions of ZIP family transporters in maize."

Genetic diversity in key factors of this pathway may influence protein function and signal transduction, contributing to disease initiation and progression. Studies suggest that MTOR rs1064261 and AKT rs1130233 polymorphisms are associated with risk and/or prognosis of multiple cancer types. However, this relationship with gastric cancer (GC) remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of MTOR and AKT polymorphisms in the risk and prognosis of GC. Methods The Sequenom MassARRAY platform was used to genotype 1842 individuals for MTOR rs1064261 T→C and AKT rs1130233 G→A polymorphisms. ELISA was used to detect Helicobacter pylori antibodies in serum. Immunohistochemical analysis was used to detect total and phosphorylated MTOR and AKT proteins. Results The MTOR rs1064261 (TC+CC) genotype and the AKT rs1130233 (GA+AA) genotype were associated with increased risk of GC in men (P = 0.049, P = 0.030). In H. pylori-negative individuals, the AKT rs1130233 GA and (GA+AA) genotypes were related to increased risk of atrophic gastritis (AG; P = 0.012, P = 0.024). Notably, the AKT rs1130233 (GA+AA) genotype demonstrated significant interactions with H. pylori in disease progression from healthy controls (CON) to AG (P = 0.013) and from AG to GC (P = 0.049). Additionally, for individuals with the AKT rs1130233 variant, those in the H. pylori-positive group had higher levels of phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) expression. The AKT rs1130233 genotype was found to be associated with clinicopathological parameters including lymph node metastasis and alcohol drinking (P<0.05). Conclusion MTOR rs1064261and AKT rs1130233 polymorphisms were associated with increased GC risk in males and increased AG risk in H. pylori-negative individuals.

https://openalex.org/W1694025149,"Background Most breast cancers depend on estrogenic growth stimulation. Functional genetic screenings in in vitro cell models have identified genes, which override growth suppression induced by anti-estrogenic drugs like tamoxifen. Using that approach, we have previously identified Breast Cancer Anti-Estrogen Resistance 4 (BCAR4) as a mediator of cell proliferation and tamoxifen-resistance. Here, we show high level of expression and function of BCAR4 in human breast cancer. Methods BCAR4 mRNA expression was evaluated by (q)RT-PCR in a panel of human normal tissues, primary breast cancers and cell lines. A new antibody raised against C78-I97 of the putative BCAR4 protein and used for western blot and immunoprecipitation assays. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated gene silencing was implemented to study the function of BCAR4 and its downstream targets ERBB2/3. Results Except for placenta, all human normal tissues tested were BCAR4-negative. In primary breast cancers, BCAR4 expression was comparatively rare (10%), but associated with enhanced proliferation. Relative high BCAR4 mRNA expression was identified in IPH-926, a cell line derived from an endocrine-resistant lobular breast cancer. Moderate BCAR4 expression was evident in MDA-MB-134 and MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells. BCAR4 protein was detected in breast cancer cells with ectopic (ZR-75-1-BCAR4) and endogenous (IPH-926, MDA-MB-453) BCAR4 mRNA expression. Knockdown of BCAR4 inhibited cell proliferation. A similar effect was observed upon knockdown of ERBB2/3 and exposure to lapatinib, implying that BCAR4 acts in an ERBB2/3-dependent manner. Conclusion BCAR4 encodes a functional protein, which drives proliferation of endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells. Lapatinib, a clinically approved EGFR/ERBB2 inhibitor, counteracts BCAR4-driven tumor cell growth, a clinical relevant observation."
https://openalex.org/W1916468062,"The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), which is the main composition factor of eIF4F translation initiation complex, influences the growth of tumor through modulating cap-dependent protein translation. Previous studies reported that ribavirin could suppress eIF4E-controlled translation and reduce the synthesis of onco-proteins. Here, we investigated the anti-leukemic effects of ribavirin alone or in combination with tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib in Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) leukemia cell lines SUP-B15 (Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, Ph+ ALL) and K562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line, CML). Our results showed that ribavirin had anti-proliferation effect; it down-regulated the phosphorylation levels of Akt, mTOR, 4EBP1, and eIF4E proteins in the mTOR/eIF4E signaling pathway, and MEK, ERK, Mnk1 and eIF4E proteins in ERK/Mnk1/eIF4E signaling pathway; reduced the expression of Mcl-1 (a translation substrates of eIF4F translation initiation complex) at protein synthesis level not mRNA transcriptional level; and induced cell apoptosis in both SUP-B15 and K562. 7-Methyl-guanosine cap affinity assay further demonstrated that ribavirin remarkably increased the eIF4E binding to 4EBP1 and decreased the combination of eIF4E with eIF4G, consequently resulting in a major inhibition of eIF4F complex assembly. The combination of ribavirin with imatinib enhanced antileukemic effects mentioned above, indicating that two drugs have synergistic anti-leukemic effect. Consistent with the cell lines, similar results were observed in Ph+ acute lymphoblastic primary leukemic blasts; however, the anti-proliferative role of ribavirin in other types of acute primary leukemic blasts was not obvious, which indicated that the anti-leukemic effect of ribavirin was different in cell lineages."
https://openalex.org/W1952191404,"We assessed the impact of species composition and stand structure on the spatial variation of forest carbon density using data collected from a 4-ha plot in a subtropical forest in southern China. We found that 1) forest biomass carbon density significantly differed among communities, reflecting a significant effect of community structure and species composition on carbon accumulation; 2) soil organic carbon density increased whereas stand biomass carbon density decreased across communities, indicating that different mechanisms might account for the accumulation of stand biomass carbon and soil organic carbon in the subtropical forest; and 3) a small number of tree individuals of the medium- and large-diameter class contributed predominantly to biomass carbon accumulation in the community, whereas a large number of seedlings and saplings were responsible for a small proportion of the total forest carbon stock. These findings demonstrate that both biomass carbon and soil carbon density in the subtropical forest are sensitive to species composition and community structure, and that heterogeneity in species composition and stand structure should be taken into account to ensure accurate forest carbon accounting."
https://openalex.org/W1945210652,"Cells migrate by extending pseudopods such as lamellipodia and blebs. Although the signals leading to lamellipodia extension have been extensively investigated, those for bleb extension remain unclear. Here, we investigated signals for blebbing in Dictyostelium cells using a newly developed assay to induce blebbing. When cells were cut into two pieces with a microneedle, the anucleate fragments vigorously extended blebs. This assay enabled us to induce blebbing reproducibly, and analyses of knockout mutants and specific inhibitors identified candidate molecules that regulate blebbing. Blebs were also induced in anucleate fragments of leukocytes, indicating that this assay is generally applicable to animal cells. After cutting, microtubules in the anucleate fragments promptly depolymerized, followed by the extension of blebs. Furthermore, when intact cells were treated with a microtubule inhibitor, they frequently extended blebs. The depolymerization of microtubules induced the delocalization of inositol lipid phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate from the cell membrane. PI3 kinase-null cells frequently extended blebs, whereas PTEN-null cells extended fewer blebs. From these observations, we propose a model in which microtubules play a critical role in bleb regulation via inositol lipid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2322456067,"The cochlea performs frequency analysis and amplification of sounds. The graded stiffness of the basilar membrane along the cochlear length underlies the frequency-location relationship of the mammalian cochlea. The somatic motility of outer hair cell is central for cochlear amplification. Despite two to three orders of magnitude change in the basilar membrane stiffness, the force capacity of the outer hair cell’s somatic motility, is nearly invariant over the cochlear length. It is puzzling how actuators with a constant force capacity can operate under such a wide stiffness range. We hypothesize that the organ of Corti sets the mechanical conditions so that the outer hair cell’s somatic motility effectively interacts with the media of traveling waves—the basilar membrane and the tectorial membrane. To test this hypothesis, a computational model of the gerbil cochlea was developed that incorporates organ of Corti structural mechanics, cochlear fluid dynamics, and hair cell electro-physiology. The model simulations showed that the micro-mechanical responses of the organ of Corti are different along the cochlear length. For example, the top surface of the organ of Corti vibrated more than the bottom surface at the basal (high frequency) location, but the amplitude ratio was reversed at the apical (low frequency) location. Unlike the basilar membrane stiffness varying by a factor of 1700 along the cochlear length, the stiffness of the organ of Corti complex felt by the outer hair cell remained between 1.5 and 0.4 times the outer hair cell stiffness. The Y-shaped structure in the organ of Corti formed by outer hair cell, Deiters cell and its phalange was the primary determinant of the elastic reactance imposed on the outer hair cells. The stiffness and geometry of the Deiters cell and its phalange affected cochlear amplification differently depending on the location."

Evidence is lacking regarding effective primary care based interventions to tackle this problem. Aim To identify current procedures for, barriers to, and facilitators of the delivery of primary care based interventions for lowering cardiovascular risk for people with severe mental illnesses. Method 75 GPs, practice nurses, service users, community mental health staff and carers in UK GP practice or community mental health settings were interviewed in 14 focus groups which were audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed using Framework Analysis. Results Five barriers to delivering primary care based interventions for lowering cardiovascular risk in people with severe mental illnesses were identified by the groups: negative perceptions of people with severe mental illnesses amongst some health professionals, difficulties accessing GP and community-based services, difficulties in managing a healthy lifestyle, not attending appointments, and a lack of awareness of increased cardiovascular risk in people with severe mental illnesses by some health professionals. Identified facilitators included involving supportive others, improving patient engagement with services, continuity of care, providing positive feedback in consultations and goal setting. Conclusion We identified a range of factors which can be incorporated in to the design, delivery and evaluation of services to reduce cardiovascular risk for people with severe mental illnesses in primary care. The next step is determining the clinical and cost effectiveness of primary care based interventions for lowering cardiovascular risk in people with severe mental illnesses, and evaluating the most important components of such interventions."
https://openalex.org/W1932237885,"The maintenance of glucose homeostasis within the body is crucial for constant and precise performance of energy balance and is sustained by a number of peripheral organs. Estrogens are known to play a role in the maintenance of glucose homeostasis. Aromatase knockout (ArKO) mice are estrogen-deficient and display symptoms of dysregulated glucose metabolism. We aim to investigate the effects of estrogen ablation and exogenous estrogen administration on glucose homeostasis regulation. Six month-old female wildtype, ArKO, and 17β-estradiol (E2) treated ArKO mice were subjected to whole body tolerance tests, serum examination of estrogen, glucose and insulin, ex-vivo muscle glucose uptake, and insulin signaling pathway analyses. Female ArKO mice display increased body weight, gonadal (omental) adiposity, hyperinsulinemia, and liver triglycerides, which were ameliorated upon estrogen treatment. Tolerance tests revealed that estrogen-deficient ArKO mice were pyruvate intolerant hence reflecting dysregulated hepatic gluconeogenesis. Analyses of skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose tissues supported a hepatic-based glucose dysregulation, with a down-regulation of Akt phosphorylation (a key insulin signaling pathway molecule) in the ArKO liver, which was improved with E2 treatment. Concurrently, estrogen treatment lowered ArKO serum leptin and adiponectin levels and increased inflammatory adipokines such as tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and interleukin 6 (IL6). Furthermore, estrogen deficiency resulted in the infiltration of CD45 macrophages into gonadal adipose tissues, which cannot be reversed by E2 treatment. This study describes the effects of estrogens on glucose homeostasis in female ArKO mice and highlights a primary phenotype of hepatic glucose dysregulation and a parallel estrogen modified adipokine profile."
https://openalex.org/W1893389145,"Hair-derived keratin biomaterials composed mostly of reduced keratin proteins (kerateines) have demonstrated their utility as carriers of biologics and drugs for tissue engineering. Electrostatic forces between negatively-charged keratins and biologic macromolecules allow for effective drug retention; attraction to positively-charged growth factors like bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) has been used as a strategy for osteoinduction. In this study, the intermolecular surface and bulk interaction properties of kerateines were investigated. Thiol-rich kerateines were chemisorbed onto gold substrates to form an irreversible 2-nm rigid layer for surface plasmon resonance analysis. Kerateine-to-kerateine cohesion was observed in pH-neutral water with an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 1.8 × 10−4 M, indicating that non-coulombic attractive forces (i.e. hydrophobic and van der Waals) were at work. The association of BMP-2 to kerateine was found to be greater (KD = 1.1 × 10−7 M), within the range of specific binding. Addition of salts (phosphate-buffered saline; PBS) shortened the Debye length or the electrostatic field influence which weakened the kerateine-BMP-2 binding (KD = 3.2 × 10−5 M). BMP-2 in bulk kerateine gels provided a limited release in PBS (~ 10% dissociation in 4 weeks), suggesting that electrostatic intermolecular attraction was significant to retain BMP-2 within the keratin matrix. Complete dissociation between kerateine and BMP-2 occurred when the PBS pH was lowered (to 4.5), below the keratin isoelectric point of 5.3. This phenomenon can be attributed to the protonation of keratin at a lower pH, leading to positive-positive repulsion. Therefore, the dynamics of kerateine-BMP-2 binding is highly dependent on pH and salt concentration, as well as on BMP-2 solubility at different pH and molarity. The study findings may contribute to our understanding of the release kinetics of drugs from keratin biomaterials and allow for the development of better, more clinically relevant BMP-2-conjugated systems for bone repair and regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W1910655007,"PII proteins constitute a superfamily of highly conserved signaling devices, common in all domains of life. Through binding of the metabolites ATP, ADP and 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG), they undergo conformational changes which allow them to regulate a variety of target proteins including enzymes, transport proteins and transcription factors. But, in reverse, these target proteins also modulate the metabolite sensing properties of PII, as has been recently shown. We used this effect to refine our PII based Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensor and amplify its sensitivity towards ADP. With this enhanced sensor setup we addressed the question whether the PII protein from the model organism Synechococcus elongatus autonomously switches into the ADP conformation through ATPase activity as proposed in a recently published model. The present study disproves ATPase activity as a relevant mechanism for the transition of PII into the ADP state. In the absence of 2-OG, only the ATP/ADP ratio and concentration of ADP directs the competitive interaction of PII with two targets, one of which preferentially binds PII in the ATP-state, the other in the ADP-state."

However, the effects of preoperative CHO or ORS on postoperative quality of recovery after anesthesia remain unclear. Consequently, the purpose of the current study was to evaluate the effect of preoperative CHO or ORS on patient recovery, using the Quality of Recovery 40 questionnaire (QoR-40).This prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial included American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status 1 and 2 adult patients, who were scheduled to undergo a surgical procedure of body surface. Subjects were randomized to one of the three groups: 1) preoperative CHO group, 2) preoperative ORS group, and 3) control group. The primary outcome was the global QoR-40 administered 24 h after surgery. Intraoperative use of vasopressor, intraoperative body temperature changes, and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) were also evaluated.We studied 134 subjects. The median [interquartile range (IQR)] global QoR-40 scores 24 h after the surgery were 187 [177-197], 186 [171-200], and 184 [171-198] for the CHO, ORS, and control groups, respectively (p = 0.916). No significant differences existed between the groups regarding intraoperative vasopressor use during the surgery (p = 0.475).Results of the current study indicated that the preoperative administration of either CHO or ORS did not improve the quality of recovery in patients undergoing minimally invasive body surface surgery.www.umin.ac.jp UMIN000009388 https://upload.umin.ac.jp/cgi-open-bin/ctr/ctr.cgi?function=brows&action=brows&type=summary&recptno=R000011029&language=E."
https://openalex.org/W2170804575,"Ionizing radiation has different biological effects according to dose and dose rate. In particular, the biological effect of low-dose radiation is unclear. Low-dose whole-body gamma irradiation activates immune responses in several ways. However, the effects and mechanism of low-dose radiation on allergic responses remain poorly understood. Previously, we reported that low-dose ionizing radiation inhibits mediator release in IgE-mediated RBL-2H3 mast cell activation. In this study, to have any physiological relevance, we investigated whether low-dose radiation inhibits allergic responses in activated human mast cells (HMC-1(5C6) and LAD2 cells), mouse models of passive cutaneous anaphylaxis and the late-phase cutaneous response. High-dose radiation induced cell death, but low-dose ionizing radiation of <0.5 Gy did not induce mast cell death. Low-dose ionizing radiation that did not induce cell death significantly suppressed mediator release from human mast cells (HMC-1(5C6) and LAD2 cells) that were activated by antigen-antibody reaction. To determine the inhibitory mechanism of mediator released by low-dose ionizing radiation, we examined the phosphorylation of intracellular signaling molecules such as Lyn, Syk, phospholipase Cγ, and protein kinase C, as well as the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). The phosphorylation of signaling molecules and [Ca2+]i following stimulation of FcεRI receptors was inhibited by low dose ionizing radiation. In agreement with its in vitro effect, ionizing radiation also significantly inhibited inflammatory cells infiltration, cytokine mRNA expression (TNF-α, IL-4, IL-13), and symptoms of passive cutaneous anaphylaxis reaction and the late-phase cutaneous response in anti-dinitrophenyl IgE-sensitized mice. These results indicate that ionizing radiation inhibits both mast cell-mediated immediate- and delayed-type allergic reactions in vivo and in vitro."

However, the effects of cyclonic eddies on particle export are not well understood. Here, biogenic silica (BSi) and particulate organic carbon (POC) exports were examined inside and outside a decaying cyclonic eddy using 234Th-238U disequilibria in the tropical South China Sea. For the eddy and outside stations, the average concentrations of BSi in the euphotic zone were 0.17±0.09 μmol L-1 (mean±sd, n = 20) and 0.21±0.06 μmol L-1 (n = 34). The POC concentrations were 1.42±0.56 μmol L-1 (n = 34) and 1.30±0.46 μmol L-1 (n = 51). Both BSi and POC abundances did not show change at the 95% confidence level. Based on the 234Th-238U model, BSi export fluxes in the eddy averaged 0.18±0.15 mmol Si m-2 d-1, which was comparable with the 0.40±0.20 mmol Si m-2 d-1 outside the eddy. Similarly, the average POC export fluxes were 1.5±1.4 mmol C m-2 d-1 and 1.9±1.3 mmol C m-2 d-1 for the eddy and outside stations. From these results we concluded that cyclonic eddies in their decaying phase have little effect on the abundance and export of biogenic particles."

We performed a retrospective longitudinal study to evaluate the factor associated with bone mass changes at the lumbar spine in healthy Korean pre- and perimenopausal women over the age of 40. We examined the relation of blood tests including thyroid function tests at baseline and follow-up to the annual percentage changes in average BMD of L2-L4 (A%ΔLSBMD). Four hundred and forty-three subjects without diseases or medications pertaining to bone metabolism were analyzed. The mean A%ΔLSBMD in these subjects was -0.45%/year. Though a significant correlation was observed between the A%ΔLSBMD and age, serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level, total cholesterol (TC) level, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at baseline and follow-up, there was a weak correlation between A%ΔLSBMD and these variables. From multiple linear regression analyses, the percent body fat, age, serum TSH level, serum uric acid level, and the menopause at follow-up were showed to have a significant association with the A%ΔLSBMD. Unlike age, percent body fat, and menopause at follow-up, which had a negative association with the A%ΔLSBMD, serum TSH level and serum uric acid level, had a positive association with the A%ΔLSBMD. The results from our study showed that the notable risk factors of BMD loss at the lumbar spine in population of our study were advancing age, menopause, higher percent body fat, lower normal TSH, and lower serum uric acid levels."
https://openalex.org/W1954558184,"Astrocytic gliomas, which are derived from glial cells, are considered the most common primary neoplasias of the central nervous system (CNS) and are histologically classified as low grade (I and II) or high grade (III and IV). Recent studies have shown that astrocytoma formation is the result of the deregulation of several pathways, including the RB/E2F pathway, which is commonly deregulated in various human cancers via genetic or epigenetic mechanisms. On the basis of the assumption that the study of the mechanisms controlling the INK4/ARF locus can help elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of astrocytic tumors, identify diagnostic and prognostic markers, and help select appropriate clinical treatments, the present study aimed to evaluate and compare methylation patterns using bisulfite sequencing PCR and evaluate the gene expression profile using real-time PCR in the genes CDKN2A, CDKN2B, CDC6, Bmi-1, CCND1, and RB1 in astrocytic tumors. Our results indicate that all the evaluated genes are not methylated independent of the tumor grade. However, the real-time PCR results indicate that these genes undergo progressive deregulation as a function of the tumor grade. In addition, the genes CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and RB1 were underexpressed, whereas CDC6, Bmi-1, and CCND1 were overexpressed; the increase in gene expression was significantly associated with decreased patient survival. Therefore, we propose that the evaluation of the expression levels of the genes involved in the RB/E2F pathway can be used in the monitoring of patients with astrocytomas in clinical practice and for the prognostic indication of disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W1962272759,"Purpose Side effects related to radiation exposures are based primarily on the assumption that the detrimental effects of radiation occur in directly irradiated cells. However, several studies have reported over the years of radiation-induced non-targeted/ abscopal effects in vivo that challenge this paradigm. There is evidence that Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) plays an important role in modulating non-targeted effects, including DNA damages in vitro and mutagenesis in vivo. While most reports on radiation-induced non-targeted response utilize x-rays, there is little information available for heavy ions. Methods and Materials Adult female transgenic gpt delta mice were exposed to an equitoxic dose of either carbon or argon particles using the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC) at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS) in Japan. The mice were stratified into 4 groups of 5 animals each: Control; animals irradiated under full shielding (Sham-irradiated); animals receiving whole body irradiation (WBIR); and animals receiving partial body irradiation (PBIR) to the lower abdomen with a 1 x 1 cm2 field. The doses used in the carbon ion group (4.5 Gy) and in argon particle group (1.5 Gy) have a relative biological effectiveness equivalent to a 5 Gy dose of x-rays. 24 hours after irradiation, breast tissues in and out of the irradiated field were harvested for analysis. Induction of COX2, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), phosphorylated histone H2AX (γ-H2AX), and apoptosis-related cysteine protease-3 (Caspase-3) antibodies were examined in the four categories of breast tissues using immunohistochemical techniques. Analysis was performed by measuring the intensity of more than 20 individual microscopic fields and comparing the relative fold difference. Results In the carbon ion group, the relative fold increase in COX2 expression was 1.01 in sham-irradiated group (p > 0.05), 3.07 in PBIR (p < 0.05) and 2.50 in WBIR (p < 0.05), respectively, when compared with controls. The relative fold increase in 8-OHdG expression was 1.29 in sham-irradiated (p > 0.05), 11.31 in PBIR (p < 0.05) and 11.79 in WBIR (p < 0.05), respectively, when compared with controls. A similar increase in γ-H2AX expression was found in that, compared to controls, the increase was 1.41 fold in sham-irradiated (p > 0.05), 8.41 in PBIR (p < 0.05) and 10.59 in WBIR (p < 0.05). Results for the argon particle therapy group showed a similar magnitude of changes in the various biological endpoints examined. There was no statistical significance observed in Caspase-3 expression among the 4 groups. Conclusions Our data show that both carbon and argon ions induced non-targeted, out of field induction of COX2 and DNA damages in breast tissues. These effects may pose new challenges to evaluate the risks associated with radiation exposure and understanding radiation-induced side effects."
https://openalex.org/W2107296006,"The complex mechanistic array underlying the pathogenesis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is still unclear. Although dysregulations of different signaling pathways involved in MDS have been described, the identification of specific biomarkers and therapy targets remains an important task in order to establish novel therapeutic approaches. Here, we demonstrated that the Shh signaling pathway is active in MDS and correlated it with disease progression. Additionally, the knockdown of Gli1 significantly inhibited cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Gli1 silencing also induced apoptosis and G0/G1 phase arrest. Furthermore, Gli1 silencing enhanced the demethylating effect of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine on the p15 gene promoter and subsequently promoted its expression by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase 1(DNMT1). Our findings show that the Shh signaling pathway plays a role in the pathogenesis and disease progression of MDS, and proceeds by modulating DNA methylation. This pathway may prove to be a potential therapeutic target for enhancing the therapeutic effects of 5-azacytidine on malignant transformation of MDS."
https://openalex.org/W2166159223,"Obesity-induced inflammation in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is a major contributor to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Whereas innate immune cells, notably macrophages, contribute to visceral adipose tissue (VAT) inflammation and insulin resistance, the role of adaptive immunity is less well defined. To address this critical gap, we used a model in which endogenous activation of T cells was suppressed in obese mice by blocking MyD88-mediated maturation of CD11c+ antigen-presenting cells. VAT CD11c+ cells from Cd11cCre+Myd88fl/fl vs. control Myd88fl/fl mice were defective in activating T cells in vitro, and VAT T and B cell activation was markedly reduced in Cd11cCre+Myd88fl/fl obese mice. However, neither macrophage-mediated VAT inflammation nor systemic inflammation were altered in Cd11cCre+Myd88fl/fl mice, thereby enabling a focused analysis on adaptive immunity. Unexpectedly, fasting blood glucose, plasma insulin, and the glucose response to glucose and insulin were completely unaltered in Cd11cCre+Myd88fl/fl vs. control obese mice. Thus, CD11c+ cells activate VAT T and B cells in obese mice, but suppression of this process does not have a discernible effect on macrophage-mediated VAT inflammation or systemic glucose homeostasis."

Data available on prasugrel reloading in clopidogrel treated patients with high residual platelet reactivity (HRPR) i.e. poor responders, is limited. Objectives To determine the effects of prasugrel loading on platelet function in patients on clopidogrel and high platelet reactivity undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Patients Patients with ACS on clopidogrel who were scheduled for PCI found to have a platelet reactivity ≥40 AUC with the Multiplate Analyzer, i.e. “poor responders” were randomised to prasugrel (60 mg loading and 10 mg maintenance dose) or clopidogrel (600 mg reloading and 150 mg maintenance dose). The primary outcome measure was proportion of patients with platelet reactivity <40 AUC 4 hours after loading with study medication, and also at one hour (secondary outcome). 44 patients were enrolled and the study was terminated early as clopidogrel use decreased sharply due to introduction of newer P2Y12 inhibitors. Results At 4 hours after study medication 100% of patients treated with prasugrel compared to 91% of those treated with clopidogrel had platelet reactivity <40 AUC (p = 0.49), while at 1 hour the proportions were 95% and 64% respectively (p = 0.02). Mean platelet reactivity at 4 and 1 hours after study medication in prasugrel and clopidogrel groups respectively were 12 versus 22 (p = 0.005) and 19 versus 34 (p = 0.01) respectively. Conclusions Routine platelet function testing identifies patients with high residual platelet reactivity (“poor responders”) on clopidogrel. A strategy of prasugrel rather than clopidogrel reloading results in earlier and more sustained suppression of platelet reactivity. Future trials need to identify if this translates into clinical benefit. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01339026"
https://openalex.org/W1935324714,"Mitochondrial genome sequences have been widely used for evolutionary and phylogenetic studies. Among vertebrates, fish are an important, diverse group, and their mitogenome sequences are growing rapidly in public repositories. To facilitate mitochondrial genome analysis and to explore the valuable genetic information, we developed the Fish Mitogenome Resource (FMiR) database to provide a workbench for mitogenome annotation, species identification and microsatellite marker mining. The microsatellites are also known as simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and used as molecular markers in studies on population genetics, gene duplication and marker assisted selection. Here, easy-to-use tools have been implemented for mining SSRs and for designing primers to identify species/habitat specific markers. In addition, FMiR can analyze complete or partial mitochondrial genome sequence to identify species and to deduce relational distances among sequences across species. The database presently contains curated mitochondrial genomes from 1302 fish species belonging to 297 families and 47 orders reported from saltwater and freshwater ecosystems. In addition, the database covers information on fish species such as conservation status, ecosystem, family, distribution and occurrence downloaded from the FishBase and IUCN Red List databases. Those fish information have been used to browse mitogenome information for the species belonging to a particular category.

https://openalex.org/W2298101614,"Background The TATE trial was a multicentre pragmatic randomized controlled trial of supplementing primary care management (PCM)–consisting of a GP consultation followed by information and advice on exercises–with transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), to reduce pain intensity in patients with tennis elbow. This paper reports the health economic evaluation. Methods and Findings Adults with new diagnosis of tennis elbow were recruited from 38 general practices in the UK, and randomly allocated to PCM (n = 120) or PCM plus TENS (n = 121). Outcomes included reduction in pain intensity and quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs) based on the EQ5D and SF6D. Two economic perspectives were evaluated: (i) healthcare–inclusive of NHS and private health costs for the tennis elbow; (ii) societal–healthcare costs plus productivity losses through work absenteeism. Mean outcome and cost differences between the groups were evaluated using a multiple imputed dataset as the base case evaluation, with uncertainty represented in cost-effectiveness planes and through probabilistic cost-effectiveness acceptability curves). Incremental healthcare cost was £33 (95%CI -40, 106) and societal cost £65 (95%CI -307, 176) for PCM plus TENS. Mean differences in outcome were: 0.11 (95%CI -0.13, 0.35) for change in pain (0–10 pain scale); -0.015 (95%CI -0.058, 0.029) for QALYEQ5D; 0.007 (95%CI -0.022, 0.035) for QALYSF6D (higher score differences denote greater benefit for PCM plus TENS). The ICER (incremental cost effectiveness ratio) for the main evaluation of mean difference in societal cost (£) relative to mean difference in pain outcome was -582 (95%CI -8666, 8113). However, incremental ICERs show differences in cost–effectiveness of additional TENS, according to the outcome being evaluated. Conclusion Our findings do not provide evidence for or against the cost-effectiveness of TENS as an adjunct to primary care management of tennis elbow."

Using a multilevel perspective, we examined the relationships between individual (affective balance) and group (team prosocial efficacy and team trust) level variables and prosocial behavior towards team members. The participants were 123 students nested in 45 small teams. A series of multilevel random models was estimated using hierarchical linear and nonlinear modeling. Individuals were more likely to behave prosocially towards in-group members when they were feeling good. Furthermore, the relationship between positive affective balance and prosocial behavior was stronger in teams with higher team prosocial efficacy levels as well as in teams with higher team trust levels. Finally, the relevance of team trust had a stronger influence on behavior than team prosocial efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2148646962,"There is an urgent need for effective prophylactic measures against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, particularly given the highly variable efficacy of Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG), the only licensed vaccine against tuberculosis (TB). Most studies indicate that cell-mediated immune responses involving both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are necessary for effective immunity against Mtb. Genetic vaccination induces humoral and cellular immune responses, including CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses, against a variety of bacterial, viral, parasitic and tumor antigens, and this strategy may therefore hold promise for the development of more effective TB vaccines. Novel formulations and delivery strategies to improve the immunogenicity of DNA-based vaccines have recently been evaluated, and have shown varying degrees of success. In the present study, we evaluated DNA-launched Venezuelan equine encephalitis replicons (Vrep) encoding a novel fusion of the mycobacterial antigens α-crystallin (Acr) and antigen 85B (Ag85B), termed Vrep-Acr/Ag85B, for their immunogenicity and protective efficacy in a murine model of pulmonary TB. Vrep-Acr/Ag85B generated antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses that persisted for at least 10 wk post-immunization. Interestingly, parenterally administered Vrep-Acr/Ag85B also induced T cell responses in the lung tissues, the primary site of infection, and inhibited bacterial growth in both the lungs and spleens following aerosol challenge with Mtb. DNA-launched Vrep may, therefore, represent an effective approach to the development of gene-based vaccines against TB, particularly as components of heterologous prime-boost strategies or as BCG boosters."
https://openalex.org/W1678899250,"Myelin basic proteins (MBP) are major constituents of the myelin sheath in the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). In the CNS Mbp translation occurs locally at the axon-glial contact site in a neuronal activity-dependent manner. Recently we identified the small non-coding RNA 715 (sncRNA715) as a key inhibitor of Mbp translation during transport in oligodendrocytes. Mbp mRNA localization in Schwann cells has been observed, but has not been investigated in much detail. Here we could confirm translational repression of Mbp mRNA in Schwann cells. We show that sncRNA715 is expressed and its levels correlate inversely with MBP in cultured Schwann cells and in the sciatic nerve in vivo. Furthermore we could reduce MBP protein levels in cultured Schwann cells by increasing the levels of the inhibitory sncRNA715. Our findings suggest similarities in sncRNA715-mediated translational repression of Mbp mRNA in oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells."
https://openalex.org/W1944921299,"Proprioceptive signals coming from both arms are used to determine the perceived position of one arm in a two-arm matching task. Here, we examined whether the perceived position of one arm is affected by proprioceptive signals from the other arm in a one-arm pointing task in which participants specified the perceived position of an unseen reference arm with an indicator paddle. Both arms were hidden from the participant’s view throughout the study. In Experiment 1, with both arms placed in front of the body, the participants received 70–80 Hz vibration to the elbow flexors of the reference arm (= right arm) to induce the illusion of elbow extension. This extension illusion was compared with that when the left arm elbow flexors were vibrated or not. The degree of the vibration-induced extension illusion of the right arm was reduced in the presence of left arm vibration. In Experiment 2, we found that this kinesthetic interaction between the two arms did not occur when the left arm was vibrated in an abducted position. In Experiment 3, the vibration-induced extension illusion of one arm was fully developed when this arm was placed at an abducted position, indicating that the brain receives increased proprioceptive input from a vibrated arm even if the arm was abducted. Our results suggest that proprioceptive interaction between the two arms occurs in a one-arm pointing task when the two arms are aligned with one another. The position sense of one arm measured using a pointer appears to include the influences of incoming information from the other arm when both arms were placed in front of the body and parallel to one another."
https://openalex.org/W1951025965,"Conformational properties of the angiotensin II precursor, angiotensin I (AngI) and analogues containing the paramagnetic amino acid TOAC (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl-4-amino-4-carboxylic acid) at positions 0, 1, 3, 5, 8, 9, and 10, were examined by EPR, CD, and fluorescence. The conformational data were correlated to their activity in muscle contraction experiments and to their properties as substrates of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE). Biological activity studies indicated that TOAC0-AngI and TOAC1-AngI maintained partial potency in guinea pig ileum and rat uterus. Kinetic parameters revealed that only derivatives labeled closer to the N-terminus (positions 0, 1, 3, and 5) were hydrolyzed by ACE, indicating that peptides bearing the TOAC moiety far from the ACE cleavage site (Phe8-His9 peptide bond) were susceptible to hydrolysis, albeit less effectively than the parent compound. CD spectra indicated that AngI exhibited a flexible structure resulting from equilibrium between different conformers. While the conformation of N-terminally-labeled derivatives was similar to that of the native peptide, a greater propensity to acquire folded structures was observed for internally-labeled, as well as C-terminally labeled, analogues. These structures were stabilized in secondary structure-inducing agent, TFE. Different analogues gave rise to different β-turns. EPR spectra in aqueous solution also distinguished between N-terminally, internally-, and C-terminally labeled peptides, yielding narrower lines, indicative of greater mobility for the former. Interestingly, the spectra of peptides labeled at, or close, to the C-terminus, showed that the motion in this part of the peptides was intermediate between that of N-terminally and internally-labeled peptides, in agreement with the suggestion of turn formation provided by the CD spectra. Quenching of the Tyr4 fluorescence by the differently positioned TOAC residues corroborated the data obtained by the other spectroscopic techniques. Lastly, we demonstrated the feasibility of monitoring the progress of ACE-catalyzed hydrolysis of TOAC-labeled peptides by following time-dependent changes in their EPR spectra."
https://openalex.org/W2260637391,"Background Colorectal cancer (CRC) and atrial fibrillation/flutter (AF) share several risk factors including increasing age and obesity. However, the association between CRC and AF has not been thoroughly examined, especially in African Americans. In this study we aimed to assess the prevalence of AF and its risk factors in colorectal neoplasia in an African American. Methods We reviewed records of 527 African American patients diagnosed with CRC and 1008 patients diagnosed with benign colonic lesions at Howard University Hospital from January 2000 to December 2012. A control group of 731 hospitalized patients without any cancer or colonic lesion were randomly selected from the same time and age range, excluding patients who had diagnosis of both CRC and/or adenoma. The presence or absence of AF was based upon ICD-9 code documentation. The prevalence of AF in these three groups was compared by multivariate logistic regression. Results The prevalence of AF was highest among CRC patients (10%) followed by adenoma patients (7.2%) then the control group (5.4%, P for trend = 0.002). In the three groups of participants, older age (P<0.008) and heart failure (P<0.001) were significantly associated with higher risk of AF. After adjusting for these risk factors, CRC (OR: 1.4(95%CI):0.9–2.2, P = 0.2) and adenoma (OR: 1.1(95%CI):0.7–1.6, P = 0.7) were not significantly associated AF compared to control group. Conclusions AF is highly prevalent among CRC patients; 1 in 10 patients had AF in our study. The predictors of AF in CRC was similar to that in adenoma and other patients after adjustment for potential confounders suggesting that the increased AF risk in CRC is explained by higher prevalence of AF risk factors."
