https://openalex.org/W1971464867,"Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation is regulated in part by tissue stiffness, yet MSCs can often encounter stiffness gradients within tissues caused by pathological, e.g., myocardial infarction ∼8.7±1.5 kPa/mm, or normal tissue variation, e.g., myocardium ∼0.6±0.9 kPa/mm; since migration predominantly occurs through physiological rather than pathological gradients, it is not clear whether MSC differentiate or migrate first. MSCs cultured up to 21 days on a hydrogel containing a physiological gradient of 1.0±0.1 kPa/mm undergo directed migration, or durotaxis, up stiffness gradients rather than remain stationary. Temporal assessment of morphology and differentiation markers indicates that MSCs migrate to stiffer matrix and then differentiate into a more contractile myogenic phenotype. In those cells migrating from soft to stiff regions however, phenotype is not completely determined by the stiff hydrogel as some cells retain expression of a neural marker. These data may indicate that stiffness variation, not just stiffness alone, can be an important regulator of MSC behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2043446856,"Neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1) is a stereoselective mediator derived from the omega-3 essential fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) with potent inflammatory resolving and neuroprotective bioactivity. NPD1 reduces Aβ42 peptide release from aging human brain cells and is severely depleted in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. Here we further characterize the mechanism of NPD1's neurogenic actions using 3xTg-AD mouse models and human neuronal-glial (HNG) cells in primary culture, either challenged with Aβ42 oligomeric peptide, or transfected with beta amyloid precursor protein (βAPP)sw (Swedish double mutation APP695sw, K595N-M596L). We also show that NPD1 downregulates Aβ42-triggered expression of the pro-inflammatory enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and of B-94 (a TNF-α-inducible pro-inflammatory element) and apoptosis in HNG cells. Moreover, NPD1 suppresses Aβ42 peptide shedding by down-regulating β-secretase-1 (BACE1) while activating the α-secretase ADAM10 and up-regulating sAPPα, thus shifting the cleavage of βAPP holoenzyme from an amyloidogenic into the non-amyloidogenic pathway. Use of the thiazolidinedione peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonist rosiglitazone, the irreversible PPARγ antagonist GW9662, and overexpressing PPARγ suggests that the NPD1-mediated down-regulation of BACE1 and Aβ42 peptide release is PPARγ-dependent. In conclusion, NPD1 bioactivity potently down regulates inflammatory signaling, amyloidogenic APP cleavage and apoptosis, underscoring the potential of this lipid mediator to rescue human brain cells in early stages of neurodegenerations."
https://openalex.org/W2037580188,"Ocean acidification is a well recognised threat to marine ecosystems. High latitude regions are predicted to be particularly affected due to cold waters and naturally low carbonate saturation levels. This is of concern for organisms utilising calcium carbonate (CaCO3) to generate shells or skeletons. Studies of potential effects of future levels of pCO2 on high latitude calcifiers are at present limited, and there is little understanding of their potential to acclimate to these changes. We describe a laboratory experiment to compare physiological and metabolic responses of a key benthic bivalve, Laternula elliptica, at pCO2 levels of their natural environment (430 µatm, pH 7.99; based on field measurements) with those predicted for 2100 (735 µatm, pH 7.78) and glacial levels (187 µatm, pH 8.32). Adult L. elliptica basal metabolism (oxygen consumption rates) and heat shock protein HSP70 gene expression levels increased in response both to lowering and elevation of pH. Expression of chitin synthase (CHS), a key enzyme involved in synthesis of bivalve shells, was significantly up-regulated in individuals at pH 7.78, indicating L. elliptica were working harder to calcify in seawater undersaturated in aragonite (ΩAr = 0.71), the CaCO3 polymorph of which their shells are comprised. The different response variables were influenced by pH in differing ways, highlighting the importance of assessing a variety of factors to determine the likely impact of pH change. In combination, the results indicate a negative effect of ocean acidification on whole-organism functioning of L. elliptica over relatively short terms (weeks-months) that may be energetically difficult to maintain over longer time periods. Importantly, however, the observed changes in L. elliptica CHS gene expression provides evidence for biological control over the shell formation process, which may enable some degree of adaptation or acclimation to future ocean acidification scenarios."
https://openalex.org/W2086351869,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is caused by inadequate anti-viral immunity. Activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) leading to IFNα production is important for effective anti-viral immunity. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection lacks IFNα induction in animal models and patients and chronic HBV patients display impaired IFNα production by pDC. Therefore, HBV and HBV-derived proteins were examined for their effect on human pDC in vitro. In addition, the in vitro findings were compared to the function of pDC derived from chronic HBV patients ex vivo. In contrast to other viruses, HBV did not activate pDC. Moreover, HBV and HBsAg abrogated CpG-A/TLR9-induced, but not Loxoribine/TLR7-induced, mTOR-mediated S6 phosphorylation, subsequent IRF7 phosphorylation and IFNα gene transcription. HBV/HBsAg also diminished upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules, production of TNFα, IP-10 and IL-6 and pDC-induced NK cell function, whereas TLR7-induced pDC function was hardly affected. In line, HBsAg preferentially bound to TLR9-triggered pDC demonstrating that once pDC are able to bind HBV/HBsAg, the virus exerts its immune regulatory effect. HBV not only directly interfered with pDC function, but also indirectly by interfering with monocyte-pDC interaction. Also HBeAg diminished pDC function to a certain extent, but via another unknown mechanism. Interestingly, patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B displayed impaired CpG-induced IFNα production by pDC without significant alterations in Loxoribine-induced pDC function compared to HBeAg-negative patients and healthy controls. The lack of activation and the active inhibition of pDC by HBV may both contribute to HBV persistence. The finding that the interaction between pDC and HBV may change upon activation may aid in the identification of a scavenging receptor supporting immunosuppressive effects of HBV and also in the design of novel treatment strategies for chronic HBV."
https://openalex.org/W2160242309,"The ubiquitous fungus Aspergillus fumigatus is associated with chronic diseases such as invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in immunosuppressed patients and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) in patients with cystic fibrosis or severe asthma. Because of constant exposure to this fungus, it is critical for the host to exercise an immediate and decisive immune response to clear fungal spores to ward off disease. In this study, we observed that rapidly after infection by A. fumigatus, alveolar macrophages predominantly express Arginase 1 (Arg1), a key marker of alternatively activated macrophages (AAMs). The macrophages were also found to express Ym1 and CD206 that are also expressed by AAMs but not NOS2, which is expressed by classically activated macrophages. The expression of Arg1 was reduced in the absence of the known signaling axis, IL-4Rα/STAT6, for AAM development. While both Dectin-1 and TLR expressed on the cell surface have been shown to sense A. fumigatus, fungus-induced Arg1 expression in CD11c+ alveolar macrophages was not dependent on either Dectin-1 or the adaptor MyD88 that mediates intracellular signaling by most TLRs. Alveolar macrophages from WT mice efficiently phagocytosed fungal conidia, but those from mice deficient in Dectin-1 showed impaired fungal uptake. Depletion of macrophages with clodronate-filled liposomes increased fungal burden in infected mice. Collectively, our studies suggest that alveolar macrophages, which predominantly acquire an AAM phenotype following A. fumigatus infection, have a protective role in defense against this fungus."
https://openalex.org/W2020610175,"A central challenge of synthetic biology is to enable the growth of living systems using parts that are not derived from nature, but designed and synthesized in the laboratory. As an initial step toward achieving this goal, we probed the ability of a collection of >106 de novo designed proteins to provide biological functions necessary to sustain cell growth. Our collection of proteins was drawn from a combinatorial library of 102-residue sequences, designed by binary patterning of polar and nonpolar residues to fold into stable 4-helix bundles. We probed the capacity of proteins from this library to function in vivo by testing their abilities to rescue 27 different knockout strains of Escherichia coli, each deleted for a conditionally essential gene. Four different strains – ΔserB, ΔgltA, ΔilvA, and Δfes – were rescued by specific sequences from our library. Further experiments demonstrated that a strain simultaneously deleted for all four genes was rescued by co-expression of four novel sequences. Thus, cells deleted for ∼0.1% of the E. coli genome (and ∼1% of the genes required for growth under nutrient-poor conditions) can be sustained by sequences designed de novo."
https://openalex.org/W2005355126,"Background Successful treatment of acute radiation syndromes relies on immediate supportive care. In patients with limited hematopoietic recovery potential, hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation is the only curative treatment option. Because of time consuming donor search and uncertain outcome we propose MSC treatment as an alternative treatment for severely radiation-affected individuals. Methods and Findings Mouse mesenchymal stromal cells (mMSCs) were expanded from bone marrow, retrovirally labeled with eGFP (bulk cultures) and cloned. Bulk and five selected clonal mMSCs populations were characterized in vitro for their multilineage differentiation potential and phenotype showing no contamination with hematopoietic cells. Lethally irradiated recipients were i.v. transplanted with bulk or clonal mMSCs. We found a long-term survival of recipients with fast hematopoietic recovery after the transplantation of MSCs exclusively without support by HSCs. Quantitative PCR based chimerism analysis detected eGFP-positive donor cells in peripheral blood immediately after injection and in lungs within 24 hours. However, no donor cells in any investigated tissue remained long-term. Despite the rapidly disappearing donor cells, microarray and quantitative RT-PCR gene expression analysis in the bone marrow of MSC-transplanted animals displayed enhanced regenerative features characterized by (i) decreased proinflammatory, ECM formation and adhesion properties and (ii) boosted anti-inflammation, detoxification, cell cycle and anti-oxidative stress control as compared to HSC-transplanted animals. Conclusions Our data revealed that systemically administered MSCs provoke a protective mechanism counteracting the inflammatory events and also supporting detoxification and stress management after radiation exposure. Further our results suggest that MSCs, their release of trophic factors and their HSC-niche modulating activity rescue endogenous hematopoiesis thereby serving as fast and effective first-line treatment to combat radiation-induced hematopoietic failure."
https://openalex.org/W2060945430,"Endosymbiotic dinoflagellates in the genus Symbiodinium are fundamentally important to the biology of scleractinian corals, as well as to a variety of other marine organisms. The genus Symbiodinium is genetically and functionally diverse and the taxonomic nature of the union between Symbiodinium and corals is implicated as a key trait determining the environmental tolerance of the symbiosis. Surprisingly, the question of how Symbiodinium diversity partitions within a species across spatial scales of meters to kilometers has received little attention, but is important to understanding the intrinsic biological scope of a given coral population and adaptations to the local environment. Here we address this gap by describing the Symbiodinium ITS2 sequence assemblages recovered from colonies of the reef building coral Montipora capitata sampled across Kāne'ohe Bay, Hawai'i. A total of 52 corals were sampled in a nested design of Coral Colony(Site(Region)) reflecting spatial scales of meters to kilometers. A diversity of Symbiodinium ITS2 sequences was recovered with the majority of variance partitioning at the level of the Coral Colony. To confirm this result, the Symbiodinium ITS2 sequence diversity in six M. capitata colonies were analyzed in much greater depth with 35 to 55 clones per colony. The ITS2 sequences and quantitative composition recovered from these colonies varied significantly, indicating that each coral hosted a different assemblage of Symbiodinium. The diversity of Symbiodinium ITS2 sequence assemblages retrieved from individual colonies of M. capitata here highlights the problems inherent in interpreting multi-copy and intra-genomically variable molecular markers, and serves as a context for discussing the utility and biological relevance of assigning species names based on Symbiodinium ITS2 genotyping."
https://openalex.org/W2070599325,"Repeated use, coitus-independent microbicide gels that do not contain antiretroviral agents also used as first line HIV therapy are urgently needed to curb HIV spread. Current formulations require high doses (millimolar range) of antiretroviral drugs and typically only provide short-term protection in macaques. We used the macaque model to test the efficacy of a novel combination microbicide gel containing zinc acetate and micromolar doses of the novel non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor MIV-150 for up to 24 h after repeated gel application.Rhesus macaques were vaginally challenged with SHIV-RT up to 24 h after repeated administration of microbicide versus placebo gels. Infection status was determined by measuring virologic and immunologic parameters. Combination microbicide gels containing 14 mM zinc acetate dihydrate and 50 µM MIV-150 afforded full protection (21 of 21 animals) for up to 24 h after 2 weeks of daily application. Partial protection was achieved with the MIV-150 gel (56% of control at 8 h after last application, 11% at 24 h), while the zinc acetate gel afforded more pronounced protection (67% at 8-24 h). Marked protection persisted when the zinc acetate or MIV-150/zinc acetate gels were applied every other day for 4 weeks prior to challenge 24 h after the last gel was administered (11 of 14 protected). More MIV-150 was associated with cervical tissue 8 h after daily dosing of MIV-150/zinc acetate versus MIV-150, while comparable MIV-150 levels were associated with vaginal tissues and at 24 h.A combination MIV-150/zinc acetate gel and a zinc acetate gel provide significant protection against SHIV-RT infection for up to 24 h. This represents a novel advancement, identifying microbicides that do not contain anti-viral agents used to treat HIV infection and which can be used repeatedly and independently of coitus, and underscores the need for future clinical testing of their safety and ability to prevent HIV transmission in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1974207755,"Interstitial flow directly affects cells that reside in tissues and regulates tissue physiology and pathology by modulating important cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, and migration. However, the structures that cells utilize to sense interstitial flow in a 3-dimensional (3D) environment have not yet been elucidated. Previously, we have shown that interstitial flow upregulates matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression in rat vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and fibroblasts/myofibroblasts via activation of an ERK1/2-c-Jun pathway, which in turn promotes cell migration in collagen. Herein, we focused on uncovering the flow-induced mechanotransduction mechanism in 3D.Cleavage of rat vascular SMC surface glycocalyx heparan sulfate (HS) chains from proteoglycan (PG) core proteins by heparinase or disruption of HS biosynthesis by silencing N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase 1 (NDST1) suppressed interstitial flow-induced ERK1/2 activation, interstitial collagenase (MMP-13) expression, and SMC motility in 3D collagen. Inhibition or knockdown of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) also attenuated or blocked flow-induced ERK1/2 activation, MMP-13 expression, and cell motility. Interstitial flow induced FAK phosphorylation at Tyr925, and this activation was blocked when heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) were disrupted. These data suggest that HSPGs mediate interstitial flow-induced mechanotransduction through FAK-ERK. In addition, we show that integrins are crucial for mechanotransduction through HSPGs as they mediate cell spreading and maintain cytoskeletal rigidity.We propose a conceptual mechanotransduction model wherein cell surface glycocalyx HSPGs, in the presence of integrin-mediated cell-matrix adhesions and cytoskeleton organization, sense interstitial flow and activate the FAK-ERK signaling axis, leading to upregulation of MMP expression and cell motility in 3D. This is the first study to describe a flow-induced mechanotransduction mechanism via HSPG-mediated FAK activation in 3D. This study will be of interest in understanding the flow-related mechanobiology in vascular lesion formation, tissue morphogenesis, cancer cell metastasis, and stem cell differentiation in 3D, and also has implications in tissue engineering."
https://openalex.org/W2153307181,"Repeated exposure of rabbits and other animals to ticks results in acquired resistance or immunity to subsequent tick bites and is partially elicited by antibodies directed against tick antigens. In this study we demonstrate the utility of a yeast surface display approach to identify tick salivary antigens that react with tick-immune serum. We constructed an Ixodes scapularis nymphal salivary gland yeast surface display library and screened the library with nymph-immune rabbit sera and identified five salivary antigens. Four of these proteins, designated P8, P19, P23 and P32, had a predicted signal sequence. We generated recombinant (r) P8, P19 and P23 in a Drosophila expression system for functional and immunization studies. rP8 showed anti-complement activity and rP23 demonstrated anti-coagulant activity. Ixodes scapularis feeding was significantly impaired when nymphs were fed on rabbits immunized with a cocktail of rP8, rP19 and rP23, a hall mark of tick-immunity. These studies also suggest that these antigens may serve as potential vaccine candidates to thwart tick feeding."
https://openalex.org/W2083359331,"The discovery that class C G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) function as obligatory dimeric entities has generated major interest in GPCR oligomerization. Oligomerization now appears to be a common feature among all GPCR classes. However, the functional significance of this process remains unclear because, in vitro, some monomeric GPCRs, such as rhodopsin and β(2)-adrenergic receptors, activate G proteins. By using wild type and mutant serotonin type 4 receptors (5-HT(4)Rs) (including a 5-HT(4)-RASSL) expressed in COS-7 cells as models of class A GPCRs, we show that activation of one protomer in a dimer was sufficient to stimulate G proteins. However, coupling efficiency was 2 times higher when both protomers were activated. Expression of combinations of 5-HT(4), in which both protomers were able to bind to agonists but only one could couple to G proteins, suggested that upon agonist occupancy, protomers did not independently couple to G proteins but rather that only one G protein was activated. Coupling of a single heterotrimeric G(s) protein to a receptor dimer was further confirmed in vitro, using the purified recombinant WT RASSL 5-HT(4)R obligatory heterodimer. These results, together with previous findings, demonstrate that, differently from class C GPCR dimers, class A GPCR dimers have pleiotropic activation mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2050897598,"SUMOylation of proteins is a cyclic process that requires both conjugation and deconjugation of SUMO moieties. Besides modification by a single SUMO, SUMO chains have also been observed, yet the dynamics of SUMO conjugation/deconjugation remain poorly understood.

Reversible post-translational modification of proteins by ubiquitin-like covalent modifiers is a widely utilized mechanism to alter the fate, binding partners, function, or localization of a given target protein (1Schwartz D.C. Hochstrasser M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 321-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). A prime example is the covalent attachment of multiple ubiquitin moieties to a lysine side-chain of a target protein (2Hershko A. Cell. 1983; 34: 11-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), leading to the formation of ubiquitin chains, which have different functions depending on the lysine utilized in the internal ubiquitin linkage. Recently, small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) 2The abbreviations used are: SUMO, small ubiquitin-like modifier; SENP, SUMO-specific proteases. has also been shown to form chains in vitro (3Tatham M.H.

The SUMO conjugation pathway consists of SUMO activation, transfer, and ligation enzyme machinery analogous to the ubiquitin pathway (7Johnson E.S. Schwienhorst I. Dohmen R.J. Blobel G.

Nakamura A. Cox J. Barton G.J. Mann M. Hay R.T. Sci. Signal. 2009; 2: ra24Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), yet the extent of observable SUMOylation is only a snapshot due to the presence of SUMO-specific proteases, SENPs. The SUMO cycle begins and ends with specific proteolytic events: the processing of proSUMO and the deconjugation of SUMO from the target protein by SENPs (11Drag M. Salvesen G.S. IUBMB Life. 2008; 60: 734-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In addition to monoSUMOylation, there is now growing evidence that SUMO, like ubiquitin, forms polymeric chains. Thus, the non-covalent interaction of the SUMO conjugating enzyme, Ubc9, with SUMO has presented a possible mechanism for SUMO chain formation (4Knipscheer P. van Dijk W.J. Olsen J.V. Mann M.

Melchior F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 947-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). In vitro the SUMOylation system is quite permissive, allowing for multiple SUMO-SUMO linkages (14Jeram S.M. Srikumar T. Zhang X.D. Anne Eisenhauer H. Rogers R. Pedrioli P.G. Matunis M. Raught B. Proteomics. 2010; 10: 254-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The initial indication that SUMO chains exist in vivo came from transfection experiments yielding multimers of SUMO2 conjugated to HDAC4 (3Tatham M.H. Jaffray E. Vaughan O.A. Desterro J.M.

More recently, evidence for in vivo SUMO chains comes from mass-spectrometry experiments using HeLa cells, revealing chain formation via Lys-11 of SUMO2 and SUMO3 (5Matic I. van Hagen M. Schimmel J.

However, the extent of polySUMO versus monoSUMO modification of the proteome has yet to be established, although polySUMOylation has been reported to increase during heat shock treatments (10Golebiowski F.

Once SUMO chains have been assembled on a substrate they could have two fates. They can either be disassembled by SENPs, presumably recycling the SUMO monomers and the target protein (11Drag M.

Tainer J.A. Boddy M.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2008; 33: 201-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). SENPs are cysteine proteases that belong to peptidase clan C48 and share a common fold of their catalytic domain (18Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae there are two deSUMOylating enzymes, Ulp1 and Ulp2, while humans have six (SENP1, -2, -3, -5, -6, and -7). SENPs are dual function proteases that can remove the C-terminal extensions from SUMO precursors and deconjugate SUMO from modified proteins (19Békés M. Salvesen G.S. Mechanisms and substrate specificity of deSUMOylating enyzmes.in: Di Napoli M. Wojcik C. The Ubiquitin Proteasome System in the Central Nervous System: From Physiology to Pathology - 2008 update.

J. 2006; 397: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and a distinction has been established that sets SENP6 and SENP7 apart from other human SENPs, largely because of their poor ability to process SUMO precursors and monoSUMOylated RanGAP1. Rather, SENP6 and SENP7 have been proposed to be chain-specific, partly because SENP6 and SENP7 are most similar to yeast Ulp2, which has been shown to limit the amount Smt3 chains in yeast (15Bylebyl G.R. Belichenko I. Johnson E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44113-44120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Several questions remain to be answered; how are SUMO chains recognized and deconjugated by SENPs, how dynamic is the process, and how important are the dynamics? To answer these questions we utilized two human SENPs, SENP1, and SENP6, that diverge substantially in specificity and sequence conservation to determine the mechanism of SUMO chain deconjugation. Furthermore, by using a conjugatable, but not deconjugatable version of SUMO, which targets physiological substrates, we investigated how SENPs participate in and regulate the dynamics of SUMO chains in vivo. We also investigated the influence of irreversible SUMOylation on cellular growth rate and sensitivity to replication stress in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. For LC-MS/MS analysis, 4 mg of SENP-treated and untreated E. coli lysates were treated with 6 m guanidine and 10 mm DTT, alkylated with 30 mm iodoacetamide, and buffer exchanged into 8 m urea, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, TCA precipitated, and re-dissolved in 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0. Samples were desalted on C18-ZipTip columns, re-dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 2% acetonitrile and 3 μg of material was loaded onto an OrbiTrap-XL mass spectrometer (Thermo) via a C18-column (0.2 × 150 mm Michrom Magic, 3 μm particles, 200Å pore size) and eluted on a 180min RP gradient, and analyzed by CID with top 4 data-dependent MS/MS scans. MS/MS spectra were searched by the Sequest algorithm using Proteome Discoverer 1.1 for protein identification and using the SUMmOn software to detect SUMO conjugates (14Jeram S.M. Srikumar T.

SUMO-transfected HEK293A lysates were sedimented twice at 13,200rpm at 4 °C in a tabletop centrifuge to clear insoluble material. The lysates were separated by size-exclusion chromatography on a 24 ml Superose-6 gel-filtration column (GE Healthcare) in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA using an Akta FPLC system. Collected fractions (0.5 ml) were stored at −20 °C overnight or cleaved immediately with a serial dilution of the indicated SENPs in the presence of 5 mm DTT for 30 min at 37 °C and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Primary antibodies were detected by classical chemiluminescence using HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare) or by fluorophore-coupled secondary antibodies (LiCOR) and quantified using the Odyssey system. Quantification was based on the uncleaved material, expressed in percentages compared with the no enzyme control lane. DeSUMOylation reactions of E. coli-purified SUMO conjugates were carried out in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mm NaCl and 10 mm DTT. 4 μg of SUMO2 chain-conjugates were cleaved with 2-fold serial dilutions of 100 nm SENPs as indicated for 30 min at 37 °C, the reactions were terminated by boiling in SDS-loading buffer. Results were visualized by Coomassie staining or Western blotting with anti-SUMO-2/3 antibodies. Three repeats of ΔN11-SUMO2 were linked in a linear fashion “head-to-tail” one linkage at a time by ligation following individual PCR reactions and finally cloned into pET28 with an N-terminal FLAG-tag and a C-terminal His tag. The SENP-cleavage site at the P4 position (22Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4783) Google Scholar) was alternated between Gln (wild-type) and Pro (Q90P mutant). The three SUMO moieties were amplified independently by PCR with the following restriction sites: NcoI-AgeI (moiety #1), AgeI-Tsp45I (moiety #2), and Tsp45I-XhoI (moiety #3). The full list of primers for this intricate cloning is available upon request. For cleavage assays, tri-SUMO2 constructs were diluted to 2 μm final concentration and cleaved with a 2-fold serial dilution of 1 μm SENPs for 30 min at 37 °C, then visualized by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. All constructs were verified to have the correct orientation of cleavable (wild-type) or non-cleavable (Q90P) tri-SUMO2 moieties by DNA sequencing as well as Western blotting for FLAG and for His following ± SENP-treatment of the purified proteins (see supplemental Fig. S7). HEK293A and HeLa cells were readily maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Cellgro) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 2 mm l-glutamine. Full-length and catalytic-domain SENP constructs and all the SUMO variants were transfected into cells using NanoJuice (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 6–48 h post-transfection cells were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed on ice in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% CHAPS, supplemented with the protease inhibitors trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido(4-guanidino) butane, 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin, leupeptin and MG-132 in the presence or absence of 30 mm of the cysteine modifier N-ethyl-maleimide (NEM, Pierce). To purify FLAG-tagged SENPs from HEK293A cells, lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-FLAG agarose-beads (M2, Sigma), then washed three times in lysis buffer, and twice in PBS and eluted with 3×-FLAG-peptide (Sigma) and labeled with HA-SUMO2 vinylmethyl ester for 30min at 37 °C to ensure their activity. Lysates were used immediately for subsequent experiments or kept at −20 °C. A pool of five individual siRNA oligonucleotides (Qiagen) that target the 3′-UTR region of the SUMO2 and the SUMO3 mRNA were used in the experiments at 3 nm final concentration per individual siRNA (see supplemental methods for sequences used). HEK293A cells were reverse-transfected with the siRNA alone or together with rescue plasmids according to the manufacturer's protocol and the cells were harvested 48 h post-transfections and the lysates were probed with the indicated antibodies. Phase-contrast images of cells were taken with a camera attached to an Olympus IX71 microscope (Olympus) at ×100 and ×200 magnification (data not shown). For growth curve experiments HEK293A cells were reverse-transfected at low confluence in 6-well plates and immediately transferred to 24-well plates, split six-ways and maintained in full DMEM for the indicated times, then trypsinized and counted manually using a hemocytometer by Trypan Blue (Sigma) staining. pREP41-eGFP-pmt3-Q108P was cloned via standard PCR protocols using pmt3 cDNA and primers described in supplemental methods. The resulting product was then NdeI-BamHI digested and cloned into pREP41. Western blot analysis of total levels of SUMOylation has been described previously (23Prudden J. Pebernard S. Raffa G.

The S. pombe strains used for this study are listed in supplemental Table S1. When cells are lysed under non-denaturing conditions (24Golebiowski F. Tatham M.H. Nakamura A. Hay R.T. Nat. Protoc. 2010; 5: 873-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) almost no SUMOylated proteins are observable. Including a cysteine modifier such as NEM or the denaturant SDS retains a certain level of SUMOylation, and the general conclusion is that endogenous constitutively active SENPs rapidly deconjugate SUMOylated proteins as a lysis artifact (24Golebiowski F. Tatham M.H. Nakamura A. Hay R.T. Nat. Protoc. 2010; 5: 873-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that SENPs continuously deconjugate SUMO from its targets, and that a dynamic balance exists between SUMO addition and deconjugation, which is not represented in the instantaneous steady state captured in lysates. To address the dynamics of the SUMOylation cycle in vivo, we utilized a mutation within the cleavage site of SUMO that allows for conjugation, but is defective in deconjugation by SENPs (25Owerbach D. McKay E.M. Yeh E.T. Gabbay K.H. Bohren K.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 337: 517-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). We created eukaryotic expression constructs of wild-type (wt) mature SUMO2 and the aforementioned Q90P mutant, containing N-terminal epitope tags, and transfected them into HEK293A cells. The conjugating enzymes of the SUMO pathway tolerate the Q90P mutant because both the SUMO E1 and E2 have large active site cavities (9Reverter D. Lima C.D. Nature. 2005; 435: 687-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 26Olsen S.K. Capili A.D. Lu X. Tan D.S. Lima C.D. Nature. 2010; 463: 906-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and can accommodate a slightly kinked SUMO C terminus introduced by Pro in P4, however the narrow active site cleft of SENPs does not tolerate it (27Drag M. Mikolajczyk J. Krishnakumar I.M. Huang Z. Salvesen G.S. Biochem. J. 2008; 409: 461-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Upon cell lysis, Q90P SUMO2 remains extensively conjugated in even in the absence of NEM (Fig. 1A), demonstrating that while the SUMO conjugation machinery accepts this mutant, endogenous SENPs are unable to remove it during lysis and presumably in vivo as well. The analogous mutation in SUMO1 also results in stabilized SUMOylation (supplemental Fig. S1), however, it does not significantly enhance SUMOylation over wt levels. We therefore focused our studies on SUMO2/3, which are also the physiologically relevant chain forming SUMO paralogs. To further demonstrate the rapid dynamics of the SUMO pathway we performed a transfection time course experiment showing the expression of wild-type and the Q90P mutant SUMO2 (Fig. 1B). We begin to see both monomeric unconjugated and higher molecular weight (HMW) conjugated species of wild-type SUMO2 as early as six hours post-transfection. On the contrary, the Q90P mutant mainly appears as HMW conjugates with very little observable unconjugated monomer. This suggests that wild-type SUMO2 continuously cycles in a very dynamic process, presumably due to the action of endogenous SENPs, which fail to deconjugate the Q90P mutant, leading to an accumulation of stably SUMOylated proteins. To investigate the nature of the HMW-conjugated SUMO species we enriched them by size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 1, C and D) and cleaved them with serial dilutions of the catalytic domain of SENP1 (ΔN-SENP1). SUMO conjugates from wild-type SUMO2 HMW fractions were cleaved very rapidly (EC50 in the low nm range) and reaction products were converted exclusively to mono-SUMO moieties with no observable intermediates (Fig. 2A, left panel). In contrast, cleavage of HMW SUMO conjugates from the Q90P SUMO2 mutant shows very different kinetics (Fig. 2A, right panel). Quantifying the disappearance of HMW conjugates demonstrates that the Q90P SUMO2 mutant is eventually deconjugatable with very high levels of ΔN-SENP1, but with substantially decreased kinetics, a 1000-fold change in EC50 (Fig. 2C). This suggests that while the deconjugation of SUMO Q90P is possible in vitro, it is highly unlikely to happen in vivo. More importantly, the reduced rate of cleavage revealed multimeric cleavage intermediates (Fig. 2, A, right panel and B). The intermediates observed are consistent with variable length SUMO chains generated due to cleavage by SENPs. Importantly, a SUMO2 Q90P mutant, in which the three Lys residues (Lys-6, Lys-8, and Lys-11) in the N terminus were mutated to Arg to limit chain elongation (3Tatham M.H. Jaffray E. Vaughan O.A. Desterro J.M. Botting C.H. Naismith J.H. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35368-35374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), prevented the appearance of the multimeric cleavage intermediates (Fig. 2D). Thus, by definition and logic, the universe of SUMOylated proteins contains abundant SUMO chains. In control experiments we demonstrate that the HMW-conjugates are indeed polySUMO adducts, because they are cleaved by SENPs but not by a promiscuous deubiquitinating enzyme (data not shown). We ruled out the possibility that a putative endogenous E. coli-purified factor could be responsible for the deconjugation because a catalytically dead ΔN-SENP1 with an Ala replacing the active site Cys does not remove the HMW SUMO conjugates (data not shown) and we also show that SUMO chains of variable lengths from numerous gel-filtration fractions are collapsed in a similar fashion (supplemental Fig. S2). Notably, the N-terminal domain of SENP1 does not substantially influence cleavage of Q90P HMW-SUMO conjugates because full-length, wild type SENP1 also trims SUMO chains to SUMO multimers, showing that SUMO chain deconjugation is an intrinsic property of human SENPs (supplemental Fig. S3). To ensure the validity of the SUMO2 Q90P mutant in “permanently” SUMOylating endogenous substrates, we looked for SUMO conjugates by mass spectrometry. We developed SUMO-PROTOMAP (supplemental Fig. S4), a method inspired by a technique developed by Dix et al. (28Dix M.M. Simon G.M. Cravatt B.F. Cell. 2008; 134: 679-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), which is capable of identifying SUMO conjugates by virtue of a downshift of a deSUMOylated substrate through deconjugation by SENP1 (see supplemental methods for details). In this small-scale study we were able to identify known SUMOylation substrates using SUMO2 Q90P (supplemental Fig. S5), confirming that this mutant SUMO stabilizes endogenous (poly)SUMO conjugates. Having demonstrated the extensive existence of SUMO chains in vivo because of the Q90P mutant, we wanted to know the reason behind their presumed ephemeral existence. An obvious explanation is that they are such excellent substrates of SENPs that the cleavage intermediates are hard to demonstrate experimentally, because we only observe them using the Q90P mutant. To demonstrate that SENPs efficiently cleave SUMO chains, we purified SUMO chains expressed in E. coli, either as unanchored chains, or anchored to the canonical SUMO substrate RanGAP1, by employing a polycistronic expression vector encoding SUMO E1, E2, and SUMO2 (29Uchimura Y. Nakamura M. Sugasawa K. Nakao M. Saitoh H. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 331: 204-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Unanchored SUMO2 chains could be collapsed entirely upon treatment by a deSUMOylating enzyme (Fig. 3A). Subjecting the total E. coli lysate expressing SUMO2 chains to LC-MS/MS after tryptic digestion, and filtering for specific SUMO conjugates (30Srikumar T. Jeram S.M. Lam H. Raught B. Proteomics. 2010; 10: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) revealed that the primary SUMO-SUMO linkage is via Lys-11 of SUMO2. However, we were also able to detect a less abundant linkage via Lys-42 (Fig. 3B and supplemental Fig. S6). The catalytic domains of both SENP1 and SENP6 (ΔN-SENP1 and ΔN-SENP6), as examples of the different classes of SENPs (19Békés M. Salvesen G.S. Mechanisms and substrate specificity of deSUMOylating enyzmes.in: Di Napoli M. Wojcik C. The Ubiquitin Proteasome System in the Central Nervous System: From Physiology to Pathology - 2008 update. Nova Science Publishers, 2010Google Scholar), efficiently deconjugate SUMO2 chains produced in E. coli, whether or not they are attached to a heterologous protein acceptor, such as RanGAP1 (Fig. 3, C and D). Interestingly, even though our recombinant enzymes are comparably reactive toward an activity-based probe, ΔN-SENP1 cleaves SUMO2 chains more efficiently than does ΔN-SENP6 (Fig. 3, C and D). We therefore conclude that SUMO chain deconjugation (at least in vitro) is not a unique property of SENP6 and SENP7, but other SENPs share this activity. Preliminary studies that we conducted with heterogeneous mixtures of multiple SUMO chains of various lengths did not allow us to determine whether SUMO chains are cleaved (i) from the free chain end, one SUMO at a time (processive deconjugation) or (ii) randomly anywhere within the chain (stochastic deconjugation) giving rise to various multimeric cleavage intermediates. We therefore developed an in vitro model system to specifically address the mechanism of SUMO chain deconjugation. We designed a set of linear tri-SUMO2 constructs mimicking isopeptide-linked chains to generate a homogenous system. In this system we can address the importance of each cleavage site within a chain individually. Because SUMO chains are predominantly linked by Lys-11 of SUMO2 and SUMO3 in vivo (5Matic I. van Hagen M. Schimmel J. Macek B. Ogg S.C. Tatham M.H. Hay R.T. Lamond A.I. Mann M. Vertegaal A.C. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2008; 7: 132-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 31Jeram S.M. Srikumar T. Pedrioli P.G. Raught B. Proteomics. 2009; 9: 922-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), we generated linear concatamers lacking the first 11 residues of SUMO2 to closely approximate this linkage. In these linear constructs, three ΔN11-SUMO2 molecules are fused “head-to-tail” (N to C terminus by a peptide bond) to simulate an isopeptide-linked tri-SUMO2 (Fig. 4A). Each concatamer has an N-terminal FLAG-tag and a C-terminal His tag that allows discrimination of the fragments after SENP-cleavage based on the size of the cleaved SUMO monomers (Fig. 4B) and by Western blotting (supplemental Fig. S7). Next, we used the cleavage prohibitive mutation Q90P to direct cleavage by SENPs at specific sites within linear chain (Fig. 4A). If all three available cleavage sites contain the Q90P mutation, the tri-SUMO2 construct is uncleavable (Fig. 4B and supplemental Fig. S8A) in the context of our linear constructs, where SENPs act as endopeptidases. We defined EC50 as the amount of protease required to cleave 50% of the substrate in a given time. For those constructs containing only a single cleavage site, there was no significant difference in the EC50 values, irrespective of the position of the cleavage site within the constructs for either ΔN-SENP1 (Fig. 4C) or for ΔN-SENP6 (Fig. 4D). Thus, there is no preferential recognition of any SUMO moiety within such a linear chain. This is further supported by allowing cleavage after both the first and second moiety, resulting in the simultaneous processing of the tri-SUMO2 construct from both ends, giving rise to the appearance of all three SUMO monomers (supplemental Fig. S8B). However, we noticed that cleavage after the last SUMO moiety, just before the His tag, slightly enhances cleavage (2-fold decrease in EC50) for all the SENPs tested. This is consistent with their preference for shorter C-terminal fragments when assayed on proSUMOs (20Mikolajczyk J. Drag M. Bekes M. Cao J.T. Ronai Z. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 26217-26224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Our data point to a stochastic mechanism for chain cleavage of our model tri-SUMO2 constructs, and reveal that both SENP1 and SENP6, as examples of different classes of SENPs, share this mechanism. Therefore, specificity is directed by the primary recognition mechanism of a single SUMO moiety, at least at the level of the catalytic domain of SENPs. Full-length human SENP1 also does not discriminate between cleavage sites when assayed on linear triSUMO2 constructs (supplemental Fig. S9), indicating that mechanistically it is no different from its catalytic domain. Taken into account that full-length SENP1 also trims HMW-conjugates of SUMO Q90P (supplemental Fig. S3) it is safe to say that whatever the function of the N-terminal domain of SENP1 might be, it has no significant restrictive effects on the processing of SUMO chains. In the fission yeast S. pombe deletion of Pmt3 (the sole S. pombe SUMO homologue) displays a phenotype with an increased sensitivity to DNA damage (32Tanaka K. Nishide J. Okazaki K. Kato H. Niwa O.

To address the biological role of deSUMOylation we generated Pmt3-Q108P to replicate the Q90P mutation of human SUMO2. GFP-tagged wild-type Pmt3 and the Q108P mutant were ectopically expressed in the pmt3Δ strain, and as expected, the Q108P mutant enhanced stable Pmt3-conjugates (Fig. 5A). Additionally, when plated on hydroxyurea, ΔPmt3 cells expressing the Q108P mutant grew just as slowly as the deletion str"

However, the role of Lmx1b in adult 5-HTergic neurons is unknown. We used an inducible Cre-LoxP system to selectively inactivate Lmx1b expression in the raphe nuclei of adult mice. Pet1-CreER(T2) mice were generated and crossed with Lmx1b(flox/flox) mice to obtain Pet1-CreER(T2); Lmx1b(flox/flox) mice (which termed as Lmx1b iCKO). After administration of tamoxifen, the level of 5-HT in the brain of Lmx1b iCKO mice was reduced to 60% of that in control mice, and the expression of tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (Tph2), serotonin transporter (Sert) and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (Vmat2) was greatly down-regulated. On the other hand, the expression of dopamine and norepinephrine as well as aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (Aadc) and Pet1 was unchanged. Our results reveal that Lmx1b is required for the biosynthesis of 5-HT in adult mouse brain, and it may be involved in maintaining normal functions of central 5-HTergic neurons by regulating the expression of Tph2, Sert and Vmat2."
https://openalex.org/W1969135502,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) direct a proinflammatory program in macrophages. One mediator whose generation is induced by TLR ligation is prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), which is well known to increase intracellular cAMP upon G protein-coupled receptor ligation. How PGE(2)/cAMP shapes the nascent TLR response and the mechanisms by which it acts remain poorly understood. Here we explored PGE(2)/cAMP regulation of NO production in primary rat alveolar macrophages stimulated with the TLR4 ligand LPS. Endogenous PGE(2) synthesis accounted for nearly half of the increment in NO production in response to LPS. The enhancing effect of PGE(2) on LPS-stimulated NO was mediated via cAMP, generated mainly upon ligation of the E prostanoid 2 receptor and acting via protein kinase A (PKA) rather than via the exchange protein activated by cAMP. Isoenzyme-selective cAMP agonists and peptide disruptors of protein kinase A anchoring proteins (AKAPs) implicated PKA regulatory subunit type I (RI) interacting with an AKAP in this process. Gene knockdown of potential RI-interacting AKAPs expressed in alveolar macrophages revealed that AKAP10 was required for PGE(2) potentiation of LPS-induced NO synthesis. AKAP10 also mediated PGE(2) potentiation of the expression of cytokines IL-10 and IL-6, whereas PGE(2) suppression of TNF-α was mediated by AKAP8-anchored PKA-RII. Our data illustrate the pleiotropic manner in which G protein-coupled receptor-derived cAMP signaling can influence TLR responses in primary macrophages and suggest that AKAP10 may coordinate increases in gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2021575109,"Representing a renewable source for cell replacement, neural stem cells have received substantial attention in recent years. The neurosphere assay represents a method to detect the presence of neural stem cells, however owing to a deficiency of specific and definitive markers to identify them, their quantification and the rate they expand is still indefinite. Here we propose a mathematical interpretation of the neurosphere assay allowing actual measurement of neural stem cell symmetric division frequency. The algorithm of the modeling demonstrates a direct correlation between the overall cell fold expansion over time measured in the sphere assay and the rate stem cells expand via symmetric division. The model offers a methodology to evaluate specifically the effect of diseases and treatments on neural stem cell activity and function. Not only providing new insights in the evaluation of the kinetic features of neural stem cells, our modeling further contemplates cancer biology as cancer stem-like cells have been suggested to maintain tumor growth as somatic stem cells maintain tissue homeostasis. Indeed, tumor stem cell's resistance to therapy makes these cells a necessary target for effective treatment. The neurosphere assay mathematical model presented here allows the assessment of the rate malignant stem-like cells expand via symmetric division and the evaluation of the effects of therapeutics on the self-renewal and proliferative activity of this clinically relevant population that drive tumor growth and recurrence."
https://openalex.org/W2045552876,"Background Preterm small for gestational age (SGA) infants may be at risk for increased adiposity, especially when experiencing rapid postnatal weight gain. Data on the dynamic features of body weight and fat mass (FM) gain that occurs early in life is scarce. We investigated the postnatal weight and FM gain during the first five months after term in a cohort of preterm infants. Methodology/Principal Findings Changes in growth parameters and FM were prospectively monitored in 195 infants with birth weight ≤1500 g. The infants were categorized as born adequate for gestational age (AGA) without growth retardation at term (GR−), born AGA with growth retardation at term (GR+), born SGA. Weight and FM were assessed by an air displacement plethysmography system. At five months, weight z-score was comparable between the AGA (GR+) and the AGA (GR−), whereas the SGA showed a significantly lower weight.The mean weight (g) differences (95% CI) between SGA and AGA (GR−) and between SGA and AGA (GR+) infants at 5 months were −613 (−1215; −12) and −573 (−1227; −79), respectively. At term, the AGA (GR+) and the SGA groups showed a significantly lower FM than the AGA (GR−) group. In the first three months, change in FM was comparable between the AGA (GR+) and the SGA groups and significantly higher than that of the AGA (GR−) group.The mean difference (95% CI) in FM change between SGA and AGA (GR−) and between AGA (GR+) and AGA (GR−) from term to 3 months were 38.6 (12; 65); and 37.7 (10; 65). At three months, the FM was similar in all groups. Conclusions Our data suggests that fetal growth pattern influences the potential to rapidly correct anthropometry whereas the restoration of fat stores takes place irrespective of birth weight. The metabolic consequences of these findings need to be elucidated."
https://openalex.org/W1985143021,"The mouse is an important model organism for investigating the molecular mechanisms of body weight regulation, but a quantitative understanding of mouse energy metabolism remains lacking. Therefore, we created a mathematical model of mouse energy metabolism to predict dynamic changes of body weight, body fat, energy expenditure, and metabolic fuel selection. Based on the principle of energy balance, we constructed ordinary differential equations representing the dynamics of body fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM) as a function of dietary intake and energy expenditure (EE). The EE model included the cost of tissue deposition, physical activity, diet-induced thermogenesis, and the influence of FM and FFM on metabolic rate. The model was calibrated using previously published data and validated by comparing its predictions to measurements in five groups of male C57/BL6 mice (N = 30) provided ad libitum access to either chow or high fat diets for varying time periods. The mathematical model accurately predicted the observed body weight and FM changes. Physical activity was predicted to decrease immediately upon switching from the chow to the high fat diet and the model coefficients relating EE to FM and FFM agreed with previous independent estimates. Metabolic fuel selection was predicted to depend on a complex interplay between diet composition, the degree of energy imbalance, and body composition. This is the first validated mathematical model of mouse energy metabolism and it provides a quantitative framework for investigating energy balance relationships in mouse models of obesity and diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2055435449,"The X protein (HBx) of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is involved in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and methionine adenosyltransferase 2A (MAT2A) promotes the growth of liver cancer cells through altering S-adenosylmethionine homeostasis. Thus, we speculated that a link between HBx and MAT2A may contribute to HCC development. In this study, the effects of HBx on MAT2A expression and cell apoptosis were investigated, and the molecular mechanism by which HBx and MAT2A regulate tumorigenesis was evaluated. Results from immunohistochemistry analyses of 37 pairs of HBV-associated liver cancer tissues/corresponding peritumor tissues showed that HBx and MAT2A are highly expressed in most liver tumor tissues. Our in vitro results revealed that HBx activates MAT2A expression in a dose-dependent manner in hepatoma cells, and such regulation requires the cis-regulatory elements NF-κB and CREB on the MAT2A gene promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) further demonstrated that HBx facilitates the binding of NF-κB and CREB to MAT2A gene promoter. In addition, overexpression of HBx or MAT2A inhibits cell apoptosis, whereas knockdown of MAT2A expression stimulates apoptosis in hepatoma cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that HBx reduces MAT1A expression and AdoMet production but enhances MAT2β expression. Thus, we proposed that HBx activates MAT2A expression through NF-κB and CREB signaling pathways to reduce AdoMet production, inhibit hepatoma cell apoptosis, and perhaps enhance HCC development. These findings should provide new insights into our understanding how the molecular mechanisms underline the effects of HBV infection on the production of MAT2A and the development of HCC."

https://openalex.org/W1982085766,"In addition to its pivotal role in hemostasis, fibrinogen (Fg) and provisional fibrin matrices play important roles in inflammation and regulate innate immune responses by interacting with leukocytes. Efb (the extracellular fibrinogen-binding protein) is a secreted Staphylococcus aureus protein that engages host Fg and complement C3. However, the molecular details underlying the Efb-Fg interaction and the biological relevance of this interaction have not been determined. In the present study, we characterize the interaction of Efb with Fg. We demonstrate that the Fg binding activity is located within the intrinsically disordered N-terminal half of Efb (Efb-N) and that the D fragment of Fg is the region that mediates Efb-N binding. More detailed studies of the Efb-N-Fg interactions using ELISA and surface plasmon resonance analyses revealed that Efb-N exhibits a much higher affinity for Fg than typically observed with Fg-binding MSCRAMMs (microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules), and data obtained from ELISA analyses using truncated Efb-N constructs demonstrate that Efb-N contains two binding sites located within residues 30–67 and 68–98, respectively. Efb-N inhibits neutrophil adhesion to immobilized Fg by binding to Fg and blocking the interaction of the protein with the leukocyte integrin receptor, αMβ2. A motif in the Fg γ chain previously shown to be central to the αMβ2 interaction was shown to be functionally distinguishable from the Efb-N binding site, suggesting that the Fg-Efb interaction indirectly impedes Fg engagement by αMβ2. Taken together, these studies provide insights into how Efb interacts with Fg and suggest that Efb may support bacterial virulence at least in part by impeding Fg-driven leukocyte adhesion events. In addition to its pivotal role in hemostasis, fibrinogen (Fg) and provisional fibrin matrices play important roles in inflammation and regulate innate immune responses by interacting with leukocytes.

In the present study, we characterize the interaction of Efb with Fg. We demonstrate that the Fg binding activity is located within the intrinsically disordered N-terminal half of Efb (Efb-N) and that the D fragment of Fg is the region that mediates Efb-N binding. More detailed studies of the Efb-N-Fg interactions using ELISA and surface plasmon resonance analyses revealed that Efb-N exhibits a much higher affinity for Fg than typically observed with Fg-binding MSCRAMMs (microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules), and data obtained from ELISA analyses using truncated Efb-N constructs demonstrate that Efb-N contains two binding sites located within residues 30–67 and 68–98, respectively. Efb-N inhibits neutrophil adhesion to immobilized Fg by binding to Fg and blocking the interaction of the protein with the leukocyte integrin receptor, αMβ2. A motif in the Fg γ chain previously shown to be central to the αMβ2 interaction was shown to be functionally distinguishable from the Efb-N binding site, suggesting that the Fg-Efb interaction indirectly impedes Fg engagement by αMβ2. Taken together, these studies provide insights into how Efb interacts with Fg and suggest that Efb may support bacterial virulence at least in part by impeding Fg-driven leukocyte adhesion events. IntroductionFibrinogen (Fg) 2The abbreviations used are: Fg, fibrinogen, Fg-D and Fg-E, D fragment and E fragment, respectively, of Fg; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; SPR, surface plasmon resonance. is an acute phase plasma protein that is the fundamental building block of insoluble fibrin clots and is understood to play an important role in hemostasis and inflammatory processes (1Herrick S. Blanc-Brude O. Gray A. Laurent G. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 741-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Mice lacking Fg exhibit a delayed inflammatory response and defects in wound healing (2Cruz-Topete D. Iwaki T. Ploplis V.A. Castellino F.J. J.

In addition to providing substrates for bacterial colonization, Fg also participates in the innate immune defense through interactions with leukocytes that support leukocyte activation events and delay apoptosis (4Rubel C. Gómez S. Fernández G.C. Isturiz M.A. Caamaño J. Palermo M.S. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 1429-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The interaction of Fg/fibrin with the leukocyte integrin αMβ2 contributes to the development of inflammatory disease processes, including inflammatory joint disease and neuroinflammatory disease (5Flick M.J. LaJeunesse C.M. Talmage K.E. Witte D.P. Palumbo J.S. Pinkerton M.D. Thornton S. Degen J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 3224-3235Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 6Adams R.A. Bauer J.

Witte D.P. Jirousková M. Soloviev D.A. Busuttil S.J. Plow E.F. Degen J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 1596-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar).Numerous bacterial proteins interact with Fg, including ClfA (clumping factor A), FnbpA, Eap, and coagulase from S. aureus; SdrG from Staphylococcus epidermidis; M protein from group A, C, and G streptococci; and FbsA from Staphylococcus agalactiae (8Rivera J. Vannakambadi G. Höök M. Speziale P. Thromb. Haemost. 2007; 98: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In many cases, these Fg-binding proteins act as virulence factors in animal models of infection. For example, ClfA promotes sepsis in a mouse model (9Josefsson E. Hartford O. O'Brien L. Patti J.M. Foster T. J. Infect. Dis. 2001; 184: 1572-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), and the streptococcal M proteins cause lung lesions in mice (10Herwald H. Cramer H. Mörgelin M. Russell W.

The goal of the present study was to further characterize the interaction of the secreted S. aureus Efb (extracellular fibrinogen-binding protein) with Fg and to determine how Efb may alter Fg-mediated leukocyte adhesion events.S. aureus is a versatile, opportunistic Gram-positive pathogen and a leading cause of bacterial infections worldwide (12Diekema D.J.

It causes a diverse array of diseases, ranging from minor skin infections to life-threatening diseases such as pneumonia, endocarditis, and sepsis (13Lowy F.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 520-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (4527) Google Scholar). S. aureus produces a large arsenal of virulence factors, including cell surface-associated adhesins, and secreted proteins like proteases, toxins, and superantigens (14Foster T.J. Höök M.

Several secreted staphylococcal proteins, including Eap (extracellular adhesive protein), CHIPS (chemotaxis inhibitory protein of staphylococci), and SCIN (staphylococcus complement inhibitor) appear to target and counter the host innate immune response (16Chavakis T.

The 16-kDa Efb protein has a disordered N-terminal region (Efb-N), spanning the sequence Efb(30–104), and a folded domain in the C-terminal region (Efb-C), spanning the sequence Efb(105–165) (25Lee L.Y.

Geisbrecht B.V. Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8: 430-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Earlier studies in our laboratory (20Lee L.Y. Höök M. Haviland D. Wetsel R.A. Yonter E.O. Syribeys P. Vernachio J. Brown E.L. J. Infect. Dis. 2004; 190: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and those of others (21Jongerius I. Köhl J. Pandey M.K. Ruyken M. van Kessel K.P. van Strijp J.A. Rooijakkers S.H. J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204: 2461-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) established that Efb-C binds to C3 and blocks C3b-containing convertase activities, resulting in decreased C3b deposition on the bacterial surface and down-regulation of the neutrophil response mediated by C5a. The crystal structure of the Efb-C·C3d complex revealed that the binding of Efb-C to C3 alters the conformation of C3 such that it cannot be processed into C3b (26Hammel M. Sfyroera G. Ricklin D. Magotti P. Lambris J.D. Geisbrecht B.V. Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8: 430-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Efb-C also blocks the interaction of C3d with complement receptor 2 (CR2), which plays a critical role in B cell maturation and activation, suggesting an additional role of Efb as an inhibitor of the adaptive immunity (27Ricklin D. Ricklin-Lichtsteiner S.K. Markiewski M.M. Geisbrecht B.V. Lambris J.D. J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 7463-7467Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).Efb also interacts with Fg (25Lee L.Y. Liang X.

Microbiol. 1994; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), but the precise motifs on bacterial Efb and host Fg as well as the precise biological significance of this interaction remain unclear (25Lee L.Y.

Chem. 1998; 273: 13177-13181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Our laboratory previously demonstrated that the intrinsically disordered Efb-N region is important for the Fg binding activity, whereas Efb-C does not contribute to Fg binding (25Lee L.Y. Liang X. Höök M. Brown E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50710-50716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Here, we have characterized the interaction of Efb with Fg in detail. Our results demonstrate that Efb binds with unusually high affinity to Fg, and we identify two distinct Fg-binding sequences within the Efb-N domain. Furthermore, we show that this interaction results in an inhibition of neutrophil adherence to immobilized Fg.DISCUSSIONThe inhibition of neutrophil adherence to Fg described in this study is a novel function for Efb that may be central to overall bacterial evasion of immune surveillance. Neutrophils are professional phagocytes that play a pivotal role in innate immunity and inflammatory responses by virtue of their ability to phagocytose microorganisms, produce inflammatory mediators, and elicit both intracellular and extracellular microbial killing strategies. The leukocyte-specific surface integrin, αMβ2/Mac-1, is one of several β2 integrins known to be central to both leukocyte trafficking and leukocyte activation events that support bacterial clearance. The αMβ2 integrin recognizes numerous ligands, including ICAM-1, C3bi, factor X, kininogen, and Fg (43Li Z. Cell Res. 1999; 9: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Several ex vivo and in vitro studies have shown that the interaction between Fg and neutrophils promotes neutrophil-endothelial transmigration (44Languino L.R. Plescia J. Duperray A. Brian A.A. Plow E.F. Geltosky J.E. Altieri D.C. Cell. 1993; 73: 1423-1434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), enhances phagocytosis (45Rubel C. Fernández G.C. Dran G. Bompadre M.B. Isturiz M.A. Palermo M.S. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 2002-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), activates NF-κB signaling (4Rubel C. Gómez S. Fernández G.C. Isturiz M.A. Caamaño J. Palermo M.S. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 1429-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), promotes degranulation (46Tuluc F. Garcia A. Bredetean O. Meshki J. Kunapuli S.P. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2004; 287: C1264-C1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), produces chemokines and cytokines (47Kuhns D.B. Nelson E.L. Alvord W.G. Gallin J.I. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2869-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and delays apoptosis (45Rubel C. Fernández G.C. Dran G. Bompadre M.B. Isturiz M.A. Palermo M.S. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 2002-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The biological significance of the Fg-αMβ2 interaction was substantiated in gene-targeted mice expressing Fgγ390–396A, a mutant form of Fg retaining clotting function but lacking the αMβ2 binding motif. Fgγ390–396A mice exhibit a significant diminution in inflammatory disease processes relative to control mice challenged in parallel, including an amelioration in inflammatory joint disease (5Flick M.J. LaJeunesse C.M. Talmage K.E. Witte D.P. Palumbo J.S. Pinkerton M.D. Thornton S. Degen J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 3224-3235Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and diminished inflammatory demyelination in the CNS and retained motor function in the context of autoimmune encephalomyelitis (6Adams R.A. Bauer J. Flick M.J. Sikorski S.L. Nuriel T. Lassmann H. Degen J.L. Akassoglou K. J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204: 571-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Similarly, in a mouse model of S. aureus peritonitis, Fgγ390–396A showed an impaired bacterial clearance (7Flick M.J. Du X. Witte D.P. Jirousková M. Soloviev D.A. Busuttil S.J. Plow E.F. Degen J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 1596-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The ability of Efb to block neutrophil adherence to Fg could have an effect on the inflammatory response similar to that seen in the Fg mutant mice.Adhesion of neutrophils to immobilized Fg and fibrin is primarily an αMβ2-dependent process (32Solovjov D.A. Pluskota E. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1336-1345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 44Languino L.R. Plescia J. Duperray A. Brian A.A. Plow E.F. Geltosky J.E.

Med. 2001; 193: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that the binding of Efb to Fg effectively blocks αMβ2 binding to Fg and strongly impedes neutrophil adhesion to Fg. However, this effect is not the consequence of a direct competition between Efb and αMβ2 for the same binding sites in Fg (Fig. 8, C and D) because (a) Efb binds equally well to WT Fg and Fgγ390–396A and (b) synthetic Fg peptides representing the αMβ2 binding site(s) do not affect the Efb/Fg interaction. Efb binding is also not dependent on the C-terminal five amino acids of the Fg γ chain (residues 407–411) that are known to support binding to the platelet integrin receptor αIIbβ3 (49Holmbäck K. Danton M.J. Suh T.T. Daugherty C.C. Degen J.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5760-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). A mutant form of mouse Fg (termed FgγΔ5) that lacks these last five residues (49Holmbäck K. Danton M.J. Suh T.T. Daugherty C.C. Degen J.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5760-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) is still recognized by Efb (data not shown). The mechanism by which Efb binding to Fg blocks the Fg-αMβ2 interaction remains to be defined, but two potential mechanisms explaining the observed indirect inhibition are as follows: (a) binding of Efb to Fg causes a structural rearrangement within Fg, making the αMβ2 binding site(s) inaccessible or non-functional, or (b) Efb binds in the vicinity of the αMβ2 binding site and sterically blocks the accessibility of αMβ2 to its binding site. The Efb-binding site(s) was located to the D fragment of Fg, but we have not further defined the site. Previously, the Fg Aα chain was proposed to interact with Efb using a far Western blot assay (50Palma M. Shannon O. Quezada H.C. Berg A. Flock J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31691-31697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar); however, our attempts to locate an Efb binding site to a specific Fg chain using the same methods were unsuccessful and possibly hampered by a requirement for the native fibrinogen protein fold for high affinity binding to Efb. We believe that defining the crystal structure of the D fragment in complex with the Efb peptide will best reveal the molecular details of this intriguing interaction, and we have initiated these studies.In this study, we identified two sequences, Efb-A and Efb-O, within the Efb-N segment, that bind Fg. The two binding sites interact with Fg individually with significantly different affinity. The results from the competition ELISA assay and ITC demonstrate that Efb-O is the major binding site. This observation raises the question of whether two Fg-binding sites are both needed to fully support the biological function of Efb in vivo. Further investigation will yield better insight into this complex mechanism of binding and reveal how a microbial protein can interact with a host molecule to circumvent a host defense mechanism. Furthermore, our studies confirm that Efb-C does not bind Fg, which is consistent with our previous study (25Lee L.Y. Liang X. Höök M. Brown E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50710-50716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) but is at odds with the report of Palma et al. (29Palma M. Wade D. Flock M. Flock J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13177-13181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).Fg binding and aggregation induced by bacterial protein binding is a critical component of the virulence strategy used by streptococcal M protein, a potent anti-phagocytic molecule (11McArthur J.D. Walker M.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Fg aggregated by M protein activates neutrophils and induces vascular leakage and lung damage (10Herwald H. Cramer H. Mörgelin M. Russell W. Sollenberg U. Norrby-Teglund A. Flodgaard H. Lindbom L. Björck L.

Lindbom L. Eur. Respir. J. 2008; 32: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Moreover, Fg·M protein complexes were identified in tissue lesions of patients with necrotizing fasciitis and toxic shock syndrome (10Herwald H. Cramer H. Mörgelin M. Russell W. Sollenberg U. Norrby-Teglund A. Flodgaard H. Lindbom L. Björck L. Cell. 2004; 116: 367-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), consistent with a pathogenic significance of the Fg· bacterial protein complex in the disease process. Also, the staphylococcal Fg-binding proteins Coa (coagulase) and vWbp (von Willebrand factor-binding protein) were recently shown to act as virulence factors in a mouse model of abscess formation, and Fg was co-localized with Coa and vWbp proteins in the abscess lesions (52Cheng A.G. McAdow M. Kim H.K. Bae T. Missiakas D.M. Schneewind O. PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1001036Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The precise role of Efb in the pathogenesis of S. aureus infection and the contribution of the Efb-Fg interaction to virulence is not understood. Efb was previously shown to act as a virulence factor in a wound infection model (24Palma M. Nozohoor S. Schennings T. Heimdahl A. Flock J.I. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 5284-5289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, the mechanisms of action remain unclear. Our observation that Efb, like streptococcal M protein, can aggregate Fg raises the possibility that the two proteins use similar virulence strategies.In conclusion, Efb is a powerful evader of human host defense systems. Efb not only blocks neutrophil recruitment to the site of infection by inhibiting C5a generation (21Jongerius I. Köhl J. Pandey M.K. Ruyken M. van Kessel K.P. van Strijp J.A. Rooijakkers S.H. J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204: 2461-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), it also inhibits activation of the adaptive immune system by preventing C3d from binding to CR2 (27Ricklin D. Ricklin-Lichtsteiner S.K. Markiewski M.M. Geisbrecht B.V. Lambris J.D. J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 7463-7467Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Here we show that Efb also effectively inhibits Fg-neutrophil interactions in vitro, and this property may serve the interest of the microbe by impeding neutrophil transmigration and/or impeding fibrin-supported neutrophil activation, resulting in an ineffective antimicrobial response in vivo. IntroductionFibrinogen (Fg) 2The abbreviations used are: Fg, fibrinogen, Fg-D and Fg-E, D fragment and E fragment, respectively, of Fg; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; SPR, surface plasmon resonance. is an acute phase plasma protein that is the fundamental building block of insoluble fibrin clots and is understood to play an important role in hemostasis and inflammatory processes (1Herrick S.

Here we showed that a C. albicans tps1Δ mutant, which is deficient in trehalose synthesis, exhibited increased apoptosis rate upon H2O2 treatment together with an increase of intracellular Ca2+ level and caspase activity. When the intracellular Ca2+ level was stimulated by adding CaCl2 or A23187, both the apoptosis rate and caspase activity were increased. In contrast, the presence of two calcium chelators, EGTA and BAPTA, could attenuate these effects. Moreover, we investigated the role of Ca2+ pathway in C. albicans apoptosis and found that both calcineurin and the calcineurin-dependent transcription factor, Crz1p, mutants showed decreased apoptosis and caspase activity upon H2O2 treatment compared to the wild-type cells. Expression of CaMCA1, the only gene found encoding a C. albicans metacaspase, in calcineurin-deleted or Crz1p-deleted cells restored the cell sensitivity to H2O2. Our results suggest that Ca2+ and its downstream calcineurin/Crz1p/CaMCA1 pathway are involved in H2O2 -induced C. albicans apoptosis. Inhibition of this pathway might be the mechanism for the protective role of trehalose in C. albicans."

Before being cleaved into smaller fibrillogenic fragments the protein undergoes processing by proprotein convertases, a class of serine proteases that typically recognize the canonical motif RX(R/K)R↓. The current model of Pmel17 maturation states that this processing step occurs in melanosomes, but in light of recent reports this issue has become controversial. We therefore addressed this question by thoroughly assessing the processing kinetics of either wild-type Pmel17 or a secreted soluble Pmel17 derivative. Our results demonstrate clearly that processing of Pmel17 occurs during secretion and that it does not require entry of the protein into the endocytic system. Strikingly, processing proceeds even in the presence of the secretion inhibitor monensin, suggesting that Pmel17 is an exceptionally good substrate. In line with this, we find that newly synthesized surface Pmel17 is already quantitatively cleaved. Moreover, we demonstrate that Pmel17 function is independent of the sequence identity of its unconventional proprotein convertase-cleavage motif that lacks arginine in P4 position. The data alter the current view of Pmel17 maturation and suggest that the multistep processing of Pmel17 begins with an early cleavage during secretion that primes the protein for later functional processing.

https://openalex.org/W2038687884,"The “oscillation hypothesis” has been proposed as a general explanation for the exceptional diversification of herbivorous insect species. The hypothesis states that speciation rates are elevated through repeated correlated changes – oscillations – in degree of host plant specificity and geographic range. The aim of this study is to test one of the predictions from the oscillation hypothesis: a positive correlation between diet breadth (number of host plants used) and geographic range size, using the globally distributed butterfly subfamily Nymphalinae. Data on diet breadth and global geographic range were collected for 182 Nymphalinae butterflies species and the size of the geographic range was measured using a GIS. We tested both diet breadth and geographic range size for phylogenetic signal to see if species are independent of each other with respect to these characters. As this test gave inconclusive results, data was analysed both using cross-species comparisons and taking phylogeny into account using generalised estimating equations as applied in the APE package in R. Irrespective of which method was used, we found a significant positive correlation between diet breadth and geographic range size. These results are consistent for two different measures of diet breadth and removal of outliers. We conclude that the global range sizes of Nymphalinae butterflies are correlated to diet breadth. That is, butterflies that feed on a large number of host plants tend to have larger geographic ranges than do butterflies that feed on fewer plants. These results lend support for an important step in the oscillation hypothesis of plant-driven diversification, in that it can provide the necessary fuel for future population fragmentation and speciation."
https://openalex.org/W2063024892,"CD4+ helper T cells are critical orchestrators of immune responses to infection and vaccination. During primary responses, naïve CD8+ T cells may need “CD4 help” for optimal development of memory populations. The immunological factors attributed to CD4 help depend on the context of immunization and vary depending on the priming system. In response to immunization with radiation-attenuated Plasmodium yoelii sporozoites, CD8+ T cells in BALB/c mice fail to generate large numbers of effector cells without help from CD4+ T cells – a defect not observed in most systems. Given this unique early dependence on CD4 help, we evaluated the effects of CD4+ cells on the development of functional properties of CD8+ T cells and on their ability to abolish infection. First, we determined that this effect was not mediated by CD4+ non-T cells and did not involve CD1d-restricted NKT cells. We found that CD8+ T cells induced by sporozoites without CD4 help formed memory populations severely reduced in magnitude that could not limit parasite development in the liver. The inability of these “helpless” memory T cells to protect is not a result of defects in effector function, as their capacity to produce cytokines and undergo cytotoxic degranulation was indistinguishable from control memory T cells. These data indicate that CD4+ T help may not be necessary to develop the functional attributes of CD8+ T cells; however they are crucial to ensure the survival of effector and memory cells induced in primary responses."
https://openalex.org/W2084001067,"IL-23, produced by dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, plays a critical role in innate immunity against bacterial infection. Our previous studies show that morphine disrupts the IL-23/IL-17 mediated pulmonary mucosal host defense and increases susceptibility to Streptococcus pneumoniae lung infection. To determine the mechanism by which morphine modulates IL-23 production, mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and macrophages (BMDMs) were treated with morphine, and infected with S. pneumoniae or stimulated with Toll-like receptor (TLR) and Nod2 ligands. We found that a significant increase in IL-23 protein production was observed in S. pneumoniae, TLR2 ligand lipoteichoic acid (LTA), and TLR4 ligand pneumolysin (PLY) stimulated BMDCs and BMDMs. Interestingly, although Nod2 ligand muramyldipeptide (MDP) alone had no effect on IL-23 production, it potentiated LTA induced IL-23 production to the same level as that observed following S. pneumoniae infection, suggesting that S. pneumoniae induced IL-23 production in DCs involves activation of both TLR2 and Nod2 signaling mechanisms. Furthermore, pretreatment of DCs with MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88) and IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) 1/4 inhibitors, or TLR2 antibody diminished the S. pneumoniae induced IL-23 and abolished the inhibitory effects of morphine, indicating that S. pneumoniae induced IL-23 production depends on activation of the TLR2-MyD88-IRAK1/4 signaling pathway. Moreover, morphine decreased S. pneumoniae induced phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and activating transcription factor 2 in DCs. Taken together, our study shows that morphine impairs S. pneumoniae induced IL-23 production through MyD88-IRAK1/4-dependent TLR2 and Nod2 signaling in DCs."
https://openalex.org/W1994392323,"Background Several genetic and environmental factors have been linked to Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). One environmental trigger that has a strong association with SLE is the Epstein Barr Virus (EBV). Our laboratory previously demonstrated that BALB/c mice expressing the complete EBNA-1 protein can develop antibodies to double stranded DNA (dsDNA). The present study was undertaken to understand why anti-dsDNA antibodies arise during the immune response to EBNA-1. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we demonstrated that mouse antibodies elicited in response to EBNA-1 cross-react with dsDNA. First, we showed that adsorption of sera reactive with EBNA-1 and dsDNA, on dsDNA cellulose columns, diminished reactivity with EBNA-1. Next, we generated mononclonal antibodies (MAbs) to EBNA-1 and showed, by several methods, that they also reacted with dsDNA. Examination of two cross-reactive MAbs—3D4, generated in this laboratory, and 0211, a commercial MAb—revealed that 3D4 recognizes the carboxyl region of EBNA-1, while 0211 recognizes both the amino and carboxyl regions. In addition, 0211 binds moderately well to the ribonucleoprotein, Sm, which has been reported by others to elicit a cross-reactive response with EBNA-1, while 3D4 binds only weakly to Sm. This suggests that the epitope in the carboxyl region may be more important for cross-reactivity with dsDNA while the epitope in the amino region may be more important for cross-reactivity with Sm. Conclusions/Significance In conclusion, our results demonstrate that antibodies to the EBNA-1 protein cross-react with dsDNA. This study is significant because it demonstrates a direct link between the viral antigen and the development of anti-dsDNA antibodies, which are the hallmark of SLE. Furthermore, it illustrates the crucial need to identify the epitopes in EBNA-1 responsible for this cross-reactivity so that therapeutic strategies can be designed to mask these regions from the immune system following EBV exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2021858062,"Individuals of gregarious species that initiate collective movement require mechanisms of cohesion in order to maintain advantages of group living. One fundamental question in the study of collective movement is what individual rules are employed when making movement decisions. Previous studies have revealed that group movements often depend on social interactions among individual members and specifically that collective decisions to move often follow a quorum-like response. However, these studies either did not quantify the response function at the individual scale (but rather tested hypotheses based on group-level behaviours), or they used a single group size and did not demonstrate which social stimuli influence the individual decision-making process. One challenge in the study of collective movement has been to discriminate between a common response to an external stimulus and the synchronization of behaviours resulting from social interactions. Here we discriminate between these two mechanisms by triggering the departure of one trained Merino sheep (Ovis aries) from groups containing one, three, five and seven naïve individuals. Each individual was thus exposed to various combinations of already-departed and non-departed individuals, depending on its rank of departure. To investigate which individual mechanisms are involved in maintaining group cohesion under conditions of leadership, we quantified the temporal dynamic of response at the individual scale. We found that individuals' decisions to move do not follow a quorum response but rather follow a rule based on a double mimetic effect: attraction to already-departed individuals and attraction to non-departed individuals. This rule is shown to be in agreement with an adaptive strategy that is inherently scalable as a function of group size."

New findings concerning the mechanisms of G6PD deficient red cell destruction may facilitate our understanding of the large individual variations in susceptibility to pro-oxidant compounds and aid the prediction of the hemolytic activity of new drugs.Our results show that treatment of G6PD deficient red cells with diamide (0.25 mM) or divicine (0.5 mM) causes: (1) an increase in the oxidation and tyrosine phosphorylation of AE1; (2) progressive recruitment of phosphorylated AE1 in large membrane complexes which also contain hemichromes; (3) parallel red cell lysis and a massive release of vesicles containing hemichromes. We have observed that inhibition of AE1 phosphorylation by Syk kinase inhibitors prevented its clustering and the membrane vesiculation while increases in AE1 phosphorylation by tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors increased both red cell lysis and vesiculation rates. In control RBCs we observed only transient AE1 phosphorylation.Collectively, our findings indicate that persistent tyrosine phosphorylation produces extensive membrane destabilization leading to the loss of vesicles which contain hemichromes. The proposed mechanism of hemolysis may be applied to other hemolytic diseases characterized by the accumulation of hemoglobin denaturation products."
https://openalex.org/W2085196918,"Unlike some organs, the heart is unable to repair itself after injury. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) grow and divide indefinitely while maintaining the potential to develop into many tissues of the body. As such, they provide an unprecedented opportunity to treat human diseases characterized by tissue loss. We have identified early myocardial precursors derived from hESCs (hMPs) using an α-myosin heavy chain (αMHC)-GFP reporter line. We have demonstrated by immunocytochemistry and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) that reporter activation is restricted to hESC-derived cardiomyocytes (CMs) differentiated in vitro, and that hMPs give rise exclusively to muscle in an in vivo teratoma formation assay. We also demonstrate that the reporter does not interfere with hESC genomic stability. Importantly, we show that hMPs give rise to atrial, ventricular and specialized conduction CM subtypes by qPCR and microelectrode array analysis. Expression profiling of hMPs over the course of differentiation implicate Wnt and transforming growth factor-β signaling pathways in CM development. The identification of hMPs using this αMHC-GFP reporter line will provide important insight into the pathways regulating human myocardial development, and may provide a novel therapeutic reagent for the treatment of cardiac disease."

Biochemical studies and structural modeling suggest that DCN1 functions as an E3 promoting neddylation by reducing nonspecific Rub1 (Nedd8 in mammals) discharge and directing the active site of Ubc12 toward the acceptor lysine in Cdc53 (Cul1 in mammals) (31Scott D.C.

These observations suggest that SCCRO is a nonessential component of the neddylation E3 complex that increases efficiency of the reaction. In contrast to in vitro observations, in vivo studies suggest that SCCRO has an essential role in neddylation, as knocking out SCCRO orthologs DCN1/Dcn1p in Caenorhabditis elegans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae results in reduced Cul3 neddylation and lethality (30Kurz T.

Our work shows that although SCCRO−/− mice are viable, neddylation is reduced, and these mice have several developmental defects including male specific infertility, runting, and high rates of perinatal mortality. 5A. J. Kaufman, G. Huang, R. Ryan, L. Huryn, G. Hunnicut, Y. Romin, P. Morris, K. Manora, Y. Ramanathan, and B. Singh, unpublished data. In this work we show that in addition to assembling the neddylation E3 complex, SCCRO facilitates the subcellular localization of neddylation components, which is required for cullin neddylation in vivo. These findings help to explain the differential requirement for SCCRO in in vitro and in vivo models.DISCUSSIONInasmuch as mechanisms are highly conserved, conjugation of Ub and Ub-like protein also share factors regulating reaction dynamics (38Capili A.D. Lima C.D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2007; 17: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 39Dye B.T. Schulman B.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2007; 36: 131-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The rate-limiting step in Ub and Ub-like protein conjugation is E3 activity. Regulation of E3 activity is most closely regulated for ubiquitination by CRL-type ligases and neddylation of cullins. In both reactions, the RING domain in Roc1 provides the enzymatic activity, and assembly of the complex serves as the rate-limiting step. Although the presence of Roc1 along with charged E2 is sufficient in vitro, other factors are involved in in vivo ligation activity (4Wu K. Chen A. Tan P. Pan Z.Q. J. Biol.

For CRL complexes, activation of E3 requires neddylation of the cullin in vivo, but can proceed without cullin neddylation in vitro (5Read M.A. Brownell J.E. Gladysheva T.B. Hottelet M. Parent L.A.

Prior studies show that neddylation affects CRL activity by promoting assembly of the complex through recruitment and positioning of the E2 to allow Ub transfer and chain extension on the substrate protein (8Kawakami T. Chiba T. Suzuki T. Iwai K. Yamanaka K. Minato N. Suzuki H. Shimbara N. Hidaka Y. Osaka F. Omata M. Tanaka K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4003-4012Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 42Duda D.M.

Combined, our findings that SCCRO recruits E2 and the work of Scott et al. showing that it promotes a favorable orientation for efficient Nedd8 transfer suggest that SCCRO affects the activity of neddylation E3 complexes as neddylation does for cullins in CRL complexes.Although this defines the biochemical role of neddylation and SCCRO in the respective E3 activity, it fails to explain why neddylation and SCCRO are required in vivo but not in vitro for Ub and Nedd8 conjugation, respectively. Our laboratory, as well as others, have shown that neddylation of cullins can occur efficiently in vitro in the absence of SCCRO (27Kim A.Y. Bommeljé C.C. Lee B.E. Yonekawa Y. Choi L. Morris L.G.

This would suggest that the role of SCCRO may not be essential. However, decreased neddylation combined with the detrimental effects of knocking out SCCRO in in vivo model organisms suggest that its function is required (30Kurz T. Ozlü N. Rudolf F. O'Rourke S.M. Luke B. Hofmann K. Hyman A.A. Bowerman B. Peter M. Nature. 2005; 435: 1257-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Our findings help to explain this difference by showing that SCCRO promotes nuclear translocation of Cul1-Roc1 complexes in vivo. We found that Ubc12 exists almost exclusively in the nucleus (supplemental Fig. 3). Accordingly, for neddylation to occur, Ubc12 either has to be translocated to cytoplasm or Cullin-Roc1 complexes to the nucleus. The importance of nuclear transport is supported by the finding that NLS-Cul1, but not wild-type Cul1, can be neddylated by the expression of Ubc12 alone. However, even after nuclear localization of Cul1 by tagging with NLS, co-expression of SCCRO with Ubc12 synergistically enhances neddylation, at levels much higher that that seen in vitro. These observations may be explained by enhanced recruitment of Ubc12 to Cul1-Roc1 by SCCRO in vivo.Our findings raise several possibilities and questions. As the SCCRO-Cul1-Roc1 complex is relatively large, it requires active transport through a nuclear pore. However, none of the proteins in the complex contains a canonical nuclear targeting sequence. Although it is possible that a cryptic nuclear targeting sequence may be present, it is also possible that other unidentified proteins/factors may be involved in nuclear translocation. Second, given the conservation in reaction dynamics, these findings raise the possibility that CRL activity may also be regulated by compartmentalization. Interestingly, in our preliminary studies we found that neddylated cullins primarily exist in the nucleus, raising the possibility of ubiquitination occurring in the nucleus (supplemental Fig. 4). These findings need to be reconciled with reports suggesting SCCRO3 acts at the membrane to promote neddylation (44Meyer-Schaller N. Chou Y.C. Sumara I. Martin D.D. Kurz T. Katheder N. Hofmann K. Berthiaume L.G. Sicheri F. Peter M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 12365-12370Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Similar to work from Ma et al. (45Ma T. Shi T. Huang J. Wu L. Hu F. He P. Deng W. Gao P. Zhang Y. Song Q. Ma D. Qiu X. Cancer Sci. 2008; 99: 2128-2135Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we found that SCCRO3 functions as a tumor suppressor in human cancers rather than an oncogene like other SCCRO family members. 6C. Stock, G. Huang, V. Weeda, C. Bommelije, K. Shah, S. Bains, E. Buss, Y. Ramanathan, and B. Singh, unpublished data. Our results suggest that SCCRO3 binds to Cul1 in vivo but has no independent neddylation activity, suggesting that its function may be context-dependent in vivo. Finally, as SCCRO4/DCUN1D4 and SCCRO5/DCUN1D5 both have a functional NLS in their N terminus, their role in neddylation remains to be explained.

https://openalex.org/W2069548535,"One striking feature of chromatin organization is that chromosomes are compartmentalized into distinct territories during interphase, the degree of intermingling being much smaller than expected for linear chains. A growing body of evidence indicates that the formation of loops plays a dominant role in transcriptional regulation as well as the entropic organization of interphase chromosomes. Using a recently proposed model, we quantitatively determine the entropic forces between chromosomes. This Dynamic Loop Model assumes that loops form solely on the basis of diffusional motion without invoking other long-range interactions. We find that introducing loops into the structure of chromatin results in a multi-fold higher repulsion between chromosomes compared to linear chains. Strong effects are observed for the tendency of a non-random alignment; the overlap volume between chromosomes decays fast with increasing loop number. Our results suggest that the formation of chromatin loops imposes both compartmentalization as well as order on the system without requiring additional energy-consuming processes."
https://openalex.org/W2083257789,"Background A recent study reported that the fatness associated A-allele of FTO rs9939609 increased plasma high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels independent of fatness. We aimed to investigate if this gene variant had fatness-independent effects on plasma hs-CRP and 10 additional circulating obesity-related adipokines throughout a broad range of body mass index (BMI) among Danish men. Methodology/Principal Findings In a population of 362,200 young men, examined for military service between 1943 and 1977, two groups were identified: 1) a random 1% sample and 2) all obese men (BMI = 31.0 kg/m2, all of whom were above the 99th percentile of this population). At an average age of 49 years (range: 39 through 65 years), 551 men, hereof 231 of the obese, were re-examined, including genotyping and measurement of the fasting circulating inflammatory markers hs-CRP, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-18, mip1α, mip1β, sTNFα-R1, TGF-β, TNF-α and leptin. Men with known disease were excluded from the examination. All the inflammatory markers were log-transformed to approximate a normal distribution. Genotype-phenotype relationships were studied using linear regression analyses with the inflammatory markers as the response variable. Significant positive associations between hs-CRP, leptin and a broad range of BMI were observed, but the associations did not significantly differ across FTO rs9939609 genotype. There were no significant associations between the other inflammatory markers, FTO rs9939609 genotype or BMI, respectively. Conclusion No fatness-independent effects of the FTO rs9939609 A-allele on a series of inflammatory markers were observed in this cohort of healthy middle-aged men representing a broad range of fatness."

The complement system constitutes an important arm of innate immune defenses against invasive meningococcal infection. Persons deficient in terminal complement components (C5 through C9) or components of the alternative pathway (such as properdin and factor D) are highly predisposed to meningococcal disease (6Alper C.A.

Dis. 1989; 21: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Deficiencies of inhibitors of the complement system such as factor H and factor I also predispose individuals to meningococcal disease because lack of complement inhibition in plasma leads to uncontrolled C3 activation and consumption (12Figueroa J.E. Densen P. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 4: 359-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 21Reis E.S. Falcão D.A. Isaac L. Scand. J. Immunol. 2006; 63: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Epidemiologic data suggest that persons with deficiencies of properdin or terminal complement components may be more predisposed to disease caused by groups W-135 and Y and other rare serogroups (13Fijen C.A. Kuijper E.J. Hannema A.J. Sjöholm A.G. van Putten J.P. Lancet. 1989; 2: 585-588Abstract PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 14Fijen C.A. Kuijper E.J. te Bulte M.T. Daha M.R. Dankert J. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1999; 28: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Why certain serogroups of N. meningitidis are overrepresented in persons with complement deficiencies is not fully understood. Several microbes express capsular polysaccharides as part of their virulence armamentarium. In general, capsules are believed to limit complement activation on the microbial surface and are anti-opsonophagocytic (22Taylor C.M. Roberts I.S. Contrib. Microbiol. 2005; 12: 55-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Prior studies have shown that expression of group B and C meningococcal capsules limit alternative pathway-mediated C3 deposition on the bacterial surface (23Jarvis G.A. Vedros N.A. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 174-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Uria M.J. Zhang Q. Li Y. Chan A. Exley R.M. Gollan B. Chan H. Feavers I. Yarwood A. Abad R. Borrow R. Fleck R.A. Mulloy B. Vazquez J.A. Tang C.M. J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205: 1423-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The capsules of both of these serogroups are homopolymers of sialic acid. The group B capsule is composed of α(2,8)-, whereas the group C capsule is composed of α(2,9)-linked polysialic acid. Other sialic acid containing capsules such as the capsular polysaccharide of type III group B streptococci have also been shown to limit alternative pathway activation (25Edwards M.S. Kasper D.L. Jennings H.J. Baker C.J. Nicholson-Weller A. J. Immunol. 1982; 128: 1278-1283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of group B streptococci, the tertiary structure of the capsule, which is dependent upon the negative charge of the carboxylate residue of sialic acid, limits activation of the alternative pathway. However, the molecular basis of alternative pathway regulation by meningococcal group B and C capsules has not been elucidated. To our knowledge, there are no published data on regulation of the alternative pathway by the other clinically important meningococcal capsular polysaccharides (A, W-135, and Y). The serogroup A polysaccharide is a homopolymer of N-acetylmannosamine 1-phosphate, and serogroup W-135 and Y capsules comprise disaccharide repeating units of 6-d-Galα(1,4)-NANAα(2,6)- and 6-d-Glcα(1,4)-NANAα(2,6)-, respectively (1Frosch M. Vogel U. Frosch M. Maiden M.C.J. Handbook of Meningococcal Disease. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany2006: 145-162Google Scholar). The polysaccharides of serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y are also variably O-acetylated (26Claus H. Borrow R. Achtman M. Morelli G. Kantelberg C. Longworth E. Frosch M. Vogel U. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 227-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 27Gudlavalleti S.K. Datta A.K. Tzeng Y.L. Noble C. Carlson R.W. Stephens D.S. J. Biol.

The purpose of this study was to examine how capsular polysaccharides from each the five major meningococcal serogroups interact with the alternative pathway of complement to better understand differences in the pathophysiology among the various serogroups. N. meningitidis strains and their isogenic mutants used in this study are listed in Table 1. The mutant strain pairs differ in capsular polysaccharide expression; all mutant strains lacked lipooligosaccharide (LOS) 2The abbreviations used are: LOSlipooligosaccharideHBSSHanks' balanced salt solutionCapcapsuleNHSnormal human serumfHbpfactor H-binding proteinNspANeisserial surface protein ABisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. sialic acid (group A meningococcal strains do not endogenously sialylate their LOS) and fHbp and NspA expression; these outer membrane components regulate the alternative pathway of complement and were excluded to avoid confounding of results that examined alternative pathway regulation by encapsulated bacteria (28Estabrook M.M.

To selectively study the alternative pathway we used either C2-depleted serum (lot number 16; Complement Technology, Inc.) or normal human serum (NHS) that contained MgCl2 and EGTA (both to a final concentration of 10 mm; Mg/EGTA-NHS). Preliminary experiments showed that C3 fragment deposition on bacteria using C2-depleted serum or Mg/EGTA-NHS were similar. When necessary, all complement pathways were inactivated by heating serum at 56 °C for 30 min. For some experiments, IgG and IgM were depleted from serum as follows. NHS that contained EDTA (final concentration 10 mm) was passed over protein G-Sepharose and anti-human IgM-agarose (both from Sigma) in tandem at 4 °C. The fall-through was spin concentrated and dialyzed against PBS containing 0.1 mm EDTA to its original volume. Depletion of IgG and IgM was confirmed by Western blotting and hemolytic activity of the serum that was reconstituted with 1 mm Ca2+ and 1 mm Mg2+ was confirmed with the Total Hemolytic Complement assay (Binding Site, Birmingham, United Kingdom). mAb G-3E that recognizes the 68-kDa α1′ chain of iC3b (33Iida K.

Dis. 1999; 179: 124-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) was used to detect iC3b targets on bacteria in Western blotting assays and to measure iC3b deposited on immobilized capsular polysaccharide. Factor H bound to bacteria was detected by flow cytometry with sheep polyclonal anti-human factor H (Lifespan Biosciences). Anti-group A mAb JW-A-1 (IgG2a), anti-group C mAb KS-C-1 (IgG3), anti-group W-135 mAb JW-W1b (IgG2b), and anti-group Y mAb JW-Y2a (IgM) were provided by Drs. Dan M. Granoff (Childrens Hospital Oakland Research Institute, Oakland, CA) and Jo Anne Welsch (Novartis Vaccines), whereas anti-group B mAb 2-2-B (IgM) was obtained from the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, UK). Chicken polyclonal anti-human C3d that recognizes the α chain of C3 (∼115 kDa), α′ chain (∼106 kDa) of C3b, α1′ chain of iC3b (∼68 kDa), C3d and C3dg was from Quidel (San Diego; catalogue number A800). mAb 755 is a directed epitope spanned by amino acids 1499 and 1519 of the C3 amino acid sequence (SwissProt data base, accession no. P01024) and therefore recognizes the α′ chain (∼106 kDa) of C3b and the α2′ fragment (∼40 kDa) of iC3b (35Vogel U. Weinberger A. Frank R. Müller A. Köhl J. Atkinson J.P. Frosch M. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 4022-4029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All secondary antibodies (alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, anti-mouse IgM and anti-chicken IgY, and anti-sheep IgG-FITC) were from Sigma. Purified serogroup A, C, W-135, and Y meningococcal capsular polysaccharides were obtained from the National Institutes Biological Standards and Controls (NIBSC, Porton Down, Salisbury, UK). Serogroup B meningococcal capsular polysaccharide was the kind gift of Dr. Jo Anne Welsch (Novartis Vaccines). Methylated human albumin (NIBSC) was used to bind capsular polysaccharides to microtiter wells (see below). Flow cytometry to detect factor H bound to bacteria was performed as described previously (29Lewis L.A. Ngampasutadol J. Wallace R. Reid J.E. Vogel U. Ram S. PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1001027Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Briefly, bacteria grown overnight on chocolate agar plates were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing 1 mm Ca2+ and 1 mm Mg2+ (HBSS2+) and suspended to a final concentration of 3 × 108 cells/ml; 108 organisms were centrifuged and incubated with factor H purified from human plasma (Complement Technology, Inc.) at 20 μg/ml. Bound factor H was detected using affinity-isolated sheep anti-human factor H (Lifespan Biosciences, Seattle, WA) followed by FITC-labeled anti-sheep IgG (Sigma). To detect binding of purified capsular polysaccharide to unencapsulated bacteria, bacteria as prepared above were suspended in HBSS2+ and incubated separately with each purified capsular polysaccharide to a final concentration of 125 μg/ml for 10 min at 37 °C. Capsule bound to bacteria was detected by FACS using the respective mAb against capsule at a concentration of 10 μg/ml (with the exception of anti-group B capsular mAb 2-2-B that was provided as lyophilized ascites and used at a 1:100 dilution), followed by the appropriate FITC-labeled secondary antibody at a concentration of 1:100 (Sigma). Western blotting to detect C3 fragments deposited on meningococci was performed as described previously (36Lewis L.A. Ram S. Prasad A. Gulati S. Getzlaff S. Blom A.M. Vogel U. Rice P.A. Infect. Immun. 2008; 76: 339-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 108 bacteria suspended in HBSS2+ were incubated with C2-depleted serum (final concentration 25% (v/v)) in a final reaction volume of 80 μl for 10 or 30 min at 37 °C. Bacteria were washed twice in HBSS2+ and lysed in NuPAGE® LDS Sample Buffer (4X) (Invitrogen) containing 10% 2-mercaptoethanol. In some experiments, the bacteria were divided into two aliquots treated either with buffer alone (C3 fragments bound to its targets through ester and amide linkages are left intact) or methylamine, pH 11, at a concentration of 1 m (to selectively disrupt ester bonds, but leave amide bonds intact), for 1 h at 37 °C. Direct determination of the specific amide-bound C3b/iC3b is not possible, because it cannot be separated intact from acceptor surfaces without altering its primary structure. Proteins were separated on NuPAGE Novex 4–12% BisTris gradient gels using NuPAGE MOPS running buffer (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA) by Western blotting. iC3b was detected using mAb G-3E (tissue culture supernatants containing ∼20 μg/ml of mAb diluted 1:4 in TBS) that recognizes a neoepitope in the α1′ chain of iC3b, followed by goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. To reduce viscosity of bacterial lysates caused by DNA, in some experiments serum-coated bacteria were osmotically lysed by incubation for 15 min in ddH2O at 37 °C, followed by treatment with DNase I (50 units; Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37 °C. Addition of NuPAGE® LDS Sample Buffer (4X) and electrophoresis was performed as described above. Activation of C3 is accompanied by release of the C3a fragment from the N terminus of the α chain of C3 into the fluid phase. 1 × 108 bacteria were suspended in 60 μl HBSS2+, followed by the addition of 20 μl of C2-depleted serum (final serum concentration in the reaction mixture was 25%). Aliquots were obtained at sequential time points and reactions were stopped by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 20 mm. C3a released by activation of C3 in the reaction mixture was measured in serial dilutions of the EDTA-inactivated reaction mixtures using the MicroVue C3a Plus EIA kit (Quidel Corp., San Diego, CA). The concentration of C3a in the reaction mixtures was calculated using OD values that fell within the linear range of the standard curve of the EIA kit. Methylated human albumin was used to bind capsular polysaccharide to microtiter wells as described previously (37Carlone G.M. Frasch C.E. Siber G.R. Quataert S. Gheesling L.L. Turner S.H. Plikaytis B.D. Helsel L.O. DeWitt W.E. Bibb W.F. et al.J. Clin. Microbiol. 1992; 30: 154-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, each capsular polysaccharide (10 μg/ml in 10 mm PBS) was mixed with methylated human albumin (10 μg/ml in 10 mm PBS) at a 1:1 ratio and mixtures were used to coat individual microtiter wells for 15 h at 22 °C. Wells were blocked with PBS, 2% BSA for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by addition of 20% Mg/EGTA-NHS (alternative pathway specific) for 1 h at 37 °C. Heat inactivated Mg/EGTA-NHS (20%) was used as a control. Factor H and factor I present in serum convert bound C3b to iC3b. iC3b was detected using tissue culture supernatant that contained anti-iC3b mAb G-3E (33Iida K. Mitomo K. Fujita T. Tamura N. Immunology. 1987; 62: 413-417PubMed Google Scholar) followed by anti-mouse IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. Bactericidal assays were performed as described previously (29Lewis L.A. Ngampasutadol J. Wallace R. Reid J.E. Vogel U. Ram S. PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1001027Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 38Shaughnessy J. Lewis L.A. Jarva H. Ram S. Infect. Immun. 2009; 77: 2094-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Bacteria from an overnight culture on chocolate agar plates were inoculated onto fresh chocolate agar and allowed to grow for ∼6 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. C2-depleted serum was used at a final concentration of 50% (v/v) in bactericidal assays. In some instances, purified C2 was added to C2-depleted serum to a final concentration of 40 μg/ml as a control. Briefly, 2000 colony forming units of meningococci were incubated with serum (concentrations specified for each experiment) in a final reaction volume of 150 μl. Aliquots of 25 μl were plated in duplicate at the start of the assay (t0) and after incubating the reaction mixture at 37 °C for 30 min (t30). Survival was calculated as the number of viable colonies at t30 relative to baseline colony counts at t0. Differences between groups of observations were determined using a paired two-tailed t test. To identify the specific role of capsular polysaccharide in modulating alternative pathway activation it was first necessary to eliminate variables known to regulate alternative pathway activation on Neisseriae. These include LOS sialic acid (28Estabrook M.M. Griffiss J.M. Jarvis G.A. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 4436-4444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Vogel U. Claus H. Heinze G. Frosch M. Infect.

Strains representing capsular groups A, B, C, W-135, and Y used in this study lacked LOS sialic acid expression (group A strains do not sialylate LOS and in all other strains the sialyltransferase, lst, was insertionally inactivated) and were also mutated to abrogate fHbp and NspA expression.

Wild-type strain Y2220 expresses very low levels of fHbp and binds barely detectable levels of factor H by flow cytometry, as we have described previously (29Lewis L.A. Ngampasutadol J. Wallace R.

The C3 molecule comprises a 115-kDa α chain that is linked to a 75-kDa β chain through a disulfide bond. Deposition of C3 fragments on the bacterial surface is preceded by activation of C3, during which the ∼9-kDa C3a fragment is cleaved from the N terminus of the 115-kDa α chain of C3 (reviewed in Ref. 42Walport M.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1058-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar). To determine whether capsular polysaccharide expression affected C3 activation by the alternative pathway, we compared C3a generation at 10 and 30 min in reaction mixtures containing C2-depleted serum and either encapsulated organisms (representing each major capsule group) or their isogenic unencapsulated mutant counterparts. Rather surprisingly, at 10 min, Cap+ group W-135 and Y strains generated high amounts of C3a compared with their unencapsulated counterparts (Fig. 2A). At this time point, only small amounts of C3a were generated by all other strains tested. Although the Cap− group B strain generated statistically higher amounts of C3a at 10 min compared with its Cap+ counterpart, the total amount of C3a produced by this strain was ∼5-fold less compared with C3a generated by Cap+ W-135 and Y strains. At 30 min, all strains produced high amounts of C3a and differences between Cap+ and Cap− mutant pairs, with the exception of the group W-135 mutant pair, were not significant (Fig. 2B). Thus, expression of group W-135 or Y capsular polysaccharides was associated with rapid alternative pathway activation, evidenced by high C3a generation at 10 min. However, all strains were activated by C3 through the alternative pathw"
https://openalex.org/W2054666491,"Background The present study investigated whether changes in gene expression in the right ventricle following pulmonary hypertension can be attributed to hypoxia or pressure loading. Methodology/Principal Findings To distinguish hypoxia from pressure-induced alterations, a group of rats underwent banding of the pulmonary trunk (PTB), sham operation, or the rats were exposed to normoxia or chronic, hypobaric hypoxia. Pressure measurements were performed and the right ventricle was analyzed by Affymetrix GeneChip, and selected genes were confirmed by quantitative PCR and immunoblotting. Right ventricular systolic blood pressure and right ventricle to body weight ratio were elevated in the PTB and the hypoxic rats. Expression of the same 172 genes was altered in the chronic hypoxic and PTB rats. Thus, gene expression of enzymes participating in fatty acid oxidation and the glycerol channel were downregulated. mRNA expression of aquaporin 7 was downregulated, but this was not the case for the protein expression. In contrast, monoamine oxidase A and tissue transglutaminase were upregulated both at gene and protein levels. 11 genes (e.g. insulin-like growth factor binding protein) were upregulated in the PTB experiment and downregulated in the hypoxic experiment, and 3 genes (e.g. c-kit tyrosine kinase) were downregulated in the PTB and upregulated in the hypoxic experiment. Conclusion/Significance Pressure load of the right ventricle induces a marked shift in the gene expression, which in case of the metabolic genes appears compensated at the protein level, while both expression of genes and proteins of importance for myocardial function and remodelling are altered by the increased pressure load of the right ventricle. These findings imply that treatment of pulmonary hypertension should also aim at reducing right ventricular pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2094983680,"The interferon-regulated transcription factor and tumor suppressor protein IRF-1 is predicted to be largely disordered outside of the DNA-binding domain. One of the advantages of intrinsically disordered protein domains is thought to be their ability to take part in multiple, specific but low affinity protein interactions; however, relatively few IRF-1-interacting proteins have been described. The recent identification of a functional binding interface for the E3-ubiquitin ligase CHIP within the major disordered domain of IRF-1 led us to ask whether this region might be employed more widely by regulators of IRF-1 function. Here we describe the use of peptide aptamer-based affinity chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry to define a multiprotein binding interface on IRF-1 (Mf2 domain; amino acids 106-140) and to identify Mf2-binding proteins from A375 cells. Based on their function as known transcriptional regulators, a selection of the Mf2 domain-binding proteins (NPM1, TRIM28, and YB-1) have been validated using in vitro and cell-based assays. Interestingly, although NPM1, TRIM28, and YB-1 all bind to the Mf2 domain, they have differing amino acid specificities, demonstrating the degree of combinatorial diversity and specificity available through linear interaction motifs."
https://openalex.org/W2062739692,"Synthetic pyrethroid insecticides have generated public concerns due to their increasing use and potential effects on aquatic ecosystems. A modeling system was developed in this study for simulating the transport processes and associated sediment toxicity of pyrethroids at coupled field/watershed scales. The model was tested in the Orestimba Creek watershed, an agriculturally intensive area in California' Central Valley. Model predictions were satisfactory when compared with measured suspended solid concentration (R2 = 0.536), pyrethroid toxic unit (0.576), and cumulative mortality of Hyalella azteca (0.570). The results indicated that sediment toxicity in the study area was strongly related to the concentration of pyrethroids in bed sediment. Bifenthrin was identified as the dominant contributor to the sediment toxicity in recent years, accounting for 50–85% of predicted toxicity units. In addition, more than 90% of the variation on the annual maximum toxic unit of pyrethroids was attributed to precipitation and prior application of bifenthrin in the late irrigation season. As one of the first studies simulating the dynamics and spatial variability of pyrethroids in fields and instreams, the modeling results provided useful information on new policies to be considered with respect to pyrethroid regulation. This study suggested two potential measures to efficiently reduce sediment toxicity by pyrethroids in the study area: [1] limiting bifenthrin use immediately before rainfall season; and [2] implementing conservation practices to retain soil on cropland."
https://openalex.org/W2088134563,"Aspergillus fumigatus is a filamentous fungus that can cause severe respiratory disease in immunocompromised individuals. A putative sialidase from A. fumigatus was recently cloned and shown to be relatively poor in cleaving N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) in comparison with bacterial sialidases. Here we present the first crystal structure of a fungal sialidase. When the apo structure was compared with bacterial sialidase structures, the active site of the Aspergillus enzyme suggested that Neu5Ac would be a poor substrate because of a smaller pocket that normally accommodates the acetamido group of Neu5Ac in sialidases. A sialic acid with a hydroxyl in place of an acetamido group is 2-keto-3-deoxynononic acid (KDN). We show that KDN is the preferred substrate for the A. fumigatus sialidase and that A. fumigatus can utilize KDN as a sole carbon source. A 1.45-Å resolution crystal structure of the enzyme in complex with KDN reveals KDN in the active site in a boat conformation and nearby a second binding site occupied by KDN in a chair conformation, suggesting that polyKDN may be a natural substrate. The enzyme is not inhibited by the sialidase transition state analog 2-deoxy-2,3-dehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac2en) but is inhibited by the related 2,3-didehydro-2,3-dideoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-nonulosonic acid that we show bound to the enzyme in a 1.84-Å resolution crystal structure. Using a fluorinated KDN substrate, we present a 1.5-Å resolution structure of a covalently bound catalytic intermediate. The A. fumigatus sialidase is therefore a KDNase with a similar catalytic mechanism to Neu5Ac exosialidases, and this study represents the first structure of a KDNase."

https://openalex.org/W2059224923,"Background Despite years of interest in the anti-cancerous effects of cardiac glycosides (CGs), and numerous studies in vitro and in animals, it has not yet been possible to utilize this potential clinically. Reports have demonstrated promising in vitro effects on different targets as well as a possible therapeutic index/selectivity in vitro and in experimental animals. Recently, however, general inhibition of protein synthesis was suggested as the main mechanism of the anti-cancerous effects of CGs. In addition, evidence of species differences of a magnitude sufficient to explain the results of many studies called for reconsideration of earlier results. Principal Findings In this report we identified primary B-precursor and T-ALL cells as being particularly susceptible to the cytotoxic effects of CGs. Digitoxin appeared most potent and IC50 values for several patient samples were at concentrations that may be achieved in the clinic. Significant protein synthesis inhibition at concentrations corresponding to IC50 was demonstrated in colorectal tumour cell lines moderately resistant to the cytotoxic effects of digoxin and digitoxin, but not in highly sensitive leukaemia cell lines. Conclusion It is suggested that further investigation regarding CGs may be focused on diagnoses like T- and B-precursor ALL."
https://openalex.org/W2077536112,"Social motility (S motility), the coordinated movement of large cell groups on agar surfaces, of Myxococcus xanthus requires type IV pili (TFP) and exopolysaccharides (EPS). Previous models proposed that this behavior, which only occurred within cell groups, requires cycles of TFP extension and retraction triggered by the close interaction of TFP with EPS. However, the curious observation that M. xanthus can perform TFP-dependent motility at a single-cell level when placed onto polystyrene surfaces in a highly viscous medium containing 1% methylcellulose indicated that ""S motility"" is not limited to group movements. In an apparent further challenge of the previous findings for S motility, mutants defective in EPS production were found to perform TFP-dependent motility on polystyrene surface in methylcellulose-containing medium. By exploring the interactions between pilin and surface materials, we found that the binding of TFP onto polystyrene surfaces eliminated the requirement for EPS in EPS(-) cells and thus enabled TFP-dependent motility on a single cell level. However, the presence of a general anchoring surface in a viscous environment could not substitute for the role of cell surface EPS in group movement. Furthermore, EPS was found to serve as a self-produced anchoring substrate that can be shed onto surfaces to enable cells to conduct TFP-dependent motility regardless of surface properties. These results suggested that in certain environments, such as in methylcellulose solution, the cells could bypass the need for EPS to anchor their TPF and conduct single-cell S motility to promote exploratory movement of colonies over new specific surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W2064684323,"Understanding constraints on phenotypic plasticity is central to explaining its evolution and the evolution of phenotypes in general, yet there is an ongoing debate on the classification and relationships among types of constraints. Since plasticity is often a developmental process, studies that consider the ontogeny of traits and their developmental mechanisms are beneficial. We manipulated the timing and reliability of cues perceived by fire salamander larvae for the future desiccation of their ephemeral pools to determine whether flexibility in developmental rates is constrained to early ontogeny. We hypothesized that higher rates of development, and particularly compensation for contradictory cues, would incur greater endogenous costs. We found that larvae respond early in ontogeny to dried conspecifics as a cue for future desiccation, but can fully compensate for this response in case more reliable but contradictory cues are later perceived. Patterns of mortality suggested that endogenous costs may depend on instantaneous rates of development, and revealed asymmetrical costs of compensatory development between false positive and false negative early information. Based on the results, we suggest a simple model of costs of development that implies a tradeoff between production costs of plasticity and phenotype-environment mismatch costs, which may potentially underlie the phenomenon of ontogenetic windows constraining plasticity."

X-ray crystallographic analysis of CEL-IV revealed that its tetrameric structure was stabilized by multiple interchain disulfide bonds among the subunits. Although CEL-IV has the EPN motif in its carbohydrate-binding sites, which is known to be characteristic of mannose binding C-type CRDs, it showed preferential binding of galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine. Structural analyses of CEL-IV-melibiose and CEL-IV-raffinose complexes revealed that their galactose residues were recognized in an inverted orientation compared with mannose binding C-type CRDs containing the EPN motif, by the aid of a stacking interaction with the side chain of Trp-79. Changes in the environment of Trp-79 induced by binding to galactose were detected by changes in the intrinsic fluorescence and UV absorption spectra of WT CEL-IV and its site-directed mutants. The binding specificity of CEL-IV toward complex oligosaccharides was analyzed by frontal affinity chromatography using various pyridylamino sugars, and the results indicate preferential binding to oligosaccharides containing Galβ1–3/4(Fucα1–3/4)GlcNAc structures. These findings suggest that the specificity for oligosaccharides may be largely affected by interactions with amino acid residues in the binding site other than those determining the monosaccharide specificity.

The mechanism of cell-to-cell movement in sobemoviruses has not been well studied. With a view to identify the viral encoded ancillary proteins of SeMV that may assist in cell-to-cell movement of the virus, all the proteins encoded by SeMV genome were cloned into yeast Matchmaker system 3 and interaction studies were performed. Two proteins namely, viral protein genome linked (VPg) and a 10-kDa protein (P10) c v gft encoded by OFR 2a, were identified as possible interacting partners in addition to the viral coat protein (CP). Further characterization of these interactions revealed that the movement protein (MP) recognizes cognate RNA through interaction with VPg, which is covalently linked to the 5′ end of the RNA. Analysis of the deletion mutants delineated the domains of MP involved in the interaction with VPg and P10. This study implicates for the first time that VPg might play an important role in specific recognition of viral genome by MP in SeMV and shed light on the possible role of P10 in the viral movement."

The interaction between HspBP1 and the ATPase domain of the major heat shock protein Hsp70 up-regulates nucleotide exchange and reduces the affinity between Hsp70 and the peptide in its peptide-binding site. Previously we have shown that Tag7 (also known as peptidoglycan recognition protein PGRP-S), an innate immunity protein, interacts with Hsp70 to form a stable Tag7-Hsp70 complex with cytotoxic activity against some tumor cell lines. This complex can be produced in cytotoxic lymphocytes and released during interaction with tumor cells. Here the effect of HspBP1 on the cytotoxic activity of the Tag7-Hsp70 complex was examined. HspBP1 could bind not only to Hsp70, but also to Tag7. This interaction eliminated the cytotoxic activity of Tag7-Hsp70 complex and decreased the ATP concentration required to dissociate Tag7 from the peptide-binding site of Hsp70. Moreover, HspBP1 inhibited the cytotoxic activity of the Tag7-Hsp70 complex secreted by lymphocytes. HspBP1 was detected in cytotoxic CD8+ lymphocytes.

The main function of these proteins is to protect cells against damage produced by various stress factors (1Bukau B. Deuerling E. Pfund C. Craig E.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 119-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Hsp70 is an ATP-dependent chaperone, which promotes folding of nascent proteins or refolding of the proteins that were partially denatured after exposure of cells in an unfavorable environment (1Bukau B.

In addition, Hsp70 is involved in assembly of multiprotein complexes and protein translocation across the plasma membrane (4Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2435) Google Scholar). In the chaperone reaction, the Hsp70 peptide-binding domain binds to the misfolded protein. After restoration of folding, the peptide substrate is released from the active site of Hsp70. The N-terminal ATP-binding domain is involved in the control of binding of the protein substrate. The ATP-carrying form of Hsp70 has low affinity for substrate proteins and a high rate of nucleotide exchange. The ATPase activity of the N-terminal domain results in an ADP version of the chaperone with high affinity for the substrate (5Greene L.E. Zinner R. Naficy S. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2967-2973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).

The human 70-kDa heat shock protein 1A (Hsp70, GenBankTM accession number NM_005345) was subcloned into pQE-30 (Qiagen) and expressed in Escherichia coli M15[pREP4] (Qiagen). Human HspBP1 (GenBankTM accession number NM_012267) and core domain of HspBP1 (amino acids 84–359) were subcloned into pET-28a (Novagen, Madison, WI) and expressed in E. coli as described by Raynes and Guerriero (8Raynes D.A. Guerriero Jr., V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32883-32888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The proteins were purified on Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) as recommended by the manufacturer. Mouse rTag7 produced in yeast was kindly provided by Dr. S. V. Benevolensky. Unless otherwise specified, the standard incubation for formation of protein complexes was 30 min at 37 °C in PBS at pH 7.4. Secreted proteins were obtained by incubation of lymphocytes with K562 cells (100:1) for 18 h in serum-free RPMI 1640. The antibodies to HspBP1 were added at 10 μg/ml for inhibition experiments. In the control experiments, IgG from sheep serum were added at the same concentration. Cells were removed by centrifugation and the conditioned medium was tested for the presence of Tag7 and HspBP1 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and in cytotoxic assays. Anti-HspBP1 antibodies were raised in sheep as described by Raynes et al. (27Raynes D.A. Thomson C.A. Stroster J. Newton T. Cuneo P. Guerriero V. J. Immunoassay Immunochem. 2006; 27: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-HspBP1 were from Delta Biolabs, Campbell, CA. Anti-human Tag7 antibodies were raised in mice by injection of electrophoretically purified human Tag7 (produced as in Ref. 28Guan R. Wang Q. Sundberg E.J. Mariuzza R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 347: 683-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar); mouse serum IgG were purified and used for immunoblotting at 1:20,000 dilution. Anti-Tag7 resin and anti-HspBP1 resin were made by coupling antibodies to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) using the manufacturer's protocol. HspBP1 and Tag7 were preincubated in equimolar concentrations (10 nm) for 1 h at room temperature and passed through the columns. The columns were extensively washed with PBS plus 0.5 m NaCl, PBS, and eluted with 0.25 m triethylamine (TEA, Sigma) pH 12. Eluted proteins were resolved by 10–15% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (Amersham Biosciences) by semidry transfer, blocked, and incubated with anti-Tag7 antibodies or sheep anti-HspBP1. Blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences rabbit anti-mouse, 1:40,000 or donkey anti-sheep, 1:20,000). ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences) was used for visualization according to the manufacturer's instructions. The concentration of HspBP1 in the conditioned medium was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) as described by Raynes et al. (27Raynes D.A. Thomson C.A. Stroster J. Newton T. Cuneo P. Guerriero V. J. Immunoassay Immunochem. 2006; 27: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The content of Tag7 in the samples was measured by competitive EIA. Recombinant Tag7 (200 ng/ml) was adsorbed in wells of a 96-well plate. The reaction was carried out by adding 50 μl of polyclonal mouse anti-Tag7 antibodies (dilution 1:10,000) to 50 μl of analyzed fluid. Recombinant Tag7 at 1–100 ng/ml was used for plotting the calibration curve. The TMB liquid substrate system was from Sigma. CD3+CD8+ lymphocytes were washed twice with PBS; fixation and permeabilization were carried out using FIX & PERM kit (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). To visualize intracellular HspBP1, cells were stained with sheep anti-HspBP1 antibodies followed by Alexa488-conjugated donkey anti-sheep IgG (Invitrogen). After washing with PBS and 50 mm NH4Cl, specimens were mounted in ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Fluorescence images were obtained with a Leica TCS SP2 confocal microscope, analyzed with Leica confocal software, and prepared in Photoshop CE (Adobe Systems). Proteins were preincubated at equimolar concentrations (10 nm) in various combinations and order. Cytotoxicity was measured in L929 cells cultured in 96-well plates at a density of 3 × 104 cells/well. Proteins were added (200 μl) and incubated for 20 h at 37 °C. Cells were stained with Trypan Blue, and coded samples were counted under the microscope; at least 100 cells were scored for each group (17Sashchenko L.P. Dukhanina E.A. Yashin D.V. Shatalov Y.V. Romanova E.A. Korobko E.V. Demin A.V. Lukyanova T.I. Kabanova O.D. Khaidukov S.V. Kiselev S.L. Gabibov A.G. Gnuchev N.V. Georgiev G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2117-2124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Cytotoxicity was calculated as Equation 1, Cytotoxicity=(St−Sp)(T−Sp)×100%(Eq. 1) where St is the number of stained cells; Sp, spontaneously stained cells; T, total cells. In some cases cell death was determined with the CytoTox 96 Assay kit (Promega, Madison WI); the discrepancy between the two assays never exceeded 7%. Tag7, Hsp70, and HspBP1 alone were used as controls, and the cytotoxicity of each did not exceed 3%. To test membrane-bound extracellular HspBP1, lymphocytes were stained with R-Phycoerytrin-labeled monoclonal antibodies to CD8 (Beckman Coulter Inc.) followed by staining with sheep anti-HspBP1 antibodies and by FITC-conjugated donkey anti-sheep IgG (Sigma). To test intracellular HspBP1, CD8-stained lymphocytes were fixed and permeabilized using the FIX & PERM kit (Caltag Laboratories) and stained as above. Washed cell were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde (Sigma). The samples (at least 104 cells each) were analyzed with a Cytomics FC500MPL flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter Inc.) in the logarithmic channel of fluorescence. The data were processed with CXP Software (version 2.2, Beckman Coulter, Inc.). 10 μg of rHspBP1 was digested with 0.25 μg of trypsin (Sigma) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8 for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.25 μg of soybean trypsin inhibitor. The peptides were loaded on a Tag7-Sepharose column, extensively washed with PBS containing 0.5 m NaCl followed by PBS, and eluted with 0.25 m TEA, pH 12. The eluted peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and selected mass values from the spectra were used to search the protein data base Swiss-Prot. Before analyzing the effect of HspBP1 on the cytotoxic activity of the Tag7-Hsp70 complex, we had to test whether this co-chaperone could interact with both protein components of this complex. Binding of HspBP1 to Hsp70 was clearly demonstrated previously (8Raynes D.A. Guerriero Jr., V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32883-32888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 10Shomura Y. Dragovic Z. Chang H.C. Tzvetkov N. Young J.C. Brodsky J.L. Guerriero V. Hartl F.U. Bracher A. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 367-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Here we examined the ability of HspBP1 and Tag7 to interact with each other. First, specific immunoadsorbent columns with antibodies against HspBP1 and Tag-7 were prepared and shown to be protein-specific (supplemental Fig. S1). Both proteins were co-incubated in equimolar concentrations (10−9 m), the mixtures were applied to the columns and the bound fractions were analyzed with SDS-PAGE. Tag7 and HspBP1 were bound to each column (Fig. 1A), indicating formation of a complex. This interaction was confirmed by HspBP1 binding to the column with immobilized Tag7 (Fig. 1B). HspBP1 was subjected to tryptic hydrolysis and the resulting peptides were applied to the column with immobilized Tag7. The bound peptides were eluted and analyzed by MALDI mass spectrometry. Tag7 was bound to the peptide corresponding to residues 246–265 of the HspBP1 amino acid sequence. These results establish that HspBP1 interacts with Tag7, and identify the specific interaction site on HspBP1. The interaction of HspBP1 with Hsp70 and Tag7 was examined for effects on cytotoxicity using the established assay for cytotoxic activity of the binary Tag7-Hsp70 complex (17Sashchenko L.P. Dukhanina E.A. Yashin D.V. Shatalov Y.V. Romanova E.A. Korobko E.V. Demin A.V. Lukyanova T.I. Kabanova O.D. Khaidukov S.V. Kiselev S.L. Gabibov A.G. Gnuchev N.V. Georgiev G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2117-2124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). None of these proteins alone had a toxic effect on L-929 cells (supplemental Fig. S2). Moreover, cytotoxicity did not appear after co-incubation of all three proteins in equimolar concentrations (supplemental Fig. S2). Complexes were produced by incubating equimolar mixtures of the following protein pairs: [Tag7+Hsp70], [Hsp70+HspBP1], and [Tag7+HspBP1]. An aliquot of each complex was incubated with increasing amounts of the third component (HspBP1, Tag7, or Hsp70). All samples were analyzed for cytotoxic activity (Fig. 2A). One protein pair, Tag7+Hsp70, at 10−10 M demonstrated full activity (25% death of l-929 cells), while Hsp70+HspBP1 and Tag7+HspBP1 pairs showed no cytotoxicity. Addition of HspBP1 to the Tag7-Hsp70 complex resulted in a drop of cytotoxicity. An equimolar concentration of HspBP1 decreased the maximal cytotoxic activity by half, while a 5-fold greater concentration of this protein eliminated it completely. These data were corroborated by addition of the core domain of HspBP1 (amino acids 84–359) to Tag7+Hsp70. This truncated protein exhibited the properties of the full-length protein. Titration of inactive pairs with Tag7 and Hsp70 resulted in an increase in cytotoxicity that was half-maximal at a 2.5-fold excess of the titrant, while a 5-fold excess of the complementary protein resulted in nearly complete restoration of cytotoxicity. These results suggest competitive replacement of HspBP1 in an inactive pair by the active component (Tag7 or Hsp70), leading to formation of the cytotoxic Tag7-Hsp70 complex. It can be hypothesized that the dramatic loss of cytotoxic activity of the Tag7-Hsp70 complex in the presence of HspBP1 is related to dissociation of Tag7 from the complex as a result of structural alteration of the peptide-binding domain. To check this point, we immobilized the Tag7-Hsp70 complex to a specific anti-Hsp70 column (supplemental Fig. S1) and processed this column with a 5-fold excess of HspBP1 (relative to the concentration of the complex). The bound and free fractions were assayed by SDS-PAGE. Fig. 2B (left lane) shows that under conditions that result in a complete loss of cytotoxic activity, HspBP1 is bound to the column but cannot dissociate Tag7 from the complex. No traces of Tag7 were detected in the fractions not bound to the column. The effect of ATP on the three-protein complex was examined. It has been established that HspBP1 can accelerate nucleotide exchange and decrease the affinity of protein binding at the peptide-binding site (10Shomura Y. Dragovic Z. Chang H.C. Tzvetkov N. Young J.C. Brodsky J.L. Guerriero V. Hartl F.U. Bracher A. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 367-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). A 5-fold excess of HspBP1 and 2 mM ATP were added to the complex bound on the anti-Hsp70 column. Tag7 was released from the column (Fig. 2B, right lane). In control experiments, addition of 5 mm ATP without HspBP1 did not induce dissociation of Tag7 from the complex (supplemental Fig. S3). As reported previously, 50 mm ATP produced partial dissociation of the Tag7-Hsp70 complex (supplemental Fig. S3, Ref. 17Sashchenko L.P. Dukhanina E.A. Yashin D.V. Shatalov Y.V. Romanova E.A. Korobko E.V. Demin A.V. Lukyanova T.I. Kabanova O.D. Khaidukov S.V. Kiselev S.L. Gabibov A.G. Gnuchev N.V. Georgiev G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2117-2124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Elimination of the cytotoxic activity of Tag7-Hsp70 under the action of HspBP1 without ATP can be explained by binding of this inhibitor to the proteins of the complex (Fig. 2, A and B). This interaction can modify the structure of the active binary complex. Gel filtration of the active complex [Tag7-Hsp70] with a 5-fold excess of HspBP1 showed that all three proteins were aggregated, resulting in a broad peak with a maximum at 500 kDa (data not shown). Previously we established that after incubation of LAK cells with HLA-negative tumor cells, the conditioned medium acquired cytotoxic activity against other tumor cells that was completely inhibited by either anti-Tag7 or anti-Hsp70 antibodies (Ref. 17Sashchenko L.P. Dukhanina E.A. Yashin D.V. Shatalov Y.V. Romanova E.A. Korobko E.V. Demin A.V. Lukyanova T.I. Kabanova O.D. Khaidukov S.V. Kiselev S.L. Gabibov A.G. Gnuchev N.V. Georgiev G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2117-2124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, supplemental Fig. S4). Under these conditions the lymphocytes secreted Tag7 complexed with Hsp70. These experiments did not detect free (not Hsp70-bound) Tag7 in the conditioned medium. 3E. A. Dukhanina and D. V. Yashin, unpublished observations. This fact makes it possible to assess the concentration of the secreted Tag7-Hsp70 complex by measuring the concentration of Tag7 protein. The concentrations of Tag7 in the conditioned medium were determined by immunoenzyme assays. The time course of Tag7 during incubation of LAK cells with K562cells was measured for 30 h. Table 1 shows that appreciable amounts of Tag7 appeared as early as within 3 h, and gradually increased to a maximum at 30 h.TABLE 1Tag7 and HspBP1 secretion by LAK cells during interaction with K562TimeConc.Tag7Conc.HspBP1HspBP1/Tag7 ratiohnmnm10.055 ± 0.0061.84 ± 0.23330.095 ± 0.012.5 ± 0.22660.15 ± 0.014.1 ± 0.327180.34 ± 0.030.8 ± 0.12.3300.4 ± 0.031.05 ± 0.12.6 Open table in a new tab The cytotoxic activity of the conditioned medium was assessed on L-929 cells, which were most susceptible to the action of the Tag7-Hsp70 complex (Ref. 17Sashchenko L.P. Dukhanina E.A. Yashin D.V. Shatalov Y.V. Romanova E.A. Korobko E.V. Demin A.V. Lukyanova T.I. Kabanova O.D. Khaidukov S.V. Kiselev S.L. Gabibov A.G. Gnuchev N.V. Georgiev G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2117-2124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, supplemental Fig. S4). Maximal cytotoxicity in the conditioned medium was observed at a Tag7 concentration of 10−10 m, and further elevation of Tag7 concentration did not increase the percentage of dead cells (Fig. 3A). Addition of HspBP1 to the conditioned medium inhibited the cytotoxicity of the Tag7-Hsp70 complex. However, this reaction developed at higher concentrations of HspBP1 as compared with the experiments with a Tag7-Hsp70 complex made of recombinant proteins. Half-maximal cytotoxicity was achieved with a 10-fold excess of HspBP1 (relative to the Tag7-Hsp70 complex, Fig. 3B), while a 5-fold excess of HspBP1 was sufficient to completely eliminate the cytotoxic activity of the recombinant Tag7-Hsp70 complex (Fig. 2A). According to our preliminary data, only CD8+ lymphocytes in the cultured LAK cells can secrete the Tag7-Hsp70 complex during contact with tumor cells. 4L. P. Sashchenko, unpublished observations. Therefore, we isolated CD8+ cells from LAK cells and assayed HspBP1 in this fraction. Flow cytometry with specific antibodies revealed no HspBP1 on the surface of these cells. However, nearly 82% of CD8+ lymphocytes contained HspBP1 in their interior (Fig. 4A). This observation agrees with confocal microscopy analysis. The protein localized to granule-like structures situated at the cell periphery (Fig. 4B). When lymphocytes were co-incubated with K562 cells, the conditioned medium contained not only Tag7-Hsp70 complex, but also HspBP1 (Table 1). The concentration of HspBP1 in the conditioned medium was dependent on the duration of cell incubation. The maximum was at 6 h, which corresponded to an HspBP1/Tag7 ratio of 27. After incubation for 18–30 h, the HspBP1 concentration decreased, with a roughly 10-fold drop of the HspBP1/Tag7 ratio. It is noteworthy that although HspBP1 is available in K562 cells, they do not secrete this protein into the medium. In control experiments, lymphocytes not co-incubated with K562 cells released HspBP1 in significantly lower amounts, which remained constant ver 30 h of incubation (supplemental Table S1). Thus, secretion of HspBP1 was induced during the first hours of co-incubation of lymphocytes with K562 cells. The effect of persistent presence of HspBP1 in the conditioned medium on the cytotoxic activity of the Tag7-Hsp70 complex secreted by lymphocytes was examined. As early as 6 h of incubation of lymphocytes with K562 cells, Tag7 concentration in the medium reached 0.15 nm, which was sufficient to evoke maximal cytotoxicity (Table 1). This concentration continued to increase for 30 h. Paradoxically, the plot of Tag7-Hsp70 cytotoxic activity against incubation time was bell-shaped (Fig. 5A), with maximal cytotoxicity observed in 18–24 h. Co-incubation of lymphocytes with K562 cells in the presence of antibodies against HspBP1 modified the shape of the plot. Cytotoxic activity increased in the interval from 3 to 18 h of incubation, and from 24 to 30 h and became gently sloping. Co-incubation of the cells with rabbit IgG produced no effect on the shape of the plot. This suggests that HspBP1 in the conditioned medium can suppress Tag7-Hsp70 cytotoxic activity. After 6 h of incubation, the concentration of HspBP1 in the conditioned medium was 27 times higher than that of Tag7, and the cytotoxity was inhibited although the concentration of Tag7 reached its maximal value. The results in Fig. 3B demonstrate that addition to Tag7-Hsp70 of a 27-fold excess of HspBP1 strongly inhibits the cytotoxic activity. After 18 h, the concentration of HspBp1 dramatically drops, which allows the Tag7-Hsp70 complex to show its maximal cytotoxic potential. However, after long storage (30 h) the cytotoxic activity of the Tag7-Hsp70 complex declines even at a low concentration of the inhibiting component (HspBP1) as a result of aggregation of the active complex. Previously we observed that after storage for 30 h, the conditioned medium of LAK cells completely lost its cytotoxic properties. The present data show that this medium contained 0.8 nm HspBP1 (Table 1). These data allow us to suggest that HspBP1 may by responsible for this effect, because storing the conditioned medium for 30 h in the presence of antibodies against HspBP1 spared its cytotoxic activity (Fig. 5B). Our data show that co-chaperone HspBP1 interferes with the formation of active Tag7-Hsp70 as well as reduces the cytotoxicity of this complex, either formed of recombinant proteins in solution or released by cytotoxic lymphocytes. Moreover, we have found that HspBP1 is present in CD8+ lymphocytes and is released simultaneously with Tag7-Hsp70 during their contact with tumor cells. Apparently, HspBP1 inhibits the cytotoxic activity of Tag7-Hsp70 because of its ability to interact with the constituent proteins of this complex: it can bind not only with Hsp70 but also with Tag7, the binding site of HspBP1 in both cases containing Lys-249 (10Shomura Y. Dragovic Z. Chang H.C. Tzvetkov N. Young J.C. Brodsky J.L. Guerriero V. Hartl F.U. Bracher A. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 367-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). According to our recent data (29Dukhanina E.A. Kabanova O.D. Lukyanova T.I. Shatalov Y.V. Yashin D.V. Romanova E.A. Gnuchev N.V. Galkin A.V. Georgiev G.P. Sashchenko L.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 13963-13967Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the Ca2+-binding protein Mts1 can also bind with Hsp70 and Tag7, this interaction resulting in Tag7 dissociation from the complex and, consequently, in complete loss of cytotoxic activity. HspBP1 binding to Hsp70 stimulates nucleotide exchange, resulting in decreased affinity between Hsp70 and protein in the protein-binding site (10Shomura Y. Dragovic Z. Chang H.C. Tzvetkov N. Young J.C. Brodsky J.L. Guerriero V. Hartl F.U. Bracher A. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 367-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). HspBP1 binding to the Tag7-Hsp70 complex facilitated dissociation of Tag7 from the complex in the presence of ATP. In the absence of HspBP1, a 25-fold greater concentration of ATP was required to release Tag7 (17Sashchenko L.P. Dukhanina E.A. Yashin D.V. Shatalov Y.V. Romanova E.A. Korobko E.V. Demin A.V. Lukyanova T.I. Kabanova O.D. Khaidukov S.V. Kiselev S.L. Gabibov A.G. Gnuchev N.V. Georgiev G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2117-2124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Inhibition of cytotoxic activity of the Tag7-Hsp70 complex was also observed in the absence of ATP. HspBP1 bound to the complex fixed on the immunosorbent, but this did not lead to release of Tag7. Therefore, release of Tag7 is not required for inhibition of cytotoxicity. The data presented here suggest that HspBP1 binds to the Tag7-Hsp70 complex, modifies its structure, and eliminates its activity. Hsp70 is a multifunctional protein with a variety of activities; therefore, the biological activity of HspBP1 is also multifaceted. For example, it has been shown that HspBP1 is involved in the control of proteasomal activity by inhibition of CHIP ubiquitin ligase when it is complexed with Hsp70 (30Alberti S. Böhse K. Arndt V. Schmitz A. Höhfeld J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4003-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Recently it has been found that binding of HspBP1 to Hsp70 prevents inhibition of cathepsin-dependent death of tumor cells. The cells with a high HspBP1/Hsp70 molar ratio possess greater sensitivity to antitumor drugs than the cells with low values of this ratio (31Tanimura S. Hirano A.I. Hashizume J. Yasunaga M. Kawabata T. Ozaki K. Kohno M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35430-35439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). HspBP1 is also found in serum (27Raynes D.A. Thomson C.A. Stroster J. Newton T. Cuneo P. Guerriero V. J. Immunoassay Immunochem. 2006; 27: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), which suggests its role as an extracellular protein. Following heat stress, HspBP1 co-localizes with Hsp70 in chromogranin A-positive granules and is secreted simultaneously with Hsp70 (32Evdonin A. Kinev A. Tsupkina N. Guerriero V. Raynes D.A. Medvedeva N. Biol. Cell. 2009; 101: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In addition, HspBP1 binds to the brain tumor cell surface and can be internalized (33Graner M.W. Raynes D.A. Bigner D.D. Guerriero V. Cancer Science. 2009; 100: 1871-1879Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar), providing further evidence for a function outside the cell. This report further widens the extracellular role of HspBP1 demonstrating its ability to inhibit the cytotoxicity of the lymphocytic Tag7-Hsp70 complex. Earlier we have found that the cytotoxic Tag7-Hsp70 complex is formed inside CD8+ lymphocytes and is released into the medium. This secretion occurs via the Golgi complex (17Sashchenko L.P. Dukhanina E.A. Yashin D.V. Shatalov Y.V. Romanova E.A. Korobko E.V. Demin A.V. Lukyanova T.I. Kabanova O.D. Khaidukov S.V. Kiselev S.L. Gabibov A.G. Gnuchev N.V. Georgiev G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2117-2124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and it seems that Fas-FasL interaction is essential for triggering this secretion. In cytotoxic activity, the secreted Tag7-Hsp70 complex does not differ from the one made of recombinant proteins in solution. Both complexes induce apoptotic death of the target cancer cells involving mitochondria and lysosomes. This fact allows us to suggest internalization of the cytotoxic Tag7-Hsp70 complex.3 Interestingly, HspBP1 was found inside cytotoxic CD8+ lymphocytes. This co-chaperone is released into the medium simultaneously with the Tag7-Hsp70 complex during the contact of lymphocytes with the tumor cells. However, taking into consideration the heterogeneity of the CD8+ subpopulation, it is not certain that the same lymphocytes secrete both the cytotoxic complex and its inhibitor. Further work is needed to clarify this point. The concentration HspBP1 in the conditioned medium changed during cell incubation. The cytotoxic activity of the Tag7-Hsp70 complex was inhibited at a high concentration of HspBP1, but recovered when the HspBP1 concentration decreased. However, long-term incubation of Tag7-Hsp70 even at a low concentration of HspBP1 inactivated this complex. Thus, the cytotoxic activity of lymphocyte-secreted Tag7-Hsp70 complex was preserved for no longer than 30 h, which could be related to formation of inactive complexes or aggregates. The biological importance of simultaneous release of the complex and its inhibitor cannot be explained unequivocally. This paradox is related to the old problem of how the cells secreting cytotoxic agents can protect themselves from the action of their own products (34Herberman R.B. Reynolds C.W. Ortaldo J.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1986; 4: 651-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 35Jiang S. Persechini P.M. Perussia B. Young J.D. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 1453-1460PubMed Google Scholar). It is common knowledge that blood serum contains both cytotoxic proteins and their inhibitors (36Chertov O.Yu. Ermolaeva M.V. Satpaev D.K. Saschenko L.P. Kabanova O.D. Lukanidin E.M. Lukjianova T.I. Redchenko I.V. Blishchenko L.Yu. Gnuchev N.V. Immunol Lett. 1994; 42: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 37Karelin A.A. Phylippova M.M. Blishchenko E.Yu. Bovin N.V. Nasonov V.V. Shiyan S.D. Petrova E.E. Nesmeyanov V.A. Sashchenko L.P. Gnuchev N.V. Biochem. Mol Biol Int. 1994; 33: 73-80PubMed Google Scholar). It cannot be excluded that accumulation of secreted Tag7-Hsp70 complex and its long-term presence in the blood could damage normal cells such as lymphocytes or endotheliocytes. As one can see from supplemental Fig. S4, 500× concentration of Tag7-Hsp70 complex can kill prime culture fibroblasts. In this case, the simultaneous release of HspBP1 may be a mechanism of cell protection from the cytotoxic effect of this complex. Download .zip (.19 MB) Help with zip files"
https://openalex.org/W2027838649,"Background Most common systems of genetic engineering of mammalian cells are associated with insertional mutagenesis of the modified cells. Insertional mutagenesis is also a popular approach to generate random alterations for gene discovery projects. A better understanding of the interaction of the structural elements within an insertional mutagen and the ability of such elements to influence host genes at various distances away from the insertion site is a matter of considerable practical importance. Methodology/Principal Findings We observed that, in the context of a lentiviral construct, a transcript, which is initiated at an internal CMV promoter/enhancer region and incorporates a splice donor site, is able to extend past a collinear viral LTR and trap exons of host genes, while the polyadenylation signal, which is naturally present in the LTR, is spliced out. Unexpectedly, when a vector, which utilizes this phenomenon, was used to produce mutants with elevated activity of NF-κB, we found mutants, which owed their phenotype to the effect of the insert on a gene located tens or even hundreds of kilobases away from the insertion site. This effect did not result from a CMV-driven transcript, but was sensitive to functional suppression of the insert. Interestingly, despite the long-distance effect, expression of loci most closely positioned to the insert appeared unaffected. Conclusions/Significance We concluded that a polyadenylation signal in a retroviral LTR, when occurring within an intron, is an inefficient barrier against the formation of a hybrid transcript, and that a vector containing a strong enhancer may selectively affect the function of genes far away from its insertion site. These phenomena have to be considered when experimental or therapeutic transduction is performed. In particular, the long-distance effects of insertional mutagenesis bring into question the relevance of the lists of disease-associated retroviral integration targets, which did not undergo functional validation."
https://openalex.org/W2093233577,"Background The quality of X-ray crystallographic models for biomacromolecules refined from data obtained at high-resolution is assured by the data itself. However, at low-resolution, >3.0 Å, additional information is supplied by a forcefield coupled with an associated refinement protocol. These resulting structures are often of lower quality and thus unsuitable for downstream activities like structure-based drug discovery. Methodology An X-ray crystallography refinement protocol that enhances standard methodology by incorporating energy terms from the HINT (Hydropathic INTeractions) empirical forcefield is described. This protocol was tested by refining synthetic low-resolution structural data derived from 25 diverse high-resolution structures, and referencing the resulting models to these structures. The models were also evaluated with global structural quality metrics, e.g., Ramachandran score and MolProbity clashscore. Three additional structures, for which only low-resolution data are available, were also re-refined with this methodology. Results The enhanced refinement protocol is most beneficial for reflection data at resolutions of 3.0 Å or worse. At the low-resolution limit, ≥4.0 Å, the new protocol generated models with Cα positions that have RMSDs that are 0.18 Å more similar to the reference high-resolution structure, Ramachandran scores improved by 13%, and clashscores improved by 51%, all in comparison to models generated with the standard refinement protocol. The hydropathic forcefield terms are at least as effective as Coulombic electrostatic terms in maintaining polar interaction networks, and significantly more effective in maintaining hydrophobic networks, as synthetic resolution is decremented. Even at resolutions ≥4.0 Å, these latter networks are generally native-like, as measured with a hydropathic interactions scoring tool."
https://openalex.org/W2002061665,"The liver plays a vital role in glucose homeostasis, the synthesis of bile acids and the detoxification of foreign substances. Liver culture systems are widely used to test adverse effects of drugs and environmental toxicants. The two most prevalent liver culture systems are hepatocyte monolayers (HMs) and collagen sandwiches (CS). Despite their wide use, comprehensive transcriptional programs and interaction networks in these culture systems have not been systematically investigated. We integrated an existing temporal transcriptional dataset for HM and CS cultures of rat hepatocytes with a functional interaction network of rat genes. We aimed to exploit the functional interactions to identify statistically significant linkages between perturbed biological processes. To this end, we developed a novel approach to compute Contextual Biological Process Linkage Networks (CBPLNs). CBPLNs revealed numerous meaningful connections between different biological processes and gene sets, which we were successful in interpreting within the context of liver metabolism. Multiple phenomena captured by CBPLNs at the process level such as regulation, downstream effects, and feedback loops have well described counterparts at the gene and protein level. CBPLNs reveal high-level linkages between pathways and processes, making the identification of important biological trends more tractable than through interactions between individual genes and molecules alone. Our approach may provide a new route to explore, analyze, and understand cellular responses to internal and external cues within the context of the intricate networks of molecular interactions that control cellular behavior."

We study the emergence of such limits as a result of the statistics of large bitvectors used to represent items in memory, given two postulates: i) the Sparse Distributed Memory; and ii) chunking through averaging. Potential implications for theoretical neuroscience are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2089502508,"Basic courses in most medical schools assess students' performance by conferring scores. The objective of this work is to use a large score databank for the early identification of students with low performance and to identify course trends based on the mean of students' grades.We studied scores from 2,398 medical students registered in courses over a period of 10 years. Students in the first semester were grouped into those whose ratings remained in the lower quartile in two or more courses (low-performance) and students who had up to one course in the lower quartile (high-performance). ROC curves were built, aimed at the identification of a cut-off average score in the first semesters that would be able to predict low performances in future semesters. Moreover, to follow the long-term pattern of each course, the mean of all scores conferred in a semester was compared to the overall course mean obtained by averaging 10 years of data. Individuals in the low-performance group had a higher risk of being in the lower quartile of at least one course in the second semester (relative risk 3.907; 95% CI: 3.378-4.519) and in the eighth semester (relative risk 2.873; 95% CI: 2.495-3.308). The prediction analysis revealed that an average score of 7.188 in the first semester could identify students that presented scores below the lower quartiles in both the second and eighth semesters (p<0.0001 for both AUC). When scores conferred by single courses were compared over time, three time-trend patterns emerged: low variation, upward trend and erratic pattern.An early identification of students with low performance may be useful in promoting pedagogical strategies for these individuals. Evaluation of the time trend of scores conferred by courses may help departments monitoring changes in personnel and methodology that may affect a student's performance."
