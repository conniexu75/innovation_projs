https://openalex.org/W1995134833,"Colorectal (CR) tumors are usually curable if detected before metastasis. Because genetic alterations are associated with the development of these tumors, mutant genes may be found in the stool of individuals with CR neoplasms. The stools of nine patients whose tumors contained mutations of K-ras were analyzed. In eight of the nine cases, the ras mutations were detectable in DNA purified from the stool. These patients included those with benign and malignant neoplasms from proximal and distal colonic epithelium. Thus, colorectal tumors can be detected by a noninvasive method based on the molecular pathogenesis of the disease."

https://openalex.org/W1561652323,"Immunoreactive alpha B crystallin and a 28-kDa protein in an extract of human pectoral muscle were precipitated by (NH4)2SO4 at 40% saturation, and coeluted during column chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose and on Bio-Gel A-5m. The two proteins were separated on a column of S-Sepharose HP in the presence of 7 M urea. Further chromatography of each of the two resultant fractions on a column of Superdex 75 pg and on a TSK-SP 5PW column in the presence of urea yielded preparations of alpha B crystallin and the 28-kDa protein each of which gave a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The final preparation of 28-kDa protein contained at least two subtypes, which were separable on the TSK-SP column. However, fragmentation patterns of the two major 28-kDa proteins after digestion with endoproteinase Asp-N were identical. Amino acid sequences of peptides formed by cleavage of the purified 28-kDa protein and alpha B crystallin were identical to those of particular regions of the deduced amino acid sequences of human small heat shock protein (HSP28) and lens alpha B crystallin, respectively. Using an immunoassay method, with antibodies raised in rabbits, we found that HSP28 was present in all human tissues tested and at high levels (greater than 1 micrograms/mg protein) in the heart and other tissues composed of striated and smooth muscles. HSP28, found with alpha B crystallin, in extracts of several human and bovine tissues was trapped on and coeluted with alpha B crystallin from an affinity column prepared with antibodies against alpha B crystallin. This result suggests that the two proteins are associated in cells."
https://openalex.org/W2029147584,"A previously unknown class of dominant, maternal-effect lethal M factors was found to be widespread in natural populations of the flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, collected on several continents. Such factors are integrated into the host chromosomes at variable locations and show the remarkable property of self-selection by maternal-effect lethality to all hatchlings that do not inherit a copy of the factor itself. Offspring are rescued by either paternally or maternally inherited copies. The M-bearing chromosome is thereby perpetuated at the expense of its non-M homolog. M factors that map to different regions of the genome do not rescue one another's maternal-effect lethality. Factors expressing these properties are predicted to spread in a population, even in the absence of any additional selective advantage. Similar factors also occur in the related species T. confusum."
https://openalex.org/W1506378995,"All 6 tryptophan residues in the human HepG2-type glucose transporter (Glut1) were individually altered by site-directed mutagenesis to investigate the role of these residues in transport function. Tryptophan residues in positions 48, 65, 186, 363, 388, and 412 of Glut1 were changed to either a glycine or leucine residue. Mutant mRNAs were synthesized and injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes. Transporter function as assessed by uptake of 2-deoxy-D-[3H]glucose or transport of 3-O-[3H]methylglucose was decreased in the 388 and 412 mutants but was unaltered in all other mutants. The amount of the mutant transporters expressed in total membrane and plasma membrane fractions was measured using Glut1-specific antibodies. Calculation of the intrinsic transport activity of each of the mutants using these data demonstrated that the reduced transport activity of the 412 mutants was caused entirely by a dramatic decrease in the intrinsic activity of the mutant proteins whereas the reduced activity of the 388 mutants was a result of a decreased level of the protein in oocytes, decreased targeting to the plasma membrane, and a modest decrease in the intrinsic activity. Protease/glycosidase mapping of in vitro translation products indicated that the effects of the 388 and 412 point mutations could not be attributed to a disruption in the ability of the mutant proteins to insert properly into the membrane. The ID50 for cytochalasin B inhibition of 2-deoxyglucose uptake was increased from 5 x 10(-7) M for the wild-type Glut1 to 4 x 10(-6) M in the 388 mutants but was unaltered in the 412 mutants. These observations suggest that 1) Trp-412 may comprise part of a hexose binding site or is involved in maintaining a local tertiary structure critical for transport function; 2) Trp-388 is involved in stabilizing the equilibrium binding of cytochalasin B to the transporter. Trp-388 may therefore lie near a substrate binding site and also appears to participate in stabilization of local tertiary structure important for full catalytic activity and efficient targeting to the Xenopus plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1584580474,"Various deglycosylated derivatives of recombinant human erythropoietin (hEPO) were prepared and used to determine the role of the sugar chains in the expression of its biological activity in vivo and in vitro. Three N-linked oligosaccharides of hEPO have been partially or fully removed to obtain N-glycan (NG) (2)-, NG(1)-, and NG(0)-hEPO carrying two, one, and no N-linked sugar chains, respectively. The preparation lacking only O-linked sugar chain O O-glycan (OG) (0)-hEPO was also used. As de-N-glycosylation proceeded, the in vivo activity of the hormone decreased drastically, and the activity of these derivatives was correlated with the number of sialic acids bound to them. On the contrary, the in vitro activity was increased by the de-N-glycosylation; NG(0)-hEPO showed a 3-fold higher specific activity than the intact hormone. This was confirmed by binding experiments of the derivatives to target cells. The in vitro activity and the affinity also correlated with the number of sialic acids bound to the deglycosylated hEPO preparations. On the other hand, OG(0)-hEPO was as active as the intact hormone in vivo and in vitro. In conclusion, the N-linked sugar chains are not required for in vitro activity but required for in vivo activity, acting as anchors for the essential terminal sialic acids. The O-linked sugar chain has no essential role in the biological activity of the hormone in vivo or in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1520564498,"The beta-galactoside alpha 2,6-sialyltransferase has been localized to the trans cisternae of the Golgi apparatus and the trans Golgi network where it transfers sialic acid residues to terminal positions on N-linked oligosaccharides. It is a type II transmembrane protein possessing a 9-amino acid amino-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a 17-amino acid signal anchor domain, and a 35-amino acid stem region which tethers the large luminal catalytic domain to the membrane anchor. Previous work has demonstrated that the soluble sialytransferase catalytic domain is rapidly secreted from Chinese hamster ovary cells. These results suggest that the signals for Golgi apparatus localization do not reside in the catalytic domain of the enzyme but must reside in the cytoplasmic tail, signal anchor domain, and/or stem region. To determine which amino-terminal regions are required for Golgi apparatus localization, mutant sialyltransferase proteins were constructed by in vitro oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, expressed in Cos-1 cells, and localized by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. Signal cleavage-sialyltransferase mutants which consist of only the stem and catalytic domain of the enzyme are not rapidly secreted but are retained intracellularly and predominantly localized to the Golgi apparatus. However, deletion of either the stem region or the cytoplasmic tail of the membrane-bound sialyltransferase does not alter its Golgi apparatus localization. In addition, sequential replacement of the amino acids of the sialyltransferase signal anchor domain with amino acids from the signal anchor domain of a plasma membrane protein, the influenza virus neuraminidase does not alter the Golgi apparatus localization of the sialyltransferase. These observations suggest that sequences in the signal anchor region and stem region allow the Golgi apparatus localization of the membrane-bound and soluble forms of the sialytransferase, respectively, and that both regions may contain Golgi apparatus localization signals."
https://openalex.org/W1612882579,"The tetradecapeptide Ac-D-F-L-A-E-G-G-G-V-R-G-P-R-V-OMe, which mimics residues 7f-20f of the A alpha-chain of human fibrinogen, has been co-crystallized with bovine thrombin from ammonium sulfate solutions in space group P2(1) with unit cell dimensions of a = 83.0 A, b = 89.4 A, c = 99.3 A, and beta = 106.6 degrees. Three crystallographically independent complexes were located in the asymmetric unit by molecular replacement using the native bovine thrombin structure as a model. The standard crystallographic R-factor is 0.167 at 2.3-A resolution. Excellent electron density could be traced for the decapeptide, beginning with Asp-7f and ending with Arg-16f in the active site of thrombin; the remaining 4 residues, which have been cleaved from the tetradecapeptide at the Arg-16f/Gly-17f bond, are not seen. Residues 7f-11f at the NH2 terminus of the peptide form a single turn of alpha-helix that is connected by Gly-12f, which has a positive phi angle, to an extended chain containing residues 13f-16f. The major specific interactions between the peptide and thrombin are 1) a hydrophobic cage formed by residues Tyr-60A, Trp-60D, Leu-99, Ile-174, Trp-215, Leu-9f, Gly-13f, and Val-15f that surrounds Phe-8f; 2) a hydrogen bond linking Phe-8f NH to Lys-97 O;3) a salt link between Glu-11f and Arg-173; 4) two antiparallel beta-sheet hydrogen bonds between Gly-14f and Gly-216; and 5) the insertion of Arg-16f into the specificity pocket. Binding of the peptide is accompanied by a considerable shift in two of the loops near the active site relative to human D-phenyl-L-prolyl-L-arginyl chloromethyl ketone (PPACK)-thrombin."
https://openalex.org/W1602318815,"Dietary copper deficiency causes hypercholesterolemia and increased hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (MHG-CoA) reductase activity and increased hepatic glutathione (GSH) in rats. We hypothesized that inhibition of GSH production by L-buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), a specific GSH synthesis inhibitor, would abolish the cholesterolemia and increased HMG-CoA reductase activity of copper deficiency. In two experiments, two groups of 20 weanling male rats were fed diets providing 0.4 and 5.8 micrograms Cu/g, copper-deficient (Cu-D) and copper-adequate (Cu-A), respectively. At 35 days plasma cholesterol was significantly elevated by 30 to 43% in Cu-D and 10 animals in each of the Cu-D and Cu-A groups were randomly assigned to receive 10 mM BSO solution in place of drinking water and continued on the same diets for another 2 wk. At necropsy Cu-D animals had a significant 52 to 58% increase in plasma cholesterol. BSO administration abolished the cholesterolemia in Cu-D rats, but had no influence on plasma cholesterol of Cu-A rats. Hepatic GSH was increased 39 to 82% in Cu-D rats and BSO abolished this increase. BSO was without effect on cardiac hypertrophy, plasma and liver copper, and hematocrit indices of copper status. Liver microsome HMG-CoA reductase activity was significantly increased 85 to 288% in Cu-D rats and BSO administration abolished this increase in activity in Cu-D rats. The results suggest that copper deficiency cholesterolemia and elevated HMG-CoA reductase activity are a consequence of elevated hepatic GSH, and provide evidence for GSH regulation of cholesterol metabolism in intact animals."

https://openalex.org/W1502143215,"We have isolated cDNAs encoding a cardiac variant of the AE3 Cl-/HCO3- exchanger from a rat heart library. The predicted cardiac AE3 polypeptide is 1030 amino acids in length, while the AE3 variant expressed in brain consists of 1227 amino acids. The C-terminal 957 amino acids of both polypeptides are identical, but the cardiac protein contains a unique N-terminal sequence of 73 amino acids which replaces the first 270 amino acids of the brain form. To determine the genetic basis for the differences between the cardiac and brain AE3 variants, we isolated and characterized the rat gene. Exons 1-6 contain the 5'-untranslated sequence and the first 270 codons of the brain mRNA, while exons 7-23 contain the coding and 3'-untranslated sequences which are common to the brain and cardiac mRNAs. The 5'-untranslated and unique N-terminal coding sequences of the cardiac mRNA are contained within a single exon, termed C1, which forms part of the intron between exons 6 and 7 of the brain transcription unit. Primer extension and S1 nuclease protection assays demonstrate that transcription of the cardiac AE3 mRNA precursor is intiaited within this intron. Therefore, alternative promoter and exon usage are involved in generation of the two AE3 mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1556934473,"There is considerable controversy as to whether dental amalgams may cause systemic health effects in humans because they liberate elemental mercury. Most such amalgams contain as much as 50% metallic mercury. To determine the influence of dental amalgams on the mercury body burden of humans, we have given volunteers, with and without amalgams in their mouth, the sodium salt of 2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonic acid (DMPS), a chelating agent safely used in the Soviet Union and West Germany for a number of years. The diameters of dental amalgams of the subjects were determined to obtain the amalgam score. Administration of 300 mg DMPS by mouth increased the mean urinary mercury excretion of the amalgam group from 0.70 to 17.2 micrograms and that of the nonamalgam group from 0.27 to 5.1 micrograms over a 9-h period. Two-thirds of the mercury excreted in the urine of those with dental amalgams appears to be derived originally from the mercury vapor released from their amalgams. Linear regression analysis indicated a highly significant positive correlation between the mercury excreted in the urine 2 h after DMPS administration and the dental amalgam scores. DMPS can be used to increase the urinary excretion of mercury and thus increase the significance and reliability of this measure of mercury exposure or burden, especially in cases of micromercurialism."
https://openalex.org/W1488630681,"The molecular mechanisms that regulate intestine-specific gene expression and the transition from proliferating, undifferentiated crypt cells to nonproliferating, differentiated villus cells are unknown. Sucrase-isomaltase is an apical membrane disaccharidase that is found exclusively in enterocytes of adult intestine and is expressed in a complex pattern along the intestinal crypt-villus axis. To investigate the regulation of sucrase-isomaltase, we have cloned and sequenced 3.6 kilobases of the 5'-flanking region of the human sucrase-isomaltase gene. The transcriptional start site was mapped in human small intestine and in a colonic adenocarcinoma cell line (Caco-2) using an anchored polymerase chain reaction, primer extension, and RNase protection assays. The 5'-flanking DNA of the gene was linked to either chloramphenicol acetyltransferase or luciferase reporter genes and used for transfection into Caco-2, HeLa, and HepG2 cells. This analysis demonstrated that intestine-specific transcription of the sucrase-isomaltase gene involves both proximal and distal regulatory elements. Use of sucrase-isomaltase as a model gene will allow investigation of the mechanisms that regulate transcription of enterocyte-specific genes, developmental gene expression in the small intestine and colon, and the process of differentiation as epithelial cells migrate from intestinal crypts onto the villus in adult intestine."
https://openalex.org/W1540277295,"We have shown previously that cleavage of a number of precursors by the mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP) requires an intermediate octapeptide (FXXSXXXX) between the MPP cleavage site and the mature protein amino terminus. We show now that these octapeptides, present at the amino termini of the intermediates, direct recognition of these substrates by the mitochondrial intermediate peptidase (MIP), leading to formation of mature proteins. Synthetic peptides, corresponding to the intermediate octapeptides of human ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) and of Neurospora cytochrome c reductase Fe/S subunit (Fe/S), inhibit the processing activity of purified rat liver MIP in vitro, without affecting MPP activity; this indicates that the octapeptides can be recognized by MIP independent of the presence of the corresponding mature proteins and interact with a site that is crucial for MIP activity. MIP activity is not inhibited by a peptide lacking the amino-terminal hydrophobic residue, while substitution of such a residue by a polar amino acid causes a 10-fold reduction in the efficiency of MIP inhibition. To analyze the requirements for removal of the octapeptide from the intermediate proteins by MIP, artificial intermediates were synthesized and subjected to in vitro processing by purified MIP. The octapeptide can be cleaved by MIP only when the amino-terminal hydrophobic residue is also the amino terminus of the intermediate. Further, when the OTC octapeptide is joined to the mature amino terminus of another twice-cleaved precursor (pFe/S; rat malate dehydrogenase, pMDH), the chimeric intermediate is cleaved by MIP to the corresponding mature-sized protein. When the OTC octapeptide is joined to the mature amino terminus of a once-cleaved precursor (yeast F1-beta-ATPase, pF1-beta), however, this intermediate is not cleaved by MIP; rather, it is processed by MPP to mature-sized F1-beta. Therefore, amino-terminal octapeptides can be cleaved by MIP only within the structural context of twice-cleaved precursors."
https://openalex.org/W1572001614,"To determine the role of sequences other than the hydrophobic core in mediating signal sequence function, we examined the behavior of fusion proteins and deletion mutants in cell-free systems. We demonstrate that neither the N nor the C region of the preprolactin signal sequence is necessary for translocation. However, insertion of sequences with either a net charge of +2.5 or -6.0 between the N region and the hydrophobic core of the signal converted it into a signal-anchor. The topologies adopted (types I and II, respectively) were opposite those predicted from the distribution of charges surrounding the hydrophobic core of the signals. When these mutant signals were located in the interior of an otherwise secreted protein, both sequences functioned as stop-transfer sequences. Related mutations were assayed in fusion proteins in which the IgM transmembrane domain functioned as an amino-terminal signal-anchor. For these molecules, the distribution of charged residues surrounding the hydrophobic core had no influence on the topology adopted. Our results suggest that features other than simple charge distribution play an important role in determining membrane topology in vitro."

https://openalex.org/W1533411169,"The role of the activation peptide in determining the substrate specificity of intrinsic pathway factor X (fX) activation was studied by using a novel derivative of fX in which 49 residues were removed enzymatically from the NH2 terminus of the 52-residue activation peptide by an enzyme from the venom of the snake Agkistrodon rhodostoma. The modified protein, designated fXdes-143-191, is inactive but is activated to alpha-fXa by either the intrinsic fX activation complex (intrinsic fXase) composed of factor IXa beta, thrombin-activated factor VIII (fVIIIaIIa), and phospholipid vesicles or by the fX coagulant protein from Russell's viper venom (RVV-XCP). Both the Km and kcat for the activation of fX by RVV-XCP were greater than for fXdes-143-191, resulting in less than a 2-fold difference in the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) suggestive of nonproductive binding of fXdes-143-191 to RVV-XCP. The activation of each substrate by intrinsic fXase revealed that the kcat was 100-fold greater for fX than fXdes-143-191 (16 and 0.16 s-1, respectively), although there was no detectable difference in Km (60 and 80 nM, respectively). Activations by fIXa beta/phospholipid in the absence of fVIIIaIIa also revealed a difference in kcat but not Km, but the difference in kcat was smaller (kcat of 0.007 and 0.002 s-1 and Km of 220 and 170 nM for fX and fXdes-143-191, respectively). Analysis of product versus time curves demonstrated that fVIIIaIIa promotes formation of the actyl-enzyme intermediate during fX activation. We conclude that the activation peptide plays a critical role during acyl-enzyme formation that is most pronounced in the presence of fVIIIaIIa. The absence of Km differences suggests that residues NH2-terminal to P3 do not contribute to the initial formation of the enzyme-substrate complex."
https://openalex.org/W1587831793,"In order to purify the lipoamide dehydrogenase associated with the glycine decarboxylase complex of pea leaf mitochondria, the activity of free lipoamide dehydrogenase has been separated from those of the pyruvate and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complexes under conditions in which the glycine decarboxylase dissociates into its component subunits. This free lipoamide dehydrogenase which is normally associated with the glycine decarboxylase complex has been further purified and the N-terminal amino acid sequence determined. Positive cDNA clones isolated from both a pea leaf and embryo lambda gt11 expression library using an antibody raised against the purified lipoamide dehydrogenase proved to be the product of a single gene. The amino acid sequence deduced from the open reading frame included a sequence matching that determined directly from the N terminus of the mature protein. The deduced amino acid sequence shows good homology to the sequence of lipoamide dehydrogenase associated with the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex from Escherichia coli, yeast, and humans. The corresponding mRNA is strongly light-induced both in etiolated pea seedlings and in the leaves of mature plants following a period of darkness. The evidence suggests that the mitochondrial enzyme complexes: pyruvate dehydrogenase, 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, and glycine decarboxylase all use the same lipoamide dehydrogenase subunit."

https://openalex.org/W1505193132,"We constructed a recombinant baculovirus containing cardiac Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger cDNA under control of the polyhedrin promoter. When either Sf9 or Sf21 insect cells are infected with the recombinant baculovirus, both Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger protein and Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange activity are expressed at high level. The exchanger protein can be detected either by immunoblot or by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of whole cell lysate. At maximal expression, the exchanger protein comprises about 3-5% of total cell protein. The Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger can be purified by alkaline extraction of infected cells followed by elution from a Bio-Rad Prep Cell. The expressed exchanger, in contrast to the native sarcolemmal exchanger, is not glycosylated. Sf9 cells expressing the exchanger are intensely stained by anti-exchanger antibodies as observed by immunofluorescence. The expressed exchanger is predominantly in the cell plasma membrane since it is susceptible to extracellular trypsin. In 45Ca2+ flux experiments, the expressed Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange activity is about 4-fold higher than that in cultured neonatal rat heart cells. The expressed exchanger was also analyzed electrophysiologically using whole cell patch clamp techniques. The characteristics of inward exchange currents in infected Sf21 cells are very similar to those of ventricular myocytes, although of a larger magnitude."

https://openalex.org/W1514107968,"Abstract We report a defect in splicing of precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) resulting from a naturally occurring mutation of the gene encoding purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) in a patient with PNP-deficient severe combined immunodeficiency. This defects results from a G to T transversion at the terminal nucleotide of exon 2 within the 5' splice site of intron 2 and causes skipping of exon 2 during processing of PNP pre-mRNA. Translation of the misspliced mRNA results in a reading frameshift at the exon 1-exon 3 junction. The predicted polypeptide encoded by the aberrant mRNA is severely truncated, terminating at 31 amino acids. Only 4 residues at the NH2 terminus of the polypeptide correspond to PNP amino acids. Otherwise the translation product of the misspliced mRNA differs completely from PNP in amino acid sequence and has no PNP activity. The finding of exon skipping in PNP is the first report of a splicing defect resulting in PNP-deficient severe combined immunodeficiency. Analysis of the genomic context of the G-1 to T mutation of the 5' splice site lends support for the exon definition model of pre-mRNA splicing and contributes to the understanding of splice site selection."
https://openalex.org/W1522444375,"The breakdown of beta-casein (caseinolytic activity) by the bovine pituitary multicatalytic proteinase complex (MPC) is initiated by a fourth active site different from the previously described chymotrypsin-like activity (cleavage of Cbz-Gly-Gly-Leu-p-nitroanilide, where Cbz is benzyloxycarbonyl), trypsin-like activity (cleavage of Cbz-D-Ala-Leu-Arg-2-naphthylamide), and peptidylglutamyl peptide bond-hydrolyzing (PGP) activity (cleavage of Cbz-Leu-Leu-Glu-2-naphthylamide) (Yu, B., Pereira, M. E., and Wilk, S. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 17396-17400). 3,4-Dichloroisocoumarin, a serine proteinase inhibitor, stimulated the caseinolytic activity of bovine pituitary or lens MPC, 3-18-fold under conditions under which the other three catalytic activities were inactivated. Addition of hydroxylamine to the modified enzyme did not reverse the effects of the inhibitor. A form of the proteinase exhibiting only 2-4% of control chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and PGP activities degraded beta-casein with no accumulation of intermediate peptides. 3,4-Dichloroisocoumarin, by reacting with the chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and/or PGP-active sites, may promote a conformational change of MPC, rendering the caseinolytic active site accessible to the substrate. Once bound to the active site, beta-casein is rapidly degraded either by the caseinolytic component itself or by a cooperative interaction with catalytic centers that are not affected by the serine proteinase inhibitor. These results imply that the caseinolytic component does not belong to the class of serine proteinases. Other proteins tested were not degraded by the 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin-treated enzyme, suggesting that the conformation of beta-casein may be more adequate for degradation by the caseinolytic component."
https://openalex.org/W1520314327,"The calcitonin/calcitonin gene-related peptide-I (CALC-I) gene was one of the first examples of a cellular gene exhibiting alternative, tissue-specific processing of its primary RNA transcript. Calcitonin (CT) mRNA is the predominant product in thyroid C cells, whereas calcitonin gene-related peptide-I mRNA is the main product in neurons of the central and peripheral nervous systems. In this study, we report the existence of a novel CT-like (CT*) mRNA derived from the human CALC-I gene. CT* mRNA is the result of a novel splicing reaction which was initially detected in vitro. Translation of CT* mRNA will result in a prohormone (proCT*) which only differs from proCalcitonin (proCT) in its carboxyl terminus. Proteolytic processing of proCT* predicts, beside the amino-terminal cleavage peptide and CT, the existence of a novel carboxyl-terminal protein of 21 amino acids."

https://openalex.org/W1530732454,"A protein fatty acylesterase activity that catalyzes the removal of fatty acid from exogenous proteolipid protein (PLP) has been demonstrated in isolated rat brain myelin. Optimum enzyme activity for the deacylation of PLP was obtained in 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mM dithiothreitol at pH 7.0 and at 37 degrees C. Other detergents (octyl beta-D-glucoside, Nonidet P-40, and Tween 20) have little or no effect, whereas deacylation was completely abolished by 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate or boiling the membrane fraction for 5 min prior to incubation. Under optimal conditions, the rate of deacylation was linear up to 20 min, and the apparent Km for bovine [3H]palmitoyl-PLP was 18 microM. The myelin-associated PLP fatty acylesterase has no apparent requirements for divalent cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+), and chelators such as EDTA, [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)] tetraacetic acid, and 1,10-phenantroline have little or no effect on enzyme activity. Sulfhydryl and histidine residues are needed for full enzyme activity, whereas the active serine-directed inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride has no effect. The myelin-associated protein fatty acylesterase was present throughout brain development and in all myelin subfractions, in agreement with the dynamic metabolism of PLP-bound fatty acids. Enzyme activity was also present in sciatic nerve, brain cortex, and heart whereas liver was devoid of activity. Several esterases, including phospholipase A2, glyoxalase II, and acetylcholinesterase, did not remove fatty acid from PLP. Myelin basic protein, palmitoyl-CoA hydrolase, and myelin-associated nonspecific esterase were also ruled out as the PLP fatty acylesterase. Thus, all data seem to indicate that this enzyme is different from esterases of the lipid metabolism. Finally, stimulation of protein phosphorylation with Ca2+, but not with cyclic-AMP, inhibited PLP deacylation, suggesting that the myelin-associated protein fatty acylesterase activity is regulated by endogenous Ca(2+)-dependent protein kinases."
https://openalex.org/W1498108965,"Radioactively labeled brefeldin A was used to probe for proteins that interact with this metabolite. The most prominent protein labeled after in vivo incubation of Chinese hamster ovary cells with [3H]brefeldin A turned out to have an apparent molecular mass of 26 kDa. Radioactive peptides derived from the [3H]brefeldin A-labeled protein showed sequence identity with glutathione S-transferases, and immunoblotting after two-dimensional gel electrophoresis confirmed this result. In addition, Chinese hamster ovary cells convert the antibiotic to its glutathionyl and cysteinyl derivatives and secrete them rapidly into the medium. From these findings we conclude that detoxification of the antibiotic in mammalian cells occurs via the glutathion S-transferase system. This may explain the often observed reversibility of brefeldin A's action on the steady state of organelles in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W1524333180,"Avian glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase contains an NH2-terminal propetide-like sequence. NH2-terminal sequence analysis of immunoaffinity purified enzyme from chicken liver indicates that the propeptide is processed and the mature enzyme starts with Cys. Propeptide processing was investigated by site-directed mutagenesis using a system for expression in HeLa cells. Glutamine-dependent activity and processing were abolished by replacement of the conserved cysteine at position 1, whereas NH3-dependent activity was retained. Cys1 is thus inferred to have a role in glutamine-dependent activity and in propeptide processing. Inactive, insoluble enzymes in which the propeptide was not processed were obtained as a result of replacements of cysteines 415 and 488. Cysteine residues at positions 415 and 488 are inferred to be ligands to an Fe-S cluster on the basis of sequence similarity to the enzyme from Bacillus subtilis. Mutation of Cys269 and Cys295 led to loss of enzyme activity and propeptide processing, although solubility was unchanged. The results suggest that incorporation of an Fe-S cluster is needed for native structure, resultant propeptide processing, and glutamine-dependent activity."

FLP protein binds the sites and joins them into dimeric, asymmetric head-to-head complexes held together chiefly by strong noncovalent interactions. These complexes react with full (normal) FRT sites to generate a variety of products. Analysis of these DNA species reveals that the reaction follows a well-defined reaction pathway that generally parallels the normal reaction pathway. The system is useful in analyzing early steps in recombination, since the identity of the products in a given recombination event unambiguously pinpoints the order in which the cleavage and strand exchange reactions occur. Two conclusions are derived from the present study: (i) Formation of the dimeric head-to-head complex of sites is a prerequisite to further steps in recombination. (ii) The identity of the base pairs at positions 6 and -6 within the FRT site has a subtle effect in directing the first strand exchange event in the reaction to predominantly one of two possible cleavage sites. In addition, results are presented that suggest that a DNA-DNA pairing intermediate involving only two base pairs of the core sequence is formed prior to the first cleavage and strand exchange. DNA-DNA interactions may therefore not be limited to the isomerization step that follows the first strand exchange."

https://openalex.org/W1517253592,"Mirabilis antiviral protein (MAP), a ribosome-inactivating protein, inactivates both eukaryotic and prokaryotic ribosomes by means of site-specific RNA N-glycosidase activity. In order to identify the site of this activity, some amino acid residues of MAP, conserved in homologous ribosome-inactivating proteins, were altered to other amino acids by replacing DNA fragments of the total synthetic gene of MAP. When the in vitro proteins synthesis of rabbit reticulocyte was treated with MAP variants secreted into culture media of Escherichia coli transformants, the inhibitory effect of R26L and R48L (R26L designates MAP variant with Arg-26 changed to Leu) was found to be similar to that of native MAP. Both purified Y72F and Y118F had the same effect as native MAP, and E168D had a slightly weaker effect. In contrast, on the protein synthesis of E. coli, Y118F had one-tenth the effect of native MAP, and Y72F and E168D approximately one-hundredth the effect. These three variant proteins also exhibited reduced RNA N-glycosidase activity on substrate E. coli ribosomes. These results suggest that Tyr-72 and Glu-168 are involved in RNA N-glycosidase activity. When the R171K gene was expressed in E. coli, an N-glycosidic bond of the 23 S rRNA of the host ribosome was found to be cleaved, although no product of the gene could be detected. This suggests that MAP variants can maintain their N-glycosidase activity when the conserved Glu-168 and Arg-171 are changed to similarly charged residues."
