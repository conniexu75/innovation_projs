https://openalex.org/W2027205343,"We demonstrate the efficient chemical vapor deposition synthesis of single-walled carbon nanotubes where the activity and lifetime of the catalysts are enhanced by water. Water-stimulated enhanced catalytic activity results in massive growth of superdense and vertically aligned nanotube forests with heights up to 2.5 millimeters that can be easily separated from the catalysts, providing nanotube material with carbon purity above 99.98%. Moreover, patterned, highly organized intrinsic nanotube structures were successfully fabricated. The water-assisted synthesis method addresses many critical problems that currently plague carbon nanotube synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1999664967,"Quantum mechanics, through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, imposes limits on the precision of measurement. Conventional measurement techniques typically fail to reach these limits. Conventional bounds to the precision of measurements such as the shot noise limit or the standard quantum limit are not as fundamental as the Heisenberg limits and can be beaten using quantum strategies that employ “quantum tricks” such as squeezing and entanglement."
https://openalex.org/W2110839026,"Mobilization of fatty acids from triglyceride stores in adipose tissue requires lipolytic enzymes. Dysfunctional lipolysis affects energy homeostasis and may contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity and insulin resistance. Until now, hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) was the only enzyme known to hydrolyze triglycerides in mammalian adipose tissue. Here, we report that a second enzyme, adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), catalyzes the initial step in triglyceride hydrolysis. It is interesting that ATGL contains a “patatin domain” common to plant acyl-hydrolases. ATGL is highly expressed in adipose tissue of mice and humans. It exhibits high substrate specificity for triacylglycerol and is associated with lipid droplets. Inhibition of ATGL markedly decreases total adipose acyl-hydrolase activity. Thus, ATGL and HSL coordinately catabolize stored triglycerides in adipose tissue of mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2073632899,"By introducing twist during spinning of multiwalled carbon nanotubes from nanotube forests to make multi-ply, torque-stabilized yarns, we achieve yarn strengths greater than 460 megapascals. These yarns deform hysteretically over large strain ranges, reversibly providing up to 48% energy damping, and are nearly as tough as fibers used for bulletproof vests. Unlike ordinary fibers and yarns, these nanotube yarns are not degraded in strength by overhand knotting. They also retain their strength and flexibility after heating in air at 450°C for an hour or when immersed in liquid nitrogen. High creep resistance and high electrical conductivity are observed and are retained after polymer infiltration, which substantially increases yarn strength."
https://openalex.org/W2067185989,"An array of single nonmagnetic metallic split rings can be used to implement a magnetic resonance, which arises from an inductor-capacitor circuit (LC) resonance, at 100-terahertz frequency. The excitation of the LC resonance in the normal-incidence geometry used in our experiments occurs through the coupling of the electric field of the incident light to the capacitance. The measured optical spectra of the nanofabricated gold structures come very close to the theoretical expectations. Additional numerical simulations show that our structures exhibit a frequency range with negative permeability for a beam configuration in which the magnetic field couples to the LC resonance. Together with an electric response that has negative permittivity, this can lead to materials with a negative index of refraction."
https://openalex.org/W2024122918,"Negative refraction is currently achieved by driving the magnetic permeability and electrical permittivity simultaneously negative, thus requiring two separate resonances in the refracting material. The introduction of a single chiral resonance leads to negative refraction of one polarization, resulting in improved and simplified designs of negatively refracting materials and opening previously unknown avenues of investigation in this fast-growing subject."
https://openalex.org/W2045006795,"The observation of the regulation of fast protein dynamics in a cellular context requires the development of reliable technologies. Here, a signal regulation cascade reliant on the stimulus-dependent acceleration of the bidirectional flow of mitogen-activated protein kinase (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) across the nuclear envelope was visualized by reversible protein highlighting. Light-induced conversion between the bright and dark states of a monomeric fluorescent protein engineered from a novel coral protein was employed. Because of its photochromic properties, the protein could be highlighted, erased, and highlighted again in a nondestructive manner, allowing direct observation of regulated fast nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of key signaling molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1996609303,"To act as guides in the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) must be unwound into their component strands, then assembled with proteins to form the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which catalyzes target messenger RNA cleavage. Thermodynamic differences in the base-pairing stabilities of the 5′ ends of the two ∼21-nucleotide siRNA strands determine which siRNA strand is assembled into the RISC. We show that in Drosophila , the orientation of the Dicer-2/R2D2 protein heterodimer on the siRNA duplex determines which siRNA strand associates with the core RISC protein Argonaute 2. R2D2 binds the siRNA end with the greatest double-stranded character, thereby orienting the heterodimer on the siRNA duplex. Strong R2D2 binding requires a 5′-phosphate on the siRNA strand that is excluded from the RISC. Thus, R2D2 is both a protein sensor for siRNA thermodynamic asymmetry and a licensing factor for entry of authentic siRNAs into the RNAi pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2092641793,"The development of a patterned vasculature is essential for normal organogenesis. We found that signaling by semaphorin 3E (Sema3E) and its receptor plexin-D1 controls endothelial cell positioning and the patterning of the developing vasculature in the mouse. Sema3E is highly expressed in developing somites, where it acts as a repulsive cue for plexin-D1–expressing endothelial cells of adjacent intersomitic vessels. Sema3E–plexin-D1 signaling did not require neuropilins, which were previously presumed to be obligate Sema3 coreceptors. Moreover, genetic ablation of Sema3E or plexin-D1 but not neuropilin-mediated Sema3 signaling disrupted vascular patterning. These findings reveal an unexpected semaphorin signaling pathway and define a mechanism for controlling vascular patterning."
https://openalex.org/W1995949259,"Skeletal muscle size is regulated by anabolic (hypertrophic) and catabolic (atrophic) processes. We first characterized molecular markers of both hypertrophy and atrophy and identified a small subset of genes that are inversely regulated in these two settings (<i>e.g.</i> up-regulated by an inducer of hypertrophy, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and down-regulated by a mediator of atrophy, dexamethasone). The genes identified as being inversely regulated by atrophy, as opposed to hypertrophy, include the E3 ubiquitin ligase <i>MAFbx</i> (also known as atrogin-1). We next sought to investigate the mechanism by which IGF-1 inversely regulates these markers, and found that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/Akt/mTOR) pathway, which we had previously characterized as being critical for hypertrophy, is also required to be active in order for IGF-1-mediated transcriptional changes to occur. We had recently demonstrated that the IGF1/PI3K/Akt pathway can block dexamethasone-induced up-regulation of the atrophy-induced ubiquitin ligases <i>MuRF1</i> and <i>MAFbx</i> by blocking nuclear translocation of a FOXO transcription factor. In the current study we demonstrate that an additional step of IGF1 transcriptional regulation occurs downstream of mTOR, which is independent of FOXO. Thus both the Akt/FOXO and the Akt/mTOR pathways are required for the transcriptional changes induced by IGF-1."
https://openalex.org/W2064397441,"An autoregulatory transcription-translation feedback loop is thought to be essential in generating circadian rhythms in any model organism. In the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus , the essential clock protein KaiC is proposed to form this type of transcriptional negative feedback. Nevertheless, we demonstrate here temperature-compensated, robust circadian cycling of KaiC phosphorylation even without kaiBC messenger RNA accumulation under continuous dark conditions. This rhythm persisted in the presence of a transcription or translation inhibitor. Moreover, kinetic profiles in the ratio of KaiC autophosphorylation-dephosphorylation were also temperature compensated in vitro. Thus, the cyanobacterial clock can keep time independent of de novo transcription and translation processes."
https://openalex.org/W2145068137,"The human polyomavirus, JCV, causes the fatal demyelinating disease progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in immunocompromised patients. We found that the serotonergic receptor 5HT 2A R could act as the cellular receptor for JCV on human glial cells. The 5HT 2A receptor antagonists inhibited JCV infection, and monoclonal antibodies directed at 5HT 2A receptors blocked infection of glial cells by JCV, but not by SV40. Transfection of 5HT 2A receptor–negative HeLa cells with a 5HT 2A receptor rescued virus infection, and this infection was blocked by antibody to the 5HT 2A receptor. A tagged 5HT 2A receptor colocalized with labeled JCV in an endosomal compartment following internalization. Serotonin receptor antagonists may thus be useful in the treatment of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2055691692,"Female gender affords relative protection from cardiovascular disease until the menopause. We report that estrogen acts on estrogen receptor subtype alpha to up-regulate the production of atheroprotective prostacyclin, PGI 2 , by activation of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2). This mechanism restrained both oxidant stress and platelet activation that contribute to atherogenesis in female mice. Deletion of the PGI 2 receptor removed the atheroprotective effect of estrogen in ovariectomized female mice. This suggests that chronic treatment of patients with selective inhibitors of COX-2 could undermine protection from cardiovascular disease in premenopausal females."
https://openalex.org/W1999934349,"TRPM4 has recently been described as a calcium-activated nonselective (CAN) cation channel that mediates membrane depolarization. However, the functional importance of TRPM4 in the context of calcium (Ca 2+ ) signaling and its effect on cellular responses are not known. Here, the molecular inhibition of endogenous TRPM4 in T cells was shown to suppress TRPM4 currents, with a profound influence on receptor-mediated Ca 2+ mobilization. Agonist-mediated oscillations in intracellular Ca 2+ concentration ([Ca 2+ ] i ), which are driven by store-operated Ca 2+ influx, were transformed into a sustained elevation in [Ca 2+ ] i . This increase in Ca 2+ influx enhanced interleukin-2 production. Thus, TRPM4-mediated depolarization modulates Ca 2+ oscillations, with downstream effects on cytokine production in T lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2084144772,"The frequency of the 5s 2S(1/2)-4d 2D(5/2) electric quadrupole clock transition in a single, trapped, laser-cooled 88Sr+ ion has been measured by using an optical frequency comb referenced to a cesium fountain primary frequency standard. The frequency of the transition is measured as 444,779,044,095,484.6 (1.5) hertz, with a fractional uncertainty within a factor of 3 of that of the cesium standard. Improvements required to obtain a cesium-limited frequency measurement are described and are expected to lead to a 88Sr+ optical clock with stability and reproducibility exceeding that of the primary cesium standard."
https://openalex.org/W2094132709,"Ultrashort laser pulses have thus far been used in two distinct modes. In the time domain, the pulses have allowed probing and manipulation of dynamics on a subpicosecond time scale. More recently, phase stabilization has produced optical frequency combs with absolute frequency reference across a broad bandwidth. Here we combine these two applications in a spectroscopic study of rubidium atoms. A wide-bandwidth, phase-stabilized femtosecond laser is used to monitor the real-time dynamic evolution of population transfer. Coherent pulse accumulation and quantum interference effects are observed and well modeled by theory. At the same time, the narrow linewidth of individual comb lines permits a precise and efficient determination of the global energy-level structure, providing a direct connection among the optical, terahertz, and radio-frequency domains. The mechanical action of the optical frequency comb on the atomic sample is explored and controlled, leading to precision spectroscopy with an appreciable reduction in systematic errors."
https://openalex.org/W2022325938,"We describe a partial skeleton with facial cranium of Pierolapithecus catalaunicus gen. et sp. nov., a new Middle Miocene (12.5 to 13 million years ago) ape from Barranc de Can Vila 1 (Barcelona, Spain). It is the first known individual of this age that combines well-preserved cranial, dental, and postcranial material. The thorax, lumbar region, and wrist provide evidence of modern ape–like orthograde body design, and the facial morphology includes the basic derived great ape features. The new skeleton reveals that early great apes retained primitive monkeylike characters associated with a derived body structure that permits upright postures of the trunk. Pierolapithecus , hence, does not fit the theoretical model that predicts that all characters shared by extant great apes were present in their last common ancestor, but instead points to a large amount of homoplasy in ape evolution. The overall pattern suggests that Pierolapithecus is probably close to the last common ancestor of great apes and humans."
https://openalex.org/W2145404322,"After 50 years of development, microwave atomic clocks based on cesium have achieved fractional uncertainties below 1 part in 10 15 , a level unequaled in all of metrology. The past 5 years have seen the accelerated development of optical atomic clocks, which may enable even greater improvements in timekeeping. Time and frequency standards with various levels of performance are ubiquitous in our society, with applications in many technological fields as well as in the continued exploration of the frontiers of basic science. We review state-of-the-art atomic time and frequency standards and discuss some of their uses in science and technology."
https://openalex.org/W2031793643,"The B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) homologs myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) and A1 are prosurvival factors that selectively bind a subset of proapoptotic Bcl homology (BH) 3-only proteins. To investigate the molecular basis of the selectivity, we determined the solution structure of the C-terminal Bcl-2-like domain of Mcl-1. This domain shares features expected of a prosurvival Bcl-2 protein, having a helical fold centered on a core hydrophobic helix and a surface-exposed hydrophobic groove for binding its cognate partners. A number of residues in the binding groove differentiate Mcl-1 from its homologs, and in contrast to other Bcl-2 homologs, Mcl-1 has a binding groove in a conformation intermediate between the open structures characterized by peptide complexes and the closed state observed in unliganded structures. Mutagenesis of potential binding site residues was used to probe the contributions of groove residues to the binding properties of Mcl-1. Although mutations in Mcl-1 had little impact on binding, a single mutation in the BH3-only ligand Bad enabled it to bind both Mcl-1 and A1 while retaining its binding to Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w. Elucidating the selective action of certain BH3-only ligands is required for delineating their mode of action and will aid the search for effective BH3-mimetic drugs.

Programmed cell death (apoptosis) is a highly conserved and regulated process used by metazoans to eliminate damaged and surplus cells, such as those generated during development (1Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar). Important arbiters of this process are the B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) 1The abbreviations used are: Bcl-2, B cell lymphoma-2; BH, Bcl-2 homology; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; GST, glutathione S-transferase; r.m.s.d, root mean square deviation; PDB, Protein Data Bank; Mcl, myeloid cell leukemia. family of proteins that comprise prosurvival (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, Mcl-1, A1) and proapoptotic members (2Cory S. Huang D.C. Adams J.M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8590-8607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). The proapoptotic proteins are subdivided into the Bax-like (Bax, Bak, Bok) and the BH3-only proteins (Bad, Bim, Bmf, Bik, Hrk, Bid, Puma, Noxa) (3Huang D.C. Strasser A. Cell. 2000; 103: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). Affiliates of the subgroups are defined by their sequence similarities and biological function. Prosurvival members contain up to four regions of sequence homology known as “Bcl-2 homology” domains (BH1–4), whereas Bax, Bak, and Bok bear only BH1–3. The minimalist BH3-only molecules have only the short BH3 domain (3Huang D.C. Strasser A. Cell. 2000; 103: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). Cell survival is thought to be critically dependent on the interactions between the opposing factions of this family. Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) was cloned as an early response gene up-regulated in myeloid cells following addition of cytokines (4Kozopas K.M. Yang T. Buchan H.L. Zhou P. Craig R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3516-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar), although its expression is now appreciated to be widespread. Consistent with this, Mcl-1 appears to play an important role during development as germ line disruption of the mouse mcl-1 gene resulted in failure of blastocyst implantation (5Rinkenberger J.L. Horning S. Klocke B. Roth K. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 23-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tissue-selective deletion of Mcl-1 in the T- or B-lymphoid compartment resulted in lymphopenia (6Opferman J.T. Letai A. Beard C. Sorcinelli M.D. Ong C.C. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 2003; 426: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar); interestingly, Mcl-1, but not Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL, expression may be critical for survival of myeloma cells (7Zhang B. Gojo I. Fenton R.G. Blood. 2002; 99: 1885-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Given its key biological roles, it is not surprising that Mcl-1 is regulated at multiple levels. In many hematopoietic cells, growth factors promote cell survival by triggering mcl-1 transcription and stabilizing Mcl-1 protein (8Jourdan M. De Vos J. Mechti N. Klein B. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1244-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 9Derouet M. Thomas L. Cross A. Moots R.J. Edwards S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26915-26921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Conversely, cytokine withdrawal and other stress signals such as UV irradiation initiate cell death by promoting Mcl-1 degradation (10Nijhawan D. Fang M. Traer E. Zhong Q. Gao W. Du F. Wang X. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1475-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Although its C-terminal region shares sequence identity with Bcl-2 (4Kozopas K.M. Yang T. Buchan H.L. Zhou P. Craig R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3516-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar), the N-terminal region is unique among this class of proteins, containing regions of low sequence complexity and PEST (proline, glutamic acid, serine, threonine) sequences known to target proteins for rapid turnover through proteasomal degradation (11Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar). Precisely how the stability of Mcl-1 is controlled is unclear, although it is likely that its protein partners may affect this. Mcl-1, like other prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins, is neutralized by binding proapoptotic BH3-only proteins (1Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar, 2Cory S. Huang D.C. Adams J.M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8590-8607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). During lymphoid development Mcl-1 is probably controlled, at least in part, by Bim because loss of this BH3-only protein led to excess lymphocytes (12Bouillet P. Metcalf D. Huang D.C. Tarlinton D.M. Kay T.W. Kontgen F. Adams J.M. Strasser A. Science. 1999; 286: 1735-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar), the opposite effect to Mcl-1 loss. In contrast, loss of Bad, which is also expressed in this tissue and activated by cytokine deprivation, did not impact on lymphocytes (13Ranger A.M. Zha J. Harada H. Datta S.R. Danial N.N. Gilmore A.P. Kutok J.L. Le Beau M.M. Greenberg M.E. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9324-9329Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). A plausible explanation for this difference is that Bim, but not Bad, binds Mcl-1 (6Opferman J.T. Letai A. Beard C. Sorcinelli M.D. Ong C.C. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 2003; 426: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). In the lymphoid compartment, the similarities observed between the loss of Mcl-1 (6Opferman J.T. Letai A. Beard C. Sorcinelli M.D. Ong C.C. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 2003; 426: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar), Bcl-2 (14Veis D.J. Sorenson C.M. Shutter J.R. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 229-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar), and Bcl-xL (15Motoyama N. Wang F. Roth K.A. Sawa H. Nakayama K. Negishi I. Senju S. Zhang Q. Fujii S. Loh D.Y. Science. 1995; 267: 1506-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar) suggest that Mcl-1 has an essential, non-redundant function. The idea that Mcl-1 has a distinct role during cell death is also supported by observations that genotoxic stress kills HeLa cells through the inactivation of Mcl-1, which appears to selectively trigger Bak activation (16Cuconati A. Mukherjee C. Perez D. White E. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2922-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Collectively, these and other studies point to the critical and distinct role(s) of Mcl-1 in maintaining cell survival. A growing body of data suggests that the prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins have distinct biological and biochemical properties (1Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar, 17Letai A. Bassik M.C. Walensky L.D. Sorcinelli M.D. Weiler S. Korsmeyer S.J.

Although the determinants of these differences remain poorly defined, the recently described ability of Bcl-2 to selectively bind specific BH3-only proteins may be important (6Opferman J.T. Letai A.

Interactions between BH3 domains and Bcl-2 proteins varied over 10,000-fold in affinity, and particular protein pairings were highly preferred. 2L. Chen, S. N. Willis, A. Wei, B. J. Smith, J. I. Fletcher, M. G. Hinds, P. M. Colman, C. L. Day, J. M. Adams, and D. C. S. Huang, unpublished results. To examine the molecular basis of this specificity, which may explain some of the distinctive functional properties of Mcl-1, we have solved the solution structure of the Bcl-2 domain of Mcl-1. Like Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w, it shares a conserved α-helical fold. An analysis of the binding groove revealed differences that contribute to the distinct binding profile of this protein. Defining the molecular basis of specific binding may allow small molecules that target specific prosurvival members to be developed.

A series of heteronuclear three-dimensional NMR experiments were recorded using either 15N or 13C, 15N double labeled Mcl-1ΔNC23 (24Sattler M. Schleucher J. Griesinger C. Prog. Nucl. Magn. Reson.

The final structures had no experimental distance violations greater than 0.3 Å or dihedral angle violations greater than 5°. Structural figures were generated in MOLMOL. Solution and Binding Properties of Mcl-1—The C-terminal region of Mcl-1 shares sequence identity with Bcl-2, whereas its N-terminal region contains low complexity and proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine (PEST) sequences (4Kozopas K.M. Yang T. Buchan H.L. Zhou P. Craig R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3516-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Binding studies in 293T cells revealed that Mcl-1 with either N- or C-terminal truncations retained its avidity for Bim (Fig. 2A and data not shown), indicating that the Bcl-2 domain had not been disrupted by a 151-residue truncation at the N terminus or 11- and 23-residue C-terminal truncations. To obtain soluble recombinant proteins from E. coli, it was necessary to delete both N- and C-terminal sequences. The purified molecules, referred to as Mcl-1ΔNC11 and Mcl-1ΔNC23, both bound Bim tightly, but their behavior is not identical (Fig. 2B). Notably, the dissociation constant for BimBH3 binding is ∼20-fold tighter for Mcl-1ΔNC23 compared with the less truncated protein, because of an increase in the association rate compared with that for dissociation (Fig. 2B). This behavior for Mcl-1 mirrors that of Bcl-w and Bcl-xL, where the association rate of BimBH3 (mouse Bim residues 83–108) is increased by an order of magnitude in the absence of C-terminal residues, which were found to lie in the hydrophobic binding groove (23Hinds M.G. Lackmann M. Skea G.L. Harrison P.J. Huang D.C. Day C.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1497-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Chemical shift differences between resonances in the 1H, 15N HSQC spectra of Mcl-1ΔNC23 and Mcl-1ΔC11 were consistent with the C-terminal residues of the longer form interacting with the Bcl-2 fold (data not shown). Together, these data suggest the C-terminal tail of monomeric Mcl-1 obstructs the hydrophobic BH3 binding groove as it does for Bcl-w (23Hinds M.G. Lackmann M. Skea G.L. Harrison P.J. Huang D.C. Day C.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1497-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Although C-terminal truncation increased the affinity of Mcl-1 for BH3-only molecules, it did not affect the selective binding properties, as both full-length Mcl-1, Mcl-1ΔNC11, and Mcl-1ΔNC23 bound to Bim, Bmf, and Noxa, but not Bad (Fig. 2C and data not shown).2 We therefore concluded that a detailed analysis of the structure of Mcl-1ΔNC23, which in contrast to Mcl-1ΔNC11 could be readily purified in large quantities, would provide a framework for understanding the molecular basis of selective binding by prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins. Importantly, such a structure would provide the first view of the prosurvival subclass composed of Mcl-1 and A1, which have binding properties distinct from those of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w.2 Solution Structure of Mcl-1—The favorable NMR line widths and solution stability found for Mcl-1ΔNC23 (162 residues in total: residues 152–308 of mouse Mcl-1 (Fig. 1) and 5 additional N-terminal residues, GPLGS, arising from cloning artifacts) allowed spectral acquisition and chemical shift assignment to proceed. Resonance assignments were determined using a series of heteronuclear three-dimensional NMR methods on 13C and 15N isotopically labeled protein (24Sattler M. Schleucher J. Griesinger C. Prog. Nucl. Magn. Reson. Spectrosc. 1999; 34: 93-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1399) Google Scholar). Complete assignment of the backbone resonances (HN, N, Cα, Hα, C′) was realized, along with 91% of all non-exchangeable side chain resonances of non-Gly residues. The remaining 13 non-Gly residues had partial side chain assignment. Structures were calculated based on a total of 3507 NMR-derived distance constraints and 335 angle restraints. The ensemble of 20 low energy structures refined in XPLOR-NIH (29Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J.J. Tjandra N. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2003; 160: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar) is shown in Fig. 3A, and a ribbon representation of the structure closest to the geometric mean in Fig. 3B. Table I enumerates the structural statistics for Mcl-1ΔNC23, showing they are an energetically reasonable NMR ensemble displaying acceptable covalent geometry with all residues lying in allowed areas of the Ramachandran plot. The three-dimensional structure of Mcl-1ΔNC23 (Fig. 3) has a well defined helical core, with the less ordered regions of the structure located at the N terminus (residues 152–154, in addition to the 5 N-terminal cloning artifacts), C terminus (residues 300–308), and a 12-residue loop (residues 173–184) connecting helices α1 (residues 155–172) and α2 (residues 185–205). Like the other Bcl-2 homologs, Mcl-1 has a central hydrophobic helix, α5 (residues 242–261), surrounded by a set of amphipathic helices that pack against this helix. The hydrophobic BH3 binding groove is formed from α2, α3 (residues 206–214), and α4 (residues 224–233), with α5 and α8 (residues 293–299) forming the base of the groove. A sharp turn connects α5 with the nearly parallel helix, α6 (residues 265–282). Two short helices, α7 (residues 284–289), which is an extension of α6 after a kink at Lys-283, and α8, which is perpendicular to α5, terminate the helical fold. Structural Comparison with Other Bcl-2 Family Members— The topology of the Bcl-2 domain in Mcl-1 is very similar to those of other Bcl-2 homologs. The backbone (Cα,N,C′) r.m.s.d. to Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w are 1.74, 1.88, and 1.96 Å, respectively, over the common secondary structural elements as defined in Fig. 1, showing the structures are in close agreement. There is low sequence identity among the Bcl-2 family. Excluding the N-terminal 151 residues, Mcl-1 shares ∼24% sequence identity and 35–46% similarity with Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, and A1 and is most similar to A1. Mcl-1 and A1 lack the N-terminal BH4 domain, and neither protein shares any significant sequence identity with Bcl-2, Bcl-xL or Bcl-w over this region. Despite lacking this domain, Mcl-1 retains a helix (α1) that has a similar disposition with respect to the helical bundle as seen in the other Bcl-2 molecules. Also, although the sequences differ, Mcl-1 has a short α1-α2 loop with a restricted conformational space, reminiscent of Bcl-w. Equivalent residues in other structures lack any order (33Sattler M.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3012-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). As with other protein families sharing a low level of sequence identity, the Bcl-2 proteins have a conserved three-dimensional scaffold, but the surface features differ. Notably, mouse Mcl-1 contains 14 lysines, 10 of which are found in the Bcl-2 homology domain (Fig. 1), and with the exception of Lys-283 all are solvent-accessible. These residues are not only potential candidates for ubiquitinylation but also contribute to the electrostatic properties of Mcl-1, the surface of which is more electropositive than that of other Bcl-2 proteins. In particular, a number of positively charged residues are present on α3, the α3-α4 loop, and α4 in Mcl-1 (Fig. 1), and the groove to which ligands bind is flanked by positive electrostatic potential (supplemental Fig. 6). In addition, two histidines, His-258 and His-301, are on the periphery and two others, His-233 and His-205, lie in the groove. In comparison, Bcl-xL has an essentially uncharged groove. Small differences in the position of some surface-exposed helices are also apparent. In Mcl-1, α3, which forms part of the binding groove, is extended. In contrast to Bcl-xL, the conformation of α3 is more like that of CED-9 (36Woo J.S. Jung J.S. Ha N.C. Shin J. Kim K.H. Lee W. Oh B.H.

Consequently, in contrast to the published structures of ligand-free molecules, the binding groove on Mcl-1 is in a more open “ready-to-bind” conformation (Fig. 4A). Ligand-free Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and CED-9 have α3 and α4 more tightly packed and aligned in parallel relative to Mcl-1 (F"

Parkinson's disease can be modeled in Drosophila where directed expression of α-synuclein induces compromise of dopaminergic neurons and the formation of Lewy body-like aggregates. The molecular chaperone Hsp70 protects cells from the deleterious effects of α-synuclein, indicating a potential therapeutic approach to enhance neuron survival in Parkinson's disease. We have now investigated the molecular mechanisms by which the drug geldanamycin protects neurons against α-synuclein toxicity. Our studies show that geldanamycin sensitizes the stress response within normal physiological parameters to enhance chaperone activation, offering protection against α-synuclein neurotoxicity. Further, geldanamycin uncouples neuronal toxicity from Lewy body and Lewy neurite formation such that dopaminergic neurons are protected from the effects of α-synuclein expression despite the continued presence of (and even increase in) inclusion pathology. These studies indicate that compounds that modulate the stress response are a promising approach to treat Parkinson's disease.

(1Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Science. 2003; 302: 819-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). Pathologically, PD is typified by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and the formation of Lewy bodies (LBs) and Lewy neurites (LNs), which are electron dense, eosinophilic accumulations of proteins in the cell bodies and neuritic processes of affected neurons. The loss of dopaminergic neurons is primarily responsible for the bradykinetic movements, cog-wheel rigidity, and tremors that characterize this disease. Although PD is typically sporadic, rare hereditary forms have yielded new etiologic insights. α-Synuclein, the first gene linked to hereditary PD (2Kruger R. Kuhn W. Muller T. Woitalla D. Graeber M.

Expression of both wild-type and mutant α-synuclein in Drosophila has consistently shown both inclusion formation and age-dependant degeneration of dopaminergic neurons (9Auluck P.K. Chan H.Y.

Nature. 2000; 404: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). Progressive loss of neuronal integrity is preventable in flies genetically through the directed expression of Hsp70 (9Auluck P.K. Chan H.Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Bonini N.M. Science. 2002; 295: 865-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar), a molecular chaperone involved in nascent chain folding and refolding of misfolded proteins (11Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2397) Google Scholar). Further, up-regulation of Hsp70 mitigates toxic properties of α-synuclein in transgenic mouse models (12Klucken J. Shin Y. Masliah E. Hyman B.T. McLean P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25497-25502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). α-Synuclein toxicity in Drosophila can also be prevented pharmacologically with geldanamycin (GA) (13Auluck P.K. Bonini N.M. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1185-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), an ansamycin antibiotic currently in clinical trials as an anti-cancer agent (14Bagatell R. Paine-Murrieta G.D. Taylor C.W. Pulcini E.J. Akinaga S. Benjamin I.J. Whitesell L. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 3312-3318PubMed Google Scholar). Although existing pharmacological therapies for PD help to relieve patient symptoms, they fail to address the underlying cause, the loss of dopaminergic cells. Therefore GA represents a new class of cytoprotective drugs for the treatment of this disease. GA has been pursued as a therapeutic agent for cancers associated with abnormally elevated levels of receptor tyrosine kinase activity (15Blagosklonny M.V. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have shown that GA acts by binding to the ATP-binding domain of Hsp90 and inhibiting its ATP-dependent activities (16Whitesell L. Mimnaugh E.G. De Costa B. Myers C.E. Neckers L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). Hsp90 is a ubiquitous chaperone implicated in a number of signaling cascades (15Blagosklonny M.V. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) as well as the stabilization of nuclear hormone receptors (17Richter K. Buchner J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 188: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vitro studies have shown that Hsp90 negatively regulates stress pathways by binding to and inhibiting activation of its central mediator, heat shock transcription factor (HSF) (18Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3788-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar, 19Zou J. Guo Y. Guettouche T. Smith D.F. Voellmy R. Cell. 1998; 94: 471-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). However, despite these studies elucidating actions of GA and its promise for therapeutics, little has been done to address its activity and targets in vivo. Invertebrates have been used successfully to identify pathways involved in diverse processes ranging from neurodegenerative disease to aging (20Helfand S.L. Science. 2002; 295: 809-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 21Driscoll M. Gerstbrein B. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 181-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Here, we use our Drosophila model for PD to identify the pathways required for neuroprotection by GA in vivo. We demonstrate that GA modulates the stress response thereby affecting α-synuclein pathology and solubility. These studies emphasize the importance of the molecular chaperones to neuronal integrity in PD and suggest a role for chaperones in the promotion of protective α-synuclein inclusions.

Heat Shock and Immunoblot Analysis—Flies of appropriate age, genotype, and treatment condition were lightly anesthetized, collected into 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes, allowed to recovered at 25 °C for 1 h, and then heat stressed in a Thermomixer (Eppendorf, Westbury, NY). Sixteen fly heads were solubilized in Laemmli buffer (75 μl) and separated by 18% Tris-Tricine polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Protein was transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with primary antibody (rat anti-fly inducible Hsp70 (7fB, 1:4000, gift of S. Lindquist), mouse anti-human α-synuclein (syn204, 1:10, gift of V. M.-Y. Lee), and tubulin (E7, 1:10,000, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA)) followed by secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse, goat anti-rabbit, goat anti-rat, Chemicon, Temecula, CA). Immunohistochemistry—Fly heads were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, serially sectioned, and immunostained with rabbit anti-human TH antibody (1:150, Pelfreez, Rogers, AR) as described previously (9Auluck P.K. Chan H.Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Bonini N.M. Science. 2002; 295: 865-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). For each data point, complete serial sections from three to five brains were examined. Protein Solubility Assay—Twenty flies of appropriate age, genotype, and treatment condition were flash-frozen in dry-ice/ethanol and then homogenized in high salt buffer (HS, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 750 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science)) and serially extracted at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C through HS twice, HS + 1% Triton X-100 twice, HS + 1 m sucrose, RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS), SDS buffer (SDS, 5% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 175 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA), and SDS + 8 m urea. Supernatant samples were analyzed by immunoblot. GA Enhances the Stress Response—Previous studies have described selective toxicity of α-synuclein toward the dorsomedial (DM) dopaminergic neuronal cluster in the Drosophila brain. In 20-day-old flies, loss of TH staining is observed in ∼50% of the DM neurons by paraffin sectioning (9Auluck P.K. Chan H.Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Bonini N.M. Science. 2002; 295: 865-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). A similar decrease in TH staining is seen only in the DM clusters by whole mount immunofluorescence of the fly brain; other dopaminergic neuronal clusters appear resistant to α-synuclein expression (see supplemental Fig. S1). We have reported that treating flies with GA protects against α-synuclein neurotoxicity (13Auluck P.K. Bonini N.M. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1185-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). To understand mechanisms of action of GA, we first examined the effects of GA on the stress response, detected by levels of the stress-induced form of Hsp70. In Drosophila, GA induces Hsp70 protein synthesis in a concentration-dependent manner (13Auluck P.K. Bonini N.M. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1185-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Specifically, a small increase in Hsp70 levels is detectable in flies fed 12 μg/ml GA with a 2–3-fold increase above baseline in flies fed higher concentrations (96 μg/ml). However, flies fed 3 μg/ml GA (a concentration sufficient to protect neurons against α-synuclein toxicity) do not exhibit elevated levels of Hsp70 above baseline (13Auluck P.K. Bonini N.M. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1185-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Therefore we hypothesized that GA might be enhancing the endogenous stress response rather than directly inducing heat shock protein synthesis. Stress response proteins are rapidly induced in response to changes in temperature. In Drosophila, Hsp70 mRNA and protein levels are maximally induced at 37 °C (27Lindquist S. Dev. Biol. 1980; 77: 463-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Upon heat shock, mRNA levels begin to rise within 4 min, and an increase in newly synthesized Hsp70 is detected within 8–12 min with a plateau in protein synthesis occurring after 30–45 min of continuous heat shock (27Lindquist S. Dev. Biol. 1980; 77: 463-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). We focused our analysis on the early phase of Hsp70 induction. Newly eclosed control flies (w1118), driver line alone (elavC115), and transgene insert alone (w1118;;UAS-α-syn)) and flies expressing α-synuclein throughout the nervous system (elavC115;;UAS-α-syn/+) were fed placebo or 3 μg/ml GA for 48 h prior to heat shock for 15 min at 37 °C. Flies were then flash-frozen, and induced Hsp70 levels were examined by immunoblot of fly heads. Our analysis revealed that GA treatment did not enhance maximal levels of Hsp70 induction compared with placebo-fed flies (Fig. 1A). Given that the maximum stress response appeared unaffected by GA, we therefore examined GA treatment at submaximal stress-inducing temperatures. Newly eclosed w1118 flies were fed placebo or GA for 3 days, heat shocked for 15 min at temperature increments between 25 °C (no heat stress) and 37 °C (maximal heat stress), and then analyzed for elevation of stress-induced Hsp70 levels. As above, the maximal heat shock response at 37 °C was unaltered by GA treatment. However, treatment with 3 μg/ml GA consistently enhanced Hsp70 protein levels in flies heat stressed between 30 °C and 33 °C (n = 5, Fig. 1B). At 31 °C, GA treatment resulted in a 50% of maximum induction of Hsp70. In contrast, placebo-treated flies increased Hsp70 levels by only 10% of maximum. These results reveal that GA treatment reduces the temperature threshold for induction of the heat shock response, facilitating Hsp70 expression. Next we examined whether GA might also prolong the stress response. Newly eclosed w1118 flies were fed GA or placebo for 48 h and then heat stressed for 15 min at 37 °C or 32 °C. After heat shock, the flies were allowed to recover at 25 °C for up to 4.5 h. Stress-induced Hsp70 levels were measured at 30-min intervals. Upon 37 °C heat shock, we found that GA did not alter the kinetics of the stress response; Hsp70 levels rose and fell comparably in both GA- and placebo-treated flies (Fig. 1C). However, upon heat shock at 32 °C, Hsp70 levels in GA-fed flies increased earlier and rose to higher levels when compared with placebo-fed flies (Fig. 1D). Data pooled from four independent experiments revealed a consistent 2-fold amplification of Hsp70 levels in the early induction phase of the stress response at 32 °C over controls at 30 min (Fig. 1E). Thus, GA treatment enhances the stress response and facilitates the early induction of heat shock protein synthesis at submaximal levels of stress. Neuroprotection by GA Requires HSF—In Drosophila, the stress response (including activation of Hsp70) is primarily regulated by HSF. Homozygous disruption of hsf gene activity results in developmental arrest (26Jedlicka P. Mortin M.A. Wu C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2452-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). However, a temperature-sensitive allele, hsf4, which abrogates HSF activity at elevated (non-permissive) temperatures (≥28 °C) but is functional at permissive temperatures (25 °C, Ref. 26Jedlicka P. Mortin M.A. Wu C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2452-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), allowed us to examine whether GA mitigation of α-synuclein toxicity requires hsf function. We confirmed that abolishing HSF activity with the hsf4 allele decreases induction of Hsp70 when flies are oxygen-deprived for 5 min (Fig. 2A and Ref. 26Jedlicka P. Mortin M.A. Wu C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2452-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). We then generated flies expressing α-synuclein that were homozygous for the hsf4 mutant allele (hsf4|α-SYN flies) and asked whether GA was still effective at protecting neurons against α-synuclein toxicity. hsf4|α-SYN flies as well as normal α-synuclein-expressing (α-SYN) flies were allowed to develop at permissive temperatures on normal medium. Upon eclosion, adult flies were transferred to vials containing GA or placebo and aged 1, 10, and 20 days at non-permissive temperatures for HSF activity. TH immunoreactivity of dopaminergic neurons was then quantified. In α-SYN flies aged at non-permissive temperatures (28 °C), TH immunostaining in the DM clusters progressively degenerated from 18.5 ± 0.5 cells at 1 day to 5.7 ± 0.9 cells at 20 days (Fig. 2B). This result is consistent with previous experiments performed at 25 °C (9Auluck P.K. Chan H.Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Bonini N.M. Science. 2002; 295: 865-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar, 13Auluck P.K. Bonini N.M. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1185-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Degeneration at higher temperatures was also suppressed by GA treatment; neuron numbers in the presence of GA were now maintained at 16.0 ± 1.5 cells at 20 days (Fig. 2B). We then performed the same experiment but in the hsf4 mutant background. Loss of TH immunoreactivity in placebo-fed hsf4|α-SYN flies did not differ statistically from that of α-SYN flies. Neuron numbers in the DM clusters decreased from 17.5 ± 2.5 cells at 1 day to 7.3 ± 1.3 cells at 20 days (Fig. 2C). However, in contrast to α-SYN flies, GA treatment of hsf4|α-SYN flies no longer prevented α-synuclein toxicity (Fig. 2C); rather, neurons continued to degenerate over 20 days to 6.7 ± 0.3 cells. Thus GA requires HSF activity for neuroprotection. The Stress Response Modifies α-Synuclein-related Pathology and Solubility—Next we examined placebo- and GA-treated flies for changes in α-synuclein-related pathology. Expression of wild-type or mutant α-synuclein leads to age-dependent accumulation of α-synuclein in LB- and LN-like inclusions (9Auluck P.K. Chan H.Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Bonini N.M. Science. 2002; 295: 865-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar, 10Feany M.B. Bender W.W. Nature. 2000; 404: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). Treatment with GA, like transgenic expression of Hsp70 (9Auluck P.K. Chan H.Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Bonini N.M. Science. 2002; 295: 865-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar), protects neurons despite the continued presence of LB-like inclusions. Between two and four inclusions per fly brain were detectable in both treated and untreated α-SYN flies aged to 20 days (data not shown). Similarly, GA treatment did not alter LN-like deposition in the neuropil adjacent to the DM region of the fly brain (Fig. 3, A and B). However, GA treatment increased LN-like neuritic pathology evident in the optic neuropil (Fig. 3, E and F). We also examined α-synuclein pathology in hsf4|α-SYN flies. Disruption of HSF activity decreased the amount of LN-like pathology in both the DM and optic neuropil (Fig. 3, C and D). Quantification by counting the number of punctate deposits in the DM neuropil revealed an approximate 30% decrease in LN-like pathology in hsf4|α-SYN flies. The formation of LB-like inclusions, however, was not affected; 2–4 inclusions were still evident in 20-day-old hsf4|α-SYN flies. In contrast, treatment with GA did not increase LN-like pathology in hsf4|α-SYN flies (Fig. 3, G and H). To further examine α-synuclein aggregation, we adopted a serial extraction approach used for study of α-synuclein solubility in human disease (28Campbell B.C. Li Q.X. Culvenor J.G. Jakala P. Cappai R. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. McLean C.A. Neurobiol. Dis. 2000; 7: 192-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 29Dickson D.W. Liu W. Hardy J. Farrer M. Mehta N. Uitti R. Mark M.

In control human brain tissue α-synuclein is normally soluble in high salt buffer, whereas in humans with PD or dementia with Lewy bodies α-synuclein is recovered in high salt/Triton X-100-insoluble fractions (28Campbell B.C. Li Q.X. Culvenor J.G. Jakala P. Cappai R. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. McLean C.A. Neurobiol. Dis. 2000; 7: 192-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 29Dickson D.W. Liu W. Hardy J. Farrer M. Mehta N. Uitti R. Mark M. Zimmerman T. Golbe L. Sage J. Sima A. D'Amato C. Albin R. Gilman S. Yen S.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 1241-1251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Similarly, in mice expressing A53T, α-synuclein accumulates in detergent-insoluble fractions to a greater degree than healthier wild-type α-synuclein mice (7Giasson B.I. Duda J.E. Quinn S.M. Zhang B. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Neuron. 2002; 34: 521-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). In light of these findings, we examined whether α-synuclein also accumulates in detergent-insoluble fractions when expressed in the Drosophila brain. The heads of 20-day-old flies expressing α-synuclein in the brain with the elavC155 driver were homogenized in high salt buffer, sequentially extracted through buffers of increasing detergent strength by high speed ultracentrifugation, and examined by Western blot. The majority of α-synuclein was found to be high salt or high salt/Triton X-100 soluble with only a trace amount of protein recoverable in the SDS- and urea-soluble fractions (Fig. 4A). Next we examined whether GA had an effect on the solubility properties of α-synuclein. Flies expressing α-synuclein throughout the brain (with both elavC155 and Ddc-gal4 drivers) were aged to 20 days at 28 °C on placebo- or GA-treated media and were then subjected to serial extraction. Strikingly, we found an increase in the amount of α-synuclein recalcitrant to solubilization in GA-treated flies (Fig. 4A). A similar increase in insoluble α-synuclein was found in flies expressing Hsp70 together with α-synuclein (Fig. 4C). Coexpression of β-galactosidase, which does not suppress α-synuclein toxicity (9Auluck P.K. Chan H.Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Bonini N.M. Science. 2002; 295: 865-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar), did not alter α-synuclein solubility (Fig. 4D). Intriguingly, abrogation of HSF activity with the hsf4 allele only partially prevented GA from increasing the amount of insoluble α-synuclein present; in these flies, insoluble α-synuclein accumulated to a slightly lesser degree than in HSF intact flies (Fig. 4B) although changes in LN-like pathology were minimal (Fig. 3, D and H). Taken together, these data demonstrate a dissociation between α-synuclein aggregation and neurotoxicity, whereby conditions that protect cells from α-synuclein toxicity are associated with an increase in insoluble α-synuclein. These data are consistent with the idea that inclusions may play a protective role. Other Pathways Augmented by GA Do Not Significantly Alter α-Synuclein Toxicity—Our studies demonstrate that GA acts through modulation of the stress response to protect neurons in Drosophila; however it remained possible that additional pathways regulated by Hsp90 might also modify the toxicity of α-synuclein. GA (through its inhibitory activity on Hsp90) may decrease the activity of Ras and ecdysone pathways in vivo (15Blagosklonny M.V. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Given the importance of Ras signaling and steroid hormone receptors in the regulation of cell survival, we examined whether GA may also protect neurons through inhibition of these pathways. We coexpressed a number of transgenes altering different aspects of the Ras and ecdysone pathways and found that neither inhibition of Ras activity nor a decrease in hormone signaling leads to significant suppression of α-synuclein toxicity (see supplemental Tables S1 and S2). However, we did find that increasing Ras activity with the constitutively active Ras64BV14 construct or wild-type Ras1 suppressed α-synuclein toxicity. Further, modulating mitogen-activated protein kinase activity mitigated α-synuclein toxicity, resulting in partial suppression (see supplemental Table S3). These data suggest that alterations in the Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway may also play a role in the pathogenicity of α-synuclein but do not mediate neuroprotective effects of GA. These studies define a potential drug class that promotes the health of dopaminergic neurons in the face of α-synuclein toxicity. Our evidence demonstrates that GA, an ansamycin antibiotic, protects against the neurotoxic effects of α-synuclein through the mobilization of the stress response. When flies are exposed to submaximal levels of heat stress (between 30 °C and 33 °C), GA facilitates Hsp70 induction to higher levels than in placebo-treated flies. This elevation of Hsp70 is significant given our earlier finding that overexpression of Hsp70 abrogates the toxic effects of α-synuclein in Drosophila (9Auluck P.K. Chan H.Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Bonini N.M. Science. 2002; 295: 865-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). Significantly, GA does not alter the basal levels of Hsp70 in control and α-synuclein-expressing flies, suggesting that GA acts only to elevate chaperone levels in stressed cells and does not alter chaperone activity in neighboring, healthier cells. Because α-synuclein expression leads to a focal elevation of inducible Hsp70 in dopaminergic neurons (9Auluck P.K. Chan H.Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Bonini N.M. Science. 2002; 295: 865-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar), these neurons should be preferentially targeted by GA treatment. We have further demonstrated that GA requires intact HSF activity to protect against α-synuclein neurotoxicity. Genetic elimination of HSF activity fully blocks the neuroprotective effects of GA. Furthermore, elimination of HSF activity prevents the induction of the stress response, preventing a rise in Hsp70 levels under conditions of stress. Therefore, we conclude that GA protects against α-synuclein toxicity through mobilization of the stress response and increased Hsp70 levels. Interestingly, in contrast to dominant-negative inhibition of Hsp70 (9Auluck P.K. Chan H.Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Bonini N.M. Science. 2002; 295: 865-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar), decreased HSF activity was not associated with accelerated dopaminergic cell loss. This finding likely reflects the fact that basal levels of Hsp70 and other chaperone proteins are not affected by alteration of HSF activity. Although our studies demonstrated that GA acts through the stress response to protect neurons, it remained possible that additional pathways regulated by Hsp90 (and therefore affected by GA treatment) might also modify α-synuclein toxicity. Our experiments here demonstrate that neither decreased Ras activity nor decreased ecdysone (steroid hormone) signaling contributes toward cell survival, although we did find that increased Ras activity protects against α-synuclein toxicity, which is opposite of the known effects of GA on the Ras pathway. Although GA-mediated changes in Ras activity likely do not contribute toward the neuroprotective activity of GA, our studies suggest that manipulation of the Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway modifies α-synuclein toxicity, consistent with evidence suggesting that α-synuclein may be phosphorylated (30Okochi M.

Kanuka H. Fujiwara H. Koyama A. Hasegawa M. Miura M. Iwatsubo T. Neurosci. Lett. 2003; 336: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). That GA-mediated enhancement of chaperone activity and Hsp70 overexpression both suppress α-synuclein neurotoxicity suggests that elevated chaperone levels may be associated with alteration of α-synuclein solubility. α-Synuclein has been shown to polymerize and form β-pleated sheet amyloid conformations under disease-related conditions (32Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2552-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 33Giasson B.I. Murray I.V. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2380-2386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar) and to deposit in LBs, LNs, and glial cytoplasmic inclusions in disease brains (4Baba M. Nakajo S.

Nature. 1997; 388: 839-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (5871) Google Scholar). Flies similarly develop LB- and LN-like inclusions (9Auluck P.K. Chan H.Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Bonini N.M. Science. 2002; 295: 865-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar, 10Feany M.B. Bender W.W. Nature. 2000; 404: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). However, we found that these LB-like inclusions persist under conditions that elevate Hsp70 levels, and LN-like pathology even increases in response to GA treatment. In contrast, inhibition of HSF activity reduces the LN-like pathologic burden found in the brains of aged α-synuclein-expressing flies. Using a serial extraction protein solubility assay, we found that treatment with GA and Hsp70 overexpression are both associated with increased amounts of insoluble α-synuclein. In effect, we found a discordance between α-synuclein solubility and toxicity; under chaperone-associated neuroprotection, dopaminergic neurons are unaffected by α-synuclein toxicity despite the continued presence of LB- and LN-like deposits and an overall increase the insoluble α-synuclein component. We previously noted that LB-like aggregates form preferentially in the DL-1 and DL-2 neuronal clusters (9Auluck P.K. Chan H.Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Bonini N.M. Science. 2002; 295: 865-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar), which are resistant to α-synuclein toxicity. These data are inconsistent with hypotheses that the large protein aggregates are toxic, and rather support the idea that in PD and other LB-related diseases protein inclusions may be unrelated or protective with Hsp70 acting to shuttle toxic forms of α-synuclein into inclusions. Recent cell culture data from studies on toxic polyglutamine protein of Huntington's disease lend support to our results in that neurons that developed disease-related inclusion bodies exhibited enhanced survival compared with those neurons which did not form inclusions (34Arrasate M. Mitra S. Schweitzer E.S. Segal M.R. Finkbeiner S. Nature. 2004; 431: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar). Moreover, Hsp70 transiently associates with such inclusion bodies in cells in culture, potentially assisting their formation (35Kim S. Nollen E.A. Kitagawa K. Bindokas V.P. Morimoto R.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 826-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In a cell culture α-synuclein model, GA pretreatment decreases the formation of α-synuclein inclusions (36McLean P.J. Klucken J. Shin Y. Hyman B.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 321: 665-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and decreases basal levels of α-synuclein suggesting that in this in vitro model GA either decreases the expression of α-synuclein or increases its turnover through enhanced degradation. Although we see no gross changes in α-synuclein levels, we cannot discount the possibility that GA and Hsp70 may also be affecting precursor protofibrillar or other forms of α-synuclein through the mobilization of the ubiquitin proteasome (37Imai Y.

Indeed, the multipotent ability of chaperones to decrease levels of toxic α-synuclein species, shuttle and maintain the protein into inclusion bodies, and/or maintain the protein in non-toxic conformations should all have the same outcome of preventing neurodegeneration. The importance of chaperone pathways in PD has recently come under careful scrutiny with the following observations: elevated chaperone activity suppresses toxic effects of α-synuclein in Drosophila (9Auluck P.K.

Here, we have used an in vivo model for PD to study the neuroprotective activity of GA.

https://openalex.org/W1595954641,"The complex shapes of biominerals cannot be explained with simple mechanistic models of crystal growth. In their Perspective,
 De Yoreo and Dove,
 argue that the popular stereochemical recognition model, which postulates that some shapes are stabilized through the binding of peptides and proteins to otherwise unstable faces, is not the full answer, either. According to recent studies, specific interactions between growth modifiers such as proteins and the edges of individual steps on existing crystal faces change the elementary step change to generate a similarly modified bulk crystal shape. The emergence of new faces is a macroscopic manifestation of the kinetics caused by molecular-scale interactions at the step edges."
https://openalex.org/W2124437957,"The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a key role in normal and pathological angiogenesis by mediating extracellular matrix degradation and/or controlling the biological activity of growth factors, chemokines, and/or cytokines. Specific functions of individual MMPs as anti- or proangiogenic mediators remain to be elucidated. In the present study, we assessed the impact of single or combined MMP deficiencies in in vivo and in vitro models of angiogenesis (malignant keratinocyte transplantation and the aortic ring assay, respectively). MMP-9 was predominantly expressed by neutrophils in tumor transplants, whereas MMP-2 and MMP-3 were stromal. Neither the single deficiency of MMP-2, MMP-3, or MMP-9, nor the combined absence of MMP-9 and MMP-3 did impair tumor invasion and vascularization in vivo. However, there was a striking cooperative effect in double MMP-2:MMP-9-deficient mice as demonstrated by the absence of tumor vascularization and invasion. In contrast, the combined lack of MMP-2 and MMP-9 did not impair the in vitro capillary outgrowth from aortic rings. These results point to the importance of a cross talk between several host cells for the in vivo tumor promoting and angiogenic effects of MMP-2 and MMP-9. Our data demonstrate for the first time in an experimental model that MMP-2 and MMP-9 cooperate in promoting the in vivo invasive and angiogenic phenotype of malignant keratinocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2040892797,"The gene duplication rate in the yeast genome is estimated without assuming the molecular clock model to be approximately 0.01 to 0.06 per gene per billion years; this rate is two orders of magnitude lower than a previous estimate based on the molecular clock model. This difference is explained by extensive concerted evolution via gene conversion between duplicated genes, which violates the assumption of the molecular clock in the analyses of duplicated genes. The average length of the period of concerted evolution and the gene conversion rate are estimated to be approximately 25 million years and approximately 28 times the mutation rate, respectively."

To gain more insights into the effects of these alterations, we created mice carrying a conditional deletion of the Apc tumor suppressor gene specifically in the renal epithelium. As expected, the loss of Apc leads to increased levels of β-catenin protein in renal epithelium. Most of these mice die shortly after birth, and multiple kidney cysts were found upon histological examination. Only rarely did these animals survive to adulthood. Analysis of these adults revealed severely cystic kidneys associated with the presence of renal adenomas. Our results confirm an important role for proper regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in renal development and provide evidence that dysregulation of the pathway can initiate tumorigenesis in the kidney.

Our results confirm an important role for proper regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in renal development and provide evidence that dysregulation of the pathway can initiate tumorigenesis in the kidney. Kidney disease is a major worldwide health problem. In the United States alone, ∼4.5% of adults over 20 years of age (7.4 million persons) have physiological evidence of chronic kidney disease as determined by a moderately or severely reduced glomerular filtration rate (1Initiative K/DOQI Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Am. J. Kid. Dis. 2002; 39: S1-S266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Polycystic kidney diseases are one of the major types of kidney disease and are found in 5–10% of patients who require dialysis (2Zerres K. Watson M.L. Torres V.E. Polycystic Kidney Disease. Oxford University Press, Oxford, New York, Tokyo1996: 167-188Google Scholar). Another renal disease associated with high morbidity and mortality is renal cell carcinoma (RCC). 1The abbreviations used are: RCC, renal cell carcinoma; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; H&E, hematoxylin/eosin; LCM, laser capture microdissection; Ab, antibody; GSK, glycogen synthase kinase; DBA, Dolichos biflorus agglutinin. Approximately 32,000 new cases of RCC are diagnosed each year in the United States (3Jemal A. Thomas A. Murray T. Thun M. CA Cancer J. Clin. 2002; 52: 23-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (2931) Google Scholar), and almost 12,000 deaths each year are caused by this cancer. Whereas great progress has been made recently in identifying genetic changes underlying kidney diseases, more needs to be done to effectively address these important clinical problems. This includes work to characterize the signaling pathways related to these diseases and to create model systems on which the factors that initiate these diseases can be assessed. One attractive candidate for such a signaling pathway is the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Wnts are a family of secreted proteins that bind to a receptor complex including a frizzled molecule and either Lrp5 or Lrp6. This binding initiates an intracellular signaling cascade that eventually results in the stabilization of the cytoplasmic β-catenin protein (4Nelson W.J. Nusse R. Science. 2004; 303: 1483-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2242) Google Scholar). β-Catenin is a multifunctional protein, which, in addition to its roles in Wnt signaling, also mediates cell-cell adhesion by linking cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton (4Nelson W.J. Nusse R. Science. 2004; 303: 1483-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2242) Google Scholar). Normally, the cytoplasmic (non-cadherin-associated) levels of β-catenin are low because of the constitutive activity of the serine/threonine protein kinase glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3). In the absence of an upstream Wnt signal, GSK3 phosphorylates β-catenin on serine and threonine residues in its N terminus, targeting it for ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. When the appropriate Wnts are present, GSK3 kinase activity is inhibited, leading to stabilization of β-catenin in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Nuclear β-catenin associates with members of the Lef/TCF family of DNA-binding proteins, leading to up-regulation of specific target genes (4Nelson W.J. Nusse R. Science. 2004; 303: 1483-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2242) Google Scholar). Alterations in β-catenin regulation are very common in human tumors (5Moon R.T. Kohn A.D. DeFerrari G.V. Kaykas A. Nat. Rev. Gen. 2004; 5: 689-699Crossref Scopus (1589) Google Scholar). One way that this occurs is via loss of the APC tumor suppressor gene. APC is necessary for the proper regulation of β-catenin; in its absence, β-catenin is not degraded via GSK3-dependent phosphorylation (5Moon R.T. Kohn A.D. DeFerrari G.V. Kaykas A. Nat. Rev. Gen. 2004; 5: 689-699Crossref Scopus (1589) Google Scholar). APC mutations underlie familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome, in which affected patients develop hundreds of colon polyps, some of which progress to full-blown carcinomas (6Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1996; 87: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4274) Google Scholar). These patients carry germline-inactivating mutations in the APC gene, and loss of the wild-type copy leads to polyp initiation. In addition, ∼85% of all sporadically occurring colon tumors have inactivation of both APC alleles (6Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1996; 87: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4274) Google Scholar). In all cases, the loss of APC is associated with stabilization of the β-catenin protein in the cytoplasm. Mutations in β-catenin itself, which eliminate the sites phosphorylated by GSK3, are also found in colon tumors as well as many other tumor types (5Moon R.T. Kohn A.D. DeFerrari G.V. Kaykas A. Nat. Rev. Gen. 2004; 5: 689-699Crossref Scopus (1589) Google Scholar). Several studies have linked alterations in β-catenin regulation to normal kidney development and to kidney disease (7Vainio S.J. Uusitalo M.S. Pediatr. Nephrol. 2000; 15: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and proper regulation of Wnt signaling is necessary for normal renal development (7Vainio S.J. Uusitalo M.S. Pediatr. Nephrol. 2000; 15: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For example, there are studies that link β-catenin to proper regulation of the PKD1 promoter (8Rodova M. Islam M.R. Maser R.L. Calvet J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29577-29583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). PKD1 is mutated in ∼85% of patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) (9Wilson P.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 350: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Also, mutations in the β-catenin gene have been identified in renal cell carcinomas and Wilms' tumors (10Koesters R. Ridder R. Kopp-Schneider A. Betts D. Adams V. Niggli F. von Knebel Briner J. Doeberitz M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3880-3882PubMed Google Scholar, 11Zhu X. Kanai Y. Saito A. Kondo Y. Hirohashi S. Pathol.

Finally, expression of a form of β-catenin in which the N-terminal 131 amino acids are deleted induces early development of polycystic kidney disease in a mouse model (13Saadi-Kheddouci S. Berrebi D. Romagnolo B. Cluzeaud F. Peuchmaur M. Kahn A. Vandewalle A. Perret C. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5972-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Recently, promoter methylation of the APC gene associated with its down-regulation was found in human RCC (14Battagli C. Uzzo R.G. Ibanez de Dulaimi E. Caceres I. Krassenstein R. Al-Saleem T. Greenberg R.E. Cairns P. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8695-8699PubMed Google Scholar). While the major function of APC is thought to be its regulation of β-catenin, APC also interacts with a multitude of other cellular proteins including axin, plakoglobin, asef, kinesin superfamily-associated protein 3 (KAP3), EB1, microtubules, and the human homolog of Drosophila Discs large (hDLG) (15Lee E.

Thus, APC can potentially regulate many cellular functions including intercellular adhesion (17Fearnhead N.S. Britton M.P. Bodmer W.F. Hum. Mol.

Nature. 2003; 421: 753-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Given its important role in regulating β-catenin and other cellular processes as well as its down-regulation in some RCCs, we decided to directly test whether loss of Apc leads to the development of kidney disease in a mouse model. To do this, we conducted the present study by using the cre-lox system (25Sauer B. Methods. 1998; 14: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar) to specifically inactivate the Apc gene in mouse kidney. Ksp-cadherin is a tissue-specific member of the cadherin family that is expressed exclusively in the tubular epithelial cells of the kidney and the developing genitourinary (GU) tract (26Shao X. Johnson J.E. Richardson J.A. Hiesberger T. Igarashi P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 1824-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Recently, Ksp-Cre transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the Ksp-cadherin promoter have been established (27Shao X. Somlo S. Igarashi P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 1837-1846Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Mice containing a floxed allele of Apc (Apc580S) have been previously reported (28Shibata H. Toyama K. Shioya H. Ito M. Hirota M. Hasegawa S. Matsumoto H. Takano H. Akiyama T. Toyoshima K. Kanamaru R. Kanegae Y. Saito I. Nakamura Y. Shiba K. Noda T. Science. 1997; 278: 120-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). We generated mice homozygous for the Apc-flox allele that also contained the Ksp-Cre transgene (Ksp-Cre;Apc580S/580S). We report here that these mice develop early-onset polycystic kidney disease that results in neonatal death in the large majority of these mice. The rare surviving animals develop severe cystic disease, with some of the cysts having an appearance consistent with a diagnosis of cystic nephroblastoma or renal adenoma. Transgenic Mice and Genotyping—Ksp-Cre transgenic mice containing 1.3 kb of the Ksp-cadherin promoter linked to the coding region of Cre recombinase were established previously (27Shao X. Somlo S. Igarashi P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 1837-1846Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Apc580S mice, carrying a pair of loxP sites that flank Apc exon 14 and a PGK-Neo cassette, (28Shibata H. Toyama K. Shioya H. Ito M. Hirota M. Hasegawa S. Matsumoto H. Takano H. Akiyama T. Toyoshima K. Kanamaru R. Kanegae Y. Saito I. Nakamura Y. Shiba K. Noda T. Science. 1997; 278: 120-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) were generated from ES cells obtained from Tetsuo Noda. Genotyping was performed by PCR analysis of tail DNA. The primers used for Cre recombinase genotyping were as follows: 5′-CGATGCAACGAGTGATGAGGTTC-3′ (CreF) and 5′-GCACGTTCACCGGCATCAAC-3′ (CreR). Apc580S genotyping was carried out using the following primers: 5′-GTTCTGTATCATGGAAAGATAGGTGG-3′(APC-flox-P3) and 5′-CACTCAAAACGCTTTTGAGGGTTGAT-3′ (Apc-flox-P4). Histology, Immunohistochemistry, and Immunofluorescent Staining—The mice were mainly euthanized by continuous inhalation of CO2. In some cases, 2.5% avertin (2,2,2-tribromoethanol), 0.5–0.6 ml, was injected intraperitoneally for immobilization of the mice, followed by the intraventricular perfusion of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 4% paraformaldehyde for tissue fixation. The kidneys were isolated and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin overnight, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 3- to 4-μm thickness. A part of the sections were stained in hematoxylin/eosin (H&E). For immunohistochemical staining, the sections were deparaffinized and epitope retrieval was performed by heating the sections at 95 °C in 10 mm citrate buffer pH 6.0 for 25 min. After treating in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 30 min in room temperature, the sections were blocked by normal sera according to the instructions for the VECTASTAIN Elite ABC kit (POD; Vector Laboratories), incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight, visualized by VECTASTAIN Elite ABC kit, and counterstained in hematoxylin. The primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-mouse APC polyclonal Ab (1:100, SC-896, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-β-catenin mouse monoclonal Ab (1:100, cat. no. 610154, BD Biosciences Pharmingen), and rat anti-mouse Ki-67 monoclonal Ab (1:25, TEC-3, DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark). For the immunofluorescent and lectin staining, the paraformaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections were dewaxed, rehydrated in graded ethanol, washed in PBS, and then pretreated with 10 mm sodium citrate (pH 6.0) in a microwave oven for 20 min or PBS containing 20 μg/ml proteinase K at room temperature for 15 min. Sections were blocked in PBS containing 10% goat serum, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and/or 1:5 mouse IgG, then incubated with the following antibodies: rabbit anti-Tamm Horsfall protein at 1:100 dilution (gift from J. Hoyer, University of Pennsylvania), rabbit anti-Na-K-Cl cotransporter (NKCC2) at 1:400 dilution (gift from M. Knepper, National Institutes of Health), rabbit anti-Na-Cl cotransporter (NCC) at 1:100 dilution (gift from M. Knepper) (48Kim G.H. Masilamani S. Turner R. Mitchell C. Wade J.B. Knepper M.A. Proc.

Pontoglio, Pasteur Institute) (49Gresh L. Fischer E. Reimann A. Tanguy M. Garbay S. Shao X. Hiesberg T. Fiette L. Igarashi P. Yaniv M. Pontoglio M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1657-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), and/or mouse anti-acetylated tubulin at 1:1000 dilution (Sigma-Aldrich). In some experiments (Fig. 10, F and H), the antibody was preincubated in PBS containing 25 μg/ml blocking peptide (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 30 min at room temperature. After incubation with the primary antibody for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C, sections were washed in PBS and incubated with 1:400 dilution of anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG conjugated to cyanine 3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes), or Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes). Some sections were co-stained with TRITC-coupled Dolichos biflorus agglutinin or FITC-coupled Lotus tetragonolobus agglutinin (Vector Laboratories), as described previously (25Sauer B. Methods. 1998; 14: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Slides were mounted in Vectashield (Vector) containing 1:1000 DAPI and photographed under epifluorescence illumination using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope. Images were analyzed using OpenLab software (Improvision). Sections from mutant and wild-type animals were treated identically and photographed under identical exposure conditions. Sections for double immunofluorescent staining were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and then boiled in 10 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 10 min to increase antigen exposure. Nonspecific antibody-binding sites in the tissue sections were blocked by incubation in 5% donkey serum (30 min at room temperature). The sections were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with both the rabbit anti-Apc (1:50) and mouse anti-β-catenin (1:50) antibodies described above. The sections were then washed and incubated in rhodamine-conjugated secondary donkey anti-rabbit (1:150) and FITC-conjugated secondary donkey anti-mouse antibody (1:150) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 30 min at room temperature. Confocal fluorescent microscopy was performed to evaluate the slides. Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM) and PCR Amplification—To confirm that Apc exon 14 had been deleted in the neoplastic renal epithelium, LCM was performed on both neoplastic tissue and histologically normal glomeruli. Sections (8 μm) were cut from the paraffin blocks, stained with H&E, dehydrated through a graded ethanol series to xylene, and then allowed to air dry in a desiccator. LCM was then performed using a PixCell IIe LCM system (Arcturus Engineering, Inc., Mountain View, CA) following manufacturer's protocols. Captured cells attached to the polymer film surface on the CapShur LCM caps (Arcturus Engineering, Inc.) were put directly into 0.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes and incubated with 150 μl of digestion buffer from PicoPure DNA extraction kit (Arcturus Engineering, Inc.) at 65 °C for 24 h. After boiling for 10 min to inactivate the proteinase K in the buffer, the DNA was ready for PCR amplification. Primers were designed to amplify the region flanked by loxP sites in the 580S allele. A third primer specific for the PGK-neo cassette in the Apc580S allele was also used. Sequences were as follows: 5′-CCTGTTCTGCAGTATGTTATCATTC-3′ (P1); 5′-AAGACACCAAGTCCAAAGCACAC-3′ (P2); and 5′-CTATCAGGACATAGCGTTGG-3′ (P3). PCR was performed using Platinum PCR SuperMix High Fidelity (Invitrogen) and 300 nm each primer. Three DNA samples were analyzed: 1) laser-captured renal neoplastic epithelium from a Ksp-Cre(+)/Apc580S/580S mouse; 2) tail DNA from the same mouse, and 3) tail DNA from a mouse homozygous for the wild-type Apc allele. The PCR conditions were the following: 94 °C/2:00 (94 °C/15 s; 55 °C/30 s; 68 °C/2:30) (35×). PCR products were analyzed on a 1% agarose ethidium bromide gel. Blood Chemistry—The blood samples from twelve 1- to 2-day-old neonates in two litters were collected. Among them, there were four Apc580S/580S neonates, five Ksp-Cre/Apc580S/+ neonates, and three Ksp-Cre/Apc580S/580S neonates. The blood samples from four adult litters at the ages of 5–12 weeks old with each of the three different genotypes were also collected. The plasma of the mice was separated by centrifuging the heparinized blood at 3,500 × g for 15 min. For quantitative determination of BUN, the VetScan Chemistry Analyzer (Abaxis, Inc., Union City, CA) was used. The plasma of neonates was diluted 1:5 with saline prior to the measurement. The plasma of adult mice was diluted 1:3. Statistics—Mann-Whitney nonparametric test was applied for the comparisons of the BUN levels. A one-tailed p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Ksp-cre/Apc580S/580S mice develop severe cystic kidney disease associated with kidney neoplasia. The expression of Cre recombinase in Apc580S mice creates an allele that encodes a protein that prematurely truncates the Apc protein at codon 580, creating a functionally null allele (28Shibata H. Toyama K. Shioya H. Ito M. Hirota M. Hasegawa S. Matsumoto H. Takano H. Akiyama T. Toyoshima K. Kanamaru R. Kanegae Y. Saito I. Nakamura Y. Shiba K. Noda T. Science. 1997; 278: 120-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Mice expressing cre under the control of the kidney-specific cadherin (Ksp-Cre) promoter were described previously (27Shao X. Somlo S. Igarashi P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 1837-1846Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). These mice were crossed to mice carrying the floxed allele of Apc (Apc580S/580S)to generate Ksp-cre/Apc580S/+ mice, which were subsequently crossed to Apc580S/580S mice. These matings would be predicted to generate litters in which one-fourth of the mice have the Ksp-Cre;Apc580S/580S genotype. Upon routine monitoring of these litters, we found that several neonates became moribund, necessitating sacrifice. PCR analysis identified these animals as the Ksp-Cre;Apc580S/580S genotype. Analysis of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels in these mice showed significant elevation in the neonatal period (Fig. 1). Histological analysis of kidneys from these neonates revealed the presence of multiple cysts (Fig. 1), consistent with the idea that kidney dysfunction leads to the neonatal death. Most Ksp-Cre/Apc580S/580S mice die within 2–3 days of birth. We genotyped 540 weanling mice (3 weeks of age) resulting from crosses between Ksp-Cre/Apc580S/+ and Apc580S/580S mice. If there were no neonatal lethality associated with loss of Apc in the kidney, one would predict that one-fourth of the resulting offspring present at weaning would be Ksp-Cre/Apc580S/580S. Consistent with the observed neonatal lethality, only 6 of the 540 mice surviving until weaning were of the Ksp-Cre/Apc580S/580S genotype. These animals were noticeably smaller than their littermates (3–4 grams less in weight). Plasma BUN levels were elevated in these animals and they became moribund at 8–12 weeks of age (Fig. 1). Necropsy of these animals revealed the presence of severely enlarged kidneys containing multiple cysts (Fig. 2A). Histological examination of the kidneys showed they contained simple cysts lined by a single layer of epithelial cells; glomerular cysts; multilayered cysts lined by a hyperplastic epithelium; and adenomas (Fig. 2, B and C). Examination of other organs revealed no other abnormalities, and no evidence of metastatic disease was found in the adult Ksp-Cre/Apc580S/580S mice. Confirmation of Apc Loss in the Kidneys of Ksp-Cre/Apc580S/580S Mice—To verify that cre-mediated recombination results in loss of Apc in the kidney, we performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) and PCR-based assays. IHC for Apc protein revealed expression in tubules of control animals (Fig. 3, B and C), and loss of Apc expression in the hyperplastic epithelial lining of cysts (Fig. 3D). Consistent with the incomplete penetrance of cre expression in kidney tubules, mosaic expression of cre is observed in some kidney tubules (Fig. 3D). To verify on the genomic level that Apc was lost in kidney cells, we isolated cells in the hyperplastic cyst walls by laser capture microdissection and performed PCR analysis (Fig. 3F). Deletion of exon 14 in the Apc gene (and thus inactivation of the protein) was confirmed in the hyperplastic epithelial cells (Fig. 3G). Cytoplasmic Levels of β-Catenin Are Elevated in Kidney Cells of Ksp-Cre/Apc580S/580S Mice—We predicted that loss of Apc would lead to elevated levels of cytoplasmic β-catenin. We performed IHC for β-catenin and found that its level was dramatically elevated in Ksp-Cre/Apc580S/580S kidney tissue (Fig. 4). This included elevated levels in the hyperplastic lining of cysts. Again, we observed a mosaic pattern of overexpression in some kidney tubules, consistent with the mosaicism observed for loss of Apc expression (Figs. 3D and 4, E–G). We also anticipated that cell proliferation would be increased in these cystic kidneys. To test this, we stained kidney tissue for the proliferation marker Ki67 and found a dramatic increase in proliferating cells within cysts of Ksp-Cre/Apc580S/580S mice, consistent with deregulated growth (Fig. 4J). Tubular Origin of the Simple Cysts—To assess the tubular origins of the simple cysts, sections from neonate (2-day-old) and adult (8-week-old) Ksp-Cre/Apc580S/580S kidneys were stained by antibodies or lectins that label specific nephron segments. The markers included Lotus tetragonolobus agglutinin (LTA), which labels proximal tubules (26Shao X. Johnson J.E. Richardson J.A. Hiesberger T. Igarashi P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 1824-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar); Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP), which labels thick ascending limbs of loops of Henle and distal tubules (27Shao X. Somlo S. Igarashi P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 1837-1846Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar); Na-K-Cl cotransporter type 2 (NKCC2), which labels thick ascending limbs of loops of Henle (29Takahashi N. Chernavvsky D.R. Gomez R.A. Igarashi P. Gitelman H.J. Smithies O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5434-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar); Na-Cl cotransporter (NCC), which labels distal convoluted tubules (30Wyse B. Ali N. Ellison D.H. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2002; 282: F424-F430Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar); and Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA), which labels collecting ducts (31Zolotnitskaya A. Satlin L.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F825-F836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This analysis showed that cysts were derived from Bowman's capsule, proximal tubules, thick ascending limbs, distal convoluted tubules, and collecting ducts (Fig. 5). These findings are consistent with the known expression of Cre in Ksp-Cre mice in all tubular epithelial cells extending from Bowman's capsule to collecting ducts (27Shao X. Somlo S. Igarashi P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 1837-1846Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Importantly, NKCC2 and NCC, which are normally located in the apical membrane of renal tubular cells (Fig. 5D), were also located in the apical membrane of cyst epithelial cells (Fig. 5, C and E). These results suggested that a major defect in epithelial polarity was not present in kidneys containing Apc-deficient cells. To assess the origins of the cysts, adjacent sections from neonate and adult Ksp-Cre/Apc580S/580S kidneys were co-stained with LTA, THP, NKCC2, and DBA. The percentages of simple cysts that were labeled with each marker were then measured. Only those cysts that could be unequivocally identified in adjacent sections were scored. At 2 days, 43% of cysts were labeled with LTA, indicating proximal tubule origin; 19% expressed THP and/or NKCC2, indicating thick ascending limb of loop of Henle origin; and 34% were labeled with DBA, indicating collecting duct origin. 5% of the cysts were not labeled with any of the markers tested. At 8 weeks of age, 7% of cysts were labeled with LTA, 19% expressed THP and/or NKCC2, 9% were labeled with DBA, and 65% were not labeled with any of the markers. The larger number of cysts that did not express any markers at 8 weeks of age compared with 2 days of age suggests that the cyst epithelial cells were progressively de-differentiated. Simple cysts, multilayered cysts, and adenomas all expressed E-cadherin in the plasma membrane at sites of cell-cell contact, indicating that they were epithelial in origin (Fig. 6). Antibody staining showed that simple cysts derived from collecting ducts (evidenced by labeling with DBA) expressed aquaporin-2 (Fig. 6C) and aquaporin-3 (Fig. 6D). Moreover, similar to what is found in normal collecting ducts, aquaporin-2 was localized exclusively in the apical membrane, whereas aquaporin-3 was localized exclusively in the basolateral membrane, further indicating the absence of a defect in epithelial cell polarity. In contrast, the large multilayered cysts and adenomas observed in the older kidneys were labeled with DBA, indicating that they originated from collecting ducts. However, the cells comprising these structures did not express aquaporin-2 or aquaporin-3, indicating that they were relatively undifferentiated. Expression of Polycystin-2, Polycystin-1, Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor-1β, and the Presence of Cilia—Given the potential relationship between Wnt signaling and polycystins (32Wilson P.D. J. Am. Soc.

https://openalex.org/W2006230041,"Elastin is known to self-aggregate in twisted-rope filaments. However, an ultrastructural organization different from the fibrils typical of elastin, but rather similar to those shown by amyloid networks, is shown by the polypeptide sequence encoded by exon 30 of human tropoelastin. To better understand the molecular properties of this sequence to give amyloid fibers, we used CD, NMR, and FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) to identify the structural characteristics of the peptide. In this study, we have demonstrated, by FTIR, that antiparallel β-sheet conformation is predominant in the exon 30 fibers. These physical-chemical studies were combined with transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy to analyze the supramolecular structure of the self-assembled aggregate. These studies show the presence of fibrils that interact side-by-side probably originating from an extensive self-interaction of elemental cross β-structures. Similar sequences, of the general type XGGZG(X, Z = V, L, A, I), are widely found in many proteins such as collagens IV and XVII, major prion protein precursor, amyloid β A4 precursor protein-binding family, etc., thus suggesting that this sequence could be involved in contributing to the self-assembly of amyloid fibers even in other proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2123450431,"Bone metastases represents a common cause of morbidity in patients suffering many types of cancer: breast, lung, kidney, prostate, and multiple myeloma. Osteolytic metastases often cause severe pain, pathologic fractures, hypercalcemia, spinal cord compression, and other nerve-compression syndromes. Osteoclasts (OCs), cells deriving from granulocitic-macrophagic lineage, are responsible for osteolysis, which may be reduced by inhibiting both OCs formation and activity. By studying bone osteolytic metastases mechanism in solid tumors, we report here our findings that cancer patients with bone involvement display an increase in osteoclasts precursors, compared with both healthy controls and cancer patients without bone metastases. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with osteolytic lesions show osteoclastogenesis without adding M-CSF, RANKL, or TNF-alpha. However, these factors are necessary to generate OCs from healthy donors, non-osteolytic patient PBMCs and T-cell depleted PBMCs. OCs derived from cancer patients show more resorption pits than OCs from healthy donors and express genes involved in osteoclastogenesis. Our data show that a spontaneous osteoclastogenesis occurs in patients affected by osteolytic lesions and may be supported by factors released by T lymphocytes. These factors could give a priming to osteoclast precursors and promote osteoclastogenesis. In fact, T-cell depleted PBMCs do not differentiate into OCs without adding M-CSF and RANKL. Moreover, we do not obtain a higher number of OCs by increasing RANKL doses in cultures, and OCs and T lymphocytes mRNA level are detected for TNF-alpha but not for RANKL. The addition of OPG to PBMCs cultures do not modify spontaneous osteoclastogenesis. A neutralizing anti-TNF-alpha antibody in unstimulated PBMC cultures of osteolytic cancer patients induces an inhibition of osteoclastogenesis. These data suggest that TNF-alpha may be responsible for osteoclastogenesis in these tumors."

https://openalex.org/W2140819020,"Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP)-3 is the major insulin-like growth factor (IGF) carrier protein in the bloodstream. IGFBP-3 prolongs the half-life of circulating IGFs and prevents their potential hypoglycemic effect. IGFBP-3 is also expressed in many peripheral tissues in fetal and adult stages. In vitro, IGFBP-3 can inhibit or potentiate IGF actions and even possesses IGF-independent activities, suggesting that local IGFBP-3 may also have paracrine/autocrine function(s). The in vivo function of IGFBP-3, however, is unclear. In this study, we elucidate the developmental role of IGFBP-3 using the zebrafish model.

To determine the role of IGFBP-3 in these tissues, we ablated the IGFBP-3 gene product using morpholino-modified antisense oligonucleotides (MOs). The IGFBP-3 knocked down embryos had delayed pharyngeal skeleton morphogenesis and greatly reduced pharyngeal cartilage differentiation. Knockdown of IGFBP-3 also significantly decreased inner ear size and disrupted hair cell differentiation and semicircular canal formation.

Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) 1The abbreviations used are: IGF, insulin-like growth factor; IGFBP, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MO, morpholino-modified antisense oligonucleotide; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; hpf, hours postfertilization. are evolutionarily conserved polypeptides that are essential for fetal and prenatal growth and survival (1Liu J.P.

Cell. 1993; 75: 73-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar). In extracellular fluids, IGFs are complexed with an IGF-binding protein (IGFBP). Six distinct IGFBPs, designated as IGFBP-1 to -6, have been isolated and cloned from human and other vertebrate species, and each represents an individual gene product (3Clemmons D.R. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 800-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 4Firth S.M. Baxter R.C. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 824-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar, 5Duan C. Ding J. Schlueter P.J. Li Y. Zhang J. Royer T. Acta Zool. Sinica. 2003; 49: 421-431Google Scholar). IGFBP-3 is the most abundant IGFBP in the blood. The majority of the IGFs circulate as a 150-kDa ternary complex that consists of IGF, IGFBP-3 (45 kDa), and acid-labile subunit (88 kDa) (4Firth S.M. Baxter R.C. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 824-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar). When associated with the 150-kDa complex, the IGFs do not readily leave the vascular compartment, and their half-lives are prolonged to 12–15 h in comparison with the 10-min half-life of free IGFs (6Hodgkinson S.C. Davis S.R. Moore L.G. Henderson H.V. Gluckman P.D. J. Endocrinol. 1989; 123: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, the 150-kDa complex serves as a carrier protein of IGFs, protects IGFs from degradation, and prevents the possible hypoglycemic effects of high concentrations of IGFs in the blood. When needed by the organism, IGFs are released from the ternary complex by proteolysis of IGFBP-3 and move across the vascular wall (7Lee C.Y. Rechler M.M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2051-2058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to circulating IGFBP-3 originating from the liver, IGFBP-3 is also synthesized and secreted locally in a variety of fetal and adult tissues (8Cerro J.A. Grewal A. Wood T.L. Pintar J.E.

In vitro, IGFBP-3 significantly inhibited IGF-1-stimulated DNA synthesis in human skin fibroblasts when added together with IGF-1 but potentiated IGF-1 actions when it was preincubated with those cells (4Firth S.M. Baxter R.C. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 824-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that cell surface association of IGFBP-3 is required for potentiation of the bioactivity of IGFs (16Conover C.A. Ronk M. Lombana F. Powell D.R. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 2795-2803Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The cell surface-associated IGFBP-3 has a 10-fold lower affinity for IGF compared with IGFBP-3 in solution (17McCursker R.H. Camacho-Hubner C. Bayne M.L. Cascieri M.A. Clemmons D.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 144: 244-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 18Conover C.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1354-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This switch of binding affinity may result in an equilibrium favoring binding of IGF-I to its receptor and account for the potentiating action of IGFBP-3. Partial proteolysis of IGFBP-3 may also be associated with the potentiation effect because the proteolytic fragments have a much lower affinity for IGF-I (19Conover C.A. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 3191-3199Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that IGFBP-3 possesses biological activities that are ligand-independent. IGFBP-3 inhibited cell growth and accelerated apoptosis in the absence of IGFs and in IGF-1R-null cells (20Valentinis B. Bhala A. DeAngelis T. Baserga R. Cohen C. Mol.

An IGFBP-3 mutant that does not bind to IGFs possesses that same proapoptotic activity (22Hong J. Zhang G. Dong F. Rechler M.M. J. Biol.

The molecular mechanisms underlying the proapoptotic actions of IGFBP-3 are not well understood, but IGFBP-3 has been reported to bind a membrane protein (23Leal S.M. Liu Q.J. Huang S.S. Huang J.S.

Despite a large amount of in vitro data on various possible cellular actions of IGFBP-3 in a wide variety of cultured mammalian cells, the in vivo physiological functions of IGFBP-3 remain unclear. IGFBP-3 knock-out mice were normal in size (32Pintar J.E. Hoang B. Ning Y. Schuller A. Program of the 83rd Annual Meeting of the Endocrine Society, Denver, CO, June 20–23. The Endocrine Society, Denver, CO2001: S31-S33Google Scholar), leaving in question the functional role of IGFBP-3. Several properties of the mouse model have complicated the interpretation of this result. First, the great redundancy in expression patterns among IGFBPs in mouse may mask some developmental role of this IGFBP. Second, altered expression of other IGFBPs may compensate for the loss of IGFBP-3. In support of this view, serum levels of IGFBP-1, -3, and -4 were increased in IGFBP-2 knock-out mice (33Wood T.L. Rogler L.E. Czick M.E. Schuller A.G. Pintar J.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1472-1482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, there exists the possibility of maternal compensation in gene knock-out progeny, via placental circulation. The goal of this study is to determine the in vivo functions of IGFBP-3 in early development using the zebrafish model through both loss- and gain-of-function approaches. The zebrafish has emerged as an informative vertebrate model organism for study of the IGF signaling pathway in early development (5Duan C. Ding J. Schlueter P.J. Li Y. Zhang J. Royer T. Acta Zool.

This genetically tractable vertebrate develops externally, offering an excellent alternative model vertebrate organism in which to study gene and protein function in the absence of maternal compensation. The transparent zebrafish embryos also permit the visualization of tissue and organ formation in real time. Furthermore, major components of the zebrafish IGF signaling pathway, including IGF ligands, IGF receptors, and the intracellular signal transduction network, have been characterized, and they are highly conserved (5Duan C. Ding J. Schlueter P.J. Li Y. Zhang J. Royer T. Acta Zool. Sinica. 2003; 49: 421-431Google Scholar, 34Duan C. J. Nutr. 1998; 128: 306S-314SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Pozios K.C. Ding J.

Endocrinol. 2000; 119: 26-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The whole mount antibody staining was performed as previously reported (36Maures T. Chan S.J. Xu B. Sun H. Ding J. Duan C. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1858-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) using a monoclonal antiacetylated tubulin (Sigma) at 1:1000 dilutions. Morpholino Knockdown—Two morpholino-modified antisense oligonucleotides (MOs) targeted against regions surrounding the translation initiation (AUG) codon in the zebrafish IGFBP-3 gene were designed according to criteria provided by the commercial supplier (Gene Tools, LLC). MO8A (5′-TCACCTCACCTGGATCTATGATTAC-3′) targeted nucleotides –10 to 15, and MO1A (5′-ACACAGTCCCGTCATGGAGCCGAAG-3′) targeted nucleotides –85 to –61. A standard control MO (5′-CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA-3′) was used in all experiments. The MOs were dissolved in 1× Danieau buffer (58 mm NaCl, 0.7 mm KCl, 0.4 mm MgSO4, 0.6 mm CaNO3, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6) and injected into 1–2-cell stage embryos as described below. Microinjection—MO, plasmid DNA, or mRNA was microinjected into embryos at the 1–2-cell stage using drawn glass microcapillary pipettes attached to a micromanipulator. Injection was driven by compressed N2, under the control of a PV830 Pneumatic PicoPump (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). Microinjection volumes were estimated at 1 nl per embryo. In preliminary experiments, control and antisense MOs were injected at 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8 ng/embryo. A nominal concentration of 2 ng of MO8A and 6 ng of MO1A per embryo yielded consistent and reproducible effects, whereas equivalent amounts of control MO-injected embryos were indistinguishable from wild-type embryos. After injection, embryos were placed in embryo rearing medium (41Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book. University of Oregon Press, Eugene, OR1995Google Scholar) and kept at 28.5 °C. Confirmation of MO Specificity—A 201-bp DNA fragment corresponding to the 5′-untranslated region (100 bp containing the MO target regions) and partial coding sequence (111 bp, which encodes the signal peptide and the first 16 residues of the predicted mature protein) of the zebrafish IGFBP-3 gene was generated by PCR (forward primer, 5′-tagaattCTTCGGCTCCATGACGGGACTG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-ataccggtAGCGGACAAGTCAAGCAGCAC-3′; the linker sequences are in lowercase type). The amplified DNA was subcloned in frame into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) using the EcoRI and AgeI sites to fuse the IGFBP-3 partial sequence N-terminally of EGFP. Subsequently, a 934-bp DNA fragment containing the 201-bp IGFBP-3 sequence and the open reading frame of EGFP was released from pEGFP-N1-BP3UTR by digestion with EcoRI and NotI. After the NotI 5′ overhang was filled, the blunt-ended IGFBP-3:EGFP DNA was subcloned into the pCS2+ vector (a gift from Dr. Victoria Prince, University of Chicago) using EcoRI and StuI sites to produce the pCS2+BP3:EGFP reporter construct. To generate a control EGFP reporter construct lacking the MO target sequence, the IGFBP-3 sequence was removed from the pCS2+BP3:EGFP by digestion with EcoRI and AgeI. The resultant pCS2+EGFP DNA was blunt-ended and self-ligated. The orientation and accuracy of sequence were verified by DNA sequencing. Overexpression of IGFBP-3—Two full-length IGFBP-3 expression constructs were engineered for the rescuing experiments. First, a MO-resistant native IGFBP-3 construct was generated by subcloning the entire open reading frame of zebrafish IGFBP-3 (in which 5 bp in the MO targeted sequence was mutated) into the pCS2+ vector. In addition, a DNA fragment containing the entire open reading frame of zebrafish IGFBP-3, in which 5 bp in the MO targeted sequence and stop codon were mutated, was generated by PCR (5′-GAATTCGCCACCATGACAGGTCTGTGTGCGCTC-3′/5′-CGACCGGTGCCTTTGTCTCCATGT-3′) and subcloned into the pCS2+EGFP construct using the EcoRI and AgeI sites, resulting in the pCS2+IGFBP-3-EGFP construct. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. For mRNA synthesis, the plasmids were linearized. Capped mRNA synthesis was carried out using a commercial kit (Megascript kit; Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX) following the manufacturer's instruction. The capped IGFBP-3 or EGFP mRNAs (35 pg/embryo) were introduced into one-cell embryos by microinjection as described above. Cartilage Staining—Alcian blue was used for cartilage staining in fixed larvae following a published procedure (44Kimmel C.B. Miller C.T. Kruse G. Ullmann B. BreMiller R.A. Larison K.D. Snyder H.C. Dev. Biol. 1998; 203: 245-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Briefly, the fixed fish were rinsed with acid-alcohol solution (0.37% HCl, 70% ethanol) and stained for 1 h with Alcian blue (0.1% in acid-alcohol). After several changes of acid-alcohol, the fish were put in 50% glycerol and 0.25% KOH solution overnight and then softened by 1% H2O2. Statistics—Values are means ± S.E. Differences among groups were analyzed by one- or two-way analysis of variance followed by Fisher's least significant difference using Stat View software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Significance was accepted at p < 0.05. Temporal and Spatial Expression Patterns of IGFBP-3 mRNA in Development—Since functional analysis of a gene often relies on its specific temporal and spatial expression pattern to form a testable hypothesis, we first mapped the IGFBP-3 mRNA expression patterns by whole mount in situ hybridization. As shown in Fig. 1, IGFBP-3 mRNA was not detected until 14 h postfertilization (hpf) (A and B), at which point IGFBP-3 mRNA was found in the cranial neural crest cells (C and D, indicated by an arrow). These cells are fated to migrate to the pharyngeal arch region to form each arch segment. At ∼18 hpf, IGFBP-3 mRNA became detectable in the newly formed otic capsule (Fig. 1, G and H, indicated by the white arrowhead) in addition to its prominent expression in cranial neural crest cells (arrow). At 24 hpf, IGFBP-3 was detected in the cranial neural crest cells (arrow) and otic vesicles (inner ears) (white arrowhead) (Fig. 1, I–K). A closer view of the otic vesicle indicates that IGFBP-3 mRNA was specifically expressed by the epithelial cells located in the anterior lower portion (Fig. 1L). This expression pattern persisted until ∼30 hpf. Between 30 and 48 hpf, IGFBP-3 mRNA expression in the otic vesicle was restricted to the two patches of epithelial cells that form the anterior and posterior maculae (Fig. 1, M–P). At 48–60 hpf, IGFBP-3 mRNA was detected in the differentiating pharyngeal arches and in the pectoral fin buds (Fig. 1, Q–S). IGFBP-3 mRNA was no longer detected in these tissues at 72 hpf, but it remained highly expressed in the inner ears (Fig. 1T). The spatial and temporal expression pattern suggests that IGFBP-3 may play a regulatory role in the formation and/or differentiation of pharyngeal arches and inner ears. Effects of IGFBP-3 Knockdown on Pharyngeal Arch and Otic Vesicle Formation and Differentiation—To test whether IGFBP-3 is involved in the formation and/or differentiation of the pharyngeal arches and inner ears (otic vesicles), a MO-based loss-of-function approach was taken. For this, two antisense MOs were designed to target the IGFBP-3 gene. Their efficacy and specificity in knocking down the IGFBP-3 gene product were determined using a reporter construct (pCS2+BP3: EGFP). Microinjection of pCS2+BP3:EGFP DNA into zebrafish embryos yielded mosaic EGFP expression, clearly visible at 24 hpf by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2A). Co-injection of BP3:EGFP DNA with an IGFBP-3-targeting MO abolished BP3:EGFP expression (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained with MO1A. Likewise, EGFP signal was detected in BP3: EGFP-injected but not in wild-type embryos by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2). Co-injection of MO8A abolished the GFP expression, whereas co-injection of a standard control MO or an antisense MO designed against IGFBP-2, a related member in the IGFBP gene family, had no such effect (Fig. 2B, lanes 3–5). The MO knockdown effect is specific, because MO8A did not affect the expression of a control EGFP plasmid that lacks the targeting sequence (Fig. 2B, lanes 6 and 7). Similarly, embryos co-injected with IGFBP-3 MO and an expression plasmid encoding zebrafish IGFBP-2:EGFP fusion protein 2Y. Li and C. Duan, unpublished data. produced embryos with mosaic GFP expression, indicating that the MOs targeted against IGFBP-3 did not suppress translation of a structurally related gene. We next investigated the effects of IGFBP-3 knockdown on the formation and/or differentiation of pharyngeal arches. Control morpholino-injected embryos were morphologically indistinguishable from their wild-type siblings. In comparison, embryos injected with IGFBP-3-targeting MO8A (“morphant” embryos) exhibited underdeveloped otic vesicles and delayed pharyngeal arch formation, most evident at 48 hpf (Fig. 3, A–D). Compared with the control embryos, morphant embryos had greatly reduced lower jaws (Fig. 3D, arrow). The morphants also had edema in the hindbrain region (Fig. 3D, arrowhead). MO1A injection resulted in similar phenotypic changes (data not shown), albeit at a higher dose (6 ng). MO8A was therefore used for subsequent experiments. Pharyngeal cartilages are derived from migrating cranial neural crest cells (45Nissen R.M. Yan J. Amsterdam A. Hopkins N. Burgess S.M. Development. 2003; 130: 2543-2554Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The appearance of pharyngeal arches is a characteristic morphogenic event during the pharyngula period, and it can be monitored by dlx2 mRNA expression (44Kimmel C.B. Miller C.T. Kruse G. Ullmann B. BreMiller R.A. Larison K.D. Snyder H.C. Dev. Biol. 1998; 203: 245-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). At 24 hpf, normal embryos form four pairs of arches: the mandibular, the hyoid, the first, and the second branchial arches. As shown in Fig. 3E, dlx2 mRNA was detected in all four postmigratory crest cells/arches. In comparison, only three postmigratory arch crests were found in the IGFBP-3 knockdown group. Likewise, the knockdown group only had four pairs of crests at 30 hpf, whereas the control embryos had already developed five postmigratory crests at this time (Fig. 3, G and H). We further compared the cartilage pattern in morphant larvae with their sibling controls using Alcian blue staining. Cartilage in neurocranium appeared relatively normal, albeit smaller, in the morphants (Fig. 3, I–L). In contrast, Meckel's and ceratohyal cartilage were absent in the morphants at 72 hpf (Fig. 3J). In addition to neurocranium and the Meckel's and ceratohyal cartilage, there are five branchial arches in the controls at 96 hpf (Fig. 3K). In the morphant group, all five branchial arches were absent, and the size of Meckel's and ceratohyal cartilage was greatly reduced (Fig. 3L). These data suggest that the loss of IGFBP-3 causes a marked delay in pharyngeal arch formation and a reduction in pharyngeal cartilage differentiation. In addition to the pharyngeal skeletal defects, IGFBP-3 morphant embryos also exhibited defects in otic vesicles. Development of the zebrafish otic vesicle begins with the thickening of the epidermal layer into a two-cell-thick placode at 13.5 hpf (the 9-somite stage). The palcode invaginates and forms a lumen (otic vesicle) at about 18 hpf (42Kimmel C.B. Ballard W.W. Kimmel S.R. Ullmann B. Schilling T.F. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 203: 253-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (8862) Google Scholar). Cells in the otic vesicle can be labeled by the expression of claudin-a, which is a major transmembrane protein in tight junctions and is specifically expressed in otic vesicle (46Kollmar R. Nakamura S.K. Kappler J.A. Hudspeth A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10196-10201Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, knockdown of IGFBP-3 had no effect on lumen formation. The otic vesicle contained two otoliths as in the controls. The size of the otic vesicle in the morphants, however, was markedly reduced. claudin-a expression analysis indicated that the reduced otic vesicle size was primarily due to reduced cell number (Fig. 4, C and D; also see Fig. 7B). The hair cells, grouped in two small 2–8-cell patches, begin to appear at 24 hpf. These hair cells can be visualized by antiacetylated tubulin antibody staining (47Haddon C. Lewis J. J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 365: 113-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar; Fig. 4, E and G). In IGFBP-3-knocked down embryos, these hair cells were absent (Fig. 4, F and H), probably due to a lack of hair cell differentiation. From 42 hpf onward, columns of tissue grow out from the walls of the otic vesicle, fusing in the center of the space to generate semicircular canals (45Nissen R.M. Yan J. Amsterdam A. Hopkins N. Burgess S.M. Development. 2003; 130: 2543-2554Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Sensory epithelia called cristae develop in the semicircular canals, which primarily sense angular acceleration. In the control embryo, three semicircle canal protrusions are observed (Fig. 4I). These structures, however, were not seen in any morphant embryos, whereas the two otoliths are present in both groups (Fig. 4J). Whole mount in situ hybridization analysis of control-injected (Fig. 4K), and MO8A-injected (Fig. 4L) embryos at 48 hpf using a claudin-a riboprobe also revealed that the otic vesicle in the morphants remained an empty sac.

Its crystal structure reveals a putative Cys184, His185, and Asp213 catalytic triad similar to that of the Pyrococcus horikoshii protease PH1704, suggesting that it should display a proteolytic activity. A preliminary report has shown that Hsp31 has an exceedingly weak proteolytic activity toward bovine serum albumin and a peptidase activity toward two peptide substrates with small amino acids at their N terminus (alanine or glycine), but the physiological significance of this observation remains unclear. In this study, we report that Hsp31 does not diplay any significant proteolytic activity but has peptidolytic activity. The aminopeptidase cleavage preference of Hsp31 is Ala > Lys > Arg > His, suggesting that Hsp31 is an aminopeptidase of broad specificity. Its aminopeptidase activity is inhibited by the thiol reagent iodoacetamide and is completely abolished in a C185A mutant, which is consistent with Hsp31 being a cysteine peptidase. The aminopeptidase activity of Hsp31 is also inhibited by EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline, in concordance with the importance of the putative His85, His122, and Glu90 metal-binding site revealed by crystallographic studies. An Hsp31-deficient mutant accumulates more 8–12-mer peptides than its parental strain, and purified Hsp31 can transform these peptides into smaller peptides, suggesting that Hsp31 has an important peptidase function both in vivo and in vitro. Proteins interacting with Hsp31 have been identified by reverse purification of a crude E. coli extract on an Hsp31-affinity column, followed by SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. The ClpA component of the ClpAP protease, the chaperone GroEL, elongation factor EF-Tu, and tryptophanase were all found to interact with Hsp31, thus substantiating the role of Hsp31 as both chaperone and peptidase.

Every organism responds to a sudden increase in the environmental temperature by the overexpression of a set of highly conserved heat shock proteins (1Lindquist S. Craig E.A. Annu. Rev.

Most of these heat shock proteins function either as molecular chaperones, assisting in protein folding and renaturation or as proteases which degrade proteins that are beyond rescue. Hsp31, 1The abbreviations used are: Hsp, heat shock protein; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; amc, 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. the hchA gene product (formerly known as YedU), is a heat-inducible homodimeric protein of 31-kDa subunits, which was recently shown to exhibit molecular chaperone activity (3Malki A.

It also prevents the aggregation at 43 °C of citrate synthase and alcohol dehydrogenase and interacts specifically with unfolded proteins (3Malki A. Kern R. Abdallah J. Richarme G. Biochem. Biophys.

Although Hsp31 does not exhibit any ATPase activity, some of its chaperone activities are partially inhibited by ATP (3Malki A. Kern R. Abdallah J. Richarme G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The crystal structure of Hsp31 was solved at 1.6 Å resolution and revealed a system of hydrophobic patches, canyons, and grooves, which may stabilize partially unfolded protein substrates and explain its chaperone activity (5Quigley P.M.

A putative Cys-His-Asp catalytic triad that is only accessible through a small pocket with a length of 14 Å, and an entrance of about 4 Å was also revealed, suggesting that Hsp31 might present a protease or more probably a peptidase activity (5Quigley P.M.

Kern R. Abdallah J. Richarme G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 4Sastry M.S. Korotkov K. Brodsky Y. Baneyx F. J. Biol.

In the present study, we show that Hsp31 is a broad specificity aminopeptidase with a preference for alanine and basic amino acids and that it is inhibited by cysteine protease inhibitors and by the metal ion complexing agents EDTA and 1,10-phenantroline. Furthermore, we show that an Hsp31-deficient mutant accumulates increased amounts of 8–12-mer peptides, which can be processed in vitro to smaller peptides by purified Hsp31. Finally, we report that Hsp31 specifically interacts with ClpA, GroEL, EF-Tu, and tryptophanase. Our results suggest that, besides its chaperone activity, Hsp31 plays an active role in the downstream processing of peptides generated by the ATP-dependent proteases. Hsp31 Expression and Purification—The Escherichia coli B/r strain AD494 (ara leu7967 lacX74 phoA phoR-malF3 F′[lac+ (lacIq) pro] trxB::kan [DE3] pLysS was purchased from Novagen. It was transformed with plasmid pINTYEDU, which encodes the complete Hsp31/YedU protein fused to a chitin-binding domain tag at its N terminus (3Malki A. Kern R. Abdallah J. Richarme G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in LB broth in the presence of ampicillin and lysed by sonication (3Malki A. Kern R. Abdallah J. Richarme G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The recombinant Hsp31 protein fused to the chitin-binding domain was purified by affinity chromatography on a chitin affinity column (intein-mediated purification with an affinity chitin-binding tag kit from New England Biolabs, Inc.) as described previously (3Malki A. Kern R. Abdallah J. Richarme G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The eluted Hsp31 protein was pure as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It was stored at –20 °C in buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with 30% glycerol. The C185A mutant was constructed and purified as described previously (7Lee S.J. Kim S.J. Kim I.K. Ko J. Jeong C.S. Kim G.H. Park C. Kang S.O. Suh P.G. Lee H.S. Cha S.S. J. Biol.

Construction of the Hsp31-deficient Strain—The one-step inactivation of the hcha gene encoding Hsp31 was done using the phage λ recombination (Red) system (9Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11205) Google Scholar). The strategy is analogous to the PCR-based gene deletion method in yeast, except E. coli cells carrying an easily curable, low copy number plasmid (pSC101 (replication temperature-sensitive derivative)-based plasmid pKD46 carrying the λ Red recombinase genes (9Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11205) Google Scholar)) expressing the Red system was used. The basic strategy is to replace a chromosomal sequence with a selectable antibiotic resistance gene that is generated by PCR by using primers with 50-nucleotide extensions homologous to the adjacent upstream or downstream flanking regions of the target gene and 20-nucleotide 3′-end for the amplification of kanamycin (kan) resistance gene. Replacement is accomplished by λRed-mediated recombination in these flanking homologies (9Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11205) Google Scholar). Strain BW25113 (lacIq rrnB3 ΔlacZ4787 hsdR514 Δ(araBAD)567 Δ(rhaBAD)568 rph-1) was used as the parent for construction of the hcha deletion mutant JW1950. Insertion of the kan resistance cassette in the hcha gene is not likely to have a polar effect on the expression of other genes, since the genes downstream of hcha (yedV, coding for a putative sensor-like histidine kinase and YedW, coding for a probable transcriptional regulatory protein) are transcribed in the opposite direction (genolist.pasteur.fr/Colibri/). The construction of the hcha deletion mutant is part of the systematic construction of E. coli single gene deletion mutants. 2T. Baba, T. Ara, Y. Okumura, M. Hasegawa, Y. Takai, M. Baba, K. A.

Proteolysis of citrate synthase, α-casein, and β-casein was assayed by incubation of the reaction mixtures containing 2 μg of the protein substrate and 0.5 μg of Hsp31 at 37 °C in 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 5 mm MgCl2. After incubation for appropriate periods, the reaction was stopped with 2% SDS, and the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteolysis of insulin and insulin β-chain were measured by chromatographic analysis of proteolysis product on a C18 reverse phase HPLC column (Vydac C18 250 × 4.6 mm, Hewlett-Packard) equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–100% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Endopeptidase and aminopeptidase activities were assayed by monitoring the production of 7-aminomethylcoumarin (amc) from the fluorogenic amino acid or peptides substrates, succinyl-LLVY-amc, t-butyloxycarbonyl-LAR-amc, Ac-YVAD-amc, AAF-amc, ALK-amc, Ac-A-amc, l-Ala-amc, l-Arg-amc, l-Asp-amc, l-Asn-amc, l-Gly-amc, l-Leu-amc, l-Lys-amc, l-Met-amc, l-Phe-amc, l-Pro-amc, l-Thr-amc, l-Tyr-amc, l-Val-amc, l-Ser-amc, l-Cys-amc, l-His-amc, l-Glu-amc as described previously (3Malki A.

Chem. 2002; 277: 22260-22270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). One μg of Hsp31 was incubated at 37 °C for appropriate times (1–20 h, in conditions in which the appearance of product is linear as a function of time) with 500 μm substrate in 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% dimethyl sulfoxide, in a total volume of 100 μl, and amc fluorescence (excitation at 380 nm, emission at 460 nm) was measured after arrest of the reaction with 900 μl 1% SDS. Carboxypeptidase activity was assayed by measuring the hydrolysis of hippuryl-Phe or hippuryl-Arg as described previously (3Malki A. Kern R. Abdallah J. Richarme G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 11Cho J.H. Kim D.H. Lee K.J. Kim D.H. Choi K.Y. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10197-10203Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) The hydrolysis of succinyl-AAA-p-nitroanilide was detected at 410 nm. The concentration of pure Hsp31 was determined from its A280/1 mg/ml = 1.048 (Swiss-Prot, www.expasy.org/sprot/). Isolation of Accumulated Peptides from Wild-type BW25113 and Hsp31-deficient JW1950 Strains—Overnight cultures were diluted to A600 = 0.05 and grown (exponential phase of growth) for 2.5 h to A600 = 0.2 in minimal glucose medium (50 ml) containing 3 μCi of [3H]leucine/ml (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cultures were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with 0.85% NaCl, and resuspended in 1.5 ml 1 m acetic acid for extraction of peptides (14Yen C. Green L. Miller C.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 143: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The acetic acid suspension was incubated for 20 min at 22 °C, and the insoluble fraction was removed by centrifugation (20 min, 15,000 × g). Gel Filtration of Peptides—For HPLC gel filtration, 100 μl of the peptide solution was chromatographed on a TSK 2000 SW gel filtration HPLC column (Hewlett-Packard) equilibrated with 1 mm acetic acid and eluted with the same solvent at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. 0.5-ml fractions were collected. Peptides were detected by radioactivity and absorbance at 215 nm. For Bio-Gel P-2 gel filtration, the low molecular weight peptides from the TSK 2000 HPLC column were concentrated by lyophilization, resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 5 mm MgCl2, and incubated in the absence or in the presence of 2 μg Hsp31, and 100 μl was loaded onto a 2-ml column (10 cm/0.3 cm) equilibrated in 100 mm acetic acid. Dextran blue (molecular weight, 2,000,000), dextran yellow (molecular weight, 20,000), (insulin B, molecular weight, 2000), vitamin B12 (molecular weight, 1350), and leucine (molecular weight, 131) were used as molecular weight standards. Reverse Phase HPLC of Peptides—The low molecular weight peptides from the TSK 2000 SW HPLC column were concentrated by lyophilization and resuspended in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water. 100 μl was analyzed by reverse phase HPLC (Vydac C18 250 × 4.6 mm, Hewlett-Packard). The column was equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–100% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 20 min at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min and the gradient started 10 min after injection. Peptides were detected by radioactivity, by absorbance at 215 nm, and by fluorescamine reactivity before or after prior alkaline hydrolysis as described in (14Yen C. Green L. Miller C.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 143: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Detection of Hsp31 Partners by Reverse Purification—The recombinant Hsp31 protein fused to a chitin-binding domain was loaded onto a chitin affinity column and purified as described above, without the dithiothreitol-induced elution step (2Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3121) Google Scholar). An E. coli crude extract was loaded onto this Hsp31 affinity column. The column was extensively washed with 0.5 m NaCl, and proteins specifically bound were eluted with 1% SDS. The eluted proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE, and the individual bands that were not retained by two control columns were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. One of these two control columns was made with the chitin-binding domain alone, and the other with the chitin-binding domain fused to YhbO, an E. coli peptidase of 20 kDa under study in our laboratory. Materials—Citrate synthase (from porcine heart), α-casein, β-casein, insulin, insulin β-chain, and all other chemicals were from Sigma and were reagent grade. The molecular weight marker kit for gel filtration chromatography was from Sigma. The fluorogenic peptides were from either Bachem or Sigma. Absence of Proteolytic Activity of Hsp31—As reported previously (3Malki A. Kern R. Abdallah J. Richarme G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we could not detect any proteolytic activity of Hsp31 toward gelatin or casein when using a polyacrylamide in-gel assay similar to that used for the detection of PFP1 protease activity (12Blumentals I.I. Robinson A.S. Kelly R.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1990; 56: 1992-1999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in which the substrate was incorporated uniformly in the gel (these negative results were obtained with both SDS-polyacrylamide gels and native gels (data not shown)). Several other protein substrates, such as α-casein, β-casein, insulin, and insulin β-chain, were not hydrolyzed by Hsp31 in a test tube assay, in several types of experimental conditions (0.01–0.05% SDS- or Triton-containing buffers, partial thermal unfolding (15Kim K.I. Park S.C. Kang S.H. Cheong G.W. Chung C.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1363-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), presence of 1 mm ATP and 5 mm magnesium chloride), suggesting that Hsp31 does not function as a broad specificity protease (data not shown). We could not detect any significant autolytic activity of Hsp31 in a test tube assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Hsp31 underwent proteolysis in an in-gel assay consisting of a polyacrylamide gel loaded with purified Hsp31, run in SDS, subsequently transferred for 90 min into phosphate buffer containing 2% Triton X-100, and incubated overnight in the same buffer without detergent and finally colored with Coomassie Blue (data not shown). However, such proteolysis was also observed with the C185A mutant (deficient in the nucleophilic cysteine, see below), suggesting that it results from a contaminating in-gel proteolytic activity. Aminopeptidase Activity of Hsp31—We studied the cleavage specificity of Hsp31 for aminoacyl-amc fluorescent substrates. Hsp31 hydrolyzed five out of the 18 aminoacyl-amc substrates tested. Alanine, arginine, lysine, and histidine substrates were hydrolyzed with a decreasing efficiency in that order (Fig. 1A). This suggests that Hsp31 is a broad specificity aminopeptidase cleaving after alanine and basic amino acids. Kinetic characterization revealed that Hsp31 displays higher kcat/Km values for Ala (kcat = 1.1 min–1; Km = 120 μm; kcat/Km = 0.01 min–1·μm–1), Lys (kcat = 0.43 min–1; Km = 55 μm; kcat/Km = 0.008 min–1·μm–1), and Arg (kcat = 0.51 min–1; Km = 95 μm; kcat/Km = 0.005 min–1·μm–1) in that order. The apparent kcat values of Hsp31 are of the same order of magnitude as those of several aminopeptidases, such as PepD (24Schroeder U. Henrich B. Fink J. Plapp R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 123: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) or as the endopeptidase activity of PepN (16Chandu D. Nandi D. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 3437-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 17Chandu D. Kumar A. Nandi D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5548-5556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), but are much lower than the aminopeptidase activity of PepN, the major aminopeptidase of E. coli (16Chandu D. Nandi D. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 3437-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 17Chandu D. Kumar A. Nandi D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5548-5556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility that small amounts of contaminating PepN were responsible for these aminopeptidase activities, we purified Hsp31 further on a DEAE-Sephacel column. The alanine and arginine aminopeptidase activities were detected in the same fractions as the Hsp31 protein peak, suggesting that Hsp31 is responsible for these activities (Fig. 1B). Similar results were obtained when purified Hsp31 was analyzed on a hydroxylapatite column (data not shown). When compared with A-amc (100% activity), AAA-amc was hydrolyzed with less efficiency (5%), and neither acetyl-A-amc (0.2 per 100 of the activity observed with A-amc) nor benzyloxycarbonyl-AAA-amc (0.2 per 100 of the activity observed with A-amc) was cleaved by Hsp31, suggesting that Hsp31 has no endopeptidase activity (Fig. 1C). succinyl-LLVY-amc, t-butyloxycarbonyl-LAR-amc, and Ac-YVAD-amc were neither cleaved by Hsp31 (data not shown; Ref. 3Malki A. Kern R. Abdallah J. Richarme G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). All the experiments described above were also carried out in the presence of 5 mm ATP and 2 mm MgCl2 and gave similar results (data not shown). Inhibitors of Hsp31 Aminopeptidase Activity and Mutational Test of the Nucleophilic Activity of Cys185—We tested the aminopeptidase activity of Hsp31 in the presence of several inhibitors known to affect cysteine proteases (iodoacetamide and dithiothreitol), serine proteases (phenylmethylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and metalloproteases (EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline) (Fig. 2). Iodoacetamide completely blocks the ability of Hsp31 to degrade Ala-amc. Hsp31 is also severely inhibited by 10 mm dithiothreitol (80% inhibition). In contrast, the serine protease inhibitor PMSF had little effect on Hsp31. More importantly, the aminopeptidase activity of Hsp31 was completely abolished in a C185A mutant, suggesting that, in accordance with crystallographic data, Cys185 is the active nucleophile of Hsp31. Metalloprotease inhibitors strongly inhibit Hsp31: 5 mm EDTA and 5 mm 1,10-phenanthroline provoke a 95% inhibition of the Hsp31 aminopeptidase. This suggests that the putative His85, His122, and Glu90 metal-binding site of Hsp31 revealed by crystallographic studies (6Zhao Y. Liu D. Kaluarachchi W.D. Bellamy H.D. White M.A. Fox R.O. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2303-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) is important for its aminopeptidase activity. Hsp31 inhibitors are different from PepN inhibitors. PepN is strongly inhibited by PMSF but not by EDTA nor by iodoacetamide (16Chandu D. Nandi D. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 3437-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 17Chandu D. Kumar A. Nandi D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5548-5556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Effect of Temperature, pH, Divalent Cations, and ATP on the Hsp31 Aminopeptidase—Since Hsp31 is a heat shock protein and displays chaperone activity, we suspected that its aminopeptidase activity might be revealed at high temperatures, in a manner reminiscent of that of the temperature-dependent switch from chaperone to protease of DegP/HtrA (this switch occurs at temperatures ranging between 30 and 40 °C) (18Spiess C. Beil A. Ehrmann M. Cell. 1999; 97: 339-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). The dependence of the Hsp31 aminopeptidase activity on temperature within the range of 20–45 °C displays a classical curve with a Q10 of around 2, suggesting that, unlike DegtP/HtrA, there is not an exceptional activation of Hsp31 by heat shock temperatures (Fig. 3A). The aminopeptidase activity of Hsp31 was optimal around pH 8 and was greatly decreased below pH 6 and above pH 9 (Fig. 3B). In crystallographic studies of Hsp31, a zinc ion was observed, coordinated by His85, Glu90, and His122. Consistent with this observation, Hsp31 is almost completely inhibited by 5 mm o-phenanthroline, which has a particularly high affinity for zinc (Fig. 2). Furthermore, in the presence of 2 mm o-phenanthroline, the alanine aminopeptidase activity of Hsp31 was inhibited to 8% of the control and it could be reactivated up to 48% by 50 μm Zn2+ (and up to 14% by 50 μm Mn2+), but not by magnesium, calcium, iron, or cobalt divalent cations at 10–100 μm (Fig. 3C), suggesting that Zn2+ is the metal cofactor of Hsp31. Since ATP interacts with Hsp31 and inhibits some of its chaperone properties (4Sastry M.S. Korotkov K. Brodsky Y. Baneyx F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46026-46034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), we tested the aminopeptidase activities of Hsp31 as described in the above sections, in the presence of 5 mm ATP and 2 mm MgCl2, and found that ATP was without any effect (data not shown). Peptide Accumulated during Growth of an Hsp31-deficient Mutant—To test the hypothesis that the absence of Hsp31 leads to peptide accumulation during bacterial growth, the following experiment was performed. The Hsp31-deficient and parental strains were grown for several generations at 37 °C in the presence of [3H]leucine. The cells were harvested and washed, and the material that was soluble in 1 m acetic acid was extracted (14Yen C. Green L. Miller C.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 143: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The acetic acid-soluble fractions from the two cultures were subjected to gel filtration on a HPLC TSK 2000 SW gel permeation column. Both cultures displayed a similar peak of radioactivity with a molecular mass of around 100–3000 Da (not shown). Peak fractions were pooled, concentrated by lyophilization, and subjected to reverse phase chromatography on a C18 HPLC column equilibrated with water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and eluted with a linear 0–100% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. As shown in Fig. 4A, the elution profile of peptides from the Hsp31-deficient strain is different from that of the wild-type strain. The Hsp31-deficient strain accumulates a higher quantity of peptides eluting between 50 and 80% acetonitrile (8–12-mers, see below) and fewer peptides eluting between 0 and 30% acetonitrile (3–5-mers, see below). The quality of peptides accumulating in the Hsp31-deficient strain was studied by the following procedure: fractions eluting from the C18 column were assayed for [3H]leucine radioactivity, fluorescamine reactivity (NH2 terminus determination), and fluorescamine reactivity after peptide hydrolysis in base, as described in (14Yen C. Green L. Miller C.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 143: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B). The results of this experiment indicate that (i) the radioactive material applied on the C18 column is heterogeneous, and (ii) all fractions contain fluorescamine positive material, (iii) the fluorescamine detection is severalfold increas"

We used a dual pipette assay that measures the forces required to separate cell doublets to determine how nectins affect the formation and strength of cell-cell adhesion. Less force was required to separate doublets of L cells expressing nectin-1 or nectin-3 than to separate doublets of E-cadherin-expressing cells. Heterodimers formed between cells expressing nectin-1 or nectin-3 adhered more strongly than homodimers. Nectin-3 that does not trans-interact with nectin-1 inhibited E-cadherin-mediated adhesion. However, the extracellular fragment of nectin-1 did not have an agonistic effect on E-cadherin-dependent cell adhesion when it trans-interacted with nectin-3, expressed at high levels in cells. In contrast, the extracellular fragment of nectin-3 had a significant agonistic effect on cadherin-based adhesion when it interacted with endogenous nectin-1, expressed at low levels in cells. Our results indicate that E-cadherin is the key molecule involved in cell adhesion and that the regulation of E-cadherin-based adhesion involving cellular nectin-1 trans-interacting with nectin-3 is qualitatively different from that involving cellular nectin-3 trans-interacting with nectin-1 and depends on the nectin levels expressed by cells.

Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1001-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) in the cytoplasm at the site of AJs. Nectins do not interact directly with cadherins, but these adhesion molecules can interact with each other via their cytoplasmic domain-associated proteins (43Tachibana K. Nakanishi H. Mandai K. Ozaki K. Ikeda W. Yamamoto Y. Nagafuchi A. Tsukita S. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1161-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Thus, afadin appears to mediate interactions between nectins and the cadherin-catenin system in AJs (36Takahashi K. Nakanishi H. Miyahara M. Mandai K. Satoh K. Satoh A. Nishioka H. Aoki J. Nomoto A. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) and between nectins and junctional adhesion molecules in tight junctions (44Fukuhara A. Irie K. Nakanishi H. Takekuni K. Kawakatsu T. Ikeda W. Yamada A. Katata T. Honda T. Sato T. Shimizu K. Ozaki H. Horiuchi H. Kita T. Takai Y. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7642-7655Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that the structural organization of cadherin-based AJs and tight junctions in polarized epithelia is disrupted in afadin -/- mice (45Ikeda W. Nakanishi H. Miyoshi J. Mandai K. Ishizaki H. Tanaka M. Togawa A. Takahashi K. Nishioka H. Yoshida H. Mizoguchi A. Nishikawa S. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1117-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The precise mechanism by which the nectin-afadin complex affects cell adhesiveness is not known. Presumably, it exerts its effects via the cytoskeletal organization and polarization of epithelial cells. These results seem to suggest that cross-talk occurs between the nectin/afadin and cadherin/catenin systems to promote cell adhesion. To clarify this issue, we used a methodology that measures separation force to investigate the effect of nectins on adhesion strength in the presence and absence of E-cadherin. Two cells were put in contact by micromanipulation in suspension to form an adhesive doublet and then separated. The force required to separate the two cells was measured on several cells containing various amounts of nectins and/or E-cadherin. We found that the force necessary to separate doublets of L cells expressing nectin-1 (N1L) or nectin-3 (N3L) was lower than that required to separate E-cadherin-expressing (EL) doublets. When cells expressed only E-cadherin or both E-cadherin and nectin-1, the forces required for separation were similar, suggesting that, in this dual pipette assay, the presence of nectin-1 does not modify or improve the “adhesiveness” of cells. In contrast, we observed that nectin-3 inhibited E-cadherin-adhesion activity when it was not trans-interacting with nectin-1. Our results indicate different modulation of E-cadherin-based adhesion by nectin-1 and nectin-3. Antibodies and Reagents—DECMA-1 (rat anti-E-cadherin) antibody and phalloidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate were purchased from Sigma. Rabbit anti-human nectin-1α and rabbit anti-mouse nectin-3α polyclonal antibodies were produced as described previously (36Takahashi K. Nakanishi H. Miyahara M. Mandai K. Satoh K. Satoh A.

EL cells were maintained in culture medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), penicillin (100 IU/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 2 mm l-glutamine (Sigma). N1L and N1ΔCL cells were grown in culture medium supplemented with 500 μg/ml G418. N1EL#8 cells were grown in culture medium supplemented with 500 μg/ml hygromycin (Clontech). N3L, N3EL#2, and N1EL#4 cells were grown in culture medium supplemented with 5 μg/ml puromycin. Confluent cultures were routinely treated with 0.05% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA (trypsin-EDTA treatment, Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 5 min and seeded at a sufficiently high density to yield a nearly confluent culture 18–24 h later. To ensure that E-cadherin and nectins were not lost from their surfaces, completely dispersed cell suspensions were obtained by treating monolayers with 0.01% trypsin XI (Sigma) in HMF (magnesium-free HEPES-based buffer containing 10 mm calcium, pH 7.4 (49Nakagawa S. Takeichi M. Development. 1995; 121: 1321-1332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). After centrifugation, the cell suspension was gently suspended in HCMF (calcium- and magnesium-free, HEPES-based) to yield isolated cells. The cells were then centrifuged and resuspended in working medium (CO2-independent medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum) and used immediately in the dual pipette assay. Alternatively, N1EL cell monolayers were treated with the trypsin-EDTA solution to yield suspended cells lacking cadherins at their surface but still retaining nectins (36Takahashi K. Nakanishi H.

Microscopy—The expression of E-cadherin and nectins was monitored by immunofluorescence microscopy in cells cultured on glass coverslips as described previously (50Dufour S. Beauvais-Jouneau A. Delouvee A. Thiery J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 501-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Preparations were observed by epifluorescence microscopy, using a Leica DMRBE microscope equipped with a cooled charge-coupled device camera (Hamamatsu C5985). Data were acquired using a Power Macintosh workstation and IP-Lab software. The E-cadherin and nectins expressed at the surface of living cells were analyzed by flow cytometry as described before (51Beauvais A. Erickson C.A. Goins T. Craig S.E. Humphries M.J. Thiery J.P. Dufour S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 699-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cell suspensions were prepared in a way to preserve E-cadherin at their surface and incubated in cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with a specific antibody directed against the extracellular domain of E-cadherin or against the cytoplasmic domain of nectins. Quantification of E-cadherin and Nectin Levels in Cells—Cell monolayers were extracted and subjected to Western blot analysis as described previously (50Dufour S. Beauvais-Jouneau A. Delouvee A. Thiery J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 501-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) with antibodies directed against E-cadherin, nectin-1, and nectin-3. Bound antibodies were detected using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Signals were quantified using National Institutes of Health Image software. Cellular E-cadherin and nectins were quantified by using standard curves built using a linear range of concentrations of the recombinant MBP-Nectin-1, MBP-Nectin-3, and glutathione S-transferase-E-cadherin (cytoplasmic domain) proteins as described previously (52Shimizu K. Gurdon J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6791-6796Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Micropipette Preparation—Micropipettes were made from borosilicate glass capillary GC100–15 tubing (1.0-mm outside diameter × 0.58-mm wall thickness × 7-cm length, Harvard apparatus Ltd., Kent, UK) using a pipette puller (Sutter instruments, model P-2000) and a homemade Microforge, such that their inner diameter was 5.0–6.5 μm. Pipettes were coated with bovine serum albumin. Prior to experiments, the pipettes were filled with isotonic sucrose solution (300 mosmol). Measurement of Separation Forces—Separation force measurements were done as described previously (53Daoudi M. Lavergne E. Garin A. Tarantino N. Debre P. Pincet F. Combadiere C. Deterre P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19649-19657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The experimental technique is based on a modification of a dual-micropipette assay (54Sung K-l.P. Sung L.A. Crimmins M. Burakoff S.J. Chien S. Science. 1986; 234: 1405-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), which permits manipulation of individual cells to form controlled contacts. Briefly, the experiments were performed on the stage of a Leica inverted epifluorescence microscope positioned on an anti-vibration platform and equipped with a cooled charge-coupled device Hamamatsu C5985 or Nikon Coolpix 5000 camera, a digitally controlled heating stage and 10× and 63× objectives. The incubation chamber consisted of the bottom half of a 90-mm Petri dish previously coated with bovine serum albumin for 12 h. All experiments were performed at 37 °C. An inverted bottom of a second Petri dish of the same size was used to cover the stage and to keep humidity and temperature constant. Two micropipettes were positioned in a dual entry chamber mounted on the microscope stage. Each was held in its own micromanipulator and connected to a combined hydraulic/pneumatic system, making it possible to control the aspiration applied to the cells. Two cells (expressing either the same or different adhesive proteins) were gently aspirated, one on the tip of each pipette (to form homodimers or heterodimers (Fig. 1A)), and brought into contact through the use of the micromanipulators (Fig. 1B). For experiments performed on the validation of the initial contact, we measured the force require to separate doublets (see below) immediately after putting the cells in contact. Alternatively, cells were allowed to remain in contact for a designated period of time. To separate cells in contact, the aspiration in the right pipette was maintained at a level sufficiently high to hold one of the two cells in contact tightly. The aspiration in the left pipette was increased in steps, the magnitudes of which were measured with a pressure sensor (Validyne: model DP103-38, 0–50,000 Pa). After each step, the pipettes were moved apart in an effort to detach the adherent cells from one another (Fig. 1C). A doublet pulled intact from the left pipette was moved back to the orifice of the pipette, and the cycle was repeated until the level of aspiration reached in the left pipette was sufficient to pull one cell apart from the other (Fig. 1C). The aspiration was monitored continuously during the separation process, and the values recorded for each of the last two cycles in the series (P n-1 and P n) were used to calculate the separation force (F) for each doublet using the equation: F = π(d/2)2 (P n-1 + P n)/2, where d is the internal diameter of left pipette. Results from 30–50 measurements were used to obtain the mean force of separation for a specific contact time in each experiment. The separation force is referred to as F. Determination of E-cadherin and Nectin Levels in Stably Transfected L Cells—The mouse L fibroblasts stably transfected to express E-cadherin, nectins, or both were analyzed by immunofluorescent staining and Western blotting. Cadherins and nectins were found at the surface and recruited to cell boundaries (Fig. 2). When both molecules were expressed in the same cells, they colocalized at the sites of cell-cell contact, as shown in the merged images. E-cadherin and nectin levels were measured in the various clones (Table I). EL, N1EL#4, N1EL#8, and N3EL#2 expressed a similar amount of E-cadherin (around 1 × 106 molecules/cell), whereas L, N1L, N1L#3, N1L#5, N1L#6, N1ΔCL, and N3L did not express a detectable amount of this molecule. All these clones contained nectins at various levels of expression.Table ILevels of nectins and E-cadherin in cellsCell linesNectinE-cadherinmolecules / cellL1 × 104ndand, not detectedEL1 × 1041 × 106N1L5.7 × 106ndN1L#31.4 × 106ndN1L#50.3 × 106ndN1L#61 × 106ndN1ΔCL3.5 × 106ndN3L6.1 × 106ndN1EL#80.9 × 1061 × 106N1EL#45.1 × 1061.1 × 106N3EL#27.9 × 1060.9 × 106a nd, not detected Open table in a new tab Nectins Generate Weaker Adhesion Than E-cadherin—We used an approach that gives an estimate of the strength of adhesion between cells mediated by nectins and E-cadherin. Cell adhesion was initiated by using micropipettes, and we then measured the forces required to separate them. We have previously observed that a strong force is required to separate sarcoma S180 cells expressing E-cadherin after 4 min of contact. The amount of force required increases with the time of contact and the amount of cadherin expressed at the surface (55Chu Y-S. Thomas W.A. Eder O. Pincet F. Perez E. Thiery J.P. Dufour S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In this study, we compared the mean separation force obtained after 4 min of contact between homodimeric EL, N1L#6, N1L, N1ΔCL, and N3L doublets and heterodimeric N1L-N3L doublets (Fig. 3). Although EL and N1L#6 cells expressed similar amount of adhesion molecules at their surface (1 × 106 molecules of E-cadherin or nectin-1, respectively, per cell), the forces measured to separate EL doublets (29.3 nN) were higher than those measured for N1L doublets (1.5 nN). In addition, when a large amount of nectin-1 or nectin-3 are expressed at the cell surface (around 6 × 106 molecules/cell), the forces required to separate N1L, N3L, and N1L-N3L doublets (2.2, 1.3, and 7.7 nN, respectively) were still weaker than those required to separate EL doublets. This indicates that nectins generate weaker interactions than E-cadherin. We observed that greater force was required to separate N1L-N3L (7.7 nN) heterodimers than to separate the N1L or N3L homodimers (2.2 and 1.3 nN, respectively). When cells expressed 3.5 × 106 molecules of nectin-1 lacking its cytoplasmic domain (N1ΔCL cells), the separation force was 1 nN, which is statistically weaker than that measured for N1L (2.2 nN) and N1L#6 (1.56 nN) doublets. This suggests that the cytoplasmic domain of nectin may be involved in the control of nectin-based adhesion strength. We then compared"

GATA-6 is the only family member expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells and has been shown to be important for controlling the phenotype of these cells following vascular injury. To clarify further the role of GATA-6 in regulating vascular smooth muscle differentiation, we directly examined its ability to regulate the promoters of smooth muscle-specific genes. This analysis revealed that GATA-6 strongly repressed telokin promoter activity. In contrast, GATA-6 activated the smooth muscle myosin heavy chain and smooth muscle α-actin promoters and had no significant effect on the SM22α promoter. Gel mobility shift assays demonstrate that GATA-6 binds to a consensus site adjacent to the CArG box in the telokin promoter. GATA-6 did not interfere with the serum-response factor-stimulated promoter activity but blocked myocardin-induced activation of the telokin promoter. In contrast, GATA-6 and myocardin resulted in synergistic activation of the smooth muscle myosin heavy chain promoter. Consistent with these findings, overexpression of GATA-6 in smooth muscle cells selectively inhibited expression of endogenous telokin, while simultaneously increasing expression of other smooth muscle proteins. These data suggest that GATA-6 selectively inhibits telokin expression by triggering the displacement of myocardin from the serum-response factor. As GATA-6 is expressed at high levels in vascular smooth muscle, this finding may explain the relatively low levels of telokin expression in the vascular system. These data also reveal a novel transcription regulatory mechanism by which GATA-6 can modulate the activity of the myocardin-serum-response factor complexes.

Kumar M.S. Wamhoff B.R. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 767-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2535) Google Scholar). Among these factors, the serum-response factor (SRF), which binds to CArG elements, plays a key role in the regulation of most smooth muscle restricted genes (reviewed in Ref. 7Miano J.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2003; 35: 577-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). SRF is a member of the MADS (MCM1, Agamous, and Deficiens, SRF) box family of transcription factors that are important regulators of many genes associated with cell growth and differentiation. SRF is enriched in cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle progenitor cells during embryogenesis, as well as in terminally differentiated adult muscle cells (8Croissant J.D. Kim J.H. Eichele G.

Targeted disruption of the mammalian SRF gene leads to malformation of the mesoderm, indicating a critical role for SRF in mesoderm development (10Arsenian S. Weinhold B. Oelgeschlager M. Ruther U.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5835-5844Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).Accumulating evidence has suggested that, as a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor, SRF regulates various growth-responsive and muscle-specific genes through its interaction with different coregulators, such as myocardin, Barx1b/2b, Prx1 (Mhox), NK-homeodomain proteins, and GATA family members (12Li S.

Myocardin selectively activates smooth and cardiac muscle promoters through its interaction with SRF and can induce expression of numerous smooth muscle-specific genes in 10T1/2 fibroblasts and other cell types (23Chen J. Kitchen C.M. Streb J.W. Miano J.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2002; 34: 1345-1356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Yoshida T. Kawai-Kowase K. Owens G.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

In addition to SRF-myocardin complexes, several other SRF-containing complexes have also been shown to be sufficient to induce expression of smooth muscle-specific genes in nonmuscle cells. These complexes include SRF-myocardin related factor A (MRTFA or MKL1), SRF-Nkx3.2-GATA-6, and SRF-CRP2-GATA-4/6 (19Chang D.F. Belaguli N.S. Iyer D. Roberts W.B. Wu S.P. Dong X.R. Marx J.G.

GATA proteins are a family of zinc finger transcription factors that play essential roles in development through their interaction with DNA regulatory elements that contain a consensus WGATAR motif. In vertebrates, six GATA family members have been identified that can be divided into two subgroups based on sequence homology and tissue distribution (27Patient R.K. McGhee J.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 416-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The GATA-1/2/3 subfamily is expressed in the hematopoietic cell lineage and plays a critical role in the development of this lineage (28Weiss M.J. Orkin S.H. Exp. Hematol. 1995; 23: 99-107PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the GATA-4/5/6 subfamily is thought to be involved with cardiac, gut, and blood vessel formation (29Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38949-38952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). During early murine embryonic development, the patterns of GATA-6 and -4 gene expression are similar, with expression being detected in the precardiac mesoderm, the embryonic heart tube, and the primitive gut. However, during development GATA-6 becomes the only member of the family expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) (30Narita N. Heikinheimo M. Bielinska M. White R.A. Wilson D.B. Genomics. 1996; 36: 345-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 31Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). GATA-6 expression in VSMCs is rapidly down-regulated upon mitogen stimulation or vascular injury (32Mano T. Luo Z. Malendowicz S.L. Evans T. Walsh K. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Adenovirus-mediated GATA-6 gene transfer to the vessel wall after balloon injury partially inhibited lesion formation and reversed the down-regulation of Sm-MHC, smooth muscle α-actin (SM α-actin), calponin, vinculin, and metavinculin expression that is normally associated with injury-induced VSMC phenotypic modulation (32Mano T. Luo Z. Malendowicz S.L. Evans T. Walsh K. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These data suggest that GATA-6 plays a critical role in the maintenance of the differentiated phenotype in VSMCs.In the current study, we further investigated the roles of GATA-6 in regulating smooth muscle-specific gene transcription. We found that GATA-6 strongly repressed the smooth muscle-specific telokin promoter activity while activating the Sm-MHC and SM α-actin promoters. GATA-6-mediated repression of the telokin promoter occurred through direct competition between GATA-6 and myocardin for binding to SRF. The GATA-6-binding site in the telokin promoter located adjacent to the CArG box was critical for this inhibitory activity. Together our data reveal a novel transcription regulatory mechanism by which GATA-6 can modulate the activity of myocardin-SRF complexes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Constructs and Promoter-Reporter Gene Assays—Mouse GATA-6 wild type cDNA and adenovirus were both kindly provided by Dr. Jeffery D. Molkentin (Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati, Children's Hospital Medical Center). Mouse myocardin wild-type cDNA in pcDNA3.1-myc/his vector was kindly provided by Dr. Eric N. Olson (University of Texas, Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas). An expression plasmid containing the human SRF cDNA was the generous gift from Dr. Ron Prywes (Columbia University). All promoter-reporter genes were constructed by cloning fragments of promoters into the pGL2B luciferase vector (Promega). The rabbit telokin promoter (T400)-luciferase reporter gene used includes nucleotides -256 to +147 of the telokin gene as described previously (33Herring B.P. Smith A.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1656-C1665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The GATA site (-60 to -57) deletion mutant of the rabbit telokin promoter, T400 (ΔGATA), was generated by PCR-mediated mutagenesis using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, according to the manufacturer's directions (Stratagene). The SM22α-luciferase reporter gene includes nucleotides -475 to +61 of the mouse SM22α gene (34Hoggatt A.M. Simon G.M. Herring B.P. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 1151-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The SM α-actin promoter fragment extended from nucleotide -2,555 to +2,813 (35Mack C.P. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 852-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and the Sm-MHC promoter from -4,200 to +11,600 (36Madsen C.S. Regan C.P. Hungerford J.E. White S.L. Manabe I. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 908-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar); these plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. Gary Owens (University of Virginia).Plasmids were transfected into rat A10 smooth muscle cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). A10 smooth muscle cells were grown in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 mg/ml streptomycin, and 20% fetal bovine serum. A10 cells to be transfected were seeded at 3 × 104 cells/well in 24-well plates. 16–18 h post-seeding, each dish was washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), replaced with 0.5 ml of complete medium, and incubated with a total of 1 μg of plasmid DNA and 2 μl of FuGENE in 50 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. 24 h later, 10 μl of cleared extracts (100 μl/well) were prepared for dual luciferase assays by using a dual luciferase reporter assay system according to the manufacturer's directions (Promega). Reporter gene luciferase activities were normalized to the luciferase activity of the internal control.Gel Mobility Shift Assays—Nuclear extracts were prepared from COS cells transfected with GATA-6 or SRF expression plasmids. Gel mobility shift assays were performed in a final volume of 15 μl. Binding mixtures contained 0.2 ng (1.5 × 104 cpm) of end-labeled double-stranded DNA probe, 200 ng of poly(dI-dC), 4.5 μg of bovine serum albumin, and various amounts of nuclear extract protein. For cold competition experiments, a 50-fold excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide competitors was included in some reactions as indicated in the figure legends. Annealed oligonucleotides were labeled using [32P]dCTP and Klenow DNA polymerase (Promega). Unincorporated [32P]dCTP was removed by agarose gel electrophoresis. All binding reactions were incubated for 20 min at room temperature, and the DNA-protein complexes were then resolved by electrophoresis through 4% polyacrylamide gels containing 6.75 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 3.3 mm sodium acetate (pH 7.9), 1 mm EDTA, and 2.5% glycerol. The gel was dried and autoradiographed with intensifying screens at -80 °C overnight.Mammalian Two-hybrid Assay—Mammalian two-hybrid assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Expression plasmids of fusion proteins for GAL4-SRF (pBIND-SRF), VP16-myocardin (pACT-myocardin), GAL4-GATA-6 (pBIND-GATA-6), and VP16-GATA-6 (pACT-GATA-6) were constructed and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression plasmids for GAL4 fusion protein and VP16 fusion protein were cotransfected into A10 cells together with pG5Luc reporter plasmid, and luciferase activity was measured according to the manufacturer's directions (Promega, Madison, WI).Adenovirus Transduction and Western Blotting—For adenoviral transduction, A10 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well and grown overnight to near-confluence. These cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline to remove serum and infected with adenovirus encoding LacZ or GATA-6 in phosphate-buffered saline at a multiplicity of infection of 100 for 4 h at 37 °C. These conditions resulted in close to 100% infection of cells. 72 h following infection, cell protein extracts were prepared using RIPA buffer, and protein concentrations were determined by using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Western blotting analysis was carried out essentially as described previously (37Zhou J. Hoggatt A.M. Herring B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15929-15937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thirty micrograms of protein were fractionated on 7.5 or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The protein sample was electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and verified by Ponceau S staining. The membrane was then probed with a series of antibodies. The secondary antibody, anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (1: 10,000 dilution), conjugated with horseradish peroxidase was visualized using Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Chemiluminescence was detected and quantitated by using a CCD camera system (Fujifilm, Stamford, CT). Antibodies used in this study were as follows: polyclonal antibodies against telokin (1:6,000), SM22α (1:6000; a gift from Dr. Len Adam), nonmuscle myosin heavy chain IIb (NMHCIIb, 1:5000) (1Herring B.P. Lyons G.E. Hoggatt A.M. Gallagher P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C12-C21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), GATA-6 (1:10,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and monoclonal antibodies against calponin (1:10,000; Sigma, clone hCP), SM α-actin (1:10,000; Sigma, clone 1A4), and MLCK (1:10,000; Sigma, clone K36).Primary Mouse Colon Smooth Muscle Cell Preparation—Mouse colonic smooth muscle cells were prepared as follows. Briefly, the colon was dissected out of 4-week-old mice. The epithelial layer was removed by blunt dissection, and the remaining muscle layer was minced in 5 ml of tissue digestion buffer (1 mg/ml collagenase type IV (Sigma), 0.125 mg/ml elastase, 0.25 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mg/ml DNase in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm CaCl2). The minced tissue was digested for 1 h at 37 °C with shaking. Cells were passed through cell sieve, washed three times with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and then plated at a density of ∼6 × 104 cells per well in a 24-well plate. The media were changed on the cells daily, and 5 days after plating they were infected with adenovirus as described above.Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. The statistical significance of the differences between the means of the groups was determined by one-way analysis of variance or unpaired two-tailed Student's t tests. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant.RESULTSGATA-6 Selectively Represses the Activity of the Telokin Promoter, While Activating the SM α-Actin and Sm-MHC Promoters—To examine the effect of GATA-6 on smooth muscle-specific promoter activity, GATA-6 expression plasmids were cotransfected into A10 cells together with various reporter plasmids consisting of a firefly luciferase gene driven by SM α-actin, Sm-MHC, SM22α, or telokin promoters. Each of these promoters has been shown previously (34Hoggatt A.M. Simon G.M. Herring B.P. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 1151-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 35Mack C.P. Owens G.K. Circ.

Res. 1998; 82: 908-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) to direct smooth muscle-restricted transgene expression in vivo. Results showed that GATA-6 significantly increased the activity of SM α-actin and Sm-MHC promoters, but it did not change SM22α promoter activity, and GATA-6 overexpression strongly repressed telokin promoter activity by 47 ± 2% (Fig. 1A). The effect of GATA-6 on telokin promoter activity was also examined in an A10 cell line stably expressing an integrated mouse telokin promoter (-190 to +171) firefly luciferase reporter gene. Overexpression of GATA-6 by adenoviral transduction significantly repressed telokin promoter activity relative to cells transduced with a control β-galactosidase adenovirus (Fig. 1B).GATA-6 Binds to a Consensus Binding Sequence in an AT-rich Region Adjacent to the CArG Box of the Telokin Promoter—To determine directly the binding site for GATA-6 within the core of the telokin promoter, gel mobility shift assays were performed. A gel mobility shift assay using a probe that encompasses -81 to -42 of the rabbit telokin promoter, including an E-box, AT-rich region, and CArG box (Fig. 2A), demonstrated that SRF and GATA-6 nuclear extracts both bind specifically to this fragment. These mobility-shifted complexes could be supershifted by antibodies to the respective proteins but not by the nonspecific antibodies (Fig. 2B). The GATA-6 mobility-shifted complex could be competed away by unlabeled fragments encompassing the full-length cold wild type probe and with the AT-rich region alone, but not by a fragment that included only the E box or CArG box alone (Fig. 2C). This result suggests that GATA-6 binds to the AT-rich region between -71 and -59 of the telokin promoter. At the 3′ end of the AT-rich region, adjacent to the CArG box, there is a consensus binding sequence (TATC) for GATA factors (Fig. 3A). To determine whether this consensus binding sequence is required for GATA-6 binding, a series of gel mobility shift probes were generated that contained single nucleotide mutations or a 4-bp deletion within the AT-rich region. Results from these assays demonstrated that deletion of the GATA consensus sequence (ΔGATA) abolished GATA-6 binding, and mutation of the adjacent cytosine to a guanine decreased binding (Fig. 3B, 12C-G). In contrast, single base mutations within the remainder of the AT-rich region did not prevent GATA-6 binding. As a control we demonstrated that all probes were able to bind to SRF with similar efficacy (Fig. 3B, lower panel). These results demonstrate that GATA-6 binds to a consensus binding sequence (TATC) in the AT-rich region, adjacent to the CArG box, in the core of the telokin promoter. To determine whether GATA-6 binding to this site is required for GATA-6 to inhibit telokin promoter activity, the consensus binding sequence (TATC) was deleted within the context of the -256 to +147 telokin reporter gene. Deletion of the GATA-binding site from the telokin promoter abolished the ability of GATA-6 to repress the promoter (Fig. 3C), demonstrating that direct binding of GATA-6 to the telokin promoter is required for its ability to inhibit promoter activity.Fig. 2GATA-6 binds to an AT-rich region adjacent to the CArG box of the telokin promoter. A, probes used for gel mobility shift assays in B and C. B, 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide encompassing the E box, AT-rich region, and CArG box from the telokin promoter (-81 to -42, Core probe in A) was incubated with SRF, GATA-6, or nontransfected COS cell nuclear extracts, as indicated. Following incubation for 20 min at room temperature, anti-SRF, anti-GATA-6, or anti-Sp1 antibodies were added and incubated for a further 1 h on ice. Samples were run on a 4% polyacrylamide gel, and mobility-shifted complexes were visualized by autoradiography. The positions of the specific mobility-shifted complexes are indicated by the arrows, and complexes resulting from antibody supershifts are indicated by the asterisks. C, to further refine the GATA-binding site within the telokin promoter core, the probe used in B was incubated with 1 μg of GATA-6 nuclear extract in the presence of a 50-fold excess of each of the cold competitor oligonucleotides as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3GATA-6 binds to a consensus GATA-binding sequence in the AT-rich region of the telokin promoter.

B, to refine the GATA-6 binding site within the AT-rich region of the telokin promoter, a series of mutations and deletions of telokin promoter were introduced into the gel mobility shift probe shown in A, as indicated. 32P-Labeled probes were incubated with GATA-6 (upper panel) or SRF (lower panel) nuclear extract and analyzed by gel mobility shift assay. The positions of the GATA-6 and SRF mobility-shifted complexes are indicated. C, A10 cells were transiently transfected with the wide type (WT) or GATA-binding site deleted (ΔGATA) telokin promoter-luciferase reporter genes and either a GATA-6 expression vector or an empty vector together with an internal control Renilla luciferase plasmid. 24 h following transfection, cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity. Promoter activity was normalized to the internal control (Renilla luciferase). Promoter activity relative to vector control transfections is presented as mean ± S.E. of six samples. *, p < 0.01 versus vector-transfected group.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of GATA-6 on SRF-induced Activation of the Telokin Promoter—Given that both SRF and GATA proteins interact with adjacent binding sites in the telokin promoter, and previous data showing the importance of SRF for telokin promoter activity (38Herring B.P. Smith A.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1394-C1404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we tested the possibility that the repressive effect of GATA-6 may result from GATA-6 preventing SRF from interacting with the promoter. Luciferase reporter gene assays in A10 smooth muscle cells showed that overexpression of SRF produced a 3-fold increase in promoter activity. Overexpression of GATA-6 and SRF produced a small synergistic response, indicating that GATA-6 does not block the ability of SRF to activate the promoter (Fig. 4A).Fig. 4GATA-6 inhibits the myocardin-induced activation of the telokin promoter but augments the myocardin-induced activation of the Sm-MHC promoter. Subconfluent A10 cells were transfected with telokin or Sm-MHC reporter genes together with SRF, myocardin, or GATA-6 expression plasmids, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Total DNA concentrations in all transfections were adjusted to 1 μg with empty pCMV vector. A, cells were transfected with a telokin promoter (-256 to +147) reporter gene together with 0.6 μg of empty expression vector or 0.3 μg of SRF expression vector in the presence or absence of 0.2–0.3 μg of GATA-6 expression vector as indicated. B, a telokin promoter reporter gene was transfected into A10 cells together with 0.6 μg of empty expression vector or 0.2 μg of myocardin expression vector in the presence or absence of 0.2–0.4 μg of GATA-6 expression vector as indicated. C, an Sm-MHC promoter reporter gene was transfected into A10 cells together with empty expression vector or myocardin expression vector in the presence or absence of GATA-6 expression vector as indicated. Luciferase activity was measured, normalized to Renilla luciferase, and expressed relative to the vector-only transfection. Results are reported as mean ± S.E. of six samples.View"
https://openalex.org/W2122837129,"Acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) enzymes catalyze the final step in mammalian triglyceride synthesis, and their functions are considered to be involved in the mechanisms of obesity, insulin resistance, and leptin resistance. Insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2)-deficient mice exhibit obesity-associated with hypertrophic adipocytes and leptin resistance. Screening for transcripts of genes involved in fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis to investigate the mechanism of the hypertrophic change in the adipocytes showed that expression of DGAT2 mRNA was up-regulated in the white adipose tissue (WAT) of Irs2–/– mice, whereas that of DGAT1 was down-regulated. This reciprocal expression of DGAT1 and DGAT2 was also observed in WAT of leptin-deficient ob/ob mice. A high fat diet also resulted in increased DGAT2 and reduced DGAT1 in the WAT of C57BL/6 mice. Induction of adipocyte hypertrophy in vitro up-regulated both DGAT1 and DGAT2 expression in 3T3-L1 cells, suggesting that adipocyte non-autonomous mechanism in vivo is required for the reciprocal changes in expression of DGAT1 and DGAT2. In fact, intracerebroventricular infusion of leptin reduced DGAT2 expression in WAT of Irs2–/– mice and ob/ob mice, independently of DGAT1 expression. We propose the hypothesis that leptin regulates adipocyte size by altering expression patterns of DGAT via central nervous system to determine the levels of triglyceride synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1970395279,"Although p53-inactivating mutations have been described in the majority of human cancers, their role in prostate cancer is controversial as mutations are uncommon, particularly in early lesions. p53 is activated by hypoxia and other stressors and is primarily regulated by the Mdm2 protein. Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, an inducible enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins and other eicosanoids, is also induced by hypoxia. COX-2 and resultant prostaglandins increase tumor cell proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, and angiogenesis. Previous reports indicate a complex, reciprocal relationship between p53 and COX-2. To elucidate the effects of COX-2 on p53 in response to hypoxia, we transfected the COX-2 gene into the p53-positive, COX-2-negative MDA-PCa-2b human prostate cancer cell line. The expression of functional p53 and Mdm2 was compared in COX-2+ versus COX-2- cells under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Our results demonstrated that hypoxia increases both COX-2 protein levels and p53 transcriptional activity in these cells. Forced expression of COX-2 increased tumor cell viability and decreased apoptosis in response to hypoxia. COX-2+ cells had increased Mdm2 phosphorylation in either normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Overexpression of COX-2 abrogated hypoxia-induced p53 phosphorylation and promoted the binding of p53 to Mdm2 protein in hypoxic cells. In addition, COX-2-expressing cells exhibited decreased hypoxia-induced nuclear accumulation of p53 protein. Finally, forced expression of COX-2 suppressed both basal and hypoxia-induced p53 transcriptional activity, and this effect was mimicked by the addition of PGE2 to wild-type cells. These results demonstrated a role for COX-2 in the suppression of hypoxia-induced p53 activity via both direct effects and indirect modulation of Mdm2 activity. These data imply that COX-2-positive prostate cancer cells can have impaired p53 function even in the presence of wild-type p53 and that p53 activity can be restored in these cells via inhibition of COX-2 activity. Although p53-inactivating mutations have been described in the majority of human cancers, their role in prostate cancer is controversial as mutations are uncommon, particularly in early lesions. p53 is activated by hypoxia and other stressors and is primarily regulated by the Mdm2 protein. Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, an inducible enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins and other eicosanoids, is also induced by hypoxia. COX-2 and resultant prostaglandins increase tumor cell proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, and angiogenesis. Previous reports indicate a complex, reciprocal relationship between p53 and COX-2. To elucidate the effects of COX-2 on p53 in response to hypoxia, we transfected the COX-2 gene into the p53-positive, COX-2-negative MDA-PCa-2b human prostate cancer cell line. The expression of functional p53 and Mdm2 was compared in COX-2+ versus COX-2- cells under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Our results demonstrated that hypoxia increases both COX-2 protein levels and p53 transcriptional activity in these cells. Forced expression of COX-2 increased tumor cell viability and decreased apoptosis in response to hypoxia. COX-2+ cells had increased Mdm2 phosphorylation in either normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Overexpression of COX-2 abrogated hypoxia-induced p53 phosphorylation and promoted the binding of p53 to Mdm2 protein in hypoxic cells. In addition, COX-2-expressing cells exhibited decreased hypoxia-induced nuclear accumulation of p53 protein. Finally, forced expression of COX-2 suppressed both basal and hypoxia-induced p53 transcriptional activity, and this effect was mimicked by the addition of PGE2 to wild-type cells. These results demonstrated a role for COX-2 in the suppression of hypoxia-induced p53 activity via both direct effects and indirect modulation of Mdm2 activity. These data imply that COX-2-positive prostate cancer cells can have impaired p53 function even in the presence of wild-type p53 and that p53 activity can be restored in these cells via inhibition of COX-2 activity. The p53 tumor suppressor protein plays a critical role in the regulation of cell growth, the protection of normal cells from malignant transformation, and the response of tumor cells to radiation and chemotherapy (1Levine A.J.

Although alterations in the p53 gene are found in more than half of all human cancers, the role of p53 mutations in human prostate cancer is controversial, as such mutations are uncommon, particularly in early lesions (3Mirchandani D.

Recent reports demonstrate alterations in p53 activation and stabilization in human premalignant and malignant lesions that retain the expression of functional wild-type p53 (5Liang S.H. Clarke M.F.

This wild-type p53 inactivation may result from either abnormal sequestration in the cytoplasm where it is functionally muted (6Issacs J.S. Hardman R. Carman T.A. Barnet J.C. Weissman B.E.

We also reported that COX-2 and PGE2 are key mediators of cellular responses observed after hypoxia resulting from induction of vascular endothelial cell factor (12Liu X.H. Kirschenbaum A. Yao S.

Previous reports indicate complex, functional, and reciprocal interactions between the COX-2 and p53 systems. An association between COX-2 overexpression and p53 mutations or low p53 protein levels has been reported in human gastric and breast cancers (21Leung W.K. To K.F. Ng Y.P. Lee T.L. Lau J.Y.W.

Joensuu H. Isola J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 632-635PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, electrophilic PGs produced by COX-2 were shown to inhibit wild-type p53 activity by covalently binding p53, preventing its nuclear accumulation (23Moos P.J. Edes K. Fitzpatrick F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9215-9220Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It has been reported that inhibition of COX-2 in a colon cancer cell line by celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, increases the nuclear localization of active p53 (24Swamy M.V. Herzog C.R. Rao C.V. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5239-5242PubMed Google Scholar). Subbaramaiah et al. (25Subbaramaiah K. Altorki N. Chung W.J. Mestre J.R. Sampat A. Dannenberg A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10911-10915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) demonstrated that p53 inhibits COX-2 expression. Recent evidence also suggests that COX-2 and p53 have reciprocal effects on cellular responses to hypoxia via modulation of HIF-1α activity (20Liu X.H. Kirschenbaum A. Lu M. Yao S. Dosoretz A.

We hypothesized that COX-2 expression in prostate cancer cells decreases wild-type p53 stability, nuclear accumulation, and activity after hypoxia, via both direct effects on p53 activation and indirectly by activation of its primary negative regulator, Mdm2. In the present study, we utilized a prostate cancer cell line, MDA-PCa-2b, as an in vitro model. This cell line expresses the wild-type p53 gene and does not express COX-2 (27Navone N.M. Olive M. Ozen M. Davis R. Troncoso P. Ty S.-M. Johnson D. Pollack A. Pathak S. von Eschenbach A.C. Logethetis C.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 2493-2500PubMed Google Scholar). We tested the effects of forced expression of COX-2 on cellular proliferation, apoptosis, and the activity of p53 and Mdm2 proteins, under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Cell Line, Cell Culture, and Reagents—The MDA-PCa-2b human prostate cancer cell line was purchased from ATCC (Gaithersburg, MD). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum under normoxic conditions (20% O2, 5% CO2, 75% N2) in a humidified Napco incubator at 37 °C. Hypoxic stimulation was produced with an ambient oxygen concentration of 0.1% using a controlled incubator with CO2/O2 monitoring and CO2/N2 gas sources. Oxygen levels were determined by an indicator. To reach a low oxygen level (0.1%), the chamber was sealed and subjected to five rounds of evacuation followed by flushing with 95% N2-5% CO2 as described by Graeber et al. (28Graeber T.G. Peterson J.F. Tasi M. Monica K. Fornace Jr., A.J. Giaccia A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6264-6277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To prevent reoxygenation of hypoxic cells, the medium or lysis buffer was pre-equilibrated to the experimental oxygen conditions overnight and added to cells on ice. Prostaglandins, i.e. PGE2, PGI2, PGF2α, and PGD2, were purchased from Cayman Co., Ann Arbor, MI. Transfection—The expression vector pcDNA-hCOX-2, containing the full-length cDNA encoding the human COX-2 gene, was a generous gift from Dr. T. Hla (Department of Physiology, University of Connecticut). Transient transfection was performed using Lipofectamine™ 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Cells used as a mock control were transfected with empty pcDNA1 vector (Invitrogen). Typically, 3 μg of plasmid DNA were used per 60-mm dish. All assays were performed after 40 h of transfections. TUNEL Assay—MDA-PCa-2b cells (mock-transfected and COX-2+ transfected) were cultured in 12-well cluster plates. Incubations were continued under either normoxic or hypoxic conditions for 8 h. After washing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, apoptotic cells were assayed using the TUNEL method with the ApopTag in situ apoptotic detection kit (Oncor, Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The labeled cells were examined using a fluorescent microscope. Preparation of Cell Lysates and Cytosolic and Nuclear Proteins— MDA-Pca-2b cells cultured under the desired conditions were lysed as described previously (17Liu X.H. Yao S. Kirschenbaum A. Levine A.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4245-4249PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped with 1.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 4 mm iodoacetate. After centrifugation, the pellets were resuspended in CHAPS extraction solution (10 mm CHAPS, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 4 mm iodoacetate in phosphate-buffered saline) with protease inhibitors. The samples were incubated for 30 min on ice and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were collected and stored at -70 °C. Proteins from the cytosolic and nuclear fractions were isolated using a commercial kit purchased from Pierce, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein content was assayed using a kit from Bio-Rad. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—For immunoprecipitation, the lysates were precleaned with protein G-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The lysates were then incubated with 1 μg of monoclonal anti-Mdm2 antibody (clone IF2) from Calbiochem, followed by the addition of protein G-Sepharose beads. The immunoprecipitated products were then subjected to Western blot analysis. For immunoblotting, the cell lysates were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, electro-phoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and incubated with targeting antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Secondary horseradish peroxidase-linked donkey anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences) was used. Filters were developed by the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies against p53, phospho-p53, and phospho-Mdm2 (Ser-166) were products from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Endogenous Mdm2 antibodies were purchased from Calbiochem, and anti-COX-2 antibodies were obtained from Transduction Labs, Lexington, KY. β-Actin was used as the internal control in all Western blot analyses. Luciferase Assay—The reporter plasmid pGL3-Luc-E1bTATA, a gift from Dr. J. Manfredi (Derald H. Ruttenberg Cancer Center, Mount Sinai School of Medicine), was used to assay p53 transcriptional activity. The plasmid contains the p21 promoter sequences and the coding region for firefly luciferase upstream of the minimal adenovirus E1b promoter. MDA-PCa-2b cells were cultured in 12-well cluster plates and co-transfected with 1 μg of the reporter plasmid or empty pGL3-Luc vector and pcDNA-hCOX-2 or empty pcDNA plasmid. Internal normalization was performed by co-transfection of a β-galactosidase expression vector driven by the CMV promoter (Clontech). Total DNA transfected into each plate was 3 μg in each 60-mm dish. After 40 h, the transfected cells were lysed by scraping into reporter buffer (Clontech), total protein concentration was determined, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were assayed and quantitated using a TD-20e luminometer. The resulting activities were normalized to protein concentrations and β-galactosidase activity. Hypoxia Induces COX-2 Expression in COX-2-transfected MDA-PCa-2b Cells—It has been reported that COX-2 expression is increased by hypoxia and cobalt chloride (a hypoxia surrogate) in human vascular endothelial cells and a metastatic prostate cancer cell line, respectively (11Schmedtji Jr., J.F. Ji Y.S. Liu W.L. DuBois R.N. Runge M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 601-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 12Liu X.H. Kirschenbaum A. Yao S. Stearns M.E. Holland J.F. Claffey K. Levine A.C. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1999; 17: 687-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In our initial studies, we examined the basal and hypoxic increase in COX-2 protein expression in mock-transfected (control) and COX-2-transfected MDA-PCa-2b cells. As shown in Fig. 1, mock-transfected MDA-PCa-2b cells do not express COX-2 protein under either normoxic or hypoxic conditions (Fig. 1A). When these cells were transfected with the COX-2 gene, we demonstrated that COX-2 protein expression is increased under hypoxic conditions in a time-dependent fashion (Fig. 1B). As the COX-2 construct utilized does not contain the promoter region of the gene, we have assumed that regulation of protein expression by hypoxia is occurring at the post-transcriptional level, a phenomenon that has previously been reported (29Dixon D.A. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2004; 10: 635-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 30Simmons D.L. Botting R.M. Hla T. Pharmacol. Rev. 2004; 56: 387-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar). COX-2 Expression Prevents Apoptosis in Hypoxic Prostate Cancer Cells—Hypoxia induces cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phases and cellular apoptosis via both p53-independent (28Graeber T.G. Peterson J.F. Tasi M. Monica K. Fornace Jr., A.J. Giaccia A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6264-6277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and p53-dependent (31Graeber T.G. Osmanian C. Jacks T. Housman D.E. Koch C.J. Lowe S.W. Giaccia A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (2171) Google Scholar, 32Kunz M. Ibrahim S.M. Mol. Cancer. 2003; 2: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 33Suzuki H. Tomida A. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5779-5788Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) pathways. We examined the effect of COX-2 on cell viability and apoptosis under hypoxic conditions. Hypoxic treatment dramatically decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis in the COX-2-, mock-transfected versus COX-2+ MDA-PCa-2b cells (Fig. 2A). TUNEL assay revealed that the decrease in viable cell numbers resulted, at least in part, from induction of apoptosis by hypoxia in the COX-2- cells. COX-2+ cells were resistant to the apoptotic effects of hypoxia (Fig. 2B). COX-2 Modulates Mdm2 Phosphorylation under Normoxic and Hypoxic Conditions—Mdm2 is a critical negative regulator of p53 protein expression, nuclear localization, and transcriptional activity (8Prives C. Cell. 1998; 95: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Both Mdm2 and p53 proteins are activated by phosphorylation. Hypoxic induction of p53 accumulation is partially modulated by decreased phosphorylation leading to decreased activation of Mdm2 (34Alarcon R. Koumenis C. Geyer R.K. Maki C.G. Giaccia A.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6046-6051PubMed Google Scholar, 35Blattner C. Hay T. Meek D.W. Lane D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6170-6182Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 demonstrates the effects of forced COX-2 expression on Mdm2 levels and phosphorylation under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Consistent with previous reports (34Alarcon R. Koumenis C. Geyer R.K. Maki C.G. Giaccia A.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6046-6051PubMed Google Scholar, 35Blattner C. Hay T. Meek D.W. Lane D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6170-6182Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), parental, mock-transfected MDA-PCa-2b cells expressed measurable basal levels of phospho-Mdm2 protein. Hypoxia significantly decreased Mdm2 phosphorylation in the COX-2-, mock-transfected cells. In contrast, forced expression of COX-2 led to an increase in Mdm2 phosphorylation under normoxic conditions. The enhanced expression of phospho-Mdm2 protein was sustained in the COX-2+ cells, even under hypoxic conditions (Fig. 3A). These data demonstrated that COX-2 not only promotes Mdm2 phosphorylation under normoxic conditions but, furthermore, prevents hypoxic inhibition of phosphorylated Mdm2 protein. In contrast, hypoxia induced a modest increase in endogenous Mdm2 levels in both control and COX-2+ cells (Fig. 3B). Fig. 3C depicts the quantitative analysis of relative expression levels of Mdm2 and phospho-Mdm2 (inactive and active Mdm2, respectively) and demonstrates that forced expression of COX-2 results in increased active, phosphorylated Mdm2 protein expression. COX-2 Abrogates Hypoxic Induction of Ser-20 Phosphorylation of p53 and Promotes the Binding of p53 to Mdm2 in Response to Hypoxia—Phosphorylation is a critical modulator of p53 activity (36Unger T. Juven-Gershon T. Moallem E. Berger M. Sionov R.V. Lozano G. Oren M. Haupt Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1805-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that phosphorylation of p53 could impede binding between p53 and Mdm2 (36Unger T. Juven-Gershon T. Moallem E. Berger M. Sionov R.V. Lozano G. Oren M. Haupt Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1805-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 37Ashcroft M. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7637-7643Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) leading to stabilization and activation of p53 protein (8Prives C. Cell. 1998; 95: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 38Shieh S.Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar). We examined the levels of p53 phosphoprotein under normoxic and hypoxic conditions in the mock-transfected versus COX-2-transfected cells. Among several potential phosphorylation sites of the p53 protein, Ser-15, Ser-20, and Ser-392 are reported to be involved in the regulation of p53 protein activation in response to a variety of stress signals (36Unger T. Juven-Gershon T. Moallem E. Berger M. Sionov R.V. Lozano G. Oren M. Haupt Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1805-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 39Hao M. Lowy A.M. Kapoor M. Deffle A. Liu G.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7656-7665Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Under normoxic conditions, there was no demonstrable p53 phosphoprotein in either cell population. In response to hypoxia, p53 protein was subjected to phosphorylation at Ser-20 only in the COX-2-negative, mock-transfected MDA-PCa-2b cells (Fig. 4A). Of note, there were no detectable levels of p53 phosphoprotein at the other sites (data not shown). In contrast, when these cells were transfected with the COX-2 gene, the induction of p53 phosphorylation at Ser-20 was abolished. Hypoxia also induced endogenous p53 protein levels in mock-transfected prostate cancer cells but had no effect on the cells that were engineered to overexpress COX-2 (Fig. 4A). To determine whether hypoxic induction of p53 phosphorylation influences the binding of the protein to Mdm2 (a critical step of p53 protein degradation), we performed immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblot analysis. As demonstrated in Fig. 4B, there was no difference in the binding of p53 to Mdm2 under aerobic conditions between the mock- and COX-2-transfected cells. In response to hypoxia, Mdm2-p53 binding was decreased in the control cells. In contrast, COX-2 gene transfection led to an increase in Mdm2-p53 binding. These results suggested a negative correlation between the amount of phospho-p53 protein (Ser-20) and the ability of p53 to bind to Mdm2. COX-2 Suppresses Basal and Hypoxic Induction of p53 Nuclear Localization—p53 protein translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus upon stress stimulation, and this nuclear targeting is essential for its activity as a transcriptional regulator (5Liang S.H. Clarke M.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2779-2783Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). A recent study reported that celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, inhibits active p53 nuclear localization in a human colon cancer cell line (24Swamy M.V. Herzog C.R. Rao C.V. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5239-5242PubMed Google Scholar). We next examined the effect of COX-2 expression on the subcellular distribution of p53 protein under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. As shown in Fig. 5, Western blotting using samples derived from the cytosolic and nuclear fractions revealed that forced expression of COX-2 resulted in cytosolic retention and decreased nuclear accumulation of p53 protein under normoxic conditions. In response to hypoxia, p53 protein translocated to the nucleus in the COX-2-, mock-transfected cells. Forced expression of COX-2 prevented the nuclear accumulation of p53 in response to hypoxia (Fig. 5). These results revealed a novel role for COX-2 in the suppression of hypoxia-induced p53 protein nuclear localization, thereby inhibiting p53 activation in response to hypoxic signals. COX-2 Inhibits Basal and Hypoxia-induced p53 Transcriptional Activities—We next investigated the effect of COX-2 expression on p53 transcriptional activity using a luciferase assay. COX-2- and COX-2+ MDA-Ca-2b cells were co-transfected with a plasmid containing the p21 promoter sequence and the coding region for firefly luciferase upstream of the minimal adenovirus E1b promoter. Fig. 6 demonstrates that COX-2-expressing cells had decreased p53 transcriptional activity as compared with COX-2- cells in normoxic conditions. COX-2 expression in these cells also prevented the hypoxic increase in p53 transcriptional activity seen in the parental, mock-transfected cells (Fig. 6). To determine whether the effects of COX-2 are the direct result of its enzymatic activity, four major prostaglandin products of the COX-catalyzed pathway, i.e. PGE2, PGI2, PGF2α, and PGD2, were tested for their possible effects on p53 activity under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. As shown in Fig. 6, although only a modest effect was seen under normoxic conditions, PGE2 exhibited a significant inhibitory effect on p53 transcriptional activity under hypoxic conditions, accounting for 90% of the effect induced by COX-2 overexpression in the same cell line. We also compared PGE2 production in COX-2-transfected and mock-transfected cells under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Parental cells that were mock-transfected had undetectable levels of PGE2. Forced expression of COX-2 in these cells increased PGE2 production, and a time-dependent further increase was observed when the cells were cultured under hypoxic conditions (data not shown). In comparison, PGF2α modestly inhibited p53 transcriptional activity in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Neither PGI2 nor PGD2 had any effect on these parameters. It is well established that the p53 tumor suppressor protein plays a critical role in cancer development and progression. There are also accumulating data implicating COX-2 overexpression and increased secretion of prostaglandins (notably PGE2) in a variety of neoplasms. Several reports confirm a reciprocal relationship between the p53 and COX-2 systems. Wild-type p53 has been shown to decrease COX-2 expression and activity (22Ristimaki A. Sivula A. Lundin J. Lundin M. Salminen T. Haglund C. Joensuu H. Isola J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 632-635PubMed Google Scholar, 25Subbaramaiah K. Altorki N. Chung W.J. Mestre J.R. Sampat A. Dannenberg A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10911-10915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Prostaglandins derived from the COX-2-catalyzed pathway inactivate wild-type p53 in colon cancer cell lines (23Moos P.J. Edes K. Fitzpatrick F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9215-9220Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Furthermore, inhibitors of COX-2 increase the activity of wild-type p53 by promoting its nuclear localization in colon cancer cells (24Swamy M.V. Herzog C.R. Rao C.V. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5239-5242PubMed Google Scholar). Although p53 is commonly mutated in solid tumors, the rate of such mutations in prostate cancer, particularly in early lesions, is not high (3Mirchandani D. Zheng J. Miller G.J. Ghosh A.K. Shibata D.K. Cote R.J. Roy-Burman P. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 92-101PubMed Google Scholar, 4Effert P.J. McCoy R.H. Walther P.J. Liu E.T. J. Urol. 1993; 150: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Our group and others, however, have demonstrated increased COX-2 expression in preneoplastic and cancerous prostate lesions (18Kirschenbaum A. Klausner A.P. Lee R. Unger P. Yao S. Liu X.H. Levine A.C. Urology. 2000; 56: 671-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). We have further shown that COX-2 inhibitors induce prostate cancer cell apoptosis in vitro and in vivo, decrease tumor angiogenesis, and decrease the levels and activity of the master oxygen sensor, HIF-1α (12Liu X.H.

Loss of p53 activity in tumor cells enhances the levels of HIF-1α and augments HIF-1-dependent activation of gene transcription (i.e. vascular endothelial cell factor) in response to hypoxia (26Ravi R. Mookerjee B. Bhujwalla Z.M. Sutter C.H. Artemov D. Zeng Q. Dillehay L.E. Madan A. Semenza G.L. Bedi A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 34-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, loss of p53 function is associated with reduced cellular apoptotic potential in response to hypoxia (31Graeber T.G. Osmanian C. Jacks T. Housman D.E. Koch C.J. Lowe S.W. Giaccia A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (2171) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that COX-2 may inhibit wild-type p53 activity, particularly under hypoxic conditions. In the present study, we demonstrated that hypoxia increases both COX-2 protein levels and p53 transcriptional activity in a human prostate cancer cell line. Forced expression of COX-2 conferred resistance to hypoxia-induced apoptosis in these prostate cancer cells. Forced expression of COX-2 also promoted Mdm2 phosphorylation under normoxic conditions and prevented hypoxia-induced decreased phosphorylation of Mdm2. The Mdm2 protein is an important inhibitor of p53 function (8Prives C. Cell. 1998; 95: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Mdm2 both represses p53 transcriptional activity and promotes the degradation of p53 by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. It has previously been demonstrated that phosphorylation of Mdm2 is essential for its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where it binds and inactivates p53 (41Mayo L.D. Donner D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11598-11603Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar, 42Roth J. Dobbelstein M. Freedman D.A. Shenk T. Levine A.J.

It has also been reported that hypoxia-induced p53 accumulation and stabilization is through hypophosphorylation of Mdm2 and down-regulation of Mdm2 protein expression (34Alarcon R. Koumenis C. Geyer R.K. Maki C.G. Giaccia A.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6046-6051PubMed Google Scholar, 35Blattner C. Hay T. Meek D.W. Lane D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6170-6182Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In addition, Mdm2 has been linked to the regulation of p53 nucleocytoplasmic trafficking (5Liang S.H. Clarke M.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2779-2783Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 42Roth J. Dobbelstein M. Freedman D.A. Shenk T. Levine A.J.

Our findings demonstrated that at least one mechanism whereby COX-2 inhibits hypoxic activation of p53 is via phosphorylation and activation of Mdm2. One of the most obvious ways to protect p53 from Mdm2-mediated degradation is to prevent physical interactions between the two proteins. The structural requirements for p53/Mdm2 interactions indicate that phosphorylation at sites within the N terminus of p53 (including serine 15, 20, and 33) may impede binding of the two proteins (36Unger T. Juven-Gershon T. Moallem E. Berger M. Sionov R.V. Lozano G. Oren M. Haupt Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1805-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 37Ashcroft M. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7637-7643Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). We have reported that forced expression of COX-2 directly modulated p53 activity via effects on p53 protein phosphorylation, nuclear localization, and transcriptional activity. In COX-2-null MDA-PCa-2B cells, hypoxia increased p53 phosphorylation at Ser-20, a critical phosphorylation site involved in its nuclear translocation, activation, and protection from degradation (36Unger T. Juven-Gershon T. Moallem E. Berger M. Sionov R.V. Lozano G. Oren M. Haupt Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1805-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 44Dumaz N. Milne D.M. Jardine L.J. Meek D.W. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 459-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Overexpression of COX-2 inhibited hypoxia-induced phosphorylation at Ser-20, thereby enhancing the binding between p53 and Mdm2, leading to p53 protein ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. In addition, we provided evidence that overexpression of COX-2 suppressed basal and hypoxia-induced nuclear translocation of p53 protein. Finally, COX-2-expressing cells had decreased p53 transcriptional activity as compared with COX-2-null cells, under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Exogenous addition of PGE2, a major product of the COX-2-catalyzed pathway, mimicked the effect of COX-2 overexpression on the repression of p53 transcriptional activity in response to hypoxia. Both PGE2 and PGF2α addition partially mimicked the effect of COX-2 overexpression on p53 transcriptional activity under normoxic conditions. Although these results implied that effects on p53 activity are primarily mediated by COX-2-dependent pathways, we cannot rule out some COX-2-independent effects in this model system. Our results demonstrated that COX-2 can inhibit wild-type p53 activation, particularly in response to hypoxic signals, via direct modulation of p53 protein as well as through the activation of the p53 inhibitor Mdm2. Somatic mutation of p53 is probably a late event in prostate oncogenesis. However, epigenetic modifications of p53 with resultant inactivation of its function have been reported in other tumors (23Moos P.J. Edes K. Fitzpatrick F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9215-9220Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 24Swamy M.V. Herzog C.R. Rao C.V. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5239-5242PubMed Google Scholar). Our results provided a possible link between overexpression of COX-2 and inactivation of wild-type p53 function in prostate cancer cells. These effects were most evident under hypoxic conditions and may help explain the relative chemo- and radiation-resistance of hypoxic prostate cancer cells, even those expressing wild-type p53. These data implied that inhibition of COX-2 can restore normal p53 function in response to intratumoral hypoxia and thereby render the cells more sensitive to therapeutic regimens. We thank Dr. T. Hla for the COX-2 expression vector and Dr. J. Manfredi for the pGL3-Luc-E1bTATA vector."
https://openalex.org/W2022398967,"The p21-activated kinases (PAKs) contain an N-terminal Cdc42/Rac interactive binding domain, which in the group 1 PAKs (PAK1, 2, and 3) regulates the activity of an adjacent conserved autoinhibitory domain. In contrast, the group 2 PAKs (PAK4, 5, and 6) lack this autoinhibitory domain and are not activated by Cdc42/Rac binding, and the mechanisms that regulate their kinase activity have been unclear. This study found that basal PAK6 kinase activity was repressed by a p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase antagonist and could be strongly stimulated by constitutively active MAP kinase kinase 6 (MKK6), an upstream activator of p38 MAP kinases. Mutation of a consensus p38 MAP kinase target site at serine 165 decreased PAK6 kinase activity. Moreover, PAK6 was directly activated by MKK6, and mutation of tyrosine 566 in a consensus MKK6 site (threonine-proline-tyrosine, TPY) in the activation loop of the PAK6 kinase domain prevented activation by MKK6. PAK6 activation by MKK6 was also blocked by mutation of an autophosphorylated serine (serine 560) in the PAK6 activation loop, indicating that phosphorylation of this site is necessary for MKK6-mediated activation. PAK4 and PAK5 were similarly activated by MKK6, consistent with a conserved TPY motif in their activation domains. The activation of PAK6 by both p38 MAP kinase and MKK6 suggests that PAK6 plays a role in the cellular response to stress-related signals.

Binding of p21 is mediated by an N-terminal Cdc42/Rac interactive binding (CRIB) domain, and biochemical and crystal structure analyses of PAK1 have shown that the CRIB domain regulates the inhibitory activity of an adjacent autoinhibitory domain (AID). In the absence of p21 GTPase binding, PAK1 exists as an autoinhibited dimer in which the N-terminal AID of one PAK1 molecule in the dimer binds to the other catalytic domain and blocks its function. Binding of GTP-Cdc42 or -Rac causes the AID to dissociate from the catalytic domain and activates its kinase activity, with subsequent phosphorylation of sites in the N-terminal regulatory domain and in the activation loop of the kinase domain serving to maintain the activated state (1Lei M.

Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 73-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar).The N-terminal CRIB domain and AID are highly conserved in human PAK2 and PAK3, and these PAKs have been categorized with PAK1 as group 1 PAKs. PAK6 was initially identified in yeast two-hybrid screens for androgen receptor-interacting proteins (3Lee S.R. Ramos S.M. Ko A. Masiello D. Swanson K.D. Lu M.L. Balk S.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 85-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 4Yang F. Li X. Sharma M. Zarnegar M. Lim B. Sun Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15345-15353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). PAK6 has a C-terminal kinase domain with homology to the group 1 PAKs and an N-terminal CRIB domain. However, PAK6 lacks the conserved AID and is not stimulated by ligation of its CRIB domain, which binds selectively to GTP-Cdc42 (3Lee S.R. Ramos S.M. Ko A. Masiello D. Swanson K.D. Lu M.L. Balk S.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 85-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Human PAK4 and PAK5 similarly lack the conserved AID and along with PAK6 comprise the group 2 PAKs (5Jaffer Z.M. Chernoff J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 713-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar).Group 1 PAKs (PAK1, PAK2, and PAK3) are involved in the regulation of diverse cellular processes such as cell motility, morphology, cytoskeletal reorganization, and gene regulation. Much less is known about the regulation and function of group 2 PAKs (PAK4, PAK5, and PAK6). PAK4 is expressed ubiquitously, and activated PAK4 has been shown to mediate cytoskeleton reorganization and filopodia formation (6Abo A. Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Dan C. Fritsch A. Baud V. Belisle B. Minden A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6527-6540Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 7Dan C. Kelly A. Bernard O. Minden A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32115-32121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of PAK4 results in embryonic lethality. PAK5 is highly expressed in brain and neuronal tissues and has been shown to promote neuron outgrowth during development. RNA blot analyses have shown that PAK6 is expressed most highly in brain and testes and at lower levels in multiple tissues including prostate and breast. In transfection studies, PAK6 has been shown to suppress androgen receptor transcriptional activity and similarly bind to and repress estrogen receptor (3Lee S.R. Ramos S.M. Ko A. Masiello D. Swanson K.D. Lu M.L. Balk S.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 85-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).The mechanisms that regulate the group 2 PAKs are unclear, but the absence of a conserved AID indicates that the modes of regulation differ from the group I PAKs. In the current study, we describe a novel mechanism of PAK6 regulation by the MKK6-p38 MAP kinase pathway. Our results demonstrate that MKK6 activates PAK6 by targeting two separate sites, a consensus p38 MAP kinase substrate site (Ser-165) and a tyrosine (Tyr-566) in the activation loop of the kinase domain. Significantly, this tyrosine is part of an MKK6 substrate motif (threonine-X-tyrosine) that is conserved in the group 1 and 2 PAKs but is otherwise largely restricted to activation loops of MAP kinases, where it undergoes direct dual phosphorylation by MAP kinase kinases. This study further shows that MKK6-mediated activation does not alter the autophosphorylation of a regulatory serine in the activation loop of PAK6 (Ser-560), which is also conserved in the activation loop of all PAKs. Moreover, this serine is required for MKK6-p38 MAP kinase activation of PAK6. Taken together, the results in this study indicate that PAK6 is regulated by MKK6 and p38 MAP kinase and that the PAK6 activation loop is regulated by both MKK6 and autophosphorylation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and Reagent—p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB203508 and MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 were purchased from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA). cAMP-dependent protein kinase activator forskolin and histone H4 were purchased from Sigma. c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase inhibitor SP600125, PI3K inhibitor LY 294002, and MEK1 inhibitor U0126 were purchased from Calbiochem.

The site-directed mutagenesis was performed based on the manufacturer's protocol.Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) supplemented with antibiotics and 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were transfected by electroporation with a total of 10 μg of plasmid DNA using a Gene Pulser from Bio-Rad.Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE with a standard reducing protocol. Following electrophoresis, the proteins were electroblotted to a nitrocellulose membrane. The protein bands were visualized by Ponceau S red staining. The blots were blocked by 5% nonfat dry milk, 0.05% Tween 20, and 1% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 135 mm NaCl). Immunoblotting was performed with designated antibodies and visualized with an ECL detection system (Pierce) following the manufacturer's protocol.Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation of PAK6 and proteins containing phosphotyrosine was employed following a standard protocol. In brief, the cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 135 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.25% (w/v) deoxycholate, and 0.05% (w/v) SDS and supplemented with protease inhibitors (2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm EDTA).

The supernatants were incubated with individual antibodies (1 μg) and protein A-Sepharose beads (20 μl of packed beads) at 4 °C for 1 h. At the end of incubation, the beads were washed five times with lysis buffer. The resulting immunoprecipitated immunocomplexes were solubilized in 40 μl of Laemmli sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The protein complex was detected by Western blot analysis and developed by ECL (Pierce; Supersignal).In Vitro Kinase Assay—Kinase reactions of immunoprecipitated PAK6 were performed in kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μm ATP) supplemented with 2.5 μg/reaction of histone H4 and 20 μCi/reaction of radioactive ATP. The reactions were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C and stopped by the addition of sample buffer containing SDS. The reactions were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography of radiolabeled protein was performed.RESULTSPAK6 Is Inhibited by p38 MAP Kinase Antagonist—In contrast to PAK1, PAK6 exhibits readily detectable basal kinase activity even in the absence of exogenous stimulation. To determine the molecular mechanisms that regulate PAK6 kinase activity, we tested a group of agents with known specificity either as inhibitors or as activators of their respective pathways. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with HA-tagged PAK6 for 24 h and then treated with drugs for 1 h prior to immunoprecipitation with an anti-HA antibody. Kinase activities in the immunoprecipitates were then measured by in vitro kinase assays, using histone H4 as an exogenous substrate. Among nine tested agents, only the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB203580 exhibited inhibitory effects on PAK6 kinase activity, with reduced autophosphorylation and reduced phosphorylation of the exogenous histone H4 substrate (Fig. 1).PAK6 Is Activated by p38 MAP Kinase Upstream Activator MKK6 —Inhibition of PAK6 kinase activity by SB203580 suggested that the p38 MAP kinase pathway was regulating PAK6 activity. To further test this possibility, we co-transfected HEK293 cells with HA-tagged PAK6 and a constitutively active MKK6, MKK6(EE), an upstream activator of p38 MAP kinase (9Han J. Lee J.D. Jiang Y.

Damaraju S. Rottapel R. Zanke B. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5076-5082PubMed Google Scholar). The effect on PAK6 kinase activity was then assessed by in vitro immunoprecipitation kinase assays. As shown in Fig. 2A, MKK6(EE) caused an increase in PAK6 autophosphorylation and histone H4 phosphorylation. Immunoblotting of the immunoprecipitates with the anti-HA antibody confirmed that PAK6 protein expression was not altered, indicating that MKK6(EE) increased PAK6 kinase activity (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2MKK6-induced PAK6 activation is down-regulated by SB203580. A, 293 cells were transiently co-transfected with both HA-PAK6 and various dosages of constitutively active mutant MKK6(EE). In vitro kinase activity was assessed by a kinase assay on the immunoprecipitated PAK6. B, equal amounts of PAK6 from the immunoprecipitation in A were immunoblotted with anti-HA. C, the effect of SB203580 on MKK6-activated PAK6 kinase activity was measured by an IP/kinase assay using cell lysates of 293 cells transiently co-transfected with MKK6 and PAK6 that were treated with or without SB203580. D, the phosphorylation status of p38 MAP kinase in response to MKK6 activation was confirmed by Western blot analysis using an anti-p38 phospho-specific antibody (upper panel) or total p38 (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The involvement of p38 MAP kinase in this PAK6 activation by MKK6(EE) was examined by assessing the inhibitory effect of SB203580. Significantly, although SB203580 markedly down-regulated PAK6 activity in the absence of MKK6(EE), it only partially inhibited the MKK6(EE)-induced activation of PAK6 (Fig. 2C). This partial inhibition was consistent with the high level of p38 MAP kinase activation in the MKK6(EE)-transfected cells (Fig. 2D). However, the substantial PAK6 activation in the MKK6(EE)-transfected and SB203580-treated cells also suggested a p38 MAP kinase-independent mechanism for PAK6 activation.To further address the role of p38 MAP kinase in PAK6 activation, we attempted to identify a site that was phosphorylated by p38 MAP kinase. Aided by an on-line kinase substrate site analysis, Scansite (scansite.mit.edu), we identified a potential p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation site at serine 165 of PAK6. To characterize the role of Ser-165 in p38 MAP kinase-mediated PAK6 activation, we generated a serine-to-alanine (S165A) substitution mutant of PAK6 by site-directed mutagenesis. Consistent with SB203580 down-regulation of PAK6 kinase activity, substitution of Ser-165 with alanine dramatically reduced basal PAK6 kinase activity (Fig. 3A, lane 1 versus lane 3) as well as MKK6-stimulated activity (Fig. 3A, lane 2 versus lane 7). However, despite the down-regulation of kinase activity in the PAK6 S165A mutant, it remained responsive to MKK6-induced activation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). Fig. 3B shows that the serine-to-alanine mutation, or MKK6 co-transfection, did not markedly alter PAK6 protein expression. Taken together, these findings indicated PAK6 could be activated by p38 MAP kinase-mediated phosphorylation of serine 165 but also suggested a second mechanism for activation by MKK6.Fig. 3Substituting serine 165 with alanine down-regulates MKK6-induced PAK6 activation. A, 293 cells were transiently cotransfected with HA-PAK6 WT or S165A and with various dosages of constitutively active mutant MKK6(EE).

To test this hypothesis, a series of PAK6 deletion mutants were employed to map additional region(s) of PAK6 that may participate in the MKK6-p38 MAP kinase-induced activation. Although the basal activities varied, co-transfected MKK6(EE) remained effective in up-regulating the kinase activities of PAK6 deletion mutants that extend from the N terminus to the region covering only the catalytic domain (Δ368 deletion mutant) (Fig. 4A). The levels of expression of wild type and deletion mutants in the control and MKK6(EE) co-transfected groups were similar, as shown in Fig. 4B. This result suggested that additional sites in the kinase domain were susceptible to activation by MKK6.Fig. 4Mapping PAK6 domain susceptible to MKK6-induced activation. A, 293 cells were co-transfected with MKK6(EE) and HA-tagged PAK6 WT full length and N-terminal deletion mutants Δ190, Δ292, or Δ368, respectively, for 24 h (all with N-terminal HA tags). The kinase activities of PAK6 WT, and N-terminal deletion mutants were determined by an IP kinase assay using anti-HA 12CA5 mAb.

No additional candidate p38 MAP kinase sites were found, but the activation loop contained a threonine-proline-tyrosine (TPY) sequence (residues 564–566) that resembled the substrate motif (TXY) recognized by MKK6 (14Jiang Y.

This motif was also present in the activation loop of MAP kinases and PAK1–6 but not in most other kinases (see Fig. 8A). MKK6 is a dual specificity kinase that recognizes and phosphorylates both threonine and tyrosine residues on the TXY motif of its substrate. The identification of TPY within the PAK6 activation loop suggested that PAK6 might be a direct substrate of MKK6. If this is the case, then one should detect increased tyrosine phosphorylation of PAK6 upon MKK6(EE)-induced activation. Reciprocal immunoprecipitation (IP)/Western blot analyses were performed to test this possibility.Fig. 8Specificity of MKK6-induced PAK activation. A, sequence alignment of the activation loop region between catalytic subdomains VII and VIII of PAKs and MAP kinase family members. In both group 1 and group 2 PAKs, in addition to the previously defined autophosphorylated threonine or serine residues, a conserved TXY motif was also found within the activation loop. B, kinase activity of MKK6-modulated PAKs. 293 cells were co-transfected with MKK6(EE) and one of the following HA-tagged PAK family members: PAK1, PAK4, PAK5, or PAK6. Additionally, PAK1 was also tested by co-transfecting with a constitutive active Cdc42-V12. The kinase activity was determined by an in vitro kinase assay with anti-HA mAb immunoprecipitated kinases and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. C, Western blot demonstrated the comparable level of expression within individual PAK testing group. D, quantitation of kinase reactions from B using a PhosphorImager.

An increase in tyrosine phosphorylation in the anti-PAK6 immunoprecipitates was detected when PAK6 was co-expressed with MKK6(EE) (Fig. 5A). In contrast, no change in tyrosine phosphorylation of PAK6 was detected when it was co-transfected with the constitutively active MKK1(DD), a related member of the MAP kinase kinase family (16Milanini J. Vinals F. Pouyssegur J. Pages G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18165-18172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting with anti-HA showed that the immunoprecipitates contained comparable levels of total PAK6 (Fig. 5B). In the reciprocal experiment, the lysates were immunoprecipitated with the antiphosphotyrosine 4G10 antibody and then immunoblotted for PAK6. As shown in Fig. 5C, MKK6 co-transfection increased the level of PAK6 that was immunoprecipitated by anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10.Fig. 5Tyrosine phosphorylation of PAK6 by MKK6 but not by MKK1. 293 cells were co-transfected with HA-PAK6 and MKK6(EE) or MKK1(DD) and further incubated for 24 h. PAK6 was immunoprecipitated with anti-PAK6(B16) antiserum or with anti-phosphotyrosine (α-PY) 4G10 mAb. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by reciprocal Western blot analysis. In both A and C, an increased tyrosine phosphorylation of PAK6 was evident in MKK6(EE) co-transfected group. B, comparable levels of PAK6 in the anti-PAK6(B16) immunoprecipitates were demonstrated by Western blot using anti-HA mAb.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further address the phosphorylation of Tyr-566 by MKK6, a dual specificity phosphatase, MKP-1, which can dephosphorylate both threonine and tyrosine on the TXY motif (17Clark A.R. J. Endocrinol. 2003; 178: 5-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), was tested in IP/Western blot experiments. MKP-1 co-transfection in the absence of MKK6(EE) markedly decreased the basal tyrosine phosphorylation of PAK6 (Fig. 6, A and B, lane 1 versus lane 3). MKP-1 co-transfection similarly reduced the level of MKK6-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PAK6 (Fig. 6, A and B, lane 2 versus lane 4). Fig. 6C demonstrates that total PAK6 expression levels were not altered by MKP-1 (lane 1 versus lane 3 and lane 2 versus lane 4). Finally, in vitro kinase assays were carried out to assess the correlation between the loss of tyrosine phosphorylation induced by MKP-1 and PAK6 kinase activity. Consistent with the tyrosine phosphorylation results, MKP-1 down-regulated basal and MKK6-stimulated PAK6 kinase activity on the exogenous histone H4 substrate (Fig. 6D). Basal autophosphorylation was also decreased by MKP-1, although the effects on autophosphorylation in the MKK6-transfected cells were less prominent.Fig. 6Down-regulation of MKK6-induced PAK6 tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activation by dual specificity phosphatase MKP-1. 293 cells were co-transfected with HA-PAK6 and MKK6(EE) or MKP-1 and further incubated for 24 h. PAK6 was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA 12CA5 mAb or with anti-phosphotyrosine (αPY) 4G10 mAb. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by reciprocal Western blot analysis. The results are shown in A and B. MKP-1 dephosphorylates PAK6 tyrosine residue under basal and MKK6-stimulated conditions, as evident from the reduced immunoreactivity of PAK6 with anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 mAb. C, comparable amounts of PAK6 in lysates derived from each group were demonstrated by Western blot analysis. D, down-regulation of PAK6 kinase activity by MKP-1 co-transfection was demonstrated by an IP kinase assay using 293 cells co-transfected with PAK6 and with MKK6(EE) or MKP-1. Kinase activity was determined by an in vitro kinase assay with [32P]ATP using the anti-HA immunoprecipitated kinase and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Substitution of Tyr-566 with Phenylalanine Down-regulates PAK6 Activation by MKK6 —To assess more directly the involvement of Tyr-566 phosphorylation in PAK6 activation, we generated a mutant PAK6 (Y566F) by substituting the Tyr-566 residue with a phenylalanine. This mutation markedly reduced the level of basal PAK6 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 7, A and B, lane 1 versus lane 3). Similarly, the Y566F mutation markedly reduced the tyrosine phosphorylation stimulated by MKK6 (Fig. 7, A and B, lane 2 versus lane 4). Fig. 7C demonstrates that the wild type and mutant PAK6 constructs were expressed at comparable levels. These results indicated that Tyr-566 was a major site of basal and MKK6-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation, although perhaps not the only site, because the Y566F mutation did not completely eliminate MKK6-induced tyrosine phosphorylation.Fig. 7Substitution of Tyr-566 with phenylalanine (Y566F) dampens MKK6-stimulated PAK6 activation. Levels of tyrosine phosphorylation were evaluated between PAK6 WT and Y566F mutant by IP/Western blot analysis using 293 cells transiently expressing MKK6-(EE) and PAK6 (WT or Y566F). PAK6 was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA 12CA5 mAb or with anti-phosphotyrosine (α-PY) 4G10 mAb. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by reciprocal Western blot. The results are shown in A and B. Reduced levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of PAK6 in basal and MKK6-stimuated conditions were evident in the Y566F group. C, Western blot demonstrated the comparable amount of PAK6 in anti-HA immunoprecipitates. D, in vitro IP Kinase assay demonstrated down-regulation of PAK6 kinase activity by substituting tyrosine 566 with phenylalanine (Y566F) at both basal nonstimulated and MKK6-stimulated conditions (lanes 3 and 4). Double mutation of serine 165 and tyrosine 566 (S165A/Y566F) abrogated MKK6-induced PAK6 activation (lanes 7 and 8).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next examined the effects of the Y566F mutation on basal and MKK6-stimulated PAK6 kinase activity. Substitution of Tyr-566 with phenylalanine reduced basal PAK6 autophosphorylation and kinase activity toward the exogenous histone H4 substrate (Fig. 7D, lane 1 versus lane 3) and reduced the magnitude of MKK6-stimulated PAK6 kinase activation (Fig. 7D, lane 2 versus lane 4). Moreover, a double mutation of S165A and Y566F completely abrogated the MKK6-stimulated PAK6 activation (Fig. 7D, lane 8). Therefore, although MKK6 may directly or indirectly stimulate the phosphorylation of additional tyrosines, serine 165 and tyrosine 566 appear to be th"

Little is known about the initial docking of Glut4 vesicles with the plasma membrane. A recent report has implicated Exo70, a component of the mammalian exocyst complex, in the initial interaction of Glut4 vesicles with the adipocyte plasma membrane.

We further show that adenoviral-mediated overexpression of either rsec6 or rsec8 increases the magnitude of insulin-stimulated glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. By contrast, overexpression of rsec6 or rsec8 did not increase the extent of the secretion of adipsin or ACRP30 from adipocytes and had no discernible effect on transferrin receptor traffic.

Insulin-stimulated glucose transport in adipose cells is known to be mediated by the mobilization of intracellular glucose transporter (Glut4)-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane, where they dock and fuse, resulting in increased levels of Glut4 at the cell surface (reviewed in Ref. 1Bryant N.J. Govers R. James D.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar).

The exocytic delivery of intracellular Glut4-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane can be conceptually resolved into distinct stages: the trafficking of Glut4 vesicles to the plasma membrane, their initial association with the plasma membrane (“docking”), and the subsequent fusion of the two lipid bilayers. Some of the molecules that are required for these distinct stages have been identified, including the SNARE 1The abbreviations used are: SNARE, soluble NSF attachment protein receptors; NSF, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor; LDM, light density microsomes; deGlc, 2-deoxy-d-glucose; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; IRAP, insulin responsive aminopeptidase. 1The abbreviations used are: SNARE, soluble NSF attachment protein receptors; NSF, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor; LDM, light density microsomes; deGlc, 2-deoxy-d-glucose; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; IRAP, insulin responsive aminopeptidase. proteins that mediate the terminal fusion step (see for example Refs. 1Bryant N.J.

However, the machinery involved in the initial docking step has, until recently, been elusive.Studies of the late-acting Sec mutants in yeast have identified a 19.5 S complex containing sec3p, sec5p, sec6p, sec8p, sec10p, sec15p, sec4p, and Exo70 (6Bowser R.

This complex, subsequently termed the exocyst, is localized to the tip of the yeast bud, the main site of exocytosis, and was proposed as a candidate for the initial docking/targeting interactions of exocytic vesicles with the plasma membrane (9Hsu S-C. Hazuka C.D. Foletti D.L. Scheller R.H. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 150-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Subsequently, mammalian homologues of many of the proteins in this complex have been identified and shown to function in exocytic events, for example targeted exocytosis such as the delivery of transport containers to the basolateral membrane of polarized cells, and in neuronal cell exocytosis (9Hsu S-C.

Interestingly, a recent report identified Exo70 as a candidate molecule involved in Glut4 vesicle exocytosis in adipocytes (16Inoue M. Chang L. Hwang J. Chiang S-H. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2003; 422: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Exo70 was found to potentiate insulin-stimulated glucose transport. By contrast, an Exo70 mutant inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose transport but not Glut4 translocation to the plasma membrane, presumably by interfering with an initial docking stage or preventing the Glut4 vesicle from accessing the correct fusion site within the plane of the plasma membrane (16Inoue M. Chang L. Hwang J. Chiang S-H. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2003; 422: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Although compelling, these data did not address the generality of the role of Exo70 in adipocyte exocytosis, and the role of other exocyst components was not addressed.In this study, we have examined the role of two other exocyst components, rsec6 and rsec8, in adipocyte exocytosis. We show that insulin promotes a redistribution of rsec6 and rsec8 to the plasma membrane and to cytoskeletal fractions within 3T3-L1 adipocytes but does not modulate levels of these proteins colocalized with Glut4. We further show that adenoviral-mediated overexpression of either rsec6 or rsec8 increases the magnitude of insulin-stimulated glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Overexpression of rsec6 or rsec8 was without effect on the secretion of adipsin or ACRP30 from adipocytes or on transferrin receptor traffic. Taken together, these data support a role for the exocyst selectively in insulin-stimulated glucose transport and is consistent with the notion of an important role for this complex in regulated exocytosis. We suggest a model by which insulin-dependent relocation of the exocyst to the plasma membrane and/or sites of insulin-signaling molecules may contribute to the specificity of Glut4 vesicle docking and fusion with the adipocyte plasma membrane.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Antibodies specific for Glut4 were those described in Ref. 17Brant A.M.

Cell surface transferrin receptor levels were determined exactly as outlined in Ref. 20Millar C.A. Meerloo T. Martin S. Hickson G.R.X. Shimwell N.J. Wakelam M.J.O. James D.E. Gould G.W.

In agreement with published data (16Inoue M. Chang L. Hwang J. Chiang S-H. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2003; 422: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), we consistently observed an increase in the plasma membrane content of rsec6 and rsec8 in response to acute insulin treatment; however, we also reproducibly observed increased levels of rsec6 and rsec8 associated with the LDM fraction (Fig. 1, A and B). Since the LDM fraction of 3T3-L1 adipocytes is known to comprise both membrane and cytoskeletal elements (23Clark S.F. Martin S. Carozzi A.J. Hill M.M. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1211-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 24Clark S.F. Molero J.C. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3819-3826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), we further fractionated LDMs by velocity sedimentation analysis. This approach has previously been shown to effectively separate Gut4-containing membranes from the cytoskeletal and signaling elements known to populate the LDM fraction (23Clark S.F. Martin S. Carozzi A.J. Hill M.M. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1211-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 24Clark S.F. Molero J.C. James D.E. J. Biol.

Fig. 1C shows that the amount of rsec6 or rsec8 associated with Glut4- or IRAP-positive membranes (fractions 6–12 in the experiment shown) is modest. Most of the immunoreactive rsec6 and rsec8 is located within fractions 11–14, which are enriched in signaling molecules such as IRS-1 and also in high levels of cytoskeletal elements such as actin and vimentin (data not shown). Although the amount of rsec6 or rsec8 associated with the membranous component of the LDMs did not change in response to insulin, we consistently observed an increase in the rsec6 and rsec8 content of the cytoskeletal fraction (compare lanes 11–14 with or without insulin). Immunoadsorption of Glut4-containing vesicles did not reveal the presence of either rsec6 or rsec8 in these structures (data not shown).To probe the functional role of the exocyst, we developed recombinant adenoviruses to overexpress FLAG-tagged rsec6 or rsec8 in these cells. Fig. 2 shows that these viruses are capable of driving high level overexpression of these proteins in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We calculate that our typical infection conditions overexpress rsec6 or rsec8 between 3- and 7-fold. Neither the commercial anti-sec6 or anti-sec8 antibodies nor anti-FLAG gave good staining for immunofluorescence; thus, we have been unable to localize these proteins in cells by this means.Fig. 2Overexpression of FLAG-tagged rsec6 or rsec8. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were infected with empty virus (Control) or viruses designed to drive overexpression of rsec6 or rsec8 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Lysates were then prepared as outlined and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG antibodies. Data from a representative experiment are shown; the values to the left indicate the approximate positions of molecular mass markers (in kDa).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next assayed membrane trafficking events in cells overexpressing rsec6 or rsec8. Fig. 3 shows that neither the rate of the secretion of ACRP30 or adipsin nor cell surface levels of transferrin receptors were modulated by overexpression of these proteins. We assayed the secretion of both ACRP30 and adipsin over a range of time courses from 2 to 30 min and found no discernible differences in the extent of secretion upon overexpression of either rsec6 or rsec8 (Fig. 3A). Similarly, neither the levels of transferrin receptors at the surface of adipocytes nor the ability of insulin to promote increased cell surface transferrin receptor levels were altered by overexpression of any of the exocyst components (Fig. 3B).Fig. 3rsec6 or rsec8 overexpression does not modulate secretion or transferrin receptor (TfR) traffic. A shows a typical immunoblot analysis of ACRP30 secretion from adipocytes infected with empty virus (Sh) or virus driving overexpression of rsec6 (6F) or rsec8 (8F). In the experiment shown, secretion was assayed at 10 or 20 min (see “Experimental Procedures”). The analysis of many experiments of this type demonstrated no effect of rsec6 or rsec8 overexpression on the secretion of ACRP30 or adipsin. B shows an analysis of cell surface transferrin receptor levels in 3T3-L1 adipocytes infected with empty virus or virus designed to overexpress rsec6 or rsec8, assayed by 125I-transferrin binding as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” The data are presented as mean ± S.D. from triplicate wells at each point, expressed as a percentage of the binding to the surface of basal, empty-virus infected cells. Data from a typical experiment, repeated four times, are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next examined the effect of overexpression of rsec6 or rsec8 on insulin-stimulated deGlc transport. As shown in Fig. 4, overexpression of rsec6 or rsec8 significantly enhanced the maximum rate of insulin-stimulated deGlc uptake. Although there was a tendency toward an increase in the rate by which insulin stimulated glucose transport, this did not reach significance in every experiment. The dose dependence of insulin-stimulated deGlc uptake was not enhanced by overexpression of these proteins (data not shown). In control experiments, we have shown that the total cellular levels of Glut4 are unchanged after overexpression of rsec6 or rsec8.2Fig. 4rsec6 and rsec8 overexpression increases maximal insulin-stimulated deGlc uptake. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were infected with empty virus, rsec6, or rsec8-virus, and deGlc uptake was determined as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” After 2 h in serum-free medium, cells were rapidly washed in Krebs Ringer phosphate buffer at 37 °C and then incubated in the same in the presence or absence of insulin for the indicated times. Shown are representative experiments from over six experiments of this type, each point representing triplicate determinations (± S.D.) at each condition. In A, filled circles are empty-virus infected cells, and open circles are cells overexpressing rsec8. In B, filled circles are empty-virus infected cells, and open circles are cells overexpressing rsec6.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe mechanisms that govern Glut4-containing vesicle targeting, docking, and fusion at the adipocyte plasma membrane remain only partially understood. A significant advance in this regard was recently provided by Saltiel and co-workers (16Inoue M. Chang L. Hwang J. Chiang S-H. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2003; 422: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), who identified Exo70 as a candidate molecule involved in Glut4 vesicle exocytosis. They observed that overexpression of Exo70 increased insulin-stimulated glucose transport. By contrast, an Exo70 mutant inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose transport but not Glut4 translocation to the plasma membrane, presumably by interfering with an initial docking stage or preventing the Glut4 vesicle from accessing the correct fusion site within the plane of the plasma membrane (16Inoue M. Chang L. Hwang J. Chiang S-H. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2003; 422: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Although compelling, these data did not address the generality of the role of Exo70 in adipocyte exocytosis, and the role of other exocyst components was not addressed. Here, we have sought to establish whether other exocyst components are involved in Glut4 translocation, in particular, sec6 and sec8.In agreement with the data of Inoue et al. (16Inoue M. Chang L. Hwang J. Chiang S-H. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2003; 422: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), we observed insulin-stimulated rsec6 and rsec8 translocation to the plasma membrane; such data argue for an important role in insulin action in these cells. Interestingly, we found little rsec6 or rsec8 associated with Glut4-containing membranes, but rather, the majority was present in a cytosolic pool or associated with structures enriched in cytoskeletal elements and components of the insulin signaling cascade. Our data differ somewhat from those of Inoue et al. (16Inoue M. Chang L. Hwang J. Chiang S-H. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2003; 422: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) in that in our hands, the level of rsec6 and rsec8 associated with the LDM fraction is increased upon insulin stimulation, whereas Inoue et al. report a decrease. There are several potential explanations for this. Firstly, it should be noted that we have used longer times of incubation with insulin (30 min as compared with 2–10 min in Inoue et al. (16Inoue M. Chang L. Hwang J. Chiang S-H. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2003; 422: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar)), and the association/dissociation of the complex may vary between such times. Secondly, we have used subtly different fractionation conditions that may explain these differences. This is particularly important since the LDM fraction has been shown to contain significant levels of cytoskeletal elements (23Clark S.F. Martin S. Carozzi A.J. Hill M.M. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1211-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 24Clark S.F. Molero J.C. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3819-3826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Here, we show that upon detailed analysis of the LDM fraction, the cytoskeletal-enriched fractions exhibit an insulin-dependent increase in rsec6 and rsec8 content. Thus, subtly different fractionation conditions or buffers could alter the levels of these fractions in the LDM and may give rise to the differences between our data and those of Inoue et al (16Inoue M. Chang L. Hwang J. Chiang S-H. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2003; 422: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). This distinction apart, the observation that insulin promotes increased rsec6 and rsec8 levels at the plasma membrane with decreased levels in the cytosolic pool is consistent between both studies. This supports the notion developed in other experimental systems that the exocyst is a dynamic complex, the assembly and disassembly of which may be acutely regulated, and supports the hypothesis that the exocyst is important in the membrane trafficking events stimulated by insulin. However, insulin is known to promote a range of trafficking events, including Glut4 translocation, increased endosomal traffic (such as elevations in cell surface transferrin receptors (19Millar C.A.

Oppenheimer C.L. Czech M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4028-4032Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar)), and increased rates of the secretion of molecules such as adipsin and ACRP30 (20Millar C.A. Meerloo T. Martin S. Hickson G.R.X.

Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1014: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, we sought to determine whether the exocyst functioned in one or all of these pathways. To achieve this, we overexpressed wild-type rsec6 or rsec8 using adenoviruses (Fig. 2). Fig. 3 reveals that the rate of the secretion of ACRP30/adiponectin and adipsin was unaffected by overexpression of these exocyst components. Similarly, the levels of cell surface transferrin receptors were largely unchanged. By contrast"

The formation of a specific ternary complex of microtubules, Hexaflutax (7-O-{N-[6-(fluorescein-4′-carboxamido)-n-hexanoyl]-l-alanyl}paclitaxel) and 4-4-20 IgG (a monoclonal antibody against fluorescein) has been observed by means of sedimentation and electron microscopy methods. The kinetics of binding of the antibody to microtubule-bound Hexaflutax has been measured. The quenching of the observed fluorescence is fast (k+ 2.26 ± 0.25 × 106 m-1 s-1 at 37 °C), indicating that the fluorescein groups of Hexaflutax are exposed to the outer solvent. The velocity of the reaction is linearly dependent on the antibody concentration, indicating that a bimolecular reaction is being observed. Another fluorescent taxoid (Flutax-2) bound to microtubules has also been shown to be rapidly accessible to polyclonal antibodies directed against fluorescein. A reduced rate of Hexaflutax quenching by the antibody is observed in microtubule-associated proteins containing microtubules or in native cellular cytoskeletons. It can be concluded that the fluorescent taxoids bind to an outer site on the microtubules that is shared with paclitaxel. Paclitaxel would be internalized in a further step of binding to reach the known luminal site, this step being blocked in the case of the fluorescent taxoids. Because the fluorescent ligands are able to induce microtubule assembly, binding to the outer site should be enough to induce assembly by a preferential binding mechanism.

These compounds, called microtubule-stabilizing agents, bind to microtubules, stabilize them, and block their dynamics, thus disrupting cell division. Subsequently, because they block cell division they are useful as antitumor drugs. Paclitaxel and its derivatives are the main choices for the chemotherapy of ovarian cancer, metastatic breast cancer, head and neck cancer, and lung cancer (7Choy H. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2001; 37: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).The location of the paclitaxel binding site of microtubules has been the object of research for a decade. Early low resolution microtubule models placed the paclitaxel binding site in between the protofilaments of microtubules (8Andreu J.M. Bordas J. García de Díaz J.F. Ancos J. Gil R. Medrano F.J. Nogales E. Pantos E. Towns-Andrews E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 169-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). A compatible location was observed in the projection difference map of zincinduced tubulin sheets at 6.5 Å resolution (9Nogales E. Wolf S.G. Khan I.A. Luduen̈a R.F. Downing K.H. Nature. 1995; 375: 424-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). This location of the binding site would have been compatible with the currently established facts that taxoids are able to access their binding site very rapidly (10Evangelio J.A. Abal M.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10067-10077Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) (which suggests that the interprotofilament contact might be necessary for the existence of the binding site).The quest for the location of the binding site got a first answer from the atomic structure of tubulin. Tubulin had been an elusive protein for high resolution structural studies; its inhomogeneity and instability precluded the determination of its three-dimensional structure until the late nineties. In the brilliant study of Nogales et al. (14Nogales E. Wolf S.G. Downing K. Nature. 1998; 391: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar), the structure of tubulin was solved by electron crystallography of paclitaxel-stabilized zinc-induced tubulin sheets, a polymer of tubulin whose topology is different from that of microtubules (15Larsson H. Wallin M. Edstrom A. Exp. Cell Res. 1976; 100: 104-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Although both microtubules and zinc sheets are composed of protofilaments that consist of tubulin dimers aligned head to tail, in the case of microtubules, protofilaments associate laterally and close to give a cylinder whose number of protofilaments ranges from 11 to 16 (8Andreu J.M. Bordas J. García de Díaz J.F. Ancos J. Gil R. Medrano F.J. Nogales E. Pantos E. Towns-Andrews E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 169-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 16Mandelkow E.M.

Biol. 1990; 212: 775-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In the case of the zinc-induced sheets, protofilaments associate in an anti-parallel way, resulting in a flat sheet that is suitable for two-dimensional electron crystallography (9Nogales E. Wolf S.G. Khan I.A. Luduen̈a R.F. Downing K.H. Nature. 1995; 375: 424-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar).The protofilament structure directly determined from the zinc-induced sheets was fitted into electron microscopy density maps of microtubules (18Sosa H.

The constructed models are supported by the 8 Å three-dimensional reconstruction of microtubules from cryoelectron microscopy (22Li H. DeRosier D.J. Nicholson W.V. Nogales E. Downing K.H. Structure (Lond.). 2002; 10: 1317-1328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Because the zinc-induced sheets employed included paclitaxel as stabilizer, the location of the paclitaxel binding in the microtubules was thus known. Surprisingly, the translation of the zinc sheet protofilaments into microtubules results in a paclitaxel binding site inside the lumen of the tube, hidden from the outer solvent (20Nogales E. Whittaker M. Milligan R.A. Downing K.H. Cell. 1999; 96: 79-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar).The kinetics of binding of several taxoids (including paclitaxel) to their site in the microtubules was subsequently determined (11Díaz J.F.

Because a binding site hidden in the microtubule lumen should severely restrict accessibility of the ligands to their target, these results were apparently contradictory with the observed location of the binding site. These kinetic constants are incompatible with any kind of passive diffusion through a pore on the microtubule surface as big as 25 Å diameter (12Díaz J.F. Barasoain I. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8407-8419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The binding reaction of taxoids to microtubules is diffusion-controlled, indicating that the observed binding step is not restricted, and so it corresponds to the binding of the ligand to an exposed site. Because binding is slowed down by a factor of 10 by the presence of MAPs that bind to the microtubule outer surface, the kinetic evidence points to a primary binding site accessible on the microtubule surface.To reconcile the kinetic data with the structural and biochemical evidence of a paclitaxel binding site placed in the microtubule lumen (20Nogales E.

Barasoain I. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8407-8419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In this model, taxoids would bind to a putative binding site located in one of the two different types of pores existent in the B-lattice of the microtubules (pore type I, closer to the site in the lumen), being later transported to the luminal site. In this hypothetical mechanism, binding to the external and luminal sites should be mutually exclusive because only 1.0 taxoid molecules bind/tubulin dimer. This could be accomplished if both sites share an element that switches between the two alternative binding sites.The purpose of this study is to obtain direct evidence of the existence of an external taxoid binding site. To do so, the accessibility of microtubule-bound taxoids to a large macromolecule (an antibody) has been probed, employing fluorescein derivatives of paclitaxel (Flutax-1, Flutax-2, and Hexaflutax) and polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against the fluorescein moiety. Because it is impossible for a large molecule like an antibody to fit through any realistic pore in the microtubule wall, taxoid molecules bound to the luminal site of the microtubules will be protected from antibodies. Taxoid molecules bound to a site on the surface would react with the antibody, so providing evidence of an exposed taxoid binding site.In this study, the existence of a specific ternary complex of microtubules, Hexaflutax, and 4-4-20 (a monoclonal antibody against fluorescein) has been observed by means of sedimentation and electron microscopy, providing direct evidence of the existence of an external binding site for the ligand. Further kinetic evidence is given by the kinetics of binding of the antibody to microtubule-bound Hexaflutax, which is fast, indicating that the fluorescein groups of the ligand are homogeneously exposed to the outer solvent. From these results it can be concluded that these fluorescent taxoids bind to an outer site on the microtubules which is shared with paclitaxel.MATERIALS AND METHODSTubulin, Taxoids, and Antibodies—Purified calf brain tubulin and chemicals were as described previously (29Díaz J.F.

The samples were immediately centrifuged for 20 min at 50,000 rpm in a TLA 100 rotor, employing a Beckman Optima TLX ultracen-trifuge. The supernatants were taken and the pellets carefully resuspended in 10 mm sodium phosphate, 1% SDS, pH 7.0, buffer. An aliquot of supernatants and pellets was diluted 1/5 in 10 mm sodium phosphate, 1% SDS, pH 7.0, buffer and incubated for 15 min at 80 °C to dissociate the antibody-fluorescein complex. The fluorescence of the samples was measured in a Shimadzu RF-540 spectrofluorometer employing λexc 495, λems 520 nm, 5 nm excitation and emission slits, to quantify the amount of ligand in supernatant and pellets. The supernatants and pellets were also diluted 1/2 in electrophoresis sample buffer, and the presence of antibodies in them was assayed with a nonreducing SDS-PAGE in 7.5% acrylamide gel.Electron Microscopy of the Ternary Complex—A mixture of 4 μm sites in cross-linked microtubules, 2 μm Hexaflutax, and 2 μm 4-4-20 antibody was adsorbed for 1 min to a copper grid covered with formvar and carbon. The grids were blotted and then incubated over a drop of GAM-10, a nanogold-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (British Biocell International, Cardiff, UK), for 5 min. The grids were then washed with 5 drops of GAB and stained for 2 min with 2% uranyl acetate in water. The grids were observed in a JEOL JEM-1200-EXII microscope.Fluorescence Spectroscopy and Anisotropy Measurements—Corrected fluorescence spectra were acquired with a photon counting Fluorolog-3–221 instrument (Jobin Yvon-Spex, Longiumeau, France), employing 1 nm excitation and 5 nm emission bandwidths, at 25 °C. Fluorometric concentration measurements were made with a Shimadzu RF-540 spectrofluorometer. Anisotropy values were collected in the Fluorolog T-format mode with vertically polarized excitation and corrected for the sensitivity of each channel with horizontally polarized excitation (38Lackowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic, New York1999: 291-318Crossref Google Scholar).Binding of Taxoids to Microtubules—Binding constants of Hexaflutax to microtubules were obtained using anisotropy titration measurements. 200 nm Hexaflutax in GAB was incubated for 30 min with increasing concentrations of binding sites in stabilized cross-linked microtubules (from 0 to 10 μm) at the desired temperature, and the anisotropy of the solution was measured in a POLARSTAR BMG plate reader in the polarization mode, employing the 480-P excitation filter and the 520-P emission filters (38Lackowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic, New York1999: 291-318Crossref Google Scholar). Alternatively, the binding constants of Hexaflutax and the 4-4-20-Hexaflutax complex were measured using a centrifugation assay. Samples of 1 μm taxoid binding sites in cross-linked microtubules were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C with different concentrations of Hexaflutax in the presence and absence of antibody. The samples were centrifuged for 20 min at 50,000 rpm in a TL100 rotor employing a Beckman TLX ultracentrifuge. The pellets and supernatants were diluted 1/5 in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1% SDS and warmed up at 95 °C for 3 min to dissociate the Hexaflutax-antibody complex and their fluorescence measured employing a Shimadzu RF-540 spectrofluorometer (excitation wavelength 495 nm, emission wavelength 527 nm, 5 nm excitation and emission slits). The concentration of ligand in the samples was calculated using Hexaflutax spectrophotometric concentration standards.Kinetics of Binding of Antibodies to Microtubules—The fast kinetics of binding of the 4-4-20 antibody to Hexaflutax bound to stabilized microtubules or free in solution was measured by the change of intensity of fluorescence using a Bio-Logic SF300S stopped flow device equipped with a fluorescence detection system with an excitation wavelength of 484 nm and a filter with a cutoff of 520 nm in the emission pathway. The fast kinetics of binding of the anti-fluorescein polyclonal IgG to Flutax-1, Flutax-2 bound to stabilized microtubules, was measured by the change of intensity of fluorescence using a High-Tech Scientific SS-51 stopped flow device equipped with a fluorescence detection system using an excitation wavelength of 492 nm and a filter with a cutoff of 530 nm in the emission pathway. The slow kinetics of binding of 4-4-20 antibody to Hexaflutax bound to MAPs containing microtubules was measured with a photon counting instrument Fluorolog-3-221 (Jobin Yvon-Spex, Longiumeau, France) with an excitation wavelength of 495 nm (0.1 nm band pass to prevent photolysis) and an emission wavelength 525 nm (5 nm band pass). The fitting of the kinetic curves was done with a nonlinear least squares fitting program based on the Marquardt algorithm (39Bevington P.R. Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1969: 235-240Google Scholar); additionally the FITSIM package (40Barshop B.A. Wrenn R.F. Frieden C. Anal.

Whether the signaling pathways of these cytokines are regulated differently in various cell types and cellular conditions induced by exposure to different agents are important questions that need to be answered to better understand the mechanism of the inflammatory process. Both of these cytokines activate the IκB kinase complex (IKK)/NF-κB and JNK/AP-1 pathways, but TNFα also activates a cell death program (1Varfolomeev E.E. Ashkenazi A. Cell. 2004; 116: 491-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 2Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3412) Google Scholar). NF-κB is a key transcription factor required for activation of several genes involved in inflammation, innate and adaptive immunity, suppression of apoptosis, differentiation, and proliferation (3Coussens L.M. Werb Z. Nature. 2002; 420: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (10932) Google Scholar, 4Rayet B. Gelinas C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6938-6947Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Regulation of NF-κB activation is controlled primarily by the IKK, which is activated by many different stimuli including cytokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS), growth factors, bacteria, and viruses although the exact mechanisms are unknown (5Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3273) Google Scholar, 6DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1896) Google Scholar). Some of these stimuli when applied together have synergistic or opposing effects on the IKK/NF-κB pathway. For example, in some cells H2O2 potentiates TNF-induced IKK/NF-κB activation, whereas in other cells H2O2 inhibits TNF-induced IKK/NF-κB activation (7Pantano C. Shrivastava P. McElhinney B.

Such cross-talk has physiological relevance during inflammatory responses. Indeed, macrophages exposed to oxidizing conditions have been shown to shift CD4 helper T cell responses from Th1 to Th2, a condition commonly associated with poorer prognosis and disease persistence (10Murata Y. Shimamura T. Hamuro J. Int. Immunol. 2002; 14: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar).IKK consists of two catalytic subunits, IKKα and IKKβ, and a regulatory subunit, IKKγ (11Zandi E.

Nature. 1998; 395: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). NF-κB in its inactive state is usually bound by its inhibitor IκB (α, β, or ϵ) in the cytoplasm. Activated IKK phosphorylates two serine residues on the N terminus of IκBα, targeting it for ubiquitylation and degradation by the 26 S proteasome (6DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1896) Google Scholar). NF-κB is then free to enter the nucleus and regulate transcription of target genes. IKK/NF-κB is a well known redox-sensitive pathway being both positively and negatively regulated by ROS (7Pantano C. Shrivastava P. McElhinney B. Janssen-Heininger Y. J. Biol.

For example it has been reported that H2O2 treatment of cells caused oxidation of a critical cysteine residue within the kinase domain of IKK, inhibiting TNF-induced NF-κB activation (8Korn S.H. Wouters E.F. Vos N. Janssen-Heininger Y.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35693-35700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Other reports have suggested that H2O2 specifically affects IKK signaling through the TNFR1 pathway by causing degradation of Hsp90 and RIP proteins, thus terminating the TNF-induced IKK signal (7Pantano C.

In contrast, it has also been reported that treatment of cells with free radical scavengers or ectopic expression of oxygen radical scavenging enzymes reduced TNF-induced IKK activation, thus suggesting ROS as second messengers for cytokine-induced signaling for the IKK/NF-κB pathway (15Schreck R.

Iron has been suggested to play a role in production of ROS because many ROS-producing enzymes contain heme, and free iron can also participate in Fenton reactions (19Neyens E. Baeyens J. J. Hazard.

Several human diseases have been associated with aberrant iron metabolism including thalassemia, anemia, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and Alzheimer's disease (20Hentze M.W. Muckenthaler M.U.

Regulation of iron metabolism both systemically and in the microenvironment can potentially influence inflammatory responses, and iron has been suggested to play a role in activation of IKK and NF-κB in hepatic macrophages (23Xiong S.

Hoffbrand A.V. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It is commonly used as a cell synchronization agent because it inhibits mammalian DNA replication, arresting cells in the late G1 or early S phase of the cell cycle (25Lalande M. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 186: 332-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In addition, l-mimosine was suggested to induce DNA breaks by chelating iron and thus increasing production of ROS (26Mikhailov I. Russev G. Anachkova B. Mutat. Res. 2000; 459: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).In this study we demonstrate that l-mimosine treatment of cells results in production of H2O2, which selectively inhibits TNF-but not IL-1-induced IKK activation in a cell type-specific manner. The data show a molecular basis for a cell type-specific cross-talk between TNF and H2O2 regulation. Our data may also explain the anti-inflammatory effect of l-mimosine observed in vivo.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Lines, Culture, and Reagents—Wild type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), MEF UCLA, C14 (27Rosen V.

Jurkat, HL-60, Nalm6, U937, and Colo201 cells were grown in RPMI, 10% fetal bovine serum with antibiotics and maintained as mentioned for MEF. For experiments with adherent cells 0.5 × 106 to 1.0 × 106 cells were seeded into each well of a 6-well plate and incubated with or without l-mimosine (300 μm) for 12-16 h. Following l-mimosine pretreatment cells were washed once with growth medium containing 0.1% serum and then stimulated with medium containing mouse or human TNFα (10 ng/ml) or mouse IL-1β (5 ng/ml). After stimulation the medium was removed, cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in ice-cold buffer C, pH 7.6, containing the following: 1% Triton X-100, 300 mm NaCl, 40 mm Tris, 40 mm NaF, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm metabisulfite, 10 mm benzamidine, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 20% glycerol, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 8.5 μg/ml bestatin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 13 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. Suspension cultures were grown to a density of 0.5 × 106 cells/ml to 1.0 × 106 and incubated with or without l-mimosine (300 μm) for 12-16 h. After l-mimosine pretreatment, cells were pelleted and re-suspended in medium containing 0.1% serum at a density of 2.0 × 106 cells/ml and stimulated with TNFα (10 ng/ml). The cells were then pelleted and lysed with buffer C. For experiments using N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), cells were grown in RPMI 10% fetal bovine serum with 100 mm Tris, pH 7.6.l-Mimosine, NAC, and aphidicolin were purchased from Sigma. The adenoviral vectors Ad.Cat and Ad.GPx-1 were described previously (28Brown M.R. Miller Jr., F.J. Li W.G. Ellingson A.N. Mozena J.D. Chatterjee P. Engelhardt J.F. Zwacka R.M. Oberley L.W. Fang X.

Signal. 2001; 3: 415-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 105 MEF were seeded in 6-well plates on day 0. On day 1, cells were infected with Ad.GFP, Ad.Cat, or Ad.GPx-1 at a multiplicity of infection of 40 or 100 particles/cell in 1 ml of complete growth medium and incubated for 1.5 h at 37 °C. After incubation, 1 ml of complete growth medium was added. Twenty-four h after infection, the medium was removed and l-mimosine (300 μm) was added. Cells were incubated for 16 h in the presence of l-mimosine and then stimulated with TNFα as mentioned above.In Vitro Kinase Assay—Cell lysates (100 μg) were immunoprecipitated with anti-IKKγ antibody (for IKK kinase activity) or anti-JNK1 (for JNK kinase activity) and protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) in lysis buffer. The precipitates were washed once with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer containing 20 mm Tris and 20 mm MgCl2, pH 7.6. The precipitates were then incubated with kinase mixture containing 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm ATP, 0.1 μCi [32P]ATP, and 1 μg GST-IκBα-(1-54) (for IKK activity) or GST-c-Jun-(1-79) (for JNK activity) for 20 min at 30 °C. The kinase reaction was quenched with Laemmli buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and detected by autoradiography.Western Blot—Cell lysate (30 μg) was loaded and resolved by SDSPAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed with the indicated antiserum. IKKβ antibody (1:20 dilution) was derived from a C-terminal fragment of recombinant IKKβ (Abgent, San Diego, CA). IKKα antibodies (1:500 dilution) were purchased from Imgenex (San Diego, CA) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). IKKγ antibodies were purchased from Abgent and Santa Cruz Biotechnology. JNK1 was purchased from BD Biosciences. p38 (1:1000 dilution) and phospho-p38 (1:1000 dilution) antibodies were kind gifts from A. Lee (University of Southern California). TRAF2 (1:1000 dilution), RIP (1:1000 dilution), and Hsp90 (1:1000 dilution) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Whole cell lysate (4 μg) was incubated with 32P-labeled NF-κB oligo in gel shift mixture containing 4% Ficoll-400, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), and 25 μg/ml calf thymus DNA. The complexes were resolved on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel and revealed by autoradiography.Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (FACS)—For cell cycle analyses, 1 × 106 cells were incubated in the presence or absence of l-mimosine (300 μm) for 16 h (unless otherwise noted), trypsinized, and stained using standard propidium iodide methods. For apoptosis assays, 1 × 106 cells were grown in the presence or absence of l-mimosine (300 μm) for 16 h in normal growth medium. Following l-mimosine treatment, the medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium containing l-mimosine (300 μm) and TNFα (20 ng/ml) and incubated for 12 or 24 h. Cells were harvested by scraping and then counted, and apoptosis was determined using the ApoAlert Annexin V staining kit (BD Biosciences) using the manufacturer's specifications.H2O2 Detection—H2O2 production was detected using the Amplex Red assay kit (Molecular Probes) with modifications. MEF or HeLa cells were seeded at density of 5 × 104 cells/well in 96-well plates. The following day the medium was removed, and the cells were washed once with Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer (KRPG) (30Mohanty J.G. Jaffe J.S. Schulman E.S. Raible D.G. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 202: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). KRPG containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum (KRPG 0.1%) with or without l-mimosine (300 μm) was added back to the cells in a total volume of 50 μl. Cells were incubated for 8 h, and then 50 μl of KRPG 0.1% containing 100 μm Amplex Red reagent and 0.2 units/ml horseradish peroxide (reaction buffer) was added to each well. For cells treated with l-mimosine, the reaction buffer contained 300 μm l-mimosine. HL-60 cells were centrifuged and washed once with KRPG prior to seeding in 96-well plates. The cells were incubated for 8 h in the presence or absence of l-mimosine (300 μm) prior to the addition of reaction buffer as mentioned for MEF and HeLa cells. Absorbance at 560 nm was measured at 5 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 5 h, and 6 h after the addition of reaction buffer using an Emax precision microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA.). The concentration of H2O2 produced by the cells was determined by obtaining the OD at 560 nm and comparing to a standard curve.RESULTSTreatment of MEFs with l-Mimosine Prevents Activation of IKK by TNFα but Does Not Prevent IKK Activation by IL-1β—In a series of experiments originally designed to investigate the regulation of IKK by TNFα at different stages of the cell cycle, we observed that pretreatment of a MEF line with l-mimosine for 12-16 h strongly reduced activation of the IKK complex by TNFα as indicated by the reduction of kinase activity (Fig. 1A) (31Li Q. Van Antwerp D. Mercurio F. Lee K.F. Verma I.M. Science. 1999; 284: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). The levels of IKK proteins in MEFs were not changed by l-mimosine treatment (Fig. 1A), indicating that the reduction of IKK activation was caused by a block in TNFα signal. Inhibition of IKK activation indeed resulted in much reduced NF-κB DNA binding activity as shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. 1C).IL-1β activates IKK and NF-κB to a very similar extent with similar kinetics as TNFα (31Li Q. Van Antwerp D. Mercurio F. Lee K.F. Verma I.M. Science. 1999; 284: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). To examine whether the inhibitory effect of l-mimosine on IKK activation is specific to the TNF pathway, we determined activation of IKK and NF-κB by IL-1β in the presence of l-mimosine. l-Mimosine did not inhibit IL-1β-induced activation of IKK or NF-κB (Fig. 1, B and C). Thus l-mimosine specifically inhibits the flow of signal from TNF to IKK but not the flow of signal from IL-1β to IKK. These data also indicated that the IKK complex retains the capacity to be activated in l-mimosine-treated cells. To further examine this point, we tested whether l-mimosine would inhibit IKK activity in vitro. We immunoprecipitated the IKK complex from TNFα-treated MEF and measured its kinase activity in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of l-mimosine. We used a small molecule IKK inhibitor (PS1145) as a control for IKK inhibition (32Hideshima T. Chauhan D. Richardson P. Mitsiades C. Mitsiades N. Hayashi T. Munshi N. Dang L. Castro A. Palombella V. Adams J. Anderson K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16639-16647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). l-Mimosine did not inhibit IKK activity in vitro with concentrations as high as 900 μm, whereas PS1145 did (Fig. 1D). Thus, l-mimosine does not directly target the IKK complex.G1-S Cell Cycle Arrest Induced by l-Mimosine Is Not Required to Prevent TNFα-induced IKK Activation—To examine whether the time course of cell cycle arrest caused by l-mimosine was concomitant with inhibition of TNF-induced IKK activation, we determined the time required for the inhibitory effect of l-mimosine. After 6 h of l-mimosine treatment, ∼70% of cells were arrested at G1-S phase. The percentage of G1-S arrested cells increased to ∼83% 12 h after treatment (Fig. 2A). At 12 h after l-mimosine treatment, IKK was inhibited to the basal level (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Inhibition of IKK activation coincides with cell cycle inhibition at late G1-early S phase. A, MEFs were cultured in the presence or absence of l-mimosine (300 μm) for 1, 2, 3, 6, or 12 h and then harvested for FACS analysis. B, MEFs were pretreated or not with l-mimosine (300 μm) for 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 6 h, and 12 h and then stimulated with TNFα (10 ng/ml) for the indicated times and lysed. IKK activity was assessed by KA (top panel) using antibody to IKKγ and GST-IκBα as a substrate. The immunoblots (IB) were performed using antibodies to IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ (bottom three panels).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To test whether cell cycle arrest was sufficient for inhibition of TNF-induced IKK activation, we arrested MEFs at G1-S with another cell cycle inhibitor, aphidicolin, which inhibits DNA polymerase α and δ (33O'Dwyer P.J. Moyer J.D. Suffness M. Harrison Jr., S.D. Cysyk R. Hamilton T.C. Plowman J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 724-729PubMed Google Scholar). l-Mimosine and aphidicolin both arrested these cells at G1-S to a similar degree (Fig. 3A). IKK activation by TNFα was reduced significantly in l-mimosine-treated cells, whereas in aphidicolin-treated cells it was unaffected. This indicated that cell cycle arrest at G1-S phase does not inhibit TNF-induced IKK activation. To further examine this point, we determined IKK activation by TNFα in primary Kupfer cells isolated from rat livers. Kupfer cells are non-dividing macrophages arrested in the G0-G1 stage of the cell cycle. TNFα activated IKK in Kupfer cells (Fig. 3B). In these cells, l-mimosine pretreatment also resulted in IKK inhibition when stimulated with TNFα (Fig. 3B). Thus cell cycle arrest at the G1-S transition is not sufficient to prevent IKK activation by TNFα. Data in Fig. 3B indicate that l-mimosine inhibition of TNF-induced IKK activation is not limited to cultured cell lines and that it also occurs in primary cells.Fig. 3Cell cycle arrest is not sufficient to inhibit IKK activation by TNFα. A, MEFs were cultured in the presence or absence (NT) of l-mimosine (300 μm) or aphidicolin (1 μg/ml) for 16 h and then stimulated for the indicated times with TNFα (10 ng/ml) and lysed or harvested for FACS analysis (top panel). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with IKKγ antibody and used for KA (middle panel) using GST-IκBα as a substrate. Immunoblots (IB) were performed with IKKβ antibody (bottom panel). B, freshly isolated Kupfer cells were cultured for 16 h in the presence or absence of l-mimosine (300 μm) and then stimulated with TNFα (10 ng/ml) and lysed or harvested for FACS analysis (top panel). Cell lysates were used for in vitro kinase assay (middle panel) and immunoblots (bottom panel) as in A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)l-Mimosine Inhibits TNF-induced IKK Activation in a Cell Type-specific Manner—As shown above, l-mimosine inhibits TNF-induced IKK activation in an established cell line (MEF) and primary cells (Kupfer cells). We further examined whether l-mimosine prevents TNFα-induced IKK activation in other cell types such as fibroblasts (e.g. NIH3T3), epithelia (HeLa), pre-B-cells (Nalm6), T cells (Jurkat), and macrophages (RAW264.7, HL-60). With the exception of MEFs that are derived at or before embryonic day 13.5 of mouse embryonic development stage, TNF-induced IKK activation was reduced by l-mimosine only in macrophages and T cells (Fig. 4A). In contrast, all of the other cells tested regardless of their origin (human or mouse) or type (fibroblast, epithelial, and B cells) showed normal IKK activation in response to TNFα in the presence of l-mimosine (Fig. 4B). A summary of the cells tested, their origin, and the -fold inhibition of IKK by l-mimosine is shown in Table I. C14 cells are derived from embryonic day 13 embryos and represent clone 14 of a chondroblast- and osteoclast-like cell (27Rosen V. Nove J. Song J.J. Thies R.S. Cox K. Wozney J.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 1759-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). It is unclear why IKK in MEFs that were generated from mouse embryos younger than embryonic day 13.5 are sensitive to l-mimosine but not in MEFs generated at later stages of embryonic development (e.g. 10T1/2, and NIH3T3 MEFs shown in Fig. 4B). Interestingly, l-mimosine treatment of HL-60 cells caused increased basal level IKK activation (Fig. 4A), but TNF-induced IKK activation was completely suppressed.Fig. 4Inhibition of IKK is cell type-specific. Various cell types were cultured in the presence or absence (Control) of l-mimosine (300 μm) for 16 h and then stimulated with TNFα (10 ng/ml) for the indicated times and lysed. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-IKKγ antibody and used for in vitro kinase assay using GST-IκBα as a substrate. Cell lines that were sensitive to l-mimosine treatment are in A, and those that were insensitive are in B.

Representative cell cycle profiles for MEF, HeLa, and RAW264.7 are shown in Fig. 4C. Clearly, l-mimosine arrested HeLa and RAW cells to a very similar degree, but IKK activation by TNFα was inhibited only in RAW and MEF cells. This indicates that inhibition of TNF-induced IKK activation by l-mimosine is not caused by an inability of l-mimosine to permeate certain cell types. These data further indicate that cell cycle arrest induced by l-mimosine is not required for its inhibitory effect on IKK and that the TNF/IKK signaling pathway of macrophages and T cells may be regulated differently than other cell types.l-Mimosine Specifically Inhibits TNFα-induced IKK but Not JNK, p38, or Cell Death Pathways Downstream of TNF— In addition to IKK, TNFα activates JNK and p38 stress-activated kinases leading to activation of transcription factors and thus changes in gene transcription (34Derijard B.

To elucidate the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms operating on the developmentally regulated expression of Dp71, we analyzed the Dp71 expression and promoter activity during myogenesis of the C2C12 cells. We demonstrated that the cellular content of Dp71 transcript and protein decrease in myotubes as a consequence of the negative regulation that the differentiation stimulus exerts on the Dp71 promoter. Promoter deletion analysis showed that the 224-bp 5′-flanking region, which contains several Sp-binding sites (Sp-A to Sp-D), is responsible for the Dp71 promoter basal activity in myoblasts as well as for down-regulation of the promoter in differentiated cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors specifically bind to the Sp-binding sites in the minimal Dp71 promoter region. Site-directed mutagenesis assay revealed that Sp-A is the most important binding site for the proximal Dp71 promoter activity. Additionally, cotransfection of the promoter construct with Sp1- and Sp3-expressing vectors into Drosophila SL2 cells, which lack endogenous Sp family, confirmed that these proteins activate specifically the minimal Dp71 promoter. Endogenous Sp1 and Sp3 proteins were detected only in myoblasts and not in myotubes, which indicates that the lack of these factors causes down-regulation of the Dp71 promoter activity in differentiated cells. In corroboration, efficient promoter activity was restored in differentiated muscle cells by exogenous expression of Sp1 and Sp3.

Kunkel L.M. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Dystrophin is a 427-kDa protein consisting of four major domains as follows: an N-terminal actin-binding domain, a central spectrin-like rod domain consisting of 24 triple helix structures, a cysteine-rich domain, and a unique C-terminal domain (2Koenig M. Monaco A.P. Kunkel L.M. Cell. 1988; 53: 219-226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle, dystrophin is associated with a group of sarcolemmal proteins and glycoproteins known collectively as the dystrophin-associated proteins (DAP) (3Ozawa E. Yoshida M. Suzuki A. Mizuno Y. Hagiwara Y. Noguchi S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 1711-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). One of the proposed functions of dystrophin is to provide a structural link between the actin-based cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix (4Mehler M.F. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2000; 32: 277-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The DMD gene exhibits a complex transcriptional regulation due to the presence of at least seven independent promoters that generate three full-length dystrophins (Dp427) and N-terminally truncated gene products (Dp260, Dp140, Dp116, and Dp71) (5Barnea E.

J. 1990; 272: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 13Hugnot J.P. Gilgenkrantz H. Vincent N. Chafey P. Morris G.E. Monaco A.P. Berwald-Netter Y. Koulakoff A. Kaplan J.C. Kahn A.

Dp71 is expressed in all tissues tested so far, except for skeletal muscle, where its expression is exclusively confined to myoblasts (15Lambert M. Chafey P. Hugnot J.P. Koulakoff A.

Grootscholten P.M. Van Ommen G.J. Fuchs O. Nudel U. Yaffe D. Differentiation. 1992; 49: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Conversely, Dp427 is not expressed until after the cells begin myogenic differentiation and is the major isoform expressed in mature fibers (18Lev A.A. Feener C.C. Kunkel L.M. Brown Jr., R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15817-15820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Nudel U. Robzyk K. Yaffe D. Nature. 1988; 331: 635-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Based on obvious structural differences between Dp71 and Dp427, it is unlikely that these proteins are functionally interchangeable. In fact, ectopic expression of Dp71 in skeletal muscle of mdx mice, which lack dystrophin, restored the normal levels of DAP but did not alleviate muscle damage (20Greenberg D.S. Sunada Y. Campbell K.P. Yaffe D. Nudel U. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 21Cox G.A. Sunada Y. Campbell K.P. Chamberlain J.S. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and more surprisingly, ectopic expression of Dp71 in skeletal muscle of transgenic wild-type mice results in muscle damage, similar to that observed in mdx mice (22Leibovitz S. Meshorer A. Fridman Y. Wieneke S. Jockusch H. Yaffe D. Nudel U. Neuromuscul. Disord. 2002; 12: 836-844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The performance of stage-specific tasks by Dp427 and Dp71 in muscle cells indicates that their expression is tightly controlled (23Howard P.L. Dally G.Y. Ditta S.D. Austin R.C. Worton R.G. Klamut H.J. Ray P.N. Muscle Nerve. 1999; 22: 16-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The transcriptional regulation of Dp427 in muscle cells has been well established. It is known that high levels of YY1 protein down-regulate the Dp427 promoter in undifferentiated muscle cells, but upon the induction of muscular differentiation, YY1 protein levels are negatively controlled by the action of the protease m-calpain, allowing the dystrophin promoter bending factor to regulate positively the promoter activity (24Galvagni F. Cartocci E. Oliviero S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33708-33713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In contrast, regulation of Dp71 during myogenesis remains to be approached, and the Dp71 promoter region, which exhibits the structure of a typical housekeeping promoter, has been only partially characterized (11Lederfein D. Yaffe D. Nudel U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 1883-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this study, we analyzed the expression of Dp71 and characterized the activity of its promoter region during muscle cell differentiation of the C2C12 cells, a sub-culture derived from the C2 cell line. Deletion analysis showed that the major Dp71 promoter activity in proliferating myoblasts depends on the proximal 224-bp promoter region, which contains several Sp-binding sites. Altogether, gel shift, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and site-directed mutagenesis assays, as well as transient transfection experiments in Drosophila SL2 cells, established that Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors interact with the Sp-binding sites and transactivate the Dp71 promoter. In differentiating muscle cells, the Dp71 promoter activity is down-regulated; the 224-bp proximal promoter region seems to be sufficient to exert such control, and a concomitant reduction in the endogenous Sp1 and Sp3 protein levels was observed. Restoration of significant promoter activity in differentiating cells was obtained after exogenous expression of Sp1 or Sp3 proteins. Our results indicate that the developmentally regulated expression of Dp71 in muscle cells during differentiation is based on the differential expression of Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors. Cell Cultures—C2C12 cells (ATCC CRL-1772), a sub-culture derived from C2 cell line (25Yaffe D. Saxel O. Nature. 1977; 270: 725-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar), were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 4.5 g of glucose/liter, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mm l-glutamine (proliferation medium), and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with a 5% CO2 atmosphere. In some experiments, subconfluent C2C12 cells were induced to differentiate by lowering FBS to a final concentration of 1% (differentiation medium). Schneider's Drosophila Line 2 (SL2, ATCC CRL-1963) cells were cultured in Schneider's Drosophila Medium (Invitrogen) containing l-glutamine and were maintained at 25 °C without CO2. All culture media contained 100 units of penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Real Time RT-PCR—Dp71 transcript levels during C2C12 muscle cell differentiation were measured by quantitative real time RT-PCR using the comparative CT method described by Applied Biosystems. Total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) from C2C12 cells induced to differentiate for 0, 3, 6, or 9 days. 5 μg of the extracted total RNA was primed with random hexanucleotides and reversed-transcribed by the Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real time PCRs were set up in a reaction volume of 25 μl using the TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The probe and primers specific for Dp71 detection were designed using the Primer express software from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The Dp71 fluorogenic probe was 5′-(FAM™)-CCCCAAAGGACTCAAAGAACCT-(TAMRA™)-3′, and the Dp71 PCR primers were Dp71F 5′-TGTATTGCATTTAGAGCCCCAA-3′ and Dp71R 5′-CTTCCTCTGCGCTTAATTGC-3′ (Synthetic Genetics, San Diego, CA). As endogenous control, real time RT-PCR analysis of the eukaryotic 18 S ribosomal (r)RNA gene was performed in parallel. The r18 S fluorogenic probe, labeled with VIC™ dye-TAMRA™ dye, and PCR primers were purchased from Applied Biosystems. DNA amplifications were carried out in a 96-well reaction plate format in a PE Applied Biosystems 7700 Sequence Detector (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Both Dp71 and r18 S PCRs were carried out in triplicate. Multiple negative control water blanks were included in each analysis. Plasmid Constructs—Plasmids p1800CAT, p1500CAT, p900CAT, p700CAT, p1.8StuI-delCAT and pSV0CAT were described previously (11Lederfein D. Yaffe D. Nudel U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 1883-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). New truncated promoter versions were prepared on p1800CAT by restriction endonuclease digestion in the appropriate sites, followed by blunt end generation and ligation, to generate p1159CAT (NdeI and AccI enzymes), p939CAT (NdeI and StuI), p1.8Xba-delCAT (XbaI), p711CAT (NdeI and XbaI), p588CAT (NdeI and EcoRV), and p224CAT (NdeI and BstXI). The ligated products were transformed into competent DH5-α cells, and selected individual colonies were cultured overnight in 5 ml of LB + ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Plasmid DNA was isolated from these cultures to verify the joined sequences of the new constructs. Finally, plasmids were purified using the plasmid midi kit columns (Qiagen). Transient Cell Transfection—Each Dp71 promoter construct was introduced into C2C12 cells by means of the Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen), together with the pRSV-β-gal vector or with both the pRSV-β-gal and pPac, AP2γ/pcDNA3.1(+), pPacSp1, and/or PacSp3 expression plasmids according to the manufacturer's instructions. Defined amounts of each expression vector were incubated with 8 μl of plus reagent in 250 μl of Opti-MEM medium, mixed well, and added to an equal volume of Opti-MEM medium containing 12 μl of Lipofectamine reagent. The lipid/DNA mixture was mixed well, incubated for 15 min at room temperature, and added to cell cultures (previously washed with Opti-MEM medium) covered by 2 ml of Opti-MEM medium. After 48 h of incubation at 37 °C in a 5% CO2-humidified incubator, Opti-MEM medium was replaced with either proliferation or differentiation medium. For transfection of the SL2 cell line, freshly grown cells from 3- to 4-day-old cultures were plated at density of 2.5 × 106 cells/60-mm dish and the day after were transfected using Cellfectin reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each plate was transfected previously with defined amounts of pRSV-β-gal, each Dp71 promoter-CAT reporter plasmids, and pPacSp1 and/or pPacUSp3 expression plasmids. After transfection, C2C12 and SL2 cells were maintained in their respective growth medium for 48 h, and the CAT and β-galactosidase assays were performed. CAT and β-Galactosidase Assays—To prepare cell extracts for the CAT and β-galactosidase expression assays, cells were scraped into 1× phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged at 2600 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 150 μl of 0.25 m Tris and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and then subjected to six freeze-thaw cycles with dry ice. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 4 °C for 5 min at 3000 × g, and the resulting supernatant was removed and its protein content determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). These clarified extracts were used directly in enzymatic assays. β-Galactosidase activity was measured using 2.5 mmo-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) as substrate and 30 μl of cell extract in a reaction mixture consisting of 60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 2 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 1 m Na2CO3, and the absorbance of the reaction product was read at 405 nm. CAT activity was determined by using 20 μg of cell extract, 80 mm acetyl-CoA (Sigma), and 0.15 μCi of [14C]chloramphenicol (Amersham Biosciences) in a total volume of 180 μl. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 60 min, extracted with 800 μl ethyl acetate, and dried in a vacuum centrifugal evaporator. The dry reaction products were resuspended in 20 ml of ethyl acetate, and the acetylated and nonacetylated forms of [14C]chloramphenicol were separated by thin layer silica gel chromatography for 60 min at room temperature with chloroform/methanol (19:1, v/v) as mobile phase. Percentage conversion of chloramphenicol to its acetylated forms was determined using a radioactive image analyzer (AMBIS 4000). Isolation of Nuclear Extracts—Nuclear extracts were prepared from undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 cells, as described previously (26Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 400 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysates were incubated on ice for 15 min and then centrifuged for 3 min at 3,000 × g at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After that, cells were vigorously shaken at 4 °C for 15 min and pelleted by centrifuging for 5 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant was recovered as the nuclear extract, and its protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay. Nuclear extracts were stored at –70 °C until use. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Synthetic complementary deoxyoligonucleotides corresponding to the AP2 and Sp DNA elements of the Dp71 promoter were annealed and radioactively labeled by incubating 4 pmol of dephosphorylated double-stranded oligonucleotides, 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen), 5 μl of T4 polynucleotide kinase buffer, and 20 μCi of [γ-32P]dATP (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min at 37 °C and inactivated at 65 °C for 10 min. For the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), 10 μg of nuclear extract proteins from either undifferentiated or differentiated cells were mixed in the binding buffer (12 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 60 mm KCl, 10% glycerol), with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences) as nonspecific competitor and the appropriate double-stranded 32P-labeled oligonucleotides as follows: Sp-A, 5′-TCCCAGCCCCGCCCCGTCTGC-3′; Sp-BC, 5′-CTGTCCCGCCCGCCCGCCAG-3′; Sp-D, 5′-GAGCCTGGGCGGCGGGCGCTTGACT-3′; and AP2, 5′-GCCCGCCAGCCCGCCAGCCAG-3′. In competition experiments, a 100-fold molar excess of the appropriate unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides were incubated with nuclear extracts before the addition of 32P-labeled oligonucleotides. Competitor double-stranded oligonucleotides were as follows: consensus Sp1, 5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′; mutated Sp1, 5′-ATTCGATCGGTTCGTGGCGAGC-3′; consensus AP2, 5′-GATCGAACTGACCGCCCGCGGCCCGT-3′; mutated AP2, 5′-GATCGAACTGACCGCTTGCGGCCCGT-3′; consensus OCT1 5′-TGTCGAATGCAAATCACTAGAA-3′; mutated bases are underlined. For supershift analysis, 10 μg of anti-Sp1- or anti-Sp3-specific antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were incubated with nuclear extract proteins for 12 h at 4 °C after addition of the DNA probe. Protein-DNA complexes were fractionated by electrophoresis in nondenaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. Antibodies and Western Blot Analysis—Antibodies directed to Sp1, Sp3, and myogenin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The anti-Dp71 polyclonal antibody 2166 was a donation of Dr. D. J. Blake (27Loh N.Y. Newey S.E. Davies K.E. Blake D.J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2715-2724PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-actin monoclonal antibody was generously provided by Dr. J. M. Hernandez. C2C12 cells cultured in 35-mm culture dishes were scraped, lysed as described previously (28Acosta R. Montanez C. Fuentes-Mera L. Gonzalez E. Gomez P. Quintero-Mora L. Mornet D. Alvarez-Salas L.M. Cisneros B. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 296: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein samples were quantified by the Bradford assay and denatured at 100 °C for 5 min in a protein sample buffer containing 1% SDS and 1% dithiothreitol. One hundred μg of total protein extracts were loaded in each lane and subjected to 10% PAGE under denaturing conditions (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblotting. Immunoblots were probed with the corresponding primary antibodies and developed by using the ECL Western blotting analysis system (Amersham Biosciences). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—C2C12 cells (2 × 107) were treated with 1% formaldehyde to cross-link protein-DNA complexes. Immunoprecipitates of cross-linked complexes were prepared with anti-Sp1 and anti-Sp3 antibodies, treated with proteinase K for 2 h, and then incubated at 65 °C to eliminate cross-linking. DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. DNA samples were quantified by the picogreen assay (Molecular Probes) and then analyzed by PCR amplification of the Dp71 promoter sequence located between –127 and +78 with 30 cycles of PCR using the following of 32P-labeled oligonucleotides: Dp71 (upper), 5′-CTATCCAGGTTTCCCCAGGTC-3′, and Dp71 (lower), 5′-CGGAGGAGTAAGCTTGCCCAA-3′. Different cycle numbers were employed to ensure linearity of the amplification reaction. As negative control, a DMD gene region localized on the junction of the DMD gene intron 63 and exon 64 (from +41,508 to +41,646, relative to the Dp71 transcription start site, GenBank™ accession number AL645848) was amplified with the following 32P-labeled oligonucleotides: Dys 64/64 (upper), 5′-ATAATGTCAGGTTCTCCGCG-3′, and Dys 64/64 (lower), 5′-TCAAAAATCCCCAAGCCCCA-3′. As positive control, a DNA region of the human telomerase promoter, which contains several Sp-binding sites, was amplified as positive control with the following 32P-labeled oligonucleotides Tert (upper), 5′-AACACATCCAGCAACCACTGA-3′, and Tert (lower), 5′-AAGATGAGGAGGGAACGGAGG-3′. PCR products were analyzed by 6% PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Construction of Mutant Plasmids—A series of mutations was performed in the Dp71 proximal promoter region (p224CAT) by using the QuickChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and each of the following double-stranded oligonucleotides: mutSp-A, 5′-CCCTTCCCAGCCCTGCTCCGTCTGCACGC-3′; mutSp-B, 5′-CCCCTCCCTGTCCTGTCCGCCCGCCAGC-3′; mutSp-C, 5′-CCCCTCCCTGTCCCGCCTGTCCGCCAGC-3′; mutSp-D, 5′-GGCTGCGAGCCTGGGCTTCGTGCGCTTGAC-3′; and mutAP2, 5′-CCCGCCCGCCAGCCAACCAGGCAGCGGCGG-3′. The underlined letters indicate the mutated bases. Briefly, 50 ng of the p224CAT promoter plasmid was used in a PCR containing 5 μl of Pfu polymerase buffer, 2.5 units of Pfu turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene), 10 mm dNTPs, 125 ng of each oligonucleotide, and water was added to 50 μl. Following temperature cycling (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), DpnI treatment was performed to cleave parental DNA and to improve the efficiency of the mutant plasmid screening. The reaction was transferred into XL-1 Blue competent cells, and the transformation mixture was plated on LB ampicillin plates. The authenticity of the mutants was established by DNA sequencing. Data Analysis—All data are depicted as mean ± S.E. Differences between two groups were validated by Student's t test. Dp71 Expression Is Down-regulated during C2C12 Myogenesis—To evaluate the expression of Dp71 during C2C12 muscle cell differentiation, its mRNA and protein levels were determined. Dp71 mRNA expression was measured by real time RT-PCR using Dp71-specific primers, whereas Dp71 protein was assessed by Western blotting using the polyclonal antibody 2166, directed against its C-terminal domain. Myoblast cultures were induced to differentiate for 3, 6, and 9 days by lowering serum concentration, and cell-differentiated morphology was monitored by light microscopy analysis. As shown in Fig. 1A, Dp71 mRNA expression was detected in myoblasts but decreased to minimum levels in myotube cultures since day 3 of induced differentiation, at which point myotube formation became apparent under microscopy visualization (data not shown). Dp71 protein expression pattern during C2C12 myogenesis was similar to that of Dp71 transcript; it was immunodetected in undifferentiated cells but disappeared totally from differentiated cultures of 3, 6, and 9 days (Fig. 1B, upper panel). In contrast, C2C12 maintained in differentiation medium resulted in up-regulation of myogenin, a myogenic gene marker; this protein was undetectable in myoblast cells but appeared by day 3 and remained steady throughout the rest of the differentiation treatment (Fig. 1B, lower panel), in agreement with previous reports (29Lopez-Casillas F. Riquelme C. Perez-Kato Y. Ponce-Castaneda M.V. Osses N. Esparza-Lopez J. Gonzalez-Nunez G. Cabello-Verrugio C. Mendoza V. Troncoso V. Brandan E. J. Biol.

Ezaki O. Hashimoto S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, the concomitant decreases of Dp71 mRNA and protein levels were negatively correlated with the differentiation process of C2C12 cells and evaluated by the acquisition of a differentiated morphology and induction of myogenin expression. Furthermore, these results indicated that the reduction of Dp71 expression during skeletal muscle differentiation was regulated, at least in part, at a transcriptional level. Dp71 Promoter Activity during Muscle Cell Differentiation—To characterize the mechanisms controlling the negative transcriptional regulation of Dp71 that occurred during myogenic differentiation, C2C12 myoblasts were transiently cotransfected with pRSV-β-gal and p1.8CAT vectors; the latter contains 1.8 kb from the mouse Dp71 promoter region fused to the reporter gene CAT (11Lederfein D. Yaffe D. Nudel U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 1883-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Myoblast cultures were induced to differentiate for 2 days, and the Dp71 promoter function was evaluated by CAT assays using β-galactosidase activity to normalize transfection efficiency. The 1.8-kb Dp71 promoter fragment (p1.8CAT) drove the efficient expression of CAT in C2C12 myoblast compared with promoterless pSV0CAT (Fig. 3). As expected from the mRNA results described above, reporter activity of the Dp71 promoter decreased by 70% in differentiated cells (Fig. 2). Because the induction of muscle cell differentiation was also modulated by the addition of cAMP (33Usuki F. Ishiura S. Sasagawa N. Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. Shimizu T. Terao T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 34Drab M. Haller H. Bychkov R. Erdmann B. Lindschau C. Haase H. Morano I. Luft F.C. Wobus A.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 905-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), we decided to evaluate the effect of this alternative inductor of differentiation on the Dp71 promoter activity. For that purpose, myoblasts, transiently transfected with the p1.8CAT vector, were cultured in growth medium for 48 h with or without cAMP. Fig. 2 shows that cAMP treatment resulted in a 40% inhibition of CAT activity, whereas a negative control experiment, in which the nerve growth factor was added to the proliferation medium, provoked no changes in CAT activity. Altogether, these results indicate that Dp71 promoter responds negatively in a specific way to inducers of skeletal muscle differentiation.Fig. 2Effect of myogenesis induction on the Dp71 promoter activity. C2C12 cell cultures were cotransfected with vector p1.8CAT that contains the 1.8-kb Dp71 promoter region and pRSV-β-gal. Transfected cells were either maintained under proliferating conditions or induced to differentiate for 2 days by culturing in differentiation medium (1% FBS) or by adding 1 mm dibutyryl-cAMP (db-cAMP) to the proliferation medium. The resulting CAT activities were normalized against β-galactosidase activities, and the reporter activity of undifferentiated control cells (cells cultured in medium supplements with 10% FBS) was set at 100%. In negative control experiments, nerve growth factor (NGF) at 2 nm was added to cells cultured in proliferation medium. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments, each performed in duplicate. Asterisks denote significant diffe"
https://openalex.org/W1972312554,"Current antagonists for the parathyroid hormone (PTH)/PTH-related protein (PTHrP) receptor (PTHR) are N-terminally truncated or N-terminally modified analogs of PTH(1–34) or PTHrP(1–34) and are thought to bind predominantly to the N-terminal extracellular (N) domain of the receptor. We hypothesized that ligands that bind only to PTHR region comprised of the extracellular loops and seven transmembrane helices (the juxtamembrane or J domain) could also antagonize the PTHR. To test this, we started with the J domain-selective agonists [Gln10,Ala12,Har11,Trp14,Arg19 (M)]PTH(1–21), [M]PTH(1–15), and [M]PTH(1–14), and introduced substitutions at positions 1–3 that were predicted to dissociate PTHR binding and cAMP signaling activities. Strong dissociation was observed with the tri-residue sequence diethylglycine (Deg)1-para-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine (Bpa)2-Deg3. In HKRK-B7 cells, which express the cloned human PTHR, [Deg1,3,Bpa2,M]PTH(1–21), [Deg1,3,Bpa2,M]PTH(1–15), and [Deg1,3,Bpa2,M]PTH(1–14) fully inhibited (IC50s = 100–700 nm) the binding of 125I-[α-aminoisobutyric acid1,3,M]PTH(1–15) and were severely defective for stimulating cAMP accumulation. In ROS 17/2.8 cells, which express the native rat PTHR, [Deg1,3,Bpa2,M]PTH(1–21) and [Deg1,3,Bpa2,M]PTH(1–15) antagonized the cAMP-agonist action of PTH(1–34), as did PTHrP(5–36) (IC50s = 0.7 μm, 2.6 μm, and 36 nm, respectively). In COS-7 cells expressing PTHR-delNt, which lacks the N domain of the receptor, [Deg1,3,Bpa2, M]PTH(1–21) and [Deg1,3,Bpa2,M]PTH(1–15) inhibited the agonist actions of [α-aminoisobutyric acid1,3]PTH(1–34) and [M]PTH(1–14) (IC50s ∼1 μm), whereas PTHrP(5–36) failed to inhibit. [Deg1,3,Bpa2,M]PTH(1–14) inhibited the constitutive cAMP-signaling activity of PTHR-tether-PTH(1–9), in which the PTH(1–9) sequence is covalently linked to the PTHR J domain, as well as that of PTHRcamH223R. Thus, the J-domain-selective N-terminal PTH fragment analogs can function as antagonists as well as inverse agonists for the PTHR. The new ligands described should be useful for further studies of the ligand binding and activation mechanisms that operate in the critical PTHR J domain. Current antagonists for the parathyroid hormone (PTH)/PTH-related protein (PTHrP) receptor (PTHR) are N-terminally truncated or N-terminally modified analogs of PTH(1–34) or PTHrP(1–34) and are thought to bind predominantly to the N-terminal extracellular (N) domain of the receptor. We hypothesized that ligands that bind only to PTHR region comprised of the extracellular loops and seven transmembrane helices (the juxtamembrane or J domain) could also antagonize the PTHR. To test this, we started with the J domain-selective agonists [Gln10,Ala12,Har11,Trp14,Arg19 (M)]PTH(1–21), [M]PTH(1–15), and [M]PTH(1–14), and introduced substitutions at positions 1–3 that were predicted to dissociate PTHR binding and cAMP signaling activities. Strong dissociation was observed with the tri-residue sequence diethylglycine (Deg)1-para-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine (Bpa)2-Deg3. In HKRK-B7 cells, which express the cloned human PTHR, [Deg1,3,Bpa2,M]PTH(1–21), [Deg1,3,Bpa2,M]PTH(1–15), and [Deg1,3,Bpa2,M]PTH(1–14) fully inhibited (IC50s = 100–700 nm) the binding of 125I-[α-aminoisobutyric acid1,3,M]PTH(1–15) and were severely defective for stimulating cAMP accumulation. In ROS 17/2.8 cells, which express the native rat PTHR, [Deg1,3,Bpa2,M]PTH(1–21) and [Deg1,3,Bpa2,M]PTH(1–15) antagonized the cAMP-agonist action of PTH(1–34), as did PTHrP(5–36) (IC50s = 0.7 μm, 2.6 μm, and 36 nm, respectively). In COS-7 cells expressing PTHR-delNt, which lacks the N domain of the receptor, [Deg1,3,Bpa2, M]PTH(1–21) and [Deg1,3,Bpa2,M]PTH(1–15) inhibited the agonist actions of [α-aminoisobutyric acid1,3]PTH(1–34) and [M]PTH(1–14) (IC50s ∼1 μm), whereas PTHrP(5–36) failed to inhibit. [Deg1,3,Bpa2,M]PTH(1–14) inhibited the constitutive cAMP-signaling activity of PTHR-tether-PTH(1–9), in which the PTH(1–9) sequence is covalently linked to the PTHR J domain, as well as that of PTHRcamH223R. Thus, the J-domain-selective N-terminal PTH fragment analogs can function as antagonists as well as inverse agonists for the PTHR. The new ligands described should be useful for further studies of the ligand binding and activation mechanisms that operate in the critical PTHR J domain.

These two peptide ligands mediate their actions by binding to the same receptor, the PTH/PTHrP receptor or PTHR (or PTH receptor subtype 1). The PTHR is abundantly expressed in bone and kidney, the principal target organs of PTH, and in a variety of developing tissues (e.g. skeleton, heart, and mammary glands), where it mediates the actions of PTHrP. Excessive circulating levels of PTH, as occurs in cases of hyperparathyroidism, or PTHrP, as frequently occurs in cancer because of secretion by malignant tumors, produces a hypercalcemic state, which can be severely debilitating and potentially fatal (1Juppner H.

For both PTH and PTHrP, the first 34 amino acids encode all of the information needed for binding to and activating the PTHR.The PTHR is a class 2 G protein-coupled receptor that activates the adenylyl cyclase/cAMP signaling pathway. Like all class 2 G protein-coupled receptors that bind peptide hormones, the PTHR has a relatively large (∼160 amino acid) N-terminal extracellular domain, herein termed the N domain (3Hoare S.

These studies have led to a “two-site” model for the ligand-receptor interaction mechanism, according to which the C-terminal portion of PTH(1–34) (i.e. residues in the 23–34 region) binds to the N domain of the receptor to provide the majority of the binding energy to the complex, and the N-terminal portion of the ligand interacts with a lower affinity with the J domain of the receptor to induce activation (3Hoare S.

In particular, we have used the PTH(1–14) fragment as a scaffold peptide for performing substitution analysis of the principal signaling domain of the hormone. Native PTH(1–14) binds only poorly to the PTHR and is a very weak agonist (EC50 for stimulating cAMP formation = ∼1 × 10–4 m) (6Luck M. Carter P. Gardella T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 670-680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A number of affinity-enhancing substitutions in the PTH(1–14) scaffold have been identified that, when combined, increase the cAMP-stimulating potency of the peptide by as much as 100,000-fold (7Shimizu M. Potts J.J. Gardella T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21836-21843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 28Shimizu M. Carter P. Khatri A. Potts J.J. Gardella T.

These substitutions include Ser1 → Ac5c (aminocyclopentane-1-carboxylic acid), Ser3 → Aib (α-aminoisobutyric acid), Asn10 → Gln, Leu11 → Har(homoarginine), Gly12 → Ala and His14 → Trp, and have resulted in potent analogs such as [Ac5c1,Aib3,Gln10,Har11,Ala12,Trp14]-PTH(1–14)amide (30Shimizu N.

In cell-based assays of cAMP formation, the potency of [Ac5c1,Aib3,M]PTH(1–14) is in the low nanomolar range and thus similar to that seen for PTH(1–34) (30Shimizu N. Dean T. Khatri A. Gardella T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2004; 19: 2078-2086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The modified PTH(1–14) analogs resulting from these studies have helped to define the minimum N-terminal PTH agonist pharmacophore, which currently appears to reside within the first 9 or 10 amino acids of the hormone (7Shimizu M.

Each of the PTH(1–14) analogs studied so far maintains the same potency on a PTHR construct (PTHR-delNt) that lacks the N domain of the receptor as it does on the intact PTHR; in contrast, PTH(1–34) is ∼100-fold less potent on PTHR-delNt than it is on the intact PTHR (7Shimizu M.

Furthermore, the PTHR J domain, as defined by PTHR-delNt, can be sufficient to mediate transmembrane signaling and G protein coupling. Recent functional (11Shimizu M. Shimizu N. Tsang J. Petroni B.

Mol.

Structural studies performed on isolated PTH peptides indicate that the 1–20 region of PTH can adopt an α-helical conformation (17Jin L. Briggs S. Chandrasekhar S. Chirgadze N. Clawson D. Schevitz R.

For the PTHR, all current antagonists are PTH or PTHrP analogs that extend C-terminally to at least residue 34 and are thought to depend strongly, although probably not completely (11Shimizu M. Shimizu N. Tsang J. Petroni B. Khatri A. Potts Jr., J.T. Gardella T.

The lack of signaling activity in these antagonist can be attributed to either the deletion, or modification, of N-terminal residues of the ligand, which are well known to play a critical role in PTHR activation (34Tregear G.W.

Several of the previous PTHR antagonists, including [Leu11,d-Trp12]PTHrP(7–34), [Leu11,d-Trp12]PTHrP(5–36), and [Bpa2]PTHrP(1–36), function as inverse agonists on the constitutively active mutant PTHRs, PTHRcamT410P, and/or PTHRcamH223R (42Gardella T.

Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1534-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).In the current studies, we hypothesized that a ligand that binds exclusively to the PTHR J domain could, if appropriately modified, function as a PTHR antagonist. Such an antagonist would differ mechanistically from the previous, C-terminally extended PTHR antagonists and, as such, would represent a novel class of PTHR ligands that could potentially be useful in analyzing the ligand binding and activation mechanisms used by the PTHR. As an initial test of this hypothesis, we sought to confer antagonist activity to the recently described N-terminal PTH agonist analogs. We thus started with [Ac5c1,Aib3,M]PTH(1–14) (30Shimizu N. Dean T. Khatri A. Gardella T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2004; 19: 2078-2086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and introduced into this scaffold substitutions at positions 1–3 (30Shimizu N. Dean T. Khatri A.

Most of these substitutions had the predicted effects. We thus identified several new analogs of [M]PTH(1–14), [M]PTH(1–15), and [M]PTH(1–21) that function as antagonists and, in some cases, inverse agonists for the PTHR. We show that these new antagonists indeed bind predominantly, if not exclusively, to the PTHR J domain.MATERIALS AND METHODSPeptides—The peptides used in the study are described in Table I and were synthesized using Fmoc chemistry and either a small-scale, multiple peptide synthesizer (Advanced Chemtech Model 396 MBS) with HBTU/HOBt/DIEA (O-benzotriazol-1-yl-N,N,N′N,′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate/1-hydroxybenzotriazole/N,N-diisopropylethylamine; 1:1:2 molar ratio) chemistry, a 10-fold molar excess relative to substrate of Fmoc amino acid, and double couplings, or a large-scale synthesizer (Applied Biosystems model 431A) with DCC/HOBt chemistry, a 10–40-fold molar excess of Fmoc amino acid, and extended (3-h) coupling cycles. Peptides were desalted (C18 Sep-Pak), purified by reverse-phase HPLC, and verified by analytical HPLC, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry, and amino acid analysis. The lyophilized peptides were reconstituted as stock solutions in 10 mm acetic acid; the purity, identity and exact peptide concentration of each stock solution (∼3 × 10–3 m) was secured by amino acid analysis. The stock solutions were stored at –80 °C.

Competition Binding Assays—Binding studies were performed using 125I-[Aib1,3,M]PTH(1–15) as the tracer radioligand and varying concentrations of unlabeled test peptides as competitors, as described previously (29Shimizu N.

In brief, cells in 24-well plates were rinsed in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 5% heat-inactivated horse serum, 0.5% fetal bovine serum, adjusted to pH 7.7 with HCl),and the following three components were added to the well successively, 100 μl of binding buffer, 100 μl of binding buffer containing an unlabeled test peptide, and 100 μl binding buffer containing 125I-[Aib1,3,M]PTH(1–15) (∼100,000 cpm/well). All solutions were ice-cold, and the plates were embedded in a tray of ice during the addition phase. The plates were then incubated in a 15 °C water bath for 4 h, after which the well contents were removed by aspiration, and the cell monolayers were rinsed three times by adding and rapidly removing 0.5 ml of binding buffer. Then, 0.5 ml of 5 n NaOH was added to lyse the monolayers followed by the addition of 2.0 ml of H20, and the entire lysate was counted for radioactivity. Nonspecific binding was determined in wells containing an excess (1 × 10–5 m) of an unlabeled high affinity ligand, and the total specific binding at each competing ligand concentration was calculated as a percentile of the total specific binding observed in the absence of competitor. The data were then analyzed by non-linear regression analysis to obtain fitted curves and IC50 values (see below).cAMP Stimulation Assays—Assays were performed in whole cells in 24-well plates, in which the cells had formed confluent monolayers 2–4 days prior to assay and had attained densities of 200,000–300,000 cells/well, as described previously (29Shimizu N.

For assays involving the addition of two peptides (agonist plus antagonist), cells were rinsed with IBMX-binding buffer and the following three components were added to the wells successively, 100 μl of IBMX-binding buffer, 100 μl of IBMX-binding buffer containing an antagonist peptide, and 100 μl of IBMX-binding buffer containing an agonist peptide.

Adenosine acts through the A2b receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor that couples positively to Gαs and activates adenylate cyclase. This leads to cAMP-mediated electrogenic chloride secretion in intestinal epithelia. To better understand the regulation of the A2b receptor in intestinal epithelia, we studied the effects of interferon-γ (IFN-γ), a potent immunomodulatory cytokine, in the T84 cell line. Pretreatment of cells with 500 units/ml IFN-γ for 12 h inhibited an adenosine-induced short circuit current (Isc) without affecting the transepithelial resistance. Under these conditions, IFN-γ did not inhibit the protein expression or membrane recruitment of the A2b receptor, shown to be essential for its function. Interestingly, IFN-γ inhibited cAMP levels as well as its downstream signaling pathway as shown by the inhibition of adenosine-induced phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein and protein kinase A activity. Similar studies with forskolin, a direct activator of adenylate cyclase, also demonstrated inhibition of cAMP and its downstream response by IFN-γ. However, IFN-γ did not affect secretory responses to the calcium-dependent secretagogue carbachol or cAMP analog 8-bromo-cAMP, indicating that normal secretory responses to adequate second messengers in IFN-γ-treated cells are achievable. Moreover, IFN-γ inhibited the expression of adenylate cyclase isoforms 5 and 7. In conclusion, we demonstrate that IFN-γ down-regulates adenosine-mediated signaling possibly through the direct inhibition of adenylate cyclase expression. We propose that IFN-γ may acutely affect global cAMP-mediated responses in the intestinal epithelia, thereby decreasing secretory responses, which may consequently aggravate inflammatory processes.

Adenosine is an important modulator of physiological as well as inflammatory responses in humans. Adenosine is generated during active inflammation, and levels increase both in the intestinal lumen and in tissue during inflammation to as high as 500–600 nm (1Cronstein B.N. J. Appl. Physiol. 1994; 76: 5-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar).

Interestingly, the A2bR is the predominant adenosine receptor expressed in the caecum and colon in both the model colonic cell line T84 and in intact human colonic mucosa (3Strohmeier G.R.

Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1598-1604PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, in the model colonic epithelia T84 cells, the A2bR is the only adenosine receptor expressed (3Strohmeier G.R. Reppert S.M. Lencer W.I.

Comp. Neurol. 2001; 439: 46-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Depending on the organ, the A2bR activates pro- or anti-inflammatory pathways. For example, in the joints and cardiovascular system, the A2bR is anti-inflammatory, whereas in the lung the A2bR is a potent proinflammatory mediator, and the A2bR antagonists are evolving as potential drugs for reactive airway disease (2Bucheimer R.E. Linden J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2004; 555: 311-321Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In the intestine, apical or basolateral stimulation of the A2bR results in cAMP-dependent electrogenic chloride secretion through the activation of chloride channels (3Strohmeier G.R. Reppert S.M.

Active chloride secretion by intestinal crypt enterocytes is known to be the central pathophysiological disturbance in acute and chronic diarrheal illnesses (7Baird A.W. Ir. J. Med. Sci. 1994; 163: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In addition to chloride secretion, adenosine also induces apically directed interleukin-6 secretion and fibronectin secretion (8Sitaraman S.V. Merlin D. Wang L. Wong M. Gewirtz A.T. Si-Tahar M.

Thus adenosine, acting through the A2bR, modulates intestinal secretion and inflammatory response in a cAMP-dependent manner. In the intestinal epithelial cells, the A2bR couples positively to Gαs and activates adenylate cyclase. Apical or basolateral stimulation of the A2bR induces an increase in intracellular cAMP and downstream cAMP signaling including phosphorylation and activation of the transcription factor, CREB and the activation of PKA (3Strohmeier G.R.

Unlike mast cells, where the A2bR also couples to Gq and increases intracellular calcium (13Feoktistov I. Goldstein A.E. Biaggioni I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 726-734PubMed Google Scholar), cAMP is the only signaling pathway mediated by the A2bR in the intestinal epithelial cells (3Strohmeier G.R. Reppert S.M. Lencer W.I. Madara J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2387-2394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that the A2bR is recruited to the membrane upon agonist stimulation and exists as a multiprotein complex at the membrane with the PDZ domain-containing protein, NHERF-2, cytoskeletal anchoring protein, ezrin, and PKA (11Sitaraman S.V.

Although the expression and biological effect of adenosine in the intestine have been characterized, the regulation of the A2b is not known. The major goal of this study is to characterize the regulation of the A2bR by interferon-γ (IFN-γ). IFN-γ is an immunoregulatory cytokine produced by T helper 1 cells. It is highly up-regulated during chronic inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease as well as during acute viral or bacterial enteritis and is thought to play a central role in the pathogenesis of inflammation and diarrhea associated with these diseases (14Vancott J.L. McNeal M.M. Choi A.H. Ward R.L. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2003; 23: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 15Stockmann M. Schmitz H. Fromm M. Schmidt W. Pauli G. Scholz P. Riecken E.O.

Leukocyte Biol. 2004; 75: 163-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (2790) Google Scholar). During inflammation, IFN-γ directly affects the enterocytes, including the Cl–-secreting crypt cells, and regulates enterocyte functions including barrier regulation and ion secretion (17Fish S.M. Proujansky R. Reenstra W.W. Gut. 1999; 45: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 18Breese E. Braegger C.P. Corrigan C.J. Walker-Smith J.A. MacDonald T.T.

The effect of chronic exposure to IFN-γ (>24 h) on enterocyte function has been studied extensively. Prior studies using vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), cholera toxin (cAMP-mediated Isc), and carbachol (calcium-mediated Isc) demonstrated significant decrease in transepithelial resistance (TER) and chloride secretion after prolonged treatment with IFN-γ (>24–48 h) without altering the morphology of cells. This inhibition in secretory response has been attributed to decreased synthesis/expression of cystic fibrosis conductance regulator (CFTR) (20Besancon F. Przewlocki G. Baro I. Hongre A.S. Escande D. Edelman A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1398-C1404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Na+K+-ATPase, and/or Na+K+-2Cl– cotransporter required for anion secretion (21Sugi K. Musch M.W. Field M. Chang E.B. Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 1393-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Although the chronic effects of IFN-γ have been well characterized, the acute effect of this cytokine on secretory response in intestinal epithelia is not known. In this study we investigated the effect of acute IFN-γ exposure on the expression, signaling, and secretory function of the A2bR. Reagents—Adenosine was obtained from Research Biochemicals International (Natick, MA). Reagents for SDS-PAGE and nitrocellulose membranes (0.45-μm pores) were from Bio-Rad. Anti-A2bR antibody (used at 1:1,000 dilution) was obtained from Alpha Diagnostics, Inc. (San Antonio, TX). Anti phospho-CREB and CREB (used at 1:1,000) polyclonal antibodies were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). IFN-γ was from R&D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis). Forskolin (FSK) was from Calbiochem. Carbachol was from Sigma. Isoform-specific anti-adenylate cyclase antibodies (used at 1:200 for AC-5 and 1:500 dilution for all others) were from FabGennix, Inc. (Frisco, TX). β-Actin antibody used at (1:200 dilution) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Na+K+-ATPase was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY) (used at 0.1 μg/ml). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG was obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory (West Grove, PA). A cAMP screen kit was from Applied Biosystems (Bedford, MA), and the PKA assay kit was from Calbiochem. Rolipram, 8-methoxylmethylisobutylmethylxanthine, trequinsin, and isobutylmethylxanthine were from Biomol Research Laboratories Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). The One-step RT-PCR kit was obtained from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Cell Culture—T84 cells were grown and maintained in culture as described previously (22Merlin D. Jiang L. Strohmeier G.R. Nusrat A. Alper S.L. Lencer W.I. Madara J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C484-C495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and F-12 medium supplemented with 40 mg/liter penicillin, 90 mg/liter streptomycin, and 5% newborn calf serum. Confluent stock monolayers were subcultured by trypsinization. Experiments were done on cells plated for 7–8 days on permeable supports of 0.33-cm2, 4.5-cm2 inserts or 1-cm2 snap well filters (Costar, Cambridge, MA). Inserts (0.4-μm pore size, Costar) rested in wells containing medium until steady-state resistance was achieved, as described previously. This permits apical and basolateral membranes to be interfaced separately with apical and basolateral buffer, a configuration identical to that developed previously for various microassays. The T84 cells had a high electrical resistance (900–1,200 Ω/cm2 n = 50 monolayers). All experiments were performed on T84 cells between passages 69 and 76. Ussing Chamber Electrophysiology Studies—T84 cells were plated on snap well filters (12-mm diameter, 0.4-μm pore size, Costar), surface area of 1 cm2, and were grown to confluence (∼8 days) until steady-state resistance was achieved. The filter rings were detached and mounted in an Ussing chamber and were incubated with Hanks' balanced salt solution at 37 °C and bubbled continuously with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. The fluid volume on each side of the filter was 5 ml. Voltage-sensing electrodes consisting of Ag/AgCl pellets and current-passing electrodes of silver wire were connected by agar bridges containing 3 m KCl and interfaced via head-stage amplifiers to a microcomputer-controlled voltage/current clamp VCC-MC6, respectively (Physiologic Instruments, San Diego). Voltage-sensing electrodes were matched to within 1-mV asymmetry and corrected by offset-removal circuit. The current between the two compartments (values reported are referenced to the apical side) were monitored and recorded at 20-s intervals, whereas the voltage was clamped to 0. The voltage was measured with blank filters first in buffer to be used for the experiments. The values obtained, generally less than 1 mV in magnitude, represent the difference in junction potentials between the two voltage-sensing bridges summed with any potential that might exist across the filter membrane. These values were subtracted from all subsequent measurements with filters containing attached cell monolayers. The total resistance between apical and basal compartments was determined throughout the experiment from the current evoked by a 5-μA bipolar voltage pulse. Before Ussing chamber experiments the cell monolayers were pretreated basolaterally with or without IFN-γ with various doses (1–1,000 units/ml) and various time intervals starting from 1 to 48 h. After a sustained base-line Isc cells were stimulated with 10–2 mm apical or basolateral adenosine and 10 μm FSK. The increase in Isc was then determined. Preparation of Plasma Membrane—The plasma membrane fraction was prepared from T84 cells plated in 4.5-cm2 inserts as described previously (23Gouraud S. Laera A. Calamita G. Carmosino M. Procino G. Rossetto O. Mannucci R. Rosenthal W. Svelto M. Valenti G. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3667-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Monolayers were washed in phosphate-buffered saline scraped with a rubber policeman and homogenized with a glass/Teflon homogenizer in ice-cold buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C (23Gouraud S. Laera A. Calamita G. Carmosino M. Procino G. Rossetto O. Mannucci R. Rosenthal W. Svelto M. Valenti G. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3667-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The pellet enriched in plasma membrane was recovered in lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors. Protein quantitation was done using the Lowry method (Bio-Rad). SDS-PAGE and Western Blot—Cells were lysed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), EDTA, SDS, sodium orthovanadate, and sodium fluoride. SDS-PAGE was performed according to the Laemmli procedure using acrylamide gel. Proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with primary antibody. Membranes were then incubated with corresponding peroxidase-linked secondary antibody diluted 1:2,000, washed, and subsequently incubated with ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences) before exposure to high performance chemiluminescence films (Amersham Biosciences). For molecular mass determination, polyacrylamide gels were calibrated using standard proteins (Bio-Rad) with markers within the range 10–250 kDa. Quantitation of Western Blot—The band intensity of Western blot was quantitated using a gel documentation system (Alpha Innotech Co., San Leandro, CA). cAMP Measurement—T84 cells were treated with or without basolateral IFN-γ (1–1,000 units/ml), and cells were stimulated with 10–2 mm apical and basolateral adenosine and 10 μm FSK. cAMP measurements were done in whole cell lysates using a competitive cAMP immunoassay kit (Applied Biosystems, Bedlford, MA). Luminescence was read with luminoscan Ascent Thermo Labsystems (Needham Heights, MA). PKA Assay—For the determination of PKA activity in IFN-γ-treated cells, T84 cells were treated with or without basolateral IFN-γ (500 units/ml) for 12h and were stimulated with apical, basolateral adenosine or FSK. PKA activity was determined using a protein kinase assay kit from Calbiochem. An equal amount of cell lysate was added to the PKA reaction mixture containing ATP solution, biotinylated Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide), cAMP solution, PKA reaction buffer, and 0.2 μCi/μl [γ- 32P]ATP. Both enzyme and substrate controls were included. Reactions were terminated, and Kemptide was precipitated with avidin. Samples were washed repeatedly, and the radioactivity was counted using a liquid scintillation counter (LKB Wallac 1219 Rackbeta). Aliquots from each sample were taken for protein determination using the Bio-Rad protein assay. PKA specific activity was measured as pmol of phosphate incorporated/min/μg of protein, and the relative increase in PKA activity was calculated in relation to the untreated control. RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from monolayers of T84 cells by the TRIzol extraction method (TRIzol Reagent, Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH). The RNA was then used to amplify fragments of the cDNA of AC-1–9 by RT-PCR employing the Qiagen One-step RT-PCR kit. The primers were designed on the basis of the AC-1–9 nucleotides sequences available in the GenBank data base (Table I). A positive control was performed by using primers specific for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (sense, gccaaggtcatccatgacaac; anti-sense, gtccaccaccctgttgctgta; product size 494 bp). One-step RT-PCR was performed with the following program. A reverse transcription reaction was initiated at 50 °C for 30 min. PCR activation at 94 °C for 15 min was followed by 40 cycles, each consisted of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min, and final extension time was set at 72 °C for 10 min.Table IAC isoform-specific primers Statistical Analysis—The data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using Graphpad Instat 3 software (www.graphpad.com). Groups were compared using parametric tests (paired Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance with post-test following statistical standards). p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. IFN-γ Inhibits Adenosine-induced Isc in T84 cells—To determine the effect of IFN-γ on adenosine-induced Isc, confluent monolayers of epithelial cells, grown on snap well filters, were pretreated basolaterally with 500 units/ml IFN-γ for 12 h. The monolayers were then mounted in a Ussing chamber. As shown in Fig. 1A, IFN-γ did not affect base-line Isc and TER compared with untreated cell monolayers (untreated cells Isc 3.0 ± 0.5 μA/cm2 and TER 900 ± 250 Ω/cm2, and cells treated with IFN-γ Isc 2.9 ± 0.5 μA/cm2 and TER 1,000 ± 200 Ω/cm2). These results demonstrate that the barrier function as determined by TER measurements was not affected by IFN-γ treatment. To investigate the effect of IFN-γ on the regulation of adenosine-induced Isc, monolayers were stimulated with 100 μm apical (AA) or basolateral (BA) adenosine or basolateral 100 μm (Bs) carbachol after a sustained baseline current. As shown in Fig. 1B, IFN-γ treatment significantly decreased both apical and basolateral adenosine induced Isc (IFN-γ + AA = 4 ± 1, IFN-γ + BA = 3 ± 1 μA/cm2) compared with adenosine alone (AA = 13 ± 4, BA = 19 ± 4 μA/cm2). On the other hand, IFN-γ had no effect on carbachol-mediated Isc (carbachol = 59 ± 7, IFN-γ + carbachol = 57 ± 5 μA/cm2). We next investigated the dose response of IFN-γ-induced inhibition of adenosine-mediated Isc response. T84 cells plated on snap well filters were pretreated with IFN-γ (1, 5, 10, 50, 100, and 500 units) for 12 h. Snap wells were then mounted on an Ussing chamber, stimulated with 100 μm adenosine for 5 min, then Isc and TER were measured. The inhibition of adenosine-induced Isc (19 ± 4 μA/cm2) began at 10 units (40% ± 5) and was maximal at 500 units (90% ± 5) with an EC50 at 50 units of IFN-γ. IFN-γ Does Not Inhibit A2bR Expression or Its Recruitment to Membrane—Because IFN-γ inhibited the A2bR-mediated function, we studied its effect on the receptor protein expression. T84 cells plated on a membrane-permeable support were pretreated basolaterally with 500 units/ml IFN-γ for 12 h and stimulated with 100 μm apical or basolateral adenosine for 5 min. As shown in the Fig. 2A, Western blot of whole cell lysates showed no difference in band intensity between untreated cells (first lane, AA; second lane, BA) and cells pretreated with IFN-γ (third lane, IFN-γ + AA; fourth lane, IFN-γ + BA). Earlier studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that the A2bR is recruited to the membrane upon agonist stimulation (11Sitaraman S.V. Wang L. Wong M. Bruewer M. Hobert M. Yun C.H. Merlin D.

Sitaraman S.V. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: G1100-G1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To explore the effect of IFN-γ on the recruitment of the receptor to the membrane, we performed Western blot analysis of the A2bR on plasma membrane fractions. The cells were stimulated with apical or basolateral adenosine after pretreatment with or without IFN-γ for 12 h. Plasma membrane was isolated as described under “Materials and Methods.” As shown in Fig. 2B, adenosine stimulation resulted in recruitment of the receptor to the plasma membrane within 5 min (center lane), and IFN-γ pretreatment did not alter the adenosine-induced recruitment of the receptor to the membrane (right lane). The bar chart shows densitometric quantification of A2bR recruitment to the plasma membrane. β-Actin as loading control and Na+K+-ATPase as membrane marker are shown. IFN-γ Inhibits A2b Receptor Signaling—the A2bR couples positively to Gαs and activates adenylate cyclase. We have shown previously that apical or basolateral stimulation of the A2bR induces an increase in intracellular cAMP (3Strohmeier G.R. Reppert S.M. Lencer W.I. Madara J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2387-2394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). We next studied the effect of IFN-γ on adenosine-induced cAMP. T84 cells were pretreated with or without 500 units/ml IFN-γ for 12 h, and cAMP levels stimulated by 100 μm apical adenosine and basolateral adenosine were quantitated using a luminometric assay as described under “Materials and Methods.” As expected, both apical and basolateral adenosine increased cAMP levels, which were maximum at 5 min after stimulation (AA = 0.24 ± 0.07, BA = 5.1 ± 0.1) (pmol/106 cells). As shown in Fig. 3, pretreatment of cells with IFN-γ resulted in the inhibition of both apical and basolateral adenosine-stimulated cAMP levels by ∼60 and 85%, respectively (IFN-γ +AA = 0.1 ± 0.02, IFN-γ + BA = 0.32 ± 0.01 pmol/106 cells, respectively). IFN-γ alone did not affect basal cAMP compared with unstimulated cells (IFN-γ 0.07 ± 0.04 and unstimulated = 0.1 ± 0.04 pmol/106 cells, respectively). IFN-γ Inhibits cAMP-mediated Downstream Signaling-Phosphorylation of CREB and PKA Activation—Activation of the A2bR leads to downstream cAMP signaling including phosphorylation and activation of the transcription factor CREB and the activation of PKA. To explore further the effect of IFN-γ on downstream cAMP signaling, Western blot analysis was carried out to determine its effect on phosphorylation of CREB. T84 monolayers were pretreated with or without 500 units/ml IFN-γ for 12 h and stimulated with 100 μm adenosine. Whole cell lysates were then subjected to Western blot using anti-phospho-CREB antibody. As shown in the top panel of Fig. 4A, adenosine induced serine phosphorylation of CREB at 15 min and was decreased at 45 min (second and third lanes). IFN-γ pretreatment inhibited adenosine-induced CREB activation at 15 and 45 min (fourth and fifth lanes). The bar chart at the bottom of Fig. 4A shows densitometric quantification of phospho-CREB/total CREB band, which demonstrated ∼60% reduction in band intensity in IFN-γ-pretreated cells compared with untreated cells. To study the effect of IFN-γ on PKA activity, T84 monolayers were pretreated with 500 units/ml IFN-γ for 12 h before the addition of 100 μm apical or basolateral adenosine for 5 and 30 min. The PKA activity was measured as described under “Materials and Methods.” Both the apical and basolateral adenosine induced PKA activity, which was maximal at 5 min and returned to base line at 30 min. As shown in Fig. 4B, IFN-γ inhibited both apical and basolateral adenosine-mediated PKA activation (IFN-γ + AA = 0.27 ± 0.01 versus AA = 0.67 ± 0.01; IFN-γ + BA = 0.32 ± 0.05 versus BA = 0.7 ± 0.08; unstimulated 0.28 ± 0.01, IFN-γ 0.27 ± 0.01 pmol of phosphate incorporated/min/μg of protein). These data suggest that IFN-γ may inhibit A2bR signaling by affecting the activity of adenylate cyclase or by inducing the degradation of cAMP via the activation of phosphodiesterases. To evaluate the involvement of phosphodiesterase, we studied the effect of various phosphodiesterase inhibitors 8-methoxymethyl-isobutylmethylxanthine, trequinsin, and rolipram on reversing the IFN-γ-induced inhibition of adenosine-mediated Isc. Interestingly, phosphodiesterase activity was unchanged, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors did not reverse IFN-γ-mediated inhibition of Isc (data not shown). These data led us to hypothesize that IFN-γ directly inhibited adenylate cyclase activity and/or its expression. IFN-γ Inhibits FSK (a Direct Activator of Adenylate Cyclase)-induced Short Circuit Current in a Dose- and Time-dependent Manner—We investigated the effect of IFN-γ on FSK-induced cAMP and Isc. T84 cells were pretreated with different doses of IFN-γ (1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500 units/ml, respectively) before mounting the snap wells onto the Ussing chamber. The cells were then stimulated with 10 μm FSK, and Isc and TER were measured after sustained base-line Isc. A dose-dependent inhibition of FSK-induced Isc was observed compared with untreated cells (Fig. 5A). The inhibition of FSK-induced Isc (45 ± 5 μA/cm2) was seen begin"

Three SREBP isoforms, 1a, 1c, and 2, are expressed at varying levels in different tissues. Thus, homo- and heterodimers probably contribute to overall SREBP activity.

Studies with overexpressed SREBP monomers are inconclusive regarding the function of a particular SREBP dimer because of potential dimerization with endogenous proteins. To assess activation by a particular SREBP dimer, we fused DNA encoding individual monomers together via a predicted flexible polypeptide tether. Tethered SREBP dimers bound DNA equivalently to the monomeric proteins and were resistant to dominant negative SREBP-1 inhibition, confirming preferential formation of intramolecular dimers. Tethered SREBP-1a and -2 homodimers, similar to the monomeric forms, activated target genes more robustly than tethered SREBP-1c homodimers. A forced SREBP-1a/2 heterodimer had similar activity to the respective homodimers. However, SREBP-1c in a heterodimer with either SREBP-1a or -2 attenuated the activity relative to the SREBP-1a or -2 homodimers. These experiments provide some of the first data showing that the integrity of both activation domains in a dimeric transcription factor is required for maximal activity. In addition, the results support a model where changes in SREBP-1c protein expression that occur in response to insulin signaling and liver X receptor signaling would be predicted to increase or decrease overall SREBP activity in a tissue-specific fashion depending on the initial fractional contribution of SREBP-1c to total cellular levels of SREBP.

Investig. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3838) Google Scholar). The common bHLHLZ domain is responsible for dimerization and DNA binding, whereas a separate domain(s) is responsible for stimulating transcription through interactions with other DNA binding and non-DNA binding co-regulators and co-activators (3Sato R.

Biol. 2004; 24: 8288-8300Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Two unique features that distinguish SREBPs from other family members include their initial translation into membranebound precursors and the presence of a signature tyrosine residue in the basic DNA binding domain (6Osborne T.F. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1995; 5: 317-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In sterol-replete cells, precursor SREBPs are kept in membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope; when a low cellular sterol level is sensed, the amino-terminal mature SREBP transcription factor is released into the cytoplasm through regulated intramembrane proteolysis (7Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar), and the soluble protein enters the nucleus where it gains access to its target genes. The unique tyrosine replaces an arginine that is crucial for site-specific DNA binding to the inverted repeat E-box site by most bHLH proteins (8Ferre-D'amare A.R. Pendergast G.C. Ziff E.B. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 363: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 9Kim J.B. Spotts G.D. Halvorsen Y-D. Shih H.-M. Ellenberger T. Towle H.C. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2582-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The tyrosine allows flexibility in folding of the basic domain, enabling only SREBPs to recognize both palindromic E-box sites as well as direct repeat sterol regulatory elements (SREs) with high affinity (10Parraga A. Bellsolell L. Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Burley S.K. Structure (Lond.). 1998; 6: 661-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This is sufficient to account for target gene specificity in cholesterol regulation because changing the SRE in the LDL receptor promoter into a palindromic E-box resulted in a loss of sterol regulation and high levels of unregulated expression, presumably mediated through constitutively expressed E-box-binding proteins (11Athanikar J.N. Osborne T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4935-4940Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Two SREBPs are encoded by overlapping mRNAs from the SREBP-1 gene (12Shimomura I. Shimano H. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 99: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). The two proteins, SREBP-1a and -1c, are identical except for their amino termini, where unique first exons encode 28 or 4 unique amino acids for SREBP-1a or -1c, respectively. The comparatively strong activation domain in SREBP-1a interacts efficiently with co-activators cAMP-response element-binding protein binding protein and the mediator complex (4Nåår A.M. Beauring P.A. Zhou S. Abraham S. Solomon W. Tjian R. Nature. 1999; 398: 828-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 5Toth J.I. Datta S. Athanikar J.N. Freedman L.P. Osborne T.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8288-8300Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Relatively weak activation by SREBP-1c results from its truncated activation domain interacting weakly with the same co-activators as SREBP-1a (5Toth J.I. Datta S. Athanikar J.N. Freedman L.P. Osborne T.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8288-8300Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). SREBP-2, the third family member, is expressed from a unique gene and has an activation domain similar to SREBP-1a. The bHLH domains of SREBP-1a and -1c are identical, and they share over 70% identity with the corresponding domain of SREBP-2 (6Osborne T.F. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1995; 5: 317-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Because mRNAs for all three SREBPs are co-expressed in varying ratios in most cell types (12Shimomura I. Shimano H. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 99: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar), the potential exists for assembly of homodimers as well as heterodimers with each other and with other related bHLH proteins. Overexpression of a dominant negative SREBP-1 protein can heterodimerize with and inhibit activation by SREBPs (13Rishi V. Gal J. Krylov D. Fridriksson J. Boysen M.S. Mandrup S. Vinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11863-11874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, no studies have directly compared activation by SREBP homo- and heterodimers. In fact, it is difficult to precisely determine whether activity attributed to any SREBP in a natural setting actually results from a homodimer, a specific heterodimer, or the combined effect from several different SREBP-containing dimeric complexes. Also, there are two separate activation domains in an SREBP dimer, which is true in most other dimeric transcription factors. In most instances, it is not clear whether both activation domains contribute to transcriptional activity or whether one monomer is required simply for DNA binding. To more accurately evaluate activation by specific SREBP-containing dimers, we fused together the coding sequences for individual SREBP monomers into a single open reading frame via a flexible peptide tether to restrict dimerization to the covalently linked subunits. This approach was based on the pioneering work of Neuhold and Wold (14Neuhold L.A. Wold B. Cell. 1993; 74: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) in the analysis of the bHLH proteins MyoD and E47. We report that tethered homodimers of either SREBP-1a or -2 activate transcription more robustly than the SREBP-1c homodimer, similar to what occurs when monomeric expression constructs are analyzed in cultured cells. Also, tethered heterodimers containing SREBP-1c with either SREBP-1a or -2 activate transcription to levels approximately halfway between the efficient activation of the SREBP-1a/1a or -2/2 homodimer and the weak activation mediated by the SREBP-1c/1c homodimer. When SREBP-1a is tethered to a truncated SREBP-1 mutant that lacks the entire activation domain, activity was similar to the tethered SREBP-1a/1c heterodimer, indicating that the SREBP-1c activation domain contributes little to transcription stimulated by the SREBP-1a/1c dimer. This observation forms the basis for a model where increased expression of SREBP-1c in different cell types can have opposite effects on SREBP-dependent gene expression depending on the baseline ratio of SREBP-1a to -1c. Tethered SREBP Dimer Fusions—To construct the tethered SREBP-1a homodimer fusion (designated SREBP-1a/SREBP-1a), first a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing an 18-amino acid tether (see sequence in Fig. 2A) was digested with EcoRI and ligated upstream of EcoRI-digested pCMV-5 containing mature SREBP-1a, as described previously. Next, a fragment containing the tether fused to the SREBP-1a coding sequence was excised as an XbaI fragment and subcloned downstream of Xba-digested pCDNA 3.1+ (Invitrogen) plasmid containing two copies of the FLAG epitope sequence upstream of a second SREBP coding sequence, as described previously (5Toth J.I. Datta S. Athanikar J.N. Freedman L.P. Osborne T.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8288-8300Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The other tethered SREBP dimer fusions were constructed similarly. SREBP-1a/1c and SREBP-1c/1a represent both orientations of the SREBP-1a and -1c heterodimer, with SREBP-1a at the amino or carboxyl terminus, respectively. The other heterodimers were constructed similarly in both orientations.Fig. 4Activation of SREBP target genes by SREBP monomers versus tethered homodimers.

We were limited because there are no antibodies that distinguish SREBP-1a from -1c. Therefore, we fused the coding sequence for each SREBP (Fig. 1A) separately to either the FLAG epitope or GFP. These expression constructs were transfected into cells alone or in combination, and cell extracts were analyzed by IP with an antibody to the FLAG peptide. The precipitated material was analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies to either FLAG or GFP to test for co-precipitation. Control experiments show that the FLAG antibody did not directly precipitate GFP (Fig. 1B, lanes 1–4). The three SREBPs were capable of forming both homodimers and all three heterodimers by this analysis (Fig. 1B, lanes 5–16). Because mRNAs for all three SREBPs are co-expressed in most cells and form homo- and heterodimers (Fig. 1), it is highly likely that all possible homo- and heterodimeric molecules contribute to SREBP activity. Thus, an important goal is to measure the different activity mediated by each specific homo- or heterodimeric combination. However, this cannot accurately be accomplished when monomeric expression constructs are co-expressed because the individual protein molecules can associate in trans. To circumvent this problem, we constructed a series of expression constructs containing two individual SREBP coding regions linked through a flexible polypeptide tether similar to previous analyses of other dimeric transcription factors (14Neuhold L.A. Wold B. Cell. 1993; 74: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 18Bakiri L. Matsuo K. Wisniewska M. Wagner E.F. Yaniv M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4952-4964Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). We also utilized an additional mutant form of SREBP-1 that lacks the entire amino-terminal activation domain (Fig. 1A, M1). All possible combinations were made in both orientations. All 12 tethered SREBPs were expressed with their predicted molecular weights and at similar levels relative to each other and to the corresponding monomeric SREBPs that were translated in vitro (Fig. 2B). Additionally, in vitro translated tethered SREBPs all bound to an SREBP DNA binding site in an EMSA similarly to SREBPs expressed from monomeric constructs (Fig. 2A). We next confirmed that the tethered constructs preferentially form intramolecular dimers. We reasoned that activation by an intramolecular-tethered SREBP dimer should be relatively resistant to inhibition by dominant negative A-SREBP-1 expressed in trans. A-SREBP-1 has strategically substituted acidic amino acids in the basic region of the bHLH domain and forms homo- and heterodimers with SREBPs, but the resulting complex cannot bind DNA (13Rishi V.

When the A-SREBP-1 expression construct was co-expressed at one, two, or four times the molar levels relative to either monomeric or tethered homodimer SREBP-1a, the A-SREBP-1 inhibited activity of the monomeric SREBP-1a in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3, lanes 1–4). However, activation by the tethered dimer was significantly more resistant to challenge by A-SREBP-1 (Fig. 3, lanes 5–8). Next, we performed an extensive analysis of how individual tethered dimers activate promoters for four key genes of cholesterol uptake and biosynthesis as well as fatty acid metabolism. These include the LDL receptor, HMG-CoA reductase (Red), squalene synthase (SQS), and fatty-acid synthase (FAS). First, we compared the level of activation mediated by the monomeric or tethered homodimer versions of the SREBP isoforms. The respective promoters fused to luciferase were cotransfected into cells along with amounts of expression constructs for the individual SREBP monomers or tethered SREBP homodimers to yield equal molar amounts of SREBP dimer (Fig. 4). Importantly, the relative level of activity for all tethered SREBP homodimers was similar to the corresponding monomeric expression constructs where activation by both SREBP-1a and -2 is robust compared with the weak activity of SREBP-1c (5Toth J.I.

Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 99: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). In previous studies, SREBP-2 preferentially activated the Red and SQS promoters relative to SREBP-1a (20Pai J. Guryev O. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol.

When protein expression was monitored in the transfected cells, the monomeric and tethered homodimer constructs migrated through SDS-PAGE with their predicted molecular weights; they were all expressed at similar levels as detected by immunoblotting with an antibody to the FLAG epitope tag, which is present in all constructs (Fig. 4E). Taken together, these results suggest that the tethered dimers fold properly and function similar to their non-tethered counterparts. The monomeric and tethered dimer versions of SREBP-2 activated all four promoters equivalently (Fig. 4). Both versions of SREBP-1a activated the FAS promoter similarly as well (Fig. 4D). However, monomeric SREBP-1a activated the LDL, Red, and SQS promoters to about a 2-fold higher level than the respective tethered homodimers. The tethered SREBP-1c homodimer activated all four promoters to a lower level than the monomerically expressed protein. However, this lower level was less notable for the LDL receptor promoter. The higher degree of activation by the SREBP-1c monomer versus the tethered dimer form suggests the monomer may heterodimerize with an endogenous protein to activate gene expression. Similar results were obtained when the different expression constructs were varied over a range of concentrations. 2S. Datta and T. Osborne, unpublished observations. We next used the tethered dimer constructs to compare the expression and activity of the different SREBP homo- and heterodimer combinations. Similar to the tethered homodimer constructs, all of the tethered heterodimer constructs contain a FLAG epitope tag; when their expression was analyzed by a similar immunoblotting protocol, they were all expressed at similar levels, and they migrated through SDS-PAGE with their predicted molecular weights (Fig. 5D). When activation of all four promoters by the tethered SREBP-1a/1c heterodimers was evaluated, they all activated transcription to intermediate levels relative to the respective homodimers (Figs. 5, 6, 7, 8). This same pattern was observed when SREBP-2 was combined with SREBP-1c. In contrast, tethered SREBP-1a/2 heterodimers activated LDL, FAS, and SQS promoters similarly to the corresponding homodimers or to a robust level that was intermediate between the two homodimeric constructs for Red. Tethering SREBP-1a or -2 with SREBP-1c resulted in a decrea"

One of the better characterized peptidic ligands is the chemotactic cytokine complement factor 5a (C5a), a 74-amino acid helical bundle. Previous studies showed 6-mer peptide analogs derived from the C terminus of the C5a ligand can bind to C5aR (Kd values ∼0.1–1 μm) and either agonize or antagonize the receptor (Gerber, B. O., Meng, E. C., Dotsch, V., Baranski, T. J., and Bourne, H. R. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 3394–3400). Here, we provide direct biochemical data using disulfide trapping to support a model that these peptides bind within a transmembrane helical triad formed by α-helices III, VI, and VII. We show that the three amino acids on the C terminus of the peptide analogs bind too weakly to exert a functional effect themselves. However, when a cysteine residue is placed on their N terminus they can be trapped by disulfide interchange to specific cysteines in helix III and VI and not to other cysteines, engineered into the C5aR. The trapped peptides function as agonists or partial antagonists, similar to the non-covalent parents from which they were derived. These data help to further refine the binding mode for C5a to the C5aR and suggest an approach and a binding site that may be applicable to studying other peptide binding receptors.

Despite this diversity, the receptors may be activated by a common triggering mechanism located in the transmembrane region (2Gether U. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol.

Even for peptidic chemokines and cytokines data suggest part of the binding and activation mechanism is contained in the transmembrane domain of the receptor (16Kohl J. Mol.

For example, a six-amino acid peptide (Cha-Cha, Table I) derived from the C terminus of the C5a cytokine can bind and fully activate the C5aR (10DeMartino J.A. Van Riper G. Siciliano S.J.

Slight alterations in the residue at position 5 of these peptides (Cha to Trp) results in a peptide (Cha-Trp) that retains binding but is converted to a partial antagonist. Based on these studies and mutational data it was proposed that the peptides occupy a site formed by helices III, V, VI, and VII.Table ISequences of parent 6-mer peptides (Cha-Cha and Cha-Trp) and truncated cysteine-containing 3-mer peptides (Cys-Cha and Cys-Trp) used in the following studies To further evaluate the binding hypothesis for these peptides we employed a disulfide trapping approach. Deletion of the first three amino acids from the 6-mer peptides dramatically reduced their binding affinity and retained the penultimate residue that switched the 6-mers from agonists to partial antagonists. Cysteines were appended to the N terminus of these 3-mers and then allowed to undergo thiol-disulfide interchange with different cysteines designed into helices II, III, and VI of the C5aR. The peptides could be captured from the designed cysteines that were most consistent with the previously proposed binding model. The trapped 3-mer peptides exerted the same agonist or partial agonist effects as the non-covalent parents from which they were derived, and their effects were fully reversed by reduction of the disulfide bond. Tethered peptides derived from the protein ligand provide orthogonal support for this binding model and may be generally useful for localizing ligand binding sites and activation switches in other peptide binding receptors. Materials—Human recombinant C5a was from Sigma. 125I-Labeled C5a and myo-[3H]inositol were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All peptides were from the Tufts University Core Facility. Transfection of COS-7 Cells—COS-7 cells were transfected with a plasmid carrying the cDNA for C5aR using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. COS-7 cells were cultured to 80% confluence prior to transfection and harvested 2 days (for IP3 accumulation) or 3 days (for preparation of membranes) post-transfection. Preparation of Membranes from COS-7 Cells—Cells were resuspended into hypotonic lysis buffer and lysed by passage through a 22-gauge needle. Cell lysate was layered on a sucrose cushion and centrifuged at 45,000 rpm for 1 h at 4. Membrane pellets were resuspended into hypotonic lysis buffer, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. 125I-C5a Binding—COS-7 cell membranes were incubated with C5a ligand, peptides, or small molecule compounds in buffer (20 mm Hepes pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 100 μm Pefabloc, 0.1% bacitracin, 0.5% bovine serum albumin) along with 0.1 nm 125I-C5a for 3 h at room temperature. Binding reactions were then filtered over Millipore Multiscreen 0.22-μm filters, and filters were washed three times with ice-cold binding buffer. Optiphase liquid scintillant was added directly to the filters, and counts were measured in a Wallac microbeta plate reader. IP3 Accumulation—COS-7 cells are cultured and co-transfected with Gα16 and C5aR in 24-well culture dishes. 24 h post-transfection cell monolayers were washed 1× with PBS and growth medium was exchanged with inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 100 μm myo-[3H]inositol. Cells were assayed for IP3 accumulation 24 h post-labeling as described previously (11Gerber B.O. Meng E.C. Dotsch V. Baranski T.J. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3394-3400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Previous studies with hexapeptides, Cha-Cha and Cha-Trp (Table I), had indicated that the first three amino acid residues, especially the Phe at position 1, were important for receptor binding affinity (23Taylor S.M. Sherman S.A. Kirnarsky L. Sanderson S.D. Curr. Med. Chem. 2001; 8: 675-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Truncated versions of the agonist (Cha-Cha) and antagonist (Cha-Trp) hexapeptides were prepared that contained cysteines at their N termini (Table I). We reasoned that truncating the first three residues of the hexapeptides would reduce binding affinity but retain some of the crucial determinants, including the penultimate residue, for receptor activation. The corresponding 3-mer peptides would likely not possess sufficient affinity to bind on their own; however, if a cysteine were appended to their N termini (Cys-Cha and Cys-Trp (Table I)) their low intrinsic affinity could be stabilized by specific cysteines engineered into the receptor and the truncated peptides could be trapped in the receptor binding site. A proposed computational model of the Cha-Trp antagonist hexapeptide in complex with a rhodopsin-based homology model of the C5a receptor guided our selection of receptor sites that might serve as cysteine anchors for the Cys peptides, Fig. 1A (11Gerber B.O.

Cysteines were introduced at four positions of C5aR: G262C on helix VI, P113C and L117C on helix III, and F93C on helix II (Fig. 1, B and C). Mutagenesis studies have shown these are not directly involved in ligand binding (5Baranski T.J. Herzmark P. Lichtarge O. Gerber B.O. Trueheart J. Meng E.C. Iiri T. Sheikh S.P. Bourne H.R. J. Biol.

Assuming the actual binding configuration of the dCha-Cha-dArg peptide is the same as that predicted by the model it would be possible to form a disulfide with the N-terminal cysteine on the peptides (Cys-Cha and Cys-Trp) to cysteines engineered at residues 262, 113, and 117 but not 93 of the receptor. All cysteine mutant forms of the receptor had binding affinities and efficacies for C5a and the Cha-Cha hexapeptide that were similar to that observed for the wild type receptor (Table II). As expected the hexapeptide Cha-Cha inhibited C5a binding to wild type with an IC50 value of ∼235 nm, whereas the truncated cysteine-containing Cys-Cha and Cys-Trp peptides had little effect (Fig. 2A). Similar results were seen for the F93C receptor variant (Fig. 2B). However, when a cysteine anchor is introduced at position 262, the apparent affinities for both Cys-Cha and Cys-Trp were dramatically enhanced (Fig. 2C); both ligands could block binding of 125I-C5a with apparent IC50 values of 8 and 33 μm, respectively. A similar result was obtained for the cysteine engineered at the 113 position (Fig. 2D). The effect of the Cys-Cha peptide on L117C, located one helical turn below P113C (Fig. 1C), was severalfold weaker, 45 μm (Fig. 2E). The differential effects observed are consistent with the model and reflect a fairly narrow window for proper binding of the peptides.Table IISummary of the apparent binding affinities and receptor activation for the C5a ligand and Cha-Cha peptide with the wild-type and cysteine-mutant forms (G262C, P113C, L117C, and F93C) of the C5aRIC50C5a bindingChaCha bindingC5a activation, EC50nmnmWild type0.252350.8G262C0.151132.5P113C0.482631.5L117C0.25151NDF93C0.18482ND Open table in a new tab To test the reversibility of these effects we reacted both the G262C and P113C mutants with the Cys peptides in the presence of increasing concentrations of the reducing agent β-ME (Fig. 3). The inhibition of ligand binding by the Cys peptides could be fully reversed by β-ME and supports that these peptides are exerting their effects via specific disulfide bonds with the engineered cysteines. The non-covalent 6-mer Cha-Cha peptide (Table I) can fully active the receptor as measured by IP3 accumulation in COS-7 cells transfected with the C5aR (11Gerber B.O. Meng E.C. Dotsch V. Baranski T.J. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3394-3400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Here, the truncated Cys-Cha peptide was seen to activate the G262C and P113C variants (EC50 values of 284 and 265 μm, respectively) and do so much more effectively than it can activate the wild-type receptor. This is consistent with the tighter binding affinity provided by forming the disulfide bond. The activation by Cys-Cha on the G262C variant was fully reversible with β-ME (Fig. 4B). Whereas β-ME could reverse the effects of the Cys-Cha peptide on the G262C variant, it had no effect on the basal or C5a-stimulated activity of this mutant (data not shown). Substitution of the penultimate residue Cha for Trp in the 6-mer peptide reverts it to a partial agonist (12Meng E.C. Bourne H.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 587-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Although the truncated Cys-Trp peptide had no measurable effect on either basal or ligand activated receptor activity for the wild-type receptor or the G262C mutant, it behaved as a partial agonist for the P113C mutant form (Fig. 4C). This differential effect of Cys-Trp on G262C and P113C is likely the result of its 4-fold weaker binding affinity for the G262C mutant (Fig. 2, C and D). Cys-Trp could only stimulate P113C to ∼30% of C5a stimulation with an EC50 of 154 μm, and it inhibited C5a-stimulated activity with an IC50 of 159 μm, indicating that it behaves as a partial antagonist (Fig. 4D). The refractory nature of GPCRs to direct structural analysis has restricted our ability to probe the regulatory mechanism(s) for these receptors. This is especially apparent for the peptide-ligand class of GPCRs where ligand interactions that evoke receptor activation have only begun to be described. Mutational studies provide important insights into residues that are critical for binding and activation of the receptor (4Gether U. Endocr.

Chem. 2001; 8: 675-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We believe that ligand disulfide trapping provides an orthogonal approach that can tie these two databases together. Like mutagenesis it localizes the functional effects but does so within the context of known ligands and their SARs. The key tools to facilitate this approach are weak binding cysteine-containing ligands, whose binding and functional effects are dependent upon the introduction of specific cysteine anchors. This provides the crucial controls to ensure selectivity. For example, the truncated 3-mer peptides do not bind tightly or affect the function of the wild-type receptor but only exert their effects in the context of specific cysteine mutants, where the disulfide functions to stabilize the low intrinsic affinity of the peptide. Even within the cysteine mutants there was a functional gradient in the ability of these to be affected by the cysteine-containing peptides in the following order: P113C > G262C > L117C » F93C and wild-type. This was remarkably consistent with the previously reported model of the C5aR-peptide complex (11Gerber B.O. Meng E.C. Dotsch V. Baranski T.J. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3394-3400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The model predicts that the cysteine from the peptide can be modeled closest to P113C and G262C. In the presence of a redox buffer, the process of disulfide exchange is an equilibrium process in which specific non-covalent interactions place the ligand in proximity to form the disulfide. In the absence of intrinsic binding affinity the ligands cannot be trapped because they are readily reduced by the redox buffer. This is the basis for Tethering®, a fragment-based ligand discovery tool that has been extensively used for discovering nucleating small ligands to nucleate the drug discovery process (for review, see Ref. 27Erlanson D.A. Wells J.A. Braisted A.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2004; 33: 199-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Numerous small molecule ligands have been captured by Tethering, and the structures of the covalent and non-covalent counterparts seen by x-ray crystallography are virtually identical, suggesting the disulfide does not distort the binding of the Tethered verus free compound (28Erlanson D.A. Braisted A.C. Raphael D.R. Randal M. Stroud R.M. Gordon E.M. Wells J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9367-9372Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 29Thanos C.D. Randal M.

McDowell R.S. Hansen S.K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 730-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). A final advantage of the disulfide is that unlike mutagenesis, it is a reversible event, ruling out the possibility that the ligands exert their effects by nonspecific means. The fact that the trapped peptides exhibited agonist or partial antagonistic effects, like the non-covalent parents they were derived from, provided important support that they are trapped in a manner that truly reflects the non-covalent mode of binding. Interaction between three amino acids of this peptide and the helical III-VI-VII triad are sufficient for maximal receptor activation. Ligand interactions with this helical triad likely trigger a conformational change that translates to receptor activation. This may involve the release of a transmembrane constraint, allowing the receptor to adopt its active conformation, as has been proposed for other members of the GPCR family (4Gether U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Another site-directed method has been recently described using engineered metal binding sites to identify novel metal chelate structures which can bind and activate GPCRs (31Elling C.E. Thirstrup K.

We believe ligand disulfide trapping provides an important, complementary, and orthogonal approach to localizing ligand binding sites in proteins. Combining this information with mutational and ligand SARs can provide strong support for computational models for ligand binding sites. Ligand trapping methods can have a special impact on membrane proteins of pharmaceutical interest where there is often a mutational and small molecule data base but no available structure. Other chemokine and cytokine receptors may be amenable to this approach. Such ligand disulfide-trapped complexes may even facilitate crystallography because they are likely to be more stable and can be generated in dilute solutions as covalent stoichiometric complexes prior to concentration and crystallization."
https://openalex.org/W2006122036,"CCN2/CTGF is a multifunctional growth factor. Our previous studies have revealed that CCN2 plays important roles in both growth and differentiation of chondrocytes and that the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of ccn2 mRNA contains a cis-repressive element of gene expression. In the present study, we found that the stability of chicken ccn2 mRNA is regulated in a differentiation stage-dependent manner in chondrocytes. We also found that stimulation by bone morphogenetic protein 2, platelet-derived growth factor, and CCN2 stabilized ccn2 mRNA in proliferating chondrocytes but that it destabilized the mRNA in prehypertrophic-hypertrophic chondrocytes. The results of a reporter gene assay revealed that the minimal repressive cis-element of the 3′-UTR of chicken ccn2 mRNA was located within the area between 100 and 150 bases from the polyadenylation tail. Moreover, the stability of ccn2 mRNA was correlated with the interaction between this cis-element and a putative 40-kDa trans-factor in nuclei and cytoplasm. In fact, the binding between them was prominent in proliferating chondrocytes and attenuated in (pre)hypertrophic chondrocytes. Stimulation by the growth factors repressed the binding in proliferating chondrocytes; however, it enhanced it in (pre)hypertrophic chondrocytes. Therefore, gene expression of ccn2 mRNA during endochondral ossification is properly regulated, at least in part, by changing the stability of the mRNA, which arises from the interaction between the RNA cis-element and putative trans-factor."

While primary sequence among the family members shows a considerable degree of sequence variation, the vast majority of IF proteins show conservation of a predicted domain structure. This structure consists of a central rod domain whose predicted secondary structure is well conserved, and head and tail domains, where both size and primary sequence, are more variable. While the predicted secondary structure of the central rod domain is conserved, there is much primary sequence variability except at two small motifs located at either end of the central rod domain. At these sites, sequence conservation has been quite strong. These two motifs have been referred to as the “rod initiation” and “rod termination” motifs.

Cell. 1991; 64: 365-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) working in cell culture and mouse systems showed that cytokeratin mutations gave rise to EBS-like defects in mice. Second, genetic linkage analysis in humans indicated that keratin genes were involved in skin blistering diseases (1Bonifas J.M. Rothman A.L. Epstein Jr., E.H. Science. 1991; 254: 1202-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Third, keratin mutants were identified on the basis of abnormal antibody binding, caused by changes in the primary sequence of epidermal IF protein (13Lane E.B. Rugg E.L. Navsaria H. Leigh I.M.

Subsequent characterization of additional EBS cases revealed a hotspot for mutations at the conserved motif LNDR, located at the beginning of the central rod domain. Commonly, a point mutation in the IF gene led to an Arg → His (12Syder A.J. Yu Q.C. Paller A.S. Giudice G. Pearson R. Fuchs E. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1533-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) or Arg → Cys mutation in this motif (12Syder A.J. Yu Q.C. Paller A.S. Giudice G. Pearson R. Fuchs E. J. Clin.

Subsequently, mutations in the cornea-specific keratins K3 and K12 at the same LNDR sequence were shown to segregate with a corneal dystrophy phenotype (22Nishida K. Honma Y. Dota A. Kawasaki S.

Ophthalmol. 1999; 10: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Most recently, the same region in GFAP has been shown to be the site of mutations leading to the neurodegenerative Alexander disease (25Rodriguez D. Gauthier F. Bertini E. Bugiani M. Brenner M. N′Guyen S. Goizet C. Gelot A. Surtees R. Pedespan J.M. Hernandorena X. Troncoso M. Uziel G. Messing A. Ponsot G. Pham-Dinh D. Dautigny A. Boespflug-Tanguy O. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 69: 1134-1140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus, the fourth residue of this LNDR motif appears to be of critical importance to several IF proteins, from multiple classes of IF. The mechanism of these genetic mutations seems clear. Alteration of the arginine codon (CGN) is consistent with the hypothesis that CpG dinucleotides are sites of methylation-induced deamidation of cytosine, leading to a Cys → Thr transition (CGY → TGY cysteine codon) (26Cooper D.N. Youssoufian H. Hum. Genet. 1988; 78: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). However, the structural impact of this Arg → Cys substitution on IF assembly and structure remains poorly defined, as IF proteins and IFs have not been crystallized. Whether the result of in vitro mutagenesis or random chance, mutations in keratin genes typically have been studied in vitro by 1) analysis of the assembly characteristics of the mutant proteins and 2) the ability of the mutant proteins to assemble into intermediate filament networks in transfected cells. In general, there is a good correlation between the severity of skin blistering seen in a clinically affected individual and the magnitude of assembly abnormalities seen when the mutant protein is analyzed in vitro (19Letai A. Coulombe P.A. McCormick M.B. Yu Q.C. Hutton E. Fuchs E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3197-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Thus, mutants that fail to form filaments in vitro and fail to integrate into cellular IF networks in cell culture produce the worst cases of skin blistering. Analysis of the effect of specific mutations on keratin assembly has been described by Steinert and co-workers (27Mehrani T. Wu K.C. Morasso M.I. Bryan J.T. Marekov L.N. Parry D.A. Steinert P.M. J.

Cell. 2000; 11: 3539-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) who designed an experimental protocol based on the cross linking between proteins at different urea concentrations. Cross-linking between proteins reflects the proximity of the cross linking moieties and thus can be used to establish whether normal interactions have/have not occurred during assembly. Specifically, comparison of cross-links in mutant proteins to those formed in wild type proteins can be used to infer whether distances between cross-linking moieties have changed as a result of the mutation. Since IF proteins will undergo stepwise assembly when dialyzed out of high concentrations of urea or guanidine, these cross-linking studies can be performed on intermediates of assembly, providing data relevant to the stage of assembly affected by the mutation (29Wawersik M. Paladini R.D. Noensie E. Coulombe P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32557-32565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Mehrani et al. (27Mehrani T. Wu K.C. Morasso M.I.

Chem. 2001; 276: 2088-2097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) showed specifically that K14 LNDR mutated to LNDL was unable to form IFs, unable to assemble into existing IF networks in cells, and was significantly altered in the tetramer configuration. Lys14 LNAR was similarly unable to form filaments in vitro and unable to integrate into IF networks but exhibited slightly less stability than the wild type. They summarize the characterization of these substitutions in the Asp and Arg locations of LNDR as significantly destabilizing the two-molecule entities (tetramer). Following the demonstration of the applicability of site-directed spin labeling electron paramagnetic resonance (SDSL EPR) to the study IF structure (30Hess J.F. Budamagunta M.S. Voss J.C. FitzGerald P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44841-44846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 31Hess J.F. Voss J.C. FitzGerald P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35516-35522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we began a series of experiments designed to test the hypothesis that EPR can be used to identify the effects of mutations on IF assembly. To perform these experiments, EBS-like mutations (LNDR → LNDS and NDR → LNDC) were engineered into human vimentin (1Bonifas J.M. Rothman A.L. Epstein Jr., E.H. Science. 1991; 254: 1202-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). In vitro assembly verifies that assembly is aborted very early in the process with both mutants failing to assemble into 10-nm filaments. Because the spin labeling protocol that we employ targets cysteine residues, we have used a vimentin LNDR → LNDS mutant to study the impact of mutations at this site on assembly. In previous work we have identified specific “reporter” residues within vimentin that, when spin-labeled, reveal whether specific stages of assembly have occurred and when in the course of assembly they occur. We can therefore discriminate between mutations that affect initial coiled coil dimer formation, or subsequent dimer-dimer interactions. Using this approach we report the impact of EBS-like mutations on the assembly of the Type III IF protein vimentin. Vimentin characterization, mutation, cloning, expression, purification, and spin labeling were described in detail in a previous reports (30Hess J.F. Budamagunta M.S. Voss J.C. FitzGerald P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44841-44846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 31Hess J.F. Voss J.C. FitzGerald P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35516-35522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In brief, the spin label is ultimately attached to cysteine residues that are targeted to specific sites in vimentin. Cysteine codons were introduced into the vimentin expression construct (generously provided by Dr. Roy Quinlan, University of Durham, Durham, UK) using the Stratagene QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Combinations of mutations (for example, Ser113 plus Cys191) were created, where possible, by cloning of restriction fragments, each containing one mutation, together into an expression vector. If not possible, then mutagenesis was performed in a sequential fashion. Sequence changes were verified by DNA sequencing. Mutant vimentin was produced by bacterial expression and purified from inclusion bodies using high/low salt washes, and chromatography. Spin labeling was accomplished by incubation of the purified vimentin in 100 μm tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) followed by 500 μm O-87500 (Toronto Research Chemicals, Toronto, Canada). Unincorporated spin label was removed by CM-Sepharose chromatography using a GE Healthcare FPLC (30Hess J.F. Budamagunta M.S. Voss J.C. FitzGerald P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44841-44846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 31Hess J.F. Voss J.C. FitzGerald P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35516-35522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Labeled proteins were stored long term at -80 °C. Filament assembly was performed either as a single step dialysis against filament assembly buffer or as a stepwise process following the protocol of Carter et al. (32Carter J.M. Hutcheson A.M. Quinlan R.A. Exp. Eye Res. 1995; 60: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) Briefly, labeled proteins were solubilized in 8 m urea, which was then removed by dialysis, either in a single step procedure, or where indicated, in a stepwise process through progressively reduced concentrations of urea, followed by low ionic strength Tris, followed by the addition of NaCl and MgCl2. Filament assembly was verified by electron microscopy of negatively stained samples. EPR was conducted on a JEOL X-band spectrometer equipped with a loop gap resonator. Approximately 4 μl of sample, at a concentration of 25–75 μm protein, were placed in a sealed quartz capillary tube. Spectra were acquired at 20–22 °C with a single 60-s scan over 100 G at a microwave power of 2 milliwatts and a modulation amplitude optimized to the natural line width of the attached nitroxide. Electron microscopy cysteine-free vimentin (Cys328 → Ser) used as a starting point for subsequent studies shows long uniform filaments, which are morphologically indistinguishable from wild type vimentin (Fig. 1A). In contrast, vimentin bearing the LNDR → LNDS mutation failed to form recognizable filaments (Fig. 1B). In these preparations, assembly was aborted at a very early stage, yielding uniformly small “rodlets.” Vimentin bearing the LNDC mutation similarly caused a very early failure in the assembly process, yielding aggregates of small particles (not shown). We then used site-directed spin labeling followed by EPR spectroscopy to examine the structural and assembly consequences of the R113S (LNDR to LNDS) mutation (Fig. 2). We have previously shown that SDSL EPR yields structural information at several levels in intact IFs, as well as in assembly intermediates that form during in vitro assembly. Depending on the specific site that is labeled, EPR can monitor the assumption of α helical structure, the formation of coiled coil dimers, and the formation of subsequent higher order interactions between dimers, either in intact filaments or at specific stages during in vitro assembly that occur as filament protein is dialyzed out of 8 m urea. We approached this by creating the R113S mutation and then placing spin labels at different locations within the mutant protein to monitor the impact that this mutation produced at the spin labeled site (a schematic indicating the relative locations of these mutants is presented in Fig. 3).Fig. 3Schematic of vimentin predicted domain structure and spin label placement.

Spin labels at these sites provide data about 1) secondary structure (α helix formation) and 2) coiled coil formation, since these two residues would be within 2 nm of each other in a coiled coil dimer. As demonstrated previously (30Hess J.F. Budamagunta M.S. Voss J.C. FitzGerald P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44841-44846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 31Hess J.F.

Chem. 2002; 277: 35516-35522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), a,d positions within a coiled coil generate a characteristic immobilized and dipolar-broadened spectrum when the urea concentration is lowered to 2 m. In the wild type vimentin, a tightly packed environment at position 178 (rod 1) occurs earlier and is almost completely achieved at 4 m urea, whereas a strongly broadened spectrum from position 333 (rod 2) is not achieved until 2 m urea (Fig. 2a). The magnified spectra for spin labeled 178 and 333 at 2 m urea are shown in Fig. 2c. This observation suggests that in wild type vimentin, coiled coil formation occurs more readily in rod domain 1B in the region surrounding position 178 than in rod domain 2 near position 333. We then repeated these studies but now using vimentin bearing the R113S mutation. In the presence of the R113S mutation, position 178 remains flexible at 4 m urea (Fig. 2b), indicating the LNDS mutation causes a slight perturbation in coiled coil formation in rod 1B. In contrast, the increased broadening at position 333 in rod 2 occurs just as readily in the LNDS mutant as it does in vimentin that contains the wild type Arg113 (Fig. 2b). This suggests that the presence of the mutation at residue 113 (rod domain 1) has little impact on the formation of the coiled coil dimer in rod domain 2 but does affect the ability of rod domain 1 to undergo normal α helical coiled coil assembly. To further investigate the impact of this mutation on early assembly, we placed a spin label closer to the LNDR motif at position 131. Position 131 is predicted to be a (d) position at the end of rod 1A. As shown in Fig. 2A, vimentin with a label located at 131 does not display the characteristic broad spectrum of an a/d position (see “Discussion”). A slight effect of the LNDS mutation is observed at position 131. As shown in Fig. 2C, the spectrum of spin-labeled 131 in 2 m urea is somewhat sharper, suggesting that the R113S mutation may impart further destabilization to this region of the protein. We have shown in previous work that residues 191 (rod 1) and 348 (rod), both of which are non a,d, positions and therefore on the outside of the coiled coil dimer (see Fig. 3), can be used to monitor the formation of interactions between vimentin dimers during filament assembly studies (30Hess J.F. Budamagunta M.S. Voss J.C. FitzGerald P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44841-44846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 31Hess J.F. Voss J.C. FitzGerald P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35516-35522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These studies established that dimers interact at residue 191 (rod domain 1) before interactions occur at residue 348 (rod domain 2) thus establishing a sequence of dimer-dimer interactions during in vitro assembly. To evaluate the impact of the R113S mutation on these interactions, we spin-labeled proteins individually at both 191 and 348. Examination of mutant protein labeled at residue 348 (an e position in rod 2) shows that, in the range of 6–3 m urea, the R113S mutant behaves similarly to the wild type protein (Fig. 2, A versus B). This is consistent with the data derived from mutants labeled at residue 333, indicating normal secondary structure in rod domain 2. However, as described below, the R113S mutation produces a loss of the dipolar broadening of spin label placed at residue 348 that arises at 2 m urea in wild type protein. This suggests that the approximation of two dimers centered around residue 348 fails to occur in a normal manner. While the LNDS mutation causes a small fraction of the spin labels at 191 to remain highly mobile at low urea levels, the level of dipolar broadening compared with protein with native Arg113 is unchanged, indicating that a magnetic interaction occurs between labels located at 191, as R113S vimentin dimers assemble into higher ordered structures. Thus the A11 alignment, as measured by dipolar interaction at 191, is not detectably perturbed by the R113S mutation. In contrast, evidence for A22 alignment, as reported by labels placed at position 348, is completely eliminated in vimentin containing the R113S mutation. This difference is highlighted in Fig. 2C, where the normalized 2 m urea spectra of spin-labeled 348 with and without the LNDS mutations are compared. From this we conclude that the R113S mutation permits the formation of coiled coil dimers in rod 2 but that the mutation has a demonstrable impact on the dimer-dimer interactions that should occur in rod 2. The helix initiation and termination motifs of IF proteins have proven to be “hotspots” for mutations that result in a disease phenotype. In the helix initiation motif (LNDR) a frequent cause of disease is mutation of the Arg residue, commonly to a Cys or His. Mutation of this site has proven causative for human diseases in the Type I cytokeratins (e.g. skin blistering and corneal dystrophies) but also in the Type III IF protein GFAP as well (1Bonifas J.M.

Thus this specific site appears to be critical to normal assembly in multiple IF proteins from more than one class, suggesting that the data derived from study of this mutation may be broadly applicable. An interesting side note is that the lens-specific intermediate filament protein, CP49, shows striking divergence at this motif (LGGC) that includes a Cys in the fourth position (LGGC) (34Hess J.F.

While the exact nucleic acid changes resulting in these diseases have been identified, the impact of each mutation on assembly, structure, and function of the IFs has proven far more difficult to define. This difficulty largely derives from the inability to develop crystals of intact IF proteins or of intact IFs. While progress has been made in determining crystal structure of fragments of the IF protein vimentin (36Strelkov S.V. Herrmann H. Geisler N. Lustig A. Ivaninskii S. Zimbelmann R. Burkhard P. Aebi U.

https://openalex.org/W2118496947,"Inhibition of cAMP-dependent stimulation of the vectorial fluid transport across the lung epithelium following hemorrhagic shock is mediated by NO released within the airspaces of the lung. We tested here the hypothesis that prior induction of HO-1 would attenuate the release of NO in the airspaces, thus preventing the inhibition of the c-AMP stimulation of alveolar fluid clearance (ALC) in rats. Indeed, HO-1 induction restored the cAMP-mediated up-regulation of ALC after hemorrhage by decreasing NO released within the airspaces of the lung. In vitro studies demonstrated that HO-1 induction significantly reduced the iNOS-mediated release of NO by alveolar macrophages stimulated with endotoxin for 24 h. This effect is explained in part by a HO-1-dependent attenuation of the LPS-mediated nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. In addition, HO-1 induction also significantly reduced the iNOS-mediated release of NO by MH-S cells that were stimulated with interferon-gamma by decreasing the phosphorylation of STAT 1, another transcription factor important for the activation of the iNOS promoter. In contrast, HO-1 induction did not affect the production of NO by rat alveolar epithelial type II cells that were stimulated with cytomix (a mixture of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IFN-gamma) for 24 h. In summary, these results provide the first in vivo evidence that the induction of HO-1 in the lung restores a normal fluid transport capacity of the alveolar epithelium following hemorrhagic shock by inhibiting the iNOS-mediated release of NO by alveolar macrophages."
