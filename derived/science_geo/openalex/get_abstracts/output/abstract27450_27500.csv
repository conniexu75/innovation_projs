https://openalex.org/W2090025028,"Mutations of the p53 gene occur commonly in colorectal carcinomas and the wild-type p53 allele is often concomitantly deleted. These findings suggest that the wild-type gene may act as a suppressor of colorectal carcinoma cell growth. To test this hypothesis, wild-type or mutant human p53 genes were transfected into human colorectal carcinoma cell lines. Cells transfected with the wild-type gene formed colonies five- to tenfold less efficiently than those transfected with a mutant p53 gene. In those colonies that did form after wild-type gene transfection, the p53 sequences were found to be deleted or rearranged, or both, and no exogenous p53 messenger RNA expression was observed. In contrast, transfection with the wild-type gene had no apparent effect on the growth of epithelial cells derived from a benign colorectal tumor that had only wild-type p53 alleles. Immunocytochemical techniques demonstrated that carcinoma cells expressing the wild-type gene did not progress through the cell cycle, as evidenced by their failure to incorporate thymidine into DNA. These studies show that the wild-type gene can specifically suppress the growth of human colorectal carcinoma cells in vitro and that an in vivo-derived mutation resulting in a single conservative amino acid substitution in the p53 gene product abrogates this suppressive ability."
https://openalex.org/W1996427305,"Libraries of random peptide sequences were constructed and screened to identify peptides that specifically bind to proteins. In one of these about 2 X 10(7) different 15-residue peptide sequences were expressed on the surface of the coliphage M13. Each phage encoded a single random sequence and expressed it as a fusion complex with pIII, a minor coat protein present at five molecules per phage. Phage encoding nine different streptavidin-binding peptide sequences were isolated from this library. The core consensus sequence was His-Pro-Gln and binding of these phage to streptavidin was inhibited by biotin. This type of library makes it possible to identify peptides that bind to proteins (or other macromolecules) that have no previously known affinity for peptides."
https://openalex.org/W2128060680,"Mutant p53 can contribute to transformation, while wild-type (wt) p53 is not oncogenic and actually inhibits transformation. Furthermore, wt p53 may act as a suppressor gene in human carcinogenesis. We now describe the temperature-sensitive behavior of a particular mutant, p53val135. Like other p53 mutants, it can elicit transformation at 37.5 degrees C. However, at 32.5 degrees C it suppresses transformation, behaving like authentic wt p53. Moreover, the proliferation of transformed cells expressing p53val135 is dramatically inhibited at the permissive temperature. Significantly, the inhibition of both transformation and proliferation is reversible upon temperature upshift. These data demonstrate that the ability of wt p53 to suppress transformation is not due to a general lethal effect, but rather to a reversible growth arrest. p53val135 may prove instrumental for gaining insight into the cellular and molecular properties of wt p53."
https://openalex.org/W1973122477,"The S. cerevisiae CLN genes encode cyclin homologs essential for progression from G1 to S phase. The CLN2 gene encodes a 62 kd polypeptide that accumulates periodically, peaking during G1 and decreasing rapidly thereafter, and is rapidly lost following exposure of cells to mating pheromone. Cln2 abundance can be explained by the G1-specific accumulation of the CLN2 transcript coupled with instability of the Cln2 protein. The abundance of the CLN1 and CLN2 transcripts increases greater than 5-fold during the G1 interval, decreasing dramatically as cells enter S phase. Both transcripts decrease in cells responding to mating pheromone. Finally, we demonstrate that the Cln2 polypeptide interacts with p34CDC28 to form an active protein kinase complex. This physical interaction is consistent with the genetic interaction between the CLN genes and CDC28 and suggests that Cln proteins are an essential component of the active protein kinase complex required for the G1 to S transition."
https://openalex.org/W1989969910,"Adenovirus infection activates the E2F transcription factor, in part through the formation of a heteromeric protein complex involving a 19 kd E4 gene product that then allows cooperative and stable promoter binding. We now find that cellular factors are complexed to E2F in extracts of several uninfected cell lines. E1A proteins can dissociate these complexes, releasing free E2F. This activity of E1A is independent of conserved domain 3 but is dependent on conserved domain 2 sequence. The E1A-mediated dissociation of the complexes allows the E4 protein to interact with E2F, generating a stable DNA-protein complex with the E2 promoter and a stimulation of transcription. These experiments demonstrate a function for E1A in mediating a dissociation of transcription factor complexes, allowing new interactions to form and thus changing the transcriptional specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2043059870,"The ability of series of U1 snRNAs and U6 snRNAs to migrate into the nucleus of Xenopus oocytes after injection into the cytoplasm was analyzed. The U snRNAs were made either by injecting U snRNA genes into the nucleus of oocytes or, synthetically, by T7 RNA polymerase, incorporating a variety of cap structures. The results indicate that nuclear targeting of U1 snRNA requires both a trimethylguanosine cap structure and binding of at least one common U snRNP protein. Using synthetic U6 snRNAs, it is further demonstrated that the trimethylguanosine cap structure can act in nuclear targeting in the absence of the common U snRNP proteins. These results imply that U snRNP nuclear targeting signals are of a modular nature."
https://openalex.org/W2090007293,"The pathways of endocytosis from the apical and the basolateral domains of epithelial MDCK cells are known to converge at the level of late endosomes in vivo. We have now reconstituted the meeting process in a cell-free assay that measures the fusion of apically and basolaterally derived endocytic vesicles with late endosomes. Our results show that this in vitro process requires the presence of polymerized microtubules, as does the convergence of the two pathways in vivo, and also depends on the presence of microtubule binding proteins, in particular the mechanochemical motors kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein."
https://openalex.org/W1594289068,"Kifunensine, produced by the actinomycete Kitasatosporia kifunense 9482, is an alkaloid that corresponds to a cyclic oxamide derivative of 1-amino mannojirimycin. This compound was reported to be a weak inhibitor of jack bean alpha-mannosidase (IC50 of 1.2 x 10(-4) M) (Kayakiri, H., Takese, S., Shibata, T., Okamoto, M., Terano, H., Hashimoto, M., Tada, T., and Koda, S. (1989) J. Org. Chem. 54, 4015-4016). We also found that kifunensine was a poor inhibitor of jack bean and mung bean aryl-alpha-mannosidases, but it was a very potent inhibitor of the plant glycoprotein processing enzyme, mannosidase I (IC50 of 2-5 x 10(-8) M), when [3H]mannose-labeled Man9GlcNAc was used as substrate. However, kifunensine was inactive toward the plant mannosidase II. Studies with rat liver microsomes also indicated that kifunensine inhibited the Golgi mannosidase I, but probably does not inhibit the endoplasmic reticulum mannosidase. Kifunensine was tested in cell culture by examining its ability to inhibit processing of the influenza viral glycoproteins in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Thus, when kifunensine was placed in the incubation medium at concentrations of 1 microgram/ml or higher, it caused a complete shift in the structure of the N-linked oligosaccharides from complex chains to Man9(GlcNAc)2 structures, in keeping with its inhibition of mannosidase I. On the other hand, even at 50 micrograms/ml, deoxymannojirimyucin did not prevent the formation of all complex chains. Thus kifunensine appears to be one of the most effective glycoprotein processing inhibitors observed thus far, and knowledge of its structure may lead to the development of potent inhibitors for other processing enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2039867172,"The major small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) U1, U2, U4 + U6, and U5 have to be transported from the cytoplasm, where they are synthesized, to the nucleus, where they splice pre-messenger RNAs. Since the free core snRNP proteins in the cytoplasm do not enter the nucleus on their own, the nuclear location signal must either reside on the snRNA or be created as a result of snRNA-protein interaction. Here the involvement by the 5'-terminal cap of snRNA molecules in the nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of UsnRNPs has been studied by microinjection of synthetic U1 RNA molecules into frog oocytes; the U1 RNA bore either the normal cap (m3G) or a chemical derivative. Antibodies in the cytoplasm against the m3G cap inhibited the nuclear uptake of U1 snRNP. U1 RNA that was uncapped or contained an unnatural ApppG cap did not enter the nucleus, even though it carried a normal complement of protein molecules. When the ribose ring of the m3G cap was oxidized with periodate, nuclear transport of U1 snRNPs was severely inhibited. Finally, microinjection of m3G cap alone (but not m7G cap) into oocytes severely inhibited the transport of U1 snRNPs to the nucleus. These data suggest that one step in the nuclear uptake of U1 snRNPs involves the m3G cap structure."
https://openalex.org/W2014827729,"Kinesin is a mechanochemical protein that converts the chemical energy in adenosine triphosphate into mechanical force for movement of cellular components along microtubules. The regions of the kinesin molecule responsible for generating movement were determined by studying the heavy chain of Drosophila kinesin, and its truncated forms, expressed in Escherichia coli. The results demonstrate that (i) kinesin heavy chain alone, without the light chains and other eukaryotic factors, is able to induce microtubule movement in vitro, and (ii) a fragment likely to contain only the kinesin head is also capable of inducing microtubule motility. Thus, the amino-terminal 450 amino acids of kinesin contain all the basic elements needed to convert chemical energy into mechanical force."

https://openalex.org/W2037926081,"Studies of the subunit interactions of the multicomponent T cell antigen receptor (TCR) revealed that specific pairs of chains have the ability to assemble after transfection into fibroblasts. For one such pair, TCR-α and CD3-δ, their ability to assemble was encoded by their transmembrane domains. The specificity of this interaction suggests that well-defined helical interactions in the membrane can explain the assembly of some multichain membrane complexes."

https://openalex.org/W1500873351,"Two intermediary kinases in a protein serine/threonine kinase cascade that is triggered in the response of Swiss 3T3 cells to epidermal growth factor (EGF) have been identified. Several separable EGF-stimulated serine/threonine kinase activities were characterized in the preceding paper (Ahn, N. G., Weiel, J. E., Chan, C. P., and Krebs, E.G. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 11487-11494). These were preincubated in various combinations in the presence of MgATP with chromatographic fractions from unstimulated cell extracts. Activation of the rate of phosphorylation of a synthetic peptide, Arg-Arg-Leu-Ser-Ser-Leu-Arg-Ala, was observed on preincubation of the breakthrough fraction from unstimulated cell extracts with either of two distinct EGF-stimulated kinase activities, each of which phosphorylated myelin basic protein. Kinetic analysis and fractionation by sizing gel chromatography demonstrated that two myelin basic protein kinase activities (of approximately 30 and approximately 50 kDa) represented the activating components in the mixtures whereas the unstimulated cell extract breakthrough gave rise in each case to the activated Arg-Arg-Leu-Ser-Ser-Leu-Arg-Ala peptide kinase activity of approximately 110 kDa. Inasmuch as the in vitro activation reactions required magnesium plus ATP and were reversed by protein phosphatase treatment, an activation mechanism involving phosphoryl transfer is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W1840335490,"Incubation of oat root plasma membrane vesicles in the presence of ATP with trypsin or chymotrypsin increased the rate of ATP hydrolysis and ATP-dependent proton pumping by the plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase. Proton pumping was stimulated more than 200%, whereas ATP hydrolytic activity was stimulated about 30%. The Km (ATP) for both proton pumping and ATP hydrolysis was lowered from about 0.3 mM to below 0.1 mM. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of trypsin-treated plasma membranes revealed a decrease in a 100-kDa band and the appearance of a 93-kDa band. Western blot analysis using antibodies against the H(+)-ATPase showed that both of these bands represented the H(+)-ATPase and suggested that a 7-kDa segment was released. Extensive treatment with carboxypeptidase A also activated the H(+)-ATPase indicating that the 7-kDa segment originated from the C terminus."
https://openalex.org/W1566481410,"Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) hydrolyzes triglyceride in plasma lipoprotein primarily while bound to vascular endothelial cells. LPL metabolism by cultured endothelial cells was studied. Purified radioiodinated bovine LPL bound to porcine aortic endothelial cells at 4 degrees C with an association constant of 0.18 x 10(7) m-1. Analysis of the time course of LPL dissociation from endothelial cells at 4 degrees C yielded a dissociation rate constant of 3.9 x 10(-6)s-1. After 1 h at 37 degrees C, 28% of the LPL initially bound to the cell surface was no longer releasable by heparin or trypsin treatments, suggesting that LPL was internalized by the cells. Addition of heparin to the medium or pretreatment of the cells with heparinase markedly reduced the amount of LPL internalized, establishing a requirement for cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans in the process. When cells containing internalized LPL were incubated at 37 degrees C, a time-dependent increase in the amount of LPL in the medium and a corresponding decrease in LPL associated with the cells was found. This suggested that internalized LPL was released back into the medium. The catalytic activity, molecular size, and heparin-binding characteristics of the released LPL was similar to native LPL. Addition of either heparin, heparinase, or excess unlabeled LPL to prevent the rebinding of released 125I-LPL to the cell surface increased the amount of 125I-LPL present in the medium, suggesting that there is a process of recycling of 125I-LPL bound to the cell surface. Studies examining the effect of pH on dissociation of LPL from its binding site showed less dissociation of cell surface bound LPL at pH 5.5 compared with pH 7.4 and 8.5. These results suggest that even at acidic pH as in endocytotic vesicles, LPL remains bound to proteoglycans and this may facilitate the recycling of internalized LPL molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1498690664,"The addition of gangliosides to tissue culture cells causes a decrease in the tyrosine protein kinase activity of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and an inhibition of EGF-stimulated growth. Based on these data, the hypothesis that the EGF receptor is physiologically regulated by gangliosides has been proposed by E.G. Bremer, J. Schlessinger, and S. Hakomori (J. Biol. Chem. (1986) 261, 2434-2440). To test this hypothesis, a mutant Chinese hamster ovary cell line (clone Idl D) that has a reversible defect in the biosynthesis of gangliosides (Kingsley, D.M., Kozarsky, K. F., Hobbie, L., and Krieger, M. (1986) Cell 44, 749-759) was investigated. The human EGF receptor cDNA was expressed in the mutant cells, and the properties of the EGF receptor were examined using cells grown under permissive and nonpermissive conditions. Changes in ganglioside expression were not observed to cause any significant alterations in the affinity or number of EGF receptors detected at the cell surface. However, decreased levels of ganglioside expression were associated with 1) increased EGF receptor autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues, and 2) increased EGF-stimulated cellular proliferation. The inverse correlation observed between the level of ganglioside expression and signal transduction by the EGF receptor is consistent with the hypothesis that the function of the EGF receptor is physiologically regulated by gangliosides."
https://openalex.org/W1561145742,"The T cell receptor (TCR) for antigen consists, on the majority of peripheral lymphocytes, of an immunoglobulin-like, disulfide-linked heterodimeric glycoprotein: the alpha and beta chain. These proteins are noncovalently linked to at least four nonvariant proteins which comprise the CD3 complex: CD3 gamma, delta, epsilon, and zeta. Whereas the TCR alpha and beta proteins have positively charged residues in the transmembrane region, all the CD3 proteins have similarly placed negatively charged amino acid residues. It has been suggested that these basic and acidic amino acid residues may play an important role in TCR.CD3 complex assembly and/or function. In this paper, the structural and functional role of the lysine and arginine residues of the TCR alpha chain was addressed using oligonucleotide mediated site directed mutagenesis. The Arg256 and Lys261 residues of the TCR alpha cDNA of the HPB-ALL cell line were mutated to either Gly256 and/or Ile261. The altered cDNAs were transfected into a TCR alpha negative recipient mutant cell line of REX, clone 20A. Metabolic labeling of the T cell transfectants showed that mutation of either the Arg256 or Lys261 amino acid residues had no effect on the ability of the TCR alpha chain to form either a heterodimer with the TCR beta chain or a complex with the CD3 gamma, delta, and epsilon proteins. Consequently, the Arg256 to Gly256 and Lys261 to Ile261 mutations did not prevent the formation of a mature, functional TCR.CD3 complex on the cell surface as determined by immunofluorescence, cell surface radioiodination, and the ability of the transfectants to mobilize intracellular calcium after stimulation with a mitogenic anti-CD3 epsilon monoclonal antibody. In contrast, a mutant cDNA in which both the Arg256 and Lys261 residues were mutated to Gly256 and Ile261, respectively, failed to reconstitute the cell surface expression of the TCR.CD3 complex and, consequently, the ability to respond to mitogenic stimuli. In the absence of both the Arg256 and Lys261 residues, TCR alpha beta heterodimer formation was not observed. Cotransfection studies in COS cells showed that the failure of assembly of a heterodimer was likely due to an inability of the mutated TCR alpha chain to form a subcomplex with either the CD3 gamma, delta, epsilon, or zeta proteins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1486586853,"The sequences Thr-Gly-Glu-Ser184 and Asp-Gln-Ser178 and individual residues Asp149, Asp157, and Asp162 in the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2(+)-ATPase are highly conserved throughout the family of cation-transporting ATPases. Mutant Thr181----Ala, Gly182----Ala, Glu183----Ala, and Glu183----Gln, created by in vitro mutagenesis, were devoid of Ca2+ transport activity. None of these mutations, however, affected phosphorylation of the enzyme by ATP in the presence of Ca2+ or by inorganic phosphate in the absence of Ca2+, indicating that the high affinity Ca2(+)-binding sites and the nucleotide-binding sites were intact. In each of these mutants, the ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme intermediate (E1P) decayed to the ADP-insensitive form (E2P) very slowly relative to the wild-type enzyme, whereas E2P decayed at a rate similar to that of the wild-type enzyme. Thus, the inability of the mutants to transport Ca2+ was accounted for by an apparent block of the transport reaction at the E1P to E2P conformational transition. These results suggest that Thr181, Gly182, and Glu183 play essential roles in the conformational change between E1P and E2P. Mutation of Ser184, Asp157, or Ser178 had little or no effect on either Ca2+ transport activity or expression. Mutations of Asp149, Asp162, and Gln177, however, were poorly expressed. Where expression could be measured, in mutations to Asp162 and Gln177, Ca2+ transport activity was essentially equivalent to that of the wild-type enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1506869135,"Clonal expansion of antigen-specific lymphocytes is an important aspect of the immune response. Interleukin 2 (IL2) is largely responsible for the amplification of antigen-specific T cells. In this study, the changes in gene expression accompanying interleukin 2 stimulation of T cells are examined, using a cloned T helper lymphocyte line as a model system. To isolate cDNA clones of IL2-induced genes, a cDNA library was screened by differential hybridization. Twenty-one different cDNA clones were isolated by this method, comprising six glycolytic enzymes, vimentin, alpha-tubulin, beta-actin, gamma-actin, ERp99, elongation factor 2, ribosomal phosphoprotein P1, the DNA-binding protein dbpB/YB-1, as well as seven clones which do not correspond to any previously described sequences. These clones are used to study the time course of expression and the sensitivity to cycloheximide inhibition of IL2-induced mRNAs. In addition, the tissue specificity of the unidentified mRNAs is examined, and two of these are shown to be expressed at high levels in normal mouse brain, with much lower or undetectable levels in the other tissues tested. These cDNA clones will be useful in future studies to determine the molecular basis of IL2-induced gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W15519556,"The interactions of calcium and lathanides with the sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase, and their respective ability to activate the enzyme, were studied by direct measurements of binding with radioactive tracers, functional effects on the ATPase partial reactions, changes in the quantum yield of tryptophanyl residues and a covalently bound fluorescein label (fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate, FITC), and energy transfer between bound lanthanide and fluorescent labels. We find that: (a) Lanthanides displace calcium from specific ATPase sites with diphasic kinetics that are consistent with sequential exchange. (b) Lanthanides in excess of the calcium stoichiometry are mostly bound to sarcoplasmic reticulum lipids and non-ATPase proteins. (c) Both calcium and lanthanides activate the ATPase and allow formation of the phosphorylated intermediate by utilization of ATP; however, hydrolytic cleavage of the intermediate formed in the presence of lanthanides occurs at a slower rate than the intermediate formed in the presence of calcium. (d) In contrast to a calcium-dependent change in the quantum yield of both the tryptophanyl residues (transmembrane region) and the FITC label (extramembranous region), lanthanides induce only a change in the quantum yield of the FITC label. (e) Measurements of energy transfer between bound lanthanide and fluorescent labels detect lanthanide bound midway between the catalytic site in the globular region of the ATPase outside the membrane, and the transmembrane calcium binding domain which is involved in enzyme activation (Clarke, D. M., Loo, T. W., Inesi, G., and MacLennan, D. H. (1989a) Nature 339, 476-478). It is apparent that cation bound in this midway location controls exchange of calcium bound in the transmembrane region. The possibility that the midway location may provide a domain for binding of a second calcium is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1518941550,"We purified and characterized a soluble human interferon gamma receptor expressed in Escherichia coli. The soluble receptor comprises the amino acids 15-246 of the encoded protein (Aguet, M., Dembic, Z., and Merlin, G. (1988) Cell 55, 273-280) and was purified from large scale fermentations through four chromatographic steps with an overall recovery of 28%. The refolded soluble receptor shows some heterogeneity on nonreducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, where it appears as the major band of 27 kDa molecular mass, accompanied by a few minor bands with molecular masses between 26 and 30 kDa. On reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis it appears as a homogeneous protein of 32 kDa molecular mass. The soluble interferon gamma receptor is an active and stable protein and is recognized by specific antibodies raised against the native receptor. When nonreduced it has the capacity to specifically bind interferon gamma and to compete for the binding of interferon gamma to the cell surface receptor. The observed heterogeneity of the soluble interferon gamma receptor under nonreducing electrophoretic conditions is probably due to different conformational forms resulting from the formation of non-native intramolecular disulfide bonds among the 8 cysteine residues present in the soluble interferon gamma receptor molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1593432935,"The mast cell receptor with high affinity for IgE consists of four transmembrane polypeptides which are held together by detergent-sensitive interactions: an IgE-binding alpha chain, a single beta chain, and a disulfide-linked dimer of gamma chains. Now that the cDNAs that code for each of the subunits have been isolated, it should be possible to probe by site-specific mutations, which portions of the receptor are critical for transmembrane signaling. One prerequisite for such studies is that the mutant receptors be expressible on the cell surface. We have explored this issue by transiently transfecting COS 7 cells with mutant subunits and assessing surface expression by IgE binding. Removal of any single cytoplasmic domain of the receptor's subunits had little influence on surface expression, and even receptors missing all five cytoplasmic domains were expressed, albeit less efficiently. Minor changes within the transmembrane domains (TMs) sometimes produced major effects and more drastic changes in the TMs ablated surface expression entirely. These data suggest that the TMs are critical loci for receptor display. Cys7 (residue 2 in the gamma TM) was shown to form the inter-gamma disulfide bond and to be nonessential for surface expression. By localizing this bond, residues in the TM of gamma that are buried in the interface between the gamma subunits could be predicted. Consistent with observations on other membrane proteins (Rees, D. C., DeAntonio, L., and Eisenberg, D. (1989) Science 245, 510-513), maximal interspecies conservation was observed for those residues in the gamma TM predicted to be buried. This was also true for those residues in the alpha and beta TMs predicted to be buried by analysis of the TM hydrophobic moments."
https://openalex.org/W1524346733,"The modulatory role of endogenous cellular glycosphingolipids in bradykinin-stimulated myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) formation by MDCK cells was evaluated utilizing the glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor, threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP). Bradykinin-stimulated InsP3 formation in intact cells and in isolated plasma membranes was significantly enhanced when cells were first depleted of their glucosphingolipids. The effect of glucosphingolipid depletion on phospholipase C activity was dependent on the duration of exposure to the inhibitor and the cellular level of glucosylceramide. Inclusion of glucosylceramide in the culture medium prevented the stimulatory effect of PDMP on InsP3 formation. It is concluded that membrane glucosphingolipids may regulate phospholipase C activity."
https://openalex.org/W1570364436,"An in vitro system containing the T4 gene 43, 45, 44/62, 32, dda, and uvsX proteins catalyzes DNA synthesis that is dependent on the synapsis step of homologous genetic recombination. The rate of DNA synthesis in this system is highly dependent on the concentration of the uvsX recombinase (a recA-like protein). Here we report the effect of the T4 uvsY protein, a recombination accessory protein, on this reaction. Low concentrations of uvsY protein greatly stimulate DNA synthesis at low concentrations of uvsX protein, but these same concentrations inhibit DNA synthesis at high concentrations of uvsX protein. As a result, the addition of small amounts of uvsY protein lowers the minimum concentration of uvsX protein needed for the reaction 8-fold, and it lowers the uvsX protein concentration for maximum activity 4-fold. The uvsY protein can affect either the initiation or elongation phase of DNA synthesis, depending on the concentration of uvsX protein present. The implications of these results for the function of the uvsY protein in T4 DNA replication in vivo are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1591954229,"Abstract Eleven single strand initiation sequences (ssi) were isolated from various plasmid genomes using a plaque-morphology assay. Out of seven ssi that require dnaB and dnaC functions for replication in a crude in vitro system, six use a phi X174 type priming mechanism, and a phi X174 type primosome is assembled at these sequences from the purified proteins, n'(priA), n(priB), n(priC), dnaT, dnaB, dnaC, and primase. The same ssi potentiate dATPase activity of n' protein, and thus represent new n' protein recognition sequences (n'-pas). Based on sequence homology, two structural groups are evident. Two sequences show a strong homology with the phi X174 site, whereas three share extensive homology with the previously characterized n'-pas of ColE1, ssiA(ColE1). All the n'-pas have a potential to form stem and loop structures, although sequence homology between the two classes is absent. In addition to the phi X174 type priming, three ssi do not require either dnaB or dnaC function for replication, and use a G4 type priming, requiring only SSB and primase. The 5' ends of primer RNA synthesized by primase are localized within the vicinity of one of the three blocks of highly conserved nucleotide sequences. Deletions of parts of these conserved sequences result in loss of priming activity, suggesting that they are important for priming on the G4 type ssi, which are termed G site. The general significance of these two types of priming in initiation of lagging or leading strand synthesis as well as various modes of initiation at origins of replication are proposed."
https://openalex.org/W122527086,"Direct double-strand breaks in DNA have been implicated in cellular lethality of the antitumor antibiotic neocarzinostatin, but the mechanism of their formation has not been elucidated. Evidence is presented that neocarzinostatin causes sequence-specific direct double-strand breaks whose formation is strongly influenced by the activating thiol. Seven-fold more double-strand breaks result when glutathione rather than 2-mercaptoethanol is used to activate the drug to its putative diradical form, while the sequence specificity of cleavage remains the same. These data explain earlier inconsistencies in the ratios of double-strand to single-strand breaks obtained from in vitro and in vivo studies. Double-strand cleavage sites, occurring predominantly at GT steps, especially AGT.ACT, consist of trinucleotide sequences with a two-nucleotide 3'-stagger of the cleaved residues. The chemical structures of the cleavage sites suggest a model in which a neocarzinostatin-induced double-strand break results from abstraction of a C5' hydrogen atom from the T of ACT and the C4' hydrogen atom of the T of AGT by a single molecule of the diradical form of the drug. Single-strand breaks at these sites occur as separate events with attack at the C5' hydrogens. These findings permit the generalization that single-strand breaks produced by neocarzinostatin show a base preference but no clear sequence specificity, while bistranded lesions are sequence-specific in nature."
https://openalex.org/W1489541545,"The nearest neighbor relationships of bovine mitochondrial H(+)-ATPase subunits were investigated by the chemical cross-linking approach using the homobifunctional cleavable reagents dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) and disuccinimidyl tartrate. Cross-linked proteins were resolved by one- and two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Individual subunits were detected by silver staining or by Western blotting and staining with subunit-specific antisera. Products larger than 80,000 daltons were not analyzed. Interactions between F1 subunits included cross-links between gamma and delta as well as gamma and epsilon subunits. Among F0 subunit interactions were observed cross-links of (i) coupling factor 6 (F6) with 8-, 20-, and 24-kDa proteins, (ii) oligomycin sensitivity-conferring protein (OSCP) with 24-kDa protein, and (iii) 20-kDa protein with 24-kDa protein. In addition, several cross-links among subunits involving F1 and F0 sectors were detected. These included cross-links between F6 and alpha, F6 and gamma, OSCP and alpha/beta, and 24-kDa protein and alpha/beta. Thus, OSCP, F6, and the 24-kDa protein were found to form cross-links with both F1 and F0 subunits. The surface accessibility of F0 subunits was investigated by subjecting aliquots of F0 to trypsin treatment. Our data demonstrated that the rate of degradation was in the order OSCP greater than 24-kDa protein greater than or equal to F6 greater than subunit 6. The degradation of subunits of F0 was prevented in intact or reconstituted F1-F0. Based on our present and previously published observations, a model of H(+)-ATPase has been proposed wherein OSCP, F6, and the 24-kDa protein are placed in the stalk region and the alpha and beta subunits of F1-ATPase have been extended down to the membrane surface to enclose the stalk segment."
https://openalex.org/W1956393587,"A lambda gt11 cDNA expression library was screened with antibodies directed against individual subunits of complex I from Neurospora crassa. Clones encoding cytoplasmically synthesized polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of 22, 29, 31, and 33 kDa were isolated. Northern blot analysis revealed that the corresponding genes are transcribed into mRNA species of about 0.85, 0.95, 1.3, and 1.4 kilobases, respectively. Further characterization of clones encoding the 22-kDa subunit was performed. A cDNA insert of 755 base pairs containing the complete coding sequence was used to express the polypeptide in vitro. A precursor of the protein is synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes without a cleavable signal sequence. Our data indicate that after import into the organelle and before assembly into complex I, the 22-kDa polypeptide forms intramolecular disulfide bridge(s). Nucleotide sequencing revealed an open reading frame coding for a protein of 183 amino acids. A molecular mass of 20,828 daltons was calculated. The polypeptide is hydrophilic and contains no obvious membrane-spanning domains. Eight cysteine residues arranged in a regular pattern are found in the primary structure of the protein. Therefore, this subunit is a good candidate to bind at least one of the iron-sulfur centers present in complex I of the respiratory chain."
https://openalex.org/W1523967247,"The structural basis for Ca2+ transport was examined in vesicles reconstituted with an excess of phospholipid by a cholate dialysis procedure. Unincorporated protein and vesicles with a relatively high protein content were removed by sucrose density centrifugation (3-12%), leaving a fraction of lipid-rich vesicles (lipid to protein weight ratio 800-900:1) with a high coupling ratio (1.0) and transport capacity (25 mumol/mg protein, after Ca-phosphate loading). Freeze-fracture analysis showed that the reconstituted vesicles had a remarkably narrow size distribution (diameter 794 +/- 77 A (S.D.], suitable for stereological analysis. Intramembranous particles were dispersed and occurred with a low frequency in the fractured shells, also before sucrose fractionation. It was calculated that the number of intramembranous particles corresponded to the number of Ca2(+)-ATPase polypeptide/vesicle. A ratio of unity between particles and polypeptide chains was also obtained from the density of particle distribution on flat surfaces of fused vesicles, prepared by sucrose fractionation. The size of the particles formed a broad distribution, having a peak value around 60-67 A, both in the reconstituted preparation and sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles. No evidence for protein-protein interactions was found in chemical cross-linking experiments. It is concluded that the intramembranous particles in the reconstituted preparations are referable to monomeric Ca2(+)-ATPase which is capable of transporting Ca2+ inside the vesicles. The implications of the observations for the associational state of Ca2(+)-ATPase at high protein concentration are considered in relation to previous ultrastructural investigations of membranous Ca2(+)-ATPase in native and two-dimensional-crystalline forms."
https://openalex.org/W1500840951,"p36 (annexin 2) is the major cytoplasmic target of the src tyrosine-kinase and forms in vitro and in vivo a stable tetrameric complex in which two p36 polypeptides interact with a dimer of a unique p11 polypeptide. p11 belongs into the superfamily of EF-hand proteins. Upon mild cysteine modification conditions, both cysteines (position 61 and 82) of the free p11 become substituted, and the ability to form the p36.p11 complex is lost. Under the same conditions, the 2 cysteines of p11 incorporated into the complex display differential reactivity. Here, cysteine 61 is fully substituted while cysteine-82 is protected. p11 derivatives substituted only on cysteine 61 retain binding activity for p36 unless cysteine 82 is substituted by a second cycle of modification of the isolated p11. Thus, the C-terminal extension protruding from the second EF-hand of the p11 molecule (residues 77-96) is important for the interaction with p36. As a consequence of our analysis, we report a new separation of p36 and p11 from the p36.p11 complex. This is based on a reversible cysteine modification and thus is an alternative to the denaturation and renaturation cycle used previously."
https://openalex.org/W1586672231,"The enzyme tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and its substrate Glu-plasminogen can both bind to fibrin. The assembly of these three components results in about a 1000-fold acceleration of the conversion of Glu-plasminogen into plasmin. Fibrin binding of t-PA is mediated both by its finger (F) domain and its kringle-2 domain. Fibrin binding of Glu-plasminogen involves its kringle structures (K1-K5). It has been suggested that particular kringles contain lysine-binding sites and/or aminohexyl-binding sites, exhibiting affinity for specific carboxyl-terminal lysines and intrachain lysines, respectively. We investigated the possibility that t-PA and Glu-plasminogen kringles share common binding sites in fibrin, limitedly digested with plasmin. For that purpose we performed competition experiments, using conditions that exclude plasmin formation, with Glu-plasminogen and either t-PA or two deletion mutants, lacking the F domain (t-PA del.F) or lacking the K2 domain (t-PA del.K2). Our data show that fibrin binding of t-PA, mediated by the F domain, is independent of Glu-plasminogen binding. In contrast, partial inhibition by Glu-plasminogen of t-PA K2 domain-mediated fibrin binding is observed that is dependent on carboxyl-terminal lysines, exposed in fibrin upon limited plasmin digestion. Half-maximal competition of fibrin binding of both t-PA and t-PA del.F is obtained at 3.3 microM Glu-plasminogen. The difference between this value and the apparent dissociation constant of Glu-plasminogen binding to limitedly digested fibrin (12.1 microM) under these conditions is attributed to multiple, simultaneous interactions, each having a separate affinity. It is concluded that t-PA and Glu-plasminogen can bind to the same carboxyl-terminal lysines in limitedly digested fibrin, whereas binding sites composed of intrachain lysines are unique both for the K2 domain of t-PA and the Glu-plasminogen kringles."
https://openalex.org/W1488155764,"The regulation of the cellular distribution of proteoglycans in a clonal rat parathyroid cell line by extracellular Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]e) was studied. Proteoglycans synthesized by the cells metabolically labeled with [35S]sulfate have been shown to be almost exclusively heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans (Yanagishita, M., Brandi, M.L., and Sakaguchi, K. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 15714-15720), which are generally associated with the plasma membrane. The proportion of HS proteoglycans on the cell surface was approximately 20% in 2.1 mM (high) [Ca2+]e, whereas it increased to 50-60% in 0.05 mM (low) [Ca2+]e. Cell-associated HS proteoglycans redistribute in response to changing [Ca2+]e with a t 1/2 less than 4 min; HS proteoglycans appear on the cell surface as [Ca2+]e decreases and disappear from the cell surface as [Ca2+]e increases. Further, HS proteoglycans on the cell surface recycle to and from an intracellular compartment approximately 10 times before their degradation in low [Ca2+]e but do not recycle in high [Ca2+]e. The distribution of newly synthesized HS proteoglycans is regulated by [Ca2+]e but is independent of [Ca2+]e during biosynthesis. In low [Ca2+]e, at least 50% of the HS proteoglycans pulse-labeled for 10 min are transported from the Golgi complex to the cell surface or to the recycling compartment with a t 1/2 of approximately 20 min. Another approximately 10% appear on the cell surface in either low or high [Ca2+]e in a compartment with a long half-life. Addition of Mg2+ or Ba2+ to the low [Ca2+]e cultures had little effect on the distribution of HS proteoglycans. These observations suggest that [Ca2+]e specifically regulates the distribution and recycling of cell-associated HS proteoglycans in the parathyroid cells."
https://openalex.org/W1588806996,"The COOH-terminal portion of the A alpha chain of human fibrinogen is highly susceptible to proteolytic degradation. This property has prevented isolation of the COOH-terminal domain of fibrinogen for the direct investigation of its functional characteristics. Human fibrinogen was degraded with hementin, a fibrinogen-olytic protease from the posterior salivary glands of the leech, Haementeria ghilianii. Two initial fragments, Yhem1 and Dhem1, produced by cleavage through the three polypeptide chains in the connector region, were characterized and shown to retain the entire A alpha COOH-terminal domain. Late cleavages by hementin occurred in the A alpha chain COOH-terminal region to produce fragments Yhem and Dhem with shorter A alpha chain remnants. Fragments Dhem were isolated from an intermediate hementin digest of fibrinogen using anion-exchange chromatography. Fragment Dhem1 was separated further from Dhem fragments with shorter alpha chain remnants by affinity chromatography on immobilized plasma fibronectin. Fragment Dhem1 represents a unique proteolytic fragment of fibrinogen containing an intact A alpha chain COOH-terminal region. NH2-terminal sequence analysis of isolated chains from fragment Dhem1 located hementin cleavage sites in the connector region to A alpha Asn102-Asn103, B beta Lys130-Gln131, and gamma Pro76-Asn77. The specific interaction of fragment Dhem1 with immobilized fibronectin indicated that the binding site probably was located within the COOH-terminal 111 amino acids of the A alpha chain. The overall pattern of fibrinogen cleavage by hementin is similar to that of plasmin, yet hementin cleaves preferably in the coiled-coil connector, sparing the A alpha COOH-terminal domain."
https://openalex.org/W1603810289,"Culture medium conditioned by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-differentiated THP-1 cells contained interleukin 1 (IL-1) antagonist activity as measured by inhibition of both IL-1 beta binding to receptors on YT cells and inhibition of IL-1/phytohemagglutinin-stimulated IL-2 synthesis by LBRM-33-1A5 T cells. Based on their ability to compete for 125I-IL-1 beta binding to receptors on YT cells, four distinct antagonist proteins were purified from THP-1 cell conditioned medium using a combination of ion-exchange, hydrophobic interaction, and size exclusion chromatographies. The four proteins had different isoelectric points with molecular masses in the range 22-26 kDa and had similar specific activities for inhibition of IL-1 beta binding to cell surface receptors (Ki values 0.33-0.64 nM) and for inhibition of IL-1/phytohemagglutinin-stimulated IL-2 synthesis by 1A5 cells (IC50 values 25-100 pM). Amino-terminal sequence analysis of the two major forms (25 kDa/pI 5.1 and 22 kDa/pI 5.8) revealed complete identity for the first 27 residues in both forms. Based on the results of peptide mapping, amino acid compositional analysis and immune blotting, all of the forms were deduced to be variants of a common protein. Deglycosylation of the antagonist proteins with N-glycanase converted them to a common form (22 kDa/pI 5.8), indicating that the four isoforms represent glycosylation variants of a common protein and that asparagine-linked oligosaccharides are responsible for the observed size and charge heterogeneity."
https://openalex.org/W1756389380,"At concentrations from 10 to 100 mM, inorganic phosphate and sulfate stimulate the activity of the H(+)-ATPase purified from the wild type Schizosaccharomyces pombe plasma membranes. Compared to the wild type ATPase, the stimulation by phosphate is more pronounced in the mutant pma1-1 (Gly-268—-Asp) and is much reduced in the mutant pma1-2 (Lys-250—-Thr) enzymes. In contrast, the inhibition by trifluoperazine is less pronounced in the pma1-1 mutant than in the wild type or pma1-2 mutant. The mutant pma1-2 ATPase activity is markedly stimulated by 10-20% dimethyl sulfoxide, which has a limited effect on the wild type and pma1-1 enzymes. These data indicate that the protein domain located in the beta-strand sector, including Lys-250 and Gly-268, is located in the active site and that its hydrophobic character influences the interactions of the yeast H(+)-ATPase with inorganic phosphate, as well as with the hydrophobic inhibitor trifluoperazine or the hydrophobic solvent dimethyl sulfoxide."
https://openalex.org/W1504348190,"We recently described a mutant recA protein in which glycine 160 of the recA polypeptide was replaced by an asparagine residue (Bryant, F. R. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 8716-8723). Although the [Asn-160]recA protein has a ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity that is similar to that of the wild-type recA protein, the mutant protein is unable to promote the ATP-dependent three-strand exchange reaction under standard reaction conditions (pH 7.5, 1 mM ATP). We have found that the [Asn-160]recA protein is able to carry out the three-strand exchange reaction at pH 6.0 to 6.7, but that the strand exchange activity is abolished at higher pH. The induction of strand exchange activity at low pH correlates directly with a pH-mediated activation of an ATP-dependent isomerization of the [Asn-160]recA protein. This ATP-dependent isomerization is characterized by the conversion of the [Asn-160]recA protein to a form that is not displaced from ssDNA by the Escherichia coli SSB protein. In contrast to the pronounced pH sensitivity of the [Asn-160]recA protein, the wild-type recA protein undergoes ATP-dependent isomerization, and is able to carry out the three-strand exchange reaction, over the range of pH 6.0 to 8.4. These results show that the [Asn-160] mutation disrupts the ATP-dependent isomerization of the recA protein and suggest that protonation of the [Asn-160]recA protein (or the [Asn-160]recA-ssDNA complex) relieves this mechanistic defect. Furthermore, the direct correlation between ATP-dependent isomerization and the strand exchange activity of the [Asn-160]recA protein strongly suggests that the ATP-dependent isomerization is an obligatory step in the recA protein-promoted strand exchange mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1519836539,"Chromatographic procedures were developed to purify chloroplast ATP synthase (CF0-CF1) in large amounts and to resolve subunits from this enzyme. The ATP synthase thus obtained has high ATP-Pi exchange and Mg2(+)-ATPase activities upon incorporation into asolectin liposomes. The purity of this preparation was about 95%. By modifications of this chromatographic procedure, we purified subunit IV-deficient CF0-CF1, subunit IV-deficient CF0, and subunit IV. Both ATP-Pi exchange and Mg2(+)-ATPase activities were impaired by depletion of subunit IV from CF0-CF1. Partial restoration of these activities was obtained by reconstituting subunit IV-deficient CF0-CF1 with subunit IV. The impairment of these activities was likely caused by a loss in proton conductivity of CF0 upon removal of subunit IV. The dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-sensitive Mg2(+)-ATPase of subunit IV-deficient CF0-CF1 was not as sensitive to the depletion of subunit IV as ATP-Pi exchange. Nearly 90% of subunit IV could be removed, but Mg2(+)-ATPase activity was inhibited by only 40-60%. Thus subunit IV of CF0-CF1 may not participate directly in proton transfer but may have a role in organizing and/or stabilizing CF0 structure."
https://openalex.org/W1566600342,"Biotinyl analogues of [Arg8]vasopressin were synthesized with the biotinyl moiety at position 4. This involved the substitution of 2, 4-diaminobutyric acid (Dab) for Gln4 in [1-deamino-Arg8]vasopressin to give the parent peptide des-[Dab4,Arg8]vasopressin. Two biotinyl analogues with different spacers between the side chain of Dab4 and the biotinyl residue were then prepared and characterized in detail. The analogues retained high binding affinities for the V2-receptor in both bovine kidney membranes and LLC-PK1 renal epithelial cells and for the V1-receptor in rat liver membranes. Both analogues were as potent as [Arg8] vasopressin in stimulating the cAMP-dependent protein kinase and the production of urokinase-type plasminogen activator in LLC-PK1 cells, with concentration dependence consistent with receptor binding affinities. Avidin or streptavidin did not appear to reduce receptor binding or biological activity of the biotinyl analogues. The use of the biotinylated vasopressin analogue des-[Dab-(biotinylamido)hexanoyl4, Arg8]vasopressin together with fluorescein-labeled streptavidin as a fluorescent probe for the V2-receptor in LLC-PK1 cells demonstrated the following: 1) Specific binding of the biotinyl analogue shown by quantitative single-cell fluorescence measurements using the technique of fluorescence microphotolysis; 2) the V2-receptor visualized by fluorescence microscopy; and 3) the expression of the V2-receptor detected by flow cytometry."
https://openalex.org/W1582808591,"Abstract The beta subunit of the rat liver mitochondrial ATP synthase contains a glycine-rich amino acid sequence implicated in binding nucleotides by its similarity to a sequence found in many other nucleotide-binding proteins. A C-terminal three-quarter-length rat liver beta subunit fragment (Glu122 through Ser479), containing this homology region, interacts with adenine nucleotides (Garboczi, D.N., Hullihen, J.H., and Pedersen, P.L. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 15694-15698). Here we directly test the involvement of the glycine-rich region in nucleotide binding by altering its amino acid sequence through mutation or deletion. Twenty-one mutations within the glycine-rich region of the beta subunit cDNA were randomly generated. Wild-type and mutant beta subunit proteins were purified from overexpressing Escherichia coli strains. The mutant proteins were screened for changes in their interaction with 2'(3')-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)adenosine 5'-triphosphate (TNP-ATP), a fluorescent nucleotide analog. Only one mutant protein bearing two amino acid changes (Gly153----Val, Gly156----Arg) exhibited a fluorescence enhancement higher than that of the wild-type control. Further analysis of this protein revealed a lower affinity for TNP-ATP (Kd = 10 microM) compared with wild type (Kd = 5 microM). In addition, a mutant from which amino acids Gly149-Lys214 had been deleted was prepared. This mutant protein, which lacks the entire glycine-rich region, also displayed a marked reduction in affinity for TNP-ATP (Kd greater than 60 microM). Prior addition of 0.5 mM ATP significantly reduced the binding of TNP-ATP to both the double and deletion mutants. The altered interaction of nucleotide with both glycine-rich region mutants points to the involvement of this region in the binding site. Further, this work shows that a beta subunit protein that lacks the glycine-rich homology region can still interact with nucleotide, indicating that one or more additional regions of this subunit contribute to the nucleotide binding site."

The partially purified enzyme exhibited several protein bands when examined by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions; among these, a 35-kDa polypeptide was quite prominent and appeared to be enriched during purification. Photoaffinity labeling of the partially purified enzyme preparation with 5-azido-[beta-32P]UDP-Glc identified a 35-kDa polypeptide. Labeling of a solubilized enzyme preparation from crude and stripped microsomes also revealed a 35-kDa band on 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Photoinsertion of the probe in this polypeptide is enhanced by the presence of dolichol phosphate and Mg2+. Competition studies with UDP-Glc, UDP-glucuronic acid, other sugar nucleotides, and Glc-1-phosphate provide evidence to validate the specificity of photoaffinity labeling. These studies indicate that this 35-kDa polypeptide is involved in the synthesis of dolichol-P-Glc in rat mammary tissue. The possibility that this polypeptide may represent glucosyltransferase has been discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1608360723,"The proton-linked ATP synthase (CF1-CF0) of chloroplasts consists of a catalytic component (CF1) and a membrane-embedded part (CF0) that interacts with CF1 and contains a proton channel. The subunits of CF0 which are involved in binding of CF1 were studied by examining the effect of selective depletion of subunits I, II, and IV of CF0 from the chloroplast ATP synthase on the association of the remaining CF0 subunits with CF1. Dissociated CF0 subunits were identified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Removal of subunit IV alone from CF0-CF1 did not cause dissociation of the other CF0 subunits from CF1. Upon removal of both subunits I and IV from CF0-CF1, subunit II also dissociated, but subunit III was still bound to CF1. Thus, at least two subunits of CF0, I and III, directly associate with CF1. Subunit II is unlikely to bind CF1 directly and may associate with subunit I. Although depletion of subunit IV does not cause dissociation of CF0 from CF1, its interaction with CF1 subunits is uncertain."
https://openalex.org/W1531938662,"A novel photoaffinity label for studies with the F1-ATPase has been synthesized and found to be an effective reporter of subunit conformational changes that occur in this enzyme upon multiple nucleotide-binding site occupancy. The new probe, 4-benzoyl(benzoyl)-1-amidofluorescein (BzAF), which possesses structural similarity to purine nucleotides, exhibits bifunctional characteristics that enable it to bind covalently to the exchangeable nucleotide sites on beef heart F1 (via photoactivation of the benzophenone moiety) and, once covalently linked, emit environmentally sensitive fluorescence (via selective excitation of the fluorescein moiety). BzAF binds competitively with ATP in the absence of illumination, with a KI of 50 microM. Under actinic irradiation necessary for generating the covalently reacting diradical triplet state of benzophenone, BzAF behaves as a nucleotide site-directed photoaffinity label of exchangeable (catalytic) sites, and the resulting photoinhibition of ATPase activity displays pseudo first-order rate-saturation kinetics that support formation of a dissociable BzAF.F1 complex (k-1/k1 = 58 microM) prior to covalent binding. The BzAF-induced photoinactivation is protectable with native nucleotide ligand (e.g. MgADP, Kprotect = 0.4 mM). Added corroboration of a catalytic cooperativity mechanism for F1 was obtained by finding a molar stoichiometric ratio [( 3H]BzAF:F1) of 1 required for complete inhibition of ATPase activity. Steady-state fluorescence studies with a unisite-labeled BzAF.F1 complex (a catalytically inactive species on which at least one exchangeable nucleotide-binding site remains unoccupied) display a saturable fluorescence quenching of the bound fluorescein upon titration with MgADP, but no change with MgAMP. These data imply that the filling of more than one of the catalytic binding sites/mol of F1 with nucleotide signals a precatalytic conformational adjustment that is transmitted between catalytic sites and across the beta-alpha-beta domain of the enzyme's subunit structure."

https://openalex.org/W1582527278,"Reconstituted transhydrogenase-ATPase vesicles obtained with purified beef heart transhydrogenase and oligomycin-sensitive ATPase were investigated with respect to the mode of interaction between the two proton pumps, with special reference to the relative contributions of the membrane potential and proton gradient using valinomycin and nigericin in the presence of potassium. In the absence of ionophores and at low ATP concentrations, below 20 microM, the ATPase generated a proton motive force which was predominantly due to a membrane potential, whereas at saturating concentrations of ATP the proton gradient was the predominant component. The ATP-dependence of the rate of the ATP-driven transhydrogenase reaction showed apparent Km values in the low and high ATP concentration range of about 3 and 56 microM, respectively, with a corresponding difference in Vmax of about 3-fold. It is concluded that the reconstituted transhydrogenase can utilize both a membrane potential and a proton gradient, separately or combined, where the relative contributions of these components depend on the activity of the ATPase. In the reconstituted vesicles, the maximally active transhydrogenase is apparently driven by an electrochemical proton gradient where the membrane potential and the proton gradient contribute one-third and two-thirds, respectively. The rate-dependent relative generation of a membrane potential and pH gradient presumably reflects the proton pump characteristics of the ATPase and/or buffering/permeability characteristics of the vesicles rather than the properties of the transhydrogenase per se. These results are discussed in relation to current models for transhydrogenase-linked proton translocation."

The modified enzyme has been purified to homogeneity, and its enzymatic properties show that this single mutation suppresses the heterotropic interactions without affecting the homotropic ones. The mutant has the same saturation curve by fructose 6-phosphate as the wild type, showing that its active site binds this substrate with the same affinity and cooperativity. The regulatory site of the mutant enzyme can bind the effectors, the activator GDP, or the inhibitor phosphoenolpyruvate, as measured by protection against irreversible thermal denaturation. However, the binding of either effector does no longer influence the activity. This specific suppression of the coupling between the regulatory and active sites is not predicted by the concerted model which postulates that the same structural transition between two states R and T is responsible for both homotropic and heterotropic interactions.

Membrane-stimulated vanadate-dependent NADH oxidation has been hypothesized to involve the cellular accumulation of H2O2, which may cause the vanadate sensitivity of animals and microbes. This report shows that the vanadate-dependent NADH oxidation activity of the yeast plasma membrane requires oxygen and is present in vanadate-resistant mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In addition, the vanadate sensitivity of growth in S. cerevisiae is the same during aerobic and anaerobic growth. These results imply that neither plasma membrane-mediated vanadate-stimulated NADH oxidation, nor any other oxidative process, is the primary cause of vanadate sensitivity in yeast cells."
https://openalex.org/W1552152308,"The reaction of N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) with Cys-532 of the Neurospora plasma membrane [H+]ATPase results in inhibition of ATP hydrolysis which is protected by MgADP (Pardo, J. P., and Slayman, C. W. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 9373-9379). To examine the conformational state of the ATPase upon NEM modification, we have used limited trypsinolysis and domain-specific antibodies. The NEM-reacted ATPase shows increased sensitivity to trypsin, particularly in the central hydrophilic region of the polypeptide thought to contain the ATP binding and phosphorylation sites. In addition, competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays indicate that the C-terminal domain of the ATPase becomes more accessible to antibody binding while the N-terminal region becomes more protected. The NEM-induced structural change is accompanied by loss of the ability to form a phosphoenzyme intermediate. The change in tertiary conformation occurs specifically upon NEM reaction with Cys-532 since neither NEM modification of Cys-545 nor fluorescein 5'-isothiocyanate modification of Lys-474 alters the tryptic digestion pattern of the ATPase. Furthermore, modification of Cys-532 with the less bulky sulfhydryl reagent methyl methanethiosulfonate does not result in a detectable structural change or loss of enzymatic activity. Thus, the introduction of a relatively bulky maleimide group at Cys-532 has specific and far-reaching effects upon the structure and function of the ATPase."
