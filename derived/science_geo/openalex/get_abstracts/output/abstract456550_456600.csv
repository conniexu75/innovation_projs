Inactivation of parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is responsible for a familial form of Parkinson's disease and may be involved in sporadic forms as well. Trempe et al. (p. 1451 , published online 9 May) present the crystal structure of full-length parkin in an autoinhibited configuration. Guided by the structure, mutations were designed that activated parkin both in vitro and in cells. Because parkin is neuroprotective, the structure provides a framework for enhancing parkin function as a therapeutic strategy in Parkinson's disease."

(p. 1320 , published online 9 May) determined the kinds of particles on which cirrus ice crystals form by sublimating samples collected by research aircraft and analyzing the chemical and physical properties of the residual seeds. Most of the seed particles were either mineral dust or metallic."
https://openalex.org/W2020420606,"Spin optics provides a route to control light, whereby the photon helicity (spin angular momentum) degeneracy is removed due to a geometric gradient onto a metasurface. The alliance of spin optics and metamaterials offers the dispersion engineering of a structured matter in a polarization helicity-dependent manner. We show that polarization-controlled optical modes of metamaterials arise where the spatial inversion symmetry is violated. The emerged spin-split dispersion of spontaneous emission originates from the spin-orbit interaction of light, generating a selection rule based on symmetry restrictions in a spin-optical metamaterial. The inversion asymmetric metasurface is obtained via anisotropic optical antenna patterns. This type of metamaterial provides a route for spin-controlled nanophotonic applications based on the design of the metasurface symmetry properties."
https://openalex.org/W1981611866,"Symmetric Lorentzian and asymmetric Fano line shapes are fundamental spectroscopic signatures that quantify the structural and dynamical properties of nuclei, atoms, molecules, and solids. This study introduces a universal temporal-phase formalism, mapping the Fano asymmetry parameter q to a phase {\phi} of the time-dependent dipole-response function. The formalism is confirmed experimentally by laser-transforming Fano absorption lines of autoionizing helium into Lorentzian lines after attosecond-pulsed excitation. We also prove the inverse, the transformation of a naturally Lorentzian line into a Fano profile. A further application of this formalism amplifies resonantly interacting extreme-ultraviolet light by quantum-phase control. The quantum phase of excited states and its response to interactions can thus be extracted from line-shape analysis, with scientific applications in many branches of spectroscopy."

One of the major limitations preventing the development of Wolbachia for malaria control has been the inability to establish inherited infections of Wolbachia in anopheline mosquitoes. Here, we report the establishment of a stable Wolbachia infection in an important malaria vector, Anopheles stephensi. In A. stephensi, Wolbachia strain wAlbB displays both perfect maternal transmission and the ability to induce high levels of cytoplasmic incompatibility. Seeding of naturally uninfected A. stephensi populations with infected females repeatedly resulted in Wolbachia invasion of laboratory mosquito populations. Furthermore, wAlbB conferred resistance in the mosquito to the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum."
https://openalex.org/W2053065690,"Brain plasticity as a neurobiological reflection of individuality is difficult to capture in animal models. Inspired by behavioral-genetic investigations of human monozygotic twins reared together, we obtained dense longitudinal activity data on 40 inbred mice living in one large enriched environment. The exploratory activity of the mice diverged over time, resulting in increasing individual differences with advancing age. Individual differences in cumulative roaming entropy, indicating the active coverage of territory, correlated positively with individual differences in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Our results show that factors unfolding or emerging during development contribute to individual differences in structural brain plasticity and behavior. The paradigm introduced here serves as an animal model for identifying mechanisms of plasticity underlying nonshared environmental contributions to individual differences in behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2049657642,"The possibility that market interaction may erode moral values is a long-standing, but controversial, hypothesis in the social sciences, ethics, and philosophy. To date, empirical evidence on decay of moral values through market interaction has been scarce. We present controlled experimental evidence on how market interaction changes how human subjects value harm and damage done to third parties. In the experiment, subjects decide between either saving the life of a mouse or receiving money. We compare individual decisions to those made in a bilateral and a multilateral market. In both markets, the willingness to kill the mouse is substantially higher than in individual decisions. Furthermore, in the multilateral market, prices for life deteriorate tremendously. In contrast, for morally neutral consumption choices, differences between institutions are small."

https://openalex.org/W1980023069,"Global sulfate production plays a key role in aerosol radiative forcing; more than half of this production occurs in clouds. We found that sulfur dioxide oxidation catalyzed by natural transition metal ions is the dominant in-cloud oxidation pathway. The pathway was observed to occur primarily on coarse mineral dust, so the sulfate produced will have a short lifetime and little direct or indirect climatic effect. Taking this into account will lead to large changes in estimates of the magnitude and spatial distribution of aerosol forcing. Therefore, this oxidation pathway-which is currently included in only one of the 12 major global climate models-will have a significant impact on assessments of current and future climate."
https://openalex.org/W1971977136,"γ-aminobutyric acid–mediated (GABAergic) inhibition plays a critical role in shaping neuronal activity in the neocortex. Numerous experimental investigations have examined perisomatic inhibitory synapses, which control action potential output from pyramidal neurons. However, most inhibitory synapses in the neocortex are formed onto pyramidal cell dendrites, where theoretical studies suggest they may focally regulate cellular activity. The precision of GABAergic control over dendritic electrical and biochemical signaling is unknown. By using cell type-specific optical stimulation in combination with two-photon calcium (Ca2+) imaging, we show that somatostatin-expressing interneurons exert compartmentalized control over postsynaptic Ca2+ signals within individual dendritic spines. This highly focal inhibitory action is mediated by a subset of GABAergic synapses that directly target spine heads. GABAergic inhibition thus participates in localized control of dendritic electrical and biochemical signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1991259997,"Exosomes are nano-sized vesicles produced by healthy and virus-infected cells. Exosomes derived from infected cells have been shown to contain viral microRNAs (miRNAs). HIV-1 encodes its own miRNAs that regulate viral and host gene expression. The most abundant HIV-1-derived miRNA, first reported by us and later by others using deep sequencing, is the trans-activation response element (TAR) miRNA. In this study, we demonstrate the presence of TAR RNA in exosomes from cell culture supernatants of HIV-1-infected cells and patient sera. TAR miRNA was not in Ago2 complexes outside the exosomes but enclosed within the exosomes. We detected the host miRNA machinery proteins Dicer and Drosha in exosomes from infected cells. We report that transport of TAR RNA from the nucleus into exosomes is a CRM1 (chromosome region maintenance 1)-dependent active process. Prior exposure of naive cells to exosomes from infected cells increased susceptibility of the recipient cells to HIV-1 infection. Exosomal TAR RNA down-regulated apoptosis by lowering Bim and Cdk9 proteins in recipient cells. We found 104–106 copies/ml TAR RNA in exosomes derived from infected culture supernatants and 103 copies/ml TAR RNA in the serum exosomes of highly active antiretroviral therapy-treated patients or long term nonprogressors. Taken together, our experiments demonstrated that HIV-1-infected cells produced exosomes that are uniquely characterized by their proteomic and RNA profiles that may contribute to disease pathology in AIDS.Background: Exosomes are extracellular vesicles that have been implicated in intercellular communication.Results: Exosomes that originate from human cells infected with HIV-1 contain virus-derived small noncoding RNA.Conclusion: Virus-derived small RNA present in exosomes exert functional consequences in naive recipient cells.Significance: Viral RNA molecules present in exosomes may be critical mediators of intercellular viral spread in infected hosts.

Viruses, upon infection, alter the host cell in ways that counter the host's innate immune response and promote their survival and replication. One critical host strategy to combat viral infections is RNA interference (RNAi), which selectively eliminates foreign nucleic acids (17Agrawal N. Dasaradhi P.V. Mohmmed A. Malhotra P. Bhatnagar R.K.

We found that there are abundant levels of extracellular TAR RNA in the cell culture supernatants of infected cells and in patient sera. We also found that although HIV-1-infected cell lines produce exosomes with TAR RNA, there were little detectable levels of viral mRNA in these exosomes. Our data demonstrate that exosomes isolated from culture supernatants of primary latently infected cells also contain TAR RNA. We provide evidence that exosomes derived from HIV-1-infected cells contain both 5′ and 3′ TAR miRNAs. Our proteomic analysis of exosomes derived from infected cells showed the presence of the viral proteins, such as Gag and Env. Within exosomes originating from HIV-1-infected cells, we detected Drosha and Dicer proteins, components of the miRNA machinery. Experiments using leptomycin B indicated that CRM1-mediated nuclear export of TAR RNA was required for the inclusion of TAR RNA in exosomes. Purification of exosomes from HIV-1-infected primary cells using density fractionation gradients confirmed inclusion of TAR RNA in exosomes. Treatment of uninfected cells with exosomes purified from HIV-1-infected cells revealed that the exosome-delivered TAR RNA could confer a protective phenotype to recipient cells under conditions of cellular stress. Our data suggest that prior exposure of uninfected target cells to exosomes from infected cells made the target cells more susceptible to HIV-1 infection. Finally, we have also detected TAR RNA and specific components of the host miRNA machinery in serum exosomes of HIV-1-infected patient samples. The human embryonic kidney cell line 293T was obtained from the AIDS Reagent program and was maintained in DMEM complete medium. TZM-bl, a modified HeLa cell line expressing CD4 and CCR5, was obtained from the AIDS Reagent program and maintained in DMEM complete medium. Jurkat and CEM cell lines (uninfected T cells), J1.1 cell lines (HIV-1-infected T cells), ACH-2 (HIV-1-infected cell line), 8E5 (LAV-infected T cell line), and U937 (promonocytic) cells were grown in RPMI complete medium. HLM-1 (HIV-1-infected HeLa cell line/Tat−) cells were grown in DMEM complete medium. All cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2. A detailed description of all the cells used in this study with description of the viruses that were used to infect these cells is provided in supplemental Table 1. Bovine exosomes were excluded from culture media by ultracentrifugation of the FBS at 100,000 × g for 2 h prior to growth of cells for exosome isolation. OptiPrepTM (60% iodixanol w/v in water) was purchased from Sigma. Protein A/G beads were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Complete culture media consisted of RPMI 1640 or DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% l-glutamine, and 1% streptomycin/penicillin (Quality Biological).

LTNPs were defined as being HIV-1-infected but free of disease for a minimum period of at least 5 years, a CD4 count of greater than 500 at all visits, and no prior history of antiretroviral therapy. All samples were obtained after informed consent and were approved by the ethics board of George Washington University. Peripheral blood was obtained from healthy donors. CD4+ T cells (CD4TL) were then isolated from fresh PBMCs using negative selection kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada). Cells were solicited from anonymous, healthy volunteer donors who had signed an informed consent approved by the Centre Hospitalier de l'Université Laval research ethics review board. These cells were activated with PHA-L (1 μg/ml) and maintained in complete culture medium supplemented with IL-2 (30 units/ml) at a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml for 3 days. Then CD4TL was incubated with NL4–3BalEnv R5 virus (800 ng of p24 for 40 × 106 cells/ml) for 2 h, and after washes, activated CD4TL was added in complete RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with recombinant human IL-2 (30 units/ml) for 5 days. Exosomes were purified after 5 days. Jurkat and J1.1 cells were grown in appropriate media supplemented with 10% exosome-depleted FBS. Exosome preparations were made from 80 to 100 ml of cell culture supernatants (material produced from a culture of 1 × 106 cells per ml for 5 days). Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min. An additional centrifugation at 2000 × g for 10 min was used to pellet dead cells. The supernatant was collected and ultracentrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min to eliminate cell debris. This was followed by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 70 min two times to pellet the vesicular components. The resulting exosome pellet was then resuspended in an appropriate amount of PBS (15–150 μl). All spins were done at 4 °C. We included a filtration step prior to the ultracentrifugation steps through a 0.22-μm filter to account for contamination of our exosome preparations with other vesicles, and we determined that no significant change to total protein could be detected between filtered and unfiltered samples (data not shown). Protein levels in exosomes were determined by standard Bradford assay. All exosome preparations were quality controlled by electrophoresis in 4–20% Tris-glycine gels followed by Coomassie or silver staining in addition to determination of protein concentration. Exosomes were purified using ExoQuick reagent as per the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, for every 250 μl of patient serum, about 65 μl of ExoQuick reagent was added, and the two components were incubated overnight. After 24 h, the exosomes were centrifuged, and the pellets were resuspended in ∼10 times less volume than"
https://openalex.org/W2039341040,"Lymphocyte homing, which contributes to inflammation, has been studied extensively in the small intestine, but there is little known about homing to the large intestine, the site most commonly affected in inflammatory bowel disease. GPR15, an orphan heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptor, controlled the specific homing of T cells, particularly FOXP3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs), to the large intestine lamina propria (LILP). GPR15 expression was modulated by gut microbiota and transforming growth factor-β1, but not by retinoic acid. GPR15-deficient mice were prone to develop more severe large intestine inflammation, which was rescued by the transfer of GPR15-sufficient Tregs. Our findings thus describe a T cell-homing receptor for LILP and indicate that GPR15 plays a role in mucosal immune tolerance largely by regulating the influx of Tregs."

https://openalex.org/W2032682068,"Serum characterization and antibody isolation are transforming our understanding of the humoral immune response to viral infection. Here, we show that epitope specificities of HIV-1–neutralizing antibodies in serum can be elucidated from the serum pattern of neutralization against a diverse panel of HIV-1 isolates. We determined “neutralization fingerprints” for 30 neutralizing antibodies on a panel of 34 diverse HIV-1 strains and showed that similarity in neutralization fingerprint correlated with similarity in epitope. We used these fingerprints to delineate specificities of polyclonal sera from 24 HIV-1–infected donors and a chimeric siman-human immunodeficiency virus–infected macaque. Delineated specificities matched published specificities and were further confirmed by antibody isolation for two sera. Patterns of virus-isolate neutralization can thus afford a detailed epitope-specific understanding of neutralizing-antibody responses to viral infection."

https://openalex.org/W2038518561,"Four pairs of XX and XY gonads from Nile tilapia were sequenced at four developmental stages, 5, 30, 90, and 180 days after hatching (dah) using Illumina HiseqTM technology. This produced 28 Gb sequences, which were mapped to 21,334 genes. Of these, 259 genes were found to be specifically expressed in XY gonads, and 69 were found to be specific to XX gonads. Totally, 187 XX- and 1,358 XY-enhanced genes were identified, and 2,978 genes were found to be co-expressed in XX and XY gonads. Almost all steroidogenic enzymes, including cyp19a1a, were up-regulated in XX gonads at 5 dah; but in XY gonads these enzymes, including cyp11b2, were significantly up-regulated at 90 dah, indicating that, at a time critical to sex determination, the XX fish produced estrogen and the XY fish did not produce androgens. The most pronounced expression of steroidogenic enzyme genes was observed at 30 and 90 dah for XX and XY gonads, corresponding to the initiation of germ cell meiosis in the female and male gonads, respectively. Both estrogen and androgen receptors were found to be expressed in XX gonads, but only estrogen receptors were expressed in XY gonads at 5 dah. This could explain why exogenous steroid treatment induced XX and XY sex reversal. The XX-enhanced expression of cyp19a1a and cyp19a1b at all stages suggests an important role for estrogen in female sex determination and maintenance of phenotypic sex. This work is the largest collection of gonadal transcriptome data in tilapia and lays the foundation for future studies into the molecular mechanisms of sex determination and maintenance of phenotypic sex in non-model teleosts."

We studied the basic region-leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors and quantified bZIP dimerization networks for five metazoan and two single-cell species, measuring interactions in vitro for 2891 protein pairs. Metazoans have a higher proportion of heteromeric bZIP interactions and more network complexity than the single-cell species. The metazoan bZIP interactomes have broadly similar structures, but there has been extensive rewiring of connections compared to the last common ancestor, and each species network is highly distinct. Many metazoan bZIP orthologs and paralogs have strikingly different interaction specificities, and some differences arise from minor sequence changes. Our data show that a shifting landscape of biochemical functions related to signaling and gene expression contributes to species diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2084681492,"The β-glucosidase encoded by the td2f2 gene was isolated from a compost microbial metagenomic library by functional screening. The protein was identified to be a member of the glycoside hydrolase family 1 and was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and biochemically characterized. The recombinant β-glucosidase, Td2F2, exhibited enzymatic activity with β-glycosidic substrates, with preferences for glucose, fucose, and galactose. Hydrolysis occurred at the nonreducing end and in an exo manner. The order of catalytic efficiency for glucodisaccharides and cellooligosaccharides was sophorose > cellotetraose > cellotriose > laminaribiose > cellobiose > cellopentaose > gentiobiose, respectively. Intriguingly, the p-nitrophenyl-β-D-glucopyranoside hydrolysis activity of Td2F2 was activated by various monosaccharides and sugar alcohols. At a D-glucose concentration of 1000 mM, enzyme activity was 6.7-fold higher than that observed in the absence of D-glucose. With 31.3 mM D-glucose, Td2F2 catalyzed transglycosylation to generate sophorose, laminaribiose, cellobiose, and gentiobiose. Transglycosylation products were detected under all activated conditions, suggesting that the activity enhancement induced by monosaccharides and sugar alcohols may be due to the transglycosylation activity of the enzyme. These results show that Td2F2 obtained from a compost microbial metagenome may be a potent candidate for industrial applications."
https://openalex.org/W2076131887,"Emerging evidence suggests that tumor cells metastasize by co-opting stem cell transcriptional networks, although the molecular underpinnings of this process are poorly understood. Here, we show for the first time that the high mobility group A1 (HMGA1) gene drives metastatic progression in triple negative breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231, Hs578T) by reprogramming cancer cells to a stem-like state. Silencing HMGA1 expression in invasive, aggressive breast cancer cells dramatically halts cell growth and results in striking morphologic changes from mesenchymal-like, spindle-shaped cells to cuboidal, epithelial-like cells. Mesenchymal genes (Vimentin, Snail) are repressed, while E-cadherin is induced in the knock-down cells. Silencing HMGA1 also blocks oncogenic properties, including proliferation, migration, invasion, and orthotopic tumorigenesis. Metastatic progression following mammary implantation is almost completely abrogated in the HMGA1 knock-down cells. Moreover, silencing HMGA1 inhibits the stem cell property of three-dimensional mammosphere formation, including primary, secondary, and tertiary spheres. In addition, knock-down of HMGA1 depletes cancer initiator/cancer stem cells and prevents tumorigenesis at limiting dilutions. We also discovered an HMGA1 signature in triple negative breast cancer cells that is highly enriched in embryonic stem cells. Together, these findings indicate that HMGA1 is a master regulator of tumor progression in breast cancer by reprogramming cancer cells through stem cell transcriptional networks. Future studies are needed to determine how to target HMGA1 in therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2090514259,"Maternal consumption of a high fat diet during pregnancy increases the offspring risk for obesity. Using a mouse model, we have previously shown that maternal consumption of a high fat (60%) diet leads to global and gene specific decreases in DNA methylation in the brain of the offspring. The present experiments were designed to attempt to reverse this DNA hypomethylation through supplementation of the maternal diet with methyl donors, and to determine whether methyl donor supplementation could block or attenuate phenotypes associated with maternal consumption of a HF diet. Metabolic and behavioral (fat preference) outcomes were assessed in male and female adult offspring. Expression of the mu-opioid receptor and dopamine transporter mRNA, as well as global DNA methylation were measured in the brain. Supplementation of the maternal diet with methyl donors attenuated the development of some of the adverse effects seen in offspring from dams fed a high fat diet; including weight gain, increased fat preference (males), changes in CNS gene expression and global hypomethylation in the prefrontal cortex. Notable sex differences were observed. These findings identify the importance of balanced methylation status during pregnancy, particularly in the context of a maternal high fat diet, for optimal offspring outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2000641432,"The remarkably stable circadian oscillations of single cyanobacteria enable a population of growing cells to maintain synchrony for weeks. The cyanobacterial pacemaker is a posttranslational regulation (PTR) circuit that generates circadian oscillations in the phosphorylation state of the clock protein KaiC. Layered on top of the PTR is transcriptional-translational feedback regulation (TTR), common to all circadian systems, consisting of a negative feedback loop in which KaiC regulates its own production. We found that the PTR circuit is sufficient to generate oscillations in growing cyanobacteria. However, in the absence of TTR, individual oscillators were less stable and synchrony was not maintained in a population of cells. Experimentally constrained mathematical modeling reproduced sustained oscillations in the PTR circuit alone and demonstrated the importance of TTR for oscillator synchrony."

A set of monitored PM2.5 data from 31 stations, released for the first time by the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau, covering 37 days during autumn 2012, was processed using spatial interpolation and overlay analysis. Following analyses of these data, a distribution map of cumulative exceedance days of PM2.5 and a temporal variation map of PM2.5 for Beijing have been drawn. Computational and analytical results show periodic and directional trends of PM2.5 spreading and congregating in space, which reveals the regulation of PM2.5 overexposure on a discontinuous medium-term scale. With regard to the cumulative effect of PM2.5 on the human body, the harm from lower intensity overexposure in the medium term, and higher overexposure in the short term, are both obvious. Therefore, data of population distribution were integrated into the aforementioned PM2.5 spatial spectrum map. A spatial statistical analysis revealed the patterns of PM2.5 gross exposure and exposure probability of residents in the Beijing urban area. The methods and conclusions of this research reveal relationships between long-term overexposure to PM2.5 and people living in high-exposure areas of Beijing, during the autumn of 2012."

This leads to a predictive and flexible computational methodology linking, with a few simplifying assumptions, foam drainage, rupture, and topological rearrangement, to coupled interface-fluid motion under surface tension, gravity, and incompressible fluid dynamics. Our computed results match theoretical analyses and experimentally observed physical effects, including thin-film drainage and interference, and are used to study bubble rupture cascades and macroscopic rearrangement.

https://openalex.org/W2056379478,"The interplay of specific leukocyte subpopulations, resident cells and proalgesic mediators results in pain in inflammation. Proalgesic mediators like reactive oxygen species (ROS) and downstream products elicit pain by stimulation of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. The contribution of leukocyte subpopulations however is less clear. Local injection of neutrophilic chemokines elicits neutrophil recruitment but no hyperalgesia in rats. In meta-analyses the monocytic chemoattractant, CCL2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1; MCP-1), was identified as an important factor in the pathophysiology of human and animal pain. In this study, intraplantar injection of CCL2 elicited thermal and mechanical pain in Wistar but not in Dark Agouti (DA) rats, which lack p47phox, a part of the NADPH oxidase complex. Inflammatory hyperalgesia after complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) as well as capsaicin-induced hyperalgesia and capsaicin-induced current flow in dorsal root ganglion neurons in DA were comparable to Wistar rats. Macrophages from DA expressed lower levels of CCR2 and thereby migrated less towards CCL2 and formed limited amounts of ROS in vitro and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) in the tissue in response to CCL2 compared to Wistar rats. Local adoptive transfer of peritoneal macrophages from Wistar but not from DA rats reconstituted CCL2-triggered hyperalgesia in leukocyte-depleted DA and Wistar rats. A pharmacological stimulator of ROS production (phytol) restored CCL2-induced hyperalgesia in vivo in DA rats. In Wistar rats, CCL2-induced hyperalgesia was completely blocked by superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase or tempol. Likewise, inhibition of NADPH oxidase by apocynin reduced CCL2-elicited hyperalgesia but not CFA-induced inflammatory hyperalgesia. In summary, we provide a link between CCL2, CCR2 expression on macrophages, NADPH oxidase, ROS and the development CCL2-triggered hyperalgesia, which is different from CFA-induced hyperalgesia. The study further supports the impact of CCL2 and ROS as potential targets in pain therapy."

Although ER stress-induced apoptosis has been implicated in many diseases, the detailed mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we identified human transmembrane protein 214 (TMEM214) as a critical mediator of ER stress-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of TMEM214 induced apoptosis, whereas knockdown of TMEM214 inhibited ER stress-induced apoptosis. TMEM214 was localized on the outer membrane of the ER and constitutively associated with procaspase 4, which was also critical for ER stress-induced apoptosis. TMEM214-induced apoptosis was abolished by a dominant negative mutant of procaspase 4, whereas caspase 4-induced apoptosis was inhibited by knockdown of TMEM214. Furthermore, knockdown of TMEM214 inhibited the activation and cleavage of procaspase 4 by impairing its recruitment to the ER. Our findings suggest that TMEM214 is essential for ER stress-induced apoptosis by acting as an anchor for recruitment of procaspase 4 to the ER and its subsequent activation."

They are strikingly different from other forms of vertebrate integument such as scales, skin, and hair. Until recently, evolutionary hypotheses envisioned their origin through elongation of broad, flat scales driven by selection for aerial locomotion such as gliding or flapping flight. Over the course of the past two decades, fossil discoveries, especially from northeast China, have revealed that the early precursors of feathers were filament-like rather than expanded scales and that branched pinnate feathers of modern aspect predate the origin of active flight. The revolution in our understanding of feather evolution continues, driven by rapid fossil discoveries and by new information from the study of extant birds."

The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) 2The abbreviations used are:RAS, renin-angiotensin system; ACE, angiotensin converting enzyme; AngII, angiotensin II; AT1, type 1 angiotensin II receptor; B2, type 2 bradykinin receptor; BK, bradykinin; BRET, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; HA, influenza virus hemagglutinin; KKS, kallikrein-kinin system; RFU, relative fluorescence unit; RLU, relative luminescence units; RLuc, Renilla luciferase; SII, [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]-AngII; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cells; Sar, sarcosine. is a critical regulator of vascular tone and volume homeostasis and an important therapeutic target in hypertension and congestive heart failure (1Schmaier A.H. The kallikrein-kinin and the renin-angiotensin systems have a multilayered interaction.Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2003; 285: R1-R13Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In response to a drop in systemic blood pressure, renin, a protease produced in the juxtaglomerular apparatus of the kidney, converts circulating angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is in turn cleaved by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) to generate the biologically active peptide, Ang[1–8] or angiotensin II (AngII). Most of the physiological effects of AngII are mediated by G protein-coupled type 1 angiotensin II (AT1) receptors (2Oliveira L. Costa-Neto C.M. Nakaie C.R. Schreier S. Shimuta S.I. Paiva A.C.

Pleiotropic AT1 receptor signaling pathways mediating physiological and pathogenic actions of angiotensin II.Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 953-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). AT1 receptors couple primarily to Gq/11-phospholipase Cβ-protein kinase C (PKC) and G12/13-Rho-GEF (guanine nucleotide exchange factor) signaling pathways. In vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), AT1 receptors increase vascular tone by triggering phospholipase Cβ-inositol-trisphosphate-dependent intracellular calcium release and calcium-dependent contraction. In the adrenal cortex, AngII stimulates production of aldosterone, a potent mineralocorticoid that promotes renal sodium retention to expand blood volume. Clinically, prolonged activation of the AT1 receptor has been associated with hypertension, arrhythmia, and progression of diabetic nephropathy (5Zaman M.A. Oparil S. Calhoun D.A.

Cardiol. 2005; 45: 1832-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). The parallel kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) also plays diverse roles in the regulation of vascular tone, tissue inflammation, coagulation, and pain (7Sainz I.M. Pixley R.A. Colman R.W. Fifty years of research on the plasma kallikrein-kinin system. From protein structure and function to cell biology and in vivo pathophysiology.Thromb. Haemost. 2007; 98: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Two forms of the KKS exist in humans, the tissue KKS and plasma KKS. Tissue kallikrein is primarily expressed in the kidney, vascular system, brain, and pancreas, where it acts on low molecular weight kininogen to release bradykinin (BK). The plasma KKS consists of factor XII, prekallikrein, and high molecular weight kininogen. It is responsible for the activation of the intrinsic blood-clotting pathway (8Schmaier A.H. Assembly, activation, and physiologic influence of the plasma kallikrein/kinin system.Int. Immunopharmacol. 2008; 8: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The cellular effects of KKS are thought to reflect primarily the action of BK, a peptide hormone that produces proinflammatory and vasodilatory effects by activating two cell surface G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the B1 and B2 bradykinin receptors (9Mombouli J.V. Vanhoutte P.M. Kinins and endothelial control of vascular smooth muscle.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 679-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). B2 receptors are constitutively expressed in a majority of tissues and are particularly abundant in endothelium and VSMC (10Hermann A. Arnhold M. Kresse H. Neth P. Fink E. Expression of components of the kallikrein-kinin system in human cell lines.Immunopharmacology. 1999; 45: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The B1 receptor is generally not expressed under physiological conditions but can be induced by inflammation, diabetes mellitus, and genetic deletion of the B2 receptor (11Schremmer-Danninger E. Offner A. Siebeck M. Roscher A.A. B1 bradykinin receptors and carboxypeptidase M are both up-regulated in the aorta of pigs after LPS infusion.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Vasoactive potential of the B1 bradykinin receptor in normotension and hypertension.Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). B2 receptors couple to the Gq/11-phospholipase Cβ-PKC signaling pathway to promote calcium entry and to Gi/o proteins leading to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase-cAMP signaling (9Mombouli J.V. Vanhoutte P.M. Kinins and endothelial control of vascular smooth muscle.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 679-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Like the majority of GPCRs, desensitization and sequestration of AT1 and B2 receptors is mediated by arrestins, which bind to ligand activated receptors and target them to clathrin-coated pits for endocytosis (14Kohout T.A. Lin F.S. Perry S.J. Conner D.A. Lefkowitz R.J. β-Arrestin 1 and 2 differentially regulate heptahelical receptor signaling and trafficking.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 1601-1606PubMed Google Scholar, 15Simaan M. Bédard-Goulet S. Fessart D. Gratton J.P. Laporte S.A. Dissociation of β-arrestin from internalized bradykinin B2 receptor is necessary for receptor recycling and resensitization.Cell. Signal. 2005; 17: 1074-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The KKS interfaces with the RAS at multiple levels (1Schmaier A.H. The kallikrein-kinin and the renin-angiotensin systems have a multilayered interaction.Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2003; 285: R1-R13Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 16Schmaier A.H. The plasma kallikrein-kinin system counterbalances the renin-angiotensin system.J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1007-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Plasma and tissue kallikrein can convert prorenin to renin. Conversely, ACE1, the protease responsible for processing angiotensin I to AngII also cleaves BK to its inactive fragment, BK[1–5]. Thus, factors that enhance the generation of AngII tend to dampen BK signaling. Not surprisingly, given this reciprocal regulation, the KKS and RAS exert opposing effects in the regulation of vascular tone. AngII causes VSMC constriction and promotes hypertension, whereas under normal physiological conditions, BK stimulates endothelial nitric oxide synthase, leading to relaxation of the underlying VSMC and vasodilation (17Kichuk M.R. Seyedi N. Zhang X. Marboe C.C. Michler R.E. Addonizio L.J. Kaley G. Nasjletti A. Hintze T.H.

Jaffa A.A. Margolius H.S. Bradykinin B2 receptor modulates renal prostaglandin E2 and nitric oxide.Hypertension. 1997; 29: 757-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Nitric oxide from endothelial cells also inhibits VSMC and renal mesangial cell proliferation (19Garg U.C. Hassid A. Nitric oxide-generating vasodilators and 8-bromo-cyclic guanosine monophosphate inhibit mitogenesis and proliferation of cultured rat vascular smooth muscle cells.J. Clin.

Physiol. 1989; 257: F60-F66PubMed Google Scholar). However, in the setting of vascular injury and endothelial denudation, BK can act directly on VSMC to induce their contraction and activate multiple signaling pathways in a manner similar to vasoconstrictors like AngII (21Briner V.A. Tsai P. Schrier R.W. Bradykinin. Potential for vascular constriction in the presence of endothelial injury.Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: F322-F327PubMed Google Scholar). Another potential mechanism for cross-regulation of the RAS and KKS is through the formation of GPCR hetero-oligomers (22Devi L. Heterodimerization of G-protein-coupled receptors. Pharmacology, signaling, and trafficking.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 532-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 23Angers S. Salahpour A. Bouvier M. Dimerization. An emerging concept for G protein-coupled receptor ontogeny and function.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 409-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Although their existence has been questioned (24Hansen J.L. Hansen J.T. Speerschneider T. Lyngsø C. Erikstrup N. Burstein E.S. Weiner D.M. Walther T. Makita N. Iiri T. Merten N. Kostenis E.

Endocrinol. 2009; 302: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), substantial evidence has emerged supporting the hypothesis that AT1 and B2 receptors form both homo- and heterodimers (26AbdAlla S. Abdel-Baset A. Lother H. el Massiery A. Quitterer U. Mesangial AT1/B2 receptor heterodimers contribute to angiotensin II hyperresponsiveness in experimental hypertension.J. Mol.

Commun. 2011; 409: 544-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although it is clear that many, if not most, GPCRs can signal as monomeric entities (28Whorton M.R. Bokoch M.P. Rasmussen S.G. Huang B. Zare R.N. Kobilka B. Sunahara R.K. A monomeric G protein-coupled receptor isolated in a high density lipoprotein particle efficiently activates its G protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

U.S.A. 2007; 104: 10859-10864Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), it is also clear that the assembly of GPCR homo- and heterodimers can modulate many aspects of GPCR signaling through lateral allosteric effects generated by contact between the transmembrane and intracellular domains of GPCRs that imposes steric constraints on the dimer partner (30Kenakin T.

Rev. 2010; 62: 265-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Trafficking of nascent receptors to the plasma membrane, ligand binding affinity, G protein-coupling efficiency, downstream signaling, and endocytosis of activated receptors are all influenced by the formation of receptor multimers (31Margeta-Mitrovic M.

In the case of the AT1 and B2 receptors, heterodimer formation reportedly sensitizes vascular cells to AngII signaling (35AbdAlla S. Lother H. Quitterer U. AT1-receptor heterodimers show enhanced G-protein activation and altered receptor sequestration.Nature. 2000; 407: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), leading to exaggerated pressor responses in experimental hypertension and human preeclampsia (26AbdAlla S.

Targeting the RAS is a mainstay of treatment for hypertension, congestive heart failure, and diabetic nephropathy. Several classes of drug are in clinical use, including direct renin inhibitors, ACE inhibitors, and small molecule AT1 receptor antagonists, each of which would be expected to have different effects on the complex interplay that occurs between the RAS and KKS (25Lyngsø C. Erikstrup N. Hansen J.L. Functional interactions between 7TM receptors in the renin-angiotensin system. Dimerization or crosstalk?.Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2009; 302: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Recently, a novel class of biased AT1 receptor ligand that antagonizes AT1 receptor-G protein signaling while simultaneously acting as an agonist for arrestin recruitment and receptor internalization has been advanced as a potential therapeutic for congestive heart failure (37Boerrigter G. Soergel D.G. Violin J.D. Lark M.W. Burnett Jr., J.C.

The prototypic arrestin pathway-selective AT1 receptor agonist is [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]-AngII (SII (39Thomas W.G. Qian H. Chang C.S. Karnik S. Agonist-induced phosphorylation of the angiotensin II (AT(1A)) receptor requires generation of a conformation that is distinct from the inositol phosphate-signaling state.J. Biol.

Independent β-arrestin 2 and G protein-mediated pathways for angiotensin II activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 10782-10787Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar)). In vitro, SII acts as a weak partial agonist for AT1 receptor coupling to its G protein effectors while retaining near native ability to recruit arrestins (41Saulière A. Bellot M. Paris H. Denis C. Finana F. Hansen J.T. Altié M.F. Seguelas M.H. Pathak A. Hansen J.L. Sénard J.M. Galés C. Deciphering biased-agonism complexity reveals a new active AT1 receptor entity.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2012; 8: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This “bias” toward arrestin coupling permits SII to induce AT1 receptor internalization and activate arrestin-dependent signaling pathways independent of detectable G protein signaling (40Wei H. Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Karnik S.S. Hunyady L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Independent β-arrestin 2 and G protein-mediated pathways for angiotensin II activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 10782-10787Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). In this study we examined the effects of SII on AngII and BK signaling in primary aortic VSMC and in engineered HEK293 cell systems designed to permit us to dissect effects on ligand binding, G protein signaling, and receptor internalization. We find that unlike the neutral AT1 receptor antagonist losartan, SII antagonizes B2 signaling. This effect requires the AT1 receptor and results from co-internalization of AT1-B2 receptor heterodimers in response to SII. Thus, by binding to the orthosteric ligand binding site of the AT1 receptor, SII exerts lateral allosteric effects on B2 receptors leading to a reduction in BK responsiveness. These results demonstrate that arrestin pathway-selective biased AT1 receptor agonists represent a unique pharmacological entity that can produce effects not observed using conventional antagonists. Primary rat aortic VSMC were isolated from 75–100-g Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) as previously described (42Tan Y. Hutchison F.N. Jaffa A.A. Mechanisms of angiotensin II-induced expression of B2 kinin receptors.Am. J. Physiol. Heart. Circ. Physiol. 2004; 286: H926-H932Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). VSMC were maintained in minimum essential medium (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution (Sigma). Cells were fed every 2 days and subcultured upon reaching 90% confluence. Before each experiment, cells were seeded into multiwell plates as appropriate and incubated for 24–48 h in serum-free growth medium supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution. All experiments on primary VSMC were performed between passages four and nine. pcDNA3.1 expression plasmids encoding untagged angiotensin AT1 receptor (AGTR1), angiotensin AT2 receptor (AGTR2), bradykinin B1 receptor (BDKRB1), and bradykinin B2 receptor (BDKRB2) were obtained from the Missouri Science and Technology cDNA Resource Center (Rolla, MO). C-terminal yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-tagged receptor expression plasmids were constructed by cloning untagged receptor cDNAs into pEYFP-N1 (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Mountain View, CA). Receptor expression plasmids tagged at the C terminus with the Venus-enhanced YFP (43Nagai T. Ibata K. Park E.S. Kubota M. Mikoshiba K. Miyawaki A. A variant of yellow fluorescent protein with fast and efficient maturation for cell-biological applications.Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (2181) Google Scholar) were constructed by cloning untagged receptor cDNAs into a modified pIRES-puro3 vector containing the Venus tag in position 2098–2817. The vector, which contains a polypeptide linker (PVNSGGGGS) between the C terminus of the receptor and the Venus protein to improve receptor expression, was a gift from Michel Bouvier (University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada). The pcDNA3.1 plasmid encoding arrestin3 tagged at the C terminus with Renilla luciferase (RLuc) was also a gift from Dr. Bouvier. The pcDNA3.1 plasmid encoding hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged rat AT1A receptor was a gift from Marc G. Caron (Duke University, Durham, NC). HA epitope-tagged AT1A receptor expression plasmids were reconstructed by cloning the receptor cDNA into pcDNA5/FRT/TO (Invitrogen). A cell line carrying TET-inducible cDNA encoding HA-tagged AT1A receptors was generated by co-transfection of pcDNA5/FRT/TO-AT1A and the pOG44 plasmid encoding Flp-recombinase (1:9 pcDNA5:pOG44) into the HEK293 Flp-InTM host cell line (Invitrogen) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics). Doxycycline-inducible (1 μg/ml × 48 h) expression of HA-tagged AT1A receptors was documented by real-time polymerase chain reaction and anti-HA immunoblotting. A HEK293 line carrying tetracycline-inducible shRNA targeting the arrestin2 and 3 isoforms (CGTCCACGTCACCAACA AC) was generated as previously described (44Zimmerman B. Simaan M. Lee M.-H. Luttrell L.M. Laporte S.A. c-Src-mediated phosphorylation of AP-2 reveals a general mechanism for receptors internalizing through the clathrin pathway.Cell. Signal. 2009; 21: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Doxycycline-inducible down-regulation of arrestin 2/3 expression was documented by immunoblotting. HEK293 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. HEK293 cells, HEK293 FRT/TO arrestin2/3 shRNA cells, HEK293 FRT/TO AT1A cells, and GloSensorTM cAMP HEK293 cells (Promega, Inc., Madison, WI) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution. To maintain selection, hygromycin (200 μg/ml) and blasticidin (50 μg/ml) were added to the medium of HEK293 FRT/TO AT1A cells, and zeocin (50 μg/ml), blasticidin (50 μg/ml), and puromycin (50 μg/ml) were added to the medium of HEK293 FRT/TO arrestin2/3 shRNA cells. GloSensorTM cells were maintained in medium containing hygromycin (200 μg/ml). Transient transfection of HEK293 cells for intracellular calcium, GloSensorTM cAMP, receptor-arrestin bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET), and microscopy-based receptor trafficking studies was performed in 10-cm dishes (8 million cells/dish) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions with 6 μg of plasmid DNA per dish and 3 μl of FuGENE 6 per μg of DNA. Transient transfection of HEK293 cells for static BRET and radioligand binding studies was performed in 35-mm multi-well plates (1 million cells/well) in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution. Plasmid DNA (1.5 μg total per well) was diluted in 100 μl of serum-free DMEM and mixed with 100 μl DMEM containing 8 μg of polyethyleneimine. The DNA-polyethyleneimine mixture was allowed to stand for 15 min before adding to the cells, which were then incubated for 16 h before refeeding. VSMC were plated into black-wall clear-bottom 96-well plates (BD Biosciences) at a density of 20,000 cells/well and starved in serum-free DMEM supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution for 48 h before assay. Twenty-four hours after transfection, HEK293 cells were passed at 70–80% confluence onto collagen-coated black well/clear bottom 96-well plates, allowed to grow for 24 h, then placed in serum-free medium for 5–6 h before assay. Fresh FLIPR Calcium 5 assay reagent (100 μl/well; Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) was added, and plates were incubated for an additional hour before stimulation. Stimulations were carried out on a FLIPRTETRA screening system (Molecular Devices) with 470–495-nm excitation and 515–575-nm emission filters per the manufacturer's operating instructions (45Appleton K.M.

https://openalex.org/W2084573887,"Of late, decrease in mineral oil supplies has stimulated research on use of biomass as an alternative energy source. Climate change has brought problems such as increased drought and erratic rains. This, together with a rise in land degeneration problems with concomitant loss in soil fertility has inspired the scientific world to look for alternative bio-energy species. Euphorbia tirucalli L., a tree with C3/CAM metabolism in leaves/stem, can be cultivated on marginal, arid land and could be a good alternative source of biofuel. We analyzed a broad variety of E. tirucalli plants collected from different countries for their genetic diversity using AFLP. Physiological responses to induced drought stress were determined in a number of genotypes by monitoring growth parameters and influence on photosynthesis. For future breeding of economically interesting genotypes, rubber content and biogas production were quantified. Cluster analysis shows that the studied genotypes are divided into two groups, African and mostly non-African genotypes. Different genotypes respond significantly different to various levels of water. Malate measurement indicates that there is induction of CAM in leaves following drought stress. Rubber content varies strongly between genotypes. An investigation of the biogas production capacities of six E. tirucalli genotypes reveals biogas yields higher than from rapeseed but lower than maize silage."
https://openalex.org/W1968639855,"Elevated systemic pentraxin 3 (PTX3) levels appear to be a powerful marker of inflammatory status and a superior outcome predictor in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). As previous data imply that PTX3 is involved in vascular pathology and that adipose tissue mass may influence circulating PTX3 levels, we aimed to study the importance of adipose tissue expression of PTX3 in the uremic milieu and its relation to endothelial dysfunction parameters. Plasma PTX3 and abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) PTX3 mRNA levels were quantified in 56 stage 5 CKD patients (median age 57 [range 25-75] years, 30 males) and 40 age and gender matched controls (median age 58 [range 20-79] years, 27 males). Associations between PTX3 measures and an extensive panel of clinical parameters, including surrogate markers of endothelial function, were assessed. Functional ex vivo studies on endothelial status and immunohistochemical staining for PTX3 were conducted in resistance subcutaneous arteries isolated from SAT. SAT PTX3 mRNA expression correlated with plasma PTX3 concentrations (rho = 0.54, p = 0.0001) and was increased (3.7 [0.4-70.3] vs. 1.2 [0.2-49.3] RQ, p = 0.02) in CKD patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD), but was not significantly different between patients and controls. The association to CVD was lost after adjustments. SAT PTX3 mRNA levels were independently correlated to asymmetric dimethylarginine and basal resistance artery tone developed after inhibition with nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase (rho = -0.58, p = 0.002). Apparent positive PTX3 immunoreactivity was observed in both patient and control arteries. In conclusion, fat PTX3 mRNA levels are associated with measures of endothelial cell function in patients with CKD. PTX3 may be involved in adipose tissue-orchestrated mechanisms that are restricted to the uremic milieu and modify inflammation and vascular complications in CKD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2124792618,"Androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway remains the foremost target of novel therapeutics for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). However, the expression of constitutively active AR variants lacking the carboxy-terminal region in CRPC may lead to therapy inefficacy. These AR variants are supposed to support PCa cell growth in an androgen-depleted environment, but their mode of action still remains unresolved. Moreover, recent studies indicate that constitutively active AR variants are expressed in primary prostate tumors and may contribute to tumor progression. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of constitutively active AR variants on the expression of tumor progression markers. N-cadherin expression was analyzed in LNCaP cells overexpressing the wild type AR or a constitutively active AR variant by qRT-PCR, Western blot and immunofluorescence. We showed here for the first time that N-cadherin expression was increased in the presence of constitutively active AR variants. These results were confirmed in C4-2B cells overexpressing these AR variants. Although N-cadherin expression is often associated with a downregulation of E-cadherin, this phenomenon was not observed in our model. Nevertheless, in addition to the increased expression of N-cadherin, an upregulation of other mesenchymal markers expression such as VIMENTIN, SNAIL and ZEB1 was observed in the presence of constitutively active variants. In conclusion, our findings highlight novel consequences of constitutively active AR variants on the regulation of mesenchymal markers in prostate cancer."

C3 is the central protein of complement, whereas C3u is formed by the spontaneous hydrolysis of the thioester bridge in C3. During activation, C3 is cleaved to form active C3b, then C3b is inactivated by Factor I and Factor H to form the C3c and C3d fragments. The interaction of zinc with C3 was quantified using analytical ultracentrifugation and x-ray scattering. C3, C3u, and C3b associated strongly in >100 μm zinc, whereas C3c and C3d showed weak association. With zinc, C3 forms soluble oligomers, whereas C3u and C3b precipitate. We conclude that the C3, C3u, and C3b association with zinc depended on the relative positions of C3d and C3c in each protein.

https://openalex.org/W1543965807,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterial causative agent of tuberculosis, currently affects millions of people. The emergence of drug-resistant strains makes development of new antibiotics targeting the bacterium a global health priority. Pantothenate kinase, a key enzyme in the universal biosynthesis of the essential cofactor CoA, was targeted in this study to find new tuberculosis drugs. The biochemical characterizations of two new classes of compounds that inhibit pantothenate kinase from M. tuberculosis are described, along with crystal structures of their enzyme-inhibitor complexes. These represent the first crystal structures of this enzyme with engineered inhibitors. Both classes of compounds bind in the active site of the enzyme, overlapping with the binding sites of the natural substrate and product, pantothenate and phosphopantothenate, respectively. One class of compounds also interferes with binding of the cofactor ATP. The complexes were crystallized in two crystal forms, one of which is in a new space group for this enzyme and diffracts to the highest resolution reported for any pantothenate kinase structure. These two crystal forms allowed, for the first time, modeling of the cofactor-binding loop in both open and closed conformations. The structures also show a binding mode of ATP different from that previously reported for the M. tuberculosis enzyme but similar to that in the pantothenate kinases of other organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2094694359,"ADAMTS16 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) is a secreted mammalian metalloproteinase with unknown function. We report here that murine Adamts16 is co-expressed with the Wilms tumor protein, Wt1, in the developing glomeruli of embryonic kidneys. Adamts16 mRNA levels were significantly reduced upon transfection of embryonic murine kidney explants with Wt1 antisense vivo-morpholinos. Antisense knockdown of Adamts16 inhibited branching morphogenesis in kidney organ cultures. Adamts16 was detected by in situ mRNA hybridization and/or immunohistochemistry also in embryonic gonads and in spermatids and granulosa cells of adult testes and ovaries, respectively. Silencing of Wt1 by transfection with antisense vivo-morpholinos significantly increased Adamts16 mRNA in cultured embryonic XY gonads (11.5 and 12.5 days postconception), and reduced Adamts16 transcripts in XX gonads (12.5 and 13.5 days postconception). Three predicted Wt1 consensus motifs could be identified in the promoter and the 5'-untranslated region of the murine Adamts16 gene. Binding of Wt1 protein to these elements was verified by EMSA and ChIP. A firefly luciferase reporter gene under control of the Adamts16 promoter was activated ∼8-fold by transient co-transfection of human granulosa cells with a Wt1 expression construct. Gradual shortening of the 5'-flanking sequence successively reduced and eventually abrogated Adamts16 promoter activation by Wt1. These findings demonstrate that Wt1 differentially regulates the Adamts16 gene in XX and XY embryonic gonads. It is suggested that Adamts16 acts immediately downstream of Wt1 during murine urogenital development. We propose that Adamts16 is involved in branching morphogenesis of the kidneys in mice."

The present study aimed to investigate the effect of β-casomorphin-7 (BCM7) on the oxidative stress occurring in kidney tissue in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats and proximal tubular epithelial cells (NRK-52E) exposure to high glucose (HG) by using biochemical methods. There is a significant decrease in plasma insulin and a significant increase in plasma glucagon in the rats of diabetic group. Oral administration of BCM7 for 30 days to rats with STZ-induced diabetes resulted in a significant increase in serum level of insulin, and a decrease in the level of glucagon. Moreover, rats with STZ-induced diabetes had lower levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and total antioxidative capacity (T-AOC), higher levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the kidney than that in the control rats. The administration of BCM7 altered the changes of SOD, GPx, T-AOC, MDA and H2O2 in the kidney of diabetic rats. Furthermore, BCM7 alleviated high glucose-induced decreasement in SOD and GPx activity, increasement in MDA contents in the NRK-52E cells. BCM7 ameliorated the changes of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 levels in the kidney of diabetic rats and BCM7 lowered the levels of angiotensin (Ang)II in the kidney of diabetic rats and culture medium for cells. Moreover losartan (antagonist of angiotensin II type I receptor) lowered the high glucose-induced oxidative stress in the NRK-52E cells. Our results suggest that administration of BCM7 would alleviate high glucose-induced renal oxidative stress in vivo and in vitro, which may be associated with down regulation of the concentration of Ang II partly."
https://openalex.org/W2006446573,"The Sec pathway plays a prominent role in protein export and membrane insertion, including the secretion of major bacterial virulence determinants. The accessory Sec constituent SecDF has been proposed to contribute to protein export. Deletion of Staphylococcus aureus secDF has previously been shown to reduce resistance, to alter cell separation, and to change the expression of certain virulence factors. To analyse the impact of the secDF deletion in S. aureus on protein secretion, a quantitative secretome analysis was performed. Numerous Sec signal containing proteins involved in virulence were found to be decreased in the supernatant of the secDF mutant. However, two Sec-dependent hydrolases were increased in comparison to the wild type, suggesting additional indirect, regulatory effects to occur upon deletion of secDF. Adhesion, invasion, and cytotoxicity of the secDF mutant were reduced in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Virulence was significantly reduced using a Galleria mellonella insect model. Altogether, SecDF is a promising therapeutic target for controlling S. aureus infections."

Ngb gene-modified BMSCs were then injected at the SCI sites 24 hours after SCI. The motor functions of the rabbits were evaluated by the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan rating scale. Fluorescence microscopy, quantitative real-time PCRs, Western blots, malondialdehyde (MDA) tests, and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated UTP end labeling assays were also performed.Ngb expression in the Ngb-BMSC group increased significantly. A more significant functional improvement was observed in the Ngb-BMSC group compared with those in the other groups. Traumatic SCI seemingly led to an increase in MDA level and number of apoptotic cells, which can be prevented by Ngb-BMSC treatment.This study demonstrates that Ngb gene-modified BMSCs can strengthen the therapeutic benefits of BMSCs in reducing secondary damage and improving the neurological outcome after traumatic SCI. Therefore, the combined strategy of BMSC transplantation and Ngb gene therapy can be used to treat traumatic SCI."
https://openalex.org/W2079929902,"Identification of novel proteins that can potentially contribute to carcinogenesis is a requisite venture. Herein, we report the first biochemical characterization of the novel F-box and WD40 containing protein, FBXW4. We have identified interacting protein partners and demonstrated that FBXW4 is part of a ubiquitin ligase complex. Furthermore, the Fbxw4 locus is a common site of proviral insertion in a variety of retroviral insertional mutagenesis murine cancer models and Fbxw4 mRNA is highly expressed in the involuting murine mammary gland. To begin to characterize the biochemical function of Fbxw4, we used proteomic analysis to demonstrate that Fbxw4 interacts with Skp1 (SKP1), Cullin1 (CUL1), Ring-box1 (RBX1) and all components of the COP9 signalosome. All of these interactions are dependent on an intact F-box domain of Fbxw4. Furthermore, Fbxw4 is capable of interacting with ubiquitinated proteins within cells in an F-box dependent manner. Finally, we demonstrate that FBXW4 is mutated, lost and under-expressed in a variety of human cancer cell lines and clinical patient samples. Importantly, expression of FBXW4 correlates with survival of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Taken together, we suggest that FBXW4 may be a novel tumor suppressor that regulates important cellular processes."
https://openalex.org/W2032302875,"Based on a bioinformatics study, the protein MA4561 from the methanogenic archaeon Methanosarcina acetivorans was originally predicted to be a multidomain phytochrome-like photosensory kinase possibly binding open-chain tetrapyrroles. Although we were able to show that recombinantly produced and purified protein does not bind any known phytochrome chromophores, UV-visible spectroscopy revealed the presence of a heme tetrapyrrole cofactor. In contrast to many other known cytoplasmic heme-containing proteins, the heme was covalently attached via one vinyl side chain to cysteine 656 in the second GAF domain. This GAF domain by itself is sufficient for covalent attachment. Resonance Raman and magnetic circular dichroism data support a model of a six-coordinate heme species with additional features of a five-coordination structure. The heme cofactor is redox-active and able to coordinate various ligands like imidazole, dimethyl sulfide, and carbon monoxide depending on the redox state. Interestingly, the redox state of the heme cofactor has a substantial influence on autophosphorylation activity. Although reduced protein does not autophosphorylate, oxidized protein gives a strong autophosphorylation signal independent from bound external ligands. Based on its genomic localization, MA4561 is most likely a sensor kinase of a two-component system effecting regulation of the Mts system, a set of three homologous corrinoid/methyltransferase fusion protein isoforms involved in methyl sulfide metabolism. Consistent with this prediction, an M. acetivorans mutant devoid of MA4561 constitutively synthesized MtsF. On the basis of our results, we postulate a heme-based redox/dimethyl sulfide sensory function of MA4561 and propose to designate it MsmS (methyl sulfide methyltransferase-associated sensor)."

The interplay between lateral packing and molecular conformation was probed using a combined methodology based on the scaling analysis of the surface pressure isotherms and ellipsometry measurements of the monolayer thickness. The observed behavior is compatible with the one expected for an intrinsically disordered and highly flexible protein that is preferentially structured in a random coil conformation. At low grafting densities, ZipA coils organize in a mushroom-like regime, whereas a coil-to-brush transition occurs on increasing lateral packing. The structural results suggest a functional scenario in which ZipA acts as a flexible tether anchoring bacterial proto-ring elements to the membrane during the earlier stages of division.—López-Montero, I., López-Navajas, P., Mingorance, J., Rivas, G., Vélez, M., Vicente, M., Monroy, F., Intrinsic disorder of the bacterial cell division protein ZipA: coil-to-brush conformational transition.

https://openalex.org/W1991182380,"RNA interference (RNAi) is an evolutionally conserved posttranscriptional gene-silencing mechanism whereby small interfering RNA (siRNA) triggers sequence-specific cleavage of its cognate mRNA. Dicer, Argonaute (Ago), and either TAR-RNA binding protein (TRBP) or a protein activator of PKR (PACT) are the primary components of the RNAi pathway, and they comprise the core of a complex termed the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC)-loading complex (RLC). TRBP and PACT share similar structural features including three dsRNA binding domains (dsRBDs), and a complex containing Dicer and either TRBP or PACT is considered to sense thermodynamic asymmetry of siRNA ends for guide strand selection. Thus, both TRBP and PACT are thought to participate in the RNAi pathway in an indistinguishable manner, but the differences in siRNA binding mode and the functional involvement of TRBP and PACT are poorly understood. Here, we show in vitro binding patterns of human TRBP and PACT to siRNA using electrophoresis mobility shift analysis and gel filtration chromatography. Our results clearly showed that TRBP and PACT have distinct in vitro siRNA binding patterns from each other. The results suggest that monomeric TRBP binds to siRNA at the higher affinity compared to the affinity for own homodimerization. In contrast, the affinity between PACT and siRNA is lower than that of homodimerization or that between TRBP and siRNA. Thus, siRNA may be more readily incorporated into RLC, interacting with TRBP (instead of PACT) in vivo."

During cell division, segregation of replicated chromosomes is driven by their interaction with the spindle microtubules. The kinetochore, a protein megacomplex assembled on the centromeric region of a chromosome, mediates the interaction between the microtubules and the chromosome (1Przewloka M.R. Glover D.M.

Although the centromere is a designated region on each chromosome, usually spanning tens of kilobases up to several megabases in many eukaryote organisms, the underlying DNA sequence in general is neither necessary nor sufficient to specify centromere identity. Noticeable exceptions include the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, in which the microtubule binding sites are distributed throughout the chromosome instead of being restricted at a discrete single locus (2Gassmann R.

The alternative, which is more commonly utilized during vegetative growth, is the replenishment of CENP-A after DNA replication. Upon replication of the genome, preexisting CENP-A nucleosomes are inherited and partitioned between the replicated sister chromatids. Nascent CENP-A molecules are subsequently deposited to replenish the diluted CENP-A on each chromatid. De novo CENP-A (Cnp1) deposition in fission yeast requires the pericentromeric heterochromatin regions, whereas the propagation of Cnp1 chromatin does not (20Folco H.D. Pidoux A.L. Urano T.

Heterochromatin and RNAi are required to establish CENP-A chromatin at centromeres.Science. 2008; 319: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), indicating mechanistic differences between these two processes. Interestingly, there is marked variation among different organisms in the timing of CENP-A replenishment (e.g. during S phase in budding yeast (21Pearson C.G. Yeh E. Gardner M. Odde D. Salmon E.D.

Propagation of centromeric chromatin requires exit from mitosis.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 795-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar)). Two independent investigations have led to somewhat different conclusions for CENP-A/Cnp1 deposition in fission yeast. One suggests that two redundant pathways operate in S or G2 phase, respectively (24Takayama Y. Sato H. Saitoh S. Ogiyama Y. Masuda F. Takahashi K. Biphasic incorporation of centromeric histone CENP-A in fission yeast.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 682-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), whereas a recent study concludes that Cnp1 is replenished exclusively in G2 phase (25Lando D. Endesfelder U. Berger H. Subramanian L. Dunne P.D. McColl J. Klenerman D. Carr A.M. Sauer M. Allshire R.C. Heilemann M. Laue E.D. Quantitative single-molecule microscopy reveals that CENP-A(Cnp1) deposition occurs during G2 in fission yeast.Open Biol. 2012; 2: 120078Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Overall, a common feature seen in various species is that CENP-A replenishment in many cases may occur without a tight junction with DNA replication (26Nechemia-Arbely Y. Fachinetti D. Cleveland D.W. Replicating centromeric chromatin. Spatial and temporal control of CENP-A assembly.Exp. Cell Res. 2012; 318: 1353-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). An increasing number of factors have been implicated in CENP-A deposition and/or maintenance (reviewed in Ref. 27Mellone B.G. Structural and temporal regulation of centromeric chromatin.Biochem. Cell Biol. 2009; 87: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Cells deficient in one of these proteins commonly have a diminished level of CENP-A at centromeres. The role of each protein and their coalescence in the establishment and/or maintenance of CENP-A positioning await future studies. Much less is known regarding the spatial organization of CENP-A at the centromere, the mechanism for its establishment, and whether it is maintained throughout cell generations. Although CENP-A nucleosomes are found exclusively in centromeres, canonical H3 nucleosomes are also found in multiple organisms and carry a distinct covalent modification (histone H3 Lys-4 methylation) in fission yeast (28Cam H.P. Sugiyama T. Chen E.S. Chen X. FitzGerald P.C. Grewal S.I. Comprehensive analysis of heterochromatin- and RNAi-mediated epigenetic control of the fission yeast genome.Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 809-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). In fly and human cells, patches of CENP-A nucleosomes are interspersed with patches of canonical histone H3 nucleosomes on a stretched centromeric chromatin. This distinct pattern of CENP-A nucleosome positioning suggests that it may play a role in influencing higher order folding of centromeric chromatin and, furthermore, kinetochore geometry (9Blower M.D. Sullivan B.A. Karpen G.H.

Centromeric chromatin exhibits a histone modification pattern that is distinct from both euchromatin and heterochromatin.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1076-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Specifically, to initiate kinetochore assembly only on the side of the chromosome facing the spindle pole, the centromeric chromatin fiber needs to fold to bring linearly dispersed CENP-A patches together into a single compact region on the chromosome surface. Elaborate models have been proposed for the folding patterns of the chromatin fiber, such as the “amphipathic superhelix” (30Sullivan B.A. Karpen G.H. Centromeric chromatin exhibits a histone modification pattern that is distinct from both euchromatin and heterochromatin.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1076-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) and the “layered boustrophedon” arrangement (29Ribeiro S.A. Vagnarelli P. Dong Y. Hori T. McEwen B.F. Fukagawa T. Flors C. Earnshaw W.C. A super-resolution map of the vertebrate kinetochore.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 10484-10489Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Despite its potential importance for centromere and kinetochore assembly, detailed information about CENP-A nucleosome positioning is lacking. The underlying centromeric DNAs in many organisms, including humans and flies (reviewed in Ref. 12Torras-Llort M. Moreno-Moreno O. Azorín F. Focus on the centre. The role of chromatin on the regulation of centromere identity and function.EMBO J. 2009; 28: 2337-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), consist of very large DNA segments (hundreds of kilobases up to several megabases) of highly repetitive sequences, making it difficult to determine the sizes and precise positions of the CENP-A patches. The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is a suitable model for delineating CENP-A/Cnp1 nucleosome positioning in a regional centromere. In addition to its long history of usage for cell division and chromatin studies, several features of the fission yeast centromere make it particularly suitable for this study. Centromeres in fission yeast encompass a significant section of the chromatin (ranging from 40 to 100 kb), representing the common type of regional centromere. Yet, it is experimentally trackable in comparison with the much larger centromeres in other organisms (as large as megabases). The DNA sequences of fission yeast centromeres are known, and their functional domain organization is well defined (31Pidoux A.L. Allshire R.C. The role of heterochromatin in centromere function.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2005; 360: 569-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Each centromere consists of a central core domain, flanked by heterochromatic outer repeat domains. The central core region, directly occupied by Cnp1 and the kinetochore components, is composed largely of unique DNA sequences. Interestingly, reporter genes inserted in the central core are silenced stochastically, exhibiting the typical positional effect variegation (PEV) 2The abbreviations used are:PEV, positional effect variegation; 5FOA, 5-fluroorotic acid; WCE, whole cell extract; qPCR, real-time quantitative PCR. phenomenon (32Allshire R.C. Javerzat J.P. Redhead N.J. Cranston G. Position effect variegation at fission yeast centromeres.Cell. 1994; 76: 157-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of PEV in centromeres is not understood, the fact that variegation in gene expression occurs in the central core suggests that certain properties of the centromeric chromatin are regulated epigenetically. We previously determined the nucleosome positioning in the central core using tiling microarrays and found that nucleosomes irrespective of their histone composition are positioned in an orderly array, with a regular interval between each other (33Song J.S. Liu X. Liu X.S. He X. A high-resolution map of nucleosome positioning on a fission yeast centromere.Genome Res. 2008; 18: 1064-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Multiple lines of investigation, using quantitative fluorescence microscopy, have shown that on average, over 50% of total nucleosomes in centromeres contain Cnp1 (25Lando D. Endesfelder U. Berger H. Subramanian L. Dunne P.D. McColl J. Klenerman D. Carr A.M. Sauer M. Allshire R.C. Heilemann M. Laue E.D.

Bloom K.S. Salmon E.D. Point centromeres contain more than a single centromere-specific Cse4 (CENP-A) nucleosome.J. Cell Biol. 2011; 195: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), although a separate study showed a much higher number of Cnp1 molecules residing in centromeres, exceeding the full capacity of centromeric chromatin (35Coffman V.C. Wu P. Parthun M.R. Wu J.Q. CENP-A exceeds microtubule attachment sites in centromere clusters of both budding and fission yeast.J. Cell Biol. 2011; 195: 563-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 2 for details). We sought to determine the positioning of Cnp1 nucleosomes with the centromeric core. Here, we present evidence indicating that within a cell population, Cnp1 nucleosomes are flexibly positioned throughout the entire central core region within a cell population and that Cnp1 occupancy directly correlates with the silencing of the underlying reporter genes. We developed a pedigree analysis assay to track the reporter gene expression states at the individual cell level through multiple cell divisions. By this assay, we show that the positions of Cnp1 nucleosomes are mostly inherited epigenetically throughout cell generations but also undergo repositioning at a marked rate per generation. Yeast media and growth conditions were essentially as described (36Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Molecular genetic analysis of fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3140) Google Scholar). To visualize ade6 gene ON/OFF, YE/4S (or uracil dropout low adenine) media were used: Edinburgh minimal medium containing leucine, histidine, and lysine at 250 mg/liter each with adenine at 10 mg/liter. Also, to select for ura4 gene expression, 5-fluroorotic acid (5FOA; U. S. Biological Co.) was added to medium at 1 g/liter. All strains were grown at 25 °C.

To grow the cultures of the “tandem” strain for Cnp1 nucleosome immunoprecipitation, cells were first grown on EMM/3S/low adenosine or YE/4S/5FOA plates. To select for both ura4/ade6 on, colonies that were predominantly white on EMM/3S/low ade plates were picked and pooled and further amplified in 1,000 ml of EMM/3S/low ade liquid medium for 12 h at 25 °C. To select for both ura4+- and ade6+-OFF, colonies on YE/4S/5FOA plates that were predominantly red were picked and pooled and further amplified in 1,000 ml of YE/4S/5FOA medium for 12 h (about 3–4 generations). Both plates and liquid cultures were grown at 25 °C. Nucleosome immunoprecipitation was performed as described (38Jin C. Felsenfeld G. Nucleosome stability mediated by histone variants H3.3 and H2A.Z.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1519-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The chromatin was prewarmed to 37 °C for 5 min, followed by the addition of micrococcal nuclease (Roche Applied Science) to a final concentration of 100 units/ml. The digestion reactions were incubated at 36 °C with gentle rolling. At each time point, the reactions were immediately stopped by the addition of 20 mm EDTA to a final concentration of 2 mm. Then the nuclei were fixed with 0.2% formaldehyde for 1 min at room temperature and quenched in 0.1 m glycine for 1 min at room temperature. After centrifugation, the ChIP reaction was performed as before. Then the whole cell extract (WCE) sample DNA and immunoprecipitated DNA were subjected to size selection of mononucleosomal DNA and library construction for high throughput sequencing. Libraries of mononucleosomal WCE samples and ChIP samples were prepared for sequencing using the commercial genomic DNA sample preparation kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturer's protocol. All real-time PCR were done with an Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast Real-time PCR System. All samples were run in triplicate to ensure accuracy of the data, and their average was calculated. PCR of 45 cycles was done using the FINNZYMES DyNAmoTM HS SYBR Green qPCR kit (FINNZYMES catalog no. F-410). Primers were used at 0.35 μm for each experiment. The PCR product length was about 120 bp. ChIP analysis was similarly performed by quantifying the amount of DNA in ChIP and WCE samples, together with that in ChIP samples without antibodies (beads only), using the same apparatus and reagents. ChIP/WCE was determined by calculating their Ct value difference, followed by subtracting the Ct value difference between beads only and WCE. The primer sequences for qPCR are available upon request. Cell suspension is spread near the top of a thin YE/4S (without adding adenine) plate. For each pedigree, one cell is picked and moved to a designated position using a tetrad dissection microscope (Nikon), and the plate is incubated at 25 °C, allowing the cell to divide into two cells. One of the daughter cells is then moved onto a new designated spot. The same procedure is repeated in the ensuing generations, usually three cell generations in total, so that eight progeny cells are placed at specific positions, and their kinship can be deduced from the positions. The plate is incubated at 25 °C for 4–5 days, allowing colony formation and color developing on colony surface. Each Petri dish (10 cm in diameter) usually accommodates 10 pedigrees. Cell division numbers are counted as followed (see Fig. 7A for illustration). Generation I has one cell division, generation II has two cell divisions, and generation III has four cell divisions. Adding these divisions, the total number of cell divisions that lead to an eight-cell pedigree is seven. To score the switching events, the ancestor cell of each pedigree is first judged to be ade6+-ON or ade6+-OFF based on the color of the majority of the pedigree. This classifies the cell divisions into two groups, those amplify the “red” cells and those amplify the “white” cells. Judgment on the ancestor cells further allows the determination of the nature of a switching event (red to white or the reverse) and the stage at which it is most likely to occur. For example, pedigree 1 in Fig. 7A fits the interpretation that a red-to-white switch occurred in a cell division in generation II that produced the mother cell of colonies 3 and 4. On the rare occasions (about 5% of all pedigrees) that four red and four white colonies are found in an eight-colony pedigree, a discretionary decision is made based on the majority of the founding cells in the same experiment. The switching rates are calculated by dividing the total numbers of cell divisions that amplify the “red” or “white” cells (>500 for each experiment) by the numbers of the red-to-white or white-to-red switching events, respectively. We have previously demonstrated that the centromeric core is composed of an orderly array of nucleosomes. Specifically, for the cnt2 region, 27 nucleosome positions without distinction of the nucleosome types were identified (33Song J.S. Liu X. Liu X.S. He X. A high-resolution map of nucleosome positioning on a fission yeast centromere.Genome Res. 2008; 18: 1064-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To determine which positions are occupied by the Cnp1 nucleosomes, we performed immunoprecipitation of nucleosomes derived from micrococcal nuclease digestion of yeast chromatin, followed by high throughput sequencing of co-purified mononucleosomal DNA (Cnp1 nucleosomal DNA). In parallel, mononucleosomal DNA was also purified from the micrococcal nuclease digestion mixture prior to affinity purification (total nucleosomal DNA) and subjected to high throughput sequencing. The position and the relative abundance of each nucleosome were deduced by mapping sequenced DNA reads to the reference genome. The positions of total nucleosomes in the centromeric cores determined by high throughput sequencing (green line in Fig. 1) are highly similar to the results of our previous study using tiling microarray (33Song J.S. Liu X. Liu X.S. He X. A high-resolution map of nucleosome positioning on a fission yeast centromere.Genome Res. 2008; 18: 1064-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). All Cnp1 nucleosomal peaks (red line in Fig. 1) were identified within the centromeres, confirming the specificity of the immunoprecipitation. Cnp1 nucleosomes were identified in nearly all nucleosome positions within the central core. Several independent studies, including an earlier work of ours, have measured the Cnp1 molecule copy number within the centromeres of fission yeast, using GFP-based quantitative fluorescence microscopy, but have reached inconsistent conclusions (25Lando D.

However, the mechanism of TGF-β signaling in the modulation of EMT remains unclear. In this study, we found that TGF-β treatment resulted in elongation of mitochondria accompanied by induction of N-cadherin, vimentin, and F-actin in retinal pigment epithelial cells. Moreover, OPA3, which plays a crucial role in mitochondrial dynamics, was downregulated following TGF-β treatment. Suppression of TGF-β signaling using Smad2 siRNA prevented loss of OPA3 induced by TGF-β. Knockdown of OPA3 by siRNA and inducible shRNA significantly increased stress fiber levels, cell length, cell migration and mitochondrial elongation. In contrast, forced expression of OPA3 in ARPE-19 cells inhibited F-actin rearrangement and induced mitochondrial fragmentation. We also showed that Drp1 depletion increased cell length and induced rearrangement of F-actin. Depletion of Mfn1 blocked the increase in cell length during TGF-β-mediated EMT. These results collectively substantiate the involvement of mitochondrial dynamics in TGF-β-induced EMT."
https://openalex.org/W1989637780,"Colorectal cancer can be grouped into Dukes A, B, C, and D stages based on its developments. Generally speaking, more advanced patients have poorer prognosis. To integrate progression stage prediction systems with recurrence prediction systems, we proposed an ensemble prognostic model for colorectal cancer. In this model, each patient was assigned a most possible stage and a most possible recurrence status. If a patient was predicted to be recurrence patient in advanced stage, he would be classified into high risk group. The ensemble model considered both progression stages and recurrence status. High risk patients and low risk patients predicted by the ensemble model had a significant different disease free survival (log-rank test p-value, 0.0016) and disease specific survival (log-rank test p-value, 0.0041). The ensemble model can better distinguish the high risk and low risk patients than the stage prediction model and the recurrence prediction model alone. This method could be applied to the studies of other diseases and it could significantly improve the prediction performance by ensembling heterogeneous information."
https://openalex.org/W1968830926,"Many pathogenic microorganisms express fibronectin-binding molecules that facilitate their adherence to the extracellular matrix and/or entry into mammalian cells. We have previously described a Borrelia recurrentis gene, cihC that encodes a 40-kDa surface receptor for both, fibronectin and the complement inhibitors C4bp and C1-Inh. We now provide evidence for the expression of a group of highly homologues surface proteins, termed FbpA, in three B. hermsii isolates and two tick-borne relapsing fever spirochetes, B. parkeri and B. turicatae. When expressed in Escherichia coli or B. burgdorferi, four out of five proteins were shown to selectively bind fibronectin, whereas none of five proteins were able to bind the human complement regulators, C4bp and C1-Inh. By applying deletion mutants of the B. hermsii fibronectin-binding proteins a putative high-affinity binding site for fibronectin was mapped to its central region. In addition, the fibronectin-binding proteins of B. hermsii were found to share sequence homology with BBK32 of the Lyme disease spirochete B. burgdorferi with similar function suggesting its involvement in persistence and/or virulence of relapsing fever spirochetes."
https://openalex.org/W2122243827,"Defects in multiple coagulation factor deficiency protein 2 (MCFD2) are a cause of factor V and factor VIII combined deficiency type 2 (F5F8D). MCFD2 was also suggested to play an important role as an autocrine/paracrine factor in maintaining neural stem cell potential. The current work provided direct evidence that both amphibian and human MCFD2 can maintain stem cell pluripotency or stemness of rhesus monkey embryonic stem cells (rESCs) as basic fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) does. In most cases, MCFD2 had identical effects on stem cells as FGF-2. We investigated the possible mechanism of MCFD2 to support stem cell pluripotency by highlighting the effects of MCFD2 and FGF-2 on several signaling pathways in rESCs, namely MAPK, TGF-β, Wnt, and Akt, and 3 core transcriptional factors (Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2). In addition, some features of signaling pathways (MAPK and Akt), which are different from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), are found in rESCs, indicating that primate ESCs have unique signaling mechanisms. These results may shed light on the biological roles of MCFD2, the conserved protein family distributed in both vertebrates and invertebrates.

https://openalex.org/W1975059747,"Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), a multifaceted kinase, is abundantly expressed in the brain, including the olfactory bulb (OB). In resting cells, GSK3β is constitutively active, and its over-activation is presumably involved in numerous brain diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. However, the functions of the constitutively active GSK3β in the adult brain under physiological conditions are not well understood. Here, we studied the possible functions of GSK3β activity in the OB. Odor stimulation, or blockade of peripheral olfactory inputs caused by either transgenic knock-out or ZnSO4 irrigation to the olfactory epithelium, all affected the expression level of GSK3β in the OB. When GSK3β activity was reduced by a selective inhibitor, the spontaneous oscillatory activity was significantly decreased in the granule cell layer of the OB. Furthermore, local inhibition of GSK3β activity in the OB significantly impaired the odor habituation ability. These results suggest that GSK3β plays important roles in both spontaneous neural activity and odor information processing in the OB, deepening our understanding of the potential functions of the constitutively active GSK3β in the brain under physiological conditions."
