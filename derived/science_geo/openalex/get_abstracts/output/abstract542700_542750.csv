https://openalex.org/W1908864745,"Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is the second most prevalent histologic subtype of invasive breast cancer. Here, we comprehensively profiled 817 breast tumors, including 127 ILC, 490 ductal (IDC), and 88 mixed IDC/ILC. Besides E-cadherin loss, the best known ILC genetic hallmark, we identified mutations targeting PTEN, TBX3, and FOXA1 as ILC enriched features. PTEN loss associated with increased AKT phosphorylation, which was highest in ILC among all breast cancer subtypes. Spatially clustered FOXA1 mutations correlated with increased FOXA1 expression and activity. Conversely, GATA3 mutations and high expression characterized luminal A IDC, suggesting differential modulation of ER activity in ILC and IDC. Proliferation and immune-related signatures determined three ILC transcriptional subtypes associated with survival differences. Mixed IDC/ILC cases were molecularly classified as ILC-like and IDC-like revealing no true hybrid features. This multidimensional molecular atlas sheds new light on the genetic bases of ILC and provides potential clinical options."

The reconstruction uses cellular and synaptic organizing principles to algorithmically reconstruct detailed anatomy and physiology from sparse experimental data. An objective anatomical method defines a neocortical volume of 0.29 ± 0.01 mm(3) containing ~31,000 neurons, and patch-clamp studies identify 55 layer-specific morphological and 207 morpho-electrical neuron subtypes. When digitally reconstructed neurons are positioned in the volume and synapse formation is restricted to biological bouton densities and numbers of synapses per connection, their overlapping arbors form ~8 million connections with ~37 million synapses. Simulations reproduce an array of in vitro and in vivo experiments without parameter tuning. Additionally, we find a spectrum of network states with a sharp transition from synchronous to asynchronous activity, modulated by physiological mechanisms. The spectrum of network states, dynamically reconfigured around this transition, supports diverse information processing strategies.VIDEO ABSTRACT."
https://openalex.org/W1895144666,"The landforms of northern Gale crater on Mars expose thick sequences of sedimentary rocks. Based on images obtained by the Curiosity rover, we interpret these outcrops as evidence for past fluvial, deltaic, and lacustrine environments. Degradation of the crater wall and rim probably supplied these sediments, which advanced inward from the wall, infilling both the crater and an internal lake basin to a thickness of at least 75 meters. This intracrater lake system probably existed intermittently for thousands to millions of years, implying a relatively wet climate that supplied moisture to the crater rim and transported sediment via streams into the lake basin. The deposits in Gale crater were then exhumed, probably by wind-driven erosion, creating Aeolis Mons (Mount Sharp)."
https://openalex.org/W1942089699,"Stem cells reside in specialized microenvironments known as niches. During Drosophila development, glial cells provide a niche that sustains the proliferation of neural stem cells (neuroblasts) during starvation. We now find that the glial cell niche also preserves neuroblast proliferation under conditions of hypoxia and oxidative stress. Lipid droplets that form in niche glia during oxidative stress limit the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibit the oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). These droplets protect glia and also neuroblasts from peroxidation chain reactions that can damage many types of macromolecules. The underlying antioxidant mechanism involves diverting PUFAs, including diet-derived linoleic acid, away from membranes to the core of lipid droplets, where they are less vulnerable to peroxidation. This study reveals an antioxidant role for lipid droplets that could be relevant in many different biological contexts."

These results highlight an unusual mechanism of Pol IV transcription and suggest a “one precursor, one siRNA” model for the biogenesis of 24-nt siRNAs in Arabidopsis. In Arabidopsis, 24-nt siRNAs are the triggers for RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM), which plays central roles in repressing transposable elements (TEs) and maintaining genome integrity (Law and Jacobsen, 2010Law J.A.

RNA-directed DNA methylation: an epigenetic pathway of increasing complexity.Nature reviews. 2014; 15: 394-408Crossref Scopus (867) Google Scholar). The current model for 24-nt siRNA biogenesis is composed of several sequential steps. First, Pol IV recognizes heterochromatic regions, in part via SAWADEE HOMEODOMAIN HOMOLOG 1 (SHH1) (Law et al., 2013Law J.A. Du J. Hale C.J. Feng S. Krajewski K. Palanca A.M. Strahl B.D. Patel D.J. Jacobsen S.E. Polymerase IV occupancy at RNA-directed DNA methylation sites requires SHH1.Nature. 2013; 498: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and transcribes precursor RNAs. These precursor RNAs are then thought to be processed by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 2 (RDR2) to form double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs). The dsRNAs are primarily cleaved by dicer-like 3 (DCL3) to produce 24-nt siRNAs (Matzke and Mosher, 2014Matzke M.A. Mosher R.A.

Although Pol IV is clearly required for the biogenesis of 24-nt siRNAs (Herr et al., 2005Herr A.J. Jensen M.B. Dalmay T. Baulcombe D.C.

Cell. 2012; 48: 811-818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), the nature and characteristics of Pol IV-dependent transcripts remain poorly understood. The low transcription level at silent Pol IV loci and the efficient downstream processing by dicers has made Pol IV transcripts difficult to study. Recently, regions containing Pol IV-dependent transcripts were described in a dcl2/3/4 triple mutant that compromises downstream processing of siRNAs (Li et al., 2015Li S. Vandivier L.E. Tu B. Gao L. Won S.Y. Li S. Zheng B. Gregory B.D. Chen X. Detection of Pol IV/RDR2-dependent transcripts at the genomic scale in Arabidopsis reveals features and regulation of siRNA biogenesis.Genome Res. 2015; 25: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In that study, with the conventional assumption that Pol IV transcribes long precursors, RNA was fragmented before cloning, and sequenced reads were assembled into contiguous regions that corresponded to well-known siRNA-producing regions (Li et al., 2015Li S. Vandivier L.E. Tu B. Gao L. Won S.Y. Li S. Zheng B. Gregory B.D. Chen X. Detection of Pol IV/RDR2-dependent transcripts at the genomic scale in Arabidopsis reveals features and regulation of siRNA biogenesis.Genome Res. 2015; 25: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In the present study, we sought to identify the very low abundance Pol IV-dependent transcripts in a wild-type background, and to precisely characterize their start and end positions. We utilized a special method for RNA sequencing named PATH (parallel analysis of tail and head) that utilizes RNA adapters to capture both ends of any RNA greater than 27-nt with a 5′ monophosphate and a 3′ hydroxyl. Using PATH, we efficiently cloned Pol IV-dependent RNAs (P4RNAs) and found that they were only on the order of 30 to 40 nt in length. These P4RNAs mirror 24-nt Pol IV-dependent siRNAs in distribution, abundance, strand bias, and 5′-adenine preference, suggesting that they are direct precursors that often determine both the start position and strandedness of siRNAs. We also observed extensive incorporation of 3′-non-templated nucleotides preferentially at methylated cytosines on the template DNA strand, suggesting that Pol IV misincorporates and terminates at DNA methylated sites. Our results support a “one precursor, one siRNA” model for the biogenesis of Pol IV-dependent 24-nt siRNAs in Arabidopsis that creates a positive feedback loop between siRNA biogenesis and DNA methylation. We utilized an RNA cloning scheme called PATH that uses RNA ligation and gel-based size selection to capture RNAs larger than 27 nt that contain a 5′ monophosphate and a 3′ hydroxyl (Figure 1A, see Experimental Procedures). From a wild-type Columbia (Col) library, around 162 million PATH reads were obtained, of which ∼50 million could be mapped uniquely to the Arabidopsis genome (Table S1), and PATH reads with a minimal length of 27 nt were used for further analysis. Although the majority of PATH reads matched to structural RNAs (t/r/sn/snoRNA) (Table S1), a large number of reads mapped to previously defined Pol IV siRNA loci (Law et al., 2013Law J.A. Du J. Hale C.J. Feng S. Krajewski K. Palanca A.M. Strahl B.D. Patel D.J. Jacobsen S.E. Polymerase IV occupancy at RNA-directed DNA methylation sites requires SHH1.Nature. 2013; 498: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A and Table S2). In addition to their co-localization, the abundances of siRNAs and PATH reads were also highly positively correlated (Figure 1B). At Pol IV siRNA loci, in addition to the 24-nt siRNA peak that is still present in PATH libraries (Figure 1C), we observed a secondary peak of PATH reads (P4RNAs) that primarily ranged from 30 to 40 nt (Figure 1C). The size distribution of P4RNAs was different from other PATH reads in the libraries such as reads matching tRNAs and snoRNAs (Figure S1A). The short length of P4RNAs fits well with the specific preference of DCL3 for short (30 to 50 bp) dsRNA substrates (Nagano et al., 2014Nagano H. Fukudome A. Hiraguri A. Moriyama H. Fukuhara T. Distinct substrate specificities of Arabidopsis DCL3 and DCL4.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 1845-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), consistent with the hypothesis that these short P4RNAs serve as the precursors for siRNA biogenesis.Figure S1Size Distribution of PATH Reads and siRNAs, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Size distributions of PATH reads aligned to Pol IV siRNA loci, tRNA loci, and snoRNA loci were shown as the percentage of total read count of that class of loci.(B) In Col the siRNAs from Pol IV siRNA loci are predominantly 24-nt in size, while in the dcl2/3/4 mutant the peak of siRNAs is shifted to 21-nt.(C) Correlation of P4RNAs in dcl2/3/4 with siRNAs in Col at Pol IV siRNA loci.(D) P4RNAs and siRNAs share the same strand bias.

The plus-strand ratio was calculated as the abundance of reads matching to the plus strand divided by the total number of reads at that locus. To investigate the biogenesis of P4RNAs, we constructed small RNA and PATH libraries from null mutants of NRPD1 (encoding the largest subunit of Pol IV), NRPD/E2 (encoding the shared second-largest subunit of both Pol IV and Pol V), RDR2, as well as from the double mutants of DCL3 NRPD1 and DCL3 RDR2. We found that both siRNAs and P4RNAs were eliminated in all these mutant backgrounds, indicating a complete dependency of P4RNA biogenesis on both Pol IV and RDR2 (Figure 2A). Although the loss of P4RNAs in rdr2 mutants is somewhat unexpected given the assumed downstream function of RDR2 (Haag et al., 2012Haag J.R. Ream T.S. Marasco M. Nicora C.D. Norbeck A.D. Pasa-Tolic L. Pikaard C.S. In vitro transcription activities of Pol IV, Pol V, and RDR2 reveal coupling of Pol IV and RDR2 for dsRNA synthesis in plant RNA silencing.Mol. Cell. 2012; 48: 811-818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), this result is consistent with a previous report (Li et al., 2015Li S. Vandivier L.E. Tu B. Gao L.

Detection of Pol IV/RDR2-dependent transcripts at the genomic scale in Arabidopsis reveals features and regulation of siRNA biogenesis.Genome Res. 2015; 25: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and suggests that in vivo, Pol IV and RDR2 activities are tightly coupled. These results are also consistent with the earlier observation that RDR2 is in tight association with Pol IV subunits in vivo (Haag et al., 2012Haag J.R. Ream T.S. Marasco M. Nicora C.D. Norbeck A.D. Pasa-Tolic L. Pikaard C.S. In vitro transcription activities of Pol IV, Pol V, and RDR2 reveal coupling of Pol IV and RDR2 for dsRNA synthesis in plant RNA silencing.Mol.

To test if P4RNA biogenesis is dependent on downstream processing events by dicer proteins, we carried out additional siRNA and PATH library analysis from plants triply mutant for DCL2, 3, and 4. Consistent with a recent report detecting Pol IV dependent transcripts in a dcl2/3/4 mutant background (Li et al., 2015Li S. Vandivier L.E. Tu B. Gao L. Won S.Y. Li S. Zheng B. Gregory B.D. Chen X. Detection of Pol IV/RDR2-dependent transcripts at the genomic scale in Arabidopsis reveals features and regulation of siRNA biogenesis.Genome Res. 2015; 25: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), we observed a dramatically increased accumulation of P4RNAs in the triple mutant dcl2/3/4 (Figures 2B and 2C). In contrast, siRNAs levels were dramatically decreased in dcl2/3/4 at almost all loci (Figures 2B and 2C) and their sizes were shifted from predominantly 24 nt to predominantly 21 nt (Figure S1B). In addition, we observed that the abundances of the remaining siRNAs in dcl2/3/4 were tightly correlated with the abundances of siRNAs in wild-type (Figure 2C). We also found that the abundances of P4RNAs in dcl2/3/4 were strongly positively correlated with the abundances of siRNAs in Col (Figure S1C). As one example, P4RNAs and siRNAs showed a very similar enrichment at the boundaries of long transposable elements (Figure 2D). The accumulation of P4RNAs but reduction of siRNAs in dcl2/3/4 mutants are inconsistent with the interpretation that P4RNAs are merely longer, misprocessed siRNAs, and suggests that P4RNAs are indeed the precursors of Pol IV-dependent siRNAs. We also analyzed siRNA and PATH libraries from other DCL mutant combinations (dcl2/4, dcl3, dcl2/3, and dcl3/4) and compared these with dcl2/3/4. As previously reported (Henderson et al., 2006Henderson I.R. Zhang X. Lu C. Johnson L. Meyers B.C. Green P.J. Jacobsen S.E. Dissecting Arabidopsis thaliana DICER function in small RNA processing, gene silencing and DNA methylation patterning.Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 721-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), all dcl3 mutant combinations showed a shift in siRNA size from 24 nt to 21 and/or 22 nt (Figure 3A, top). PATH sequencing indicated that the over-accumulation of P4RNAs was negligible in dcl2/4; higher in dcl3, dcl2/3, and dcl3/4; and highest in dcl2/3/4, indicating that the P4RNA processing by DCL2 and DCL4 is less efficient than by DCL3 (Figure 3A, bottom). As a secondary confirmation of the accumulation of P4RNAs in dcl3 mutants, we examined small RNA northern blots for the presence of 30- to 40-nt signals. Using LNA probes to six different siRNA producing loci we indeed observed an RNA smear with larger sizes, along with an accumulation pattern (highest in dcl2/3/4) that matched the trend of the P4RNA level in our PATH libraries (Figures 3B and 3C) (Henderson et al., 2006Henderson I.R. Zhang X. Lu C. Johnson L. Meyers B.C. Green P.J. Jacobsen S.E. Dissecting Arabidopsis thaliana DICER function in small RNA processing, gene silencing and DNA methylation patterning.Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 721-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). In addition, we used a reverse transcription qPCR (real-time RT-PCR) approach to verify the very short nature of the P4RNAs. Because the peak of P4RNA abundance is 30–40 nt, whereas longer P4RNAs are much less abundant (Figure 1C), we reasoned that primers spaced about 40 nt from each other should amplify P4RNAs much more efficiently than those spaced slightly further apart. After normalizing for efficiency of DNA amplification, we observed a 100-fold higher level of PCR product when comparing a 36 bp versus a 58 bp amplicon at one locus, and 50-fold higher level of PCR product when comparing a 39 bp versus an 81 bp amplicon at a second locus (Figure S2A).Figure S25′ Modification and Size of Pol IV Transcripts, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Graphical representation of two Pol IV target loci.

Experiment was done in the dcl2/3/4 background. To directly test whether the longer P4RNAs might simply be misprocessed siRNAs that are loaded into AGO4, we performed AGO4 RNA-IP (RIP) in the dcl2/3/4 genetic background using antibodies against endogenous AGO4 and then characterized AGO4-associated RNAs with high-throughput sequencing. The AGO4 RIP result showed that even though there is a massive accumulation of longer P4RNAs and a reduction of 24nt siRNAs, AGO4 still selectively binds to the remaining 22-24 nt siRNAs but not the longer P4RNAs (Figure S2C), strongly supporting our model that P4RNAs are the precursors of the 24-nt siRNAs. Even though double-stranded RNAs are thought to be intermediates of siRNA biogenesis, it is known that at many loci in the genome, siRNAs are predominantly found on one strand of the genome but not the other (Lister et al., 2008Lister R.

In addition, these strand-biased clusters of siRNAs correspond to strand biased DNA methylation (Lister et al., 2008Lister R. O’Malley R.C. Tonti-Filippini J. Gregory B.D. Berry C.C. Millar A.H. Ecker J.R.

Molecular mechanism of action of plant DRM de novo DNA methyltransferases.Cell. 2014; 157: 1050-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). At these strand-biased siRNA clusters, we also observed strongly strand-biased P4RNAs in both Col and dcl2/3/4 (Figures 1D and S1D). These results suggest that our PATH libraries are primarily composed of single-stranded, Pol IV-derived strands, but not the RDR2-derived second strand. In support of this hypothesis, we used RT-PCR to amplify these strand-biased clusters, and indeed found that Pol IV/RDR2-dependent transcripts could be amplified equally from both strands (Figure S3). This suggests that RDR2 strands are likely present in vivo but are not cloned by the specific PATH sequencing technique employed in this study. The observation that P4RNAs and siRNAs show the same strandedness suggests that the Pol IV-derived strands, rather than the RDR2-derived strands, are strongly favored to become the final 24-nt siRNA products. In summary, results from siRNA and PATH libraries of mutants deficient in siRNA biogenesis or processing, together with the shared strandedness of P4RNAs and siRNAs, suggest that the 30 to 40 nt P4RNAs serve as precursors to Pol IV dependent siRNAs. Next we investigated the nature of the 5′ ends of P4RNAs. Given that our cloning method only captures RNAs with 5-monophosphates (Figure 1A), we sought to measure the proportion of P4RNAs containing this type of 5′ end. To address this, we used Terminator exonuclease to preferentially digest RNAs with a 5′-monophosphate. We subsequently measured the abundance of the remaining P4RNAs by real-time RT-PCR. Consistent with a recent study (Li et al., 2015Li S. Vandivier L.E. Tu B. Gao L. Won S.Y. Li S. Zheng B. Gregory B.D. Chen X. Detection of Pol IV/RDR2-dependent transcripts at the genomic scale in Arabidopsis reveals features and regulation of siRNA biogenesis.Genome Res. 2015; 25: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), Terminator treatment degraded the majority of P4RNAs at all loci tested (Figure S2B). Thus, while it is possible that subpopulations of P4RNAs have other end structures such as 5′-triphosphates, 5′-caps, or 5′-hydroxyl groups, it appears that the majority of P4RNAs contain 5′-monophosphates. Because our method did not include a fragmentation step that is typical in RNA-seq library protocols (Li et al., 2015Li S. Vandivier L.E. Tu B. Gao L. Won S.Y. Li S. Zheng B. Gregory B.D. Chen X. Detection of Pol IV/RDR2-dependent transcripts at the genomic scale in Arabidopsis reveals features and regulation of siRNA biogenesis.Genome Res. 2015; 25: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), it was possible to detect the 5′ nucleotide of P4RNA reads. We observed a strong enrichment of T/C (Y) at the −1 position (the nucleotide immediately upstream of the first nucleotide of the P4RNA read) and A/G (R) at the +1 position (beginning nucleotide of the read) (Figure 4A). Further, the four possible Y/R dinucleotides at the −1/+1 positions were by far the most enriched dinucleotides at the 5′ end of P4RNAs (Figure 4B). This pattern is very similar to that known for the transcriptional start sites (TSSs) of RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) in plants and other organisms and it is referred to as the “Y/R rule” (Cumbie et al., 2015Cumbie J.S.

This result suggests that Pol IV has retained this preference from its evolutionary ancestor Pol II (Ream et al., 2009Ream T.S. Haag J.R. Wierzbicki A.T. Nicora C.D. Norbeck A.D. Zhu J.K. Hagen G.

The short TSS like sequences at the 5′ ends of P4RNA, along with their very short nature does not support previous models in which Pol IV initiates transcription solely at the nucleosome-depleted promoter regions near the ends of transposons to produce long transcripts (Li et al., 2015Li S. Vandivier L.E. Tu B. Gao L. Won S.Y. Li S. Zheng B. Gregory B.D. Chen X. Detection of Pol IV/RDR2-dependent transcripts at the genomic scale in Arabidopsis reveals features and regulation of siRNA biogenesis.Genome Res. 2015; 25: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Instead, our results suggest that Pol IV can initiate transcription at many positions that resemble the Y/R features of Pol II TSSs, transcribing many short P4RNAs along the length of transposons. Because Pol IV transcripts feature Pol II-like TSSs, we also performed genome-wide profiling of Pol II occupancy in Arabidopsis via ChIP-seq in wild-type and different mutant backgrounds (nrpd1 and dcl2/3/4), and compared this with Pol IV ChIP-seq (Law et al., 2013Law J.A. Du J. Hale C.J. Feng S. Krajewski K. Palanca A.M. Strahl B.D. Patel D.J. Jacobsen S.E. Polymerase IV occupancy at RNA-directed DNA methylation sites requires SHH1.Nature. 2013; 498: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Our results showed that Pol II does not appear to access Pol IV loci even in the absence of Pol IV (nrpd1) (Figure S4A). Furthermore, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and small RNA sequencing of floral tissues from the weak Pol II mutant (nrpb2-3) did not reveal obvious changes in either DNA methylation or siRNA biogenesis (Figures S4B and S4C), which is consistent with our previous analysis of nrpb2-3 using leaf tissue (Stroud et al., 2013Stroud H. Greenberg M.V. Feng S. Bernatavichute Y.V. Jacobsen S.E. Comprehensive analysis of silencing mutants reveals complex regulation of the Arabidopsis methylome.Cell. 2013; 152: 352-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Therefore despite the proposed crosstalk between Pol II and the RdDM pathway (Zheng et al., 2009Zheng B. Wang Z. Li S. Yu B. Liu J.Y. Chen X. Intergenic transcription by RNA polymerase II coordinates Pol IV and Pol V in siRNA-directed transcriptional gene silencing in Arabidopsis.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 2850-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), our data suggest that Pol II and Pol IV occupy distinct territories on the genome. Arabidopsis 24-nt siRNAs are primarily loaded into AGO4 and are strongly biased toward having a 5′-adenine, which was previously shown to involve an AGO4 loading preference (Havecker et al., 2010Havecker E.R. Wallbridge L.M. Hardcastle T.J. Bush M.S. Kelly K.A. Dunn R.M. Schwach F. Doonan J.H. Baulcombe D.C.

Long C. et al.Sorting of small RNAs into Arabidopsis argonaute complexes is directed by the 5′ terminal nucleotide.Cell. 2008; 133: 116-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that P4RNAs, like siRNAs, also show a strong enrichment for 5′-adenine (Figures 4C, S5A, and S5B). Because the size of P4RNAs is approximately 30 to 40 nt, on average only one 24-nt siRNA duplex could be processed from each of these P4RNA precursors. This fact, coupled with the shared 5′ adenine preference and the shared strand preference, suggests that 24-nt siRNAs are preferentially cleaved from the 5′ portion of P4RNAs. Consistent with this hypothesis, DCL3 was shown to prefer short double-stranded RNAs (30 to 50 bp) that contain a 5′ adenine (Nagano et al., 2014Nagano H. Fukudome A. Hiraguri A. Moriyama H. Fukuhara T. Distinct substrate specificities of Arabidopsis DCL3 and DCL4.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 1845-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Therefore, our results favor a scenario in which the 5′-adenine preference of P4RNAs likely contributes to the 5′-adenine preference of Pol IV siRNAs. In addition, our results provide a plausible explanatio"
https://openalex.org/W2102025568,"Infections have been proposed as initiating factors for inflammatory disorders; however, identifying associations between defined infectious agents and the initiation of chronic disease has remained elusive. Here, we report that a single acute infection can have dramatic and long-term consequences for tissue-specific immunity. Following clearance of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, sustained inflammation and associated lymphatic leakage in the mesenteric adipose tissue deviates migratory dendritic cells to the adipose compartment, thereby preventing their accumulation in the mesenteric lymph node. As a consequence, canonical mucosal immune functions, including tolerance and protective immunity, are persistently compromised. Post-resolution of infection, signals derived from the microbiota maintain inflammatory mesentery remodeling and consequently, transient ablation of the microbiota restores mucosal immunity. Our results indicate that persistent disruption of communication between tissues and the immune system following clearance of an acute infection represents an inflection point beyond which tissue homeostasis and immunity is compromised for the long-term.

https://openalex.org/W2214645750,"Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase Vps34 complexes regulate intracellular membrane trafficking in endocytic sorting, cytokinesis, and autophagy. We present the 4.4 angstrom crystal structure of the 385-kilodalton endosomal complex II (PIK3C3-CII), consisting of Vps34, Vps15 (p150), Vps30/Atg6 (Beclin 1), and Vps38 (UVRAG). The subunits form a Y-shaped complex, centered on the Vps34 C2 domain. Vps34 and Vps15 intertwine in one arm, where the Vps15 kinase domain engages the Vps34 activation loop to regulate its activity. Vps30 and Vps38 form the other arm that brackets the Vps15/Vps34 heterodimer, suggesting a path for complex assembly. We used hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to reveal conformational changes accompanying membrane binding and identify a Vps30 loop that is critical for the ability of complex II to phosphorylate giant liposomes on which complex I is inactive."

However, the role of IFN-β in classic neurodegenerative diseases is unknown. We report that Ifnb–/– mice developed spontaneous pathologies mimicking major aspects of human neurodegeneration such as PD and DLB. Ifnb–/– mice had age-associated motor learning defects, neuromuscular deficiencies, and cognitive impairment. Ifnb–/– pathology was associated with LBs resulting from defective neuronal autophagy. Autophagy, a pathway that degrades long-lived proteins, organelles, lipids, and protein aggregates, is essential for neuronal homeostasis (Harris and Rubinsztein, 2012Harris H. Rubinsztein D.C. Control of autophagy as a therapy for neurodegenerative disease.Nat. Rev. Neurol. 2012; 8: 108-117Crossref Scopus (345) Google Scholar), and deleting neural autophagy-regulating genes leads to neurodegeneration (Hara et al., 2006Hara T. Nakamura K. Matsui M. Yamamoto A.

Our findings indicate a central role for IFN-β in neuronal homeostasis as a regulator of autophagy-mediated protein degradation and accentuates Ifnb–/– mice as a model for neurodegenerative diseases with α-synucleinopathy and dementia such as PD and DLB. We examined the effect of Ifnb gene deletion on motor coordination, learning, and grip strength. Ifnb–/– mice were significantly impaired in motor coordination and learning from 3 months compared to age-, sex-, and weight-matched wild-type (WT) Ifnb+/+ littermates and in latency-to-fall time in a wire-suspension test (Figures 1A and 1B ). We saw no differences in 1.5-month-old mice, suggesting that impaired motor coordination, balance, and grip strength were associated with age. During repeated motor-learning trials, retention time improved significantly in older Ifnb+/+ mice compared to Ifnb–/– mice from age 3 months (Figure S1A), showing that reduced motor-learning in Ifnb–/– mice was associated with aging.Figure S1Ifnb–/– Mice Show Behavioral Deficits, Neuronal Apoptosis, and Neurite Retraction, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Motor-coordination and -learning as assessed by seconds (s) spent on RotaRod for each trial.

We assessed somatosensory function with nociception cold- and heat-induced tail-flick tests. Latency to tail flick was significantly shorter in Ifnb–/– than Ifnb+/+ mice (Figures 1C and 1D), indicating hyperalgesia and defective nociception toward temperature-induced pain. Forced swimming tests found no differences between Ifnb–/– and Ifnb+/+ mice in swimming pattern, climbing effort, or immobility (Figure S1), so Ifnb–/– mice were not defective in locomotor activity in water in contrast to land. In water maze tests, Ifnb–/– mice had significant spatial- and memory-learning deficits that increased with age. During second tests, 6- and 12-month-old, Ifnb–/– mice had significantly fewer platform position crossings compared to Ifnb+/+ mice, indicating impaired reference memory (Figures 1E and 1F). Ifnb+/+ mice improved between the first and second tests at all ages except 12 months; Ifnb–/– mice did not improve, indicating impaired spatial learning. This was seen at all ages in Ifnb–/– mice measured by escape latency time in the second learning block (Figures S1B and S1C). Thus, although Ifnb–/– mice began with no major behavioral and cognitive defects, they developed age-dependent deficits with increased penetrance (Table S1). We investigated whether Ifnb–/– behavioral deficits were associated with neurodegeneration. Apoptotic cells were detected in 1.5-month-old Ifnb–/– granular layers of olfactory bulbs (Figure S1E), the granular dentate gyrus of hippocampus and the subventricular zone (Figure 1G), and the striatum (STR) caudate putamen including the ependymal cell layer in 12-month-old Ifnb–/– mice (Figure S1F), but not detected in Ifnb+/+ sagittal brain sections at similar ages. Apoptotic neurons increased in cultured Ifnb–/– primary cerebellar granular neurons (CGNs) and was reversed by recombinant (r)IFN-β (Figures S1G and S1H). Neurons were significantly reduced in the hippocampal CA1 region in 3- to 6-month-old Ifnb–/– mice and decreased in Purkinje cells of cerebellum. Glial cell counts were unchanged (Figures 1H and 1I). Supporting in vivo deficits in neuronal circuits, Ifnb–/– mice had reduced neurite network formation in the cerebellum, frontal cortex, and hippocampus granular cell layer (Figure 1J). This was confirmed in cultured Ifnb–/– primary cortical neurons (CNs) that had reduced neurite length per cell, mean length, and branch length per cell after 4 days, with restoration by rIFN-β (Figures 1K and 1L). A similar trend was seen after 21 days of culture (Figure 1K). Cultured primary Ifnb–/– CGNs mimicked the findings of CNs (Figures S1I and S1J). Thus, behavioral defects in old Ifnb–/– mice were associated with neuron death and reduced neurite circuits. We identified neuron-specific signaling and disease pathways caused by IFN-β deficiency with expression microarrays on highly pure (>98%) primary CGNs from Ifnb–/– and Ifnb+/+ mice plus or minus rIFN-β. Ifnb–/– neurons had 323 upregulated and 233 downregulated genes (Figures 2A, 2B, and S2A). rIFN-β treatment had differential effects on Ifnb+/+ versus Ifnb–/– CGNs with approximately equal numbers of downregulated and upregulated genes, but with relatively few overlaps (Figures 2C–2F). Multiple genes in the Ifnb–/– data set annotated as neuronal degeneration and the top ten pathways included cell death and neurological disorders. Genes in neurite formation and branching suggested compromised neurogenesis pathways in Ifnb–/– neurons, supporting the in vitro and in vivo phenotypes (Figures 2G and 2H). To investigate whether Ifnb and signaling via IFNAR affected neurogenesis in vivo, 3-month-old Ifnb–/– and IFNAR knockout (KO) mice (Ifnar–/–) and WT littermates were injected with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). Lack of Ifnb or receptor was associated with reduced neurogenesis in the hippocampus; dentate gyrus (Figure 2I), supporting the microarray data. IFN-β might directly affect prosurvival mechanisms as neurotrophin was among the top hits in gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (Table S2) and mRNA for the corticogenesis-regulating transcription factor Tox (Artegiani et al., 2015Artegiani B. de Jesus Domingues A.M.

Tox: a multifunctional transcription factor and novel regulator of mammalian corticogenesis.EMBO J. 2015; 34: 896-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) was reduced in Ifnb–/– neurons (Figure S2A). Increased apoptosis and reduced neurogenesis might contribute to impaired cognition and reduced hippocampal neuron numbers. GSEA of Ifnb+/+ and Ifnb–/– showed enrichment of genes associated with Huntington’s disease (HD), PD, AD, and prion diseases, and rIFN-β caused the Ifnb–/– profile to resemble WT (Figure 2J), supporting that common pathways link neurodegenerative diseases (Shulman and De Jager, 2009Shulman J.M.

Identification of differential expressed genes was performed individually within each experiment (in (A) p < 0.001; in B-C) p < 0.01); n = 3-5. We compared the Ifnb–/– neuronal gene profile with PD and HD mouse models (Fossale et al., 2011Fossale E. Seong I.S. Coser K.R. Shioda T. Kohane I.S. Wheeler V.C. Gusella J.F. MacDonald M.E. Lee J.M. Differential effects of the Huntington’s disease CAG mutation in striatum and cerebellum are quantitative not qualitative.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2011; 20: 4258-4267Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Three sets of differentially expressed genes were generated: differentially expressed in our data (p < 0.001), in our data and the HD model (p < 0.01), or our data and the PD model (p < 0.01) (Figures S2A–S2C; Data S1). Clustered genes in Ifnb–/– neurons and the HD model were both similarly and oppositely regulated. In contrast, most clustered genes in Ifnb–/– neurons and the PD model were regulated similarly, thus indicating a higher gene signature resemblance with PD than HD (Figures S2B and S2C). Based on the possible PD-related defect in Ifnb–/– neurons, we investigated nigrostriatal region integrity. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)+ fiber density and TH+ (dopamine-producing) neurons were significantly reduced in the STR and substantia nigra (SN) in Ifnb–/– mice versus WT (Figures 2K and 2L). NeuN+ and NeuN+TH+ cells were reduced in the ventral midbrain, which was correlated with reduced TH protein in basal ganglia (BG) in Ifnb–/– mice while total cells were unaffected (Figures 2M–2O). Among differentially expressed genes in Ifnb–/– neurons, 31 (p = 6.937e-4) were involved in regulating dopamine (DA) signaling (Figure 2P), which is involved in coordinating movements. DA signaling was also defective in the STR. No major differences were found in levels of DA or its metabolite homovanillic acid (HVA) (data not shown) in 3- to 6-month-old Ifnb–/– mice, but the DA metabolite dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) was significantly lower, thus significantly affecting DA/DOPAC and DOPAC/HVA ratios (Figure 2Q). These findings support the importance of IFN-β in regulating dopamine turnover and protecting dopaminergic neurons. Since Ifnb–/– mice defects overlapped with neurodegenerative diseases, particularly PD, we examined Ifnb–/– brain pathology. Gross anatomy was unchanged, but histological examination showed that Ifnb–/– neuron degeneration was associated with age-dependent α-synucleinopathy. Staining for α-syn was normal in 1.5-month-old Ifnb–/– brains; by 3 months, α-syn was found in LB-like structures in SN; however, α-syn staining intensity was reduced in 12-month-old Ifnb–/– mice (Figures S3A and S3B), likely reflecting degeneration of TH+ neuron (Figure 2L). Alpha-syn and large pathogenic aggregates of phosphorylated (pSer129) α-syn were found in TH+ DA neurons of SN (Figure 3A). At 3 months, α-syn aggregates were widespread in the STR, frontal cortex (Figure 3B), hippocampus, and cerebellum (Figures S3C and S3D). Alpha-syn+ aggregates and neurites were found sporadically in thalamus, the brainstem, and subthalamic regions of 3-month-old Ifnb–/– mice (Figures S3E–S3G). Neurons with α-syn+ LB-like structures increased with age (6- and 12-month-old) in Ifnb–/– mouse thalamus (Figures 3C and 3D). Whole-brain protein extracts from 1.5-month-old mice were not different from WT, but 3-month-old mice had significantly increased α-syn in insoluble fractions and no difference in soluble fractions (Figures 3E–3I). No difference in mRNA for α-syn was observed between Ifnb–/– and WT brains (Figure 3J); thus, the α-syn accumulation was not due to increased transcription. The insoluble α-syn fraction in the BG (including SN) was significantly higher in older mice, but the soluble fraction was still unchanged. A significant increase in high-molecular-weight dimeric, trimeric, and oligomeric α-syn were seen in Ifnb–/– mice, but with a decrease in tetramers. While aggregated α-syn oligomers are neurotoxic (Rockenstein et al., 2014Rockenstein E. Nuber S. Overk C.R. Ubhi K. Mante M. Patrick C. Adame A. Trejo-Morales M. Gerez J. Picotti P. et al.Accumulation of oligomer-prone α-synuclein exacerbates synaptic and neuronal degeneration in vivo.Brain. 2014; 137: 1496-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), α-syn tetramers are suggested to be the normal aggregation resistant conformation of the protein (Bartels et al., 2011Bartels T.

USA. 2011; 108: 17797-17802Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), possibly explaining the tetramer abundance in Ifnb+/+ mice. pSer129-α-syn, which is prone to form pathogenic fibrillar aggregates, was increased in Ifnb–/– mice (Figures 3K–3M). Ifnar–/– brains showed a similar pattern to Ifnb–/– regarding α-syn and pSer129-α-syn accumulation (Figure S3H). Blocking with α-syn96–140 peptide confirmed specific immunoreactivity for α-syn in Ifnb–/– brains. To ensure that lack of Ifnb did not generate crossreacting α-syn-independent aggregates, we generated Scna–/–Ifnb–/– double-KO mice (DKO). Ifnb–/– but not Scna–/– or DKO mice had α-syn+ aggregates or LBs (Figures S3I–S3K).Figure 3Ifnb–/– Mice Develop LBs with α-syn, Ubiquitin, and pTauShow full caption(A) IF of α-syn in SN of 6-month-old Ifnb–/– mice.

An additional goal of these projects is to engage and educate these volunteers. Thus, there are few barriers to participation resulting in volunteer observers with varying ability to complete the project’s tasks. To improve the quality of a citizen science project’s outcomes it would be useful to account for inter-observer variation, and to assess the rarely tested presumption that participating in a citizen science projects results in volunteers becoming better observers. Here we present a method for indexing observer variability based on the data routinely submitted by observers participating in the citizen science project eBird, a broad-scale monitoring project in which observers collect and submit lists of the bird species observed while birding. Our method for indexing observer variability uses species accumulation curves, lines that describe how the total number of species reported increase with increasing time spent in collecting observations. We find that differences in species accumulation curves among observers equates to higher rates of species accumulation, particularly for harder-to-identify species, and reveals increased species accumulation rates with continued participation. We suggest that these properties of our analysis provide a measure of observer skill, and that the potential to derive post-hoc data-derived measurements of participant ability should be more widely explored by analysts of data from citizen science projects. We see the potential for inferential results from analyses of citizen science data to be improved by accounting for observer skill."

Our work reveals how hierarchical adaptors and primed proteases orchestrate regulated proteolysis during bacterial cell-cycle progression. Regulated proteolysis is crucial for all life. For example, the timely destruction of key regulators by energy-dependent proteases during the eukaryotic and bacterial cell cycle drives replication and growth (King et al., 1996King R.W. Deshaies R.J. Peters J.M. Kirschner M.W. How proteolysis drives the cell cycle.Science. 1996; 274: 1652-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar, Konovalova et al., 2014Konovalova A. Søgaard-Andersen L. Kroos L. Regulated proteolysis in bacterial development.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2014; 38: 493-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Because proteolysis is irreversible, cells face the substantial challenge of stringently distinguishing specific proteins that are to be rapidly destroyed from many others meant to remain stable. In bacteria, energy-dependent proteases, such as the essential ClpXP protease, use accessory factors called adaptors to modulate substrate specificity (Gottesman, 2003Gottesman S. Proteolysis in bacterial regulatory circuits.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 565-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, Ades, 2004Ades S.E.

Adaptor proteins often work by binding directly to substrates and targeting them to appropriate proteases. One of the first characterized adaptors is SspB, which enhances ClpXP degradation of incomplete translation products tagged by the ssrA peptide by binding to the peptide tag and tethering the substrate to the protease, catalyzing immediate destruction (Dougan et al., 2003Dougan D.A.

In this case, the adaptor enforces rapid degradation by increasing effective substrate concentration through tethering (Kirstein et al., 2009Kirstein J. Molière N. Dougan D.A. Turgay K.

Gottesman S. Roles of adaptor proteins in regulation of bacterial proteolysis.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2013; 16: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Adaptor proteins can themselves be regulated by anti-adaptors, proteins that block adaptor activity during different growth or environmental conditions (Battesti and Gottesman, 2013aBattesti A. Gottesman S. Roles of adaptor proteins in regulation of bacterial proteolysis.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2013; 16: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The Gram-negative α-proteobacterium Caulobacter crescentus has a dimorphic life cycle wherein an obligate transition from a swarmer cell stage to a stalked cell stage is driven by degradation of key regulatory proteins (Poindexter, 1981Poindexter J.S. The caulobacters: ubiquitous unusual bacteria.Microbiol. Rev. 1981; 45: 123-179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Curtis and Brun, 2010Curtis P.D. Brun Y.V. Getting in the loop: regulation of development in Caulobacter crescentus.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2010; 74: 13-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The essential transcription factor CtrA inhibits replication initiation and is degraded by ClpXP during the swarmer to stalked cell transition (Quon et al., 1996Quon K.C. Marczynski G.T. Shapiro L.

Fuchs T. An essential protease involved in bacterial cell-cycle control.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5658-5669Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The destruction of CtrA promotes assembly of replication initiation machinery at the origin in stalked cells and drives the progression of the cell cycle (reviewed in Marczynski and Shapiro, 2002Marczynski G.T.

Synchronization of chromosome dynamics and cell division in bacteria.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2010; 2: a000331Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Similarly, the developmental regulator TacA, which activates transcription of genes involved in stalk biogenesis and polar development (Biondi et al., 2006Biondi E.G. Skerker J.M. Arif M. Prasol M.S. Perchuk B.S. Laub M.T. A phosphorelay system controls stalk biogenesis during cell cycle progression in Caulobacter crescentus.Mol.

The dynamic interplay between a cell fate determinant and a lysozyme homolog drives the asymmetric division cycle of Caulobacter crescentus.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 212-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), is degraded by ClpXP in a cell-cycle-dependent manner (Bhat et al., 2013Bhat N.H. Vass R.H. Stoddard P.R. Shin D.K. Chien P. Identification of ClpP substrates in Caulobacter crescentus reveals a role for regulated proteolysis in bacterial development.Mol. Microbiol. 2013; 88: 1083-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Degradation of both TacA and CtrA depends on the response regulator CpdR (Iniesta et al., 2006Iniesta A.A. McGrath P.T. Reisenauer A. McAdams H.H. Shapiro L. A phospho-signaling pathway controls the localization and activity of a protease complex critical for bacterial cell cycle progression.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Previous reconstitution experiments have shown that CpdR enhances degradation of some ClpXP substrates in a phosphorylation-dependent manner by acting as an adaptor to activate substrate recognition (Abel et al., 2011Abel S.

Cell. 2015; 59: 104-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, addition of the CpdR adaptor alone does not improve degradation of CtrA in vitro, but addition of two additional factors, RcdA and PopA, promotes degradation of CtrA by ClpXP in a second messenger and phosphorylation-dependent manner (Smith et al., 2014Smith S.C.

RcdA and PopA were originally identified as necessary for cell-cycle-dependent CtrA degradation in vivo (McGrath et al., 2006McGrath P.T. Iniesta A.A. Ryan K.R. Shapiro L. McAdams H.H.

Abel S. Folcher M. Nicollier M. Schwede T. Amiot N. Giese B. Jenal U. Second messenger-mediated spatiotemporal control of protein degradation regulates bacterial cell cycle progression.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, Ozaki et al., 2014Ozaki S.

Activation and polar sequestration of PopA, a c-di-GMP effector protein involved in Caulobacter crescentus cell cycle control.Mol. Microbiol. 2014; 94: 580-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Interestingly, orthologs of CpdR and RcdA are found in most α-proteobacteria, but PopA is restricted to Caulobacter and closely related species (Brilli et al., 2010Brilli M. Fondi M. Fani R. Mengoni A. Ferri L. Bazzicalupo M. Biondi E.G. The diversity and evolution of cell cycle regulation in alpha-proteobacteria: a comparative genomic analysis.BMC Syst.

Activation and polar sequestration of PopA, a c-di-GMP effector protein involved in Caulobacter crescentus cell cycle control.Mol. Microbiol. 2014; 94: 580-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), suggesting that CpdR and RcdA may work independently of PopA. How these factors mechanistically function to promote degradation of substrates by ClpXP has remained a mystery. Here, we show that a hierarchy of adaptors promotes selective protein degradation dependent on the degree of adaptor assembly with the key finding that RcdA is an adaptor that requires a primed protease. First, we identify a PopA-independent function for the RcdA adaptor in facilitating cell-cycle-dependent degradation of the developmental regulator TacA by the ClpXP protease. We reconstitute TacA degradation in vitro to show that RcdA and CpdR are necessary and sufficient to deliver the TacA substrate to ClpXP. Systematic dissection of TacA uncovers a minimal element that directs RcdA binding and a sequence motif needed for protease recognition. We find that RcdA contains a substrate-binding domain and a tethering motif that leashes the adaptor to ClpXP only when the protease is first primed by the CpdR adaptor. We find that these domains are modular and design chimeric adaptors with altered target specificity and protease selectivity. We identify additional RcdA-dependent ClpXP substrates, demonstrating that the RcdA adaptor can bind and deliver a range of substrates. Finally, we show how PopA works as both an adaptor and anti-adaptor of RcdA by inhibiting degradation of some substrates and promoting degradation of others, dependent on ligand binding. This work establishes a class of protease adaptors that tether substrates and additional adaptors selectively to a primed protease, revealing how an adaptor hierarchy enforces the selective protein destruction that drives the cell cycle. We previously identified TacA as a ClpXP substrate that requires CpdR for its cell-cycle-dependent degradation (Bhat et al., 2013Bhat N.H. Vass R.H. Stoddard P.R. Shin D.K. Chien P. Identification of ClpP substrates in Caulobacter crescentus reveals a role for regulated proteolysis in bacterial development.Mol. Microbiol. 2013; 88: 1083-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) (Figure 1B). During our characterization of this result, we found that expression of a nondegradable TacA allele (TacA-DD, Bhat et al., 2013Bhat N.H. Vass R.H. Stoddard P.R. Shin D.K. Chien P. Identification of ClpP substrates in Caulobacter crescentus reveals a role for regulated proteolysis in bacterial development.Mol. Microbiol. 2013; 88: 1083-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) resulted in cells with longer stalks compared to wild-type (WT) cells (Figure 1A), consistent with the role of TacA in stalk biogenesis. Cells lacking RcdA were previously reported to have increased stalk length (McGrath et al., 2006McGrath P.T. Iniesta A.A. Ryan K.R. Shapiro L. McAdams H.H. A dynamically localized protease complex and a polar specificity factor control a cell cycle master regulator.Cell. 2006; 124: 535-547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and quantitative measurements showed that these increased lengths were statistically indistinguishable from those in the TacA-DD strain (Figure 1A), suggesting that RcdA might be needed for proper TacA degradation. In accordance with this model, the cell-cycle-dependent degradation of TacA is lost in ΔrcdA strains (Figure 1B). Prior work suggested that RcdA requires the PopA protein for its biological functions, such as the cell-cycle-dependent degradation of CtrA (Duerig et al., 2009Duerig A. Abel S. Folcher M. Nicollier M. Schwede T. Amiot N. Giese B. Jenal U. Second messenger-mediated spatiotemporal control of protein degradation regulates bacterial cell cycle progression.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) (Figure 1B). Indeed, the regulated degradation of CtrA has been recently reconstituted in vitro, and PopA was necessary to forming a complex with both RcdA and CtrA as part of this process (Smith et al., 2014Smith S.C. Joshi K.K. Zik J.J. Trinh K. Kamajaya A. Chien P. Ryan K.R. Cell cycle-dependent adaptor complex for ClpXP-mediated proteolysis directly integrates phosphorylation and second messenger signals.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 14229-14234Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Furthermore, all ClpXP substrates that rely on RcdA for cell-cycle-dependent degradation also require PopA (Duerig et al., 2009Duerig A. Abel S. Folcher M. Nicollier M. Schwede T. Amiot N. Giese B. Jenal U. Second messenger-mediated spatiotemporal control of protein degradation regulates bacterial cell cycle progression.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, Radhakrishnan et al., 2010Radhakrishnan S.K.

Cell. 2010; 18: 90-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, we were surprised to find that although TacA degradation in vivo was dependent on RcdA, degradation was unaffected in a ΔpopA strain (Figure 1B). These results show an unexpected role for RcdA separate from PopA in driving cell-cycle-dependent ClpXP proteolysis, a feature that we next explored biochemically. Our original identification of TacA as a ClpXP substrate showed that it was slowly degraded by ClpXP in vitro and required CpdR for in vivo degradation (Bhat et al., 2013Bhat N.H. Vass R.H. Stoddard P.R. Shin D.K. Chien P. Identification of ClpP substrates in Caulobacter crescentus reveals a role for regulated proteolysis in bacterial development.Mol.

However, TacA degradation was unchanged in the presence of CpdR alone (Figure 2A) . We next asked whether addition of both RcdA and CpdR affected TacA degradation in vitro. Consistent with our in vivo observations (Figure 1B), TacA degradation by ClpXP was dramatically accelerated (>20-fold decrease in half-life) in the presence of both CpdR and RcdA (Figures 2A and S1B). This stimulation was specific as degradation of an unrelated substrate (GFP-ssrA) by ClpXP was unaffected by the addition of RcdA and CpdR (Figure S1C). RcdA and CpdR failed to deliver TacA with mutations on the extreme C-terminal residues to di-aspartate, suggesting that the native C terminus constitutes the protease recognition motif (Figure 2A) (Bhat et al., 2013Bhat N.H. Vass R.H. Stoddard P.R. Shin D.K. Chien P. Identification of ClpP substrates in Caulobacter crescentus reveals a role for regulated proteolysis in bacterial development.Mol.

Taken together, these results confirm our in vivo findings that RcdA has a PopA-independent role in promoting degradation of certain CpdR-dependent ClpXP substrates.Figure S1The RcdA Adaptor Directly Binds the TacA Substrate to Facilitate Its CpdR-Dependent ClpXP Degradation, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Hexahistidine tag at the N terminus of TacA does not interfere with its degradation.

PdeA was used as a control prey protein. If CpdR and RcdA together make up a substrate-specific adaptor system for delivery of TacA to ClpXP, it seems reasonable that one of the two should interact directly with TacA. Based on size-exclusion chromatography, we found that the RcdA adaptor could directly bind to TacA (Figure 2B). TacA is an NtrC-family response regulator that contains an N-terminal receiver domain (RD), an ATP-binding AAA+ domain (AAA), and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain (DBD) (Figure 2C). To determine which region of TacA is needed for RcdA-dependent recognition and delivery, we generated a series of TacA truncations. Given that the degradation of the response regulator CtrA by CpdR/RcdA/PopA relies on its N-terminal receiver domain (Ryan et al., 2002Ryan K.R. Judd E.M. Shapiro L. The CtrA response regulator essential for Caulobacter crescentus cell-cycle progression requires a bipartite degradation signal for temporally controlled proteolysis.J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 443-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), we expected a similar reliance for TacA. Surprisingly, the RD region was dispensable for adaptor-dependent proteolysis as fragments containing only the DBD bind to RcdA (Figure S1D) and are degraded similarly to full-length protein (Figure 2C). Further truncations and fusions revealed that a region of 12 residues (437–448) within TacA was necessary for RcdA binding (Figures 2C and 2D). In total, these results support a model wherein the C-terminal domain of TacA contains both RcdA and ClpXP recognition motifs that ensure robust degradation of TacA in a CpdR-dependent fashion (Figure 2E). We next sought to understand how the RcdA adaptor delivers the TacA substrate to the ClpXP protease and how this delivery depends on the adaptor CpdR. Previous work had shown that the disordered C-terminal tail of the RcdA adaptor plays a critical role in the regulated degradation of the CtrA substrate in vivo (Taylor et al., 2009Taylor J.A. Wilbur J.D. Smith S.C. Ryan K.R. Mutations that alter RcdA surface residues decouple protein localization and CtrA proteolysis in Caulobacter crescentus.J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 394: 46-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To determine whether the C terminus of RcdA is also important for TacA degradation, we expressed a variant of RcdA lacking 19 residues from the C terminus (RcdAΔC) as the sole copy in vivo and monitored levels of TacA and CtrA during synchronous growth. As expected, CtrA levels were stable throughout the cell cycle (Taylor et al., 2009Taylor J.A. Wilbur J.D. Smith S.C. Ryan K.R. Mutations that alter RcdA surface residues decouple protein localization and CtrA proteolysis in Caulobacter crescentus.J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 394: 46-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) (Figure 3A). TacA levels also remain stable in this background, whereas the non-RcdA-dependent ClpXP substrate McpA was still degraded in a cell-cycle-dependent manner (Figure 3A). Consistent with these in vivo results, RcdAΔC did not stimulate degradation of TacA in vitro even in the presence of CpdR (Figure 3B). Interestingly, RcdAΔC is still capable of binding TacA (Figures 3C, S2A, and S2B), suggesting that the defect in TacA degradation is downstream of substrate binding. This architecture is reminiscent of the SspB adaptor, in which an N-terminal domain binds ssrA-tagged substrates and a ClpX-binding motif at the C terminus anchors the adaptor to the protease (Dougan et al., 2003Dougan D.A. Weber-Ban E. Bukau B. Targeted delivery of an ssrA-tagged substrate by the adaptor protein SspB to its cognate AAA+ protein ClpX.Mol.

Therefore, we next sought to characterize how the C terminus of the RcdA adaptor contributes to substrate delivery.Figure S2The C Terminus of the RcdA Adaptor Is Dispensable for Substrate Binding but Essential for Tethering RcdA to CpdR-Primed ClpXP, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) RcdAΔC directly interacts with TacA in vitro.

https://openalex.org/W2146349416,"Most short-lived eukaryotic proteins are degraded by the proteasome. A proteolytic core particle (CP) capped by regulatory particles (RPs) constitutes the 26S proteasome complex. RP biogenesis culminates with the joining of two large subcomplexes, the lid and base. In yeast and mammals, the lid appears to assemble completely before attaching to the base, but how this hierarchical assembly is enforced has remained unclear. Using biochemical reconstitutions, quantitative cross-linking/mass spectrometry, and electron microscopy, we resolve the mechanistic basis for the linkage between lid biogenesis and lid-base joining. Assimilation of the final lid subunit, Rpn12, triggers a large-scale conformational remodeling of the nascent lid that drives RP assembly, in part by relieving steric clash with the base. Surprisingly, this remodeling is triggered by a single Rpn12 α helix. Such assembly-coupled conformational switching is reminiscent of viral particle maturation and may represent a commonly used mechanism to enforce hierarchical assembly in multisubunit complexes."

Vestibular and proprioceptive systems influence postural adjustments during movement by signaling functionally complementary sensory information. Using viral tracing and mouse genetics, we reveal two patterns of synaptic specificity between brainstem vestibular neurons and spinal motor neurons, established through distinct mechanisms. First, vestibular input targets preferentially extensor over flexor motor pools, a pattern established by developmental refinement in part controlled by vestibular signaling. Second, vestibular input targets slow-twitch over fast motor neuron subtypes within extensor pools, while proprioceptors exhibit inversely correlated connectivity profiles. Genetic manipulations affecting the functionality of proprioceptive feedback circuits lead to adjustments in vestibular input to motor neuron subtypes counterbalancing the imposed changes, without changing the sparse vestibular input to flexor pools. Thus, two sensory signaling systems interact to establish complementary synaptic input patterns to the final site of motor output processing."

This sterile inflammatory insult is known to activate innate immunity and propagate organ damage through the recognition of damage-associate molecular pattern (DAMP) molecules. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the role of mitochondrial DAMPs (MTDs) in the pathogenesis of hepatic IRI. Using in vitro models we observed that levels of MTDs were significantly higher in both transplantation-associated and warm IR, and that co-culture of MTDs with human and rat hepatocytes significantly increased cell death. MTDs were also released in an in vivo rat model of hepatic IRI and associated with increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10) and increased liver injury compared to the sham group. Our results suggest that hepatic IR results in a significant increase of MTDs both in vitro and in vivo suggesting that MTDs may serve as a novel marker in hepatic IRI. Co-culture of MTDs with hepatocytes showed a decrease in cell viability in a concentration dependent manner, which indicates that MTDs is a toxic mediator participating in the pathogenesis of liver IR injury."

Nevertheless, its risk factors and determinants, especially in the Asian context, remain understudied. We tested the hypothesis of a negative relationship between socioeconomic status and multimorbidity, with contextually different patterns from those observed in the West. Methods We conducted our study in the general Hong Kong (HK) population. Data on current health conditions, health behaviours, socio-demographic and socioeconomic characteristics was obtained from HK Government’s Thematic Household Survey. 25,780 individuals aged 15 or above were sampled. Binary logistic and negative binomial regression analyses were conducted to identify risk factors for presence of multimorbidity and number of chronic conditions, respectively. Sub-analysis of possible mediation effect through financial burden borne by private housing residents on multimorbidity was also conducted. Results Unadjusted and adjusted models showed that being female, being 25 years or above, having an education level of primary schooling or below, having less than HK$15,000 monthly household income, being jobless or retired, and being past daily smoker were significant risk factors for the presence of multimorbidity and increased number of chronic diseases. Living in private housing was significantly associated with higher chance of multimorbidity and increased number of chronic diseases only after adjustments. Conclusions Less advantaged people tend to have higher risks of multimorbidity and utilize healthcare from the public sector with poorer primary healthcare experience. Moreover, middle-class people who are not eligible for government subsidized public housing may be of higher risk of multimorbidity due to psychosocial stress from paying for the severely unaffordable private housing."
https://openalex.org/W2260270424,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most common cause of hospital-acquired pneumonia and a killer of immunocompromised patients. We and others have demonstrated that the type III secretion system (T3SS) effector protein ExoT plays a pivotal role in facilitating P. aeruginosa pathogenesis. ExoT possesses an N-terminal GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain and a C-terminal ADP-ribosyltransferase (ADPRT) domain. Because it targets multiple non-overlapping cellular targets, ExoT performs several distinct virulence functions for P. aeruginosa, including induction of apoptosis in a variety of target host cells. Both the ADPRT and the GAP domain activities contribute to ExoT-induced apoptosis. The ADPRT domain of ExoT induces atypical anoikis by transforming an innocuous cellular protein, Crk, into a cytotoxin, which interferes with integrin survival signaling. However, the mechanism underlying the GAP-induced apoptosis remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that the GAP domain activity is both necessary and sufficient to induce mitochondrial (intrinsic) apoptosis. We show that intoxication with GAP domain results in: (i) JNK1/2 activation; (ii) substantial increases in the mitochondrial levels of activated pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bid, and to a lesser extent Bim; (iii) loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c release; and (iv) activation of initiator caspase-9 and executioner caspase-3. Further, GAP-induced apoptosis is partially mediated by JNK1/2, but it is completely dependent on caspase-9 activity. Together, the ADPRT and the GAP domains make ExoT into a highly versatile and potent cytotoxin, capable of inducing multiple forms of apoptosis in target host cells."
https://openalex.org/W2292239198,"The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway plays an essential role in vertebrate embryonic tissue patterning of many developing organs. Signaling occurs predominantly in primary cilia and is initiated by the entry of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-like protein Smoothened into cilia and culminates in gene transcription via the Gli family of transcription factors upon their nuclear entry. Here we identify an orphan GPCR, Gpr175 (also known as Tpra1 or Tpra40: transmembrane protein, adipocyte associated 1 or of 40 kDa), which also localizes to primary cilia upon Hh stimulation and positively regulates Hh signaling. Interaction experiments place Gpr175 at the level of PKA and upstream of the Gαi component of heterotrimeric G proteins, which itself localizes to cilia and can modulate Hh signaling. Gpr175 or Gαi1 depletion leads to increases in cellular cAMP levels and in Gli3 processing into its repressor form. Thus we propose that Gpr175 coupled to Gαi1 normally functions to inhibit the production of cAMP by adenylyl cyclase upon Hh stimulation, thus maximizing signaling by turning off PKA activity and hence Gli3 repressor formation.

The present study aims to uncover how sport participation, physical activity, social capital and mental health are interrelated by examining these outcomes in one model.A cross-sectional survey was conducted in nine disadvantaged communities in Antwerp (Belgium). Two hundred adults (aged 18-56) per community were randomly selected and visited at home to fill out a questionnaire on socio-demographics, sport participation, physical activity, social capital and mental health. A sample of 414 adults participated in the study.Structural Equation Modeling analysis showed that sport participation (β = .095) and not total physical activity (β = .027) was associated with better mental health. No association was found between sport participation and community social capital (β = .009) or individual social capital (β = .045). Furthermore, only community social capital was linked with physical activity (β = .114), individual social capital was not (β = -.013). In contrast, only individual social capital was directly associated with mental health (β = .152), community social capital was not (β = .070).This study emphasizes the importance of sport participation and individual social capital to improve mental health in disadvantaged communities. It further gives a unique insight into the functionalities of how sport participation, physical activity, social capital and mental health are interrelated. Implications for policy are that cross-sector initiatives between the sport, social and health sector need to be supported as their outcomes are directly linked to one another."
https://openalex.org/W2155147711,"Pathogens and parasites may facilitate their transmission by manipulating host behavior. Honeybee pathogens and pests need to be transferred from one colony to another if they are to maintain themselves in a host population. Inter-colony transmission occurs typically through honeybee workers not returning to their home colony but entering a foreign colony (""drifting""). Pathogens might enhance drifting to enhance transmission to new colonies. We here report on the effects infection by ten honeybee viruses and Nosema spp., and Varroa mite infestation on honeybee drifting. Genotyping of workers collected from colonies allowed us to identify genuine drifted workers as well as source colonies sending out drifters in addition to sink colonies accepting them. We then used network analysis to determine patterns of drifting. Distance between colonies in the apiary was the major factor explaining 79% of drifting. None of the tested viruses or Nosema spp. were associated with the frequency of drifting. Only colony infestation with Varroa was associated with significantly enhanced drifting. More specifically, colonies with high Varroa infestation had a significantly enhanced acceptance of drifters, although they did not send out more drifting workers. Since Varroa-infested colonies show an enhanced attraction of drifting workers, and not only those infected with Varroa and its associated pathogens, infestation by Varroa may also facilitate the uptake of other pests and parasites."
https://openalex.org/W1943469182,"Genome Wide Association Studies suggest that Wnt16 is an important contributor to the mechanisms controlling bone mineral density, cortical thickness, bone strength and ultimately fracture risk. Wnt16 acts on osteoblasts and osteoclasts and, in cortical bone, is predominantly derived from osteoblasts. This led us to hypothesize that low bone mass would be associated with low levels of Wnt16 expression and that Wnt16 expression would be increased by anabolic factors, including mechanical loading. We therefore investigated Wnt16 expression in the context of ageing, mechanical loading and unloading, estrogen deficiency and replacement, and estrogen receptor α (ERα) depletion. Quantitative real time PCR showed that Wnt16 mRNA expression was lower in cortical bone and marrow of aged compared to young female mice. Neither increased nor decreased (by disuse) mechanical loading altered Wnt16 expression in young female mice, although Wnt16 expression was decreased following ovariectomy. Both 17β-estradiol and the Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator Tamoxifen increased Wnt16 expression relative to ovariectomy. Wnt16 and ERβ expression were increased in female ERα-/- mice when compared to Wild Type. We also addressed potential effects of gender on Wnt16 expression and while the expression was lower in the cortical bone of aged males as in females, it was higher in male bone marrow of aged mice compared to young. In the kidney, which we used as a non-bone reference tissue, Wnt16 expression was unaffected by age in either males or females. In summary, age, and its associated bone loss, is associated with low levels of Wnt16 expression whereas bone loss associated with disuse has no effect on Wnt16 expression. In the artificially loaded mouse tibia we observed no loading-related up-regulation of Wnt16 expression but provide evidence that its expression is influenced by estrogen receptor signaling. These findings suggest that while Wnt16 is not an obligatory contributor to regulation of bone mass per se, it potentially plays a role in influencing pathways associated with regulation of bone mass during ageing and estrogen withdrawal."

All the enrolled children were treated with ampicillin and gentamicin, and micronutrients as recommended by the WHO. Comparison was made among pneumonic children with (n = 111) and without WHO defined danger signs of severe pneumonia (n = 296). The outcomes of interest were treatment failure (if a child required changing of antibiotics) and deaths during hospitalization. Further comparison was also made among those who developed treatment failure and who did not and among the survivors and deaths.SAM children with danger signs of severe pneumonia more often experienced treatment failure (58% vs. 20%; p<0.001) and fatal outcome (21% vs. 4%; p<0.001) compared to those without danger signs. Only 6/111 (5.4%) SAM children with danger signs of severe pneumonia and 12/296 (4.0%) without danger signs had bacterial isolates from blood. In log-linear binomial regression analysis, after adjusting for potential confounders, danger signs of severe pneumonia, dehydration, hypocalcaemia, and bacteraemia were independently associated both with treatment failure and deaths in SAM children presenting with cough or respiratory difficulty and radiological pneumonia (p<0.01).The result suggests that SAM children with cough or respiratory difficulty and radiologic pneumonia who had WHO-defined danger signs of severe pneumonia more often had treatment failure and fatal outcome compared to those without the danger signs. In addition to danger signs of severe pneumonia, other common causes of both treatment failure and deaths were dehydration, hypocalcaemia, and bacteraemia on admission. The result underscores the importance for further research especially a randomized, controlled clinical trial to validate standard WHO therapy in SAM children with pneumonia especially with danger signs of severe pneumonia to reduce treatment failures and deaths."
https://openalex.org/W2217070831,"Various toxicants, drugs and their metabolites carry potential ovarian toxicity. Ovarian follicles, the functional unit of the ovary, are susceptible to this type of damage at all stages of their development. However, despite of the large scale of potential negative impacts, assays that study ovarian toxicity are limited. Exposure of cultured ovarian follicles to toxicants of interest served as an important tool for evaluation of toxic effects for decades. Mouse follicles cultured on the bottom of a culture dish continue to serve an important approach for mechanistic studies. In this paper, we demonstrated the usefulness of a hydrogel based 3-dimensional (3D) mouse ovarian follicle culture as a tool to study ovarian toxicity in a different setup. The 3D in vitro culture, based on fibrin alginate interpenetrating network (FA-IPN), preserves the architecture of the ovarian follicle and physiological structure-function relationship. We applied the novel 3D high-throughput (HTP) in vitro ovarian follicle culture system to study the ovotoxic effects of an anti-cancer drug, Doxorobucin (DXR). The fibrin component in the system is degraded by plasmin and appears as a clear circle around the encapsulated follicle. The degradation area of the follicle is strongly correlated with follicle survival and growth. To analyze fibrin degradation in a high throughput manner, we created a custom MATLAB® code that converts brightfield micrographs of follicles encapsulated in FA-IPN to binary images, followed by image analysis. We did not observe any significant difference between manually processed images to the automated MATLAB® method, thereby confirming that the automated program is suitable to measure fibrin degradation to evaluate follicle health. The cultured follicles were treated with DXR at concentrations ranging from 0.005 nM to 200 nM, corresponding to the therapeutic plasma levels of DXR in patients. Follicles treated with DXR demonstrated decreased survival rate in greater DXR concentrations. We observed partial follicle survival of 35% ± 3% (n = 80) in 0.01nM treatment and 48% ± 2% (n = 92) in 0.005nM, which we identified as the IC50 for secondary follicles. In summary, we established a 3D in vitro ovarian follicle culture system that could be used in an HTP approach to measure toxic effects on ovarian follicles."

Methods Thirty-six healthy volunteers were recruited into this prospective, randomized, parallel-group, double-masked comparative study at a single institute. Two products were used, FloraGLO® (Kemin Japan) and XanMax® (Katra Phytochem). The lutein particle size and zeaxanthin concentrations differed between the formulations. The subjects consumed one of the two supplements for a duration of up to 6 months. MPOD levels were measured by resonance Raman spectrometry at baseline and once a month until the end of the study. Serum lutein concentration was measured at baseline, month 3, and month 6. The subjects were also tested for contrast sensitivity, glare sensitivity, visual acuity, and in addition had a focal electroretinogram measured. Results The mean serum lutein concentrations increased significantly after the first three months, but the mean MPOD levels in either supplement group did not show any statistically significant increase. A detailed analysis, however, revealed three response patterns in both groups for the increase of MPOD levels and serum lutein concentration, i.e. “retinal responders”, who had an increase of both MPOD levels and serum lutein concentrations (n = 13), “retinal non-responders”, who had only increased serum concentrations and no change in MPOD levels (n = 20), and “retinal and serum non-responders”, who had neither MPOD level nor plasma concentration increases (n = 3). The subjects with low MPOD levels at baseline appeared to show increased MPOD levels at the 6 month time point upon lutein supplementation (r = -0.4090, p = 0.0133). Glare sensitivity improved in retinal responders in both supplement groups, while there were no remarkable changes in contrast sensitivity. Conclusions No statistically significant differences could be detected for MPOD levels and serum lutein concentrations between the two investigated lutein supplement formulations. Responses to lutein supplementation regarding MPOD levels and serum lutein concentrations varied between subjects. Subjects with lower MPOD levels at baseline responded well to lutein supplementation. However, since the number of subjects was low, a further study with more subjects is needed to prove that subjects with low MPOD levels will benefit from lutein supplementation.

https://openalex.org/W2222794530,"EV71 (enterovirus 71) RNA contains an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) that directs cap-independent initiation of translation. IRES-dependent translation requires the host’s translation initiation factors and IRES-associated trans-acting factors (ITAFs). We reported recently that mRNA decay factor AUF1 is a negative-acting ITAF that binds IRES stem-loop II. We also reported that the small RNA-processing enzyme Dicer produces at least four small RNAs (vsRNAs) from the EV71 IRES. One of these, vsRNA1, derived from IRES stem-loop II, reduces IRES activity and virus replication. Since its mechanism of action is unknown, we hypothesized that it might control association of ITAFs with the IRES. Here, we identified the mRNA stability factor HuR and the RISC subunit Argonaute 2 (Ago2) as two ITAFs that bind stem-loop II. In contrast to AUF1, HuR and Ago2 promote EV71 IRES activity and virus replication. In vitro RNA-binding assays revealed that vsRNA1 can alter association of Ago2, HuR, and AUF1 with stem-loop II. This presents a possible mechanism by which vsRNA1 could control viral translation and replication."
https://openalex.org/W2179719326,"The allostatic load (AL) index is a multi-systemic measure of physiologic dysregulation known to be associated with chronic exposure to stress and adverse health outcomes. We examined the relationship between AL and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration in non-institutionalized US adults.Data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III, 1988-94) were used to calculate two versions of AL including 9 biomarkers and another two with 14 biomarkers (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, serum cholesterol, serum HDL-cholesterol, glycated hemoglobin, sex-specific waist-to-hip ratio, serum albumin, and serum C-reactive protein for AL1, and, additionally body mass index, serum triglyceride, serum creatinine, and serum herpes I & II antibodies for AL2), each set defined by predefined cut-offs or by quartiles. Serum vitamin D concentration was ranked into quartiles. Logistic regression, Poisson regression and linear regression were used to examine the association of serum 25(OH)D concentrations on AL, after adjusting for biological, physiological, socioeconomic, lifestyle, and health variables.Odds Ratios (OR) for high AL of the lowest 25(OH)D serum quartile were between 1.45 (95% CI: 1.28, 1.67) and 1.79 (95% CI: 1.39, 2.32) for the fully adjusted model, depending on AL version. Inverse relationships between vitamin D serum concentrations were observed for all AL versions and every adjustment. This relationship was consistent after stratification by sex, age or ethnic background. Sensitivity to low 25(OH)D concentrations was highest among the youngest group (20-39 years) with an OR of 2.11 (95% CI: 1.63, 2.73) for the lowest vitamin D quartile Q1.Vitamin D had a consistent and statistically significant inverse association with all tested models of high AL, which remained consistent after adjusting for biological, socioeconomic, lifestyle and health variables. Our study adds evidence linking low 25(OH)D concentrations with poorer health, further-reaching than bone health."
https://openalex.org/W2183218499,"Obesity, a worldwide epidemic, is a major risk factor for the development of metabolic syndrome (MetS) including diabetes and associated health complications. Recent studies indicate that chronic low-grade inflammation (CLGI) plays a key role in metabolic deterioration in the obese population. Previously, we reported that Jak3 was essential for mucosal differentiation and enhanced colonic barrier functions and its loss in mice resulted in basal CLGI and predisposition to DSS induced colitis. Since CLGI is associated with diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome, present studies determined the role of Jak3 in development of such conditions. Our data show that loss of Jak3 resulted in increased body weight, basal systemic CLGI, compromised glycemic homeostasis, hyperinsulinemia, and early symptoms of liver steatosis. Lack of Jak3 also resulted in exaggerated symptoms of metabolic syndrome by western high-fat diet. Mechanistically, Jak3 was essential for reduced expression and activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in murine intestinal mucosa and human intestinal epithelial cells where Jak3 interacted with and activated p85, the regulatory subunit of the PI3K, through tyrosine phosphorylation of adapter protein insulin receptor substrate (IRS1). These interactions resulted in activation of PI3K-Akt axis, which was essential for reduced TLR expression and TLR associated NFκB activation. Collectively, these results demonstrate the essential role of Jak3 in promoting mucosal tolerance through suppressed expression and limiting activation of TLRs thereby preventing intestinal and systemic CLGI and associated obesity and MetS."
https://openalex.org/W2222630279,"Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use has become increasingly popular among patients with cancer. The purposes of this study were to compare the QOL in CAM users and non-CAM users and to determine whether CAM use influences QOL among breast cancer patients during chemotherapy.A cross-sectional survey was conducted at two outpatient chemotherapy centers. A total of 546 patients completed the questionnaires on CAM use. QOL was evaluated based on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) core quality of life (QLQ-C30) and breast cancer-specific quality of life (QLQ-BR23) questionnaires.A total of 70.7% of patients were identified as CAM users. There was no significant difference in global health status scores and in all five subscales of the QLQ C30 functional scales between CAM users and non-CAM users. On the QLQ-C30 symptom scales, CAM users (44.96±3.89) had significantly (p = 0.01) higher mean scores for financial difficulties than non-CAM users (36.29±4.81). On the QLQ-BR23 functional scales, CAM users reported significantly higher mean scores for sexual enjoyment (6.01±12.84 vs. 4.64±12.76, p = 0.04) than non-CAM users. On the QLQ-BR23 symptom scales, CAM users reported higher systemic therapy side effects (41.34±2.01 vs. 37.22±2.48, p = 0.04) and breast symptoms (15.76±2.13 vs. 11.08±2.62, p = 0.02) than non-CAM users. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that the use of CAM modality was not significantly associated with higher global health status scores (p = 0.71).While the findings indicated that there was no significant difference between users and non-users of CAM in terms of QOL, CAM may be used by health professionals as a surrogate to monitor patients with higher systemic therapy side effects and breast symptoms. Furthermore, given that CAM users reported higher financial burdens (which may have contributed to increased distress), patients should be encouraged to discuss the potential benefits and/or disadvantages of using CAM with their healthcare providers."
https://openalex.org/W1906095126,"The soluble form of the urokinase receptor, suPAR, has been suggested as a novel biomarker of low-grade inflammation. Activation of the immune system has been proposed to contribute to the development of depression and suicidal behavior. In order to identify depressed and suicidal individuals who could benefit from an anti-inflammatory treatment, a reliable biomarker of low-grade inflammation is vital. This study evaluates plasma suPAR levels as a biomarker of low-grade inflammation in patients with major depressive disorder and in patients who recently attempted suicide. The plasma suPAR and an established biomarker, C reactive protein (CRP) of suicide attempters (n = 54), depressed patients (n = 19) and healthy controls (n = 19) was analyzed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The biomarker attributes of sensitivity and sensibility were evaluated using ROC curve analysis. Both the depressed patients and suicide attempters had increased plasma suPAR. The levels of suPAR discriminated better between controls and suicide attempters than did CRP. In the future, plasma suPAR might be a superior prognosticator regarding outcome of treatment applying conventional antidepressants in conjunction with anti-inflammatory drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2126363059,"Variability in animal migratory behavior is expected to influence fitness, but few empirical examples demonstrating this relationship exist. The initial marine phase in the migration of juvenile salmon smolts has been identified as a potentially critical life history stage to overall population productivity, yet how fine-scale migration routes may influence survival are unknown. Large-scale acoustic telemetry studies have estimated survival rates of outmigrant Pacific salmon smolts through the Strait of Georgia (SOG) along the British Columbian coastline to the Pacific Ocean, but these data have not been used to identify and characterize fine-scale movements. Data collected on over 850 sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) and steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) smolts detected at an array in the Strait of Georgia in 2004–2008 and 2010–2013 were analyzed to characterize migration routes and link movements to subsequent survival at an array 250 km further along the marine migration pathway. Both species exhibited disproportionate use of the most eastern route in the Strait of Georgia (Malaspina Strait). While many smolts moved across the northern Strait of Georgia acoustic array with no indication of long-term milling or large-scale east-to-west movements, large proportions (20–40% of sockeye and 30–50% of steelhead) exhibited a different behavior, apparently moving in a westward or counterclockwise pattern. Variability in migratory behavior for both species was linked to subsequent survival through the Strait of Georgia. Survival for both species was influenced by initial east-to-west location, and sockeye were further influenced by migration timing and duration of time spent near the northern Strait of Georgia array. Westward movements result in a net transport of smolts from Malaspina Strait to the Strait of Georgia, particularly for steelhead. Counterclockwise movements may be due to the currents in this area during the time of outmigration, and the higher proportion of steelhead smolts exhibiting this counterclockwise behavior may reflect a greater exposure to wind-altered currents for the more surface-oriented steelhead. Our results provide an empirical example of how movements can affect migration survival, for which examples remain rare in movement ecology, confirming that variability in movements themselves are an important part of the migratory process."
https://openalex.org/W2171124052,"Marine organisms in Antarctica are adapted to an extreme ecosystem including extremely stable temperatures and strong seasonality due to changes in day length. It is now largely accepted that Southern Ocean organisms are particularly vulnerable to global warming with some regions already being challenged by a rapid increase of temperature. Climate change affects both the physical and biotic components of marine ecosystems and will have an impact on the distribution and population dynamics of Antarctic marine organisms. To predict and assess the effect of climate change on marine ecosystems a more comprehensive knowledge of the life history and physiology of key species is urgently needed. In this study we estimate the Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) model parameters for key benthic Antarctic species the sea star Odontaster validus using available information from literature and experiments. The DEB theory is unique in capturing the metabolic processes of an organism through its entire life cycle as a function of temperature and food availability. The DEB model allows for the inclusion of the different life history stages, and thus, becomes a tool that can be used to model lifetime feeding, growth, reproduction, and their responses to changes in biotic and abiotic conditions. The DEB model presented here includes the estimation of reproduction handling rules for the development of simultaneous oocyte cohorts within the gonad. Additionally it links the DEB model reserves to the pyloric caeca an organ whose function has long been ascribed to energy storage. Model parameters described a slowed down metabolism of long living animals that mature slowly. O. validus has a large reserve that-matching low maintenance costs- allow withstanding long periods of starvation. Gonad development is continuous and individual cohorts developed within the gonads grow in biomass following a power function of the age of the cohort. The DEB model developed here for O. validus allowed us to increase our knowledge on the ecophysiology of this species, providing new insights on the role of food availability and temperature on its life cycle and reproduction strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2217384816,"In rodents, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) has emerged as a key metabolic regulator produced by liver. To gather preliminary data on the potential importance of FGF1, co-regulated genes, and upstream metabolic genes, we examined the hepatic mRNA expression in response to nutrition and inflammation in dairy cows. In experiment 1, induction of ketosis through feed restriction on d 5 postpartum upregulated FGF21, its co-receptor KLB, and PPARA but only elicited a numerical increase in serum FGF21 concentration. In experiment 2, cows in control (CON) or receiving 50 g/d of L-carnitine (C50) from -14 through 21 d had increased FGF21, PPARA, and NFIL3 on d 10 compared with d 2 postpartum. In contrast, compared with CON and C50, 100 g/d L-carnitine (C100) resulted in lower FGF21, KLB, ANGPTL4, and ARNTL expression on d 10. In experiment 3, cows were fed during the dry period either a higher-energy (OVE; 1.62 Mcal/kg DM) or lower-energy (CON; 1.34 Mcal/kg DM) diet and received 0 (OVE:N, CON:N) or 200 μg of LPS (OVE:Y, CON:Y) into the mammary gland at d 7 postpartum. For FGF21 mRNA expression in CON, the LPS challenge (CON:Y) prevented a decrease in expression between d 7 and 14 postpartum such that cows in CON:N had a 4-fold lower expression on d 14 compared with d 7. The inflammatory stimulus induced by LPS in CON:Y resulted in upregulation of PPARA on d 14 to a similar level as cows in OVE:N. In OVE:Y, expression of PPARA was lower than CON:N on d 7 and remained unchanged on d 14. On d 7, LPS led to a 4-fold greater serum FGF21 only in OVE but not in CON cows. In fact, OVE:Y reached the same serum FGF21 concentration as CON:N, suggesting a carryover effect of dietary energy level on signaling mechanisms within liver. Overall, results indicate that nutrition, ketosis, and inflammation during the peripartal period can alter hepatic FGF21, co-regulated genes, and upstream metabolic genes to various extents. The functional outcome of these changes merits further study, and in particular the mechanisms regulating transcription in response to changes in energy balance and feed intake."

However, limitations exist due to their transient biological stability in vivo, lack of specificity for target cells, and poor cellular uptake. To address these issues, we prepared amine magnetic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (M-MSN-A) then further modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG) for use as CpG delivery vectors. The PEG modified M-MSN-A (M-MSN-P) had notable CpG ODN loading capacity, negligible cytotoxicity, and were easily internalized into cells where they released the loaded CpG into the cytoplasm. As a result, such complexes were effective in activating macrophages and inhibiting tumor cells when combined with chemotherapeutics in vitro. Furthermore, these complexes had excellent immuno-stimulating activity in vivo, compared to the free CpG therapeutics. We report here a highly effective MSNs-based delivery system with great potential as a therapeutic CpG formulation in cancer immunotherapy."

https://openalex.org/W1771817800,"Tail-anchored (TA) proteins, defined as having a single transmembrane helix at their C terminus, are post-translationally targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane by the guided entry of TA proteins (GET) pathway. In yeast, the handover of TA substrates is mediated by the heterotetrameric Get4/Get5 complex (Get4/5), which tethers the co-chaperone Sgt2 to the targeting factor, the Get3 ATPase. Binding of Get4/5 to Get3 is critical for efficient TA targeting; however, questions remain about the formation of the Get3·Get4/5 complex. Here we report crystal structures of a Get3·Get4/5 complex from Saccharomyces cerevisiae at 2.8 and 6.0 A that reveal a novel interface between Get3 and Get4 dominated by electrostatic interactions. Kinetic and mutational analyses strongly suggest that these structures represent an on-pathway intermediate that rapidly assembles and then rearranges to the final Get3·Get4/5 complex. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the Get3·Get4/5 complex is dominated by a single Get4/5 heterotetramer bound to one monomer of a Get3 dimer, uncovering an intriguing asymmetry in the Get4/5 heterotetramer upon Get3 binding. Ultrafast diffusion-limited electrostatically driven Get3·Get4/5 association enables Get4/5 to rapidly sample and capture Get3 at different stages of the GET pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2212549284,"Wound healing consists of a complex, dynamic and overlapping process involving inflammation, proliferation and tissue remodeling. A better understanding of wound healing process at the molecular level is needed for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) controls programmed necrosis in response to TNF-α during inflammation and has been shown to be highly induced during cutaneous wound repair. However, its role in wound healing remains to be demonstrated. To study this, we created dorsal cutaneous wounds on male wild-type (WT) and RIPK3-deficient (Ripk3-/-) mice. Wound area was measured daily until day 14 post-wound and skin tissues were collected from wound sites at various days for analysis. The wound healing rate in Ripk3-/- mice was slower than the WT mice over the 14-day course; especially, at day 7, the wound size in Ripk3-/- mice was 53% larger than that of WT mice. H&E and Masson-Trichrome staining analysis showed impaired quality of wound closure in Ripk3-/- wounds with delayed re-epithelialization and angiogenesis and defected granulation tissue formation and collagen deposition compared to WT. The neutrophil infiltration pattern was altered in Ripk3-/- wounds with less neutrophils at day 1 and more neutrophils at day 3. This altered pattern was also reflected in the differential expression of IL-6, KC, IL-1β and TNF-α between WT and Ripk3-/- wounds. MMP-9 protein expression was decreased with increased Timp-1 mRNA in the Ripk3-/- wounds compared to WT. The microvascular density along with the intensity and timing of induction of proangiogenic growth factors VEGF and TGF-β1 were also decreased or delayed in the Ripk3-/- wounds. Furthermore, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from Ripk3-/- mice migrated less towards chemoattractants TGF-β1 and PDGF than MEFs from WT mice. These results clearly demonstrate that RIPK3 is an essential molecule to maintain the temporal manner of the normal progression of wound closure."

It is unclear to what extent treatment of SDB can improve daytime hypoxemia.We performed a retrospective cohort study of obese hypoxemic individuals, all of whom underwent polysomnography, arterial blood gas analysis, and subsequent initiation of positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy for SDB. Patients were followed for one year for change in partial pressure of arterial oxygen and the need for supplemental oxygen.One hundred and seventeen patients were treated with nocturnal PAP and had follow-up available. Adherence to PAP was satisfactory in 60%, and was associated with a significant improvement in daytime hypoxemia and hypercapnea; 56% of these patients were able to discontinue supplemental oxygen. Adherence to PAP therapy and the baseline severity of OSA predicted improvement in hypoxemia, but only adherence to PAP therapy predicted liberation from supplemental oxygen.The identification and treatment of SDB in obese hypoxemic patients improves daytime hypoxemia. It is important to identify SDB in these patients, since supplemental oxygen can frequently be discontinued following treatment with PAP therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2216306248,"Background Although self-esteem is related to problematic drinking, the mechanisms by which it affects drinking remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine whether coping mechanisms mediate the relationship between self-esteem and problematic drinking among Chinese men and women with alcohol use disorders and to recommend appropriate interventions for drinking problems. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, China. A sample of 5,689 community residents was screened, and 517 male and 172 female problematic drinkers were chosen to participate in this study. A self-esteem scale, a coping questionnaire and an alcohol use disorder identification test were completed in order to assess participants’ self-esteem, coping mechanisms and alcohol use disorders, respectively. Participants’ socio-demographic data were also gathered at this stage. The resulting data were examined via descriptive statistics, correlations and bootstrap analyses. Results Lower self-esteem levels were related to problematic drinking, and there were no gender differences in the relationship between self-esteem and problematic drinking. A relationship between low self-esteem and negative coping was observed only in men. Negative coping thus mediated the relationship between self-esteem and problematic drinking among men, but this was not the case for women. Positive coping did not mediate the relationship between self-esteem and problematic drinking among the participants, regardless of gender. Conclusions Self-esteem and coping strategies are correlated among problematic drinkers. In addition, there are gender differences in the manners in which negative coping mediates the relationship between self-esteem and problematic drinking. Problematic drinking interventions directed at males should simultaneously address low self-esteem and negative coping."

These spinal devices are frequently composed of pedicle screws with a reputation for stable fixation but which can suffer pullouts during preclinical implantation on young animals, leading to high morbidity. With a view to identifying the best choices to optimize pedicle screw fixation in the porcine model, this study evaluates ex vivo the impact of weight (age) of the animal, the level of the vertebrae (lumbar or thoracic) and the type of screw anchorage (mono- or bi-cortical) on pedicle screw pullouts. Among the 80 pig vertebrae (90- and 140-day-old) tested in this study, the average screw pullout forces ranged between 419.9N and 1341.2N. In addition, statistical differences were found between test groups, pointing out the influence of the three parameters stated above. We found that the the more caudally the screws are positioned (lumbar level), the greater their pullout resistance is, moreover, screw stability increases with the age, and finally, the screws implanted with a mono-cortical anchorage sustained lower pullout forces than those implanted with a bi-cortical anchorage. We conclude that the best anchorage can be obtained with older animals, using a lumbar fixation and long screws traversing the vertebra and inducing bi-cortical anchorage. In very young animals, pedicle screw fixations need to be bi-cortical and more numerous to prevent pullout."

We asked whether this polarized effect of ATP is, in fact, reflective of a polarized effect of increased [Ca2+]i on ENaC and what underlying mechanism is responsible. We began by performing patch clamp experiments in which ENaC activity was measured during apical or basolateral application of ionomycin to increase [Ca2+]i near the apical or basolateral membrane, respectively. We found that ENaC does indeed respond to increased [Ca2+]i in a polarized fashion, with apical increases being inhibitory and basolateral increases stimulating channel activity. In other epithelial cell types, mitochondria sequester [Ca2+]i, creating [Ca2+]i signaling microdomains within the cell that are dependent on mitochondrial localization. We found that mitochondria localize in bands just beneath the apical and basolateral membranes in two different cortical collecting duct principal cell lines and in cortical collecting duct principal cells in mouse kidney tissue.

The distal portion of the renal tubule functions to fine-tune sodium reabsorption to regulate plasma sodium concentration. This is done transcellularly by movement of sodium through ENaC channels on the apical surface of the cell, followed by basolateral movement through the Na+/K+-ATPase. The epithelial cells in this segment must express different proteins on the apical versus basolateral surface of the cell to allow for regulated transcellular ion movement. Polarization of the single layer of epithelial cells lining the tubule is essential for the nephron to sense changes in plasma and tubular fluid composition and regulate ENaC and other membrane proteins appropriately (4.Kashlan O.B.

[Ca2+]i inhibition of ENaC is, in fact, a well known phenomenon, and several publications by different investigators have proposed the following model. Gq-coupled receptors activate phospholipase C, which causes release of Ca2+ through IP3 receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum near the apical plasma membrane, where ENaC is expressed (7.Toney G.M. Vallon V. Stockand J.D. Intrinsic control of sodium excretion in the distal nephron by inhibitory purinergic regulation of the epithelial Na+ channel.Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2012; 21: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Following an increase in [Ca2+]i, PKC is activated (9.Bao H.F. Thai T.L. Yue Q. Ma H.P. Eaton A.F. Cai H. Klein J.D. Sands J.M.

Renal Physiol. 2014; 306: F309-F320Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and, via a separate pathway, Ca2+ binds to calmodulin. ENaC is usually held in the membrane by phosphatidylinositol phosphates, particularly PIP2 and phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (10.Pochynyuk O. Bugaj V. Vandewalle A. Stockand J.D.

Chem. 2002; 277: 11965-11969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). A protein, myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS), normally stabilizes PIP2 to create an anchoring domain for ENaC (12.Alli A.A. Bao H.F. Alli A.A. Aldrugh Y. Song J.Z. Ma H.P. Yu L. Al-Khalili O. Eaton D.C. Phosphatidylinositol phosphate-dependent regulation of Xenopus ENaC by MARCKS protein.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2012; 303: F800-F811Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). When MARCKS is bound by calmodulin or phosphorylated by PKC, this causes loss of MARCKS from the membrane, destabilization of PIP2, and endocytosis of ENaC. [Ca2+]i can also activate the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2, causing ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of ENaC (13.Henry P.C. Kanelis V. O'Brien M.C. Kim B. Gautschi I. Forman-Kay J. Schild L.

Chem. 2003; 278: 20019-20028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Although increases in [Ca2+]i in the cytosol just beneath the apical plasma membrane most likely inhibit ENaC, research from our group and others suggests that increasing [Ca2+]i in the cytosol very near the basolateral membrane of the cell may stimulate ENaC (14.Thai T.L. Yu L. Eaton D.C. Duke B.J. Al-Khalili O. Lam H.Y. Ma H. Bao H.F. Basolateral P2X(4)channels stimulate ENaC activity in Xenopus cortical collecting duct A6 cells.Am. J. Physiol.

Al-Khalili O. Lam H.Y. Ma H. Bao H.F. Basolateral P2X(4)channels stimulate ENaC activity in Xenopus cortical collecting duct A6 cells.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2014; 307: F806-F813Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). P2X4 channels are known Ca2+ channels, and chelating [Ca2+]i with BAPTA (1,2 bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane,N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid) decreased P2X4-induced ENaC stimulation, suggesting that increases in [Ca2+]i are stimulating ENaC when they originate from the basal pole. [Ca2+]i spreading must somehow be prevented in epithelia of the distal nephron to observe a polarized effect of [Ca2+]i on ENaC. In pancreatic acinar and airway epithelia, mitochondria can restrict [Ca2+]i diffusion by sequestering [Ca2+]i (16.Ribeiro C.M. Paradiso A.M. Livraghi A. Boucher R.C. The mitochondrial barriers segregate agonist-induced calcium-dependent functions in human airway epithelia.J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 17.Tinel H. Cancela J.M. Mogami H. Gerasimenko J.V. Gerasimenko O.V. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. Active mitochondria surrounding the pancreatic acinar granule region prevent spreading of inositol trisphosphate-evoked local cytosolic Ca2+ signals.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4999-5008Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). We tested the hypothesis that mitochondria in cortical collecting duct (CCD) function in a similar manner to create regions of high and low [Ca2+]i within the cell (Ca2+ pools) and that these pools allow the same second messenger to affect the same protein (i.e. ENaC) in opposing ways, depending on the origin (apical versus basal) of the signal. This allows the cell to respond differently to hormone signals that signal via [Ca2+]i, depending on whether the hormone is sensed in the serosal or luminal compartment. Experiments used either the 2F3 clone of A6 Xenopus distal tubule cells or mouse mpkCCD cells from the cortical collecting duct. The type of cell used in each experiment was decided by ease of use. 2F3 cells are suited for electrophysiology because of their ability to remain at room temperature for extended periods of time, high expression of ENaC, and low expression of other channels. mpkCCD cells were used for microscopy experiments because they are easy to transfect and easily take up mitochondrial dyes. Cells were grown on permeable supports to confluency, and then cells were polarized, and tight junctions were fully developed. For 2F3 cells, medium was supplemented with aldosterone (1.5 μm) to increase ENaC activity. Ionomycin, when used, was dissolved in <0.05% ethanol. Although ethanol can stimulate ENaC, it has no effect at this concentration (18.Bao H.F. Song J.Z. Duke B.J. Ma H.P. Denson D.D. Eaton D.C. Ethanol stimulates epithelial sodium channels by elevating reactive oxygen species.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2012; 303: C1129-C1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To visualize mitochondria, cells were loaded with MitoTracker Red (Life Technologies) for 30 min before visualization. To visualize the ER, cells were loaded with ERTracker Blue (Life Technologies) for 10 min prior to imaging. To label the membrane, cells were transfected with PLCδ-1 PH-GFP (1.5 μg/well, Addgene) using the Xfect system (Clontech). pN1-Lck-GCaMP tagged with enhanced GFP was used to visualize changes in [Ca2+]i near the plasma membrane of the cell (19.Shigetomi E. Kracun S. Sofroniew M.V. Khakh B.S. A genetically targeted optical sensor to monitor calcium signals in astrocyte processes.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 759-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). To detect changes in mitochondrial Ca2+, cells were cold-loaded with Rhodamine-2/AM (Life Technologies) because cold loading has been shown previously to increase the specificity of the dye for mitochondrial versus cytosolic Ca2+ (20.Trollinger D.R. Cascio W.E. Lemasters J.J. Selective loading of Rhod 2 into mitochondria shows mitochondrial Ca2+ transients during the contractile cycle in adult rabbit cardiac myocytes.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 738-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). MpkCCD cells were incubated with Rhod2/AM for 1.5 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation in media without serum for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were rinsed briefly prior to use. Cells were imaged using an Olympus FV-1000 confocal microscope. To resolve subcellular distribution of fluorescent markers, z-stacks were obtained using sequential optical slices starting at the basal membrane. All images were taken using the same parameter settings. Single-channel patch clamping was performed as described previously (14.Thai T.L. Yu L. Eaton D.C. Duke B.J. Al-Khalili O. Lam H.Y. Ma H. Bao H.F. Basolateral P2X(4)channels stimulate ENaC activity in Xenopus cortical collecting duct A6 cells.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2014; 307: F806-F813Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Briefly, a microelectrode was filled with physiological buffer (96 mm NaCl, 0.8 mm CaCl, 0.8 mm MgCl, and 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4)) and lowered to touch the apical or basolateral membrane of a single cell. Suction was applied gently so that the membrane remained intact and a >1 GΩ seal was formed. All current was recorded at a holding potential of 0 mV. ENaC was identified by its characteristic channel kinetics and current-voltage relationship. ENaC probability of opening was analyzed using ClampFit software. Empty patches (those with no apparent activity) comprised 30–50% of all patches and were excluded from the study. To quantify the confocal microscopy experiments, ImageJ was used. The number of pixels in a given area was calculated before and after drug addition. Averages were compared using Student's t test with p < 0.05 considered significant. We sought to test the hypothesis that ENaC is affected differently by changes in [Ca2+]i depending from which pole of the cell the signal originates. To do this, we performed single-channel patch-clamping as described previously (15.Zhang Y. Sanchez D. Gorelik J. Klenerman D. Lab M. Edwards C. Korchev Y. Basolateral P2X4-like receptors regulate the extracellular ATP-stimulated epithelial Na+ channel activity in renal epithelia.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2007; 292: F1734-F1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and cells were treated with either 5 μm apical ionomycin (Fig. 1A) or 15 μm basolateral ionomycin (Fig. 1B) to increase [Ca2+]i. After 1–3 min of apical application of ionomycin, we observed a significant decrease in channel activity measured as probability of opening. We saw that the decrease in ENaC activity was maintained through 4–6 min of ionomycin addition. In contrast, basolateral application of ionomycin increased ENaC activity, but only after 13–15 min. In other words, the effect of [Ca2+]i on ENaC is dependent on the side of the cell in which the increase in [Ca2+]i occurs. Note that the difference in time course and concentration here is likely due to limited diffusion of agents administered from the basal side of the cell (see “Discussion”). We hypothesize that this polarized effect is the result of two different Ca2+-mediated signaling pathways present in the same cell type. Beneath the apical surface of the cell, Ca2+ activates pathways that inhibit ENaC, but, beneath the basal surface, Ca2+ activates pathways that stimulate ENaC. Despite the relatively diffusibility of Ca2+, these two pools of Ca2+ must not interact for polarization to occur. We hypothesize that mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake prevents diffusion of [Ca2+]i within principal cells to allow for these two pathways to remain separated. We next tested whether the polarized effects of [Ca2+]i on ENaC function were dependent on mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is dependent on movement through the inner mitochondrial membrane, a process facilitated by the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) (21.Finkel T. Menazza S. Holmström K.M. Parks R.J. Liu J. Sun J. Liu J. Pan X. Murphy E. The ins and outs of mitochondrial calcium.Circ. Res. 2015; 116: 1810-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) Ru360 is a drug that inhibits the MCU and the voltage-dependent anion channel, a channel that may facilitate movement across the outer membrane (22.Gincel D. Vardi N. Shoshan-Barmatz V. Retinal voltage-dependent anion channel: characterization and cellular localization.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 43: 2097-2104PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Kirichok Y. Krapivinsky G. Clapham D.E. The mitochondrial calcium uniporter is a highly selective ion channel.Nature. 2004; 427: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). We first tested the effect of apical application of Ru360 alone on ENaC function and found it to have an inhibitory effect that persisted over time (Fig. 2A). This is not surprising because inhibiting Ca2+ uptake by the mitochondria that lie just beneath the apical plasma membrane likely increases apical [Ca2+]i slightly, inhibiting the channel. We then performed experiments in which Ru360 was first added to the apical surface of the cell to inhibit mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, followed by apical (Fig. 2B) or basolateral (Fig. 2C) addition of ionomycin, while ENaC activity was monitored by patch clamp. Although Fig. 1 shows that apical and basolateral ionomycin normally have very different effects on the ENaC probability of opening, the shape of the graphs in Fig. 2, B and C (the same experiment repeated in the absence of mitochondrial calcium uptake) are the same, suggesting that the polarized effect of [Ca2+]i on ENaC is dependent on mitochondrial calcium uptake. ATP has been shown repeatedly to inhibit ENaC when applied apically (a process that is dependent on an increase in [Ca2+]i (24.Wildman S.S. Kang E.S. King B.F. ENaC, renal sodium excretion and extracellular ATP.Purinergic Signal. 2009; 5: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar)). Fig. 2D shows that, in the absence of mitochondrial calcium uptake, apical ATP has a stimulatory effect on ENaC. Notice that, in each of the panels of Fig. 2, B–D, the shape of the response is the same. Although Ru360 alone has an inhibitory effect on ENaC that persists over time, adding any agent that increases [Ca2+]i on the apical or basolateral side of the cell has a stimulatory (or null effect that is likely Ru360 inhibition opposed by stimulation) effect on ENaC in the presence of Ru360. In these experiments, we apply Ru360 to the apical surface of the cell. The inability of mitochondria to take up Ca2+ would lead to an increase in regional [Ca2+]i. We know from the data in Fig. 1 that this would inhibit ENaC. Mitochondrial bands in pancreatic acinar and airway epithelia have been observed by other groups to form barriers to prevent [Ca2+]i diffusion by sequestering [Ca2+]i and slowly releasing it (17.Tinel H. Cancela J.M. Mogami H. Gerasimenko J.V. Gerasimenko O.V. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. Active mitochondria surrounding the pancreatic acinar granule region prevent spreading of inositol trisphosphate-evoked local cytosolic Ca2+ signals.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4999-5008Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 18.Bao H.F. Song J.Z. Duke B.J. Ma H.P. Denson D.D. Eaton D.C. Ethanol stimulates epithelial sodium channels by elevating reactive oxygen species.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2012; 303: C1129-C1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that mitochondria may be localized in bands in the cortical collecting duct to allow for [Ca2+]i polarization and opposing effects on ENaC. We began testing this hypothesis by using MitoTracker Red to observe mitochondrial localization in cortical collecting duct cells. We used two live cortical collecting duct cell lines: A6 cells from Xenopus CCD and mpkCCD cells from mice. The z axis view of both mpkCCD cells (Fig. 3A) and A6 cells (Fig. 3B) demonstrates that, in fact, mitochondria localize in the cytosol very close to each membrane in the cortical collecting duct. To pinpoint the location of mitochondrial bands with respect to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3C), we used the fluorescent PIP2 indicator PLCδ-1 PH-GFP to label the apical and lateral membranes. We found that the apical mitochondrial bands are located just beneath the plasma membrane. Release of ER Ca2+ through IP3 receptor channels is known to inhibit ENaC. We hypothesized that, for the Ca2+ exiting the ER through the IP3 receptors to access ENaC and not be taken up by the mitochondria, sections of the ER would have to lie between the apical mitochondrial barrier and the apical plasma membrane. To observe ER localization in relation to mitochondria, we loaded mpkCCD cells with MitoTracker Red and ERTracker Blue to label the mitochondria and ER, respectively (Fig. 3D). We found that the ER does pass the mitochondrial barrier in spots in live cells. It is possible that this localization is necessary for Gq receptor inhibition of ENaC because IP3 receptor-mediated Ca2+ release would have to occur in the cytosol between the apical membrane, where ENaC is localized, and the mitochondrial band, where Ca2+ would be sequestered for the majority of the Ca2+ to access the channel. Fig. 3E shows transmission electron microscopy of a mouse cortical collecting duct principal cell. Note the localization of mitochondria, as indicated by black lines highlighting the bands. Location of ∼900 mitochondria in more than 10 different cells is quantified in Fig. 3F. In Fig. 3, we show that mitochondria in the CCD form bands underneath the apical and basal membranes. This morphology is similar to other epithelia, such as airway epithelia, in which mitochondrial bands slow Ca2+ movement across the cell. Because morphology does not necessarily imply function, we tested whether Ca2+ can move across live CCD cells from one membrane to the other (Fig. 4). To be able to clearly observe Ca2+ beneath the cell membrane at the apical and basal poles, we transfected cells with a membrane-tethered Ca2+ sensor, pN1-Lck-CaMP2 (19.Shigetomi E. Kracun S. Sofroniew M.V. Khakh B.S. A genetically targeted optical sensor to monitor calcium signals in astrocyte processes.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 759-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). This protein contains a membrane-tethering domain from Src and a GFP molecule that is fused to calmodulin so that an increase in [Ca2+]i beneath the membrane enhances the fluorescence of the GFP molecule. In Fig. 4A, we applied ionomycin to the apical surface of the cell and found that [Ca2+]i increased in the apical but not basal region of the cytosol. Conversely, Fig. 4 B shows that basal ionomycin increases [Ca2+]i in the basal but not apical portion of the cytosol, suggesting that [Ca2+]i is compartmentalized in mpkCCD cells. Fig. 4C shows that, in the absence of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, [Ca2+]i compartmentalization is lost and that apical application of ionomycin results in an increase in [Ca2+]i in both the apical and basal portions of the cytosol. To test whether mitochondria take up Ca2+ following an increase in [Ca2+]i, we cold-loaded mpkCCD cells with the dye Rhod2/AM, which has been shown to be specific for mitochondrial Ca2+ when cells are cold-loaded (20.Trollinger D.R. Cascio W.E. Lemasters J.J. Selective loading of Rhod 2 into mitochondria shows mitochondrial Ca2+ transients during the contractile cycle in adult rabbit cardiac myocytes.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 738-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). After apical application of ionomycin, there was an increase in mitochondrial Ca2+ in the apical but not basal mitochondrial band. These data show that mitochondria in CCD cells do take up Ca2+ rapidly following an increase in [Ca2+]i at the apical pole of the cell and also confirm that there is limited Ca2+ movement across the cell because there is no Ca2+ uptake by the basal band following an apical increase in [Ca2+]i. Fig. 5B shows localization of Rhod2/AM in mitochondria, and Fig. 5C shows that Ru360 prevents Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria. The data shown here are the first to directly show that the effect of increasing [Ca2+]i at the apical versus basolateral membrane produces a different effect on ENaC function in the kidney. Polarization of [Ca2+]i implies that [Ca2+]i is compartmentalized in renal epithelia and does not diffuse between compartments. We show that, in a principal cell line, apical application of the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin inhibits ENaC activity (Fig. 1). The effects of increasing apical [Ca2+]i on renal ENaC function have been well studied. The most accepted physiological mechanism by which Ca2+ inhibits ENaC occurs downstream of purinergic signaling via the P2Y2 receptor on the apical membrane (7.Toney G.M. Vallon V. Stockand J.D. Intrinsic control of sodium excretion in the distal nephron by inhibitory purinergic regulation of the epithelial Na+ channel.Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2012; 21: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). P2Y2 receptors signal via a Gq-coupled receptor pathway to induce Ca2+ release from ER stores. This release of Ca2+ can act via a variety of signaling pathways, including PKC activation, to inhibit ENaC (25.Farah C.A. Sossin W.S. The role of C2 domains in PKC signaling.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2012; 740: 663-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This is demonstrated physiologically by the fact that mice lacking PKC have overactive ENaC and salt-sensitive hypertension (9.Bao H.F. Thai T.L. Yue Q. Ma H.P. Eaton A.F. Cai H. Klein J.D. Sands J.M. Eaton D.C. ENaC activity is increased in isolated, split-open cortical collecting ducts from protein kinase Cα knockout mice.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2014; 306: F309-F320Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 26.Bao H.F. Zhang Z.R. Liang Y.Y. Ma J.J. Eaton D.C. Ma H.P. Ceramide mediates inhibition of the renal epithelial sodium channel by tumor necrosis factor-α through protein kinase C.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2007; 293: F1178-F1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). ENaC must be tethered to the apical membrane by PIP2 or phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Although both PIPs and ENaC are rare, they are recruited together by MARCKS. Binding of calmodulin to MARCKS or phosphorylation by PKC leads to removal of MARCKS and, therefore, ENaC from the membrane. Ca2+ may also inhibit ENaC directly or activate the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2 to tag ENaC for proteasomal degradation (13.Henry P.C. Kanelis V. O'Brien M.C. Kim B. Gautschi I. Forman-Kay J. Schild L. Rotin D. Affinity and specificity of interactions between Nedd4 isoforms and the epithelial Na+ channel.J. Biol.

Calcium activates Nedd4 E3 ubiquitin ligases by releasing the C2 domain-mediated auto-inhibition.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 12279-12288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Interestingly, our data also show, for the first time, that ENaC is stimulated by basolaterally applied ionomycin (Fig. 1B). It is of note that stimulating ENaC requires a very high dose of ionomycin and takes much longer than apical ionomycin to cause an effect. This could imply that effects of basal [Ca2+]i on ENaC are not physiologically relevant. It is likely that the delay in response and high dose of ionomycin are due to the larger volume of media on the basolateral side of the cells, small size of the pores in the polyester membranes used as a surface in our experiments, and invagination of the basal membrane which limit the diffusion of ionomycin so that a larger dose and more time are needed. Unfortunately determining whether this is the case would be difficult to test experimentally. What is not clear from this work (or work published previously) are the signaling mechanisms dictating how basolateral increases in [Ca2+]i work to stimulate ENaC activity. Our previous work shows that basolateral P2X4 receptor stimulation of ENaC is dependent on PI3K and Ca2+. Because Ca2+ is not known to modulate PI3K directly, there must be an intermediate signaling molecule mediating the process. Src is one protein that can be regulated by Ca2+ and can modulate PI3K and has been shown to regulate ENaC (28.Gilmore E.S. Stutts M.J. Milgram S.L. SRC family kinases mediate epithelial Na+ channel inhibition by endothelin.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42610-42617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It is possible, therefore, that src is an intermediate in P2X4 signaling or that P2X4 signaling cannot occur without cross-talk from receptor tyrosine kinases upstream of src. Future investigation of these signaling pathways will provide valuable insights into ENaC regulation. Using two cell culture lines derived from this kidney segment, we observe that, in a polarized, live cell culture system, mitochondria form distinct bands at the apical and basal poles of the cells (Fig. 3). Bands such as these have been identified previously in other epithelial cell types: pancreatic acinar cells and airway epithelia (16.Ribeiro C.M. Paradiso A.M. Livraghi A. Boucher R.C. The mitochondrial barriers segregate agonist-induced calcium-dependent functions in human airway epithelia.J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 17.Tinel H. Cancela J.M. Mogami H. Gerasimenko J.V. Gerasimenko O.V. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. Active mitochondria surrounding the pancreatic acinar granule region prevent spreading of inositol trisphosphate-evoked local cytosolic Ca2+ signals.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4999-5008Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Interestingly, airway and renal epithelia are the primary sites of ENaC expression (29.Snyder P.M. The epithelial Na+ channel: cell surface insertion and retrieval in Na+ homeostasis and hypertension.Endocrine Rev. 2002; 23: 258-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Although the influence of airway mitochondrial bands on ENaC activity has not been addressed, it is interesting that all tissues in which banding has been observed rely heavily on ENaC for function. We also show that this banding occurs in vivo because transmission electron microscopy of mouse kidney shows banding in cortical collecting duct principal cells. In this study, we observed the apical mitochondrial band to be situated just beneath the plasma membrane with portions of the ER jutting through the band. This particular localization is interesting in that it would allow the mitochondria to participate in Ca2+ regulation near lipid raft domains. Indeed, ENaC is known to localize in such domains and proteins such as Nedd4–2 and MARCKS, known to regulate ENaC in these domains are influenced by [Ca2+]i (12.Alli A.A. Bao H.F. Alli A.A. Aldrugh Y. Song J.Z. Ma H.P. Yu L. Al-Khalili O. Eaton D.C. Phosphatidylinositol phosphate-dependent regulation of Xenopus ENaC by MARCKS protein.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2012; 303: F800-F811Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 30.Hill W.G. Butterworth M.B. Wang H. Edinger R.S. Lebowitz J. Peters K.W. Frizzell R.A. Johnson J.P.

Chem. 2007; 282: 37402-37411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Future experiments should be aimed at determining whether disrupting mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake influences lipid raft Ca2+ signaling. Using innovative Ca2+ sensors for [Ca2+]i beneath the membrane and mitochondrial Ca2+, we show that [Ca2+]i is taken up by mitochondria following apical application of ionomycin and that [Ca2+]i stimulated by ionomycin does not spread throughout the cell (Fig. 4). To visualize mitochondrial Ca2+, we used the dye Rhod2/AM (Fig. 5). This dye can sense [Ca2+]i as well but has a preference for mitochondrial Ca2+ when cold-loaded and seemed to localize in a band in our study (20.Trollinger D.R. Cascio W.E. Lemasters J.J. Selective loading of Rhod 2 into mitochondria shows mitochondrial Ca2+ transients during the contractile cycle in adult rabbit cardiac myocytes.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 738-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We were really only able to visualize the apical mitochondrial band using Rhod2/AM. This could be due to the low uptake of the dye and the faintness of the basal band compared with the apical one. For this reason, a limitation of our study is that we were unable to measure Ca2+ uptake by the basal mitochondrial band. We did see the Ca2+ in the apical mitochondrial band increase following apical ionomycin application, indicative of Ca2+ sequestration. To visualize [Ca2+]i, we used the membrane-tethered [Ca2+]i sensor Lck-CaMP (19.Shigetomi E. Kracun S. Sofroniew M.V. Khakh B.S. A genetically targeted optical sensor to monitor calcium signals in astrocyte processes.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 759-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). This vector consists of an enhanced GFP molecule fused to calmodulin and the membrane domain of Src. When Ca2+ increases at the membrane, the conformation of calmodulin changes so that GFP is excited. This vector helped us to see [Ca2+]i just under the membrane and determine whether [Ca2+]i spread following ionomycin application. We found that mitochondria sequester [Ca2+]i following apical increases in [Ca2+]i and that, when [Ca2+]i is increased on one side of the cell, it does not migrate to the opposing pole. Mitochondria transport Ca2+ across the inner mitochondrial membrane via the MCU (31.Williams G.S. Boyman L. Chikando A.C. Khairallah R.J. Lederer W.J. Mitochondrial calcium uptake.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 10479-10486Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Ru360, a ruthenium compound used in this study to obliterate the polarized effects of [Ca2+]i on ENaC, inhibits MCU as well as a component of outer mitochondrial membrane Ca2+ uptake (22.Gincel D.

Calcium-induced cytochrome c release from CNS mitochondria is associated with the permeability transition and rupture of the outer membrane.J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 207-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In the absence of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, a similar biphasic response of ENaC to [Ca2+]i was observed regardless of which pole ionomycin was added to (Fig. 2). These data suggest that mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is required for the polarized response of ENaC to [Ca2+]i. It is interesting that mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake has been implicated in blood pressure regulation in a Chinese family that displays maternally inherited hypertension (33.Liu Y. Gao L. Xue Q. Li Z. Wang L. Chen R. Liu M. Wen Y. Guan M. Li Y. Wang S. Voltage-dependent anion channel involved in the mitochondrial calcium cycle of cell lines carrying the mitochondrial DNA A4263G mutation.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2011; 404: 364-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The data presented here provide the groundwork for future investigations into the role of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in ENaC regulation in salt-sensitive hypertension. Overall, we conclude that the renal epithelial sodium channel ENaC likely exists in microdomains of Ca2+ signaling and that these domains are maintained by belts of mitochondria within the renal epithelial cell. Because this is the first work suggesting the existence of mitochondrial barriers to [Ca2+]i movement in renal epithelia, much work remains to be done to determine what role these barriers play in the regulation of other proteins or systemic blood pressure.

Material and Methods The material for the study consisted of the reference strain M. haemolytica serotype 1 (ATCC®) BAA-410™, reference serotypes A1, A2, A5, A6, A7, A9 and A11, and wild-type isolates of M. haemolytica. Bacteriophages were induced from an overnight bacterial starter culture of all examined M. haemolytica strains treated with mitomycin C. The lytic properties and host ranges were determined by plaque assays. The morphology of the bacteriophages was examined in negative-stained smears with 5% uranyl acetate solution using a transmission electron microscope. The genetic analysis of the bacteriophages was followed by restriction analysis of bacteriophage DNA. This was followed by analysis of genetic material by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results Eight bacteriophages were obtained, like typical of the families Myoviridae, Siphoviridae and Podoviridae. Most of the bacteriophages exhibited lytic properties against the M. haemolytica strains. Restriction analysis revealed similarities to the P2-like phage obtained from the strain M. haemolytica BAA-410. The most similar profiles were observed in the case of bacteriophages φA1 and φA5. All of the bacteriophages obtained were characterized by the presence of additional fragments in the restriction profiles with respect to the P2-like reference phage. In the analysis of PCR products for the P2-like reference phage phi-MhaA1-PHL101 (DQ426904) and the phages of the M. haemolytica serotypes, a 734-bp phage PCR product was obtained. The primers were programmed in Primer-Blast software using the structure of the sequence DQ426904 of reference phage PHL101. Conclusions The results obtained indicate the need for further research aimed at isolating and characterizing bacteriophages, including sequence analysis of selected fragments. Moreover, standardization of methods for obtaining them in order to eliminate M. haemolytica bacteria involved in the etiopathogenesis of BRDC is essential."

In budding yeast, H3K4 methylation is catalyzed by the Set1-COMPASS methyltransferase complex and is removed by Jhd2, a JMJC domain family demethylase. The catalytic JmjC and JmjN domains of Jhd2 have the ability to remove all three degrees (mono-, di-, and tri-) of H3K4 methylation. Jhd2 also contains a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger required for its chromatin association and H3K4 demethylase functions. The Jhd2 PHD finger associates with chromatin independent of H3K4 methylation and the H3 N-terminal tail. Therefore, how Jhd2 associates with chromatin to perform H3K4 demethylation has remained unknown. We report a novel interaction between the Jhd2 PHD finger and histone H2A. Two residues in H2A (Phe-26 and Glu-57) serve as a binding site for Jhd2 in vitro and mediate its chromatin association and H3K4 demethylase functions in vivo. Using RNA sequencing, we have identified the functional target genes for Jhd2 and the H2A Phe-26 and Glu-57 residues. We demonstrate that H2A Phe-26 and Glu-57 residues control chromatin association and H3K4 demethylase functions of Jhd2 during positive or negative regulation of transcription at target genes. Importantly, we show that H2B Lys-123 ubiquitination blocks Jhd2 from accessing its binding site on chromatin, and thereby, we have uncovered a second mechanism by which H2B ubiquitination contributes to the trans-histone regulation of H3K4 methylation.

We previously also showed that the association of Jhd2 with chromatin is not dependent on its substrate (H3K4 methylation) or the H3 N-terminal tail (amino acids 2–28) (26.Huang F.

Whereas H3K4 methylation is well connected to gene transcription, how Jhd2 contributes to this process is also not fully understood. Madhani and co-workers (38.Xu M. Soloveychik M. Ranger M.

They showed that during spore differentiation, Jhd2 activates protein-coding gene transcription by countering the transcriptional shut-off that normally occurs at this developmental stage. Apart from this study, target genes of Jhd2 and contributions of Jhd2 to their regulation have remained poorly defined. In this study, we demonstrate an interaction between the Jhd2 PHD finger and histone H2A. Using mutational analyses, we have identified two residues in H2A, Phe-26 and Glu-57, as being important for the ability of Jhd2 to bind histone H2A in vitro and also for the chromatin association and H3K4 demethylase functions of Jhd2 in vivo. Using RNA-seq for gene expression analysis, we have identified common functional target genes for Jhd2 and the two H2A residues. We show that the H2A Phe-26 and Glu-57 residues mediate proper chromatin association and H3K4 demethylase functions of Jhd2 at target loci in vivo. Importantly, we also describe how access to these sites on H2A by Jhd2 is regulated by H2BK123 monoubiquitination, providing another mode by which H2BK123 monoubiquitination acts in the trans-histone regulation of H3K4 methylation via the control of both H3K4 demethylase functions as well as the H3K4 methyltransferase activity. Collectively, our study provides insights into the mechanism by which the Jhd2 H3K4 demethylase associates with chromatin and functions during transcriptional regulation. For recombinant H2A production in bacteria, mutations or deletions were introduced into HTA1 using PCR and mobilized as an NdeI-BamHI fragment to replace the wild-type sequence in H2A-pET11a (39.Wittmeyer J.

Alanine substitution mutants of H2A created in HTA1-HTB1-pRS313 for expression in yeast were described previously (66.Matsubara K. Sano N. Umehara T. Horikoshi M.

For the UBP8 γ-knock-out construct, ∼400-bp regions upstream of the UBP8 start codon and downstream of the stop codon were PCR-amplified. An overlap PCR strategy was used to combine these two UBP8 fragments and to include an intervening SacII site. The resulting 800-bp PCR product was cloned into the XbaI-SacI sites in YIPlac211. All constructs created using PCR-amplified products were verified by DNA sequencing. Yeast cells were grown in YPAD broth (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose, and 0.004% adenine hemisulfate) or in synthetic dropout media. Liquid broth supplemented with 2% agar was used to prepare solid media. Gene deletion strains were created by transforming PCR products containing the target locus and an inserted KanMX6 selection cassette amplified using genomic DNA isolated from the respective deletion mutant strains present in the Open Biosystem yeast gene knock-out collection. Epitope tagging of Jhd2 with 12 copies of V5 at its C terminus was performed by PCR amplification using pFA6a-12Pk-kanMX6 (40.Gadaleta M.C. Iwasaki O. Noguchi C. Noma K. Noguchi E.

Histone mutations were mobilized and expressed in yeast strains derived from parental Y131 or FY406 strains using a standard plasmid shuffle approach. UBP10 was deleted in YMC85 by transforming a PCR product containing 500-bp regions upstream and downstream of the UBP10 ORF replaced with a NatMX4 selection module. This PCR product was amplified using genomic DNA from the UCC6398 strain (55.Gardner R.G. Nelson Z.W. Gottschling D.E.

https://openalex.org/W2180597389,"Activation of the nuclear hormone receptor, PPARγ, with pharmacological agonists promotes a contractile vascular smooth muscle cell phenotype and reduces oxidative stress and cell proliferation, particularly under pathological conditions including vascular injury, restenosis, and atherosclerosis. However, pharmacological agonists activate both PPARγ-dependent and -independent mechanisms in multiple cell types confounding efforts to clarify the precise role of PPARγ in smooth muscle cell structure and function in vivo. We, therefore, designed and characterized a mouse model with smooth muscle cell-targeted PPARγ overexpression (smPPARγOE). Our results demonstrate that smPPARγOE attenuated contractile responses in aortic rings, increased aortic compliance, caused aortic dilatation, and reduced mean arterial pressure. Molecular characterization revealed that compared to littermate control mice, aortas from smPPARγOE mice expressed lower levels of contractile proteins and increased levels of adipocyte-specific transcripts. Morphological analysis demonstrated increased lipid deposition in the vascular media and in smooth muscle of extravascular tissues. In vitro adenoviral-mediated PPARγ overexpression in human aortic smooth muscle cells similarly increased adipocyte markers and lipid uptake. The findings demonstrate that smooth muscle PPARγ overexpression disrupts vascular wall structure and function, emphasizing that balanced PPARγ activity is essential for vascular smooth muscle homeostasis."

https://openalex.org/W2228998705,"Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) serotype O103 is a zoonotic pathogen that is capable of causing hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) in humans. The main animal reservoir for STEC is ruminants and hence reducing the levels of this pathogen in cattle could ultimately lower the risk of STEC infection in humans. During the process of infection, STECO103 uses a Type III Secretion System (T3SS) to secrete effector proteins (T3SPs) that result in the formation of attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions. Vaccination of cattle with STEC serotype O157 T3SPs has previously been shown to be effective in reducing shedding of STECO157 in a serotype-specific manner. In this study, we tested the ability of rabbit polyclonal sera against individual STECO103 T3SPs to block adherence of the organism to HEp-2 cells. Our results demonstrate that pooled sera against EspA, EspB, EspF, NleA and Tir significantly lowered the adherence of STECO103 relative to pre-immune sera. Likewise, pooled anti-STECO103 sera were also able to block adherence by STECO157. Vaccination of mice with STECO103 recombinant proteins induced strong IgG antibody responses against EspA, EspB, NleA and Tir but not against EspF. However, the vaccine did not affect fecal shedding of STECO103 compared to the PBS vaccinated group over the duration of the experiment. Cross reactivity studies using sera against STECO103 recombinant proteins revealed a high degree of cross reactivity with STECO26 and STECO111 proteins implying that sera against STECO103 proteins could potentially provide neutralization of attachment to epithelial cells by heterologous STEC serotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2223870788,"This research is the first empirical attempt to calculate the various components of the hidden bias associated with the sampling strategies routinely-used in human genetics, with special reference to surname-based strategies. We reconstructed surname distributions of 26 Italian communities with different demographic features across the last six centuries (years 1447-2001). The degree of overlapping between ""reference founding core"" distributions and the distributions obtained from sampling the present day communities by probabilistic and selective methods was quantified under different conditions and models. When taking into account only one individual per surname (low kinship model), the average discrepancy was 59.5%, with a peak of 84% by random sampling. When multiple individuals per surname were considered (high kinship model), the discrepancy decreased by 8-30% at the cost of a larger variance. Criteria aimed at maximizing locally-spread patrilineages and long-term residency appeared to be affected by recent gene flows much more than expected. Selection of the more frequent family names following low kinship criteria proved to be a suitable approach only for historically stable communities. In any other case true random sampling, despite its high variance, did not return more biased estimates than other selective methods. Our results indicate that the sampling of individuals bearing historically documented surnames (founders' method) should be applied, especially when studying the male-specific genome, to prevent an over-stratification of ancient and recent genetic components that heavily biases inferences and statistics."
https://openalex.org/W2188372985,"Metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) hydrolyze almost all classes of β-lactam antibiotic, including carbapenems—currently first choice drugs for opportunistic infections by Gram-negative bacterial pathogens. MBL inhibitor development is complicated by the diversity within this group of enzymes, and by the appearance of new enzymes that continue to be identified both as chromosomal genes and on mobile genetic elements. One such newly discovered MBL is DIM-1, a mobile enzyme originally discovered in the opportunist pathogen Pseudomonas stutzeri but subsequently identified in other species and locations. DIM-1 is a subclass B1 MBL more closely related to the TMB-1, GIM-1 and IMP enzymes than to other clinically encountered MBLs such as VIM and NDM; and possesses Arg, rather than the more usual Lys, at position 224 in the putative substrate binding site. Here we report the crystallization and structure determination of DIM-1. DIM-1 possesses a binuclear metal center with a 5 (rather than the more usual 4) co-ordinate tri-histidine (Zn1) site and both 4- and 5-co-ordinate Cys-His-Asp- (Zn2) sites observed in the two molecules of the crystallographic asymmetric unit. These data indicate a degree of variability in metal co-ordination geometry in the DIM-1 active site, as well as facilitating inclusion of DIM-1 in structure-based MBL inhibitor discovery programmes."
https://openalex.org/W2217298233,"Considering a preferential selection mechanism of load destination, we introduce a new method to quantify initial load distribution and subsequently construct a simple cascading model. By attacking the node with the highest load, we investigate the cascading dynamics in some synthetic networks. Surprisingly, we observe that for several networks of different structural patterns, a counterintuitive phenomenon emerges if the highest load attack is applied to the system, i.e., investing more resources to protect every node in a network inversely makes the whole network more vulnerable. We explain this ability paradox by analyzing the micro-structural components of the underlying network and therefore reveals how specific structural patterns may influence the cascading dynamics. We discover that the robustness of the network oscillates as the capacity of each node increases. The conclusion of the paper may shed lights on future investigations to avoid the demonstrated ability paradox and subsequent cascading failures in real-world networks."

https://openalex.org/W2214135243,"The sequential organization of sound over time can interact with the concurrent organization of sounds across frequency. Previous studies using simple acoustic stimuli have suggested that sequential streaming cues can retroactively affect the perceptual organization of sounds that have already occurred. It is unknown whether such effects generalize to the perception of speech sounds. Listeners’ ability to identify two simultaneously presented vowels was measured in the following conditions: no context, a preceding context stream (precursors), and a following context stream (postcursors). The context stream was comprised of brief repetitions of one of the two vowels, and the primary measure of performance was listeners’ ability to identify the other vowel. Results in the precursor condition showed a significant advantage for the identification of the second vowel compared to the no-context condition, suggesting that sequential grouping mechanisms aided the segregation of the concurrent vowels, in agreement with previous work. However, performance in the postcursor condition was significantly worse compared to the no-context condition, providing no evidence for an effect of stream segregation, and suggesting a possible interference effect. Two additional experiments involving inharmonic (jittered) vowels were performed to provide additional cues to aid retroactive stream segregation; however, neither manipulation enabled listeners to improve their identification of the target vowel. Taken together with earlier studies, the results suggest that retroactive streaming may require large spectral differences between concurrent sources and thus may not provide a robust segregation cue for natural broadband sounds such as speech."
