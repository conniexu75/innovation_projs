https://openalex.org/W2050088688,"THE antibacterial effect of numerous bioflavonoids is not yet known, and on the basis of chemical structure it seemed worth while to investigate the possible antibacterial effect of fisetin, dihydrofisetin and fisetinidin chloride. Fisetin and dihydrofisetin are commercial products, but we have synthesized fisetinidin chloride. Fisetin is found in Butea frondosa, Gleditschia triacanthos, Quebracho Colorado and the genus Rhus1,2."

There was, however, no significant increase in the percentage of multiple births with this treatment."
