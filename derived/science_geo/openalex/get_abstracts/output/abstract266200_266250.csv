https://openalex.org/W2067368961,"Similarities of middle anld upper Paleozoic deposits of the Ellsworth fountains with those of the Pensacola, Horlick, and other Transtarctic mountains indicate that all these ranges may have had a related geologic history. A native explanation is now suggested which involves sea-floor spreading atnd anslocationi of the Ellsworth crutstal block from its originilal location adjacent to the East Antarctic Shield. Accordingly, the islands of West Antarctica may differ it origin and the Transantarctic Mountains of East Antarctica may represent one margin of an ancient rift."

The most important characteristics of such clays are their vertical and lateral uniformity, low permeability, very high cation retention capacity, and potential for self-healing when disturbed. The most attractive abyssal clay formation (oxidized red clay) covers nearly 30 percent of the sea floor and hence 20 percent of the earth's surface."
https://openalex.org/W2035093587,"Examination of synthetic ilmenite-hematite samples by transmission electron microscopy has for the first time revealed the presence of well-defined antiphase domains and antiphase domain boundaries in this mineral system. Samples quenched from 1300 degrees C have a high density of domain boundaries, whereas samples quenched from 900 degrees C have a much lower density. Only the high-temperature samples acquire reverse thermoremanent magnetism when cooled in an applied magnetic field. The presence of a high density of domain boundaries seems to be a necessary condition for the acquisition of reverse thermoremanent magnetism."

https://openalex.org/W2004774402,Archeological deposits have been discovered in three pimple mounds on the upper Texas coast. Such incorporation indicates that (i) these particular mounds are aggradational rather than erosional in origin; (ii) mound formation continued until at least A.D. 1100 to 1200; (iii) each mound took 300 to 500 years to form; (iv) mounds within the same mound field did not form simultaneously; (v) certain Gulf Coast pimple mounds have archeological research potential; and (vi) archeological data also offer a means for investigating mound formation.

https://openalex.org/W2159927021,(1) It becomes increasingly evident that continued root growth with the establishment of new root-soil contacts is necessary for the normal entrance of both water and mineral nutrients into the root. This concept emphasizes the ecological importance of factors tending either to impede or favor the spread and permeation of roots in the soil.

https://openalex.org/W2009442795,The value of 31.56 +/- 0.74 days for the synodic month in the Upper Cambrian is used together with a maximum in the expected number of days in a synodic month to argue that solar tidal dissipation is important in the dynamics of the earth-moon system and that the moment of inertia of the earth cannot have been much larger then than it is now. The tendency of the measurements to remain near 30 days may be a resonance effect.
