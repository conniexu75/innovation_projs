This study was conducted to examine the psychometric properties of the Simplified Chinese version of the PSS-10 in policewomen. Methodology A total of 240 policewomen were recruited in this study. The Simplified Chinese versions of the PSS-10, the Beck Depression Inventory Revised (BDI-II), and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) were administered to all participants, and 36 of the participants were re-tested two weeks after the initial testing. Principal Findings The overall Cronbach's alpha was 0.86, and the test–retest reliability coefficient was 0.68. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) yielded 2 factors with eigenvalues of 4.76 and 1.48, accounting for 62.41% of variance. Factor 1 consisted of 6 items representing “negative feelings”; whereas Factor 2 consisted of 4 items representing “positive feelings”. The item loadings ranged from 0.72 to 0.83. The Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) indicated a very good fit of this two-factor model to this sample. The PSS-10 significantly correlated with both BDI-II and BAI, indicating an acceptable concurrent validity. Conclusions The Simplified Chinese version of the PSS-10 demonstrated adequate psychometric properties for evaluating stress levels. The results support its use among the Chinese population."
https://openalex.org/W2008386236,"Microalgae are thought to offer great potential as expression system for various industrial, therapeutic and diagnostic recombinant proteins as they combine high growth rates with all benefits of eukaryotic expression systems. Moreover, microalgae exhibit a phototrophic lifestyle like land plants, hence protein expression is fuelled by photosynthesis, which is CO(2)-neutral and involves only low production costs. So far, however, research on algal bioreactors for recombinant protein expression is very rare calling for further investigations in this highly promising field. In this study, we present data on the expression of a monoclonal human IgG antibody against the Hepatitis B surface protein and the respective antigen in the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Antibodies are fully-assembled and functional and accumulate to 8.7% of total soluble protein, which complies with 21 mg antibody per gram algal dry weight. The Hepatitis B surface protein is functional as well and is recognized by algae-produced and commercial antibodies."

Although systematic characterization of this family has been carried out in Arabidopsis and rice, little is known about HD-Zip genes in maize (Zea mays L.).In this study, we described the identification and structural characterization of HD-Zip genes in the maize genome. A complete set of 55 HD-Zip genes (Zmhdz1-55) were identified in the maize genome using Blast search tools and categorized into four classes (HD-Zip I-IV) based on phylogeny. Chromosomal location of these genes revealed that they are distributed unevenly across all 10 chromosomes. Segmental duplication contributed largely to the expansion of the maize HD-ZIP gene family, while tandem duplication was only responsible for the amplification of the HD-Zip II genes. Furthermore, most of the maize HD-Zip I genes were found to contain an overabundance of stress-related cis-elements in their promoter sequences. The expression levels of the 17 HD-Zip I genes under drought stress were also investigated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). All of the 17 maize HD-ZIP I genes were found to be regulated by drought stress, and the duplicated genes within a sister pair exhibited the similar expression patterns, suggesting their conserved functions during the process of evolution.Our results reveal a comprehensive overview of the maize HD-Zip gene family and provide the first step towards the selection of Zmhdz genes for cloning and functional research to uncover their roles in maize growth and development."
https://openalex.org/W2008697475,"H2S is an endogenous signaling molecule that may act via protein sulfhydrylation to regulate various physiological functions. H2S is also a byproduct of dietary sulfate metabolism by gut bacteria. Inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis are associated with an increase in the colonization of the intestine by sulfate reducing bacteria along with an increase in H2S production. Consistent with its increased production, H2S is implicated as a mediator of ulcerative colitis both in its genesis or maintenance. As T cells are well established mediators of inflammatory bowel disease, we investigated the effect of H2S exposure on T cell activation. Using primary mouse T lymphocytes (CD3+), OT-II CD4+ T cells, and the human Jurkat T cell line, we show that physiological levels of H2S potentiate TCR-induced activation. Nanomolar levels of H2S (50–500 nm) enhance T cell activation assessed by CD69 expression, interleukin-2 expression, and CD25 levels. Exposure of T cells to H2S dose-dependently enhances TCR-stimulated proliferation with a maximum at 300 nm (30% increase, p < 0.01). Furthermore, activation increases the capacity of T cells to make H2S via increased expression of cystathionine γ-lyase and cystathionine β-synthase. Disrupting this response by silencing these H2S producing enzymes impairs T cell activation, and proliferation and can be rescued by the addition of 300 nm H2S. Thus, H2S represents a novel autocrine immunomodulatory molecule in T cells.

Although the role of H2S signaling has been characterized in many other tissues and systems, it is unclear what role it plays in the regulation of the adaptive immune system. H2S is produced from dietary sulfate metabolism in the lumen of the large intestine by anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacteria (22Levine J. Ellis C.J. Furne J.K. Springfield J. Levitt M.D. Fecal hydrogen sulfide production in ulcerative colitis.Am. J. Gastroenterol. 1998; 93: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Clinical studies indicate that inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis are associated with an increase in the colonization of the intestine by sulfate-reducing bacteria along with an increase in the levels of H2S produced (23Gibson G.R.

Estimation of hydrogen sulfide in the human lymphocytes.Indian J. Biochem. Biophys. 2007; 44: 179-182PubMed Google Scholar), although the proliferation of a cytotoxic CD8+ subset was inhibited by what we now consider supraphysiological doses of H2S (34Mirandola P. Gobbi G.

H2S refers to any of its various protonation states (H2S → HS− + H+ → S2− + H+) with HS− being the predominant form at physiological pH (pKa = 6.8). Na2S and NaHS are the corresponding sodium salts of these anionic forms of H2S and are thus considered H2S donors at physiological pH and are used as sources of H2S for this study. GYY4137 is also used as a slow-releasing H2S donor as characterized in Li et al. (35Li L. Whiteman M. Guan Y.Y. Neo K.L. Cheng Y. Lee S.W. Zhao Y. Baskar R. Tan C.H. Moore P.K.

C57Bl/6 and OT-II mice were anesthetized and sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and their spleens were harvested for T cell culture. OT-II mice and OVA1–47 were kind gifts of the laboratory of Dr. Richard Morgan (NCI, NIH). The spleens were gently ruptured in a 40-μm cell strainer (BD Biosciences) placed over a 50-ml Falcon tube using the back end of a 6-cc syringe plunger. The cells were rinsed-through with basal RPMI (0.1% BSA) and centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min. CD3+ T cells were purified by using a pan T cell isolation kit II and MACS MS columns (Miltenyi Biotec) without prior red-cell lysis according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were resuspended in 10 ml of RPMI containing 10% FBS, glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin and plated in a flask for 30 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Care and handling of animals was in accordance with the Animal Care and Use Committees of the National Cancer Institute (Protocol LP-012). Wild-type Jurkat T cells (E6.1, ATCC), enhanced GFP-actin, and EYFP-tubulin expressing clones (a kind gift of Dr. Lawrence Samelson, NIH (37Bunnell S.C. Kapoor V. Trible R.P. Zhang W. Samelson L.E.

Cells were maintained in culture for a maximum of 4 weeks. For cell activation studies, Jurkat cells were resuspended in basal medium (RPMI, glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and 0.1% BSA). Unless specified otherwise, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma. GYY4137 was purchased from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). For T cell activation, wells of either 6- or 96-well plates were coated overnight with a mixture of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies (mouse cells, clones 17A2 and 37.51, respectively, BD Biosciences; Jurkat cells, OKT3 and CD28.2, functional grade, eBioscience) at 2 and 5 μg/ml, respectively, in PBS without cations. The following day wells were washed twice with PBS to remove unbound antibody, and cells were added in growth medium for stimulation. The concentrations of H2S used for this study are derived from the EC50 concentrations of H2S (from NaHS or Na2S) used for stimulation of T cell proliferation (see Fig. 3). Also, the steady state concentration of H2S will depend on how much is added exogenously or made endogenously and the rate of its degradation. The degradation of H2S both enzymatically and nonenzymatically depends largely on O2 concentration (38Tiranti V. Viscomi C. Hildebrandt T. Di Meo I. Mineri R. Tiveron C. Levitt M.D. Prelle A. Fagiolari G. Rimoldi M. Zeviani M. Loss of ETHE1, a mitochondrial dioxygenase, causes fatal sulfide toxicity in ethylmalonic encephalopathy.Nat. Med. 2009; 15: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Minimizing the O2 levels maximizes available H2S. Due to this, we conducted the experiments at 1% O2 and 94% N2 using a hypoxic chamber (MIC-101, Billups-Rothenberg, Inc., Del Mar, CA) unless stated otherwise. T cells were washed with PBS supplemented with 0.1% BSA and 0.01% azide (FACS buffer) and stained using anti-CD69-FITC (BD Biosciences) or anti-CD25 (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with a FACS Caliber and CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). To monitor cell adhesion we used an ACEA real time label-free cell monitoring system (Xcelligence, Roche Applied Science) (39Atienza J.M. Zhu J. Wang X. Xu X. Abassi Y. Dynamic monitoring of cell adhesion and spreading on microelectronic sensor arrays.J. Biomol. Screen. 2005; 10: 795-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). 50 μl of basal media was allowed to incubate for 15 min in each well of an 8-well RT-CES plate at 37 °C, 5% CO2. An additional 50 μl containing 25,000 Jurkat cells and the specified treatments were added to the wells, and the cell index was measured at 30-s intervals. All data are normalized to 15 min after cell addition, when all cells have settled to the bottom of the well. Antigen-presenting cells often vary in the distribution of major histocompatibility complexes, making the use of an antibody-coated surface advantageous in these experiments as it provides a simpler and more homogenous stimulus necessary for quantifying cytoskeletal changes (37Bunnell S.C. Kapoor V. Trible R.P. Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Dynamic actin polymerization drives T cell receptor-induced spreading. A role for the signal transduction adaptor LAT.Immunity. 2001; 14: 315-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The glass surface also allows for a single orientation of activated cells and a high degree of cell polarization. The microtubule organizing complex (MTOC) of Jurkat cells that are maximally activated by the antibody-coated surface should be at the center of the cell contact point (x,y plane) and directly above the contact surface (x,z plane) (40Baratt A. Arkhipov S.N. Maly I.V. An experimental and computational study of effects of microtubule stabilization on T cell polarity.PLoS One. 2008; 3: e3861Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Likewise, previous studies have indicated that TCR-specific antibody-coated microspheres can serve as artificial antigen-presenting cells by providing a focal stimulus capable of inducing MTOC reorientation to the immunological synapse (41Lowin-Kropf B. Shapiro V.S. Weiss A. Cytoskeletal polarization of T cells is regulated by an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif-dependent mechanism.J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 861-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Both are used to assess cytoskeletal changes in this study. 8-Chambered Lab-tek coverslips (Nunc) were coated with either 0.01% w/v poly-l-lysine solution (Sigma) or anti-CD3/anti-CD28 antibodies (1 and 5 μg/ml) in PBS overnight at 4 °C and then washed with PBS. EYFP-tubulin- or enhanced GFP-actin-expressing Jurkat cells (50,000 cells) in basal RPMI medium were added to the wells and allowed to incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 with specified treatments before imaging on the confocal microscope. Confocal images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 510 NLO confocal system (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NJ) with a 63× Plan-Apochromat 1.4 NA oil immersion objective. Z-stacked images were acquired at 512 × 512 pixels per frame using an 8-bit pixel depth for each channel and line averaging set to 4 collected sequentially in a multi-track, 3 channel mode. In 6-well plates, 1–3 × 106 cells for each condition were maintained in 1 or 20% O2 for the specified amount of time. The cells were harvested, and mRNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was synthesized from 1–5 μg of mRNA using superscript first-strand RT-PCR reagents (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Quantitative real-time-PCR was then performed using the SYBR Green kit (Thermo) on the following gene/primer sets: hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase, CD69, IL-2, CSE, CBS, SQR (sequences Table 1). Hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase was used as the internal control for expression based on previous reports of its superior stability over other commonly used control genes (42de Kok J.B.

Jurkat T cells (2 × 106) were co-transfected with 5 μg of each reporter plasmid and 1 μg of the Renilla luciferase construct using an Amaxa nucleofector system (program X-001). After transfection, the cells were cultured in RPMI containing 10% FBS, glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin overnight followed by stimulation in antibody-coated 96-well plates for the indicated amount of time (determined by time-course for maximum signal). Cells were lysed by adding 20 μl of passive lysis buffer to 100 μl of cells for 5 min after triturating. The dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) was used for the quantification of reporter gene expression. Luciferase activities were determined using a Turner Biosystems 20/20N luminometer. Transcription factor-driven firefly luciferase activity was normalized by dividing firefly luciferase units by the units corresponding to Renilla luciferase activity. Jurkat cells were assayed at 5 × 105 cells per condition in 0.5 ml of basal media (RPMI, glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, 0.01% BSA). The cells were incubated for 4 h with the indicated concentrations of NaHS and diethylenetriamine/NONOate at 37 °C. The cells were then lysed, and total intracellular cGMP levels were measured via an immunoassay using a cGMP kit (GE/Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cGMP levels were normalized to control non-diethylenetriamine/NONOate-treated samples. siRNAs were synthesized using the Silencer siRNA Construction kit (AP Biosystems). Three different siRNAs were made to target each gene (CBS and CSE) based on primers selected from the Ambion siRNA target finder web application. Each siRNA transfection represented in the text is an equal mixture of each of the following three individual siRNAs targeting unique exons for maximum potency (sequences in Table 2).TABLE 2Sequences for siRNA synthesisHuman siRNAs; CBSExon 4Sense strand siRNA, GGGGUCCCCAGAGGAUAAGttAntisense strand siRNA, CUUAUCCUCUGGGGACCCCttExon 7Sense strand siRNA, GAUGAGCUCCGAGAAGGUGttAntisense strand siRNA, CACCUUCUCGGAGCUCAUCttExon 16Sense strand siRNA, AGUCAUCUACAAGCAGUUCttAntisense strand siRNA, GAACUGCUUGUAGAUGACUttMouse siRNAsCSEExon 1Sense strand siRNA, GAGCCUGAGCAAUGGAAUUttAntisense strand siRNA, AAUUCCAUUGCUCAGGCUCttExon 2Sense strand siRNA, CAAGGAAUUGCUUGGAAAAttAntisense strand siRNA, UUUUCCAAGCAAUUCCUUGttExon 4Sense strand siRNA, AACCAAAUUGCUAGAGGCAttAntisense strand siRNA, UGCCUCUAGCAAUUUGGUUttCBSExon 14Sense strand siRNA, GUCUGCAAAGUCCUCUACAttAntisense strand siRNA, UGUAGAGGACUUUGCAGACttExon 10Sense strand siRNA, GUGGUUCAAGAGCAACGAUttAntisense strand siRNA, AUCGUUGCUCUUGAACCACttExon 9Sense strand siRNA, ACAGCCUAUGAGGUGGAAGttAntisense strand siRNA, CUUCCACCUCAUAGGCUGUtt Open table in a new tab Mouse T cells were harvested as above, and CD3+ T cells were purified by using a pan T cell isolation kit II and MACS MS columns (Miltenyi Biotec) without prior red-cell lysis according to the manufacturer's protocol. Purified T cells were then transfected with 30 pmol of siRNA cocktails using a mouse T cell nucleofection kit and an Amaxa nucleofector (program X-01) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Jurkat cells were maintained in antibiotic-free RPMI growth medium and transfected using nucleofection kit V and program X-01 according to the manufacturer's protocol. After transfection, the cells were cultured in RPMI containing 10% FBS, glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin 16 h followed by stimulation in antibody-coated 96-well plates for 72 h with specified analyses. We first assessed the effect of physiological (nm) H2S concentrations on T cell activation. CD69 expression is one of the earliest events following TCR-mediated T cell activation (44Hara T. Jung L.K. Bjorndahl J.M. Fu S.M. Human T cell activation. III. Rapid induction of a phosphorylated 28/32-kD disulfide-linked early activation antigen (EA1) by 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate, mitogens, and antigens.J. Exp. Med. 1986; 164: 1988-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Using quantitative real-time-PCR to assess CD69 mRNA expression, anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation of freshly isolated mouse T cells led to a time-dependent increase in CD69 expression (Fig. 1A). CD69 expression was significantly (p < 0.05) increased at 4 and 10 h post-stimulation in the presence of 300 nm H2S. Mouse T cell CD69 expression was also dose-dependently increased at 6 h post-stimulation in the presence of H2S (50, 500 nm) by 30 and 100%, respectively (Fig. 1B). Other markers of T cell activation were also enhanced in the presence of 300 nm H2S such as IL-2 and CD25 mRNA expression (Fig. 1, C and D). Human Jurkat T-lymphoma cells serve as a continuous cell line that is widely used to study T cell activation. CD69 and IL-2 induction were similarly enhanced in Jurkat cells activated by anti-CD3 and CD28 antibodies (Fig. 1, E and F). Consistent with increases in CD69 mRNA, CD69 protein expression was enhanced by polyclonal activation (Fig. 1G) and was dose-dependently enhanced by H2S in activated Jurkat cells (Fig. 1H). CD69 expression was enhanced by 27% in the presence of 100 nm H2S and 33% in the presence of 50 μm of the H2S donor molecule GYY4137 corresponding to a steady state H2S concentration of 200 nm (Fig. 1I). In addition to polyclonal stimulation of T cell activation, we tested the ability of H2S to enhance antigen-specific T cell activation. CD4+ T cells freshly isolated from OT-II mice were co-stimulated with 1 μg/ml OVA-2 peptide and 5 μg/ml anti-CD28 antibody with and without H2S treatment (300 nm). H2S significantly enhanced OVA-2 peptide stimulation of IL-2 expression at 6 and 24 h (Fig. 2A). In addition, 100 nm H2S enhanced OVA-2 stimulation of CD25 protein levels by 30% (Fig. 2B). T cell activation induces cytoskeletal rearrangements necessary for full activation and polarization toward an antigen-presenting cell (45Vicente-Manzanares M. Sánchez-Madrid F.

We previously characterized several Arabidopsis thaliana mutants with dominant mutations in REDUCED EPIDERMAL FLUORESCENCE 4 (REF4) that cause dwarfing and decreased accumulation of phenylpropanoids. In contrast, ref4 null plants are of normal stature and have no apparent defect in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Here we show that disruption of both REF4 and its paralog, REF4-RELATED 1 (RFR1), results in enhanced expression of multiple phenylpropanoid biosynthetic genes, as well as increased accumulation of numerous downstream products. We also show that the dominant ref4-3 mutant protein interferes with the ability of the PAP1/MYB75 transcription factor to induce the expression of PAL1 and drive anthocyanin accumulation. Consistent with our experimental results, both REF4 and RFR1 have been shown to physically associate with the conserved transcriptional coregulatory complex, Mediator, which transduces information from cis-acting DNA elements to RNA polymerase II at the core promoter. Taken together, our data provide critical genetic support for a functional role of REF4 and RFR1 in the Mediator complex, and for Mediator in the maintenance of phenylpropanoid homeostasis. Finally, we show that wild-type RFR1 substantially mitigates the phenotype of the dominant ref4-3 mutant, suggesting that REF4 and RFR1 may compete with one another for common binding partners or for occupancy in Mediator. Determining the functions of diverse Mediator subunits is essential to understand eukaryotic gene regulation, and to facilitate rational manipulation of plant metabolic pathways to better suit human needs.

The phenylpropanoids are a diverse group of specialized metabolites in plants that are synthesized from phenylalanine and play a variety of roles in growth, reproduction, and interactions with the biotic and abiotic environment. Hydroxycinnamyl alcohols (or monolignols) serve as monomers for the synthesis of the complex secondary wall polymer lignin (1.Bonawitz N.D. Chapple C. The genetics of lignin biosynthesis.

Integrating terrestrial and oceanic components.Science. 1998; 281: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (3940) Google Scholar). Soluble phenylpropanoids are similarly important in plant ecology, where they act variously to absorb damaging ultraviolet light, defend against pathogens, repel herbivores, or attract pollinators (5.Umezawa T. The cinnamate/monolignol pathway.Phytochem. Rev. 2010; 9: 1-17Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In addition to their essential roles in ensuring plant fitness, phenylpropanoid metabolites also exert a substantial influence on the utility of plants to suit human needs. The inhibitory effect of lignin on polysaccharide extraction from bulk biomass, for instance, is one of the major limitations in the cost effectiveness of cellulosic biofuel production (6.Boudet A.M.

Furthermore, products of the phenylpropanoid pathway found in the diet, such as anthocyanins, isoflavonols, lignans, and hydroxycinnamic acids, have been shown to act as antioxidants or modulators of mammalian hormone signaling pathways, and their consumption is correlated with reduced incidence of cancer, heart disease, and other chronic health problems (9.Adlercreutz H.

An understanding of phenylpropanoid metabolism is therefore essential both to provide greater insight into the basic biology of plants, and to inform bioengineering strategies aimed at the genetic improvement of bioenergy and food crops. The biochemical pathways responsible for the synthesis of a number of different phenylpropanoids have been elucidated, such as those leading to the production of monolignols, anthocyanins, flavonols, and various hydroxycinnamate esters (1.Bonawitz N.D.

A colorful model for genetics, biochemistry, cell biology, and biotechnology.Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 485-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (2567) Google Scholar). More recently, the complex hierarchical network of transcriptional activators and repressors regulating the temporal and spatial control of different phenylpropanoids has begun to be unraveled, particularly in the model angiosperm Arabidopsis thaliana (5.Umezawa T. The cinnamate/monolignol pathway.Phytochem. Rev. 2010; 9: 1-17Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 15.Rogers L.A. Campbell M.M.

Regulation of cell wall biosynthesis.Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2007; 10: 564-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The synthesis of anthocyanins, for instance, is controlled by a set of closely related MYB transcription factors (PAP1/MYB75, PAP2/MYB90, MYB113, and MYB114) that stimulate the transcription of both general phenylpropanoid and anthocyanin-specific genes (17.Gonzalez A. Zhao M. Leavitt J.M. Lloyd A.M. Regulation of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway by the TTG1/bHLH/Myb transcriptional complex in Arabidopsis seedlings.Plant J. 2008; 53: 814-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). Constitutive expression of PAP1/MYB75 alone is sufficient to induce the expression of the entire anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway, and plants containing an activation-tagged allele of this transcription factor accumulate clearly visible amounts of anthocyanin pigments throughout their tissues (18.Borevitz J.O. Xia Y. Blount J. Dixon R.A. Lamb C. Activation tagging identifies a conserved MYB regulator of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis.Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 2383-2394Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). Despite substantial recent progress, however, a great deal of the regulation of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis remains poorly understood, especially with respect to the homeostatic mechanisms by which the levels of different metabolites are coordinated and maintained within a narrowly defined target range. The genetic regulation of many eukaryotic genes requires a large co-regulatory complex known as Mediator, which physically bridges the interaction between gene-specific transcription factors and the basal transcription machinery at the core promoter (19.Flanagan P.M. Kelleher 3rd, R.J. Sayre M.H. Tschochner H. Kornberg R.D.

Found in all eukaryotes, Mediator consists of some 20–30 different protein subunits that associate with one another in four domains, referred to as the head, middle, tail, and kinase domains (21.Bourbon H.M. Aguilera A. Ansari A.Z. Asturias F.J. Berk A.J. Bjorklund S. Blackwell T.K. Borggrefe T. Carey M. Carlson M. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Emmons S.W. Fondell J.D. Freedman L.P. Fukasawa T.

Cell. 2004; 14: 553-557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The composition of Mediator varies between species, with some subunits conserved throughout the eukaryotes and others found only in particular phylogenetic lineages (22.Bourbon H.M. Comparative genomics supports a deep evolutionary origin for the large, four-module transcriptional mediator complex.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 3993-4008Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar).

A catalog of putative Arabidopsis Mediator subunits obtained using a co-immunoprecipitation/proteomics approach has recently been reported (23.Bäckström S. Elfving N. Nilsson R. Wingsle G. Björklund S. Purification of a plant mediator from Arabidopsis thaliana identifies PFT1 as the Med25 subunit.Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 717-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), but the functions of individual subunits and their roles in the regulation of general or gene-specific transcription remain largely unknown. Among the likely Arabidopsis Mediator subunits identified by Bäckström et al. (23.Bäckström S. Elfving N. Nilsson R. Wingsle G. Björklund S.

Although At3g23590/MED33a and At2g48110/MED33b were originally suggested to be plant-specific Mediator components, more recent phylogenetic evidence has suggested that both are, in fact, orthologous to yeast Med5 and mammalian MED24 (22.Bourbon H.M. Comparative genomics supports a deep evolutionary origin for the large, four-module transcriptional mediator complex.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 3993-4008Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). We independently reported an allelic series of three Arabidopsis mutants, ref4-1, ref4-2, and ref4-3, which contain semidominant mutations in At2g48110 and display a range of mutant phenotypes indicative of a global reduction in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis (30.Ruegger M.

Specifically, dominant ref4 mutants exhibit a reduced epidermal fluorescence phenotype due to a deficiency in the synthesis of sinapoylmalate, a UV-absorbent and fluorescent specialized metabolite accumulated in the epidermis of Arabidopsis leaves, as well as dwarfing, decreased lignin deposition, and a pale seed coat. We also identified the same REF4 6The abbreviations used are: REF4reduced epidermal fluorescence 4C4Hcinnamate 4-hydroxylasePALphenylalanine-ammonia lyaseRFR1REF4-related 1. paralog as Bäckström et al.

At the time of the previous report, however, we were unaware of the association of either protein with Mediator and were unable to confidently assign a function to REF4 or RFR1 due to their lack of sufficient sequence similarity to previously characterized proteins. Furthermore, due to the semidominant nature of the previously reported ref4 mutations, we were unable to formally exclude the possibility that the phenotypes they generated were neomorphic. Here, we present evidence that REF4 and RFR1 are required for phenylpropanoid homeostasis in wild-type plants, acting directly or indirectly to repress the transcription of phenylpropanoid biosynthetic genes. reduced epidermal fluorescence 4 cinnamate 4-hydroxylase phenylalanine-ammonia lyase REF4-related 1. Plants were grown in Redi-earth Plug and Seedling Mix (Sun Gro Horticulture, Bellevue, WA) supplemented with Scotts Osmocote Plus controlled release fertilizer (Hummert International, Earth City, MO) at 22 °C, with a 16-h light, 8-h dark photoperiod. All photographic images presented are unaltered with respect to brightness, color, and contrast. In some cases, portions of single images have been cropped or rearranged for neatness and clarity of presentation. The ref4-3 mutant and the suppressor screen yielding the R387H ref4-3 suppressor have been described previously (30.Ruegger M. Chapple C. Mutations that reduce sinapoylmalate accumulation in Arabidopsis thaliana define loci with diverse roles in phenylpropanoid metabolism.Genetics. 2001; 159: 1741-1749PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Stout J.

Plants containing T-DNA insertions in REF4 (SALK_037472) and RFR1 (SALK_011621) were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH). Primers CC1446 (left primer), CC1554 (right primer), and CC1662 (border primer) were used to genotype for the presence of the T-DNA insertion in REF4, and primers CC1834 (left primer), CC1776 (right primer), and CC1662 (border primer) were used to genotype for the presence of the T-DNA insertion in RFR1. ref4 rfr1 plants were obtained by crossing ref4 and rfr1 plants and screening F2 progeny for plants homozygous for both T-DNA insertions. The pap1-D mutant has been described previously (18.Borevitz J.O. Xia Y. Blount J. Dixon R.A. Lamb C. Activation tagging identifies a conserved MYB regulator of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis.Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 2383-2394Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar), and the ref4-3 pap1-D double mutant was obtained by crossing. To clone AtREF4, AtRFR1, and SmREF4, we used the Gateway cloning system (Invitrogen). The Gateway donor vector used in all cases was pCC1155, a modified version of pDONR221 in which a 927-bp BspHI fragment containing the kanamycin resistance marker of pDONR221 was replaced by the 1008-bp BspHI fragment containing the ampicillin resistance marker of pGEM-5Zf(+). The Gateway destination vector used in all cases was pCC0996, a derivative of pBI101.2 containing the Arabidopsis CINNAMATE 4-HYDROXYLASE (C4H) promoter, a Gateway cassette, and a Basta/glufosinate resistance marker. pCC0996 was constructed as follows. First, plasmid pBI101.2 was cut with EcoRI, incubated with Klenow DNA polymerase to fill in overhangs, and religated to eliminate the single EcoRI site. The single HindIII site of pBI101.2 was similarly eliminated. The GUS open reading frame was excised from the resulting vector by digesting with SalI and XbaI, and a SalI-XbaI fragment containing the polylinker from pGEM-7Zf(+) was inserted in its place to yield pCC0870. A 2.9-kb segment of genomic DNA upstream of AtC4H was PCR amplified with primers CC1791 and CC1792, which add a SalI and an EcoRI site, respectively, to the resulting amplicon. This amplicon was then digested with SalI and EcoRI and cloned into the same sites of pBluescript KS− to yield pCC0969. A 2.5-kb SacII fragment containing attR1-CmR-ccdB-attR2 (the Gateway cassette) along with an associated OCS transcriptional terminator downstream was excised from plasmid pZKY1 and cloned into the SacII site of pCC0969 to yield pCC1054. pCC1054 was then digested with SacI and KpnI to release a DNA fragment containing the entire C4H promoter-Gateway cassette-OCS terminator, which was then cloned into the same sites of pCC0870 to yield pCC1061. To replace the pBI101.2-derived kanamycin resistance marker of pCC1061 with Basta/glufosinate resistance marker (Bar), the following steps were taken. The NOS terminator of pBI101.2 was amplified with CC1871 and CC1872, which adds a XbaI site to the resulting amplicon, then digested with BamHI and XbaI and inserted into the same sites of pBluescript KS− to yield pCC0999. The NOS promoter and the glufosinate resistance marker were excised from pGPTV-Bar with EcoRI and BamHI and inserted into the same sites of pCC0999 to yield pCC1037. pCC1037 was then digested with NheI and XbaI to release the NOS promoter-Bar-NOS terminator fragment, which was then cloned into the same sites in pCC1061 to yield pCC0996, a Gateway plant expression vector conferring resistance to Basta/glufosinate in which the inserted gene is driven by the Arabidopsis C4H promoter. AtREF4, AtRFR1, and SmREF4 were amplified from cDNA using the following primers: AtREF4, CC2206 and CC2207; AtRFR1, CC2204 and CC2205; SmREF4, CC2946 and CC2947. The resulting amplicons were cloned into pCC1155 using BP clonase and subsequently cloned into pCC0996 using LR clonase according to the manufacturer's instructions. The SmREF4 point mutants described in the text were generated using the QuikChange Multi Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transgenic plants described in the text were generated using the floral dip method, as previously described (32.Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Floral dip. A simplified method for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of Arabidopsis thaliana.Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58 pGV3850 was utilized in all cases. To select for herbicide-resistant transformants, soil-grown T1 seedlings were sprayed with a 1:500 dilution of Finale Concentrate (glufosinate ammonium; Farnam Companies, Phoenix, AZ) in water approximately 7 days after germination. In some cases, a second application of herbicide several days later was utilized to eliminate seedlings that had germinated late or were poorly covered by the initial herbicide treatment. To extract and measure sinapate esters, flavonols, and hydroxycinnamyl alcohol coupling products, plant tissues (leaves, inflorescence stems, or roots as indicated in the text) were harvested, crushed, and extracted in 50% methanol (v/v) for 1 h at 65 °C at a tissue concentration of 100 mg/ml. Insoluble material was sedimented by spinning for 5 min at 16,000 × g in a microcentrifuge. 10 μl of the supernatant was then loaded onto a Shim-pack XR-ODS column (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan; column dimensions 3.0 × 75 mm, bead size 2.2 μm) and eluted at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min at an increasing concentration of acetonitrile from 10 to 35% over 8.6 min in 0.1% aqueous formic acid. Sinapic acid was used as a standard for quantification of sinapate esters. A similar protocol was used to extract and measure anthocyanins, with minor modifications. Extractions were performed in 50% methanol (v/v), 4% glacial acetic acid (v/v), and elution from the HPLC column was performed with an increasing concentration of acetonitrile from 10 to 20% over 10.6 min in 10% formic acid. To analyze plant metabolites by LC/MS, plant extracts were prepared as described above for analysis of sinapate esters, flavonols, and hydroxycinnamyl alcohol coupling products. 10 μl of extract was run on the same Shim-pack XR-ODS column as above, but with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min at an increasing concentration of acetonitrile from 10 to 25% over 14 min and from 25 to 70% over 8 min in 0.1% formic acid. Metabolites were detected and analyzed with an Agilent 1100 series LC/MSD TOF mass spectrometer in negative electrospray ionization (ESI) mode, nebulizer pressure 55 p.s.i., capillary voltage 3200 V, fragmentor voltage 125 V, drying gas flow rate 11 liter/min, temperature 350 °C. Quantitative real-time PCR experiments were performed as previously described (33.Li X. Bonawitz N.D. Weng J.K. Chapple C. The growth reduction associated with repressed lignin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana is independent of flavonoids.Plant Cell. 2010; 22: 1620-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), using the following primers: PAL1 (At2g37040), CC3280 and CC3281; PAL2 (At3g53260), CC3282 and CC3283; 4CL1 (At1g51680), CC3256 and CC3257; C4H (At2g30490), CC3258 and CC3259; and At1g13320 (reference gene), CC2558 and CC2559. Global expression analysis of phenylpropanoid biosynthetic and regulatory genes was performed using the Affymetrix ATH1 genome array according to the manufacturer's instructions, with RNA from 3-week-old soil-grown rosettes harvested ∼8 h after subjective dawn. The phylogenetic tree of plant REF4 homologs was constructed using MRBAYES version 3.1.1 (34.Huelsenbeck J.P. Ronquist F. MRBAYES. Bayesian inference of phylogenetic trees.Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 754-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (19396) Google Scholar), with amino acid alignments generated with MEGA version 4 (35.Tamura K.

Sequences were retrieved using the BLAST algorithm with the online databases TAIR (arabidopsis.org), JGI (genome.jgi-psf.org), Phytozome (phytozome.net), and GenBankTM and are listed in supplemental Table S1. In contrast to the dominant ref4-3 mutant, which exhibits a severe dwarf phenotype, light-colored seeds, and dark, spatulate leaves, we previously reported that the morphological phenotype of plants containing a T-DNA insertion in REF4 was indistinguishable from that of wild-type plants (31.Stout J. Romero-Severson E. Ruegger M.O. Chapple C. Semidominant mutations in reduced epidermal fluorescence 4 reduce phenylpropanoid content in Arabidopsis.Genetics. 2008; 178: 2237-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that the phenotype of the ref4-3 mutant is most likely not the result of inactivation of the REF4 gene. On the other hand, the existence of the paralogous RFR1 gene prevented us from ruling out the possibility that REF4 and RFR1 are redundant in wild-type plants and that the ref4-3 mutant protein acts as a dominant-negative inhibitor of RFR1. To test whether disruption of both REF4 and RFR1 phenocopies ref4-3, we generated plants containing T-DNA disruptions in both genes. Although ref4 rfr1-deficient plants under some growth conditions appear slightly less robust than wild-type plants, neither they nor plants null for rfr1 alone morphologically resemble ref4-3 mutant plants (Fig. 1). Both rfr1-deficient and ref4 rfr1-deficient plants develop normal rosette leaves (Fig. 1A), attain wild-type height at maturity (Fig. 1B), and yield seeds that are dark brown in color (Fig. 1C). On the basis of these observations, we conclude that ref4-3 does not interfere with the wild-type function of RFR1 by acting as a dominant-negative version of the protein. To test whether the lack of a phenylpropanoid phenotype in ref4-deficient plants is due to redundancy of REF4 and RFR1, we used high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to measure the concentration of soluble phenylpropanoids in tissues of rfr1 and ref4 rfr1 mutants. These analyses clearly showed that leaves of both rfr1- and ref4 rfr1-deficient plants contain higher levels of sinapate esters (hydroxycinnamate esters derived from sinapic acid including sinapoylmalate and its biosynthetic precursor sinapoylglucose) than wild-type plants, in contrast to the low sinapate ester levels seen in leaves of ref4-3 plants (Fig. 2).

Tissue engineered grafts can also be used as high fidelity models to probe cellular and molecular interactions underlying developmental processes. In this study, we co-cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) under various environmental conditions to elicit synergistic interactions leading to the colocalized development of capillary-like and bone-like tissues. Cells were encapsulated at the 1∶1 ratio in fibrin gel to screen compositions of endothelial growth medium (EGM) and osteogenic medium (OM). It was determined that, to form both tissues, co-cultures should first be supplied with EGM followed by a 1∶1 cocktail of the two media types containing bone morphogenetic protein-2. Subsequent studies of HUVECs and MSCs cultured in decellularized, trabecular bone scaffolds for 6 weeks assessed the effects on tissue construct of both temporal variations in growth-factor availability and addition of fresh cells. The resulting grafts were implanted subcutaneously into nude mice to determine the phenotype stability and functionality of engineered vessels. Two important findings resulted from these studies: (i) vascular development needs to be induced prior to osteogenesis, and (ii) the addition of additional hMSCs at the osteogenic induction stage improves both tissue outcomes, as shown by increased bone volume fraction, osteoid deposition, close proximity of bone proteins to vascular networks, and anastomosis of vascular networks with the host vasculature. Interestingly, these observations compare well with what has been described for native development. We propose that our cultivation system can mimic various aspects of endothelial cell – osteogenic precursor interactions in vivo, and could find utility as a model for studies of heterotypic cellular interactions that couple blood vessel formation with osteogenesis."

We assessed a kit under research and development called CareStart™ G6PD deficiency screening test (Access Bio, New Jersey, USA) by comparing its performance to quantitative G6PD enzyme activity using a standardized spectrophotometric method (‘gold standard’). Blood samples (n = 903) were collected from Cambodian adults living in Pailin province, western Cambodia. G6PD enzyme activities ranged from 0 to 20.5 U/g Hb (median 12.0 U/g Hg). Based on a normal haemoglobin concentration and wild-type G6PD gene, the normal values of G6PD enzymatic activity for this population was 3.6 to 20.5 U/g Hg (95th percentiles from 5.5 to 17.2 U/g Hg). Ninety-seven subjects (10.7%) had <3.6 U/g Hg and were classified as G6PD deficient. Prevalence of deficiency was 15.0% (64/425) among men and 6.9% (33/478) among women. Genotype was analyzed in 66 G6PD-deficient subjects and 63 of these exhibited findings consistent with Viangchang genotype. The sensitivity and specificity of the CareStart™ G6PD deficiency screening test was 0.68 and 1.0, respectively. Its detection threshold was <2.7 U/g Hg, well within the range of moderate and severe enzyme deficiencies. Thirteen subjects (1.4%, 12 males and 1 female) with G6PD enzyme activities <2 U/g Hg were falsely classified as “normal” by RDT. This experimental RDT test here evaluated outside of the laboratory for the first time shows real promise, but safe application of it will require lower rates of falsely “normal” results."
https://openalex.org/W1989124750,"Anthracycline daunorubicin (DNR) is one of the major antitumor agents widely used in the treatment of myeloid leukemia. Unfortunately, the clinical efficacy of DNR was limited because of its cytotoxity at high dosage. As a novel cytoprotective mechanism for tumor cell to survive under unfavorable conditions, autophagy has been proposed to play a role in drug resistance of tumor cells. Whether DNR can activate to impair the sensitivity of cancer cells remains unknown. Here, we first report that DNR can induce a high level of autophagy, which was associated with the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). Moreover, cell death induced by DNR was greatly enhanced after autophagy inhibition by the pharmacological inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) and siRNAs targeting Atg5 and Atg7, the most important components for the formation of autophagosome. In conclusion, we found that DNR can induce cytoprotective autophagy by activation of ERK in myeloid leukemia cells. Autophagy inhibition thus represents a promising approach to improve the efficacy of DNR in the treatment of patients with myeloid leukemia."
https://openalex.org/W2081134967,"Upon Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium infection of the gut, an early line of defense is the gastrointestinal epithelium which senses the pathogen and intrusion along the epithelial barrier is one of the first events towards disease. Recently, we showed that high intracellular amounts of the secondary messenger c-di-GMP in S. typhimurium inhibited invasion and abolished induction of a pro-inflammatory immune response in the colonic epithelial cell line HT-29 suggesting regulation of transition between biofilm formation and virulence by c-di-GMP in the intestine. Here we show that highly complex c-di-GMP signaling networks consisting of distinct groups of c-di-GMP synthesizing and degrading proteins modulate the virulence phenotypes invasion, IL-8 production and in vivo colonization in the streptomycin-treated mouse model implying a spatial and timely modulation of virulence properties in S. typhimurium by c-di-GMP signaling. Inhibition of the invasion and IL-8 induction phenotype by c-di-GMP (partially) requires the major biofilm activator CsgD and/or BcsA, the synthase for the extracellular matrix component cellulose. Inhibition of the invasion phenotype is associated with inhibition of secretion of the type three secretion system effector protein SipA, which requires c-di-GMP metabolizing proteins, but not their catalytic activity. Our findings show that c-di-GMP signaling is at least equally important in the regulation of Salmonella-host interaction as in the regulation of biofilm formation at ambient temperature."
https://openalex.org/W2153040627,"Mean annual temperature reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change increases at least 1.1°C to 6.4°C over the next 90 years. In context, a change in climate of 6°C is approximately the difference between the mean annual temperature of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and our current warm interglacial. Species have been responding to changing climate throughout Earth's history and their previous biological responses can inform our expectations for future climate change. Here we synthesize geological evidence in the form of stable oxygen isotopes, general circulation paleoclimate models, species' evolutionary relatedness, and species' geographic distributions. We use the stable oxygen isotope record to develop a series of temporally high-resolution paleoclimate reconstructions spanning the Middle Pleistocene to Recent, which we use to map ancestral climatic envelope reconstructions for North American rattlesnakes. A simple linear interpolation between current climate and a general circulation paleoclimate model of the LGM using stable oxygen isotope ratios provides good estimates of paleoclimate at other time periods. We use geologically informed rates of change derived from these reconstructions to predict magnitudes and rates of change in species' suitable habitat over the next century. Our approach to modeling the past suitable habitat of species is general and can be adopted by others. We use multiple lines of evidence of past climate (isotopes and climate models), phylogenetic topology (to correct the models for long-term changes in the suitable habitat of a species), and the fossil record, however sparse, to cross check the models. Our models indicate the annual rate of displacement in a clade of rattlesnakes over the next century will be 2 to 3 orders of magnitude greater (430-2,420 m/yr) than it has been on average for the past 320 ky (2.3 m/yr)."
https://openalex.org/W1975733191,"ATG16L1 is an essential component of the autophagasome. The T300A allele of ATG16L1 is associated with the increased susceptibility to Crohn disease. In this study, we identified a novel function of ATG16L1, which suppresses signaling of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β. Deletion of ATG16L1 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts significantly amplifies IL-1β signal transduction cascades. This amplification is due to elevated p62 levels in ATG16L1-deficient cells. We found that ATG16L1 regulates p62 levels via both autolysosomal and proteasomal pathways. For proteasomal degradation, we found that Cullin-3 (Cul-3) is a E3 ubiquitin ligase of p62 and that ATG16L1 is essential for neddylation of Cul-3, a step required for Cul-3 activation. Taken together our data indicate that loss-of-function of ATG16L1 results in a hyper-responsiveness to the IL-1β signaling because of the increased p62 level."
https://openalex.org/W2005119793,"The SeedGenes database (www.seedgenes.org) contains information on more than 400 genes required for embryo development in Arabidopsis. Many of these EMBRYO-DEFECTIVE (EMB) genes encode proteins with an essential function required throughout the life cycle. This raises a fundamental question. Why does elimination of an essential gene in Arabidopsis often result in embryo lethality rather than gametophyte lethality? In other words, how do mutant (emb) gametophytes survive and participate in fertilization when an essential cellular function is disrupted? Furthermore, why do some mutant embryos proceed further in development than others? To address these questions, we first established a curated dataset of genes required for gametophyte development in Arabidopsis based on information extracted from the literature. This provided a basis for comparison with EMB genes obtained from the SeedGenes dataset. We also identified genes that exhibited both embryo and gametophyte defects when disrupted by a loss-of-function mutation. We then evaluated the relationship between mutant phenotype, gene redundancy, mutant allele strength, gene expression pattern, protein function, and intracellular protein localization to determine what factors influence the phenotypes of lethal mutants in Arabidopsis. After removing cases where continued development potentially resulted from gene redundancy or residual function of a weak mutant allele, we identified numerous examples of viable mutant (emb) gametophytes that required further explanation. We propose that the presence of gene products derived from transcription in diploid (heterozygous) sporocytes often enables mutant gametophytes to survive the loss of an essential gene in Arabidopsis. Whether gene disruption results in embryo or gametophyte lethality therefore depends in part on the ability of residual, parental gene products to support gametophyte development. We also highlight here 70 preglobular embryo mutants with a zygotic pattern of inheritance, which provide valuable insights into the maternal-to-zygotic transition in Arabidopsis and the timing of paternal gene activation during embryo development."
https://openalex.org/W2026683599,"Background and Purpose Post-ischemic oxidative stress and vasomotor dysfunction in cerebral arteries may increase the likelihood of cognitive impairment and secondary stroke. However, the underlying mechanisms of post-stroke vascular abnormalities, as distinct from those causing primary brain injury, are poorly understood. We tested whether augmented superoxide-dependent dysfunction occurs in the mouse cerebral circulation following ischemia-reperfusion, and evaluated the role of Nox2 oxidase. Methods Cerebral ischemia was induced in male C57Bl6/J wild-type (WT) and Nox2-deficient (Nox2-/-) mice by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO; 0.5 h), followed by reperfusion (23.5 h). Superoxide production by MCA was measured by L-012-enhanced chemiluminescence. Nitric oxide (NO) function was assessed in cannulated and pressurized MCA via the vasoconstrictor response to Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 100 µmol/L). Expression of Nox2, the nitration marker 3-nitrotyrosine, and leukocyte marker CD45 was assessed in cerebral arteries by Western blotting. Results Following ischemia-reperfusion, superoxide production was markedly increased in the MCA of WT, but not Nox2-/- mice. In WT mice, L-NAME-induced constriction was reduced by ∼50% in ischemic MCA, whereas ischemia-reperfusion had no effect on responses to L-NAME in vessels from Nox2-/- mice. In ischemic MCA from WT mice, expression of Nox2 and 3-nitrotyrosine were ∼1.4-fold higher than in the contralateral MCA, or in ischemic or contralateral vessels from Nox2-/- mice. Vascular CD45 levels were unchanged by ischemia-reperfusion. Conclusions Excessive superoxide production, impaired NO function and nitrosative stress occur in mouse cerebral arteries after ischemia-reperfusion. These abnormalities appear to be exclusively due to increased activity of vascular Nox2 oxidase."

https://openalex.org/W2102395838,"Infertility affects one in seven couples and ascending bacterial infections of the male genitourinary tract by Escherichia coli are an important cause of male factor infertility. Thus understanding mechanisms by which immunocompetent cells such as testicular macrophages (TM) respond to infection and how bacterial pathogens manipulate defense pathways is of importance. Whole genome expression profiling of TM and peritoneal macrophages (PM) infected with uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) revealed major differences in regulated genes. However, a multitude of genes implicated in calcium signaling pathways was a common feature which indicated a role of calcium-dependent nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) signaling. UPEC-dependent NFAT activation was confirmed in both cultured TM and in TM in an in vivo UPEC infectious rat orchitis model. Elevated expression of NFATC2-regulated anti-inflammatory cytokines was found in TM (IL-4, IL-13) and PM (IL-3, IL-4, IL-13). NFATC2 is activated by rapid influx of calcium, an activity delineated to the pore forming toxin alpha-hemolysin by bacterial mutant analysis. Alpha-hemolysin suppressed IL-6 and TNF-α cytokine release from PM and caused differential activation of MAP kinase and AP-1 signaling pathways in TM and PM leading to reciprocal expression of key pro-inflammatory cytokines in PM (IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6 downregulated) and TM (IL-1β, IL-6 upregulated). In addition, unlike PM, LPS-treated TM were refractory to NFκB activation shown by the absence of degradation of IκBα and lack of pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion (IL-6, TNF-α). Taken together, these results suggest a mechanism to the conundrum by which TM initiate immune responses to bacteria, while maintaining testicular immune privilege with its ability to tolerate neo-autoantigens expressed on developing spermatogenic cells."

However, they are of limited use in leukemia therapy because of their low substrate affinity and reduced activity under physiological conditions. In an attempt to combine stability with activity at physiological conditions, 3 active-site mutants of Pyrococcus furiosus l-asparaginase (PfA) were developed. The mutants, specifically K274E, showed improved enzymatic properties at physiological conditions as compared to the wild type. All variants were thermodynamically stable and resistant to proteolytic digestion. None of the enzymes displayed glutaminase activity, a highly desirable therapeutic property. All variants showed higher and significant killing of human cell lines HL60, MCF7, and K562 as compared to the Escherichia coli l-asparaginase. Our study revealed that increased substrate accessibility through the active site loop plays a major role in determining activity. A new mechanistic insight has been proposed based on molecular dynamics simulated structures, where dynamic flipping of a critical Tyr residue is responsible for the activity of thermophilic l-asparaginases.

https://openalex.org/W1991525954,"Background The 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-7) was introduced in the United Kingdom in 2006 with a 2,3 and 13month schedule, and has led to large decreases in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) caused by the vaccine serotypes in both vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts. We estimated the effectiveness of PCV-7 against IPD. Methods and Findings We used enhanced surveillance data, collated at the Health Protection Agency, on vaccine type (n = 153) and non vaccine type (n = 919) IPD cases eligible for PCV-7. The indirect cohort method, a case-control type design which uses non vaccine type cases as controls, was used to estimate effectiveness of various numbers of doses as well as for each vaccine serotype. Possible bias with this design, caused by differential serotype replacement in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, was estimated after deriving formulae to quantify the bias. The results showed good effectiveness, increasing from 56% (95% confidence interval (CI): -7-82) for a single dose given under one year of age to 93% (95% CI: 70-98) for two doses under one year of age plus a booster dose in the second year of life. Serotype specific estimates indicated higher effectiveness against serotypes 4, 14 and 18C and lower effectiveness against 6B. Under the assumption of complete serotype replacement by non vaccine serotypes in carriage, we estimated that effectiveness estimates may be overestimated by about 2 to 5%. Conclusions This study shows high effectiveness of PCV-7 under the reduced schedule used in the UK. This finding agrees with the large reductions seen in vaccine type IPD in recent years in England and Wales. The formulae derived to assess the bias of the indirect cohort method for PCV-7 can also be used when using the design for other vaccines that affect carriage such as the recently introduced 13 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine."

Recently, a plethora of broadly neutralizing antibodies to the gp120 CD4-binding site (CD4bs) validated this region as a target for immunogen design. Here, we asked if modified HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Env) designed to increase CD4 recognition might improve recognition by CD4bs neutralizing antibodies and more efficiently elicit such reactivities. We also asked if CD4bs stabilization, coupled with altering the Env format (monomer to trimer or cross-clade), might better elicit neutralizing antibodies by focusing the immune response on the functionally conserved CD4bs. We produced monomeric and trimeric Envs stabilized by mutations within the gp120 CD4bs cavity (pocket-filling; PF2) or by appending heterologous trimerization motifs to soluble Env ectodomains (gp120/gp140). Recombinant glycoproteins were purified to relative homogeneity, and ligand binding properties were analyzed by ELISA, surface plasmon resonance, and isothermal titration microcalorimetry. In some formats, the PF2 substitutions increased CD4 affinity, and importantly, PF2-containing proteins were better recognized by the broadly neutralizing CD4bs mAbs, VRC01 and VRC-PG04. Based on this analysis, we immunized selected Env variants into rabbits using heterologous or homologous regimens. Analysis of the sera revealed that homologous inoculation of the PF2-containing, variable region-deleted YU2 gp120 trimers (ΔV123/PF2-GCN4) more rapidly elicited CD4bs-directed neutralizing antibodies compared with other regimens, whereas homologous trimers elicited increased neutralization potency, mapping predominantly to the gp120 third major variable region (V3).

To address the pathogenesis caused by HCV infection, recent studies have focused on the direct cytopathic effects of individual HCV proteins, with the objective of identifying their specific roles in the overall pathogenesis. However, this approach precludes examination of the possible interactions between different HCV proteins and organelles. To obtain a better understanding of the various cytopathic effects of and cellular responses to HCV proteins, we used human hepatoma cells constitutively replicating HCV RNA encoding either the full-length polyprotein or the non-structural proteins, or cells constitutively expressing the structural protein core, to model the state of persistent HCV infection and examined the combination of various HCV proteins in cellular pathogenesis. Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in the mitochondria, mitochondrial injury and degeneration, and increased lipid accumulation were common among all HCV protein-expressing cells regardless of whether they expressed the structural or non-structural proteins. Expression of the non-structural proteins also led to increased oxidative stress in the cytosol, membrane blebbing in the endoplasmic reticulum, and accumulation of autophagocytic vacuoles. Alterations of cellular redox state, on the other hand, significantly changed the level of autophagy, suggesting a direct link between oxidative stress and HCV-mediated activation of autophagy. With the wide-spread cytopathic effects, cells with the full-length HCV polyprotein showed a modest antioxidant response and exhibited a significant increase in population doubling time and a concomitant decrease in cyclin D1. In contrast, cells expressing the non-structural proteins were able to launch a vigorous antioxidant response with up-regulation of antioxidant enzymes. The population doubling time and cyclin D1 level were also comparable to that of control cells. Finally, the cytopathic effects of core protein appeared to focus on the mitochondria without remarkable disturbances in the cytosol."
https://openalex.org/W2093762410,"Current molecular diagnostic techniques for susceptibility testing of septicemia rely on genotyping for the presence of known resistance cassettes. This technique is intrinsically vulnerable due to the inability to detect newly emergent resistance genes. Traditional phenotypic susceptibility testing has always been a superior method to assay for resistance; however, relying on the multi-day growth period to determine which antimicrobial to administer jeopardizes patient survival. These factors have resulted in the widespread and deleterious use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials. The real-time PCR antibiogram, described herein, combines universal phenotypic susceptibility testing with the rapid diagnostic capabilities of PCR. We have developed a procedure that determines susceptibility by monitoring pathogenic load with the highly conserved 16S rRNA gene in blood samples exposed to different antimicrobial drugs. The optimized protocol removes heme and human background DNA from blood, which allows standard real-time PCR detection systems to be employed with high sensitivity (<100 CFU/mL). Three strains of E. coli, two of which were antimicrobial resistant, were spiked into whole blood and exposed to three different antibiotics. After real-time PCR-based determination of pathogenic load, a ΔC(t)<3.0 between untreated and treated samples was found to indicate antimicrobial resistance (P<0.01). Minimum inhibitory concentration was determined for susceptible bacteria and pan-bacterial detection was demonstrated with 3 gram-negative and 2 gram-positive bacteria. Species identification was performed via analysis of the hypervariable amplicons. In summary, we have developed a universal diagnostic phenotyping technique that assays for the susceptibility of drug-resistant septicemia with the speed of PCR. The real-time PCR antibiogram achieves detection, susceptibility testing, minimum inhibitory concentration determination, and identification in less than 24 hours."
https://openalex.org/W2017335499,"Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) is one of the most important factors controlling angiogenesis. Although the functions of exogenous VEGF-A have been widely studied, the roles of endogenous VEGF-A remain unclear. Here we focused on the mechanistic functions of endogenous VEGF-A in endothelial cells. We found that it is complexed with VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) and maintains a basal expression level for VEGFR-2 and its downstream signaling activation. Endogenous VEGF-A also controls expression of key endothelial specific genes including VEGFR-2, Tie-2, and vascular endothelial cadherin. Of importance, endogenous VEGF-A differs from exogenous VEGF-A by regulating VEGFR-2 transcription through mediation of FoxC2 binding to the FOX:ETS motif, and the complex formed by endogenous VEGF-A with VEGFR-2 is localized within the EEA1 (early endosome antigen 1) endosomal compartment. Taken together, our results emphasize the importance of endogenous VEGF-A in endothelial cells by regulating key vascular proteins and maintaining the endothelial homeostasis."

https://openalex.org/W2060214532,"The p38 MAPK signaling pathway has been proposed as a critical mediator of the therapeutic effect of several antitumor agents, including cisplatin. Here, we found that sensitivity to cisplatin, in a system of 7 non-small cell lung carcinoma derived cell lines, correlated with high levels of MKK6 and marked activation of p38 MAPK. However, knockdown of MKK6 modified neither the response to cisplatin nor the activation of p38 MAPK. Deeper studies showed that resistant cell lines also displayed higher basal levels of MKK3. Interestingly, MKK3 knockdown significantly decreased p38 phosphorylation upon cisplatin exposure and consequently reduced the response to the drug. Indeed, cisplatin poorly activated MKK3 in resistant cells, while in sensitive cell lines MKK3 showed the opposite pattern in response to the drug. Our data also demonstrate that the low levels of MKK6 expressed in resistant cell lines are the consequence of high basal activity of p38 MAPK mediated by the elevated levels of MKK3. This finding supports the existence of a regulatory mechanism between both MAPK kinases through their MAPK. Furthermore, our results were also mirrored in head and neck carcinoma derived cell lines, suggesting our observations boast a potential universal characteristic in cancer resistance of cisplatin. Altogether, our work provides evidence that MKK3 is the major determinant of p38 MAPK activation in response to cisplatin and, hence, the resistance associated with this MAPK. Therefore, these data suggest that the balance between both MKK3 and MKK6 could be a novel mechanism which explains the cellular response to cisplatin."
https://openalex.org/W1972356153,"Severe acute respiratory coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in 2002, resulting in roughly 8000 cases worldwide and 10% mortality. The animal reservoirs for SARS-CoV precursors still exist and the likelihood of future outbreaks in the human population is high. The SARS-CoV papain-like protease (PLP) is an attractive target for pharmaceutical development because it is essential for virus replication and is conserved among human coronaviruses. A yeast-based assay was established for PLP activity that relies on the ability of PLP to induce a pronounced slow-growth phenotype when expressed in S. cerevisiae. Induction of the slow-growth phenotype was shown to take place over a 60-hour time course, providing the basis for conducting a screen for small molecules that restore growth by inhibiting the function of PLP. Five chemical suppressors of the slow-growth phenotype were identified from the 2000 member NIH Diversity Set library. One of these, NSC158362, potently inhibited SARS-CoV replication in cell culture without toxic effects on cells, and it specifically inhibited SARS-CoV replication but not influenza virus replication. The effect of NSC158362 on PLP protease, deubiquitinase and anti-interferon activities was investigated but the compound did not alter these activities. Another suppressor, NSC158011, demonstrated the ability to inhibit PLP protease activity in a cell-based assay. The identification of these inhibitors demonstrated a strong functional connection between the PLP-based yeast assay, the inhibitory compounds, and SARS-CoV biology. Furthermore the data with NSC158362 suggest a novel mechanism for inhibition of SARS-CoV replication that may involve an unknown activity of PLP, or alternatively a direct effect on a cellular target that modifies or bypasses PLP function in yeast and mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2004205049,"A precise inference of past demographic histories including dating of demographic events using Bayesian methods can only be achieved with the use of appropriate molecular rates and evolutionary models. Using a set of 596 mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) sequences of two sister species of European green crabs of the genus Carcinus (C. maenas and C. aestuarii), our study shows how chronologies of past evolutionary events change significantly with the application of revised molecular rates that incorporate biogeographic events for calibration and appropriate demographic priors. A clear signal of demographic expansion was found for both species, dated between 10,000 and 20,000 years ago, which places the expansions events in a time frame following the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). In the case of C. aestuarii, a population expansion was only inferred for the Adriatic-Ionian, suggestive of a colonization event following the flooding of the Adriatic Sea (18,000 years ago). For C. maenas, the demographic expansion inferred for the continental populations of West and North Europe might result from a northward recolonization from a southern refugium when the ice sheet retreated after the LGM. Collectively, our results highlight the importance of using adequate calibrations and demographic priors in order to avoid considerable overestimates of evolutionary time scales."
https://openalex.org/W1998463172,"Systematic reviews with meta-analyses often contain many statistical tests. This multiplicity may increase the risk of type I error. Few attempts have been made to address the problem of statistical multiplicity in systematic reviews. Before the implications are properly considered, the size of the issue deserves clarification. Because of the emphasis on bias evaluation and because of the editorial processes involved, Cochrane reviews may contain more multiplicity than their non-Cochrane counterparts. This study measured the quantity of statistical multiplicity present in a population of systematic reviews and aimed to assess whether this quantity is different in Cochrane and non-Cochrane reviews.We selected all the systematic reviews published by the Cochrane Anaesthesia Review Group containing a meta-analysis and matched them with comparable non-Cochrane reviews. We counted the number of statistical tests done in each systematic review. The median number of tests overall was 10 (interquartile range (IQR) 6 to 18). The median was 12 in Cochrane and 8 in non-Cochrane reviews (difference in medians 4 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.0-19.0). The proportion that used an assessment of risk of bias as a reason for doing extra analyses was 42% in Cochrane and 28% in non-Cochrane reviews (difference in proportions 14% (95% CI -8 to 36). The issue of multiplicity was addressed in 6% of all the reviews.Statistical multiplicity in systematic reviews requires attention. We found more multiplicity in Cochrane reviews than in non-Cochrane reviews. Many of the reasons for the increase in multiplicity may well represent improved methodological approaches and greater transparency, but multiplicity may also cause an increased risk of spurious conclusions. Few systematic reviews, whether Cochrane or non-Cochrane, address the issue of multiplicity."
https://openalex.org/W2018117880,"Exposure to ultraviolet rays (UV) in sunlight is the main cause of skin cancer. Here, we show that the p53-induced genes DDB2 and p21 are down-regulated in skin cancer, and in the mouse model they functionally cooperate to prevent UV-induced skin cancer. Our previous studies demonstrated an antagonistic role of DDB2 and p21 in nucleotide excision repair and apoptosis. Surprisingly, we find that the loss of p21 restores nucleotide excision repair and apoptosis in Ddb2(-/-) mice, but it does not protect from UV-mediated skin carcinogenesis. In contrast, Ddb2(-/-)p21(-/-) mice are significantly more susceptible to UV-induced skin cancer than the Ddb2(-/-) or the p21(-/-) mice. We provide evidence that p21 deletion in the Ddb2(-/-) background causes a strong increase in cell proliferation. The increased proliferation in the Ddb2(-/-)p21(-/-) background is related to a severe deficiency in UV-induced premature senescence. Also, the oncogenic pro-proliferation transcription factor FOXM1 is overexpressed in the p21(-/-) background. Our results show that the anti-proliferative and the pro-senescence pathways of DDB2 and p21 are critical protection mechanisms against skin malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2021910782,"Ecological specialization and resource partitioning are expected to be particularly high in the species-rich communities of tropical vertebrates, yet many species have broader ecological niches than expected. In Neotropical ecosystems, Neotropical leaf-nosed bats (Phyllostomidae) are one of the most ecologically and functionally diverse vertebrate clades. Resource partitioning in phyllostomids might be achieved through differences in the ability to find and process food. We selected Micronycteris microtis, a very small (5-7 g) animalivorous phyllostomid, to explore whether broad resource use is associated with specific morphological, behavioral and performance traits within the phyllostomid radiation. We documented processing of natural prey and measured bite force in free-ranging M. microtis and other sympatric phyllostomids. We found that M. microtis had a remarkably broad diet for prey size and hardness. For the first time, we also report the consumption of vertebrates (lizards), which makes M. microtis the smallest carnivorous bat reported to date. Compared to other phyllostomids, M. microtis had the highest bite force for its size and cranial shape and high performance plasticity. Bite force and cranial shape appear to have evolved rapidly in the M. microtis lineage. High performance capacity and high efficiency in finding motionless prey might be key traits that allow M. microtis, and perhaps other species, to successfully co-exist with other gleaning bats."
https://openalex.org/W2066849542,"MicroRNAs are small molecules which regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally and aberrant expression of several miRNAs is associated with neuroblastoma, a childhood cancer arising from precursor cells of the sympathetic nervous system. Amplification of the MYCN transcription factor characterizes the most clinically aggressive subtype of this disease, and although alteration of p53 signaling is not commonly found in primary tumors, deregulation of proteins involved in this pathway frequently arise in recurrent disease after pharmacological treatment. TH-MYCN is a well-characterized transgenic model of MYCN-driven neuroblastoma which recapitulates many clinicopathologic features of the human disease. Here, we evaluate the dysregulation of miRNAs in tumors from TH-MYCN mice that are either wild-type (TH-MYCN) or deficient (TH-MYCN/p53ER(TAM)) for the p53 tumor suppressor gene.We analyzed the expression of 591 miRNAs in control (adrenal) and neuroblastoma tumor tissues derived from either TH-MYCN or TH-MYCN/p53ER(TAM) mice, respectively wild-type or deficient in p53. Comparing miRNA expression in tumor and control samples, we identified 159 differentially expressed miRNAs. Using data previously obtained from human neuroblastoma samples, we performed a comparison of miRNA expression between murine and human tumors to assess the concordance between murine and human expression data. Notably, the miR-17-5p-92 oncogenic polycistronic cluster, which is over-expressed in human MYCN amplified tumors, was over-expressed in mouse tumors. Moreover, analyzing miRNAs expression in a mouse model (TH-MYCN/p53ER(TAM)) possessing a transgenic p53 allele that drives the expression of an inactive protein, we identified miR-125b-3p and miR-676 as directly or indirectly regulated by the level of functional p53.Our study represents the first miRNA profiling of an important mouse model of neuroblastoma. Similarities and differences in miRNAs expression between human and murine neuroblastoma were identified, providing important insight into the efficacy of this mouse model for assessing miRNA involvement in neuroblastoma and their potential effectiveness as therapeutic targets."

We monitored the effect of 1,763 MHz RF radiation on cultured human dermal papilla cells (hDPCs) by evaluating changes in the expression of cytokines related to hair growth. The expression of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) mRNA in hDPCs was significantly induced upon RF radiation at the specific absorption rate of 10 W/kg, which resulted in increased expression of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) and cyclin D1 (CCND1) proteins and increased phosphorylation of MAPK1 protein. Exposure to 10 W/kg RF radiation 1 h per day for 7 days significantly enhanced hair shaft elongation in ex vivo hair organ cultures. In RF-exposed follicular matrix keratinocytes in the hair bulb, the expression of Ki-67 was increased, while the signal for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling was reduced. From these results, we suggest that 1,763 MHz RF exposure stimulates hair growth in vitro through the induction of IGF-1 in hDPCs."

PDTT of primary colon carcinoma, lymphatic and hepatic metastases were used to create xenograft models. Hematoxylin and eosin staining, immunohistochemical staining, genome-wide gene expression analysis, pyrosequencing, qRT-PCR, and western blotting were used to determine the biological stability of the xenografts during serial transplantation compared with the original tumor tissues. Early passages of the PDTT xenograft models of primary colon carcinoma, lymphatic and hepatic metastases revealed a high degree of similarity with the original clinical tumor samples with regard to histology, immunohistochemistry, genes expression, and mutation status as well as mRNA expression. After we have ascertained that these xenografts models retained similar histopathological features and molecular signatures as the original tumors, drug sensitivities of the xenografts to a novel VEGF targeted agent, FP3 was evaluated. In this study, PDTT xenograft models of colon carcinoma with lymphatic and hepatic metastasis have been successfully established.

ASK1 has multifunctional domains that are composed of an inhibitory N-terminal domain, an internal kinase domain, and a C-terminal regulatory domain (13Nishitoh H. Saitoh M. Mochida Y. Takeda K.

The C-terminal domain of ASK1 binds to TRAF proteins such as TRAF2 and TRAF6, which are required for activation of ASK1 by TNF.

Nevertheless, the cellular and molecular mechanisms for ASK1 activation are not fully understood. Recently, the biological significance of heteromeric complex formation between different MAP3Ks has received a great deal of attention and is supposed to have synergistic advantages or distinct regulatory effects for cells to cope up with various stimuli by fine regulation of cellular responses. Although the inhibitory role of ASK1 in interleukin-1-induced NF-κB activity through disruption of TRAF6-TAK1 interaction has previously been addressed (18Mochida Y. Takeda K. Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Amagasa T. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Ichijo H. ASK1 inhibits interleukin-1-induced NF-κ B activity through disruption of TRAF6-TAK1 interaction.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32747-32752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), at least two different issues are still unresolved; (i) whether TAK1 is able to regulate the ASK1-mediated signaling pathway for AP-1 activation and (ii) whether TAK1-binding proteins such as TAB1, TAB2, and TAB3 are also involved in the ASK1-TAK1 reciprocal regulatory mechanism. In the present study we have addressed these two issues. We have shown that TAK1 inhibits ASK1-induced AP-1 activity through the interaction between the C-terminal domain of TAK1 and the N-terminal or C-terminal domain of ASK1. Using biochemical and reporter assays, we also identified that the TAB2 protein, which is capable of binding to C-terminal TAK1, is critically involved in the activation of ASK1-induced AP-1 through disruption of ASK1-TAK1 interaction. Furthermore, we found that TAK1 inhibits ASK1-mediated apoptosis by TNF-α and H2O2. Collectively, our results provide biochemical and functional evidence that TAK1 and its adapter protein, TAB2, can reciprocally regulate both TAK1- and ASK1-mediated signal pathways.

Recombinant human IL-1β and TNF-α were purchased from Roche Applied Science. LPS was purchased from Sigma. HEK 293 cells were plated in 12-well culture plates. On the following day, the cells were transiently transfected with the indicated expression vectors using Lipofectamine LRX (Invitrogen). The total amount of DNA was kept constant by supplementation with empty vector, pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Every transfection step included 100 ng of reporter plasmids together with 10 ng of Renilla for normalization of transfection efficiency.

The lysates were divided and analyzed for firefly luciferase and Renilla activities using a luminometer. All the luciferase experiments were performed in triplicate. To confirm an appropriate expression of transfected expression plasmids, the aliquots of whole cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-HA and anti-GAPDH (Roche Applied Science) antibodies.

TAK1−/− MEF transfectant cells were additionally treated or untreated for 24 h with 100 ng/ml TNF-α, harvested, and washed twice with PBS.

Samples were analyzed with FACSCalibur system and determined with CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). TAK1−/− MEF transfectant cells were additionally treated or untreated for 24 h with 500 μm H2O2, harvested, and washed twice with PBS.

After 38 h the cells were divided and treated with or without 5 ng/ml TNF-α or 10 ng/ml LPS for 9 h. Levels of human TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 cytokines were measured in the supernatants according to the manufacturer's protocol (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Statistical significance was analyzed using Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). A one-way analysis of variance test was performed, and the post test was used if overall p < 0.05. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. To explore the functional roles of ASK1 in AP-1 and NF-κB activation through proinflammatory stimuli, we performed a luciferase assay by using AP-1- and NF-κB-dependent reporter genes, respectively. Overexpression of ASK1 significantly activated AP-1 activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A, columns 1–4). Moreover, TNF-α or LPS-induced AP-1 activities were markedly enhanced by the overexpression of ASK1 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A, columns 6–8, TNF-α and columns 10–12, LPS). Overexpression of ASK1 clearly reduced the basal activity of NF-κB (Fig. 1B, columns 2–4) as compared with that of control (Fig. 1B, column 1). Interestingly, TNF-α- or LPS-induced NF-κB activities were also significantly reduced by the overexpression of ASK1 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B, columns 6–8, TNF-α and columns 10–12, LPS). To rule out a possibility that overexpression of ASK1 affects the endogenous expression of TAK1, TAK1 expression was assessed. No significant changes in endogenous TAK1 expression could be detected (Fig. 1, A and B, IB:TAK1), indicating that the observed negative effect of ASK1 is not associated with the reduced expression of TAK1. To confirm luciferase assays, we further analyzed DNA binding activities of p65 and p50 for NF-κB and of c-Fos and c-Jun for AP-1, respectively, using a DNA binding ELISA-based method (21Kim S.W. Oleksyn D.W. Rossi R.M. Jordan C.T. Sanz I. Chen L. Zhao J.

TNFAIP3/A20 functions as a novel tumor suppressor gene in several subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphomas.Blood. 2009; 114: 2467-2475Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). According to the stimulation of LPS or TNF-α, there was a marked increase in p65 and p50 DNA binding activities (Fig. 1, C, Mock+LPS and D, Mock+TNF-α), whereas a significant decrease was observed in ASK1-overexpressed cells (Fig. 1, C, ASK1+LPS, and D, ASK1+TNF-α). However, there was an increase in DNA binding activities of c-Fos and phosphorylated c-Jun with LPS and TNF-α stimulations (Fig. 1, E, Mock+LPS, and F, Mock+TNF-α), and a significant enhancement was observed in ASK1-overexpressed cells (Fig. 1, E, ASK1+LPS and F, ASK1+TNF-α). The results were consistent with those of AP-1- and NF-κB-dependent luciferase assays, shown in Fig. 1. These results suggest that ASK1 overexpression and LPS/TNF-α have additive effects on the activation of AP-1 but an inhibitory effect on the activation of NF-κB in response to proinflammatory stimulations. A previous report has shown that ASK1 inhibits interleukin-1-induced NF-κB activity through disruption of TRAF6-TAK1 interaction (18Mochida Y. Takeda K. Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Amagasa T. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Ichijo H. ASK1 inhibits interleukin-1-induced NF-κ B activity through disruption of TRAF6-TAK1 interaction.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32747-32752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We further assessed whether TAK1 is able to regulate ASK1-induced AP-1 activity. In contrast to the activity of ASK1, the overexpression of TAK1 alone had no effect on the basal luciferase activity of AP-1 (Fig. 2A, Myc-TAK1 alone) and on DNA binding activities of c-Fos and phosphorylated c-Jun (Fig. 2B, Myc-TAK1 alone). Interestingly, ASK1-induced AP-1 activation was significantly reduced by the overexpression of TAK1 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). Consistently, c-Fos and phosphorylated c-Jun DNA binding activities were also inhibited by the overexpression of TAK1 (Fig. 2B) compared with that of ASK1 alone (Fig. 2B, HA-ASK1 alone), indicating that TAK1 may be negatively involved in ASK1-induced AP-1 activation. We further tested whether the inducible AP-1 activities by TNF-α, IL-1β, and LPS are also inhibited by the overexpression of TAK1. TNF-α, IL-1β, and LPS stimulations resulted in increases in both AP-1-dependent luciferase and c-Fos and phosphorylated c-Jun DNA binding activities (Fig. 2, C and D, columns 2–4), and these activities were significantly enhanced in the presence of ASK1 overexpression (Fig. 2, C and D, column 7, 9, and 11). However, the overexpression of TAK1 markedly inhibited these inducible AP-1-dependent luciferase and c-Fos and phosphorylated c-Jun DNA binding activities (Fig. 2, C and D, column 8, 10, and 12). These results strongly suggest that TAK1 may be negatively involved in ASK1-induced AP-1 activation, although the molecular mechanism still remains to be addressed. Subsequently, the molecular mechanism by which ASK1 activity is regulated by TAK1 was explored. TAK1 strongly interacted with ASK1 in the co-overexpression experiment (Fig. 3A, lane 3) and also endogenously co-immunoprecipitated with ASK1 in the unstimulated condition (Fig. 3, B and C, lanes 1 and 3). Additionally, TAK1-binding protein TAB1 was also co-precipitated with the TAK1-ASK1 complex (Fig. 3B, IB: anti-TAB1, lanes 1 and 3). To verify the TAK1-TAB1-ASK1 ternary complex, we performed co-overexpression experiment. As shown in Fig. 3D, TAK1 was significantly co-immunoprecipitated with ASK1 and TAB1, indicating that in resting conditions ASK1 may exist in a complex form as ASK1-TAK1-TAB1. Because these two MAP3Ks are inactive in the resting condition, we hypothesized that ASK1-TAK1 interaction may be dissociated to be involved in each MAP3K-induced signal pathways by exogenous stimuli. Upon stimulations with TNF-α and LPS, phosphorylations of TAK1 (Thr-187) and ASK1 (Thr-845) were significantly induced, and other downstream signals, p38 and JNK, were also activated (Fig. 3E). As expected, the interaction between ASK1 and TAK1 was significantly decreased by both TNF-α and LPS stimulations as compared with the case of unstimulated cells (Fig. 3, B and C, lanes 2 and 4). However, no significant changes could be detected in the interaction between TAK1 and TAB1 (Fig. 3B, IB: anti-TAB1, lanes 2 and 4) as compa"

Due to the probable long lasting treatment with tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs), the knowledge of their effects on normal cells is of pivotal importance. Design and Methods We investigated the effects of dasatinib treatment on human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). Results Our findings demonstrate, for the first time, that dasatinib induces MSCs adipocytic differentiation. Particularly, when the TKI is added to the medium inducing osteogenic differentiation, a high MSCs percentage acquires adipocytic morphology and overexpresses adipocytic specific genes, including PPARγ, CEBPα, LPL and SREBP1c. Dasatinib also inhibits the activity of alkaline phosphatase, an osteogenic marker, and remarkably reduces matrix mineralization. The increase of PPARγ is also confirmed at protein level. The component of osteogenic medium required for dasatinib-induced adipogenesis is dexamethasone. Intriguingly, the increase of adipocytic markers is also observed in MSCs treated with dasatinib alone. The TKI effect is phenotype-specific, since fibroblasts do not undergo adipocytic differentiation or PPARγ increase. Conclusions Our data demonstrate that dasatinib treatment affects bone marrow MSCs commitment and suggest that TKIs therapy might modify normal phenotypes with potential significant negative consequences."

Despite its crucial function in development, co-factors that modulate the activity of Mixl1 remain poorly defined. Here we report that Mixl1 interacts physically and functionally with the T-box protein Brachyury and related members of the T-box family of transcription factors. Transcriptional and protein analyses demonstrated overlapping expression of Mixl1 and Brachyury during embryonic stem cell differentiation. In vitro protein interaction studies showed that the Mixl1 with Brachyury associated via their DNA-binding domains and gel shift assays revealed that the Brachyury T-box domain bound to Mixl1-DNA complexes. Furthermore, luciferase reporter experiments indicated that association of Mixl1 with Brachyury and related T-box factors inhibited the transactivating potential of Mixl1 on the Gsc and Pdgfrα promoters. Our results indicate that the activity of Mixl1 can be modulated by protein-protein interactions and that T-box factors can function as negative regulators of Mixl1 activity."
https://openalex.org/W2075545369,"Myelodysplastic syndromes/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPNs) are a group of myeloid neoplasms in which abnormal activation of the Ras signaling pathway is commonly observed. The PI3K/Akt pathway is a known target of Ras; however, activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway has been shown to lead to neoplastic transformation of not only myeloid but also lymphoid cells, suggesting that pathways other than the PI3K/Akt pathway should play a central role in pathogenesis of Ras-mediated MDS/MPN. The MEK/ERK pathway is another downstream target of Ras, which is involved in regulation of cell survival and proliferation. However, the role of the MEK/ERK pathway in the pathogenesis of MDS/MPN remains unclear. Here, we show that introduction of a constitutively activated form of MEK into hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) causes hematopoietic neoplasms that are limited to MDS/MPNs, despite the multipotent differentiation potential of HSCs. Active MEK-mediated MDS/MPNs are lethal, but are not considered a frank leukemia because it cannot be transplanted into naïve animals. However, transplantation of MDS/MPNs co-expressing active MEK and an anti-apoptotic molecule, Bcl-2, results in T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL), suggesting that longevity of cells may impact transplantability and alter disease phenotype. Our results clearly demonstrate the proto-oncogenic property of the MEK/ERK pathway in hematopoietic cells, which manifest in MDS/MPN development."

Endophilins, diverging into A and B subgroups, are BAR and SH3 domain-containing proteins. They exert activities in membrane dynamic processes such as endocytosis, autophagy, mitochondrial dynamics, and permeabilization during apoptosis.

These three types of domains organize around the interface between two monomers mainly formed by consecutive α-helices that assemble into anti-parallel crescent-shaped dimers whose concave and positively charged face interacts with negatively charged lipid headgroups localized on the cytosolic side of the membrane bilayer. BAR, F-BAR, and I-BAR domains are characterized by more or less curved structures. They can bind to membranes of different curvature degrees with the BAR fitting to the more convex ones (although with relative flexibility, see Ref. 6Wang Q. Kaan H.Y. Hooda R.N. Goh S.L.

In this latter case, for example, the I-BAR is involved in the formation of filopodium-like protrusions (7Mattila P.K. Pykäläinen A. Saarikangas J. Paavilainen V.O. Vihinen H. Jokitalo E.

All of these domains have been proposed to induce membrane curvature, stabilize curvature driven by other mechanical forces, or sense curvature as a signal for selective recruitment on a given target membrane as well as for the shape-driven attachment to other factors that may act as downstream effectors. Finally, their activity on membranes was also proposed to rely on oligomerization properties that propagate positive curvature to shape tubular structures, as exemplified by self-assembly of F-BAR modules into a helical coat (4Frost A. Perera R. Roux A. Spasov K. Destaing O. Egelman E.H. De Camilli P. Unger V.M.

Among the BAR domain superfamily, the classical BAR sometimes harbors at its N terminus a sequence of ∼25 residues that was shown to fold into an amphipathic α-helix upon insertion into the cytosolic leaflet of the membrane bilayer (thus defined as the N-BAR). This is the case of proteins such as amphiphysins, endophilins, and nadrins (1Frost A. Unger V.M. De Camilli P. The BAR domain superfamily. Membrane-molding macromolecules.Cell. 2009; 137: 191-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). This helix was proposed to cause membrane bending by pushing apart polar headgroups of lipids from the cytosolic leaflet (8Farsad K. Ringstad N. Takei K. Floyd S.R. Rose K. De Camilli P.

Importantly, endophilins differ from many other BAR domain-containing proteins because their BAR module is not directly flanked by a lipid-binding domain mediating selective membrane recruitment driven by lipid-signaling activity.

Swain E. Chen Y. Turner B.T. Zhang J.F. Structure of the SH3 domain of rat endophilin A2.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2008; 64: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), this is not the case for full-length proteins. Thus, structural and functional relationships between SH3 and BAR domains of endophilin have been poorly investigated. However, modeling using small angle x-ray scattering led to the proposal of a structural relationship involving physical contact between these domains (6Wang Q. Kaan H.Y. Hooda R.N. Goh S.L. Sondermann H. Structure and plasticity of endophilin and sorting nexin 9.Structure. 2008; 16: 1574-1587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In particular, it was proposed that when the BAR monomers are assembled into a dimer to constitute the so-called BAR domain, the C-terminal SH3 domain folds back toward the distal tip of the adjacent protomer. This interaction, involving a series of positively charged residues located between the second and the third helices of the BAR monomer, could serve the purpose of regulating the interaction with target membranes, as was proposed for the F-BAR-containing protein syndapin (39Rao Y. Ma Q. Vahedi-Faridi A. Sundborger A. Pechstein A. Puchkov D. Luo L. Shupliakov O. Saenger W. Haucke V. Molecular basis for SH3 domain regulation of F-BAR-mediated membrane deformation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 8213-8218Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Here, using the combination of N-terminal truncations and single point mutagenesis in proteins of the endophilin A subfamily, we bring converging biochemical evidence for a functional relationship between BAR sequence dimerization and SH3 domain-mediated partnership. We identify leucine 215 as playing a central role in stabilizing hydrophobic interactions between BAR protomers and characterize the impaired activities of the BAR domain of endophilin A2 bearing the L215D substitution in membrane deformation, partnership of the SH3 domain, and endocytic recycling of the transferrin receptor. cDNAs encoding for mouse EA1 and the deletion mutants EA1Δ(1–97), EA1Δ(1–175), EA1Δ(1–200), and EA1varSH3 were amplified using sense and antisense primers designed to contain BamHI restriction sites for cloning into the bacterial pET9a expression vector (Novagen). EA1(1/2var)SH3 and EA1SH3 were cloned into pET9a using primers introducing a sequence encoding for a StrepTag in the N terminus and containing NdeI/BamHI restriction sites. The sequences of primers bearing StrepTag insertions were as follows: EA1(1/2var)SH3 sense (5′–3′), GGGAATTCCATATGGCTAGCTGGAGCCACCCGCAGTTCGAAAAAATCGAAGGGCGCAGTACTCAGCCCAACGGGGGTCTC; EA1SH3 sense (5′–3′), GGGAATTCCATATGGCTAGCTGGAGCCACCCGCAGTTCGAAAAAATCGAAGGGCGCGGTGTCCAAATGGATCAGCCCTGC; and EA1(1/2var)SH3 and EA1SH3 antisense (5′–3′), CGGGATCCCTAATGGGGCAGAGCAACCAGAATTTC. The single point substitutions L215D in the sequences encoding for EA1 and EA2 were obtained by two-step PCRs using the following primers containing silent mutations for screening: EA1LD sense (5′–3′), CTCCTCGAGATGGATATAGAACAGGTGAGCCAGGACTCCGCAC; EA1LD antisense (5′–3′), GGAGTCCTGGCTCACCTGTTCTATATCCATCTCGAGGAGGTTG; EA2LD sense (5′–3′), CTCCTCGAGACTGATATAGAGCAGGTGAGCCAGGACTCGGCCCTGGTGG; and EA2LD antisense (5′–3′), GGCCGAGTCCTGGCTCACCTGCTCTATATCAGTCTCGAGGAGGTTGTGC. The substitutions of amino acid residues 171KKKR174 by 171AAAA174 in full-length EA1 was performed by two-step PCRs using the following primers containing silent mutations to generate a NotI restriction site for screening: EA1KA sense (5′–3′), GGTTATGCGGCCGCAGCACAAGGCAAGATTCCAGATGAAGAACTC, and EA1KA antisense (5′–3′), GCCTTGTGCTGCGGCCGCATAACCAAAGTCTAAGCGTCG-GCC. Sequences encoding for full-length EA1, EA1KR and EA1LD, EA1ΔSH3, EA1Δ(1–175), EA1LDΔ(1–175), EA1Δ(1–175)ΔSH3, EA1Δ(1–200)ΔSH3, full-length EA2 and EA2LD, EA2Δ(1–175), EA2LDΔ(1–175), and EA2Δ(1–175)ΔSH3 were cloned into the pASK3 or pASK7 bacterial expression vectors (IBA, GmbH, Germany), using EcoRI/BamHI restriction sites. Sequences encoding for EA2 and EA2LD were cloned into the eukaryotic pcDNA3.1/myc-His and pcDNA4/TO/myc-His (Invitrogen) and pEXPR-3 and pEXPR-5 (IBA, GmbH, Germany) expression vectors using primers containing BamHI/EcoRI and SacII/BamHI restriction sites, respectively. Sequences encoding for EA2ΔSH3 and EA2LDΔSH3 were also cloned into pEXPR-3 using the same restrictions sites as for full-length sequences. EA2-mycHis6 was constructed using amplification with sense and antisense primers containing NheI and NotI restriction sites followed by cloning in a modified pET28b expression vector (Novagen), in which sequence NcoI-XhoI was replaced with a NcoI-NheI-NotI-myc-XhoI sequence. This allowed in-frame fusion of EA2 C terminus to the myc tag sequence and the original His6 tag, giving pET2-EA2mh plasmid. Sequence encoding for the ADAM15 cytosolic tail (ADAM15-CT) was cloned into the pGEX-6p-1 vector using primers containing BamHI/XhoI restriction sites. The DNA sequences amplified to obtain the pleckstrin homology and the proline-rich domains of human dynamin 1 (Swiss-Prot accession number Q05193), using primers containing BamHI/XhoI restriction sites for cloning into pASK-3 and BamHI/EcoRI for cloning into PGEX-6p-1, encode for amino acid residues 506–641 and 743–864, respectively. Recombinant proteins were produced using BL21pLysS bacteria (Invitrogen). Full-length EA1 and BAR-truncated forms were purified by poly-l-proline chromatography, from 280,000 × g high speed supernatants obtained from lysed cells as described previously (40Schmidt A. Wolde M. Thiele C. Fest W. Kratzin H. Podtelejnikov A.V. Witke W. Huttner W.B. Söling H.D. Endophilin I mediates synaptic vesicle formation by transfer of arachidonate to lysophosphatidic acid.Nature. 1999; 401: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Truncated forms devoid of any BAR sequence fused to a StrepTag and ADAM15-CT fused to GST were purified from high speed supernatants either via StrepTactin/Sepharose or glutathione/Sepharose chromatography according to the manufacturer's instructions (IBA, GmbH, Germany and Amersham Biosciences, respectively). We failed to purify EA1LD and EA2LD mutants because of the total insolubility of both proteins upon expression in BL21pLysS cells. Therefore, we have chosen to express EA2LD as a heterodimer with a wild type version of EA2 bearing a myc-His6 sequence fused at its C terminus. A soluble heterodimer could be expressed in BL21pLys cells transformed with both pASK-3-EA2LD and pET2-EA2mh plasmids and purified by StrepTactin column chromatography as described above. The immunoblot detection of the myc tag in the purified protein confirmed the association of the two polypeptides as a heterodimer. Rat brain cytosol (∼80 μg of total protein per strip, Fig. 5 and supplemental Fig. 4) or ADAM15 fused to GST (0.5 μg, Figs. 1B and 5, bottom panels) were migrated on SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide gels). After transfer onto nitrocellulose, membrane strips were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with blocking buffer (TBST-BSA: 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, 1% (w/v) delipidated BSA, 0,1% (w/v) Tween 20, pH 7.4) and then for 2 h with the indicated proteins in TBST-BSA. These were used under the following conditions: 0.2 μg/ml per strip in Fig. 5 (top panels, brain cytosol); 0.5 μg/ml per strip in Fig. 5 (bottom panel, ADAM15CT); the indicated amounts in supplemental Fig. 4; dilutions of aliquots of 280,000 × g high speed supernatants (Fig. 1B) in TBST-BSA containing the equivalent of 3 μg/ml recombinant protein fused to the StrepTag as measured by quantitative analysis of StrepTactin-HRP activity using St-EA1Δ(1–175) purified on StrepTactin/Sepharose and blotted on nitrocellulose as reference. After washing in TBST, the strips were incubated with StrepTactin-HRP in blocking buffer for 30 min at room temperature. After washing, membranes were treated as described under “Immunoblotting.”FIGURE 1Differential binding of EA1 and truncated forms to proline-rich peptides.

https://openalex.org/W1969469578,"5′-Deoxyadenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl)-dependent isomerases catalyze carbon skeleton rearrangements using radical chemistry. We have recently characterized a fusion protein that comprises the two subunits of the AdoCbl-dependent isobutyryl-CoA mutase flanking a G-protein chaperone and named it isobutyryl-CoA mutase fused (IcmF). IcmF catalyzes the interconversion of isobutyryl-CoA and n-butyryl-CoA, whereas GTPase activity is associated with its G-protein domain. In this study, we report a novel activity associated with IcmF, i.e. the interconversion of isovaleryl-CoA and pivalyl-CoA. Kinetic characterization of IcmF yielded the following values: a Km for isovaleryl-CoA of 62 ± 8 μm and Vmax of 0.021 ± 0.004 μmol min−1 mg−1 at 37 °C. Biochemical experiments show that an IcmF in which the base specificity loop motif NKXD is modified to NKXE catalyzes the hydrolysis of both GTP and ATP. IcmF is susceptible to rapid inactivation during turnover, and GTP conferred modest protection during utilization of isovaleryl-CoA as substrate. Interestingly, there was no protection from inactivation when either isobutyryl-CoA or n-butyryl-CoA was used as substrate. Detailed kinetic analysis indicated that inactivation is associated with loss of the 5′-deoxyadenosine moiety from the active site, precluding reformation of AdoCbl at the end of the turnover cycle. Under aerobic conditions, oxidation of the cob(II)alamin radical in the inactive enzyme results in accumulation of aquacobalamin. Because pivalic acid found in sludge can be used as a carbon source by some bacteria and isovaleryl-CoA is an intermediate in leucine catabolism, our discovery of a new isomerase activity associated with IcmF expands its metabolic potential. 5′-Deoxyadenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl)-dependent isomerases catalyze carbon skeleton rearrangements using radical chemistry. We have recently characterized a fusion protein that comprises the two subunits of the AdoCbl-dependent isobutyryl-CoA mutase flanking a G-protein chaperone and named it isobutyryl-CoA mutase fused (IcmF). IcmF catalyzes the interconversion of isobutyryl-CoA and n-butyryl-CoA, whereas GTPase activity is associated with its G-protein domain. In this study, we report a novel activity associated with IcmF, i.e. the interconversion of isovaleryl-CoA and pivalyl-CoA. Kinetic characterization of IcmF yielded the following values: a Km for isovaleryl-CoA of 62 ± 8 μm and Vmax of 0.021 ± 0.004 μmol min−1 mg−1 at 37 °C. Biochemical experiments show that an IcmF in which the base specificity loop motif NKXD is modified to NKXE catalyzes the hydrolysis of both GTP and ATP. IcmF is susceptible to rapid inactivation during turnover, and GTP conferred modest protection during utilization of isovaleryl-CoA as substrate. Interestingly, there was no protection from inactivation when either isobutyryl-CoA or n-butyryl-CoA was used as substrate.

Investigating how cells respond to nanosecond pulses is essential for a) development of biomedical applications of nsPEFs, including cancer therapy, and b) better understanding of the mechanisms underlying such bioelectrical effects. In this work, we explored relatively mild exposure conditions to provide insight into weak, reversible effects, laying a foundation for a better understanding of the interaction mechanisms and kinetics underlying nsPEF bio-effects. In particular, we report changes in the nucleus of Jurkat cells (human lymphoblastoid T cells) exposed to single pulses of 60 ns duration and 1.0, 1.5 and 2.5 MV/m amplitudes, which do not affect cell growth and viability. A dose-dependent reduction in alkaline comet-assayed DNA migration is observed immediately after nsPEF exposure, accompanied by permeabilization of the plasma membrane (YO-PRO-1 uptake). Comet assay profiles return to normal within 60 minutes after pulse delivery at the highest pulse amplitude tested, indicating that our exposure protocol affects the nucleus, modifying DNA electrophoretic migration patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2008784062,"Background The Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N1 virus has dramatically spread throughout Southeast Asia since its first detection in 1997. Merit Release Birds, such as the Eurasian Tree Sparrow, are believed to increase one's positive karma when kissed and released during Buddhist rituals. Since these birds are often in close contact with both poultry and humans, we investigated their potential role in the spread of H5N1 virus. Methodology/Principal Findings Seven series of experiments were conducted in order to investigate the possible interactions between inoculated and exposed birds, including sparrow/sparrow, sparrow/chicken, duck/sparrow. Daily and post-mortem samples collected were tested for H5N1 virus by real-time RT-PCR and egg inoculation. When directly inoculated, Eurasian Tree Sparrows were highly susceptible to the H5N1 virus, with a fatality rate approaching 100% within 5 days post-inoculation. Although transmission of fatal infection between sparrows did not occur, seroconversion of the exposed birds was observed. Up to 100% chickens exposed to inoculated sparrows died of H5N1 infection, depending on the caging conditions of the birds, while a fatality rate of 50% was observed on sparrows exposed to infected ducks. Large quantities of H5N1 virus were detected in the sparrows, particularly in their feathers, from which infectious particles were recovered. Conclusions/Significance Our study indicates that under experimental conditions, Eurasian Tree Sparrows are susceptible to H5N1 infection, either by direct inoculation or by contact with infected poultry. Their ability to transmit H5N1 infection to other birds is also demonstrated, suggesting that the sparrows may play a role in the dissemination of the virus. Finally, the presence of significant quantities of H5N1 virus on sparrows' feathers, including infectious particles, would suggest that Merit Release Birds represent a risk for human contamination in countries where avian influenza virus is circulating and where this religious ritual is practiced."
https://openalex.org/W1992786804,"Background Randomized evidence for vaccine immunogenicity and safety is urgently needed in the setting of pandemics with new emerging infectious agents. We carried out an observational survey to evaluate how many randomized controlled trials testing 2009 H1N1 vaccines were published among those registered, and what was the time lag from their start to publication and from their completion to publication. Methods PubMed, EMBASE and 9 clinical trial registries were searched for eligible randomized controlled trials. The units of the analysis were single randomized trials on any individual receiving influenza vaccines in any setting. Results 73 eligible trials were identified that had been registered in 2009–2010. By June 30, 2011 only 21 (29%) of these trials had been published, representing 38% of the randomized sample size (19905 of 52765). Trials starting later were published less rapidly (hazard ratio 0.42 per month; 95% Confidence Interval: 0.27 to 0.64; p<0.001). Similarly, trials completed later were published less rapidly (hazard ratio 0.43 per month; 95% CI: 0.27 to 0.67; p<0.001). Randomized controlled trials were completed promptly (median, 5 months from start to completion), but only a minority were subsequently published. Conclusions Most registered randomized trials on vaccines for the H1N1 pandemic are not published in the peer-reviewed literature."
https://openalex.org/W2109829440,"Innate immune recognition is based on the detection, by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), of molecular structures that are unique to microorganisms. Lipoglycans are macromolecules specific to the cell envelope of mycobacteria and related genera. They have been described to be ligands, as purified molecules, of several PRRs, including the C-type lectins Mannose Receptor and DC-SIGN, as well as TLR2. However, whether they are really sensed by these receptors in the context of a bacterium infection remains unclear. To address this question, we used the model organism Mycobacterium smegmatis to generate mutants altered for the production of lipoglycans. Since their biosynthesis cannot be fully abrogated, we manipulated the biosynthesis pathway of GDP-Mannose to obtain some strains with either augmented (∼1.7 fold) or reduced (∼2 fold) production of lipoglycans. Interestingly, infection experiments demonstrated a direct correlation between the amount of lipoglycans in the bacterial cell envelope on one hand and the magnitude of innate immune signaling in TLR2 reporter cells, monocyte/macrophage THP-1 cell line and human dendritic cells, as revealed by NF-κB activation and IL-8 production, on the other hand. These data establish that lipoglycans are bona fide Microbe-Associated Molecular Patterns contributing to innate immune detection of mycobacteria, via TLR2 among other PRRs."
https://openalex.org/W2098672022,"Agents that form methylation adducts in DNA are highly mutagenic and carcinogenic, and organisms have evolved specialized cellular pathways devoted to their repair, including DNA alkyltransferases. These are proteins conserved in eucarya, bacteria and archaea, acting by a unique reaction mechanism, which leads to direct repair of DNA alkylation damage and irreversible protein alkylation. The alkylated form of DNA alkyltransferases is inactive, and in eukaryotes, it is rapidly directed to degradation. We report here in vitro and in vivo studies on the DNA alkyltransferase from the thermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus (SsOGT). The development of a novel, simple, and sensitive fluorescence-based assay allowed a careful characterization of the SsOGT biochemical and DNA binding activities. In addition, transcriptional and post-translational regulation of SsOGT by DNA damage was studied. We show that although the gene transcription is induced by alkylating agent treatment, the protein is degraded in vivo by an alkylation-dependent mechanism. These experiments suggest a striking conservation, from archaea to humans, of this important pathway safeguarding genome stability."

Here we report on the new computational docking algorithm FRIGATE which unites continuous local optimization techniques (conjugate gradient method) with an inherently discrete computational approach in forcefield computation, resulting in equal or better scoring accuracies than several benchmark docking programs. By utilizing FRIGATE for a virtual screen of the ZINC library against the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) enzyme antigen 85C, we identified novel small molecule inhibitors of multiple drug-resistant Mtb, which bind in vitro to the catalytic site of antigen 85C."
https://openalex.org/W2167068301,"Temperature-sensitive (TS) mutants are powerful tools to study gene function in vivo. These mutants exhibit wild-type activity at permissive temperatures and reduced activity at restrictive temperatures. Although random mutagenesis can be used to generate TS mutants, the procedure is laborious and unfeasible in multicellular organisms. Further, the underlying molecular mechanisms of the TS phenotype are poorly understood. To elucidate TS mechanisms, we used a machine learning method-logistic regression-to investigate a large number of sequence and structure features. We developed and tested 133 features, describing properties of either the mutation site or the mutation site neighborhood. We defined three types of neighborhood using sequence distance, Euclidean distance, and topological distance. We discovered that neighborhood features outperformed mutation site features in predicting TS mutations. The most predictive features suggest that TS mutations tend to occur at buried and rigid residues, and are located at conserved protein domains. The environment of a buried residue often determines the overall structural stability of a protein, thus may lead to reversible activity change upon temperature switch. We developed TS prediction models based on logistic regression and the Lasso regularized procedure. Through a ten-fold cross-validation, we obtained the area under the curve of 0.91 for the model using both sequence and structure features. Testing on independent datasets suggested that the model predicted TS mutations with a 50% precision. In summary, our study elucidated the molecular basis of TS mutants and suggested the importance of neighborhood properties in determining TS mutations. We further developed models to predict TS mutations derived from single amino acid substitutions. In this way, TS mutants can be efficiently obtained through experimentally introducing the predicted mutations."
https://openalex.org/W1964240122,"Alternative splicing of mRNAs is known to involve a major regulation of gene expression at RNA level in mammalian cells. The PTEN (Phosphatase and TENsin homologue deleted from the human chromosome 10), TPTE (Transmembrane Phosphatase with TEnsin homology) and TPIP (TPTE and PTEN homologous Inositol lipid Phosphatase) belong to a family of dual-specific lipid and protein phosphatases. PTEN is a well characterized tumor suppressor, which plays crucial role in cell survival, cell cycle regulation, cell proliferation as well as adhesion, motility and migration of cells. The C2-domain of PTEN is essential for PTEN-functions. We have isolated a novel 1019 bp human TPIP cDNA (TPIP-C2) from a human testis cDNA library. In silico analysis of the cDNA revealed that it is produced from the TPIP-locus on the human chromosome 13 by alternative RNA-splicing. It has a unique 5′-Alu sequence, a LINE sequence followed by a 582 bp Open Reading Frame (ORF) encoding a 193 aa polypeptide with a partial phosphatase domain and a C2-domain. TPIP-C2 mRNA is expressed in human testis and in mouse tissues. Mouse testis and brain showed higher levels of TPIP-C2 mRNA in comparison to the heart, liver and kidney under normal physiological conditions. TPIP-C2 mRNAs from human and mouse testes show extensive sequence identity. Over-expression of TPIP-C2 cDNA in HeLa cells strongly (up to 85%) inhibited cell growth/proliferation and caused apoptosis in a caspase 3-dependent manner. These findings suggest for the first time that a TPIP splice-variant mRNA with a partial phosphatase domain and a C2-domain is expressed in cells and tissues of human and murine origins under normal physiological conditions. Inhibition of cell growth/proliferation and induction of apoptosis by overexpression of TPIP-C2 mRNA in HeLa cells suggest that it may be involved in negative regulation of cell growth/proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1972052110,"Cellular signaling networks display complex architecture. Defining the design principle of this architecture is crucial for our understanding of various biological processes. Using a mathematical model for three-node feed-forward loops, we identify that the organization of motifs in specific manner within the network serves as an important regulator of signal processing. Further, incorporating a systemic stochastic perturbation to the model we could propose a possible design principle, for higher-order organization of motifs into larger networks in order to achieve specific biological output. The design principle was then verified in a large, complex human cancer signaling network. Further analysis permitted us to classify signaling nodes of the network into robust and vulnerable nodes as a result of higher order motif organization. We show that distribution of these nodes within the network at strategic locations then provides for the range of features displayed by the signaling network."
https://openalex.org/W1992479055,"The use of RNA transport elements from different viruses can provide novel attributes to HIV-1-based gene delivery systems such as improved safety or Rev independence. We previously described an HIV-1 based gene delivery system that utilized the simian immunodeficiency virus Rev-response element (RRE) in place of the HIV-1 RRE. Despite the use of Rev for the production of vector stocks, we showed the utility of this system for delivery of Rev M10, a dominant-negative mutant of HIV-1 Rev, into T-cells. Here, we investigated the use of RNA transport elements from Mason-Pfizer monkey virus or MPMV for the creation of high-titered Rev-free HIV-1-based packaging systems. The HIV-1 gag/pol expression constructs containing one or more copies of MPMV constitutive RNA transport element (CTE) were used to package similarly modified gene-transfer vectors in the presence or absence of Rev. An inverse correlation between the number of CTE modules and Rev dependency was noted for vector stock production. While packaging systems containing multiple CTEs were resistant to exogenously expressed Rev M10, the titers of vectors encoding Rev M10 were nevertheless reduced in comparison to vectors encoding only green fluorescent protein (GFP). In contrast, a gene transfer vector encoding the Rev M10 transgene and containing both RNA transport elements exhibited almost no loss in titer in comparison to a corresponding vector encoding only GFP. The optimized Rev-independent gene delivery system was used for delivery of Rev M10 transgene into T-lymphocytes. Upon challenge in single round infection assays with HIV-1, the modified T-cells produced fewer virus particles than control cells expressing GFP. This Rev-free packaging system may prove useful for targeting the Rev-RRE-Crm1 nucleocytoplasmic RNA transport pathway for inhibiting HIV replication."
