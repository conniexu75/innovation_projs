The relative shift in gaze from right to left is accentuated when the questions also involve spatial manipulation and attenuated when the questions require verbal manipulation. The data support the hypothesis that the right hemisphere has a special role in emotion in the intact brain, and that predictable patterning of hemispheric activity can occur when specific combinations of cognitive and affective processes interact."

The mice showed reduced amplitudes of miniature endplate potentials and reduced numbers of acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junctions. Some mice showed typical decremental responses on repetitive nerve stimulation, with reversal by neostigmine. This represents the first evidence of a circulating factor in the serum of patients with myasthenia gravis which on passive transfer reproduces features of the disease in experimental animals."

The sensitivity to other lectins of these cells and of CHO cells resistant to concanavalin A (ConA) has been determined, and their activity of UDP-N-acetyl-glucosamine glycoprotein N-acetyl-glucosaminyltransferase (GlcNAc-T) has been measured. At least 8 different phenotypes have been identified on the basis of this analysis, and complementation between 2 of them demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W1560354598,"Fluorescence spectroscopy and inhibition kinetics were used to quantitate the affinity of nonsubstrate ligands for the rat liver glutathione S-transferases AA, A, B, and C in the presence of glutahione. The dissociation constants KD, for ligands such as bilirubin, indocyanine green, and hematin were determined by measuring the decrease in the intrinsic fluorescence of the proteins attendant on the addition of ligand. A second technique, used for compounds which absorb strongly at the excitation maxima of tryptophan, was to utilize 8-anilinonaphthalen sulfonate in the formation of protein complex fluorescing at a higher wavelength. The quenching of this complex allowed the determination of the dissociation constants for ligands such as 3,6-dibromosulfophthalein and cephalothin. These data indicate that all four proteins bind these ligands but do so with different affinities. The bilirubin-induced decrease in fluorescence was used to estimate the stoichiometry of binding as 1.2 mol of bilirubin bound/mol of transferase B and 0.7 mol/mol of transferase C. All of the ligands examine are inhibitors of catalytic activity, as tested in a standard assay with GSH and 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene as substrates. From these studies we conclude that these proteins have a broad specificity not only for their substrates, but for the binding of nonsubstrate ligands as well."
https://openalex.org/W1974924927,"Purified reovirus synthesizes in vitro a mixture of mRNA molecules that contain 5′ terminal structures of the type ppG…, GpppG…, and m7GpppGm, the relative amount of each depending upon the presence of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) or S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) in the transcription incubation mixture. Reovirus mRNAs containing 5′ termini of the type ppG… and GpppG… can be specifically modified by wheat germ extracts in the presence of SAM to yield the structure m7GpppG… (Muthukrishnan et al., 1975). The mRNA methylase activity is ribosome-independent and is recovered almost entirely in the high speed supernatant fraction of wheat germ extracts. Its activity is inhibited by aurintricarboxylic acid. Ribosome binding experiments with reovirus mRNA and wheat germ extract indicate that only those mRNA molecules containing 5′ terminal m7G are capable of participating in the initiation of protein synthesis and subsequent polysome formation. mRNA with unmethylated 5′ termini do not form a complex with 40S ribosomal subunits. Discrimination between unmethylated and methylated reovirus mRNA, active in protein synthesis, apparently occurs at or before the formation of 40S-mRNA complexes. T1 or pancreatic RNAase digestion of methylated mRNA bound to 80S ribosomes yields 5′ terminal fragments of apparent chain lengths about 32 and 36 nucleotides, respectively. A portion of the T1 RNAase-resistant fragments rebinds to ribosomes to form a nuclease-resistant complex. In contrast, the shorter 5′ terminal oligonucleotide m7GpppGmpCpUp(Np)3Gp derived by RNAase T1 digestion of purified reovirus mRNA does not bind to ribosomes. The results suggest that 5′ terminal m7G may function as the primary recognition signal for ribosome binding and that wheat germ ribosomes bind very close to the 5′ termini of some of the species of methylated reovirus mRNAs."

https://openalex.org/W1491810255,"The regulation of urea synthesis from ammonia was investigated using isolated hepatocytes from fasted rats. Addition of ammonia alone produced only a small increase of urea formation, which was stimulated 2-fold by ornithine in conjunction with a fall of ATP levels and an accumulation of citrulline. Further addition of oleate or beta-hydroxybutyrate produced an additional 2-fold stimulation of urea formation to approximately 200 mumol/g dry weight/hour. The presence of oleate also protected against the inhibitory effect of 2,4-dinitrophenol on urea synthesis and the cellular ATP content. The data suggest that both the rate of of energy production and the rate of generation of reducing equivalents from endogensou substrates are insufficient to meet the requirements for optimal rates of urea synthesis. Urea formation from NH3 in the presence of ornithine and oleate, but iin the absence of gluconeogenic precursors, was inhibited by butylmalonate, a known inhibitor of malate-phosphate exchange across the mitochondrial membrane, and stimulated by theaddition of malate and other dicarboxylic acids and amino acids to the cell suspension..."

https://openalex.org/W1994564568,"Melatonin induced marked testicular regression in hamsters maintained on photostimulatory long days (light-dark 14 : 10). In animals maintained on nonstimulatory short days (light-dark 6 : 18), small amounts of melatonin (50 micrograms per day; 100 millimeters capsule length) prevented testicular regression; but testicular atrophy occurred in hamsters that received larger amounts of melatonin (75 to 100 micrograms per day; 150 to 200 millimeters capsule length) and in control hamsters that received none. The results demonstrate that melatonin can exert either pro- or antigonadal effects and emphasize that the effects of melatonin on the testis cannot be properly assessed unless account is taken of the dosage and mode of melatonin administration and the photoperiod on which experimental animals are maintained."

The gene coding for the major species maps at position 30 on the viral DNA, where it spans a site cleaved by the restriction enzyme Bam HI. The minor species, constituting a few percent of the total VA-RNA, is distantly related in oligonucleotide composition to the major species. Its template maps within 700 base pairs to the right of the gene for the major species. The direction of transcription is from left to right on the conventional Ad2 map. These results, gained with a novel method for blotting DNA from agarose gels to nitrocellulose paper (E. M.

https://openalex.org/W2052054020,"Sindbis virus 26S RNA is the principal species of virus-specific RNA found in the infected cell; it is derived from a one third segment of virion 42S RNA. When translated in cell-free extracts from mouse ascites cells or rabbit reticulocytes, 26S RNA directed the synthesis primarily of the 33,000 dalton virus capsid protein, and the protein products were in the form of free peptides rather than peptidyl-tRNA. In contrast, the polypeptides synthesized in either extract in response to Sindbis virus 42S RNA were heterogeneous, ranging in molecular weight from 33,000 to 190,000, and were largely in the form of peptidyl-tRNA. The number of independent initiation sites on the 26S and 42S RNAs was determined by analyzing a tryptic digest of reaction products labeled with yeast N-formyl-35S-methionyl-tRNAFmet. The 26S RNA appeared to contain a single initiation site, and this site could also be found in varying amounts in different preparations of 42S RNA. However, a second initiation site, distinct from that of 26S RNA, was the major site in 42S virion RNA. These results suggest that 42S virion RNA contains two potential sites for initiation of protein synthesis. Only one of these may be active, however, and it is postulated that the second site functions primarily, if not exclusively, in the subgenomic 26S RNA species. In this regard, Sindbis virus 42S RNA may represent a novel form of a eucaryotic messenger RNA."

Separation of poly(A) RNA (mRNA) by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography suggests an increase in this group of RNAs. However, the ratios of 28S to 18S rRNAs, tRNA to rRNA, and mRNA to total cellular RNA were not significantly different in cells before and after senescence, indicating that the overall increases in total cellular RNA was not due to an accumulation of a single RNA class."

https://openalex.org/W1603545040,"Mitochondria from dog renal cortex were incubated with L-[14Cglutamine. Glutamate metabolism was prevented by inhibitors so that glutamate accumulated either in the mitochondrial matrix space or in the medium. The formation and accumuation of glutamate formed from glutamine and the distribution of glutamine in the mitochondrial fluid spaces were studied. In the matrix space glutamate rapidly reaches levels over 5 times that of glutamine in the medium. A more gradual accumulation occurs in the medium as glutamate is transported out of the mitochondria. Addition of an energy source such as succinate to the medium accelerates glutamate formation. A Km of 0.6 mM appears to govern the reaction at low concentrations of glutamine; at about 4 mM an abrupt change kinetics occurs with a Km of 5 mM above that level. Both NH4+ and glutamate inhibit glutamine metabolism and phosphate stimulates it, but little effect glutamate or phosphate occurs at low levels of these substances. The pH optimum of the reaction is between 7.4 and 7.8. Mersalyl and p-chloromercuribenzoate strongly inhibit glutamate formation; N-ethylmaleimide and bromcresol green have weaker inhibitory actions, and borate increases the reaction rate. In the presence of mersalyl, glutamine is striclly confined to the outer space of mitochondria and none is detectable in the matrix space. Similarly at ) degrees glutamine is confined to the simultaneously determined sucrose or mannitol spaces..."
https://openalex.org/W1551229083,"A temperature-sensitive Chinese hamster cell mutant, ts14, is unable to synthesize protein in tissue culture at 39 degrees. That mutant's protein biosynthetic machinery has been characterized in cell-free, biologically active extracts. Similar to the mutant's phenotype in tissue culture, ts14 extracts cease protein synthesis in vitro within 15 min at 40 degrees. In contrast, at 25 degrees both ts14 and wild type extracts synthesize protein for more than 2 hours. Fractionation of mutant extracts and complementation with comparable wild type preparations indicate that ts14 possesses a thermolabile component associated with its polyribosomes. In preparation of ts14 ribosomes that are free of mRNA and bound protein factors, the defective factor is complemented functionally only by 60 S ribosomal subunits prepared from the wild type parent. Sedimentation analyses in sucrose gradients demonstrate that ts14's mutation specifically affects stability of the mutant's 60 S ribosome. Treatment with high ionic strength buffers preferentially disrupts the mutant's 60 S ribosomal subunit and results in preparations of mutant ribosomes that contain biologically active 40 S subunits only. These studies demonstrate the applicability of a genetic approach to analyzing structure-function relationships in the eukaryotic ribosome."

https://openalex.org/W1586971155,"Transcription of globin mRNA sequences from rabbit marrow chromatin was detected by hybridization with globin complementary DNA (cDNA). The presence of newly synthesized RNA in cDNA-globin mRNA hybrids isolated by Cs2SO4 density equilibrium centrifugation required the addition of both rabbit marrow chromatin and DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Escherichia coli) to the transcription reaction. No globin mRNA sequences were detected in RNA transcribed from rabbit liver chromatin or from rabbit marrow DNA. Selective transcription of globin mRNA sequences was therefore tissue-specific and dependent on the presence of chromosomal proteins. Globin mRNA sequences synthesized by E. coli RNA polymerase were distinguished from those synthesized by chromatin-bound (endogenous) RNA polymerases by the use of alpha-amanitin. A typical reaction with rabbit marrow chromatin yielded 100 mug of purified RNA which contained approximately 5 ng (0.005%) of globin mRNA sequences synthesized by E. coli RNA polymerase, 1 ng (0.001%) of globin mRNA seqeences synthesized by endogenous RNA polymerases, and 4 ng (0.004%) of globin mRNA sequences derived from chromatin-associated (endogenous) RNA. Forty per cent of the globin mRNA sequences derived from endogenous RNA could be removed by poly(U)-Sepharose chromatography.

The primary requirement is that the frequency separation in the complex at one ear be slightly different from that in the other--that is, that there be a small interaural difference in the envelope periodicities. This finding is in accord with other recent demonstrations that the auditory system is not deaf to interaural time differences at high frequencies."

https://openalex.org/W1514107311,"Venous blood was obtained from five sickle cell trait donors with relatively hemoglobin concentrations (40% of total hemoglobin) and five donors with unusually hemoglobin concentrations (25 to 30%). A fraction of cells with 15 to 20% reticulocytes was isolated from the blood and incubated with [3H]leucine in a medium supporting protein synthesis for various times from 1.25 to 60 min. Previous studies showed an imbalance in globin chain synthesis in reticulocytes of low hemoglobin S donors which suggested the presence of an alpha-thalassemia gene; reticulocytes of high hemoglobin S donors had balanced globin chain synthesis (DeSimone, J., Kleve, L., Longley, M.A., and Shaeffer, J. (1974) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 59, 564-569). In the present study the soluble phase of the 3H-labeled reticulocytes was examined by electrophoresis on strips of cellulose acetate. The tetramer hemoglobins A and were separated from each other and from a small pool of free, newly synthesized alpha and beta chains. Kinetics of labeling studies showed that the free alpha and beta chains were intermediates in tetramer hemoglobin assembly. The distribution of radioactivity between the alpha and beta chains of each of the electrophoretically isolated components were determined by separation of their globin chains on CM-cellulose columns. After 5 min of 3H-labeling of the reticulocytes from donors with 40% hemoglobin the ratio of newly synthesized alpha chains to beta chains in the tetramer hemoglobins A and ranged from 0.37 to 0.58. This ratio increased with longer labeling times. Almost all of the radioactivity of the free chain intermediates was in the alpha chain. These results confirmed the presence of a significant pool of newly synthesized alpha chains and a normal pattern of hemoglobin assembly in which initially unlabeled alpha chains combined with labeled beta chains when the cells were exposed to [3H]leucine. Conversely, in the reticulocytes of donors with 25 to 30% hemoglobin the ratio of newly synthesized alpha chains to beta chains in the completed hemoglobins A and ranged from 0.96 to 1.37 and remained unchanged throughout the 3H-labelling period. The radioactivity of the free alpha chain pool was substantially less that the total radioactivity of the betaA and betaS chain pools. These results confirmed the existence of a decreased pool size of soluble alpha chain intermediates and a pattern of hemoglobin assembly consistent with the presence of the alpha-thalassemia gene."

Comparison of the T:14C ratios in glucose produced from [U-14C, 5-T]fructose and D-[U-14C, 2-T]glyceraldehyde indicate that there is tritium retention in the metabolism of fructose via the fructokinase-initiated pathway.

Cooperation was reestablished by removal of the drug. Cytochalasin B inhibited cooperation by the donor 3T3 cells in both the layer and wound edges, irrespective of topoinhibition and topostimulation.

Evidence is also provided that arginase does not associate heterogeneously with urease, and therefore, in the absence of macromolecular interactions, the arginase-urease couple provides a suitable experimental system to test the applicability of theory previously developed to guide the interpretation of coupled assay results. Application of the theory led to values of the Michaelis constant and maximal velocity describing the first reaction in the sequence, catalyzed by arginase, which agreed within experimental error with the corresponding values obtained by studying the arginase-catalyzed reaction alone. Comment is also made on the product inhibition of arginase by ornithine, which must be considered in the comparison of experimental results describing the time course of a coupled assay with theoretical solutions obtained by numerical integration."
