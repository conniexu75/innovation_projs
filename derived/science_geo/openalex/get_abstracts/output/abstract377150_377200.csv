To understand the process of dog diversification better, we conducted an extensive genome-wide survey of more than 48,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms in dogs and their wild progenitor, the grey wolf. Here we show that dog breeds share a higher proportion of multi-locus haplotypes unique to grey wolves from the Middle East, indicating that they are a dominant source of genetic diversity for dogs rather than wolves from east Asia, as suggested by mitochondrial DNA sequence data. Furthermore, we find a surprising correspondence between genetic and phenotypic/functional breed groupings but there are exceptions that suggest phenotypic diversification depended in part on the repeated crossing of individuals with novel phenotypes. Our results show that Middle Eastern wolves were a critical source of genome diversity, although interbreeding with local wolf populations clearly occurred elsewhere in the early history of specific lineages. More recently, the evolution of modern dog breeds seems to have been an iterative process that drew on a limited genetic toolkit to create remarkable phenotypic diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2063864717,"Cellular senescence has been recently shown to have an important role in opposing tumour initiation and promotion. Senescence induced by oncogenes or by loss of tumour suppressor genes is thought to critically depend on induction of the p19Arf–p53 pathway. The Skp2 E3-ubiquitin ligase can act as a proto-oncogene and its aberrant overexpression is frequently observed in human cancers. Here we show that although Skp2 inactivation on its own does not induce cellular senescence, aberrant proto-oncogenic signals as well as inactivation of tumour suppressor genes do trigger a potent, tumour-suppressive senescence response in mice and cells devoid of Skp2. Notably, Skp2 inactivation and oncogenic-stress-driven senescence neither elicit activation of the p19Arf–p53 pathway nor DNA damage, but instead depend on Atf4, p27 and p21. We further demonstrate that genetic Skp2 inactivation evokes cellular senescence even in oncogenic conditions in which the p19Arf–p53 response is impaired, whereas a Skp2–SCF complex inhibitor can trigger cellular senescence in p53/Pten-deficient cells and tumour regression in preclinical studies. Our findings therefore provide proof-of-principle evidence that pharmacological inhibition of Skp2 may represent a general approach for cancer prevention and therapy. Recent studies suggest that cellular senescence — an irreversible form of cell-cycle arrest — can halt tumour growth in vitro. Hui-Kuan Lin et al. now identify a previously unknown pathway that drives senescence without the involvement of most of the known mediators of senescence. Instead, it signals via the transcription factor Atf6, and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p27 and p21. The pathway is uncovered by inactivation of the proto-oncogene Skp2, but only in the context of oncogenic signalling. Targeting the Skp2 complex pharmacologically restricts tumorigenesis by inducing cellular senescence, suggesting that such drugs may be effective in cancer prevention and therapy. Cellular senescence — an irreversible cell-cycle arrest — has been implicated in suppressing tumour formation or growth. A new cellular signalling pathway that drives senescence has now been identified. This pathway does not involve most known mediators of senescence, and instead signals via the proteins Atf4, p27 and p21. Inactivating the proto-oncogene Skp2 in the context of oncogenic signalling can induce senescence through this new pathway, indicating that drugs that target Skp2 might be useful in cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2076336980,"Until now, quantum atomic gases and single trapped ions have been treated separately in experiments. Now a team from the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge has combined the two, in the form of a hybrid quantum system composed of a Bose–Einstein condensate of neutral atoms and a trapped atomic ion. They achieve independent control over the two systems, study the fundamental interaction processes and observe sympathetic cooling of the single ion by the condensate. Possible avenues of research that this could lead to include the continuous cooling of quantum computers, and explorations of entanglement in hybrid quantum systems. Until now, quantum atomic gases and single trapped ions have been treated separately in experiments. Now a hybrid system has been investigated, involving the immersion of a single trapped ion into a Bose–Einstein condensate of neutral atoms. The two systems could be controlled independently and the fundamental interaction processes were studied. Sympathetic cooling of the single ion by the condensate was observed, hinting at the possibility of using these condensates as refrigerators for ion-trap quantum computers. Improved control of the motional and internal quantum states of ultracold neutral atoms and ions has opened intriguing possibilities for quantum simulation and quantum computation. Many-body effects have been explored with hundreds of thousands of quantum-degenerate neutral atoms1, and coherent light–matter interfaces have been built2,3. Systems of single or a few trapped ions have been used to demonstrate universal quantum computing algorithms4 and to search for variations of fundamental constants in precision atomic clocks5. Until now, atomic quantum gases and single trapped ions have been treated separately in experiments. Here we investigate whether they can be advantageously combined into one hybrid system, by exploring the immersion of a single trapped ion into a Bose–Einstein condensate of neutral atoms. We demonstrate independent control over the two components of the hybrid system, study the fundamental interaction processes and observe sympathetic cooling of the single ion by the condensate. Our experiment calls for further research into the possibility of using this technique for the continuous cooling of quantum computers6. We also anticipate that it will lead to explorations of entanglement in hybrid quantum systems and to fundamental studies of the decoherence of a single, locally controlled impurity particle coupled to a quantum environment7,8."
https://openalex.org/W2042620313,"The ion channel TRPA1 plays a key role in human pain signalling by mediating the detection of reactive electrophiles — noxious chemicals — but its role in invertebrates has been unclear. Now Kang et al. demonstrate that fly and mosquito TRPA1 channels act as molecular sensors of these same chemicals in insect gustatory chemosensory neurons. Further molecular evolution analysis shows that, in contrast to other chemical senses such as gustation or olfaction, reactive electrophile detection represents an ancient sensory modality conserved in molecular detail across some 500 million years of animal evolution. The results should facilitate the design of new repellents against important insect pests affecting agriculture and public health. Reactive electrophiles are noxious chemicals, such as acrolein in cigarette smoke, and are detected by the ion channel TRPA1 in humans. Here it is shown that TRPA1 channels sense these chemicals in the gustatory chemosensory neurons of fruitflies and mosquitoes, too. Further findings show that, unlike with other chemical senses such as smell or taste, the detection of reactive electrophiles relies on an ancient sensor that has been conserved in molecular detail through some 500 million years of evolution. Chemical nociception, the detection of tissue-damaging chemicals, is important for animal survival and causes human pain and inflammation, but its evolutionary origins are largely unknown. Reactive electrophiles are a class of noxious compounds humans find pungent and irritating, such as allyl isothiocyanate (in wasabi) and acrolein (in cigarette smoke)1,2,3. Diverse animals, from insects to humans, find reactive electrophiles aversive1,2,3, but whether this reflects conservation of an ancient sensory modality has been unclear. Here we identify the molecular basis of reactive electrophile detection in flies. We demonstrate that Drosophila TRPA1 (Transient receptor potential A1), the Drosophila melanogaster orthologue of the human irritant sensor, acts in gustatory chemosensors to inhibit reactive electrophile ingestion. We show that fly and mosquito TRPA1 orthologues are molecular sensors of electrophiles, using a mechanism conserved with vertebrate TRPA1s. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that invertebrate and vertebrate TRPA1s share a common ancestor that possessed critical characteristics required for electrophile detection. These findings support emergence of TRPA1-based electrophile detection in a common bilaterian ancestor, with widespread conservation throughout vertebrate and invertebrate evolution. Such conservation contrasts with the evolutionary divergence of canonical olfactory and gustatory receptors and may relate to electrophile toxicity. We propose that human pain perception relies on an ancient chemical sensor conserved across ∼500 million years of animal evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2107248034,"Bile acids are required for proper absorption of dietary lipids, including fat-soluble vitamins. Here, we show that the dietary vitamins A and D inhibit bile acid synthesis by repressing hepatic expression of the rate-limiting enzyme CYP7A1. Receptors for vitamin A and D induced expression of Fgf15, an intestine-derived hormone that acts on liver to inhibit Cyp7a1. These effects were mediated through distinct cis-acting response elements in the promoter and intron of Fgf15. Interestingly, transactivation of both response elements appears to be required to maintain basal Fgf15 expression levels in vivo. Furthermore, whereas induction of Fgf15 by vitamin D is mediated through its receptor, the induction of Fgf15 by vitamin A is mediated through the retinoid X receptor/farnesoid X receptor heterodimer and is independent of bile acids, suggesting that this heterodimer functions as a distinct dietary vitamin A sensor. Notably, vitamin A treatment reversed the effects of the bile acid sequestrant cholestyramine on Fgf15, Shp, and Cyp7a1 expression, suggesting a potential therapeutic benefit of vitamin A under conditions of bile acid malabsorption. These results reveal an unexpected link between the intake of fat-soluble vitamins A and D and bile acid metabolism, which may have evolved as a means for these dietary vitamins to regulate their own absorption.

Lipid-soluble vitamins are essential for human health and must be obtained from the environment. They exist in four major groups (A, D, E, and K), each of which comprises a series of structurally related compounds with multiple biological functions. Members of the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors are central to the mechanism of action of the lipid-soluble vitamins A and D. Metabolites of vitamin A regulate gene transcription by binding to and activating the retinoic acid receptors (RARs 4The abbreviations used are: RARretinoic acid receptorRXRretinoid X receptorVDRvitamin D receptorFXRfarnesoid X receptorRTreverse transcriptionChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationTTNPB4-((E)-2(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-2-naphthalenyl)-1-propenyl)benzoic acid.; NR1B) and the retinoid X receptors (RXRs; NR2B) (1Mangelsdorf D.J.

Similarly, the genomic actions of vitamin D are mediated by the vitamin D receptor (VDR; NR1I1) (2Haussler M.R. Haussler C.A. Jurutka P.W. Thompson P.D. Hsieh J.C. Remus L.S. Selznick S.H.

Retinol, the basic form of vitamin A, is obtained from foods of animal origin, where it is present in the form of retinyl esters. Vitamin A can also be synthesized in the liver from β-carotene, which is present in foods of plant origin. In the body, retinol is converted to several metabolites that function as signaling molecules in various biological processes, including vision, development, growth, metabolism, and cell differentiation (3Mark M. Ghyselinck N.B. Chambon P. Nucl. Recept. Signal. 2009; 7: e002Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 4Ross A.C. J. Nutr. 1993; 123: 346-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 5Zile M.H. J. Nutr. 1998; 128: 455S-458SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the transcriptional actions of vitamin A in vivo have been shown to require the RXR/RAR heterodimer (3Mark M. Ghyselinck N.B. Chambon P. Nucl. Recept. Signal. 2009; 7: e002Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Vitamin D is synthesized in the skin from 7-dehydrocholesterol through a process that requires sunlight, or it can be obtained directly from the diet. Dietary sources include cholecalciferol (vitamin D3, animal origin) and ergocalciferol (vitamin D2, plant origin). Whether obtained from the diet or photoactivation in the skin, vitamin D must be converted to its bioactive form, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, by the action of cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver and kidney (6Prosser D.E. Jones G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 664-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Vitamin D is best known for its essential role in regulating calcium and phosphate homeostasis (7DeLuca H.F. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2004; 80: 1689S-1696SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the repertoire of physiological systems regulated by vitamin D and its receptor has been expanded to include both innate and adaptive immunity and bile acid detoxification (8Liu P.T. Stenger S. Li H. Wenzel L. Tan B.H. Krutzik S.R. Ochoa M.T. Schauber J. Wu K. Meinken C. Kamen D.L. Wagner M. Bals R. Steinmeyer A. Zügel U. Gallo R.L. Eisenberg D. Hewison M. Hollis B.W. Adams J.S.

The absorption of lipid-soluble vitamins from the diet requires the detergent actions of bile acids. Bile acids are amphipathic sterols synthesized from cholesterol in the liver and secreted into the intestine, where, when present at high concentrations, they function to emulsify dietary lipids (11Hofmann A.F. News Physiol. Sci. 1999; 14: 24-29PubMed Google Scholar). Cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in bile acid biosynthesis, is tightly regulated at the transcriptional level by bile acids and other signaling molecules (12Gilardi F. Mitro N. Godio C. Scotti E. Caruso D. Crestani M. De Fabiani E. Pharmacol. Ther. 2007; 116: 449-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Positive transcriptional regulators of Cyp7a1 include orphan nuclear receptors, LRH-1 (liver-related homologue-1; NR5A2) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (NR2A1) (13Crestani M. Sadeghpour A. Stroup D. Galli G. Chiang J.Y. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 2192-2200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Nitta M. Ku S. Brown C. Okamoto A.Y. Shan B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 6660-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Negative feedback regulation of Cyp7a1 in vivo involves two complementary mechanisms. First, bile acids activate the nuclear bile acid receptor (farnesoid X receptor (FXR); NR1H4) in the intestine to induce expression of Fgf15 (fibroblast growth factor 15; FGF19 in humans), which signals from the intestine to repress hepatic Cyp7a1 through a mechanism that involves the atypical nuclear receptor SHP (small heterodimer partner) and the membrane receptor FGFR4 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 4) (15Inagaki T. Choi M. Moschetta A. Peng L. Cummins C.L. McDonald J.G. Luo G. Jones S.A. Goodwin B. Richardson J.A. Gerard R.D. Repa J.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Kliewer S.A. Cell Metab. 2005; 2: 217-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar). Second, bile acids activate FXR in the liver to induce transcription of SHP, which subsequently binds to LRH-1 and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α, resulting in the repression of Cyp7a1 (16Goodwin B. Jones S.A. Price R.R. Watson M.A. McKee D.D. Moore L.B. Galardi C. Wilson J.G. Lewis M.C. Roth M.E. Maloney P.R. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Mol.

Cell. 2000; 6: 507-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar). How these two FXR-regulated pathways interact to control Cyp7a1 expression is not clear, albeit both are required for the FXR-mediated feedback repression of bile acid biosynthesis (19Kim I. Ahn S.H. Inagaki T. Choi M. Ito S. Guo G.L. Kliewer S.A. Gonzalez F.J. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 2664-2672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Although it is well established that bile acids are essential for the absorption of lipid-soluble vitamins, it is not known whether lipid-soluble vitamins affect bile acid biosynthesis. In this study, we demonstrate that vitamins A and D regulate bile acid synthesis by overlapping but distinct mechanisms. As expected, the action of vitamin D on bile acid homeostasis occurs through activation of VDR. Interestingly, the action of vitamin A is mediated through the RXR/FXR heterodimer. This latter finding supports a novel role for the RXR/FXR heterodimer as a dietary sensor for vitamin A. Male C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories and used for all experiments involving only wild-type animals. VDR+/+ and VDR−/− mice were obtained from heterozygous breeders on a pure 129T2 background. FXR+/+ and FXR−/− mice were obtained from heterozygous breeders on a pure 129S background. FGF15+/+ and FGF15−/− mice were obtained from homozygous breeders on a mixed C57BL/6;129S background. SHP+/+ and SHP−/− mice were obtained from homozygous breeders on a pure 129S background. All animals were housed in the same specific pathogen-free facility. Animals were maintained under a temperature-controlled environment with 12-h light/dark cycles with ad libitum access to water and irradiated rodent chow (TD.2916, Harlan-Teklad). The expression of metabolic genes analyzed in this study is affected by circadian and feeding cycles; therefore, the following steps were taken to ensure a synchronous feeding cycle. On the day prior to death, chow was removed 10 h before the dark cycle, replaced at the onset of the dark cycle, and removed 4 h after the onset of the dark cycle. The change in body weight between the beginning and end of the dark cycle was <5% for all animals. All experiments were done with 3–6-month-old (age-matched) male mice killed between 4 and 6 h after the beginning of the light cycle. Mice were killed by isoflurane inhalation and exanguinated via the descending vena cava prior to tissue collection. Vitamin D (1α,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol; Sigma) in sterile saline was administered by intraperitoneal injection at the end of the dark cycle and 4 h before death. Vitamin A (retinyl palmitate, ∼1800 USP units/mg; Sigma) and vitamin E (d-α-tocopherol acetate, ∼1360 IU/g; Sigma) in 1% Tween 80, 1% methylcellulose, and 25 mm HEPES were administered by oral gavage at the beginning and end of the dark cycle (16 and 4 h before death). Cholestyramine was admixed in the diet (custom diet TD.07658, Harlan-Teklad). GW4064 (GlaxoSmithKline) and TTNPB (Sigma) were admixed in the diet (500 and 0.25 mg/kg diet, respectively) and provided ad libitum for 12 h before death. LG268 in 0.25% Tween 80 and 1% methylcellulose was administered by oral gavage 12 h before death at a dose of 30 mg/kg. In all cases, animals in the vehicle group received the appropriate vehicle solutions and diets in a manner identical to the treatment groups. Following death, 5 cm of the terminal ileum was collected and flushed with phosphate-buffered saline to remove the contents. Segments (1 × 3 mm) of the ileum were cultured at 37 °C and 95% oxygen for 6 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (containing 4 g/liter glucose and l-glutamine; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 25 mm HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and either vitamin D or 0.1% ethanol (vehicle). Each condition contained four 1 × 3-mm segments of ileum, from which total RNA was extracted at the end of the 6-h culture period. Bile acid pool size measurements were performed as described previously with minor modifications (20Lee Y.K. Schmidt D.R. Cummins C.L. Choi M. Peng L. Zhang Y. Goodwin B. Hammer R.E. Mangelsdorf D.J. Kliewer S.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2008; 22: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The following is a brief description of the protocol, including modified parameters. Liver, gallbladder, intestines, and attached mesentery were removed en bloc and homogenized in ethanol. Homogenates were heating to boiling, cooled, and then filtered. This step was repeated twice. Filtrates were combined and adjusted to a constant volume. Bile acids were resolved by reverse-phase liquid chromatography (C8 precolumn, C18 analytical column) and quantified by mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization in negative ion mode. The following unconjugated and taurine-conjugated bile acids were used as calibration standards: cholic acid (5β-cholanic acid-3α,7α,12α-triol), α-muricholic acid (5β-cholanic acid-3α,6β,7α-triol), β-muricholic acid (5β-cholanic acid-3α,6β,7β-triol), ω-muricholic acid (5β-cholanic acid-3α,6α,7β-triol), hyocholic acid (5β-cholanic acid-3α,6α,7α-triol), chenodeoxycholic acid (5β-cholanic acid-3α,7α-diol), deoxycholic acid (5β-cholanic acid-3α,12α-diol), hyodeoxycholic acid (5β-cholanic acid-3α,6α-diol), ursodeoxycholic acid (5β-cholanic acid-3α,7β-diol), murocholic acid (5β-cholanic acid-3α,6β-diol), lithocholic acid (5β-cholanic acid-3α-ol), taurocholic acid (5β-cholanic acid-3α,7α,12α-triol-N-(2-sulfoethyl)amide), tauro-α-muricholic acid (5β-cholanic acid-3α,6β,7α-triol-N-(2-sulfoethyl)amide), tauro-β-muricholic acid (5β-cholanic acid-3α,6β,7β-triol-N-(2-sulfoethyl)amide), tauro-ω-muricholic acid (5β-cholanic acid-3α,6α,7β-triol-N-(2-sulfoethyl)amide), taurohyocholic acid (5β-cholanic acid-3α,6α,7α-triol-N-(2-sulfoethyl)amide), taurochenodeoxycholic acid (5β-cholanic acid-3α,7α-diol-N-(2-sulfoethyl)amide), taurodeoxycholic acid (5β-cholanic acid-3α,12α-diol-N-(2-sulfoethyl)amide), tauroursodeoxycholic acid (5β-cholanic acid-3α,7β-diol-N-(2-sulfoethyl)amide), taurohyodeoxycholic acid (5β-cholanic acid-3α,6α-diol-N-(2-sulfoethyl)amide), taurolithocholic acid (5β-cholanic acid-3α-ol-N-(2-sulfoethyl)amide), and taurolithocholic acid 3-sulfate (5β-cholanic acid-3α-ol-N-(2-sulfoethyl)amide 3-sulfate). Deuterium-labeled cholic acid (5β-cholanic acid-3α,7α,12α-triol-2,2,4,4-d4) and chenodeoxycholic acid (5β-cholanic acid-3α,7α-diol-2,2,4,4-d4) were used as recovery controls. Norcholic acid (23-nor-5β-cholanic acid-3α,7α,12α-triol) was used as the sample loading control. Following death, the left lateral lobe of the liver and distal ileum (5 cm proximal to the ileocecal junction, flushed with phosphate-buffered saline) was collected and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted using RNA STAT-60TM (IsoTex Diagnostics). RNA (4 μg) from each sample was DNase-treated and reverse-transcribed using random hexamers. The resulting cDNA was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR using a protocol described previously (21Bookout A.L. Mangelsdorf D.J. Nucl. Recept. Signal. 2003; 1: e012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, quantitative PCRs containing 25 ng of cDNA, 150 nmol of each primer, and SYBR® GreenERTM PCR Master Mix (Invitrogen) were carried out in triplicate in 384-well format using an ABI PRISM® 7900HT instrument (Applied Biosystems). Relative mRNA levels were calculated using the comparative CT method normalized to U36b4. The primer sequences used for gene expression analyses are listed in supplemental Table 1. They were designed using Primer Express® software (Applied Biosystems) and validated as described previously (21Bookout A.L. Mangelsdorf D.J. Nucl. Recept. Signal. 2003; 1: e012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following death, the ileum was collected, flushed with phosphate-buffered saline, and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Samples from four to five mice were pulverized and pooled. 300 mg from each pool was fixed in phosphate-buffered saline with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min and quenched with glycine for 5 min. Samples were then Dounce-homogenized in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, and 5% sucrose) and layered over cushion buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 15 mm NaCl, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% sucrose), followed by centrifugation at 200 × g to collect the crude nuclear pellet. Subsequent ChIP steps were done using the ChIP EZ kit (Upstate) materials and methods. 3 μg of protein from sonicated chromatin was used for pulldown assay with rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-VDR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology C-20x), or anti-RXR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology ΔN-197x). Primers scanning −1500 to +3000 of the Fgf15 locus were designed and used for analyzing VDR and RXR binding by quantitative PCR as described (21Bookout A.L. Mangelsdorf D.J. Nucl. Recept.

This plasmid was used to amplify shorter regions of the Fgf15 promoter, which were likewise inserted into pTk-LUC. Promoter regions were amplified using distinct forward primers (CTGCGAAAGCTTGCTAAAGGAGAG for p400Fgf15+TATA_TkLUC, CCACCAAGCTTCTGTGCATTGAAC for p230Fgf15+TATA_TkLUC, and CCTGTCGACGCATCAAGTCTCC for p100Fgf15+TATA_TkLUC) and a common reverse primer (GGATCCTCTAGAGTCGACAGTGG). p230Fgf15+TATA_TkLUC was amplified using the following overlapping primers containing two altered nucleotides (underlined): GGCCTGGGCGGGACCACTGGGTTGGGG (forward) and CCCAACCCAGTGGTCCCGCCCAGGCC (reverse). The Fgf15 promoter region containing the two-nucleotide mutation was reinserted into pTk-LUC to generate p230(mut-145)Fgf15+TATA_TkLUC. A 2460-nucleotide region encompassing the second intron of Fgf15 was amplified using the following primers containing restriction endonuclease sites (underlined): GAGCGCGGTCGACAAGATATACG (forward) and AAGGTACAGTCGACCTCCGAGTAG (reverse). The product was inserted in reverse orientation upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter sequence in pTk-LUC to generate pFgf15intron2rev_TkLUC. The modified regions of all plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing at the McDermott Sequencing Core of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. HEK293 cells were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in 96-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (containing 4 g/liter glucose and l-glutamine) supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and transfected by calcium phosphate co-precipitation as described previously (23Makishima M.

Following a 16-h treatment with GW4064 and vitamin D, luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured as described previously (18Lu T.T. Makishima M. Repa J.J. Schoonjans K. Kerr T.A.

Activation of VDR in the intestine by 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 or lithocholic acid results in the induction of bile acid-detoxifying genes such as CYP3A4 (22Makishima M. Lu T.T. Xie W.

To determine the extent of VDR contribution to bile acid metabolism in vivo, we measured the bile acid pool size and composition in VDR−/− mice. Surprisingly, we found that VDR−/− mice had an ∼30% larger bile acid pool size at 3 months of age and more than twice the amount of bile acids at 6 months of age as their wild-type littermates (Fig. 1A). The loss of VDR also increased the hydrophobicity of the bile acid pool due to a greater increase in taurocholic acid relative to tauromuricholic acids (Fig. 1A). To determine the mechanism underlying the perturbation of bile acid homeostasis caused by the loss of VDR, we analyzed the expression of genes in the liver known to play a role in bile acid metabolism. In humans and rodents, bile acids are synthesized from cholesterol in the liver via two pathways (27Russell D.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 137-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). CYP7A1 catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in the classic (neutral) pathway of bile acid synthesis, whereas CYP27A1 catalyzes the first step in the alternative (acidic) pathway. Under normal physiological conditions, the majority of bile acids are produced via the classic pathway. Consistent with an increased rate of bile acid synthesis, we found that VDR−/− mice had 3-fold higher expression of Cyp7a1 (Fig. 1B). In addition, the enzyme that catalyzes the final step in the synthesis of cholic acid, Cyp8b1, was increased (Fig. 1B). These changes were accompanied by a 2-fold decrease in Shp mRNA and more modest changes in FXR, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α, and Lrh-1 expression (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. 1A). Expression analysis of the major bile acid transporters revealed decreased expression of the canalicular bile acid export pump Abcb11, a small increase in the phospholipid exporter Abcb4, and no change in the expression of the sinusoidal sodium taurocholate import pump Slc10a1 (supplemental Fig. 1B). In contrast to enzymes of the classic bile acid synthesis pathway, no change was seen in expression of genes encoding enzymes of the alternative bile acid synthesis pathway (supplemental Fig. 1C). These alterations in gene expression in the livers of VDR−/− mice were somewhat surprising given that VDR is not expressed in hepatocytes and suggested that the changes either were secondary to alterations in the bile acid pool size and composition or were caused by perturbation of vitamin D signaling outside the hepatocyte. We next examined gene expression in the terminal small intestine (ileum), which is the major site of bile acid reabsorption and thus plays an integral role in maintaining bile acid homeostasis. Here, bile acid activation of FXR induces expression of bile acid transporters and Fgf15 (15Inagaki T. Choi M. Moschetta A. Peng L. Cummins C.L. McDonald J.G. Luo G. Jones S.A. Goodwin B.

Lipid Res. 2009; 50: 2340-2357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). As described previously, FGF15 is essential for FXR-mediated feedback repression of Cyp7a1 and bile acid synthesis. Surprisingly, despite normal levels of FXR and bile acid transporters, the expression of Fgf15 was decreased markedly in VDR−/− mice (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. 1D). Because VDR is expressed in enterocytes and Fgf15 expression was lower in VDR−/− mice, we hypothesized that VDR might regulate Fgf15 at the transcriptional level. Indeed, treatment of wild-type but not VDR−/− mice with 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (hereafter referred to as vitamin D) for 4 h increased Fgf15 expression in the intestine and decreased Cyp7a1 in the liver (Fig. 2A). Intestinal bile acid transporters were also decreased, whereas the gene encoding the ileal bile acid-binding protein (an FXR target gene also known as Fabp6) was not changed (supplemental Fig. 2). Importantly, the repression of Cyp7a1 by vitamin D was absent in FGF15-null (FGF15−/−) mice, demonstrating that FGF15 is required for vitamin D-dependent suppression of Cyp7a1 (Fig. 2B). To determine whether physiological levels of vitamin D contribute to the regulation of Fgf15, we compared the induction of Fgf15 with that of the gene encoding Calbindin-D9k (a known VDR target gene) in ileum explants. Notably, both genes were induced by vitamin D in a comparable dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2D). Taken together with the finding that VDR is required for normal expression of Fgf15, these data provide evidence that the transcriptional regulation of Fgf15 by vitamin D is physiologically relevant. Previous work has shown that FXR directly regulates Fgf15 expression by binding to an FXR/RXR response element in the second intron of the gene (15Inagaki T. Choi M. Moschetta A. Peng L. Cummins C.L. McDonald J.G. Luo G. Jones S.A. Goodwin B. Richardson J.A. Gerard R.D. Repa J.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Kliewer S.A. Cell Metab. 2005; 2: 217-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar). Given the rapid effect of vitamin D treatment on Fgf15 expression, it seemed likely that the regulation of Fgf15 by VDR was also direct. ChIP analysis was performed to identify VDR/RXR-binding sites in the regulatory regions of Fgf15. As expected, a strong RXR-binding site was detected in the second intron, and an additional binding site was found in the proximal promoter near the transcriptional start site (Fig. 2E). VDR binding was also detected at both sites (Fig. 2E). Interestingly, analysis of the Fgf15 regulatory regions by reporter gene assay showed that VDR transactivation occurred exclusively through the proximal promoter site, whereas FXR transactivation occurred exclusively at the second intron (Fig. 2F). Promoter truncations localized the vitamin D-responsive cis-acting element to a region between 100 and 200 nucleotides upstream of the transcriptional start site (Fig. 2F). Analysis of this region revealed a DR3 site with similarity to known VDR response elements, and transactivation of the Fgf15 promoter by VDR was eliminated by mutating two nucleotides within this site (Fig. 2F). These results demonstrate that VDR binds directly to the Fgf15 promoter and regulates Fgf15 expression through a direct transcriptional mechanism. Given that both VDR and FXR induce Fgf15, we sought to determine whether VDR could substitute for FXR in mediating repression of bile acid synthesis. Although the -fold induction of Fgf15 by vitamin D was similar in wild-type and FXR−/− mice, the absolute levels of Fgf15 in vitamin D-treated FXR−/− mice remained below those in vehicle-treated wild-type mice (Fig. 2C). Notably, the repression of Cyp7a1 by vitamin D was absent in FXR−/− mice (Fig. 2C). These data indicate that the transcriptional regulation of Fgf15 by VDR is not dependent on FXR; however, FXR is required for the induc"

Here, employing an mTOR active-site inhibitor WYE-125132 (WYE-132), we have performed quantitative phospho-proteomics and identified a Ser-75-containing phosphopeptide from Maf1, a known repressor of RNA polymerase III (Pol III) transcription. Treatment of cancer cells with WYE-132 or the rapamycin analog CCI-779 led to a rapid loss of the phosphorylation at Ser-75, whereas this effect was not seen in cells treated with cytotoxic agents or unrelated inhibitors. WYE-132-induced Maf1 dephosphorylation correlated with its accumulation in the nucleus and a marked decline in the cellular levels of pre-tRNAs. Depletion of cellular Maf1 via small interfering RNA increased basal pre-tRNA and rendered tRNA synthesis refractory to mTOR inhibitors. Maf1 mutant proteins carrying S75A alone or with S60A, T64A, and S68A (Maf1-S75A, Maf1–4A) progressively enhanced basal repression of tRNA in actively proliferating cells and attenuated amino acid-induced tRNA transcription. Gene alignment revealed conservation of all four Ser/Thr sites in high eukaryotes, further supporting a critical role of these residues in Maf1 function. Interestingly, mTOR inhibition led to an increase in the occupancy of Maf1 on a set of Pol III-dependent genes, with concomitant reduction in the binding of Pol III and Brf1. Unexpectedly, mTORC1 itself was also enriched at the same set of Pol III templates, but this association was not influenced by mTOR inhibitor treatment. Our results highlight a new and unique mode of regulation of Pol III transcription by mTOR and suggest that normalization of Pol III activity may contribute to the therapeutic efficacy of mTOR inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1977547738,"Variation in transcriptional regulation is thought to be a major cause of phenotypic diversity. Although widespread differences in gene expression among individuals of a species have been observed, studies to examine the variability of transcription factor binding on a global scale have not been performed, and thus the extent and underlying genetic basis of transcription factor binding diversity is unknown. By mapping differences in transcription factor binding among individuals, here we present the genetic basis of such variation on a genome-wide scale. Whole-genome Ste12-binding profiles were determined using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with DNA sequencing in pheromone-treated cells of 43 segregants of a cross between two highly diverged yeast strains and their parental lines. We identified extensive Ste12-binding variation among individuals, and mapped underlying cis- and trans-acting loci responsible for such variation. We showed that most transcription factor binding variation is cis-linked, and that many variations are associated with polymorphisms residing in the binding motifs of Ste12 as well as those of several proposed Ste12 cofactors. We also identified two trans-factors, AMN1 and FLO8, that modulate Ste12 binding to promoters of more than ten genes under alpha-factor treatment. Neither of these two genes was previously known to regulate Ste12, and we suggest that they may be mediators of gene activity and phenotypic diversity. Ste12 binding strongly correlates with gene expression for more than 200 genes, indicating that binding variation is functional. Many of the variable-bound genes are involved in cell wall organization and biogenesis. Overall, these studies identified genetic regulators of molecular diversity among individuals and provide new insights into mechanisms of gene regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2040959543,"CYP24A1 expression is up-regulated by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) via a vitamin D receptor (VDR)/retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimer that binds to two vitamin D response elements (VDREs) located near the proximal promoter. Interestingly, although 1,25(OH)2D3 induced VDR/RXR binding to the VDRE-containing proximal promoter, the VDR/RXR heterodimer also localized to a cluster of at least four potential enhancers located in intergenic regions 50–69 kb downstream of the human CYP24A1 gene and 35–45 kb downstream of the mouse Cyp24a1 gene as revealed by ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq analyses. To address whether this downstream region and potential VDREs located within mediated CYP24A1 induction, we constructed recombinant wild-type and mutant bacterial artificial chromosome clones that spanned mouse and human loci and contained luciferase reporters inserted into their 3′-untranslated regions. The activity of these clones in stably transfected cells revealed that both the proximal and the putative downstream elements contributed to CYP24A1 up-regulation by 1,25(OH)2D3. Further analysis using transfected enhancer fragments led to the identification of contributing regulatory elements in several of these downstream regions. Additional studies of coregulator recruitment using ChIP-chip analysis revealed both similarities and differences between the region located proximal to and those located downstream of the promoter. Recruitment of these coregulators was likely responsible for the increase in RNA polymerase II and histone H4 acetylation, which was also observed in response to 1,25(OH)2D3 at the enhancer sites across the locus. We conclude that a more complex mechanism is responsible for the striking CYP24A1 up-regulation induced by the vitamin D hormone in target cells.

Vitamin D3 is metabolically activated through two important hydroxylations, first in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and then in the kidney to the active hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) 2The abbreviations used are: 1,25(OH)2D31,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3VDRvitamin D receptorVDREvitamin D response elementRXRretinoid X receptorTSStranscriptional start siteChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationRNA pol IIRNA polymerase IIqPCRquantitative real-time PCRFBSfetal bovine serumRLUrelative light unitsBACbacterial artificial chromosomewtwild typeUTRuntranslated regiongalkgalactokinase3Cchromosome conformation capture assayChIP-chipChIP coupled to tiled microarray hybridizationChIP-seqdeep sequencing ChIPMED1mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription subunit 1SRC-1nuclear receptor coactivator 1NCoRnuclear receptor co-repressor 1SMRTsilencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid-hormone receptors. (1DeLuca H. Zierold C. Nutr. Rev. 1998; 56: 4-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). These conversions are mediated by several cytochrome P450-containing enzymes that include hepatic CYP2R1 and renal mitochondrial CYP27B1 (2Prosser D.E. Jones G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 664-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). The latter is considered the most important enzyme associated with vitamin D3 metabolism, because it catalyzes the final step in the conversion of the parent vitamin to its bioactive form. Perhaps of equal importance is CYP24A1, a mitochondrial enzyme in target cells that functions to degrade 1,25(OH)2D3 (2Prosser D.E. Jones G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 664-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). CYP24A1 facilitates a series of catabolic steps that begins with 24-hydroxylation of 1,25(OH)2D3 and ends in side-chain cleavage of a penultimate metabolic intermediate to produce calcitroic acid. Thus, both the endocrine synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D3 in the kidney and the degradation of this hormone at peripheral sites of action serve to maintain a homeostatic level of biologically active 1,25(OH)2D3. 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 vitamin D receptor vitamin D response element retinoid X receptor transcriptional start site chromatin immunoprecipitation RNA polymerase II quantitative real-time PCR fetal bovine serum relative light units bacterial artificial chromosome wild type untranslated region galactokinase chromosome conformation capture assay ChIP coupled to tiled microarray hybridization deep sequencing ChIP mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription subunit 1 nuclear receptor coactivator 1 nuclear receptor co-repressor 1 silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid-hormone receptors. The maintenance of active levels of hormone is a dynamic process responsive to a multitude of systemic signals that monitor the mineral status of the organism. 1,25(OH)2D3 production in the kidney is regulated positively by many factors, including parathyroid hormone (3Tanaka Y. DeLuca H.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: E168-E173PubMed Google Scholar) and regulated negatively by others (4Zhong Y. Armbrecht H.J. Christakos S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 11059-11069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), including the phosphate hormone FGF23 (5Razzaque M.S. Am. J. Physiol.

CYP27B1 is also down-regulated by 1,25(OH)2D3 itself, which exerts strong negative feedback control on CYP27B1 transcription to curb 1,25(OH)2D3 synthesis (3Tanaka Y. DeLuca H.F. Am. J.

Interestingly, this negative feedback mechanism does not appear to be operable in the many extrarenal tissues that are also known to express CYP27B1, albeit at more modest levels (10Zehnder D. Bland R. Williams M.C. McNinch R.W. Howie A.J. Stewart P.M. Hewison M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 888-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). 1,25(OH)2D3 also regulates its own degradation as well, because the hormone potently induces CYP24A1 expression in all cells in which it acts (2Prosser D.E. Jones G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 664-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Because the magnitude of this induction is generally cell-specific, the regulation of CYP24A1 expression likely represents a mechanism whereby cellular response can be precisely tailored to individual cellular requirements in the face of changing circulating 1,25(OH)2D3 levels. Not surprisingly, reductions in CYP27B1 expression, enhanced synthesis of CYP24A1, or both can lead to a decrease in biologically active 1,25(OH)2D3 levels that results in altered mineral homeostasis and increased disease potential (11St-Arnaud R. Bone. 1999; 25: 127-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In summary, the collective activity of both renal CYP27B1 and target cell CYP24A1 results in the maintenance of highly dynamic steady-state levels of biologically active 1,25(OH)2D3 in all tissues in which the hormonal ligand is active. The cloning of Cyp24a1 in 1993 revealed Cyp24a1 as a bone fide member of a large family composed of all the cytochrome P450 genes (12Ohyama Y. Noshiro M. Eggertsen G. Gotoh O. Kato Y. Björkhem I. Okuda K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Although the cloning of the structural gene provided an entrée into studies of structure/function, the cloning of the chromosomal gene enabled studies focused upon understanding the underlying mechanisms important to the regulation of CYP24A1 expression by 1,25(OH)2D3 and other modulators. 1,25(OH)2D3 is known in general terms to regulate gene transcription via the vitamin D receptor (VDR), a nuclear protein that forms a heterodimer with retinoid X receptor (RXR) at specific DNA sequences termed vitamin D response elements (VDREs) and then participates directly in the recruitment of complex molecular machinery that is essential for changing the level of expression of target genes (13Pike J.W.

Shevde N.K. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2007; 103: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Key to the regulated induction of CYP24A1 by 1,25(OH)2D3 are two VDREs located within an enhancer positioned very near the transcriptional start site (TSS) (15Ohyama Y. Ozono K. Uchida M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1675-1678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The interaction of the VDR with these regulatory elements and the activities of multiple coregulatory complexes at these sites as well has been the focus of extensive analysis since their initial discoveries. Indeed, we have shown using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays that the VDR and its heterodimer partner bind directly to these elements and recruit coregulatory complexes both in cells in culture and in mouse tissues in vivo (17Kim S. Shevde N.K. Pike J.W. J. Bone Miner Res. 2005; 20: 305-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 18Meyer M.B. Zella L.A. Nerenz R.D. Pike J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22344-22352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thus, it is well established that CYP24A1 is regulated in most species through an activation event that is mediated in trans by a VDR/RXR heterodimer and its associated cofactors and facilitated in cis through the two VDREs located near the CYP24A1 proximal promoter. The results of ChIP analysis coupled to either tiled microarray hybridization (ChIP-chip) or deep sequencing techniques (ChIP-seq) now supports the general concept that the expression of numerous genes is regulated by multiple enhancers located not only proximal to the TSS but at sites that are distal as well (19Heintzman N.D. Stuart R.K. Hon G. Fu Y. Ching C.W. Hawkins R.D. Barrera L.O. Van Calcar S. Qu C. Ching K.A. Wang W. Weng Z. Green R.D. Crawford G.E. Ren B. Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (2425) Google Scholar). Indeed, these sites can be located at various positions across an extended gene locus and in many cases are positioned many kilobases from the TSS. While distant in a linear sense, it is worth noting that these enhancers are frequently located in three-dimensional terms immediately adjacent to the promoters that they are known to regulate (20Dekker J.

In the current study, we used ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq approaches as well as BAC clone analysis to examine whether the regulation of CYP24A1 by 1,25(OH)2D3 was mediated exclusively through the two regulatory elements described above or perhaps involved additional elements. We show herein that CYP24A1 regulation in both mouse and human genomes is indeed more complex and that an extensive downstream intergenic cluster comprised of at least four separate regions is also involved. Several of these regions contain one or more VDREs that function to control the expression of CYP24A1. Our results highlight the additional complexity that is likely typical of many highly regulated genes. 1,25(OH)2D3 was obtained from Tetrionics, Inc. (Madison, WI).

Biol. 2006; 26: 6469-6486Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Briefly, MC3T3-E1 or LS180 cells were treated for the appropriate period of time with either vehicle or the indicated experimental inducer. The treated cells were washed several times with phosphate-buffered saline and then cross-linked for 15 min with 1.5% formaldehyde. After the cross-linking reaction, isolated cell extracts were sonicated to prepare chromatin fragments (average DNA size of 500–600 bp DNA as assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis) using a Fisher Model 100 Sonic Dismembranator at a power setting of 1. Pre-cleared samples were subjected to immunoprecipitation using either a control IgG antibody or the indicated experimental antibody. The precipitated DNA was then washed, cross-links were reversed, and the DNA fragments were purified using Qiagen QIAquick PCR Purification Kits (Valencia, CA). The isolated DNA (or DNA acquired prior to precipitation (input)) was subjected to qPCR using primers designed to amplify fragments of the murine or human CYP24A1 gene promoter and/or for ChIP-DNA microarray (ChIP-chip) or ChIP-deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses. Output DNA from ChIP was amplified using a ligation-mediated PCR method (24Oberley M.J. Farnham P.J. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 371: 577-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and then labeled with Cy3 or Cy5. 6 μg of each labeled sample was combined with 2× Hybe Buffer and Hybe component A (Roche NimbleGen), denatured at 95 °C for 5 min, and then hybridized to custom Roche NimbleGen DNA microarrays overnight at 42 °C using a MAUI hybridization system (BioMicro, Salt Lake City, UT). All oligonucleotide sequences for the array were generated using Roche NimbleGen's design standard, Tm-balanced 50–75 oligomers with an approximate spacing of 100–150 bp. Low complexity and repeat regions were excluded from tiling. Following hybridization, arrays were washed and scanned at 5 μm using the GenePix 4000B scanner (Axon/Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Data were extracted using NimbleScan (version 2.4, Roche NimbleGen) and normalized using loess or bi-weight mean normalization in R. The log2 ratios of test versus experimental data were calculated for each point, and peaks were called using CMARRT algorithms (25Kuan P. Chun H. Keleş S. Pac Symp. Biocomput. 2008; : 515-526PubMed Google Scholar). Data shown are representative of at least three or more ChIP-chip analyses performed for each experimental setting and peaks were validated by ChIP qPCR (data not shown). The results of this analysis at the genome-wide level will be reported separately. Output ChIP DNA was analyzed commercially via deep sequencing using a SOLiD Instrument (ABI, Foster City, CA) at Beckman Coulter Genomics (formerly Agencourt Biosciences, Boston, MA). Samples were gel-purified, and all DNA segments below 2 kb were selected for further analyses. 400 ng of each ChIP sample, VDR (vehicle), and VDR (1,25(OH)2D3) was sonicated to 150-bp median fragment size and verified by agarose gel electrophoresis. Libraries were created using the AB SOLiD System 2 Lower Input Fragment Library Preparation protocol (4391587 Rev.C, May, 2008). Samples were verified for integrity, and 50 ng was subjected to sequencing. The resulting 35-bp sequences were mapped to the human hg18 reference genome (UCSC Genome Browser, available on-line). ABI sequence format was extended bioinformatically from 35 bp to the 150-bp median fragment digestion and converted to density files for each chromosomal position. Direct duplicate sequences were removed as artifacts of sequencing as were all adapter sequences. All remaining sequences were merged and counted every 30 bp throughout the genome and listed as density files (tag density) that are observed in Fig. 1C. Peaks of binding were determined using MACS v1.3.5 (26Zhang Y. Liu T. Meyer C.A. Eeckhoute J. Johnson D.S. Bernstein B.E. Nussbaum C. Myers R.M. Brown M. Li W. Liu X.S. Genome Biol. 2008; 9: R137Crossref PubMed Scopus (8696) Google Scholar). The results of this analysis at the genome-wide level will be reported separately. The pCH110-β-galactosidase reporter plasmid and the pcDNA-hVDR vector were previously described (23Kim S. Yamazaki M. Zella L.A. Shevde N.K. Pike J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6469-6486Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). pTK-hCYP24A1 +69, +66, +60, +50, and +41, promoter (Pro), and pTK-mCyp24a1 +42, +39, +37, and +35 were constructed by cloning the appropriate human or mouse CYP24A1 DNA fragments obtained through DNA amplification of BAC or genomic DNA into the pTK-luc vector using BamHI (or HindIII) and SalI restriction sites. Mutations were introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as per the manufacturer's protocol and recommendations. Mutated sequences in the pTK-hCYP24A1 +66 and +50 reporter vectors map to the following genomic locations (assembly hg18): +66 VDRE1 (chr20: 52157600-14), +66 VDRE2 (chr20: 52157954-68), +50 VDRE1 (chr20: 52173578-92), and +50 VDRE2 (chr20: 52173765-79). Mutagenesis primers were designed to change the first three base pairs of one or both VDRE half-sites to the nucleotide sequence TCC. The pIRESluc plasmid was provided by Charles A. O'Brien (University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences), and the pgalk plasmid and appropriate cell lines were provided by NCI, National Institutes of Health (see BAC clone reporters). A series of large-scale human and mouse CYP24A1 luciferase reporter constructs was generated via recombinogenic targeting (27Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Court D.L. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 28Lee E.C. Yu D. Martinez de Velasco J. Tessarollo L. Swing D.A. Court D.L. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Genomics. 2001; 73: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). BAC clone RP11-705A3, containing the human CYP24A1 gene, 43 kb of 5′-flanking region, and 128 kb of 3′-flanking region, and BAC clone RP24-149L9, containing the mouse Cyp24a1 gene, 8 kb of 5′-flanking region, and 117 kb of 3′-flanking region, were obtained from the BACPAC Resource Center (Oakland, CA) and introduced into Escherichia coli strain SW106 cells by electroporation. The integrity of the DNA was verified by restriction enzyme digestion and pulse-field gel electrophoresis. The targeting constructs used to prepare the parental hCYP24A1 wild type (wt) and mCyp24a1 wt were generated by PCR amplification of an IRES-luciferase-TK-neomycin cassette from the pIRESluc plasmid (29Fu Q. Manolagas S.C. O'Brien C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6453-6468Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) using primers that contain 50 bp of homology to the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) and 20 bp of homology to the end of the cassette. The amplified DNA was digested with DpnI, gel-purified, and introduced into SW106 cells harboring the parental BAC clone as described by Lee et al. (28Lee E.C. Yu D. Martinez de Velasco J. Tessarollo L. Swing D.A. Court D.L. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Genomics. 2001; 73: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). Recombinants were selected on LB plates containing kanamycin and chloramphenicol. Colonies were screened for correct targeting using 2 μl of bacterial culture as a template for PCR amplification together with primers that flanked the recombination site. BAC DNA was prepared from the bacterial culture of a positive clone, linearized by NotI digestion, and used for generating stable cell lines (see below). The hCYP24A1 ΔVDREs construct was prepared as a modification of the parental hCYP24A1 wt using the galactokinase (galk) positive/negative selection as described by Warming et al. (30Warming S. Costantino N. Court D.L. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: e36Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). The targeting construct was generated from the pgalk plasmid by PCR amplification of the galk open reading frame using primers that contain 50 bp of homology to the regions flanking the transcriptionally active promoter region of CYP24A1. The amplified DNA was digested with DpnI for 1 h, gel-purified, and introduced into SW106 cells harboring the parental hCYP24A1 wt construct. The recombinants were selected first on M63 minimal media plates containing galactose, leucine, biotin, and chloramphenicol. Several emerging colonies were further selected on MacConkey agar plates to remove Gal− contaminants. Gal+ colonies were selected and cultured for use in the second stage of the recombineering effort. For hCYP24A1 ΔVDREs, the mutated promoter region from pTK hCYP24A1 ΔVDREs was employed as a replacement fragment and used for transformation. Removal of the galk cassette resulted in the seamless mutation of individual VDREs. The recombinants were selected on M63 minimal media plates containing 2-deoxygalactose, leucine, biotin, and chloramphenicol. Colonies were analyzed by restriction enzyme digestion and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. A colony with a digestion pattern matching the parent construct was confirmed by PCR analysis and sequencing. DNA for the hCYP24A1 ΔVDREs construct was prepared, linearized through NotI digestion, and then used to generate stable cell lines (see below). Stable cell lines were prepared as previously described (29Fu Q. Manolagas S.C. O'Brien C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6453-6468Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and by using a Nucleofector electroporator (Lonza, Walkersville, MD). For chemical transfections, MC3T3-E1 cells were seeded into 6-well plates at a concentration of 1.5 × 105 cells/well in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% FBS. Cells were transfected 24 h later with 1–4 μg of BAC-luciferase reporter vector in serum and antibiotic-free medium using Lipofectamine. After transfection, the cells were cultured in medium supplemented with 10% FBS for 24 h. For Nucleofector transfection, cells were grown to 80% confluency in 10-cm dishes and trypsinized, and 1–2 × 106 cells were aliquoted per transfection. 1–4 μg of BAC-luciferase reporter vector was transfected using solution R in program T-20 and plated in 6-cm plates overnight. For both methods, cells were then collected by trypsinization, re-plated into two 10-cm dishes, and subjected to positive selection 24 h later using G418 (200 μg/ml). Colonies emerging from the three plates after 10–14 days were harvested, pooled, and examined. MC3T3-E1 cells were seeded into 24-well plates in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% FBS at a concentration of 5.0 × 104 cells/well and transfected 24 h later with Lipofectamine PLUS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in serum and antibiotic-free medium. Individual wells were cotransfected with 250 ng of a luciferase reporter vector, 50 ng of pCH110-βgal, and 50 ng of pcDNA-hVDR. After transfection, the cells were cultured in medium supplemented with 20% FBS with or without 1,25(OH)2D3. Cells were harvested 24 h after treatment, and the lysates were assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities as previously described (31Yamamoto H. Shevde N.K. Warrier A. Plum L.A. DeLuca H.F. Pike J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31756-31765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity in all cases. The chromosome conformation capture (3C) assay was performed as previously reported with few modifications (22Vakoc C.R.

Briefly, LS180 cells were grown to confluency and treated with 10−7 m 1,25(OH)2D3 for 0, 0.5, 1 or 3 h prior to 3C analysis. Cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min and quenched with 0.125 m glycine. Nuclei were collected and Dounce-homogenized with 20 strokes on ice. The nuclei suspension was divided into two tubes per time point with 5 × 105 cells per sample, washed, and resuspended in NEBuffer 3 (1×, New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). SDS was added to 0.1% final concentration, nuclei were incubated at 65 °C for 10 min, and Triton X-100 was added to 1% final concentration. Digestion was performed with 400 units of BglII (New England Biolabs) overnight at 37 °C. Enzyme was inactivated by addition of 2% final concentration SDS and further incubated at 65 °C for 30 min. Samples were diluted 10-fold (to 8 ml) and incubated with or without T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) for 4 h at 16 °C and an additional 30 min at room temperature. Proteinase K (100 μg) was added, and the samples were incubated overnight at 65 °C. The DNA was purified through two rounds of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) extractions and a final ethanol precipitation. Final DNA was redissolved in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1 mm EDTA) and treated with 1 μg of RNase A (Promega, Madison, WI). As PCR product size control, the BAC clone RP11-705A3 was digested with BglII overnight, then ligated and purified. This contains all possible PCR products from a BglII digestion across the CYP24A1 locus. PCR was performed using Go-Taq Flexi Green Master Mix (Promega) for 32 cycles. Primers were designed on the forward genomic strand in proximity to the BglII cut site. Analysis was performed from each BglII segment located between the distal elements and proximal promoter (data not shown); a subset of these primers is displayed in Fig. 4. 1,25(OH)2D3 is known to regulate the expression of the CYP24A1 gene through two regulatory elements, which are located immediately upstream of the transcriptional start site (15Ohyama Y.

https://openalex.org/W2171872850,"Of the over 400 known exoplanets, there are about 70 planets that transit their central star, a situation that permits the derivation of their basic parameters and facilitates investigations of their atmospheres. Some short-period planets, including the first terrestrial exoplanet (CoRoT-7b), have been discovered using a space mission designed to find smaller and more distant planets than can be seen from the ground. Here we report transit observations of CoRoT-9b, which orbits with a period of 95.274 days on a low eccentricity of 0.11 +/- 0.04 around a solar-like star. Its periastron distance of 0.36 astronomical units is by far the largest of all transiting planets, yielding a 'temperate' photospheric temperature estimated to be between 250 and 430 K. Unlike previously known transiting planets, the present size of CoRoT-9b should not have been affected by tidal heat dissipation processes. Indeed, the planet is found to be well described by standard evolution models with an inferred interior composition consistent with that of Jupiter and Saturn."
https://openalex.org/W2156763911,"Catalysis by protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) occurs through a two-step mechanism involving a phosphocysteine intermediate. We have solved crystal structures for the transition state analogs for both steps. Together with previously reported crystal structures of apo-PTP1B, the Michaelis complex of an inactive mutant, the phosphoenzyme intermediate, and the product complex, a full picture of all catalytic steps can now be depicted. The transition state analog for the first catalytic step comprises a ternary complex between the catalytic cysteine of PTP1B, vanadate, and the peptide DADEYL, a fragment of a physiological substrate. The equatorial vanadate oxygen atoms bind to the P-loop, and the apical positions are occupied by the peptide tyrosine oxygen and by the PTP1B cysteine sulfur atom. The vanadate assumes a trigonal bipyramidal geometry in both transition state analog structures, with very similar apical O–O distances, denoting similar transition states for both phosphoryl transfer steps. Detailed interactions between the flanking peptide and the enzyme are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2059763709,"DNA damage repair and checkpoint responses prevent genome instability and provide a barrier to the development of cancer. Inherited mutations in DNA damage response (DDR) genes such as those that encode the homologous recombination (HR) proteins BRCA1 and BRCA2 cause cancer predisposition syndromes. PARP inhibitors are an exciting new class of targeted therapy for treating patients with HR repair-defective tumors. In this study, we use an RNAi screen to identify genes that when silenced cause synthetic lethality with the PARP inhibitor AZD2281. This screen identified the deubiquitylating enzyme USP11 as a participant in HR repair of DNA double-strand breaks. Silencing USP11 with siRNA leads to spontaneous DDR activation in otherwise undamaged cells and hypersensitivity to PARP inhibition, ionizing radiation, and other genotoxic stress agents. Moreover, we demonstrate that HR repair is defective in USP11-silenced cells. Finally, the recruitment of a subset of double-strand break repair proteins including RAD51 and 53BP1 to repair foci is misregulated in the absence of USP11 catalytic activity. Thus, our synthetic lethal approach identified USP11 as a component of the HR double-strand break repair pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2001007338,"Two important nutrient-sensing and regulatory pathways, the general amino acid control (GAAC) and the target of rapamycin (TOR), participate in the control of yeast growth and metabolism during changes in nutrient availability. Amino acid starvation activates the GAAC through Gcn2p phosphorylation of translation factor eIF2 and preferential translation of GCN4, a transcription activator. TOR senses nitrogen availability and regulates transcription factors such as Gln3p. We used microarray analyses to address the integration of the GAAC and TOR pathways in directing the yeast transcriptome during amino acid starvation and rapamycin treatment. We found that GAAC is a major effector of the TOR pathway, with Gcn4p and Gln3p each inducing a similar number of genes during rapamycin treatment. Although Gcn4p activates a common core of 57 genes, the GAAC directs significant variations in the transcriptome during different stresses. In addition to inducing amino acid biosynthetic genes, Gcn4p in conjunction with Gln3p activates genes required for the assimilation of secondary nitrogen sources such as γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Gcn2p activation upon shifting to secondary nitrogen sources is suggested to occur by means of a dual mechanism. First, Gcn2p is induced by the release of TOR repression through a mechanism involving Sit4p protein phosphatase. Second, this eIF2 kinase is activated by select uncharged tRNAs, which were shown to accumulate during the shift to the GABA medium. This study highlights the mechanisms by which the GAAC and TOR pathways are integrated to recognize changing nitrogen availability and direct the transcriptome for optimal growth adaptation.

Gcn2p phosphorylation of the α-subunit of eIF2 at serine 51 reduces its activity, and the resulting lowered global translation allows cells to conserve resources and provides time to reconfigure the transcriptome to alleviate nutrient stress. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, eIF2α phosphorylation also leads to preferential translation of GCN4 mRNA. Gcn4p is a basic zipper transcriptional activator of genes subject to the GAAC, many of which are involved in amino acid biosynthesis (2Hinnebusch A.G. Annu. Rev.

The TOR signaling pathway is also important for monitoring nutrient availability (10Martin D.E. Hall M.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 158-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Yeast contains two homologous TOR protein kinases, Tor1p and Tor2p, which form two distinct complexes, designated TOR complex 1 (TORC1) and TOR complex 2 (TORC2), both of which have parallels in mammalian cells (11Wullschleger S. Loewith R. Hall M.N. Cell. 2006; 124: 471-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4573) Google Scholar). TORC1 regulates the GATA family of transcription activators such as Gln3p; these transcription activators direct the expression of genes encoding permeases and catabolic enzymes required for the utilization of secondary nitrogen sources (12Magasanik B. Kaiser C.A. Gene. 2002; 290: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Repression of TORC1 in response to changes in nitrogen quality or treatment with the immunosuppressant drug rapamycin leads to Gln3p translocation to the nucleus and the activation of Gln3p target genes. The drug rapamycin has been reported to enhance Gcn2p phosphorylation of eIF2α by a mechanism involving the release of inhibitory phosphorylation of Gcn2p at serine 577 (13Cherkasova V.A. Hinnebusch A.G. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 859-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). TORC1 is thought to facilitate indirectly the inhibitory Gcn2p phosphorylation by a process involving an unknown protein kinase and the type 2A-related protein phosphatase, Sit4p (13Cherkasova V.A. Hinnebusch A.G. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 859-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Rapamycin is suggested to release TORC1 inhibition of Sit4p, allowing for dephosphorylation of Gcn2p. However, the release of TORC1 phosphorylation of Gcn2p has not been found to involve nutrient stresses known to activate the GAAC, including starvation of amino acids such as histidine and deprivation of purine or glucose (13Cherkasova V.A. Hinnebusch A.G. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 859-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). There are many unresolved questions concerning the regulatory linkages between the GAAC and TOR pathways. It is unclear which nutrient stress arrangements actually engage the TORC1/Gcn2p/Gcn4p pathway and whether TOR can function in conjunction with accumulating uncharged tRNAs to regulate Gcn2p. Prior transcriptome studies have suggested distinct patterns of gene expression during 3-aminotriazole (3-AT) and rapamycin treatments, and Gln3p is suggested to function only during rapamycin treatment or in response to changes in the quality of nitrogen in the medium (5Natarajan K.

Do the GAAC and Gcn4p play a major role in the TOR-directed transcriptome, does Gln3p contribute significantly to gene expression during amino acid starvation, and is there significant overlap between the genes regulated by these two transcription factors? In this study we addressed these central questions, highlighting the mechanisms by which the GAAC is integrated with the TOR pathway in yeast to recognize changing nitrogen availability and to direct the transcriptome for optimal growth adaptation. The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in Table 1, and all are derived from EG328-1A (16Hardy T.A. Roach P.J. J. Biol.

Biol. 2000; 20: 2706-2717Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). All other knock-out strains were constructed by PCR-mediated gene replacement, which removes the entire coding region (18Wach A. Yeast. 1996; 12: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). For Kan-marked strains, deletion cassettes were amplified by PCR using genomic DNA from the corresponding deletion mutant in the BY4741 strain background (19Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J.

Cells were cultured in synthetic medium (SD) containing 2% dextrose and 0.5% ammonium sulfate (20Burke D. Dawson D. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 171-174Google Scholar) and supplemented with all amino acids except histidine (SC medium). This culture arrangement ensured that cells were sated for amino acids, allowing for similar growth of strains defective for the GAAC and TOR pathways. Because 3-AT inhibits the synthesis of histidine, we deleted this amino acid from the non-stressed and rapamycin-treated cultures as well. Omission of this amino acid did not alter gene expression as judged by RT-PCR analysis of mRNAs such as HIS4 and GAP1 (data not shown). RT-PCR analysis was conducted using SuperScript One-step RT-PCR with Platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). In experiments that analyzed the role of the GAAC and TOR pathways in nitrogen assimilation, amino acids were omitted, and alternative nitrogen sources (phenylalanine or γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), each at concentrations of 10 mm) were substituted for ammonia in the SD medium as indicated. For some experiments, cells were grown in YPD medium (containing 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose) as indicated (20Burke D. Dawson D. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 171-174Google Scholar). Plasmids p180 and p227 have been described previously (21Mueller P.P. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1986; 45: 201-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The PGCRE-lacZ reporter plasmid was derived from plasmid pME112 (22Albrecht G. Mösch H.U. Hoffmann B. Reusser U. Braus G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12696-12702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, six copies of the GCRE were amplified by PCR and subcloned upstream of a minimal CYC1 promoter in the reporter plasmid p416-CYC1TATA-lacZ. The PGATA-lacZ reporter plasmid contains two copies of a consensus GATA sequence (GATAAG) derived from the GLN1 gene (23Stanbrough M. Rowen D.W. Magasanik B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9450-9454Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The PARO9-lacZ, PUGA3-lacZ, and PUGA1-lacZ reporter plasmids contain the complete upstream noncoding sequences of the ARO9 (−608 to −1), UGA3 (−677 to −1), and UGA1 (−548 to −1) genes, respectively. These DNA segments were subcloned into the XbaI/EcoRI site of pRS416-lacZ. Deletions of the UGA3 promoter (−371, −300, −200, and −103) were constructed by PCR. Site-directed mutagenesis of the minimal UGA3 promoter (−300 to −1) was carried out by PCR with oligonucleotides containing the specific nucleotide changes. The GATA element (CTTATG) at −206 and the GCRE (CGTCGAC) centered at −112 of the UGA3 promoter were changed to AGATCT and CGTCGAC, respectively. The sequences of all amplified regions were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Plasmid p722 encodes wild-type GCN2 and the selectable URA3 gene (24Wek R.C. Ramirez M. Jackson B.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2820-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and p299 includes the mutant version, gcn2-m2, which has Y1199L and R1120L substitutions in the HisRS-related domain of Gcn2p that block binding to uncharged tRNA (25Dong J. Qiu H. Garcia-Barrio M. Anderson J. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 269-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 26Narasimhan J. Staschke K.A. Wek R.C. J. Biol.

Plasmid pYB41 encoding a GCN4-lacZ reporter with a selectable TRP1 gene was described previously (17Yang R. Wek S.A. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2706-2717Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Plasmid p1024 (ADH-GCN4-flag) encodes a constitutive (GCN4c) carboxyl-terminal FLAG-tagged allele of GCN4 subcloned into the XbaI/XhoI site of p416ADH (28Mumberg D. Müller R. Funk M. Gene. 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar). Plasmid p1025 (GCN4-flag) contains the GCN4 ORF encoding a carboxyl-terminal FLAG epitope and upstream regulatory sequences (−1000 to −1) subcloned into the XbaI/XhoI site of pRS416 (29Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transcriptome analysis was carried out using RNA prepared from cells treated for 1 h with 10 mm 3-AT, 200 nm rapamycin, or no stress, in quadruplicate as indicated. The 1-h incubation time was shown to induce maximal expression of HIS4 and GAP1 mRNAs as judged by RT-PCR analysis (data not shown). Four independent cultures of strains WY798 (wild-type) WY799 (gcn2Δ), WY857 (gcn4Δ), WY858 (gln3Δ), WY859 (gcn2Δ gln3Δ), and WY860 (gcn4Δ gln3Δ) were cultured as described, and total RNA was purified using the hot phenol method (30Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). The RNA was labeled using the standard Affymetrix protocol for 3′-IVT arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Labeled cRNA was hybridized for 17 h to yeast genome S98 GeneChips®. Signal values and detection calls were generated using Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.0. Arrays were scaled to a target intensity of 1000, and detection calls were generated using the default parameters. Average signal intensities from four independent experiments for each of the 18 treatment groups were compared by performing a Welch's unpaired t test (31Zar J.H. Biostatistical Analysis. 4th Ed. Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ1999Google Scholar), and false discovery rates (FDR) were calculated according to Benjamini and Hochberg (32Benjamini Y. Hochberg Y. J. R. Stat. Soc. Series B Stat. Methodol. 1995; 57: 289-300Google Scholar). The fold change ratios and p values for each probe set and FDR values for each comparison are listed in supplemental Table S1. Microarray data have been deposited in GEO (gene expression omnibus) (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) under accession number GSE15254. Pearson and Spearman correlations were calculated using GraphPad Prism version 4.03 (San Diego, CA). The mRNA changes for select genes derived from the microarray analyses were confirmed independently by quantitative RT-PCR using SYBR Green. Briefly, cDNA was synthesized using 1 μg of total RNA and 2.5 μm random hexamers in the RT mixture according to the manufacturer's protocol (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Quantitative PCR reactions consisted of 2.5 μl of RT product, 400 nm primers, and 1× SYBR® Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems). Reactions were incubated for one initial cycle at 50 °C for 2 min and 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Primers were designed using PrimerExpress software (Applied Biosystems). The nucleotide sequences of the primers used to quantitate the ARO9, ARO10, and PDC6 genes, as well as those specific to the ACT1 gene used for internal normalization, have been described by Chen and Fink (33Chen H. Fink G.R. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1150-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Gene list comparisons were performed using the compare class utility provided by the Regulatory Sequence Analysis Tools (34van Helden J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3593-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Comparisons were made with previous 3-AT and rapamycin data sets (5Natarajan K. Meyer M.R. Jackson B.M. Slade D.

Science. 2001; 293: 2087-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar) using the web utility Microarray Analysis Tools. Upstream noncoding regulatory sequences were retrieved and analyzed using Regulatory Sequence Analysis Tools (34van Helden J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3593-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The program DNA-Pattern was used to search for and catalogue occurrences of consensus GCRE (TGABTVW) and GATA (GATAAG, GATAAH, GATTA) motifs in yeast promoters. The program oligo-analysis (41van Helden J. André B. Collado-Vides J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 827-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar) was used to search the promoter regions of co-regulated genes for overrepresented sequence motifs. Analysis of the 5′-noncoding regions of the GCN4-dependent activation core identified the consensus GCRE motif (TGABTVW). Yeast cells were cultured as described above, collected by centrifugation, washed with ice-cold water, and resuspended in a solution of 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors (100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.15 μm aprotinin, 1 μm leupeptin, and 1 μm pepstatin), and phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm NaF and 40 mm β-glycerophosphate). Cells were lysed by vortexing with glass beads followed by centrifugation to clarify the lysate. The protein content of the cell lysate was measured using the Bradford method (42Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of each protein sample were separated by electrophoresis in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Immunoblot analyses were carried out using a polyclonal antibody that specifically recognizes phosphorylated eIF2α at Ser-51 (Research Genetics or StressGen) or M2-FLAG epitope tag (Sigma). Total eIF2α levels were measured using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against recombinant yeast eIF2α (17Yang R. Wek S.A. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2706-2717Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Yeast cells expressing lacZ reporter genes were grown to early logarithmic phase in SD or SC medium and treated as indicated. Following incubation at 30 °C, the non-stressed cells were harvested after 4 h, and stressed cells were collected after 6 h, as described previously (17Yang R. Wek S.A. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2706-2717Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 250 μl of breaking solution (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20% glycerol, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and broken by vortexing with glass beads followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g to clarify the lysates. To measure the β-galactosidase activity, 20 μl of extract was added to 980 μl of Z-buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 10 mm KCl, 2 mm Mg2SO4, and 4.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and the reaction was initiated by the addition of a 200-μl solution of o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (4 mg/ml in Z-buffer). The reaction was terminated following a 10–20 min incubation at 30 °C by adding 0.5 ml of 1 m Na2CO3, and the absorbance of the reaction mixture was measured at A420. Specific enzyme activity is represented as nanomoles of o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside hydrolyzed/minute/milligram of total protein. Total protein concentration of the clarified lysate was determined using the Bradford method (42Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). The average β-galactosidase activity ± S.E. from 2–3 independent cultures is presented for each experiment. Student's t test was used to determine statistical significance. Ribosomal profiles were generated using sucrose gradient centrifugation as described previously (26Narasimhan J. Staschke K.A. Wek R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22820-22832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, wild-type or gcn2Δ cells were grown in SD medium containing ammonia as the sole nitrogen source and harvested in mid-logarithmic phase. Alternatively, these cells were shifted from SD to GABA medium, cultured for 1 h, and harvested. Just prior to harvesting, cycloheximide was added to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml to retain polysomes as described (43Ramirez M. Wek R.C. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3027-3036Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Lysate preparation and sucrose gradient analyses were carried out as described previously (43Ramirez M. Wek R.C. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3027-3036Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 44Zhu S. Wek R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1808-1814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In addition to cycloheximide, cells lysate preparations contained 10 mm MgCl2, required for association of ribosomal subunits. Aliquots of 20–25 A260 units were applied to 11.5 ml of 10–50% sucrose gradients and subjected to centrifugation at 40,000 rpm for 2 h in a Beckman SW41 rotor at 4 °C. Yeast cells were grown in SD medium and shifted to synthetic medium containing GABA as the sole nitrogen source for 15 or 60 min as indicated. Cells were collected by centrifugation, and tRNA preparations were prepared and analyzed for tRNA charging genome-wide as described (45Zaborske J.M. Narasimhan J. Jiang L. Wek S.A. Dittmar K.A. Freimoser F. Pan T. Wek R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 25254-25267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This method involves the preparation of RNA from collected cells under mildly acidic conditions, which allow retention of charged tRNAs. The RNA samples were then divided into two equal portions. One part was treated with periodate, which selectively oxidized uncharged tRNA and selectively blocked its subsequent ligation to a fluorophore-labeled oligonucleotide. The second portion was not treated with periodate, which allowed both charged and uncharged portions to be ligated subsequently to the labeled oligonucleotide. Both tRNA preparations were then deacylated using alkaline pH. A fluorescently tagged oligonucleotide containing a stem-loop structure with a portion complementary to the 3′-CCA sequence that is conserved among all tRNAs was ligated onto only those tRNAs"

Here we show that tri-iodothyronine (T3) treatment in mice acutely and specifically induces hepatic expression of the metabolic regulator fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21). Mice treated with T3 showed a dose-dependent increase in hepatic FGF21 expression with significant induction at doses as low as 100 μg/kg. Time course studies determined that induction is seen as early as 4 h after treatment with a further increase in expression at 6 h after injection. As FGF21 expression is downstream of the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), we treated PPARα knock-out mice with T3 and found no increase in expression, indicating that hepatic regulation of FGF21 by T3 in liver is via a PPARα-dependent mechanism. In contrast, in white adipose tissue, FGF21 expression was suppressed by T3 treatment, with other T3 targets unaffected. In cell culture studies with an FGF21 reporter construct, we determined that three transcription factors are required for induction of FGF21 expression: thyroid hormone receptor β (TRβ), retinoid X receptor (RXR), and PPARα. These findings indicate a novel regulatory pathway whereby T3 positively regulates hepatic FGF21 expression, presenting a novel therapeutic target for diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

The human Timeless exists in a tight complex with a smaller protein called Tipin (Timeless-interacting protein). Here we investigated the mechanism by which the Timeless-Tipin complex functions as a mediator in the ATR-Chk1 DNA damage checkpoint pathway. We find that the Timeless-Tipin complex specifically mediates Chk1 phosphorylation by ATR in response to DNA damage and replication stress through interaction of Tipin with the 34-kDa subunit of replication protein A (RPA). The Tipin-RPA interaction stabilizes Timeless-Tipin and Tipin-Claspin complexes on RPA-coated ssDNA and in doing so promotes Claspin-mediated phosphorylation of Chk1 by ATR. Our results therefore indicate that RPA-covered ssDNA not only supports recruitment and activation of ATR but also, through Tipin and Claspin, it plays an important role in the action of ATR on its critical downstream target Chk1.

DNA damage and replication checkpoints are controlled by cellular signal transduction pathways that recognize and respond to alterations in DNA structure by halting or delaying cell cycle progression to allow sufficient time for DNA repair and the completion of DNA replication (1Sancar A.

Oncogene. 2007; 26: 7741-7748Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), ATR is stimulated under a wider array of genome destabilizing conditions, such as during replication fork stalling, nucleotide excision repair, and double-strand break processing and at deprotected telomeres (1Sancar A. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Unsal-Kaçmaz K. Linn S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 39-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar, 4Palm W. de Lange T. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2008; 42: 301-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar, 5Cimprich K.A. Cortez D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 616-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). Because of the variety of genotoxic stressors that activate ATR, it has been suggested that a common DNA structural intermediate may be involved in the initiation or maintenance of the ATR signal transduction pathway (5Cimprich K.A. Cortez D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 616-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar, 6You Z. Kong L. Newport J. J. Biol.

Consistent with this hypothesis, the uncoupling of DNA helicase and polymerase activities at replication forks, resection of DNA ends at double-strand breaks, and removal of bulky DNA adducts by nucleotide excision repair all generate single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) that may become bound by RPA, the major ssDNA-binding protein in eukaryotes (8Fanning E. Klimovich V. Nager A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4126-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 9Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). Through a specific interaction of the 70-kDa subunit of RPA (RPA1) with the ATR-interacting protein ATRIP (7Zou L. Elledge S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2059) Google Scholar, 10Ball H.L. Myers J.S. Cortez D. Mol. Biol.

Biol. 2007; 27: 3367-3377Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), a constitutive binding partner of ATR (12Cortez D. Guntuku S. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1713-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar), RPA is thought to promote the stable association of ATR-ATRIP with sites of DNA damage and replication stress. However, full stimulation of ATR kinase activity requires several additional factors, including the Rad17-replication factor C complex, which loads the PCNA-like 9-1-1 clamp (Rad9-Hus1-Rad1) onto primer-template junctions that are also present at sites of DNA damage and at stalled replication forks (1Sancar A. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Unsal-Kaçmaz K. Linn S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 39-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar). Through an interaction with the C-terminal tail of Rad9, the ATR-activating protein TopBP1 (13Kumagai A. Lee J. Yoo H.Y. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 2006; 124: 943-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar) may then be brought into proximity of ATR where it can stimulate ATR kinase activity (14Delacroix S. Wagner J.M. Kobayashi M. Yamamoto K. Karnitz L.M. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1472-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Although a large number of proteins are potentially phosphorylated by ATR in response to DNA damage (15Matsuoka S. Ballif B.A. Smogorzewska A. McDonald 3rd, E.R. Hurov K.E. Luo J. Bakalarski C.E.

Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 616-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar, 17Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S. DeMayo F. Bradley A. Donehower L.A.

Phosphorylation of two residues (Ser317 and Ser345) in a C-terminal regulatory region of Chk1 activates its kinase activity (17Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S. DeMayo F. Bradley A. Donehower L.A. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 18Zhao H. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4129-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar) and changes its subnuclear localization (19Smits V.A. Reaper P.M. Jackson S.P. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 150-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), enabling the phosphorylation of proteins important for DNA repair and cell cycle progression, such as the Cdc25 family of phosphatases, which directly regulate cyclin-dependent kinase activity to impact cell cycle progression (20Stracker T.H. Usui T. Petrini J.H. DNA Repair. 2009; 8: 1047-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Chk1 therefore plays a critical role in the DNA damage checkpoint response and in promoting genome stability. Its relevance to human health and disease is further highlighted by the recent development of Chk1 inhibitors for clinical use in cancer therapies in combination with traditional chemotherapeutics that induce DNA damage (21Bucher N. Britten C.D. Br. J. Cancer. 2008; 98: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The mechanism of how ATR contacts and phosphorylates Chk1 during the DNA damage response is unclear, although data from a variety of model systems have demonstrated a requirement for the Claspin protein as a mediator of this signaling event (22Chini C.C. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30057-30062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 23Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Serçin O. Choi J.H. Sancar A. J. Biol.

Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), Claspin has been shown in human cells, Xenopus egg extracts, and reconstituted ATR kinase reactions to specifically stimulate the phosphorylation of Chk1 but not the phosphorylation of other ATR substrate proteins (23Lindsey-Boltz L.A.

Importantly, like ATR, Claspin is required for Chk1 phosphorylation and DNA damage checkpoint signaling in response to agents that induce a variety of forms of DNA damage (24Liu S. Bekker-Jensen S. Mailand N. Lukas C. Bartek J. Lukas J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6056-6064Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 28Lin S.Y. Li K. Stewart G.S. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 772-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), indicating that a common mechanism exists for its recruitment and function in ATR-Chk1 signaling at sites of DNA damage and replication stress. We initially reported that the protein Timeless also mediated Chk1 phosphorylation and DNA damage checkpoint responses in human cells exposed to UV irradiation or hydroxyurea (HU), a compound that depletes deoxynucleotide precursors and causes DNA polymerases to stall (30Unsal-Kaçmaz K. Mullen T.E. Kaufmann W.K. Sancar A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3109-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In a series of recent reports, we and others confirmed that both Timeless and its binding partner Tipin (Timeless-interacting protein) (31Gotter A.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) contribute to intra-S and G2/M checkpoint responses to UV, HU, and other agents, including IR (32Unsal-Kaçmaz K. Chastain P.D. Qu P.P. Minoo P. Cordeiro-Stone M. Sancar A. Kaufmann W.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 3131-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 33Tanaka H. Kubota Y. Tsujimura T. Kumano M. Masai H. Takisawa H. Genes Cells. 2009; 14: 949-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 34Yoshizawa-Sugata N. Masai H. J. Biol.

Although these different agents induce a variety of structural changes to DNA, including stalled replication forks, nucleotide excision repair gaps, and double-strand breaks, the observation that the Timeless-Tipin complex contributes to proper checkpoint responses to all of these types of damage indicates that a common mechanism may be involved in Timeless-Tipin function and/or recruitment to sites of DNA damage. Our previous observation that the Timeless-Tipin complex binds to RPA (32Unsal-Kaçmaz K. Chastain P.D. Qu P.P. Minoo P. Cordeiro-Stone M. Sancar A. Kaufmann W.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 3131-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) indicated a possible mechanism for Timeless-Tipin recruitment and function to promote ATR signaling. Here we show that the Timeless-Tipin complex specifically mediates Chk1 phosphorylation by ATR in response to DNA damage and replication stress through an interaction of Tipin with the 34-kDa subunit of RPA (RPA2), which stabilizes both the Timeless-Tipin complex and Claspin on RPA-coated ssDNA. These results therefore indicate that RPA function in ATR checkpoint signaling extends beyond recruitment and activation of ATR and also includes, through Timeless-Tipin and Claspin, a possible mechanism for facilitating Chk1 phosphorylation by ATR at sites of DNA damage. HeLa, HEK293T, and FlpTM-In T-RExTM-293 cells (Invitrogen) were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin. Sf21 and Hi5 cells (Invitrogen) were grown in Grace's insect medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Derivation of stable Flp-InTM T-RExTM-293 cell lines expressing FLAG-tagged Tipin was performed according to the manufacturer's protocols (Invitrogen). Standard immunoblotting procedures were used to detect proteins in cell lysates and in pull-down assays with recombinant proteins. Antibodies against Timeless and Tipin were generously provided by Anthony Gotter and Hisao Masai (34Yoshizawa-Sugata N. Masai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2729-2740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 36Gotter A.L. Suppa C. Emanuel B.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 36-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). A peptide corresponding to an N-terminal fragment of Tipin (CSPERQDGEGTEPDEESG) synthesized by the University of North Carolina Protein Sequence and Peptide Synthesis Facility was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin by Covance and used to generate an additional rabbit anti-Tipin antibody used in this work. ATR (N-19), Claspin (H-300), Chk1 (G-4), Chk2 (H-300), RPA1 (B-6), and XPB (S-19) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz. RPA1 and RPA2 antibodies were obtained from Calbiochem. Phospho-RPA2 (Ser33) and phospho-MCM2 (Ser108) antibodies were from Bethyl Laboratories. Anti-FLAG and anti-His antibodies were from Sigma and Abgent, respectively. ORC2 and MEK2 antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences. ATRIP antibody was obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. Phospho-Chk1 (Ser345) antibody was from Cell Signaling Technology. Plasmids used in this work can be obtained from Addgene. pcDNA3-FLAG-Tipin, pcDNA4-FLAG-Timeless, and pcDNA3-FLAG-RPA2 were described previously (30Unsal-Kaçmaz K. Mullen T.E. Kaufmann W.K. Sancar A.

Vectors encoding FLAG-Tipin mutants (E185A, E190A, and L195A) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and were cloned in pcDNA3. To generate siRNA-resistant forms of Tipin, the region of Tipin targeted by Dharmacon siRNA catalog number J-020843 (5′-AGAGGACTTCCAGCCTTA-3′) was changed to 5′-AGGGGCCTGCCGGCGTTG-3′ by site-directed mutagenesis in the pcDNA3 vector. FLAG-Tipin (WT and L195A) sequences were also subcloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pcDNA5/FRT/TO. To generate pFastBac1-FLAG-Timeless, pFastBacHTb-His-FLAG-Timeless (32Unsal-Kaçmaz K.

To generate pFastBac1-His-Tipin (L195A), pcDNA3-FLAG-Tipin (L195A) was used as template in a PCR with previously described primers (32Unsal-Kaçmaz K. Chastain P.D. Qu P.P. Minoo P. Cordeiro-Stone M. Sancar A. Kaufmann W.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 3131-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and cloned into the XbaI and KpnI sites of pFastBac1. Tipin (WT and L195A) sequences were also cloned into the NdeI and XhoI sites of pET21b by PCR using pcDNA3-FLAG-Tipin (WT or L195A) as a template and the PCR primers 5′-GAAGCTAGAGCACTCGAGCACTGA-3′ and 5′-TCAGTGCTCGAGTGCTCTAGCTTC-3′. RPA and aRPA were purified from Escherichia coli as described previously (38Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol.

Baculoviruses used to express and purify proteins from insect cells (Sf21 or Hi5 cells; Invitrogen) were either previously reported (30Unsal-Kaçmaz K. Mullen T.E. Kaufmann W.K. Sancar A. Mol. Cell.

His-FLAG-Tipin and the FLAG-Timeless/His-Tipin heterodimer were purified from baculovirus-infected Sf21 cells as previously described (32Unsal-Kaçmaz K. Chastain P.D. Qu P.P. Minoo P. Cordeiro-Stone M. Sancar A. Kaufmann W.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 3131-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). His-tagged forms of Tipin (WT and L195A) were also purified from E. coli (BL21-Codon Plus (DE3)-RIPL) using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). DNA and siRNA transfections in HeLa cells and Flp-InTM T-RExTM-293 cells employed Lipofectamine 2000 or Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) using protocols provided by the manufacturer. HEK293T cells were transfected with calcium phosphate. The Timeless and Tipin siRNAs were previously described (30Unsal-Kaçmaz K. Mullen T.E. Kaufmann W.K. Sancar A. Mol. Cell.

An 80-mer biotinylated ssDNA (37Unsal-Kaçmaz K. Sancar A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1292-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) was immobilized on streptavidin-coupled Dynabeads (M-280) as recommended by the manufacturer (Dynal), typically at 1 pmol of DNA/μl of magnetic beads. Standard reactions involved incubation of the indicated proteins in 50 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.01% Nonidet P-40) for 30 min at room temperature before collecting the beads on a magnet and washing three times with 200 μl of binding buffer. Preincubation of the ssDNA with RPA was for 20–30 min before washing and addition of the other indicated proteins. The bound proteins were eluted and boiled in 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 1% SDS, 5% glycerol, 0.005% bromphenol blue), separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitations were performed with anti-FLAG-agarose (Sigma). For immunoprecipitation reactions employing purified proteins, the indicated proteins were incubated in binding buffer containing anti-FLAG-agarose for at least 5 h and then washed three times with 500 μl of binding buffer. Bound proteins were eluted in either binding buffer containing 200 μg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma) or 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Immunoprecipitations from cell extracts involved incubation of cell lysates with anti-FLAG-agarose overnight, washes with Tris-buffered saline, and elution with FLAG peptide or 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Subcellular fractionation of mammalian cells to enrich for chromatin-bound proteins was performed essentially as described (41Méndez J. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8602-8612Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar), with the addition of 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and a 1:200 dilution (v/v) of protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) to all buffers. Cytosolic and nuclear extracts were also prepared from human cell lines, essentially as described (42Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar).

We therefore used RNA interference to reduce Timeless-Tipin protein levels in HeLa cells and then examined the phosphorylation status of the ATR targets Chk1, Claspin, RPA2, and MCM2, because these proteins undergo rapid, ATR-dependent phosphorylation after HU treatment and are bona fide components of the intra-S phase checkpoint (17Liu Q.

Importantly, the observation that total Chk1 protein levels remained unchanged under these conditions showed that this reduced Chk1 phosphorylation was not due to altered Chk1 stability, because phosphorylation of Chk1 on this residue can trigger its proteosomal degradation (47Zhang Y.W.

We also noticed that Claspin failed to undergo a characteristic ATR-dependent mobility shift after HU treatment in cells depleted of Timeless-Tipin. Because Claspin fails to stably associate with replication forks in the absence of Timeless-Tipin (33Tanaka H. Kubota Y. Tsujimura T. Kumano M. Masai H. Takisawa H.

In contrast, no significant defect was observed on the phosphorylation status of Ser33 of RPA2, a site that is rapidly phosphorylated by ATR after HU treatment and that is important in regulating RPA function in the intra-S phase checkpoint response (44Olson E.

Oxidative stress-related parameters and the expressions of specific genes were monitored in 102 cases of AML during a pretreatment period from a primary status to a relapse status. In addition, age-matched healthy subjects were classified as controls. The activities of adenosine deaminase and xanthine oxidase were higher in the relapse condition, whereas those of glutathione peroxidase, monoamine oxidase, and superoxide dismutase, and the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) were lower in the primary condition and in controls. Of particular note, levels of advanced oxidation protein products, malondialdehyde, and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine were also significantly higher in relapse patients. Furthermore, real-time PCR with SYBR Green revealed that the expression levels of human thioredoxin (TRX) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase were increased in relapse patients. Pearson correlation analysis revealed that the T-AOC was positively correlated with GSH but negatively correlated with 8-OHdG, TRX, and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase. Linear regression showed that a low T-AOC and up-regulated TRX expression were the independent factors correlated with relapse. A strong association between oxidative stress and the incidence of disease relapse was observed, which has potential prognosis implications. These results indicate that oxidative stress is a crucial feature of AML and probably affects the development and relapse of AML.

These results indicate that oxidative stress is a crucial feature of AML and probably affects the development and relapse of AML. Oxidative stress is generally defined as an imbalance between the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 2The abbreviations used are: ROSreactive oxygen species8-OHdG8-hydroxydeoxyguanosineAMLacute myeloid leukemiaAOPPadvanced oxidation protein productsGSH-Pxglutathione peroxidaseIDOindoleamine 2,3-dioxygenaseMAOmonoamine oxidaseMDAmalondialdehydeSODsuperoxide dismutaseT-AOCtotal antioxidant capacityTRXthioredoxin. and impaired antioxidant defense systems. It has long been known to be involved in the pathophysiology of cancer (1Valko M. Rhodes C.J. Moncol J. Izakovic M. Mazur M. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2006; 160: 1-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4793) Google Scholar). ROS produced either endogenously or exogenously can attack lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids simultaneously in living cells. This has led to cells developing various antioxidant defense mechanisms to both prevent the excessive formation of ROS and limit their harmful effects (2Jones D.P. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2008; 295: C849-C868Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). The appropriate redox balance is maintained via the combined action of antioxidant enzymes, among which particularly important roles are played by superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH) peroxidase (GSH-Px), and monoamine oxidase (MAO). reactive oxygen species 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine acute myeloid leukemia advanced oxidation protein products glutathione peroxidase indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase monoamine oxidase malondialdehyde superoxide dismutase total antioxidant capacity thioredoxin. An impaired antioxidant defense system is widely regarded as a cause of oxidative damage accumulation in cells. Various markers of oxidative damage have been identified. Malondialdehyde (MDA), which is one of the most popular markers, was designed to indicate lipid peroxidation (3Shanmugam N. Figarola J.L. Li Y. Swiderski P.M. Rahbar S. Natarajan R. Diabetes. 2008; 57: 879-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Oxidation of amino acid residues such as tyrosine, leading to the formation of dityrosine, protein aggregation, cross-linking, and fragmentation is one type of ROS-mediated protein damage. Proteins that are exquisitely vulnerable to ROS in vivo have been designated as advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) (4Selmeci L. Seres L. Soós P. Székely M. Acsády G. Acta Physiol. Hung. 2008; 95: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Measurement of AOPP is especially recommended for monitoring critically ill and cancer patients (5Selmeci L. Seres L. Antal M.

Clin Oncol. 2009; 135: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). There are few markers of DNA oxidation in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. However, in recent years 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) has emerged as a marker of oxidative damage in the pathophysiological processes of cancer (7Valko M. Izakovic M. Mazur M. Rhodes C.J. Telser J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 266: 37-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar, 8Wei Y.C. Zhou F.L. He D.L. Bai J.R. Ding H. Wang X.Y. Nan K.J. Int. J.

Thioredoxin (TRX) is a 12-kDa thiol reductase that plays an important role in cell proliferation and cancer. As a scavenger of ROS, it can protect against various forms of cellular stress that can cause cell death. TRX functions as an antiapoptosis or cell death factor by inhibiting apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1, a critical factor in stress-induced cell death, as well as by neutralizing ROS. The TRX system reportedly plays a dominant role in many physiological processes and is also a cell antioxidant (9Koháryová M. Kolárová M. Gen. Physiol. Biophys. 2008; 27: 71-84PubMed Google Scholar). Lu et al. (10Lu J. Chew E.H. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 12288-12293Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) recently found that blocking cancer cell DNA replication and repair and inducing oxidative stress by inhibiting both the TRX and GSH systems is an effective cancer chemotherapeutic strategy. Nigro et al. (11Nigro P. Dal Piaz F. Gallotta D. De Tommasi N. Belisario M.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2008; 45: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the TRX system is inhibited by 13-hydroxy-15-oxo-zoapatlin, a norkaurane diterpene that was previously shown to possess proapoptotic potential and cause cell-cycle arrest in leukemia cells. The enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is one of the numerous mediators contributing to tumors not being affected by the applicable immune response of the host, and has recently attracted special attention. IDO converts tryptophan (Trp) into kynurenine (Kyn), blocking T-cell activation and inducing immunosuppression. There is mounting evidence that, within the tumor microenvironment, not only tumor cells but also other infiltrating cells such as dendritic cells and monocytes can be sources of IDO (12Zamanakou M. Germenis A.E. Karanikas V. Immunol. Lett. 2007; 111: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Blasts of patients with AML were recently shown to express IDO. The serum Kyn/Trp ratio was found to be elevated in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), suggesting higher IDO activity than in healthy subjects. Moreover, patients with higher Kyn/Trp ratios or high IDO expression exhibited significantly shortened overall and relapse-free survival rates (13Chamuleau M.E. van de Loosdrecht A.A. Hess C.J.

Biggio V. Lhermitte M. Dupont C. Briche I. Quesnel B. Leuk. Res. 2009; 33: 490-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). AML is a malignant neoplasm that is characterized by the clonal proliferation of blood cells within the bone marrow. The dismal survival rates of AML indicate the need for more effective treatment therapies for this condition (15Smits E.L. Berneman Z.N. Van Tendeloo V.F. Oncologist. 2009; 14: 240-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 16Marbello L. Ricci F. Nosari A.M. Turrini M. Nador G. Nichelatti M. Tedeschi A. Vismara E. Morra E. Leuk. Res. 2008; 32: 1221-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The cellular and molecular events underlying AML include DNA damage, increased proliferation, deficient cell death, and further genetic instability. There is increasing evidence that the ROS-induced generation of oxidative stress plays a role in leukemia in this multistage process, and interesting results have been reported (17Zhou F. Zhang W. Wei Y. Zhou D. Su Z. Meng X. Hui L. Tian W. Leuk. Res. 2007; 31: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 18Austin C. Leuk.

Clin. Biochem. 2008; 41: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, few studies have explicitly examined the biochemical involvement of oxidative stress in the relapse of AML. The present study examined the roles of antioxidant enzyme activities, changes in oxidative damage, and expression of specific genes in the relapse of AML. All of the patients gave their informed consent to participate (according to the Declaration of Helsinki) after having been fully informed about the purpose of the study between May 2004 and November 2009. They were diagnosed with AML using standard clinical and surface marker criteria at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University. Patients with known confusion or who were judged too ill to participate were excluded from the investigation. None of the patients had central nervous system disease, uncontrolled infections, or other malignancies. They were also free of smoking, inflammatory conditions, endocrine dysfunctions, and pathological antecedents. Heparinized blood samples were obtained from 102 patients with AML during a pretreatment period from a primary status to a relapse status. The control subjects comprised 102 age-matched healthy subjects. The investigators at our research laboratory were blinded to the biologic samples. This study was approved by the Xi'an Jiaotong University Ethics and Scientific Committee, and met international standards for patient confidentiality. The pretreatment blood samples were all collected at 8:00 a.m. to avoid diurnal variations in blood components. These blood samples were centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min to extract plasma. The total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and the activities of SOD, GSH-Px, adenosine deaminase, and xanthine oxidase were measured by chemical colorimetry, and MAO activity was tested by ultraviolet colorimetry. MDA levels were estimated by the thiobarbituric acid reactivity assay. These plasma parameters were assayed using commercially available kits according to the manufacturer's protocol (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute). Plasma (200 ml) diluted 1:5 in phosphate-buffered saline was placed into a 96-well microtiter plate, and 20 ml of acetic acid was added. In standard wells, 10 ml of 1.16 m potassium iodide (Sigma) was added to 200 ml of chloramine T (Sigma) solution (0–100 mm), followed by 20 ml of acetic acid. The absorbance of the reaction mixture was read immediately at 340 nm on a microplate reader against a blank containing 200 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, 10 ml of potassium iodide, and 20 ml of acetic acid. Finally, AOPP levels were measured by spectrophotometry and calibrated against chloramine T solutions, which absorb at 340 nm in the presence of potassium iodide (20Boulanger E. Moranne O.

Descamps-Latscha B. J. Clin. Lab. Anal. 1992; 6: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We collected plasma obtained from whole blood by centrifuging at 2700 × g for 10 min, and then added 50 μl (in duplicate) of each prepared 8-OHdG standard, zero standard, or diluted samples, and 50 μl of monoclonal antibody to precoated wells. The wells were then covered with an adhesive plate sealer and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Following the sixth aspiration using an automated microplate washer (Bio-Rad), 100 μl of horseradish peroxidase conjugate was added to each well (except the blank), and the plate was then incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Unbound enzyme-labeled secondary antibody was removed by a second washing step. After the addition of 100 μl of tetramethylbenzidine substrate for 15 min in the dark, the color reaction was terminated by adding Stop Solution 2. The 8-OHdG absorbance was measured at 450 nm by a high-throughput universal microplate reader (BMG Labtechnologies). Plasma 8-OHdG levels were assayed quantitatively using a StressXpress DNA damage enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Stressgen Bioreagents). Total RNA was extracted from 50 to 100 mg of tissue samples in 1 ml of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and purified using an RNeasy MinElute kit (Qiagen). Cellular RNA was primed with a dT oligonucleotide and reverse transcribed with Superscript II (Promega). The cDNAs thus obtained were tested for integrity by amplification of β-actin transcripts in a 30-cycle PCR. Standard curves were constructed using the mean cycle threshold (CT) value and various concentrations of TRX (ranging from 10−7 to 10−1), resulting in a linear relationship between CT and the logarithm of input DNA. The primers 5′-CCTTCCTGGGCATGGAGTCCTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGAGCAATGATCTTGATCTTC-3′ (reverse) were used to amplify a 205-bp fragment of β-actin, primers 5′-TGACGCCTGTGTGAAAGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AATCAGTGCCTCCAGTTCC-3′ (reverse) were used to amplify a 155-bp fragment of IDO, and primers 5′-TTGGACGCTGCAGGTGATAAAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGCATGCATTTGACTTCACACTC-3′ (reverse) were used to amplify a 182-bp fragment of TRX. A total of 20 μl of the reaction sample consisted of 2 μl of cDNA, 10 μl of SYBR Premix Ex TaqII (Takara Bio), 0.4 μl of ROX Reference Dye, 0.8 μl of each primer at 10 μm (Takara Bio), and 6 μl of double-distilled H2O (Takara Bio). Real-time PCRs were monitored using an ABI GeneAmp 7000 device (Applied Biosystems). Reaction conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 20 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s, 55 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 31 s. PCRs were performed in triplicate, and the reproducibility of the SYBR Green real-time PCR was assessed by running samples independently on different days. Variables were analyzed by descriptive statistics to evaluate the clinical characteristics of the cases. All data are reported as mean ± S.D., and were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance to estimate the presence of any statistical differences between the studied samples. Pearson correlations were adopted to note the correlation. Finally, important variables were analyzed by linear regression to identify any independent predictive factors that were correlated with relapse. Two-tailed probability values are listed in the tables, and the level of statistical significance was set at p ≤ 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 13.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Investigations were carried out on 102 patients (58 males, 44 females) suffering from different types of leukemia: M1, myeloblastic leukemia (n = 6); M2, myeloblastic leukemia (n = 29); M3, promyelocytic leukemia (n = 5); M4, myelomonocytic leukemia (n = 20); M5, monocytic leukemia (n = 40); and M7, acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (n = 2). All patients met the recruitment criteria and were aged 38.65 ± 21.21 years (range 17–73 years). When in the primary condition, patients were categorized into group A; on relapse they were recategorized into group B. In addition, they were age matched with 102 healthy subjects, who were classified into group C (control). The levels of oxidative stress were significantly higher in groups A and B than in group C. The T-AOC and concentrations of GSH-Px, SOD, and MAO were lower and the concentrations of AOPP, MDA, and 8-OHdG were higher in group B (p < 0.05). The findings are summarized in Table 1. A particularly significant finding was that the T-AOC decreased significantly, reaching half its initial level at relapse. The mean plasma levels of AOPP and MDA were significantly higher from the initial stage to the relapse stage than in controls.TABLE 1Comparison of plasma parameters in groups A, B, and CItemGroupMean ± S.D.FPAdenosine deaminaseAap < 0.05, group A versus group C.35.60 ± 17.244.030.01Bbp < 0.05, group B versus group C.38.11 ± 18.05C5.45 ± 7.50Xanthine oxidaseAap < 0.05, group A versus group C.,cp < 0.05, group A versus group B.8.80 ± 1.467.250.001Bbp < 0.05, group B versus group C.,cp < 0.05, group A versus group B.12.98 ± 2.23C5.82 ± 1.35GSHAap < 0.05, group A versus group C.93.68 ± 8.320.590.65Bbp < 0.05, group B versus group C.92.12 ± 24.51C373.86 ± 169.79T-AOCAap < 0.05, group A versus group C.,cp < 0.05, group A versus group B.7.18 ± 2.469.290.00Bbp < 0.05, group B versus group C.,cp < 0.05, group A versus group B.5.47 ± 2.16C15.68 ± 6.05MAOAcp < 0.05, group A versus group B.80.54 ± 26.731.260.36Bbp < 0.05, group B versus group C.37.87 ± 53.55C85.44 ± 35.49SODA67.80 ± 19.230.370.77B60.72 ± 29.72C79.34 ± 21.07A-OPPA20.36 ± 6.863.630.08Bbp < 0.05, group B versus group C.27.82 ± 8.91C15.59 ± 7.51MDAA10.23 ± 7.823.140.04B11.27 ± 5.15C6.52 ± 4.878-OHdGAap < 0.05, group A versus group C.115.14 ± 40.194.020.01Bbp < 0.05, group B versus group C.135.20 ± 41.01C61.81 ± 31.05a p < 0.05, group A versus group C.b p < 0.05, group B versus group C.c p < 0.05, group A versus group B. Open table in a new tab The baseline threshold and CT values were calculated automatically, and the concentration of mRNA was determined by fluorescence detection. Moreover, the expressions of TRX and IDO mRNAs were obtained relative to that of β-actin. The mean TRX/β-actin and IDO/β-actin ratios were 2.82 × 102 and 2.96 × 102, respectively, for primary patients with AML in group A, 7.08 × 102 and 3.35 × 102 for relapse patients in group B, and 1.19 and 0.93 for healthy donors in group C. In addition, the expression levels of TRX mRNA differed significantly among the three groups (Fig. 1). The application of Pearson correlation analysis to multiple variables of the 102 cases revealed that the T-AOC was positively correlated with GSH but negatively correlated with 8-OHdG, TRX, and IDO. Moreover, TRX was positively correlated with IDO.

Disturbances to oxidative stress metabolism are commonly associated with tumor cells, and the level of oxidative stress among patients increases with disease severity and the accumulation of chromosomal aberrations (22Voso M.T.

Although most patients achieve complete remission after chemotherapy, most of them suffer a subsequent leukemia relapse, which is associated with poor long term survival. However, empirical data involving oxidative stress in patients with AML are scarce in the scientific literature, and the complex mechanisms underlying relapse are unclear. Many experimental and clinical studies have indicated that free radicals are involved in the biochemical mechanisms that underlie hematologic disorders (14Corm S. Berthon C. Imbenotte M. Biggio V.

Mazor et al. (29Mazor D. Abucoider A. Meyerstein N. Kapelushnik J. Pediatr. Blood Cancer. 2008; 51: 613-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) concluded that children with acute lymphocytic leukemia had an impaired plasma antioxidant status. Our investigation revealed alterations of antioxidant enzymes in the plasma of patients with AML. The activities of adenosine deaminase and xanthine oxidase were higher in the relapse condition, whereas the T-AOC and the activities of GSH-Px, MAO, and SOD were lower in the primary and control conditions. The impaired plasma antioxidant status in AML is likely to be associated with increased ROS, as indicated by the decrease in antioxidant activity. Thus, oxidative stress is now recognized as a prominent feature of AML relapse. The accumulation of ROS in cells damages the resident proteins, lipids, and DNA. AOPP are a characteristic of some diseases and may reflect the stage of the disease (6Chandramathi S. Suresh K. Anita Z.B. Kuppusamy U.R. J. Cancer Res.

Chang et al. (34Chang D. Wang F. Zhao Y.S. Pan H.Z. Biomed. Environ. Sci. 2008; 21: 286-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) found that serum 8-OHdG, protein carbonyl, and AOPP levels were significantly higher in their colorectal cancer group than in their control group, whereas the activities of antioxidative enzymes were significantly decreased. The findings of our study demonstrate that mean plasma levels of MDA (the lipid peroxidation product) are significantly higher at the relapse stage of AML. Similarly, AOPP levels increase progressively with the evolution of the disease. Importantly, these findings indicate a possible link between decreased levels of antioxidants and increased levels of cell alterations due to oxidative damage, supporting the idea that oxidative stress persists in relapsing AML patients, especially for the M2 and M5 types of leukemia due to their high percentages. DNA damage, which triggers tumor initiation, can result in cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and the destabilization and destruction of the cellular genome. In recent years the biomarker 8-OHdG has become pivotal for measuring the effect of endogenous oxidative damage to DNA and as a factor influencing the initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis (35Hwang E.S. Kim G.H. Toxicology. 2007; 229: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 36Valavanidis A. Vlachogianni T. Fiotakis C. J. Environ. Sci. Health Part C Environ. Carcinog. Ecotoxicol.

Furthermore, the results of clinical studies have suggested that treatment with drugs can protect cells against oxidative damage by enhancing the cellular antioxidant activity and modulating cellular signal pathways (37Liu Y.

The pretherapy levels of urinary 8-OHdG were found to be higher in patients with lymphoma, acute leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome than in normal controls (39Yang Y. Tian Y. Yan C. Jin X. Tang J. Shen X. Environ. Toxicol. 2009; 24: 446-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 40Honda M. Yamada Y. Tomonaga M. Ichinose H. Kamihira S. Leuk. Res. 2000; 24: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In our study, plasma 8-OHdG was also significantly increased from the initial condition to the relapse condition, suggesting that oxidative damage was clearly aggravated after relapse. We also plan to further test if novel mechanisms underlie a causal link between oxidative damage and AML relapse. An excessive production of ROS not only affects major cellular components including lipids, proteins, and DNA, but also influences the gene expression profile (41Rodrigues M.S. Reddy M.M. Sattler M. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2008; 10: 1813-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The complexity of the environment and the interindividual variability in cancer susceptibility makes it necessary to perform genetic studies aimed at explaining the physiopathology of relapse. The mammalian TRX system, which comprises TRX, TRX reductase, and NADPH, is the most important thiol system involved in the redox control of signaling and regulatory proteins in apoptosis and cell proliferation. TRX is a redox active protein that regulates the activities of various enzymes, including those that function to counteract oxidative stress within the cell. TRX can also scavenge ROS and directly inhibit proapoptotic proteins (42Tonissen K.F. Di Trapani G. Mol. Nutr. Food Res. 2009; 53: 87-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 43Rao A.K.

Human TRX is a putative oncogene that may confer both growth and survival advantages to leukemia cells (10Lu J. Chew E.H. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Furthermore, there is evidence emerging that IDO promotes tumor immune escape by inducing an immunoregulatory or an anergic T-cell phenotype at the systemic level (12Zamanakou M. Germenis A.E. Karanikas V. Immunol. Lett. 2007; 111: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). IDO may inhibit T-cell immune responses via down-regulation of Vav1 protein expression and activation (48Li R. Wei F. Yu J. Li H. Ren X. Hao X. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2009; 8: 1402-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Preclinical studies are developing the IDO inhibitor 1-methyltryptophan to block host-mediated immunosuppression and enhance antitumor immunity in the setting of combined chemoimmunotherapy regimens (47Hou D.Y. Muller A.J. Sharma M.D. DuHadaway J. Banerjee T. Johnson M. Mellor A.L. Prendergast G.C. Munn D.H. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 792-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). We sought to understand the pathophysiological effects of AML relapse by examining group differences in specific genes. Our results confirm the presence of a strong correlation between an elevated TRX concentration and the presence of IDO. Moreover, TRX expression tended to increase in the presence of aggressive tumor growth and was significantly correlated with a shorter relapse interval. More importantly, we propose that lower T-AOC and up-regulated TRX are clinically useful parameters for predicting the relapse of acute leukemia, which can be objectively measured and evaluated. However, due to the limited number of cases examined herein, more studies are required to confirm the results. In conclusion, relapse of AML is a neoplastic condition that is susceptible to alterations in antioxidant defense, oxidative damage, and essential gene alterations. Moreover, the correlation between oxidative stress and the rate of AML relapse is of potential prognostic significance. Our current analysis of oxidative stress is likely to provide insight into the biology of AML and new potential therapeutic targets, which may produce continuous improvement in the relapse rate of acute leukemia.

https://openalex.org/W2003304734,"More than 40 quasars have been discovered at redshifts of z ≈ 6, at an epoch when the Universe was less than a billion years old or just 7% of its current age. Surprisingly, the properties of these distant quasars seem almost indistinguishable from those at lower redshifts, suggesting that they are evolved objects. Now with the discovery of a second z ≈ 6 quasar without hot-dust emission, and evidence from others that hot dust accumulates in tandem with the growth of the central black hole, comes confirmation that these extremely distant quasars are indeed less evolved than their lower-redshift equivalents. The two dust-free quasars may be first-generation quasars born in dust-free environments that are too young to have formed a detectable amount of hot dust around them. The most distant quasars known, at redshifts z ≈ 6, generally have the same properties as lower-redshift quasars, implying that although the Universe was young at z ≈ 6, such quasars are still evolved objects. One z ≈ 6 quasar was shown to have no detectable emission from hot dust, but it was not clear whether it was an outlier. Now, a second quasar without hot-dust emission has been discovered in a sample of 21 z ≈ 6 quasars. Moreover, hot-dust abundance in these quasars builds up as the central black hole grows. The most distant quasars known, at redshifts z ≈ 6, generally have properties indistinguishable from those of lower-redshift quasars in the rest-frame ultraviolet/optical and X-ray bands1,2,3. This puzzling result suggests that these distant quasars are evolved objects even though the Universe was only seven per cent of its current age at these redshifts. Recently one z ≈ 6 quasar was shown not to have any detectable emission from hot dust4, but it was unclear whether that indicated different hot-dust properties at high redshift or if it is simply an outlier. Here we report the discovery of a second quasar without hot-dust emission in a sample of 21 z ≈ 6 quasars. Such apparently hot-dust-free quasars have no counterparts at low redshift. Moreover, we demonstrate that the hot-dust abundance in the 21 quasars builds up in tandem with the growth of the central black hole, whereas at low redshift it is almost independent of the black hole mass. Thus z ≈ 6 quasars are indeed at an early evolutionary stage, with rapid mass accretion and dust formation. The two hot-dust-free quasars are likely to be first-generation quasars born in dust-free environments and are too young to have formed a detectable amount of hot dust around them."
https://openalex.org/W2052007733,"We report the presence of oligosaccharide structures on a glutamine residue present in the VL domain sequence of a recombinant human IgG2 molecule. Residue Gln-106, present in the QGT sequence following the rule of an asparagine-linked consensus motif, was modified with biantennary fucosylated oligosaccharide structures. In addition to the glycosylated glutamine, analysis of a lectin-enriched antibody population showed that 4 asparagine residues: heavy chain Asn-162, Asn-360, and light chain Asn-164, both of which are present in the IgG1 and IgG2 constant domain sequences, and Asn-35, which was present in CDRL1, were also modified with oligosaccharide structures at low levels. The primary sequences around these modified residues do not adhere to the N-linked consensus sequon, NX(S/T). Modeling of these residues from known antibody crystal structures and sequence homology comparison indicates that non-consensus glycosylation occurs on Asn residues in the context of a reverse consensus motif (S/T)XN located on highly flexile turns within 3 residues of a conformational change. Taken together our results indicate that protein glycosylation is governed by more diversified requirements than previously appreciated."
https://openalex.org/W2120353086,"Deletion of PHE508 (DeltaF508) from the first nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1) of CFTR, which causes most cystic fibrosis, disrupts the folding and assembly of the protein. Although the folding pathways and yield of isolated NBD1 are altered, its global structure is not, and details of the changes in the rest of the protein remain unclear. To gain further insight into how the whole mutant protein is altered, we have determined the influence of known second-site suppressor mutations in NBD1 on the conformation of this domain and key interfaces between domains. We found that the suppressors restored maturation of only those processing mutations located in NBD1, but not in other domains, including those in the C-terminal cytoplasmic loop of the second membrane-spanning domain, which forms an interface with the NBD1 surface. Nevertheless, the suppressors promoted the formation of this interface and others in the absence of F508. The suppressors restored maturation in a DeltaF508 construct from which NBD2 was absent but to a lesser extent than in the full-length, indicating that DeltaF508 disrupts interactions involving NBD2, as well as other domains. Rescue of DeltaF508-CFTR by suppressors required the biosynthesis of the entire full-length protein in continuity, as it did not occur when N- and C-terminal ""halves"" were coexpressed. Simultaneous with these interdomain perturbations, DeltaF508 resulted in suppressor reversed alterations in accessibility of residues both in the F508-containing NBD1 surface loop and in the Q loop within the domain core. Thus, in the context of the full-length protein, DeltaF508 mutation causes detectable changes in NBD1 conformation, as well as interdomain interactions."

Its chromophore is formed by the amino acids Cys-Tyr-Gly. We obtained high resolution x-ray structures of Padron0.9 in both the fluorescent and the nonfluorescent states and used the structural information for molecular dynamics simulations.

The molecular dynamics simulations clarified the protonation states of the amino acid residues within the chromophore pocket that influence the protonation state of the chromophore. We conclude that a light driven cis-trans isomerization of the chromophore appears to be the fundamental switching mechanism in all photochromic fluorescent proteins known to date.

Taken together, these data point to a cis-trans isomerization, often accompanied by a change in the protonation state of the chromophore as the structural basis for reversible switching in RSFPs. Interestingly, a recent NMR study indicates that the protonated off state of Dronpa exhibits increased flexibility, suggesting that the flexibility and the protonation state of the chromophore, rather than isomerization, are the determinants for effective switching (22Mizuno H. Mal T.K. Wälchli M. Kikuchi A. Fukano T. Ando R. Jeyakanthan J. Taka J. Shiro Y. Ikura M. Miyawaki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 9227-9232Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Hence, the actual switching mechanism remains a controversial topic, and currently very little is known about the protonation states of the amino acid residues surrounding the chromophore. Here, we present the three-dimensional structure of the RSFP Padron0.9 in the fluorescent state at 1.65 Å resolution as well as in the nonfluorescent state at 1.80 Å resolution. We have focused our attention on this protein because its outstanding spectroscopic and switching properties (12Andresen M. Stiel A.C. Fölling J. Wenzel D. Schönle A. Egner A. Eggeling C. Hell S.W. Jakobs S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 1035-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) make this protein an exemplary RSFP with positive switching characteristics. Furthermore, we compare Padron0.9 with Dronpa, an example of an RSFP with negative switching characteristics (10Ando R. Mizuno H. Miyawaki A. Science. 2004; 306: 1370-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar, 11Stiel A.C. Trowitzsch S. Weber G. Andresen M. Eggeling C. Hell S.W. Jakobs S. Wahl M.C. Biochem.

Padron0.9 and Dronpa differ only in a few amino acid residues, are structurally highly similar, but exhibit antipodal switching characteristics. Thus, the comparison of these two proteins provides a powerful base to study the molecular basis of light-driven reversible switching. Moreover, we used the crystallographic data of Padron0.9 for molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the protonation states of the amino acid residues within the chromophore pocket during the switching process. We find that a cis-trans isomerization of the chromophore is the structural basis for the switching in Padron. This study further demonstrates that different absorption characteristics of the fluorescent and the nonfluorescent chromophore, evoked by distinct protonation states, are not a general requirement for photochromic switching in RSFPs. A pQE31 (Qiagen) expression vector containing the coding sequence for Padron0.9 was transformed into the Escherichia coli strain SURE (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). After induction of expression with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, the bacteria were opened by sonification, and the Padron0.9 proteins were purified by Ni-NTA (Ni2+-nitrilotriacetate) affinity chromatography and subsequent size-exclusion chromatography according to standard procedures. During the whole purification procedure, the proteins were kept at 4 °C in buffered conditions (pH 7.5). The purified proteins were concentrated to ∼26 mg/ml by ultrafiltration and taken up in 20 mm Tris/HCl and 120 mm NaCl (pH 7.5) for crystallization. Padron0.9 was crystallized without removal of the N-terminal His6 tag by sitting drop vapor diffusion at room temperature (20 °C), by employing a reservoir of 35% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 400, 5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3000, 0.1 m Hepes (pH 7.5), 10% (w/v) glycerol, and 0.1 m spermidine. The measured pH of the crystallization solution was 6.6. Crystals appeared within 1 day and continued to grow for 2 weeks. To switch whole Padron0.9 protein crystals into the on state, crystals were irradiated in the crystallization solution with blue light (488 ± 5 nm, 2.4 W/cm2) until the fluorescence reached a maximum. For the off state structure, crystals were first fully switched on and then irradiated with UV light (405 ± 5 nm, 5.3 W/cm2) until the fluorescence decreased to ∼5% of the initial value. After switching, care was taken to handle the crystals under red light illumination. Approximately 20 s after switching, the crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at the PXII beamline of the Swiss Light Source (Villigen, Switzerland) at 100 K, using a MarResearch (Hamburg, Germany) CCD detector and processed with the HKL package (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Both structures were solved essentially as described for Dronpa (11Stiel A.C. Trowitzsch S. Weber G. Andresen M. Eggeling C. Hell S.W. Jakobs S. Wahl M.C. Biochem. J. 2007; 402: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). For details, see supplemental Table 2. Photoswitching experiments were performed by using a custom-built, computer-controlled fluorescence microscope (Leica, Benzheim, Germany) equipped with a 40 × NA 0.6 air objective lens and two 100-W Hg lamps. For reversible switching, blue (488 ± 5 nm, 2.4 W/cm2) and UV (405 ± 5 nm, 5.3 W/cm2) light was used. Fluorescence intensities were recorded with a photomultiplier tube (HR9306-0; Hamamatsu, Hamamatsu, Japan) using a 500-nm long pass detection filter (HQ 500 LP; AHF Analysentechnik, Tübingen, Germany). For the determination of the absorption, excitation, and fluorescence spectra, 2 μl of the protein solution was quantitatively transferred into the fluorescent or the nonfluorescent state by irradiation with blue light (488 ± 5 nm) or UV light (405 ± 5 nm), respectively, using a fluorescence microscope equipped with a 20 × air objective lens (N Plan 0.40 NA). The switching was monitored by measuring the fluorescence signal. After maximal switching, the proteins were diluted, and the absorption and emission spectra were immediately recorded with a Varian Cary 4000 UV/VIS spectrophotometer and a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Varian, Palo Alto, CA), respectively. For pH titration experiments, the switched protein solution was diluted 50-fold into the appropriate buffer (pH 4–6, 0.1 m citrate buffer; pH 7 and 8, 0.1 m Tris-HCl; and pH 9 and 10, 0.1 m glycine buffer). To determine the fluorescence excitation spectra, the fluorescence was recorded at 525 nm. For the emission spectra, Padron0.9 was irradiated at 503 nm. The difference in free energy for adding a proton to the anionic chromophore between the cis and trans configurations was determined by classical thermodynamic integration, combined with hybrid quantum/classical free energy perturbation. The x-ray structures of PadronOn and PadronOff were used as the starting coordinates. For details see supplemental “Materials and Methods.” Padron0.9 is an RSFP with positive switching characteristics (Fig. 1A and supplemental Table 1). It is a variant of Padron (12Andresen M. Stiel A.C. Fölling J. Wenzel D. Schönle A. Egner A. Eggeling C. Hell S.W. Jakobs S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 1035-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) differing at two amino acid positions (Y116C and K198I, all numbering according to the Dronpa sequence) on its surface (supplemental Fig. 1), slightly increasing its tendency for dimerization (supplemental Fig. 2), which facilitated crystallization. It differs from Dronpa by 10 amino acid residues, of which only two (V157G and M159Y) were required to reverse the switching characteristics. At equilibrium, Padron0.9 adopts almost exclusively the nonfluorescent state, with a main absorption band at 504 nm (Fig. 1B and supplemental Table 1). Upon irradiation at this band, the nonfluorescent state is transferred into the fluorescent state, resulting in the emergence of an absorbance band at 395 nm and a decrease in the absorbance at 504 nm. Fluorescence emission, peaking at 524 nm, appears upon excitation of the 504 nm band of the fluorescent state. An excitation of the 395 nm band results only in weak fluorescence (Fig. 1B) and concomitantly transfers the protein to the nonfluorescent state. The pH dependence of the absorption spectra reveals that the 504 nm band in the nonfluorescent and fluorescent states represents the deprotonated form of the chromophore (Fig. 1, C and D). The 395 nm band of the fluorescent state, which corresponds to the protonated form, is also observable upon titration of the nonfluorescent state to pH values <5. In the nonfluorescent state, all reported Dronpa variants with negative switching characteristics have a largely protonated chromophore (10Ando R. Mizuno H. Miyawaki A. Science. 2004; 306: 1370-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar, 12Andresen M. Stiel A.C. Fölling J. Wenzel D. Schönle A. Egner A. Eggeling C. Hell S.W. Jakobs S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 1035-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In contrast, in the nonfluorescent Padron0.9, the chromophore is almost exclusively in the deprotonated form, which is also the protonation state of the fluorescent chromophore. Hence, we conclude that protonation alone is insufficient to explain the absence of fluorescence. To further investigate the inverted switching mechanism of Padron0.9, we crystallized the protein at a pH of 6.6 in the dark. Padron0.9 crystallized into octahedrally shaped crystals that could be reversibly switched at room temperature between a fluorescent form and a nonfluorescent form by alternating irradiation with blue (488 ± 5 nm) and blue and UV (405 ± 5 nm) light, the same wavelengths used to switch the protein in solution. Cycling of light-driven switching of the fluorescence of the crystal could be repeated with minimal loss in the maximum fluorescence signal (Fig. 2, A and B). To obtain the structure of Padron0.9 in the fluorescent state, crystals in solution were irradiated at room temperature with blue light (2.4 W/cm2) for 1–2 min until the fluorescence reached its maximum. For the nonfluorescent state structure, the crystals were first fully transferred into the fluorescent state and then irradiated with UV light (5.3 W/cm2) for ∼10 s until the crystals were almost nonfluorescent (<5% of the maximum fluorescence). For both structures, ∼20 s after irradiation, the crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. This delay is three orders of magnitude shorter than the ensemble thermal relaxation half-time from the fluorescent into the nonfluorescent state (∼4 h, supplemental Table 1). Hence, we captured the proteins in the respective switched ground states. The x-ray structures of Padron0.9On (Protein Data Bank code 3LS3) and Padron0.9Off (Protein Data Bank code 3LSA) were refined to resolutions of 1.65 and 1.80 Å, respectively. The data collection and refinement statistics are compiled in supplemental Table 2. The x-ray structures reveal that Padron0.9 adopts a classical β-can fold (Fig. 2C). Analogous to Dronpa in the fluorescent state, the Padron0.9 fluorescent (on) state chromophore adopts a cis conformation, whereas in the nonfluorescent (off) state, it is in a trans conformation. The well resolved electron densities for the hydroxyphenyl groups exclude the possibility of coexisting multiple chromophore conformations or a substantially disordered nonfluorescent ground state in the crystals at 100 K (Fig. 2D). Similar to the situation in Dronpa, the imidazolinone ring of the Padron0.9 chromophore almost stays in place during the cis-trans isomerization, rotating by only ∼1.5 degrees (Fig. 2E). Therefore, the cis-trans isomerization at the methine bridge connecting the imidazolinone with the p-hydroxyphenyl ring results in an ∼7 Å movement of the apical hydroxyl group of the p-hydroxyphenyl ring. In Dronpa, this large movement is accommodated in the surrounding protein matrix by the movement of a number of nearby moving residues (17Andresen M. Stiel A.C. Trowitzsch S. Weber G. Eggeling C. Wahl M.C. Hell S.W. Jakobs S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 13005-13009Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 21Moors S.L.C. Michielssens S. Flors C. Dedecker P. Hofkens J. Ceulemans A. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2008; 4: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). As described above, in Padron0.9, no comparable rearrangement of the surrounding protein matrix is seen in the x-ray structures (Fig. 2E). The amino acid residue exchanges V157G and M159Y are essential to convert the negative switching Dronpa into a positive switching variant (12Andresen M. Stiel A.C. Fölling J. Wenzel D. Schönle A. Egner A. Eggeling C. Hell S.W. Jakobs S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 1035-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). A comparison of the x-ray structures of Padron0.9Off and DronpaOff reveals the immediate implication of these mutations (Fig. 3A). In Padron0.9Off, Tyr159 stabilizes the chromophore by forming a hydrogen bond to the hydroxyl group of the p-hydroxyphenyl ring. This interaction, which is absent in Dronpa, is essential for the deprotonation of the Padron0.9off trans chromophore and for shifting the thermal equilibrium to the trans conformation. A glycine residue is required at position 157, because the larger valine at this position would not allow Tyr159 to occupy its position at the trans site of the chromophore. Furthermore, in Padron0.9Off, Leu141 (instead of the Pro141 in Dronpa) results in a shift of the relative position of Ser142 (the Cα atom of Ser142 is shifted by ∼2 Å) into the direction of the cis chromophore pocket, as compared with DronpaOff (Fig. 3B, arrow 1). As a result, in Padron0.9, His193Off apparently cannot move into a cavity which is available in DronpaOff (Fig. 3B, arrow 2), thereby forcing Arg66Off to stay at its place (Fig. 3B, arrow 3). The static Arg66 forces the p-hydroxyphenyl ring of Padron0.9Off to rotate, resulting in an off state chromophore with a marked torsion. As a consequence, no amino acid rearrangements are required to accommodate the cis-trans isomerization in Padron0.9. Hence the lack of residue rearrangement can be traced to the P141L exchange. We found that off state Padron0.9 cooled to ∼170 K does not exhibit a significant increase in fluorescence, indicating that chromophore flexibility is not a major channel for radiation-less decay of the excited Padron0.9 trans chromophore. This is also supported by the observation that in the protein crystal, the nonfluorescent Padron0.9 trans chromophore is well stabilized, participating in altogether 8–9 hydrogen bonds to nearby residues, three water-mediated hydrogen bonds, and numerous van der Waals interactions. A comparable number of interactions are observed for the fluorescent cis chromophore (supplemental Fig. 3). In fact, in Padron0.9, the fluorescent and the nonfluorescent states exhibit average root mean square deviations of 0.45 Å for the atoms of the immediate chromophore surroundings. The respective values for the chromophore environments of the four crystallographically independent molecules within the same crystal and state are very similar (on state, 0.50 Å; off state, 0.32 Å). Thus, the cis and the trans chromophores are attached to the surrounding protein matrix to a comparable degree (supplemental Fig. 3). Hence, in Padron0.9, the major structural differences between the fluorescent and the nonfluorescent states are the conformations and torsions of the chromophore. The cis and the trans chromophore are differently protonated (Fig. 1). In fluorescent proteins, it is very challenging to determine the protonation state of the amino acid residues neighboring the chromophore experimentally. To address this issue and to clarify how the protein environment in Padron0.9 controls the protonation state of the chromophore in the cis and the trans configuration, we performed molecular dynamics-based free energy calculations on the Padron0.9On and Padron0.9Off structures. Details of the simulations are provided in the supplemental “Materials and Methods.” We found a difference in protonation-free energy of 11.4 ± 3 kJ/mol between the trans and cis chromophore. Thus, the free energy calculations predict that isomerization from cis to trans lowers the pKa of the chromophore by 2.0 ± 0.5 pKa. This trend is in good agreement with the experimentally determined pKa shift of ∼ 1.5 (pKaOff ∼ 4.5; pKaOn ∼ 6.0) (Fig. 1, C and D). In addition, our calculations provide information about the protonation states of titratable residues neighboring the chromophore, namely Glu144, His193, and Glu211. We performed the free energy computations with four possible different protonation states of these residues (Fig. 4 and supplemental Table 4). We find that only if the imidazolinone ring of His193 is protonated at the Nδ position and if the side chain of His193 donates a hydrogen bond to the Glu211 side chain while accepting a hydrogen bond from the protonated Glu144 side chain (Fig. 4A), the pKa shift is in agreement with the experimentally determined absorption data. All other analyzed possibilities (Fig. 4, B–D) result in pKa shifts in the opposite direction (supplemental Table 4) and are thus not consistent with the experimental data. In Padron0.9, as in all other published RSFPs so far (12Andresen M. Stiel A.C. Fölling J. Wenzel D. Schönle A. Egner A. Eggeling C. Hell S.W. Jakobs S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 1035-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 13Henderson J.N. Ai H.W. Campbell R.E. Remington S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 6672-6677Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 24Ando R. Hama H. Yamamoto-Hino M. Mizuno H. Miyawaki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 12651-12656Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar), the cis and the trans chromophores have clearly different absorption spectra due to different protonation equilibria in the two states. This observation led to the suggestion that different absorption cross-sections for the switching wavelengths in the fluorescent and the nonfluorescent states are essential for effective switching in RSFPs. In contrast, upon analysis of numerous Padron0.9 variants, we identified a variant demonstrating that effective switching is determined by the probabilities of isomerization rather than by different cross-sections for the switching wavelengths. We found that reverting Leu141 to a proline residue results in the emergence of a strong absorbance band at 395 nm, corresponding to a protonated chromophore in the nonfluorescent state (Fig. 5A). As a result, the absorption spectra of the fluorescent and the nonfluorescent states of Padron0.9-L141P are largely similar. Here, the ratio between the absorption cross-sections for 405 nm and 488 nm in the fluorescent and nonfluorescent states are 1:1.2 and 1:2.7, respectively (Fig. 5A). In comparison, in Dronpa, these ratios are 1:18.1 and 17.2:1, respectively (10Ando R. Mizuno H. Miyawaki A. Science. 2004; 306: 1370-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, Padron0.9-L141P is readily and reversibly switchable and can be switched off to 2.9% of the maximum fluorescence (Fig. 5B and supplemental Table 1). Thus, the ensemble switching efficiency does not depend on the absorption cross-sections per se, which are predominantly determined by the protonation state of the chromophore. Rather, the tendency to isomerize depends on the underlying potential energy surfaces in the excited state, which are distinct in the cis and the trans chromophores. Although in most fluorescent proteins the chromophore adopts a cis conformation, there are exceptions exhibiting a trans chromophore (25Wiedenmann J. Schenk A. Röcker C. Girod A. Spindler K.D. Nienhaus G.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 11646-11651Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Thus, the conformation of the chromophore per se is insufficient to explain the difference in fluorescence between the on and the off states. This raises the question why the cis chromophore in Padron0.9 is fluorescent, as in all other currently described RSFPs, whereas the trans chromophore is not. Crystallographic studies capture the chromophore in the respective ground states and are not meant to investigate the short-lived excited states that might be partially disordered. Presumably and not unexpectedly, the photochromic proteins may exhibit flexibility in the excited off state (22Mizuno H. Mal T.K. Wälchli M. Kikuchi A. Fukano T. Ando R. Jeyakanthan J. Taka J. Shiro Y. Ikura M. Miyawaki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 9227-9232Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It may be noted, however, that the cooling off state Padron0.9 to ∼170 K does not increase the fluorescence noticeably. Therefore, it appears unlikely that the lack of fluorescence can solely be attributed to chromophore flexibility, but rather that the torsion of the trans state chromophore is a major factor determining the absence of fluorescence. From detailed studies on organic stilbenes, it is known that planar chromophoric systems are more fluorescent than those with a strong torsion (26Oelgemöller M. Brem B. Frank R. Schneider S. Lenoir D. Hertkorn N. Origane Y. Lemmen P. Lexe J. Inoue Y. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 2002; 2: 1760-1771Crossref Google Scholar). Strikingly, in Padron0.9, the angle θ spanned by the planes of the chromophoric five- and six-membered rings is almost identical in both the fluorescent and nonfluorescent ground states (supplemental Fig. 4). Consequently, co-planarity per se appears not to be an appropriate measure to distinguish fluorescent from nonfluorescent chromophores. However, the position of the two chromophoric rings relative to each other is not unambiguously described by the angle θ. Rather, the “tilt” (τ) and “twist” (ϕ) angles (Fig. 6A) fully describe the torsion of the chromophoric system. If τ and ϕ have the same direction, the torsion (“propeller twist”) within the chromophore is increased, whereas if τ and ϕ have opposite directions, the torsion is reduced, and the chromophoric system is more smoothly bent (Fig. 6B). A chromophore with a smooth bend, as opposed to a pronounced propeller twist, may be achieved even in a chromophore with large τ and ϕ angles. Therefore, the modulus of the sum of τ and ϕ, rather than the sum of the modulus of τ and the modulus of ϕ, is an appropriate measure for the bending of the chromophore. Indeed, by analyzing all available x-ray structures of photochromic FPs, we find that the modulus of the sum of τ and ϕ is always smaller in the fluorescent state than in the nonfluorescent state (supplemental Table 5). This rule holds true even for chromophore structures of Dronpa and one of its variants, which were predicted by molecular dynamics simulations (21Moors S.L.C. Michielssens S. Flors C. Dedecker P. Hofkens J. Ceulemans A. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2008; 4: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Hence, the modulus of the sum of τ and ϕ appears to be a robust measure to predict the tendency of a green fluorescent protein-like chromophore to fluoresce. The importance of this factor may vary between different fluorescent proteins. In Padron0.9, the modulus of the sum of τ and ϕ is 11.6 ± 1.1 and 22.3 ± 2.1 for the fluorescent and the nonfluorescent states, respectively (supplemental Table 5). The same tendency is observed in the RSFP asFP595-A143S, although the sums of τ and ϕ in both states of the chromophore are only slightly different (10.3 ± 1.5 and 14.7 ± 2.3, respectively). Intriguingly, for this protein, it has been shown that the cis-oriented chromophore is much better stabilized by the surrounding protein matrix than the trans-oriented chromophore (15Andresen M. Wahl M.C. Stiel A.C. Gräter F. Schäfer L.V. Trowitzsch S. Weber G. Eggeling C. Grubmüller H. Hell S.W. Jakobs S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 13070-13074Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), further supporting the view that the rigidity of the chromophoric system is another key factor determining its ability to fluoresce. Comparatively little is known about the proton dynamics within the β-barrel and the protonation states of titrable amino acids residues close to the chromophore. Our molecular dynamics simulations of Padron0.9 indicate that no changes in the overall protonation pattern were required to obtain the pKa shift of two units. We therefore suggest that the proton for neutralizing the chromophore is taken up from the bulk solution, rather than from somewhere in the protein. In this case, an equilibrium between the neutral and anionic forms of the chromophore would be established after the photoisomerization. We found that the titration behavior of on state Padron0.9 is highly irregular and exhibits a complicated pH dependence (Fig. 1D). Increasing the pH above 6.0, the estimated pKa of the cis chromophore does not result in a complete disappearance of the 395 nm absorbance band associated with the protonated species. An irregular titration behavior suggests that there are strong interactions between groups with similar intrinsic pKa values (27Klingen A.R. Bombarda E. Ullmann G.M. Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 2006; 5: 588-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, we assume a coupling between the Padron0.9 cis chromophore (on state) with an other residue with a similar pKa. Potential interaction partners of the cis chromophore are the ionizable groups of cysteines (pKa ∼ 8.55) or histidines (pKa ∼ 6.54) (28Thurlkill R.L. Grimsley G.R. Scholtz J.M. Pace C.N. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 1214-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). To identify a potential coupling amino acid residue, we first mutated (in computer simulations as well as experimentally) Cys62 and Cys171 individually against serines, whose hydroxyl groups are normally unreactive and would not get deprotonated. Both free energy calculations (supplemental Table 6) as well as pH titration experiments (supplemental Fig. 5) did not modify the titration behavior of the on state. Therefore, these data exclude Cys62 or Cys171 as the primary cause of the peculiar pH titration behavior of on state Padron0.9. The other residue that might induce the irregular titration behavior of the chromophore is His193, which forms a π-stack with the hydroxyphenyl ring of the cis chromophore. Indeed, our molecular dynamics simulations showed that deprotonating His193 (together with Glu144) results in an upward shift of the pKa by ∼3 units (i.e. the protonation free energy decreases from 1105.8 to 1122.4 kJmol−1; supplemental Table 4), indicating a strong coupling between His193 and the chromophore. We therefore suggest that the irregular titration behavior of the cis chromophore of Padron0.9 may be mediated by a coupling of His193 with the chromophore, stabilizing the protonated chromophore at high pH values. In summary, we demonstrated in this study by analysis of Padron0.9-L141P that distinct absorption cross-sections for switching in the on and the off states are not necessary for efficient light-driven reversible switching. We analyzed the molecular basis for the antipodal switching characteristics of Padron0.9 and Dronpa. Although in Padron0.9, in contrast to Dronpa, no further rearrangements of the protein matrix occur due to the single mutation P141L, the essential element of switching is a light-induced cis-trans isomerization of the chromophore.

Prxs and MSRs possess a variable number of redox-active Cys for catalyzing the reduction of their substrates, peroxides and methionine sulfoxide (MetSO), respectively. For both enzymes, the mechanism starts by the oxidation of the “catalytic” Cys to the sulfenic acid form (Cys-SOH) (15Kumar R.A. Koc A. Cerny R.L. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol.

In the case of 2-Cys Prxs, MSRAs, and 2-Cys MSRBs, the second step, reduction of Cys-SOH, is achieved by an internal “resolving” Cys, through the formation of an intra- or intermolecular disulfide bond, subsequently reduced by thiol oxidoreductases (15Kumar R.A.

The intervention of glutathione as the Cys-SOH reductant followed by a deglutathionylation step achieved by glutathione S-transferase has been shown for human 1-Cys Prx (22Manevich Y. Feinstein S.I.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 360-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Similarly, we previously showed that regeneration of Arabidopsis 1-Cys MSRB activity by the GSH/Grx system involves first glutathionylation of the Cys-SOH formed on the catalytic Cys after MetSO reduction and then deglutathionylation by Grxs (21Tarrago L.

Interestingly, several lines of evidence indicate that Trxs could also act as reductants for 1-Cys MSRBs, but the underlying biochemical mechanisms remain unclear. For instance, mammalian Trxs are able to covalently interact with substrate-oxidized 1-Cys MSRBs and to regenerate their activity (24Kim H.Y. Kim J.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 371: 490-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the case of plant 1-Cys MSRBs, there is generally only one isoform, termed MSRB1, which is located in plastids (20Tarrago L.

Plants display a remarkable diversity of Trxs (1Meyer Y. Siala W. Bashandy T. Riondet C. Vignols F. Reichheld J.P. Biochim. Biophys.

Affinity chromatography and co-immunoprecipitation assays identified plastidial 2-Cys Prxs and 1-Cys MSRB1 as potential targets of CDSP32 (28Broin M. Cuiné S. Eymery F. Rey P.

Very interestingly, this Trx is able to regenerate the activity of plant and mammalian 1-Cys MSRBs without addition of GSH or any other thiol compound (30Ding D. Sagher D. Laugier E. Rey P. Weissbach H. Zhang X.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 361: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), raising the hypothesis that regeneration might proceed through an alternative mechanism, distinct from the glutathionylation/deglutathionylation process used by Grxs (21Tarrago L.

In this work, we performed a biochemical analysis to delineate the reduction mechanism used by CDSP32 in the reduction of 1-Cys MSRB1. Our data show that the Trx, unlike Grxs, is able to directly reduce the sulfenic acid formed on the catalytic Cys of MSRB1 after MetSO reduction.

Primers for site-directed mutagenesis, containing a modified restriction enzyme site allowing screening, are presented in supplemental Table 1. Wild-type (WT) and mutated forms of MSRB1 and CDSP32 were purified as described previously (21Tarrago L. Laugier E. Zaffagnini M. Marchand C. Le Maréchal P. Rouhier N. Lemaire S.D. Rey P. J. Biol.

CDSP32 proteins were reduced using 20 mm DTTred for 30 min at room temperature and then desalted using HiTrapTM desalting column or IllustraTM NAP-5 Sephadex G-25 (GE Healthcare) in 50 mm K2HPO4/KH2PO4, 100 mm KCl, pH 7.0. Protein concentration was determined using a bicinchoninic acid assay (BC Assay Reagent, Interchim) and by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm using specific extinction coefficients. Protein purity was verified using SDS-polyacrylamide gels stained with ImperialTM protein stain (Pierce). 10 μm WT or C222S CDSP32 was incubated with 1 mm DTTred or DTTox or with 30 μm MSRB1 in the presence or absence of 200 μm N-acetyl-MetSO. After 30 min, proteins were precipitated in 10% trichloroacetic acid. The pellet obtained after centrifugation was washed with 2% trichloroacetic acid and solubilized in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% (w/v) SDS, 2 mm AMS (Invitrogen). Proteins were separated using 17% bisacrylamide-SDS-polyacrylamide gels and revealed using ImperialTM protein stain. The protein thiol content was determined using the 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) procedure. After 30 min of incubation in the presence of 20 mm DTTred or 20 mm DTTox, proteins (50 μm) were desalted in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, using NAP-5 columns. Thiol measurement was performed after incubation for 30 min in the dark in the presence of 200 μm DTNB, 1% (w/v) SDS. The absorbance was read at 412 nm, and the thiol content was estimated using a molar extinction coefficient of 13,600 m1·cm−1 for 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid (TNB). Cys-SOH content was determined using the specific TNB reagent prepared from reduction of DTNB (31Turell L. Botti H. Carballal S. Ferrer-Sueta G. Souza J.M. Durán R. Freeman B.A. Radi R. Alvarez B. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 358-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Pre-reduced MSRs (8–50 μm) were incubated with 70 μm TNB in a final volume of 250 μl of 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Cys-SOH formation was then monitored spectrophotometrically following the decrease in TNB concentration at 412 nm after addition of N-acetyl-MetSO (0.4–1.6 mm) using a molar extinction coefficient of 14,150 m1·cm−1. Absorbance and spectra were recorded using a Cary-50 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian, Inc.). The insulin reduction assay was used to analyze Trx activity as described previously (26Rey P. Pruvot G. Becuwe N. Eymery F. Rumeau D. Peltier G. Plant J. 1998; 13: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) using 5 μm WT and mutated C-terminal CDSP32. Activity of recombinant MSRB proteins using reduced and desalted CDSP32 as an electron donor was determined at 25 °C by monitoring the reduction of the synthetic substrate, dabsyl-MetSO, as reported previously (21Tarrago L. Laugier E. Zaffagnini M. Marchand C. Le Maréchal P. Rouhier N. Lemaire S.D. Rey P. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 18963-18971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). After purification, recombinant MSRB1 was pre-oxidized in the presence of 2 mm N-acetyl-MetSO for 15 min at 25 °C and then desalted in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, using NAP-5 columns. Pre-reduced or pre-oxidized MSRB1 (5 or 20 μm) was incubated with 20 μm pre-reduced C-terminal C222S CDSP32, C-terminal WT CDSP32, or C-terminal C219S CDSP32 for 30 min at 25 °C in the presence or absence of 1 mm diamide. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, using NuPAGETM loading buffer, and NuPAGETM 4–12% BisTris gels and MES buffer (Invitrogen). After Coomassie Blue staining, the identity of proteins was determined using peptide mass fingerprints. Bands were excised, destained, and subjected to in gel digestion with trypsin as described previously (32Preger V. Tango N. Marchand C. Lemaire S.D. Carbonera D. Di Valentin M. Costa A. Pupillo P. Trost P. Plant Physiol. 2009; 150: 606-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Peptide mass fingerprints were performed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight analysis on a Voyager DE-STR mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) as described previously (33Augusto L.A.

Redox titration of CDSP32 was performed using mBBr as reported previously (34Krimm I. Lemaire S. Ruelland E. Miginiac-Maslow M. Jaquot J.P. Hirasawa M. Knaff D.B. Lancelin J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). CDSP32 (50 μm) was incubated at defined Eh values in 500-μl aliquots prepared by modifying the proportions of DTTred and DTTox (final DTT concentration, 2 mm). All Em value calculations were based on values of −327 and −385 mV for the Eh of DTT at pH 7.0 and pH 7.9, respectively (35Hirasawa M. Schürmann P. Jacquot J.P. Manieri W. Jacquot P. Keryer E.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Titrations were carried out in 0.1 m HEPES-HCl, pH 7.0, or in 0.1 m Tricine-NaOH, pH 7.9. After equilibrating CDSP32 samples in DTT redox buffers for 2 h, 5 μl of a saturated mBBr solution in acetonitrile was added. After 20 min in the dark, CDSP32 was precipitated using the trichloroacetic acid procedure described above, and the protein pellet was dissolved in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 1% (w/v) SDS. Fluorescence was measured at 450 nm, after excitation at 380 nm, using an LS50B spectrofluorimeter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For redox titration of MSRB1, the enzyme was pre-oxidized using 2 mm N-acetyl-MetSO in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 15 min at 25 °C and then desalted in 0.1 m Tricine-NaOH, pH 7.9, using a NAP-5 column. 10 μm pre-oxidized MSRB1 was incubated for 1 h at 25 °C in 500-μl aliquots at defined Eh based on DTTred and DTTox proportions at a final DTT concentration of 10 mm. After desalting on NAP-5 column, protein concentration was determined at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 26,930 m−1·cm−1. Aliquots (95 μl) were incubated with 5 μl of 5 mm dabsyl-MetSO for 30 min at 37 °C. The amount of dabsyl-Met formed was determined as described previously (21Tarrago L. Laugier E. Zaffagnini M.

Titration data were fitted to the Nernst equation using nonlinear regression. The n value was set to 2 as the disulfide-dithiol exchange, and the oxidation and reduction of Cys sulfenic acid are expected to be two-electron transfer processes (35Hirasawa M. Schürmann P.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9906-9914Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The redox potential is reported as the mean value ± S.D. of three replicates. The mature CDSP32 protein is composed of two Trx domains, including only one potential active site, Cys219–Gly220–Pro221–Cys222, in the C-terminal domain (from Gly181 to Tyr302). The N-terminal domain (from Ala59 to Tyr180) contains two Cys at positions 122 and 142, and the C-terminal domain contains another one at position 253. To determine the redox status of CDSP32 cysteines, the free thiol content of WT and mutated CDSP32 was assayed using a DTNB procedure after incubation with DTTred or DTTox and subsequent desalting (Table 1). Reduced WT CDSP32 was found to contain 5.1 thiols, consistent with the reduction of five Cys. After incubation with DTTox, the observed number of free thiols was 2.7, corresponding to a decrease of ∼2 thiols compared with the number in the reduced protein. These results very likely indicate the formation of one disulfide bond in oxidized CDSP32. Consistently, in the case of the C-terminal domain, 3.1 thiols were titrated when the protein was reduced and only 1.0 after incubation with DTTox. These data lead us to conclude that the redox-active CDSP32 Cys are located in the C-terminal part of the protein. Titration experiments with C222S CDSP32 revealed no significant change in the number of free thiols. Indeed, after reductive and oxidative treatments, the numbers of free thiols in the protein lacking the second Cys in the potential active site were 3.9 and 3.5, respectively, indicating that Cys222 is redox-active and very likely able to form a disulfide bond with the other Cys of the potential active site, Cys219.TABLE 1Free thiol content in WT and mutated CDSP32 proteins after treatment with DTTred and DTToxNo. of CysNo. of free thiols measuredDTTredDTToxDifference (DTTred − DTTox)CDSP3255.1 ± 0.12.7 ± 0.12.4 ± 0.1CDSP32 C terminus33.1 ± 0.21.0 ± 0.22.1 ± 0.3C222S CDSP3243.9 ± 0.43.5 ± 0.40.4 ± 0.6 Open table in a new tab The thioredoxin activity of WT and mutated C-terminal CDSP32 was assayed using insulin as a substrate to investigate the role of the three Cys present in this domain (Fig. 1). Note that we previously reported the inability of whole CDSP32 to reduce the disulfide bonds in insulin (26Rey P. Pruvot G. Becuwe N. Eymery F. Rumeau D. Peltier G. Plant J. 1998; 13: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In the presence of C-terminal WT CDSP32, insulin precipitation occurred after 10 min, and reduction proceeded at a rate of 0.114 A650 unit·min−1 as reported previously (26Rey P. Pruvot G. Becuwe N. Eymery F. Rumeau D. Peltier G. Plant J. 1998; 13: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In contrast, C-terminal C219S CDSP32 and C222S CDSP32 were found unable to reduce insulin underlining the critical role of Cys219 and Cys222 in the reaction. When using C-terminal C253S CDSP32, insulin precipitation took place after 12 min with a rate lower than that of the WT form (0.063 A650 unit·min−1), revealing that Cys253 is not required for insulin reduction. Taking into consideration the thiol titration data and the conservation of the Trx-active site, these results indicate that Cys219 and Cys222 are the catalytic and resolving redox-active Cys, respectively, in CDSP32. Furthermore, they indicate that Cys253 is not required for CDSP32 disulfide reductase activity. We then characterized the CDSP32 redox properties by determining the redox midpoint potential (Em) of C-terminal CDSP32 using mBBr to label free thiols at 25 °C at two pH values, 7.0 and 7.9 (Fig. 2). Titration data best fitted to the Nernst equation for a single two-electron redox couple (n settled to 2). The calculated redox midpoint potentials (Em) were −284 ± 3 and −337 ± 2 mV at pH 7.0 and 7.9, respectively. The difference of −53 ± 4 mV is consistent with the −59 mV/pH unit variation expected for the process of disulfide bond reduction, which involves the uptake of two protons per two electrons (35Hirasawa M.

The plastidial 1-Cys MSRB1 was first identified as able to interact with CDSP32 via a redox-based mechanism in affinity chromatography experiments (29Rey P. Cuiné S. Eymery F. Garin J. Court M. Jacquot J.P. Rouhier N. Broin M. Plant J. 2005; 41: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Moreover, activity assays showed that CDSP32 provides MSRB1 with electrons (16Vieira Dos Santos C. Laugier E. Tarrago L. Massot V. Issakidis-Bourguet E. Rouhier N. Rey P.

To delineate the regeneration mechanism of MSRB1 by CDSP32, we first investigated whether both proteins could form redox-dependent heterodimeric complexes. For this purpose, MSRB1, either reduced or substrate-oxidized, was incubated with reduced C222S CDSP32 in ratios of 1:1 and 1:4. A mutated form of the Trx lacking the resolving Cys was used to stabilize the complex formed through an intermolecular disulfide bridge as shown for many targets of Trxs (24Kim H.Y. Kim J.R. Biochem.

The case of the protease-activated receptor PAR1 is particularly relevant in view of the plethora of biological effects associated with its activation by thrombin. Here, we present the 1.8 Å resolution structure of thrombin S195A in complex with a 30-residue long uncleaved extracellular fragment of PAR1 that documents for the first time a productive binding mode bridging the active site and exosite I. The structure reveals two unexpected features of the thrombin-PAR1 interaction. The acidic P3 residue of PAR1, Asp39, does not hinder binding to the active site and actually makes favorable interactions with Gly219 of thrombin. The tethered ligand domain shows a considerable degree of disorder even when bound to thrombin.

IntroductionThrombin is a trypsin-like protease endowed with important physiological functions that are mediated and regulated by interaction with numerous macromolecular substrates, receptors, and inhibitors (1Di Cera E. Mol. Aspects Med. 2008; 29: 203-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Fenton (2Fenton 2nd, J.W. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1986; 485: 5-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) was the first to recognize that thrombin selectivity toward macromolecular substrates depends on interactions with exosites that extend beyond the active site. Exosite I is positioned some 15 Å away from the active site (3Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar) and occupies a domain analogous to the Ca2+-binding loop of trypsin and chymotrypsin (4Bartunik H.D. Summers L.J. Bartsch H.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 813-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Recognition of macromolecular substrates or receptors responsible for the procoagulant, prothrombotic, signaling, and anticoagulant functions of thrombin depends on the structural integrity of this exosite (1Di Cera E. Mol. Aspects Med. 2008; 29: 203-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In general, exosite-dependent binding is kinetically limiting as a recognition strategy of macromolecular targets by enzymes involved in blood coagulation (5Bock P.E. Panizzi P. Verhamme I.M. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2007; 5: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar).

On the other hand, structural elucidation of how substrates bridge the active site and exosite I in their binding to thrombin has been challenging.PAR1 is a premiere prothrombotic and signaling factor (22Coughlin S.R.

Circulation. 2006; 113: 1244-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar).Major progress has been made recently in our structural understanding of how thrombin recognizes the extracellular domain of PAR4 and how cleaved PAR3 acts as a cofactor for PAR4 cleavage on murine platelets (15Bah A.

On the other hand, our structural information on the binding mode of PAR1 remains confined to the acidic hirugen-like domain, which recognizes exosite I (12Mathews II, Padmanabhan K.P. Ganesh V.

In a previous structure of thrombin bound to an extracellular fragment of PAR1, the cleavage site at Arg41 was directed toward the active site of a second thrombin molecule in the crystal lattice in a nonproductive binding mode (12Mathews II, Padmanabhan K.P. Ganesh V. Tulinsky A. Ishii M. Chen J. Turck C.W. Coughlin S.R. Fenton 2nd, J.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3266-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). No details could be gleaned on the contacts made by the P1–P4 residues (35Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4730) Google Scholar) of PAR1 with the active site of thrombin or on the precise conformation of the tethered ligand domain bound to the enzyme. That information is presented here for the first time.MATERIALS AND METHODSThe human thrombin mutant S195A was constructed, expressed, and purified to homogeneity as described previously (36Krem M.M. Di Cera E. Biophys. Chem. 2003; 100: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A soluble extracellular fragment of human PAR1, 33ATNATLDPR↓SFLLRNPNDKYEPFWEDEEKN62 (where the arrow indicates the site of cleavage between Arg41 and Ser42), was synthesized by solid phase, purified to homogeneity by high pressure liquid chromatography, and tested for purity by mass spectrometry. Thrombin S195A was concentrated to 9 mg/ml in 50 mm choline chloride and 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4). The PAR1 fragment, also in the same buffer, was added to maintain the molar ratio at 1:11. Initial crystal screening was done using the PEGs Suite (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) containing 0.2 m Na+/K+ tartrate. Vapor diffusion with hanging drops was used to generate crystals. For each of the 96 screen conditions, a hanging drop was prepared by mixing 1 μl of thrombin-PAR1 complex and 1 μl of reservoir solution, and the drop was allowed to equilibrate with 500 μl of crystallization buffer at 22 °C. Diffraction quality crystals were obtained in 2 weeks. The crystals were triclinic, with space group P1 and unit cell parameters a = 46.3 Å, b = 50.2 Å, and c = 85.5 Å and α = 76.4°, β = 83.9°, and γ = 73.7°, with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Crystals were cryoprotected with the appropriate buffer and 15% glycerol prior to flash-freezing. X-ray data were collected to 1.8 Å resolution at 100 K on an ADSC Quantum-315 CCD detector at beamline 14-BM-C of the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne, IL). Data processing including indexing, integration, and scaling was performed using the HKL2000 software package (37Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38368) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of thrombin S195A bound to the extracellular fragment of PAR1 was solved by molecular replacement using the coordinates of thrombin bound to H-d-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2Cl (Protein Data Bank code 1SHH) (17Pineda A.O.

Refinement and electron density generation were performed with REFMAC from the CCP4 Suite (38Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and 5% of the reflections were selected randomly as a test for cross-validation. Model building was performed with COOT (39Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22815) Google Scholar). In the final refinement stage, TLS (translation/libration/screw) tensors modeling rigid body anisotropic temperature factors were calculated and applied to the model. Statistics for data collection and refinement are summarized in Table 1.

Open table in a new tab RESULTSIt has long been recognized that the extracellular fragment of PAR1 carries all determinants for thrombin recognition (7Ayala Y.M. Cantwell A.M. Rose T. Bush L.A. Arosio D. Di Cera E. Proteins. 2001; 45: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 10Vu T.K. Wheaton V.I. Hung D.T. Charo I. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 674-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) and that these are the site of cleavage around Arg41, 38LDPR41, contacting the active site and the acidic hirugen-like motif 51KYEPF55 engaging exosite I. It was therefore expected that PAR1 would interact with thrombin by bridging the active site and exosite I (10Vu T.K. Wheaton V.I. Hung D.T. Charo I. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 674-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 40Qiu X. Padmanabhan K.P. Carperos V.E. Tulinsky A. Kline T. Maraganore J.M. Fenton 2nd, J.W.

Biol. 1991; 221: 583-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Results from structural investigation of the thrombin-PAR1 interaction have documented the expected binding mode to exosite I (12Mathews II, Padmanabhan K.P. Ganesh V. Tulinsky A. Ishii M. Chen J. Turck C.W. Coughlin S.R. Fenton 2nd, J.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3266-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 13Gandhi P.S. Chen Z. Mathews F.S. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 1832-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) but not the way PAR1 contacts the active site. Specifically, a previous low (3.1 Å) resolution structure of thrombin bound to a 23-residue long fragment of PAR1 encompassing the cleavage site revealed an artifactual conformation of the tethered ligand downstream of Arg41 resulting into nonproductive contacts with a second thrombin molecule in the crystal lattice (12Mathews II, Padmanabhan K.P. Ganesh V. Tulinsky A. Ishii M. Chen J. Turck C.W. Coughlin S.R. Fenton 2nd, J.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3266-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The artifactual conformation documented for PAR1 bound to thrombin in this previous structure (12Mathews II, Padmanabhan K.P. Ganesh V. Tulinsky A. Ishii M. Chen J. Turck C.W. Coughlin S.R. Fenton 2nd, J.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3266-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) is not surprising because thrombin was used in its active wild-type form. Productive binding of the PAR1 fragment to the active site would have resulted in cleavage and either failure to crystallize or crystallization of a complex with the cleaved peptide bound. The structure presented here was solved using thrombin inactivated with the S195A mutation and reveals a binding mode of PAR1 to the E:Na+ (fast) form of thrombin that is consistent with all functional and mutagenesis data (7Ayala Y.M. Cantwell A.M. Rose T. Bush L.A. Arosio D. Di Cera E. Proteins. 2001; 45: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 10Vu T.K. Wheaton V.I. Hung D.T. Charo I. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 674-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar).The relatively high (1.8 Å) resolution of the present structure yields good electron density for the entire complex (Fig. 1). The extracellular fragment of PAR1 is bound to a single thrombin molecule in the crystal, and the surface of recognition bridges the active site and exosite I, as expected (7Ayala Y.M. Cantwell A.M. Rose T. Bush L.A. Arosio D. Di Cera E. Proteins. 2001; 45: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 10Vu T.K. Wheaton V.I. Hung D.T. Charo I. Coughlin S.R.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11689-11697Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the tethered ligand connecting the domains of PAR1 interacting with the active site and exosite I is for the most part disordered. Electron density is strong for Arg41 and Ser42 at the cleavage site, vouching for an intact PAR1 peptide, but becomes weaker for sequence 44LLRNP48 immediately downstream (Fig. 2). A solution structure of the cleaved fragment of human PAR1 captured the entire tethered ligand, 42SFLLRNPND50, in a stable S-like conformation predicted to fold away from the thrombin surface (42Seeley S.

Recent crystallographic data were unable to detect strong electron density for fragments 38SFNGGP43 and 42SFLLRNP48, corresponding to the tethered ligands of murine PAR3 and human PAR1 (13Gandhi P.S.

These findings, along with the current structure of the thrombin-PAR1 complex, suggest that the tethered ligand may be “under tension” in the uncleaved form of PAR1, ready to snap back onto the receptor surface and away from the enzyme as soon as cleavage at Arg41 takes place.FIGURE 2Details of the cleavage site and tethered ligand of PAR1. Fragment 40PRSFLL45, spanning the P2–P4′ positions, is shown with its 2Fo − Fc electron density map (light green mesh) contoured at 0.9σ. The peptide bond between Arg41 and Ser42 can be assigned with confidence, vouching for an intact PAR1 fragment. Downstream of Phe43, the electron density becomes weaker, underscoring disorder in most of the tethered ligand.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Intramolecular interactions stabilize the architecture of the extracellular fragment of PAR1 bound to thrombin. In the N-terminal portion upstream of the cleavage site, OH of Thr34 H-bonds to the backbone N of Ala36. The water molecule at position 166 (w166) mediates an intramolecular interaction for the backbone Os of Ala36 and Leu38 with Oδ1 of Asp39. A second water molecule, w167, links the backbone O of Thr34 to the backbone N and OH of Thr37. The backbone O of Asn35 engages the backbone N of Leu38. These intramolecular interactions result in a single 310-helix turn reminiscent of the architecture seen in fragments of fibrinogen and factor XIII bound to thrombin (18Stubbs M.T. Oschkinat H.

The C-terminal portion of the cleavage site presents the tethered ligand within 4 Å from the thrombin surface. Pro48 constrains Asn49 and Asp50 to fold toward the thrombin surface. An H-bond between the backbone O of Arg46 and the backbone Ns of Asn49 and Asp50 stabilizes the architecture of PAR1 in this region, along with H-bonds between OH of Tyr52 and the backbone O of Leu45 and between the backbone O of Asp50 and the side chain of Arg46. The H-bonding network likely provides a spring-loaded mechanism to trigger the conformational transition of the tethered ligand following cleavage at Arg41 required to engage the receptor for activation and signaling.The extracellular fragment of PAR1 engages the active site and exosite I of thrombin with a number of polar and hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 1) that are summarized in Table 2. The N terminus of the peptide is solvent-exposed. The backbone N of Thr34 interacts with the backbone O of Arg173, and the side chain of Thr37 contacts Glu217.

The side chain of Asp39 points away from the thrombin surface, but Oδ2 forms an H-bond with the backbone N of Gly219 (Fig. 3). w271 strategically bridges the backbone O of Thr37, Oδ2 of Asp39, and the backbone N of Gly219 and acts in concert with w166 to stabilize the side chain of Asp39. The P2 residue of PAR1, Pro40, fits snugly into a hydrophobic pocket formed by the benzyl ring of Tyr60a, the indole of Trp60d, the imidazole of catalytic His57, and the side chain of Leu99 (Fig. 3). These interactions are analogous to those observed for Pro residues at the P2 positions of PAR4 (15Bah A. Chen Z. Bush-Pelc L.A. Mathews F.S. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The guanidinium group of Arg41 engages the side chain of Asp189 in a strong bidentate H-bonding interaction and also the backbone Os of Ala190 and Gly219. The backbone N of Arg41 interacts with the backbone O of Ser214, whereas the backbone O of Arg41 occupies the oxyanion hole by engaging the backbone Ns of the mutated Ala195 and Gly193.TABLE 2H-bonding interactions between PAR1 and thrombinPAR1ThrombinDistanceMolecule 1Molecule 2ÅThr34 NArg173 O3.54.7Thr37 Oγ1Glu217 Oϵ22.62.6Asp39 Oδ2Gly219 N2.83Asp39 NGly216 O2.92.9Asp39 OGly216 N3.13.1Arg41 NH1, NH2Asp189 Oδ1, Oδ22.9, 2.92.8, 2.8Arg41 NH2Ala190 O3.43.5Arg41 NH2Gly219 O33.1Arg41 NSer214 C2.92.9Arg41 OAla195 N32.9Arg41 OAsp194 N3.43.5Arg41 OGly193 N2.72.9Ser42 OHLeu41 O2.32.8Arg46 Nϵ, NH2Gln38 O3.1, 4.42.6, 3.1Asn47 Nδ2Lys149e O3.2NAAsn47 Oδ1Lys149e Nς2.9NATyr52 OHArg73 NH13.22.5Tyr52 OGln38 Nϵ23.07.2Glu53 Oϵ1, Oϵ2Arg75 NH13.3, 3.27.8, 7.1Glu53 Oϵ1Tyr76 N3.13.2Glu53 NThr74 O2.93.0Phe55 benzene ringArg67 NH1, NH2, NϵCation-πCation-π Open table in a new tab FIGURE 3Molecular contacts at the active site for the thrombin-PAR1 complex.

https://openalex.org/W2147547451,"Indoleamine 2,3-dioxigenase (IDO) is an inflammatory cytokine-inducible rate-limiting enzyme of the tryptophan (Trp) catabolism, which is involved in the inhibition of intracellular pathogen replication as well as in immunomodulation. Here we demonstrated the effect of IDO-dependent Trp catabolism on Trypanosoma cruzi resistance to acute infection. Infection with T. cruzi resulted in the systemic activation of IDO. The blocking of IDO activity in vivo impaired resistance to the infection and exacerbated the parasite load and infection-associated pathology. In addition, IDO activity was critical to controlling the parasite's replication in macrophages (Mos), despite the high production of nitric oxide produced by IDO-blocked T. cruzi-infected Mos. Analysis of the mechanisms by which IDO controls the parasite replication revealed that T. cruzi amastigotes were sensitive to l-kynurenine downstream metabolites 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, while 3-HK also affected the trypomastigote stage. Finally, 3-HK treatment of mice acutely infected with T. cruzi was able to control the parasite and to improve the survival of lethally infected mice. During infection, IDO played a critical role in host defense against T. cruzi; therefore, the intervention of IDO pathway could be useful as a novel antitrypanosomatid therapeutic strategy.—Knubel, C.

This study shows that ASMase is a negative regulator of LPS-induced tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) secretion in macrophages. ASMase-deficient (asm−/−) mice and isolated peritoneal macrophages produce severalfold more TNFα than their wild-type (asm+/+) counterparts when stimulated with LPS, whereas the addition of exogenous ceramides or sphingomyelinase reduces the differences. The underlying mechanism for these effects is not transcriptional but post-translational. The TNFα-converting enzyme (TACE) catalyzes the maturation of the 26-kDa precursor (pro-TNFα) to an active 17-kDa form (soluble (s)TNFα). In mouse peritoneal macrophages, the activity of TACE was the rate-limiting factor regulating TNFα production. A substantial portion of the translated pro-TNFα was not processed to sTNFα; instead, it was rapidly internalized and degraded in the lysosomes. TACE activity was 2–3-fold higher in asm−/− macrophages as compared with asm+/+ macrophages and was suppressed when cells were treated with exogenous ceramide and sphingomyelinase. Indirect immunofluorescence analyses revealed distinct TNFα-positive structures in the close vicinity of the plasma membrane in asm−/− but not in asm+/+ macrophages. asm−/− cells also had a higher number of early endosomal antigen 1-positive early endosomes. Experiments that involved inhibitors of TACE, endocytosis, and lysosomal proteolysis suggest that in the asm−/− cells a significant portion of pro-TNFα was sequestered within the early endosomes, and instead of undergoing lysosomal proteolysis, it was recycled to the plasma membrane and processed to sTNFα.

In contrast, evidence for a regulatory role of TACE has emerged only recently. It was reported that a substantial portion of pro-TNFα is not immediately processed by TACE but is rapidly internalized and either degraded in the lysosomes or recycled back to the plasma membrane (21Solomon K.A.

Apparently, the activity of TACE is also regulated. Cleavage of an autoinhibitory pro-domain is the first step of TACE activation (23Peiretti F. Canault M. Deprez-Beauclair P. Berthet V. Bonardo B. Juhan-Vague I. Nalbone G. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 285: 278-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The active form of TACE is localized primarily at the plasma membrane (24Doedens J.R.

Nakada K. Kobayashi Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 576-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). At the plasma membrane, TACE activity depends upon compartmentalization of the protein in the ordered lipid domains (26Tellier E. Canault M. Rebsomen L. Bonardo B. Juhan-Vague I. Nalbone G.

Whether TACE localization to the lipid rafts brings the enzyme close to its substrates or induces conformational change is also unknown. In addition, certain stimuli, like phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (24Doedens J.R. Black R.A. J. Biol.

A defect in Rab4 recycling pathway has been identified in dermal fibroblasts of patients with Niemann-Pick disease, type A, a condition characterized with low ASMase activity (46Choudhury A. Sharma D.K. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4500-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Together, these studies suggest that in addition to a role in signaling, ASMase might be involved in regulation of membrane fusion by regulating membrane fluidity and/or curvature.This study investigates the role of ASMase in regulation of TNFα production. Our results show that ASMase activity is a novel regulator of post-translational processing of TNFα in macrophages, which impacts TNFα secretion after LPS stimulation. We further found that ASMase-derived ceramide is inhibitor of TACE activity and also affects the intracellular fate of pro-TNFα.DISCUSSIONThis study provides evidence for the existence of a novel factor, ASMase, that regulates the rate of post-translational processing and secretion of TNFα during LPS stimulation. ASMase is known as a signaling enzyme that mediates several pathways activated by pro-inflammatory stimuli and by cellular stresses. More recent studies also suggest that ASMase participates in membrane biogenesis. The secretory form of ASMase is involved in organization of the signaling domains at the plasma membrane (57Gulbins E. Kolesnick R. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7070-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), although the endosomal/lysosomal form appears to facilitates intracellular membrane fusion and recycling pathways. Accumulation of sphingomyelin and cholesterol in the endosomal membranes of ASMase-deficient cells seems to impair the establishment of type I cytopathic vacuoles after alphavirus Sindbis virus infection and to interfere with proper maturation of phagosomes to phagolysosomes (44Ng C.G. Coppens I. Govindarajan D. Pisciotta J. Shulaev V. Griffin D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 16326-16331Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Evidence to that extent came from experiments indicating that asm−/− macrophages exhibit a slow rate of release of lysosomal hydrolyses to the phagosomes. Defects in the delivery of phagocytosed bacteria to phagolysosomes were also observed, resulting in less efficient pathogen elimination (42Utermöhlen O. Herz J. Schramm M. Krönke M. Immunobiology. 2008; 213: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 43Schramm M. Herz J. Haas A. Kronke M. Utermohlen O. Cell. Microbiol. 2008; 10: 1839-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the recently established role of ASMase in membrane biogenesis may impact the regulation of TNFα processing and secretion.Two distinct mechanisms seem to be involved. First, ASMase-derived ceramide apparently functions as a negative regulator of TACE activity. This is supported by the inhibition of TACE activity observed after treatment of macrophages with exogenous ceramide or bacterial SMase, both of which increase ceramide content of the plasma membrane. Consistently, the intrinsic activity of TACE was higher in asm−/− macrophages as compared with asm+/+ cells. Most likely, ceramide and ASMase modulate TACE activity by indirect mechanisms because ceramide was effective only when added to cultured cells, but not directly to the TACE assay mixture. As discussed earlier, TACE is a transmembrane protein, and its endogenous activity may depend on its lipid environment. Notably, Tellier et al. (26Tellier E. Canault M. Rebsomen L. Bonardo B. Juhan-Vague I. Nalbone G. Peiretti F. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 3969-3980Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) found that the mature form of TACE, but not the inactive pro-form, is localized in the sphingomyelin/cholesterol-rich domains and co-purifies with caveolin 1 and flotillin-1. These authors further suggested that sequestration of TACE in the sphingomyelin/cholesterol rafts is rate-limiting for its activity. This is in agreement with our conclusion that ASMase and ceramide control a rate-limiting step in TNFα processing. It is of particular interest that treatment with SMase that not only hydrolyzes sphingomyelin but also depletes the plasma membrane from cholesterol (58Slotte J.P. Bierman E.L. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) has an inhibitory effect of the endogenous TACE. It is possible that the elevated sphingomyelin (and cholesterol) in asm−/− cells creates a more “favorable” environment for TACE and higher activity.Second, a seemingly independent mode of regulation was revealed by our indirect immunofluorescent studies. These experiments suggest that ASMase also has an effect on the fate of intracellular pro-TNFα. It has already been proposed that the pro-TNFα, which is not immediately cleaved by TACE, is internalized and either degraded in the lysosomes or recycled back to the plasma membrane and utilized for TACE-mediated cleavage. Our results strongly support such a scenario and provide initial evidence that the partitioning of the nonprocessed TNFα between these two pathways is modulated and may have a profound effect on the levels of TNFα secreted in response to a particular stimulus.We found that asm−/− macrophages an have increased number of early endosomes suggesting a defect in the endosome maturation to lysosomes. This is consistent with previous studies implicating ASMase in the dynamics of vesicle fusion during endocytosis. Furthermore, the increased co-localization of EEA1 and TNFα in the absence of ASMase suggests that a significant portion of TNFα is sequestered in the early endosomes, recycled back to the plasma membrane, and cleaved by TACE. Further evidence for this came from the observation that inhibition of TACE by TAPI-1 caused significant elevation in intracellular TNFα and TNFα/EEA1 co-localization only in the asm−/− but not in the asm+/+ cells. In contrast, in asm+/+ cells only ammonium chloride treatment had an effect on intracellular TNFα. These observations indicate that a portion of intracellular TNFα, localized in the early endosomes, undergoes TACE-mediated cleavage in asm−/− cells but lysosomal clearance in asm+/+ cells.Membrane lipids and proteins can be moved from the early endosomes back to the cell surface via two main routes as follows: the Rab4-dependent fast recycling pathway, and the Rab11-mediated slow recycling pathway. Fibroblasts from patients with Niemann-Pick disease, type A, seem to lack the Rab4-mediated recycling but exhibit a more active Rab11-dependent pathway (46Choudhury A. Sharma D.K. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4500-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Therefore, the latter may be responsible for the increased TNFα recycling in asm−/− cells.Negative modulation of TLR signaling pathways has emerged as a critical mechanism of regulating the innate immune response to infection. In the case of TLR-4, several molecules whose expression is induced by LPS have been shown to attenuate and/or block cellular response to LPS, including IRAK-M, the suppressors of cytokine signaling, MyD88s (59Liew F.Y. Xu D. Brint E.K. O'Neill L.A. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 446-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar, 60O'Neill L.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2006; 18: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). This study provides evidence for a novel putative negative regulator of LPS-induced TNFα secretion, the ASMase. It is unclear which of the two known forms of ASMase, the secretory or the lysosomal, is involved. Because both forms are induced by LPS, one cannot exclude the possibility that the two forms have distinct roles in regulating TNFα secretion. The secretory ASMase might be responsible for regulation of TACE activity at the plasma membrane via its ability to act on sphingomyelin at the plasma membrane, although the lysosomal form might be linked to the defects in endosomal maturation. As discussed in the Introduction, loss-of-function in the lysosomal form is linked to slow phago-lysosomal fusion and membrane budding, as well as increased susceptibility to pathogen infections. These results indicate that cellular ASMase activity and/or ceramide content might have more important role(s) in regulating systemic inflammatory responses than previously thought by affecting the magnitude of TNFα release by the cells of the immune system and perhaps other TNFα-producing cells.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of the bacterial cell wall, is a potent inducer of TNFα production and the underlying signaling mechanisms are well understood. LPS binding to its cognitive receptor, MD-2, induces dimerization of the signaling Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4) and activation of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 (IRAK-1) in a myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-dependent manner.

In contrast, evidence for a regulatory role of TACE has emerged only recently. It was reported that a substantial portion of pro-TNFα is not immediately processed by TACE but is rapidly internalized and either degraded in the lysosomes or recycled back to the plasma membrane (21Solomon K.A. Covington M.B. DeCicco C.P. Newton R.C. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4524-4531PubMed Google Scholar, 22Shurety W. Pagan J.K. Prins J.B. Stow J.L. Lab. Invest. 2001; 81: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that TACE activity could be a rate-limiting step in TNFα secretion. Apparently, the activity of TACE is also regulated. Cleavage of an autoinhibitory pro-domain is the first step of TACE activation (23Peiretti F. Canault M. Deprez-Beauclair P. Berthet V. Bonardo B. Juhan-Vague I. Nalbone G. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 285: 278-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The active form of TACE is localized primarily at the plasma membrane (24Doedens J.R. Black R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14598-14607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), although activity toward TNFα has also been reported in the cytosol of some cells (25Watanabe N. Nakada K. Kobayashi Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 576-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). At the plasma membrane, TACE activity depends upon compartmentalization of the protein in the ordered lipid domains (26Tellier E. Canault M. Rebsomen L. Bonardo B. Juhan-Vague I. Nalbone G. Peiretti F. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 3969-3980Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 27Thiel K.W. Carpenter G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Whether TACE localization to the lipid rafts brings the enzyme close to its substrates or induces conformational change is also unknown. In addition, certain stimuli, like phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (24Doedens J.R. Black R.A. J. Biol.

Rearrangements of the NUP98 gene in human leukemia result in the expression of numerous fusion oncoproteins whose effect on nucleocytoplasmic trafficking is poorly understood. The present study was undertaken to determine the effects of leukemogenic NUP98 fusion proteins on CRM1-mediated nuclear export. NUP98-HOXA9, a prototypic NUP98 fusion, inhibited the nuclear export of two known CRM1 substrates: mutated cytoplasmic nucleophosmin and HIV-1 Rev. In vitro binding assays revealed that NUP98-HOXA9 binds CRM1 through the FG repeat motif in a Ran-GTP-dependent manner similar to but stronger than the interaction between CRM1 and its export substrates. Two NUP98 fusions, NUP98-HOXA9 and NUP98-DDX10, whose fusion partners are structurally and functionally unrelated, interacted with endogenous CRM1 in myeloid cells as shown by co-immunoprecipitation. These leukemogenic NUP98 fusion proteins interacted with CRM1, Ran, and the nucleoporin NUP214 in a manner fundamentally different from that of wild-type NUP98. NUP98-HOXA9 and NUP98-DDX10 formed characteristic aggregates within the nuclei of a myeloid cell line and primary human CD34+ cells and caused aberrant localization of CRM1 to these aggregates. These NUP98 fusions caused nuclear accumulation of two transcription factors, NFAT and NFκB, that are regulated by CRM1-mediated export. The nuclear entrapment of NFAT and NFκB correlated with enhanced transcription from promoters responsive to these transcription factors. Taken together, the results suggest a new mechanism by which NUP98 fusions dysregulate transcription and cause leukemia, namely, inhibition of CRM1-mediated nuclear export with aberrant nuclear retention of transcriptional regulators.

NUP98-HOXA9 and NUP98-DDX10 formed characteristic aggregates within the nuclei of a myeloid cell line and primary human CD34+ cells and caused aberrant localization of CRM1 to these aggregates. These NUP98 fusions caused nuclear accumulation of two transcription factors, NFAT and NFκB, that are regulated by CRM1-mediated export. The nuclear entrapment of NFAT and NFκB correlated with enhanced transcription from promoters responsive to these transcription factors. Taken together, the results suggest a new mechanism by which NUP98 fusions dysregulate transcription and cause leukemia, namely, inhibition of CRM1-mediated nuclear export with aberrant nuclear retention of transcriptional regulators."

These enzymes catalyze thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase reactions that are important in enzyme catalysis and in the maintenance of the correct thiol redox state in proteins. Dsb (disulfide bond) proteins are a specific of TRX-like proteins that are essential for the oxidative folding of secreted proteins in many Gram-negative bacteria (1Kadokura H. Katzen F. Beckwith J.

However, new studies on Dsb proteins in other bacteria show that these systems can vary considerably between different genera and even strains of the same species (12Dutton R.J. Boyd D. Berkmen M.

Significantly, there is growing evidence that a range of virulence-related functions depend on the strict redox control carried out by Dsb enzymes. Thus, these catalysts are required for the correct folding (and therefore function) of many secreted or surface exposed virulence determinants. Examples include, the flagellar P-ring motor protein FlgI, the secretin component of Type III secretion systems (T3SS) and a range of toxins and secreted enzymes (13Heras B. Shouldice S.R. Totsika M.

Microbiology. 2004; 150: 2993-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).The Gram-negative bacterium Salmonella enterica serovar (sv.) Typhimurium is an important causative agent of acute human gastroenteritis and can cause life-threatening bacteremia in immuno-compromised individuals (17Kankwatira A.M. Mwafulirwa G.A. Gordon M.A. Trop. Doct. 2004; 34: 198-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It is an intracellular pathogen that resides in macrophages. In addition to the oxidase and isomerase systems described above for E. coli K-12, sv. Typhimurium also has a DsbL/DsbI pair, similar to the uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) CFT073 DsbL/DsbI system (14Grimshaw J.P. Stirnimann C.U. Brozzo M.S. Malojcic G. Grütter M.G. Capitani G. Glockshuber R. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 380: 667-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 18Totsika M. Heras B. Wurpel D.J. Schembri M.A. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 3901-3908Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and a virulence plasmid-encoded DsbA-like protein, called SrgA (19Bouwman C.W. Kohli M. Killoran A. Touchie G.A. Kadner R.J. Martin N.L. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 991-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The sv. Typhimurium DsbA paralogues, termed SeDsbA, SeDsbL, and SeSrgA, share low sequence identity with each other (between 18 and 34%). They each contain different residues in the CXXC redox active site as well as in the cisProline. These differences suggest that the three DsbA paralogues have different functions and most likely act on different target protein(s). In support of this notion, characterization of SeDsbA and SeSrgA showed that these two disulfide oxidoreductases have specificity for different substrates (20Turcot I. Ponnampalam T.V. Bouwman C.W. Martin N.L. Can. J. Microbiol. 2001; 47: 711-721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SeSrgA is required for the biogenesis of the major structural subunit of the plasmid-encoded fimbriae, PefA (19Bouwman C.W. Kohli M. Killoran A. Touchie G.A. Kadner R.J. Martin N.L. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 991-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Together with SeDsbA it also catalyzes the folding of the outer membrane secretin SpiA, a component of the T3SS encoded in Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 2 (SPI2) (21Miki T. Okada N. Danbara H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34631-34642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). SeDsbA is required for the folding of FlgI (20Turcot I. Ponnampalam T.V. Bouwman C.W. Martin N.L. Can. J. Microbiol. 2001; 47: 711-721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and most likely many other periplasmic/secreted proteins. The change in the periplasmic redox state upon disruption of the dsbA gene also affects the expression of the SPI1 T3SS (22Lin D. Rao C.V. Slauch J.M. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Although no substrate is known for SeDsbL, this protein shares 93% sequence identity with its E. coli CFT073 orthologue, and could most likely fold the periplasmic enzyme arylsulfate sulfotransferase (AssT) (14Grimshaw J.P. Stirnimann C.U. Brozzo M.S. Malojcic G. Grütter M.G. Capitani G. Glockshuber R. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 380: 667-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Moreover, as in UPEC CFT073, the sv. Typhimurium assT gene is encoded immediately upstream of dsbL and dsbI. Despite these differences in substrate specificity, there is indication that some overlap also exists between the activities of SeDsbA, SeDsbL, and SeSrgA (21Miki T. Okada N. Danbara H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34631-34642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).The specificity of disulfide catalysis in Gram-negative pathogens with an extended collection of Dsb proteins remains mostly uncharacterized. To further investigate oxidative folding processes in these organisms we have focused on the three sv. Typhimurium DsbA paralogues. Here, we perform a structural, biochemical and functional characterization of SeDsbA, SeDsbL, and SeSrgA, which identifies important structural differences in areas surrounding the catalytic sites. These differences result in diverse redox properties and are likely to underline the distinct substrate specificities and redox functions.DISCUSSIONThe formation of disulfide bonds is a crucial step required for the correct folding of many secreted proteins such as bacterial virulence factors. In prokaryotes disulfide formation machineries show considerable diversity (12Dutton R.J. Boyd D. Berkmen M. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 11933-11938Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), particularly among Gram-negative microbes, which contain an extended arsenal of thiol-disulfide oxido-reductases (14Grimshaw J.P. Stirnimann C.U. Brozzo M.S. Malojcic G. Grütter M.G. Capitani G. Glockshuber R. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 380: 667-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 15Lafaye C. Iwema T. Carpentier P. Jullian-Binard C. Kroll J.S. Collet J.F. Serre L. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 392: 952-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), underscoring the relevance of redox control in these organisms.In this study we have carried out a comprehensive analysis of the sv. Typhimurium oxidative pathway. Unlike prototypic E. coli K-12, which encodes a single thiol oxidase (EcDsbA), sv. Typhimurium possesses three DsbA homologues. Structural characterization of SeDsbA, SeDsbL, and SeSrgA has shown that they all have the canonical EcDsbA fold consisting of a TRX domain that incorporates a helical insertion. Despite this, the three DsbA paralogues share low sequence identity and it is therefore not surprising that they contain unique structural and enzymatic properties. SeDsbA retains all the surface features of the E. coli homologue (44Martin J.L. Bardwell J.C. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1993; 365: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), including a hydrophobic groove that binds the key partner protein DsbB (45Inaba K. Murakami S. Suzuki M. Nakagawa A. Yamashita E. Okada K. Ito K. Cell. 2006; 127: 789-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). SeDsbA is postulated to interact with unfolded peptides (44Martin J.L. Bardwell J.C. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1993; 365: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) and possesses a broad hydrophobic region surrounding the active site. SeSrgA and particularly SeDsbL differ from SeDsbA in that they have truncated peptide binding grooves and positively charged surfaces surrounding the active site (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3) Additionally, SeDsbL incorporates long loops in the helical domain, including the one linking α3 and α4 (Fig. 2C), which is lined with negatively charged residues and generates an acidic protrusion that maps near the redox catalytic site (Fig. 3).SeSrgA, SeDsbA, and SeDsbL have markedly different oxidizing strengths (Fig. 4). SeSrgA, with an Eo′ of −154 mV, is one of the most reducing DsbA proteins characterized (Wolbachia pipientis α-DsbA1 being the most reducing one, Eo′ −163 mV (50Kurz M. Iturbe-Ormaetxe I. Jarrott R. Shouldice S.R. Wouters M.A. Frei P. Glockshuber R. Oneill S.L. Heras B. Martin J.L. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2009; 11: 1485-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar)). SeDsbA is as strong an oxidant as EcDsbA (Eo′ −126 mV and −122 mV, respectively (11Huber-Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Fold. Des. 1998; 3: 161-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar)), while SeDsbL (Eo′ −97 mV) is together with the three Neisserial DsbA homologues (redox potentials of −80 mV) (15Lafaye C. Iwema T. Carpentier P. Jullian-Binard C. Kroll J.S. Collet J.F. Serre L. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 392: 952-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and DsbL from uropathogenic E. coli CFT073 (Eo′ −90 mV) (14Grimshaw J.P. Stirnimann C.U. Brozzo M.S. Malojcic G. Grütter M.G. Capitani G. Glockshuber R. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 380: 667-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) one of the most oxidizing proteins so far characterized. Moreover, the reactivity of the nucleophilic cysteine also varies across the three Salmonella proteins (Fig. 4). As expected from their intrinsic redox potentials, SeDsbA and SeDsbL contain very acidic cysteines (pKa values, 3.6 and 3.8, respectively) and the more reducing SeSrgA has a less reactive cysteine with a pKa similar to that of isomerases like DsbC (8Ren G. Stephan D. Xu Z. Zheng Y. Tang D. Harrison R.S. Kurz M. Jarrott R. Shouldice S.R. Hiniker A. Martin J.L. Heras B. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 10150-10159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) (pKa 4.7 and 4.6, respectively).The different redox properties of SeSrgA seem to be mainly dictated by the dipeptide in the active site. The histidine residue in the Cys-Pro-His-Cys motif of EcDsbA plays a key role in determining the oxidizing properties of this protein and substitution of this residue with a proline dramatically increases the pKa of the nucleophilic cysteine and reduces the oxidizing strength of EcDsbA (11Huber-Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Fold. Des. 1998; 3: 161-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In the same way, SeSrgA, which naturally has a proline instead of a histidine in the catalytic site (Cys-Pro-Pro-Cys), is more reducing than EcDsbA or SeDsbA and contains a much less reactive active site cysteine. In the case of SeDsbL, the cluster of positively charged residues surrounding the Cys-Pro-Phe-Cys active site likely stabilize the thiolate form of the protein which results in a decreased pKa of the nucleophilic active site cysteine and an increase in the redox potential.The structural differences and divergent redox properties suggest that the three DsbA proteins encoded by sv. Typhimurium may have different substrate specificities and redox function. Indeed, these proteins have distinct in vitro oxidoreductase activity; SeSrgA is a strong insulin reductase, with an activity similar to that of the disulfide isomerase EcDsbC, SeDsbA is as active as EcDsbA in this assay and SeDsbL did not show any insulin reductase activity (Fig. 4). Despite some similarities between the biochemical properties of SeSrgA and EcDsbC, in vitro we found no activity for disulfide bond isomerase in SeSrgA or in any of the Salmonella DsbA proteins (data not shown).To further investigate the functional properties of SeDsbA, SeDsbL, and SeSrgA, we examined their expression and target specificity in the context of a sv. Typhimurium background. We were able to detect expression of SeDsbA and SeSrgA, but not SeDsbL. The lack of SeDsbL expression is consistent with a previous report that examined SeDsbL expression in uropathogenic E. coli (18Totsika M. Heras B. Wurpel D.J. Schembri M.A. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 3901-3908Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). All three oxidoreductases were able to restore motility and Pef fimbriae production in the sv. Typhimurium triple mutant SL1344dsbA,dsbLI,srgA. In contrast, DsbL exhibited target specificity for AssT.In conclusion, although SeSrgA, SeDsbA, and SeDsbL share the same overall fold, structural differences between these proteins (mainly localized in the redox active site and peptide binding interface) imply that they may target different substrates and have distinct functionality. Biochemical characterization confirmed these postulations, since SeSrgA, SeDsbA, and SeDsbL have different redox strengths, the reactivity of their surface exposed cysteine varies and they show dissimilar oxido-reductase activity in vitro. Despite some degree of functional redundancy, SeDsbA, SeDsbL, and SeSrgA therefore represent thiol oxidases that cover a wide range of structural and biochemical properties to efficiently catalyze the oxidative folding of target proteins. During sv. Typhimurium infection, SeDsbA, SeDsbL, and SeSrgA are probably under differential temporal and spatial regulation and this, together with their different degree of target specificity, emphasizes the importance of this critical folding step in bacterial survival and virulence.

Glockshuber R. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 380: 667-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 18Totsika M. Heras B. Wurpel D.J. Schembri M.A. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 3901-3908Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and a virulence plasmid-encoded DsbA-like protein, called SrgA (19Bouwman C.W. Kohli M. Killoran A. Touchie G.A. Kadner R.J. Martin N.L. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 991-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The sv. Typhimurium DsbA paralogues, termed SeDsbA, SeDsbL, and SeSrgA, share low sequence identity with each other (between 18 and 34%). They each contain different residues in the CXXC redox active site as well as in the cisProline. These differences suggest that the three DsbA paralogues have different functions and most likely act on different target protein(s). In support of this notion, characterization of SeDsbA and SeSrgA showed that these two disulfide oxidoreductases have specificity for different substrates (20Turcot I. Ponnampalam T.V. Bouwman C.W. Martin N.L. Can. J. Microbiol. 2001; 47: 711-721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SeSrgA is required for the biogenesis of the major structural subunit of the plasmid-encoded fimbriae, PefA (19Bouwman C.W. Kohli M. Killoran A. Touchie G.A. Kadner R.J. Martin N.L. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 991-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Together with SeDsbA it also catalyzes the folding of the outer membrane secretin SpiA, a component of the T3SS encoded in Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 2 (SPI2) (21Miki T. Okada N. Danbara H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34631-34642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). SeDsbA is required for the folding of FlgI (20Turcot I. Ponnampalam T.V. Bouwman C.W. Martin N.L. Can. J. Microbiol. 2001; 47: 711-721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and most likely many other periplasmic/secreted proteins. The change in the periplasmic redox state upon disruption of the dsbA gene also affects the expression of the SPI1 T3SS (22Lin D. Rao C.V. Slauch J.M. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Although no substrate is known for SeDsbL, this protein shares 93% sequence identity with its E. coli CFT073 orthologue, and could most likely fold the periplasmic enzyme arylsulfate sulfotransferase (AssT) (14Grimshaw J.P. Stirnimann C.U. Brozzo M.S. Malojcic G. Grütter M.G. Capitani G. Glockshuber R. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 380: 667-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Moreover, as in UPEC CFT073, the sv. Typhimurium assT gene is encoded immediately upstream of dsbL and dsbI. Despite these differences in substrate specificity, there is indication that some overlap also exists between the activities of SeDsbA, SeDsbL, and SeSrgA (21Miki T. Okada N. Danbara H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34631-34642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).The specificity of disulfide catalysis in Gram-negative pathogens with an extended collection of Dsb proteins remains mostly uncharacterized. To further investigate oxidative folding processes in these organisms we have focused on the three sv. Typhimurium DsbA paralogues. Here, we perform a structural, biochemical and functional characterization of SeDsbA, SeDsbL, and SeSrgA, which identifies important structural differences in areas surrounding the catalytic sites. These differences result in diverse redox properties and are likely to underline the distinct substrate specificities and redox functions.

These enzymes catalyze thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase reactions that are important in enzyme catalysis and in the maintenance of the correct thiol redox state in proteins. Dsb (disulfide bond) proteins are a specific of TRX-like proteins that are essential for the oxidative folding of secreted proteins in many Gram-negative bacteria (1Kadokura H. Katzen F. Beckwith J.

https://openalex.org/W2015408902,"ClpP is a serine protease whose active sites are sequestered in a cavity enclosed between two heptameric rings of subunits. The ability of ClpP to process folded protein substrates depends on its being partnered by an AAA+ ATPase/unfoldase, ClpA or ClpX. In active complexes, substrates are unfolded and fed along an axial channel to the degradation chamber inside ClpP. We have used cryoelectron microscopy at ∼11-Å resolution to investigate the three-dimensional structure of ClpP complexed with either one or two end-mounted ClpA hexamers. In the absence of ClpA, the apical region of ClpP is sealed; however, it opens on ClpA binding, creating an access channel. This region is occupied by the N-terminal loops (residues 1–17) of ClpP, which tend to be poorly visible in crystal structures, indicative of conformational variability. Nevertheless, we were able to model the closed-to-open transition that accompanies ClpA binding in terms of movements of these loops; in particular, “up” conformations of the loops correlate with the open state. The main part of ClpP, the barrel formed by 14 copies of residues 18–193, is essentially unchanged by the interaction with ClpA. Using difference mapping, we localized the binding site for ClpA to a peripheral pocket between adjacent ClpP subunits. Based on these observations, we propose that access to the ClpP degradation chamber is controlled allosterically by hinged movements of its N-terminal loops, which the symmetry-mismatched binding of ClpA suffices to induce.

Controlled proteolysis is essential for homeostasis in living cells, by serving to eliminate damaged or misfolded proteins and to limit correctly folded proteins to appropriate levels (1Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Gottesman S. Science. 1999; 286: 1888-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). Intracellular protein degradation is carried by bi-partite proteases such as the 26 S proteasome in eukaryotes and ClpAP in bacteria (2Striebel F. Kress W. Weber-Ban E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2009; 19: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In bacteria (and in mitochondria and chloroplasts), protein turnover is achieved in part by members of the Clp family (clp = caseinolytic protease), including ClpAP, ClpXP, and ClpYQ (HslUV) (3Gottesman S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 565-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 4Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 647-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). These proteases all consist of a ring-like regulatory component (e.g. ClpA) mounted coaxially on a barrel-shaped peptidase (e.g. ClpP). The regulator recognizes, binds, and unfolds valid substrates and translocates them into the peptidase for degradation. The regulator is (in ClpA) or includes (in the proteasome) a hexameric AAA+ unfoldase (5Snider J. Houry W.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2008; 36: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 6Erzberger J.P. Berger J.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2006; 35: 93-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Although most of the more sophisticated functions of the protease (e.g. substrate selection) are assigned to the unfoldase, often in conjunction with associated factors (7Flynn J.M. Neher S.B. Kim Y.I. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 671-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 8Mogk A. Dougan D. Weibezahn J. Schlieker C. Turgay K. Bukau B. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 146: 90-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the peptidase also has additional responsibilities. In particular, it may help to assemble the regulatory particle, and it must exclude all but specifically targeted substrates from the active sites to avoid damage to the surrounding proteome. Selected substrates, once unfolded, are thought to be threaded into the peptidase as linear polypeptides; however, experiments in the ClpXP system with cross-linked model substrates (9Burton R.E. Siddiqui S.M. Kim Y.I. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3092-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) have indicated that a wider bundle of two or three polypeptide chains can enter the ClpP degradation chamber. These considerations invoke the existence of a gating mechanism, raising the questions of how such a gate is formed and how it is regulated. Escherichia coli ClpP is a tetradecameric barrel-shaped enzyme (10Kessel M. Maurizi M.R. Kim B. Kocsis E. Trus B.L. Singh S.K. Steven A.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), formed by head-to-head stacking of two heptameric rings (11Wang J. Hartling J.A. Flanagan J.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 447-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Alone, ClpP can slowly degrade small peptides but requires the cooperation of ClpA or ClpX to process larger peptides or unfolded proteins and to process folded proteins (12Thompson M.W. Singh S.K.

Biol. 2004; 148: 338-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The organization of the 21-kDa hatchet-shaped subunit is quite well conserved: it has three subdomains: a “handle,” a globular “head,” and an N-terminal loop. The handles interdigitate at the interface between the two rings, and the heads form the main body of the barrel (the catalytic serines are on the inside at the handle-head junction) (24Maurizi M.R. Clark W.P. Kim S.H. Gottesman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12546-12552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The N-loops are associated with the axial region but are somewhat enigmatic: in several crystal structures, they are partially or completely untraceable and thus have been conceived to be elements that are either mobile or do not fully comply with 7-fold symmetry. N-loops that have been seen in crystal structures have been classified in two groups: in the “up” conformation, a β-hairpin motif extends outward in an axial direction (20Gribun A. Kimber M.S. Ching R. Sprangers R. Fiebig K.M. Houry W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16185-16196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 21Szyk A. Maurizi M.R. J. Struct.

Biol. 2006; 153: 113-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), whereas the “down” conformation is less well defined but appears to involve hairpins in orientations approximately perpendicular to the 7-fold axis (22Bewley M.C. Graziano V. Griffin K. Flanagan J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 2006; 153: 113-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The near axial region that they occupy makes it likely that the N-terminal regions of ClpP subunits play a role in gating the channel. The existence of a gating mechanism is suggested by several lines of evidence. Removal of 7 or more residues from the N terminus of ClpP provides greatly increased access to peptides of 8–30 residues (25Jennings L.D. Bohon J. Chance M.R. Licht S. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 11031-11040Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Moreover, deletion of 14 amino acids from the N terminus allows even large unfolded proteins to be degraded rapidly (26Bewley M.C. Graziano V. Griffin K. Flanagan J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 2009; 165: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These data imply that low peptidase activity is due to blockage of the axial channel by the N-terminal portions of ClpP. Gating is also suggested by the existence of allosteric mechanisms for increasing access to the degradation chamber. Binding of ClpA and ClpX in the absence of ATP hydrolysis is sufficient to increase accessibility for moderate sized peptides and to increase their cleavage rate by >50-fold (12Thompson M.W. Singh S.K. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18209-18215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Thompson M.W. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18201-18208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Even more dramatically, binding of an antibiotic acyldepsipeptide in the absence of ClpA or ClpX allows ClpP to degrade unfolded proteins at rates comparable with the ClpA- or ClpX-activated rates (28Brötz-Oesterhelt H. Beyer D. Kroll H.P. Endermann R. Ladel C. Schroeder W. Hinzen B. Raddatz S. Paulsen H. Henninger K. Bandow J.E. Sahl H.G. Labischinski H. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 1082-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). A recent study by synchrotron hydroxyl radical footprinting (25Jennings L.D. Bohon J. Chance M.R. Licht S. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 11031-11040Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) reported that the N-loops become more solvent-exposed upon ClpA binding, a shift that would be consistent with ClpP opening upon ClpA attachment. Other studies have also attributed to them a role in ClpA/ClpX binding (20Gribun A. Kimber M.S. Ching R. Sprangers R. Fiebig K.M. Houry W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16185-16196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 22Bewley M.C. Graziano V. Griffin K. Flanagan J.M. J. Struct.

Although a considerable amount of high resolution structural information has been compiled on ClpP, the 6:7 symmetry mismatch between ClpA and ClpP (29Beuron F. Maurizi M.R. Belnap D.M. Kocsis E. Booy F.P. Kessel M. Steven A.C. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 123: 248-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) has hindered crystallographic analysis of ClpAP complexes. In this study, we have used cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) 2The abbreviations used are: cryo-EMcryoelectron microscopyEMelectron microscopyPDBProtein Data BankPANproteasome-activating nucleotidase. to visualize ClpAP, aiming to gain insight into ClpP as complexed with ClpA and the structural changes that their interaction may entail.

ClpA and ClpP were expressed and purified as described (30Maurizi M.R. Thompson M.W. Singh S.K. Kim S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 314-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 31Singh S.K.

ClpAP complexes were assembled by mixing ClpP tetradecamers and preassembled ClpA hexamers in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2 to final concentrations of ∼70 μg/ml (ClpP) and ∼120 μg/ml (ClpA). 3-μl drops of sample were applied to EM grids bearing holey carbon films. Excess fluid was then blotted away, and the grid quenched in liquid ethane, using a KF80 (Leica) or a Vitrobot (FEI) cryostation. Specimens were then transferred into a Philips CM200 FEG electron microscope, and focal pairs were recorded on Kodak SO-163 film under low dose conditions at 120 kV and ×38,000 magnification. Preprocessing of images was carried with the Bsoft package (33Heymann J.B. Belnap D.M. J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 157: 3-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Micrographs were first screened for the absence of drift or astigmatism and for showing a large proportion of ClpAP side views. Selected negatives were digitized on a Zeiss scanner at 7-μm step, giving 1.84 Å/pixel at the specimen. Separate particle sets were picked for the 1:1 and the 2:1 complex, using the further-from-focus image of each pair. Picked images were normalized and subjected to CTF correction, by phase flipping for orientation and with base-line correction added, for reconstruction. To extract the ClpP parts of the ClpAP complexes, several cycles of classification by multivariate statistical analysis, averaging, and multireference alignment were performed in SPIDER (34Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar), as described previously (35Adams P. Kandiah E. Effantin G. Steven A.C. Ehrenfeld E. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 22012-22021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 36Effantin G. Rosenzweig R. Glickman M.H. Steven A.C. J. Mol.

Nature. 2007; 449: 1063-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). To the aligned images, a rectangular mask centered on ClpP but including ∼25% of ClpA (when present) was applied. Data sets comprising 5132 (1982) focal pair images of the ClpP-containing portions of 1:1 (2:1) complexes were thus compiled and then used for three-dimensional reconstruction in SPIDER. As a check against reference bias, two different starting models were used in the projection-matching scheme. One was a 7-fold-symmetrized two-dimensional class average representing a ClpP side view as determined by the two-dimensional classification described above. The second was a ClpP crystal structure (11Wang J. Hartling J.A. Flanagan J.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 447-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), band limited to 20 Å. Both led to the same final structure. A first three-dimensional reconstruction was calculated using only the further-from-focus images; once a stable model was obtained, focal pairs were used. The sampling grid used in projection matching was reduced progressively to 3° intervals as orientations were refined until no significant improvement in resolution was observed from one cycle to the next. Phase-flipped images were used for projection matching and for back-projection-based reconstruction until the last few iterations where the CTF baseline-corrected images were used for reconstruction. With a priori knowledge that we were dealing with ClpP molecules in orientations close to side views, only particles with the Euler angle θ in the range 60 < θ < 90° were accepted for reconstruction. The final resolution determined by Fourier shell correlation at 0.5 (0.3) cutoff was 11.3 (10.0) Å for the 1:1 and 12.2 (11.6) Å for the 2:1 map. The various ClpP crystal structures used in this study were fitted into the cryo-EM density maps in Chimera (38Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (29006) Google Scholar). ClpP tetradecamers were manually inserted into the EM maps, and their positions were locally refined, automatically, using the Fit in Map option. All manipulations and modifications of crystal structures were also done in Chimera. Density maps of the various crystal structures at reduced resolution were calculated in EMAN (39Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2110) Google Scholar) with the pdb2mrc command. For difference mapping, radial profiles for the resolution-limited density maps from crystal structures and the cryo-EM reconstructions were calculated using bradial in Bsoft (33Heymann J.B. Belnap D.M. J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 157: 3-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Maps were then scaled relative to the 1:1 reconstruction, and difference maps were generated in SPIDER (34Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar). ClpAP complexes were formed by mixing equimolar amounts of ClpP tetradecamers and hexamers of ClpA, and cryo-EM data were acquired (e.g. Fig. 1a). These conditions give a majority of “1:1 complexes” with ClpA bound at one end of ClpP, but also some “2:1 complexes” with ClpA at both ends. We observed them in a ratio of ∼5:2 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Three-dimensional reconstructions of the ClpP-containing portions of both complexes were calculated, applying 7-fold symmetry. The 1:1 complex allowed us to compare the ClpA-bound and ClpA-free halves of the ClpP tetradecamer under identical imaging conditions. The 2:1 complexes allowed us to assess the reproducibility of the structure visualized at the ClpA-bound end. Because of a larger data set, the 1:1 map reached a slightly higher resolution, 11.3 Å versus 12.2 Å for the 2:1 map (supplemental Fig. 1). To avoid truncating ClpP when images were masked out from side views of ClpAP complexes, the masking window used was somewhat longer than ClpP (120 versus 90 Å). In consequence, a small part of ClpA was included (when present), and we observed rings of density from this source on the apical surface of ClpP in both reconstructions. This ring is peripherally located at a radius of ∼30 Å from the symmetry axis (Fig. 1, b and d). Because ClpA is a hexamer, the 7-fold symmetry of this feature is artifactual; nevertheless, it allowed us to identify the interaction site between ClpA and ClpP in a molecular model (see below). Apart from these densities, the most striking difference between the two ends of the 1:1 complex is the presence of an axial channel at the ClpA-bound end (Fig. 1e); in contrast, this region is closed on the ClpA-free end (Fig. 1f). Otherwise, the two ClpP rings are essentially indistinguishable (cf. Fig. 1d). In the 2:1 reconstruction, an opening similar to that seen at the ClpA-bound end of the 1:1 complex is observed at both ends (e.g. Fig. 1c). We note that D7 symmetry was imposed in the reconstruction only at a late stage, after confirming that both ends had a consistent appearance in a C7 reconstruction in which they were calculated separately (data not shown). Likewise, the structures visualized for both halves of the 2:1 complex (with C7 symmetry) tallied closely with the ClpA-bound part of the 1:1 complex, establishing its reproducibility. Except for the markedly different axial region and the ring of ClpA-associated density, there were no discernible differences between the ClpP heptamers at the ClpA-bound and ClpA-free ends (Fig. 1, b and d). When crystal structure(s) for the barrel formed by 14 copies of residues 18–193 (from Ref. 11Wang J. Hartling J.A. Flanagan J.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 447-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) of ClpP were fitted into the density maps of both the 1:1 (Fig. 2, a–d) and 2:1 (not shown in Fig. 2, but see Fig. 4) complexes, excellent agreement was obtained. At the ClpA-free end of the 1:1 complex, the reconstruction has unoccupied density only in its near axial region (Fig. 2b, orange oval, and Fig. 2d). Accordingly, and because residue 18 is immediately adjacent to this density (Fig. 2c), the observed axial closure of ClpP is attributable to its N-terminal regions (residues 1–17). At the ClpA-bound end, unoccupied density is limited to the ring of peripheral densities. However, these densities are too far from residue 18 to be contributed by N-terminal regions of ClpP (cf. Fig. 2b), further confirming that they are ClpA-derived.FIGURE 4Point of contact of ClpA on the surface of ClpP. a and b, axial (a) and side view (b) representations of the interaction between the ClpA and ClpP rings.

At the ClpA-bound ends of both complexes, the axial channel is reproducibly present but appears narrower (∼12 Å across) than in the surface renderings. In fact, this 12-Å channel is surrounded by a sleeve of density that, although significantly above background, is below the contour level used for rendering and therefore is not detected in that representation (Figs. 1, c and e, and 2b). This sleeve of density is pointed out by red arrows in Fig. 3a and outlined by a red contour in the upper enlarged box in Fig. 3a; the green contour outlines ClpA-associated density and the black contour, the ClpP barrel. It is noteworthy that the sleeve extends ∼15 Å beyond the apical surface of the barrel. When gray scale sections through crystal structures for the barrel are viewed at similar resolution (e.g.1tyf in Fig. 3b), a wider channel, ∼25 Å across, is seen; elsewhere, there is good agreement with the cryo-EM density maps. It follows that the channel-blocking density at the ClpA-free end of the 1:1 complex and the density sleeve surrounding the channel at ClpA-bound end are both contributed by the N-terminal regions (residues 1–17), distributed differently. At the ClpA-free end, this density forms a bolus, ∼30 Å thick (blue bar in Fig. 3a and blue contour in the bottom enlarged box), that protrudes only slightly beyond the apical surface of the barrel and into the internal cavity. In most ClpP crystal structures, the N-terminal regions are visualized incompletely if at all (11Wang J. Hartling J.A. Flanagan J.M.

Griffin K. Flanagan J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 2006; 153: 113-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 1yg6), which was solved without applying 7-fold symmetry, different structures were observed at the two ends of the tetradecamer. At one end, six of the seven N-terminal regions were seen to extend distally in a β-hairpin (N-loop) conformation, whose tip protrudes 10–15 Å beyond the apical surface (Fig. 3d, red loops); this was called the up conformation. The seventh N-loop had the same β-hairpin fold but lay in a different, nonprotruding, position (Fig. 3d, magenta arrowhead); this was called the down conformation. Because this N-loop and side chains from another one lay across the channel, this conformation was proposed to represent a closed state of the channel. At the other end of ClpP, all seven N-loops, albeit incompletely visualized, appeared to be in down conformations (Fig. 3d, magenta loops), and were taken to represent an open state of the channel. However, our reconstruction implies that the open and closed ends should be assigned in the opposite manner, i.e. the channel is open when the loops are up. To allow closer comparison with the cryo-EM map, we calculated 7-fold-symmetrized representations of this crystal structure of ClpP and band-limited them to 12-Å resolution (Fig. 3b, 1yg6). The periaxial density at the up end matched well with the ClpP ring at the ClpA-bound end of the EM map in terms of the bore of the axial channel (∼12 Å), and the surrounding sleeve of density, although the latter feature is more strongly contrasted in the simulation (Fig. 3b, 1yg6, red arrows). Excluding chain C (the single loop in down conformation) makes little difference to the simulation (Fig. 3b, cf. 7Nls and 6Nls), and it cannot be determined whether the cryo-EM density map conveys one (or a few) N-loops in down conformations. At the other end of the simulated section, the channel appears wider (Fig. 3b, 1yg6), and this feature is not consistent with the cryo-EM density at either end of the complex and, in particular, with the blocked channel at the ClpA-free end (cf. Fig. 3a, blue bar, versus Fig. 3b, bottom halves). However, the simulation accounts for only 34% of the N-loop density that should be present (41 of 119 amino acids). The most straightforward interpretation of the cryo-EM density in this region is that it represents distributions of N-loops in conformations that are somewhat variable (and thus not seen in the crystal structure), but definitely different from the up conformation that prevails at the other end of the complex. Our density map does not allow these conformations to be specified, but we have modeled two possible distributions of nonoverlapping N-loops that retain the β-hairpin motif but pivot variably about a hinge at residue 18 and adequately reproduce the cryo-EM density (Fig. 3c, models 1 and 2, blue bars). We followed the same procedure with two other crystal structures, from E. coli (PDB 2fzs) (21Szyk A. Maurizi M.R. J. Struct. Biol. 2006; 156: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and Saccharomyces pneumoniae (PDB 1y7o) (20Gribun A. Kimber M.S. Ching R. Sprangers R. Fiebig K.M. Houry W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16185-16196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), which show seven N-loops in an up conformation but are missing some residues at the tip of the hairpin. Again, when gray scale sections are compared, the simulations reproduce a channel very similar to the one seen by cryo-EM at the ClpA-bound end (supplemental Fig. 2). They differ slightly in the density surrounding the channel; in the case of 2fzs, these features are shorter, consistent with the absence of the loop tips in this structure. As described above, the 7-fold-symmetrized reconstructions show a ring of ClpA-derived density on the apical surface of ClpP (Fig. 1, b and d). Because ClpA is a hexamer, these rings are almost annular (supplemental Fig. 3); nevertheless, they show a slight 7-fold modulation, and we take their maxima to mark positions on ClpP where ClpA can bind. To localize and accentuate these maxima, we generated a difference map between the 2:1 reconstruction and the ClpP crystal structure band-limited to 12 Å resolution and sharpened its edges by surface rendering; in this image, discrete difference densities are seen around the ClpP periphery (green densities in Fig. 4). When the difference densities, the cryo-EM map and the docked ClpP crystal structure are superimposed (Fig. 4, a and b), they depict ClpA as binding at the interface between two ClpP monomers. This interaction has been proposed, on other grounds, to be mediated by a ClpA loop containing a conserved “IGL” motif (31Singh S.K. Rozycki J. Ortega J. Ishikawa T. Lo J. Steven A.C. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29420-29429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 40Kim Y.I. Levchenko I. Fraczkowska K. Woodruff R.V. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). This loop was not seen in the crystal structure of ClpA (32Guo F. Maurizi M.R. Esser L. Xia D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46743-46752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and was therefore assumed to be disordered. We infer that it becomes structured upon binding to ClpP and surmise that its initial plasticity may allow more than one interaction on the same complex, despite the symmetry mismatch, as proposed for the related ClpX chaperone (41Effantin G. Ishikawa T. De Donatis G. Maurizi M.R. Steven A.C. Structure. 2010; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The binding site on ClpP involves a small cavity between the adjacent subunits (Fig. 4c). The residues at this site include Phe-112, which was shown by mutagenesis to be an important ClpP residue for ClpA interaction (22Bewley M.C. Graziano V. Griffin K. Flanagan J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 2006; 153: 113-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We conclude that ClpA binds to ClpP via its IGL motif(s) at a peripheral site on the ClpP apical surface, and this interaction elicits a conformational change in the axial region of the same ClpP ring, opening a channel through it. In this transition, most or all of the seven N-loops are displaced from their original positions, where they block the channel (Fig. 2b, red arrow and orange oval, and Fig. 3a, blue bar). When crystal structures that depict configurations of N-loops, most or all in up conformations, are matched with ClpA-bound ClpP rings in cryo-EM reconstructions, which we take to represent the open state of the gated pore, - there is good agreement (cf. Fig. 3, a and b; see also supplemental Fig. 2). We infer, therefore, that this part of these crystal structures also represents the open state of the gated pore or conformations close to it. The channel-blocking density seen at the ClpA-free end of the 1:1 complex indicates that in solution and in the absence of ClpA or any other “activator,” the pore is closed. None of the crystal structures shows the axial channel as fully blocked, but if the incomplete N-loops at the down end of the 1yg6 structure were to be completed, the channel could be blocked, as seen in the cryo-EM reconstruction and as modeled in Fig. 3c. To account for the open-like conformations of most of the ClpP rings visualized in crystal structures, we suppose that crystal contacts between ClpP barrels may exert forces on each other that mimic the allosteric interaction with ClpA, causing the channel to open. We note also that the up conformation of the N-loop in some subunits is stabilized by lattice contacts with adjacent molecules (22Bewley M.C. Graziano V. Griffin K. Flanagan J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 2006; 153: 113-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Even in cases where some (faint) density is seen close to or in the channel, it may not offer much resistance to the entry of forcefully translocated substrates unless the motifs involved are firmly clamped in place; i.e. such density may represent the molecular equivalent of a “beaded curtain” across a doorway that may be easily brushed aside. We suggest that the “sleeve” densities around the open channel (contributed by residues 11–17 of the N-loops) are similarly movable, so as to allow the entry of substrates wider than a single extended polypeptide chain (9Burton R.E. Siddiqui S.M. Kim Y.I. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3092-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In this context, we propose that the effective diameter of the open channel is a somewhat variable quantity, adaptable from a minimum of the 12 Å seen in the cryo-EM and crystal structures to a maximum of 25 Å, as delimited by the core domains (Fig. 3b, 1tyf panel). In our cryo-EM reconstructions, the ClpA peripheral interaction between two ClpP monomers is the only direct contact we could observe. Nevertheless, major changes in the conformations of the N-loops, ∼25 Å away, accompany the attachment of ClpA. It follows that ClpA binding is somehow sensed by ClpP and communicated to the axial region occupied by the N-loops. Another factor that could favor the open conformation for the N-terminal loops would be an axial interaction with D2 the ClpP-proximal AAA+ domains of ClpA (41Effantin G. Ishikawa T. De Donatis G. Maurizi M.R. Steven A.C. Structure. 2010; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). For ClpX, it was shown by cross-linking experiments that the N-loops interact with a pore loop of ClpX (42Martin A. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 41-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Mutations in residues at the tip of the N-loop also affect the stability of ClpAP and ClpXP complexes (22Bewley M.C. Graziano V. Griffin K. Flanagan J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 2006; 153: 113-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Although our density maps of ClpP do not point to strong axial contact between ClpP and ClpA, they do not rule out some such interaction, particularly if it were to be dynamic and to involve only one or a few N-loops at a time. Bipartite proteases consisting of a regulatory complex attached to a peptidase, as in ClpAP, are quite widespread (3Gottesman S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 565-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Among other shared properties, they employ gating mechanisms that restrict access to the proteolytic chamber. A conserved mode of interaction in E. coli HslUV and the 26 S or 20 S/11 S proteasome complexes involves the insertion of C termini of regulatory protein subunits between adjacent subunits of the peptidase. It resembles the peripheral interaction of ClpA between two ClpP monomers except that ClpA interacts through a tripeptide part of a flexible loop. The 11 S activator induces channel opening on the 20 S proteasome by a second axial interaction via an insertion peptide that contacts the 20 S N-terminal loops (43Förster A. Masters E.I. Whitby F.G. Robinson H. Hill C.P. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 589-599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 44Förster A. Whitby F.G. Hill C.P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4356-4364Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). On the other hand, gate opening by the archeal ATPase PAN can be mimicked simply by the 20 S particle binding an octapeptide corresponding to the PAN C-terminal region, an observation that excludes the requirement for any axial interaction with the PAN ATPase domain (45Smith D.M. Chang S.C. Park S. Finley D. Cheng Y. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 731-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 46Rabl J. Smith D.M. Yu Y. Chang S.C. Goldberg A.L. Cheng Y. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 360-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Additionally, PAN binding which, as in ClpAP, features a 6:7 symmetry mismatch causes a small rigid-body rotation of each 20 S α-subunit, whereas 11 S binding leaves them nearly unchanged. It appears, therefore, that the interaction between peptidase and regulatory complex has mechanistically similar elements in ClpAP and the proteasome, although the details of execution may differ. Such underlying similarity correlates well with our observation that the main interaction between ClpA and ClpP takes place at the periphery. A second, axial, interaction helps to stabilize the complex and may be needed to usher substrates into the proteolytic chamber. Download .pdf (.22 MB) Help with pdf files"

While modest CaR stimulation elicits Ca(2+)(i) oscillations, greater stimulation either increases oscillation frequency or elicits sustained responses by an unknown mechanism. Here, moderate CaR stimulation (2.5 mm Ca(2+)(o), 10 min) increased CaR(T888) phosphorylation (160-kDa mature receptor) 5-fold in CaR stably transfected HEK-293 cells, whereas 3-5 mm Ca(2+)(o) treatments were without apparent effect. Treatment with 2 mm Ca(2+)(o) caused sustained CaR(T888) phosphorylation (> or = 20 min) and oscillatory Ca(2+)(i) mobilization. However, 5 mm Ca(2+)(o) increased CaR(T888) phosphorylation only briefly while eliciting sustained Ca(2+)(i) mobilization, suggesting that greater CaR activation induces rapid CaR(T888) dephosphorylation, thus permitting sustained Ca(2+)(i) responses. Indeed, 5 mm Ca(2+)(o) stimulated protein phosphatase 2A activity and induced CaR(T888) dephosphorylation following acute phorbol ester pretreatment, the latter effect being mimicked by CaR-positive allosteric modulators (NPS-R467 and l-Phe). Finally, the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin-A reversed CaR-induced inhibition of parathyroid hormone secretion from bovine parathyroid slices and normal human parathyroid cells, demonstrating the physiological importance of phosphorylation status on parathyroid function. Therefore, high Ca(2+)(o)-stimulated protein kinase C acts in concert with high Ca(2+)(o)-induced phosphatase activity to generate and maintain CaR-induced Ca(2+)(i) oscillations via the dynamic phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of CaR(T888)."

LL5β (PHLDB2; pleckstrin homology-like domain, family B, member 2) is an ∼160-kDa protein that contains two predicted coiled-coil domains and a PH domain that is highly specific for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (10Levi L. Hanukoglu I. Raikhinstein M. Kohen F. Koch Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 11Paranavitane V. Coadwell W.J. Eguinoa A. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1328-1335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It has been reported that LL5β binds to exogenous Filamin A, as well as Filamin C (12Paranavitane V. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Cell. Signal. 2007; 19: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), in vitro. However, the LL5β and Filamin A regions required for binding and the biological significance of LL5β-Filamin A binding have not been experimentally explored. It has been shown that SHIP2 is a critical component of a negative feedback loop that regulates PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels in nerve growth factor-stimulated PC12 cells, together with the constitutively active phosphatidyl inositol-3 (PtdIns-3) phosphatase, phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) (13Aoki K. Nakamura T. Inoue T. Meyer T. Matsuda M. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 817-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This suggests that SHIP2 contributes to establishing a narrow accumulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in the membrane. Because PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 works as an internal compass of polarity in directed migrating cells, SHIP2 is likely to help a cell respond accurately and dynamically to external signals that impart directionality by increasing PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels in a leading edge of the cell. Previous studies have demonstrated that SHIP2 binds to Filamin A and that Filamin A is essential for the translocation of SHIP2 to the membrane ruffle. Moreover, recombinant SHIP2 regulates PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels and the distribution of submembranous actin at membrane ruffles following growth factor stimulation (14Dyson J.M. O'Malley C.J. Becanovic J. Munday A.D. Berndt M.C. Coghill I.D. Nandurkar H.H. Ooms L.M. Mitchell C.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1065-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, it remains elusive as to how and what molecules control SHIP2 and Filamin A translocation to the membrane, where in the cell periphery SHIP2 translocates, how membranous PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels are regulated by translocation of SHIP2, and how submembranous actins are controlled. Details of experimental procedures are provided in the supplemental Experimental Procedures. The full-length human LL5β cDNA (GenBankTM accession number AJ496194) was cloned from a human placenta cDNA library (BD Biosciences). Full-length LL5β cDNA was subcloned into pEGFP-C3 (plasmid vector for expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein-C3, Clontech) to generate pEGFP-LL5β. In addition, expression vectors for human LL5β lacking the first 156 amino acid residues (pEGFP-LL5βΔN1, we designated this vector as ΔN1), 323 amino acid residues (pEGFP-LL5βΔN2 as ΔN2), and 488 amino acid residues (pEGFP-LL5βΔN3 as ΔN3) were generated using pEGFP-C3. pEGFP-C3 was also used for enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression in COS-7 cells. Procedures for generating ΔN4, ΔN5, Δ2-a to Δ2-e, LL5βΔPH, and LL5β-VSV are described in the supplemental Experimental Procedures. Other protein expression vectors were constructed using pCAGGS so that the cDNAs would be driven under a modified chicken β-actin (CAG) promoter. We used pCAGGS-hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Filamin A (pCAGGS-HA-Filamin A) (15Nagano T. Morikubo S. Sato M. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9648-9657Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The following vectors were also generated: pCAGGS-HA-Filamin A truncated mutant 1 (Filamin AΔ1), pCAGGS-HA-Filamin A truncated mutant 2 (Filamin AΔ2), pCAGGS-HA-Filamin A truncated mutant 3 (Filamin AΔ3), and pCAGGS-HA-Filamin without repeat 24 (Filamin A ΔFR24). In addition, various vectors that expressed Val-Val-Val-Val-Val (V5)-His-tagged Filamin A fragments were constructed: CH1CH2, which contains the actin-binding domain 1 (CH1) and domain 2 (CH2) of Filamin A; FR24, which contains the filamin repeat (FR, also called immunoglobulin-like-β-sheet motif) 24 of Filamin A; and FR23H2, which contains the filamin repeat 23 and hinge 2 (H2) of Filamin A. The generation of Filamin AΔABD (ABD, actin-binding domain) has been described previously (15Nagano T. Morikubo S. Sato M. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9648-9657Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). For Filamin C expression, we used pBudCE4-Filamin C (made using pZP7-Filamin C, a generous gift from Dr. D. W. Chung, and pBudCE4 from Invitrogen). Full-length rat SHIP2 (GenBank accession number NM_022944) cDNA was subcloned into pCAGGS-GFP or pmCherry-N1 (Clontech) to generate SHIP2-expressing vector, where mCherry is a mutant fluorescent protein derived from the tetrameric Discosoma sp. red fluorescent protein (DsRed). The PH domain of rat ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) nucleotide-binding size opener (16Várnai P. Bondeva T. Tamás P. Tóth B. Buday L. Hunyady L. Balla T. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4879-4888Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 17Navolanic P.M. Steelman L.S. McCubrey J.A. Int. J. Oncol. 2003; 22: 237-252PubMed Google Scholar) (ARNO, GenBank accession number NM_053911, gift from Dr. T. Balla) was subcloned into pCAGGS-GFP vector to generate EGFP-ARNO/PH-expressing vector. The PH domain of mouse general receptor for phosphoinositides 1 (18Klarlund J.K. Tsiaras W. Holik J.J. Chawla A. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32816-32821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) (GRP1, GenBank accession number BC035296.1) was subcloned into pEGFP-C1 to generate EGFP-GRP1/PH-expressing vector. The following antibodies were used: anti-GFP antibody that can recognize EGFP (MBL Medical and Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan), anti-Filamin A antibody (MAB1678, Chemicon), anti-HA antibody (sc-805, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz), anti-α-tubulin (DM1A, Sigma), anti-VSV antibody (P5D4, Sigma), anti-pan-cadherin antibody (CH-19, Sigma), anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase antibody (14C10, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), anti-rabbit IgG (Sc-2027, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen), anti-β actin antibody (AC-40, Sigma), anti-FLAG antibody (F3165, Sigma), anti-PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 antibody (F3165, NN111.1.1, MBL Medical and Biological Laboratories), Alexa Fluor 568 phalloidin (Invitrogen). Anti-LL5β polyclonal antibody was generated in cooperation with SIGMA Genosys Japan (Ishikari, Japan). COS-7 cells were used. Vectors were transfected using PolyFect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) or FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics). To increase PtdIns (3,4,5)P3 in the plasma membrane, cells were cultured without serum for 16–18 h and then cultured with epidermal growth factor (EGF) for 2 min or serum for 10 min. Human melanoma cell lines M2 and A7 were maintained as reported previously (4Cunningham C.C. Gorlin J.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Byers H.R. Stossel T.P. Science. 1992; 255: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). FuGENE HD (Roche Diagnostics) was used to transfect these cells. Conventional protocols were used. Immunoprecipitation was performed with Dynabeads (Dynal, Hamburg, Germany) coated with antibodies specific to rabbit or mouse IgG. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA) was used for protein identification. Three different constructs of LL5β short hairpin RNA (shRNA) were prepared in the mouse U6 snRNA promoter (mU6pro) vector (mU6pro-LL5β-RNAi), which has a mouse U6 promoter (15Nagano T. Morikubo S. Sato M. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9648-9657Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Their sequence targets were nucleotides 177–197, 2246–2266, and 3647–3667 of the human LL5β cDNA. These shRNAs were termed LL5β-shRNA1, LL5β-shRNA2, and LL5β-shRNA3 and such vectors were called LL5β-RNAi1, LL5β-RNAi2, and LL5β-RNAi3, respectively. For co-transfection, a molar ratio of 1 (EGFP expression plasmid) to 2 (LL5β-RNAi or empty mU6pro vector) was employed. Empty shRNA vector was used as a control. Overconfluent COS-7 cells were co-transfected with pEGFP-C3 and mU6pro-LL5β-RNAi vector or pEGFP-C3 and control vector. Empty shRNA vector was used as the control vector. After 36–48 h, the confluent cell layer was disrupted followed by a 3-h incubation. After fixing and staining with rhodamine-phalloidin, cells at the defect edge expressing EGFP were observed, and the numbers of cells with or without lamellipodia were counted. For PI3K inhibition experiments, cells were cultured for 18–24 h followed by the addition of wortmannin (Sigma, final concentration 100 nm) or LY294002 (Sigma, final concentration 10 μm). Time-lapse observation was started (time 0) in a CO2 incubation chamber (5% CO2 at 37 °C) fitted onto a confocal microscope. Images were obtained every 1–2 min for 15 min to 1 h. Confocal images or live cell images were captured. Images were obtained using an AxioCam (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Subcellular fractionation was performed using the ProteoExtract subcellular proteome extraction kit (Calbiochem) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Utilizing the different extraction buffers in the kit, four different fractions were separated. The Triton-insoluble membrane/organelle fractions are shown in Fig. 5E. The amounts of the pan-cadherin (as reference for membrane proteins) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were used as internal controls. Significant differences, as indicated by p < 0.01, were determined by the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test or t test. First of all, we experimentally examined the relationship between LL5β and Filamin A (Fig. 1A) and their regions responsible for interaction. We expressed LL5β, tagged with EGFP at its amino terminus (EGFP-LL5β), in COS-7 cells to determine whether LL5β colocalizes with endogenous Filamin A (Fig. 1B). EGFP-LL5β and endogenous Filamin A colocalized primarily at the cell periphery after EGF application (final concentration, 100 ng/ml; Fig. 1B, left and middle columns), as reported previously (11Paranavitane V. Coadwell W.J. Eguinoa A. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1328-1335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Endogenous LL5β (supplemental Fig. S1) colocalized with endogenous Filamin A at the cell periphery by serum stimulation (Fig. 1B, right column). Previous work has demonstrated that PI3K is activated by EGF (17Navolanic P.M. Steelman L.S. McCubrey J.A. Int. J. Oncol. 2003; 22: 237-252PubMed Google Scholar) or by serum stimulation (19Oikawa T. Yamaguchi H. Itoh T. Kato M. Ijuin T. Yamazaki D. Suetsugu S. Takenawa T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). EGFP-tagged ARNO-PH, which specifically binds to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, has been used as a PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 detector (16Várnai P. Bondeva T. Tamás P. Tóth B. Buday L. Hunyady L. Balla T. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4879-4888Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 17Navolanic P.M. Steelman L.S. McCubrey J.A. Int. J. Oncol. 2003; 22: 237-252PubMed Google Scholar). Two minutes after EGF application, ARNO-PH accumulated at the cell periphery together with endogenous LL5β (Fig. 1C), suggesting that LL5β translocates where PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 localizes. EGF-induced accumulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 at the cell periphery was further confirmed by another PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 detector GRP1/PH (18Klarlund J.K. Tsiaras W. Holik J.J. Chawla A. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32816-32821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) or immunocytochemical techniques (supplemental Fig. S2). The interaction between LL5β and Filamin A was confirmed by immunoprecipitation. Cell lysates from COS-7 cells expressing EGFP-LL5β, an anti-GFP antibody that is capable of recognizing EGFP, and an anti-Filamin A antibody were used. This anti-Filamin A antibody did not cross-react with Filamin C in lysates from Filamin C-overexpressing COS-7 cells (data not shown). Filamin A, which is ∼280 kDa (3Gorlin J.B. Yamin R. Egan S. Stewart M. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1089-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 20Stossel T.P. Condeelis J. Cooley L. Hartwig J.H. Noegel A. Schleicher M. Shapiro S.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 138-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar), was co-immunoprecipitated with EGFP-LL5β (Fig. 1D). We then searched for the region of Filamin A responsible for this interaction. Filamin A, which usually exists as a homodimer, contains an amino-terminal actin-binding domain that precedes 24 immunoglobulin-like β-sheet motifs (FR, filamin repeats) (Fig. 1E). The last FR (FR 24) is responsible for homodimerization (20Stossel T.P. Condeelis J. Cooley L. Hartwig J.H. Noegel A. Schleicher M. Shapiro S.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 138-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Using three deletion mutants of amino-terminally HA-tagged Filamin A that lack different regions of the immunoglobulin-like-β-sheet motifs (Filamin AΔ1-Filamin AΔ3), we identified the domain of Filamin A responsible for its interaction with LL5β (Fig. 1E). Even Filamin AΔ3, which includes hinge 1 but lacks FR1–23, was co-immunoprecipitated with EGFP-LL5β (Fig. 1E). We next assessed the ability of the two actin-binding motifs (CH1, CH2), FR24 and hinge 2 (H2) of Filamin A, to bind to EGFP-LL5β. Two Filamin A fragments, CH1CH2 and FR24, but not FR23H2, were co-immunoprecipitated with EGFP-LL5β (Fig. 1, E and F). Furthermore, HA-tagged Filamin A without actin-binding domain (HA-Filamin A ΔABD) or without FR24 (HA-Filamin A ΔFR24) was co-immunoprecipitated with EGFP-LL5β (Fig. 1, E, G, and H). These results suggest that both the actin-binding domain and the FR24 of Filamin A are responsible for an interaction with LL5β. We next determined which domains of LL5β are required for this interaction (Fig. 2A). First, we generated a mutant of LL5β that lacks the PH domain (LL5βΔPH). HA-tagged Filamin A was co-expressed with EGFP-tagged LL5β (EGFP-LL5β) or EGFP-tagged LL5βΔPH (EGFP-LL5βΔPH) in COS-7 cells followed by lysis and immunoprecipitation with an anti-GFP antibody. Co-immunoprecipitated HA-tagged Filamin A was observed with the similar intensity in lysates from cells co-expressing either EGFP-LL5β or EGFP-LL5βΔPH (Fig. 2B), indicating that the PH domain is not required for binding to Filamin A. We then used various truncated forms of LL5β with N-terminal EGFP tags to search for regions of LL5β responsible for Filamin A binding. A Filamin A interaction occurred with ΔN1 and ΔN2, but not with the ΔN3, ΔN4, or ΔN5 mutants of LL5β, indicating that a domain present in ΔN2 but not ΔN3 is responsible for this interaction. We then further truncated this domain and found that ΔN2-a, but not ΔN2-b or ΔN2-c, could interact. Finally, we discovered that a 33-amino acid region (323–356, ΔN2-e) was sufficient for binding (Fig. 2C). This binding region of LL5β was different from what has been previously documented (12Paranavitane V. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Cell. Signal. 2007; 19: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To confirm our observation, we expressed ΔN2-e in COS-7 cells and identified co-immunoprecipitated proteins using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Then, Filamin A was identified (Fig. 2D). We reconfirmed our results. Because the PH domain of LL5β is specifically sensitive to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (10Levi L. Hanukoglu I. Raikhinstein M. Kohen F. Koch Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), we next examined whether the recruitment of LL5β to the lamellipodia is driven by PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Because the phosphorylation state of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is regulated by the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate by PI3K, COS-7 cells with exogenous EGFP-LL5β were treated with the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002. After this treatment, EGFP fluorescence was distributed in a punctate manner and colocalized with endogenous Filamin A (Fig. 2E; supplemental Fig. S3; supplemental Video 1). No accumulation of Filamin A was observed at the cell periphery. Our time-lapse study gave us more detailed information on how this redistribution took place. Puncta were formed in COS-7 cells about 14 min after treatment with the PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin (Fig. 2F). The EGFP-LL5β signal was not observed in lamellipodia after this treatment (Fig. 2F). This observation was further investigated by overexpressing EGFP-LL5βΔPH. EGFP-LL5βΔPH did not localize to the plasma membrane but colocalized well with endogenous Filamin A in a punctate distribution in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2G). This result is consistent with the demonstration of LL5βΔPH binding to HA-tagged Filamin A (Fig. 2B). We further examined the spatiotemporal regulation of LL5β in response to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. We added EGF to the culture medium after serum depletion for 16–18 h and continuously observed changes in EGFP-LL5β localization. Recruitment of EGFP-LL5β to the plasma membrane was first observed ∼80 s after EGF application, and by 112 s, EGFP-LL5β accumulated along the plasma membrane (Fig. 2H; supplemental Video 2). These data suggest that LL5β changes its subcellular localization quickly enough to chase changeable PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 distribution (supplemental Fig. S4 and supplemental Video 3). The ability of LL5β to bind to Filamin A, a protein crucial for cell motility (20Stossel T.P. Condeelis J. Cooley L. Hartwig J.H. Noegel A. Schleicher M. Shapiro S.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 138-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar), suggests that LL5β is also involved in motility control. To investigate the function of LL5β, we carried out LL5β knockdown experiments using RNA interference (RNAi). Of the three different shRNA constructs against LL5β, we found that LL5β-RNAi2 and LL5β-RNAi3 suppressed the expression of EGFP-LL5β with similar efficiency (Fig. 3A; supplemental Fig. S5). In the following experiments, we primarily used LL5β-RNAi2 to suppress LL5β expression in COS-7 cells, but LL5β-RNAi3 gave us similar results (supplemental Fig. S6). LL5β-RNAi reduced cell motility when compared with control cells under low cell density conditions where cells could move freely (Fig. 3, B and C). We then employed a wound-healing assay to determine whether there was any alteration to the cell-crawling machinery (Fig. 3, D and E). In this assay, quiescent cells in an overconfluent state usually develop lamellipodia in response to the removal of neighboring cells. We found that “typical lamellipodia” (defined as edge lines equal to or more than 10 μm long) were not properly formed in cells with LL5β-RNAi. Instead, small protrusions that contained F-actin (with edge lines less than 10 μm long) were observed (Fig. 3D). The frequency of cells with lamellipodia was estimated with or without LL5β-RNAi. Knockdown of LL5β resulted in a decrease in lamellipodium formation (Fig. 3E), suggesting that LL5β is essential for lamellipodium formation in COS-7 cells. Moreover, when LL5β expression was down-regulated by the RNAi technique in COS-7 cells, the distribution of Filamin A near the plasma membrane was significantly altered (Fig. 3F). Reduced formation of lamellipodia and a fiber-like distribution of Filamin A were observed in the small protrusions seen in LL5β knockdown cells. In contrast, LL5β overexpression resulted in the formation of large lamellipodia (Figs. 3G, upper row, and 4A, left and middle panels). In response to EGF, COS-7 cells with exogenous LL5β became very active (supplemental Video 4), whereas those with exogenous LL5βΔPH did not (Fig. 3G, lower row), indicating that the PH domain of LL5β is critical for this action. Because the PH domain of LL5β is primarily sensitive to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3(10Levi L. Hanukoglu I. Raikhinstein M. Kohen F. Koch Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 11Paranavitane V. Coadwell W.J. Eguinoa A. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1328-1335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and because PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is generated at the plasma membrane upon EGF application (17Navolanic P.M. Steelman L.S. McCubrey J.A. Int. J. Oncol. 2003; 22: 237-252PubMed Google Scholar), it is probable that the binding of LL5β to membrane PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 induced this cellular response.FIGURE 4Filamin A is necessary for induction of lamellipodium formation by LL5β. A, EGFP expression vector or EGFP-LL5β expression vector was transfected into COS-7 cells, A7 cells (which contain Filamin A), and M2 cells (which lack Filamin A). Very large lamellipodia were developed in the presence of EGFP-LL5β in COS-7 cells and A7 cells but not in the M2 cells. Scale bar = 10 μm. B, a whole-cell area was measured from 50 cells; cells were randomly selected in each case (mean ± S.E.). * p < 0.01. C and D, M2 cells expressing EGFP-LL5β and Filamin AΔABD or EGFP and Filamin AΔABD were cultured without serum for 18 h. EGF (final concentration 100 ng/ml) was then added into the culture medium (time 0). Approximately 2 min after EGF addition, small pseudopods (arrowheads) were transiently generated. The images were merged with their differential interference contrast images. Scale bars = 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because LL5β overexpression in COS-7 cells resulted in the enlargement of the peripheral area (including lamellipodia) of cells, we next examined whether Filamin A is involved in this response. M2 cells, in which LL5β mRNA was not detected (data not shown), are derived from a human melanoma and do not express Filamin A, whereas A7 cells are generated by stably transfecting Filamin A cDNA into M2 cells (4Cunningham C.C. Gorlin J.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Byers H.R. Stossel T.P. Science. 1992; 255: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). These cells express a molar ratio of Filamin A to actin comparable with that found in cells normally expressing Filamin A (4Cunningham C.C. Gorlin J.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Byers H.R. Stossel T.P. Science. 1992; 255: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). The LL5β-induced enlargement was observed in A7 cells as well as COS-7 cells, but not in M2 cells (Fig. 4, A and B), suggesting that enlargement induced by LL5β overexpression requires Filamin A. The versatility of Filamin A led us to ask whether the F-actin-cross-linking activity of Filamin A is essential for this enlargement. Filamin A dimerized through their carboxyl termini, and then dimerized Filamin A cross-linked two F-actin molecules through their ABD at their amino termini (15Nagano T. Morikubo S. Sato M. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9648-9657Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 21van der Flier A. Sonnenberg A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1538: 99-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Thus, we transfected a Filamin AΔABD expression vector (15Nagano T. Morikubo S. Sato M. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9648-9657Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) into M2 cells and examined the Filamin A F-actin-cross-linking activity to that observed in A7 cells. Application of EGF resulted in the formation of small pseudopods, but not proper lamellipodia, in M2 cells transfected with EGFP-LL5β and Filamin AΔABD (Fig. 4C). Therefore, the actin binding activity, or probably the F-actin-cross-linking activity, of Filamin A is crucial for the LL5β-mediated formation of lamellipodia. Because EGF induced small pseudopods in M2 cells transfected with Filamin AΔABD even in the absence of LL5β (Fig. 4D), it is unlikely that LL5β is involved in the formation of these small pseudopods. We next sought to determine whether LL5β directs translocation of SHIP2-Filamin A complex. As reported (14Dyson J.M. O'Malley C.J. Becanovic J. Munday A.D. Berndt M.C. Coghill I.D. Nandurkar H.H. Ooms L.M. Mitchell C.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1065-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), SHIP2 interacts with Filamin A (data not shown). By contrast, direct interaction between SHIP2 and LL5β was not observed (supplemental Fig. S7), suggesting that LL5β directs subcellular localization of SHIP2 via Filamin A. Two minutes after EGF stimulation, EGFP-tagged SHIP2 (EGFP-SHIP2) or mCherry-tagged SHIP2 (SHIP2-mCherry) localized to the cell periphery with LL5β (Fig. 5, A, lower row, and B, upper row) but remained in the cytosol in the presence of LL5βΔPH (Fig. 5B, lower row). As expected, SHIP2 colocalized well with Filamin A (Fig. 5C, upper row), but translocation of SHIP2 to the cell membrane was observed less in LL5β knockdown COS-7 cells (Fig. 5, C, lower row, and D). Supporting this observation, the amount of SHIP2 in the membrane fraction was reduced in LL5β knockdown COS-7 cells (Fig. 5E). These data indicate that Filamin A is an intermediate between LL5β and SHIP2. Indeed, translocation of EGFP-SHIP2 and LL5β to the cell periphery was observed in A7 cells (Fig. 5F). In M2 cells (Filamin A-deficient A7 cells), LL5β was translocated to the cell periphery, leaving SHIP2 in the cytosol, following EGF stimulation (Fig. 5G). It was of interest that the amount of α-tubulin was also decreased in LL5β knockdown cells (Fig. 5E). Because it has been reported that SHIP2 regulates PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 at membrane ruffles (14Dyson J.M. O'Malley C.J. Becanovic J. Munday A.D. Berndt M.C. Coghill I.D. Nandurkar H.H. Ooms L.M. Mitchell C.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1065-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and because it has also been proposed that SHIP2 mediates negative feedback on the accumulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (13Aoki K. Nakamura T. Inoue T. Meyer T. Matsuda M. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 817-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we examined whether SHIP2, which is directed by LL5β through Filamin A, regulates membrane PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. We found that ARNO-PH, one of the widely used PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 detectors (16Várnai P. Bondeva T. Tamás P. Tóth B. Buday L. Hunyady L. Balla T. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4879-4888Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 17Navolanic P.M. Steelman L.S. McCubrey J.A. Int. J. Oncol. 2003; 22: 237-252PubMed Google Scholar) (supplemental Figs. S2 and S4 and supplemental Video 3), showed a greater accumulation at the plasma membrane in LL5β knockdown cells (Fig. 5, H and I). This suggests that SHIP2, which is directed by LL5β, is very likely to regulate membrane PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. We demonstrate here that LL5β is essential for quick Filamin A-dependent SHIP2 translocation in response to membrane PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, fast enough to chase PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 changes, and the reciprocal control of membrane PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 through SHIP2, as well as the enhanced lamellipodium formation induced by PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (Fig. 6). It has been reported that v-ral simian leukemia viral oncogene homolog A (RalA) targets Filamin A in filopodia (22Ohta Y. Suzuki N. Nakamura S. Hartwig J.H. Stossel T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 2122-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). In addition, faint membrane localization of mutated SHIP2 that lacks Filamin A-interacting domain, is observed after 5 min of EGF stimulation (14Dyson J.M. O'Malley C.J. Becanovic J. Munday A.D. Berndt M.C. Coghill I.D. Nandurkar H.H. Ooms L.M. Mitchell C.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1065-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the fact that SHIP2 is capable of associating with p130Cas and localizes to membrane ruffles and focal adhesions (23Prasad N. Topping R.S. Decker S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1416-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Because F-actin primarily grows near the plasma membrane by polymerizing globular actins at its plus end (24Watanabe N. Mitchison T.J. Science. 2002; 295: 1083-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) and because cells do not form lamellipodia (large protrusions) in response to EGF application in the presence of the non-membrane-associating LL5βΔPH mutant, it is likely that increasing the cross-linking of newly polymerized F-actins by membrane-recruited Filamin A helps a cell to form lamellipodia. It is of interest that Filamin A can regulate the formation of small membrane protrusions without its actin-cross-linking activity. Indeed, small pseudopods were formed in M2 cells transfected with Filamin AΔABD in response to EGF. LL5β, as well as Filamin A, is apparently versatile because the amount of α-tubulin in the membrane fraction was decreased by LL5β knockdown. It has been reported that LL5β binds to cytoplasmic linker-associated proteins (CLASPs) (25Lee H. Engel U. Rusch J. Scherrer S. Sheard K. Van Vactor D. Neuron. 2004; 42: 913-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), which attach to the plus ends of microtubules, thereby modulating microtubule stabilization (26Lansbergen G. Grigoriev I. Mimori-Kiyosue Y. Ohtsuka T. Higa S. Kitajima I. Demmers J. Galjart N. Houtsmuller A.B. Grosveld F. Akhmanova A. Dev. Cell. 2006; 11: 21-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that LL5β synchronizes actins and microtubules, thereby coordinating cytoskeletal components for efficient migration. It has been shown that SHIP2 is a critical component of a negative feedback loop that regulates PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels and is likely to help a cell respond accurately and dynamically to external signals that impart directionality (13Aoki K. Nakamura T. Inoue T. Meyer T. Matsuda M. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 817-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We show here that SHIP2 translocates directly to sites of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 accumulation with Filamin A, which is dependent on LL5β. Considering that LL5β accumulates to the membrane in response to EGF application within a few minutes, it is plausible that SHIP2 follows changes in PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 without a substantial delay. Therefore, it is likely that SHIP2, Filamin A, and LL5β help a cell to move in one direction smoothly. Moreover, the ability of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and SHIP2 to regulate various cellular responses, such as the insulin response (27Kagawa S. Soeda Y. Ishihara H. Oya T. Sasahara M. Yaguchi S. Oshita R. Wada T. Tsuneki H. Sasaoka T. Endocrinology. 2008; 149: 642-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and the reciprocal regulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 with Filamin A-LL5β reported here suggest that these findings are significant for the general understanding of such events, and possibly, for the understanding of related diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2073469950,"Regulated secretion is a central issue for the specific function of many cells; for instance, mammalian sperm acrosomal exocytosis is essential for egg fertilization. Sphingosine 1-phosphate is a bioactive sphingolipid that regulates crucial physiological processes. Here we report that this lipid triggers acrosomal exocytosis in human sperm by a mechanism involving a Gi-coupled receptor. Real-time imaging showed a remarkable increase of cytosolic calcium upon activation with sphingosine 1-phosphate and pharmacological experiments indicate that the process requires extracellular calcium influx through voltage and store-operated calcium channels and efflux from intracellular stores through inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive calcium channels. Sphingosine 1-phosphate-induced exocytosis requires phospholipase C and protein kinase C activation. We investigated possible sources of the lipid. Western blot indicates that sphingosine kinase 1 is present in spermatozoa. Indirect immunofluorescence showed that phorbol ester, a potent protein kinase C activator that can also trigger acrosomal exocytosis, redistributes sphingosine kinase 1 to the acrosomal region. Functional assays showed that phorbol ester-induced exocytosis depends on the activation of sphingosine kinase 1. Furthermore, incorporation of 32P to sphingosine demonstrates that cells treated with the phorbol ester increase their sphingosine kinase activity that yields sphingosine 1-phosphate. We present here the first evidence indicating that human spermatozoa produce sphingosine 1-phosphate when challenged with an exocytic stimulus. These observations point to a new role of sphingosine 1-phosphate in a signaling cascade that facilitates acrosome reaction providing some clues about novel lipid molecules involved in exocytosis."

The expression of Nip1 was detected in the developing mouse brain, embryonic stem cells, primary neuronal stem cells, and retinoic acid-treated P19 embryonal carcinoma cells. The highest expression of Nip1 was observed in undifferentiated neuronal stem cells and was associated with Duox1-mediated reactive oxygen species ROS production. Ectopic nip1 expression in P19 embryonal carcinoma cells induced neuronal differentiation, and this phenotype was also linked to elevated ROS production. The neuronal differentiation in nip1-overexpressing P19 cells was achieved in a retinoic acid-independent manner and was corroborated by an increase in the expression of the neuronal basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors and neural-lineage cell markers. Furthermore, depletion of nip1 by short hairpin RNA led to a decrease in the expression of neuronal basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors and ROS. However, inhibition of ROS production in nip1-overexpressing P19 cells restricted but did not extinguish neuronal differentiation. Microarray and mass spectrometry analysis identified intermediate filaments as the principal cytoskeletal elements affected by up-regulation of nip1. We show here the first evidence for a functional interaction between Nip1 and a component of the nuclear lamina, lamin A/C. associated with a neuronal-specific phenotype.

The present study investigates the role of mammalian Nip1/Duoxa1 in neuronal differentiation. Nip1 is expressed in the developing brain, and we found that it was differentially regulated during differentiation of NS, ES, and P19 EC cells. The highest level of Nip1 expression was observed in NS cells and coincided with elevated Duox-mediated hydrogen peroxide release, in contrast with decreased Nip1 and hydrogen peroxide levels in terminally differentiated neurons. Ectopic expression of Nip1 in P19 cells resulted in elevation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), induction of neuron-specific gene expression, and ultimately, neuronal differentiation. Loss of function analysis indicated a role for Nip1-mediated ROS generation in neurogenesis. Microarray and mass spectrometry analyses demonstrated that Nip1 may affect cytoskeletal components resulting in expression of intermediate filament and actin anchoring proteins. Ectopic expression of Nip1 led to up-regulation of lamin A/C, resulting in acquisition of the specific phenotype of neuronal cells. A 1.6-kb cDNA fragment containing the complete coding sequence of mouse nip1 (BC019755) tagged with a c-Myc epitope was inserted into the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) vector via the SmaI/Xho1 restriction sites. The empty PGK vector was used as a control. Constructs for PGK-puro and B17 were as previously described (27Skerjanc I.S. Petropoulos H. Ridgeway A.G. Wilton S. J. Biol.

P19[nip1] stable cell lines were created by transfecting P19 cells with the construct PGK-nip1 or the empty PGK vector along with the constructs PGK-Puro and B17 using the FuGENE 6 HD transfection kit (Roche Diagnostics) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Cultures were examined for Nip1 expression by immunofluorescence and by end-point reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Selected Nip1-expressing cells and control cells were grown under puromycin selection until distinct colonies were formed (in ∼10 days). Individual colonies were transferred to 24-well plates, grown to confluence, and duplicated. Three independent clonal populations of stable clones, P19[nip1]-1, -2, and -9, and two control clones, P19[control]-9 and -10, were used in the experiments described. To examine the role of Nip1 in P19 cell differentiation, P19[nip1] or P19[control] cells were cultured without chemical treatment and examined for differentiation at the desired time points. Differentiation assays were repeated three-six times. For suppression of Nip1 expression, P19 cells were transfected, using FuGENE 6, with the mU6pro vector containing shRNA oligos directed against two different regions of the nip1 gene. Cells transfected with vectors that contained scrambled shRNA sequences were used as controls. To monitor transfection efficiency, cells were co-transfected with a pEGFP-C3 expression construct. At 24–48 h post-transfection, cells were analyzed for nip1 mRNA, Nip1 protein, and for intracellular H2O2 concentration. Primary mouse neural progenitor cells were isolated from the periventricular tissue of postnatal day 5 C57BL/6 mouse brain (Charles River Laboratories). Mice were housed and bred in the Health Sciences Animal Care Facility at the University of Western Ontario according to standards of the Canadian Council for Animal Care. All procedures were monitored under a protocol approved by the University of Western Ontario Council on Animal Care. Cells were isolated and then induced to differentiate into neurons marked by βIII tubulin expression (supplemental Fig. S2B) on polyornithine-coated dishes as previously described (32Rietze R.L. Reynolds B.A. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 419: 3-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). E14 ES cells were cultured on mouse embryonic fibroblasts with ES cell maintenance medium containing leukemia inhibitory factor (Chemicon). For embryoid body differentiation, 1 × 105 E14 ES cells were seeded into each well of a 6-well low-cluster plate and cultured in embryoid body differentiation medium. Embryoid body differentiation medium was similar to ES cell maintenance medium except for the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor and the use of FBS from Invitrogen. All cultures were maintained at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Statistical analysis was performed with Student's t test. p values of p < 0.05 are indicated as asterisks and are considered statistically significant. RT-PCR analysis revealed that nip1 transcripts were expressed in several different organs of adult mice including brain (Fig. 1A). For the first time, we show that nip1 is expressed in brain tissue. In contrast, nip2 transcripts were not detectable in brain tissue (Fig. 1A). Therefore, we explored a physiological role for the mammalian nip homologue in the acquisition of the neuronal fate. First, we determined the temporal expression pattern of Nip1 in developing mouse embryos and brain. Quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR analysis showed a gradual decrease in nip1 transcripts from embryonic day 7 to embryonic day 15 with a subsequent increase at day 17 (Fig. 1B). A rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against mouse Nip1. The specificity of this antibody was confirmed by loss of immunoreactivity in Western blot after preincubating cell lysate with the Nip1 peptide antigen (supplemental Fig. S1A). Western blot analysis anti-revealed the presence of the Nip1 in fetal and postnatal brain tissue. A pronounced increase in Nip1 expression was observed from embryonic day 18 (E18) to postnatal day 7 (Fig. 1C). At E10.5, the immunohistochemical analysis of the coronal sections of brain showed that Nip1 was strongly expressed in several areas of brain. In particular, the expression was detected in the periventricular zone and neuroepithelium. Additionally, Nip1 was expressed in the intermediate zone of the developing layer and in the ganglionic eminences, where neurons migrate to the pial surface. Most importantly, Nip1 was expressed in all areas of cerebral peduncle from which an important neuron population starts its differentiation process. Nip1 staining showed overlapping patterns with that of βIII-tubulin (Figs. 1D, supplemental Fig. S1D). Hence, these data confirm the presence of Nip1 in neurogenic regions of the developing brain. Because Nip1 has been associated with Numb, which was shown to play a critical role in neurogenesis in Drosophila and mouse (35Beddington R.S. Rashbass P. Wilson V. Dev. 1992; : 157-165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Morand S. Ueyama T. Tsujibe S. Saito N. Korzeniowska A. Leto T.L.

Chem. 2005; 280: 30046-30054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), it was important to determine the expression pattern of Numb. We found that the distribution pattern of Numb was distinct from that of Nip1 (supplemental Fig. S2). We next compared the expression of nip1 mRNA to genes known to be involved in early embryonic development at various time points during mouse embryonic development. Expression of the proneuronal bHLH factors neurogenin1 or neuroD was undetectable at E7 but increased at E11 when cortical neurogenesis was initiated (33Caviness Jr., V.S. Takahashi T. Nowakowski R.S. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 379-383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1F). In contrast, the expression of nip1 decreased from E7 to E11. This temporal mRNA expression of nip1 closely resemble that of the repressive bHLH transcription factor hes1 (34Ishibashi M. Moriyoshi K. Sasai Y. Shiota K. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1799-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) and brachyuryT, a gene known to pattern the early mesoderm (35Beddington R.S. Rashbass P. Wilson V. Dev. 1992; : 157-165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1G). The temporal pattern of the nip1 expression suggests that it may function in global organization of the early embryo, upstream of the bHLH proneuronal factors. We examined Nip1 expression in several mammalian stem cell systems during neuronal differentiation. Analysis by qRT-PCR revealed that the nip1 transcript was enriched in tissue-committed primary neuronal stem cells compared with pluripotent cells isolated from E7 mouse embryos and undifferentiated ES or P19 EC cells (Fig. 2A). Examination of the subcellular localization of Nip1 revealed ubiquitous distribution in ES cells (not shown), primary NS cells, and P19 EC cells (Fig. 2B, supplemental Figs. S1B and S2B). These data suggest that Nip1 expression is tightly regulated in stem cells and may be involved in the transition from pluripotent to a more restricted developing state. Because Nip1 was up-regulated in primary NS cells and developing brain tissue, we investigated the role of Nip1 in regulating mammalian stem cell differentiation toward the neuronal lineages. Unlike pluripotent P19 EC and mouse ES cells, non-differentiated, tissue-restricted NS cells from mouse periventricular tissue expressed a relatively high basal level of Nip1 (Fig. 2, A–C). Under differentiation conditions these cells produce neurons that express βIII-tubulin but not nestin, an intermediate filament protein expressed predominantly in undifferentiated stem cells (Fig. 2D and supplemental Fig. S2B). PCR analysis showed that the level of neuroD mRNA was decreased upon differentiation, indicating that these NS cells underwent neuronal differentiation (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, a significant decline in nip1 mRNA (Fig. 2C) and Nip1 protein levels (Fig. 2, D and E) (p < 0.05) was observed as the primary NS cells terminally differentiated. P19 cells aggregated in the presence of 1 μm RA differentiated into the neuronal lineage as confirmed by the expression of neuronal markers such as neurofilament and βIII-tubulin on day 7 by immunofluorescence and Western blot (supplemental Fig. S3, A and B). In accordance with our previous data (31Kennedy K.A. Porter T. Mehta V. Ryan S.D. Price F. Peshdary V. Karamboulas C. Savage J. Drysdale T.A. Li S.C. Bennett S.A. Skerjanc I.S. BMC Biol. 2009; 7: 67Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), Northern blot analysis showed that βIII-tubulin expression was elevated by RA treatment, whereas there was minimal differentiation in the absence of an inducing chemical (Fig. 2H). We employed qRT-PCR to assess the temporal pattern of the nip1 transcript during RA-induced neuronal differentiation of P19 cells. Compared with undifferentiated P19 cells on day 0, RA treatment led to a transient increase in nip1 mRNA on day 2 (Fig. 2F). This corresponded to the time point at which proneural genes such as neurogenin and neuroD were up-regulated (Fig. 2I) but preceded the up-regulation of βIII-tubulin (Fig. 2H). Before terminal neuronal differentiation, a sharp decline in nip1 expression was observed (Fig. 2F). In a similar manner, the nip1 transcript was up-regulated on day 4 of embryoid body formation in ES cells and subsequently down-regulated on day 6 (Fig. 2G). The transient up-regulation of the nip1 transcript during neuronal differentiation of P19 and ES cells and its relatively high level of expression in NS cells are consistent with the concept that Nip1 might be involved in regulation of neuronal differentiation of stem cells. P19 cells, which express a low basal level of nip1 (Fig. 2A) and are relatively easy to manipulate, provide a convenient system in which to explore the function of Nip1 in cell differentiation by ectopic expression. To investigate whether forced expression of Nip1 may induce neuronal differentiation in the absence of RA, we transfected P19 cells with an expression plasmid for Myc-tagged Nip1 and isolated clones stably expressing Nip1-Myc (termed P19[nip1] herein). P19 cells transfected with an empty vector (or P19[control]) were used as controls. A significant increase in Nip1 expression by the P19[nip1] stable transformants cells was verified by an anti-Myc Western blot (not shown), anti-Nip1 Western blot (Fig. 3A), and by qRT-PCR analysis (Fig. 3B). In contrast, duox1 mRNA level was not affected by ectopic expression of Nip1 (Fig. 3B). The level of expression of Numb transcripts was also not affected by up-regulation of Nip1 in P19 cells, and the protein distribution patterns varied from each other (supplemental Fig. S1, B and C). Increased Nip1 expression in P19[nip1] cells corresponded to elevated levels of neurogenin1 and neurogenin2 transcripts on day 0. No differences were observed for the hes1 and sox2 transcripts between the P19[nip1] and control cells (Fig. 3B). On day 3 of aggregation, the P19[nip1] clones exhibited elevated expression of math3 (8 ± 0.2-fold), neuroD (10 ± 3-fold), and neurofilament (9 ± 4-fold) in comparison to the P19[control] cells (Fig. 3C). A decrease in neurogenin1 and neurogenin2 mRNA was noted in the P19[nip1] clones on day 3, as compared with day 0. Sustained levels of nip1 mRNA on days 0 and 9 in P19[nip1] clones was verified by Northern blot analysis (supplemental Fig. S1C). In contrast, no change was observed for Duox1 mRNA in the P19[nip1] compared with control clones between day 0 and day 3 of aggregation. These data indicate that the neurogenic program had been initiated by ectopic expression of Nip1 on day 0, independently of RA. Next we immunostained cells on day 0 and post-aggregation days 3 and 7, aggregated in the absence of RA for the neuronal-specific structural proteins βIII-tubulin, Neurofilament, and Doublecortin (DCX). Cells were examined for βIII-tubulin by immunofluorescence (Fig. 3D), Western blot (Fig. 3E), and flow cytometry (Fig. 3F) to monitor neuronal differentiation after aggregation. Overexpression of Nip1 in P19[nip1] cells significantly increased the expression of βIII-tubulin (Fig. 3F). Flow cytometry showed that 17 ± 6.8% of P19[nip1] clones exhibited immunoreactivity to anti-βIII-tubulin compared with 4.7 ± 2% for the P19[control] cells (Fig. 4E). The P19[nip1] cells showed a 25% increase in immunostaining for neurofilament relative to controls (9 ± 1.6%) as measured by flow cytometry (Fig. 3G). Analysis of DCX by flow cytometry demonstrated that by day 7 of post-aggregation, ∼3% of P19[control] cells stained positive for doublecortin. In contrast, 9.2 ± 1.6% of P19[nip1] transformants were DCX-positive on day 3 of aggregation, and this number approached 20% (18 ± 2.8) by day 7 (Fig. 4F). The increases in the expression of neuronal structural proteins are consistent with qRT-PCR results (Fig. 3B). Together these data suggest that ectopic Nip1 expression leads to the acquisition of precocious neuronal fate in P19 cells in the absence of RA with or without aggregation and promotes neural differentiation upon aggregation. To elucidate the mechanism of Nip1-induced neuronal differentiation, we examined Duox expression in primary NS cells. Co-expression of Doux1 and Nip1/Douxa1 in cells was shown to be critical for generation of ROS (17Grasberger H. Refetoff S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18269-18272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In agreement with the literature (17Grasberger H. Refetoff S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18269-18272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 36Morand S. Ueyama T. Tsujibe S. Saito N. Korzeniowska A. Leto T.L. FASEB J. 2009; 23: 1205-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), we show that Nip1 and Duox1 formed a complex in mouse NS cells (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, both the protein level and interaction of the two proteins decreased upon differentiation, coinciding with marked reduction in the intracellular concentration of hydrogen peroxide, which decreased to ⅕ that of the basal level by day 5 of differentiation (Figs. 4, A and B). These data suggest that dual oxidase maturation is tightly regulated during NS cell differentiation and that ROS may play a role in initiating neuronal differentiation. To confirm the above finding, we measured ROS generation in the P19[nip1] clones that were shown to differentiate into neurons in an autonomous fashion (Fig. 3). We verified that Duox1 was localized to the plasma membrane along with Nip1 (supplemental Fig. S1B) and that a protein complex containing Nip1 and DUOX1 existed in P19[nip1] cells (Fig. 4C). To validate the presence of functional Duox1, we measured the intracellular ROS levels in P19[nip1] and P19[control] cells. We found that undifferentiated P19[nip1] clones consistently produced significantly higher levels of ROS than the P19[control] cells (Fig. 4, D and E). To obtain further evidence that the elevated ROS production observed in the P19[nip1] cells was mediated by the Nip1-Doux1 pathway, we treated the P19[nip1] cells with diphenyleneiodonium chloride, a broad NADPH oxidase inhibitor (37Hancock J.T. Jones O.T. Biochem. J. 1987; 242: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Diphenyleneiodonium chloride treatment of the P19[nip1] cells brought the intracellular ROS to a level slightly below that observed in the untreated P19[control] cells (Fig. 4F). Although Duox1 and Duox2 function as efficient H2O2 generators on the cell surface, they may also produce superoxide like other members of the NADPH oxidase family (12Geiszt M. Witta J. Baffi J.

The challenges in utilizing synthetic ECMs is the effective control of temporal and spatial complexity of multiple signal presentation, as compared to natural ECMs that possess the inherent properties of biological recognition, including presentation of receptor-binding ligands, susceptibility to cell-triggered proteolytic degradation, and remodeling. We have developed a murine preadipocyte differentiation system for generating a natural basement membrane extract (Adipogel) comprising ECM proteins (collagen IV, laminin, hyaluronan, and fibronectin) and including relevant growth factors (hepatocyte growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and leukemia inhibitory factor). We have shown the effective utilization of the growth factor-enriched extracellular matrix for enhanced albumin synthesis rate of primary hepatocyte cultures for a period of 10 d as compared to collagen sandwich cultures and comparable or higher function as compared to Matrigel cultures. We have also demonstrated comparable cytochrome P450 1A1 activity for the collagen-Adipogel condition to the collagen doublegel and Matrigel culture conditions. A metabolic analysis revealed that utilization of Adipogel in primary hepatocyte cultures increased serine, glycine, threonine, alanine, tyrosine, valine, methionine, lysine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, taurine, cysteine, and glucose uptake rates to enhance hepatocyte protein synthesis as compared to collagen double-gel cultures.

On the other hand, although the crystal structures of Nas6 and its complex with the C-terminal domain of Rpt3 have been reported (20Nakamura Y. Nakano K. Umehara T. Kimura M. Hayashizaki Y. Tanaka A.

Yokoyama S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 359: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), detailed mechanisms regarding how the 19 S RP is formed remain unclear. For a better understanding of assembly mechanisms, it is necessary to elucidate the three-dimensional structure of the other chaperones, i.e. Rpn14, Hsm3, and Nas2. In this study, we report the crystal structure of yeast Rpn14 and predict a structural model for the Rpn14-Rpt6 interaction. Using yeast genetics and biochemical studies, we show that a specific interaction between Rpt6 and Rpn14 is required for the proper assembly of the 19 S RP. We amplified the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rpn14 open reading frame by PCR from yeast genomic DNA of BY4741 and cloned it into the pET28(+) vector (Novagen). Site-directed mutants were generated with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using pET28-Rpn14 as the template. We subcloned wild-type and mutant RPN14 genes into the pGEX6P1 vector (GE Healthcare) and the pYF5 vector (22Saeki Y. Kudo T. Sone T. Kikuchi Y. Yokosawa H. Toh-e A. Tanaka K. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 359-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), which express N-terminally FLAG-tagged Rpn14 under the control of the GAL1 promoter. We also constructed the pET28(+)-Rpt6-C vector, which expresses the C-terminal region (amino acids 320–405) of Rpt6. Details of the expression plasmids and the primer sequences used for plasmid construction are given in supplemental Tables S1 and S2, respectively. We cultured Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen) harboring pET28-Rpn14 in LB medium containing kanamycin (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 18 °C for 20 h. Cells were lysed in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 150 mm NaCl) by sonication. Cell supernatants were obtained by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. We purified the recombinant protein by affinity, anion exchange, and gel filtration chromatographies and then concentrated it to 10 mg/ml. The selenomethionine derivative of Rpn14 was expressed in E. coli B834(DE3) (Novagen). The preparation and purification of the selenomethionine derivative of Rpn14 were carried out by the same procedures as described for the wild-type protein. Crystals of Rpn14 were obtained under the condition of 200 mm magnesium chloride, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 25% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350 by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method using Hampton screening kits. We obtained single crystals under an optimized crystallization condition of 8% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350 by microseeding at 293 K. Crystals (0.2 × 0.2 × 0.8 mm) were equilibrated in cryoprotectant buffer containing reservoir buffer plus 30% (v/v) glycerol and then cryogenized in a cold nitrogen stream at 100 K. Diffraction data sets were collected at beamline BL44XU of SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan). These data were indexed and integrated with the program MOSFLM (23Leslie A.G. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 48-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar) and scaled using the program SCALA (24Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar). Data collection statistics are given in Table 1. Crystals belonged to the space group P64, with cell dimensions of a = 73.3, b = 73.3, and c = 102.4 Å. The value of the Matthews coefficient was 2.13 Å3/Da for one molecule in the asymmetric unit, corresponding to a solvent content of 42.4%.TABLE 1Data collection, phasing, and refinement statisticsNativeSeMetX-ray sourceSpring-8 BL44XUData collectionSpace groupP64P64Unit cell parametersa (Å)78.5878.39b (Å)78.5878.39c (Å)110.12110.06PeakEdgeRemoteWavelength (Å)0.90.979140.97940.96417Distance (mm)400500500500Exposure time (s)1111Resolution range (Å)39.28–2.00 (2.11–2.00)aValues in parentheses are for the outer shell.67.88–2.70 (2.80–2.70)67.88–2.70 (2.80–2.70)68.04–2.70 (2.80–2.70)No. of total reflections137,284223,156217,898112,703No. of unique reflections26,08119,93219,76619,519Completeness (%)100.0 (100.0)96.3 (99.5)95.3 (99.6)94.0 (98.4)Rmerge (%)4.6 (40.5)9.2 (39.7)10.7 (46.4)8.9 (45.4)Rmeas (%)5.7 (49.0)Rp.i.m.

Open table in a new tab The structure of Rpn14 was determined by the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) method using a selenomethionine derivative. The positions of the heavy atoms were obtained using SHELXD (25Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta. Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar) and refined using SHARP (26Bricogne G. Vonrhein C. Flensburg C. Schiltz M. Paciorek W. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 2023-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Initial MAD phases were extended to a higher resolution with the diffraction data collected from a native crystal to 2.0 Å resolution with solvent flattening using PIRATE (24Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar) and DM (27Cowtan K. Acta. Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1555-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The initial model was constructed with the program ARP/wARP (28Morris R.J. Perrakis A. Lamzin V.S. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 229-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). This program automatically constructs a structural model containing 365 amino acid residues. The remaining parts of the structure were built manually using the program COOT (29Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23389) Google Scholar). The model was refined at 2.0 Å resolution with the program REFMAC5 (30Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar). The final Rpn14 model contained residues 1–414. There were no residues in disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. The final refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. GST-Rpn14 or the mutants expressed in Rosetta 2(DE3) cells (Novagen) were prebound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B and mixed with the E. coli lysate that expressed Rpt6-C for 2 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, beads were washed five times with buffer A and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Standard techniques were used for strain constructions and transformations (31Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar). YPD medium consisted of 1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, 2% glucose, 400 mg/liter adenine, and 20 mg/liter uracil. SGal-Ura medium consisted of 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.5% casamino acids, 2% galactose, 20 mg/liter tryptophan, 400 mg/liter adenine, and 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). All strains listed in Table 2 are congenic to strain W303. To construct an rpt6 mutant, a DNA fragment encoding 5′-truncated RPT6 (+137 to +1563) was inserted into the YIp vector pRS304 (32Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the residues corresponding to Arg373 and Arg374 of Rpt6 were mutated to Ala. The resulting plasmid, pRS304-rpt6R373A/R374A, was digested at the ClaI site and transformed into wild-type diploid cells (strain W303D). The positive transformant, in which correct integration was confirmed by DNA sequencing, was subjected to tetrad analysis, and YYS1644 was obtained. The other yeast strains, YYS1482, YYS1484, YYS1487, YYS1648, YYS1693, and YYS1694, were constructed by genetic crossing.TABLE 2Yeast strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeRef./sourceW303-1AMATa ura3-1, trp1-1, leu2-3,112, his3-11,15, ade2-1, can1-100Our stockYYS1201MATa Δnas6::HIS3Ref. 14Saeki Y.

Toh-E A. Kudo T. Kawamura H. Tanaka K. Cell. 2009; 137: 900-913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In brief, the cell lysate of Rpn1-yEGFP1F-expressing cells was loaded onto 3.5% native polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the fluorescence of Rpn1-yEGFP1F on the gel was imaged using a Typhoon 9400 scanner (GE Healthcare). Using the same gel, proteasome peptidase activities against succinyl-LLVY-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Peptide Inc.) were imaged using an LAS-4000 IR system (Fujifilm). Total cell extracts were prepared by the mild alkali method (33Kushnirov V.V. Yeast. 2000; 16: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Antibodies used for Western blotting were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-FLAG antibody M2 (Sigma), anti-Rpt6 antibody (a generous gift from Dr. Dan Finley), anti-Nas6 antibody (a generous gift from Dr. Junko Takeuchi), and anti-Rpn14 antibody. In this study, we raised anti-Rpn14 polyclonal antibody against rabbit using a full-length Rpn14 recombinant protein. The crystal structure of S. cerevisiae Rpn14 was determined by the MAD method and refined to 2.0 Å resolution (Table 1). Rpn14 consists of a small N-terminal domain (residues 1–75) and a C-terminal WD40 repeat domain (residues 76–417) (Fig. 1, A and B). The N-terminal domain is composed of two antiparallel β-sheets (S1/S2/S3 and S4/S5/S6) comprising six β-strands and a short α-helix (H1). The C-terminal WD40 repeats assume a β-propeller domain with seven blades, each of which adopts a β-sheet conformation composed of four antiparallel β-strands. Thus, Rpn14 exhibits a canonical β-propeller structure, although a 23-residue loop is inserted between SD1 and SD2. This insertion is not strictly conserved in sequence or in length among organisms (supplemental Fig. S1). The top face of the propeller is defined by loops 2-3 and 4-1, which joins S4 (A–F) and S1 (A–F) of consecutive blades, and the bottom face by loops 1-2 and 3-4. The width of Rpn14 from the top face to the bottom face is ∼22 Å, and the diameter is ∼43 Å. The central channel of the β-propeller is ∼7 Å in diameter. Structural homologs of Rpn14 were searched in the Protein Data Bank using the Dali server (34Holm L. Park J. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 566-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Rpn14 shares a significant degree of structural similarity with protein-binding proteins such as the signal transduction regulator RACK1 (35Ullah H. Scappini E.L. Moon A.F. Williams L.V. Armstrong D.L. Pedersen L.C. Protein Sci. 2008; 17: 1771-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and the G protein β-subunit, Gβ (36Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar), with root mean square deviations for related elements ranging from 2.1 to 3.2 Å. Rpn14 has 16–19% amino acid identity with these proteins. The core structure of β-propellers superimposes well, but the structure of the N-terminal domain of Rpn14 has no significant similarity to proteins with a known structure. Electrostatic surface potential analysis of Rpn14 showed that the region of blades A, F, and G at the top of the propeller and the N-terminal region exhibit negatively charged surfaces, which are composed of Asp13, Glu19, Glu20, Asp22, Glu23, Asp25, Asp26, Glu27, Asp33, Glu38, Glu115, Asp117, Asp132, Asp352, Asp382, Asp383, and Glu384 (Fig. 1C). The remaining regions of the molecule have mixed electrostatic potentials. Mapping of the conserved residues on the surface of Rpn14 was performed using a ClustalW (37Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55766) Google Scholar) multisequence alignment of Rpn14 proteins from eight different species and the ConSurf program (38Landau M. Mayrose I. Rosenberg Y. Glaser F. Martz E. Pupko T. Ben-Tal N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W299-W302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). The conserved patches of residues are located at the top of the propeller, around blades A and B and the N-terminal region (Fig. 1D), whereas the bottom and perimeter surfaces are noticeably less conserved. The conserved surface at the top face of the molecule is relatively abundant in negatively charged residues, i.e. Asp13, Asp22, Glu23, Glu27, Glu115, and Asp157. Rpn14 shows overall sequence and structural similarity to Gβ (19% sequence identity and root mean square deviation of 2.1 Å) (Fig. 2A). Gβ exhibits a β-propeller fold composed of seven four-stranded β-sheets and an N-terminal extended helix and interacts with many binding partners. The crystal structure of Gβ complexed with an α-helical peptide (Protein Data Bank code 1XHM) has been reported previously (39Davis T.L. Bonacci T.M. Sprang S.R. Smrcka A.V. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10593-10604Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Because the C-terminal domain of Rpt6 is predicted to form an α-helical structure, one might expect that Rpn14 binds to this domain in a manner similar to the binding of the β-propeller of Gβ to the helical peptide exclusively at its top surface. This interaction site is separated into two regions: one bearing acidic residues (Asp228, Asn230, and Asp246) and one bearing hydrophobic residues (Met101 and Met188) (Fig. 2B). These residues are less conserved between Gβ and Rpn14. In Rpn14, the corresponding residues form a negatively charged area at the top face. Therefore, this unique surface property is likely required for binding to Rpt6. Although the tertiary structures of Rpn14 and Nas6 are quite different, Rpn14 contains WD40 motifs, and Nas6 contains ankyrin repeats, and these chaperones bind to the C-terminal regions of specific Rpt subunits (13Funakoshi M. Tomko Jr., R.J. Kobayashi H. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 2009; 137: 887-899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 14Saeki Y. Toh-E A. Kudo T. Kawamura H. Tanaka K. Cell. 2009; 137: 900-913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 15Roelofs J. Park S. Haas W. Tian G. McAllister F.E. Huo Y. Lee B.H. Zhang F. Shi Y. Gygi S.P. Finley D. Nature. 2009; 459: 861-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 19Kaneko T. Hamazaki J. Iemura S. Sasaki K. Furuyama K. Natsume T. Tanaka K. Murata S. Cell. 2009; 137: 914-925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Nas6 was shown to interact specifically with the C-terminal region of Rpt3, Rpt3-C (residues 348–428), through surface charge complementarity (Fig. 3, A and B), i.e. one positively and two negatively charged patches in Nas6 and one negatively and two positively charged patches in Rpt3-C (20Nakamura Y. Nakano K. Umehara T. Kimura M. Hayashizaki Y. Tanaka A. Horikoshi M. Padmanabhan B. Yokoyama S. Structure. 2007; 15: 179-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 21Nakamura Y. Umehara T. Tanaka A. Horikoshi M. Padmanabhan B. Yokoyama S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 359: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). On the basis of the above results, we hypothesized that the Rpn14-Rpt6 interaction may also occur through the complementary charge interaction, with the acidic surface at the top of Rpn14 accommodating positively charged residues of Rpt6-C. To investigate this possibility, a homology model of Rpt6-C (Fig. 3C) was built from the Rpt3-C structure (Protein Data Bank code 2DZN) using the MOE software package (Molecular Operating Environment, Chemical Computing Group Inc., Montreal, Canada). Structural comparison revealed that the surface charge environments of the interfaces are significantly different between Rpt3-C and Rpt6-C despite their structural similarities. Rpt6-C has three positively charged patches at the surface corresponding to the Nas6-binding site of Rpt3-C. We assumed that these differences account for the specificities of Rpt subunits by the 19 S base-dedicated chaperones. To test the hypothesis that surface charges are involved in the interaction, we mutated the residues in the charged patches of Rpt6 and examined Rpn14 binding in vitro. Although the expression of the Rpt6-C protein alone yielded an aggregated form in E. coli, Rpt6-C was soluble when coexpressed with Rpn14. We then mutated basic residues (R333A/R334A, R344A/R345A, and R373A/R374A) in Rpt6-C and coexpressed them with Rpn14. As shown in Fig. 4A, the R373A/R374A mutation reduced binding to Rpn14, whereas the R333A/R334A and R344A/R345A mutants had no effect on the interaction. This result suggested that Arg373 and Arg374 in Rpt6-C are critical residues for Rpn14 binding. To determine the physiological relevance of the interaction, we constructed a yeast rpt6 mutant strain in which Arg373 and Arg374 of the RPT6 gene were mutated to Ala. The rpt6R373A/R374A cells grew normally even when cultured at the high temperature of 37 °C (Fig. 4B). Previously, we found that the Δnas6 Δrpn14 double deletion cells show severe growth defects at high temperatures, whereas cells with single deletions do not show such defects (14Saeki Y. Toh-E A. Kudo T. Kawamura H. Tanaka K. Cell. 2009; 137: 900-913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This genetic interaction suggests that the Nas6-Rpt3 and Rpn14-Rpt6 interactions are not indispensable for 19 S RP assembly but lethal when both interactions are absent. If Arg373 and Arg374 of Rpt6 are critical residues for Rpn14 binding, genetic interaction between rpt6R373A/R374A and Δnas6 should be observed. As anticipated, the rpt6R373A/R374A Δnas6 double mutant cells showed a temperature-sensitive phenotype, as did the Δnas6 Δrpn14 cells (Fig. 4B). The protein levels of Nas6, Rpn14, and Rpt6 were not affected by deletion or mutation (Fig. 4C). Next, we investigated the impact of the basic residues of Rpt6 on 26 S proteasome assembly. To monitor proteasome assembly, we constructed green fluorescent protein-tagged RPN1 strains through which RP subassemblies can be detected directly on native polyacrylamide gel (14Saeki Y. Toh-E A. Kudo T. Kawamura H. Tanaka K. Cell. 2009; 137: 900-913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Similar to previous reports, 26 S proteasome levels were decreased in the Δnas6 Δrpn14 mutant due to a defect in RP formation (Fig. 4D). In the rpt6R373A/R374A single mutant cells, a slight decrease in 26 S proteasomes was observed, presumably because of a defect in the RP-CP interaction rather than RP assembly. Alternatively, severe impairment of RP assembly was observed in the rpt6R373A/R374A Δnas6 double mutant cells and in the Δnas6 Δrpn14 mutant cells. Thus, Arg373 and Arg374 in Rpt6 are critical residues for Rpn14 binding in vivo. The surface of Rpn14 has multiple acidic patches (Fig. 1C). To determine which acidic residues in Rpn14 are important for the chaperone function, i.e. Rpt6 binding, we performed genetic analysis using Δnas6 Δrpn14 cells. Each of the Rpn14 mutants (E19A/E20A, D22A/E23A, D25A/D26A/E27A, E115A, E138A, D157A, D382A/D383A/E384A, E384A, E27K, D25K/D26K/E27K, E115K, D157K, E384K, and D382K/D383K/E384K) was expressed under the control of the GAL1 promoter in Δnas6 Δrpn14 cells and incubated at 37 °C (Fig. 5, A and B). The temperature-sensitive phenotype of Δnas6 Δrpn14 was not rescued by the expression of the D157A and D157K mutants of Rpn14 (Fig. 5, A and B). Genetic data indicated that the specific residue Asp157 plays an important role in the function of Rpn14. We confirmed that both Rpn14 mutants D157A and D157K were expressed as well as wild-type Rpn14 in yeast cells (data not shown). Finally, we conducted in vitro pulldown assays using GST-Rpn14 and E. coli lysates expressing Rpt6-C. Compared with wild-type Rpn14, the D157A and D157K mutants resulted in reduced binding to Rpt6-C (Fig. 5C). On inspection of these data, we concluded that Asp157 of Rpn14 contributes to the interaction with Rpt6 and the function of RP assembly. In conclusion, we determined the crystal structure of yeast Rpn14 at 2.0Å resolution. The refined structure in conjunction with mutational and genetic data provided further insight into the interaction between Rpn14 and Rpt6. In particular, our findings suggest that the complex formation between Rpn14 and Rpt6 occurs through electrostatic interactions in a manner similar to that between Nas6 and Rpt3. Although mechanistic actions of how the base-dedicated chaperones regulate RP assembly remain unclear, our structural study of the Rpn14-Rpt6 interaction provides a framework for future studies of RP assembly.

https://openalex.org/W2023865930,"Cyclooxygenases (COXs) have important functions in various physiological and pathological processes. COX-2 expression is highly induced by a variety of stimuli and is observed during certain periods of embryonic development. In this report, the direct effect of COX-2 expression on embryonic development is examined in a novel COX-2 transgenic mouse model that ubiquitously expresses human COX-2 from the early stages of embryonic development. COX-2 transgenic fetuses exhibit severe skeletal malformations and die shortly after birth. Skeletal malformations are localized along the entire vertebral column and rib cage and are linked to defective formation of cartilage anlagen. The cartilage anlagen of axial skeleton fail to properly develop in transgenic embryos because of impaired precartilaginous sclerotomal condensation, which results from the reduction of cell number in the sclerotome. Despite the ubiquitous expression of COX-2, the number of apoptotic cells is highly increased in the sclerotome of transgenic embryos but not in other tissues, suggesting that it is a tissue-specific response. Therefore, the loss of sclerotomal cells due to an increased apoptosis is probably responsible for axial skeletal malformations in transgenic fetuses. In addition, the sclerotomal accumulation of p53 protein is observed in transgenic embryos, suggesting that COX-2 may induce apoptosis via the up-regulation of p53. Our results demonstrate that the aberrant COX-2 signaling during embryonic development is teratogenic and suggest a possible association of COX-2 with fetal malformations of unknown etiology. Cyclooxygenases (COXs) have important functions in various physiological and pathological processes. COX-2 expression is highly induced by a variety of stimuli and is observed during certain periods of embryonic development. In this report, the direct effect of COX-2 expression on embryonic development is examined in a novel COX-2 transgenic mouse model that ubiquitously expresses human COX-2 from the early stages of embryonic development. COX-2 transgenic fetuses exhibit severe skeletal malformations and die shortly after birth. Skeletal malformations are localized along the entire vertebral column and rib cage and are linked to defective formation of cartilage anlagen. The cartilage anlagen of axial skeleton fail to properly develop in transgenic embryos because of impaired precartilaginous sclerotomal condensation, which results from the reduction of cell number in the sclerotome. Despite the ubiquitous expression of COX-2, the number of apoptotic cells is highly increased in the sclerotome of transgenic embryos but not in other tissues, suggesting that it is a tissue-specific response. Therefore, the loss of sclerotomal cells due to an increased apoptosis is probably responsible for axial skeletal malformations in transgenic fetuses. In addition, the sclerotomal accumulation of p53 protein is observed in transgenic embryos, suggesting that COX-2 may induce apoptosis via the up-regulation of p53. Our results demonstrate that the aberrant COX-2 signaling during embryonic development is teratogenic and suggest a possible association of COX-2 with fetal malformations of unknown etiology."

It exhibits the least protein sequence similarity with the other family members, including the well studied family member β4Gal-T1, which, in the presence of manganese, transfers Gal from UDP-Gal to GlcNAc. We report here the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of β4Gal-T7 from Drosophila in the presence of manganese and UDP at 1.81 Å resolution. In the crystal structure, a new manganese ion-binding motif (HXH) has been observed. Superposition of the crystal structures of β4Gal-T7 and β4Gal-T1 shows that the catalytic pocket and the substrate-binding sites in these proteins are similar. Compared with GlcNAc, xylose has a hydroxyl group (instead of an N-acetyl group) at C2 and lacks the CH2OH group at C5; thus, these protein structures show significant differences in their acceptor-binding site. Modeling of xylose in the acceptor-binding site of the β4Gal-T7 crystal structure shows that the aromatic side chain of Tyr177 interacts strongly with the C5 atom of xylose, causing steric hindrance to any additional group at C5.

IntroductionProteoglycans such as heparin/heparan sulfate, chondroitin, and dermatan sulfates are found widely on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix of various tissues and are known to play important roles in several cellular functions such as cell growth and differentiation (1Bishop J.R.

These glycosaminoglycans are biosynthesized as extended oligosaccharides on a linker tetrasaccharide (GlcUAβ1,3Galβ1,3Galβ1,4Xylβ-O-) 2The abbreviations used are: GlcUAglucuronic acidXylxyloseβ4Gal-Tβ1,4-galactosyltransferaseMPD2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. that is attached to a Ser residue on a core protein (3Gandhi N.S.

Its homolog is present in all vertebrates and invertebrate species (10Hennet T. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1081-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). It has been shown that β4Gal-T7 is an essential enzyme for the species viability, and mutation in the β4Gal-T7 gene has been linked to Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (9Takemae H. Ueda R. Okubo R. Nakato H.

Ramakrishnan B. Boeggeman E. Curr. Drug Targets. 2008; 9: 292-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 13Ramakrishnan B. Boeggeman E. Ramasamy V. Qasba P.K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, in the presence of manganese, the β4Gal-T1 enzyme transfers Gal from UDP-Gal to GlcNAc present at the nonreducing end of an oligosaccharide acceptor (14Brew K. Vanaman T.C. Hill R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1968; 59: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Also, in mammals, during lactation in the mammary gland, its acceptor specificity is altered from GlcNAc to Glc by the mammary gland-specific protein α-lactalbumin, thus synthesizing lactose present in milk (15Brodbeck U. Denton W.L. Tanahashi N. Ebner K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1391-1397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Qasba P.K. Kumar S. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 32: 255-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The structure and function studies on β4Gal-T1 have shown that the apoenzyme exists in an open conformation with its catalytic pocket exposed to the solvent environment to facilitate the binding of manganese and UDP-Gal (13Ramakrishnan B. Boeggeman E. Ramasamy V. Qasba P.K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Upon manganese and UDP-Gal binding, it undergoes conformational changes involving two flexible loops: 1) a short flexible loop where the side chain of a Trp residue moves from outside to inside the catalytic pocket binding to UDP-Gal, and 2) a long flexible loop that moves to cover the bound UDP-Gal by forming a manganese ion coordination bond with its N-terminal His residue while its C-terminal residues undergo loop-to-helix transition, creating the binding site for the acceptor sugar substrate and α-lactalbumin (12Qasba P.K. Ramakrishnan B. Boeggeman E. Curr. Drug Targets. 2008; 9: 292-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 13Ramakrishnan B. Boeggeman E. Ramasamy V. Qasba P.K. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Upon binding of the acceptor substrate GlcNAc, Asp318 in the bovine β4Gal-T1 enzyme (or Asp314 in human) acts as the catalytic base, enabling the O4 atom of the GlcNAc to initiate a nucleophilic attack on the C1 atom of the galactose moiety of the UDP-Gal following the Sn2 catalytic mechanism (18Ramakrishnan B. Ramasamy V. Qasba P.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 1619-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 19Krupicka M. Tvaroska I. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2009; 113: 11314-11319Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). After catalysis, the product disaccharide leaves the enzyme, allowing it to revert back to the open conformation to exchange the bound UDP for UDP-Gal to start a new catalytic cycle (12Qasba P.K. Ramakrishnan B. Boeggeman E. Curr. Drug Targets. 2008; 9: 292-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 13Ramakrishnan B. Boeggeman E. Ramasamy V. Qasba P.K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).Although the β4Gal-T7 molecule shares protein sequence similarity with the β4Gal-T1 molecule and is expected to have a similar overall three-dimensional structure, it exhibits distinct differences from β4Gal-T1, including its acceptor sugar specificity. For example, it has been shown that the binding of manganese and UDP alone can introduce conformational changes in the β4Gal-T7 molecule, whereas manganese and UDP-Gal are necessary in the β4Gal-T1 molecule (20Daligault F. Rahuel-Clermont S. Gulberti S. Cung M.T. Branlant G. Netter P. Magdalou J. Lattard V. Biochem. J. 2009; 418: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 21Geren C.R. Magee S.C. Ebner K.E.

Also, the β4Gal-T1 enzyme exhibits high catalytic activity above pH 7.0, whereas the β4Gal-T7 enzyme exhibits maximum catalytic activity at pH 6.5 (7Vadaie N. Hulinsky R.S. Jarvis D.L. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, the three-dimensional structure of the β4Gal-T7 molecule is essential to understand its structure and function. We present here the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of β4Gal-T7 from Drosophila in the presence of manganese and UDP at 1.81 Å resolution.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESThe Drosophila melanogaster β4Gal-T7 cDNA (AY094665) was purchased from Open Biosystems. It was found to have a single amino acid mutation, Asp212 to Gly, which was corrected while cloning. The DNA fragments coding the catalytic domain (Cd7) sequence (residues 71–322) and the C-terminal 11-amino acid deletion (Cd7ΔC) sequence (residues 71–311) were cloned into a pET23a vector between the restriction enzyme sites BamHI and EcoRI (Fig. 1A). The N-terminal fusion proteins P-Cd7ΔC and P1-Cd7ΔC, containing a 46- and a 33-amino acid peptide (P and P1), respectively, from bovine β4Gal-T1 (residues 130–175 and 143–175, respectively), were constructed by inserting the DNA fragments corresponding to the fusion peptides P and P1 at the N terminus of the Cd7ΔC protein between the restriction enzyme sites BamHI and NcoI (see Fig. 1A). The fusion constructs P-Cd7ΔC and P1-Cd7ΔC have the DNA sequence corresponding to the C-terminal deleted catalytic domain of Drosophila β4Gal-T7 (Cd7ΔC) inserted between the restriction enzyme sites NcoI and EcoRI. The four plasmids containing cDNA sequences of Cd7, Cd7ΔC, P-Cd7ΔC, and P1-Cd7ΔC were first confirmed by DNA sequencing and then transfected into a Rosetta(DE3)pLysS cell for protein expression.Protein Expression and RefoldingThe four Rosetta(DE3)pLysS cells, each containing one of the four forms of Drosophila Cd7 cDNA sequences, Cd7, Cd7ΔC, P-Cd7ΔC, and P1-Cd7ΔC, in the pET23a vector described above, were grown to an absorbance of 0.7–0.8 and then induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The inclusion bodies were purified from the bacterial pellet as described (24Boeggeman E.E. Balaji P.V. Sethi N. Masibay A.S. Qasba P.K. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 25Boeggeman E.E. Ramakrishnan B. Qasba P.K. Protein Expr. Purif. 2003; 30: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). From 1 liter of bacterial culture, 60–70 mg of protein were obtained as inclusion bodies. The in vitro folding of Cd7 was carried out in a way similar to that of β4Gal-T1 (25Boeggeman E.E. Ramakrishnan B. Qasba P.K. Protein Expr. Purif. 2003; 30: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Typically, 100 mg of sulfonated protein were folded for 48 h in 1 liter of folding solution containing oxido-shuffling agents and 500 mm arginine HCl. After refolding the protein, the folding solution was extensively dialyzed in water. During dialysis, the misfolded protein precipitated out, whereas the folded protein remained soluble. The soluble active protein was concentrated on an Amicon stirred cell using a YM-10 membrane, and no further purification was necessary. Nearly 20 mg of folded and active Drosophila Cd7 protein were obtained from 1 liter of folding solution. The C-terminal deletion (Cd7ΔC) or the addition of N-terminal fusion peptide P (P-Cd7ΔC) or P1 (P1-Cd7ΔC) did not affect the folding efficiency.Crystallization and Structure DeterminationThe crystals of P1-Cd7ΔC were grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method by mixing equal amounts of P1-Cd7ΔC protein solution containing 10–20 mg/ml protein, 33 mm UDP, and 66 mm MnCl2 with a solution of precipitating agent containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 m NaCl, 15% (v/v) MPD, and 5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000. The tetragonal bipyramidal crystals grew in 1–2 days to a size of 0.2–0.4 mm3. A 1.81 Å resolution native data set was collected on the 22-BM beam line with an x-ray beam at a 1.0-Å wavelength. The data collection statistics are given in Table 1. Crystals grown in the presence of NaBr instead of NaCl were used for solving the crystal structure using anomalous dispersion arising from bromine atoms (26Dauter Z. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Single-wavelength anomalous dispersion diffraction data up to 2 Å resolution were collected on the crystals grown with 1 m NaBr at a 0.919-Å wavelength on the 22-ID beam line. All frames were processed with HKL3000 (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38355) Google Scholar). The protein structure was solved by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion methods using the program HKL2MAP (28Pape T. Schneider T.R. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2004; 37: 843-844Crossref Google Scholar). In the crystal structure, there is one P1-Cd7ΔC molecule in the asymmetric unit. Of the total 240 residues in the Cd7ΔC protein, 230 residues were automatically fitted into the solvent-flattened electron density maps generated by HKL2MAP by the web-based ARP/wARP program (29Morris R.J. Perrakis A. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 968-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). At this stage, the model was refined using the native data up to 1.81 Å resolution. The missing 10 residues were better visible and were built based on the difference electron density maps using the program Coot (30Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22790) Google Scholar). In addition to one manganese ion, UDP, and one MPD molecule, the solvent water molecules located using the program Coot were also included in the refinement. All refinements were carried out using Refmac5.5, which is part of the CCP4i package (31Potterton E. Briggs P. Turkenburg M. Dodson E. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1131-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar, 32Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13776) Google Scholar). The final refinement statistics are given in Table 1. The final protein model contains all 240 residues from the Cd7ΔC protein. The N-terminal fusion peptide P1 could not be located in the electron density maps. Although the backbone conformation for Leu263 is in a generously allowed region of the Ramachandran plot, it has a well defined electron density. All figures were drawn using the PyMOL molecular graphics program. The structure factors and coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (code 3LW6).TABLE 1X-ray diffraction data collection and refinement statisticsData collectionWavelength (Å)1.00Space groupP43212Cell constants, a = b, c (Å)81.83, 133.65Resolution range (Å)50–1.81No. of unique reflections39,114Redundancy11.9 (9.9)aThe numbers in parentheses correspond to the resolution range from 1.9 to 1.81 Å.Rsym (%)6.3 (41)aThe numbers in parentheses correspond to the resolution range from 1.9 to 1.81 Å.Completeness (%)98 (85)aThe numbers in parentheses correspond to the resolution range from 1.9 to 1.81 Å.I/σ(I)35 (4.2)aThe numbers in parentheses correspond to the resolution range from 1.9 to 1.81 Å.Refinement statisticsRcryst0.195Rfree (5%)0.225r.m.s.d. of bond lengths (Å)0.015r.m.s.d. of bond angles1.582°Average B factor (Å2)Protein molecule (1997 atoms)31UDP molecule (25 atoms)23MPD molecule (8 atoms)32Manganese ion (1 atom)24Water molecules (224 waters)39Ramachandran plotbThis was calculated using the PROCHECK program, which is part of the CCP4i package.Core region184 (85.2%)Allowed region31 (14.4%)Generously allowed region1 (0.5%)a The numbers in parentheses correspond to the resolution range from 1.9 to 1.81 Å.b This was calculated using the PROCHECK program, which is part of the CCP4i package.

Upon binding of the acceptor substrate GlcNAc, Asp318 in the bovine β4Gal-T1 enzyme (or Asp314 in human) acts as the catalytic base, enabling the O4 atom of the GlcNAc to initiate a nucleophilic attack on the C1 atom of the galactose moiety of the UDP-Gal following the Sn2 catalytic mechanism (18Ramakrishnan B.

B. 2009; 113: 11314-11319Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). After catalysis, the product disaccharide leaves the enzyme, allowing it to revert back to the open conformation to exchange the bound UDP for UDP-Gal to start a new catalytic cycle (12Qasba P.K.

For example, it has been shown that the binding of manganese and UDP alone can introduce conformational changes in the β4Gal-T7 molecule, whereas manganese and UDP-Gal are necessary in the β4Gal-T1 molecule (20Daligault F.

Also, the β4Gal-T1 enzyme exhibits high catalytic activity above pH 7.0, whereas the β4Gal-T7 enzyme exhibits maximum catalytic activity at pH 6.5 (7Vadaie N. Hulinsky R.S. Jarvis D.L.

We present here the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of β4Gal-T7 from Drosophila in the presence of manganese and UDP at 1.81 Å resolution. Proteoglycans such as heparin/heparan sulfate, chondroitin, and dermatan sulfates are found widely on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix of various tissues and are known to play important roles in several cellular functions such as cell growth and differentiation (1Bishop J.R.

These glycosaminoglycans are biosynthesized as extended oligosaccharides on a linker tetrasaccharide (GlcUAβ1,3Galβ1,3Galβ1,4Xylβ-O-) 2The abbreviations used are: GlcUAglucuronic acidXylxyloseβ4Gal-Tβ1,4-galactosyltransferaseMPD2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. that is attached to a Ser residue on a core protein (3Gandhi N.S.

IntroductionThe Golgi apparatus is comprised of multiple compartments with different components and functions. These compartments are successively formed by the maturation of the earliest compartment derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 2The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumHAhemagglutininGSTglutathione S-transferasemAbmonoclonal antibodyGMPPNPguanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphateGDPβSguanosine 5′-(β-thio)diphosphate. through homotypic fusion of the COPII vesicles (1Pelham H.R. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 45-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The maturation of compartments is believed to occur by removing the components of the earlier compartments and acquiring those of the later compartments in a COPI vesicle-dependent manner (2Losev E.

Nature. 2006; 441: 1007-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The newly synthesized Golgi proteins are first translocated in the ER and then selectively incorporated in the COPII vesicles and transported to the earliest Golgi compartment or the cis-Golgi network. When the small G-protein Sar1 is activated by Sec12 on the ER, Sec23/Sec24 subunits are recruited to form the prebudding complex containing the selected cargo proteins (4Kuehn M.J. Herrmann J.M. Schekman R. Nature. 1998; 391: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Successive binding of Sec13/Sec31 subunits induces ER membrane deformation, budding, and release of the COPII vesicles (5Salama N.R. Yeung T. Schekman R.W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4073-4082Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The retrieval of the Golgi proteins from the compartment at a certain maturation stage is carried out by the COPI vesicles after activation of the G-protein Arf1 and recruitment of coatomer proteins, and the selected cargos are transported to the earlier compartments or to the ER (6Gaynor E.C. Graham T.R. Emr S.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 33-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 7Todorow Z. Spang A. Carmack E. Yates J. Schekman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 13643-13648Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).The first carbohydrates of glycoproteins are transferred from the dolichol intermediates to certain Asn or Ser/Thr residues of the precursor polypeptides in the ER, and then further glycosyl residues are added or modified after moving from the ER to the Golgi (8Dean N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The enzymatic specificity of the glycosyltransferases and their localization in the Golgi compartments correlate with the successive addition of sugar residues. Each Golgi enzyme is attributed to a certain specific compartment through the dynamic maturation process by the exit and entry of selected components in the COPI vesicles. Therefore, the selective incorporation of the cargo proteins in the COPII and COPI vesicles should be very important for maintaining the specific protein composition of Golgi compartments. The motif sequences such as LXX(L/M)E for COPII selection (9Mossessova E. Bickford L.C. Goldberg J.

In addition to the direct selective interaction with the coat subunits (13Springer S. Schekman R. Science. 1998; 281: 698-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), incorporation in the vesicles via interaction with adaptor components has been reported (14Sato K. Nakano A. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 2076-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). A peripheral membrane protein, Vps74, was found to bind to the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of a subset of mannosyltransferases and is required to maintain their Golgi localization (15Schmitz K.R.

Science. 2008; 321: 404-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). However, we have only limited knowledge about the selective transport mechanism of the Golgi glycosyltransferases.Svp26 was discovered as a novel function-unknown protein in our global inspection of membrane proteins in the early Golgi compartment (17Inadome H. Noda Y. Adachi H. Yoda K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 7696-7710Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Svp26 is an integral membrane protein with four predicted transmembrane segments. Although Svp26 is dispensable for viability of the yeast, we found abnormal hypermannosylation of N-glycosyl chains and mislocalization of Golgi mannosyltransferase Ktr3 to the ER in the Δsvp26 disruptant cell. Immunoprecipitation from the cleared lysate using 1% Triton X-100 indicated specific binding between Ktr3 and Svp26. These results suggest that Svp26 functions to ensure the correct localization of Ktr3 in the Golgi compartments.We examined whether other mannosyltransferases depend on Svp26 to localize in the Golgi compartments. In this paper, we report that several mannosyltransferases behave as Ktr3 does, and Svp26 helps the selective incorporation of these mannosyltransferases into the COPII vesicles. The lumenal domains of the cargo are responsible for Svp26 dependence.DISCUSSIONThe Golgi O-mannosyltransferase Ktr3 is found in the ER in the Δsvp26 cells. Here, we examined whether the Golgi localization of the five N-mannosyltransferases, Och1, Mnn1, Mnn2, Mnn5, and Mnn9 are also Svp26-dependent. Mnn2 and Mnn5, like Ktr3, are found in the ER in the absence of Svp26. The Golgi localization of Mnn1 and Mnn9 is not affected. A small amount of Och1 was observed in the ER in half of the cells. We tested whether any of the five N-mannosyltransferases bind to Svp26 by immunoprecipitation from the cleared lysate containing 1% digitonin. Although co-immunoprecipitation from such lysate could not exclude indirect interaction because digitonin leaves many membrane protein complexes intact, Svp26 was not detected in the immunoprecipitate of Mnn1, the Golgi localization of which is independent of Svp26. On the other hand, a significant amount of Svp26 was co-immunoprecipitated with Mnn2 and Mnn5, which suggests that their Golgi localization and ability to interact with Svp26 are somehow related. These interactions are likely to be weaker than the Ktr3-Svp26 interaction, as no Svp26 interaction was detected when using Triton X-100 solubilized membranes. A small amount of Svp26 was detected in the immunoprecipitate of Och1 that shows weak ER mislocalization in the Δsvp26 disruptant. A small amount of Svp26 was also found in the immunoprecipitate of Mnn9, although the Golgi localization of Mnn9 is not affected by the loss of Svp26. Mnn9 exists in the stable complex with Van1 (M-pol I, V-complex) or with four proteins including Anp1 (M-pol II, A-complex) (18Hashimoto H. Yoda K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 682-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 23Jungmann J. Munro S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This complex formation may be more important for the Golgi localization of Mnn9 than its binding to Svp26, or there may be other proteins that bind to and assist the exit of other subunits of the complex, which function redundantly with Svp26 in facilitating the entry of the Mnn9-containing complex into COPII vesicles.Our in vitro budding experiment suggested that the selective incorporation of Ktr3 and Mnn2 in the COPII vesicles is clearly stimulated by Svp26. At the very least, the incorporation of cargo into the COPII vesicle is a stage of Svp26 dependence for Ktr3 and Mnn2. The ER membrane fraction of the Δsvp26 disruptant contains a larger amount of these mannosyltransferases than the wild-type ER fraction (Fig. 5). It is likely that the efficiency of the exit from the ER is retarded in the Δsvp26 disruptant, and Ktr3 and Mnn2 accumulate in the ER. Svp26 is a good cargo for COPII vesicles and efficiently exits from the ER in the in vitro budding assay (data not shown) (25Bue C.A. Bentivoglio C.M. Barlowe C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4780-4789Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Ktr3, Mnn2, and Mnn5 can bind to Svp26. It is most probable that the interaction with Svp26 physically stimulates their incorporation into the COPII vesicles and exit from the ER.It is reported that certain sequence motifs of the cargo molecules are recognized by the Sec24 subunit of the COPII coat (29Votsmeier C. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6742-6750Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These motifs are, for example, found in the cytoplasmic domain of soluble NSF attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins (9Mossessova E. Bickford L.C. Goldberg J. Cell. 2003; 114: 483-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 10Miller E.A. Beilharz T.H. Malkus P.N. Lee M.C. Hamamoto S. Orci L. Schekman R. Cell. 2003; 114: 497-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Also, because Svp26 is efficiently incorporated in the prebudding complex, it may have some sequence motif or structural characteristics that will be recognized by the coat subunits. The Svp26-dependent Golgi mannosyltransferases may therefore indirectly contact with the coat proteins through the direct interaction with Svp26. In other words, Svp26 mediates the interaction between the mannosyltransferase cargo and coat proteins. Therefore, we propose Svp26 acts as a sorting adaptor for COPII coats. Recently, it has been reported that the exit of the vacuolar alkaline phosphatase precursor proPho8 from the ER via COPII vesicle depends on Svp26/Erv26 (30Bue C.A. Barlowe C. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 24049-24060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 31Anand V.C. Daboussi L. Lorenz T.C. Payne G.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 1592-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 32Dancourt J. Barlowe C. Traffic. 2009; 10: 1006-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Investigation of this process revealed that Svp26 acts as the adaptor or receptor for the COPII coat. Also, another type II membrane protein, Gda1, which is a guanosine diphosphatase located in the Golgi, is thought to be dependent on Svp26 for its exit from the ER (31Anand V.C. Daboussi L. Lorenz T.C. Payne G.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 1592-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It is possible that some other proteins with little or no affinity to the coat subunits utilize Svp26 as the adaptor for the COPII coat to efficiently exit the ER. The presence of adaptors for coat proteins is important for accepting a wide variety of proteins into the COPII coat.Svp26 binds to proteins with different molecular masses and with little sequence homology and stimulates the exit of the interacting proteins from the ER. The nature of the interaction between Svp26 and its interacting proteins is largely unknown. However, by the domain exchanging of Svp26-dependent Ktr3 or Mnn2 and Svp26-independent Mnn1, we found the lumenal domains are responsible for the dependence on Svp26 for ER exit. Recently, it has been reported that the lumenal domain of proPho8 interacts with Svp26 (32Dancourt J. Barlowe C. Traffic. 2009; 10: 1006-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). It may be a common feature that Svp26 recognizes the lumenal domains of its interacting proteins.As the lumenal domain of mannosyltransferase is believed to function as the catalytic domain of the enzyme (28Wiggins C.A. Munro S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 7945-7950Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), it is very important when and how the interaction with Svp26 ends after the mannosyltransferase arrives in the Golgi compartment and what effect the interaction with Svp26 may have on the enzyme activity. The N-glycosyl chains of invertase and the modified hen egg lysozyme accept hypermannosylation in the Δsvp26 disruptant (17Inadome H. Noda Y. Adachi H. Yoda K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 7696-7710Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the mechanism of which is completely unknown. If Svp26 acts not only as the sorting adaptor for COPII coats but also as a negative regulator of the enzyme activity to control the degree of mannosylation in the early Golgi, the mannosyltransferases that arrive in the Golgi by a default transport pathway may cause the addition of more mannose in the Δsvp26 disruptant.Even in the absence of Svp26, a small amount of Svp26-dependent mannosyltransferase is delivered in the Golgi by the “default” traffic pathway. This may mean that COPII vesicles nonselectively incorporate components in the ER. Alternatively, there may be a COPII-independent delivery of proteins from the ER to Golgi. A small amount of Mnn2 is released from the ER-enriched fraction even without the addition of purified COPII subunits for an unknown reason (Fig. 4B). This phenomenon is more significant in the Mnn2OP membrane. Interestingly, this release without the addition of the COPII component was significantly decreased in the Δsvp26 ER fraction that has similarly accumulated Mnn2. Therefore, the uncharacterized delivery mechanism, if it exists, seems to also be Svp26-dependent in the case of Mnn2.

A peripheral membrane protein, Vps74, was found to bind to the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of a subset of mannosyltransferases and is required to maintain their Golgi localization (15Schmitz K.R.

Noda Y. Adachi H. Yoda K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 7696-7710Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Svp26 is an integral membrane protein with four predicted transmembrane segments. Although Svp26 is dispensable for viability of the yeast, we found abnormal hypermannosylation of N-glycosyl chains and mislocalization of Golgi mannosyltransferase Ktr3 to the ER in the Δsvp26 disruptant cell. Immunoprecipitation from the cleared lysate using 1% Triton X-100 indicated specific binding between Ktr3 and Svp26. These results suggest that Svp26 functions to ensure the correct localization of Ktr3 in the Golgi compartments.We examined whether other mannosyltransferases depend on Svp26 to localize in the Golgi compartments. In this paper, we report that several mannosyltransferases behave as Ktr3 does, and Svp26 helps the selective incorporation of these mannosyltransferases into the COPII vesicles. The lumenal domains of the cargo are responsible for Svp26 dependence. The Golgi apparatus is comprised of multiple compartments with different components and functions. These compartments are successively formed by the maturation of the earliest compartment derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 2The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumHAhemagglutininGSTglutathione S-transferasemAbmonoclonal antibodyGMPPNPguanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphateGDPβSguanosine 5′-(β-thio)diphosphate. through homotypic fusion of the COPII vesicles (1Pelham H.R. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 45-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The maturation of compartments is believed to occur by removing the components of the earlier compartments and acquiring those of the later compartments in a COPI vesicle-dependent manner (2Losev E.

Nature. 2006; 441: 1007-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The newly synthesized Golgi proteins are first translocated in the ER and then selectively incorporated in the COPII vesicles and transported to the earliest Golgi compartment or the cis-Golgi network. When the small G-protein Sar1 is activated by Sec12 on the ER, Sec23/Sec24 subunits are recruited to form the prebudding complex containing the selected cargo proteins (4Kuehn M.J. Herrmann J.M. Schekman R. Nature. 1998; 391: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Successive binding of Sec13/Sec31 subunits induces ER membrane deformation, budding, and release of the COPII vesicles (5Salama N.R. Yeung T. Schekman R.W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4073-4082Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The retrieval of the Golgi proteins from the compartment at a certain maturation stage is carried out by the COPI vesicles after activation of the G-protein Arf1 and recruitment of coatomer proteins, and the selected cargos are transported to the earlier compartments or to the ER (6Gaynor E.C.

The first carbohydrates of glycoproteins are transferred from the dolichol intermediates to certain Asn or Ser/Thr residues of the precursor polypeptides in the ER, and then further glycosyl residues are added or modified after moving from the ER to the Golgi (8Dean N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The enzymatic specificity of the glycosyltransferases and their localization in the Golgi compartments correlate with the successive addition of sugar residues. Each Golgi enzyme is attributed to a certain specific compartment through the dynamic maturation process by the exit and entry of selected components in the COPI vesicles. Therefore, the selective incorporation of the cargo proteins in the COPII and COPI vesicles should be very important for maintaining the specific protein composition of Golgi compartments.

Although Svp26 is dispensable for viability of the yeast, we found abnormal hypermannosylation of N-glycosyl chains and mislocalization of Golgi mannosyltransferase Ktr3 to the ER in the Δsvp26 disruptant cell.

In this paper, we report that several mannosyltransferases behave as Ktr3 does, and Svp26 helps the selective incorporation of these mannosyltransferases into the COPII vesicles. The lumenal domains of the cargo are responsible for Svp26 dependence. DISCUSSIONThe Golgi O-mannosyltransferase Ktr3 is found in the ER in the Δsvp26 cells. Here, we examined whether the Golgi localization of the five N-mannosyltransferases, Och1, Mnn1, Mnn2, Mnn5, and Mnn9 are also Svp26-dependent. Mnn2 and Mnn5, like Ktr3, are found in the ER in the absence of Svp26. The Golgi localization of Mnn1 and Mnn9 is not affected. A small amount of Och1 was observed in the ER in half of the cells. We tested whether any of the five N-mannosyltransferases bind to Svp26 by immunoprecipitation from the cleared lysate containing 1% digitonin. Although co-immunoprecipitation from such lysate could not exclude indirect interaction because digitonin leaves many membrane protein complexes intact, Svp26 was not detected in the immunoprecipitate of Mnn1, the Golgi localization of which is independent of Svp26. On the other hand, a significant amount of Svp26 was co-immunoprecipitated with Mnn2 and Mnn5, which suggests that their Golgi localization and ability to interact with Svp26 are somehow related. These interactions are likely to be weaker than the Ktr3-Svp26 interaction, as no Svp26 interaction was detected when using Triton X-100 solubilized membranes. A small amount of Svp26 was detected in the immunoprecipitate of Och1 that shows weak ER mislocalization in the Δsvp26 disruptant. A small amount of Svp26 was also found in the immunoprecipitate of Mnn9, although the Golgi localization of Mnn9 is not affected by the loss of Svp26. Mnn9 exists in the stable complex with Van1 (M-pol I, V-complex) or with four proteins including Anp1 (M-pol II, A-complex) (18Hashimoto H. Yoda K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 682-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 23Jungmann J. Munro S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This complex formation may be more important for the Golgi localization of Mnn9 than its binding to Svp26, or there may be other proteins that bind to and assist the exit of other subunits of the complex, which function redundantly with Svp26 in facilitating the entry of the Mnn9-containing complex into COPII vesicles.Our in vitro budding experiment suggested that the selective incorporation of Ktr3 and Mnn2 in the COPII vesicles is clearly stimulated by Svp26. At the very least, the incorporation of cargo into the COPII vesicle is a stage of Svp26 dependence for Ktr3 and Mnn2. The ER membrane fraction of the Δsvp26 disruptant contains a larger amount of these mannosyltransferases than the wild-type ER fraction (Fig. 5). It is likely that the efficiency of the exit from the ER is retarded in the Δsvp26 disruptant, and Ktr3 and Mnn2 accumulate in the ER. Svp26 is a good cargo for COPII vesicles and efficiently exits from the ER in the in vitro budding assay (data not shown) (25Bue C.A. Bentivoglio C.M. Barlowe C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4780-4789Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Ktr3, Mnn2, and Mnn5 can bind to Svp26. It is most probable that the interaction with Svp26 physically stimulates their incorporation into the COPII vesicles and exit from the ER.It is reported that certain sequence motifs of the cargo molecules are recognized by the Sec24 subunit of the COPII coat (29Votsmeier C. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6742-6750Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These motifs are, for example, found in the cytoplasmic domain of soluble NSF attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins (9Mossessova E. Bickford L.C. Goldberg J. Cell. 2003; 114: 483-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 10Miller E.A. Beilharz T.H. Malkus P.N. Lee M.C. Hamamoto S. Orci L. Schekman R. Cell. 2003; 114: 497-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Also, because Svp26 is efficiently incorporated in the prebudding complex, it may have some sequence motif or structural characteristics that will be recognized by the coat subunits. The Svp26-dependent Golgi mannosyltransferases may therefore indirectly contact with the coat proteins through the direct interaction with Svp26. In other words, Svp26 mediates the interaction between the mannosyltransferase cargo and coat proteins. Therefore, we propose Svp26 acts as a sorting adaptor for COPII coats. Recently, it has been reported that the exit of the vacuolar alkaline phosphatase precursor proPho8 from the ER via COPII vesicle depends on Svp26/Erv26 (30Bue C.A. Barlowe C. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 24049-24060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 31Anand V.C. Daboussi L. Lorenz T.C. Payne G.S. Mol. Biol.

Investigation of this process revealed that Svp26 acts as the adaptor or receptor for the COPII coat. Also, another type II membrane protein, Gda1, which is a guanosine diphosphatase located in the Golgi, is thought to be dependent on Svp26 for its exit from the ER (31Anand V.C. Daboussi L. Lorenz T.C. Payne G.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 1592-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It is possible that some other proteins with little or no affinity to the coat subunits utilize Svp26 as the adaptor for the COPII coat to efficiently exit the ER. The presence of adaptors for coat proteins is important for accepting a wide variety of proteins into the COPII coat.Svp26 binds to proteins with different molecular masses and with little sequence homology and stimulates the exit of the interacting proteins from the ER. The nature of the interaction between Svp26 and its interacting proteins is largely unknown. However, by the domain exchanging of Svp26-dependent Ktr3 or Mnn2 and Svp26-independent Mnn1, we found the lumenal domains are responsible for the dependence on Svp26 for ER exit. Recently, it has been reported that the lumenal domain of proPho8 interacts with Svp26 (32Dancourt J. Barlowe C. Traffic. 2009; 10: 1006-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). It may be a common feature that Svp26 recognizes the lumenal domains of its interacting proteins.As the lumenal domain of mannosyltransferase is believed to function as the catalytic domain of the enzyme (28Wiggins C.A. Munro S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 7945-7950Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), it is very important when and how the interaction with Svp26 ends after the mannosyltransferase arrives in the Golgi compartment and what effect the interaction with Svp26 may have on the enzyme activity. The N-glycosyl chains of invertase and the modified hen egg lysozyme accept hypermannosylation in the Δsvp26 disruptant (17Inadome H. Noda Y. Adachi H. Yoda K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 7696-7710Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the mechanism of which is completely unknown. If Svp26 acts not only as the sorting adaptor for COPII coats but also as a negative regulator of the enzyme activity to control the degree of mannosylation in the early Golgi, the mannosyltransferases that arrive in the Golgi by a default transport pathway may cause the addition of more mannose in the Δsvp26 disruptant.Even in the absence of Svp26, a small amount of Svp26-dependent mannosyltransferase is delivered in the Golgi by the “default” traffic pathway. This may mean that COPII vesicles nonselectively incorporate components in the ER. Alternatively, there may be a COPII-independent delivery of proteins from the ER to Golgi. A small amount of Mnn2 is released from the ER-enriched fraction even without the addition of purified COPII subunits for an unknown reason (Fig. 4B). This phenomenon is more significant in the Mnn2OP membrane. Interestingly, this release without the addition of the COPII component was significantly decreased in the Δsvp26 ER fraction that has similarly accumulated Mnn2. Therefore, the uncharacterized delivery mechanism, if it exists, seems to also be Svp26-dependent in the case of Mnn2. The Golgi O-mannosyltransferase Ktr3 is found in the ER in the Δsvp26 cells. Here, we examined whether the Golgi localization of the five N-mannosyltransferases, Och1, Mnn1, Mnn2, Mnn5, and Mnn9 are also Svp26-dependent. Mnn2 and Mnn5, like Ktr3, are found in the ER in the absence of Svp26. The Golgi localization of Mnn1 and Mnn9 is not affected. A small amount of Och1 was observed in the ER in half of the cells.

On the other hand, a significant amount of Svp26 was co-immunoprecipitated with Mnn2 and Mnn5, which suggests that their Golgi localization and ability to interact with Svp26 are somehow related.

A small amount of Svp26 was detected in the immunoprecipitate of Och1 that shows weak ER mislocalization in the Δsvp26 disruptant. A small amount of Svp26 was also found in the immunoprecipitate of Mnn9, although the Golgi localization of Mnn9 is not affected by the loss of Svp26. Mnn9 exists in the stable complex with Van1 (M-pol I, V-complex) or with four proteins including Anp1 (M-pol II, A-complex) (18Hashimoto H. Yoda K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

We recently showed that mutant mice lacking the plasma membrane HSPG, syndecan-1, exhibit hypertriglyceridemia due to delayed clearance of TRL remnants from the circulation associated with reduced VLDL binding, uptake, and degradation in isolated hepatocytes (15Stanford K.I.

Furthermore, mice with undersulfated liver heparan sulfate have the same phenotype (16MacArthur J.M. Bishop J.R. Stanford K.I. Wang L. Bensadoun A. Witztum J.L. Esko J.D. J. Clin.

One of mutants lacked the enzyme N-acetylglucosamine N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase 1 (Ndst1), a biosynthetic enzyme that regulates the overall level of sulfation of heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans. In vivo studies have suggested that IDDM causes reduced expression of Ndst1 (6Kjellén L. Bielefeld D. Hook M.

Invest. 2008; 118: 3247-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), leading to the hypothesis that hypertriglyceridemia was caused by undersulfated heparan sulfate in the liver. In this work, we show that mice with IDDM exhibit reduced [35S]sulfate incorporation into hepatic heparan sulfate. However, the reduction was caused by changes in plasma sulfate concentration after the onset of diabetes rather than any change in heparan sulfate biosynthesis. The application of mass spectrometry showed that hepatic heparan sulfate did not change in content and composition in diabetic mice, and the binding of apolipoprotein E (apoE) and fibroblast growth factor-2 was unaltered. Similarly, no alteration of syndecan-1 protein level was observed in freshly isolated hepatocytes from diabetic mice. Thus, fasting and postprandial hypertriglyceridemia in IDDM does not correlate with altered hepatic heparan sulfate in mice. Male C57BL/6 mice (4 weeks of age) were purchased from Jackson Laboratory and maintained in a temperature-controlled (25 °C) facility with a 12-h light/dark cycle. The derivation and genotyping of Ndst1f/fAlbCre+ mice have been described previously (16MacArthur J.M. Bishop J.R. Stanford K.I. Wang L. Bensadoun A. Witztum J.L. Esko J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Mice were fed laboratory rodent chow (Harlan-Teklad) ad libitum except when fasting blood specimens were obtained. Mice were made diabetic by administering 50 mg/kg body weight of streptozotocin (STZ; Sigma) intraperitoneally for 5 consecutive days. Because of variations in plasma triglycerides in females, only male mice were used in this study. Animals were fasted for 4 h in the morning. Blood glucose levels were monitored using a glucose monitor (Abbott) and test strips after a small tail nick. All experiments were carried out in animals with blood glucose levels between 400 and 500 mg/dl. Prior to experiments, plasma was prepared from retroorbital sinus bleeds to analyze glucose, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels enzymatically (Wako kits). Vitamin A fat tolerance was measured essentially as described in Ref. 19Ishibashi S. Perrey S. Chen Z. Osuga J. Shimada M. Ohashi K. Harada K. Yazaki Y. Yamada N. J. Biol.

Briefly, 27 μCi of [11,12-3H]retinol (44.4 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in ethanol was mixed with 1 ml of corn oil (Sigma). Each mouse received 200 μl of the emulsion directly into the stomach by gavage. Blood was sampled at the times indicated by retroorbital sinus bleedings, and circulating radioactivity in 10 μl of plasma was measured in triplicate by scintillation counting. Heparan sulfate was isolated from whole livers, essentially as described (20Grobe K. Inatani M. Pallerla S.R. Castagnola J. Yamaguchi Y. Esko J.D. Development. 2005; 132: 3777-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). After cutting the portal vein, mice were perfused through the left ventricle with 50 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 8, at 7 ml/min with a syringe pump to remove blood from the liver. Livers were excised, homogenized with a razor blade, and digested overnight with Pronase (2 mg/ml; Roche Applied Science) to degrade proteins, followed by purification of glycopeptides by anion exchange chromatography using DEAE-Sephacel (GE Healthcare). The columns (0.5 ml) were washed with low salt buffer (0.3 m NaCl in 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 6, 10 ml) to remove contaminants, and the glycosaminoglycan fraction was eluted with 2.5 ml of 2 m NaCl. Finally, the glycosaminoglycan preparation was treated with chondroitinase ABC to depolymerize chondroitin sulfate chains, and the heparan sulfate fraction was purified by a second round of anion exchange chromatography. Heparan sulfate fine structure was determined quantitatively by glycan reductive isotope labeling-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (GRIL-LC/MS) as described (21Lawrence R. Olson S.K.

The amount of heparan sulfate was expressed relative to liver wet weight. The molar percentage of each disaccharide was calculated based on the total recovery. In some cases, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1 mCi of Na35SO44 (25 mCi/ml; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and liver [35S]heparan sulfate was isolated after 2 h. Primary hepatocytes were isolated from wild-type and diabetic mice as described (15Stanford K.I. Bishop J.R. Foley E.M. Gonzales J.C. Niesman I.R. Witztum J.L. Esko J.D. J. Clin.

Proteoglycans were isolated from the cell pellets according to a protocol adapted from Reizes et al. (23Reizes O. Lincecum J. Wang Z. Goldberger O. Huang L. Kaksonen M. Ahima R. Hinkes M.T.

Samples were digested for 1 h with a mixture of 2 milliunits/ml heparin lyases I and II and 5 milliunits/ml heparin lyase III and chondroitinase ABC. The deglycosylated core proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (NuPage 4–12% BisTris gel; Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose. Syndecan-1 was detected with mAb 281-2 (BD Pharmingen) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (Santa Cruz). One band was detected at 140 kDa. This band likely represents a syndecan-1 oligomer (24Miettinen H.M. Jalkanen M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1571-1581PubMed Google Scholar, 25Asundi V.K. Carey D.J. J. Biol.

Quantitative reverse transcription PCR was performed exactly as described previously (15Stanford K.I. Bishop J.R. Foley E.M. Gonzales J.C. Niesman I.R. Witztum J.L. Esko J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 3236-3245PubMed Google Scholar). Inorganic sulfate was determined in plasma samples from wild-type and diabetic mice through the University of California San Diego Glycotechnology Core. Samples, blank and standards were hydrolyzed in 0.03 n HCl at 150 °C for 1 h and dried. Each sample was pyrolyzed in an open flame for about 15 s, cooled, and redissolved in water. Sulfate and phosphate anions were separated by a Dionex IonPac AS11HC column, eluted with a gradient mobile phase (2–50 mm KOH at 1 ml/min for 30 min), and quantified by conductivity detection relative to standard solutions. Samples of purified [35S]heparan sulfate (104 cpm) were incubated for 20 min with 10 μg of recombinant apoE (Invitrogen) or fibroblast growth factor-2 (Selective Genetics) in physiological saline with and without 100 μg/ml unfractionated heparin (SPL). Bound material was collected on nitrocellulose membranes by fast vacuum filtration as described (27Kreuger J. Lindahl U. Jemth P. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 363: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Statistical analyses were performed using PRISM software (GraphPad Software). All data are expressed as mean values ± S.D. unless otherwise indicated. Significance was determined using an unpaired Student's (two-tailed) t test. Significance was taken as p < 0.05. Recent studies linking hypertriglyceridemia to altered hepatocyte heparan sulfate chains and expression of the proteoglycan syndecan-1 led us to investigate hepatocyte heparan sulfate in a mouse model of IDDM (15–17). Prior studies have suggested that insulin deficiency causes alterations in heparan sulfate in STZ-induced diabetes (6Kjellén L. Bielefeld D. Hook M.

To study this problem further, IDDM was induced in C57BL/6 mice by low dose injection of STZ on 5 consecutive days. In a typical study group, STZ-treated mice developed hyperglycemia (>400 mg/dl blood glucose) 6–8 weeks after treatment. Approximately 50% of the diabetic mice exhibited mildly elevated fasting plasma triglycerides (Fig. 1A, 51 ± 13 mg/dl in control mice versus 81 ± 20 mg/dl in STZ-treated mice, n = 12/strain, p < 0.003) with no significant change in plasma cholesterol (data not shown). The majority of the triglycerides were present in lipoproteins of d < 1.019 g/ml, consistent with their identification as very low density lipoproteins and chylomicron remnants. To examine the metabolism of dietary triglycerides, fasted mice were given a bolus of corn oil by gavage containing [3H]retinol, which is converted into retinol esters and packaged into chylomicrons (vitamin A fat tolerance test). The amount of [3H]retinol in the plasma was determined at various times (Fig. 1B). In untreated animals, plasma 3H counts rose for 4 h and then decreased over the next 8 h as the retinyl esters containing lipoproteins were cleared in the liver. In STZ-treated animals, plasma counts behaved in a similar manner except the extent of accumulation was greater (Fig. 1B, open circles). The area under the curve was increased 2.3-fold for IDDM mice compared with the controls, indicating that diabetic animals cleared intestinally derived lipoproteins at a slower rate as previously observed (12Ebara T. Conde K. Kako Y. Liu Y. Xu Y. Ramakrishnan R. Goldberg I.J. Shachter N.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1807-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained when plasma triglycerides were assayed (data not shown). Analysis of plasma lipoproteins by ultracentrifugation of samples drawn at 2 h after gavage showed that the majority of the counts and triglycerides were present in large buoyant lipoproteins of d < 1.019 g/ml (data not shown). The reduced clearance of plasma triglycerides might reflect decreased expression of syndecan-1 in IDDM mice compared with wild type. Analysis of syndecan-1 mRNA levels in IDDM liver as well as freshly isolated hepatocytes showed no difference compared with wild type (data not shown). Moreover, we did not detect any difference in syndecan core protein levels by Western blotting of extracts prepared from freshly isolated hepatocytes (Fig. 2A). Thus, altered syndecan-1 expression did not account for the delayed clearance of plasma triglycerides in IDDM mice. Like diabetic mice, mutant mice lacking the heparan sulfate biosynthetic enzyme Ndst1 in hepatocytes (Ndst1f/fAlbCre+ mice) exhibited delayed clearance of dietary triglycerides and fasting hypertriglyceridemia (16MacArthur J.M. Bishop J.R. Stanford K.I. Wang L. Bensadoun A. Witztum J.L. Esko J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), suggesting that the hypertriglyceridemia observed in IDDM might be due to altered heparan sulfate composition. Previous studies have shown that IDDM leads to ∼50% decreased incorporation of [35S]sulfate into liver heparan sulfate chains in vivo (6Kjellén L. Bielefeld D. Hook M. Diabetes. 1983; 32: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 10Kofoed-Enevoldsen A. Eriksson U.J.

Similarly, we observed a reduction (57 ± 27%) in the amount of [35S]heparan sulfate produced in diabetic mouse liver compared with controls (Fig. 2B). A similar level of reduction was also observed in Ndst1f/fAlbCre+ mice, which produce undersulfated heparan sulfate chains (50 ± 13%). To determine whether the composition of heparan sulfate was altered, we analyzed chemically heparan sulfate in normal and diabetic liver. Surprisingly, the mass of heparan sulfate (micrograms of heparan sulfate/gram of liver) purified from IDDM mouse livers from animals with hypertriglyceridemia was equal to control (n = 9/strain) or Ndst1-deficient liver (n = 3) (Fig. 2C). To determine whether the extent of sulfation changed (glucosamine N-sulfation, uronyl 2-O-sulfation, or glucosamine 6-O-sulfation), we compared the disaccharide composition of the chains obtained from diabetic animals with wild type and Ndst1f/fAlbCre+ mice using GRIL-LC/MS, a quantitative method for analyzing heparan sulfate composition. The total amount of N-sulfated, 2-O-sulfated, and 6-O-sulfated disaccharides derived from IDDM liver heparan sulfate appeared unchanged compared with heparan sulfate obtained from the wild type (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, the composition of individual disaccharides did not vary as well (Table 1). Similar findings were obtained in IDDM glomerular HSPGs as well (29van den Born J. Pisa B. Bakker M.A. Celie J.W. Straatman C. Thomas S. Viberti G.C. Kjellen L. Berden J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29606-29613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In contrast, Ndst1-deficient liver contained heparan sulfate chains with reduced N-sulfation and uronic acid 2-O-sulfation, as noted previously (17Stanford K.I. Wang L. Castagnola J. Song D. Bishop J.R. Brown J.R. Lawrence R. Bai X. Habuchi H. Tanaka M. Cardoso W.V. Kimata K. Esko J.D. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab These findings contrast studies of experimentally diabetic rats in which insulin resistance was associated with production of HSPGs with reduced negative charge compared with HSPGs from control rats (6Kjellén L.

Hamai H. Reid B.N. Blaner W.S. Huang L.S. Diabetes. 2008; 57: 1674-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although we have not measured Ndst1 expression or enzyme activity, the compositional studies demonstrate clearly that no change in sulfation occurred. The discrepancy between our findings and earlier studies may reflect the animal model under study (rats versus mice). How these results relate to type 1 and type 2 diabetes in humans remains to be determined. Conceivably, the pattern of sulfated disaccharides might be altered in IDDM liver heparan sulfate in a way that might affect binding to protein ligands. [35S]Heparan sulfate chains were purified from control and IDDM mice and incubated with apoE or fibroblast growth factor-2. The complexes that formed were collected on nitrocellulose membranes. The extent of binding of IDDM liver heparan sulfate to both proteins was equal to control liver heparan sulfate (Fig. 3). In contrast, the extent of binding to heparan sulfate from Ndst1f/fAlbCre+ was dramatically reduced. Binding of these ligands to liver heparan sulfate was completely inhibited by the addition of exogenous heparin, demonstrating the specificity of the interaction (data not shown). Similarly, van den Born and co-workers (29van den Born J. Pisa B. Bakker M.A. Celie J.W. Straatman C. Thomas S. Viberti G.C. Kjellen L. Berden J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29606-29613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) found that the protein binding properties as well as the disaccharide composition of heparan sulfate derived from control and diabetic glomeruli did not differ. What is the explanation for the decrease in 35SO4 incorporation observed here and in prior studies? Earlier work suggested that diabetes can result in alterations in plasma and tissue sulfate pools (30Cohen M.P. Surma M.L. Diabetes. 1984; 33: 8-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 31Spiro M.J. Diabetologia. 1987; 30: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 32Fan M.Y. Templeton D.M. Diabetes Metab. 1992; 18: 98-103PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the decrease in 35S incorporation might have simply resulted from differences in the radiospecific activity of the 35SO4 in the plasma or in the liver. Indeed, endogenous plasma sulfate concentration in diabetic mice was ∼3-fold greater than in wild-type mice or Ndst1f/fAlbCre+ mice (Fig. 4). The source of elevated plasma sulfate could be caused by altered anion filtration by the kidney due to diabetic nephropathy (33Blazquez-Medela A.M. López-Novoa J.M. Martínez-Salgado C. Curr. Diabetes Rev. 2010; 6: 68-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Alternatively, IDDM is also known to induce gluconeogenesis, which could lead to the increased conversion of cysteine and methionine to pyruvate causing the release of inorganic sulfate from these amino acids. The release of inorganic sulfate from sulfur containing amino acids can be significant, providing all of the sulfate needed for glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis in cultured cells (34Esko J.D. Elgavish A. Prasthofer T. Taylor W.H. Weinke J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15725-15733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, IDDM-induced hypertriglyceridemia in mice is not associated with any obvious changes in liver heparan sulfate content or composition. Although the affinity of the heparan sulfate chains for other factors involved in lipoprotein metabolism might be altered, we believe it more likely that IDDM induces changes in TRL composition that reduce the affinity of the particles for liver heparan sulfate. In support of this hypothesis, it has been shown that TRL in IDDM plasma exhibit reduced apoE and elevated apoC content potentially due to defects in lipoprotein lipase-mediated hydrolysis of triglycerides (35Levy E. Shafrir E. Ziv E. Bar-On H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 834: 376-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, we believe that the more likely explanation for elevated plasma triglycerides is a change in the processing of lipoproteins in the extrahepatic circulation rather than clearance mediated by HSPGs. Studies are currently under way to address whether these changes affect the affinity and uptake of lipoproteins by other liver receptors such as low density lipoprotein receptor or low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein."

Pol-prim consists of a primase heterodimer that synthesizes RNA primers, a DNA polymerase that extends them, and a fourth subunit, p68 (also termed B-subunit), that is thought to regulate the complex. Although significant knowledge about single-subunit primases of prokaryotes has accumulated, the functions and regulation of pol-prim remain poorly understood. In the SV40 replication model, the p68 subunit is required for primosome activity and binds directly to the hexameric viral helicase T antigen, suggesting a functional link between T antigen-p68 interaction and primosome activity. To explore this link, we first mapped the interacting regions of the two proteins and discovered a previously unrecognized N-terminal globular domain of p68 (p68N) that physically interacts with the T antigen helicase domain. NMR spectroscopy was used to determine the solution structure of p68N and map its interface with the T antigen helicase domain. Structure-guided mutagenesis of p68 residues in the interface diminished T antigen-p68 interaction, confirming the interaction site. SV40 primosome activity of corresponding pol-prim mutants decreased in proportion to the reduction in p68N-T antigen affinity, confirming that p68-T antigen interaction is vital for primosome function. A model is presented for how this interaction regulates SV40 primosome activity, and the implications of our findings are discussed in regard to the molecular mechanisms of eukaryotic DNA replication initiation.

https://openalex.org/W2122852534,"Gamma-secretase is an intramembrane-cleaving protease responsible for the final proteolytic event in the production of the amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Inhibition of gamma-secretase activity is thus an attractive therapeutic strategy to slow down the pathogenesis of AD. Drugs often target more than one biomolecule because of conserved 3-dimensional structures in prospective protein binding sites. We have capitalized on this phenomenon of nature to identify new gamma-secretase inhibitors. Here we show that 2-hydroxy naphthyl derivatives, a previously identified subclass of NAD(+) analog inhibitors of sirtuin 2 (SIRT2), are direct gamma-secretase inhibitors. Subsequent structure-activity relationship studies further showed that 2-hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde is the minimal pharmacophore for gamma-secretase inhibition. In evaluating target protein determinants of inhibition, we identified a common GXG signature nucleotide-binding site (NBS) shared by the gamma-secretase subunit presenilin-1 C-terminal fragment (PS1-CTF), SIRT2, and Janus kinase 3 (JAK3). Because a detailed 3-dimensional structure of gamma-secretase is beyond our knowledge, we took advantage of the known crystal structure of human JAK3 to model the NBS of the PS1-CTF, which includes the catalytic residue D385. Our results suggest that the flexible PS1-CTF (381)LGLG(384) loop comprises a substrate-docking site capable of recognizing specifically different gamma-secretase substrates."

https://openalex.org/W2111123813,"Recently, we reported a novel transcriptional repressor, ZIP (for zinc finger and G-patch domain-containing), which recruits the Mi-2/NuRD (nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase) complex and represses the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). In doing so, ZIP inhibits cell proliferation and suppresses breast carcinogenesis. Here, we report the cloning and the characterization of an alternatively spliced isoform of ZIP, sZIP. sZIP is an N-terminal truncated form of ZIP, lacking the zinc finger but retaining part of the G-patch domain and C-terminal coiled-coil domain of ZIP. We showed that sZIP could interact with the NuRD complex but lost its DNA-binding capacity. We demonstrated that sZIP antagonizes the transcription repression by ZIP by competing for the binding of the NuRD complex and that sZIP alleviates the growth inhibitory effect of ZIP on hepatocarcinoma cells through attenuating the transcriptional repression of EGFR. Our data provide a finely tuned mechanism for EGFR regulation and add another player for transcription repression."

Most helicases require a single-stranded overhang for loading onto the duplex DNA substrates. Some helicases have been observed to exhibit an enhanced unwinding efficiency with increasing length of the single-stranded DNA tail both by preventing reannealing of the unwound DNA and by compensating for premature dissociation of the leading monomers. Here we report a previously unknown mutual inhibition of neighboring monomers in DNA unwinding by the monomeric Escherichia coli RecQ helicase. With single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer microscopy, we observed that the unwinding initiation of RecQ at saturating concentrations was more delayed for a long rather than a short tailed DNA. In stopped-flow kinetic studies under both single and multiple turnover conditions, the unwinding efficiency decreased with increasing enzyme concentration for long tailed substrates. In addition, preincubation of RecQ and DNA in the presence of 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate was observed to alleviate the inhibition. We propose that the mutual inhibition effect results from a forced closure of cleft between the two RecA-like domains of a leading monomer by a trailing one, hence the forward movements of both monomers are stalled by prohibition of ATP binding to the leading one.

The helicase activity relies on a chemical to physical energy transfer process that is achieved via conformational changes guided by nucleotide state transitions. Available crystal structures have revealed that superfamily I and II helicases contain two RecA-like domains and the NTP binding site is located in a cleft between the two domains (5Singleton M.R.

Almost all signature motifs of the two superfamily helicases are clustered at the NTP binding site and around the bound DNA (5Singleton M.R. Dillingham M.S. Wigley D.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 23-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar), implying a closely related mechanochemical coupling pathway in these helicases. Furthermore, the cleft between the two domains and the mode of their interaction with DNA vary with the nucleotide state (7Velankar S.S. Soultanas P. Dillingham M.S. Subramanya H.S. Wigley D.B.

Zhang X.D. Qian M. Pan B.Y. Xi X.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 1976-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), unwind DNA more efficiently with increasing length of the ssDNA. The reasons are obvious: the additionally bound molecules may prevent the reannealing of the partially unwound DNA. In addition, for a helicase with limited processivity, the additional molecules may continue the unwinding if the functioning unit at the ss/dsDNA junction dissociates prematurely from the DNA substrate. But it is not very clear whether other types of interaction exist between the helicase active units (monomers, dimers, or hexamers) in DNA unwinding. Escherichia coli RecQ is the first member of an important helicase family named after it. RecQ family helicases belong to superfamily II and play important roles in maintaining genomic stability (17Hickson I.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 18Bennett R.J. Keck J.L. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 39: 79-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Defects in three of the five RecQ family members in humans, WRN, BLM, and RECQ4, lead to human genetic diseases, Werner, Bloom, and Rothmund-Thomson syndromes, respectively (17Hickson I.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 18Bennett R.J. Keck J.L. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 39: 79-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence suggest that RecQ helicases act at multiple steps in DNA metabolisms, including stabilization of replication forks and removal of DNA recombination intermediates, to maintain genome integrity. As a prototype of the family, E. coli RecQ has been widely studied previously. DNA unwinding kinetic analyses demonstrate that E. coli RecQ may be active as monomers (15Zhang X.D. Dou S.X. Xie P. Hu J.S. Wang P.Y. Xi X.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12655-12663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 19Xu H.Q. Deprez E. Zhang A.H. Tauc P. Ladjimi M.M. Brochon J.C.

Crystal structures of its helicase core show that the two RecA-like domains are similar to that of superfamily I helicases such as Rep and PcrA (20Bernstein D.A. Zittel M.C. Keck J.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4910-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Thus it is very probable that RecQ translocates along ssDNA and unwinds dsDNA in an inchworm manner. In this work we present our observation of a mutual inhibition effect of neighboring monomers in DNA unwinding of E. coli RecQ. In both single molecule and stopped-flow kinetic experiments, the helicase activity was reduced rather than enhanced for a duplex DNA with a long 3′-ssDNA tail compared with that with a short tail. The additionally bound RecQ monomers inhibited the active helicase monomer at the ss/dsDNA junction. This effect very probably arises from an impediment of ATP binding to the leading active monomer by the trailing one. It is direct evidence for the relative movements of the two RecA-like domains of RecQ in DNA unwinding. In principle, the inhibition effect may be ubiquitous to both superfamily I and II helicases. All chemicals were reagent grade, and all buffers were prepared in ultrapure water from a Milli-Q water purification system (Millipore) having resistivity greater than 18.2 mΩ·cm. As in our previous stopped-flow kinetic studies (15Zhang X.D. Dou S.X. Xie P. Hu J.S. Wang P.Y. Xi X.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12655-12663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), all the present unwinding reactions were performed at 25 °C and in buffers containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5 at 25 °C), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. The only difference is that the ATP concentrations used in the present study were varied rather than remaining constant (1 mm). E. coli RecQ protein was expressed and purified as described (19Xu H.Q. Deprez E. Zhang A.H. Tauc P. Ladjimi M.M. Brochon J.C. Auclair C. Xi X.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34925-34933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Its purity was determined by SDS-PAGE analysis and found to be >95%. The DNA substrates used in the single molecule unwinding studies were 5′-ATC CGT CGA GCA GAG TCy5(dTN)-3′ and 5′-Cy3-ACT CTG CTC GAC GGA T-3′ Biotin. Cy3 and Cy5 were incorporated in phosphoramidite forms, and biotin was added as BiotinTEG CPG during oligonucleotide synthesis. DNA substrates used in the bulk unwinding assays had both strands labeled with fluorescein (F) and hexachlorofluorescein (H), respectively. Their structures and sequences are 5′-CTC TGC TCG ACG GAT T-F-3′ and 5′-H-AAT CCG TCG AGC AGA G(dTN)-3′, respectively. The protein trap used in the single turnover kinetic experiments was a 56-nt poly(dT) (dT56). Single-stranded oligonucleotides, with or without labels, were purchased from the Shanghai Sangon Biological Engineering Technology & Services Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China), and all synthetic oligonucleotides were purified by high performance liquid chromatography. A 50 μm working stock of dsDNA was prepared by mixing equal concentrations of complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides in a 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0 at 25 °C) containing 100 mm NaCl, followed by heating to 90 °C. After equilibrating for 3 min, annealing was allowed by slow cooling to room temperature. PEG surfaces that contain a small fraction (∼1%) of biotinylated PEG molecules were prepared using almost the same procedure as described previously (21Ha T. Rasnik I. Cheng W. Babcock H.P. Gauss G.H. Lohman T.M. Chu S. Nature. 2002; 419: 638-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 22Rasnik I. Myong S. Cheng W. Lohman T.M. Ha T. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 395-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In brief, first, the glass coverslips and quartz slides were soaked in a 1% (v/v) solution of an amino-silane reagent (Vectabond, Vector Labs) in acetone and then soaked for 3 h with a PEG solution, containing 10% (w/w) M-PEG-SPA Mr 5000 (Nektar Therapeutics) and 0.1% (w/w) biotin-PEG-SPA Mr 3400 (Nektar Therapeutics) in 0.1 m sodium bicarbonate (pH 8.3). After the surfaces were coated, a sample cell was constructed by putting the PEG-coated side of the coverslip over the PEG-coated side of the quartz slide separated by a 100-mm thick spacer (3M double sided tape). Two 0.9-mm diameter holes were drilled into the quartz slide to form the inlet and outlet. Remaining boundaries between the sample cell and outside were sealed using epoxy. Once constructed, the sample cells were kept in a dry environment. A wide-field total internal reflection fluorescence microscope based on an inverted microscope (IX-71, Olympus) was used to image an area of 50 × 100 μm to an intensified digital CCD camera (I-PentaMAX-512EFT, Roper Scientific). Molecules were excited using a Nd:YVO4 laser at 532 nm (Verdi-2, Coherent) through a quartz prism placed over a quartz slide via a thin layer of immersion oil. The incident angle of the laser was controlled to achieve total internal reflection at the interface between the quartz slide and aqueous imaging buffer. Fluorescently labeled DNA molecules are attached to this interface. Fluorescence signal was collected using a water immersion objective (Olympus UplanSApo ×60, 1.2 numerical aperture). After rejecting the scattered laser light using a holographic notch filter at 532 nm (HNPF-532.0, Kaiser Optical Systems, Inc.), the imaging area was defined using a vertical slit located at the imaging plane of the microscope. The emission was subsequently collimated using a 20-cm focal length achromat lens (China Daheng Group, Inc.), split by a long pass extended reflection dichroic mirror at 610 nm (610DCLP, Chroma), recombined using an identical dichroic mirror after reflecting off a mirror each, and was finally imaged onto the intensified CCD using another 20-cm focal length achromat lens. To further reduce the cross-talk of signals, two band-pass filters were used in the two signal channels for Cy3 (S568/50M, Chroma) and Cy5 (D675/50M, Chroma). Donor Cy3 and acceptor Cy5 images were laterally displaced and each occupied one-half of the intensified CCD. Each fluorescent spot in the donor channel has a corresponding one in the acceptor channel, coming from the same DNA in the sample. All images were acquired with MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging). In the experiments, the sample cell was first fixed on the stage of the microscope. Then streptavidin (Roche Applied Science) was added followed by the addition of 30–50 pm biotinylated Cy3- and Cy5-labeled DNA substrate. After washing off the unbound DNA, immobilized DNA was imaged in the unwinding buffer. To reduce the photobleaching effect, an oxygen scavenger system (0.1 mg/ml of glucose oxidase, 0.02 mg/ml of catalase, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.4% (w/w) β-d-glucose) was used to increase photostability of the fluorophores. Unwinding reaction was initiated by the simultaneous addition of RecQ and ATP. All the stopped-flow kinetic DNA unwinding assays were carried out using a Bio-logic SFM-400 mixer and a MOS450/AF-CD optical system, as described previously (15Zhang X.D. Dou S.X. Xie P. Hu J.S. Wang P.Y. Xi X.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12655-12663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The unwinding processes were observed by monitoring the fluorescence signal change of fluorescein at 525 nm due to the disruption of FRET between fluorescein and hexachlorofluorescein as the two molecules are separated. The unwinding efficiencies were obtained by calibration measurements as described (15Zhang X.D. Dou S.X. Xie P. Hu J.S. Wang P.Y. Xi X.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12655-12663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In the bulk DNA unwinding assays, the ATP concentration might be significantly reduced or even depleted due to continuous hydrolysis by the helicase, especially when the ATP concentration was low. To avoid any effect in this aspect, 20 mm phosphocreatine and creatine phosphokinase (30 units/ml) were added in the reaction buffers in all bulk measurements. For the dissociation kinetic assay of the helicase from DNA substrate, the helicase was preincubated with the DNA substrate (labeled only with fluorescein) in one syringe, whereas the protein trap (dT56) together with or without the nucleotide cofactor AMPPNP were preincubated in another syringe. The reaction was initiated by rapid mixing of the two syringes. The sample was excited at 492 nm and anisotropy was monitored at 525 nm. Decreasing of the fluorescence anisotropy reflected the helicase dissociation process. We used a single molecule FRET assay, similar to that used by Ha et al. (21Ha T. Rasnik I. Cheng W. Babcock H.P. Gauss G.H. Lohman T.M. Chu S. Nature. 2002; 419: 638-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), to observe the unwinding of individual DNA molecules. The DNA substrate was a 16-bp duplex DNA with a 3′-ssDNA tail. The donor (Cy3) and acceptor (Cy5) fluorophores were attached at the ss/dsDNA junction (Fig. 1A). The DNA was tethered to a polymer-passive quartz surface via biotin. The Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescence signals were separated but simultaneously detected with an intensified CCD (Fig. 1B). After addition of a RecQ and ATP solution (20 μl), a characteristic time (defined as initiation time) elapsed before we observed opposite changes of the Cy3 and Cy5 signals and a corresponding FRET decrease that was caused by the increase in interfluorophore distance as the DNA was unwound (Fig. 2). Here the time it took for FRET efficiency to drop from the high to low levels was defined as partial unwinding time because, as will be seen later, this FRET efficiency change may not correspond to a complete unwinding of the whole DNA duplex. At a fixed ATP concentration, we observed that the initiation time for the 20-nt 3′-ssDNA-tailed DNA substrate was longer than that for the 6-nt substrate (Fig. 3). At first glance, this seems to be reasonable as two or more RecQ monomers might bind to the long tail of the 20-nt substrate. If the monomer pre-bound at the ss/dsDNA junction failed to initiate unwinding due to premature detachment, the other monomer(s) pre-bound farther away from the junction would translocate along the ssDNA to the junction and take on the unwinding task, thus resulting in a longer initiation time. We noticed, however, that the partial unwinding time (Fig. 4), although dependent on ATP concentration, was much shorter than the initiation time at a given ATP concentration. Assuming that the ssDNA translocation rate of RecQ is the same as the dsDNA unwinding rate (usually the former is much higher than the latter as can be known from available data for other helicases such as UvrD (23Fischer C.J. Maluf N.K. Lohman T.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 1287-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar)), then the time it takes for the second (i.e. trailing) monomer to reach the ss/dsDNA junction by translocating along the ssDNA tail would be at most only several seconds, far from enough to account for the much prolonged unwinding initiation time.FIGURE 4Histograms of partial unwinding time at two different ATP concentrations for the 20-nt-tailed 16-bp DNA substrate. The RecQ concentration was 40 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We now think of another possible interpretation. Like other superfamily I and II helicases, RecQ has two RecA-like domains with the ATP binding site located between them (Fig. 5A) (20Bernstein D.A. Zittel M.C. Keck J.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4910-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). According to crystal structures of PcrA and UvrD in complex with DNA (7Velankar S.S. Soultanas P. Dillingham M.S. Subramanya H.S. Wigley D.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 75-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 8Lee J.Y. Yang W. Cell. 2006; 127: 1349-1360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), the cleft between the two RecA-like domains is opened in the apo state and closed upon ATP binding. So what will happen if two RecQ monomers simultaneously bind to the ssDNA tail of the DNA substrate? The cleft in the leading helicase without bound ATP, originally in the open form, may be forced to close by the binding or forward movement of the trailing monomer (Fig. 5B). Then ATP access to the cleft of the leading helicase would be significantly obstructed, resulting in a stall of forward movement for both helicases. The stall, however, may be temporary because the thermal fluctuations of the two RecA-like domains may provide the opportunity for ATP to bind. As easily imaginable, the lower the ATP concentration, the more difficult it is for the leading monomer to bind an ATP and restore the unwinding. As will be seen in the following bulk single turnover kinetic experiments, the mutual inhibition effect is indeed more obvious at low ATP concentrations. To verify the mutual inhibition effect hypothesis, we repeated the experiments at a lower RecQ concentration (10 nm). Our logic is that the probability should be much reduced for simultaneous binding of multiple RecQ monomers to the 20-nt ssDNA tail and thus the inhibition effect may be eliminated. As can be seen in Fig. 6, the situation was indeed changed: the initiation time for the 20-nt 3′-ssDNA-tailed DNA substrate became shorter than that for the 6-nt substrate. Several points may be noticed by comparing the results in FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6 at the same ATP concentration (10 μm). (i) The unwinding initiation times were similar for the two different RecQ concentrations in the case of the 6-nt-tailed substrate where the mutual inhibition effect is always absent. (ii) The unwinding initiation time was longer at a saturated RecQ concentration due to the mutual inhibition effect in the case of 20-nt-tailed substrate. (iii) At the low RecQ concentration, the initiation times for the two different substrates were expected to be similar as the mutual inhibition effect was absent in both cases, but actually they were quite different. As a helicase usually has low binding affinity for DNA substrates with short tails (24Levin M.K. Gurjar M. Patel S.S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 429-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), one plausible explanation is that RecQ monomers bound more slowly (or less readily) to the short tailed substrate. In principle, if the mutual inhibition effect exists for the two bound monomers at the moment of unwinding initiation, it should also exist during the DNA unwinding process because a helicase monomer translocating along ssDNA can easily catch up with a functional monomer at the ss/dsDNA junction. The 16-bp DNA substrate that we used before may be too short, or not suitable for observing the inhibition phenomenon during DNA unwinding. We therefore repeated the experiment using a longer DNA substrate. This substrate was a 30-bp dsDNA with a 20-nt 3′ tail. In addition, the labeling positions of Cy3 and Cy5 were exchanged (see inset of Fig. 7A) so that the fluorescence signal of Cy3 would disappear as soon as the duplex was totally unwound. Shown in Fig. 7 is a typical unwinding time course observed in the experiment. In this case, the unwinding started at ∼6 s. But then, the Cy3-labeled ssDNA remained there until ∼55 s. This implies that a complete unwinding of the whole duplex took as long as ∼49 s. So what happened? We may imagine that when the unwinding was started at ∼6 s by a RecQ monomer, Cy3 fluorescence was quickly increased and Cy5 fluorescence was quickly decreased due to fast separation of the two fluorophores. But what happened now is that another monomer caught up with the functional monomer and caused a stall of the unwinding. As the two fluorophores were still separated by the two monomers, their fluorescence did not change. The stall would be terminated and the unwinding reinitiated as soon as ATP bound to the first monomer or one of the two monomers dissociated. Finally, the whole duplex was totally unwound and the Cy3-labeled ssDNA segment was diffused away at 55 s. It is not difficult to imagine that before unwinding the whole duplex was finished, events of partial unwinding and temporary stall might have alternatively occurred several times accompanied with the dynamic binding and dissociation of the helicase monomers. According to the above analysis, the time interval between the fluorescence jump and drop of Cy3 was defined as the unwinding time in the present experiment. The distributions of unwinding time at different ATP concentrations are given in Fig. 8. Clearly, the present unwinding time was much longer than that expected for the 30-bp substrate based on the unwinding time for the 16-bp substrate (Fig. 4). In addition, the unwinding time decreased with increasing ATP concentration, consistent with the idea that the inhibition effect is less serious or the stall time shorter at higher ATP concentrations. It is worth emphasizing that the fluorescence drop of Cy3 as shown in Fig. 7A could not be caused by re-annealing the two ssDNA generated by unwinding because the fluorescence of Cy5 did not show a corresponding rise. It was not caused by photobleaching either, because the time interval between the fluorescence jump and drop of Cy3 depended on ATP concentration (Fig. 8). In addition, our control showed that photobleaching was negligible in our experiments. From the present experimental results with the 30-bp DNA substrate, we know that the drop of FRET efficiency from the high to low levels (Fig. 7A) resulted from a quick separation of Cy3 and Cy5 after initiation of DNA unwinding. Although the separation was large enough to disrupt FRET between the two fluorophores, the dsDNA was not unwound completely. That is why we used the term “partial unwinding time” in previous experiments with the 16-bp substrates (Fig. 2). Now one may wonder how much DNA duplex was unwound to cause a separation that was large enough to disrupt the FRET between Cy3 and Cy5. According to a theoretical prediction for FRET efficiency (25Ha T. Methods. 2001; 25: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), a separation of 5 nm should be enough for such a disruption. With an ssDNA length per base of 0.4 nm, a 5-nm separation requires at least an unwinding of 5/2/0.4 = ∼6 bp duplex DNA. Thus the actual time for unwinding the whole 16-bp substrate might be 2–3 times longer than that given in Fig. 4. But even so, the unwinding time is still much shorter than the observed initiation time (Fig. 3). To study systematically the mutual inhibition effect, we then resorted to bulk stopped-flow kinetic measurements while using the same 6- and 20-nt-tailed 16-bp DNA substrates. First we carried out a DNA unwinding assay under multiple turnover conditions similar to that in the above single molecule experiments. In this assay, 2 nm DNA substrate was first preincubated with RecQ at a concentration varying from 5 to 60 nm in the reaction buffer at 25 °C for 5 min and the unwinding reaction was initiated by adding ATP. Under these conditions, we observed that the unwinding kinetics were biphasic for both 6- and 20-nt-tailed substrates (data not shown). From fitting of the unwinding curves, the amplitudes for the fast and slow phases as a function of RecQ concentration were obtained (Fig. 9). For the 6-nt substrate, the amplitude for the fast phase Afast increased with increasing RecQ concentration and then became saturated (at ∼75%), whereas for the slow phase, Aslow showed a reversed trend: decreasing with increasing RecQ concentration and then was stabilized (at ∼15%). For the 20-nt substrate the trends were somewhat different. Afast first increased with increasing RecQ concentration, just like that for the 6-nt substrate. But after reaching a maximum (∼80%), Afast started to decrease with a further increasing of RecQ concentration. As in the case of the 6-nt substrate, Aslow showed a reversed trend. These results are interesting. We think they may be understood as follows. In the case of the 6-nt substrate, the DNA provided a single binding site for RecQ. As the fraction of DNA with a bound RecQ monomer before unwinding initiation (i.e. during the preincubation process) would increase and then become saturated with increasing RecQ concentration, so did the fast phase that was contributed by the pre-bound monomers on the substrates. The slow phase was contributed by monomers that bound to the vacant substrates in the course of DNA unwinding. Thus it decreased with increasing RecQ conce"
