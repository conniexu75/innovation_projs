https://openalex.org/W3014233146,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes the infectious disease COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), which was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Despite extensive efforts to control the disease, COVID-19 has now spread to more than 100 countries and caused a global pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have originated in bats; however, the intermediate animal sources of the virus are unknown. In this study, we investigated the susceptibility of ferrets and animals in close contact with humans to SARS-CoV-2. We found that SARS-CoV-2 replicates poorly in dogs, pigs, chickens, and ducks, but ferrets and cats are permissive to infection. Additionally, cats are susceptible to airborne transmission. Our study provides insights into the animal models for SARS-CoV-2 and animal management for COVID-19 control."
https://openalex.org/W3015207233,"Present estimates suggest that of the 359 million tons of plastics produced annually worldwide1, 150–200 million tons accumulate in landfill or in the natural environment2. Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is the most abundant polyester plastic, with almost 70 million tons manufactured annually worldwide for use in textiles and packaging3. The main recycling process for PET, via thermomechanical means, results in a loss of mechanical properties4. Consequently, de novo synthesis is preferred and PET waste continues to accumulate. With a high ratio of aromatic terephthalate units—which reduce chain mobility—PET is a polyester that is extremely difficult to hydrolyse5. Several PET hydrolase enzymes have been reported, but show limited productivity6,7. Here we describe an improved PET hydrolase that ultimately achieves, over 10 hours, a minimum of 90 per cent PET depolymerization into monomers, with a productivity of 16.7 grams of terephthalate per litre per hour (200 grams per kilogram of PET suspension, with an enzyme concentration of 3 milligrams per gram of PET). This highly efficient, optimized enzyme outperforms all PET hydrolases reported so far, including an enzyme8,9 from the bacterium Ideonella sakaiensis strain 201-F6 (even assisted by a secondary enzyme10) and related improved variants11–14 that have attracted recent interest. We also show that biologically recycled PET exhibiting the same properties as petrochemical PET can be produced from enzymatically depolymerized PET waste, before being processed into bottles, thereby contributing towards the concept of a circular PET economy. Computer-aided engineering produces improvements to an enzyme that breaks down poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) into its constituent monomers, which are used to synthesize PET of near-petrochemical grade that can be further processed into bottles."

In data from China collected in February 2020, Maier and Brockmann noticed that, unexpectedly, the epidemic did not take off exponentially. Nonexponential spread occurs when the supply of susceptible individuals is depleted on a time scale comparable to the infectious period of the virus. The results of the authors' modeling approach indicate that the public response to the epidemic plus containment policies were becoming effective despite the initial increase in confirmed cases.

https://openalex.org/W3013413712,"Checkpoint blockade therapies have improved cancer treatment, but such immunotherapy regimens fail in a large subset of patients. Conventional type 1 dendritic cells (DC1s) control the response to checkpoint blockade in preclinical models and are associated with better overall survival in patients with cancer, reflecting the specialized ability of these cells to prime the responses of CD8+ T cells1-3. Paradoxically, however, DC1s can be found in tumours that resist checkpoint blockade, suggesting that the functions of these cells may be altered in some lesions. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing in human and mouse non-small-cell lung cancers, we identify a cluster of dendritic cells (DCs) that we name 'mature DCs enriched in immunoregulatory molecules' (mregDCs), owing to their coexpression of immunoregulatory genes (Cd274, Pdcd1lg2 and Cd200) and maturation genes (Cd40, Ccr7 and Il12b). We find that the mregDC program is expressed by canonical DC1s and DC2s upon uptake of tumour antigens. We further find that upregulation of the programmed death ligand 1 protein-a key checkpoint molecule-in mregDCs is induced by the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL, while upregulation of interleukin (IL)-12 depends strictly on interferon-γ and is controlled negatively by IL-4 signalling. Blocking IL-4 enhances IL-12 production by tumour-antigen-bearing mregDC1s, expands the pool of tumour-infiltrating effector T cells and reduces tumour burden. We have therefore uncovered a regulatory module associated with tumour-antigen uptake that reduces DC1 functionality in human and mouse cancers."

https://openalex.org/W2985416905,"Silicon crystallized in the usual cubic (diamond) lattice structure has dominated the electronics industry for more than half a century. However, cubic silicon (Si), germanium (Ge) and SiGe-alloys are all indirect bandgap semiconductors that cannot emit light efficiently. Accordingly, achieving efficient light emission from group-IV materials has been a holy grail in silicon technology for decades and, despite tremendous efforts, it has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate efficient light emission from direct bandgap hexagonal Ge and SiGe alloys. We measure a subnanosecond, temperature-insensitive radiative recombination lifetime and observe a similar emission yield to direct bandgap III-V semiconductors. Moreover, we demonstrate how by controlling the composition of the hexagonal SiGe alloy, the emission wavelength can be continuously tuned in a broad range, while preserving a direct bandgap. Our experimental findings are shown to be in excellent quantitative agreement with the ab initio theory. Hexagonal SiGe embodies an ideal material system to fully unite electronic and optoelectronic functionalities on a single chip, opening the way towards novel device concepts and information processing technologies."
https://openalex.org/W3015299597,"Atmospheric carbon dioxide enrichment (eCO2) can enhance plant carbon uptake and growth1–5, thereby providing an important negative feedback to climate change by slowing the rate of increase of the atmospheric CO2 concentration6. Although evidence gathered from young aggrading forests has generally indicated a strong CO2 fertilization effect on biomass growth3–5, it is unclear whether mature forests respond to eCO2 in a similar way. In mature trees and forest stands7–10, photosynthetic uptake has been found to increase under eCO2 without any apparent accompanying growth response, leaving the fate of additional carbon fixed under eCO2 unclear4,5,7–11. Here using data from the first ecosystem-scale Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) experiment in a mature forest, we constructed a comprehensive ecosystem carbon budget to track the fate of carbon as the forest responded to four years of eCO2 exposure. We show that, although the eCO2 treatment of +150 parts per million (+38 per cent) above ambient levels induced a 12 per cent (+247 grams of carbon per square metre per year) increase in carbon uptake through gross primary production, this additional carbon uptake did not lead to increased carbon sequestration at the ecosystem level. Instead, the majority of the extra carbon was emitted back into the atmosphere via several respiratory fluxes, with increased soil respiration alone accounting for half of the total uptake surplus. Our results call into question the predominant thinking that the capacity of forests to act as carbon sinks will be generally enhanced under eCO2, and challenge the efficacy of climate mitigation strategies that rely on ubiquitous CO2 fertilization as a driver of increased carbon sinks in global forests. Carbon dioxide enrichment of a mature forest resulted in the emission of the excess carbon back into the atmosphere via enhanced ecosystem respiration, suggesting that mature forests may be limited in their capacity to mitigate climate change."

https://openalex.org/W3013448224,"Distributing entanglement over long distances using optical networks is an intriguing macroscopic quantum phenomenon with applications in quantum systems for advanced computing and secure communication1,2. Building quantum networks requires scalable quantum light–matter interfaces1 based on atoms3, ions4 or other optically addressable qubits. Solid-state emitters5, such as quantum dots and defects in diamond or silicon carbide6–10, have emerged as promising candidates for such interfaces. So far, it has not been possible to scale up these systems, motivating the development of alternative platforms. A central challenge is identifying emitters that exhibit coherent optical and spin transitions while coupled to photonic cavities that enhance the light–matter interaction and channel emission into optical fibres. Rare-earth ions in crystals are known to have highly coherent 4f–4f optical and spin transitions suited to quantum storage and transduction11–15, but only recently have single rare-earth ions been isolated16,17 and coupled to nanocavities18,19. The crucial next steps towards using single rare-earth ions for quantum networks are realizing long spin coherence and single-shot readout in photonic resonators. Here we demonstrate spin initialization, coherent optical and spin manipulation, and high-fidelity single-shot optical readout of the hyperfine spin state of single 171Yb3+ ions coupled to a nanophotonic cavity fabricated in an yttrium orthovanadate host crystal. These ions have optical and spin transitions that are first-order insensitive to magnetic field fluctuations, enabling optical linewidths of less than one megahertz and spin coherence times exceeding thirty milliseconds for cavity-coupled ions, even at temperatures greater than one kelvin. The cavity-enhanced optical emission rate facilitates efficient spin initialization and single-shot readout with conditional fidelity greater than 95 per cent. These results showcase a solid-state platform based on single coherent rare-earth ions for the future quantum internet. Single ytterbium ion qubits in nanophotonic cavities have long coherence times and can be optically read out in a single shot, establishing them as excellent candidates for optical quantum networks."
https://openalex.org/W3014853920,"The phylogenetic relationships between hominins of the Early Pleistocene epoch in Eurasia, such as Homo antecessor, and hominins that appear later in the fossil record during the Middle Pleistocene epoch, such as Homo sapiens, are highly debated1–5. For the oldest remains, the molecular study of these relationships is hindered by the degradation of ancient DNA. However, recent research has demonstrated that the analysis of ancient proteins can address this challenge6–8. Here we present the dental enamel proteomes of H. antecessor from Atapuerca (Spain)9,10 and Homo erectus from Dmanisi (Georgia)1, two key fossil assemblages that have a central role in models of Pleistocene hominin morphology, dispersal and divergence. We provide evidence that H. antecessor is a close sister lineage to subsequent Middle and Late Pleistocene hominins, including modern humans, Neanderthals and Denisovans. This placement implies that the modern-like face of H. antecessor—that is, similar to that of modern humans—may have a considerably deep ancestry in the genus Homo, and that the cranial morphology of Neanderthals represents a derived form. By recovering AMELY-specific peptide sequences, we also conclude that the H. antecessor molar fragment from Atapuerca that we analysed belonged to a male individual. Finally, these H. antecessor and H. erectus fossils preserve evidence of enamel proteome phosphorylation and proteolytic digestion that occurred in vivo during tooth formation. Our results provide important insights into the evolutionary relationships between H. antecessor and other hominin groups, and pave the way for future studies using enamel proteomes to investigate hominin biology across the existence of the genus Homo. Analyses of the proteomes of dental enamel from Homo antecessor and Homo erectus demonstrate that the Early Pleistocene H. antecessor is a close sister lineage of later Homo sapiens, Neanderthal and Denisovan populations in Eurasia."
https://openalex.org/W3013672482,"Environmental change is rapidly accelerating, and many species will need to adapt to survive1. Ensuring that protected areas cover populations across a broad range of environmental conditions could safeguard the processes that lead to such adaptations1-3. However, international conservation policies have largely neglected these considerations when setting targets for the expansion of protected areas4. Here we show that-of 19,937 vertebrate species globally5-8-the representation of environmental conditions across their habitats in protected areas (hereafter, niche representation) is inadequate for 4,836 (93.1%) amphibian, 8,653 (89.5%) bird and 4,608 (90.9%) terrestrial mammal species. Expanding existing protected areas to cover these gaps would encompass 33.8% of the total land surface-exceeding the current target of 17% that has been adopted by governments. Priority locations for expanding the system of protected areas to improve niche representation occur in global biodiversity hotspots9, including Colombia, Papua New Guinea, South Africa and southwest China, as well as across most of the major land masses of the Earth. Conversely, we also show that planning for the expansion of protected areas without explicitly considering environmental conditions would marginally reduce the land area required to 30.7%, but that this would lead to inadequate niche representation for 7,798 (39.1%) species. As the governments of the world prepare to renegotiate global conservation targets, policymakers have the opportunity to help to maintain the adaptive potential of species by considering niche representation within protected areas1,2."
https://openalex.org/W3014276226,"The ubiquity of tertiary alkylamines in pharmaceutical and agrochemical agents, natural products and small-molecule biological probes1,2 has stimulated efforts towards their streamlined synthesis3–9. Arguably the most robust method for the synthesis of tertiary alkylamines is carbonyl reductive amination3, which comprises two elementary steps: the condensation of a secondary alkylamine with an aliphatic aldehyde to form an all-alkyl-iminium ion, which is subsequently reduced by a hydride reagent. Direct strategies have been sought for a ‘higher order’ variant of this reaction via the coupling of an alkyl fragment with an alkyl-iminium ion that is generated in situ10–14. However, despite extensive efforts, the successful realization of a ‘carbonyl alkylative amination’ has not yet been achieved. Here we present a practical and general synthesis of tertiary alkylamines through the addition of alkyl radicals to all-alkyl-iminium ions. The process is facilitated by visible light and a silane reducing agent, which trigger a distinct radical initiation step to establish a chain process. This operationally straightforward, metal-free and modular transformation forms tertiary amines, without structural constraint, via the coupling of aldehydes and secondary amines with alkyl halides. The structural and functional diversity of these readily available precursors provides a versatile and flexible strategy for the streamlined synthesis of complex tertiary amines. The synthesis of tertiary amines is achieved through a carbonyl alkylative amination reaction facilitated by visible light, in which an aldehyde and an amine condense to form an iminium ion that subsequently reacts with alkyl radical."
https://openalex.org/W3014947914,"Tandem repeat elements such as the diverse class of satellite repeats occupy large parts of eukaryotic chromosomes, mostly at centromeric, pericentromeric, telomeric and subtelomeric regions1. However, some elements are located in euchromatic regions throughout the genome and have been hypothesized to regulate gene expression in cis by modulating local chromatin structure, or in trans via transcripts derived from the repeats2-4. Here we show that a satellite repeat in the mosquito Aedes aegypti promotes sequence-specific gene silencing via the expression of two PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). Whereas satellite repeats and piRNA sequences generally evolve extremely quickly5-7, this locus was conserved for approximately 200 million years, suggesting that it has a central function in mosquito biology. piRNA production commenced shortly after egg laying, and inactivation of the more abundant piRNA resulted in failure to degrade maternally deposited transcripts in the zygote and developmental arrest. Our results reveal a mechanism by which satellite repeats regulate global gene expression in trans via piRNA-mediated gene silencing that is essential for embryonic development."
https://openalex.org/W3015971262,"The recent emergence of bat-borne zoonotic viruses warrants vigilant surveillance in their natural hosts. Of particular concern is the family of coronaviruses, which includes the causative agents of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and most recently, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), an epidemic of acute respiratory illness originating from Wuhan, China in December 2019. Viral detection, discovery, and surveillance activities were undertaken in Myanmar to identify viruses in animals at high risk contact interfaces with people. Free-ranging bats were captured, and rectal and oral swabs and guano samples collected for coronaviral screening using broadly reactive consensus conventional polymerase chain reaction. Sequences from positives were compared to known coronaviruses. Three novel alphacoronaviruses, three novel betacoronaviruses, and one known alphacoronavirus previously identified in other southeast Asian countries were detected for the first time in bats in Myanmar. Ongoing land use change remains a prominent driver of zoonotic disease emergence in Myanmar, bringing humans into ever closer contact with wildlife, and justifying continued surveillance and vigilance at broad scales."
https://openalex.org/W3011378589,"The ID complex, involving the proteins FANCI and FANCD2, is required for the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICL) and related lesions1. These proteins are mutated in Fanconi anaemia, a disease in which patients are predisposed to cancer. The Fanconi anaemia pathway of ICL repair is activated when a replication fork stalls at an ICL2; this triggers monoubiquitination of the ID complex, in which one ubiquitin molecule is conjugated to each of FANCI and FANCD2. Monoubiquitination of ID is essential for ICL repair by excision, translesion synthesis and homologous recombination; however, its function remains unknown1,3. Here we report a cryo-electron microscopy structure of the monoubiquitinated human ID complex bound to DNA, and reveal that it forms a closed ring that encircles the DNA. By comparison with the structure of the non-ubiquitinated ID complex bound to ICL DNA-which we also report here-we show that monoubiquitination triggers a complete rearrangement of the open, trough-like ID structure through the ubiquitin of one protomer binding to the other protomer in a reciprocal fashion. These structures-together with biochemical data-indicate that the monoubiquitinated ID complex loses its preference for ICL and related branched DNA structures, and becomes a sliding DNA clamp that can coordinate the subsequent repair reactions. Our findings also reveal how monoubiquitination in general can induce an alternative protein structure with a new function."
https://openalex.org/W3014536903,"The rapid increase in anthropogenic activities, socioeconomic development, and land use land cover (LULC) changes since the opening of economic reforms (1978), have changed the ecosystem service value (ESV) in Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macao (GKHM) region located in South China. This leads to the requirement of a significant tailored analysis of ecosystem services regarding incisive and relevant planning to ensure sustainability at regional level. This study focuses on the use of Landsat satellite imagery to quantify the precise impact of LULC changes on the ecosystem services in GHKM over the past three decades (1986-2017). The most renowned established unit value transfer method has been employed to calculate the ESV. The results show that the total ecosystem service value in GHKM has decreased from 680.23 billion CNY in 1986 to 668.45 billion CNY in 2017, mainly due to the decrease in farmland and fishponds. This overall decrease concealed the more dynamic and complex nature of the individual ESV. The most significant decrease took place in the values of water supply (-22.20 billion CNY, -14.72%), waste treatment (-20.77 billion CNY, -14.63%), and food production (-7.96 billion CNY, -33.18%). On the other hand, the value of fertile soil formation and retention (6.28 billion CNY, +7.26%) and recreation and culture (5.09 billion CNY, +12.91%) increased. Furthermore, total ESV and ESV per capita decreased significantly with the continuous increase in total gross domestic product (GDP) and GDP per capita. A substantial negative correlation exists between farmland ESV and GDP indicating human encroachment into a natural and semi natural ecosystems. The results suggest that in the rapidly urbanizing region, the protection of farmland and to control the intrusion of urban areas has marked an important societal demand and a challenge to the local government. This required a pressing need for smart LULC planning and to improve policies and regulation to guarantee ecosystem service sustainability for acceptable life quality in the study area and other fast expanding urban areas in China."
https://openalex.org/W3014251436,"The neurotransmitter dopamine is required for the reinforcement of actions by rewarding stimuli1. Neuroscientists have tried to define the functions of dopamine in concise conceptual terms2, but the practical implications of dopamine release depend on its diverse brain-wide consequences. Although molecular and cellular effects of dopaminergic signalling have been extensively studied3, the effects of dopamine on larger-scale neural activity profiles are less well-understood. Here we combine dynamic dopamine-sensitive molecular imaging4 and functional magnetic resonance imaging to determine how striatal dopamine release shapes local and global responses to rewarding stimulation in rat brains. We find that dopamine consistently alters the duration, but not the magnitude, of stimulus responses across much of the striatum, via quantifiable postsynaptic effects that vary across subregions. Striatal dopamine release also potentiates a network of distal responses, which we delineate using neurochemically dependent functional connectivity analyses. Hot spots of dopaminergic drive notably include cortical regions that are associated with both limbic and motor function. Our results reveal distinct neuromodulatory actions of striatal dopamine that extend well beyond its sites of peak release, and that result in enhanced activation of remote neural populations necessary for the performance of motivated actions. Our findings also suggest brain-wide biomarkers of dopaminergic function and could provide a basis for the improved interpretation of neuroimaging results that are relevant to learning and addiction. Molecular and functional magnetic resonance imaging in the rat reveals distinct neuromodulatory effects of striatal dopamine that extend beyond peak release sites and activate remote neural populations necessary for performing motivated actions."
https://openalex.org/W3011967855,"In cells, organs and whole organisms, nutrient sensing is key to maintaining homeostasis and adapting to a fluctuating environment1. In many animals, nutrient sensors are found within the enteroendocrine cells of the digestive system; however, less is known about nutrient sensing in their cellular siblings, the absorptive enterocytes1. Here we use a genetic screen in Drosophila melanogaster to identify Hodor, an ionotropic receptor in enterocytes that sustains larval development, particularly in nutrient-scarce conditions. Experiments in Xenopus oocytes and flies indicate that Hodor is a pH-sensitive, zinc-gated chloride channel that mediates a previously unrecognized dietary preference for zinc. Hodor controls systemic growth from a subset of enterocytes-interstitial cells-by promoting food intake and insulin/IGF signalling. Although Hodor sustains gut luminal acidity and restrains microbial loads, its effect on systemic growth results from the modulation of Tor signalling and lysosomal homeostasis within interstitial cells. Hodor-like genes are insect-specific, and may represent targets for the control of disease vectors. Indeed, CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing revealed that the single hodor orthologue in Anopheles gambiae is an essential gene. Our findings highlight the need to consider the instructive contributions of metals-and, more generally, micronutrients-to energy homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W3011186035,"Inactivation is the process by which ion channels terminate ion flux through their pores while the opening stimulus is still present1. In neurons, inactivation of both sodium and potassium channels is crucial for the generation of action potentials and regulation of firing frequency1,2. A cytoplasmic domain of either the channel or an accessory subunit is thought to plug the open pore to inactivate the channel via a 'ball-and-chain' mechanism3-7. Here we use cryo-electron microscopy to identify the molecular gating mechanism in calcium-activated potassium channels by obtaining structures of the MthK channel from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum-a purely calcium-gated and inactivating channel-in a lipid environment. In the absence of Ca2+, we obtained a single structure in a closed state, which was shown by atomistic simulations to be highly flexible in lipid bilayers at ambient temperature, with large rocking motions of the gating ring and bending of pore-lining helices. In Ca2+-bound conditions, we obtained several structures, including multiple open-inactivated conformations, further indication of a highly dynamic protein. These different channel conformations are distinguished by rocking of the gating rings with respect to the transmembrane region, indicating symmetry breakage across the channel. Furthermore, in all conformations displaying open channel pores, the N terminus of one subunit of the channel tetramer sticks into the pore and plugs it, with free energy simulations showing that this is a strong interaction. Deletion of this N terminus leads to functionally non-inactivating channels and structures of open states without a pore plug, indicating that this previously unresolved N-terminal peptide is responsible for a ball-and-chain inactivation mechanism."

Less is known about diabetic health literacy in Ethiopian diabetic patients which can affect patient medication adherence, self-care, and glycemic control.This study was aimed to assess the diabetic health literacy level and its association with glycemic control among adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus attending the outpatient clinic of University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital (UOGCSH): Northwest Ethiopia.A cross-sectional study was employed at the outpatient clinic of the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital from May, 1 -May 30, 2019. The comprehensive 15-items diabetic health literacy questions with a 5-point Likert scale used to measure diabetic health literacy. The mean score calculated and switched to the percentage (5 points as 100%) to determine the level of diabetic health literacy. Morisky Green Levine Scale 4 item adherence assessment tool was used to assess the diabetic patient's level of adherence. Binary and multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between sociodemographic, clinical variables, diabetic-related literacy, and glycemic control. Independent samples t-test and One-way ANOVA test was employed to compare the mean literacy score difference in different groups.400 respondents were included in the study. Of all the respondents, 17.3%, 26.3%, and 56.5% had low, medium and high diabetic-related health literacy, respectively. The proportions of patients with low, medium and high adherence to medication were 9.8%, 56.3%, and 34% respectively. Patients with high diabetes literacy are 1.85 times more likely to achieve target glycemic control than lower diabetic literacy patients with 95% CI Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR). 1.85(1.09-3.40). While patients with good adherence 1.61 times more likely to achieve target glycemic control than patients with low adherence; 95% CI AOR 1.61(1.04-4.79). Diabetic patients with morbidity have 67% less likelihood to achieve the target glycemic control; 95% CI AOR 0.33(0.15-0.73).Adequate diabetic health literacy and better glycemic control are highly correlated.

Avocado fruit damage caused by the thrips species Scirtothrips perseae leads to economic losses of 12–51% in many countries. In this study, a screening of bacteria associated with the rhizosphere or endophytic phyllosphere of avocado roots was performed to identify bacterial isolates with plant growth-promoting activity in vitro assays with Arabidopsis seedlings and to assess the biocontrol activity of the isolates against Scirtothrips perseae. The isolates with beneficial, pathogenic and/or neutral effects on Arabidopsis seedlings were identified. The plant growth-promoting bacteria were clustered in two different groups (G1 and G3B) based on their effects on root architecture and auxin responses, particularly bacteria of the Pseudomonas genus (MRf4-2, MRf4-4 and TRf2-7) and one Serratia sp. (TS3-6). Twenty strains were selected based on their plant growth promotion characteristics to evaluate their potential as thrips biocontrol agents. Analyzing the biocontrol activity of S. perseae, it was identified that Chryseobacterium sp. shows an entomopathogenic effect on avocado thrips survival. Through the metabolic profiling of compounds produced by bacteria with plant growth promotion activity, bioactive cyclodipeptides (CDPs) that could be responsible for the plant growth-promoting activity in Arabidopsis were identified in Pseudomonas, Serratia and Stenotrophomonas.

https://openalex.org/W3014894058,"Consumption of either monosodium glutamate (MSG) or high-fat and high-fructose (HFF) diets changes the gut microbiome and hence contributes to development of several diseases. In this study, with an emphasis on kidney injury, hamsters were divided into 4 groups as follows: (1) hamsters fed with standard diet (control); (2) hamsters fed with standard diet and MSG in drinking water (MSG); (3) hamsters fed with high-fat and high-fructose diets (HFF), and (4) animals fed MSG+HFF. After 8 months, the animals were used for the study. Despite showing normal kidney function, hamsters fed with MSG+HFF exhibited signs of kidney damage as demonstrated by the highest expression levels of high-mobility group box-1 and kidney injury molecule-1 in kidney tissues, while slight changes of histopathological features in H&E-stained sections and normal levels of creatinine were observed, indicating possible early stages of kidney injury. Sequencing of the microbial 16S rRNA gene revealed that animals fed with the MSG+HFF diet had a higher ratio of gut Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes along with marked changes in abundance and diversity of gut microbiome compared to hamsters fed with MSG or HFF alone. In addition, 1H Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed an elevation of urine p-cresol sulfate levels in the MSG+HFF group. These results indicate that consumption of both MSG and HFF increases the risk of kidney injury, induces gut dysbiosis and an increase in the amount of p-cresol sulfate in hamsters."

Acute kidney disease (AKD) is a term used to describe the continuum from AKI to chronic kidney disease. However, the role of AKD in predicting the prognosis of patients on ECMO support is unclear. Methods A total of 168 patients who received ECMO support and survived for more than 7 days at a single hospital from 2003 to 2008 were enrolled for this study and followed up for 10 years or till mortality. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards model were used to determine the prognostic factors associated with survival. Results The median survival times of patients with stage 0, stage 1, stage 2 and stage 3 AKD were ≥ 10 years, 43.9 months, 1 month, and half a month, respectively. There were statistically significant differences in cumulative survival rate between patients with stage 3 AKD and those with stage 0, 1, and 2 AKD (Cox-Mantel log rank test, p<0.001, p<0.001, p = 0.023), and between patients with stage 0 AKD and those with stage 1 and 2 AKD (Cox-Mantel log rank test, p = 0.012, p<0.001). Cox regression analysis revealed that AKD stage (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.576, 95% confidential interval [CI]: 1.268–5.234, p = 0.009 for stage 1; HR: 2.349; 95% CI: 1.101–5.512, p = 0.029 for stage 2; HR: 5.252; 95% CI: 2.715–10.163, p<0.001 for stage 3) was significant independent predictor of survival. Conclusion AKD stage is an independent predictor of survival in patients on ECMO support."
https://openalex.org/W3014263337,"During a sea voyage, crew members of vessels are permanently exposed to physical stress caused by noise, vibration and heat. This study aims to describe the extent of the physical influences on board container ships and the resulting stress.Up to four scientific investigators accompanied six sea voyages on container ships under German management. Workplace and person-related measurements for noise, vibration and climatic parameters were carried out on the vessels during the three different voyage episodes (port stay, river passage and sea passage).The interviewed seafarers reported, in decreasing order, the level of psychological stress due to vibration (80.6%), noise (71.8%) and, much less, heat (45.7%) in the workplace. In terms of workplace-related physical measurements, the highest noise levels were found in the engine room (104 dB (A)), in the workshop (81 dB (A)) and on deck (77 dB (A)), irrespective of the voyage episode. Some noise measurements in the recreational area revealed levels above the threshold. All measured 180 vibration values were below the relevant threshold limits-with the highest values in the engine room (62 mm/s2), followed by the workshop (37 mm/s2) and the engine control room (34 mm/s2). In terms of thermal comfort, none of the measured climatic parameters differed significantly between the voyage episodes. According to the person-related physical measurements, the noise exposure was particularly pronounced among the engine room personnel with an average noise level of 96 dB (A) (often during cleaning, painting and repair work). In contrast, the deck crew and nautical officers were respectively exposed to an average level of 83 dB (A) and 77 dB (A) at work.A relevant stress level due to physical loads was detectable in the present study. As ship crews are exposed to the physical influences on board for 7 days a week over several months, further research is recommended to assess the long-term health effects for seafarers."

Little is known about the utilization of broad-scale individual-level youth physical fitness testing to explore health disparities. We examined longitudinal trends in population-level fitness for 4th-12th grade New York City youth during 2006/7-2016/17 (average n = 510,293 per year). Analyses were performed in 2019. The primary outcome was whether or not youth achieved sex-/age-specific performance levels (called the Healthy Fitness Zone) on the aerobic capacity, muscular strength and muscular endurance tests using the NYC FITNESSGRAM. The Cooper Institute's most recent Healthy Fitness Zone criteria were applied to all tests and years. Prevalence estimates were weighted, accounted for school clustering, adjusted for student-level sociodemographics, and run by sociodemographic subgroups and year. The overall prevalence for meeting 3 Healthy Fitness Zones increased from 15.5% (95%CI: 13.9%-17.0%) in 2006/7 to 23.3% (95%CI: 22.2%-24.4%) in 2016/17 for students in grades 4-12. Fitness for all student groups increased over time, although Hispanic and non-Hispanic black girls consistently had the lowest prevalence of meeting 3 Healthy Fitness Zones as compared to all other race/sex subgroups. Also, 9th-12th graders had a lower prevalence of meeting 3 Healthy Fitness Zones as compared to 4th-8th graders. Given forecasted sharp increases in cardiovascular disease prevalence, routine youth fitness surveillance using standardized, criterion referenced methods can identify important fitness disparities and inform interventions."

https://openalex.org/W3014261301,"The telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene is responsible for telomere maintenance in germline and stem cells, and is re-expressed in 90% of human cancers. CpG methylation in the TERT promoter (TERTp) was correlated with TERT mRNA expression. Furthermore, two hotspot mutations in TERTp, dubbed C228T and C250T, have been revealed to facilitate binding of transcription factor ETS/TCF and subsequent TERT expression. This study aimed to elucidate the combined contribution of epigenetic (promoter methylation and chromatin accessibility) and genetic (promoter mutations) mechanisms in regulating TERT gene expression in healthy skin samples and in melanoma cell lines (n = 61). We unexpectedly observed that the methylation of TERTp was as high in a subset of healthy skin cells, mainly keratinocytes, as in cutaneous melanoma cell lines. In spite of the high promoter methylation fraction in wild-type (WT) samples, TERT mRNA was only expressed in the melanoma cell lines with either high methylation or intermediate methylation in combination with TERT mutations. TERTp methylation was positively correlated with chromatin accessibility and TERT mRNA expression in 8 melanoma cell lines. Cooperation between epigenetic and genetic mechanisms were best observed in heterozygous mutant cell lines as chromosome accessibility preferentially concerned the mutant allele. Combined, these results suggest a complex model in which TERT expression requires either a widely open chromatin state in TERTp-WT samples due to high methylation throughout the promoter or a combination of moderate methylation fraction/chromatin accessibility in the presence of the C228T or C250T mutations."
https://openalex.org/W3015295268,"Economic, environmental, and social effects are the most dominating issues in cold chain logistics. The goal of this paper is to propose a cost-saving, energy-saving, and emission-reducing bi-objective model for the cold chain-based low-carbon location-routing problem. In the proposed model, the first objective (economic and environmental effects) is to minimize the total logistics costs consisting of costs of depots to open, renting vehicles, fuel consumption, and carbon emission, and the second one (social effect) is to reduce the damage of cargos, which could improve the client satisfaction. In the proposed model, a strategy is developed to meet the requirements of clients as to the demands on the types of cargos, that is, general cargos, refrigerated cargos, and frozen cargos. Since the proposed problem is NP-hard, we proposed a simple and efficient framework combining seven well-known multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). Furthermore, in the experiments, we first examined the effectiveness of the proposed framework by assessing the performance of seven MOEAs, and also verified the efficiency of the proposed model. Extensive experiments were carried out to investigate the effects of the proposed strategy and variants on depot capacity, hard time windows, and fleet composition on the performance indicators of Pareto fronts and cold chain logistics networks, such as fuel consumption, carbon emission, travel distance, travel time, and the total waiting time of vehicles."
https://openalex.org/W3016163127,"Environmental and anthropogenic factors are known to drive fish community structure in aquatic systems across the world. This study investigates fish assemblages in lower order streams across contrasting landscapes in central and eastern India. We documented the species diversity of these monsoon driven lower order streams in the two regions. We also investigated the potential common environmental drivers of richness and diversity and effect of season in these tropical streams. The study was based on seasonal data on abundance of fishes and environmental parameters collected between 2015-2017 from streams in states of Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal. Species diversity were compared across regions and seasons, based on their richness (SR) as well as diversity (Shannon index H'). Drivers of overall richness and diversity were analyzed using multiple linear regression methods, based on best subset selection. Analysis of data revealed high diversity in these streams in both regions. Cyprinidae, Bagridae and Channidae were the most dominant families in both regions. Despite the geographical and local ecological differences across the regions, common environmental parameters were found to influence richness and diversity across the two regions, indicating these as being key drivers of fish community structure. Water flow was a common factor driving both richness and diversity across both regions. Our study revealed a lack of seasonal effect in structuring fish communities in tropical streams. With stream and river ecosystems facing increasing threats due to habitat alterations and water quality degradation in countries such as India, a clear understanding of regional and local drivers of community structure of aquatic fauna is crucial. These results on the role of common environmental factors across ecoregions provides baseline information for understanding their ecological roles and developing management plans for important river basins and fish conservation in future."
https://openalex.org/W3014229799,"The increasing interest in Virtual Reality (VR) as a tool for neuroscientific research contrasts with the current lack of established toolboxes and standards. In several recent studies, game engines like Unity or Unreal Engine were used. It remains to be tested whether these software packages provide sufficiently precise and accurate stimulus timing and time measurements that allow inferring ongoing mental and neural processes. We here investigated the precision and accuracy of the timing mechanisms of Unreal Engine 4 and SteamVR in combination with the HTC Vive VR system. In a first experiment, objective external measures revealed that stimulus durations were highly accurate. In contrast, in a second experiment, the assessment of the precision of built-in timing procedures revealed highly variable reaction time measurements and inaccurate determination of stimulus onsets. Hence, we developed a new software-based method that allows precise and accurate reaction time measurements with Unreal Engine and SteamVR. Instead of using the standard timing procedures implemented within Unreal Engine, time acquisition was outsourced to a background application. Timing benchmarks revealed that the newly developed method allows reaction time measurements with a precision and accuracy in the millisecond range. Overall, the present results indicate that the HTC Vive together with Unreal Engine and SteamVR can achieve high levels of precision and accuracy both concerning stimulus duration and critical time measurements. The latter can be achieved using a newly developed routine that allows not only accurate reaction time measures but also provides precise timing parameters that can be used in combination with time-sensitive functional measures such as electroencephalography (EEG) or transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)."

Perinatal depression and anxiety are linked to adverse outcomes concerning pregnancy, maternal functioning, and healthy child development.Using the 2014 Health Center Patient Survey (HCPS), the objectives of the cross-sectional study are to assess the prevalence of self-reported mental health conditions among female patients of reproductive age and to examine the association between depression and physical health. Physical health conditions of interest included self-rated health, obesity, hypertension, smoking, and diabetes, which all have established associations with potential pregnancy complications and fetal health. The study found 40.8% of patients reported depression; 28.8% reported generalized anxiety; and 15.2% met the criteria for serious psychological distress on the Kessler 6 scale. Furthermore, patients with depression had two to three times higher odds of experiencing co-occurring physical health conditions.This study expands the discourse on maternal mental health, throughout the preconception, post-partum, and inter-conception care periods to improve understanding of the inter-correlated physical and mental health issues that could impact pregnancy outcomes and life course trajectory. From 2014 to 2018, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) has supported investments of nearly $750 million to improve and expand access to mental health and substance use disorder services for prevention, treatment, health education and awareness through comprehensive primary care integration. Moving forward, HRSA will implement strategic training and technical assistance (T/TA) framework that is designed to accelerate the adoption of science driven solutions in primary care in addressing depression for patients with co-occurring chronic conditions and advancing positive maternal outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3015367270,"The telomerase ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP) is essential for genome stability and performs this role through the addition of repetitive DNA to the ends of chromosomes. The telomerase enzyme is composed of a reverse transcriptase (TERT), which utilizes a template domain in an RNA subunit (TER) to reiteratively add telomeric DNA at the ends of chromosomes. Multiple TERs have been identified in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Here we combine a phylogenetic and biochemical approach to understand how the telomerase RNP has evolved in Brassicaceae, the family that includes A. thaliana. Because of the complex phylogenetic pattern of template domain loss and alteration at the previously characterized A. thaliana TER loci, TER1 and TER2, across the plant family Brassicaceae, we bred double mutants from plants with a template deletion at AtTER1 and T-DNA insertion at AtTER2. These double mutants exhibited no telomere length deficiency, a definitive indication that neither of these loci encode a functional telomerase RNA. Moreover, we determined that the telomerase components TERT, Dyskerin, and the KU heterodimer are under strong purifying selection, consistent with the idea that the TER with which they interact is also conserved. To test this hypothesis further, we analyzed the substrate specificity of telomerase from species across Brassicaceae and determined that telomerase from close relatives bind and extend substrates in a similar manner, supporting the idea that TERs in different species are highly similar to one another and are likely encoded from an orthologous locus. Lastly, TERT proteins from across Brassicaceae were able to complement loss of function tert mutants in vivo, indicating TERTs from other species have the ability to recognize the native TER of A. thaliana. Finally, we immunoprecipitated the telomerase complex and identified associated RNAs via RNA-seq. Using our evolutionary data we constrained our analyses to conserved RNAs within Brassicaceae that contained a template domain. These analyses revealed a highly expressed locus whose disruption by a T-DNA resulted in a telomeric phenotype similar to the loss of other telomerase core proteins, indicating that the RNA has an important function in telomere maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W3014571331,"Bats are among the most widespread mammals on Earth, and are subject to habitat change, loss, and other disturbances such as fire. Wildfire causes rapid changes in vegetation that affect habitat use. However, the spatial scale at which these changes affect bats depends on their use of habitat elements. Three years post wildfire, we assessed how burn severity, water, landform type, elevation, vegetation type, and roads affected use by bats of a forest landscape at multiple spatial scales. We deployed acoustic detectors at randomly selected locations within a 217,712 ha wildfire boundary in Arizona. We classified echolocation calls to species or group and calculated an activity index by adjusting the calls per hour. We conducted a multi-scale analysis of landscape structure and composition around each location from a 90 to 5760 m radius. No scale was selected preferentially by any species or group. Stream density and elevation range were more important predictors for species groups than burn severity. When burn severity was a predictor, agile species had higher activity in areas that were unburned or had low severity burn. A heterogeneous landscape composed of high, medium, and low burn severity patches within a forest altered by large wildfires provided habitat for different bat species, but water density and range in elevation were more important for predicting bat habitat use than fire severity in this arid landscape. More than one spatial scale, representing local to landscape levels, should be considered in managing habitat for bats. In arid areas, such as the western United States, maintaining reliable water sources is important for bats. Managing these factors at multiple spatial scales will benefit bat species with different wing morphologies, echolocation call types, and habitat selections."
https://openalex.org/W3015747070,"Serum pepsinogens have been widely acknowledged as gastric mucosal biomarkers; however, a multicountry report on the benefits of pepsinogens as biomarkers has not yet been published. We analyzed 1,206 sera and gastric mucosal samples collected from Bangladesh, Bhutan, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nepal and Thailand then assessed the association between gastric mucosal changes and Helicobacter pylori infection. The new cutoff values for serum pepsinogen values were evaluated using a receiver operating characteristic analysis. The participants with H. pylori infection had significantly lower pepsinogen I and higher pepsinogen II values, but a lower pepsinogen I/II ratio than participants without the infection (all P < .001). The pepsinogen I and pepsinogen I/II values were significantly higher and lower, respectively, in individuals with atrophic gastritis than in those without (both P < .001). Among uninfected individuals, only the pepsinogen I/II ratio was significantly lower in atrophic individuals. Pepsinogen I/II ratio also were significantly different between disease among H. pylori-positive and H. pylori-negative individuals, suggesting the pepsinogen I/II ratio is a robust biomarker for determining both chronic and atrophic gastritis. The cutoffs for detecting chronic and atrophic gastritis for the pepsinogen I/II ratio were 4.65 and 4.95, respectively. In conclusion, pepsinogen levels are useful biomarker for both chronic gastritis and atrophic gastritis, but they should be used with caution. Population-based validation is necessary to determine the best cutoff values. Among all pepsinogen values, the pepsinogen I/II ratio was the most reliable gastric mucosal-change biomarker."
https://openalex.org/W3014637528,"Objective of this study was to better understand the use of performance data for evidence-based decision-making by managers in hospitals and other healthcare organisations in Europe in 2019. In order to explore why, what and how performance data is collected, reported and used, we conducted a cross-sectional study based on a self-reported online questionnaire and a follow-up interactive workshop. Our study population were participants of a pan-European professional Exchange Programme and their hosts (n = 125), mostly mid-level hospital managers. We found that a substantial amount of performance data is collected and reported, but could be utilised better for decision-making purposes. Motivation to collect and report performance data is equally internal and external, for improvement as well as for accountability purposes. Benchmarking between organisations is recognised as being important but is still underused. A plethora of different data sources are used, but more should be done on conceptualising, collecting, reporting and using patient-reported data. Managers working for privately owned organisations reported greater use of performance data than those working for public ones. Strategic levels of management use performance data more for justifying their decisions, while managers on operational and clinical levels use it more for day-to-day decision-making. Our study showed that, despite the substantial and increasing use of performance data for evidence-based management, there is room and need to further explore and expand its role in strategic decision-making and supporting a shift in healthcare from organisational accountability towards the model of learning organisations."
https://openalex.org/W3014947566,"Purpose To investigate the association between different stages of posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) and macular microvasculature in the elderly. Methods Swept-source optical coherence tomography (OCT), OCT angiography, and color fundus images of 490 eyes without retinal pathologies of 322 participants aged ≥65 years were evaluated. PVD was classified using enhanced vitreous visualization mode as no apparent PVD (stage 0/1), vitreous adhesions at the fovea and optic disc (stage 2), adhesion at the optic disc (stage 3), or complete PVD (stage 4). Microvascular parameters, including foveal avascular zone (FAZ) and vessel density (VD), were analyzed for their associations with complete PVD. Additionally, the association between PVD and central retinal thickness (CRT) was also addressed. Results Overall, 80, 31, 31, and 349 eyes were categorized into stages 0/1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Using multivariate mixed-effects model, the mean superficial FAZ area was smaller in stage 4 compared with stages 0–3 (0.29 vs. 0.32 mm2; P = 0.014), and the mean superficial VD was lower in stage 4 compared with stages 0–3 (34.96% vs. 35.24%; P = 0.0089). However, PVD was not significantly associated with deep macular microvascular parameters or CRT. Conclusions Complete PVD was associated with smaller FAZ area and lower VD in superficial macular microvasculature, while it was not associated with central retinal thickness."
https://openalex.org/W3015294003,"To explore the shape characteristics of ablation lesions created via laser ablation (LA), radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA) in canine prostates and the clinical significance of these characteristics, six adult male beagles were randomly assigned to the LA, RFA, and MWA groups. These ablations were performed with common parameters applied in clinical practice (LA, 3 W/1200 J; RFA and MWA, 30 W/120 s). One ablation lesion was created in each lobe of the prostate via the ablation technique, resulting in a total of twelve ablation lesions. Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) was used as guidance during puncture and to monitor changes in the ablation lesions. Finally, the ablation efficacy was assessed using transrectal contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS), and the transverse diameter (TRD), anteroposterior diameter (APD) and longitudinal diameter (LD) of each ablation lesion were measured. The volume (V) and the ratio (R) value were calculated. R reflects the shape characteristic of the ablation lesion (the R value close to 1.0 indicates a more spherical shape). The R values of the ablation lesions were 0.89 ± 0.02, 0.72 ± 0.01, and 0.65 ± 0.03 for RFA, MWA and LA, respectively, and they were significantly different (P = 0.027). The volumes of the ablation lesions were 2.17 ± 0.10 ml, 1.51 ± 0.20 ml, and 0.79 ± 0.07 ml for MWA, LA and RFA, respectively, and they were also significantly different (P = 0.001). The three abovementioned thermal ablation techniques with common parameters in clinical practice can be used for ablation in the prostate. The shapes and volumes of the ablation lesions of the three techniques were varied: The RFA-created lesions had the lowest volumes and were more spherical in shape, demonstrating that RFA could be used for the treatment of relatively small lesions or tumours adjacent to vital organs. The MWA lesions had the largest size with a spherical shape, which could be advantageous for the ablation of tumours with relatively large sizes. The sizes of the ablation lesions created via LA were between those of RFA and MWA but presented more oval in shape, suggesting that this method is highly appropriate for the ablation of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)."
https://openalex.org/W3016077504,"Newly synthesized major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins are stabilized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by binding 8-10-mer-long self-peptide antigens that are provided by transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP). These MHC class I:peptide complexes then exit the ER and reach the plasma membrane, serving to sustain the steady-state MHC class I expression on the cell surface. A novel subset of MHC class I molecules that preferentially bind lipid-containing ligands rather than conventional peptides was recently identified. The primate classical MHC class I allomorphs, Mamu-B*098 and Mamu-B*05104, are capable of binding the N-myristoylated 5-mer (C14-Gly-Gly-Ala-Ile-Ser) or 4-mer (C14-Gly-Gly-Ala-Ile) lipopeptides derived from the N-myristoylated SIV Nef protein, respectively, and of activating lipopeptide antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. We herein demonstrate that Mamu-B*098 samples lysophosphatidylethanolamine and lysophosphatidylcholine containing up to a C20 fatty acid in the ER. The X-ray crystal structures of Mamu-B*098 and Mamu-B*05104 complexed with lysophospholipids at high resolution revealed that the B and D pockets in the antigen-binding grooves of these MHC class I molecules accommodate these lipids through a monoacylglycerol moiety. Consistent with the capacity to bind cellular lipid ligands, these two MHC class I molecules did not require TAP function for cell-surface expression. Collectively, these results indicate that peptide- and lipopeptide-presenting MHC class I subsets use distinct sources of endogenous ligands."

A total of 43,402 adults (men, 17,535; women, 25,867) with ALT ≤40 U/L without a history of hepatitis B and C, liver cirrhosis, or liver cancer were analyzed. The risk of MS was evaluated according to the ALT level. The prevalence of MS significantly increased as the ALT levels increased. The proportions of MS in men were 12.6%, 25.2%, and 39.7% in the ALT levels of <15, 15~30, and 30~40 U/L, respectively (p < 0.001), and those of women were 7.2%, 23.3%, and 44.7% in the ALT levels of <10, 10~20, and 20~40 U/L, respectively (p < 0.001). There was an ALT-dependent relationship in the risk of MS in participants with normal ALT level after adjustment for age, alcohol intake, and body mass index. The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of MS in men was 2.48 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.16-2.85) in an ALT level of 30~40 U/L compared with that in ALT <15 U/L (p < 0.001), and the aOR of MS in women was 2.67 (95% CI, 2.26-3.15) in an ALT level of 20~40 U/L compared with that in ALT <10 U/L (p < 0.001). Although within the normal range of ALT, the risk of MS increases as the ALT levels increase. The ALT level in the general population without a history of chronic liver disease may be a useful marker to evaluate for MS."

We describe the geographical distribution of WRLHIV, their pregnant counterparts and AGYW for risk-adjusted allocation of eMTCT interventions. Methods For the year 2018, we triangulated data from the Thembisa Model with five routine HIV-related and demographic data sources to determine the distribution of WRLHIV (15–49 years) and AGYW (15–24 years) nationally and by province. Data analysed included total population estimates, number of live-births, live-births to HIV-positive women, age-specific HIV prevalence rates, intrauterine (IU)-transmission rates and IU-case rates/100 000 live-births. IU-transmission rates and IU-case rates were calculated from de-duplicated routine HIV test-data for neonates (aged <7days). Data de-duplication was achieved by a patient-linking algorithm that uses probabilistic matching of demographics (name, surname, date of birth), supplemented by manual matching to account for spelling errors. Results There were 58 million people in South Africa in 2018. Females (all ages) constituted 51% of the population. Women of reproductive age constituted 27% and AGYW constituted 8% of the total population. WRLHIV, AGYW living with HIV and HIV-positive pregnant women accounted for 7%, 0.8% and 0.4% of the total population respectively. Gauteng was the most populous province followed by KwaZulu-Natal, with Western Cape and Eastern Cape in third and fourth positions. The distribution of WRLHIV and AGYW followed a similar trend. However, Mpumalanga and Limpopo provinces had higher proportions of WRLHIV and AGYW living with HIV ahead of Western Cape. KwaZulu-Natal had the highest number of live-births to HIV-positive women. The national IU-transmission rate of <1% translated into 241 cases/100 000. While provincial IU-case rates were fairly similar at 179–325, districts IU-case rates varied, ranging from 87–415 cases/100 000 live-births. Conclusion Findings suggest that the need for eMTCT interventions is greatest in Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, Western Cape and Eastern Cape. Limpopo and Mpumalanga provinces may require more HIV prevention and family planning services because of high fertility rates, high number of WRLHIV and AGYW living with HIV. eMTCT will require robust viral load monitoring among WRLHIV, pregnant and breastfeeding women. The national laboratory database can provide this service near-real time."
https://openalex.org/W3016145487,"Bats are primary consumers of nocturnal insects, disperse nutrients across landscapes, and are excellent bioindicators of an ecosystem’s health, however four of the seventeen Great British species are listed as declining. In this study we aim to investigate the link between bat guano morphology and diet, specifically looking at the ability to predict 1) species, 2) dietary guild, and 3) bat size, using guano morphology alone. Guano from 16 bat species sampled from across Great Britain were analysed to determine various morphological metrics. These data were coupled with diet data obtained by an extensive literature review. It was found that guano morphology overlapped too much to make predictions on the species of bat which deposited the guano, however, in some cases, it could be used to indicate the dietary guild to which the bat belonged. In general, guano morphology seems more correlated to diet than species. This enables the identification of the most important prey taxa within a local environment; a crucial step for informing conservation strategies."

Shell matrix proteins (SMPs) have important functions in shell formation. A 16.6 kDa whirlin-like protein (WLP) with a PDZ domain was identified in the shell of Mytilus coruscus as a novel SMP. In this study, the expression, function, and location of WLP were analysed. The WLP gene was highly expressed and specifically located in the adductor muscle and mantle. The expression of recombinant WLP (rWLP) was associated with morphological change, polymorphic change, binding ability, and crystallization rate inhibition of the calcium carbonate crystals in vitro. In addition, an anti-rWLP antibody was prepared, and the results from immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence analyses revealed the specific location of the WLP in the mantle, adductor muscle, and myostracum layer of the shell, suggesting multiple functions for WLP in biomineralization, muscle-shell attachment, and muscle attraction. Furthermore, results from a pull-down analysis revealed 10 protein partners of WLP in the shell matrices and a possible network of interacting WLPs in the shell. In addition, in this study, one of the WLP partners, actin, was confirmed to have the ability to bind WLP. These results expand the understanding of the functions of PDZ-domain-containing proteins in biomineralization and provide clues for determining the mechanisms of myostracum formation and muscle-shell attachment."
https://openalex.org/W3015015604,"Homocysteine has been known as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. This study sought to evaluate the influence of homocysteine on the risk of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis in asymptomatic individuals.We reviewed 3,186 asymptomatic individuals (mean age 53.8 ± 8.0 years, 2,202 men [69.1%]) with no prior history of coronary artery disease who voluntarily underwent coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) and laboratory tests as part of a general health examination. The subjects were stratified into tertiles according to their homocysteine levels. The degree and extent of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis were assessed by CCTA. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the association between homocysteine levels and subclinical coronary atherosclerosis.The prevalence of significant coronary artery stenosis, any atherosclerotic, calcified, mixed, and non-calcified plaques increased with homocysteine tertiles (all p < 0.05). However, after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, there were no statistically significant differences in the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for any atherosclerotic plaque (OR 1.06; 95% CI [confidence interval] 0.85-1.32; p = 0.610), calcified plaques (OR 1.17; 95% CI 0.92-1.48; p = 0.199), non-calcified plaques (OR 0.80; 95% CI 0.61-1.04; p = 0.089), and mixed plaques (OR 1.42; 95% CI 0.96-2.11; p = 0.077) between the third and first homocysteine tertiles. In addition, the adjusted OR for significant coronary artery stenosis (OR 0.92; 95% CI 0.63-1.36; p = 0.687) did not differ between the first and third tertiles.In asymptomatic individuals, homocysteine is not associated with an increased risk of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W3015966603,"Although the connection between the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) and the left superior temporal gyrus (LSTG) has been found to be essential for the comprehension of relative clause (RC) sentences, it remains unclear how the LIFG and the LSTG interact with each other, especially during the processing of Chinese RC sentences with different processing difficulty. This study thus conducted a 2 × 2 (modifying position × extraction position) factorial analyses to examine how these two factors influences regional brain activation. The results showed that, regardless of the modifying position, greater activation in the LIFG was consistently elicited in Chinese subject-extracted relative clauses (SRCs) with non-canonical word order than object-extracted relative clauses (ORCs) with canonical word order, implying that the LIFG subserving the ordering process primarily contributes to the processing of information with increased integration demands due to the non-canonical sequence. Moreover, the directional connection between the LIFG and the LSTG appeared to be modulated by different modifying positions. When the RC was at the subject-modifying position, the effective connectivity from the LIFG to the LSTG was dominantly activated for sentence comprehension; whereas when the RC was at the object-modifying position thus being more difficult, it might be the feedback mechanism from the LSTG back to the LIFG that took place in sentence processing. These findings reveal that brain activation in between the LIFG and the LSTG may be dynamically modulated by different processing difficulty and suggest the relative specialization but extensive collaboration involved in the LIFG and the LSTG for sentence comprehension."
https://openalex.org/W3016185930,"The inability of beef cattle to maintain full term pregnancies has become an economic concern for the beef industry. Herd management and nutritional improvements have alleviated environmental impacts on embryonic and fetal loss, yet additional gains can be made through genomic selection. The objectives of this study were to identify loci and gene-sets in crossbred beef heifers associated with the number of services required to become pregnant (TBRD) and heifer conception rate at first service (HCR1). Heifers (n = 709) from a commercial beef operation underwent one round of artificial insemination, before exposure to bulls for natural service for 50 days. Pregnancy and time of conception was determined by ultrasound 35 days after the breeding season. Heifers were genotyped using the GeneSeek (Lincoln, NE) Bovine GGP50K BeadChip prior to genome-wide association analyses (GWAA) conducted using an EIGENSTRAT-like model to identify loci associated (P < 1 × 10-5) with TBRD and HCR1. One locus was associated (P = 8.97 × 10-6) with TBRD on BTA19 and included the positional candidate gene ASIC2, which is differentially expressed in the endometrium of fertility classified heifers, and the positional candidate gene, SPACA3. Gene-set enrichment analyses using SNP (GSEA-SNP) data, was performed and identified one gene-set, oxidoreductase activity, acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen as enriched (NES = 3.15) with TBRD and contained nine leading edge genes that contributed to the enrichment of the gene set. The enriched gene-set is involved in catalyzing oxidation-reduction reactions, which have been associated with oxidative stressors impacting pregnancy success. No loci were associated nor gene-sets enriched with HCR1. Identification of loci, positional candidate genes, gene-sets and leading edge genes enriched for fertility facilitate genomic selection that allows producers to select for reproductively superior cattle, reduce costs associated with infertility, and increase percent calf crop."
https://openalex.org/W3015098195,"Background Human height is a simple measure with great applicability. Usually, stadiometers are used to measure height accurately. However, these may be impractical to transport and expensive. Therefore, we developed a portable and low-cost laser height metre (LHM). Objective We aimed to (1) determine intrarater and interrater reliability of our LHM and compare it to a wall-fixed stadiometer, (2) examine its agreement with the same stadiometer, and (3) determine the minimum number of recordings needed to obtain an accurate and reliable height measurement using the LHM. Methods We recruited 32 participants (18+ years)–both men and women. Two raters performed assessments on the same day blinded to each other and their reference standard measurements. We calculated intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), coefficient of variation (CV), standard error of measurement (SEM), and Bland-Altman plots with limits of agreement (LOA). Results For both the LHM and stadiometer, we found ICC values of 0.99–1.00 (95% CI: 0.997–1.000) for both intrarater and interrater reliability. Regarding LHM intrarater reliability, SEM, CV, and LOA were 0.34 cm, 0.16%, and -1.07 to 0.73 cm, respectively. In terms of LHM interrater reliability, SEM, CV, and LOA were 0.27 cm, 0.12%, and -0.32 to 0.84 cm, respectively. As to agreement with stadiometers using one measurement, the mean difference was -0.14 cm and LOA ranged from -0.81 to 0.77 cm. Conclusion A portable and low-cost LHM, for measuring body height once, showed an excellent reproducibility within and between raters along with an acceptable agreement with a stadiometer thereby representing a suitable alternative."
