https://openalex.org/W2092580449,"Grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) are part of an environment-independent spatial coordinate system. To determine how information about location, direction, and distance is integrated in the grid-cell network, we recorded from each principal cell layer of MEC in rats that explored two-dimensional environments. Whereas layer II was predominated by grid cells, grid cells colocalized with head-direction cells and conjunctive grid × head-direction cells in the deeper layers. All cell types were modulated by running speed. The conjunction of positional, directional, and translational information in a single MEC cell type may enable grid coordinates to be updated during self-motion–based navigation."
https://openalex.org/W2131256997,"Fat tissue is the most important energy depot in vertebrates. The release of free fatty acids (FFAs) from stored fat requires the enzymatic activity of lipases. We showed that genetic inactivation of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) in mice increases adipose mass and leads to triacylglycerol deposition in multiple tissues. ATGL-deficient mice accumulated large amounts of lipid in the heart, causing cardiac dysfunction and premature death. Defective cold adaptation indicated that the enzyme provides FFAs to fuel thermogenesis. The reduced availability of ATGL-derived FFAs leads to increased glucose use, increased glucose tolerance, and increased insulin sensitivity. These results indicate that ATGL is rate limiting in the catabolism of cellular fat depots and plays an important role in energy homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1980087716,"Forest trees display a perennial growth behavior characterized by a multiple-year delay in flowering and, in temperate regions, an annual cycling between growth and dormancy. We show here that the CO/FT regulatory module, which controls flowering time in response to variations in daylength in annual plants, controls flowering in aspen trees. Unexpectedly, however, it also controls the short-day-induced growth cessation and bud set occurring in the fall. This regulatory mechanism can explain the ecogenetic variation in a highly adaptive trait: the critical daylength for growth cessation displayed by aspen trees sampled across a latitudinal gradient spanning northern Europe."
https://openalex.org/W2039450143,"We report a catalytic system that produces olefin block copolymers with alternating semicrystalline and amorphous segments, achieved by varying the ratio of α-olefin to ethylene in the two types of blocks. The system uses a chain shuttling agent to transfer growing chains between two distinct catalysts with different monomer selectivities in a single polymerization reactor. The block copolymers simultaneously have high melting temperatures and low glass transition temperatures, and therefore they maintain excellent elastomeric properties at high temperatures. Furthermore, the materials are effectively produced in economically favorable, continuous polymerization processes."
https://openalex.org/W1967139887,"B cells recognize foreign antigens by virtue of cell surface immunoglobulin receptors and are most effectively activated by membrane-bound ligands. Here, we show that in the early stages of this process, B cells exhibit a two-phase response in which they first spread over the antigen-bearing membrane and then contract, thereby collecting bound antigen into a central aggregate. The extent of this response, which is both signaling- and actin-dependent, determines the quantity of antigen accumulated and hence the degree of B cell activation. Brownian dynamic simulations reproduce essential features of the antigen collection process and suggest a possible basis for affinity discrimination. We propose that dynamic spreading is an important step of the immune response."
https://openalex.org/W1912107272,"EmrD is a multidrug transporter from the Major Facilitator Superfamily that expels amphipathic compounds across the inner membrane of Escherichia coli . Here, we report the x-ray structure of EmrD determined to a resolution of 3.5 angstroms. The structure reveals an interior that is composed mostly of hydrophobic residues, which is consistent with its role transporting amphipathic molecules. Two long loops extend into the inner leaflet side of the cell membrane. This region can serve to recognize and bind substrate directly from the lipid bilayer. We propose that multisubstrate specificity, binding, and transport are facilitated by these loop regions and the internal cavity."
https://openalex.org/W2062656075,"The global spread of wireless networks brings a great opportunity for their use in environmental studies. Weather, atmospheric conditions, and constituents cause propagation impairments on radio links. As such, while providing communication facilities, existing wireless communication systems can be used as a widely distributed, high-resolution atmospheric observation network, operating in real time with minimum supervision and without additional cost. Here we demonstrate how measurements of the received signal level, which are made in a cellular network, provide reliable measurements for surface rainfall. We compare the estimated rainfall intensity with radar and rain gauge measurements."
https://openalex.org/W2145486493,The most recent Cassini RADAR images of Titan show widespread regions (up to 1500 kilometers by 200 kilometers) of near-parallel radar-dark linear features that appear to be seas of longitudinal dunes similar to those seen in the Namib desert on Earth. The Ku-band (2.17-centimeter wavelength) images show â¼100-meter ridges consistent with duneforms and reveal flow interactions with underlying hills. The distribution and orientation of the dunes support a model of fluctuating surface winds of â¼0.5 meter per second resulting from the combination of an eastward flow with a variable tidal wind. The existence of dunes also requires geological processes that create sand-sized (100- to 300-micrometer) particulates and a lack of persistent equatorial surface liquids to act as sand traps.
https://openalex.org/W1979417376,"Organic matter in extraterrestrial materials has isotopic anomalies in hydrogen and nitrogen that suggest an origin in the presolar molecular cloud or perhaps in the protoplanetary disk. Interplanetary dust particles are generally regarded as the most primitive solar system matter available, in part because until recently they exhibited the most extreme isotope anomalies. However, we show that hydrogen and nitrogen isotopic compositions in carbonaceous chondrite organic matter reach and even exceed those found in interplanetary dust particles. Hence, both meteorites (originating from the asteroid belt) and interplanetary dust particles (possibly from comets) preserve primitive organics that were a component of the original building blocks of the solar system."
https://openalex.org/W2080911376,"Riboswitches are untranslated regions of messenger RNA, which adopt alternate structures depending on the binding of specific metabolites. Such conformational switching regulates the expression of proteins involved in the biosynthesis of riboswitch substrates. Here, we present the 2.9 angstrom-resolution crystal structure of the eukaryotic Arabidopsis thaliana thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP)-specific riboswitch in complex with its natural ligand. The riboswitch specifically recognizes the TPP via conserved residues located within two highly distorted parallel ""sensor"" helices. The structure provides the basis for understanding the reorganization of the riboswitch fold upon TPP binding and explains the mechanism of resistance to the antibiotic pyrithiamine."
https://openalex.org/W1968732273,"The embryonic vertebrate heart begins pumping blood long before the development of discernable chambers and valves. At these early stages, the heart tube has been described as a peristaltic pump. Recent advances in confocal laser scanning microscopy and four-dimensional visualization have warranted another look at early cardiac structure and function. We examined the movement of cells in the embryonic zebrafish heart tube and the flow of blood through the heart and obtained results that contradict peristalsis as a pumping mechanism in the embryonic heart. We propose a more likely explanation of early cardiac dynamics in which the pumping action results from suction due to elastic wave propagation in the heart tube."
https://openalex.org/W2098853912,"Leukocyte trafficking to the central nervous system (CNS), regulated in part by chemokines, determines severity of the demyelinating diseases multiple sclerosis (MS) and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). To examine chemokine receptor CX3CR1 in EAE, we studied CX3CR1(GFP/GFP) mice, in which CX3CR1 targeting by insertion of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) allowed tracking of CX3CR1+ cells in CX3CR1(+/GFP) animals and cells destined to express CX3CR1 in CX3CR1(GFP/GFP) knockouts. NK cells were markedly reduced in the inflamed CNS of CX3CR1-deficient mice with EAE, whereas recruitment of T cells, NKT cells and monocyte/macrophages to the CNS during EAE did not require CX3CR1. Impaired recruitment of NK cells in CX3CR1(GFP/GFP) mice was associated with increased EAE-related mortality, nonremitting spastic paraplegia and hemorrhagic inflammatory lesions. The absence of CD1d did not affect the severity of EAE in CX3CR1(GFP/GFP) mice, arguing against a role for NKT cells. Accumulation of NK cells in livers of wild-type (WT) and CX3CR1(GFP/GFP) mice with cytomegalovirus hepatitis was equivalent, indicating that CX3CL1 mediated chemoattraction of NK cells was relatively specific for the CNS. These results are the first to define a chemokine that governs NK cell migration to the CNS, and the findings suggest novel therapeutic manipulation of CX3CR1+ NK cells."
https://openalex.org/W2118231872,"Given the choice of waiting for an adverse outcome or getting it over with quickly, many people choose the latter. Theoretical models of decision-making have assumed that this occurs because there is a cost to waiting—i.e., dread. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we measured the neural responses to waiting for a cutaneous electric shock. Some individuals dreaded the outcome so much that, when given a choice, they preferred to receive more voltage rather than wait. Even when no decision was required, these extreme dreaders were distinguishable from those who dreaded mildly by the rate of increase of neural activity in the posterior elements of the cortical pain matrix. This suggests that dread derives, in part, from the attention devoted to the expected physical response and not simply from fear or anxiety. Although these differences were observed during a passive waiting procedure, they correlated with individual behavior in a subsequent choice paradigm, providing evidence for a neurobiological link between the experienced disutility of dread and subsequent decisions about unpleasant outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2129332527,"Greater than 99% of the Norwalk virus (NV) capsid consists of 180 copies of a single 58-kDa protein. Recombinantly expressed monomers self-assemble into virus-like particles (VLPs) with a well defined icosahedral structure. NV-VLPs are an appropriate vaccine antigen since the antigenic determinants of the parent virion are preserved. They also constitute very simple models to study the mechanisms of assembly and disassembly of viral capsids. This work examines the inherent stability of NV-VLPs over a range of pH and temperature values and provides detailed insight into structural perturbations that accompany disassembly. The NV-VLP structure was monitored using a variety of biophysical techniques including intrinsic and extrinsic fluorescence, high resolution second-derivative UV absorption spectroscopy, circular dichroism (CD), dynamic light scattering, differential scanning calorimetry, and direct observation employing transmission electron microscopy. The data demonstrate that NV-VLPs are highly stable over a pH range of 3-7 and up to 55 °C. At pH 8, however, reversible capsid dissociation was correlated with increased solvent exposure of tyrosine residues and subtle changes in secondary structure. Above 60 °C NV-VLPs undergo distinct phase transitions arising from secondary-, tertiary-, and quaternary-level protein structural perturbations. By combining the spectroscopic data employing a multidimensional eigenvector phase space approach, an empirical phase diagram for NV-VLP was constructed. This strategy of visualization provides a comprehensive description of the physical stability of NV-VLP over a broad range of pH and temperature. Complementary, differential scanning calorimetric analyses suggest that the two domains of VP1 unfold independently in a pH-dependent manner.

Norwalk virus (NV) 2The abbreviations used are: NV, Norwalk virus; VLP, virus-like particle; ANS, 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonate; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; DLS, dynamic light scattering; EPD, empirical phase diagram; TEM, transmission electron microscopy. 2The abbreviations used are: NV, Norwalk virus; VLP, virus-like particle; ANS, 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonate; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; DLS, dynamic light scattering; EPD, empirical phase diagram; TEM, transmission electron microscopy. and Norwalk-like viruses are responsible for more than 95% of acute nonbacterial gastroenteritis with 23 million reported cases per year in the United States alone (1Fankhauser R.L. Monroe S.S. Noel J.S. Humphrey C.D. Bresee J.S. Parashar U.D. Ando T. Glass R.I. J. Infect. Dis. 2002; 186: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). These viruses are members of the family Caliciviridae and the recently designated genus Norovirus, which comprises genogroups I and II. They are highly contagious, requiring low numbers of viruses for infection and appear to be stable outside the host for several days. Transmission of NV occurs primarily via the fecal-oral route with several outbreaks of waterborne and food-borne gastroenteritis documented on cruise ships, in schools, nursing homes, residential institutions, and areas devastated by natural disasters (1Fankhauser R.L. Monroe S.S. Noel J.S. Humphrey C.D. Bresee J.S. Parashar U.D. Ando T. Glass R.I. J. Infect. Dis. 2002; 186: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 2Greenberg H.B. Valdesuso J. Yolken R.H. Gangarosa E. Gary W. Wyatt R.G. Konno T. Suzuki H. Chanock R.M. Kapikian A.Z. J. Infect. Dis. 1979; 139: 564-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). NV outbreaks have also been documented in the United States military population and in different areas of the world where crowded living conditions facilitated person to person spread (3Hyams K.C. Malone J.D. Kapikian A.Z. Estes M.K. Xi J. Bourgeois A.L. Paparello S. Hawkins R.E. Green K.Y. J. Infect. Dis. 1993; 167: 986-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 4McCarthy M. Estes M.K. Hyams K.C. J. Infect. Dis. 2000; 181: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). NV and other members of the Caliciviridae family have recently been designated as category B biodefense pathogens (National Institutes of Health Publication 03-5315). The gastroenteritis associated with NV has an average incubation period of 12-48 h, with symptoms characterized by acute onset of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Although the illness is frequently self-limiting and mild, the consequent severe dehydration can be fatal in susceptible populations (e.g. elderly, immune-suppressed patients) due to secondary complications (5Lopman B.A. Adak G.K. Reacher M.H. Brown D.W. Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2003; 9: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The genome of NV consists of a single-stranded, positive sense RNA of about 7.6 kilobases that is organized into three open reading frames. These open reading frames encode a nonstructural polyprotein, the major capsid protein (VP1), and the minor basic capsid protein (VP2) (6Jiang X. Wang M. Wang K. Estes M.K. Virology. 1993; 195: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). The study of NV pathology and immunology has been hindered by the lack of growth supporting cell culture systems. Recombinant expression of the VP1 in an insect cell system, however, results in the self-assembly of empty, noninfectious virus-like particles (NV-VLPs) that are morphologically similar to the infective virion (7Jiang X. Wang M. Graham D.Y. Estes M.K. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6527-6532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Elucidation of the structural and immunological features of NV has been accomplished primarily through studies of these NV-VLPs. The three-dimensional structure of the NV-VLP has been resolved through the use of electron cryomicroscopy and computer analysis techniques (8Prasad B.V. Rothnagel R. Jiang X. Estes M.K. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5117-5125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and x-ray crystallography (9Prasad B.V. Hardy M.E. Dokland T. Bella J. Rossmann M.G. Estes M.K. Science. 1999; 286: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). These studies reveal that NV-VLPs have a diameter of ∼38 nm and exhibit a T = 3 icosahedral symmetry. They are composed almost entirely of 180 molecules of the VP1 capsid protein organized into 90 dimers with a few copies (<1%) of VP2 per intact VLP. The NV-VLP has a continuous protein shell with prominent protrusions at all the local and strict icosahedral 2-fold axes, leaving cup-like depressions at the icosahedral 5- and 3-fold axes. VP1 consists of two principal domains; a shell (S) and a protruding (P) domain, linked together by a flexible hinge region (9Prasad B.V. Hardy M.E. Dokland T. Bella J. Rossmann M.G. Estes M.K. Science. 1999; 286: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). The N-terminal 225 residue S domain is involved in formation of the icosahedral contacts between VP1 dimers. Residues 50-225 fold into an 8-stranded antiparallel β sandwich arrangement, which is a commonly observed structure of other viral capsids. The C-terminal P domain is further divided into two subdomains, P1 and P2. Both subdomains are rich in β-strand structures that are involved in coordinating dimer formation, with an extensive interfacial contact area of about 2000 Å2 (9Prasad B.V. Hardy M.E. Dokland T. Bella J. Rossmann M.G. Estes M.K. Science. 1999; 286: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). At present only a few studies have been initiated to examine the environmental stability of NV. In experiments involving human volunteers, NV retained infectivity, producing gastroenteritis even after exposure to pH 2.7 for 3 h and after heating to 60 °C for 30 min (10Pirtle E.C. Beran G.W. Rev. Sci. Tech. 1991; 10: 733-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Another study that used feline calicivirus as an NV surrogate (11Doultree J.C. Druce J.D. Birch C.J. Bowden D.S. Marshall J.A. J. Hosp. Infect. 1999; 41: 51-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) showed that the particles were stable at room temperature for between 21 and 28 days and up to 60 days at 4 °C when dried onto a surface. Infectious virus titers were found even after exposure of feline calicivirus to 70 °C temperatures for up to 3 min. Because much of the current knowledge of Norwalk virus has been gained from studies of NV-VLPs, a comprehensive biophysical analysis of their stability with respect to temperature- and pH-induced structural changes is of significant value for several reasons. A better understanding of the life cycle of the virus, especially assembly/disassembly mechanisms, could contribute to the design of drugs and inactivation strategies aimed to disrupt the viral capsid. In addition, because the NV-VLP has been proposed as a promising vaccine candidate to combat NV infection (12Tacket C.O. Vaccine. 2005; 23: 1866-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 13Tacket C.O. Sztein M.B. Losonsky G.A. Wasserman S.S. Estes M.K. Clin. Immunol. 2003; 108: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), such studies might provide a basis for rational vaccine development and formulation conditions. Last, NV-VLPs constitute an attractive and simple model to study assembly, stability, and unfolding of icosahedral viral capsids. In this work we have examined the effects of pH and temperature on intact NV-VLPs using a combination of several spectroscopic methods as well as calorimetric and microscopic analyses. Synthesis of the spectroscopic data, employing a multidimensional eigenvector phase space approach (14Kueltzo L.A. Ersoy B. Ralston J.P. Middaugh C.R. J. Pharm. Sci. 2003; 92: 1805-1820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), provides a comprehensive description of the physical stability of the NV-VLP. Complementary, calorimetric analysis revealed that the two different domains of VP1 unfold independently in a pH-dependent manner. Norwalk Virus-like Particles Preparation—Recombinant Norwalk virus capsid monomers were expressed in a baculovirus-transformed Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) ovarian cell line as described previously (7Jiang X. Wang M. Graham D.Y. Estes M.K. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6527-6532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NV-VLPs were purified from the insect cell medium 5-7 days post-infection using four steps of centrifugation as described previously with later modifications (7Jiang X. Wang M. Graham D.Y. Estes M.K. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6527-6532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hardy M.E. White L.J. Ball J.M. Estes M.K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1693-1698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Sf9 cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min at room temperature. NV-VLPs were concentrated from the resulting supernatant fraction by ultracentrifugation for 2 h in a Beckman SW28 rotor at 26,000 rpm (89,450 × g) at 4 °C. The NV-VLP pellet was then resuspended in sterile water and sedimented through CsCl (0.39 g/ml) using a Beckman SW55 Ti rotor at 35,000 rpm (116,000 × g) for 18 h at 4 °C. The band containing the NV-VLPs was collected and diluted in sterile water, and the NV-VLPs were pelleted by centrifugation again for 2 h in a Beckman SW28 rotor at 26,000 rpm (89,450 × g) at 4 °C. The samples were decanted, and the pellet was resuspended in sterile water and stored at 4 °C until further use. Purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Purified NV-VLPs were dialyzed against 20 mm citrate/phosphate buffer at the desired pH (3Hyams K.C. Malone J.D. Kapikian A.Z. Estes M.K. Xi J. Bourgeois A.L. Paparello S. Hawkins R.E. Green K.Y. J.

Protein concentrations (monomer based) were determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm corrected for any light scattering contribution of the NV-VLPs (16Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Biotechniques. 1993; 15: 240-242PubMed Google Scholar) employing an extinction coefficient, ϵ280 nm, of 0.852 ml mg-1 cm-1 (17Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Lewis R.V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Far UV Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Far UV CD spectra were collected using a Jasco 810 spectropolarimeter equipped with a Peltier temperature controller (Jasco Inc., Easton, MD) and a six-position cuvette holder. NV-VLP solutions were prepared at a protein concentration of 0.22 mg/ml and placed in 0.1-cm path length stoppered quartz cuvettes. Spectra were acquired using a resolution of 0.5 nm and a scanning speed of 20 nm/min with a response time of 2 s and a bandwidth of 1 nm. Sample temperature was monitored by a thermocouple located in the cuvette holder block. Spectra presented are an average of three consecutive measurements. Secondary structure content was estimated using the Dichroweb software package (18Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W668-W673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1953) Google Scholar), which permits the analysis of secondary structure by CONTIN (19Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar), SELCON (20Provencher S.W. Glockner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar), and CDSSTR (21Johnson W.C. Proteins. 1999; 35: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar) algorithms. The thermal unfolding of NV-VLPs was followed by monitoring the ellipticity at 205 and 222 nm over the temperature range of 10-90 °C, with a resolution of 0.5 °C, at a heating rate of 15 °C/h. CD signals were converted to mean residue molar ellipticities [θ]R, and the thermal transitions were analyzed using the Jasco Spectral Manager™ and derivative analyses employing Microcal Origin™ 7.0 software. UV Absorption Spectroscopy—High resolution absorbance spectra were collected on a Hewlett Packard 8453 UV-visible diode-array spectrophotometer (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA) equipped with a Peltier temperature controller. A protein concentration of 0.055 mg/ml was used. Spectra were analyzed between 200 and 400 nm in 1.0-nm increments over a temperature range of 10-90 °C at 2.5 °C increments. A 5-min temperature equilibration time was also incorporated before collection of each spectrum. Second derivative spectra were generated using a 9 data-point filter that was then fit to a cubic spline function with 99 interpolated points per raw data point, which permitted an effective 0.01-nm resolution. Spectral analyses were conducted as previously reported (14Kueltzo L.A. Ersoy B. Ralston J.P. Middaugh C.R. J. Pharm. Sci. 2003; 92: 1805-1820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) using Microcal Origin™ 7.0 software. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Intrinsic fluorescence emission spectra of NV-VLPs were obtained in 2.5 °C increments from 10-90 °C employing a QuantaMaster™ spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International, Inc., Birmingham, NJ) equipped with a four-position cell holder and Peltier temperature control device. A 5-min equilibration time was again used at each temperature before data acquisition. The intrinsic fluorescence spectra were collected at a protein concentration of 0.055 mg/ml by exciting samples at 280 nm, whereas the emission was monitored between 305 and 450 nm using excitation and emission slit widths of 4 nm. Spectra were smoothed using the software included with the instrument, and the wavelength of emission maximum (λmax) for each spectrum was determined by derivative analysis using Microcal Origin™ 7.0. To further investigate the stability of the NV-VLPs, samples (0.055 mg/ml protein) in the presence of 40 μm 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonate (ANS) were excited at 385 nm, and the emission spectrum of the dye was recorded from 400 to 580 nm as a function of temperature. Excitation and emission slits were set at 4 nm, and a 5-min hold time was used at each temperature before data collection. Emission spectra of 40 μm ANS in buffer alone were subtracted from sample spectra at each temperature. Values are presented as the mean with accompanying standard errors (n = 3). Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS)—The size of NV-VLPs as a function of temperature and pH was monitored by dynamic light scattering. Stock solutions of NV-VLPs were diluted to 0.75 mg/ml in 20 mm citrate-phosphate buffer at the appropriate pH and filtered through 0.45-μm filters. Measurements were recorded every 2.5 °C from 10 to 90 °C at 15 °C/h in a light scattering instrument (Brookhaven Instrument Corp., Holtzille, NY) equipped with a 50-milliwatt diode-pumped laser (λ = 532 nm). The scattered light was monitored at 90° to the incident beam, and the autocorrelation function was generated via a digital generator (BI-9000AT). The effective hydrodynamic diameter was calculated from the diffusion coefficient by the Stokes-Einstein equation using the method of cumulants (22Brown J.C. Pusey P.N. Dietz R. J. Chem. Phys. 1975; 62: 1136-1144Crossref Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In some experiments the data were fit to a curve using a non-negative constrained least squares algorithm to yield multimodal distributions. Data were collected over five 30-s intervals for each sample and plotted as the mean hydrodynamic diameter with accompanying standard error (n = 5). Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)—A JEOL JEM-1200EXII (JEOL-USA, Inc., Peabody, MA) transmission electron microscope was used to examine the morphology of NV-VLPs under different combinations of pH and temperature. Purified NV-VLPs suspended at 0.35 mg/ml where dialyzed overnight against the appropriate buffer (20 mm citrate/phosphate buffer, pH 3-8). NV-VLP samples were placed on a length of Parafilm™ for staining. Carbon-coated Formvar membranes were layered with the filmed side contacting the NV-VLP samples for 2 min. The grids were then washed by placing them onto two separate drops of nanopure water for 10 s each and stained for 45 s with 1% ammonium molybdate. The pH of the staining solution was previously adjusted to the pH of the individual samples. Excess stain was removed with the edge of a filter paper, and the grids were allowed to air dry. For the temperature studies, the NV-VLP samples at pH 7 were incubated in a water bath at 25 °C, and the temperature was increased to 90 °C at the same heating rate used for the DLS experiments (15 °C/h). Ten-microliter samples were taken at different temperatures and stained at room temperature. The NV-VLP sizes were measured from digital electron micrographs using UTHSCSA ImageTool software version 3.0. Empirical Phase Diagram (EPD)—The EPD was generated using data points at 2.5 °C intervals from 10-90 °C. The data used to construct the EPD were all 6-s derivative UV peaks, CD signals at 222 nm, intrinsic fluorescence peak position maxima, intrinsic fluorescence intensity at 330 nm, and ANS fluorescence intensity at 485 nm. The data generated from the various biophysical techniques were initially ordered by the parameter measured (i.e. pH and temperature) in Microsoft Excel® and copied into MatLab® Version 4.2 (Wolfram Research, Inc., Champaign, IL) for phase diagram preparation. The discrete parameters are analogous to coordinates that are associated with a set of variables from each technique employed. These variables represent unit vectors that define an n-dimensional vector space with dimensions equal to the number of variables included in the data set. Individual unit vector projectors were calculated and summed to obtain a density matrix. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the density matrix were calculated, and the three most influential components were each assigned a single color in an RGB-based (red, green, or blue) scheme. Finally, the three components were summed to yield a final color that represents a physical state of the capsids under those conditions (i.e. temperature and pH). A more detailed description of this method has been previously described (14Kueltzo L.A. Ersoy B. Ralston J.P. Middaugh C.R. J. Pharm. Sci. 2003; 92: 1805-1820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Note that the result is not an equilibrium (thermodynamic) phase diagram but merely a graphical representation of different structural states and that the final colors are arbitrary (the same color in different regions of the diagram may reflect different states since there are multiple ways of producing the same color through RGB additions). Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)—Calorimetric experiments were performed with a VP-DSC MicroCal high throughput capillary differential scanning calorimeter (Northampton, MA). DSC thermograms were obtained from 10 to 115 °C at a scan rate of 1 °C/min. A protein concentration of 0.5 to 0.75 mg/ml in 20 mm citrate/phosphate buffer at the appropriate pH was employed. A base-line correction was performed by subtracting the result of a sample versus buffer thermogram under identical conditions. After the first scan the samples were cooled and re-scanned to check the reversibility of any unfolding process. Melting temperatures (Tm) were calculated using MicroCal Origin 7.0 (Origin-Lab Corp., Northampton, MA) software assuming a non-two-state unfolding model. Trypsin Digests—Trypsin from bovine pancreas tissue covalently attached to agarose beads (Sigma) was used to obtain the C-terminal fragment of VP1, which contains the entire P domain. Digestion was performed by incubating 1 mg of capsids with 2 IU of trypsin for 8 h at 37 °C in a digestion buffer (pH 8.5) containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 400 μm Na2HPO4, 400 μm KH2PO4, 220 mm glucose, and 180 mm NaHCO3. After incubation, the enzyme was removed by low speed centrifugation, and the supernatant containing digested capsid was dialyzed against 20 mm citrate/phosphate buffer at the appropriate pH. After dialysis, the protein concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm employing an extinction coefficient ϵ of 1.092 ml mg-1 cm-1 (17Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Lewis R.V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The purity of the C-terminal fragment was found to be greater than 95% as analyzed by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (using 12% gels) and Coomassie Blue staining (not shown). Secondary Structure Analysis of NV-VLPs—Circular dichroism (CD) was used to investigate the stability of the secondary structure of NV-VLPs in buffers of different pH values when subjected to thermal gradients from 10 to 90 °C. The spectrum from native NV-VLPs at 10 °C and pH 7.0 showed a minimum near 205 nm, a shoulder at 220 nm, and some weak positive maxima around 190 and 233 nm (Fig. 1). These spectral features, which somewhat resemble those of unfolded proteins, have been assigned to a group of β sheet-rich proteins containing short segments of β-strands (classified as β-II proteins) (23Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 384-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The secondary structure analysis using the program CDSSTR (21Johnson W.C. Proteins. 1999; 35: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar) revealed a high percentage of β-sheet (36-37%), which is in good agreement with the crystallographic data available for VP1 (9Prasad B.V. Hardy M.E. Dokland T. Bella J. Rossmann M.G. Estes M.K. Science. 1999; 286: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Because the data obtained at each pH value were similar, significant alterations of the secondary structure of the protein did not appear to be induced by changes in pH alone. At pH 8, however, there was a small decrease in α-helix (from 11 to 8%) and a corresponding increase in disordered structure from 32 to 34%. The CD spectrum observed at pH 8 also differed from that seen at other pH values with a shift in the minima from 205 to 202 nm, concomitant with a decrease in the overall intensity of the CD signal (Fig. 1). Temperature-induced changes in the secondary structure of the NV-VLP were also monitored at 222 nm (Fig. 2A). At pH 7, a sigmoidal increase in the ellipticity was observed as the temperature was increased, with a transition midpoint at ∼63 °C. A separate experiment (not shown) revealed that the thermally induced changes were irreversible. At pH 4-6, the increase in the ellipticity at 222 nm was followed by a sharp transition characterized by a significant decrease in the CD signal. This last event was found to be due to extensive aggregation, making estimation of the transition midpoint unreliable. Further efforts to avoid capsid aggregation by the addition of up to 2 m guanidinium chloride were unsuccessful. At pH 8, the NV-VLPs displayed two well defined transitions at around 45 and 58 °C. The NV-VLPs also displayed two transitions at pH 3 near 65 and 80 °C, although the second transition was not well resolved (Fig. 2). Similar transition temperatures were observed for all pH experiments when the CD signal was monitored at 205 nm (not shown). To further characterize the conformational changes occurring in NV-VLP secondary structure upon heating, the far UV spectra were recorded as a function of temperature and deconvoluted using CDSSTR. As the temperature was increased at pH 7, a shoulder began to appear around 220 nm, and the spectrum became broader (Fig. 2B). Analysis of the secondary structure distribution indicated a decrease in the β-sheet structure concomitant with a moderate increase in β-turn and α-helix (Fig. 2C). NV-VLPs at pH 3 and 8 displayed similar results (not shown). Solute interference, however, hampered data collection below 200 nm and, thus, prevented spectra deconvolutions at pH 4-6.FIGURE 2The effects of temperature on the secondary structure of NV-VLPs at different pH values. A, mean residue molar ellipticity at 222 nm as a function of temperature over a range of pH 3-8 (n = 3). The CD spectra at pH 7.0 were collected at the indicated temperatures (B), and the distribution of secondary structure was estimated by the program CDSSTR (C). The spectra presented are an average of three consecutive scans.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Analysis of pH- and Temperature-induced Changes in the Tertiary Structure of NV-VLPs—Temperature- and pH-induced changes in the tertiary structure of the VP1 protein were evaluated by UV-second derivative absorption and intrinsic and extrinsic fluorescence spectroscopies. VP1 possesses a substantial number of aromatic residues: 27 Phe, 11 Tyr, and 6 Trp. Changes in the microenvironment of these residues induces changes in their spectral characteristics, thus providing a means to monitor tertiary structure stability. A number of these residues coordinate interactions between the quasi-equivalent subunits, which form the icosahedral capsid (9Prasad B.V. Hardy M.E. Dokland T. Bella J. Rossmann M.G. Estes M.K. Science. 1999; 286: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Thus, UV and fluorescence spectroscopies might also provide information pertaining to the disassembly of the quaternary icosahedral structure. The second derivative spectra of the NV-VLPs at 10 °C and pH 7.0 showed six negative peaks with the following assignments: Phe (∼253 and 259 nm), Tyr (∼269 and 279 nm), and an overlapping of Tyr/Trp signal (285 nm) and Trp (292 nm) (Fig. 3A). In general, exposure of aromatic amino acid side chains to a more polar environment causes a blue shift in the absorbance minimum, whereas shifts to longer wavelengths suggest that the residues are on average incorporated"

Here we demonstrate that high density lipoprotein (HDL) is a key serum factor that attenuates neutralization by monoclonal and HCV patient-derived polyclonal antibodies of infectious pseudo-particles (HCVpp) harboring authentic E1E2 glycoproteins and cell culture-grown genuine HCV (HCVcc). Over 10-fold higher antibody concentrations are required to neutralize either HCV-enveloped particles in the presence of HDL or human serum, and less than 3–5-fold reduction of infectious titers are obtained at saturating antibody concentrations, in contrast to complete inhibition in serum-free conditions. We show that HDL interaction with the scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI), a proposed cell entry co-factor of HCV and a receptor mediating lipid transfer with HDL, strongly reduces neutralization of HCVpp and HCVcc. We found that HDL activation of target cells strongly stimulates cell entry of viral particles by accelerating their endocytosis, thereby suppressing a 1-h time lag during which cell-bound virions are not internalized and can be targeted by antibodies. Compounds that inhibit lipid transfer functions of SR-BI fully restore neutralization by antibodies in human serum. We demonstrate that this functional HDL/SR-BI interaction only interferes with antibodies blocking HCV-E2 binding to CD81, a major HCV receptor, reflecting its prominent role during the cell entry process. Moreover, we identify monoclonal antibodies targeted to epitopes in the E1E2 complex that are not inhibited by HDL. Consistently, we show that antibodies targeted to HCV-E1 efficiently neutralize HCVpp and HCVcc in the presence of human serum.

Its genome encodes a precursor polyprotein of ∼3,000 amino acids (1Lindenbach B.D. Rice C.M. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 2001: 991-1042Google Scholar). Cleavage of this polyprotein generates 10 polypeptides, including a core protein, two surface glycoproteins, E1 and E2, and the nonstructural proteins. HCV is an enveloped virus, implying that specific cell surface molecules mediate the capture of viral particles and their penetration inside the infected cells. Several molecules have been proposed as cell entry receptors of HCV, and most of them have been isolated based on binding studies with soluble recombinant E2 protein or HCV-like particles. Potential receptors include the CD81 tetraspanin (2Pileri P. Uematsu Y. Campagnoli S. Galli G. Falugi F. Petracca R. Weiner A.J. Houghton M. Rosa D. Grandi G. Abrignani S.

Among infected individuals, only 20% recover from infection spontaneously, whereas most patients progress to chronic infection. The viral and host factors that determine HCV persistence or clearance at the acute stage of infection need to be understood in detail to improve antiviral therapy and to develop efficient vaccines. Studies focusing on innate and cellular immune responses have shown that HCV is able to evade or subvert the host defenses. Spontaneous HCV clearance is associated with a strong, early cellular immune response to multiple HCV epitopes, and both CD4+ and CD8+ responses are maintained for several years after viral clearance (12Bowen D.G. Walker C.M. Nature. 2005; 436: 946-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). The recent development of infection assays based on HCVpp and HCVcc provides new opportunities to study the humoral response. There is evidence that neutralizing antibodies could play a role in disease control. Such antibodies have been reported to emerge during the course of acute HCV infection both in patients (13Shimizu Y.K. Hijikata M. Iwamoto A. Alter H.J. Purcell R.H. Yoshikura H. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1494-1500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Shimizu Y.K. Igarashi H. Kiyohara T. Cabezon T. Farci P. Purcell R.H. Yoshikura H. Virology. 1996; 223: 409-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and in experimentally infected chimpanzees (15Farci P. Alter H.J. Wong D.C. Miller R.H. Govindarajan S. Engle R. Shapiro M. Purcell R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7792-7796Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Previous studies have indirectly suggested a role for neutralizing antibodies in the control of viral loads (16Ishii K. Rosa D. Watanabe Y. Katayama T. Harada H. Wyatt C. Kiyosawa K. Aizaki H. Matsuura Y. Houghton M. Abrignani S. Miyamura T. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1117-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 17Orland J.R. Wright T.L. Cooper S. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Using HCVpp infection assays, a recent study addressed the kinetics of humoral responses in a cohort of acute phase patients (18Lavillette D. Morice Y. Germanidis G. Donot P. Soulier A. Pagkalos E. Sakellariou G. Intrator L. Bartosch B. Pawlotsky J.-M. Cosset F.-L. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 6023-6034Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The emergence of a neutralizing response, of seemingly narrow specificity, was correlated with a decrease of high initial viremia, leading to control of viral replication. Of note, high titer, broadly cross-reacting antibodies that neutralize HCVpp are readily detected in chronically infected patients (7Bartosch B. Dubuisson J. Cosset F.L. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar, 19Bartosch B. Verney G. Dreux M. Donot P. Morice Y. Penin F. Pawlotsky J.-M. Lavillette D. Cosset F.-L. J.

The factors that mitigate the impact of the neutralizing antibody response need to be clarified. Several reports indicate that plasma-derived HCV particles complexed to β-lipoproteins are protected against anti-HCV or anti-E2 antibodies (25Hijikata M. Shimizu Y.K. Kato H. Iwamoto A. Shih J.W.

Hepat. 1996; 3: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a recent study suggested that the interplay of HCVpp with high density lipoprotein (HDL), but not LDL, leads to protection from neutralizing antibodies present in sera of both acute and chronic patients (19Bartosch B. Verney G. Dreux M. Donot P. Morice Y. Penin F. Pawlotsky J.-M. Lavillette D. Cosset F.-L. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 8217-8229Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Indeed, HCVpp were more effectively neutralized by purified monoclonal antibodies and immunoglobulins isolated from chronic patients, as compared with the same antibodies in the presence of HDL or human serum (19Bartosch B. Verney G. Dreux M. Donot P. Morice Y. Penin F. Pawlotsky J.-M. Lavillette D. Cosset F.-L. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 8217-8229Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Likewise, nonresolving acute phase patients develop low titer neutralizing antibodies that are unable to neutralize HCVpp in infection assays performed in the presence of human serum, as a result of the presence of HDL that completely abrogate their activity (18Lavillette D. Morice Y. Germanidis G. Donot P. Soulier A. Pagkalos E. Sakellariou G. Intrator L. Bartosch B. Pawlotsky J.-M. Cosset F.-L. J.

Virol. 2005; 79: 8217-8229Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Interestingly, deletion or mutation of HVR1, the hypervariable region-1 of the HCV-E2 glycoprotein that is under strong evolution pressure during disease outcome (29Farci P. Shimoda A. Coiana A. Diaz G. Peddis G. Melpolder J.C. Strazzera A. Chien D.Y. Munoz S.J. Balestrieri A. Purcell R.H. Alter H.J. Science. 2000; 288: 339-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar), strongly increased sensitivity of HCVpp to cross-neutralizing antibodies present in these sera (19Bartosch B. Verney G. Dreux M. Donot P. Morice Y. Penin F. Pawlotsky J.-M. Lavillette D. Cosset F.-L. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 8217-8229Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), assigning to HVR1 a critical role in modulation of antibody effectiveness. These different results suggest that antibody-escape mechanisms operate in vivo and contribute to the inefficiency of the host humoral response against HCV in patients who do not resolve the infection. Despite the high viral variability, it has been possible to isolate monoclonal antibodies derived from either chronic patients or immunized animals that neutralize HCVpp of diverse genotypes and subtypes (30Keck Z.Y.

By aiming to discover epitopes and/or antibodies as well as drugs that enhance the potency of neutralization in vivo, there is obvious interest to address the mechanisms that counteract HCV neutralization. By using HCVpp and HCVcc in this study, we unravel new features of the mechanism by which HDL induce protection against neutralizing antibodies. Expression Constructs and Production of HCVpp—Expression vectors for the E1E2 glycoproteins of HCV strain H77 (AF009606) and for the HVR1 deletion mutant (ΔG384-N411) were described previously (7Bartosch B.

Polyclonal antibodies against E1 (strain H77) were purified from mouse immune sera (kind gift of G. Verney), obtained by immunization with modified HCVpp harboring E1 glycoproteins only. 8C. Granier, G. Verney, and F. L. Cosset, unpublished data. Antibodies were purified using protein-G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). A pool of HCV immunoglobulins was purified and concentrated from over 30 chronic HCV sera of genotypes 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, and 3 as described previously (19Bartosch B. Verney G. Dreux M. Donot P. Morice Y. Penin F. Pawlotsky J.-M. Lavillette D. Cosset F.-L. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 8217-8229Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The recombinant CD81-LEL fragment (amino-acids 112–202) and a truncated soluble form of E2 glycoprotein (sE2) (amino-acids 384–664) were fused to a His tag, produced in mammalian cells and purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen). Binding Assays—Binding of HCVpp was performed as described previously for other types of pseudo-particles (42Lavillette D. Boson B. Russell S. Cosset F.-L. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3685-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μl of virus particles purified on a 20% sucrose cushion were incubated to 106 target cells in the presence of 0.1% sodium azide for 1 h. Human serum was added or not at the concentration of 2.5%. Cells were then washed twice with PBFA (PBS, 2% fetal bovine serum, and 0.1% sodium azide) and incubated with the H53 anti-HCV-E2 mAb (40 μg/ml) for 1 h at 4°C. After two washes, cells were incubated with a goat anti-mouse RPE (R0480; Dako A/S Denmark) diluted in PBFA (1:100) for 45 min at 4 °C. Fluorescence of living 10,000 cells was determined by FACS analysis. Binding of soluble E2 glycoprotein to CD81 was performed as described previously (39Flint M. Maidens C. Loomis-Price L.D. Shotton C. Dubuisson J. Monk P. Higginbottom A. Levy S. McKeating J.A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6235-6244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and was used to detect the “neutralization of binding” (NOB) activity of antibodies to CD81. Briefly, 5 μg/ml of sE2 harboring a His tag was mixed with 10 μg/ml of tested antibodies and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Molt-4 cells (105 cells) were then incubated to the mixture for 1 h at room temperature, and the amount of cell-bound sE2 was determined by FACS analysis using anti-His tag antibody (penta-His; Qiagen). Infection Assays—Huh-7 and Huh7-Lunet cells were seeded 24 h prior to inoculation (7Bartosch B. Dubuisson J. Cosset F.L. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar, 10Wakita T. Pietschmann T. Kato T. Date T. Miyamoto M. Zhao Z. Murthy K. Habermann A. Krausslich H.G. Mizokami M. Bartenschlager R. Liang T.J. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 791-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (2424) Google Scholar). 2 h before infection, target cells were preincubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% FCS. Medium was then removed, and dilutions of viral supernatants and various compounds were added to the cells as indicated. After 4 h, supernatants were removed, and the infected cells were kept in regular medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% FCS) for 72 h before analysis. For infection assays with HCVpp, the infectious titers were deduced from the percentage of GFP-positive cells, as determined by FACS analysis (7Bartosch B. Dubuisson J. Cosset F.L. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). Infections were controlled by pseudo-particles devoid of E1E2 glycoproteins, which resulted in background titers below 5 × 102 infectious units/ml. For analyses of HCVcc infectious titers, cells were lysed for luciferase assays, as described previously (10Wakita T. Pietschmann T. Kato T. Date T. Miyamoto M. Zhao Z. Murthy K. Habermann A. Krausslich H.G. Mizokami M. Bartenschlager R. Liang T.J. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 791-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (2424) Google Scholar). Surface Plasmon Resonance Binding Assays—Biomolecular interactions were studied using a BIAcore-3000 instrument (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden), which used surface plasmon resonance as a detection method. The AP33 antibody (100 μg/ml in 10 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.5) was covalently immobilized to the dextran matrix of a CM3 sensor chip (amine coupling kit, BIAcore AB) at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Activation and blocking steps were performed as described previously (43Ricard-Blum S. Bernocco S. Font B. Moali C. Eichenberger D. Farjanel J. Burchardt E.R. van der Rest M. Kessler E. Hulmes D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33864-33869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Purified HCVpp were injected over AP33 antibody in PBS containing 0.005% P20 surfactant (BIAcore AB) at a flow rate of 5 μl/min at 25 °C. HCVpp capture levels ranged between 200 and 500 resonance units. A control flow cell was prepared by immobilizing irrelevant antibody (mouse anti-IL2) according to the same procedure. Control sensorgrams representing nonspecific binding to the sensor chip surface were automatically subtracted from the sensorgrams obtained with captured HCVpp. Binding assays of HDL, A4 antibody, and CD81-LEL were performed at 25 °C in PBS with 0.005% P20 surfactant at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. The surface was then regenerated with pulse of 0.025% SDS. We reported previously that an interplay between HDL and HCV-E2 leads to infection enhancement of HCVpp (19Bartosch B. Verney G. Dreux M.

An example of neutralization curves deduced from the results of infection assays obtained with a monoclonal antibody (mAb), carried out in the presence or the absence of HDL or HS, is displayed in Fig. 1. These results allowed estimation of IC50 and IC90 values for this mAb (i.e. antibody concentrations that reduce HCVpp infectious titers by 2- and 10-fold, respectively) at 1.3 and 8 μg/ml, respectively, in the absence of HS or HDL. This compared with an IC50 of 6.6 μg/ml for neutralization assays performed in the presence of HS. The attenuation of neutralization was not affected by the mAb concentration, in the range of values tested, i.e. 0.1–50 μg/ml (data not shown). More importantly, no IC90 could be determined from neutralization assays performed in the presence of HS or HDL because the mAb could not neutralize more than 65% HCVpp under these conditions (Fig. 1), even at high antibody concentrations (19Bartosch B. Verney G. Dreux M. Donot P. Morice Y. Penin F. Pawlotsky J.-M. Lavillette D. Cosset F.-L. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 8217-8229Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Therefore, such a level of neutralization only reduced the infectious titers by less than 3-fold, which contrasted with the complete inhibition of HCVpp infectivity achieved in serum-free conditions for antibody concentrations of ∼50 μg/ml (19Bartosch B.

However, pathophysiological cardiac hypertrophy is accompanied by reactive fibrosis and remodeling. The Rho kinase family, consisting of ROCK1 and ROCK2, has been implicated in cardiac hypertrophy and ventricular remodeling. However, these previous studies relied heavily on pharmacological inhibitors,and not on gene deletion. Here we used ROCK1knockout (ROCK1-/-) mice to investigate role of ROCK1 in the development of ventricular remodeling induced by transverse aortic banding. We observed that ROCK1 deletion did not impair compensatory hypertrophic response induced by pressure overload. However, ROCK1-/- mice exhibited reduced perivascular and interstitial fibrosis, which was observed at 3 wk but not at 1 wk after the banding. The reduced fibrosis in the myocardium of ROCK1-/- mice was closely associated with reduced expression of a variety of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and fibrogenic cytokines such as TGFbeta2 and connective tissue growth factor. This inhibitory effect of ROCK1 deletion on pathophysiological induction of fibrogenic cytokines was further confirmed in the myocardium of transgenic mice with cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of Gq. Thus, these results indicate that ROCK1 contributes to the development of cardiac fibrosis and induction of fibrogenic cytokines in cardiomyocytes in response to pathological stimuli."

Interaction of the SRP receptor with both SRP and the ribosome rearranged the S domain of SRP such that a ribosomal binding site for the translocon, the L23e/L35 site, became exposed, whereas Alu domain–mediated elongation arrest persisted."
https://openalex.org/W2043687642,"Transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) functions downstream of inflammatory cytokines to activate c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) as well as NF-kappaB in several cell types. However, the functional role of TAK1 in an in vivo setting has not been determined. Here we have demonstrated that TAK1 is the major regulator of skin inflammation as well as keratinocyte death in vivo. Epidermal-specific deletion of TAK1 causes a severe inflammatory skin condition by postnatal day 6-8. The mutant skin also exhibits massive keratinocyte death. Analysis of keratinocytes isolated from the mutant skin revealed that TAK1 deficiency results in a striking increase in apoptosis in response to tumor necrosis factor (TNF). TAK1-deficient keratinocytes cannot activate NF-kappaB or JNK upon TNF treatment. These results suggest that TNF induces TAK1-deficient keratinocyte death because of the lack of NF-kappaB (and possibly JNK)-mediated cell survival signaling. Finally, we have shown that deletion of the TNF receptor can largely rescue keratinocyte death as well as inflammatory skin condition in epidermal-specific TAK1-deficient mice. Our results demonstrate that TAK1 is a master regulator of TNF signaling in skin and regulates skin inflammation and keratinocyte death."
https://openalex.org/W2051135818,"Clinical and animal studies suggest that estrogen receptors are involved in the development of myocardial hypertrophy and heart failure. In this study, we investigated whether human myocardial estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) expression, localization, and association with structural proteins was altered in end stage-failing hearts. We found a 1.8-fold increase in ERalpha mRNA and protein in end-stage human dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM, n=41), as compared with controls (n=25). ERalpha was visualized by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and localized to the cytoplasm, sarcolemma, intercalated discs and nuclei of cardiomyocytes. Immunofluorescence studies demonstrated colocalization of ERalpha with beta-catenin at the intercalated disc in control hearts and immunoprecipitation studies confirmed complex formation of both proteins. Interestingly, the ERalpha/beta-catenin colocalization was lost at the intercalated disc in DCM hearts. Thus, the ERalpha/beta-catenin colocalization in the intercalated disc may be of functional relevance and a loss of this association may play a role in the progression of heart failure. The increase of total ERalpha expression may represent a compensatory process to contribute to the stability of cardiac intercalated discs."
https://openalex.org/W2098416899,"Mechanosensing by cells directs changes in bone mass and structure in response to the challenges of mechanical loading. Low-amplitude, high-frequency loading stimulates bone growth by enhancing bone formation and inhibiting disuse osteoporosis. However, how bone cells sense vibration stress is unknown. Hence, we investigated bone cell responses to vibration stress at a wide frequency range (5-100 Hz). We used NO and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) release, and COX-2 mRNA expression as parameters for bone cell response since these molecules regulate bone adaptation to mechanical loading. NO release positively correlated whereas PGE2 release negatively correlated to the maximum acceleration rate of the vibration stress. COX-2 mRNA expression increased in a frequency-dependent manner, which relates to increased NO release at high frequencies, confirming our previous results. The negatively correlated release of NO and PGE2 suggests that these signaling molecules play different roles in bone adaptation to high-frequency loading. The maximum acceleration rate is proportional to omega3 (frequency=omega/2pi), which is commensurate with the Stokes-Einstein relation for modeling cell nucleus motion within the cytoplasm due to vibration stress. Correlations of NO and PGE2 with the maximum acceleration rate then relate to nucleus oscillations, providing a physical basis for cellular mechanosensing of high-frequency loading."

In this paper, we show that a cyclic model of the universe can naturally incorporate a dynamical mechanism that automatically relaxes the value of the cosmological constant, including contributions to the vacuum density at all energy scales. Because the relaxation time grows exponentially as the vacuum density decreases, nearly every volume of space spends an overwhelming majority of the time at the stage when the cosmological constant is small and positive, as observed today."

https://openalex.org/W2067860210,"Deregulation of Tau phosphorylation is a key question in Alzheimer disease pathogenesis. Recently, Pin1, a peptidylprolyl cis/trans-isomerase, was proposed to be a new modulator in Tau phosphorylation in Alzheimer disease. In vitro, Pin1 was reported to present a high affinity for both Thr(P)-231, a crucial site for microtubule binding, and Thr(P)-212. In fact, Pin1 may facilitate Thr(P)-231 dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 2A through trans isomerization of the Thr(P)-Pro peptide bound. However, whether Pin1 binding to Tau leads to isomerization of a single site or of multiple Ser/Thr(P)-Pro sites in vivo is still unknown. In the present study, Pin1 involvement was investigated in stress-induced Tau dephosphorylation with protein phosphatase 2A activation. Both oxidative (H2O2) and heat stresses induced hypophosphorylation of a large set of phospho-Tau epitopes in primary cortical cultures. In both cases, juglone, a Pin1 pharmacological inhibitor, partially prevented dephosphorylation of Tau at Thr-231 among a set of phosphoepitopes tested. Moreover, Pin1 is physiologically found in neurons and partially co-localized with Tau. Furthermore, in Pin1-deficient neuronal primary cultures, H2O2 stress-induced Tau dephosphorylation at Thr(P)-231 was significantly lower than in wild type neurons. Finally, Pin1 transfection in Pin1-deficient neuronal cell cultures allowed for rescuing the effect of H2O2 stress-induced Tau dephosphorylation, whereas a Pin1 catalytic mutant did not.

The phosphoprotein Tau is a key regulator of microtubule dynamics. The functions of Tau are regulated by site-specific phosphorylation events (1Buée L. Bussière T. Buée-Scherrer V. Delacourte A. Hof P.R. Brain Res. Rev. 2000; 33: 95-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar). Among the numerous phosphorylation sites in Tau, Thr-231 plays a critical regulatory role because its phosphorylation greatly diminishes the ability of Tau to bind and stabilize microtubules in the cell (2Hamdane M. Sambo A.V. Delobel P. Bégard S. Violleau A. Delacourte A. Bertrand P. Benavides J. Buée L. J. Biol.

In neurofibrillary tangles, Tau is hyperphosphorylated on many serine or threonine residues preceding proline (Ser/Thr(P)-Pro). Among them, Thr-212 and Thr-231 are Tau conformation-dependent epitopes clearly identified as abnormally phosphorylated in AD (5Hoffmann R. Lee V.M. Leight S. Varga I. Otvos Jr., L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8114-8124Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 6Jicha G.A. Lane E. Vincent I. Otvos L. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2087-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). A complex set of modulators tightly regulates the dynamic phosphorylation state of Tau. The phosphorylation state of a protein reflects the balance between activation and inhibition of kinases, phosphatases, and partners able to support their activity through conformational changes. A deregulation of these mechanisms is a central point in the etiopathology of AD and other neurodegenerative pathologies (for review Ref. 1Buée L. Bussière T. Buée-Scherrer V. Delacourte A. Hof P.R. Brain Res. Rev. 2000; 33: 95-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar). Thus, characterization of proteins that modulate Tau phosphorylation-dephosphorylation processes is essential for the understanding of the pathological events. The peptidylprolyl isomerase Pin1 catalyzes the cis/trans isomerization in a subset of proteins on Ser(P)/Thr(P) residues preceding proline. Although Pin1 has been widely studied in the cell cycle and cancer, little is known about its role in the brain. Recent data suggested that Pin1 might be involved in AD pathogenesis, because it is found in neurofibrillary tangles (7Lu P.J. Wulf G. Zhou X.Z. Davies P. Lu K.P. Nature. 1999; 399: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). In vitro studies showed that Pin1 was able to bind Tau through Thr(P)-231 (7Lu P.J. Wulf G. Zhou X.Z. Davies P. Lu K.P. Nature. 1999; 399: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, further studies on Pin1 knock-out mice suggested that there was an inverse correlation between Pin1 expression and neurofibrillary degeneration in AD (8Liou Y.C. Sun A. Ryo A. Zhou X.Z.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2032-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Deregulation of Pin1 activity, expression or localization might induce an imbalance in the phosphorylation-dephosphorylation state at specific epitopes inducing a disturbance in the interactions between Tau and its target proteins. In fact, Pin1 may facilitate Tau dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) (11Zhou X.Z. Kops O. Werner A. Lu P.J. Shen M. Stoller G. Kullertz G. Stark M. Fischer G. Lu K.P. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 873-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms underlying the functional involvement of Pin1 in Tau deregulation are still unknown. Oxidative stress, an early event in Alzheimer disease occurring prior to cytopathology, induces rapid hypophosphorylation of Tau epitopes (12Davis D.R. Anderton B.H. Brion J.P. Reynolds C.H. Hanger D.P. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1590-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This Tau dephosphorylation is likely to be mediated through PP2A activation (13Goldbaum O. Richter-Landsberg C. Glia. 2002; 40: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Such PP2A activation leading to Tau dephosphorylation is also observed in other stress conditions such as heat shock (13Goldbaum O. Richter-Landsberg C. Glia. 2002; 40: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 14Papasozomenos S.C. Papasozomenos T. J. Alzheimer Dis. 1999; 1: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In the present study, the potential involvement of Pin1 in Tau dephosphorylation was assessed in primary neuronal cell cultures using both oxidative and heat stresses and a pharmacological Pin1 inhibitor, juglone (15Chao S.H. Greenleaf A.L. Price D.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 767-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The role of Pin1 was further investigated in Pin1-deficient cultures obtained from Pin1 knock-out mice embryos. In these studies, we demonstrated that Pin1 plays an active role in stress-induced Tau dephosphorylation, preferentially at Thr-231 epitope. This is the first demonstration of an in situ Pin1 involvement in a differential Tau dephosphorylation. Primary Embryonic Neuronal Culture—Rat primary cortical neurons were prepared from 17-18-day-old Wistar rat embryos as follows. Briefly, brain and meninges were removed. Cortex was carefully dissected out and mechanically dissociated in culture medium by triturating with a polished Pasteur pipette. Once dissociated and after blue trypan counting, cells were plated at a density of 2.5 × 104 cells/cm2 in poly-d-lysine and laminin-coated 24-well plates or Labtech (Becton Dickinson). For dissociation, plating, and maintenance, we used Neurobasal medium supplemented with 2% B27 containing 200 mm glutamine and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic agent (Invitrogen). Medium was replenished every 3 days and 24 h before cell treatment. Pin1 Knock-out Primary Embryonic Neuronal Culture—For knock-out studies, primary cortical neurons were prepared from 15-17-day-old mice embryos. Pin1-deficient neurons were obtained from embryos derived from heterozygous pairings. Homozygous pairings are not possible because homozygous male are sterile. Each embryo was dissected and plated individually. In each experiment, neurons acquired from wild type littermate embryos were used as controls. The genotype of each embryo was determined using the remaining tissue and primers as described in Fujimori et al. (16Fujimori F. Takahashi K. Uchida C. Uchida T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 658-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Pin1 cDNAs—Pin1 cDNA was obtained from Prof. P. Davies (AECOM, Bronx, NY). It was subcloned in a pcDNA4 plasmid (Invitrogen). Site-directed mutagenesis was made by PCR using the QuikChange system from Stratagene. Ser-115, a residue located close to the juglone targeted Cys-113, was mutated into glutamate. It is a consensus residue among peptidylprolyl isomerases and breaks one of the helixes of the catalytic pocket (17Ranganathan R. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 875-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Pin1 S115E sequence primers were sense, 5′-CAGCGACTGCAGCGAAGCCAAGGCCAGG-3′ and anti-sense, 5′-CCTGGCCTTGGCTTCGCTGCAGTCGCT-3′. These three pcDNA4 plasmids (empty, Pin1, and [S115E]Pin1) were used for further transfections. Transfection of Primary Embryonic Culture—Primary cortical cultures were transfected 7 days after plating with Pin1 cDNA plasmids using a modified Ca2+-phosphate transfection method (18Jiang M. Deng L. Chen G. Gene Ther. 2004; 11: 1303-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, culture medium was replaced by prewarmed Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and preserved. Both the original culture medium and cells were returned to a 5% CO2 incubator. In the meantime, the DNA/Ca2+-phosphate precipitate was prepared using ProFection Mammalian Transfection System (Promega). Per well (24-well plate), 3 μg of cDNA and 3.1 μl of 2 m CaCl2 adjusted with H2O to a total volume of 25 μl (solution A) were mixed to 25 μl of 2 × Hanks' balanced salt (solution B). Solution A was added by ∼1/8 volume to solution B while gently mixing (600 rpm). The mixed solution was kept at -20 °C for 5 min to prime the precipitate and then at room temperature for 15 min. The DNA/Ca2+-phosphate suspension solution was added dropwise to each well. Cells were incubated in presence of the precipitate for 30 min in a 5% CO2 culture incubator at 37 °C. After incubation, transfection medium was replaced by 10% CO2-equilibrated Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated for 20 min in a 5% CO2 incubator. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was replaced by the original culture medium, and cells were returned to 5% CO2 incubator. Cell Treatment—At 10 days in vitro, cells were preincubated for 2 h with 1 μm juglone and/or treated with 1 mm H2O2 for the indicated time, or exposed to 44 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 30 min. Thirty percent stock hydrogen peroxide (Prolabo) was dissolved in 0.2 m phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). Thirty-one μm stock okadaic acid (Sigma) was dissolved in ethanol. COS Cell Culture—COS cells were grown as described previously (19Mailliot C. Sergeant N. Bussiere T. Caillet-Boudin M.L. Delacourte A. Buée L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Transient transfection was performed using ExGen (Euromedex, France), and cell lysates were analyzed after 24 h (2Hamdane M. Sambo A.V. Delobel P. Bégard S. Violleau A. Delacourte A. Bertrand P. Benavides J. Buée L. J. Biol.

Antibodies—AD2 is directed against phosphorylated Ser-396 and Ser-404, Tau1 recognizes Tau only when serines 195, 198, 199, and 202 are not phosphorylated, AT180 (Pierce Perbio) recognizes phosphorylated Thr-231, and anti-Tau (pT212) (BIOSOURCE) recognizes Thr(P)-212. Phosphorylation-independent antibodies M19G and anti-Tau-carboxyl-terminal (Tau-C-ter) are well characterized antisera, directed against the first 19 amino acids and the last 15 amino acids of Tau sequence, respectively (1Buée L.

The anti-β-actin antibody was obtained from Sigma, anti-synaptophysin and anti-Pin1 were from Santa-Cruz (H-123), anti-neuronal nuclei was from Chemicon (MAB377), anti-cyclin D was from Upstate Biotechnology, and anti-phospho-Pin1 (Ser-16) was from Cell Signaling. Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Equal volumes of cells harvested in Nu-Page sample buffer (Invitrogen) were denaturated at 100 °C during 5 min, loaded on 4-12% NuPAGE Novex gels (Invitrogen), and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline, pH 8, 0.05% Tween 20 with 5% skim milk or bovine serum albumin, and incubated with primary antibody. Membranes were incubated with horse-radish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgGs, Sigma), and bands were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Western blots were quantified by densitometry as described previously. Phosphorylated and total Tau (detected by M19G antibody) levels were normalized to β-actin (used as an internal loading control) for each blot (2Hamdane M. Sambo A.V. Delobel P. Bégard S.

We previously verified that actin was not cleaved under the different treatments. Phosphorylated Tau levels were further normalized to total Tau to measure the exact phosphorylation state. Immunocytochemistry—Cell cultures were fixed in cold 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.05% glutaraldehyde, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 30% glycerol in 70 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, for1hat room temperature. Permeabilization was carried out in 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 min. Cells were treated with NaBH4 (10 mg/ml) for 7 min. After a 30-min saturation in 4% bovine serum albumin, double immunostainings were carried out using anti-Pin1 and AT180 antibodies. Pin1 staining was revealed with a goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) antibody coupled to Alexa Fluor®488 and AT180 with a goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) antibody coupled to Alexa Fluor®568 (Molecular Probes). Slides were analyzed by a Leica TCS NT confocal laser scanning microscope. Analysis and Statistics—Results were expressed as means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. Statistics were performed by one-way analysis of variance followed by post-hoc Newman-Keuls. Juglone Partially Reverses Oxidative Stress-induced Dephosphorylation of Thr(P)-231 Tau—As Tau is extensively phosphorylated in fetal neurons, primary neuronal cultures provide an appropriate model to study mechanisms regulating Tau dephosphorylation. H2O2 is a highly toxic product of oxidative stress mainly because of its free diffusion through the cells. Oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide has been previously reported to induce hypophosphorylation of Tau through PP2A (12Davis D.R. Anderton B.H. Brion J.P. Reynolds C.H. Hanger D.P. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1590-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 13Goldbaum O. Richter-Landsberg C. Glia. 2002; 40: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 21Zambrano C.A. Egana J.T. Nunez M.T. Maccioni R.B. Gonzales-Billault C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 1393-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Cortical cultures were exposed to 1 mm H2O2 for 1 h. Western blots (Fig. 1A) revealed with the anti-phosphorylated Tau antibodies AT180, anti-Tau (pT212), and AD2 showed that H2O2 induced a decrease in phosphorylated Tau at threonine 231, threonine 212, and serines 396 and 404 (using the numbering convention of the longest human isoform of Tau), respectively. H2O2-induced dephosphorylation was confirmed by immunoblotting with the Tau1 antibody, which recognizes Tau only when it is not phosphorylated on serine residues 195, 198, 199, and 202. Dephosphorylated Tau detected by Tau1 increased after treatment with H2O2. Furthermore, H2O2 cell exposure induced a change of electrophoretic mobility and a decrease of total Tau detected by M19G antibody (20 ± 7%) and anti-Tau-C-ter (15 ± 3%), reflecting a global dephosphorylation and a partial degradation of Tau. To assess the involvement of Pin1 in stress-induced dephosphorylation of Tau, juglone was used to inhibit its activity (15Chao S.H. Greenleaf A.L. Price D.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 767-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 22Hennig L. Christner C. Kipping M. Schelbert B. Rucknagel K.P. Grabley S. Kullertz G. Fisher G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5953-5960Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Neuronal cultures were preincubated for 2 h with 1 μm juglone prior H2O2 addition (Fig. 1A). We checked that 1 μm juglone did not alter either cell viability as assessed by MTS assay or the basal phosphorylation state of the various Tau epitopes tested (not shown). Juglone pretreatment before H2O2 addition did not modify the levels of phosphorylated Tau epitopes Thr(P)-212-Tau, AD2, and Tau1. Conversely, inhibition of Pin1 by juglone partially prevented dephosphorylation of Tau at threonine 231 (27 ± 6%) as seen on Western blot revealed with the phospho-dependent Tau antibody AT180. Furthermore, as we reported above, H2O2 addition induced a partial decrease in total Tau as previously described (23Rametti A. Esclaire F. Yardin C. Terro F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54518-54528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 24Canu N. Dus L. Barbato C. Ciotti M.T. Brancolini C. Rinaldi A.M. Novak M. Cattaneo A. Bradbury A. Calissano P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7061-7074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under the same treatments, no significant changes were observed by immunoblotting for the neuron-specific marker NeuN and for the synaptic vesicle component synaptophysin indicating that there is no loss of cellular integrity (data not shown). These data suggest that Pin1 participates to H2O2-induced Tau dephosphorylation at threonine 231 under conditions that dephosphorylate a large set of phospho-Tau epitopes. To extend the analysis of Pin1 involvement in stress mechanisms with PP2A activation, the juglone effect was tested on heat shock-induced Tau dephosphorylation. Previous studies described how heat shock caused rapid dephosphorylation of Tau in rats (14Papasozomenos S.C. Papasozomenos T. J. Alzheimer Dis. 1999; 1: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and in cultured oligodendrocytes (13Goldbaum O. Richter-Landsberg C. Glia. 2002; 40: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In cortical cultures, heat shock (30 min at 44 °C) partially dephosphorylated Tau at serines 195, 198, 199, 202, 396, 404, and threonine 212 and 231. Juglone, like in H2O2 treatment, was only able to partially and selectively prevent heat shock-induced Tau dephosphorylation at Thr-231 (Fig. 2). These results suggest that heat shock-induced Tau dephosphorylation involves Pin1 at threonine 231. Thus, Pin1 participation to Tau dephosphorylation may be a common mechanism to various stresses. Modulation of Pin1 Activation State through Its Phosphorylation on Serine 16—Because the direct rotamase activity of Pin1 could only be visualized directly by NMR spectroscopy, we first analyzed phosphorylation on serine 16, which is located inside the WW domain, and recently reported to inhibit Pin1 binding to its substrates (25Lu P.J. Zhou X.Z. Liou Y.C. Noel J.P. Lu K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2381-2384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Ser(P)-16 was analyzed in basal conditions and under H2O2 and/or okadaic acid treatment (at a 50 nm concentration specifically inhibiting PP2A) (Fig. 3). Total Pin1 levels were not modified under H2O2 and/or okadaic acid treatments. Phosphoserine-16-Pin1 antibody only slightly detected Pin1 protein in control conditions indicating that Pin1 could bind to its substrates, in our culture conditions. H2O2 further decreased Pin1 Ser-16 phosphorylation, suggesting that Pin1 has a better ability to bind its substrates in stress-induced conditions. Conversely, the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid induced a strong phosphorylation of Pin1 suggesting that dephosphorylation of phosphoserine 16 would be mediated, at least partly, by PP2A (Fig. 3). Oxidative Stress-induced Dephosphorylation of Tau in Pin1-deficient Cultures—To challenge our results obtained with juglone inhibition, we therefore tested whether Pin1 deficiency would modify the response to the most efficient stress-induced Tau dephosphorylation, H2O2. We compared the effect of H2O2 on AT180, Thr(P)-212-Tau, AD2, Tau1, M19G, and anti-Tau-C-ter epitopes in Pin1 and Pin1-deficient cortical neuronal cultures. We first verified by genotyping and immunoblotting the absence of Pin1 in cells cultured from knock-out Pin1 embryos (Fig. 4). Regarding the effects of H2O2 on Tau dephosphorylation, data were similar in rat and mice primary neuronal cell cultures (Fig. 1 versus Fig. 5, panels wt). H2O2-induced dephosphorylation of Tau revealed with anti-Thr(P)-212-Tau, AD2, Tau 1, M19G, and anti-Tau-C-ter remained unchanged in Pin1-deficient neuronal cultures as compared with wild type cultures. Interestingly, significant protection to H2O2 treatment in Pin1-deficient neuronal cultures was observed only using the anti-phosphorylated Tau antibody AT180 (Fig. 5). This provides further evidence that Pin1 is specifically involved in Thr(P)-231 Tau dephosphorylation.FIGURE 5Pin1 deficiency prevents H2O2-induced dephosphorylation of Tau at Thr-231 site. Western blots analysis using phospho-dependent (A, AT180; B, anti-pTau212; C, AD2; D, Tau1) and phospho-independent (E, M19G; F, anti-TauCter) Tau antibodies. Cortical cultures were prepared from individual wild type (WT)or Pin1-deficient embryos and treated with 1 mm H2O2. Tau dephosphorylation was significantly reduced at epitope Thr-231 (A, AT180) in H2O2-treated Pin1-deficient cultures compared with wild type. At the opposite, no difference was observed for the other phospho-Tau epitopes tested and for total Tau. The densitometric analysis was represented for each epitope tested. Each data point represents combined values from four separate embryos. *, p < 0.01 versus H2O2-treated wild type cells.

A strong presence of Pin1 was also observed in neurites and varicosities. On parallel, AT180 mainly stained axons and cellular body. A double staining with both antibodies (merge) revealed partial colocalization between anti-Pin1 and AT180 antibodies to cellular bodies and neurites. These data correlate a possible Pin1 and Thr(P)-231 Tau colocalization, facilitating the access of Pin1 to Tau and specific isomerization of the Thr(P)-231-proline peptide bond under dephosphorylation conditions. In Pin1-deficient neurons, a similar AT180 immunoreactivity was found (Fig. 6, bottom panel). Rescue of H2O2-induced Dephosphorylation of Tau in Pin1-deficient Neurons—To learn the precise role of the Pin1 prolyl isomerase activity in H2O2-induced Tau dephosphorylation, Pin1-deficient cultures were transfected at 7 days in vitro with cDNA coding for wild type Pin1 or a catalytic mutant where Ser-115 was replaced by a glutamic acid, S115E. Three days after transfection, we observed by Western blotting a strong expression of both wild type and Glu-115-mutated Pin1 as detected with anti-Pin1 antibody (Fig. 7A). These results proved the high efficiency of transfection of the modified Ca2+-phosphate method used. Thus, the effect of wild type Pin1 and Glu-115 mutant overexpression on H2O2-induced dephosphorylation of Tau in Pin1-deficient neurons was tested by immunoblotting. First, to test the efficiency of wild type Pin1 and catalytic mutant Glu-115 activities, the effect of their overexpression on cyclin D levels were analyzed in COS cells and Pin1-deficient cortical cultures (Fig. 7A). To assess the efficiency of both constructs, the amounts of cyclin D, which was shown as stabilized at both mRNA and protein levels by Pin1, was quantified by immunoblotting (26Wulf G.M. Ryo A.

A cyclin D increase was observed in both cultures overexpressing Pin1. Conversely, such cyclin D1 increase was not visualized with the Glu-115 mutant overexpression (Fig. 7B). Three days after transfection, Pin1-deficient cultures were treated by H2O2 for 30 min to mildly dephosphorylate Tau. We compared H2O2 treatment effect on AT180, Thr(P)-212-Tau, AD2, Tau1, and M19G epitopes in Pin1-deficient cortical neuronal culture transfected with no coding cDNA, wild type, or Glu-115 mutated-Pin1 (Fig. 8A). No effect of wild type or Glu-115-mutated Pin1 overexpression was observed for the phosphorylated Tau epitopes Thr(P)-212-Tau, AD2, and Tau1. However, wild type Pin1 overexpression increased Tau dephosphorylation only using the anti-phosphorylated Tau antibody AT180. The catalytic Glu-115 mutant was not as effective because its overexpression partially prevented the increased dephosphorylation of Tau (Fig. 8B). H2O2-induced dephosphorylation of Tau at the Thr-231 site in transfected Pin1-deficient cultures was illustrated by immunofluorescence studies and analyzed by confocal microscopy (Fig. 9). Overexpression of either wild type Pin1 or the Glu-115 mutant induced a strong staining detected by anti-Pin1 antibody in transfected cells. In cells exhibiting a clear neuronal morphology, an AT180 immunoreactivity was observed. Then, we looked for cells with similar morphology that exhibited Pin1 immunoreactivity. A weak AT180 staining was found in cells transfected with Pin1, whereas AT180 immunoreactivity in cells transfected with the Pin1 mutant Glu-115 was similar to the one observed in non-transfected cells. Altogether, these observations further strengthen the role of the catalytic domain of Pin1 prolyl isomerase in the H2O2-induced dephosphorylation of Tau at Thr-231 site. Tau phosphorylation is likely to be a main actor in neurofibrillary degeneration. However, the deregulation of Tau phosphorylation is still a key question in AD pathogenesis. Protein phosphorylation is regulated through a balance of kinases and phosphatases. Recently, glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) inhibitors were shown to slow down neurofibrillary degeneration in a Tau transgenic model, suggesting that GSK3β is a main kinase involved in Tau phosphorylation (29Noble W. Planel E. Zehr C. Olm V. Meyerson J. Suleman F. Gaynor K. Wang L. LaFrancois J. Feinstein B. Burns M. Krishnamurthy P. Wen Y. Bhat R. Lewis J. Dickson D. Duff K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6990-6995Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Conversely, recent data also indicated that the lack of phosphatase activity in AD brains might lead to Tau hyperphosphorylation (30Tanimukai H. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Am. J. Pathol. 2005; 6: 1761-1771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Finally, a new regulator of phosphorylation was also involved, the peptidylprolyl cis/trans-isomerase Pin1. Many phosphorylation sites defined as pathological are phospho-Ser/Thr followed by Pro. The conformation of this peptide bond is crucial for the action of phosphatases. PP2A is only able to dephosphorylate Ser(P)/Thr(P)-Pro when it is in a trans conformation but not in a cis conformation (11Zhou X.Z. Kops O. Werner A. Lu P.J. Shen M. Stoller G. Kullertz G. Stark M. Fischer G. Lu K.P. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 873-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The interest in Pin1 as a key actor in neurofibrillary degeneration is supported by the fact that Pin1 knock-out mice develop neurofibrillary tangles (7Lu P.J. Wulf G. Zhou X.Z. Davies P. Lu K.P. Nature. 1999; 399: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 8Liou Y.C. Sun A. Ryo A. Zhou X.Z. Yu Z.X. Huang H.K. Uchida T. Bronson R. Bing G. Li X. Hunter T. Lu H.P. Nature. 2003; 424: 556-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Pin1 was reported to present a high affinity for both the Thr(P)-231 and Thr(P)-212 of Tau protein (7Lu P.J. Wulf G. Zhou X.Z. Davies P. Lu K.P. Nature. 1999; 399: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 9Wintjens R. Wieruszeski J.M. Drobecq H. Rousselot-Pailley P. Buee L. Lippens G. Landrieu I. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2032-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, whether binding of Pin1 to Tau leads to isomerization of a single site or of multiple Ser(P)/Thr(P)-Pro sites in vivo is still unknown (31Smet C. Wieruszeski J.M. Buée L. Landrieu I. Lippens G. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4159-4164Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Moreover, the enzyme activity of Pin1 is dependent on the level of phosphorylation of its substrate. For instance, Tau peptide with a unique phosphorylation site (Thr(P)-212) is a better substrate than multiphosphorylated peptides. Indeed, the WW domain of Pin1 may act as a negative regulator of the cis/trans isomerization activity when Pin1 substrates are multiphosphorylated (31Smet C. Wieruszeski J.M. Buée L. Landrieu I. Lippens G. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4159-4164Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, it is necessary to determine the effect of Pin1 in vivo on phosphorylated full-length Tau protein. Six Ser/Thr-Pro residues (Ser-199, Ser-202, Thr-212, Thr-231, Ser-396, and Ser-404) dephosphorylated by PP2A were studied to cover the entire Tau molecule (32Liu F. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Gong G.X. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 22: 1942-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Finally, further demonstration is needed to highlight Pin1 and Tau relationships in dephosphorylation mechanisms. Two stresses leading to PP2A activation were used to assess the involvement of Pin1 in Tau dephosphorylation. First, the present data indicate that Pin1 preferentially modulates stress-induced dephosphorylation of Tau on Thr-231. Juglone, a pharmacological Pin1 inhibitor was used to inactivate rotamase activity. Pin1 inhibition led to a decreased effect of both oxidative and heat stresses induced dephosphorylation of Thr(P)-231 Tau without affecting dephosphorylation of other sites. Nevertheless, juglone inhibits numerous parvulins as well as other enzymes comprising Cys residues in their catalytic domains (15Chao S.H. Greenleaf A.L. Price D.H.

Chem. 2005; 48: 4815-4823Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), but Pin1-deficient cells are likely to be the most useful tools. We have set up an original approach by developing primary neuronal cultures from Pin1 knock-out mice. Thus, the pharmacological effect of juglone observed in Tau dephosphorylation experiments in wild type neurons was then compared with similar work in Pin1 knock-out neurons. Pin1 deficiency led to a decreased effect of H2O2-induced dephosphorylation of Thr(P)-231 Tau without affecting dephosphorylation of other sites. It further supports that lack of Pin1 activity leads to a deficient Tau dephosphorylation at Thr(P)-231 under stress conditions. Nevertheless, we cannot speak about an exclusive selectivity of Pin1 isomerase activity for Thr(P)-231 because only 6 of the 17 Ser(P)/Thr(P)-Pro sites present on Tau were investigated. However, our results allow for demonstrating that Pin1 does not modulate H2O2-induced dephosphorylation of Thr(P)-212 Tau despite recent NMR results showing an even higher affinity of Pin1 for Thr(P)-212 than for Thr(P)-231 Tau (10Smet C. Sambo A.V. Wieruszeski J.M. Leroy A. Landrieu I. Buee L. Lippens G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2032-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Anyhow, this does not preclude that Pin1 may not isomerize Thr(P)-212 Tau in cells under different dephosphorylating conditions or in specific types of neurons or brain area. Neither juglone nor Pin1 deficiency completely abolished the H2O2-induced effect, indicating that Thr(P)-231 may be dephosphorylated without Pin1. It is not surprising because only a small percentage of the peptide bound is in a cis conformation. Most of it is already in a trans conformation. This could be because of a direct, although slower, isomerization of Thr(P)-231-Pro peptide bond, or possibly another isomerase enzyme. Pin1 is constituted of two structural domains, a C-terminal catalytic and an anchoring N-terminal WW domain. Phosphorylation of the WW domain on Ser-16 abolishes its capacity to interact with phosphoepitopes (25Lu P.J. Zhou X.Z. Liou Y.C. Noel J.P. Lu K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2381-2384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that in control conditions, a majority of Pin1 is in a favorable state to bind to its substrates. Stress further increases Pin1 ability to bind Tau through dephosphorylation of Ser(P)-16 WW domain of Pin1. So, stress-induced dephosphorylation of Ser(P)-16-Pin1 increases its potential to bind Tau and isomerase Thr(P)-231 site. The transfection of either functional Pin1 or a catalytic defective mutant in Pin1-deficient primary neuronal cultures further supports the role of the rotamase activity in the stress-induced Tau dephosphorylation process. In differentiated cultured neurons, Pin1 was localized not only in the nucleus but also in the cytoplasm and the neurite network (40Hamdane M. Dourlen P. Bretteville A. Sambo A.V. Ferreira S. Ando K. Kerdraon O. Bégard S. Geay L. Lippens G. Sergeant N. Delacourte A. Maurage C.A. Galas M.C. Buée L. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. January 17, 2006; 10.1016/j.mcn.2006.03.006PubMed Google Scholar). Histochemical data previously reported cytoplasmic and nuclear Pin1 in the brain (8Liou Y.C. Sun A. Ryo A. Zhou X.Z. Yu Z.X. Huang H.K. Uchida T. Bronson R. Bing G. Li X. Hunter T. Lu H.P. Nature. 2003; 424: 556-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). On one hand, the partial co-localization of Pin1 with Thr(P)-231-Tau illustrates their close vicinity in the neuron, making possible a rapid interaction between both proteins. On the other hand, Thr(P)-231 Tau localization is likely to be Pin1-independent, as no change was observed in Pin1-deficient neurons. As Thr-231 is a crucial site for the microtubule binding activity of Tau, in the brain, reduction or absence of Pin1 isomerase activity would be able to significantly modify the response of Tau to pathological assault. As oxidative stress is involved early in AD, Pin1 alteration might be a very preliminary request to initiate neurofibrillary tangles and, consequently, restoration of Pin1 activity may represent an attractive target for future therapeutics drugs. We thank Pr. Uchida for providing Pin1 knock-out mice and Martial Flactif for his technical expertise in confocal microscopy."

The activity of this transcription factor is known to be increased by hypoxia, but also by a growing number of apparently unrelated factors that can activate it even in nonhypoxic conditions. Here I propose a model in which an alteration in oxygen metabolism is the key cellular event involved in HIF-1 activation under hypoxic and nonhypoxic conditions. This new perspective unifies previously unrelated observations and predicts cellular processes and therapeutic strategies that may modify HIF-1 activity. This may have relevance, for instance, to cancer, as HIF-1 overexpression is observed in many human cancers and has been associated with increased patient mortality."
https://openalex.org/W1970480149,"The nuclear pore complex (NPC) conducts macromolecular transport to and from the nucleus and provides a kinetic/hydrophobic barrier composed of phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeats. Nuclear transport is achieved through permeation of this barrier by transport receptors. The transport receptor CRM1 facilitates export of a large variety of cargoes. Export of the preribosomal 60 S subunit follows this pathway through the adaptor protein NMD3. Using RNA interference, we depleted two FG-containing cytoplasmically oriented NPC complexes, Nup214-Nup88 and Nup358, and investigated CRM1-mediated export. A dramatic defect in NMD3-mediated export of preribosomes was found in Nup214-Nup88-depleted cells, whereas only minor export defects were evident in other CRM1 cargoes or upon depletion of Nup358. We show that the large C-terminal FG domain of Nup214 is not accessible to freely diffusing molecules from the nucleus, indicating that it does not conduct 60 S preribosomes through the NPC. Consistently, derivatives of Nup214 lacking the FG-repeat domain rescued the 60 S export defect. We show that the coiled-coil region of Nup214 is sufficient for 60 S nuclear export, coinciding with recruitment of Nup88 to the NPC. Our data indicate that Nup214 plays independent roles in NPC function by participating in the kinetic/hydrophobic barrier through its FG-rich domain and by enabling NPC gating through association with Nup88."
https://openalex.org/W1993739774,"The basal layer of limbal and central corneal epithelium is enriched in stem cells and transient amplifying cells, respectively. This physical separation of stem and transient amplifying cells makes the limbal/corneal epithelium an exceptionally suitable system for isolating basal cells enriched in these two proliferative populations. Prior attempts to isolate epithelial stem cells used methods such as proteolytic tissue dissociation and cell sorting that could potentially alter their gene expression profile. Using laser capture microdissection, we were able to isolate resting limbal and corneal basal cells from frozen sections with minimal tissue processing, thereby improving the yield and quality of RNA. Analyses of RNA isolated from 300 limbal and corneal basal cells from eight mice revealed a set of ∼100 genes that are differentially expressed in limbal cells versus corneal epithelial basal cells. Semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR confirmed the up-regulation of three limbal and three corneal genes. LacZ identification of epiregulin from epiregulin-null mice and immunohistochemical staining of wild type mice confirmed that epiregulin, one of the limbal epithelium-enriched genes, was associated with the limbal epithelial basal cells. Within the limbal and corneal basal cells, we detected previously unknown genes that were differentially expressed in these two regions that contribute further to our understanding of the unique heterogeneity of these two closely related basal cell populations. Our findings indicate that we can obtain accurate gene expression profiles of the stem cell-enriched limbal basal cell population in their natural quiescent state."
https://openalex.org/W1624844572,"The molecular chaperones alphaA- and alphaB-crystallins are important for cell survival and genomic stability and associate with the tubulin cytoskeleton. The mitotic spindle is abnormally assembled in a number of alphaA-/- and alphaB-/- lens epithelial cells. However, no report to date has studied the effect of alpha-crystallin expression on tubulin/microtubule assembly in lens epithelial cells. In the current work we tested the hypothesis that the absence of alphaA- and alphaB-crystallins alters microtubule assembly. Microtubules were reconstituted from freshly dissected explants of wild-type, alphaA-/-, alphaB-/-, and alpha(A/B) -/- (DKO) mouse lens epithelia and examined by electron microscopic and biochemical analyses. The wild-type microtubules were 4 mum long and approximately 25 nm wide and had a characteristic protofilament structure, but alphaB-/- microtubules were 2.5-fold longer. Microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) extracted from microtubules by washing with salt included transketolase, alpha-enolase, and betaB2-crystallin. In DKO lens epithelial microtubules but not in wild-type, alphaA-/- or alphaB-/- microtubules, extraction of the MAPs gave very long (14-20 microm) ""polyfilament"" assemblies that were tightly bundled. Addition of exogenous alpha-crystallin (alphaA+ alphaB) was ineffective in preventing polyfilament formation. However, normal microtubule structure could be restored by including MAPs derived from wild-type lens epithelial cells during microtubule reconstitution. Intriguingly, these data suggest that alpha-crystallin may interact with MAPs to inhibit aggregation of microtubules in lens epithelial cells. Sedimentation analysis and 90 degrees light scattering measurements showed that alpha-crystallin suppressed tubulin assembly in vitro. Alpha-crystallin did not have a strong effect on the GTPase activity of purified tubulin. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that alpha-crystallin prevented heat-induced aggregation of tubulin, suggesting that alpha-crystallin may affect microtubule assembly by maintaining the pool of unassembled tubulin."

During meiosis, diploid precursor cells produce haploid gametes as two rounds of chromosome segregation (meiosis I and meiosis II) follow a single round of DNA replication. In the cell division of meiosis I a high level of recombination occurs between homologous chromosomes. This recombination is required for the development of chiasmata, which physically connect homologous chromosomes and ensure the proper chromosome segregation in most organisms. Homologous recombination is initiated by double-strand breaks (DSBs) 2The abbreviations used are: DSB, double-strand break; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; DTT, dl-dithiothreitol; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA. introduced by Spo11, a type II-like topoisomerase protein (1Zickler D.

In this work we present a biochemical and biophysical study on Hop2, Mnd1, and Hop2-Mnd1 important to understand the role of these proteins during meiotic homologous recombination. We find that the interaction of Mnd1 with Hop2 leads to changes in the biochemical properties and oligomerization state of Hop2 and an accompanying negative regulation of the Hop2 recombinational activity. Interestingly, these changes suggest that the formation of the Hop2-Mnd1 heterodimer results in a new interface that is responsible for the interaction and stimulation of the Dmc1 recombinase. Furthermore, we have carried out a mutational study of Hop2 and Hop2-Mnd1 that dissects some of the structural/functional requisites for these proteins. Purification and Refolding of Recombinant Mnd1—Murine MND1 was cloned in pET-15b (Novagen) at the NdeI-XhoI sites to generate a protein linked to a histidine tag on the amino terminus. The protein was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). The cells were grown to an A600 = 0.6–0.8, and Mnd1 synthesis was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 2 h at 37°C. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation, washed in chilled buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA), resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton, 5 mm EDTA, lysozyme 200 μg/ml, protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), 0.4 unit/ml DNase I) and lysed by sonication. Inclusion bodies were collected by centrifugation at 18,000 × g at 4 °C and washed in lysis buffer without EDTA and lysozyme and once in the following buffer: 20 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, 0.5 m NaCl, and protease inhibitors. Next, inclusion bodies were solubilized overnight with agitation in 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 0.5 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1.8 m guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl). Solubilized inclusion bodies were centrifuged 30 min at 18,000 × g, the supernatant was diluted 20–40 times in refolding solution (500 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol), and the refolding was allowed to proceed during 15 h at 4 °C. The solution containing the refolded protein was centrifuged 30 min at 8,000 × g and loaded on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column previously equilibrated with refolding buffer. The column was washed with 5 volumes of refolding buffer, and bound protein was eluted using a 5–500 mm imidazole linear gradient. The peak corresponding to Mnd1 was loaded on hydroxyapatite (Bio-Gel HT Gel, Bio-Rad) and washed with 10 column volumes of washing buffer (300 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), glycerol 10%). The protein was then eluted with a 100-ml linear gradient (0–300 mm) of phosphate buffer prepared in washing buffer. Finally, Mnd1 was concentrated by ultrafiltration (centripep YM-10, Amicon) and loaded on Superdex 200 (HP16/60, GE Healthcare) in 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl and 10% glycerol. Fractions corresponding to the protein peak were pooled, concentrated using Centripep YM-10 (Millipore), and stored in aliquots at –80 °C. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Hop2 and the Hop2-Mnd1 Complex—The mouse Hop2 and the Hop2-Mnd1 complex were purified essentially as described previously (23Petukhova G.V. Pezza R.J. Vanevski F. Ploquin M. Masson J.Y. CameriniOtero R.D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 449-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Briefly, HOP2 or HOP2 and MND1 together were cloned in a pET-15b vector (Novagen) to generate a protein linked to a histidine tag on the amino terminus (only Hop2 was His tagged in the Hop2-Mnd1 complex). The proteins were overexpressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and purified using the following series of chromatographic steps: nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen), hydroxyapatite (Bio-Gel HT Gel, Bio-Rad), Mono Q, and Superdex 200. The proteins were concentrated and stored in buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) at –80 °C. Construction and Purification of the Hop2-Mnd1 Complex Deletion Mutants—The Hop2-Mnd1 complex mutants containing COOH-terminal deletions in Hop2 and Mnd1 were constructed with a site-directed mutagenesis kit (QuikChange XL, Stratagene) by replacing a specific codon of the cDNA for a stop codon. We used the pET-15b plasmid containing both HOP2 and MND1 cDNA (see above) (or pET-15b containing only HOP2 cDNA, for Hop2 mutants) for the generation and expression of the following COOH-terminal Hop2-Mnd1 mutants: ΔC28Hop2, ΔC36Hop2, ΔC55Hop2, ΔC67Hop2, ΔC74Hop2, and ΔC92Hop2, which lack 28, 36, 55, 67, 74, and 92 amino acids from the Hop2 COOH-terminal end, respectively, and ΔC20Mnd1, ΔC55Mnd1, ΔC77Mnd1, ΔC92Mnd1, and ΔC106Mnd1, which lack 20, 55, 77, 92, and 106 amino acids from the Mnd1 COOH-terminal end, respectively. We used the same approach to generate the Hop2-Mnd1 complex mutants in which Met-110 and Glu-136 from the Hop2 sequence were substituted by Pro residues. The mutant proteins were purified as described for the full-length Hop2-Mnd1 complex. CD Spectra—CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco-J720 spectropolarimeter. Spectra of purified, refolded Mnd1 were recorded as the average of several individual scans in the far-UV region (from 190 to 250 nm) using a cuvette with a path length of 0.02 cm and the following instrument parameters: response time, 4 s; bandwidth, 10 nm and scan speed, 50 nm/min. The concentration of Mnd1 was 10 μm. DNA Substrates—In the DNA binding assay, all the plasmids were purchased from New England Biolabs, and the following oligonucleotides were synthesized by MWG Biotech: #1, 20-mer, CGTAGAAGCACCGAGCGTAA; #2, 20-mer, TTACGCTCGGTGCTTCTACG; #3, 60-mer, GCGGCATCAGAGCAGATTGTACTGAGAGTGCACCATATGCGGTGTGAAATACCGCACAGA; #4, 60-mer, TCTGTGCGGTATTTCACACCGCATATGGTGCACTCTCAGTACAATCTGCTCTGATGCCGC; #5, 57-mer, CGTAAGATGCTTTTCTGTGACTGGTGAGTACTCAACCAAGTCATTCTGAGAATAGTG; #6, 100-mer, TGTGGAATGCTACAGGCGTTGTAGTTTGTACTGGTGACGAAACTCAGTGTTACGGTACATGGGTTCCTATTGGGCTTGCTATCCCTGAAAATGAGGGTGG; #7, 100-mer, CCACCCTCATTTTCAGGGATAGCAAGCCCAATAGGAACCCATGTACCGTAACACTGAGTTTCGTCACCAGTACAAACTACAACGCCTGTAGCATTCCACA. The D-loop reactions were carried out using supercoiled pUC18 plasmid purified by Triton X-100 lysis followed by CsCl banding and a 60-mer oligonucleotide described above (oligonucleotide #5) with homology to the pUC18 plasmid. Single-stranded DNA was 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using standard protocols. The labeled strand was then annealed to the complementary strand to create blunt-ended dsDNA and gel purified in 7% polyacrylamide, 1 × TAE buffer. Finally, all the duplexes were purified using ion exchange columns (MERmaid Spin Kit, Qbio-gene). Cross-linking Experiments—The samples (15 μm Hop2, 10 μm Mnd1, and 12 μm Hop2-Mnd1) were equilibrated for 10 min on ice in the presence of reaction buffer (30 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 250 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol). The samples were then further incubated with bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate or suberic acid bis(N-hydroxysuccinimide ester) (Sigma) for 20 min at room temperature in a total reaction volume of 20 μl. The cross-linkers were then quenched through the addition of 1 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8) followed by incubation for 10 min at room temperature. Finally, the samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE (NuPAGE 4–12% linear gradient gels) in the absence of any reducing agent, and gels were stained with SimplyBlue SafeStain (Invitrogen). Analytical Sizing Chromatography—Samples of purified Hop2, Mnd1, and Hop2-Mnd1 complex were applied to a Superdex 200 PC 3.2/30 SMART column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was calibrated with the following globular proteins: ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa, 1.64 nm) (Amersham Biosciences), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa, 2.39 nm), ovalbumin (43 kDa, 3.05 nm), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa, 3.55 nm), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa, 4.45 nm), β-amylase (200 kDa, 6.0 nm) and thyroglobulin (669 kDa, 8.5 nm) (Sigma). The samples were loaded at 40 μl/min in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 300 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol. The elution of proteins was monitored at 280 nm, and the average position (Kav) was calculated using: Kav = (Ve – V0)/(Vt – V0), where Ve and Vt are elution volumes for the sample and small molecules (i.e. CoCl2), and V0 is the void volume (elution volume corresponding to blue dextran 2000). The values from each run and the corresponding Stoke's radius were estimated from the calibration curves. Peak fractions were also analyzed on SDS-PAGE to verify the presence of proteins. Sucrose Density Gradient Centrifugation—The centrifugation was performed using a TLS55 rotor in an Optima TLX ultracentrifuge (Beckman) in 4–20% linear sucrose gradients (2 ml) prepared in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 300 mm NaCl. Samples volume was 100 μl and centrifuged at 45,000 rpm at 4 °C for 14 h. The following proteins with known sedimentation coefficients were used to generate a calibration curve, cytochrome c (1.8 S; 12.4 kDa), bovine serum albumin (4.3 S; 66 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (7.6 S; 150 kDa), and catalase (11.3 S; 232 kDa). Subsequently, the gradient was fractioned and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. DNA Binding Assay—ϕX174 circular ssDNA (virion) (30 μm nucleotides), ϕX174 supercoiled dsDNA (RFI form), nicked dsDNA ϕX174 (RFII form), or ϕX174 linear dsDNA (RFI form XhoI-digested) (15 μm bp) was mixed with Hop2, Mnd1, or Hop2-Mnd1 complex in 30 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm MgCl2. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, and products were resolved at 4 °C in 1% agarose gel electrophoresis in 1× TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate (pH 8) and 1 mm EDTA) run at 9 V/cm for 1.5 h. Finally, the bands were visualized by ethidium bromide staining. When oligonucleotides were used (#3 and #4, 60-mer oligonucleotides and #6 and #7, 100-mer oligonucleotides) the protein was incubated with 25 μm (nucleotides) of 32P-labeled DNA in the following buffer: 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm DTT, 2 mm MgCl2 and 100 mm NaCl in a volume of 20 μl for 10 min at 37 °C. The samples were mixed with 3 μl of loading buffer (30% sucrose, 0.1% bromphenol blue) and analyzed by elecrophoresis in 8% polyacrylamide gels in 1× TAE buffer at 5 V/cm for 5 h. The formation of nucleoprotein complexes was quantitated using a BAS 2500 Bio-imaging Analysis System (Fuji Medical System). DNA Annealing Assay—Annealing of 32P-labeled 100-bp oligonucleotide (#6) and M13 mp18 (+ strand) was performed in a 25-μl reaction volume in the following buffer: 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT and kept at 37 °C during 10 min. The mixture was then treated by addition of stop buffer (1% SDS, 20 mm EDTA, and 1 mg/ml proteinase K) and incubated during 20 min at 37 °C. Products were separated on 1% agarose gels. D-loop Formation—The supercoiled pUC18 plasmid (15 μm bp) and a homologous radiolabeled 57-mer oligonucleotide (3 μm nucleotides) (oligonucleotide #5, see “Experimental Procedures”) were mixed in 20 μl of reaction buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm DTT (1 mm for Hop2-Mnd1/Dmc1) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS (0.5%) and proteinase K (1 mg/ml) followed by 15 min of incubation at 37 °C. Finally, the products were resolved on 1% agarose and analyzed with a BAS 2500 Bio-imaging Analysis System (Fuji Medical System). The amount of D-loop relative to dsDNA was calculated using Equation 1, dsDNA in D-loop=A×100×(Ppiprod,i/Ppitotal,i) (Eq. 1) where Ppiprod,i are pixels per inch of oligonucleotide ssDNA in super-coiled dsDNA (plasmid), Ppitotal,i are the sum of pixels per inch of free oligonucleotide ssDNA and oligonucleotide ssDNA in super-coiled dsDNA, and A is the molar ratio of oligonucleotide ssDNA with respect to dsDNA in the reaction mixture. Surface Plasmon Resonance—Experiments were done on a BIAcore 3000 instrument at 25 °C. The running buffer was 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 200 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 0.005% surfactant P-20. Dmc1 was bound to one flow cell of a CM5 sensor chip, yielding 1500 response units, using the amine coupling kit provided by BIAcore and a additional flow cell was treated in the presence of bovine serum albumin (yielding 1700 response units) to provide a control surface. Hop2-Mnd1, Hop2, Mnd1, or bovine serum albumin at 1 μm concentration was injected over all surfaces of the chip at a flow rate of 10 μl/min for a contact time of 5 min. The surfaces were regenerated after each injection with 70 μl of 3 m NaCl. The resulting curves were normalized to base line, and the control response for each protein injection was subtracted from the responses for the Dmc1-bound surfaces. Mass Spectrometry—Protein samples excised from SDS-PAGE gel were digested in-gel with sequencing-grade modified trypsin (Promega). A 1.2-m matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometer with delayed extraction (Voyager-DE, Perspective Biosystems) was used for measuring free Hop2, Mnd1, and Hop2-Mnd1 complex. The matrix solution was a saturated solution of α-cyano-2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in acetonitrile:water (1:1). Aliquots of 1 μl of protein solution were diluted in 1 μl of the matrix solution, and 0.5 μl of the resulting mixture was spotted in the sample plate. Determination of Protein Concentration—The final yield of Hop2, Mnd1, and Hop2-Mnd1 complex was determined using UV absorbance at 280 nm (ϵHop2: 15,930), (ϵMnd1: 22,190; ϵHop2-Mnd1: 19,060) (Vector NTI Suite, Informax). Purification of Mouse Mnd1 Protein—To characterize the mouse Mnd1 protein, we expressed Mnd1 as a fusion protein with an NH2-terminal hexahistidine tag (His6 tag). Since our attempt to express the protein in the E. coli BL21(DE3) strain resulted in a maximal recovery of less than 10% of Mnd1 in the soluble fraction and the protein was extensively degraded, we refolded Mnd1 from inclusion bodies. The protein was solubilized using 1.8 m GdnHCl, refolded, and further purified as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1A, lane 6). The identity of the protein was confirmed by mass spectroscopy (result not shown) and by Western blot using a polyclonal mouse antiserum raised against Mnd1 (Fig. 1A, lanes 7 and 8). The CD spectrum of Mnd1 shows a characteristic α-helical signature with minima at 208 and 222 nm (Fig. 1B). Denaturation of refolded Mnd1 with 1.8 and 5 m GdnHCl results in a loss of the minima at 208 and 222 nm, indicating disruption of α-helical structures acquired during the refolding process (Fig. 1B). In vitro activity assays, such as DNA binding and DNA annealing demonstrate that the refolded protein is active (Figs. 3, A and B, and 4I, A and B). Most importantly, Mnd1 is able to interact with Hop2 to form a Hop2-Mnd1 complex that can stimulate Dmc1 strand assimilation activity (data not shown). Data obtained from the biophysical characterization of the protein showed that the refolded Mnd1 behaves as a monodisperse protein (see below).FIGURE 3DNA binding activity of Hop2, Mnd1, and Hop2-Mnd1 proteins.

The results show that Hop2 and Mnd1 change their oligomerization state to form the Hop2-Mnd1 complex. We observed that Hop2 forms dimers and tetramers and is strongly affected by protein concentration and ionic strength, Mnd1 for a wide range of concentration behaves as a monomeric protein, and the Hop2-Mnd1 complex forms a stable 1:1 heterodimer (similar results were obtained either by co-expressing Hop2 and Mnd1 or by combining the purified proteins). We have used the values obtained by sedimentation in sucrose gradients and gel filtration to estimate a molecular mass in the range of 55,509–65,013 for Hop2 (dimer), 28,633–36,307 for Mnd1, and 44,992–89,125 for the Hop2-Mnd1 complex. Considering that size chromatography can be strongly affected by the asymmetry of the particle, the higher than expected molecular mass for Hop2-Mnd1 (calculated molecular mass based in primary sequence: 52,980 Da) might indicate an elongated shape for the complex.TABLE 1Summary of molecular mass for Hop2, Mnd1, and the Hop2-Mnd1 complexPhysical propertyHop2Mnd1Hop2-Mnd1Expected molecular mass (His-tagged protein) (Da)26,909 (monomer)26,071 (monomer)52,980 (heterodimer)Molecular mass by mass spectroscopy (Da)26,867 (monomer)25,878 (monomer)50,581 (heterodimer)Weight-averaged molecular mass from chemical crosslink (Da)58,200 (dimer)22,240 (monomer)57,260 (heterodimer)98,638 (tetramer)50,880 (dimer)215,276 (octamer)Weight-averaged molecular mass from sizing chromatography (Da)65,013 (dimer)123,027 (tetramer)36,307 (monomer)89,125 (heterodimer)Hydrodynamic radius from gel filtration, RH3.74 (dimer)2.754.534.68 (tetramer)Sedimentation in density gradients, S3.72.553.25Weight-averaged molecular mass from sedimentation equilibrium (Da)53,000 (dimer)24,260 (monomer)53,550 (heterodimer)104,300 (tetramer)243,740 (polymer)157,450 (heterohexamer)207,500 (octamer) Open table in a new tab Next, we used analytical ultracentrifugation to examine the oligomeric structure of the proteins independent of macromolecular shape. We observed that Hop2 behaves mainly as a mix of dimers and tetramers, Mnd1 has a mass corresponding to that of a monomer, and the Hop2-Mnd1 complex showed a molecular mass corresponding to that of a heterodimer (53.6 kDa) (supplemental Fig. 1). Our biochemical characterization (see below) has been carried out at a range of protein concentrations corresponding to dimer for Hop2, monomer for Mnd1, and heterodimer for the Hop2-Mnd1 complex, indicating that these oligomerization states are the active forms of the proteins. The Hop2-Mnd1 Complex Sediments as a Heterodimer When Bound to ssDNA or dsDNA Molecule—We then studied the oligomerization state of the Hop2-Mnd1 complex in the presence of DNA. Sedimentation equilibrium data collected for single- and double-stranded 60-mer oligonucleotide DNAs are consistent with the presence of a single ideal solute, corresponding to monomeric species for each DNA. Sedimentation equilibrium studies on a 1:4 stoichiometric mixture of 60-mer ssDNA to Hop2-Mnd1 complex were consistent with the presence of more than one species. Analysis in terms of two single ideal solutes results in free ssDNA (56%) and a 1:1 ssDNA/heterodimer (44%). We observed an additional large mass aggregate (3:3 DNA/protein) present at less than 0.03% of the total material (supplemental Fig. 2IB). We note that purification of the ssDNA/Hop2-Mnd1 complex by gel filtration results in a monodisperse solute having a molecular mass consistent with a 1:1 ssDNA/heterodimer complex. Next, we examined a 1:4 stoichiometric mixture of 60-mer dsDNA:Hop2-Mnd1 complex. The results showed that the low mass species observed corresponds to the 1:1 dsDNA/heterodimer complex.

https://openalex.org/W1991517301,"Human skin is a local source of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and expresses CRH and CRH receptors (CRH-R) at mRNA and protein levels. Epidermal melanocytes respond to CRH by induction of cAMP with up-regulation of pro-opiomelanocortin gene expression and subsequent production of adrenocorticotropin hormone. However, the role of CRH/CRH-R in melanocyte biology is complicated by the significant heterogeneity of cutaneous melanocyte subpopulations, from continuously active and UV-responsive melanocytes in epidermis to UV nonresponsive, hair growth cycle-coupled melanogenesis in hair follicles. In the present study we report that normal human scalp hair follicle melanocytes express CRH at the mRNA level. Furthermore, CRH, urocortin and CRH-R 1 and 2 were differentially expressed in follicular melanocytes, fibroblasts, and keratinocytes depending on anatomic location and differentiation status in situ and in vitro. Stimulation of follicular melanocytes with CRH and CRH peptides, modified for selectivity for CRH-R1 and/or CRH-R2, variably induced cell melanogenesis, dendricity, and proliferation. CRH-peptides also stimulated the expression and activity of Tyrosinase, and expression of Tyrosinase-related protein-1 and-2. However, a modified urocortin peptide highly selective for CRH-R2 down-regulated melanocyte differentiation phenotype. This study indicates that CRH peptides can differentially influence hair follicle melanocyte behavior not only via CRH-R1 signaling but also by complex cross-talk between CRH-R1 and CRH-R2."
https://openalex.org/W2012501991,"Mcm10 is a conserved eukaryotic DNA replication factor that is required for S phase progression. Recently, Mcm10 has been shown to interact physically with the DNA polymerase-α (pol-α)·primase complex. We show now that Mcm10 is in a complex with pol-α throughout the cell cycle. In temperature-sensitive mcm10-1 mutants, depletion of Mcm10 results in degradation of the catalytic subunit of pol-α, Cdc17/Pol1, regardless of whether cells are in G1, S, or G2 phase. Importantly, Cdc17 protein levels can be restored upon overexpression of exogenous Mcm10 in mcm10-1 mutants that are grown at the nonpermissive temperature. Moreover, overexpressed Cdc17 that is normally subject to rapid degradation is stabilized by Mcm10 co-overexpression but not by co-overexpression of the B-subunit of pol-α, Pol12. These results are consistent with Mcm10 having a role as a nuclear chaperone for Cdc17. Mutational analysis indicates that a conserved heat-shock protein 10 (Hsp10)-like domain in Mcm10 is required to prevent the degradation of Cdc17. Substitution of a single residue in the Hsp10-like domain of endogenous Mcm10 results in a dramatic reduction of steady-state Cdc17 levels.

Initiation of DNA replication is a strictly regulated process in eukaryotic cells. In order to prepare replication origins for initiation of DNA replication, a prereplicative complex assembles at origins during the G1 phase of the cell cycle (1Diffley J.F.X. Cocker J.H. Dowell S.J. Rowley A. Cell. 1994; 78: 303-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The prereplicative complex is composed of the six-subunit initiator origin recognition complex, Cdc6, Cdt1, and the putative replicative helicase, the minichromosome maintenance 2–7 (Mcm2-7) complex (reviewed in Ref. 2Bell S.P.

Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 7419-7434Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In addition to Pol12, Cdc17/Pol1 also interacts with Pri2, which regulates the primase activity of the catalytic subunit, Pri1 (24Plevani P. Foiani M. Valsasnini P. Badaracco G. Cheriathundam E.

Mcm10 is a conserved eukaryotic DNA replication factor that is essential for S-phase progression, since it serves a critical role in coordinating replication fork assembly (7Ricke R.M. Bielinsky A.K. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 173-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Mcm10 was initially identified in two independent genetic screens in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (26Solomon N.A. Wright M.B. Chang S. Buckley A.M. Dumas L.B. Gaber R.F.

Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Mcm10 regulates the stability of the catalytic subunit of pol-α, Cdc17/Pol1, in budding yeast, but not other pol-α subunits such as Pri2 (7Ricke R.M. Bielinsky A.K. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 173-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). This is of particular interest, given that Cdc17 levels seem to be tightly controlled in the cell. For example, in budding yeast, Cdc17/Pol1 overexpression results in immediate protein degradation, whereas the endogenous protein has a very low protein turnover rate in vivo (35Falconi M.M. Piseri A. Ferrari M. Lucchini G. Plevani P. Foiani M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10519-10523Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The same is true for p180, the mammalian counterpart for Cdc17/Pol1 (36Mizuno T. Ito N. Yokoi M. Kobayashi A. Tamai K. Miyazawa H. Hanaoka F. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 3552-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The observation that overexpressed Cdc17/Pol1 is unstable but endogenous Cdc17/Pol1 is stable promotes a model whereby the catalytic subunit must be associated with a limiting stabilizing cofactor in vivo. Our current hypothesis is that this cofactor is Mcm10. However, the domain in Mcm10 required to stabilize Cdc17/Pol1 is currently unknown.Here, we demonstrate that Mcm10 is indeed required to stabilize Cdc17/Pol1, regardless of whether cells are in the G1, S, or G2 phase of the cell cycle. In an effort to delineate the region in Mcm10 responsible for stabilizing Cdc17/Pol1, we mutated conserved protein domains within Mcm10 to determine which were crucial for regulating Cdc17/Pol1 protein levels. Interestingly, we identified an Hsp10-like domain that contributes to Cdc17/Pol1 stability. Mutation of a single residue within the Hsp10-like domain in Mcm10 results in a reduction of steady-state Cdc17/Pol1 protein levels. Importantly, the Hsp10-like domain within Mcm10 is highly conserved across species, implying that this function of Mcm10 may be evolutionarily conserved.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains and Plasmids—All strains are isogenic derivatives of W303.

Flow cytometry was performed as described (37Tanaka S. Diffley J.F.X. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 198-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Samples were measured using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences).Co-immunoprecipitation—Cells were arrested with α factor, hydroxyurea, or nocodazole. Extracts were prepared using glass beads and chromatin immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, and protease inhibitors) as described (38Cobb J.A. Bjergbaek L. Shimada K. Frei C. Gasser S.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4325-4336Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). For the immunoprecipitations, 4 μg of anti-HA (12CA5; Roche Applied Science) or IgG (Oncogene Research Products) was added to the extract and incubated with shaking at 4 °C for 3 h. Detection of the precipitated proteins was performed using Western blot analysis with anti-Myc (9E11; LabVision Neomarkers) and anti-HA (16B12; Covance) antibodies.Protein Preparation and Western Blot Analysis—Total protein extracts were prepared from cycling or synchronized yeast cultures. Cell pellets were initially washed with 1 ml of TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) and then washed with 1 ml of 20% trichloroacetic acid. The cell pellet was resuspended in 100μl of 20% trichloroacetic acid at room temperature. One volume of acid-washed glass beads was added, and the cell wall was disrupted by continuous vortexing for 2 min at 4 °C. Glass beads were washed once with 1 ml of 20% trichloroacetic acid, and the extract was centrifuged for 10 min at 3,000 rpm at room temperature. The protein pellet was resuspended 100μl of 2× Laemmli buffer (4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 120 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% bromphenol blue). To neutralize the pH, 35–40 μl of 1 m Tris base was added. After boiling for 5 min, the samples were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 2 min. The supernatant was retained and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with anti-HA (16B12; Covance) for HA-tagged proteins and anti-Myc (9E11; LabVision Neomarkers) for Myc-tagged proteins.Co-overexpression of Cdc17, Mcm10 and Pol12—Strains carrying plasmids for exogenous expression of Mcm10, Pol12, or Cdc17 were grown overnight in minimal medium with 2% raffinose. Cdc17-2HA was overexpressed from a galactose-inducible promoter at 30 °C in the presence of 2% galactose, and Mcm10-3HA or Pol12-2HA were co-overexpressed from a copper-inducible promoter in the presence of 10 μm CuSO4. Following 2 h of induction, the cells were pelleted and resuspended in YPD with 10 μm CuSO4. Samples were taken at 0, 15, 30, 60, and 90 min after repression of Cdc17-2HA. Proteins were extracted using the trichloroacetic acid extraction protocol. Cdc17-2HA, Pol12-2HA, and Mcm10-3HA were detected by immunoblotting using anti-HA (16B12) antibodies. Staining of the nitrocellulose membrane with Ponceau S prior to immunoblotting served as a loading control.Construction of the mcm10 Mutants—Mutations within the Hsp10-like domain MCM10 were constructed using QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene). The Hsp10-like domain was altered to encode the following mutations: G261D, G261A, N268D, and N268I. The zinc finger mutant (mcm10-45) was subcloned from pRS315-mcm10-45, a kind gift from M. Lei (39Cook C.R. Kung G. Peterson F.C. Volkman B.F. Lei M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36051-36058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This allele carries mutations within the zinc finger domain, such that 309CX10CX11CX2H335 is altered to 309CX10YX11GX2L335 (39Cook C.R. Kung G. Peterson F.C. Volkman B.F. Lei M. J. Biol.

Plates were incubated for 2–3 days at 30 or 37 °C. To analyze protein expression, log phase cultures were induced with 10 μm CuSO4 for 2 h at 30°C. Protein extracts were prepared using the trichloroacetic acid protocol. Mcm10-3HA was detected by Western blot with anti-HA (16B12) antibodies.RESULTSMcm10 Serves as a Nuclear Chaperone for Cdc17 throughout the Cell Cycle—We recently observed that the degradation of Mcm10 from cycling yeast cells results in the co-depletion of the catalytic subunit of pol-α, Cdc17/Pol1 (hereafter referred to as Cdc17) (7Ricke R.M. Bielinsky A.K. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 173-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). All previous experiments analyzing the stability of Cdc17 were performed either in asynchronously growing or in hydroxyurea (HU)-treated cells. Importantly, since cells accumulate in S phase in the absence of Mcm10 (7Ricke R.M. Bielinsky A.K. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 173-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 27Merchant A.M. Kawasaki Y. Chen Y. Lei M. Tye B.K. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 3261-3271Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), we were unsure if this function of Mcm10 was restricted to S phase or if Mcm10 is required to stabilize Cdc17 throughout the cell cycle. To experimentally address this question, Mcm10 protein was depleted from temperature-sensitive mcm10 mutants arrested in G1, S, or G2 phase of the cell cycle. First, cultures were treated with the respective cell cycle inhibitor (α-factor, HU, or nocodazole) under permissive conditions and then shifted to 37 °C in the continued presence of the inhibitor. Cell cycle arrests were confirmed by monitoring DNA content using flow cytometry (Fig. 1, A and C). In both the mcm10-1 and mcm10-td strains, degradation of Mcm10 resulted in the destabilization of Cdc17 regardless of whether cells were blocked in G1, S, or G2 phase (Fig. 1, B and D). It has been shown previously that the mcm10-1 and mcm10-td temperature-sensitive strains deplete cellular pools of Mcm10 under nonpermissive conditions, albeit through different mechanisms (7Ricke R.M. Bielinsky A.K. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 173-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 34Sawyer S.L. Cheng I.H. Chai W. Tye B.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This indicates that Mcm10 serves to stabilize Cdc17 throughout the cell cycle.To ascertain that the observed effect was specific for Cdc17, we analyzed the stability of the B-subunit of pol-α, Pol12, in the mcm10-1 strain. Whereas shifting cells to the restrictive temperature did not significantly affect Pol12 protein levels, depletion of Mcm10 did affect the phosphorylation status of Pol12 (Fig. 1D). It has been previously reported that Pol12 is phosphorylated as cells progress through the cell cycle (40Foiani M. Liberi G. Lucchini G. Plevani P. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 883-891Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, we observed two forms of Pol12 in cells blocked in S phase with HU, consistent with Pol12 becoming phosphorylated (Fig. 1D). In addition, the entire Pol12 pool was phosphorylated in cells arrested in G2/M phase with nocodazole (Fig. 1D). However, in the absence of Mcm10, the amount of phosphorylated Pol12 decreased in cells blocked in S and G2/M phases. In cells treated with HU, the entire Pol12 pool was dephosphorylated in the absence of Mcm10, whereas in cells treated with nocodazole, about half of the Pol12 pool was dephosphorylated (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, Ferrari et al. (21Ferrari M. Lucchini G. Plevani P. Foiani M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8661-8666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) reported that Pol12 phosphorylation was dependent on pol-α complex formation. Given that Cdc17 stability was severely compromised in the absence of Mcm10, Pol12 dephosphorylation probably occurred in response to Cdc17 degradation. Moreover, we observed that Pol12 was dephosphorylated in cycling cells depleted solely of Cdc17 (see Fig. 3B). Taken together, these data further support the hypothesis that Mcm10 regulates the stability of Cdc17 throughout the cell cycle.FIGURE 3Cdc17 does not regulate Mcm10 protein levels. A, asynchronous cultures of YKL83 (CDC17+, MCM10+, PRI2+), ABy074 (cdc17-td, MCM10+, PRI2+), ABy119 (cdc17-td, MCM10-3HA, PRI2+), and ABy075 (cdc17-td, MCM10+, PRI2-3HA) cells were grown in 2% raffinose (Raff.) at room temperature (RT). Cultures were shifted to 37 °C in the presence of 2% glucose (Gluc.) or 2% galactose (Gal.) for 3 h. Cdc17-td-HA, Mcm10-3HA and Pri2-3HA were detected by Western blot with anti-HA antibodies (16B12). Ponceau S staining served as a loading control. B, asynchronous cultures of ABy038 (CDC17+, POL12-3HA) and ABy052 (cdc17-td, POL12-3HA) cells were grown in 2% raffinose at room temperature. Cultures were shifted to 37 °C in the presence of 2% glucose or 2% galactose for 3 h. Cdc17-td-HA and Pol12-3HA were detected by Western blot with anti-HA antibodies (16B12). Ponceau S staining served as a loading control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Based upon these results, we predicted that Mcm10 should be associated with pol-α·primase in a cell cycle-independent manner. Thus, we monitored the ability of Mcm10 to physically associate with Cdc17 as well as Cdc17-interacting subunits, Pol12 and Pri2, in cells blocked in G1, S, and G2/M phase. Regardless of whether Pri2, Pol12, or Cdc17 was immunoprecipitated, Mcm10 co-precipitated with pol-α, independently of the stage at which the cell cycle was arrested (Fig. 2). These data therefore support a model whereby Mcm10 physically interacts with the complex throughout the cell cycle. Furthermore, we believe that Mcm10 and pol-α·primase associate with each other independently of DNA, since we showed previously that DNase treatment did not interfere with complex formation in S phase extracts (7Ricke R.M. Bielinsky A.K. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 173-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Mcm10 interaction with pol-α·primase is cell cycle-independent. A, ABy003 (CDC17-3HA, MCM10-9MYC) cells were blocked in the cell cycle with α factor (α), HU, or nocodazole (Noc). Whole cell extracts (WCE) were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-HA (12CA5) or IgG. Mcm10-9Myc and Cdc17-3HA were detected by Western blot using anti-Myc (9E11) and anti-HA (16B12) antibodies, respectively. B, ABy070 (PRI2-3HA, MCM10-9MYC) cells were blocked in the cell cycle with α factor, HU, or nocodazole. WCEs were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA or IgG. Mcm10-9Myc and Pri2-3HA were detected by Western blot using anti-Myc or anti-HA antibodies, respectively. C, ABy071 (POL12-3HA, MCM10-9MYC) cells were treated with α factor, HU, or nocodazole. Whole cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA or IgG. Mcm10-9Myc and Pol12-3HA were detected by Western blot using anti-Myc or anti-HA antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cdc17 Does Not Control Mcm10 Protein Levels—The finding that Mcm10 associates with pol-α throughout the cell cycle raised the question of whether Cdc17 was required to maintain Mcm10 protein stability. Therefore, we examined Mcm10 stability in the absence of Cdc17 by constructing a Cdc17 degron strain (cdc17-td). At the restrictive temperature, Cdc17 was efficiently depleted, particularly when Ubr1, the E3 ligase required for N-end rule degradation, was overexpressed on a galactose-inducible promoter (Fig. 3A) (41Dohmen R.J. Wu P. Varshavsky A. Science. 1994; 263: 1273-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 42Labib K. Tercero J.A. Diffley J.F.X. Science. 2000; 288: 1643-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Depletion of Cdc17 in cycling cells did not affect the protein levels of either Mcm10 or the primase regulatory subunit, Pri2 (Fig. 3A). Therefore, it appears that Cdc17 does not control Mcm10 protein levels.Exogenous Overexpression of Mcm10 Restores Cdc17 Levels in the mcm10-1 Mutant—Because Mcm10 was required to stabilize Cdc17, we wished to explore whether we could rescue Cdc17 protein degradation in the temperature-sensitive mcm10-1 mutant by overexpressing exogenous Mcm10 before the cells were shifted to the nonpermissive temperature. To this end, we expressed Mcm10 with three C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tags from a galactose-inducible promoter in a mcm"
https://openalex.org/W2033107200,"The human major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) region encodes a cluster of polymorphic heterodimeric glycoproteins HLA-DR, -DQ, and -DP that functions in antigen presentation. Separated by approximately 44 kb of DNA, the HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQA1 encode MHC-II proteins that function in separate MHC-II heterodimers and are diametrically transcribed. A region of high acetylation located in the intergenic sequences between HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQA1 was discovered and termed XL9. The peak of acetylation coincided with sequences that bound the insulator protein CCCTC-binding factor as determined by chromatin immunoprecipitations and in vitro DNA binding studies. XL9 was also found to be associated with the nuclear matrix. The activity of the XL9 region was examined and found to be a potent enhancer-blocking element. These results suggest that the XL9 region may have evolved to separate the transcriptional units of the HLA-DR and HLA-DQ genes."
https://openalex.org/W1981703621,"Recoverin is a calcium-dependent inhibitor of rhodopsin kinase. It prevents premature phosphorylation of rhodopsin until the opening of cGMP-gated ion channels causes a decrease in intracellular calcium levels, signaling completion of the light response. This calcium depletion causes release of recoverin from rhodopsin kinase, freeing the kinase to phosphorylate rhodopsin and to terminate the light response. Previous studies have shown that recoverin is able to bind to a region at the N terminus of rhodopsin kinase. In this study we map this interaction interface, showing that residues 1-15 of the kinase form the interaction site for recoverin binding. Mutation of hydrophobic residues in this region have the greatest effect on the interaction. The periodic nature of these residues suggests that they lie along one face of an amphipathic helix. We show that this region is essential for recoverin binding, as a catalytically active kinase lacking these residues is unable to bind recoverin. In addition, we show that neither the N-terminal deletion nor the presence of recoverin inhibits the overall catalytic activity of the kinase, as measured by light-independent autophosphorylation. Finally, we observe that a kinase mutant lacking the N-terminal recoverin binding site is unable to phosphorylate light-activated rhodopsin. Taken together, these data support a model in which recoverin prevents rhodopsin phosphorylation by sterically blocking a region of kinase essential for its interaction with rhodopsin, thereby preventing recognition of rhodopsin as a kinase substrate. Recoverin is a calcium-dependent inhibitor of rhodopsin kinase. It prevents premature phosphorylation of rhodopsin until the opening of cGMP-gated ion channels causes a decrease in intracellular calcium levels, signaling completion of the light response. This calcium depletion causes release of recoverin from rhodopsin kinase, freeing the kinase to phosphorylate rhodopsin and to terminate the light response. Previous studies have shown that recoverin is able to bind to a region at the N terminus of rhodopsin kinase. In this study we map this interaction interface, showing that residues 1-15 of the kinase form the interaction site for recoverin binding. Mutation of hydrophobic residues in this region have the greatest effect on the interaction. The periodic nature of these residues suggests that they lie along one face of an amphipathic helix. We show that this region is essential for recoverin binding, as a catalytically active kinase lacking these residues is unable to bind recoverin. In addition, we show that neither the N-terminal deletion nor the presence of recoverin inhibits the overall catalytic activity of the kinase, as measured by light-independent autophosphorylation. Finally, we observe that a kinase mutant lacking the N-terminal recoverin binding site is unable to phosphorylate light-activated rhodopsin. Taken together, these data support a model in which recoverin prevents rhodopsin phosphorylation by sterically blocking a region of kinase essential for its interaction with rhodopsin, thereby preventing recognition of rhodopsin as a kinase substrate. Light-dependent activation of rhodopsin in rod cells initiates a G protein-mediated signaling cascade that hyperpolarises the rod and inhibits glutamate release at its synaptic terminal. Inactivation of rhodopsin is essential for termination of this signaling event and for resetting rod cells to receive future stimuli. The inactivation process depends on phosphorylation of the C terminus of light-activated rhodopsin through the action of rhodopsin kinase (1Chen J. Makino C.L. Peachey N.S. Baylor D.A. Simon M.I. Science. 1995; 267: 374-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 2Chen C.-K. Burns M.E. Spencer M. Niemi G.A. Hurley J.B. Baylor D.A. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad, Sci. U. S.

The subsequent binding of arrestin to this phosphorylated peptide, and to cytoplasmic loops of the receptor, blocks access of the G protein, transducin, and prevents further signaling (3Wilden U. Hall S.W. Kuhn H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1174-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Rhodopsin kinase is one of seven G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) 2The abbreviations used are: GRK, G protein-coupled receptor kinase; RGS, regulator of G protein signaling; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. 2The abbreviations used are: GRK, G protein-coupled receptor kinase; RGS, regulator of G protein signaling; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. (4Penn R.B. Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). These contain a common domain structure for the N-terminal 520 residues and a divergent C-terminal region (5Inglese J. Freedman N.J. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23735-23738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rhodopsin kinase (also known as GRK1) shows many similarities to the more ubiquitous β-adrenergic receptor kinase (GRK2), sharing two major domains, the N-terminal regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) homology domain and the classical bilobal catalytic domain. The two kinases have 34% sequence identity, with 44% identity in the catalytic domain (6Lorenz W. Inglese J. Palczewski K. Onorato J.J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8715-8719Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of GRK2 in complex with G protein subunits, Gβγ, shows the structure of these major domains (7Lodowski D.T. Pitcher J.A. Capel W.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Tesmer J.J.G. Science. 2003; 300: 1256-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The N-terminal RGS homology domain comprises nine α-helices, spanning residues 30-185, and two additional α-helices from the C terminus of the protein (residues 513-547). The N terminus (residues 1-29) was not observed in the crystal structure. The kinase domain (residues 186-512) shows a classic bilobal structure and adopts a slightly “open” conformation characteristic of an inactive protein kinase with a disordered nucleotide gate (7Lodowski D.T. Pitcher J.A. Capel W.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Tesmer J.J.G. Science. 2003; 300: 1256-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Rhodopsin kinase has two major substrates in the rod outer segment: it interacts with and phosphorylates light-activated rhodopsin (8Inglese J. Koch W.J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and undergoes autophosphorylation (9Lee R.H. Brown B.M. Lolley R.N.

A. 1991; 88: 2568-2572Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A series of seven Ser and Thr residues on the C-terminal peptide of light-activated rhodopsin form the substrate (11Palczewski K. Arendt A. McDowell J.H. Hargrave P.H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8764-8770Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, the activity of rhodopsin kinase for isolated peptide substrates derived from this region is around 1000-fold lower than for intact, light-activated receptor (11Palczewski K. Arendt A. McDowell J.H. Hargrave P.H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8764-8770Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In addition, no clear consensus sequence immediately surrounds the phosphorylated residues to provide such high selectivity (11Palczewski K. Arendt A. McDowell J.H. Hargrave P.H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8764-8770Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This suggests that further contacts between kinase and rhodopsin are involved in selection of activated rhodopsin as a substrate. Residues in all three cytoplasmic loops of rhodopsin have been implicated in this interaction (12Kelleher D.J. Johnson G.L. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13650-13659Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This interaction prevents phosphorylation of light-activated rhodopsin (25Chen C.-K. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J.

Polans A.S. Palczewski K. Detwiler P.B. Neuron. 1993; 10: 523-531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 30Erickson M.A. Lagnado L. Zozulya S. Neubert T.A. Stryer L. Baylor D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6474-6479Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), while recoverin deficiency shortens the response (31Makino C.L. Dodd R.L. Chen J. Burns M.E. Roca A.

Kinase is released from recoverin when cGMP-mediated gating of ion channels causes a decrease in intracellular calcium levels (33Kawamura S. Nature. 1993; 362: 855-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). This delays phosphorylation of rhodopsin and inactivation of the signaling process until the light response is complete. In this study, we investigate the mechanism of inhibition of rhodopsin kinase by recoverin. Previous work has shown that recoverin is able to bind to a peptide corresponding to residues 1-25 of rhodopsin kinase (27Levay K. Satpaev D.K. Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. Slepak V.Z. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13650-13659Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Here we show, using a catalytically active truncated kinase, that this N-terminal peptide is necessary for the binding of recoverin. We investigate the role of each residue from this region on recoverin binding and present data suggesting that the N-terminal 15 residues form an amphipathic helix that interacts with recoverin through the nonpolar face. Finally we show that this peptide is not essential for catalytic function of the kinase domain, as measured by autophosphorylation, but is needed for phosphorylation of light-activated rhodopsin. The same effect is seen in the presence of recoverin, with recoverin bound kinase able to undergo autophosphorylation, but not to phosphorylate light-activated rhodopsin. This supports a mechanism in which the N terminus of rhodopsin kinase is essential for recognition of rhodopsin as a substrate and is sterically blocked by recoverin, thereby preventing rhodopsin phosphorylation without altering the catalytic activity of the kinase. Expression and Purification of Recoverin—The recoverin gene (residues 1-202) was amplified by PCR from a bovine retinal cDNA library and inserted into BamHI-XhoI cleaved pGex4T1 (GE Healthcare), generating an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion of recoverin with an intervening thrombin cleavage site. Protein was expressed by transformation into BL21 RIL Codon-Plus cells (Stratagene), growth to an absorbance at 600 nm of 1.0, induction with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and growth overnight at 25 °C. Recoverin was purified by breaking cells in PBS (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl) with 1% Triton X-100 using a French press and pelleting at 125,000 × g. Supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 45 min, washed with 500 ml of PBS with 1% Triton X-100, 1 liter of PBS with 1 m NaCl, and 200 ml of thrombin cleavage buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2). 75 units of thrombin (Sigma) were added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Cleavage efficiency was in excess of 90%. Beads were removed by centrifugation, and the protein was concentrated using a Centricon Plus-20 to a volume of less than 1 ml. Gel filtration on a Superdex 200 gel filtration column, with a buffer containing 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, resulted in a single peak with a molecular weight consistent with a monomer of recoverin. Protein concentration was determined using absorbance at 280 nm and the BCA assay (Pierce). Rhodopsin Kinase Expression, Purification, and Mutagenesis—Residues 1-562 of rhodopsin kinase were amplified by PCR from a bovine retinal cDNA library and inserted into the BamHI site of pBacPAK8 (Clontech). A baculovirus was generated through cotransfection of the plasmid with linearized BaculoGold DNA (Pharmingen) into Sf9 cells (Invitrogen). The virus was plaque-purified and amplified through standard methods (43King L.A. Possee R.D. The Baculovirus Expression System: A Laboratory Guide. Chapman & Hall, London1992Crossref Google Scholar) and expression tested using a rhodopsin kinase 1a/b antibody (Abcam). For large scale expression, Sf9 cells were grown to 2 × 106 cells/ml in TNM-FH medium (Sigma) with 10% fetal bovine serum. Virus was added to a multiplicity of infection of 2.0. Cells were diluted to 1 × 106 cells/ml with fresh medium and incubated for 72 h before harvesting. Rhodopsin kinase was purified using recoverin affinity chromatography and gel filtration. Infected Sf9 were broken using a Dounce homogenizer into purification buffer (20 mm MOPS, 60 mm KCl, 30 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2,1mm CaCl2, pH 7.2) and clarified by centrifugation at 125,000 × g for 30 min. Recoverin resin was prepared by incubating GST-recoverin with glutathione-Sepharose as described above. Recoverin resin was washed with purification buffer and incubated with the supernatant from infected Sf9 cells for 60 min at 4 °C. Beads were washed with purification buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl. Rhodopsin kinase was eluted from the resin by addition of 5 mm EGTA and concentrated using a Centricon Plus-20 to a volume less than 1 ml. Gel filtration on a Superdex 200 gel filtration column, with 1mm CaCl2,50mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, resulted in a single peak with a molecular weight consistent with a monomer of rhodopsin kinase. Protein concentration was determined using absorbance at 280 nm and the BCA assay (Pierce). Expression and Purification of Kinase Mutant 32-562—A truncated rhodopsin kinase gene, consisting of residues 32-562 linked to a C-terminal His6 tag, was generated by PCR and inserted into the BamHI site of pBacPAK8 (Clontech). Baculovirus production and expression were carried out as described above. Protein was purified using Ni2+ affinity, heparin sulfate affinity chromatography, and gel filtration. Infected Sf9 cells were broken using a Dounce homogenizer into PBS with 10 mm imidazole. Supernatant was clarified by centrifugation at 125,000 × g for 30 min and incubated with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin for 60 min. Resin was washed with PBS containing 0.5 m NaCl and 10 mm imidazole. Protein was eluted with PBS containing 200 mm imidazole and desalted using a PD10 column (Amersham Biosciences) into 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0. The sample was loaded onto a heparin sulfate column (Apbiotech) (44Cha K. Bruel C. Ingleses J. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Gel filtration on a Superdex 200 gel filtration column, with 1 mm CaCl2,50mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, resulted in a single peak with a molecular weight consistent with a monomer. Protein concentration was determined using absorbance at 280 nm and the BCA assay (Pierce). Expression and Purification of GST Fusion Proteins—To make GST fusion proteins with an N-terminal GST, genes were inserted into the BamHI-XhoI site of pGex4T-1 (GE Healthcare). To make fusion proteins with rhodopsin kinase peptides attached to the N terminus of GST, residues 1-210 of GST were amplified by PCR from pGex4T-1 and inserted into the NcoI-BamHI site of pET15b (Novagen), generating a construct with an NcoI site at the 5′-end of GST. Inserts encoding rhodopsin kinase peptides were made by annealing synthetic oligonucleotides, generating double-stranded products with single-stranded overhangs to anneal into NcoI cleaved vector. Oligonucleotides were combined, treated with polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs), heated to 100 °C, and cooled at 1 °C per min. The product was gel-purified (Qiagen) and ligated into NcoI cut vector to generate an N-terminal fusion to GST. Proteins were expressed by transformation of the plasmid into BL21 Codon-Plus cells (Stratagene), growth to an absorbance at 600 nm of 1.0, induction with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and growth for 4 h at 30°C. Cells were broken in PBS with 1% Triton X-100 using a French press. Supernatant was clarified by centrifugation at 125,000 × g and incubated with glutathione-Sepharose for 45 min. Resin was washed with PBS with 1% Triton X-100 and PBS with 0.5 m NaCl. Protein was eluted with 50 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and concentrated using a Centricon Plus-20 to a volume of less than 1 ml. Gel filtration on a Superdex 200 gel filtration column, with buffer containing 1 mm CaCl2,50mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, resulted in a single peak with molecular weights consistent with monomers. Protein concentration was determined using absorbance at 280 nm and the BCA assay (Pierce). Phosphorylation Assays—Rod outer segment membranes were produced as in (46Edwards P.C. Li J. Burghammer M. McDowell J.H. Villa C. Hargrave P.A. Schertler G.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 1439-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and were urea-washed by incubation for 15 min in 5 m urea, 5 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and then with 10 mm MgCl2,20mm Tris, pH 7.4. To investigate phosphorylation, rod outer segment membranes with a final rhodopsin concentration of 30 μm were mixed with 5 μm purified rhodopsin kinase and 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (with specific activity of 250 cpm/pmol) in 10 mm MgCl2,20mm Tris, pH 7.4, and incubated in light or dark for 30 min at 25 °C. Reactions were terminated with 2× running buffer (150 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 6% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 4% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue) and samples separated by SDS-PAGE. Radioactive bands were visualized by exposure to SuperRX film (Fuji). Pulldown Experiments—Pulldown experiments were performed using purified proteins and glutathione resin. 25 μlof glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), with capacity of 5 mg of GST per ml, was incubated with 20 μm GST fusion protein and 20 μm interaction partner. Interaction buffer (20 mm MOPS, 60 mm KCl, 30 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2,1mm CaCl2, pH 7.2) was added to a total volume of 100 μl. After incubation for 60 min, resin was pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 2 min and washed twice by resuspension and pelleting with 1-ml interaction buffer with 0.5 m NaCl. Pelleted protein was eluted by incubation with 50 μl of interaction buffer containing 10 mm EGTA and was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining (Pierce). Biacore Analysis—Measurements were performed on a Biacore 2000 instrument with a constant flow rate of 5 μl/min. Channel 1 was blocked as a control channel with 50 mml-cysteine. Purified recoverin was coupled to channel 2 as described in Ref. 34Satpaev D.K. Chen C.-K. Scotti A. Simon M.I. Hurlery J.H. Slepak V.Z. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10256-10262Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar using the thiol coupling protocol recommended by the manufacturer (Biacore). Around 1000 response units of recoverin was immobilized using this procedure. Channels 1 and 2 were equilibrated with HBS-MCP buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2,1mm MgCl2, 0.005% Tween 20). Purified rhodopsin kinase and kinase truncations were concentrated, and buffer was exchanged using PD10 columns (Amersham Biosciences) for HBS-MCP buffer. A dilution series (62.5 nm, 125 nm, 250 nm, 500 nm,1 μm,2 μm,3 μm, 5 μm, and 10 μm) was injected over channels 1 and 2 with the subtraction 2-1 giving the specific binding to recoverin. Data were analyzed using BIAevaluation software to obtain maximum response values. These were plotted against the concentration of kinase using Prism and fitted to a single site binding model, allowing determination of the KD. To analyze binding to GST fusion peptides, anti-GST antibody was immobilized to all channels using the amide coupling protocol as recommended by the manufacturer (Biacore) and washed with HBS-MCP buffer. Antibody was loaded with GST and GST fusion proteins by injection of 120 μlofa5 μg/ml solution of GST fusion in HBS-MCP buffer. Channel 1 was loaded with GST to act as a control, while channels 2-4 were loaded with fusion proteins. The subtractions of responses, 2-1, 3-1, and 4-1 gave specific binding to channels 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Solutions of increasing concentrations of recoverin (10 μm,15 μm,25 μm,35 μm,50 μm, 62.5 μm,75 μm, 100 μm, 150 μm, and 200 μm), buffer exchanged into HBS-MCP, were injected through the channels and difference response recorded. Data were analyzed as above, plotting the maximum response against the concentration of recoverin and fitting to a one-site binding model. For mutants with decreased affinity, extrapolation of data was required to obtain KD measurements. This is reflected in the standard deviation of the measurements reported in Table 1.TABLE 1The effect of mutation of residues 1-15 of rhodopsin kinase on the affinity for recoverinMutationKD for binding to recoverin (±S.D.)Wild type41 ± 2 μMD2A1.7 ± 0.2 mMF3A1.2 ± 0.1 mMG4A490 ± 20 μMS5A840 ± 40 μML6A10 ± 5 mME7A800 ± 40 μMT8A2.0 ± 0.2 mMV9A1.7 ± 0.1 mMV10A1.5 ± 0.1 mMA11R184 ± 6 μMN12A890 ± 50 μMS13A2.7 ± 0.3 mMF15A1.9 ± 0.2 mM Open table in a new tab Recoverin Inhibits Light-dependent Rhodopsin Phosphorylation but Not Light-independent Rhodopsin Kinase Autophosphorylation—To investigate the role of recoverin in the inhibition of rhodopsin kinase we incubated purified kinase with membranes from bovine rod outer segments and [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 (Fig. 1). In the dark a band running at around 65 kDa is observed due to kinase autophosphorylation. This band also occurs when purified rhodopsin kinase is incubated with [γ-32P]ATP (data not shown). In the presence of light, kinase autophosphorylation is unaltered and an additional band at 35 kDa appears, together with higher molecular mass species. Western blotting with an antibody specific to rhodopsin confirmed that both the 35-kDa species and the higher molecular mass specifies correspond to rhodopsin (data not shown), showing that rhodopsin phosphorylation is light-dependent. These experiments were repeated in the presence of 100 μm purified recoverin (Fig. 1). The addition of recoverin had no effect on light-independent kinase autophosphorylation but prevented light-dependent phosphorylation of rhodopsin. This effect was only observed in the presence of calcium, confirming previous observations that calcium is required for the inhibition of light-dependent rhodopsin phosphorylation (25Chen C.-K. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18060-18066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 26Chen C.-K. Hurley J.B. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 404-410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that recoverin does not inhibit the catalytic function of rhodopsin kinase but instead prevents recognition of rhodopsin as a substrate for the kinase, presumably by preventing the interaction between kinase and rhodopsin. Recoverin Binds to the N-terminal Peptide of Rhodopsin Kinase—To characterize the recoverin binding site of rhodopsin kinase we divided the kinase into functional regions. Guided by alignment between rhodopsin kinase and GRK2, four regions were selected: residues 1-32 (disordered in the GRK2 structure), residues 32-184 (the RGS domain), residues 185-522 (the kinase domain), and residues 522-562 (the C terminus). These were expressed in bacteria as fusions to the C terminus of GST and were tested for ability to pellet recoverin. Of these constructs, only GST fusions containing residues 1-32 could cause recoverin to pellet on glutathione resin (Fig. 2A). The exclusive binding of recoverin to these residues of kinase was further investigated by peptide competition experiments. Here, the ability to pellet full-length rhodopsin kinase by a GST-recoverin fusion was studied. In the presence of calcium, GST-recoverin pelleted kinase on glutathione beads (Fig. 2B). The addition of a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 1-32 of rhodopsin kinase prevented this interaction, showing that residues 1-32 of the kinase are sufficient to compete with recoverin for binding to full-length rhodopsin kinase. In addition, rhodopsin kinase was expressed in the absence of the N-terminal 31 residues (32-562). This protein no longer pellets on glutathione resin in the presence of GST-recoverin (Fig. 2C), showing that the N-terminal 31 residues of rhodopsin kinase are essential components of the recoverin binding site. To confirm this observation under equilibrium binding conditions, Biacore measurements were made. Recoverin was coupled via its unique Cys residue (Cys39) (34Satpaev D.K. Chen C.-K. Scotti A. Simon M.I. Hurlery J.H. Slepak V.Z. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10256-10262Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) to a CM5 Biacore chip, while a control channel was reacted with cysteine. Rhodopsin kinase was flowed over the chip and showed clear specific binding to the recoverin immobilized surface. Data showing the response of the Biacore chip to different kinase concentrations fitted to a one site-binding model with a KD of 37 ± 9 μm (Fig. 3). In contrast, 32-562 kinase showed no specific binding to recoverin under these conditions (Fig. 3). Therefore the N-terminal peptide of rhodopsin kinase is essential for recoverin binding at physiologically relevant kinase concentration. Residues 1-15 of Rhodopsin Kinase Form a Putative Amphipathic Helix That Interacts with Recoverin Primarily through the Hydrophobic Surface—To further delineate the recoverin binding site, GST fusions were generated in which peptides from the N terminus of rhodopsin kinase were fused to the N terminus of GST. To determine the extent of the binding site, a series of truncations were generated and used in recoverin pelleting experiments. First, the C terminus of the peptide was truncated, showing that, while residues 1-15 are sufficient to pellet recoverin, residues 1-10 are not sufficient (Fig. 4A). Truncation experiments with N-terminal deletions showed that removal of residues 1-5 also prevented binding (Fig. 4B). Next, GST fusions were made with each residue in 1-15 mutated to Ala. Each of these mutations caused a decrease in the quantity of recoverin in the pellet (Fig. 4C). The extent of this decrease in binding followed a periodic pattern with mutations F3A, L6A, V9A, V10A, S13A, and F15A causing a near complete loss of recoverin pelleting, while other mutations decreased the interaction by a lesser degree. If residues 1-15 of rhodopsin kinase are plotted as a helical wheel representation (Fig. 4D), the residues that cause complete loss of binding (labeled red), with the exception of Phe15, lie on one, predominantly hydrophobic face of the helix. To estimate the affinity of these mutants for recoverin, Biacore measurements were made. Peptide-GST fusions were immobilized to the chip surface through an anti-GST antibody and recombinant GST was attached to the control channel. Increasing concentrations of recoverin were flowed over a cell with immobilized wild type 1-15 GST, and the response could be fitted to a one-site binding model, with a KD of 41 ± 2 μm (Fig. 4E). This compares well with the KD of 37 ± 9 μm for binding of full-length kinase to recoverin, supporting a model in which residues 1-15 of kinase are sufficient for the high affinity interaction between recoverin and kinase. The same experiment was performed for GST fusions containing mutations of the 1-15 peptide from kinase. All mutations tested reduced binding to recoverin (Fig. 4E and Table 1). Data were again fitted to a one-site binding model, with extrapolation to higher concentrations necessary to allow KD estimation for those mutants with dramatically decreased affinities. The smallest effect was the ∼5-fold increase in KD of the A11R mutation, while the largest change was the ∼250-fold increase in KD caused by the L6A mutation. Most mutations increased the KD by 20-65-fold. Once again, a periodic pattern was observed, with large effects from F3A, L6A, V9A, V10A, S13A and F15A. In this case, D2A and T8A mutations also had a significant effect, suggesting that these hydrophilic residues make a significant contribution to the binding interface. The N-terminal Peptide of Rhodopsin Kinase Is Essential for Phosphorylation of Rhodopsin—To study the role of the N-terminal peptide of rhodopsin kinase in phosphorylation of rhodopsin, we investigated incorporation of radiolabeled phosphate into rhodopsin by full-length kinase and by the N-terminal deletion mutant, 32-562. Kinases were incubated with membranes from rod outer segment in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP in the presence or absence of light. Both full-length and 32-562 kinases showed light-independent autophosphorylation, showing the presence of a functional catalytic domain (Fig. 5). However, while full-length kinase phosphorylated rhodopsin in the light, 32-562 showed no rhodopsin phosphorylation (Fig. 5). Therefore the N-terminal peptide is needed for phosphorylation of rhodopsin but is not necessary for catalytic activity of the kinase domain. Indeed, a previous study showed that the E7A point mutation of rhodopsin kinase inhibits phosphorylation of rhodopsin but not phosphorylation of peptide substrates (15Yu Q. Cheng Z. Gan X. Bao G. Li L. Pei G. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1222-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that residues 1-25 of rhodopsin kinase form a binding site for recoverin (27Levay K. Satpaev D.K. Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. Slepak V.Z. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13650-13659Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We have characterized this recoverin binding site and investigated the role of these residues in recoverin binding and rhodopsin phosphorylation. We have shown the high affinity recoverin-kinase interaction to be exclusively mediated through this peptide, as a catalytically active kinase lacking these residues is unable to bind to recoverin. In addition, a peptide corresponding to residues 1-15 of the kinase binds recoverin with an affinity comparable with that for full-length kinase. Finally, we show that this truncated kinase is unable to phosphorylation rhodopsin. These data support a steric model for the function of recoverin in which recoverin prevents rhodopsin phosphorylation by binding to a region of rhodopsin kinase essential for the recognition of rhodopsin as a kinase substrate. Mapping the Interface between Recoverin and Rhodopsin Kinase—We have used pulldown assays and surface plasmon resonance measurements to investigate the binding of recoverin to GST fusion proteins containing the N terminus of rhodopsin kinase. Pulldown experiments show that the first 15 residues of rhodopsin kinase are sufficient for this interaction, and five-residue deletions from either end of this peptide prevent binding. Through mutagenesis studies of this kinase peptide, we show that the interface between the kinase and recoverin is extensive, with all mutations causing a reduction in binding. Moreover, the degree to which binding is inhibited shows a periodic pattern, with mutation of hydrophobic side chains having the greatest effect. This suggests the N-terminal peptide of the kinase to form an amphipathic α-helix with a hydrophobic face generated by residues F3A, L6A, V9A, and V10A. Mutation of residue Leu6, in the center of this face, leads to the greatest loss of recoverin affinity, suggesting that it lies at the core of the interaction interface. A similar binding interaction has been proposed for other recoverin homologues. These proteins, which are members of the neuronal calcium sensor family, include the Kv channel interacting proteins (KChIPs) and frequentin (35Burgoyne R.D. Weiss J.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). KChIP proteins interact directly with the N terminus of Shal-type voltagegated potassium channels to modulate their surface expression and functional properties (36An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattsson K.I. Strassle B.W. Trimmer J.S. Rhodes K.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar, 37Bahring R. Dannenberg J. Peters H.C. Leicher T. Pongs O. Isbrandt D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23888-23894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In a crystal structure of a fusion between the C terminus of KChIP1 and the N-terminal 30 residues of Kv4.2, the N-terminal end of Kv4.2 forms an α-helix, which lies in a deep hydrophobic pocket of KChIP1, interacting primarily through non-polar and aromatic residues that lie along one face of the helix (38Zhou W. Qian Y. Kunjilwar K. Pfaffinger P.J. Choe S. Neuron. 2004; 41: 573-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In addition, frequentin is an neuronal calcium sensor protein that binds to the phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase isoform, Pik1. In this case, hydrophobic residues within a 28-residue peptide from Pik1 (residues 145-172) form an amphipathic helical binding site for frequentin (39Huttner I.G. Strahl T. Osawa M. King D.S. Ames J.B. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48624874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 40Strahl T. Grafelmann B. Dannenberg J. Thorner J. Pongs O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49589-49599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The data presented in this study suggest that the interaction between recoverin and rhodopsin kinase also occurs through the binding of the hydrophobic face of an amphipathic α-helix at the N terminus of rhodopsin kinase to a hydrophobic surface on recoverin. Indeed, a hydrophobic groove is present in the calcium-bound form of recoverin in an equivalent position to the Kv4.2 binding groove of KChIP (20Flaherty K.M. Zozulya S. Stryer L. McKay D.B. Cell. 1993; 75: 709-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) but is not observed in the inactive calcium-free state of recoverin (22Ames J.B. Ishima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1995; 389: 198-202Crossref Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Mutations made around the surface of this groove in the frog recoverin homologue, S-modulin, decrease rhodopsin kinase binding (41Tachibanaki S. Nanda K. Sasaki K. Ozaki K. Kawamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3313-3319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This hydrophobic pocket, and residues that surround it, provide the most likely binding site for rhodopsin kinase. The Mechanism for Inhibition of Rhodopsin Kinase by Recoverin—The binding of recoverin to the N-terminal peptide of rhodopsin kinase suggests a model for its action as an inhibitor of rhodopsin phosphorylation. Neither recoverin nor removal of the recoverin binding site inhibits kinase catalytic activity, as shown by autophosphorylation, but both prevent the phosphorylation of rhodopsin. This suggests that rhodopsin kinase requires residues 1-31 to recognize rhodopsin as a substrate and that recoverin sterically blocks these interactions. Indeed, an antibody that binds to residues 17-34 of rhodopsin kinase (42Palczewski K. Buczylko J. Lebioda L. Crabb J.W. Polans A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6004-6013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) blocks phosphorylation of rhodopsin without affecting phosphorylation of synthetic peptide substrates. It seems likely that this antibody acts in the same way as recoverin, inhibiting rhodopsin phosphorylation by sterically blocking the N terminus of the kinase and preventing recognition of the substrate. These data support a model in which recoverin inhibits rhodopsin kinase through an unusual mechanism. Rather than causing a conformational change in the catalytic site of the kinase, or by occluding access to this site, recoverin acts at a region of the kinase distant from the catalytic domain, blocking part of the protein essential for substrate recognition. Indeed, the G protein-coupled receptor kinases show poor activity and low specificity for peptide substrates while showing considerable specificity and activity toward activated receptors, showing that substrate recognition relies upon extensive contacts between the kinase and activated receptor. The conserved amphipathic helix at the N terminus of the GRKs appears to play a role in this recognition, allowing its occlusion by recoverin to inhibit phosphorylation of light-activated receptor without affecting activity of the catalytic domain of the kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2038142173,"The exact physiological role of NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) in the NF-kappaB activation pathway has not been defined, although it is an upstream kinase of IKKalpha. Recent studies have indicated that IKKalpha is a nucleosomal modifier of NF-kappaB signaling. We hypothesized that NIK generates a proximal signal that contributes to IKKalpha modification of nucleosomal structure through phosphorylation of histone H3 and enhancement of target gene expression. By using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, our data show that endogenous IKKalpha is recruited to the promoter site of several NF-kappaB-dependent genes in macrophages. Our data show that immunoreactive NIK is rapidly recruited to nuclear compartment in macrophages in response to treatment with endotoxin where it augments phosphorylation of histone H3 by inducing phosphorylation and kinase activity of IKKalpha. A small interfering RNA knockdown of NIK markedly reduces phosphorylation of histone H3 in endotoxin treated macrophages. These data, together, demonstrate a novel role for NIK as a histone H3 modifier, through an accessory pathway from NIK to IKKalpha, that could play an important role in the endotoxin response through modification of nucleosomal structure."

https://openalex.org/W2003329736,"The RecR protein forms complexes with RecF or RecO that direct the specific loading of RecA onto gapped DNA. However, the binding sites of RecF and RecO on RecR have yet to be identified. In this study, a Thermus thermophilus RecR dimer model was constructed by NMR analysis and homology modeling. NMR titration analysis suggested that the hairpin region of the helix-hairpin-helix motif in the cavity of the RecR dimer is a binding site for double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and that the acidic cluster region of the Toprim domain is a RecO binding site. Mutations of Glu-84, Asp-88, and Glu-144 residues comprising that acidic cluster were generated. The E144A and E84A mutations decreased the binding affinity for RecO, but the D88A did not. Interestingly, the binding ability to RecF was abolished by E144A, suggesting that the region surrounding the RecR Glu-144 residue could be a binding site not only for RecO but also for RecF. Furthermore, RecR and RecF formed a 4:2 heterohexamer in solution that was unaffected by adding RecO, indicating a preference by RecR for RecF over RecO. The RecFR complex is considered to be involved in the recognition of the dsDNA-ssDNA junction, whereas RecO binds single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and ssDNA-binding protein. Thus, the RecR Toprim domain may contribute to the RecO interaction with RecFR complexes at the dsDNA-ssDNA junction site during recombinational DNA repair mediated by the RecFOR. The RecR protein forms complexes with RecF or RecO that direct the specific loading of RecA onto gapped DNA. However, the binding sites of RecF and RecO on RecR have yet to be identified.

Thus, the RecR Toprim domain may contribute to the RecO interaction with RecFR complexes at the dsDNA-ssDNA junction site during recombinational DNA repair mediated by the RecFOR. Maintaining genomic integrity by repairing damaged DNA is crucial for all organisms. DNA damage can arise during normal DNA metabolism such as the introduction of mismatches during replication and the deamination of bases, or it can be caused by exposure to exogenous factors such as ultraviolet radiation, γ-radiation, and chemical mutagens. Such DNA damage is mostly repaired by base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, and mismatch repair pathways, based on information provided by the complementary strand in a damaged duplex. However, double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) 2The abbreviations used are: dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; SSB, single-stranded DNA-binding protein; HhH, helix-hairpin-helix; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy. break and base lesions in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) gap regions having no complementary strands can also arise, mainly during replication. To cope with this category of DNA damage, organisms have developed recombinational repair pathways that minimize the loss of genetic information by using homologous DNA as a template for repair. RecFOR and/or RecBCD pathways are required to initiate homologous DNA recombination in bacteria (1Rocha E.P. Cornet E. Michel B. PLoS Genet. 2005; 1: e15Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The Escherichia coli RecFOR pathway is mainly used for ssDNA gap repair, whereas the RecBCD pathway is responsible for dsDNA break repair. However, the RecFOR pathway can also repair dsDNA breaks, as has been demonstrated in recBC sbcB mutants, which are deficient in the RecBCD pathway (2Kushner S.R. Nagaishi H. Templin A. Clark A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 824-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 3Lloyd R.G. Buckman C. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 836-844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the RecFOR pathway, dsDNA breaks are unwound by the RecQ helicase and processed by the RecJ 5′- to 3′-exonuclease, and the resulting 3′-tailed ssDNA is coated with the ssDNA-binding protein (SSB). The RecF, RecO, and RecR proteins then mediate the loading of RecA protein onto the SSB-coated ssDNA, specifically at junctions with dsDNA (4Morimatsu K. Kowalczykowski S.C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1337-1347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Afterward, RecA forms a nucleoprotein filament on ssDNA that interacts with free homologous dsDNA to promote heteroduplex formation between the ssDNA and the complementary strand of the dsDNA (5Shibata T.

The human tumor suppressor protein BRCA2 homologue Brh2 directs homologous recombination specifically to the dsDNA-ssDNA junction, suggesting a functional similarity between the RecFOR and BRCA2 proteins (8Yang H.

Moreover, Rad52 proteins in human and yeast, which are functional homologues of RecO, facilitate the binding of the eukaryotic RecA homologue Rad51 to ssDNA coated with the eukaryotic SSB homologue RPA (10Kagawa W.

Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 566-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). E. coli RecF, RecO, and RecR proteins are well studied. The RecR protein plays a critical role in recombinational DNA repair by forming complexes with RecO or RecF (13Shan Q. Bork J.M. Webb B.L. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 519-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 14Webb B.L. Cox M.M. Inman R.B.

Chem. 1994; 269: 30005-30013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The RecOR complex facilitates RecA filament formation on SSB-coated ssDNA and prevents the dissociation of RecA from ssDNA ends (16Bork J.M. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7313-7322Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The RecFR complex binds dsDNA and attenuates the extension of RecA filaments beyond the region of ssDNA in the gapped DNA (14Webb B.L. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. Cell. 1997; 91: 347-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In addition, the RecFR complex is required for reassembly of the replication holoenzyme after recombinational DNA repair at replication forks (17Courcelle J. Carswell-Crumpton C. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3714-3719Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 18Courcelle J. Crowley D.J. Hanawalt P.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 916-922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The RecF protein itself binds DNA and has a weak ATPase activity (19Madiraju M.V. Clark A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7705-7710Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), both of which are enhanced by RecR binding (20Webb B.L. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 15367-15374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Furthermore, specific loading of the RecA protein onto the dsDNA-ssDNA junction is mediated by the RecF, RecO, and RecR proteins acting in concert, with no interaction between RecF and RecO detected (4Morimatsu K. Kowalczykowski S.C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1337-1347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Therefore, RecR is thought to be the key mediator of RecF and RecO association at dsDNA-ssDNA junctions. The crystal structure of Deinococcus radiodurans RecR (drRecR) was recently determined (22Lee B.I. Kim K.H. Park S.J. Eom S.H. Song H.K. Suh S.W. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2029-2038Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). As predicted from sequence analysis, drRecR consists of a helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) motif, a zinc finger motif, a Toprim domain, and a Walker B motif. drRecR forms a ring-like tetramer, and it has been suggested that the HhH motifs in the central hole are important for DNA binding. However, the RecR binding sites for the RecO and RecF have not been identified. In addition, E. coli RecR has been reported to form a dimer in solution (15Umezu K. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30005-30013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Webb B.L. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31397-31404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and its structural conformation has not been determined. Previously, we reported the backbone NMR assignments of Thermus thermophilus RecR (ttRecR) and suggested that it forms a symmetric homodimer in solution (23Honda M. Rajesh S. Nietlispach D. Mikawa T. Shibata T. Ito Y. J. Biomol. NMR. 2004; 28: 199-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Here, we have constructed a dimer model of ttRecR and have analyzed its specific interactions with DNA, RecO, and RecF. We have also discussed the role of RecR in recombinational DNA repair based on these protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. Protein Expression and Purification—Unlabeled and uniformly 2H/15N- or 15N-labeled T. thermophilus HB8 RecR and RecA (ttRecA) proteins were prepared as previously described (23Honda M. Rajesh S. Nietlispach D. Mikawa T. Shibata T. Ito Y. J. Biomol. NMR. 2004; 28: 199-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 24Shigemori Y. Mikawa T. Shibata T. Oishi M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: e126Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). RecO (ttRecO), RecF (ttRecF), and SSB (ttSSB) proteins were prepared as described below. Each gene was amplified by PCR and cloned in an expression vector with a T7 promoter. Sequences were confirmed and proteins overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)/pLysS cells. Proteins were purified from cell extracts by heat treatment and column chromatography as follows: ttRecO, SP-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences), TOYOPEARL Phenyl-650S (TOSOH), Superdex 75 10/300 GL (Amersham Biosciences), and RESOURCE S 6 ml (Amersham Biosciences); ttRecF, SP-Sepharose Fast Flow and Superdex 200 10/300 GL (Amersham Biosciences); and ttSSB, Heparin-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences), TOYOPEARL Butyl-650S (TOSOH), and RESOURCE Q 6 ml. Purified proteins were confirmed by N-terminal sequence analysis and mass spectrometry. Preparation of ttRecR Mutants—The genes encoding the deletion mutants ttRecR75–194 and ttRecR1–173 were amplified by PCR and cloned into the vector pET-28a (Novagen) after sequence confirmation. The N-terminal His-tagged ttRecR75–194 and ttRecR1–173 were overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified from cell extracts with the Magtration System 6GC (PSS Bio Instruments, Inc.) and Superdex 75 10/300 GL. To prepare the ttRecR E84A, D88A, and E144A mutants, point mutations were incorporated into the ttRecR expression plasmid using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and were confirmed by sequencing. The ttRecR mutants were expressed and purified using the same methods as for wild-type ttRecR. Ultracentrifugation Analysis—Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed in a Beckman Optima XL-A equipped with a four-hole rotor (An60Ti) with six channel standard cells at 15,000 rpm for ttRecR and 7,000 rpm for the ttRecFR complex for 13 h at 20 °C. The ttRecR and ttRecFR complex were dissolved to 1, 2, or 4 mg/ml in buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl). For molecular mass analysis, the data obtained were tailored to an ideal, single-component model using a solution density of 1.05 g/cm3 and partial specific volume of 0.71 cm3/g for ttRecR and 0.68 cm3/g for the ttRecFR complex. Size-exclusion Chromatography—T. thermophilus RecF (30 μm), RecR (100 μm), RecO (50 μm), RecF (50 μm)+ RecR (100 μm), or RecF (30 μm) + RecR (60 μm) + RecO (30 μm) in buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl) were applied to a Superdex-200 HR 10/300 column (Pharmacia) and eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min in the same buffer. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR experiments were performed at 313 K in a triple resonance cryoprobe fitted with a Z-axis pulsed field gradient coil using a 600 MHz Bruker DRX spectrometer. Data were processed on a Linux PC using the AZARA 2.7 software package (W. Boucher, www-.bio.cam.ac.uk/azara/). All spectra were analyzed on a Linux PC with a combination of customized macro-programs in the OpenGL version of ANSIG v3.3 software (25Kraulis P.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1989; 84: 627-633Google Scholar). For processing three-dimensional NMR data, a two-dimensional maximum entropy algorithm was applied for indirect dimensions (26Laue E.D. Mayger M.R. Skilling J. Staunton J. J. Magn. Reson. 1986; 68: 14-29Google Scholar). Peak assignments for ttRecR spectra were obtained by transfer from previously described data (23Honda M. Rajesh S. Nietlispach D. Mikawa T. Shibata T. Ito Y. J. Biomol. NMR. 2004; 28: 199-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Hydrogen/Deuterium Exchange and Three-dimensional NOESY NMR Experiments—2H/15N-labeled ttRecR (0.4 mm) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, and 1 mm EDTA was lyophilized and dissolved in D2O (99.96%). Immediately after the addition of D2O, protection of amide protons against deuterium was identified by analyzing a series of two-dimensional 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra. The distance constraints around ttRecR residues 170–194 were determined by analysis of the nuclear Overhauser effect from three-dimensional 15N-separated nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY)-HSQC spectrum (27Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. 1986; (pp. , John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York): 117-129Google Scholar). Titration Analysis—NMR samples of 15N-labeled ttRecR were prepared at 0.4 mm in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm KCl, and 1 mm EDTA. Unlabeled protein and DNA were directly added into the sample from a concentrated stock to prevent changes in concentration and pH. For DNA titration experiments, chemical shift mapping was performed by recording the chemical shift of each peak before and after adding DNA to 1.6 mm. The chemical shift change (Δav) was calculated and normalized using the following formula: [(Δ1HN) 2 + (Δ15N) 2]1/2, where Δ1HN and Δ15N are the chemical shift differences (Hz) along the 1H and 15N axes, respectively (28Rajesh S. Sakamoto T. Iwamoto-Sugai M. Shibata T. Kohno T. Ito Y. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9242-9253Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For titration experiments with ttRecO, 0.05, 0.1, or 0.2 mm ttRecO were added into 0.2 mm 15N-labeled ttRecR. The relative intensity of HSQC signals in the presence of 0.2 mm ttRecO (64 scans/free induction decay) or in its absence (16 scans/free induction decay) were plotted against the number of amino acids and mapped onto the ttRecR dimer structure. Structure Modeling—A structural model of ttRecR dimer was generated with MODELLER version 7.7, a comparative homology modeling software (29Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10616) Google Scholar). For homology modeling calculations, the drRecR structure was obtained from the Protein Data Bank, 1VDD (22Lee B.I. Kim K.H. Park S.J. Eom S.H. Song H.K. Suh S.W. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2029-2038Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The integrity and quality of the models were assessed using the program PRO-CHECK, which generates Ramachandran plot of model structure. The molecular diagrams were depicted using PyMOL. Native PAGE Analysis—Wild-type or mutant ttRecR (10 μm) and wild-type ttRecO (0, 2, and 10 μm) or ttRecF (0, 2, and 10 μm) were incubated in 30 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, and 1 mm EDTA. After 15 min of incubation at 37 °C, samples were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 12.5% gels under non-denaturing conditions at 4 °C. ATP Hydrolysis Assays—The ssDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis activity of ttRecA in the presence of ttRecF pathway proteins was measured as described by Bork et al. (16Bork J.M. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7313-7322Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The ssDNA was first incubated with SSB in 190 μl of the following buffer: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 8 unit/ml of pyruvate kinase, 13 units/ml of lactate dehydrogenase, 1 mm ATP, and 250 μm NADH at 37 °C for 5 min. 10 μl of the ttRecO and ttRecR mixture were added to the SSB-ssDNA solution and incubated for 10 min before ttRecA was added to initiate the ssDNA-dependent ATPase reaction. The standard reaction included 20 μm (with respect to nucleotides) ssDNA, 1 μm ttRecA, 1 μm ttSSB, 1 μm ttRecR, and 1 μm ttRecO. The kinetics of ATP hydrolysis was followed by measuring the absorption of NADH at 340 nm using an Ultrospec 4300 pro spectrometer (Amersham Biosciences). Agarose Gel Retardation Assay—The DNA-ttRecFR complex formation was detected using an agarose gel assay according to the protocol described by Webb et al. (20Webb B.L. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31397-31404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Each substrate DNA was incubated with wild-type or mutant ttRecR (5 μm) and ttRecF (10 μm) in 20 μl of reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm EDTA at 37 °C for 10 min. Samples were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 3% agarose gel in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris-acetate, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). DNA and DNA-protein complexes were visualized by Gel Star (Cambrex Bio Science). CD Spectroscopy—Circular dichroism (CD) measurements were carried out on a Jasco spectropolarimeter, model J720-W. Prediction of ttRecR Dimer Structure by Homology Modeling—To clarify the biophysical and structural properties of ttRecR, we initially examined its oligomeric state using analytical ultracentrifugation (Fig. 1A). At a ttRecR concentration of 1 mg/ml (47 μm), the molecular mass was calculated to be 48,448 Da, which corresponds to the mass of the ttRecR dimer. Using size-exclusion chromatography, we confirmed that ttRecR exists as a dimer from 1 μm to 1 mm of the protein concentrations. Because the ttRecR concentration (1 μm) was diluted (below 50 nm) during chromatography, these results suggest that ttRecR exists as a dimer at a broad range of concentrations (data not shown). In contrast, the crystallized drRecR formed a ring-like tetramer in which N-terminal HhH motifs (1–53 residues) contacted with each other and C-terminal regions (175–198 residues) swapped as described in Fig. 1B (22Lee B.I. Kim K.H. Park S.J. Eom S.H. Song H.K. Suh S.W. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2029-2038Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To investigate the dimerization interface of the ttRecR dimer, we used NMR to perform a proton/deuterium (H/D) exchange experiment, which can identify residues exposed on the protein surface by detecting the exchange of observable amide protons for non-observable deuterium (30Olofsson A. Ippel J.H. Wijmenga S.S. Lundgren E. Ohman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5699-5707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 31Englander S.W. Sosnick T.R. Englander J.J. Mayne L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 18-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The panels in Fig. 1C show the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of the ttRecR dimer at 15 min, 4 h, and 24 h after the sample was lyophilized and dissolved in D2O. Each peak in the panels corresponds to an amide proton from a ttRecR amino acid residue. Amide proton signals were lost due to H/D exchange in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1C). However, even after 4 h of exposure to D2O, approximately one-third of the amide protons were protected from deuterium exchange, suggesting that these protons are not on the ttRecR dimer surface. Because ttRecR and drRecR amino acid sequences share 57% identity and 74% homology and because the secondary structure of the RecR dimer that was previously determined based on our NMR assignments was identical to that of the drRecR crystal structure (supplemental Fig. S1), the monomeric structures of ttRecR and drRecR are thought to be quite similar despite the differences in their oligomeric states. Therefore, we next sought to explore the interface of the ttRecR dimer by mapping non-exchange ttRecR amide protons to corresponding drRecR regions. When these amide protons were mapped onto the drRecR monomer structure (Fig. 1D, left panel, red spheres), seven residues with protected amide protons were observed at the protein surface: Leu-17, Gly-21, Glu-41, His-55, Ile-59, Gly-83, and Gly-89. With the exception of Gly-83 and Ile-59, these residues are located near the HhH motif, making it plausible that this region is responsible for RecR dimerization (Fig. 1D, right panel). To confirm the above idea, we prepared two ttRecR mutants, ttRecR75–194, in which the N-terminal HhH motif had been truncated, and ttRecR1–173, in which the C-terminal region corresponding to the C-terminal swapping region of drRecR had been truncated. Using circular dichroism spectroscopy (supplemental Fig. S2), we confirmed that these mutant proteins are not unfolding. Then, we examined their oligomeric state using size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. 1E). ttRecR (21.2 kDa) and ttRecR1–173 (19.2 kDa) were eluted at positions corresponding to 48.5 and 44.6 kDa, respectively, showing that they form dimers. In contrast, ttRecR75–194 (15.3 kDa) was eluted at a position corresponding to 18.2 kDa, showing that it exists as a monomer. These results indicate that the N-terminal region (1–74), and not the C-terminal region (174–194), is responsible for ttRecR dimerization. Although the ttRecR C-terminal region (174–194) was not the interface of the ttRecR dimer, the secondary structure of the C-terminal regions was conserved in both ttRecR and drRecR (supplemental Fig. S1). To examine the local conformation of the C-terminal region of the ttRecR dimer, we subsequently carried out 15N-separated three-dimensional NOESY-HSQC experiments on 2H/15N-labeled ttRecR. Cross-peaks due to nuclear Overhauser effect were observed between amide protons of the 192/165, 194/165, and 164/163 residue pairs, indicating that these proton pairs are located within a region of ∼5 Å. These results suggest that residues 192–194 of ttRecR form an anti-parallel β-sheet with residues 163–165 (Fig. 1F). In the case of drRecR, the corresponding β-sheet is formed between two RecR molecules (Fig. 1B, C-terminal swapping region). Because the C-terminal regions of the ttRecR dimer did not form an interface, we concluded that the ttRecR C-terminal regions fold back to their own subunit and have a similar structure to that of drRecR. We employed two drRecR monomers capable of interfacing with each other via the N-terminal HhH motif (Fig. 1B, blue and green subunits). Then, the C-terminal swapping regions of residues 173–196 were replaced by the same region of subunits, which are colored in red and yellow, respectively, in Fig. 1B. We used this structure as a template for homology modeling of the ttRecR dimer. The homology modeling was performed using the MODELLER program with the experimentally determined secondary structure of ttRecR (23Honda M. Rajesh S. Nietlispach D. Mikawa T. Shibata T. Ito Y. J. Biomol. NMR. 2004; 28: 199-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) as an additional constraint. Finally, a dependable ttRecR dimer model was constructed (Fig. 1G). The root mean square deviation of Cα between the derived ttRecR structure and the template structure was 0.38 Å. The RecR dimer model was divided into three regions (Fig. 1G): 1) Residues 1–52, termed the HhH motif region after the HhH motif (residues 5–34) it contains; 2) Residues 53–76, termed the zinc finger region after the zinc finger motif (residues 55–75) it contains; and 3) Residues 77–194, termed the Toprim domain region and comprised of the Toprim domain (residues 77–164) and the Walker-B motif (residues 165–180). Unless otherwise stated, the designations RecR, RecO, RecF, RecA, and SSB refer to the T. thermophilus proteins after this section. Chemical Shift Mapping of DNA Binding Sites onto the RecR Dimer—We sought to determine whether the RecR dimer interacts with DNA and to identify its DNA binding sites. In this assay, we added unlabeled DNA substrates to 15N-labeled RecR protein and compared the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of RecR alone (black) with that in the presence of DNA (green). Fig. 2A shows the superimposed patterns of the two spectra for 15N-labeled RecR in the absence or presence of 15 bp dsDNA (upper panel) and in the absence or presence of 15 mer ssDNA (lower panel). Because each 1H-15N cross peak in the two panels is derived from the amide proton of a RecR amino acid as described in Fig. 1C, the amino acids corresponding to the cross-peaks affected by the addition of DNA can be presumed to be involved in DNA binding. To examine the amino acid residues involved in DNA binding, we expressed the data shown in Fig. 2A as a change in chemical shift/residue (Fig. 3A, left panels). Major chemical shift changes of residues >20 Hz were observed for the Gly-21, Gly-19, and Ala-25 with 53, 41, and 20 Hz, respectively (Fig. 2A, upper panel, and Fig. 3A, upper left panel). In contrast, when ssDNA was added to RecR, no major changes in chemical shift were observed (Fig. 2A, lower panel, and Fig. 3A, lower left panel).FIGURE 3Analysis of RecR interaction with DNA in the presence or absence of Mg2+. Chemical shift changes for RecR after addition of various DNA substrates were plotted against residue number. A schematic of the RecR domain structure aligned with the residue number is also shown. DNA substrates are as follows: dsDNA, d(CCGGTGATAGACTTG)/(CAAGTCTATCACCGG); ssDNA, d(CAAGTC-TATCACCGG); 3′-tailed DNA, d(CCGGTGATAGACTTGAGCTAAC)/(CAAGTCTATCACCGG); and 5′-tailed DNA, d(CCGGTGATAGACTTG)/(GTTAGCTCAAGTCTATCACCGG). DNA was added from a concentrated stock to 15N-labeled RecR in the absence (A) or presence (B) of 40 mm MgCl2. Data for overlapping cross-peaks and proline residues were excluded from the plots.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then color coded the amino acid residues that exhibited a change in chemical shift >20 Hz as red and those that exhibited a change between 5 and 20 Hz as yellow and mapped them onto the molecular surface of the RecR dimer (Fig. 2B). The result shows that the two Gly-19 and two Gly-21 residues showing high levels of chemical shift changes gather on the interface between the two HhH motifs of the RecR dimer, forming a patch with other residues whose chemical shifts are highly affected by the addition of dsDNA. As shown in Fig. 2, B and C, residues Gly-19 and Gly-21 correspond to the hairpin region of the HhH motif, which is located at the center of the inner surface of the RecR dimer. In addition, two Tyr-178 residues in the Toprim domain are situated in the RecR inner surface, forming a cavity with the hairpin region that can accommodate dsDNA. These results suggest that RecR binds dsDNA in this cavity via Gly-19 and Gly-21 of the HhH motif of the RecR dimer (Fig. 2C, circled area). The Toprim domains of topoisomerase or primase have an acidic cluster region that catalyzes nucleotidyl transferase activity in an Mg2+-dependent manner. Because RecR also has a Toprim domain, it has been speculated that it recognizes specific features of damaged DNA via a similar mechanism (33Kato M. Ito T. Wagner G. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1349-1360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Therefore, we further investigated RecR-DNA interactions using 3′-tailed and 5′-tailed DNA substrates possessing a base-paired 5′ or 3′ terminus at junction, respectively, in the presence or absence of Mg2+. As shown in Fig. 3, RecR did not show major chemical shifts at the Toprim domain region, either in the absence (Fig. 3A) or the presence (Fig. 3B) of the Mg2+ ion. These results suggest that the role of the Toprim domain o"
https://openalex.org/W2076712649,"The proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is a homotrimeric ring-shaped protein that, by encircling DNA, may function as a sliding platform for proteins participating in various DNA transactions. PCNA plays a fundamental role in DNA replication and repair, but also in postreplicative events, like DNA methylation, chromatin assembly and remodeling, sister chromatid cohesion, and coordinates these activities with cell cycle control. However, relevant aspects of PCNA function are still not well understood, like the role of PCNA in the association with partner proteins, and how multiple protein interactions are orchestrated. Based on emerging evidence, I suggest that 1) PCNA interacting proteins may be reclassified in three major categories, namely, a) cell cycle control; b) DNA replication/repair; c) chromatin regulation/transcription. 2) PCNA is a negative regulator, rather than a processivity/recruitment factor, of chromatin-modifying enzymes. 3) At DNA replication sites, PCNA function may be envisaged with a model of ""dynamic hand-off"" of interacting partners that rapidly and transiently exchange in a mutually exclusive manner, while cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) 2 (CDK2) is stably bound to PCNA. The partner exchange might occur through a conformational change of the PCNA/protein/DNA complex allowing CDK2 to phosphorylate the partner protein, thereby enabling its hand-off from PCNA."

DNA polymerase λ, a recently identified X-family homolog of DNA polymerase β, is hypothesized to be a second polymerase involved in base-excision repair. The full-length DNA polymerase λ is comprised of three domains: a C-terminal DNA polymerase β-like domain, an N-terminal BRCA1 C-terminal domain, and a previously uncharacterized proline-rich domain. Strikingly, pre-steady-state kinetic analyses reveal that, although human DNA polymerase λ has almost identical fidelity to human DNA polymerase β, the C-terminal DNA polymerase β-like domain alone displays a dramatic, up to 100-fold loss in fidelity. We further demonstrate that the non-enzymatic proline-rich domain confers the increase in fidelity of DNA polymerase λ by significantly lowering incorporation rate constants of incorrect nucleotides. Our studies illustrate a novel mechanism, in which the DNA polymerase fidelity is controlled not by an accessory protein or a proofreading exonuclease domain but by an internal regulatory domain.

The fidelity of polλ when filling medium to large gaps has been estimated to be in the range of 10–4 by both forward and reverse mutation assays (8Garcia-Diaz M. Bebenek K. Sabariegos R. Dominguez O. Rodriguez J. Kirchhoff T. Garcia-Palomero E. Picher A.J. Juarez R. Ruiz J.F. Kunkel T.A. Blanco L. J. Biol.

But the fidelity of the full-length polλ when filling single-nucleotide-gapped DNA, which is relevant to BER, has not been determined. Previously, we measured the base substitution fidelity for filling single-nucleotide-gapped DNA catalyzed by human tpolλ and found it to be in the range of 10–2–10–4, which is relatively low when compared with polβ (15Fiala K.A. Abdel-Gawad W. Suo Z. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6751-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, the presence of the N-terminal BRCT and proline-rich domains may have significant effects on the fidelity of polλ. Here, we use pre-steady-state kinetic methods to determine the base substitution fidelity of human fpolλ and its N-terminal domain truncation fragments (see Fig. 1), based on all possible dNTP incorporations into single-nucleotide gapped DNA. Any difference in the fidelity between the full-length and the truncated polλ fragments will reveal the role of the BRCT and proline-rich domains in polymerization efficiency and fidelity. Our kinetic results strongly support a role for polλ as the second polymerase in BER. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of fpolλ, dpolλ, and tpolλ—Preparation of tpolλ fused to a C-terminal His6 tag (38.2 kDa) was described previously (15Fiala K.A. Abdel-Gawad W. Suo Z. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6751-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The human genes encoding fpolλ and dpolλ (Fig. 1) were PCR-amplified and separately inserted into the NdeI/XhoI sites of pET28b and pET24b to construct pET28b-fpolλ and pET24b-dpolλ. A stop codon was engineered before the XhoI site of pET28b-fpolλ. The constructed plasmids were individually transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL competent cells (Stratagene) to express fpolλ fused to both an N-terminal and a C-terminal hexahistidine tag, and dpolλ fused to a C-terminal hexahistidine tag. Both fpolλ (65.6 kDa) and dpolλ (50.1 kDa) were overexpressed in these transformed E. coli cells as was tpolλ (15Fiala K.A. Abdel-Gawad W. Suo Z. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6751-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). fpolλ was purified through a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen), a heparin-Sepharose Fast Flow column (GE Healthcare), a DEAE-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare), and a Mono-S 10/10 column (GE Healthcare). dpolλ was purified through a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen), a heparin-Sepharose Fast Flow column, a DEAE-Sepharose column, and a HiTrap Q column (GE Healthcare). The His6 tags of purified fpolλ and dpolλ were detected by Western blot analysis using anti-hexahistidine tag antibody (data not shown). The concentrations of the purified fpolλ and dpolλ were measured spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using the calculated extinction coefficients of 61,615 and 48,204 m–1cm–1, respectively. Synthetic Oligodeoxyribonucleotides—The oligodeoxyribonucleotides in Fig. 2 were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies and purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (18% acrylamide, 8 m urea). Their concentrations were determined by UV absorbance at 260 nm with calculated extinction coefficients. The 21-mer was 5′-end-labeled by using Optikinase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and subsequently purified using a Biospin column (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Each single-nucleotide-gapped DNA substrate was prepared by heating a mixture of 21-mer, 19-mer, and 41-mer in a 1:1.25:1.15 molar ratio, respectively, for 8 min at 95 °C, then cooling the mixture slowly to room temperature over 3 has described previously (15Fiala K.A. Abdel-Gawad W. Suo Z. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6751-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Reaction Buffer L—Buffer L contains 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.4 at 37 °C), 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Buffer L was the optimized buffer used previously for studies probing the fidelity and mechanism of human tpolλ (15Fiala K.A. Abdel-Gawad W. Suo Z. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6751-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). All reactions reported in this paper were carried out in buffer L and at 37 °C. All concentrations refer to concentrations of components after mixing. Determination of the Equilibrium Dissociation Constant (Kd) and the Maximum Rate Constant of Nucleotide Incorporation (kp) of an Incoming Nucleotide—Both kp and Kd were determined by mixing a preincubated solution of full-length polλ and DNA at fixed concentrations with increasing concentrations of an incoming nucleotide (Invitrogen) in buffer L at 37 °C. These reactions were quenched at various times via the addition of 0.37 m EDTA. For the fast incorporation of a correct nucleotide, the reactions were carried out using a rapid chemical quenched-flow apparatus (KinTek). Aliquots of the quenched reactions were analyzed by sequencing gel analysis (17% acrylamide, 8 m urea, 1× Tris borate-EDTA running buffer) and quantitated using a PhosphorImager 445 SI (Molecular Dynamics). The resulting time courses of product formation were fit to a single exponential equation (Equation 1) using the nonlinear regression program KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software) for each concentration of Mg2+·dNTP to give the observed rate constant of nucleotide incorporation (kobs). The corresponding observed incorporation rate constants were plotted against the concentrations of Mg2+·dNTP, and these data were fit to a hyperbola (Equation 2) using KaleidaGraph to give Kd and kp as follows. [Product]=A[1-exp(-kobst)](Eq. 1) kobs=kp[dNTP]/{[dNTP]+Kd}(Eq. 2) Fidelity of Full-length Human polλ—Previously, we established a minimal kinetic mechanism (Scheme 1) for the single-nucleotide gap-filling activity of tpolλ (15Fiala K.A. Abdel-Gawad W. Suo Z. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6751-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Scheme 1 shows that an incoming deoxyribonucleotide binds to the E·DNA binary complex to establish a rapid equilibrium prior to nucleotide incorporation. We expect the full-length polλ to have similar polymerase activity as tpolλ and thus follow the same minimal mechanism shown in Scheme 1. This mechanism allows us to measure the apparent affinity of dNTP (Kd) for the fpolλ·DNA binary complex via the dNTP concentration dependence of the observed single-turnover rate constant (kobs). Our results shown below confirm this hypothesis. The single-turnover method was employed because DNA dissociates from tpolλ with a dissociation rate constant (k1) that is ∼2- to 3-fold slower than the maximum nucleotide incorporation rate constant kp (15Fiala K.A. Abdel-Gawad W. Suo Z. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6751-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), rendering the burst phase (amplitude = [kp/(kp + k1)]2) small. Thus, the experiments were performed with fpolλ in molar excess over DNA (or under single-turnover conditions) to avoid complication from the steady-state reaction phase (20Johnson K.A. The Enzymes. 1992; 20: 1-61Crossref Scopus (378) Google Scholar). A preincubated solution of 5′-32P-labeled D-1 (Fig. 2) and 4-fold fpolλ was reacted with increasing concentrations of correct dTTP in buffer L. The DNA product 22-mer and remaining primer 21-mer at different time intervals were separated and quantitated. The product concentration was plotted against reaction time intervals. These data were subsequently fit to Equation 1, to yield a single-turnover rate constant at each concentration of dTTP (Fig. 3A). The single-turnover rates were then plotted against dTTP concentrations (Fig. 3B). These data were subsequently fit to Equation 2 (see “Materials and Methods”), to yield a kp of 3.9 ± 0.2 s–1 for the maximum dTTP incorporation rate constant, and a Kd of 2.6 ± 0.4 μm for dTTP binding. The substrate specificity (kp/Kd) of dTTP incorporation into D-1 was calculated to be 1.5 × 106 m–1 s–1 (Table 1).FIGURE 3dTTP incorporation into 5′-32P-labeled D-1. Concentration dependence of the pre-steady-state rate of correct deoxyribonucleotide incorporation. A, a preincubated solution of polλ (120 nm) and 32P-labeled D-1 (30 nm) was rapidly mixed with increasing concentrations of Mg2+-dTTP (•, 0.1 μm; ○, 0.25 μm; ▪, 0.5 μm; □, 1 μm; ▴, 3 μm; ▵, 5 μm; ▾, 10 μm; ▿, 25 μm; and ♦, 50 μm) for various time intervals. The solid lines are the best fits to the single exponential equation (Equation 1). B, the single exponential rates obtained from the above data fitting were plotted as a function of dTTP concentration.

The kp/Kd values for tpolλ are from Table 2 of Ref. 15Fiala K.A. Abdel-Gawad W. Suo Z. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6751-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar. Open table in a new tab Similar pre-steady-state kinetic analyses were used to determine the kinetic parameters (Table 1) for the incorporation of each of the remaining three correct nucleotides (dCTP into D-6, dATP into D-7, and dGTP into D-8), and for the incorporation of each of the 12 possible misincorporations into D-1, D-6, D-7, and D-8 (Fig. 2). Notably, the ground-state-binding affinity of all nucleotides to the fpolλ·DNA (Table 1) and the tpolλ·DNA (15Fiala K.A. Abdel-Gawad W. Suo Z. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6751-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) binary complexes were similar, but the maximum incorporation rate constants, particularly for incorrect nucleotides, with fpolλ (Table 1) were slower than the corresponding parameters for tpolλ measured previously (15Fiala K.A. Abdel-Gawad W. Suo Z. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6751-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The substrate specificity (kp/Kd) of all four correct nucleotides was slightly lower for fpolλ when compared with tpolλ (Fig. 4A) with a nucleotide incorporation efficiency ratio, (kp/Kd)tpolλ/ (kp/Kd)fpolλ, less than 2 (Table 1). In contrast, fpolλ incorporated incorrect nucleotides with much lower substrate specificities than tpolλ (Table 1 and Fig. 4B). The nucleotide incorporation efficiency ratio, (kp/Kd)tpolλ/(kp/Kd)fpolλ, was calculated to be in the range of 10–100 for all twelve incorrect base pairs (Table 1). The variation in this ratio was due to the sequence dependence of polymerization catalyzed by DNA polymerases. Nevertheless, the large ratios suggest that fpolλ achieves significantly higher fidelity than tpolλ by lowering the incorporation efficiency of mismatched nucleotides. To confirm this possibility, we calculated the fidelity of fpolλ, which was sequence-dependent and in the range of 10–4–10–5 (Table 1). In comparison, the fidelity of tpolλ with the same single-nucleotide-gapped DNA is also sequence-dependent and in the range of 10–2–10–4 (15Fiala K.A. Abdel-Gawad W. Suo Z. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6751-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Therefore, the full-length polλ is 10- to 100-fold more faithful than the C-terminal fragment tpolλ in filling single-nucleotide-gapped DNA. To ensure the fidelity difference between fpolλ and tpolλ was not due to experimental errors, we repeated the above fidelity and kinetic measurements with both fpolλ and tpolλ individually and obtained almost identical fidelity values (data not shown) to those corresponding values listed in Table 1 from our previously publication (15Fiala K.A. Abdel-Gawad W. Suo Z. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6751-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The significant increase in fidelity from tpolλ to fpolλ is probably due to the presence of the BRCT domain, the proline-rich domain, or both. Fidelity of dpolλ—To identify which of the one or more N-terminal domains up-regulates the fidelity of the full-length polλ, we engineered and purified a fragment, dpolλ (residues 132–575, Fig. 1), that lacks the BRCT domain. With two diagnostic substrates D-6 and D-7, the kinetic parameters and fidelity of dpolλ were determined in the same manner as described above and are listed in Table 2. dpolλ incorporated nucleotides into D-6 and D-7 with a fidelity in the range of 10–4–10–5, which was very similar to the fidelity of fpolλ (Table 1). The nucleotide incorporation efficiency ratios, (kp/Kd)dpolλ/(kp/ Kd)fpolλ, were calculated to be in the range of 0.5–2.1 (Table 2 and Fig. 5). The average ratio for all eight possible nucleotide incorporations into both D-6 and D-7 was calculated to be 1.2. These ratios indicate that the substrate specificity of nucleotides with dpolλ, (kp/Kd)dpolλ, whether slightly larger or smaller, was within 2-fold of the substrate specificity of corresponding nucleotides with fpolλ, (kp/Kd)fpolλ. Because 2-fold differences are considered kinetically insignificant (20Johnson K.A. The Enzymes. 1992; 20: 1-61Crossref Scopus (378) Google Scholar), we concluded that dpolλ and fpolλ have very similar, if not identical, gap-filling efficiency. Thus, the deletion of the BRCT domain in dpolλ did not affect the nucleotide incorporation efficiency and the fidelity of fpolλ. Similar polymerization efficiency and fidelity of dpolλ and fpolλ also indirectly confirmed that the N-terminal hexahistidine tag only present in the recombinant fpolλ did not affect the fidelity of fpolλ. Comparison of the fidelity of fpolλ (10–4–10–5, Table 1), dpolλ (10–4–10–5, Table 2), and tpolλ (10–2–10–4) (15Fiala K.A. Abdel-Gawad W. Suo Z. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6751-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) reveals an intriguing conclusion: the non-enzymatic proline-rich domain alone significantly enhanced the fidelity of human polλ.TABLE 2Kinetic parameters of nucleotide incorporation into single-nucleotide-gapped D-6 and D-7 catalyzed by dpolλ at 37 °CdNTPKdkpkp/KdFidelityaCalculated as (kp/Kd)incorrect/[(kp/Kd)correct + (kp/Kd)incorrect].Efficiencyμms-1m-1 s-1RatiobCalculated as (kp/Kd)dpolλ/(kp/Kd)fpolλ.Template G (D-6)dCTP1.1 ± 0.11.7 ± 0.21.6 × 10610.89dATP3.2 ± 0.90.00010 ± 0.000023.3 × 1012.1 × 10-51.0dTTP1.8 ± 0.80.00030 ± 0.000071.7 × 1021.1 × 10-40.61dGTP3.3 ± 0.50.00022 ± 0.000026.7 × 1014.2 × 10-51.3Template T (D-7)dATP1.0 ± 0.41.8 ± 0.21.8 × 10611.1dTTP11 ± 60.00046 ± 0.000054.2 × 1012.3 × 10-51.7dCTP4 ± 20.006 ± 0.0011.5 × 1038.3 × 10-42.1dGTP5 ± 10.0087 ± 0.00011.7 × 1039.4 × 10-41.2a Calculated as (kp/Kd)incorrect/[(kp/Kd)correct + (kp/Kd)incorrect].b Calculated as (kp/Kd)dpolλ/(kp/Kd)fpolλ.

The role of polλ in DNA repair is further supported by the following observations: (i) like polβ (21Hirose F. Hotta Y. Yamaguchi M. Matsukage A. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 181: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), polλ is expressed at high levels in the developing mouse testes, suggesting a possible function of polλ in DNA repair pathways associated with meiotic recombination (1Garcia-Diaz M.

But this hypothesized role was initially weakened by the observed difference in single-nucleotide gap-filling fidelity between polβ and tpolλ. The fidelity of tpolλ (10–2–10–4) (15Fiala K.A. Abdel-Gawad W. Suo Z. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6751-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) is ∼10- to 100-fold lower than the fidelity of rat polβ (recalculated as 10–4–10–5 using the definition of fidelity in Table 1), which was measured under similar single-turnover conditions with four single-nucleotide-gapped DNA 25–19/45-mer (primer-primer/template) substrates (25Ahn J. Kraynov V.S. Zhong X. Werneburg B.G. Tsai M.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). If the full-length polλ had similar fidelity to tpolλ, it would make 10- to 100-fold more base substitution errors than polβ if it participated in the repair of single-base lesions. DNA base modifications/losses are known to account for a large portion of total cellular DNA damage. Under single-turnover conditions, the deoxyribonucleotide incorporation fidelity of human fpolλ was measured in the presence of four different single-nucleotide-gapped DNA substrates shown in Fig. 2. Surprisingly, the fidelity of fpolλ was determined to be in the range of 10–4–10–5 (Table 1) and was indeed significantly higher than that of tpolλ (10–2–10–4) (15Fiala K.A. Abdel-Gawad W. Suo Z. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6751-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This range for fpolλ was identical to the fidelity range determined for polβ (26Ahn J. Werneburg B.G. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1100-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In addition, the efficiency for correct nucleotide incorporation into single-nucleotide-gapped DNA catalyzed by fpolλ (1.2 × 106–1.8 × 106 m–1 s–1, Table 1) was only slightly lower than polβ (4 × 106–6 × 106 m–1 s–1) (26Ahn J. Werneburg B.G. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1100-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Similar polymerization efficiency and fidelity in combination with other biological evidence discussed above strongly support the hypothesis that polλ and polβ both possess similar in vivo roles, such as functioning in BER. So far, the generation of knock-out mice through deletion of exons 5–7 of the polλ gene has not yet confirmed the involvement of polλ in BER or any other biological processes (27Bertocci B. De Smet A. Flatter E. Dahan A. Bories J.C. Landreau C. Weill J.C. Reynaud C.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 3702-3706Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The published mouse polλ knock-out experiments (27Bertocci B. De Smet A. Flatter E. Dahan A. Bories J.C. Landreau C. Weill J.C. Reynaud C.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 3702-3706Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 28Kobayashi Y. Watanabe M. Okada Y. Sawa H. Takai H. Nakanishi M. Kawase Y. Suzuki H. Nagashima K. Ikeda K. Motoyama N. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 2769-2776Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) are likely complicated by the existence of polβ (28Kobayashi Y. Watanabe M. Okada Y. Sawa H. Takai H. Nakanishi M. Kawase Y. Suzuki H. Nagashima K. Ikeda K. Motoyama N. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 2769-2776Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), which could fill in and compensate for the loss of functional polλ. The measured fidelity of fpolλ (Table 1) was 10- to 100-fold higher than the fidelity of tpolλ (10–2 to 10–4), estimated by employing the same single-turnover kinetic assay with identical DNA substrates (15Fiala K.A. Abdel-Gawad W. Suo Z. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6751-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This indicated that the N-terminal domains of polλ (Fig. 1) significantly enhance the fidelity of polλ. Because tpolλ possesses slightly higher correct nucleotide incorporation efficiency than fpolλ (Table 1) and both enzymes bind to all correct and incorrect nucleotides with similarly high affinity (Table 1 and Ref. 15Fiala K.A. Abdel-Gawad W. Suo Z. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6751-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that the absence of the N-terminal domains will cause any type of misfolding of tpolλ and thus contribute to its low fidelity. This assumption was validated based on the following structural evidence: (i) when the high resolution tpolλ binary structure (2.1 Å) (12Garcia-Diaz M. Bebenek K. Krahn J.M. Blanco L. Kunkel T.A. Pedersen L.C. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 561-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and the full-length polβ ternary structure (2.2 Å) (14Sawaya M.R. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Pelletier H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar) are overlaid, the α carbons superimposed very well with a root mean square deviation of 1.4 Å for 113 C-α atoms (12Garcia-Diaz M. Bebenek K. Krahn J.M. Blanco L. Kunkel T.A. Pedersen L.C. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 561-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), suggesting that tpolλ folds well and similarly to polβ in the absence of the two N-terminal domains of polλ and (ii) no unfolded regions in tpolλ are observed in its 1.95–2.3 Å binary (12Garcia-Diaz M. Bebenek K. Krahn J.M. Blanco L. Kunkel T.A. Pedersen L.C. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 561-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and ternary crystal structures (11Garcia-Diaz M. Bebenek K. Krahn J.M. Kunkel T.A. Pedersen L.C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 97-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the average ratio of (kp/Kd)dpolλ/(kp/Kd)fpolλ for all eight possible nucleotide incorporation with D-6 and D-7 was 1.2 (Fig. 5), indicating that dpolλ and fpolλ almost have equal nucleotide incorporation efficiency. As expected, these two enzymes also have very similar fidelity (Tables 1 and 2). Thus, the deletion of the BRCT domain affected neither the single-nucleotide gap-filling efficiency nor the fidelity of polλ, whereas differences in fidelity between dpolλ and tpolλ demonstrated that the non-enzymatic proline-rich domain dramatically enhanced the fidelity of polλ by up to a 100-fold. This conclusion is consistent with the proposed function of the BRCT domain, which is generally known to mediate the protein-protein or protein-DNA interactions required for particular DNA repair pathways and cellular responsiveness to DNA damage (1Garcia-Diaz M. Dominguez O. Lopez-Fernandez L.A. de Lera L.T. Saniger M.L. Ruiz J.F. Parraga M. Garcia-Ortiz M.J. Kirchhoff T. del Mazo J. Bernad A. Blanco L. J. Mol.

Our conclusion is also supported by the observation of Shimazaki et al. (6Shimazaki N. Yoshida K. Kobayashi T. Toji S. Tamai K. Koiwai O. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 639-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) in which they found that deletion of the BRCT domain of human polλ did not affect DNA synthesis with DNA substrates, including poly(dA)/oligo(dT) and activated DNA. The proline-rich domain has been proposed to merely couple polymerase action to the protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions required during DNA repair (1Garcia-Diaz M. Dominguez O. Lopez-Fernandez L.A. de Lera L.T. Saniger M.L. Ruiz J.F. Parraga M. Garcia-Ortiz M.J. Kirchhoff T. del Mazo J. Bernad A. Blanco L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 851-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Thus, the proline-rich domain is generally assumed to be dispensable for the polymerase activity of polλ. However, the difference in fidelity between tpolλ and dpolλ observed here suggested that the flexible proline-rich domain actively regulates the polymerase fidelity. Enhancement of the fidelity of a polymerase by a non-enzymatic domain is both surprising and unprecedented. Therefore, the 11-kDa proline-rich domain must interact with the subdomains of tpolλ and optimize the geometry of the polymerase active site to achieve higher fidelity. The fidelity modulation observed here differs dramatically from the fidelity enhancement contributed by the enzymatic activity of a 3′→5′ exonuclease domain of a replicative DNA polymerase, or by an accessory protein as in the case of the mitochondrial DNA polymerase complex (29Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38090-38096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Amazingly, the enhancement of the polλ fidelity by the proline-rich domain is as large as what has been contributed by the proofreading 3′→5′ exonuclease domain to a replicative DNA polymerase (29Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38090-38096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 30Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38097-38107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results further suggest that DNA polymerases, the vital enzymes that replicate and maintain genomic DNA, have evolved through different mechanisms to adjust their polymerization fidelity to best perform diverse physiological functions. Interestingly, the fidelity difference between tpolλ and fpolλ resulted mainly from stronger discrimination against mismatched nucleotides by fpolλ. The average substrate specificity of misincorporations was 10- to 100-fold lower with fpolλ than with tpolλ (Fig. 4B). In comparison, fpolλ incorporated correct dNTPs with an efficiency (kp/Kd) of (1.2–1.8) × 106 m–1s–1 (Table 1), which was only ∼2-fold lower than the corresponding range of (2.1–2.7) × 106 m–1s–1 with tpolλ (Fig. 4A). The larger decrease in the incorporation efficiency of mismatched over matched dNTPs (Table 1 and Fig. 4) with fpolλ led to the higher fidelity of polλ. In comparison, the accessory subunit enhances the fidelity of mitochondrial DNA polymerase by 14-fold by increasing the incorporation efficiency of a correct A:T base pair more than a T:T mismatch (29Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38090-38096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the decrease in the incorporation efficiency of both matched and mismatched dNTPs was due to slower incorporation rate constants (kp) with fpolλ than with tpolλ, because the binding of all dNTPs (Kd) by these two enzymes was similarly tight (Table 1 and Ref. 15Fiala K.A. Abdel-Gawad W. Suo Z. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6751-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This suggested fpolλ was slower yet more faithful than tpolλ in filling single-nucleotide-gapped DNA. This correlation goes against the general trend summarized from a survey of the A-, B-, X-, and Y-families by Beard et al. (31Beard W.A. Shock D.D. Vande Berg B.J. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47393-47398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) that a more catalytically efficient polymerase has a lower base substitution rate. It is not clear what contributes to this intriguing correlation between the polymerase fidelity and nucleotide incorporation rate. We speculate that the presence of the proline-rich domain in both fpolλ and dpolλ may either somewhat tighten the polymerase active site to achieve better geometric selection (32Kool E.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 191-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 33Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10493-10495Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), or shield the active site of polλ from solvent, which leads to greater desolvation of a nascent base pair and amplifies the free energy differences between matched and mismatched nucleotide incorporations (34Petruska J. Sowers L.C. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1559-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). These possibilities can be evaluated by the active site structural differences between the ternary crystal structures of fpolλ (or dpolλ)·single-nucleotide-gapped DNA·dNTP and tpolλ·single-nucleotide-gapped DNA·dNTP (11Garcia-Diaz M. Bebenek K. Krahn J.M. Kunkel T.A. Pedersen L.C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 97-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), especially in the presence of a mismatched incoming nucleotide."

It is well established that the effects of TGF-β are mediated through its interaction with cell surface receptors. Smad transcription factors are intracellular key mediators of TGF-β signaling. Receptor-activated Smad2 and Smad3 are phosphorylated by the activated TGF-β receptor complex, forming hetero-complexes with Smad4, a common partner in the assembly of transcriptional complexes (17Shi Y. Massague J. Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4740) Google Scholar). These complexes then translocate into the nucleus and interact with a variety of transcription factors such as p300 and E2F4/5, leading to synergistic transcriptional activation or suppression of target genes (18Zimmerman C.M.

Based on nuclear run-on analysis and the Cited2 promoter/reporter assay, Cited2 transcription was not affected by TGF-β. We showed that this TGF-β-mediated down-regulation occurs by a post-transcriptional mechanism involving an increase in the turnover rate of Cited2 mRNA. By stable expression of the Cited2 coding sequence under the control of a heterologous promoter, we found that the expression of endogenous and exogenous Cited2 mRNA is down-regulated by TGF-β, suggesting that the Cited2 coding sequence is sufficient for proper regulation. It has been shown previously that both TGF-β and Cited2 play important roles during embryonic development and tumorigenesis, and unraveling the mechanism of how Cited2 is regulated by TGF-β may contribute to understanding the effects of TGF-β signaling on development and tumor progression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Antibodies—Recombinant human TGF-β1 was purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN).

Phoenix packaging cells were used to generate amphotropic retroviruses. Briefly, Phoenix cells were seeded at a density of 3.5 × 106 cells per 10-cm dish and transfected with 10 μgof retrovirus vector by the calcium phosphate method the following day. Forty eight hours after transfection, virus-containing supernatant was collected. For virus infection, 1 day before infection, 1 × 105 cells were seeded on a 6-cm dish. Cells were incubated with virus for 24 h, followed by antibiotic selection with 0.8 μg/ml puromycin for MDA-MB-231 cells. Individual clones were picked after puromycin selection. The mRNA and protein expression levels in the individual clones were monitored by Northern and Western blot analysis. Stable transfectants were pooled after selection. For generation of Tet-Off-inducible Cited2 MEF lines, a Cited2–/– MEF line infected with retrovirus expressing Cited2 was selected with 2.5 μg/ml puromycin for 1 week. Individual clones were picked, and Cited2 protein and mRNA expression levels were monitored 24 h after culturing cells in 2 μg/ml tetracycline.Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PVDF-plus; Osmonics Inc., Westborough, MA). Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies followed by incubation with secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Reacted secondary antibodies were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences).Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from cells using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. 10 μg per lane of total RNA was separated by 2.2 m formaldehydeagarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nylon membrane (Magna; Osmonics Inc.).Nuclear Run-on Assay—Nuclei from ∼3 × 107 cells were collected, and nuclear run-on assay was performed as described previously (30Greenberg M.E. Ziff E.B. Nature. 1984; 311: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar). Single-stranded DNA complementary to Cited2 and junB mRNA or alkaline-denatured double-stranded cDNA of Cited2, junB, GAPDH, and 36B4, and empty pUC19 vector were slot-blotted onto a nylon membrane (Magna; Osmonics Inc.) for hybridization with 32P-labeled run-on products. Single-stranded DNA complementary to Cited2 or junB mRNA was prepared by asymmetric PCR amplification according to standard procedures (31Gyllensten U.B. Erlich H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Total RNA was isolated by the Trizol (Invitrogen) method and reverse-transcribed by SuperScript™ first-strand synthesis system for reverse transcription-PCR (Invitrogen). Real time PCR was performed with iQ™ Syber-Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) in a MyiQ thermocycler (Bio-Rad) using Syber-Green™ detection protocol outlined by the manufacturer. All quantitations were normalized to an endogenous control GAPDH. The relative quantitation value for each target gene compared with the calibrator for that target is expressed as 2–(Ct–Cc) (Ct and Cc are the mean threshold cycle differences after normalization to GAPDH).RESULTSTGF-β Down-regulates Cited2 in MDA-MB-231 Cells—Chen et al. (26Chen C.R. Kang Y. Massague J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 992-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) showed previously by microarray analysis that Cited2 is one of the genes down-regulated by TGF-β in both MCF-10A and MDA-MB-231 cells. We performed Northern analysis to confirm the microarray data. Cited2 was down-regulated by TGF-β in both cell lines (Fig. 1A). Because the basal expression of Cited2 was high in MDA-MB-231 cells, and the down-regulation by TGF-β was easily detected, we used MDA-MB-231 cells to study TGF-β-mediated Cited2 down-regulation in the following experiments. TGF-β down-regulated Cited2 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B), and 2.5 ng/ml TGF-β was used throughout the study. We performed the time course experiment to measure the TGF-β effect on Cited2 mRNA and protein levels. Both Cited2 mRNA (Fig. 1C) and protein (Fig. 1D) levels were down-regulated by TGF-β. These experiments confirm that Cited2 is a TGF-β-responsive gene. We also observed that 24 h after TGF-β stimulation, phosphorylated Smad2 (p-Smad2) and Smad3 (p-Smad3) significantly decreased (Fig. 1D), and Cited2 mRNA and protein levels started to recover at the same time (Fig. 1, C and D), suggesting that the Smad pathway may be involved in the down-regulation of Cited2.Smad-dependent Pathway Is Involved in TGF-β-mediated Down-regulation of Cited2—Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 are key mediators in the TGF-β signaling pathway. However, certain TGF-β-responsive genes, such as fibronectin and novH, are either up-regulated or down-regulated through the Smad-independent pathways (32Hocevar B.A. Brown T.L. Howe P.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Lafont J. Laurent M. Thibout H. Lallemand F. Le Bouc Y. Atfi A. Martinerie C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41220-41229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether the Smad pathway is involved in the down-regulation of Cited2 by TGF-β, an expression plasmid for Smad7, an inhibitory Smad, was introduced into MDA-MB-231 cells through retrovirus-mediated gene transfer (Fig. 2A). Overexpression of Smad7 in cells decreased TGF-β-mediated phosphorylation of Smad2 (Fig. 2A) and attenuated down-regulation of Cited2 mRNA (Fig. 2B) and protein levels (Fig. 2A) by TGF-β, supporting that the Smad pathway is involved in the down-regulation of Cited2. To further test which Smads are involved in the down-regulation of Cited2 by TGF-β, a short interference RNA specific for Smad2 (si-Smad2), Smad3 (si-Smad3), or Smad4 (si-Smad4) was used in MDA-MB-231 cells. Transfection with si-Smad4 significantly attenuated TGF-β-mediated down-regulation of Cited2 mRNA (Fig. 2D). Receptor Smads, Smad2 and Smad3, may work individually with Smad4 or in cooperation with each other. Cotransfection with both si-Smad2 and si-Smad3 effectively decreased TGF-β-mediated down-regulation of Cited2 mRNA (Fig. 2D), suggesting that receptor Smad is required for the down-regulation of Cited2, and Smad2 or Smad3 may compensate each other in individual knockdown experiments. The efficiency of knocking down specific Smad2, Smad3, or Smad4 by siRNA was further confirmed in Fig. 2C. Taken together, these data support the conclusion that Smad4 and receptor Smad, Smad2 or Smad3, are involved in TGF-β-mediated down-regulation of Cited2. In addition to TGF-β, the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family also executes signaling through Smad4 but in combination with different receptor Smads, Smad1/5/8 (34Chen D. Zhao M. Mundy G.R. Growth Factors. 2004; 22: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1690) Google Scholar). We further tested whether BMP signaling down-regulates Cited2. Unlike TGF-β, BMP2 did not significantly down-regulate Cited2 (Fig. 2E), although BMP2-mediated phosphorylation of Smad1/5 was detected in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 2F). These results suggest that specific receptor Smads are involved in the down-regulation of Cited2.FIGURE 2Smad pathway is involved in the down-regulation of Cited2 by TGF-β. A, MDA-MB-231 cells overexpressing Smad7 (MDA-MB-231 pBABE-FLAG-Smad7) were generated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were treated with 2.5 ng/ml TGF-β for 4 h, and total cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis with specific antibodies against FLAG, phospho-Smad2, Cited2, and β-actin. The relative intensity of specific Cited2 bands was quantified by densitometry and normalized with β-actin. B, MDA-MB-231 stable transfectants with pBABE or pBABE-FLAG-Smad7 were incubated with2.5 ng/ml TGF-β for 4 h, followed by Northern analysis with specific probes for Cited2 and GAPDH. The relative intensity of specific Cited2 bands was quantified by densitometry and normalized with GAPDH. C, MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with si-Smad2, si-Smad3, si-Smad4, or si-Control for 60 h, followed by TGF-β stimulation for 4 h. Total RNA was isolated and subjected to quantitative real time PCR analysis with specific primers for Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4, and normalized with GAPDH. D, MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with si-Control, si-Smad2, si-Smad3, or si-Smad4 for 60 h, followed by TGF-β stimulation for 4 h as described in C. Total RNA was isolated and subjected to Northern analysis (top left) with specific probes for Cited2 and GAPDH and quantitative real time PCR analysis (bottom left) with specific primers for Cited2. MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with si-Control or both si-Smad2 and si-Smad3 for 60 h, followed by TGF-β stimulation for 4 h. Total RNA was isolated and subjected to Northern analysis (top right) and real time analysis (bottom right) as described previously. E, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of TGF-β or BMP2 for 4 h. Total RNA was isolated and subjected to Northern analysis with specific probes for Cited2 and GAPDH. F, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 1 ng/ml TGF-β or 100 ng/ml BMP2 for 30 min. Total cell lysates were isolated and subjected to Western blot analysis with specific antibodies against phospho-Smad1/Smad5 (p-Smad1/5), p-Smad2, and β-actin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TGF-β Down-regulates Cited2 by Post-transcriptional Regulation—To determine whether changes in the Cited2 mRNA level under TGF-β stimulation are because of changes in the rate of transcription, nuclear run-on assays were performed by using nuclei isolated from either TGF-β-treated or -untreated MDA-MB-231 cells. Run-on transcripts were labeled in vitro with [32P]UTP and hybridized to denatured double-stranded or antisense single-stranded DNA of junB and Cited2 coding sequences. In cells stimulated by TGF-β, the transcription of junB, a TGF-β responsive gene, was enhanced, although Cited2 transcription was not affected (Fig. 3A), indicating that TGF-β-mediated down-regulation of Cited2 is not through the transcriptional control. To further confirm nuclear run-on analysis, serial deletion mutants of Cited2 promoter/reporter were tested by luciferase assay (Fig. 3B). Consistent with nuclear run-on analysis, reporter activity of Cited2 promoter-luciferase constructs was not affected by TGF-β stimulation in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 3C). These experiments suggest that TGF-β-mediated down-regulation of Cited2 is most likely through"

In contrast, “Group 2” receptors show low similarity with LILRB1/B2, and their ligands remain to be identified. To date, the structural and functional characteristics of Group 2 LILRs are poorly understood. Here we report the crystal structure of the extracellular domain of LILRA5, which is an activating Group 2 LILR expressed on monocytes and neutrophils.

Leukocytes are regulated by opposing signaling pathways triggered by interactions of cell surface receptors with their ligands. Leukocyte Ig-like receptors (LILRs 3The abbreviations used are: LILR, leukocyte Ig-like receptor; KIR, killer cell Ig-like receptor; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; MHCI, MHC class I; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; SeMet, selenomethionyl; D1, domain 1; D2, domain 2; Bicine, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine. 3The abbreviations used are: LILR, leukocyte Ig-like receptor; KIR, killer cell Ig-like receptor; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; MHCI, MHC class I; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; SeMet, selenomethionyl; D1, domain 1; D2, domain 2; Bicine, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine. or LIRs, also called Ig-like transcripts (ILTs) and CD85) are encoded in human chromosome 19q13.4, along with the other Ig-like receptors, including the killer cell Ig-like receptor (KIR) family, FCAR and NKp46 (1Martin A.M. Kulski J.K. Witt C. Pontarotti P. Christiansen F.T. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 81-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The LILR family has two or four tandem Ig-like extracellular domains and is divided into three functional categories: inhibitory, activating, and secreted receptors (2Brown D. Trowsdale J. Allen R. Tissue Antigens. 2004; 64: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The inhibitory LILR receptors have long cytoplasmic tails with two to four immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs, in which the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues recruits the Src homology 2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase-1, transducing negative signals to inhibit activation signals. In contrast, the activating receptors have short cytoplasmic tails lacking immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs and an arginine residue in the transmembrane region, which binds to negatively charged residues of FcRγ harboring the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif. The LILRs are mainly expressed on myelomonocytic cells, although some are also expressed on a wide range of leukocytes.LILRA5 (LIR9/ILT11/CD85f) is expressed as both a membrane-bound activating and a secreted form (3Borges L. Kubin M. Kuhlman T. Blood. 2003; 101: 1484-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The membrane-bound form of LILRA5 has two Ig-like domains in the extracellular region with typical features of activating receptors (an arginine in the transmenbrane region and a short cytoplasmic domain), whereas the secreted form only has the extracellular domain. In contrast with LILRB1, which is expressed on a range of leukocytes, the expression of the activating form of LILRA5 has been detected on CD14+ monocytes (3Borges L. Kubin M. Kuhlman T. Blood. 2003; 101: 1484-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The expression of LILRA5 has also been detected in neutrophils and monocytes but only at the mRNA level (3Borges L. Kubin M. Kuhlman T. Blood. 2003; 101: 1484-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cross-linking of LILRA5 molecules on monocytes using anti-LILRA5 antibody induced the mobilization of calcium and the secretion of cytokines released in the early stages of inflammatory responses, such as interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-6 (3Borges L. Kubin M. Kuhlman T. Blood. 2003; 101: 1484-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, LILRA5 may modulate CD14+ monocyte function under inflammatory conditions.The LILR family members can be divided into two groups: “Group 1” (LILRA1/A2/A3/B1/B2) and “Group 2” (LILRA4/A5/A6/B3/B4/B5) types (4Willcox B.E. Thomas L.M. Bjorkman P.J. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 913-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Group 1 types have over 70% sequence similarity to LILRB1 and LILRB2, which bind to a broad range of human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules (MHCIs: HLA-A, -B, -C, -E, -F, and -G) (5Chapman T.L. Heikeman A.P. Bjorkman P.J. Immunity. 1999; 11: 603-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 6Lepin E.J. Bastin J.M. Allan D.S. Roncador G. Braud V.M.

Since the crystal structure of the LILRB1-HLA-A2 complex showed that the residues on the MHCI binding site of the Group 1 receptors were well conserved, it is likely that all of the Group 1 receptors have the potential to bind MHCIs. In contrast, Group 2 receptors show less than 60% sequence similarity to LILRB1 and LILRB2 with amino acid substitutions on the MHCI binding site. Preliminary cellular studies (8Allen R.L. Raine T.

Med. 1997; 185: 1743-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) have shown that Group 2 LILRs do not bind some MHCI molecules, although ligands for the Group 2 receptors remain to be identified. As a result, it has proved difficult to investigate the Group 2 type LILRs.Here we report the crystal structure of the whole extracellular domain of LILRA5 at 1.85 Å resolution. This is the first example of a three-dimensional Group 2 LILR structure. The structure showed that the overall structure of LILRA5 resembled the N-terminal two Ig-like domains of LILRB1/B2 previously shown to be responsible for MHCI recognition in these receptors (4Willcox B.E. Thomas L.M. Bjorkman P.J. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 913-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). However, there were large differences in the local structure and surface electrostatic potential of the region corresponding to the MHCI recognition site of LILRB1/B2. The amino acid substitutions responsible for these changes are well conserved in Group 2 LILRs. In addition, surface plasmon resonance and flow cytometric analyses demonstrated that LILRA5 did not recognize all tested MHCIs. Taken together, these results clearly suggested that LILRA5 is not a MHCI-recognizing receptor but binds to unknown ligands to modulate functions of monocytes and neutrophils. By analogy, it seems likely that the other Group 2 LILR members also recognize as yet unidentified ligand(s). The identification of ligands for the Group 2 receptors may provide insight into the mechanisms regulating immune responses.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning, Expression, and Purification of LILRA5—A fragment of the gene encoding the LILRA5 extracellular domain was produced by two steps of PCR amplification, using a cDNA library of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The forward and reverse primers used to clone the cDNA of LILRA5 were 5′-CACCATGGTCTCATCCGTCTG-3′ and 5′-GACTTGTTTTGTGACGGACTGAG-3′, respectively. For introduction of the restriction enzyme sites (NdeI and HindIII), 5′-GGAATTCCATATGGGGAACCTCTCCAAAGCCAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TAGGCAAGCTTATGAGACCGGAATCTCCAGGAG-3′ (reverse) primers were used. The resultant PCR fragment including the whole extracellular domain (residues 1-196) with additional N-terminal methionine was digested with the restriction enzymes NdeI and HindIII and ligated into the pGMT7 expression vector (12Reid S.W. Smith K.J. Jakobsen B.K. O'Callaghan C.A. Reyburn H. Harlos K. Stuart D.I. McMichael A.J. Bell J.I. Jones E.Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 383: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Inclusion bodies of LILRA5 were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS and prepared as previously reported for LILRB1 and LILRB2 (7Shiroishi M. Tsumoto K. Amano K. Shirakihara Y.

The purified LILRA5 inclusion bodies were then solubilized with denaturant solution (6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 50 mm MES, pH 6.5, 10 mm EDTA). 1 h prior to refolding, dithiothreitol (2 mm final concentration) was added into the protein solution to reduce disulfide bonds. The solubilized protein solution was diluted slowly into the refolding buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.4 ml-arginine, 2 mm EDTA, 3.73 mm cystamine, 6.37 mm cysteamine) to the final protein concentration of 2 μm and stirred for 48 h at 4 °C. Then the refolding solution was concentrated with a VIVAFLOW50 system (Sartorius) and an Amicon Ultra concentrator (Millipore). The concentrated LILRA5 solution was loaded on gel filtration column, Superdex 75. Further purification was performed by anion exchange chromatography with ResourceQ (Amersham Biosciences).Production of Selenomethionyl (SeMet) LILRA5—The inclusion bodies of SeMet derivative LILRA5 were obtained from E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS grown in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 1 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.4% glucose, all l-amino acids except methionine, and 25 mg/liter SeMet. The SeMet LILRA5 was refolded and purified in the same way as the native protein described above.Crystallization and Data Collection—Purified SeMet LILRA5 (20 mm Tris, pH 9.0, 50 mm NaCl) was concentrated to 10 mg/ml. An initial crystallization trial was performed using the crystallization screening kits, Crystal Screen I&II (Hampton Research) and Wizard I&II (Emerald Biostructures). 0.2 μl of protein solution was mixed in a 1:1 ratio with the crystallization reservoir solution on the Intelli-Plate (Art Robbins Instruments) using an autocrystallization setup system for sitting drop vapor diffusion, HYDRA-Plus1 (Apogent Discoveries). Square rod-type crystals were obtained in the condition of Crystal Screen II-48 (0.1 m Bicine, pH 9.0, 10% polyethylene glycol 20000, and 2% dioxane) at 20 °C. Crystals suitable for data collection were grown from 2-μl hanging drops containing the same protein/condition mixture. Multiwavelength anomalous dispersion data were collected with an ADSC Quantum 315 CCD detector at the beamline BL41XU of SPring-8 (Harima, Japan). Data collection was carried out at 100 K with crystals soaked in the reservoir solution containing 20% ethylene glycol. The diffraction data were processed and scaled with the HKL2000 program package (Table 1).TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsPeakEdgeRemoteHiResData collectionBeamlineBL41XUBL41XUBL41XUBL41XUResolution (Å)50-2.0 (2.07-2.0)50-2.0 (2.07-2.0)50-2.0 (2.07-2.0)66-1.85 (1.92-1.85)Space groupP212121Unit cell dimensions (Å)a = 28.1, b = 58.6, c = 131.6Wavelength (Å)0.979210.979560.900001.00000Measurements98,21999,14196,895106,126Unique reflections14,88814,97014,93418,650Completeness (%)95.8 (82.7)96.4 (74.5)95.2 (68.1)95.6 (71.3)Redundancy6.6 (5.2)6.6 (4.7)6.5 (4.3)5.7 (3.6)I/Σ(I)13.4 (5.2)13.4 (4.0)11.6 (2.7)23.7 (3.3)Rmerge (%)aRmerge = Σ|Ii - 〈I 〉|/Σ|I|, where Ii is the ith observation of the intensity of the hkl reflection, and 〈I 〉 is the mean intensity from multiple measurements of the h, k, l reflection.4.8 (25.1)4.8 (27.7)5.0 (33.8)5.7 (30.9)RefinementResolution (Å)66-1.85Reflections (working set)17,645Reflections (test set)951 (5.1%)Rcryst (%)bRcryst = Σ||Fo| - |Fc||/Σ|Fo|, where |Fo| and |Fc| are the observed and calculated structure factor amplitudes for the h, k, l reflection.23.4Rfree (%)26.9Residues180 of 196Water105Average B-factor (Å2)34.8Root mean square deviation, bond lengths (Å)0.015Root mean square deviation, bond angles (Å)1.155a Rmerge = Σ|Ii - 〈I 〉|/Σ|I|, where Ii is the ith observation of the intensity of the hkl reflection, and 〈I 〉 is the mean intensity from multiple measurements of the h, k, l reflection.b Rcryst = Σ||Fo| - |Fc||/Σ|Fo|, where |Fo| and |Fc| are the observed and calculated structure factor amplitudes for the h, k, l reflection.

Further model building was done with LAFIRE (available on the World Wide Web at altair.sci.hokudai.ac.jp/g6/Research/Lafire_English.html). Subsequent manual model building and refinement were carried out using the programs O (16Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr.

The final model contained 180 of 196 residues (93 of 95 in domain 1 and 87 of 101 in domain 2) and 105 water molecules, with an R-factor of 23.4% (Rfree = 26.9%). Residues 1 and 2, 106-116, and 136-138 were disordered. 91.8% of total residues were in the most favored regions, and 0% were in the disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. Ramachandran plot and secondary structure assignments were generated with PROCHECK (19Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Superimposition and root mean square difference calculation were performed using Swiss-Pdbviewer. In order to analyze the interdomain contacts and buried surface areas, D1 was defined as residues 1-96, and D2 was defined as residues 97-196, based on the structure. Interdomain contact residues were identified using the program CONTACT (41Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19707) Google Scholar). Buried surface areas were calculated with the program NACCESS (available on the World Wide Web at wolf.bms.umist.ac.uk/naccess/) with a 1.4-Å probe radius. Figures were prepared using PyMOL (available on the World Wide Web at pymol.sourceforge.net/) and GRASP (20Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B.

The biotinylated human MHC class I molecules were prepared as described previously (7Shiroishi M. Tsumoto K. Amano K. Shirakihara Y. Colonna M. Braud V.M. Allan D.S. Makadzange A. Rowland-Jones S.

The LILRA5 and LILRB1 solution was buffer-exchanged to HBS-EP (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, and 0.005% surfactant P20), and LILRA5 (or LILRB1) solution was flowed over at a rate of 10 μl/min.Flow Cytometric Analysis for Binding of LILRA5 to HLA-Cw4-transfected 721.221 Cells—We constructed a vector containing LILRA5 fused to a C-terminal biotin ligase (BirA) recognition tag (GSLHHILDAQKMVWNHR). Tagged LILRA5 was refolded and purified as the wild type protein. Biotinylated LILRA5 was prepared as described previously (7Shiroishi M. Tsumoto K. Amano K. Shirakihara Y. Colonna M. Braud V.M. Allan D.S. Makadzange A. Rowland-Jones S. Willcox B. Jones E.Y. Van Der Merwe P.A. Kumagai I. Maenaka K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8856-8861Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The LILRA5 tetramer was produced by incubation of biotinylated LILRA5 with phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin (Molecular Probes) for 15 min on ice. LILRB1 tetramer was prepared in the same manner. HLA-Cw4-transfected 721.221 cells (kindly provided by Dr. P. Parham) were also produced. Cells were incubated with either LILRB1 or LILRA5 tetramer for 1 h on ice. Untreated control cells were incubated with phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin. Subsequently, stained cells were analyzed by EPICS ALTRA (Beckman Coulter). Cell surface expression of HLA-Cw4 was monitored by 0.01 mg of fluorescein-labeled W6/32 anti-HLA monoclonal antibody (H-199; Leinco Technologies) or fluorescein-labeled mouse IgG2a (I-106; Leinco Technologies).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONCrystallization and Structural Determination of LILRA5 Extracellular Domain—The whole extracellular domain of LILRA5 (residues 1-196) was overexpressed in E. coli as inclusion bodies and renatured by dilution refolding (7Shiroishi M. Tsumoto K. Amano K. Shirakihara Y. Colonna M. Braud V.M. Allan D.S. Makadzange A. Rowland-Jones S. Willcox B. Jones E.Y. Van Der Merwe P.A. Kumagai I. Maenaka K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8856-8861Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). One major peak was obtained from gel filtration and further purified by ion exchange chromatography. Crystals of the LILRA5 protein (space group was primitive orthorhombic (P212121), and unit cell parameters were a = 28.0 Å, b = 58.5 Å, c = 131.2 Å) were obtained in 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, 20% polyethylene glycol 4000, and 10% isopropyl alcohol, and the data set was collected to the resolution limit of 2.2 Å at SPring-8. It proved impossible to solve the structure of LILRA5 by molecular replacement using the structure of either LILRB1 or LILRB2 as a search probe. Therefore, we produced SeMet derivative protein in order to perform multiwavelength anomalous dispersion analysis. The SeMet derivative of LILRA5 was refolded, purified, and concentrated using a protocol similar to that described for the native protein. It was not possible to crystallize the SeMet protein in similar conditions to the native protein, but crystals were obtained in 0.1 m Bicine, pH 9.0, 10% polyethylene glycol 20000, and 2% dioxane. The crystal structure of the extracellular domain of LILRA5 was determined in the space group of P212121 to 1.85 Å resolution by the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion method (details given under “Experimental Procedures” and in Table 1). The refined structure of the LILRA5 extracellular domain included two Ig-like domains (domain 1 (D1; residues 3-96) and domain 2 (D2; residues 100-195)), with a short linker connecting the two domains (residues 97-99) (Fig. 1, A and B). The AB (residues 106-116) and CC′ (residues 136-138) loops of D2 were disordered (Fig. 1, A and C). The average B-factor of D2 (46.0 Å2) was higher than that of domain 1 (D1) (24.3 Å2), which may be due to the relatively loose packing of D2 in the crystal.Overall Structure—The amino acid sequence identities among the other Ig-like receptors encoded within the LRC region (hereafter, designated as the LRC receptors), such as LILRA5, KIR, NKp46, and FcαR, are 35-41%, lower than those among LILR family receptors (Fig. 2). However, the overall structure of LILRA5 closely resembled that of the LRC receptors: KIRs (for KIR2DL3, root mean square deviations of 1.24 Å for 153 Cα atoms) (21Fan Q.R. Mosyak L. Winter C.C.

Nature. 2003; 423: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), LILRB1 (0.92 Å for 143 Cα atoms) (26Chapman T.L. Heikema A.P. West Jr., A.P. Bjorkman P.J.

West Jr., A.P. Bjorkman P.J. BMC Struct. Biol. 2002; 2: 6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Figs. 1A and 2) (see supplemental Table S1). The acute D1-D2 hinge angle of LILRA5 was also similar to related receptors (LILRB1, KIR2DL2, KIR2DL3, LILRB2, and NKp46). The total buried area at the interdomain interface was 867 Å2, relatively small compared with the other LRC receptors (LILRB1 (957 Å2), KIR2DL1 (1071 Å2), KIR2DL2 (949 Å2), KIR2DL3 (933 Å2), FcαR (1139 Å2), and NKp46 (891 Å2)) but larger than that of LILRB2 (779 Å2).FIGURE 2Alignment of LILRA5 amino acid sequences and other related receptors encoded in the LRC region. Secondary structure elements of LILRA5 are shown above the sequences. The arrows indicate β-strands, gray cylinders indicate 310 helices, and PP indicates polyproline II-type helices. The dashed lines indicate the disordered regions. The residues conserved in all receptors are shaded in black, and the residues conserved in LILRs are surrounded by squares. The asterisks indicate the residues involved in the MHCI binding of LILRB1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The folding topology of LILRA5 was similar but distinct from LILRB1 and B2 (detailed differences are described below). Rather the topology of D1 and D2 domains was essentially the same as NKp46 and KIR2DLs, respectively, despite the low sequence identities between these receptors and LILRA5 (Fig. 2). Similar to the other LRC receptors, the first β-strand (A strand) in D1 of LILRA5 is split into two shorter strands (A and A′) by a cis-proline (Pro12) and shared between the two β-strands (B and G strands). However, residues 106-116 of D2, which corresponds to the A′ strand of D1 in the other LRC receptors, was disordered. The insertion of the cis-proline residue (Pro194) distorted the G strand in D2, which prevents the A′ strand from making hydrogen bonds to the G strand as observed in D1 of LILRA5 and the other LRC receptors (Fig. 1C). Thus, this loop is more flexible than the equivalent region in the other LRC receptors. Since the predicted N-linked glycosylation site (Asn116) was located on the disordered AB loop in D2, the attached sugar moiety might be expected to be very mobile (Fig. 1A). The polyproline II helix located in the FG loop of each domain was observed in LILRA5, as in KIRs, NKp46, FcαR, and the cytokine receptors (28Bravo J. Staunton D. Heath J.K. Jones E.Y.

LILRA5 included only one 310 helix between the E and F strands in D1, whereas the other structurally characterized LILRs, LILRB1 and LILRB2, contain three and five 310 helices, respectively.Comparison of LRC Receptor Ligand Binding Sites—The amino acid sequence identity between LILRA5 and LILRB1/LILRB2 (59%/55%) is lower than those among the Group 1 receptors (LILRA1/A2/A3/B1/B2) (79-88%) (Fig. 2), but still high enough to show basically the same overall structural fold as observed above. Unexpectedly, however, LILRA5 receptor has significant structural differences compared with LILRB1 (4Willcox B.E. Thomas L.M. Bjorkman P.J. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 913-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and LILRB2 (27Willcox B.E. Thomas L.M. Chapman T.L. Heikema A.P. West Jr., A.P. Bjorkman P.J. BMC Struct. Biol. 2002; 2: 6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). First, there is a β strand, the C′ strand in D1 of LILRA5, where the LILRB1 and LILRB2 structures have a 310 helix (Fig. 3A, left). It is of note that this region (amino acid residues 41-49) is directly involved in the recognition of the α3 domain of MHCIs in LILRB1 and LILRB2 (4Willcox B.E. Thomas L.M. Bjorkman P.J. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 913-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). 5M. Shiroishi, K. Kuroki, L. Rasubala, D. Kohda, and K. Maenaka, unpublished result. These changes would be likely to inhibit MHCI binding to LILRA5 (Fig. 3). The comparison between LILRA5 and LILRB1 structures showed that LILRB1 has an ordered hydrophobic core comprising Leu37, Trp46, Ile47, Ile50, Leu54, Phe60, Pro61, Ile62, and Pro63 (Fig. 3C, left). On the contrary, LILRA5 does not have hydrophobic residues, such as Asp47, Asn50, and Ser61 (Fig. 3C, right), possibly preventing the 310 helix formation observed in the LILRB1 structure, but instead rendering the β-sheet formation and providing the hydrophobic deep pocket (red dotted circle in Fig. 3C, right). Furthermore, the combination of Pro43 and Pro45 in LILRA5 (only Pro45 in LILRB1) enabled the acute bent turn to achieve the opposite direction from C to C′ strands forming the extended β-sheet (Fig. 3C, right). Whereas the continuous 310 helix structure in LILRB1 is lined by Leu54 participating in the hydrophobic core described above, Pro54 in LILRA5 stabilizes the turn structure from C′ to E strands (Fig. 3C, left). These residues characteristic in LILRA5 are well conserved in Group 2 LILR members (Fig. 3B). Therefore, they probably adopt the sheet structure similar to LILRA5, supporting the idea that Group 2 LILRs do not have any binding ability to MHCIs.FIGURE 3Structural comparison of MHCI binding sites between LILRBs and LILRA5.

https://openalex.org/W2020453753,"It has been reported that extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules regulate monocyte activation by binding with a 67 kDa nonintegrin laminin receptor (LR). As microgliosis is a pivotal factor in propelling the progress of chronic neurodegeneration in the brain, we hypothesized that LR may regulate the microgliosis and subsequent neurotoxicity. Using 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) -treated C57 mice primary mesencephalic neuron-glia cultures as an in vitro Parkinson's disease (PD) model, we observed that MPP+ treatment increased LR expression only in the mixed neuron-glia but not in microglia-enriched or microglia-depleted cultures, indicating that MPP+-induced increase of LR expression is associated with neuron-microglia interaction. Using confocal microscopic examination, we found that LR was localized in the microglia, which were F4/80 positive. Treatment with the antibody (Ab) against LR (LR-Ab) or YIGSR, a synthetic pentapeptide inhibitor for LR, significantly attenuated the MPP+-increased F4/80 immunoreactivity (24 h) and dopaminergic (DA) neurotoxicity. LR-Ab also attenuated MPP+-increased microglial phagocytotic activity (48 h) and the superoxide production (4 days). Further study demonstrated that exogenous laminin (1-10 microg/ml) treatment induced microglial activation and DA neurotoxicity, in a dose-dependent manner, which was partially attenuated by the LR-Ab. We concluded that by regulating cell-ECM interaction, LR plays important roles in mediating microgliosis and subsequent DA neurotoxicity. Laminin is a potential ligand for activating this LR receptor. This study also suggests that laminin/LR is a potential target for developing new therapeutic drugs against neurodegenerative disorders such as PD."
https://openalex.org/W2005126601,"Assess the effects of cryopreservation (cryo) and vitrification (vitro) on the viscoelastic properties of blood vessels. Human external Iliac artery vessels were harvested from liver organ donors (n=8). In each case the vessel was segmented into 3 equal parts, which were randomly placed in one of 3 categories: Fresh (stored in 4 degrees C UW for 6 h), Cryo (Placed in 10% Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) and slowly frozen to -196 degrees C), or Vitro (Placed in 40% DMEM and rapidly cooled to -196 degrees C). A pulsatile flow circuit was used to perfuse arterial segments at physiological pulse pressure and flow. Intraluminal pressure was measured using a Millar Mikro-tip catheter transducer, and vessel wall motion was determined with duplex ultrasonography coupled with a novel echo-locked vessel wall tracking system. Diametrical compliance (DC), Petersons elastic modulus (Ep), and stiffness index (beta) were then calculated for each of the three groups over 3 mean pressure ranging from 40 to 80 mmHg. The change in the viscous component of arterial wall (lag phase angle, theta) was calculated from hysteresis plots. No significant changes were observed in the elastic properties of fresh and vitrified vessels (P>0.05 for each of DC, Ep, and beta). Similarly, variation in the wall viscosity between fresh and vitrified vessels appeared to be nonsignificant (theta=12.60+/-4.04 vs. 17.60+/-1.14, respectively). In contrast, statistical analysis of results obtained for cryopreserved vessels to the fresh vessels showed significant reduction in elastic parameter values. There was also a significant increase in the phase angle theta of the cryopreserved vessels (theta=24.30+/-6.32; P<0.001) compared with fresh vessel. Results suggest that vitrification maintains both elastic and viscous components of the mechanical properties of vascular grafts, which is positively correlated with their functional patency. In contrast, damage caused during cryopreservation significantly affects the overall tensile strength and elasticity of the vessel (i.e., Ep and beta), the dynamic properties (DC), and appears to significantly affect the viscous component of the vessel wall (theta), which is likely reduce the patency of the graft for transplantation purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2088836160,"The central phosphatase domain of Clostridium thermocellum polynucleotide kinase/phosphatase (CthPnkp) belongs to the dinuclear metallophosphoesterase superfamily. Prior mutational studies of CthPnkp identified 7 individual active site side chains (Asp-187, His-189, Asp-233, Asn-263, His-323, His-376, and Asp-392) required for Ni2+-dependent hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate. Here we find that Mn2+-dependent phosphomonoesterase activity requires two additional residues, Arg-237 and His-264. We report that CthPnkp also converts bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate to p-nitrophenol and inorganic phosphate via a processive two-step mechanism. The Ni2+-dependent phosphodiesterase activity of CthPnkp requires the same seven side chains as the Ni2+-dependent phosphomonoesterase. However, the Mn2+-dependent phosphodiesterase activity does not require His-189, Arg-237, or His-264, each of which is critical for the Mn2+-dependent phosphomonoesterase. Mutations H189A, H189D, and D392N transform the metal and substrate specificity of CthPnkp such that it becomes a Mn2+-dependent phosphodiesterase. The H189E change results in a Mn2+/Ni2+-dependent phosphodiesterase. Mutations H376N, H376D, and D392E convert the enzyme into a Mn2+-dependent phosphodiesterase-monoesterase. The phosphodiesterase activity is strongly stimulated compared with wild-type CthPnkp when His-189 is changed to Asp, Arg-237 is replaced by Ala or Gln, and His-264 is replaced by Ala, Asn, or Gln. Steady-state kinetic analysis of wild-type and mutated enzymes illuminates the structural features that affect substrate affinity and kcat. Our results highlight CthPnkp as an “undifferentiated” diesterase-monoesterase that can evolve toward narrower metal and substrate specificities via alterations of the active site milieu. The central phosphatase domain of Clostridium thermocellum polynucleotide kinase/phosphatase (CthPnkp) belongs to the dinuclear metallophosphoesterase superfamily. Prior mutational studies of CthPnkp identified 7 individual active site side chains (Asp-187, His-189, Asp-233, Asn-263, His-323, His-376, and Asp-392) required for Ni2+-dependent hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate. Here we find that Mn2+-dependent phosphomonoesterase activity requires two additional residues, Arg-237 and His-264. We report that CthPnkp also converts bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate to p-nitrophenol and inorganic phosphate via a processive two-step mechanism. The Ni2+-dependent phosphodiesterase activity of CthPnkp requires the same seven side chains as the Ni2+-dependent phosphomonoesterase. However, the Mn2+-dependent phosphodiesterase activity does not require His-189, Arg-237, or His-264, each of which is critical for the Mn2+-dependent phosphomonoesterase. Mutations H189A, H189D, and D392N transform the metal and substrate specificity of CthPnkp such that it becomes a Mn2+-dependent phosphodiesterase. The H189E change results in a Mn2+/Ni2+-dependent phosphodiesterase. Mutations H376N, H376D, and D392E convert the enzyme into a Mn2+-dependent phosphodiesterase-monoesterase. The phosphodiesterase activity is strongly stimulated compared with wild-type CthPnkp when His-189 is changed to Asp, Arg-237 is replaced by Ala or Gln, and His-264 is replaced by Ala, Asn, or Gln. Steady-state kinetic analysis of wild-type and mutated enzymes illuminates the structural features that affect substrate affinity and kcat. Our results highlight CthPnkp as an “undifferentiated” diesterase-monoesterase that can evolve toward narrower metal and substrate specificities via alterations of the active site milieu. Clostridium thermocellum polynucleotide kinase/phosphatase (Pnkp) 2The abbreviation used is: Pnkp, polynucleotide kinase/phosphatase. is a multifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the phosphorylation of 5′-OH termini of DNA or RNA polynucleotides and the dephosphorylation of 3′-phosphate and 2′-phosphate ribonucleotides (1Martins A. Shuman S. RNA. 2005; 11: 1271-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). CthPnkp also catalyzes an autoadenylylation reaction via a polynucleotide ligase-type mechanism. These characteristics are consistent with a role in end-healing during RNA or DNA repair. The 870-amino acid CthPnkp polypeptide is composed of 3 catalytic domains, which are an N-terminal module that resembles the polynucleotide kinase domain of bacteriophage T4 Pnkp, a central metal-dependent phosphoesterase module, and a C-terminal module that resembles the nucleotidyltransferase domain of polynucleotide ligases (1Martins A. Shuman S. RNA. 2005; 11: 1271-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Homologs of CthPnkp are found in the proteomes of other bacterial genera, including Kinetococcus, Nostoc, Streptomyces, Fusobacterium, Bacillus, Helicobacter, Deinococcus, and Thermobifida. CthPnkp and its relatives differ from other RNA/DNA repair enzymes insofar as the 3′ end-modification component belongs to the binuclear metallophosphoesterase superfamily (2Keppetipola N. Shuman S. RNA. 2006; 12: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The metallophosphoesterase superfamily embraces cellular and viral proteins from all domains of life (3Koonin E.V.

Although possessed of a common active site fold and two-metal mechanism, individual family members differ with respect to their biological functions, metal ligands, and substrate specificities (6Goldberg J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 6349-6360Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The biochemical properties of CthPnkp resemble in many respects those of bacteriophage λ phosphatase. Like λ phosphatase (15Zhuo S. Clemens J.C. Hakes D.J. Barford D. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17754-17761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), CthPnkp is specifically dependent on either nickel or manganese for its activity (1Martins A. Shuman S. RNA. 2005; 11: 1271-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of λ phosphatase showed that the active site contains two manganese ions coordinated directly or via water by aspartate, histidine, and asparagine side chains plus a sulfate ion coordinated by the two metals, an arginine and a histidine, in a position that is proposed to mimic the product complex of the enzyme with phosphate (7Klabunde T. Sträter N. Fröhlich R. Witzel H. Krebs B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 737-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The metal and phosphate ligands in λ phosphatase are strictly conserved in CthPnkp (Fig. 1). A mutational analysis of the phosphatase domain of CthPnkp, guided by its similarity to λ phosphatase, pinpointed 11 residues required for Ni2+-dependent hydrolysis of 2′-AMP and 3′-AMP (2Keppetipola N. Shuman S. RNA. 2006; 12: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The ensemble of essential side chains includes the CthPnkp counterparts (Asp-187, His-189, Asp-233, Arg-237, Asn-263, His-264, His-323, His-376, and Asp-392) of all of the amino acids that form the dinuclear metal-binding site and the phosphate-binding site of λ phosphatase (Fig. 1). However, three residues (Asp-236, His-264, and Arg-237) required for activity with 2′-AMP or 3′-AMP were dispensable for Ni2+-dependent hydrolysis of the non-nucleotide substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate. Whereas Arg-237 coordinates two of the phosphate oxygens and is presumed to stabilize the transition state, His-264 is believed to coordinate the oxygen of the leaving group. Although a mechanism of proton relay to the leaving group via the interacting aspartate and histidine residues has been discussed for the metallophosphoesterase family (4Rusnak F. Mertz P. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1483-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar, 11Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Craig L. Woo T.T. Carney J.P. Tainer J.A.

Soc. 1999; 121: 6382-6390Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the effects of conservative mutations at these positions in CthPnkp are not consistent with general acid catalysis via proton transfer. Specifically, we reported that replacing His-264 with asparagine restored phosphomonoesterase activity with 2′-AMP to wild-type levels and resulted in higher than wild-type activity with p-nitrophenyl phosphate (2Keppetipola N. Shuman S. RNA. 2006; 12: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Similarly, Funhoff et al. (17Funhoff E.G. Wang Y. Andersson G. Averill B.A. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2968-2977Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) reported an increase in the activity of purple acid phosphatase when His-92 (equivalent to His-264 in CthPnkp) was substituted by asparagine, leading them to conclude that the histidine does not act as a general acid. Here we report that CthPnkp is exceptional among known binuclear metallophosphoesterases in that it is adept at hydrolyzing both phosphodiester and phosphomonoester substrates. Exploiting an extensive collection of mutants, we find that the phosphodiesterase and monoesterase reactions rely on overlapping, but different ensembles of active site functional groups. Moreover, the requirements for the phosphodiesterase and monoesterase activities can vary according to the divalent cation cofactor. We describe mutated versions of CthPnkp with altered metal and substrate specificities, including maneuvers that transform an undifferentiated Mn2+/Ni2+-dependent diesterase/monoesterase into an enzyme that only hydrolyzes a phosphodiester in the presence of manganese. Our findings illuminate the reaction mechanism and provide clues to the evolution of biochemical specificity within the metallophosphoesterase superfamily. Materials—p-Nitrophenyl phosphate, bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate, and p-nitrophenol were purchased from Sigma. Malachite green reagent was purchased from BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA. Recombinant CthPnkp—Wild-type CthPnkp and mutated versions with single amino acid substitutions were produced in Escherichia coli as His10-tagged fusions and purified from soluble bacterial extracts by nickel-agarose chromatography as described previously (2Keppetipola N. Shuman S. RNA. 2006; 12: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of p-Nitrophenyl Phosphate and Bis-p-nitrophenyl Phosphate—Reaction mixtures (25 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5 or 8.0), 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate or bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate, divalent cations, and CthPnkp as specified were incubated for 30 min at 45 °C. The reactions were quenched by adding 20 mm EDTA and then 0.9 ml of 1 m Na2CO3. Release of p-nitrophenol was determined by measuring A410 and interpolating the value to a p-nitrophenol standard curve. Phosphate release was measured colorimetrically using the malachite green method (19Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar). The reactions were quenched by adding 20 mm EDTA and then 1 ml of malachite green reagent. Release of phosphate was determined by measuring A620 and interpolating the value to a phosphate standard curve. Active Site Requirements for Mn2+-dependent Phosphomonoesterase Activity of CthPnkp—Purified wild-type CthPnkp and 10 alanine mutants (2Keppetipola N. Shuman S. RNA. 2006; 12: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) were assayed for hydrolysis of 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate in the presence of 0.5 mm manganese. Nine of the alanine mutations either abolished or severely diminished the phosphomonoesterase activity with p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Fig. 2A). Our operational definition of a significant mutational effect is one that reduces activity to <15% of the wild-type value. The residues defined as important for Mn2+-dependent phosphomonoester hydrolysis included all of the predicted direct or water-mediated ligands of the dinuclear metal cluster. The notable finding was that Arg-237 and His-264, which are predicted to contact the phosphate (Fig. 1), were critical for Mn2+-dependent phosphomonoesterase activity. We showed previously that these two residues were not required for Ni2+-dependent hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (2Keppetipola N. Shuman S. RNA. 2006; 12: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It appears that the enzyme relies on different catalytic residues to hydrolyze the same substrate when the metal cofactor is varied. Asp-236, which interacts with His-264, was not important for monoesterase activity in the presence of manganese (Fig. 2A); this finding agrees with the dispensability of this residue for Ni2+-dependent hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate reported previously (2Keppetipola N. Shuman S. RNA. 2006; 12: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The effects of the conservative mutations on the Mn2+-dependent hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate are shown in Fig. 2B. Metal binding residues Asp-187, His-189, Asn-263, and His-323 were strictly essential, i.e. conservative replacements of Asp-187 by asparagine or glutamate, Asn-263 by aspartate or glutamine, and His-189 and His-323 by asparagine or glutamine failed to revive activity. These results agree with the strict essentiality of Asp-187, His-189, Asn-263, and His-323 for p-nitrophenyl phosphate hydrolysis in the presence of nickel (2Keppetipola N. Shuman S. RNA. 2006; 12: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The findings that conservative mutations H376N and D392E restored activity to 70 and 56% of the wild-type level, respectively (Fig. 2B), were surprising, because both of these mutations abolished hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate in the presence of nickel (2Keppetipola N. Shuman S. RNA. 2006; 12: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). His-376 is predicted to coordinate Mn2 via Nδ (Fig. 1). Asparagine is partially isosteric with histidine, particularly with respect to Nδ. The fact that CthPnkp is active in the presence of Mn2+ when His-376 is replaced by Asn but inert when glutamine (a potential isostere of histidine Nϵ) is introduced signifies that (i) the predicted atomic contacts are likely correct, and (ii) the CthPnkp is clearly more tolerant of a conservative substitution when divalent ion site 2 is occupied by manganese instead of nickel. Asp-392 is predicted to make a water-mediated contact to Mn1 of the dinuclear metal cluster (Fig. 1). Whereas D392E was active as a Mn2+-dependent phosphomonoesterase, D392N was defective (6% of wild-type; Fig. 2B). These results highlight the importance of the carboxylate functional group at position 392 and the flexibility of the active site in accommodating the larger glutamate side chain when the resident metal is manganese but not nickel. The same theme emerges from the finding that replacing Asp-233 (which binds both metals) with glutamate restored Mn2+-dependent monoesterase activity to 18% that of wild type, whereas the asparagine mutant was severely defective (Fig. 2B). The D233E mutation abolished p-nitrophenyl phosphate hydrolysis in the presence of nickel (2Keppetipola N. Shuman S. RNA. 2006; 12: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The essential function of His-264 in Mn2+-dependent hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate could be fulfilled by asparagine but not glutamine (Fig. 2B). We had noted previously that glutamine at position 264 was also detrimental to the Ni2+-dependent reaction (2Keppetipola N. Shuman S. RNA. 2006; 12: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The present results reinforce our inferences that (i) His-264 does not serve as an obligate proton donor to the leaving group during the monoesterase reaction no matter what the divalent cation, and (ii) Asn might substitute for His-264 by coordinating a water that helps expel the leaving group (2Keppetipola N. Shuman S. RNA. 2006; 12: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Whereas Asp-236, which is predicted to contact His-264, is not essential for Mn2+-dependent cleavage of p-nitrophenyl phosphate and can be functionally replaced by Asn with no effect on activity (Fig. 2B), the Glu change reduced function to 13% of wild-type, implying a steric constraint on this side chain. The conservative change of Arg-237 to lysine resulted in a partial restoration of activity (18% of wild type), but the glutamine change had no salutary effect (3% of wild type). We surmise that positive charge at this position is critical for Mn2+-dependent activity and that a bidentate interaction of the arginine, analogous to that seen in Fig. 1, is optimal. These results are in contrast to the structure-activity relationships for Ni2+-dependent hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate whereby R237Q displayed an even higher kcat than did wild-type CthPnkp, whereas the turnover number of the R237K mutant was only 13% that of the wild-type value (2Keppetipola N. Shuman S. RNA. 2006; 12: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, CthPnkp relies on different contributions from the side chain at position 237 when it operates as a phosphomonoesterase with manganese versus nickel. We determined the steady-state kinetic parameters for Mn2+-dependent hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate. Formation of p-nitrophenol by wild-type CthPnkp displayed a hyperbolic dependence on the concentration of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (not shown). From a double-reciprocal plot, we calculated a Km value of 12 mm and a kcat of 1850 min-1 (Table 1). (The kinetic parameters for the Ni2+-dependent reaction of wild-type Cth-Pnkp were: Km 2.4 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate; kcat 818 min-1 (2Keppetipola N. Shuman S. RNA. 2006; 12: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar)). Kinetic parameters were also determined for several mutant proteins that displayed activity in the screening assays (Table 1). The kcat values for D236A (575 min-1), D236N (2300 min-1), and D236E (113 min-1) confirmed the inferences from single-point assays that the Asp is dispensable for the chemistry of p-nitrophenyl phosphate hydrolysis, but activity is suppressed by introduction of the bulky glutamate side chain. The conservative R237K change elicited a 12-fold decrement in kcat for Mn2+-dependent hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (150 min-1) but had little effect on substrate binding (Km 13 mm). The H264N change resulted in a significant increase in turnover number compared with wild-type (to 8800 min-1) accompanied by an increase in the Km for substrate (to 75 mm). H264N caused a similar increase in kcat in the presence of nickel, albeit with no penalty in substrate affinity (2Keppetipola N. Shuman S. RNA. 2006; 12: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The H376N and D392E mutations increased the affinity for p-nitrophenyl phosphate by an order of magnitude (Km values of 1.0 and 1.3 mm, respectively) accompanied by decreases in kcat to 315 and 205 min-1, respectively. It appears that conservative changes in the Mn2+ coordination complexes can enhance the binding of the substrate, presumably via influencing the direct metal-phosphate contacts depicted in Fig. 1.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters for hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate with Mn2+ Reaction mixtures (25 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm MnCl2, increasing concentrations (0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, or 15 mm) of p-nitrophenyl phosphate, and a fixed amount (between 0.016 and 2 μg) of one of the indicated CthPnkp proteins were incubated for 15 min at 45 °C. p-Nitrophenol production was plotted as a function of substrate concentration, and then Km and kcat values were calculated from double-reciprocal plots of the data.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15696-15704Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). CthPnkp is exceptional in that we find it has robust activity with either of these generic substrates. CthPnkp-catalyzed release of p-nitrophenol from 10 mm bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate required a divalent cation that could be either manganese or nickel (Fig. 3). A metal titration experiment revealed that activity was optimal at 0.5 mm concentrations of either Ni2+ or Mn2+, with manganese being the superior cofactor (data not shown). Activity was optimal at pH 8.0 in the presence of either Ni2+ or Mn2+ and declined sharply at pH ≤6.5 (data not shown). Magnesium, calcium, cobalt, cadmium, copper, and zinc (at 0.5 mm concentration) were either inactive or much less active than manganese (Fig. 3). A mixing experiment was performed in which reactions containing 0.5 mm manganese were supplemented with 0.5 mm concentrations of each of the other divalent cations. Whereas nickel, magnesium, and calcium were without effect, cobalt, cadmium, copper, and zinc suppressed phosphodiesterase activity (Fig. 3). A simple interpretation of these results is that copper, cobalt, cadmium, and zinc compete with manganese for one or both sites in the binuclear metal cluster to generate a catalytically impaired metalloenzyme, whereas magnesium and calcium do not compete well with manganese for the metal-binding sites. We surveyed the collection of 10 alanine mutants for their ability to hydrolyze bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate in the presence of Mn2+ (Fig. 4A) and Ni2+ (Fig. 4B). Six side chains were essential for the phosphodiesterase reaction irrespective of the metal cofactor: Asp-187, Asp-233, Asn-263, His-323, His-376, and Asp-392. All six of these essential residues are involved in metal coordination (Fig. 1). Three side chains, Asp-236, Arg-237, and His-264, were not only dispensable for phosphodiesterase activity with either Mn2+ or Ni2+, but the D236A, R237A, and H264A mutants displayed even higher phosphodiesterase activity than did wild-type CthPnkp (Fig. 4). The retention of full Mn2+-dependent phosphodiesterase activity by the R237A and H264A proteins contrasts sharply with their severe defects in Mn2+-dependent phosphomonoester hydrolysis (Fig. 2A). Finally, the finding that His-189 was essential for phosphodiester hydrolysis in the presence of Ni2+ but dispensable when Mn2+ was the metal cofactor (Fig. 4A), was mostsurprisinggiventhattheH189AchangeabolishedMn2+-dependent phosphomonoesterase activity (Fig. 2A). We infer that CthPnkp relies on different enzymic functional groups to hydrolyze phosphodiester versus phosphomonoester substrates. Structure-Function Relationships for CthPnkp Phosphodiesterase Activity—Conservative mutants were assayed for Mn2+ and Ni2+-dependent phosphodiesterase activity with 10 mm bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Fig. 5). The Ni2+-dependent phosphodiesterase tolerated no conservative substitutions at any of the seven metal binding residues deemed essential by the alanine scan (Fig. 5B). Thus, the metal-binding site of CthPnkp lacks plasticity in the presence of Ni2+. In contrast, the Mn2+-dependent phosphodiesterase activity was restored when the metal ligand His-376 was replaced by asparagine (Fig. 5A), echoing the findings for restoration of Mn2+-phosphomonoesterase function by this change (Fig. 2B). Replacing Asp-392 with either glutamate or asparagine restored manganese-dependent phosphodiesterase activity to more than twice the level of the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 5A). The gain of phosphodiesterase function by D392N recapitulated the effect seen on the phosphomonoesterase (Fig. 2B), but the salutary effects of the D392E change were specific to the phosphodiesterase. Whereas the removal of the metal binding His-189 side chain in the alanine mutant did not affect Mn2+-phosphodiesterase activity, the conservative substitutions with Asn and Gln reduced activity to 7 and 30% of the wild-type value, respectively (Fig. 5A). Further studies of the role of His-189 will be presented below. The H264N change resulted in greater than wild-type phosphodiesterase activity with either metal (Fig. 5), consistent with the effects of the H264A mutation (Fig. 4). The H264Q change elicited a gain of function for Mn2+-phosphodiesterase (Fig. 5A), which was opposite to the strongly deleterious effect on the Mn2+-phosphomonoesterase activity seen in Fig. 2B. The conservative lysine and glutamine substitutions for Arg-237 also resulted in greater than wild-type phosphodiesterase activity, in keeping with the gains of function observed for R237A. The R237Q gain of function for Mn2+-phosphodiesterase was contrary to the profound decrease in its Mn2+-phosphomonoesterase function. In a similar vein, the D236E protein had greater than wild-type Mn2+-phosphodiesterase activity, although it was defective in Mn2+-dependent hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate. These results reinforce the theme that the diesterase and monoesterase reactions depend on distinct active site functional groups. Kinetic Parameters for Ni2+-dependent Hydrolysis of Bis-p-nitrophenyl Phosphate—The Ni2+-dependent hydrolysis of bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate to p-nitrophenol displayed a hyperbolic dependence on substrate concentration (not shown). From a double-reciprocal plot, we calculated a Km value of 6.3 mm bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate and a kcat of 102 min-1 (Table 2). Kinetic parameters were determined for proteins mutated at residues Asp-236, Arg-237, and His-264. The most striking findings were that the R237A and R237Q changes increased kcat by factors of 11 (1160 min-1) and 19 (1980 min-1), respectively, accompanied by 3-fold decrements in substrate affinity (Km 18 mm). In contrast, the R237K change exerted more modest (2-fold) effects in weakening substrate affinity (Km 12 mm) and enhancing turnover (218 min-1) for the phosphodiesterase reaction. These results contrast with previous kinetic analysis of the Ni2+-phosphomonoesterase reaction, which showed that the R237A and R237K mutations reduced kcat to 43 and 13% of the wild-type value, respectively (2Keppetipola N.

The values in the table are averages from two independent substrate titration experiments.ProteinKmkcatmmmin—1Wild type6.3 ± 0.1102 ± 5D236A1.6 ± 0.25152 ± 1D236N2.2 ± 0.25560 ± 57R237A18 ± 1.81160 ± 50R237K12 ± 0.65218 ± 24R237Q18 ± 11980 ± 75H264A3.4 ± 0.451080 ± 160H264N9.6 ± 1.4720 ± 110H264Q11 ± 1.255 ± 4 Open table in a new tab Whereas the H264A and H264N changes stimulated kcat for phosphodiesterase 11-fold (1080 min-1) and 7-fold (720 min-1), respectively, with relatively little impact on Km for bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate, H264Q reduced turnover to about half (55 min-1) the wild-type level. The enhancement of phosphodiesterase kcat by H264N agrees with prior kinetic data for the Ni2+-phosphomonoesterase reaction, yet the results diverge for H264A, which reduced kcat for Ni2+-phosphomonoesterase to half that of the wild-type value (2Keppetipola N.

https://openalex.org/W2118345088,"In this study we investigated whether the expression of N-terminal myosin light chain-1 (MLC-1) peptides could improve the intrinsic contractility of the whole heart. We generated transgenic rats (TGR) that overexpressed minigenes encoding the N-terminal 15 amino acids of human atrial MLC-1 (TGR/hALC-1/1-15, lines 7475 and 3966) or human ventricular MLC-1 (TGR/hVLC-1/1-15, lines 6113 and 6114) isoforms in cardiomyocytes. Synthetic N-terminal peptides revealed specific actin binding, with a significantly (P<0.01) lower dissociation constant (K(D)) for the hVLC-1/1-15-actin complex compared with the K(D) value of the hALC-1/1-15-actin complex. Using synthetic hVLC-1/1-15 as a TAT fusion peptide labeled with the fluorochrome TAMRA, we observed specific accumulation of the N-terminal MLC-1 peptide at the sarcomere predominantly within the actin-containing I-band, but also within the actin-myosin overlap zone (A-band) in intact adult cardiomyocytes. For the first time we show that the expression of N-terminal human MLC-1 peptides in TGR (range: 3-6 muM) correlated positively with significant (P<0.001) improvements of the intrinsic contractile state of the isolated perfused heart (Langendorff mode): systolic force generation, as well as the rates of both force generation and relaxation, rose in TGR lines that expressed the transgenic human MLC-1 peptide, but not in a TGR line with undetectable transgene expression levels. The positive inotropic effect of MLC-1 peptides occurred in the absence of a hypertrophic response. Thus, expression of N-terminal domains of MLC-1 represent a valuable tool for the treatment of the failing heart."
https://openalex.org/W2054509185,"The functional and structural consequences of a mutation of the DNA intercalating residue of HincII, Q138F, are presented. Modeling has suggested that the DNA intercalation by Gln-138 results in DNA distortions potentially used by HincII in indirect readout of its cognate DNA, GTYRAC (Y = C or T, R = A or G) (Horton, N. C., Dorner, L. F., and Perona, J. J. (2002) Nat. Struct. Biol. 9, 42-47). Kinetic data presented here indicate that the mutation of glutamine 138 to phenylalanine (Q138F) results in a change in sequence specificity at the center two base pairs of the cognate recognition site. We show that the preference of HincII for cutting, but not binding, the three cognate sites differing in the center two base pairs has been altered by the mutation Q138F. Five new crystal structures are presented including Q138F HincII bound to GTTAAC and GTCGAC both with and without Ca2+ as well as the structure of wild type HincII bound to GTTAAC. The Q138F HincII/DNA structures show conformational changes in the protein, bound DNA, and at the protein-DNA interface, consistent with the formation of adaptive complexes. Analysis of these structures and the effect of Ca2+ binding on the protein-DNA interface illuminates the origin of the altered specificity by the mutation Q138F in the HincII enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2073271796,"We describe an inducible genetic model for degeneration of midbrain dopaminergic neurons in adults. In previous studies, knock-in mice expressing hypersensitive M2 domain Leu9'Ser (L9'S) alpha4 nicotinic receptors (nAChR) at near-normal levels displayed dominant neonatal lethality and dopaminergic deficits in embryonic midbrain, because the hypersensitive nAChR is excitotoxic. However, heterozygous L9'S mice that retain the neomycin resistance cassette (neo) in a neighboring intron express low levels of the mutant allele (approximately 25% of normal levels), and these neo-intact mice are therefore viable and fertile. The neo cassette is flanked by loxP sites. In adult animals, we locally injected helper-dependent adenovirus (HDA) expressing cre recombinase. Local excision of the neo cassette, via cre-mediated recombination, was verified by genomic analysis. In L9'S HDA-cre injected animals, locomotion was reduced both under baseline conditions and after amphetamine application. There was no effect in L9'S HDA-control treated animals or in wild-type (WT) littermates injected with either virus. Immunocytochemical analyses revealed marked losses (> 70%) of dopaminergic neurons in L9'S HDA-cre injected mice compared to controls. At 20-33 days postinjection in control animals, the coexpressed marker gene, yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), was expressed in many neurons and few glial cells near the injection, emphasizing the neurotropic utility of the HDA. Thus, HDA-mediated gene transfer into adult midbrain induced sufficient functional expression of cre in dopaminergic neurons to allow for postnatal deletion of neo. This produced increased L9'S mutant nAChR expression, which in turn led to nicotinic cholinergic excitotoxicity in dopaminergic neurons."
