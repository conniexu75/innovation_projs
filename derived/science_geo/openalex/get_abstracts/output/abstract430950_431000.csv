https://openalex.org/W2037034031,"Addressing a Burning Issue Complete combustion of methane is required in order to avoid the unproductive emission of this greenhouse gas into the atmosphere. Palladium catalysts can help to promote complete combustion, but high-temperature operating conditions also promote aggregation of catalyst particles (“sintering”) that lowers their surface area and overall activity. Cargnello et al. (p. 713 ; see the Perspective by Farrauto ) report that cerium oxide–coated Pd catalyst particles could be fully dispersed on an alumina surface prepared with a hydrophobic coating. This treatment resisted Pd sintering up to temperatures of 800°C, and also enabled complete combustion of methane to occur at temperatures as low as 400°C."

Although evidence suggests that populations of cortical neurons synchronize their activity to preferentially transmit information about attentional priorities, it is unclear how cortical synchrony across a network is accomplished. Based on its anatomical connectivity with the cortex, we hypothesized that the pulvinar, a thalamic nucleus, regulates cortical synchrony. We mapped pulvino-cortical networks within the visual system, using diffusion tensor imaging, and simultaneously recorded spikes and field potentials from these interconnected network sites in monkeys performing a visuospatial attention task. The pulvinar synchronized activity between interconnected cortical areas according to attentional allocation, suggesting a critical role for the thalamus not only in attentional selection but more generally in regulating information transmission across the visual cortex."

However, a substantial part of the annual flu burden is caused by two cocirculating, antigenically distinct lineages of influenza B viruses. Here, we report human monoclonal antibodies, CR8033, CR8071, and CR9114, that protect mice against lethal challenge from both lineages. Antibodies CR8033 and CR8071 recognize distinct conserved epitopes in the head region of the influenza B hemagglutinin (HA), whereas CR9114 binds a conserved epitope in the HA stem and protects against lethal challenge with influenza A and B viruses. These antibodies may inform on development of monoclonal antibody-based treatments and a universal flu vaccine for all influenza A and B viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2031171042,"Cycling Down The Mid-Pleistocene Transition, which lasted from approximately 1.25 million to 700 thousand years ago, was a period during which the dominant periodicity of Earth's climate cycles inexplicably changed from 41 thousand to 100 thousand years. This change is clearly apparent in the oxygen isotopic composition of many calcifying marine organisms, but changes in both ice volume and temperature affect the signal, and so exactly what the signal means has remained unclear. Elderfield et al. (p. 704 ; see the Perspective by Clark ) separated these two effects by measuring both the oxygen isotopic makeup and the Mg/Ca (a proxy that reflects changes in temperature only) of certain benthic foraminifera. The findings reveal the contributions of ice volume and temperature to glacial cycles, suggest when and why the Mid-Pleistocene Climate Transition occurred, and clarify how carbon is lost from the ocean-atmosphere during deglaciations but also changes because of ocean circulation."
https://openalex.org/W2061216116,"Metals are infinitely recyclable in principle, but in practice, recycling is often inefficient or essentially nonexistent because of limits imposed by social behavior, product design, recycling technologies, and the thermodynamics of separation. We review these topics, distinguishing among common, specialty, and precious metals. The most beneficial actions that could improve recycling rates are increased collection rates of discarded products, improved design for recycling, and the enhanced deployment of modern recycling methodology. As a global society, we are currently far away from a closed-loop material system. Much improvement is possible, but limitations of many kinds—not all of them technological—will preclude complete closure of the materials cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2103775384,"Optogenetic activation of parvalbumin-expressing versus other classes of interneurons is found to have distinct effects on the response properties of individual and populations of excitatory cells, as well as on visual behaviour in awake mice, providing evidence that this specific interneuron subtype has a unique role in visual coding and perception. Cortical networks consist of a range of neuronal cells, including multiple classes of inhibitory interneurons. Intracortical inhibition is essential for normal brain function, but little is known about the specific roles of the neuronal subtypes. Two independent papers from the groups of Mriganka Sur and Yang Dan explore the functional consequences of activating different classes of interneurons in the mouse visual cortex. Using a variety of techniques, both papers demonstrate that activating parvalbumin-expressing versus other classes of interneurons has distinct effects on the response properties of individual excitatory cells, as well as on populations of these cells. The paper from Dan's group also finds effects on visual behaviour in awake mice. Inhibitory interneurons are essential components of the neural circuits underlying various brain functions. In the neocortex, a large diversity of GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) interneurons has been identified on the basis of their morphology, molecular markers, biophysical properties and innervation pattern1,2,3. However, how the activity of each subtype of interneurons contributes to sensory processing remains unclear. Here we show that optogenetic activation of parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons in the mouse primary visual cortex (V1) sharpens neuronal feature selectivity and improves perceptual discrimination. Using multichannel recording with silicon probes4,5 and channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-mediated optical activation6, we found that increased spiking of PV+ interneurons markedly sharpened orientation tuning and enhanced direction selectivity of nearby neurons. These effects were caused by the activation of inhibitory neurons rather than a decreased spiking of excitatory neurons, as archaerhodopsin-3 (Arch)-mediated optical silencing7 of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIα (CAMKIIα)-positive excitatory neurons caused no significant change in V1 stimulus selectivity. Moreover, the improved selectivity specifically required PV+ neuron activation, as activating somatostatin or vasointestinal peptide interneurons had no significant effect. Notably, PV+ neuron activation in awake mice caused a significant improvement in their orientation discrimination, mirroring the sharpened V1 orientation tuning. Together, these results provide the first demonstration that visual coding and perception can be improved by increased spiking of a specific subtype of cortical inhibitory interneurons."
https://openalex.org/W2124196462,"Brain circuits process information through specialized neuronal subclasses interacting within a network. Revealing their interplay requires activating specific cells while monitoring others in a functioning circuit. Here we use a new platform for two-way light-based circuit interrogation in visual cortex in vivo to show the computational implications of modulating different subclasses of inhibitory neurons during sensory processing. We find that soma-targeting, parvalbumin-expressing (PV) neurons principally divide responses but preserve stimulus selectivity, whereas dendrite-targeting, somatostatin-expressing (SOM) neurons principally subtract from excitatory responses and sharpen selectivity. Visualized in vivo cell-attached recordings show that division by PV neurons alters response gain, whereas subtraction by SOM neurons shifts response levels. Finally, stimulating identified neurons while scanning many target cells reveals that single PV and SOM neurons functionally impact only specific subsets of neurons in their projection fields. These findings provide direct evidence that inhibitory neuronal subclasses have distinct and complementary roles in cortical computations."
https://openalex.org/W2071233437,"Within the Landau paradigm of continuous phase transitions, ordered states of matter are characterized by a broken symmetry. Although the broken symmetry is usually evident, determining the driving force behind the phase transition is often a more subtle matter due to coupling between otherwise distinct order parameters. In this paper we show how measurement of the divergent nematic susceptibility of an iron pnictide superconductor unambiguously distinguishes an electronic nematic phase transition from a simple ferroelastic distortion. These measurements also reveal an electronic nematic quantum phase transition at the composition with optimal superconducting transition temperature."

https://openalex.org/W1997654862,"Current on Demand Deep brain electrical stimulation can be a successful therapy in Parkinson's disease, in depression, and in several other psychiatric diseases, especially in drug-resistant cases. Unfortunately, chronic, continuous stimulation is associated with multiple side effects. This could be alleviated by delivering the electrical perturbation only when it is necessary, using closed-loop stimulation. Such an approach is essential for epilepsy, where seizures occur very rarely but with serious consequences. In a rat model for epilepsy, Berényi et al. (p. 735 ) prevented seizures by transcranial electrical stimulation using a closed-loop system. Transcranial electrical stimulation was highly effective and reduced seizure duration, on average, by 60 %."
https://openalex.org/W1989561383,"De-ubiquitinating enzyme BAP1 is mutated in a hereditary cancer syndrome with increased risk of mesothelioma and uveal melanoma. Somatic BAP1 mutations occur in various malignancies. We show that mouse Bap1 gene deletion is lethal during embryogenesis, but systemic or hematopoietic-restricted deletion in adults recapitulates features of human myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Knockin mice expressing BAP1 with a 3xFlag tag revealed that BAP1 interacts with host cell factor-1 (HCF-1), O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT), and the polycomb group proteins ASXL1 and ASXL2 in vivo. OGT and HCF-1 levels were decreased by Bap1 deletion, indicating a critical role for BAP1 in stabilizing these epigenetic regulators. Human ASXL1 is mutated frequently in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) so an ASXL/BAP1 complex may suppress CMML. A BAP1 catalytic mutation found in a MDS patient implies that BAP1 loss of function has similar consequences in mice and humans."
https://openalex.org/W2008239861,"Generating the Cortex During development of the cerebral cortex, radial glial neural progenitor cells generate layer-specific subtypes of excitatory neurons in a defined temporal sequence, in which deep layers are formed before upper layers. The prevailing model for cortical neurogenesis over the last 20 years has been the common progenitor model, which proposes that the neurogenic potential of the radial glial cell is progressively restricted over time. In contrast to this model, Franco et al. (p. 746 ) now show that, in mice, two radial glial cell subtypes appear to be specified at the onset of cortical development: one for neurons of the evolutionarily older lower cortical layers and a second for the upper cortical layers that are present in placental mammals and are enlarged in primates, especially humans."

Their reuse should be included in future sustainable development plans, but the potential impacts on a number of environmental processes are highly variable and must be thoroughly assessed. The chemical composition and geotechnical properties of the source rock determine which uses are most appropriate and whether reuse is economically feasible. If properly evaluated, mining waste can be reused to reextract minerals, provide additional fuel for power plants, supply construction materials, and repair surface and subsurface land structures altered by mining activities themselves."

https://openalex.org/W2066210642,"The functions of sleep remain elusive. Extensive evidence suggests that sleep performs restorative processes that sustain waking brain performance. An alternative view proposes that sleep simply enforces adaptive inactivity to conserve energy when activity is unproductive. Under this hypothesis, animals may evolve the ability to dispense with sleep when ecological demands favor wakefulness. Here, we show that male pectoral sandpipers (Calidris melanotos), a polygynous Arctic breeding shorebird, are able to maintain high neurobehavioral performance despite greatly reducing their time spent sleeping during a 3-week period of intense male-male competition for access to fertile females. Males that slept the least sired the most offspring. Our results challenge the view that decreased performance is an inescapable outcome of sleep loss."

https://openalex.org/W2041958543,"Innate defense regulators (IDRs) are synthetic immunomodulatory versions of natural host defense peptides (HDP). IDRs mediate protection against bacterial challenge in the absence of direct antimicrobial activity, representing a novel approach to anti-infective and anti-inflammatory therapy. Previously, we reported that IDR-1018 selectively induced chemokine responses and suppressed pro-inflammatory responses. As there has been an increasing appreciation for the ability of HDPs to modulate complex immune processes, including wound healing, we characterized the wound healing activities of IDR-1018 in vitro. Further, we investigated the efficacy of IDR-1018 in diabetic and non-diabetic wound healing models. In all experiments, IDR-1018 was compared to the human HDP LL-37 and HDP-derived wound healing peptide HB-107. IDR-1018 was significantly less cytotoxic in vitro as compared to either LL-37 or HB-107. Furthermore, administration of IDR-1018 resulted in a dose-dependent increase in fibroblast cellular respiration. In vivo, IDR-1018 demonstrated significantly accelerated wound healing in S. aureus infected porcine and non-diabetic but not in diabetic murine wounds. However, no significant differences in bacterial colonization were observed. Our investigation demonstrates that in addition to previously reported immunomodulatory activities IDR-1018 promotes wound healing independent of direct antibacterial activity. Interestingly, these effects were not observed in diabetic wounds. It is anticipated that the wound healing activities of IDR-1018 can be attributed to modulation of host immune pathways that are suppressed in diabetic wounds and provide further evidence of the multiple immunomodulatory activities of IDR-1018."
https://openalex.org/W2082024566,"Despite extensive research on the trafficking of anandamide (AEA) across cell membranes, little is known about the membrane transport of other endocannabinoids, such as 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). Previous studies have provided data both in favor and against a cell membrane carrier-mediated transport of endocannabinoids, using different methodological approaches. Because AEA and 2-AG undergo rapid and almost complete intracellular hydrolysis, we employed a combination of radioligand assays and absolute quantification of cellular and extracellular endocannabinoid levels. In human U937 leukemia cells, 100 nm AEA and 1 μm 2-AG were taken up through a fast and saturable process, reaching a plateau after 5 min. Employing differential pharmacological blockage of endocannabinoid uptake, breakdown, and interaction with intracellular binding proteins, we show that eicosanoid endocannabinoids harboring an arachidonoyl chain compete for a common membrane target that regulates their transport, whereas other N-acylethanolamines did not interfere with AEA and 2-AG uptake. By combining fatty acid amide hydrolase or monoacyl glycerol lipase inhibitors with hydrolase-inactive concentrations of the AEA transport inhibitors UCM707 (1 μm) and OMDM-2 (5 μm), a functional synergism on cellular AEA and 2-AG uptake was observed. Intriguingly, structurally unrelated AEA uptake inhibitors also blocked the cellular release of AEA and 2-AG. We show, for the first time, that UCM707 and OMDM-2 inhibit the bidirectional movement of AEA and 2-AG across cell membranes.

Moreover, it remains to be elucidated whether AEA, 2-AG, and other endocannabinoids share the same membrane transport mechanism. Another poorly investigated aspect is the process of cellular release subsequent to the biosynthesis of AEA and 2-AG at the inner membrane leaflet (36Di Marzo V. De Petrocellis L. Bisogno T. The biosynthesis, fate, and pharmacological properties of endocannabinoids.Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2005; 1: 147-185Crossref Google Scholar). It has been proposed that endocannabinoids are released directly from the cell membrane, where they are generated, but only few studies imply that a bidirectional membrane transporter could be involved in the release of AEA into the extracellular space (16Ligresti A.

We used the classical radioactivity-based assays as well as a direct gas chromatography (GC)/MS-based analytical quantification of endocannabinoids. Applying this integrated methodology and using diverse combinations of pharmacological tool compounds, we have obtained data that strongly support a carrier-mediated cell membrane transport of AEA and 2-AG in U937 cells. Our results clearly suggest a common putative EMT specific for the eicosanoid endocannabinoids AEA, 2-AG, N-arachidonoyl dopamine (NADA), 2-arachidonyl glyceryl ether (noladin ether; 2-AGE), and O-arachidonoyl ethanolamine (virodhamine). This study also provides evidence that the putative EMT is mechanistically independent from the newly described AEA intracellular carrier proteins and degrading enzymes. Finally, our data strongly suggest that the putative EMT works in a bidirectional manner and also mediates the release of AEA and 2-AG. Although the EMT has not yet been cloned and identified, for the sake of clarity, we use the terms “EMT” and “EMT inhibitor,” implicitly referring to the putative EMT. Overall, our study provides new evidence in favor of a membrane target that regulates the extracellular and intracellular levels of endocannabinoids in an orchestrated manner together with the cytoplasmic carrier proteins and degrading enzymes. anandamide 1- and 2-arachidonoylglycerol, respectively endocannabinoid system fatty acid amide hydrolase monoacyl glycerol lipase N-cyclohexanecarbonyl-pentadecylamine α,β-hydrolase fatty acid-binding protein FAAH-like cytoplasmic AEA transporter endocannabinoid membrane transporter N-arachidonoyl dopamine palmitoylethanolamide oleoylethanlonamide stearoylethanolamide linoleoylethanolamide 2-arachidonyl glyceryl ether phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate phospholipid phosphatidylethanolamine endoplasmic reticulum AEA intracellularbinding protein aquaglyceroporin peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (3′-(aminocarbonyl)[1,1′-biphenyl]-3-yl)-cyclohexylcarbamate N-(3-furanylmethyl)-(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)-eicosatetraenamide (R)-N-(1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl)oleamide 5-[(1,1′-biphenyl]-4-yl)methyl]-N,N-dimethyl-1H-tetrazole-1-carboxamide ((2′-(5-ethyl-3,4-diphenyl-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)(1,1′-biphenyl)-3-yl)oxy)-acetic acid.

Cells were grown in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. The uptake of [ethanolamine-1-3H]AEA (60 Ci/mmol) and [1,2,3-3H]2-AG, (20–40 Ci/mmol) in intact cells was performed by using U937 and PMA-differentiated U937 (macrophage) cells. Briefly, 106 cells were suspended in 500 μl of serum-free medium in silanized plastic tubes and preincubated with different concentrations of inhibitors for 10–30 min at 37 °C, depending on the experiment. Plastic or glass tubes were filled with AquaSilTM siliconizing fluid (ThermoScientific), and after 1 min, the silanizing agent was removed and discarded. The tubes were rinsed with pure methanol and then allowed to dry overnight at room temperature. Combination experiments were performed by co-preincubating the cells with both FAAH and EMT inhibitors. Successively, cells were added with a mixture of either AEA/[3H]AEA to a final concentration of 100 nm or 2-AG/[3H]2-AG to a final concentration of 1 μm and then incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. Time course experiments were performed by incubation of the cells from 30 s to 60 min. In AEA plus 2-AG and AEA and/or 2-AG plus other lipids (endocannabinoids or N-acylethanolamines) combination experiments, the endocannabinoids were co-incubated for 5 min with the cells without preincubation. The uptake process was stopped by transferring the tubes on ice and rapidly centrifuging them at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected (500 μl) and transferred into 1 ml of a methanol/chloroform mixture (1:1, v/v), whereas the pellet was resuspended in ice-cold PBS plus 1% fatty acid-free BSA and centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C (washing step). The washing solution was collected and the radioactivity measured together with the extracellular organic phase. The cell pellet was resuspended in 250 μl of ice-cold PBS and transferred into 500 μl of a methanol/chloroform mixture (1:1, v/v), vortexed vigorously, sonicated in an ice-cold water bath for 5 min, and finally centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The aqueous phase was pooled with the aqueous phase extracted from the supernatant and transferred in a scintillation tube, whereas the lipophilic phase was transferred in a different tube. The radioactivity measured in the pooled aqueous phases represented the amount of [3H]ethanolamine or [3H]glycerol generated by [3H]AEA or [3H]2-AG hydrolysis, respectively. The intracellular and extracellular amount of [3H]AEA and [3H]2-AG as well as the [3H]glycerol and [3H]ethanolamine formation were measured by adding 3 ml of Ultima Gold scintillation liquid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a Packard Tri-Carb 2100 TR scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Data were collected from at least three independent experiments performed in triplicate, and results were expressed as [3H]ethanolamine (or [3H]glycerol) formation and intracellular or extracellular [3H]AEA (or [3H]2-AG) reduction or accumulation in percentage of the vehicle-treated samples. In order to investigate the type of interaction between EMT and FAAH inhibitors, when applied in combination to the cells, we made use of an empirical method previously described by Pöch et al. (45Pöch G. Holzmann S. Quantitative estimation of overadditive and underadditive drug effects by means of theoretical, additive dose-response curves.J. Pharmacol.

This method allows analysis of the combination of increasing concentrations of a compound A (the FAAH inhibitors URB597 and PMSF) in the presence of a fixed concentration of the compound B (the EMT inhibitor UCM707 at 1 μm or OMDM-2 at 5 μm). The construction of the theoretical curves is based upon the assumption that A and B contribute to the overall effect, either interacting on the same target or on two different targets. In the first case, it is assumed that B behaves like A, thus interacting at the same target. This leads to the construction of the theoretical curve for additivity. In this case, B can be seen as a dilution of A, which is equieffective with a certain concentration of A, termed x. Based on this assumption, the expected effects of the combination A + B represent the effects of A + x (where x is the concentration of A that is equieffective to B). As a consequence, the theoretical curve for additivity is constructed by replotting the concentration curve of A to the left of the original curve by a distance x. In line with the definition of the additivity given above, at the highest concentration of A, the Emax reached by the combination A + B does not differ from the one obtained by applying only A. The construction of the theoretical curve for “independent interaction” is based on the assumption that A and B act independently on two distinct targets. This curve is constructed by using Equation 1, EA+B=EA+EB-(EA×EB)(Eq. 1) where the Emax is 1. Thus, the response to A + B is expressed as a fraction of the maximum frequency. If the interaction between A and B is independent, the theoretical curve will appear upward shifted compared with the concentration-effect curve of A. The magnitude of such a shift is determined by the response to B. The independent interaction is also called “functional synergy” (48Pöch G. Reiffenstein R.J. Baer H.P.

There are theoretical models for predicting the masses of yet-to-be-discovered superheavy elements, based on such shell effects, and these models can be tested by studying the shells of known actinide nuclei. The problem is that current mass values determined from studying radioactive decay products have substantial errors. Minaya Ramirez et al. (p. 1207 , published online 9 August; see the Perspective by Bollen ) were able to collect a sufficient number of nuclei of lawrencium and nobelium isotopes in an ion trap to determine their masses directly by mass spectroscopy. These results will be helpful in predicting the heaviest possible element."

Deficiency of C1q is the strongest known risk factor for development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which appears to be related to ensuing impaired clearance of apoptotic material. The objective of the current study was to investigate new ligands for C1q on the surface of apoptotic cells. We revealed that the two phospholipid-binding proteins annexin A2 and A5 are, beside DNA, significant C1q ligands. We furthermore, demonstrated that C1q binds directly to histones exposed on the surface of dying cells but we did not detect significant interaction with phosphatidylserine. The complement inhibitors C4b-binding protein and factor H also interact with dying cells, most likely to decrease complement activation beyond the level of C3 to allow noninflammatory clearance. Despite the fact that C4b-binding protein, factor H, and C1q share some ligands on dying cells, we showed that these three proteins did not compete with one another for binding to apoptotic cells. We additionally demonstrated that the way in which apoptosis is induced influenced both the degree of apoptosis and the binding of C1q. The knowledge, that annexin A2 and A5 act as ligands for C1q on apoptotic cells, sheds new light on the pathophysiology of autoimmune diseases."

So how does a cell know, for example, whether it should grow or mate? Enter Ste5, the prototypical scaffold protein, which binds the set of components from the mating pathway, presumably to sequester them so they can be activated specifically. But Zalatan et al. (p. 1218 , published online 9 August; see the Perspective by Davis ) found something rather different. Ste5 is not just an inert support structure; it apparently has an active role in the regulatory pathway as an allosteric inhibitor of the MAP kinase, Fus3. It only unclamps Fus3 function when a signal unique to the mating pathway brings Ste5 to the cell membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2048292859,"Coastal salt marshes are among Earth's most productive ecosystems and provide a number of ecosystem services, including interception of watershed-derived nitrogen (N) before it reaches nearshore oceans. Nitrogen pollution and climate change are two dominant drivers of global-change impacts on ecosystems, yet their interacting effects at the land-sea interface are poorly understood. We addressed how sea-level rise and anthropogenic N additions affect the salt marsh ecosystem process of nitrogen uptake using a field-based, manipulative experiment. We crossed simulated sea-level change and ammonium-nitrate (NH(4)NO(3))-addition treatments in a fully factorial design to examine their potentially interacting effects on emergent marsh plants in a central California estuary. We measured above- and belowground biomass and tissue nutrient concentrations seasonally and found that N-addition had a significant, positive effect on a) aboveground biomass, b) plant tissue N concentrations, c) N stock sequestered in plants, and d) shoot:root ratios in summer. Relative sea-level rise did not significantly affect biomass, with the exception of the most extreme sea-level-rise simulation, in which all plants died by the summer of the second year. Although there was a strong response to N-addition treatments, salt marsh responses varied by season. Our results suggest that in our site at Coyote Marsh, Elkhorn Slough, coastal salt marsh plants serve as a robust N trap and coastal filter; this function is not saturated by high background annual N inputs from upstream agriculture. However, if the marsh is drowned by rising seas, as in our most extreme sea-level rise treatment, marsh plants will no longer provide the ecosystem service of buffering the coastal ocean from eutrophication."
https://openalex.org/W2151351997,"Background Adaptation to low oxygen by changing gene expression is vitally important for cell survival and tissue development. The sprouting of new blood vessels, initiated from endothelial cells, restores the oxygen supply of ischemic tissues. In contrast to the transcriptional response induced by hypoxia, which is mainly mediated by members of the HIF family, there are only few studies investigating alternative splicing events. Therefore, we performed an exon array for the genome-wide analysis of hypoxia-related changes of alternative splicing in endothelial cells. Methodology/Principal findings Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were incubated under hypoxic conditions (1% O2) for 48 h. Genome-wide transcript and exon expression levels were assessed using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST Array. We found altered expression of 294 genes after hypoxia treatment. Upregulated genes are highly enriched in glucose metabolism and angiogenesis related processes, whereas downregulated genes are mainly connected to cell cycle and DNA repair. Thus, gene expression patterns recapitulate known adaptations to low oxygen supply. Alternative splicing events, until now not related to hypoxia, are shown for nine genes: six which are implicated in angiogenesis-mediated cytoskeleton remodeling (cask, itsn1, larp6, sptan1, tpm1 and robo1); one, which is involved in the synthesis of membrane-anchors (pign) and two universal regulators of gene expression (cugbp1 and max). Conclusions/Significance For the first time, this study investigates changes in splicing in the physiological response to hypoxia on a genome-wide scale. Nine alternative splicing events, until now not related to hypoxia, are reported, considerably expanding the information on splicing changes due to low oxygen supply. Therefore, this study provides further knowledge on hypoxia induced gene expression changes and presents new starting points to study the hypoxia adaptation of endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1992464264,"Interest in forecasting impacts of climate change have heightened attention in recent decades to how animals respond to variation in climate and weather patterns. One difficulty in determining animal response to climate variation is lack of long-term datasets that record animal behaviors over decadal scales. We used radar observations from the national NEXRAD network of Doppler weather radars to measure how group behavior in a colonially-roosting bat species responded to annual variation in climate and daily variation in weather over the past 11 years. Brazilian free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) form dense aggregations in cave roosts in Texas. These bats emerge from caves daily to forage at high altitudes, which makes them detectable with Doppler weather radars. Timing of emergence in bats is often viewed as an adaptive trade-off between emerging early and risking predation or increased competition and emerging late which restricts foraging opportunities. We used timing of emergence from five maternity colonies of Brazilian free-tailed bats in south-central Texas during the peak lactation period (15 June-15 July) to determine whether emergence behavior was associated with summer drought conditions and daily temperatures. Bats emerged significantly earlier during years with extreme drought conditions than during moist years. Bats emerged later on days with high surface temperatures in both dry and moist years, but there was no relationship between surface temperatures and timing of emergence in summers with normal moisture levels. We conclude that emergence behavior is a flexible animal response to climate and weather conditions and may be a useful indicator for monitoring animal response to long-term shifts in climate."

Previously, we have defined a CD44+/CD24-/low mammosphere-forming tumorigenic 493-gene signature in breast cancer. Stat3 was identified as a critical node in self-renewal based on an ongoing lentiviral shRNA screen being conducted in two breast cancer cell lines SUM159 and BT549. In corroborating work, targeting the SH2 domain of Stat3 with a novel small molecule decreased the percentage of cells expressing TIC markers (CD44+/CD24-/low and ALDH+) and mammosphere formation in p-Stat3 overexpressing human breast cancer xenografts in SCID-beige mice. Importantly, we observed a four-fold improvement in the 30-day recurrence-free survival relative to docetaxel alone with the addition of the Stat3 inhibitor in the chemoresistant tumor model. Thus, these findings provide a strong impetus for the development of selective Stat3 inhibitors in order to improve survival in patients with p-Stat3 overexpressing tumors."

In this study using an oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) model in PC12 cells, we show that 2-day pretreatment with green tea polyphenols (GTPP) and their active ingredient, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), protects cells from subsequent OGD/R-induced cell death. A synergistic interaction was observed between GTPP constituents, with unfractionated GTPP more potently preconditioning cells than EGCG. GTPP-induced preconditioning required the 67-kDa laminin receptor (67LR), to which EGCG binds with high affinity. 67LR also mediated the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) via activation of NADPH oxidase. An exogenous ROS-generating system bypassed 67LR to induce preconditioning, suggesting that sublethal levels of ROS are indeed an important mediator in GTPP-induced preconditioning. This role for ROS was further supported by the fact that antioxidants blocked GTPP-induced preconditioning. Additionally, ROS induced an activation and translocation of protein kinase C (PKC), particularly PKCϵ from the cytosol to the membrane/mitochondria, which was also blocked by antioxidants. The crucial role of PKC in GTPP-induced preconditioning was supported by use of its specific inhibitors. Preconditioning was increased by conditional overexpression of PKCϵ and decreased by its knock-out with siRNA. Collectively, these results suggest that GTPP stimulates 67LR and thereby induces NADPH oxidase-dependent generation of ROS, which in turn induces activation of PKC, particularly prosurvival isoenzyme PKCϵ, resulting in preconditioning against cell death induced by OGD/R.

https://openalex.org/W2037975109,"The human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) encodes the rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium channel (I(Kr)) which plays an important role in cardiac repolarization. A reduction or increase in hERG current can cause long or short QT syndrome, respectively, leading to fatal cardiac arrhythmias. The channel density in the plasma membrane is a key determinant of the whole cell current amplitude. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms for the regulation of hERG density at the plasma membrane, we used whole cell voltage clamp, Western blotting, and immunocytochemical methods to investigate the effects of an integral membrane protein, caveolin-3 (Cav3) on hERG expression levels. Our data demonstrate that Cav3, hERG, and ubiquitin-ligase Nedd4-2 interact with each other and form a complex. Expression of Cav3 thus enhances the hERG-Nedd4-2 interaction, leading to an increased ubiquitination and degradation of mature, plasma-membrane localized hERG channels. Disrupting Nedd4-2 interaction with hERG by mutations eliminates the effects of Cav3 on hERG channels. Knockdown of endogenous Cav3 or Nedd4-2 in cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes using siRNA led to an increase in native I(Kr).

https://openalex.org/W2131207309,"The past 50 years has witnessed the emergence of new viral and bacterial pathogens with global effect on human health. The hyperinvasive group A Streptococcus (GAS) M1T1 clone, first detected in the mid-1980s in the United States, has since disseminated worldwide and remains a major cause of severe invasive human infections. Although much is understood regarding the capacity of this pathogen to cause disease, much less is known of the precise evolutionary events selecting for its emergence. We used high-throughput technologies to sequence a World Health Organization strain collection of serotype M1 GAS and reconstructed its phylogeny based on the analysis of core genome single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We demonstrate that acquisition of a 36-kb genome segment from serotype M12 GAS and the bacteriophage-encoded DNase Sda1 led to increased virulence of the M1T1 precursor and occurred relatively early in the molecular evolutionary history of this strain. The more recent acquisition of the phage-encoded superantigen SpeA is likely to have provided selection advantage for the global dissemination of the M1T1 clone. This study provides an exemplar for the evolution and emergence of virulent clones from microbial populations existing commensally or causing only superficial infection."
https://openalex.org/W1966389043,"The effect of smoking cessation on the risk of diabetes has been reported previously. However, it is unknown whether the association is influenced by weight gain and other potential risk factors.The Japan Public Health Center-Based Prospective Study established in 1990 for Cohort I and in 1993 for Cohort II provided data, and 25,875 men and 33,959 women were analyzed. The response rate to the baseline questionnaire was 80.9%, and 68.4% of the respondents participated both the 5- and 10-year follow-up surveys. Smoking cessation was noted during the initial five years and the development of diabetes was reported in the subsequent five years.An increased risk was observed among individuals who newly quit smoking compared with never smokers among men (odds ratio (OR)=1.42, 95% CI=1.03-1.94) and women (OR=2.84, CI=1.53-5.29). The risk of developing diabetes among male new quitters who gained 3 kg or more during the 5-year follow-up did not substantially differ from the risk among male never smokers with less than 3 kg of weight gain or no weight gain, while an increased risk was observed among male new quitters with less or no weight gain (OR=1.46, 95%CI 1.00-2.14). An insignificant increased risk was observed among male new quitters with a family history of diabetes compared with male never smokers with a family history of diabetes. The risk was more than twice as high for male new quitters who used to smoke 25 or more cigarettes per day compared with never smokers (OR=2.15, 95%CI: 1.34-3.47).An increased risk of diabetes was implied among individuals who quit smoking. However, the increased risk was not implied among those who gained weight over the 5-years of follow-up. Those who had major risk factors for diabetes or who smoked heavier had a higher risk."
https://openalex.org/W2067592598,"CP621-652 is a potent HIV-1 fusion inhibitor peptide derived from the C-terminal heptad repeat of gp41. We recently identified that its N-terminal residues Met-626 and Thr-627 adopt a unique hook-like structure (termed M-T hook) thus stabilizing the interaction of the inhibitor with the deep pocket on the N-terminal heptad repeat. In this study, we further demonstrated that the M-T hook structure is a key determinant of CP621-652 in terms of its thermostability and anti-HIV activity. To directly define the structure and function of the M-T hook, we generated the peptide MT-C34 by incorporating Met-626 and Thr-627 into the N terminus of the C-terminal heptad repeat-derived peptide C34. The high resolution crystal structure (1.9 Å) of MT-C34 complexed by an N-terminal heptad repeat-derived peptide reveals that the M-T hook conformation is well preserved at the N-terminal extreme of the inhibitor. Strikingly, addition of two hook residues could dramatically enhance the binding affinity and thermostability of 6-helix bundle core. Compared with C34, MT-C34 exhibited significantly increased activity to inhibit HIV-1 envelope-mediated cell fusion (6.6-fold), virus entry (4.5-fold), and replication (6-fold). Mechanistically, MT-C34 had a 10.5-fold higher increase than C34 in blocking 6-helix bundle formation. We further showed that MT-C34 possessed higher potency against T20 (Enfuvirtide, Fuzeon)-resistant HIV-1 variants. Therefore, this study provides convincing data for our proposed concept that the M-T hook structure is critical for designing HIV-1 fusion inhibitors."

https://openalex.org/W1967907739,"INF2 (inverted formin 2) is a formin protein with unusual biochemical characteristics. As with other formins, the formin homology 2 (FH2) domain of INF2 accelerates actin filament assembly and remains at the barbed end, modulating elongation. The unique feature of INF2 is its ability to sever filaments and enhance depolymerization, which requires the C-terminal region. Physiologically, INF2 acts in the secretory pathway and is mutated in two human diseases, focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. In this study, we investigate the effects of mutating two FH2 residues found to be key in other formins: Ile-643 and Lys-792. Surprisingly, neither mutation abolishes barbed end binding, as judged by pyrene-actin and total internal reflection (TIRF) microscopy elongation assays. The I643A mutation causes tight capping of a subset of filaments, whereas K792A causes slow elongation of all filaments. The I643A mutation has a minor inhibitory effect on polymerization activity but causes almost complete abolition of severing and depolymerization activity. The K792A mutation has relatively small effects on polymerization, severing, and depolymerization. In cells, the K792A mutant causes actin accumulation around the endoplasmic reticulum to a similar extent as wild type, whereas the I643A mutant causes no measurable polymerization. The inability of I643A to induce actin polymerization in cells is explained by its inability to promote robust actin polymerization in the presence of capping protein. These results highlight an important point: it is dangerous to assume that mutation of conserved FH2 residues will have equivalent effects in all formins. The work also suggests that both mutations have effects on the mechanism of processive elongation."
https://openalex.org/W2069672675,"Human memory and naive CD4 T cells can mainly be identified by the reciprocal expression of the CD45RO or CD45RA isoforms. In HIV-1 infection, blood CD45RO memory CD4 T cells are preferentially infected and serve as a major viral reservoir. The molecular mechanism dictating this differential susceptibility to HIV-1 remains largely obscure. Here, we report that the different susceptibility of memory and naive T cells to HIV is not determined by restriction factors such as Apobec3G or BST2. However, we observed a phenotypic distinction between human CD45RO and CD45RA resting CD4 T cells in their cortical actin density and actin dynamics. CD45RO CD4 T cells possess a higher cortical actin density and can be distinguished as CD45RO(+)Actin(high). In contrast, CD45RA T cells are phenotypically CD45RA(+)Actin(low). In addition, the cortical actin in CD45RO memory CD4 T cells is more dynamic and can respond to low dosages of chemotactic induction by SDF-1, whereas that of naive cells cannot, despite a similar level of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 present on both cells. We further demonstrate that this difference in the cortical actin contributes to their differential susceptibility to HIV-1; resting memory but not naive T cells are highly responsive to HIV-mediated actin dynamics that promote higher levels of viral entry and early DNA synthesis in resting memory CD4 T cells. Furthermore, transient induction of actin dynamics in resting naive T cells rescues HIV latent infection following CD3/CD28 stimulation. These results suggest a key role of chemotactic actin activity in facilitating HIV-1 latent infection of these T cell subsets."
https://openalex.org/W2079063725,"RNase R, an important exoribonuclease involved in degradation of structured RNA, is subject to a novel mechanism of regulation. The enzyme is extremely unstable in rapidly growing cells but becomes stabilized under conditions of stress, such as stationary phase or cold shock. RNase R instability results from acetylation which promotes binding of tmRNA-SmpB, two trans-translation factors, to its C-terminal region. Here, we examine how binding of tmRNA-SmpB leads to proteolysis of RNase R. We show that RNase R degradation is due to two proteases, HslUV and Lon. In their absence, RNase R is stable. We also show, using an in vitro system that accurately replicates the in vivo process, that tmRNA-SmpB is not essential, but it stimulates binding of the protease to the N-terminal region of RNase R and that it does so by a direct interaction between the protease and SmpB which stabilizes protease binding. Thus, a sequence of events, initiated by acetylation of a single Lys residue, results in proteolysis of RNase R in exponential phase cells. RNase R in stationary phase or in cold-shocked cells is not acetylated, and thereby remains stable. Such a regulatory mechanism, dependent on protein acetylation, has not been observed previously in bacterial cells."

Optical mapping of cardiac electrophysiology combines high spatiotemporal resolution of anatomy and physiological function with fast and simultaneous data acquisition. If applied to the clinical setting, this could improve both diagnostic potential and therapeutic efficacy of clinical arrhythmia interventions. The aim of this study was to explore this utility in vivo using a rat model. To this aim, we present a single-camera imaging and multiple light-emitting-diode illumination system that reduces economic and technical implementation hurdles to cardiac optical mapping. Combined with a red-shifted calcium dye and a new near-infrared voltage-sensitive dye, both suitable for use in blood-perfused tissue, we demonstrate the feasibility of in vivo multi-parametric imaging of the mammalian heart. Our approach combines recording of electrophysiologically-relevant parameters with observation of structural substrates and is adaptable, in principle, to trans-catheter percutaneous approaches."

The roots of tip links, which couple tip links with the cytoskeleton, supposedly play important roles in withstanding large forces under stimulated conditions. The upper root of the tip link is mainly formed by the cytoplasmic tail of cadherin23 and its actin-anchoring protein harmonin. However, the detailed organization mode of the two proteins that gives rise to a strong upper root remains unclear. Here we show that the exon68-encoded peptide of cadherin23 can either interact with the N-terminal domain (NTD) of harmonin or form a homodimer. We demonstrate that the three harmonin binding sites of cadherin23, namely the NTD-binding motif, the exon68 peptide, and the C-terminal PDZ binding motif, do not synergize with each other in binding to harmonin, instead they facilitate formation of polymeric cadherin23/harmonin complexes. The exon68 peptide can promote the cadherin23/harmonin polymer formation via either binding to harmonin NTD or self-dimerization.

Both cadherin23 and protocadherin15 are usher syndrome I, single-transmembrane adhesion proteins with a long extracellular cadherin repeats followed by a short cytoplasmic tail. Protocadherin15 forms the lower part of tip link, and has been proposed to be coupled with a mechanoelectrical transduction channel to participate in its gating. Cadherin23 assembles the upper part of tip link, and its cytoplasmic tail is anchored to the actin filaments of stereocilia via binding to the actin-binding protein harmonin (9Boëda B. El-Amraoui A.

Deflection of stereocilia bundles induces stretching force on tip links, and the tensile stresses force them to pull open the coupled mechanoelectrical transduction channels and trigger the electrical signal transduction (3Richardson G.P. de Monvel J.B. Petit C. How the genetics of deafness illuminates auditory physiology.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2011; 73: 311-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Although no experimental data are available so far to precisely determine the strength of mechanical forces applied onto a tip link during hair-bundle deflection, biophysical estimates of its stiffness (∼1 mN m−1) indicate that it should withstand forces of >100 pN (10Jaramillo F. Hudspeth A.J. Displacement-clamp measurement of forces exerted by hair bundles during adaptation.FASEB J. 1992; 6 (A516): A516Google Scholar).

In this study, we found that the exon68-encoded peptide can either bind to harmonin NTD or self-dimerize. Furthermore, the three harmonin binding sites of cadherin23, the exon68 peptide, NBM, and PBM, do not synergize with each other in binding to harmonin. Instead these three regions facilitate formation of concentration-dependent, polymeric cadherin23/harmonin complexes. Interestingly, exon68, either via binding to NTD or self-dimerization, can effectively promote the polymeric cadherin23/harmonin complex formation. Considering the special role of tip link as the mechanoelectrical transduction channel gating spring, as well as the specific expression of exon68 in the stereocilia bundle (20Siemens J. Lillo C.

Cadherin 23 is a component of the tip link in hair-cell stereocilia.Nature. 2004; 428: 950-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), we propose that exon68-facilitated cadherin23/harmonin polymer formation may provide a mechanistic explanation for the formation of the sturdy upper tip link root organized by the cdherin23/harmonin/actin filaments network. The coding sequences of the full-length (FL) harmonin-a and NTD (residues 1–97) were PCR-amplified from human Ush1C (NCBI accession number NP_005700.2) and cloned into pET32a or pGEX4T-1 vector. The coding sequence of the cytoplasmic tail of cadherin23(±68) was PCR amplified from human Ush1D and cloned into pET32a vector. Different cadherin23 mutants and fragments were generated using standard PCR-based methods. The GB1-exon68 was generated by fusing the GB1 tag with the exon68-encoded sequence (amino acid sequence: GSLLKVVLEDYLRLKKLFAQRMVQKASSC—HSSISE). For generating the cadherin23(GCN4) chimera, the coding sequence of the GCN4 dimer (amino acid sequence: ARMKQLEDKIEELLSKIYHLENEIARLKKLIGER) is inserted into cadherin23 to replace the exon68 sequence. For the cadherin23(NBM) chimera, the coding sequence of part of the exon68 peptide (amino acid sequence: LKVVLEDYLRLKKL) is replaced with NBM (amino acid sequence: LRAAIQEYDNIAKL). All recombinant proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli cells and purified by using either Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose or GSH-Sepharose affinity chromatography, followed by size exclusion chromatography. The protein samples for NMR studies were concentrated to ∼0.2 mm for titration experiments and ∼0.6 mm for structural determinations in 100 mm potassium phosphate at pH 6.5. NMR spectra were acquired at 30 °C on Varian Inova 500 or 750 MHz spectrometers.

Proteins were loaded onto a Superose 12 10/300 GL column 20 (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA. Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed on a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with an eight-cell rotor at 25 °C. The partial specific volume of different protein samples and the buffer density were calculated using the program SEDNTERP (29Schuck P.

For sedimentation equilibrium experiments, ∼110 μl of cadherin23(+68) at three different concentrations (A280 absorption about 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9, respectively) were loaded into a six-chamber analytical ultracentrifuge cuvette. As a blank, ∼120 μl of protein buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) was also loaded into the adjacent chamber. The experiment was performed on a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with an eight cell rotor under 13,000 rpm at 25 °C. The final sedimentation equilibrium data were analyzed and fitted to a monomer-dimer self-association model to obtain the dimerization Kd constant using the SEDPHAT software (29Schuck P.

All protein samples were in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7.5 plus 500 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA. The titration processes were performed by injecting 10-μl aliquots of the His-tagged cadherin23 cytoplasmic tail (450 μm) into His-tagged full-length harmonin-a (45 μm) at time intervals of 3 min to ensure that the titration curve returned to baseline. The titration data were analyzed with Origin7.0 from Microcal and fitted with a one-site binding model. For the high-speed centrifugation assay, the full-length harmonin-a and cytoplasmic tail of cadherin23 were freshly purified and mixed at 1:1 molar ratio at the final concentration of 45 μm in a buffer composed of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT at pH 7.5 and incubated at 4 °C for 10 min. The samples were centrifuged by an Optima Max-XP ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) with a TLA-55 rotor at 4 °C, 98,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant and pellet were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Previously we found that the α-helix encoded by cadherin23 NBM binds to the solvent-exposed pocket of harmonin NTD through hydrophobic interactions involving Leu-3188, Ile-3192, and Tyr-3195 of NBM (16Pan L. Yan J. Wu L. Zhang M. Assembling stable hair cell tip link complex via multidentate interactions between harmonin and cadherin 23.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 5575-5580Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, deletion of this NBM did not abolish the specific interaction between the cytoplasmic tail of cadherin23(+68) and harmonin NTD, indicating the existence of an additional NTD binding site in the cadherin23 tail (data not shown). Further NMR-based titration studies narrowed this additional NTD binding sequence down to the exon68-encoded region (data not shown). Interestingly, sequence alignment analysis revealed that, for each cadherin23 NBM residue essential for harmonin NTD binding, an identical or highly similar amino acid can be found in the corresponding positions of the exon68-encoded peptide (referred to as the exon68 peptide hereafter, Fig. 1B). Additionally, this exon68 peptide is also predicted to form an α-helix. The above analysis implies that the exon68 peptide may function as a NTD binder. To test this hypothesis, we synthesized the exon68 peptide (SLLKVVLEDYLRLKKLFAQR) and investigated its possible binding to harmonin NTD by titrating 15N-labeled NTD with the peptide. The obvious chemical shift changes of NTD after titrating with the exon68 peptide indicated the specific interaction between exon68 and NTD (Fig. 1C). To investigate whether the exon68 peptide in the intact cadherin23 tail can bind to NTD, we purified the recombinant, entire cytoplasmic tail of cadherin23. Our analytical gel filtration data demonstrated that deletion of NBM from cadherin23(−68) abrogated its interaction with harmonin NTD. In contrast, deletion of NBM from cadherin23(+68) did not disrupt its interaction with harmonin NTD (Fig. 1D), indicating that the exon68 segment of cadherin23 functions as a harmonin NTD binding sequence. Additionally, individual point mutations of the conserved hydrophobic residues within the exon68 region (e.g. L3215Q, L3219Q, and Y3222E) either disrupted or weakened the binding of the exon68 peptide to NTD, further supporting the specific interaction between the exon68 peptide and harmonin NTD (supplemental Fig. S1, A–C). As the control, replacements of Leu-3223, Leu-3225, and Leu-3228, which are aligned with noncrucial residues in NBM (Fig. 1A), individually with Gln, had no obvious effect on its binding to the NTD (supplemental Fig. S1, D–F). To better understand the exon68 peptide/NTD interaction, we intended to solve the structure of the exon68 peptide/NTD complex using NMR spectrometry. First, we fused the exon68 peptide to the C terminus of NTD to get a stable 1:1 complex. However, as it occurred to the NTD/NBM complex (16Pan L. Yan J. Wu L. Zhang M. Assembling stable hair cell tip link complex via multidentate interactions between harmonin and cadherin 23.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 5575-5580Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), the solubility of the exon68 peptide/NTD complex was too low (<0.1 mm) for structure determination by NMR. Following what we did for the NBM/NTD complex (16Pan L. Yan J. Wu L. Zhang M. Assembling stable hair cell tip link complex via multidentate interactions between harmonin and cadherin 23.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 5575-5580Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we substituted Val-3218 with Glu to increase the solubility of the exon68 peptide/NTD complex. And this mutation successfully improved the solubility of the complex to up to 0.5 mm without affecting the overall binding mode of the exon68 peptide and NTD as evidenced by the good overlay of the 1H,15N-HSQC spectra of the NTD complexes formed with the WT peptide and the mutant peptide, respectively (data not shown). We determined the high resolution structure of the exon68/NTD complex by NMR spectroscopy (Table 1). Not surprisingly, in the complex structure the exon68 peptide adopts an α-helical conformation and occupies the same pocket of NTD as NBM does (Fig. 2, A and B). The interaction between the amphipathic exon68 α-helix and NTD buries a total of ∼760 Å2 surface area and is mainly mediated by hydrophobic interactions. Specifically, the hydrophobic side chains of Leu-3215, Val-3217, and Leu-3219 of the exon68 peptide extend into the hydrophobic pocket of the NTD formed by the side chains of Ala-6, Phe-9, Leu-30, Tyr-33, Ile-62, and Leu-65. Notably, the side chain of Val-3217 is deeply embedded in the hydrophobic pocket and completely occluded from the solvent. In addition, the aromatic side chain of exon68 Tyr-3222 inserts into another pocket located at the base of the αA/αB-helix hairpin formed by the hydrophobic side chains of Val-13, Leu-26, and Tyr-27 as well as the aliphatic side chain of Lys-23. The side chain of Tyr-3222 is further stabilized by Arg-10 through a cation-π interaction (Fig. 2C). Additional charge-charge interactions (e.g. between Asp-3221 of exon68 and Arg-7 of NTD) further contribute to the overall complex formation (Fig. 2C).TABLE 1Structural statistics for the family of 20 NMR structures of harmonin NTD in complex with the exon68 peptideStatisticsDistance restraintsIntraresidue (i-j = 0)670Sequential (|i-j| = 1)386Medium range (2 ≤ |i-j| ≤ 4)362Long range(|i-j| ≥ 5)277Hydrogen bonds88Total1783Dihedral angle restraintsΦ69Ψ69Total138Mean root mean square deviations from the experimental restraintsDistance (Å)0.010 ± 0.000Dihedral angle (Å)0.166 ± 0.021Mean root mean square deviations from idealized covalent geometryBond (Å)0.002 ± 0.0000Angle (°)0.355 ± 0.004Improper (°)0.192 ± 0.005Mean energies (kcal mol−1)aNone of the structures exhibits distance violations greater than 0.3 Å or dihedral angle violations greater than 4°.ENOEbThe final values of the square-well NOE and dihedral angle potentials were calculated with force constants of 50 kcal mol−1Å−1 and 200 kcal mol−1rad−1.13.23 ± 0.43EcdihbThe final values of the square-well NOE and dihedral angle potentials were calculated with force constants of 50 kcal mol−1Å−1 and 200 kcal mol−1rad−1.0.23 ± 0.06EL-J−356.77 ± 15.98Ramachandran plotcThe PROCHECK-NMR program (www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/software/PROCHECK/) was used to assess the overall quality of the structures.% Residues in the most favorable regions93.4Additional allowed regions5.7Generously allowed regions0.3Atomic rroot mean square differences (Å)dResidues 3–78 of NTD plus the residues 3214–3226 of the cadherin23 exon68 peptide.Backbone heavy atoms (N, Cα, and C′)0.42Heavy atoms0.97a None of the structures exhibits distance violations greater than 0.3 Å or dihedral angle violations greater than 4°.b The final values of the square-well NOE and dihedral angle potentials were calculated with force constants of 50 kcal mol−1Å−1 and 200 kcal mol−1rad−1.c The PROCHECK-NMR program (www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/software/PROCHECK/) was used to assess the overall quality of the structures.d Residues 3–78 of NTD plus the residues 3214–3226 of the cadherin23 exon68 peptide. Open table in a new tab Because the exon68 peptide and NBM occupy the same NTD pocket, we are curious about which site has a stronger binding affinity. Unfortunately, the synthetic exon68 peptide is highly hydrophobic and not soluble in aqueous buffer for measuring its binding affinity to NTD using various direct binding assays. Fortunately, it is soluble when in complex with NTD. When the exon68 peptide was titrated into the 15N-labeled NTD, the peaks of NTD showed a slow exchange pattern in the NMR spectrum (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). In contrast, titration of the NBM peptide showed a fast exchange pattern (supplemental Fig. S2C). Based on these NMR results, we conclude that the exon68 peptide has a stronger NTD binding affinity than NBM. Superimposing the two complex structures showed that although the o"
https://openalex.org/W1972360063,"The oxidative lesion 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) is removed during base excision repair by the 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (Ogg1). This lesion can erroneously pair with adenine, and the excision of this damaged base by Ogg1 enables the insertion of a guanine and prevents DNA mutation. In this report, we identified and characterized Ogg1 from the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi (TcOgg1), the causative agent of Chagas disease. Like most living organisms, T. cruzi is susceptible to oxidative stress, hence DNA repair is essential for its survival and improvement of infection. We verified that the TcOGG1 gene encodes an 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase by complementing an Ogg1-defective Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain. Heterologous expression of TcOGG1 reestablished the mutation frequency of the yeast mutant ogg1−/− (CD138) to wild type levels. We also demonstrate that the overexpression of TcOGG1 increases T. cruzi sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Analysis of DNA lesions using quantitative PCR suggests that the increased susceptibility to H2O2 of TcOGG1-overexpressor could be a consequence of uncoupled BER in abasic sites and/or strand breaks generated after TcOgg1 removes 8-oxoG, which are not rapidly repaired by the subsequent BER enzymes. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that TcOGG1-overexpressors have reduced levels of 8-oxoG both in the nucleus and in the parasite mitochondrion. The localization of TcOgg1 was examined in parasite transfected with a TcOgg1-GFP fusion, which confirmed that this enzyme is in both organelles. Taken together, our data indicate that T. cruzi has a functional Ogg1 ortholog that participates in nuclear and mitochondrial BER."
https://openalex.org/W1994793365,"Several drugs and natural compounds are known to be highly neurotoxic, triggering epileptic convulsions or seizures, and causing headaches, agitations, as well as other neuronal symptoms. The neurotoxic effects of some of these compounds, including theophylline and ginkgotoxin, have been traced to their inhibitory activity against human pyridoxal kinase (hPL kinase), resulting in deficiency of the active cofactor form of vitamin B₆, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP). Pyridoxal (PL), an inactive form of vitamin B₆ is converted to PLP by PL kinase. PLP is the B₆ vitamer required as a cofactor for over 160 enzymatic activities essential in primary and secondary metabolism. We have performed structural and kinetic studies on hPL kinase with several potential inhibitors, including ginkgotoxin and theophylline. The structural studies show ginkgotoxin and theophylline bound at the substrate site, and are involved in similar protein interactions as the natural substrate, PL. Interestingly, the phosphorylated product of ginkgotoxin is also observed bound at the active site. This work provides insights into the molecular basis of hPL kinase inhibition and may provide a working hypothesis to quickly screen or identify neurotoxic drugs as potential hPL kinase inhibitors. Such adverse effects may be prevented by administration of an appropriate form of vitamin B₆, or provide clues of how to modify these drugs to help reduce their hPL kinase inhibitory effects."

https://openalex.org/W2080614197,"An increase in CNS remyelination and a decrease in CNS inflammation are important steps to halt the progression of multiple sclerosis. Earlier studies have shown that gemfibrozil, a lipid-lowering drug, has anti-inflammatory properties. The current study identified another novel property of gemfibrozil in stimulating the expression of myelin-specific genes (myelin basic protein, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, 2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase, and proteolipid protein (PLP)) in primary human oligodendrocytes, mixed glial cells, and spinal cord organotypic cultures. Although gemfibrozil is a known activator of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α), we were unable to detect PPAR-α in either gemfibrozil-treated or untreated human oligodendrocytes, and gemfibrozil increased the expression of myelin genes in oligodendrocytes isolated from both wild type and PPAR-α(-/-) mice. On the other hand, gemfibrozil markedly increased the expression of PPAR-β but not PPAR-γ. Consistently, antisense knockdown of PPAR-β, but not PPAR-γ, abrogated the stimulatory effect of gemfibrozil on myelin genes in human oligodendrocytes. Gemfibrozil also did not up-regulate myelin genes in oligodendroglia isolated from PPAR-β(-/-) mice. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that gemfibrozil induced the recruitment of PPAR-β to the promoter of PLP and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein genes in human oligodendrocytes. Furthermore, gemfibrozil treatment also led to the recruitment of PPAR-β to the PLP promoter in vivo in the spinal cord of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mice and suppression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis symptoms in PLP-T cell receptor transgenic mice. These results suggest that gemfibrozil stimulates the expression of myelin genes via PPAR-β and that gemfibrozil, a prescribed drug for humans, may find further therapeutic use in demyelinating diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2006283321,"Co-occurrence of closely related species may be achieved in environments with fluctuating dynamics, where competitively inferior species can avoid competition through dispersal. Here we present an experiment in which we compared active dispersal abilities (time until first dispersal, number and gender of dispersive adults, and nematode densities at time of dispersal) in Litoditis marina, a common bacterivorous nematode species complex comprising four often co-occurring cryptic species, Pm I, II, III, and IV, as a function of salinity and food distribution. The experiment was conducted in microcosms consisting of an inoculation plate, connection tube, and dispersal plate. Results show species-specific dispersal abilities with Pm I dispersing almost one week later than Pm III. The number of dispersive adults at time of first dispersal was species-specific, with one dispersive female in Pm I and Pm III and a higher, gender-balanced, number in Pm II and Pm IV. Food distribution affected dispersal: in absence of food in the inoculation plate, all species dispersed after ca four days. When food was available Pm I dispersed later, and at the same time and densities irrespective of food conditions in the dispersal plate (food vs no food), suggesting density-dependent dispersal. Pm III dispersed faster and at a lower population density. Salinity affected dispersal, with slower dispersal at higher salinity. These results suggest that active dispersal in Litoditis marina is common, density-dependent, and with species, gender- and environment-specific dispersal abilities. These differences can lead to differential responses under suboptimal conditions and may help to explain temporary coexistence at local scales."
https://openalex.org/W2034512452,"Zinc activates a specific Zn(2+)-sensing receptor, ZnR/GPR39, and thereby triggers cellular signaling leading to epithelial cell proliferation and survival. Epithelial cells that express ZnR, particularly colonocytes, face frequent changes in extracellular pH that are of physiological and pathological implication. Here we show that the ZnR/GPR39-dependent Ca(2+) responses in HT29 colonocytes were maximal at pH 7.4 but were reduced by about 50% at pH 7.7 and by about 62% at pH 7.1 and were completely abolished at pH 6.5. Intracellular acidification did not attenuate ZnR/GPR39 activity, indicating that the pH sensor of this protein is located on an extracellular domain. ZnR/GPR39-dependent activation of extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 or AKT pathways was abolished at acidic extracellular pH of 6.5. A similar inhibitory effect was monitored for the ZnR/GPR39-dependent up-regulation of Na(+)/H(+) exchange activity at pH 6.5. Focusing on residues putatively facing the extracellular domain, we sought to identify the pH sensor of ZnR/GPR39. Replacing the histidine residues forming the Zn(2+) binding site, His(17) or His(19), or other extracellular-facing histidines to alanine residues did not abolish the pH dependence of ZnR/GPR39. In contrast, replacing Asp(313) with alanine resulted in similar Ca(2+) responses triggered by ZnR/GPR39 at pH 7.4 or 6.5. This mutant also showed similar activation of ERK1/2 and AKT pathways, and ZnR-dependent up-regulation of Na(+)/H(+) exchange at pH 7.4 and pH 6.5. Substitution of Asp(313) to His or Glu residues restored pH sensitivity of the receptor. This indicates that Asp(313), which was shown to modulate Zn(2+) binding, is an essential residue of the pH sensor of GPR39. In conclusion, ZnR/GPR39 is tuned to sense physiologically relevant changes in extracellular pH that thus regulate ZnR-dependent signaling and ion transport activity."
https://openalex.org/W2029290740,"Neutrophil serine proteases play an important role in inflammation by modulating neutrophil effector functions. We have previously shown that neutrophils deficient in the serine proteases cathepsin G and neutrophil elastase (CG/NE neutrophils) exhibit severe defects in chemokine CXCL2 release and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production when activated on immobilized immune complex. Exogenously added active CG rescues these defects, but the mechanism remains undefined. Using a protease-based proteomic approach, we found that, in vitro, the addition of exogenous CG to immune complex-stimulated CG/NE neutrophils led to a decrease in the level of cell-associated annexin A1 (AnxA1) and cathelin-related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP), both known inflammatory mediators. We further confirmed that, in vivo, CG was required for the extracellular release of AnxA1 and CRAMP in a subcutaneous air pouch model. In vitro, CG efficiently cleaved AnxA1, releasing the active N-terminal peptide Ac2-26, and processed CRAMP in limited fashion. Ac2-26 and CRAMP peptides enhanced the release of CXCL2 by CG/NE neutrophils in a dose-dependent manner via formyl peptide receptor (FPR) stimulation. Blockade of FPRs by an antagonist, Boc2 (t-Boc-Phe-d-Leu-Phe-d-Leu-Phe), abrogates CXCL2 release, whereas addition of FPR agonists, fMLF and F2L, relieves Boc2 inhibition. Furthermore, the addition of active CG, but not inactive CG, also relieves Boc2 inhibition. These findings suggest that CG modulates neutrophil effector functions partly by controlling the release (and proteolysis) of FPR agonists.

https://openalex.org/W2130397676,"Background Secretory phospholipase A2 group IIA (sPLA2-IIA) has been identified as a biomarker of atherosclerosis in observational and animal studies. The protein is encoded by the PLA2G2A gene and the aim of this study was to test the functionality of two PLA2G2A non-coding SNPs, rs11573156 C>G and rs3767221 T>G where the rare alleles have been previously associated with higher and lower sPLA2-IIA levels respectively. Methodology/Principal Findings Luciferase assays, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), and RNA expression by RT-PCR were used to examine allelic differences. For rs3767221 the G allele showed ∼55% lower luciferase activity compared to the T allele (T = 62.1 (95% CI 59.1 to 65.1) G = 27.8 (95% CI 25.0 to 30.6), p = 1.22×10−35, and stronger EMSA binding of a nuclear protein compared to the T-allele. For rs11573156 C >G there were no luciferase or EMSA allelic differences seen. In lymphocyte cell RNA, from individuals of known rs11573156 genotype, there was no allelic RNA expression difference for exons 5 and 6, but G allele carriers (n = 7) showed a trend to lower exon 1–2 expression compared to CC individuals. To take this further, in the ASAP study (n = 223), an rs11573156 proxy (r2 = 0.91) showed ∼25% higher liver expression of PLA2G2A (1.67×10−17) associated with the G allele. However, considering exon specific expression, the association was greatly reduced for exon 2 (4.5×10−5) compared to exons 3–6 (10−10 to 10−20), suggesting rs11573156 G allele-specific exon 2 skipping. Conclusion Both SNPs are functional and provide useful tools for Mendelian Randomisation to determine whether the relationship between sPLA2-IIA and coronary heart disease is causal."
https://openalex.org/W2051991748,"A view that signaling machineries for the neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) are functionally expressed by cells outside the central nervous system is now prevailing. In this study, we attempted to demonstrate functional expression of GABAergic signaling molecules by chondrocytes. In cultured murine costal chondrocytes, mRNA was constitutively expressed for metabotropic GABAB receptor subunit-1 (GABABR1), but not for GABABR2. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the predominant expression of GABABR1 by prehypertrophic to hypertrophic chondrocytes in tibial sections of newborn mice. The GABABR agonist baclofen failed to significantly affect chondrocytic differentiation determined by Alcian blue staining and alkaline phosphatase activity in cultured chondrocytes, whereas newborn mice knocked out of GABABR1 (KO) showed a decreased body size and delayed calcification in hyoid bone and forelimb and hindlimb digits. Delayed calcification was also seen in cultured metatarsals from KO mice with a marked reduction of Indian hedgehog gene (Ihh) expression. Introduction of GABABR1 led to synergistic promotion of the transcriptional activity of activating transcription factor-4 (ATF4) essential for normal chondrogenesis, in addition to facilitating ATF4-dependent Ihh promoter activation. Although immunoreactive ATF4 was negligibly detected in the nucleus of chondrocytes from KO mice, ATF4 expression was again seen in the nucleus and cytoplasm after the retroviral introduction of GABABR1 into cultured chondrocytes from KO mice. In nuclear extracts of KO chondrocytes, a marked decrease was seen in ATF4 DNA binding. These results suggest that GABABR1 positively regulates chondrogenesis through a mechanism relevant to the acceleration of nuclear translocation of ATF4 for Ihh expression in chondrocytes.

The GABABR agonist baclofen failed to significantly affect chondrocytic differentiation determined by Alcian blue staining and alkaline phosphatase activity in cultured chondrocytes, whereas newborn mice knocked out of GABABR1 (KO) showed a decreased body size and delayed calcification in hyoid bone and forelimb and hindlimb digits. Delayed calcification was also seen in cultured metatarsals from KO mice with a marked reduction of Indian hedgehog gene (Ihh) expression. Introduction of GABABR1 led to synergistic promotion of the transcriptional activity of activating transcription factor-4 (ATF4) essential for normal chondrogenesis, in addition to facilitating ATF4-dependent Ihh promoter activation. Although immunoreactive ATF4 was negligibly detected in the nucleus of chondrocytes from KO mice, ATF4 expression was again seen in the nucleus and cytoplasm after the retroviral introduction of GABABR1 into cultured chondrocytes from KO mice. In nuclear extracts of KO chondrocytes, a marked decrease was seen in ATF4 DNA binding. These results suggest that GABABR1 positively regulates chondrogenesis through a mechanism relevant to the acceleration of nuclear translocation of ATF4 for Ihh expression in chondrocytes."

To be able to investigate how various structures behave and interact we need a wide range of theoretical networks to explore. Both spatial and non-spatial methods exist for generating networks but they are limited in the ability of producing wide range of network structures. We extend an earlier version of a spatial spectral network algorithm to generate a large variety of networks across almost all the theoretical spectra of the following network measures: average clustering coefficient, degree assortativity, fragmentation index, and mean degree. We compare this extended spatial spectral network-generating algorithm with a non-spatial algorithm regarding their ability to create networks with different structures and network measures. The spatial spectral network-generating algorithm can generate networks over a much broader scale than the non-spatial and other known network algorithms. To exemplify the ability to regenerate real networks, we regenerate networks with structures similar to two real Swedish swine transport networks. Results show that the spatial algorithm is an appropriate model with correlation coefficients at 0.99. This novel algorithm can even create negative assortativity and managed to achieve assortativity values that spans over almost the entire theoretical range."
https://openalex.org/W2089907540,"Mutations in the human ether-a-go-go-related gene 1 (hERG1) cause type 2 long QT syndrome (LQT2). The hERG1 gene encodes a K(+) channel with properties similar to the rapidly activating delayed rectifying K(+) current in the heart. Several hERG1 isoforms with unique structural and functional properties have been identified. To date, the pathogenic mechanisms of LQT2 mutations have been predominantly described in the context of the hERG1a isoform. In the present study, we investigated the functional consequences of the LQT2 mutation G628S in the hERG1b and hERG1a(USO) isoforms.A double-stable, mammalian expression system was developed to characterize isoform-specific dominant-negative effects of G628S-containing channels when co-expressed at equivalent levels with wild-type hERG1a. Western blot and co-immunoprecipitation studies were performed to study the trafficking and co-assembly of wild-type and mutant hERG1 isoforms. Patch-clamp electrophysiology was performed to characterize hERG1 channel function and the isoform-specific dominant-negative effects associated with the G628S mutation.The non-functional hERG1a-G628S and hERG1b-G628S channels co-assembled with wild-type hERG1a and dominantly suppressed hERG1 current. In contrast, G628S-induced dominant-negative effects were absent in the context of the hERG1a(USO) isoform. hERG1a(USO)-G628S channels did not appreciably associate with hERG1a and did not significantly suppress hERG1 current when co-expressed at equivalent ratios or at ratios that approximate those found in cardiac tissue. These results suggest that the dominant-negative effects of LQT2 mutations may primarily occur in the context of the hERG1a and hERG1b isoforms."
