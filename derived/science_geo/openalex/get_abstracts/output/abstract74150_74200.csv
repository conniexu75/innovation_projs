https://openalex.org/W2007730596,"INTESTINAL tumours, though very rare in laboratory rodents, have been induced by several types of carcinogenic agents, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, 4-dimethylaminostilbene, 2-acetyl-aminofluorene and radiation1,2. However, so far, no such tumours have been induced by alkylnitroso-compounds, which are able to induce tumours in many organs3. Attempts to induce tumours of the colon by repeated rectal application of diethylnitrosamine led to liver, but not to local, tumours4."

https://openalex.org/W1966564171,"THE toxicity of leaves and seeds of cycads to animals and humans is well established (for review, see ref. 1). The toxic constituents are azoxyglycosides of which the simplest are cycasin (I; R = β-D-glucopyranosyl)2 and macrozamin (I; R = β-primeverosyl)3,4. More recently, liver damage5 and carcinogenesis6 have been observed to follow ingestion of the seeds or extracts containing the unstable aglycone, methylazoxymethanol (I; R = H) (ref. 5). The latter may theoretically decompose to the alkylating agent, diazomethane, a potent carcinogen7, and is indeed isomeric with hydroxydimethylnitrosamine through which dimethylnitrosamine may be transformed in vivo to the same active carcinogen8."

https://openalex.org/W2003929388,THE chromaffin granules of the adrenal medulla are characteristic cell organelles which serve the function of amine storage. Earlier work has shown that these granules are distinct from mitochondria1.

https://openalex.org/W1982649915,"IT has been demonstrated that rabbit anti-mouse erythrocyte serum is capable of agglutinating ascites tumour cells1. Nothing is known, however, about the components of the erythrocyte which are responsible for producing the agglutinin; the present experiment was carried out to clarify this point, and mouse-specific ascites tumour cells and mouse erythrocytes were used."
https://openalex.org/W2026254708,"As reviewed by Fruton1, cathepsins are intracellular proteinases with acid pH optima, ubiquitously found in animal tissues. In the mammal, highest concentrations of cathepsins are found in liver, kidney and spleen2–4. However, perfused rat liver was found to catabolize only 13–15 per cent of the total albumin broken down in the whole animal5."

https://openalex.org/W2039207356,IT is generally agreed that there are two forms of insulin circulating in human blood plasma: (i) the immunologically inactive form bound to a basic protein1–3; (ii) the immunologically active free form4.
