https://openalex.org/W2072162746,"Knowledge of the nature of cardiac progenitor cells is important for an understanding of the development of heart diseases, and as a potential route to regenerative therapy using stem cells. Two groups now report previously unknown cardiac myocyte lineages isolated from the proepicardium of the mouse. Cai et al. identify a population of progenitor cells that express the transcription factor Tbx18, and Zhou et al. identify cells marked by the transcription factor Wt1. Both types of progenitor are pluripotent, capable of producing several different classes of heart cell, making them promising candidates for use in cardiac repair. This paper identifies a novel population of progenitor cells that come from the pro-epicardial organ. These cells, which express the transcription factor Tbx18, migrate to the outer surface of the heart to form the epicardium, and they also contribute to myocytes in the ventrical septum and atrial and ventricular walls, as well as to cardiac fibroblasts and coronary smooth muscle cells. Thus these progenitors seem to be pluripotent. Understanding the origins and roles of cardiac progenitor cells is important for elucidating the pathogenesis of congenital and acquired heart diseases1,2. Moreover, manipulation of cardiac myocyte progenitors has potential for cell-based repair strategies for various myocardial disorders3. Here we report the identification in mouse of a previously unknown cardiac myocyte lineage that derives from the proepicardial organ. These progenitor cells, which express the T-box transcription factor Tbx18, migrate onto the outer cardiac surface to form the epicardium, and then make a substantial contribution to myocytes in the ventricular septum and the atrial and ventricular walls. Tbx18-expressing cardiac progenitors also give rise to cardiac fibroblasts and coronary smooth muscle cells. The pluripotency of Tbx18 proepicardial cells provides a theoretical framework for applying these progenitors to effect cardiac repair and regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2046745698,"The potential impact of pandemic influenza makes effective measures to limit the spread and morbidity of virus infection a public health priority. Antiviral drugs are seen as essential requirements for control of initial influenza outbreaks caused by a new virus, and in pre-pandemic plans there is a heavy reliance on drug stockpiles. The principal target for these drugs is a virus surface glycoprotein, neuraminidase, which facilitates the release of nascent virus and thus the spread of infection. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) are two currently used neuraminidase inhibitors that were developed using knowledge of the enzyme structure. It has been proposed that the closer such inhibitors resemble the natural substrate, the less likely they are to select drug-resistant mutant viruses that retain viability. However, there have been reports of drug-resistant mutant selection in vitro and from infected humans. We report here the enzymatic properties and crystal structures of neuraminidase mutants from H5N1-infected patients that explain the molecular basis of resistance. Our results show that these mutants are resistant to oseltamivir but still strongly inhibited by zanamivir owing to an altered hydrophobic pocket in the active site of the enzyme required for oseltamivir binding. Together with recent reports of the viability and pathogenesis of H5N1 (ref. 7) and H1N1 (ref. 8) viruses with neuraminidases carrying these mutations, our results indicate that it would be prudent for pandemic stockpiles of oseltamivir to be augmented by additional antiviral drugs, including zanamivir."

https://openalex.org/W2165097137,"Prenatal Restraint Stress (PRS) in rats is a validated model of early stress resulting in permanent behavioral and neurobiological outcomes. Although sexual dimorphism in the effects of PRS has been hypothesized for more than 30 years, few studies in this long period have directly addressed the issue. Our group has uncovered a pronounced gender difference in the effects of PRS (stress delivered to the mothers 3 times per day during the last 10 days of pregnancy) on anxiety, spatial learning, and a series of neurobiological parameters classically associated with hippocampus-dependent behaviors. Adult male rats subjected to PRS (""PRS rats"") showed increased anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze (EPM), a reduction in the survival of newborn cells in the dentate gyrus, a reduction in the activity of mGlu1/5 metabotropic glutamate receptors in the ventral hippocampus, and an increase in the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and pro-BDNF in the hippocampus. In contrast, female PRS rats displayed reduced anxiety in the EPM, improved learning in the Morris water maze, an increase in the activity of mGlu1/5 receptors in the ventral and dorsal hippocampus, and no changes in hippocampal neurogenesis or BDNF levels. The direction of the changes in neurogenesis, BDNF levels and mGlu receptor function in PRS animals was not consistent with the behavioral changes, suggesting that PRS perturbs the interdependency of these particular parameters and their relation to hippocampus-dependent behavior. Our data suggest that the epigenetic changes in hippocampal neuroplasticity induced by early environmental challenges are critically sex-dependent and that the behavioral outcome may diverge in males and females."
https://openalex.org/W2039696702,"Fast changes in human demographics worldwide, coupled with increased mobility, and modified land uses make the threat of emerging infectious diseases increasingly important. Currently there is worldwide alert for H5N1 avian influenza becoming as transmissible in humans as seasonal influenza, and potentially causing a pandemic of unprecedented proportions. Here we show how epidemiological surveillance data for emerging infectious diseases can be interpreted in real time to assess changes in transmissibility with quantified uncertainty, and to perform running time predictions of new cases and guide logistics allocations.We develop an extension of standard epidemiological models, appropriate for emerging infectious diseases, that describes the probabilistic progression of case numbers due to the concurrent effects of (incipient) human transmission and multiple introductions from a reservoir. The model is cast in terms of surveillance observables and immediately suggests a simple graphical estimation procedure for the effective reproductive number R (mean number of cases generated by an infectious individual) of standard epidemics. For emerging infectious diseases, which typically show large relative case number fluctuations over time, we develop a bayesian scheme for real time estimation of the probability distribution of the effective reproduction number and show how to use such inferences to formulate significance tests on future epidemiological observations.Violations of these significance tests define statistical anomalies that may signal changes in the epidemiology of emerging diseases and should trigger further field investigation. We apply the methodology to case data from World Health Organization reports to place bounds on the current transmissibility of H5N1 influenza in humans and establish a statistical basis for monitoring its evolution in real time."
https://openalex.org/W1987984230,"Synonymous codon replacement can change protein structure and function, indicating that protein structure depends on DNA sequence. During heterologous protein expression, low expression or formation of insoluble aggregates may be attributable to differences in synonymous codon usage between expression and natural hosts. This discordance may be particularly important during translation of the domain boundaries (link/end segments) that separate elements of higher ordered structure. Within such regions, ribosomal progression slows as the ribosome encounters clusters of infrequently used codons that preferentially encode a subset of amino acids. To replicate the modulation of such localized translation rates during heterologous expression, we used known relationships between codon usage frequencies and secondary protein structure to develop an algorithm (“codon harmonization”) for identifying regions of slowly translated mRNA that are putatively associated with link/end segments. It then recommends synonymous replacement codons having usage frequencies in the heterologous expression host that are less than or equal to the usage frequencies of native codons in the native expression host. For protein regions other than these putative link/end segments, it recommends synonymous substitutions with codons having usage frequencies matched as nearly as possible to the native expression system. Previous application of this algorithm facilitated E. coli expression, manufacture and testing of two Plasmodium falciparum vaccine candidates. Here we describe the algorithm in detail and apply it to E. coli expression of three additional P. falciparum proteins. Expression of the “recoded” genes exceeded that of the native genes by 4- to 1,000-fold, representing levels suitable for vaccine manufacture. The proteins were soluble and reacted with a variety of functional conformation-specific mAbs suggesting that they were folded properly and had assumed native conformation. Codon harmonization may further provide a general strategy for improving the expression of soluble functional proteins during heterologous expression in hosts other than E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1987643886,"Pneumonia is a major risk factor of death after acute stroke. In a mouse model, preventive antibacterial therapy with moxifloxacin not only prevents the development of post-stroke infections, it also reduces mortality, and improves neurological outcome significantly. In this study we investigate whether this approach is effective in stroke patients.Preventive ANtibacterial THERapy in acute Ischemic Stroke (PANTHERIS) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 80 patients with severe, non-lacunar, ischemic stroke (NIHSS>11) in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory. Patients received either intravenous moxifloxacin (400 mg daily) or placebo for 5 days starting within 36 hours after stroke onset. Primary endpoint was infection within 11 days. Secondary endpoints included neurological outcome, survival, development of stroke-induced immunodepression, and induction of bacterial resistance.On intention-to treat analysis (79 patients), the infection rate at day 11 in the moxifloxacin treated group was 15.4% compared to 32.5% in the placebo treated group (p = 0.114). On per protocol analysis (n = 66), moxifloxacin significantly reduced infection rate from 41.9% to 17.1% (p = 0.032). Stroke associated infections were associated with a lower survival rate. In this study, neurological outcome and survival were not significantly influenced by treatment with moxifloxacin. Frequency of fluoroquinolone resistance in both treatment groups did not differ. On logistic regression analysis, treatment arm as well as the interaction between treatment arm and monocytic HLA-DR expression (a marker for immunodepression) at day 1 after stroke onset was independently and highly predictive for post-stroke infections.PANTHERIS suggests that preventive administration of moxifloxacin is superior in reducing infections after severe non-lacunar ischemic stroke compared to placebo. In addition, the results emphasize the pivotal role of immunodepression in developing post-stroke infections.Controlled-Trials.com ISRCTN74386719."
https://openalex.org/W2114072420,"Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder typified by the accumulation of a small protein, beta-amyloid, which aggregates and is the primary component of amyloid plaques. Many new therapeutic and diagnostic agents for reducing amyloid plaques have limited efficacy in vivo because of poor transport across the blood-brain barrier. Here we demonstrate that low-intensity focused ultrasound with a microbubble contrast agent may be used to transiently disrupt the blood-brain barrier, allowing non-invasive, localized delivery of imaging fluorophores and immunotherapeutics directly to amyloid plaques. We administered intravenous Trypan blue, an amyloid staining red fluorophore, and anti-amyloid antibodies, concurrently with focused ultrasound therapy in plaque-bearing, transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease with amyloid pathology. MRI guidance permitted selective treatment and monitoring of plaque-heavy anatomical regions, such as the hippocampus. Treated brain regions exhibited 16.5±5.4-fold increase in Trypan blue fluorescence and 2.7±1.2-fold increase in anti-amyloid antibodies that localized to amyloid plaques. Ultrasound-enhanced delivery was consistently reproduced in two different transgenic strains (APPswe:PSEN1dE9, PDAPP), across a large age range (9–26 months), with and without MR guidance, and with little or no tissue damage. Ultrasound-mediated, transient blood-brain barrier disruption allows the delivery of both therapeutic and molecular imaging agents in Alzheimer's mouse models, which should aid pre-clinical drug screening and imaging probe development. Furthermore, this technique may be used to deliver a wide variety of small and large molecules to the brain for imaging and therapy in other neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2019386365,"Histone-modifying enzymes play a critical role in modulating chromatin dynamics. In this report we demonstrate that one of these enzymes, PR-Set7, and its corresponding histone modification, the monomethylation of histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20), display a distinct cell cycle profile in mammalian cells: low at G1, increased during late S phase and G2, and maximal from prometaphase to anaphase. The lack of PR-Set7 and monomethylated H4K20 resulted in a number of aberrant phenotypes in several different mammalian cell types. These include the inability of cells to progress past G2, global chromosome condensation failure, aberrant centrosome amplification, and substantial DNA damage. By employing a catalytically dead dominant negative PR-Set7 mutant, we discovered that its mono-methyltransferase activity was required to prevent these phenotypes. Importantly, we demonstrate that all of the aberrant phenotypes associated with the loss of PR-Set7 enzymatic function occur independently of p53. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that PR-Set7 enzymatic activity is essential for mammalian cell cycle progression and for the maintenance of genomic stability, most likely by monomethylating histone H4K20. Our results predict that alterations of this pathway could result in gross chromosomal aberrations and aneuploidy. Histone-modifying enzymes play a critical role in modulating chromatin dynamics.

Our results predict that alterations of this pathway could result in gross chromosomal aberrations and aneuploidy. Dynamic alterations in chromatin structure are modulated, in part, by the post-translational modifications of the DNA-associated histone proteins. Specialized chromatin-modifying enzymes can phosphorylate, acetylate, ubiquitylate, or methylate specific amino acids within certain histones, and each of these modifications are associated with distinct biological events (1Wolffe A.P. Guschin D. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 129: 102-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). One of the first histone modifications to be identified nearly forty-five years ago was the methylation of histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20) 4The abbreviations used are: H4K20, histone H4 lysine 20; RNAi, RNA interference; WT, wild type; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; shRNA, small hairpin RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DAPI, 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole; H3S28, histone H3 serine 28; MNase, micrococcal nuclease; TT, tandem tudor domains; CD, catalytically dead. 4The abbreviations used are: H4K20, histone H4 lysine 20; RNAi, RNA interference; WT, wild type; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; shRNA, small hairpin RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DAPI, 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole; H3S28, histone H3 serine 28; MNase, micrococcal nuclease; TT, tandem tudor domains; CD, catalytically dead. (2Murray K. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 10-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Earlier biochemical studies linked H4K20 methylation to diverse biological events including transcriptional regulation, chromatin compaction, cell division, and the formation of heterochromatin (3Annunziato A.T.

Importantly, it was also found that H4K20 is differentially methylated in vivo and therefore can be either mono-, di-, or trimethylated (10Thomas G. Lange H.W. Hempel K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 51: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Together, these findings strongly suggest that different methylated states of H4K20 may be involved in distinct biological processes, similar to what is observed for the various methylated states of histone H3 lysine 4 and 9 methylation (11Ruthenburg A.J. Allis C.D. Wysocka J. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 15-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar, 12Shinkai Y. Subcell. Biochem. 2007; 41: 337-350PubMed Google Scholar). Increasing evidence indicates that certain enzymes are responsible for the specific degree of histone lysine methylation (13Trievel R.C. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 2004; 14: 147-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For example, the mono- and dimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 in humans is mediated by the G9a enzyme, whereas trimethylation is mediated by the SUV39H1 enzyme (14Peters A.H. Kubicek S. Mechtler K. O'Sullivan R.J. Derijck A.A. Perez-Burgos L. Kohlmaier A. Opravil S. Tachibana M. Shinkai Y. Martens J.H. Jenuwein T. Mol.

Trimethylated H4K20 is associated with repressed chromatin because it is targeted to constitutive heterochromatin, various repetitive elements, and imprinting control regions (16Schotta G. Lachner M.

Dimethylated H4K40 is more widely distributed within euchromatic regions in the genome, and recent findings suggest that it may function to recruit the 53BP1 repair protein to sites of DNA damage (17Yang H.

Although original observations suggested that this modification was associated with repressed regions of the genome, recent findings have identified monomethylated H4K20 within actively transcribed genes (26Barski A.

Wang H. Blobel G.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 9185-9195Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Besides functioning in transcription, it was recently found that PR-Set7 plays a role in mammalian cell cycle progression by binding proliferating cell nuclear antigen and localizing to replication foci (28Huen M.S. Sy S.M. van Deursen J.M. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 11073-11077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 29Jorgensen S. Elvers I. Trelle M.B. Menzel T. Eskildsen M.

Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 1413-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Although the loss of PR-Set7 by RNAi eventually resulted in defective replication fork activity and delayed S phase progression, several cell cycles were required to achieve this phenotype (29Jorgensen S. Elvers I. Trelle M.B. Menzel T. Eskildsen M. Jensen O.N. Helleday T. Helin K. Sorensen C.S. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 1337-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 30Tardat M. Murr R. Herceg Z. Sardet C. Julien E. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 1413-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we previously demonstrated that expression of PR-Set7 was tightly cell cycle-regulated where it was undetectable at G1/S, slowly increased during late S phase, and peaked during mitosis, concomitant with its catalytic activity (31Rice J.C. Nishioka K. Sarma K. Steward R. Reinberg D. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2225-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Based on these contradictory observations, it currently remains unclear how PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation function in mammalian cell cycle progression. To further investigate this, we first employed a panel of H4K20 methyl-specific antibodies to determine that only the monomethylated form of H4K20 displayed a distinct cell cycle profile: low at G1, increased during late S, and highest at G2/M, identical to PR-Set7 (32Sims J.K. Houston S.I. Magazinnik T. Rice J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12760-12766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we also defined that the cell cycle-dependent changes in monomethylated H4K20 occurred locally at specific genomic regions. Similar to recent reports, RNAi-mediated depletion of PR-Set7 and H4K20 monomethylation resulted in delayed S phase progression (29Jorgensen S. Elvers I. Trelle M.B. Menzel T. Eskildsen M. Jensen O.N. Helleday T. Helin K. Sorensen C.S. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 1337-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 30Tardat M. Murr R. Herceg Z. Sardet C. Julien E. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 1413-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, we found that the PR-Set7 RNAi cells were capable of completing S phase and, in a p53-independent manner, arrested at prometaphase, when PR-Set7 and monomethylated H4K20 levels peak. Consistent with recent findings indicating that these factors are important for chromatin compaction, the PR-Set7 RNAi cells displayed enlarged nuclei containing decondensed chromosomes (33Karachentsev D. Sarma K. Reinberg D. Steward R. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 34Trojer P. Li G. Sims 3rd, R.J. Vaquero A. Kalakonda N. Boccuni P. Lee D.

In addition, we observed significant increases in DNA damage and aberrant centrosome amplification in cells lacking PR-Set7, two key events associated with oncogenic transformation. Importantly, we discovered that the catalytic activity of PR-Set7 was required to prevent all these phenotypes. Therefore, our findings indicate that the catalytic function of PR-Set7 is essential for mitotic entry and genomic stability, most likely by directly controlling the levels of monomethylated H4K20. Immunofluorescence—Indirect immunofluorescence of mouse embryonic fibroblasts was performed as previously described (32Sims J.K. Houston S.I. Magazinnik T. Rice J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12760-12766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Antibody dilutions were used as follows: H4K20 mono- (1:1,000), di- (1:500), and trimethyl (1:1,000) (LP Biologicals); γH2AX (Millipore; 1:500); and γ-tubulin (Sigma; 1:400). Staining was visualized on the Zeiss Axio Imager Z1 microscope with Apotome using a Z-stack acquisition, three-dimensional reconstruction, and structured illumination. Volumetric measurements were made using algorithms developed for use with Zeiss proprietary AxioVision software. The pictures were analyzed and prepared with Adobe PhotoShop CS2. Quantitative imaging microscopy was performed on murine 10T1/2 cells using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope equipped with a 12-bit Coolsnap HQ cooled CCD camera and a 40× fluor lens, as previously described (35McManus K.J. Hendzel M.J. Methods. 2005; 36: 351-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Cell Cycle Synchronization—HeLa cells were first blocked at the G1/S border with 2 mm thymidine for 17 h (31Rice J.C. Nishioka K. Sarma K. Steward R. Reinberg D. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2225-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The cells were then released into fresh medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) plus 10% cosmic calf serum (HyClone)) for 7 h prior to the addition of 400 μm l-mimosine for 20 h. The cells were released into fresh medium and collected every 2.5 h for Western analysis or flow cytometry. Western Analysis—Whole cell lysates from 105 cells were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and blocked in 5% nonfat milk/Tris-buffered saline prior to incubation with primary antibody in 1% nonfat milk/Tris-buffered saline for 1 h rotating at room temperature. Antibody dilutions were as follows: H4K20 mono- (1:150,000), di- (1:100,000), or trimethyl (1:20,000) (LP Biologicals); H3K9 mono- (1:60,000), di- (1:80,000), or trimethyl (1:10,000) (Millipore); H4 general (Millipore; 1:100,000); phospho-H3S10 (Serotec; 1:20,000); phospho-H3S28 (1:2000); γH2AX (Millipore; 1:25,000); phospho-ATM (Rockland; 1:1000); and PR-Set7 (1:1000) dilution. Following three washes in Tris-buffered saline + 0.1% Tween 20, the membranes were incubated with an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch; 1:5,000) in 1% nonfat milk/Tris-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed three more times prior to the addition of ECL Plus (GE Healthcare). The results were visualized by exposure to film for 1 min. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—HeLa cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 10 min before quenching with 0.125 m glycine for 5 min. The nuclei were isolated using nuclear isolation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and resuspended in nuclear lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS) at a concentration of 108 nuclei/ml. The nuclei were sonicated to DNA fragments ranging from 200 to 600 bp. For each ChIP, sonicated nuclear material from 5 × 106 cells was immunoprecipitated with either rabbit IgG, a histone H3 general antibody (Abcam), or a histone H4K20 monomethyl-specific antibody (Lake Placid Biologicals). Immune complexes were precipitated with protein A-conjugated Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences and GE Biosciences) and washed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.7% sodium deoxycholate, 500 mm LiCl). DNA was eluted using a 10% Chelex (Bio-Rad) solution (36Nelson J.D. Denisenko O. Sova P. Bomsztyk K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: e2Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). PR-Set7 shRNA and CD Mutant—A pSUPERIOR.retro.puro empty vector (OligoEngine) or the vector containing either a nonspecific shRNA sequence (5′-TCGCCTAGGAAGACTGATC-3′) or an shRNA targeted to PR-Set7 (5′-ACGCAACAGAATCGCAAAC-3′) were transfected into HCT116 and HEK 293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Puromycin selection (4 μg/ml for HEK 293, 1 μg/ml for HCT116) was initiated 1 day post-transfection. Whole cell lysates were collected 6 days post-transfection for Western analysis. A pQCXIP vectors (Clontech) containing either enhanced GFP or the full-length PR-Set7 R265G dominant negative mutant were transfected into HCT116 and HEK 293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (24Nishioka K. Rice J.C. Sarma K. Erdjument-Bromage H. Werner J. Wang Y. Chuikov S. Valenzuela P. Tempst P. Steward R. Lis J.T. Allis C.D. Reinberg D. Mol.

For growth curves, the cells were counted manually beginning 2 days following puromycin selection. MNase Digestion—The cells were incubated in nuclear isolation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) at 4 °C to release nuclei, which were resuspended in MNase digestion buffer (0.32 m sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2) to a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml as determined by A260. Ten units of MNase/0.5 mg DNA was used for a 1-, 3-, or 5-min digestion prior to quenching with a final concentration of 10 mm EDTA. DNA was isolated before fractionation by agarose electrophoresis as previously described (37Wu S. Trievel R.C. Rice J.C. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 3289-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). GST Pulldown Assays—The tandem tudor domains of 53BP1 (amino acids 1480–1616) were cloned into the pGEX4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli by induction with 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma). The cells were sonicated on ice, and soluble lysate was used to batch purify GST fusion proteins using glutathione agarose (Sigma), followed by elution with 10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The purified GST or GST-53BP1-TT (5 μg) was incubated with 200 μg of purified HeLa nucleosomes for 1 h at 4 °C (37Wu S. Trievel R.C. Rice J.C. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 3289-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), incubated with glutathione agarose (Sigma), and washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline. The bound material was eluted, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for Western analysis. Global Changes in H4K20 Methylation Occur during Cell Cycle Progression—In the first set of experiments, a panel of antibodies that selectively discriminate between the three methylated forms of H4K20 were used in indirect immunofluorescence studies in asynchronously dividing mouse embryonic fibroblasts (Fig. 1A). Consistent with our previous results, each of the methylated forms partitioned to distinct genomic regions (32Sims J.K. Houston S.I. Magazinnik T. Rice J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12760-12766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Although di- and trimethylated H4K20 showed little change in the intensity of staining across the cell cycle, the intensity of monomethylated H4K20 staining varied greatly between cells. The modification was easily observed in the condensed chromatin of mitotic figures but was significantly reduced in interphase cells. These observations strongly suggested that H4K20 monomethylation selectively increases as cells enter mitosis. Cell synchronization studies were performed to further characterize the global changes in H4K20 monomethylation during cell cycle progression. HeLa cells were synchronized at the G1/S border by a thymidine-mimosine double block (31Rice J.C. Nishioka K. Sarma K. Steward R. Reinberg D. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2225-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Cells were released from the block and collected every 2.5 h, and then flow cytometry was used to determine their phase in the cell cycle (supplemental Fig. S1). Western analysis was performed on the whole cell lysates from these cells using the H4K20 methyl-specific antibodies and a general H4 antibody to control for loading (Fig. 1B). Semi-quantitative analysis was performed by determining the signal intensity of each H4K20 methyl band relative to the signal intensity of the general H4 control at the corresponding time point. The results were plotted relative to the time point where the specific H4K20 methylated state was maximal: di- and trimethylation at 0 h and monomethylation at 10 h (Fig. 1C). Consistent with the immunofluorescence studies, we found that monomethylated H4K20 was comparatively low at the G1/S border, increased during S phase, and dramatically increased to a maximum during G2/M. As the cells returned to G1, mono-methylated H4K20 declined. In contrast, the global levels of both di- and trimethylated H4K20 were highest at G1/S and slowly declined as cells progressed through S phase, most likely because of the deposition of unmodified histones during DNA replication (38Smith P.A. Jackson V. Chalkley R. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1576-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 39Worcel A. Han S. Wong M.L. Cell. 1978; 15: 969-977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). As cells cycled through mitosis, the levels of both steadily increased as they returned to G1. These findings indicate that only the monomethylation of H4K20 is predominantly restricted to G2/M. To detail the precise timing of H4K20 monomethylation during cell cycle progression, quantitative imaging microscopy was performed in mouse 10T1/2 cells (35McManus K.J. Hendzel M.J. Methods. 2005; 36: 351-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Individual cells were first visually categorized into distinct cell cycle stages based on their DAPI staining, as previously described (40McManus K.J. Biron V.L. Heit R. Underhill D.A. Hendzel M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8888-8897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Then the total signal intensity of methylated H4K20 in each cell was determined and normalized to the total signal intensity of DAPI staining in that cell. Consistent with our cell cycle analysis, we found that H4K20 monomethylation steadily increased during G2 through prophase then dramatically increased as cells entered pro-metaphase and remained high through anaphase (Fig. 1D). During the anaphase to telophase transition, there was a marked reduction in monomethylated H4K20 until it returned to basal levels at G1. In contrast, H4K20 trimethylation levels remained relatively constant through the various stages of mitosis (Fig. 1E). Based on these findings, we conclude that H4K20 mono-methylation increases through G2, peaks at mitosis, and rapidly declines following cell division. Cell Cycle Fluctuations in H4K20 Monomethylation Occur at Specific Loci—Because we had demonstrated that global levels of monomethylated H4K20 fluctuate during the cell cycle, we also predicted that local changes in this histone modification would be altered during cell cycle progression. Using the same HeLa cells chemically arrested at G1/S or synchronized to G2/M, ChIPs were performed using either the monomethyl-specific H4K20 antibody, a histone H3 general antibody as the positive control, or rabbit IgG as the nonspecific negative control. Conventional PCR amplifications were performed on the enriched material at known H4K20 monomethyl positive and negative regions for two different human genes, PTTG1IP and BRD1 (Fig. 2, A and C). In every case, PCR amplification was detected for the histone H3 positive control, whereas the IgG negative control failed to amplify (Fig. 2, B and D). As predicted, monomethylated H4K20 was detected at the positive peaks for both PTTG1IP and BRD1 at G2/M. In contrast, PCR amplification of the negative regions of both genes was absent or severely reduced by comparison. Consistent with the global findings above, these data indicate that the methylated state of H4K20 significantly changes at these specific genomic loci during cell cycle progression. Because monomethylated H4K20 also functions in transcriptional regulation, it was predicted that genes enriched in this cell cycle-regulated modification would also alter their expression at distinct points in the cell cycle. However, expression analysis of HeLa cells arrested at G1/S or G2/M for eight known monomethylated H4K20 target genes revealed that there was no consistent or predictable correlation in the expression of these target genes to distinct points of the cell cycle (supplemental Fig. S4). The PR-Set7 H4K20 Monomethyltransferase Is Required for Cell Cycle Progression—Because H4K20 monomethylation and the protein levels of the PR-Set7 H4K20 monomethyltransferase are tightly cell cycle regulated (supplemental Fig. S2), our findings predicted that both are required for proper cell division (31Rice J.C. Nishioka K. Sarma K. Steward R. Reinberg D. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2225-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). To test this, HEK 293 cells were transfected with a puromycin-resistant control shRNA or an shRNA construct that specifically eliminates PR-Set7, resulting in a global loss of monomethylated H4K20 (Fig. 3A). Cell growth was monitored beginning 2 days following puromycin selection (Fig. 3B). Although the nontransfected cells and shRNA control cells displayed a normal growth curve, the growth rate of cells lacking PR-Set7 and monomethylated H4K20 declined over time consistent with a cell cycle arrest and death. Flow cytometry revealed striking changes in cells lacking PR-Set7 and monomethylated H4K20. These cell populations had a clear reduction in the proportion of G1 cells and a concomitant increase in the amount of S phase and G2/M cells relative to control cells (Fig. 3C). Quantitative measurements of the flow cytometry data demonstrated that there was an ∼18% decrease in the number of G1 cells and ∼11 and ∼12% increases in S phase and G2/M cells, respectively, compared with control cells (Fig. 3D). Consistent with this, Western analysis demonstrated the activation of ATM in the PR-Set7 shRNA cells, which is known to occur during S phase and G2/M arrests (Fig. 3E) (41Morgan S.E. Kastan M.B. Adv. Cancer Res. 1997; 71: 1-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, our findings show that the lack of PR-Set7 and monomethylated H4K20 results in a cell cycle arrest or delay with cells amassing in S phase and G2/M. Based on these findings and the findings above demonstrating that H4K20 monomethylation peaks during mitosis, we predicted that the lack of PR-Set7 and monomethylated H4K20 would result in a mitotic arrest. Consistent with this, Western analysis revealed that the PR-Set7 shRNA cells had accumulated significant amounts of cyclin B compared with control cells, suggesting that they had not progressed through anaphase because cyclin B must be degraded by APC/C for this to occur (Fig. 3E) (42Pines J. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 55-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, the levels of cdc2 and cdc2 phosphorylated on tyrosine 15 were unchanged in the PR-Set7 shRNA cells, suggesting the inability of the cells to progress to mitosis. To determine whether the defect in progression occurred at G2 or early mitosis, Western analysis was performed for phosphorylated histone H3 serine 28 (H3S28), a histone modification that specifically occurs at prophase during chromatin condensation and is reduced following metaphase (43Goto H. Tomono Y. Ajiro K. Kosako H. Fujita M. Sakurai M. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Okigaki T. Takahashi T. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25543-25549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that the PR-Set7 shRNA cells displayed markedly decreased levels of phosphorylated H3S28 compared with control cells, indicating a failure to achieve the early stages of mitosis. Collectively, these findings show that the lack of PR-S"
https://openalex.org/W2070765551,"Background Telomeres–the terminal caps of chromosomes–become shorter as individuals age, and there is much interest in determining what causes telomere attrition since this process may play a role in biological aging. The leading hypothesis is that telomere attrition is due to inflammation, exposure to infectious agents, and other types of oxidative stress, which damage telomeres and impair their repair mechanisms. Several lines of evidence support this hypothesis, including observational findings that people exposed to infectious diseases have shorter telomeres. Experimental tests are still needed, however, to distinguish whether infectious diseases actually cause telomere attrition or whether telomere attrition increases susceptibility to infection. Experiments are also needed to determine whether telomere erosion reduces longevity. Methodology/Principal Findings We experimentally tested whether repeated exposure to an infectious agent, Salmonella enterica, causes telomere attrition in wild-derived house mice (Mus musculus musculus). We repeatedly infected mice with a genetically diverse cocktail of five different S. enterica strains over seven months, and compared changes in telomere length with sham-infected sibling controls. We measured changes in telomere length of white blood cells (WBC) after five infections using a real-time PCR method. Our results show that repeated Salmonella infections cause telomere attrition in WBCs, and particularly for males, which appeared less disease resistant than females. Interestingly, we also found that individuals having long WBC telomeres at early age were relatively disease resistant during later life. Finally, we found evidence that more rapid telomere attrition increases mortality risk, although this trend was not significant. Conclusions/Significance Our results indicate that infectious diseases can cause telomere attrition, and support the idea that telomere length could provide a molecular biomarker for assessing exposure and ability to cope with infectious diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2031910731,"Gecko adhesion is expected to be temperature insensitive over the range of temperatures typically experienced by geckos. Previous work is limited and equivocal on whether this expectation holds. We tested the temperature dependence of adhesion in Tokay and Day geckos and found that clinging ability at 12 degrees C was nearly double the clinging ability at 32 degrees C. However, rather than confirming a simple temperature effect, our data reveal a complex interaction between temperature and humidity that can drive differences in adhesion by as much as two-fold. Our findings have important implications for inferences about the mechanisms underlying the exceptional clinging capabilities of geckos, including whether performance of free-ranging animals is based solely on a dry adhesive model. An understanding of the relative contributions of van der Waals interactions and how humidity and temperature variation affects clinging capacities will be required to test hypotheses about the evolution of gecko toepads and is relevant to the design and manufacture of synthetic mimics."
https://openalex.org/W2160286360,"The flora of Macaronesia, which encompasses five Atlantic archipelagos (Azores, Canaries, Madeira, Cape Verde, and Salvage), is exceptionally rich and diverse. Spectacular radiation of numerous endemic plant groups has made the Macaronesian islands an outstanding area for studies of evolution and speciation. Despite intensive investigation in the last 15 years, absolute age and rate of diversification are poorly known for the flora of Macaronesia. Here we report molecular divergence estimates and rates of diversification for five representative, putative rapid radiations of monophyletic endemic plant lineages across the core eudicot clade of flowering plants. Three discrete windows of colonization during the Miocene and early Pliocene are suggested for these lineages, all of which are inferred to have had a single colonization event followed by rapid radiation. Subsequent inter-archipelago dispersal events into Madeira and the Cape Verdes took place very recently during the late Pliocene and Pleistocene after initial diversification on the Canary Islands. The tempo of adaptive radiations differs among the groups, but is relatively rapid compared to continental and other island radiations. Our results demonstrate that opportunity for island colonization and successful radiation may have been constrained to discrete time periods of profound climatic and geological changes in northern African and the Mediterranean."
https://openalex.org/W2065007674,"Background Socioeconomic inequalities in death rates from all causes combined widened from 1960 until 1990 in the U.S., largely because cardiovascular death rates decreased more slowly in lower than in higher socioeconomic groups. However, no studies have examined trends in inequalities using recent US national data. Methodology/Principal Findings We calculated annual age-standardized death rates from 1993–2001 for 25–64 year old non-Hispanic whites and blacks by level of education for all causes and for the seven most common causes of death using death certificate information from 43 states and Washington, D.C. Regression analysis was used to estimate annual percent change. The inequalities in all cause death rates between Americans with less than high school education and college graduates increased rapidly from 1993 to 2001 due to both significant decreases in mortality from all causes, heart disease, cancer, stroke, and other conditions in the most educated and lack of change or increases among the least educated. For white women, the all cause death rate increased significantly by 3.2 percent per year in the least educated and by 0.7 percent per year in high school graduates. The rate ratio (RR) comparing the least versus most educated increased from 2.9 (95% CI, 2.8–3.1) in 1993 to 4.4 (4.1–4.6) in 2001 among white men, from 2.1 (1.8–2.5) to 3.4 (2.9–3–9) in black men, and from 2.6 (2.4–2.7) to 3.8 (3.6–4.0) in white women. Conclusion Socioeconomic inequalities in mortality are increasing rapidly due to continued progress by educated white and black men and white women, and stable or worsening trends among the least educated."
https://openalex.org/W1978964795,"One of the most important biological reactions of nitric oxide (nitrogen monoxide, *NO) is its reaction with transition metals, of which iron is the major target. This is confirmed by the ubiquitous formation of EPR-detectable g=2.04 signals in cells, tissues, and animals upon exposure to both exogenous and endogenous *NO. The source of the iron for these dinitrosyliron complexes (DNIC), and its relationship to cellular iron homeostasis, is not clear. Evidence has shown that the chelatable iron pool (CIP) may be at least partially responsible for this iron, but quantitation and kinetic characterization have not been reported. In the murine cell line RAW 264.7, *NO reacts with the CIP similarly to the strong chelator salicylaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone (SIH) in rapidly releasing iron from the iron-calcein complex. SIH pretreatment prevents DNIC formation from *NO, and SIH added during the *NO treatment ""freezes"" DNIC levels, showing that the complexes are formed from the CIP, and they are stable (resistant to SIH). DNIC formation requires free *NO, because addition of oxyhemoglobin prevents formation from either *NO donor or S-nitrosocysteine, the latter treatment resulting in 100-fold higher intracellular nitrosothiol levels. EPR measurement of the CIP using desferroxamine shows quantitative conversion of CIP into DNIC by *NO. In conclusion, the CIP is rapidly and quantitatively converted to paramagnetic large molecular mass DNIC from exposure to free *NO but not from cellular nitrosothiol. These results have important implications for the antioxidative actions of *NO and its effects on cellular iron homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2013156594,"Asparagine deamidation at the NGR sequence in the 5th type I repeat of fibronectin (FN-I5) generates isoDGR, an αvβ3 integrin-binding motif regulating endothelial cell adhesion and proliferation. By NMR and molecular dynamics studies, we analyzed the structure of CisoDGRC (isoDGR-2C), a cyclic β-peptide mimicking the FN-I5 site, and compared it with NGR, RGD, or DGR-containing cyclopeptides. Docking experiments show that isoDGR, exploiting an inverted orientation as compared with RGD, favorably interacts with the RGD-binding site of αvβ3, both recapitulating canonical RGD-αvβ3 contacts and establishing additional polar interactions. Conversely, NGR and DGR motifs lack the fundamental pharmacophoric requirements for high receptor affinity. Therefore, unlike NGR and DGR, isoDGR is a new natural recognition motif of the RGD-binding pocket of αvβ3. These findings contribute to explain the different functional properties of FN-I5 before and after deamidation, and provide support for the hypothesis that NGR → isoDGR transition can work as a molecular timer for activating latent integrin-binding sites in proteins, thus regulating protein function.

In this context, it is worth noting that FN-I5 (i.e. the 5th FN-I repeat) and FN-I7 modules contain a GNGRG loop that is conserved in human, bovine, murine, rat, bird, amphibian, and fish fibronectin, suggesting that this loop is functionally important (11Di Matteo P.

Chem. 1999; 42: 3033-3040Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Importantly, a cyclic β-peptide containing the CisoDGRC motif (isoDGR-2C) is a competitive antagonist of RGD-containing ligands of αvβ3 and inhibits endothelial cell adhesion, proliferation, and tumor growth (12Curnis F. Longhi R. Crippa L. Cattaneo A. Dondossola E. Bachi A. Corti A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36466-36476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Furthermore, analysis of competitive binding plots of RGD-2C and isoDGR-2C shows that both ligands have comparable binding affinity for αvβ3, whereas DGR-2C and NGR-2C cyclopeptides show a >2 order of magnitude lower affinity (12Curnis F.

Chem. 2006; 281: 36466-36476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), pointing to stereospecific isoDGR-αvβ3 interactions. The structural determinants dictating the interaction between isoDGR and αvβ3 are still unknown. To gain a structural insight into the different αvβ3 recognition mechanisms, we analyzed the conformation in solution of four ligands containing either the isoDGR, RGD, NGR, or DGR motifs (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1), and we created putative binding models of the four ligands with αvβ3 based on the crystallographic structure of αvβ3 in its “RGD-bound” conformation (15Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Frech M. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2002; 296: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). Consistently with functional data, our docking studies show that the isoDGR motif can perfectly mimic the canonical RGD interactions with αvβ3, whereas NGR and DGR lack the stereochemical and electrostatic requirements for a correct recognition of the αvβ3-binding pocket. Cell Line and Reagents—EA.hy926 cells (human endothelial cell fused with human lung carcinoma A549) were cultured as described previously (17Curnis F. Gasparri A. Sacchi A. Cattaneo A. Magni F. Corti A. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 2906-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Human αvβ3 was from Immunological Science (Rome, Italy), and streptavidin peroxidase was from Società Prodotti Antibiotici (Milan, Italy). NGR-TNF and FN-I5 were prepared as described previously (12Curnis F. Longhi R. Crippa L. Cattaneo A. Dondossola E. Bachi A. Corti A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36466-36476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Preparation and Characterization of Synthetic Peptides—CRGDCGVRY (RGD-2C), CDGRCGVRY (DGR-2C), CNGRCGVRY (NGR-2C), and CisoDGRCGVRY (isoDGR-2C) were prepared as described (12Curnis F. Longhi R.

The biotinylated peptides CNGRCGVRSSSRTPSDKYGK-bio and CARACGVRSSSRTPSDKYGK-bio (called bio-CNGRC-hTNF-(1-11) and bio-CARAC-hTNF-(1-11)) consist of CNGRCG or CARACG fused to the N-terminal sequence of human tumor necrosis factor (hTNF)-α followed by a Tyr, to enable detection, and a biotinylated Lys. These peptides were prepared and purified as described (11Di Matteo P. Curnis F. Longhi R. Colombo G. Sacchi A. Crippa L. Protti M.P. Ponzoni M. Toma S. Corti A. Mol. Immunol. 2006; 43: 1509-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Deamidation of bio-CNGRC-hTNF-(1-11) was obtained by diluting bio-CNGRC-hTNF-(1-11) in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.5, and incubating for 16 h at 37 °C. The resulting β-peptide was called “heat-treated” bio-CNGRC-hTNF-(1-11). All peptides were dissolved in sterile water and stored in aliquots at -20 °C. The molecular mass of each peptide was checked by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight analysis. Binding of Peptides to αvβ3 Integrin—The binding of biotinylated peptides (bio-CNGRC-hTNF-(1-11), heat-treated bio-CNGRC-hTNF-(1-11) at 37 °C, and bio-CARAC-hTNF-(1-11)) to αvβ3 integrin immobilized on microtiter plates was analyzed as described previously, using streptavidin peroxidase-peptide complexes (12Curnis F.

These complexes were prepared by mixing various amounts of biotinylated peptides (4 to 0.062 μg) in phosphate-buffered saline with Ca2+ and Mg2+ (DPBS, Cambrex) containing 3% bovine serum albumin with 0.03 units of streptavidin peroxidase (binding capacity 1 μg of biotin/unit of streptavidin peroxidase, final volume of 15 μl). Complexes were diluted in 3% bovine serum albumin/DPBS (1:300), added to microtiter plates coated with purified human αvβ3 integrin (0.5 μg/ml), and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After washing with DPBS, bound peroxidase was detected by chromogenic reaction with o-phenylenediamine. Cell Adhesion Assay—The effect of peptides on EA.hy926 cell adhesion was investigated by seeding EA.hy926 cells (7.5 × 103) in 96-well flat bottom plates in the presence of increasing concentration of ligands (NGR-2C, RGD-2C, isoDGR-2C, and DGR-2C). After 4 h of incubation at 37 °C, nonadherent cells were washed out. The amount of adherent cells was measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide colorimetric assay (18Traversari C. van der Bruggen P. van den Eynde B. Hainaut P. Lemoine C. Ohta N. Old L. Boon T. Immunogenetics. 1992; 35: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). NMR Experiments and Structure Calculations—For each ligand NMR spectra of an ∼5 mm sample (90% H2O, 10% D2O) at pH 3 were recorded at 280 K on a Bruker Avance-600 spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin) equipped with a triple-resonance TCI cryoprobe with an x, y, z shielded pulsed-field gradient coil. The experiments were performed at acidic pH to avoid both signal loss because of high exchange rates at neutral pH and deamidation of the asparagine in the NGR-2C peptide (12Curnis F. Longhi R. Crippa L. Cattaneo A. Dondossola E. Bachi A. Corti A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36466-36476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Proton resonances were assigned by conventional two-dimensional experiments as follows: total correlation spectroscopy (tmix = 60 ms), nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY), and rotational nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (tmix = 100-400 ms) (19van Well R.M. Marinelli L. Altona C. Erkelens K. Siegal G. van Raaij M. Llamas-Saiz A.L. Kessler H. Novellino E. Lavecchia A. van Boom J.H. Overhand M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 10822-10829Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Cross-peaks intensities were measured from NOESY spectra at 200 ms. No differences were observed in the experiments at higher mixing times. Water proton signals were suppressed with excitation sculpting sequence (20Hwang T.L. Shaka A.J. J. Magn. Reson. Ser. A. 1995; 112: 275-279Crossref Scopus (1511) Google Scholar). All resonances of the four ligands have been assigned with the only exception of the amide proton of C1, which has a higher exchange rate with the solvent even at low pH (Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank accession codes: RGD, 1928339, isoDGR, 38926841; NGR, 32415285; and DGR, 52915018). The 3JHN-HA coupling constants were obtained directly from the resolved amide proton resonances of well digitized mono-dimensional spectrum. The temperature coefficients of the amide protons were obtained from linear fits of the chemical shift data from mono-dimensional spectra acquired in a temperature range from 280 to 300 K (5 K-increasing steps). Data were processed with NMRPipe (21Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11280) Google Scholar) and analyzed using the NMRView software (22Linge J.P. Nilges M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Structure Calculations—Structures were calculated using ARIA 1.2, ambiguous restraints for iterative assignment (23Linge J.P. O'Donoghue S.I. Nilges M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 71-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), in combination with CNS 1.2, crystallography, and NMR systems (24Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar) using only manually assigned NOEs as experimental restraints. Coupling constants that were in the range between 6 and 8.5 Hz were not used in calculations because their values were suggestive of rapidly interconverting conformers coexisting in solution. To avoid bias in the calculations, hydrogen bonds inferred from temperature coefficients data were not included. These data were only used for structure validation. Calculations were carried out in the simplified all-hydrogen PARALLHDG5.3 force field with nonbonded interactions modeled by PROLSQ force field (22Linge J.P. Nilges M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Parameters for isoaspartic residue were derived from the aspartic residue applying appropriate dihedrals and improper angles. A total of eight iterations (200 structures per iteration) were performed. The ARIA default water refinement was performed on the 30 best structures of the final iteration. The stereochemical quality of the structures was assessed with PROCHECK-NMR program (25Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4285) Google Scholar). In the case of isoDGR-2C, residue 2 was excluded from torsion angle check. However, its torsion angle compared well with φ and ψ angles of isoaspartic residues measured in deposited x-ray structures (Protein Data Bank codes 1AT6, 1DY5, 1RTU, 2FI5, 2FTM, 1C9P, 1LSQ, 2FI4, and 2FTL). Molecular Dynamics Simulations—Simulations were performed on the lowest energy NMR structures of each ligand using the GROMACS 3.3.1 package (26Berendsen H.J.C. van der Spoel D. van Drunen R. Comp. Phys. Comm. 1995; 91: 43-56Crossref Scopus (6854) Google Scholar) with the optimized parameters for liquid simulation (OPLS) force field (27Jorgensen W.L. Maxwell D.S. Tirado-Rives J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 11225-11236Crossref Scopus (10145) Google Scholar). All trajectories were calculated in periodic cubic boxes (5 × 5 × 5 nm) of explicit SPC water molecules (28Hermans J. Berendsen H.J.C. van Gunsteren W.F. Postma J.P.M. Biopolymers. 1984; 23: 1513-1518Crossref Scopus (697) Google Scholar). The system was neutralized by 1-2 chloride ions according to the charge of the ligand. Bond lengths were constrained using the LINCS algorithm (29Hess B. Bekker H. Berendsen H.J.C. Fraaije J.G.E.M. J. Comput. Chem. 1997; 18: 1463-1472Crossref Scopus (10848) Google Scholar), and Lennard-Jones interactions were calculated with a 0.9-nm twin-range cutoff. Full electrostatic potentials were computed using the PME method (30Darden T. Perera L. Li L. Pedersen L. Structure (Camb.). 1999; 7: 55-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) with a cutoff of 0.9 nm. The system was first minimized using steepest descent algorithm and then equilibrated at 300 K for 100 ps under NPT (number of molecules, volume, temperature) and periodic boundary conditions. REMD simulations were performed with 16 replicas run in parallel at the following temperatures from 293 to 353 K with 4 K-increasing steps. The temperatures were chosen so as to maintain an exchange rate of 5-10%. Transitions between adjacent temperatures were attempted every 500 MD steps (1 ps) using a Metropolis transition probability (31Sugita Y. Okamoto Y. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1999; 1-2: 141-151Crossref Scopus (3376) Google Scholar), which gives a probability of exchange between two replicas i and j: P(i,j) = exp(-(βi - βj)(Ej - Ei)), where β = 1/kBT; E is the potential energy of the system; T is the absolute temperature, and kB is Boltzmann's constant. Each replica was simulated for 2 ns, with an integration time step of 0.002 fs under NVT (number of molecules, volume, temperature) conditions, yielding a total sampling time of 32 ns. Configurations were saved prior to every attempted transition, leading to an ensemble at each temperature containing 2000 structures. The full trajectories were clustered over the backbone atoms of the macrocycle and the disulfide bridge using the GROMOS algorithm g_cluster (32Daura X. Antes I. van Gunsteren W.F. Thiel W. Mark A.E. Proteins. 1999; 36: 542-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) as implemented in the GROMACS 3.3.1 package with a cutoff of 0.07 nm. Electrostatic Surface Potential Calculations—The electrostatic potential of the four ligands has been calculated using the adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann solver program (APBS 0.5) (33Baker N.A. Sept D. Joseph S. Holst M.J. McCammon J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10037-10041Crossref PubMed Scopus (5699) Google Scholar). The charges (Q) and radii (R) of atoms in the PQR file required by APBS were taken from the OPLS force field. Electrostatic potential was visualized using the PyMOL program (Delano Scientific LLC) with positive potential in blue and negative potential in red in a range between -5 and +5 kT/e. Molecular Docking Calculations—Docking calculations of the four ligands on the globular head of the extracellular part of αvβ3 in its ligand-bound conformation (Protein Data Bank code 1L5G), have been performed using the docking program HADDOCK2.0 (34de Vries S.J. van Dijk A.D. Krzeminski M. van Dijk M. Thureau A. Hsu V. Wassenaar T. Bonvin A.M. Proteins. 2007; 69: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 35Dominguez C. Boelens R. Bonvin A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar). For each ligand an ensemble of the best 30 NMR structures in terms of energy was docked onto αvβ3. The protocol follows a three-stage docking procedure, which includes the following: (a) randomization of orientations and rigid body minimization, (b) simulated annealing in torsion angle space, and (c) refinement in Cartesian space with explicit water. Ambiguous interaction restraints (αvβ3: Asp150, Asp218, Tyr122, Arg214, Asn215, and Arg216; ligand, residues 2-4) (35Dominguez C. Boelens R. Bonvin A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar) were derived from the known interactions of the RGD motif of the cyclic pentapeptide in the Protein Data Bank structure 1L5G. OPLS force field was used. During the rigid body docking step 1000 structures were calculated, allowing the ligand to explore solutions rotated by 180°, thus increasing the sampling of the solutions. The best 200 solutions in terms of intermolecular energies were selected for a semiflexible simulated annealing in which the side-chains of αvβ3 and of the cyclic peptides located at the binding interface (αvβ3, residues 148-152, 216-220 on the αv domain and 118-120, 124-126 on β3 domain; ligand, residues 1-9) were allowed to move in a semi-rigid body docking protocol to search for conformational rearrangements. The models were then subjected to a water refinement step (TIP3P model). Backbone and side-chain of amino acids 6-9 were fully flexible in iteration 1 and in the water refinement step. Analogous calculations have been performed using for each ligand an ensemble of conformers composed by the centroids representing the highest populated clusters (80%) identified in the clusters of REMD trajectories (4, 23, 10, and 5 structures for RGD, isoDGR, NGR, and DGR, respectively). The analysis of the simulations was performed applying in-house Python and Tcl scripts. Root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) values were calculated using the ProFit program (available on line). The fitting of the protein was performed on the flexible residues (Table 3) using the McLachlan algorithm (36McLachlan A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1982; 38: 871-873Crossref Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The r.m.s.d. values of the cyclopeptides were calculated on the backbone of residues 1-5 and on the sulfur and Cβ atoms of residues 1 and 5. The final r.m.s.d. matrix was then clustered using the algorithm described in Daura et al. (32Daura X. Antes I. van Gunsteren W.F. Thiel W. Mark A.E. Proteins. 1999; 36: 542-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), where a cluster is defined as an ensemble of at least two conformations displaying a r.m.s.d. smaller than 1 Å. In the case of NGR-2C, the cut off was increased to 1.3 Å.TABLE 3Summary of the distances (Å) between the ligands and αvβ3 observed in the highest populated clusters (cluster 1)Ligandαvβ3RGD x-rayRGD x-ray dockRGD-2CisoDGR-2CNGR-2CDGR-2CCHNTermaHNTerm denotes N-terminal protons.Tyr122ObO denotes carbonyl oxygen.1.8 ± 0.1DOXcOX denotes carboxylate oxygen./IASOXTyr122HNdHN denotes amide proton.1.92.1 ± 0.12 ± 0.12.2 ± 0.1DOX/IASOXAsn215HN1.82.2 ± 0.12.2 ± 0.12.3 ± 0.2DOX/IASOXCa2+2.71.7 ± 0.11.7 ± 0.11.8 ± 0.1DOArg214HXeHX denotes guanidinium proton.3.02.0 ± 0.11.9 ± 0.12.3 ± 0.11.9 ± 0.2DHNAsp150OXDHNArg216O2.72.4 ± 0.12.2 ± 0.1isoDHNTyr122O2.0 ± 0.2NHXAsn215O2.1 ± 0.2NOArg214HX1.9 ± 0.1NOXAsn216HN2.2 ± 0.1GHNArg216O2.4 ± 0.1RHXAsp150OX2.92.2 ± 0.21.9 ± 0.21.9 ± 0.11.9 ± 0.2RHXAsp218OX1.91.7 ± 0.11.8 ± 0.22.0 ± 0.42.0 ± 0.3RHXGlu180OX2.71.9 ± 0.21.7 ± 0.12.0 ± 0.3RHXAsn215O1.8 ± 0.1RHXArg216O2.3 ± 0.1RHXTyr122O2.0 ± 0.2RHNAsp218OX2.4 ± 0.1a HNTerm denotes N-terminal protons.b O denotes carbonyl oxygen.c OX denotes carboxylate oxygen.d HN denotes amide proton.e HX denotes guanidinium proton. Open table in a new tab The final structures after water refinement were clustered and scored using a combination of energy terms defined as follows: 1.0 × EvdW + 1.0 × Eelec + 0.1 × EAIR + 1.0 × Edesolv, the subscripts are as follows: vdW, van der Waals energy; elec, the electrostatic energy; AIR, the ambiguous interaction restraint energy; and desolv, the desolvation energy calculated using the atomic desolvation parameters of Fernandez-Recio and colleagues (37Fernandez-Recio J. Totrov M. Abagyan R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 843-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Unlike NGR-2C and DGR-2C, isoDGR-2C and RGD-2C Can Efficiently Bind αvβ3 Integrin—We have shown previously that peptides containing the NGR motif, such as CNGRC and FN-I5, can rapidly deamidate (half-life, 2-3 h) when incubated for 16 h at pH 8.5 and 37 °C. This reaction leads to the generation of species containing the DGR and isoDGR motifs (12Curnis F. Longhi R. Crippa L. Cattaneo A. Dondossola E. Bachi A. Corti A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36466-36476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). To assess the effect of NGR deamidation on αvβ3 binding, we have analyzed the interaction of a biotinylated NGR peptide (bio-CNGRC-hTNF-(1-11)) to αvβ3 integrin before and after incubation at 37 °C. To this aim, we prepared complexes of biotinylated peptides and streptavidin-peroxidase, and we analyzed their binding to αvβ3 integrin adsorbed on microtiter plates. Although little or no binding was observed with bio-CNGRC-hTNF-(1-11) and bio-CARAC-hTNF-(1-11), a control peptide, a marked increase in binding occurred after heat treatment of bio-CNGRC-hTNF-(1-11) (Fig. 2A). Similar results were observed also with a FN-I5 peptide (data not shown). This suggests that peptide deamidation is very critical for αvβ3 binding. Given that NGR deamidation can lead to the formation of isoDGR and DGR, we performed additional assays to assess which of these molecular species was responsible for the increase in binding after heat treatment. To this aim we compared the capability of synthetic DGR-2C, isoDGR-2C, and NGR-2C to compete the binding of heat-treated bio-CNGRC-hTNF-(1-11) to αvβ3 integrin adsorbed on microtiter plates. The RGD-2C peptide was analyzed in parallel as a positive control. The results showed that isoDGR-2C and RGD-2C could inhibit the binding of heat-treated bio-CNGRC-hTNF-(1-11) to αvβ3 with similar potency, whereas >100-fold higher concentration of DGR and NGR were necessary to induce partial competition (Fig. 2B). These results confirm the hypothesis that isoDGR, unlike NGR and DGR, can efficiently mimic RGD in binding αvβ3. To assess whether these ligand-integrin interactions can also occur in living cells, we investigated the effect of RGD-2C, DGR-2C, isoDGR-2C, and NGR-2C on the adhesion of EA.hy926 cells. As expected both RGD-2C and isoDGR-2C, but not DGR-2C, efficiently inhibited cell adhesion (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, a 10-fold higher concentration of NGR-2C was necessary to compete to comparable levels. Considering that assay incubation was 3.5 h and that the half-life of NGR deamidation in cell culture medium is 2-3 h (12Curnis F. Longhi R. Crippa L. Cattaneo A. Dondossola E. Bachi A. Corti A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36466-36476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), it is very likely that NGR competition was actually related to isoDGR formation during assay incubation. Taken together, these results suggest that isoDGR, unlike DGR and NGR, can functionally mimic RGD in the interaction with adhesion receptors, such as αvβ3 integrin. The modest activity observed with NGR could be due to deamidation occurring during assay incubation, conside"
https://openalex.org/W1979537822,"Bacterial pathogens are recognized by the innate immune system through pattern recognition receptors, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Engagement of TLRs triggers signaling cascades that launch innate immune responses. Activation of MAPKs and NF-kappaB, elements of the major signaling pathways induced by TLRs, depends in most cases on the adaptor molecule MyD88. In addition, Gram-negative or intracellular bacteria elicit MyD88-independent signaling that results in production of type I interferon (IFN). Here we show that in mouse macrophages, the activation of MyD88-dependent signaling by the extracellular Gram-positive human pathogen group A streptococcus (GAS; Streptococcus pyogenes) does not require TLR2, a receptor implicated in sensing of Gram-positive bacteria, or TLR4 and TLR9. Redundant engagement of either of these TLR molecules was excluded by using TLR2/4/9 triple-deficient macrophages. We further demonstrate that infection of macrophages by GAS causes IRF3 (interferon-regulatory factor 3)-dependent, MyD88-independent production of IFN. Surprisingly, IFN is induced also by GAS lacking slo and sagA, the genes encoding cytolysins that were shown to be required for IFN production in response to other Gram-positive bacteria. Our data indicate that (i) GAS is recognized by a MyD88-dependent receptor other than any of those typically used by bacteria, and (ii) GAS as well as GAS mutants lacking cytolysin genes induce type I IFN production by similar mechanisms as bacteria requiring cytoplasmic escape and the function of cytolysins."
https://openalex.org/W2010805241,"Background In humans, chromosome fragile sites are regions that are especially prone to forming non-staining gaps, constrictions or breaks in one or both of the chromatids on metaphase chromosomes either spontaneously or following partial inhibition of DNA synthesis and have been well identified. So far, no plant chromosome fragile sites similar to those in human chromosomes have been reported. Methods and Results During the course of cytological mapping of rDNA on ryegrass chromosomes, we found that the number of chromosomes plus chromosome fragments was often more than the expected 14 in most cells for Lolium perenne L. cv. Player by close cytological examination using a routine chromosome preparation procedure. Further fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) using 45S rDNA as a probe indicated that the root-tip cells having more than a 14-chromosome plus chromosome fragment count were a result of chromosome breakage or gap formation in vitro (referred to as chromosome lesions) at 45S rDNA sites, and 86% of the cells exhibited chromosome breaks or gaps and all occurred at the sites of 45S rDNA in Lolium perenne L. cv. Player, as well as in L. multiflorum Lam. cv. Top One. Chromatin depletion or decondensation occurred at various locations within the 45S rDNA regions, suggesting heterogeneity of lesions of 45S rDNA sites with respect to their position within the rDNA region. Conclusions The chromosome lesions observed in this study are very similar cytologically to that of fragile sites observed in human chromosomes, and thus we conclude that the high frequency of chromosome lesions in vitro in Lolium species is the result of the expression of 45S rDNA fragile sites. Possible causes for the spontaneous expression of fragile sites and their potential biological significance are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2049667789,"The R403Q mutation in the beta-myosin heavy chain (MHC) was the first mutation to be linked to familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC), a primary disease of heart muscle. The initial studies with R403Q myosin, isolated from biopsies of patients, showed a large decrease in myosin motor function, leading to the hypothesis that hypertrophy was a compensatory response. The introduction of the mouse model for FHC (the mouse expresses predominantly alpha-MHC as opposed to the beta-isoform in larger mammals) created a new paradigm for FHC based on finding enhanced motor function for R403Q alpha-MHC. To help resolve these conflicting mechanisms, we used a transgenic mouse model in which the endogenous alpha-MHC was largely replaced with transgenically encoded beta-MHC. A His(6) tag was cloned at the N terminus of the alpha-and beta-MHC to facilitate protein isolation by Ni(2+)-chelating chromatography. Characterization of the R403Q alpha-MHC by the in vitro motility assay showed a 30-40% increase in actin filament velocity compared with wild type, consistent with published studies. In contrast, the R403Q mutation in a beta-MHC backbone showed no enhancement in velocity. Cleavage of the His-tagged myosin by chymotrypsin made it possible to isolate homogeneous myosin subfragment 1 (S1), uncontaminated by endogenous myosin. We find that the actin-activated MgATPase activity for R403Q alpha-S1 is approximately 30% higher than for wild type, whereas the enzymatic activity for R403Q beta-S1 is reduced by approximately 10%. Thus, the functional consequences of the mutation are fundamentally changed depending upon the context of the cardiac MHC isoform."

We previously reported that light causes increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the IR in vivo, which leads to the downstream activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase and Akt pathway in rod photoreceptor cells. The functional role of IR in rod photoreceptor cells is not known. We observed that light stress induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the IR in rod photoreceptor cells, and we hypothesized that IR activation is neuroprotective. To determine whether IR has a neuroprotective role on rod photoreceptor cells, we used the Cre/lox system to specifically inactivate the IR gene in rod photoreceptors. Rod-specific IR knock-out mice have reduced the phosphoinositide 3-kinase and Akt survival signal in rod photoreceptors. The resultant mice exhibited no detectable phenotype when they were raised in dim cyclic light. However, reduced IR expression in rod photoreceptors significantly decreased retinal function and caused the loss of photoreceptors in mice exposed to bright light stress. These results indicate that reduced expression of IR in rod photoreceptor cells increases their susceptibility to light-induced photoreceptor degeneration. These data suggest that the IR pathway is important for photoreceptor survival and that activation of the IR may be an essential element of photoreceptor neuroprotection.

In Drosophila, the IR serves an important function to guide retinal photoreceptor axons from the retina to the brain during development (10Song J. Wu L. Chen Z. Kohanski R.A. Pick L.

The functional role of IRs in retina or photoreceptor cells is not known.In this study we demonstrate that stress induced the activation of the IR in the retina, especially in rod photoreceptor cells. To determine the functional role of IR in rod photoreceptor cells, we generated a conditional IR knock-out mouse under the control of the rod opsin promoter by using Cre/lox technology. Reduced expression of IR led to reduced PI3K and Akt association with rod outer segment (ROS) membranes. Reduced expression of the IR in photoreceptor cells caused increased sensitivity to light-induced photoreceptor degeneration.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Polyclonal anti-IRβ antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Phospho-specific polyclonal anti-IR/IGF-1R (Tyr(P)1158/Tyr(P)1162/Tyr(P)1163) antibody was obtained from BIOSOURCE. Anti-p85, anti-α1-Na+-K+-ATPase, and anti-PTP-1B antibodies were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-Akt, anti-pAkt (Ser473), and anti-caspase-3 antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). Monoclonal anti-arrestin antibody was a kind gift from Dr. Paul Hargrave (University of Florida, Gainesville). Anti-opsin (RD14) antibody was a kind gift from Dr. Robert Molday, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada. [γ-32P]ATP was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Actin antibody was obtained from Affinity BioReagents (Golden, CO). Ultra-sensitive rat insulin ELISA kit was obtained from Crystal Chem Inc. (Downers Grove, IL). Blood glucose levels were measured with Ascensia auto disk blood glucose test strips (Bayer Health Care, Mishawka, IN). All other reagents were of analytical grade and from Sigma.Animals—All animal work was in strict accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care Use of Laboratory Animals and the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology on the Use of Animals in Vision Research. All protocols were approved by the IACUC at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center and the Dean McGee Eye Institute. Sprague-Dawley (Harlan Sera-Lab, Indianapolis, IN) rats were born and raised in our vivarium and kept under dim cyclic light (5 lux, 12 h on/off, 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.) prior to experimentation.Generation of Photoreceptor-specific IR Knock-out Mice—The targeting vector was constructed using the mouse IR gene in which a selection cassette flanked by loxP sites was introduced upstream of exon 4 with a third loxP site downstream of exon 4 (21Kulkarni R.N. Bruning J.C. Winnay J.N. Postic C. Magnuson M.A. Kahn C.R. Cell. 1999; 96: 329-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). In the presence of Cre recombinase, floxed exon 4 of the IR allele would be deleted, thereby causing a frameshift mutation and an immediate stop of translation. The predicted product of this gene, if one exists, would represent a 308-amino acid fragment of the N terminus of the IR α-subunit, lacking a high affinity binding site, and the transmembrane and kinase domains. The IR floxed homozygous mice were bred with the opsin-driven Cre mice, which had either a 0.2-kb or a 4.1-kb opsin-Cre promoter, and the resultant mice were genotyped for Cre and floxed IR. The obtained mice were heterozygous for the IR floxed allele. To create photoreceptor-specific IR knock-out mice, floxed IR mice carrying the cre transgene were bred with IR floxed homozygous mice (backcross). The genotype of the photoreceptor-specific IR knock-out mice (i.e. animals carrying the cre transgene and homozygous for the IR floxed allele) was confirmed by PCR analysis of tail DNA. To identify rhodopsin-cre, PCR was performed with 1 μl of genomic DNA and sense (5′-AGG TGT AGA GAA GGC ACT TAG C-3′) and antisense primers (5′-CTA ATC GCC ATC TTC CAG CAG G 3′) to amplify a 411-bp product. To identify IR floxed mice, we used sense (5′-GAT GTG CAC CCC ATG TCT G-3′) and an antisense primers (5′-CTG AAT AGC TGA GAC CAC AG-3′) to amplify genomic DNA by PCR. The wild-type allele generates a 280-bp product, and the floxed allele generates 300-bp product.PI3K Assay—Enzyme assays were carried out as described previously (25Kaplan D.R. Whitman M. Schaffhausen B. Pallas D.C. White M. Cantley L. Roberts T.M. Cell. 1987; 50: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Briefly, assays were performed directly on anti-IRβ immunoprecipitates (26Ruderman N.B. Kapeller R. White M.F. Cantley L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1411-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) in 50 μl of reaction mixture containing 0.2 mg/ml PI-4,5-P2, 50 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5). The reactions were done for 30 min at room temperature and stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 1 n HCl followed by 200 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v). Lipids were extracted and resolved on oxalate-coated TLC plates (silica gel 60) with a solvent system of 2-propanol, 2 m acetic acid (65:35, v/v). The plates were coated in 1% (w/v) potassium oxalate in 50% (v/v) methanol and then baked in an oven at 100 °C for 1 h prior to use. TLC plates were exposed to x-ray film overnight at -70 °C, and radioactive lipids were scraped and quantified by liquid scintillation counting.Exposure of Animals to Light Stress—Animals were born and raised in dim cyclic (5 lux) light. Albino rats were exposed to constant light for 3 h at an illuminance level of 5000 lux. Albino mice were exposed to constant light for 5 days at an illuminance level of 5000 lux or for 5 days at 10,000 lux by white fluorescent light bulbs suspended 50 cm above the floor of the cage. During light exposure, animals were maintained in transparent polycarbonate cages with stainless steel wire bar covers. Drinking water was supplied by a bottle attached to the side of the cage, so there was no obstruction between the light and the animal, and food was placed on bedding in the bottom of the cage. Mice were maintained in 100-lux cyclic light for 7 days following light exposure. Morphologic and functional analyses in mice were then completed.Outer Nuclear Layer (ONL) Thickness Measurement—Preparation of retinal tissue sections and methods of ONL thickness measurement were described previously (27Tanito M. Agbaga M.P. Anderson R.E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2007; 42: 1838-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Enucleated eyes were immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde containing 20% isopropyl alcohol, 2% trichloroacetic acid, and 2% zinc chloride for 24 h at room temperature. The eyes were embedded in paraffin, and 4-μm-thick sections containing the whole retina, including the optic nerve head, were cut along the vertical meridian of the eyeball. The ONL thickness was measured at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, and 1.5 mm superior and inferior to the optic nerve head and at the periphery 100 μm from the inferior and superior edge of the retina by using Image J 1.32j software (developed by Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, available on line, rsb.info.nih.gov).Electroretinography—Flash ERGs were recorded by using a Ganzfeld-type ERG recording system (UTAS-E3000, LKG Technologies Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) as reported previously (28Tanito M. Kaidzu S. Anderson R.E. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2007; 48: 1864-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). All animals were dark-adapted for 16 h before being tested. After anesthesia was induced by intramuscular injection of a mixture of ketamine (120 mg/kg) and xylazine (6 mg/kg), the pupils were dilated with 0.5% tropicamide and 0.5% phenylephrine hydrochloride eye drops (Santen Pharmaceutical, Osaka, Japan). Gold electrodes were placed on both eyes. An identical reference electrode was placed in the mouth, and a ground electrode was placed on the tail. A single flashlight (25 db for 10 ms) from a halogen source was used as the light stimulus. The a-wave amplitude was measured as the difference in voltage between base line just before the flash and the peak of a-wave, and the b-wave amplitude was measured as difference in voltage between peaks of a- and b-waves. The a- and b-wave amplitudes obtained from the right and left eyes were averaged for each animal.Preparation of Mouse Rod Outer Segments—ROS were prepared from mouse retinas by using a discontinuous sucrose gradient centrifugation as described previously (2Rajala R.V. McClellan M.E. Ash J.D. Anderson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43319-43326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Eight retinas from four mice were homogenized in 1.25 ml of ice-cold 47% sucrose solution containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) (buffer A). Retinal homogenates were transferred to 4.5-ml centrifuge tubes and sequentially overlaid with 1.5 ml of 37% and 1.0 ml of 32% sucrose dissolved in buffer A. The gradients were spun at 82,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The 32:37% interfacial sucrose band containing ROS membranes was harvested and diluted with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 100 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA and centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min. The ROS pellets were resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 100 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA and stored at -20 °C. The non-ROS band designated as band II (37:47%) was also saved for comparison with ROS. Protein concentrations were determined by using the BCA reagent from Pierce, following the manufacturer's instructions.Caspase Activity Assay—Caspase-3 activity assay was performed with a caspase family colorimetric substrate kit II (Bio-Vision, Mountain View, CA). Wild-type and IR knock-out mice were exposed to constant light for 5 days at an illuminance level of 5000 lux. At the end of the experiment, retinas were harvested and lysed in 200 μl of cell lysis buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.01% Triton X-100). Samples were sonicated for 10 s and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min. Reaction buffer (100 mm PIPES (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA, and 0.1% CHAPS) was added to 100 μg of protein to a final volume of 100 μl. Finally, 5 μl of p-nitroanilide-conjugated caspase-3 (Ac-DEVD) substrate was added to a final concentration of 200 μm. After a 20-h incubation at 37 °C, absorbance was determined at 400 nm in a spectrophotometer.Immunoprecipitation—Retinal lysates or ROS were solubilized for 30 min at 4 °C in a lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and 2 mm EDTA) containing phosphatase inhibitors (100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm NaVO3, and 1 mm molybdate) and protease inhibitors (10 μm leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride)) (7Li G. Anderson R.E. Tomita H. Adler R. Liu X. Zack D.J. Rajala R.V. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 20 min, and solubilized proteins were pre-cleared by incubation with 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C with mixing. The supernatant was incubated with anti-IRβ (4 μg) overnight at 4 °C and subsequently with 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. Following centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 1 min, immune complexes were washed three times with wash buffer (25Kaplan D.R. Whitman M. Schaffhausen B. Pallas D.C. White M. Cantley L. Roberts T.M. Cell. 1987; 50: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), and the immunoprecipitates were either subjected to Western blot analysis with phospho-specific IR/IGF-1R (Tyr(P)1158/Tyr(P)1162/Tyr(P)1163) antibody or used to directly measured the IR-associated PI3K activity.SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were washed twice for 10 min with TTBS (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) and blocked with either 5% bovine serum albumin or nonfat dry milk powder (Bio-Rad) in TTBS for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were then incubated with anti-IRβ (1:1000), anti-IR/IGF-1R (Tyr(P)1158/Tyr(P)1162/Tyr(P)1163) (1:1000), anti-p85 (1:4000), or anti-Akt (1:1000) or anti-pAkt (1:1000) antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Blots were incubated with either anti-arrestin (1:1000) or anti-opsin (1:10,000) or anti-α1-Na+-K+-ATPase (1:1000) or anti-actin (1:1000) for 1 h at room temperature. Following primary antibody incubations, immunoblots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (mouse or rabbit) and developed by ECL according to the manufacturer's instructions. Densitometric analysis of immunoblots was performed by using Kodak Image Station 4000R (Eastman Kodak Co.) in the linear range of detection, and absolute values were then normalized to either opsin or actin.Statistical Procedures—All values are expressed as mean ± S.D. Unpaired t test was used to compare groups. Probability values <0.05 are reported as significant.RESULTSLight Stress Activation of IR in Vivo—To determine whether light stress induced IR activation, we exposed rats to 5000 lux light for 3 h. After light exposure, rats were placed in the dark, and retinas were removed 0, 3, and 6 h later. Control experiments were done on overnight dark-adapted rats. The retinas were lysed, and the proteins were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-IRβ antibody followed by Western blot analysis with phospho-specific anti-IR/IGF-1R (Tyr(P)1158/Tyr(P)1162/Tyr(P)1163) antibody. Light stress resulted in the persistent activation of the IR at all time points analyzed (Fig. 1A), whereas the total IR content remained comparably constant (Fig. 1B), suggesting that light stress induced the activation of retinal IR in vivo.Light Stress Induced the IR-associated PI3K Activity—We previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of the IR in the retina induced the activation of PI3K in the retina (3Rajala A. Anderson R.E. Ma J.X. Lem J. Al Ubaidi M.R. Rajala R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9865-9873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To determine whether the light stress-induced activation of PI3K is regulated through the IR, we immunoprecipitated the IR from retina lysates prepared either from dark control or light-stressed (0 h) rats and measured PI3K activity. The PI3K activity associated with the IR in light-stressed retinas was greater than the PI3K activity in the IR from the dark-adapted controls (Fig. 1, C and D), suggesting that light stress induced the activation of PI3K, which is activated through its binding to the activated IR.Light Stress Results in the Activation of Akt in Vivo—We (29Rajala R.V. McClellan M.E. Chan M.D. Tsiokas L. Anderson R.E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5637-5650Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and others (1Barber A.J. Nakamura M. Wolpert E.B. Reiter C.E.

Chem. 2001; 276: 32814-32821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that IR activation leads to the activation of Akt via PI3K in vitro. To determine whether light stress induces the activation of Akt, we subjected rats to light stress for 3 h at 5000 lux. After light exposure, rats were dark-adapted, and retinas were removed at 0, 3, and 6 h. Control experiments were done on overnight dark-adapted rats. Retinas were lysed, and the proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-pAkt and Akt antibodies. Light stress resulted in the persistent activation of Akt in the retinas at all time points analyzed (Fig. 2). The activation of Akt was much higher immediately after light exposure (0 h) compared with 3 and 6 h (Fig. 2A). Total Akt content did not differ depending on time from exposure (Fig. 2B). The blot was reprobed with actin to ensure equal amounts of protein in each lane (Fig. 2C). These experiments clearly suggest that light stress induced the activation of Akt in vivo.FIGURE 2Light stress activates Akt in vivo. Rats were dark-adapted overnight and then exposed to 5000 lux for 3 h. After light exposure, rats were placed in the dark, and retinas were removed 0, 3, and 6 h later. Control experiments were done on overnight dark-adapted rats. The retinas were lysed, and equal amounts of protein were subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-pAkt (A) and Akt (B) antibodies. The blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-actin (C) antibody to ensure protein loading in each lane. Ratios of activated to the total Akt (A/B) indicate increase in phosphorylation in light-stressed retinas. The activation level of control was set as 1.0 for comparison.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Light Stress-induced, IR-associated PI3K Activity in Rod Photoreceptor Cells—To determine whether the light stress-induced activation of PI3K is regulated through the IR in rod photoreceptor cells, we immunoprecipitated the IR from ROS that were prepared from retinas of both dark control and light-stressed (0 h) rats. We measured the PI3K activity and found significant PI3K activity associated with the IR in light-stressed ROS (Fig. 3, A and B). These results clearly suggest that light stress induced the activation of IR in ROS membranes.FIGURE 3Light stress-induced activation of IR-associated PI3K activity in rod photoreceptor cells. Rod outer segments prepared from dark-adapted (dark) and light-stressed (LS) rats were solubilized and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-IRβ antibody followed by measuring the PI3K activity with PI-4,5-P2 and [γ-32P]ATP as substrates (A). The radioactive spots of PI-3,4,5-P3 were scraped from the TLC plate and counted (B).

It has been shown previously that there was a clear increase in IR phosphorylation and activation of a range of downstream signaling molecules in the retina following intravenous administration of insulin, and the response was because of insulin action in vascular endothelium (30Kondo T. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37997-38006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The possibility cannot be ruled out that some significant fraction of the signaling was because of insulin signaling in rod cells. In this study it is not clear whether the activated IR signaling in rods is because of light stress-induced increases in levels of circulating insulin. To determine whether light stress induces increases in the levels of circulating insulin, we measured serum insulin levels in both the dark-adapted and light-stressed rats. No difference was found in the levels of insulin between dark-adapted and light-stressed rats (supplemental Fig. S1). To further confirm these results, we measured blood glucose levels in both the dark-adapted and light-stressed rats and found no difference between dark-adapted and light-stressed rats"
https://openalex.org/W1980158929,The LptA protein of Escherichia coli has been implicated in the transport of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from the inner membrane to the outer membrane. Here we provide evidence that LptA binds structurally diverse LPS substrates in vitro and demonstrate that it interacts specifically with the lipid A domain of LPS. These results are consistent with LptA playing a chaperone role in the transport of LPS across the periplasm and have implications for possible assembly models.
https://openalex.org/W1991359833,"Type III secretion systems (TTSS) are employed by numerous pathogenic and symbiotic bacteria to inject a cocktail of different ""effector proteins"" into host cells. These effectors subvert host cell signaling to establish symbiosis or disease.We have studied the injection of SipA and SptP, two effector proteins of the invasion-associated Salmonella type III secretion system (TTSS-1). SipA and SptP trigger different host cell responses. SipA contributes to triggering actin rearrangements and invasion while SptP reverses the actin rearrangements after the invasion has been completed. Nevertheless, SipA and SptP were both pre-formed and stored in the bacterial cytosol before host cell encounter. By time lapse microscopy, we observed that SipA was injected earlier than SptP. Computer modeling revealed that two assumptions were sufficient to explain this injection hierarchy: a large number of SipA and SptP molecules compete for transport via a limiting number of TTSS; and the TTSS recognize SipA more efficiently than SptP.This novel mechanism of hierarchical effector protein injection may serve to avoid functional interference between SipA and SptP. An injection hierarchy of this type may be of general importance, allowing bacteria to precisely time the host cell manipulation by type III effectors."
https://openalex.org/W2067301040,"Background DFR (different region) analysis has been developed for typing Yesinia pestis in our previous study, and in this study, we extended this method by using 23 DFRs to investigate 909 Chinese Y. pestis strains for validating DFR-based genotyping method and better understanding adaptive microevolution of Y. pestis. Methodology/Principal Findings On the basis of PCR and Bionumerics data analysis, 909 Y. pestis strains were genotyped into 32 genomovars according to their DFR profiles. New terms, Major genomovar and Minor genomovar, were coined for illustrating evolutionary relationship between Y. pestis strains from different plague foci and different hosts. In silico DFR profiling of the completed or draft genomes shed lights on the evolutionary scenario of Y. pestis from Y. pseudotuberculosis. Notably, several sequenced Y. pestis strains share the same DFR profiles with Chinese strains, providing data for revealing the global plague foci expansion. Conclusions/significance Distribution of Y. pestis genomovars is plague focus-specific. Microevolution of biovar Orientalis was deduced according to DFR profiles. DFR analysis turns to be an efficient and inexpensive method to portrait the genome plasticity of Y. pestis based on horizontal gene transfer (HGT). DFR analysis can also be used as a tool in comparative and evolutionary genomic research for other bacteria with similar genome plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2061983173,"Background In eukaryotic cells, identical proteins can be located in different subcellular compartments (termed dual-targeted proteins). Methodology/Principal Findings We divided a reference set of mitochondrial proteins (published single gene studies) into two groups: i) Dual targeted mitochondrial proteins and ii) Exclusive mitochondrial proteins. Mitochondrial proteins were considered dual-targeted if they were also found or predicted to be localized to the cytosol, the nucleus, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or the peroxisome. We found that dual localized mitochondrial proteins have i) A weaker mitochondrial targeting sequence (MitoProtII score, hydrophobic moment and number of basic residues) and ii) a lower whole-protein net charge, when compared to exclusive mitochondrial proteins. We have also generated an annotation list of dual-targeted proteins within the predicted yeast mitochondrial proteome. This considerably large group of dual-localized proteins comprises approximately one quarter of the predicted mitochondrial proteome. We supported this prediction by experimental verification of a subgroup of the predicted dual targeted proteins. Conclusions/Significance Taken together, these results establish dual targeting as a widely abundant phenomenon that should affect our concepts of gene expression and protein function. Possible relationships between the MTS/mature sequence traits and protein dual targeting are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2128769454,"Photointerconversion between the red light-absorbing (Pr) form and the far-red light-absorbing (Pfr) form is the central feature that allows members of the phytochrome (Phy) superfamily to act as reversible switches in light perception. Whereas the chromophore structure and surrounding binding pocket of Pr have been described, those for Pfr have remained enigmatic for various technical reasons. Here we describe a novel pair of Phys from two thermophilic cyanobacteria, Synechococcus sp. OS-A and OS-B′, that overcome several of these limitations. Like other cyanobacterial Phys, SyA-Cph1 and SyB-Cph1 covalently bind the bilin phycocyanobilin via their cGMP phosphodiesterase/adenyl cyclase/FhlA (GAF) domains and then assume the photointerconvertible Pr and Pfr states with absorption maxima at 630 and 704 nm, respectively. However, they are naturally missing the N-terminal Per/Arndt/Sim domain common to others in the Phy superfamily. Importantly, truncations containing only the GAF domain are monomeric, photochromic, and remarkably thermostable. Resonance Raman and NMR spectroscopy show that all four pyrrole ring nitrogens of phycocyanobilin are protonated both as Pr and following red light irradiation, indicating that the GAF domain by itself can complete the Pr to Pfr photocycle. 1H-15N two-dimensional NMR spectra of isotopically labeled preparations of the SyB-Cph1 GAF domain revealed that a number of amino acids change their environment during photoconversion of Pr to Pfr, which can be reversed by subsequent photoconversion back to Pr. Through three-dimensional NMR spectroscopy before and after light photoexcitation, it should now be possible to define the movements of the chromophore and binding pocket during photoconversion.

These chromoproteins were first discovered in higher plants based on their control of many agriculturally relevant processes and have since been found by sequence searches in lower plants, algae, and numerous proteobacteria, cyanobacteria, and fungi. For photoautotrophic organisms, Phys are particularly important for optimizing photosynthetic potential where they measure the fluence rate, duration, and the direction of light and help detect shading by competitors (1Quail P.H.

This activity is directed by a series of structural domains that play specific roles in photoperception. A large N-terminal region encompasses the chromophore-binding domain (CBD); it includes a proximal Per/Arndt/Sim (PAS) domain immediately followed by a cGMP phosphodiesterase/adenyl cyclase/FhlA (GAF) domain. The CBD autocatalytically attaches the bilin via a thioether linkage and together with the chromophore generates the unique photochromic absorption properties of Phys. For proteobacterial (BphP) and fungal Phys, biliverdin (BV) is used as the chromophore (8Bhoo S.H. Davis S.J. Walker J. Karniol B. Vierstra R.D. Nature. 2001; 414: 776-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). BV is synthesized by oxidative cleavage of heme by a heme oxygenase (HO) and then attached to the apoprotein through its A-pyrrole ring vinyl side chain to a positionally conserved cysteine upstream of the PAS domain (9Lamparter T.

For cyanobacterial (Cph) and plant Phys, phycocyanobilin (PCB) and phytochromobilin (PΦB) are used as the chromophore, respectively (2Rockwell N.C. Su Y.S. Lagarias J.C. Annu. Rev. Plant.

Following the GAF domain is a phytochrome (PHY) domain that helps stabilize the Pfr form (14Wu S.H. Lagarias J.C.

The most common in microorganisms is a histidine kinase (HK) domain that allows Phys to participate in specific two-component signal transduction cascades (3Vierstra R.D. Karniol B. Briggs W.R. Spudich J.L. Handbook of Photosensory Receptors. Wiley-VCH Press, Weinheim, Germany2005: 171-196Google Scholar). Higher plant Phys have C-terminal sequences related to HK domains (2Rockwell N.C.

The PAS domain has no direct contact with the chromophore; instead, it is connected indirectly to the bilin and the GAF domain through a figure-of-eight knot in the polypeptide. These models also identified a number of amino acid contacts potentially important for bilin binding and photochemistry that we and others have confirmed to be critical by mutagenic analysis of recombinant chromoproteins (13Wagner J.R.

In contrast to our detailed understandings of Pr, we know little about the structure of Pfr. A variety of spectroscopic studies has proposed that Pr → Pfr phototransformation first involves a Z to E isomerization of the methine bridge double bond between the C and D pyrrole rings to form the Lumi-R intermediate (20Rüdiger W.

The transition from Lumi-R to Pfr then proceeds by a series of relaxation steps that include deprotonation/reprotonation of the pyrrole ring nitrogens (23Foerstendorf H. Benda C. Gärtner W. Storf M.

Here we describe a pair of Cphs from two Synechococcus strains (designated SyA-Cph1 and SyB-Cph1) that offer several advantages. One useful feature is their remarkable stability across a wide range of temperatures, which enhances their survival during NMR data collection. Another was revealed from sequence alignments, which showed that they are members of a previously uncharacterized subfamily of Phys that lacks the N-terminal PAS domain, previously considered important for holo-protein assembly and photochromicity (2Rockwell N.C.

Truncations containing just the ∼200-amino acid GAF domain are photoactive, thus placing them within the acceptable size range for NMR studies (35Yu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Remarkably, two-dimensional 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR spectra of the SyB- Cph1(GAF) truncation collected before and after red light irradiation detected changes for numerous amide nitrogens, suggesting that the GAF domain changes conformation more substantially during Pr → Pfr photoconversion than anticipated. We also engineered a set of GAF domain mutants in SyB-Cph1 that are strongly red fluorescent, which may have use as cell biological reporters.

A. 2001; 98: 10566-10571Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The codons for the C-terminal c-Myc tag attached to Syn-Cph1(PAS-GAF-PHY) were replaced with those encoding a His6 tag (underlined) followed by a stop codon by ligating the annealed primers 5′-AGCTTTGCATCATCAT-CATCATCATTGAAGC and 5′-AGCTGCTTC-AATGATGATGATGATGATGCAA into HindIII-digested pBAD-C plasmid containing the Syn- Cph1(PAS-GAF-PHY) construction. From this manipulation, the plasmid pBAD-6H was generated. Assembly of the various Cph truncations and mutants were accomplished by PCR using appropriate primer pairs. Products for the two PCRs were combined, melted, and re-annealed, phosphorylated, and purified as described (37Ulijasz A.T. Grenader A. Weisblum B. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6305-6309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylated flush inserts were then ligated into the NcoI- and HindIII-digested pBAD-6H plasmid. Site-directed mutations were introduced into the His6-tagged SyB-Cph1(GAF) construction by the QuickChange method (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using Pfx polymerase (Invitrogen) in combination with the appropriate mutagenic primers. All coding regions were sequenced in their entirety to confirm the presence of the desired mutation and the absence of secondary mutations. The PAS-GAF-PHY truncation (residues 1-501) of DrBphP was generated by PCR amplification of the full-length coding region with the primers 5′-CGTAAGGATCCATGAGCCGGGACCCGTTGCCC and 5′-CCTGACTCGAGCGCCCCGGTCAATGTGTCACG that were designed to add BamHI and XhoI sites to the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and XhoI and ligated into the pET21a plasmid (Novagen, Madison, WI) that was similarly digested. Protein Expression and Purification—PCB-containing holo-Cphs suitable for absorption, resonance Raman (RR), and/or NMR spectroscopy were produced using a dual-plasmid Escherichia coli expression system (38Gambetta G.A. Lagarias J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10566-10571Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The kanamycin resistance plasmid pPL-PCB expressed the HO and BVR enzymes under isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside control to direct the synthesis of PCB from heme. Ampicillin resistance pBAD-6H plasmids expressed the His6-tagged SyA-Cph1, SyB-Cph1, and Syn-Cph1 truncations solely under arabinose control (38Gambetta G.A. Lagarias J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10566-10571Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The pPL-PCB and pBAD-6H plasmids were simultaneously introduced into the ara operon-deficient E. coli expression strain BL21-AI (Invitrogen) and cultured in 500 ml of repression medium (RM (38Gambetta G.A. Lagarias J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10566-10571Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar)) to suppress protein production. After an overnight incubation, the cells were harvested, resuspended, and grown at 37 °C in 2 liters of M9 minimal medium containing NH4Cl, 0.2% glycerol, 100 μm α-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) (39Wang L. Elliott M. Elliott T. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1211-1219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 100 μm FeCl3, 5 mg of thiamine, and a vitamin mix (40Venters R.A. Calderone T.L. Spicer L.D. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4491-4494Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To synthesize isotopically labeled SyB-Cph1(GAF), NH4Cl and glycerol were replaced with 15N- and 13C-isotopically labeled forms, respectively. To produce SyB-Cph1(GAF) that contained either [15N]PCB or [13C]PCB (isotopically labeled at all six methyl groups and the C82 and C122 methylene carbons (see Fig. 8A)) attached to unlabeled protein, unlabeled ALA in the medium was replaced with 100 μm [15N]ALA (Medical Isotopes Inc., Pelham, NH) or 1,2-[13C]ALA (a gift from Dr. Mario Rivera, Kansas State University), respectively. In all cases, once the A600 of the culture reached 0.8-0.9, PCB synthesis was induced by adding 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After 2 h, synthesis of the Cph1 apoproteins was induced by the addition of 0.2% w/v arabinose, and the cultures were grown overnight at 20 °C. All subsequent steps were performed under dim green light. To purify the various Phy chromoproteins, the expressing cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 25 ml/liter of culture in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a tablet of Complete-EDTA free protease inhibitor mixture (Hoffmann-La Roche)), and lysed by sonication. Nonidet P-40 (0.1% v/v) was then added to the lysates followed by incubation on ice for 30 min, agitation at 4 °C for 2 h, and finally clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting supernatant was filtered through a 0.45 μm filter (Corning Glass) and dialyzed into wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 300 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 20 mm imidazole, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, and 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) overnight at 4 °C as described (38Gambetta G.A. Lagarias J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10566-10571Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The Phy chromoproteins were then purified by nickel chelate-affinity chromatography (Qiagen Sciences, Germantown, MD) using the wash buffer plus 300 mm imidazole for elution. The Phy-containing eluates were then subjected to hydrophobic interaction FPLC using a 1 × 10-cm phenyl-HP column (GE Healthcare) with a 0-300 mm ammonium sulfate gradient in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) for elution. Pooled Phy-containing fractions for NMR analysis were exchanged and concentrated into 10 mm deuterated Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) (Sigma) in 100% H2O using an Amicon Ultra-15 filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA). [13C]PCB containing samples were exchanged into 10 mm Tris-DCl (pH 8.5) in 100% D2O. This buffer was found to enhance the stability of SyB-Cph1(GAF) chromoprotein based on the solubility screen of Collins et al. (41Collins B.K. Tomanicek S.J. Lyamicheva N. Kaiser M.W. Mueser T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1674-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For all nonisotopically labeled Cph1 holo-proteins, the same protocol was applied except nonisotopically labeled reagents were used in the M9 medium preparation, and the FPLC purification step was omitted. To test for bilin specificity, the various Phy apoproteins were expressed in the pBAD-6H plasmid as above without co-expression of the HO and BVR genes from pL-PCB. Apo-DrBphP-(PAS-GAF-PHY) C-terminally tagged with a His6 sequence was expressed as described by Karniol et al. (15Karniol B. Wagner J.R. Walker J.M. Vierstra R.D. Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The E. coli cells were resuspended in 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, and 30 mm imidazole and lysed by sonication. The resulting extracts were clarified by centrifugation as above and then mixed with 100 μm of either PCB or BV for 2 h at 4 °C. The polypeptides were purified by nickel-chelate affinity chromatography using 300 mm imidazole for elution. Presence of the covalently bound bilin was assayed by zinc-induced fluorescence of the chromoproteins following SDS-PAGE (8Bhoo S.H. Davis S.J. Walker J. Karniol B. Vierstra R.D. Nature. 2001; 414: 776-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). PCB was purified from lyophilized Spirulina platensis as described (42Scheer H. Smith H.H. Holmes M.G. Techniques in Photomorphogenesis. Academic Press, New York1984: 227-256Google Scholar) but without the final high pressure liquid chromatography step. Purified BV was obtained from Frontier Scientific (Logan, UT). Size Exclusion Chromatography—Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was performed by FPLC using a 24-ml Superose 6 (S6) column (GE Healthcare). The chromoproteins (100 μl of a 5 mg/ml sample) were first purified through the phenyl-HP step, dissolved in 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 200 mm NaCl, and either loaded onto the column as Pr or immediately following saturating irradiation of the samples with red light (620 nm). Absorption spectra were recorded before and after SEC to verify that the chromoproteins remained enriched in the desired states (Pr or Pfr). Absorption and Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Absorption spectra were measured with a Lambda 650 UV-visible spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with the samples dissolved in 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Photoconversions between Pr and Pfr by red and far-red light were achieved with white light filtered through appropriate interference filters (10 nm half-bandwidth) (Andover Corp., Salem, NH), 620-nm and 690-nm filters, respectively, for SyA-Cph1 and SyB-Cph1, and 660-nm and 774-nm filters, respectively, for Syn-Cph1. Thermostability was measured in the dark for Pr samples (absorbance of the Pr absorption maximum was adjusted to 1.5) dissolved in 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). After heating for 20 min at the appropriate temperature, the samples were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g, and the amounts of soluble chromoproteins remaining were measured spectrophotometrically. Rates of Pr → Pfr photoconversion and Pfr → Pr dark reversion were measured using the absorbance of the samples at 704 nm to determine the amount of Pfr generated or lost, respectively. Fluorescence excitation and emission spectra were recorded with a QuantaMaster model C-60/2000 spectrofluorimeter (Photon Technologies International, Birmingham, NJ). Chromoprotein concentrations were adjusted to have an absorbance of 0.6 for the Pr absorbance maximum. Emission spectra were recorded during an excitation at 360 nm. Excitation spectra were recorded by measuring fluorescence at the peak emission wavelength (646-664 nm depending on the sample). RR Spectroscopy—RR spectra were recorded with 1064-nm excitation (Nd-YAG cw laser, line width <1cm-1) using Digilab (Bio-Rad) or an RFS 100/S (Bruker Optics, Ettlinger, Germany) Fourier-transform Raman spectrometer (4 cm-1 spectral resolution). The near-infrared excitation line was sufficiently close to the first electronic transition to generate a strong pre-resonance enhancement of the chromophoric vibrational bands such that Raman bands of the protein matrix remained very weak in the spectra of the parent states (18von Stetten D. Seibeck S. Michael N."
https://openalex.org/W2073685453,"In response to DNA damage, cells activate a signaling pathway that promotes cell cycle arrest and degradation of the cell cycle regulator Cdc25A. Cdc25A degradation occurs via the SCFbeta-TRCP pathway and phosphorylation of Ser-76. Previous work indicates that the checkpoint kinase Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) is capable of phosphorylating Ser-76 in Cdc25A, thereby promoting its degradation. In contrast, other experiments involving overexpression of dominant Chk2 mutant proteins point to a role for Chk2 in Cdc25A degradation. However, loss-of-function studies that implicate Chk2 in Cdc25A turnover are lacking, and there is no evidence that Chk2 is capable of phosphorylating Ser-76 in Cdc25A despite the finding that Chk1 and Chk2 sometimes share overlapping primary specificity. We find that although Chk2 can phosphorylate many of the same sites in Cdc25A that Chk1 phosphorylates, albeit with reduced efficiency, Chk2 is unable to efficiently phosphorylate Ser-76. Consistent with this, Chk2, unlike Chk1, is unable to support SCFbeta-TRCP-mediated ubiquitination of Cdc25A in vitro. In CHK2(-/-) HCT116 cells, the kinetics of Cdc25A degradation in response to ionizing radiation is comparable with that seen in HCT116 cells containing Chk2, indicating that Chk2 is not generally required for timely DNA damage-dependent Cdc25A turnover. In contrast, depletion of Chk1 by RNA interference in CHK2(-/-) cells leads to Cdc25A stabilization in response to ionizing radiation. These data support the idea that Chk1 is the primary signal transducer linking activation of the ATM/ATR kinases to Cdc25A destruction in response to ionizing radiation."

Monopolar spindle 1 (Mps1) is a dual-specificity protein kinase that has important roles in the prevention of aneuploidy during the cell cycle and might therefore be a potential target for new therapeutic agents in the treatment of cancer. To gain insights into the molecular mechanism of Mps1 inhibition by small molecules, we determined the x-ray structure of Mps1, both alone and in complex with the ATP-competitive inhibitor SP600125.

Budirahardja Y. Klompmaker R. Medema R.H. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 866-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In a similar vein, the Mps1-dependent spindle assembly checkpoint is blocked in budding yeast by the action of the compound cincreasin, which rapidly generates non-viable cells (14Dorer R.K. Zhong S.

Given its importance during mitosis, potent Mps1 inhibitors might represent novel therapeutic agents in proliferative disorders (15de Carcer G. de Castro I.P. Malumbres M. Curr. Med. Chem. 2007; 14: 969-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, the design of specific inhibitors has been hampered by the lack of an available structure of the Mps1 catalytic domain. To gain further insights into the mechanism of inhibition of Mps1 by ATP-competitive inhibitors and to aid the development of selective compounds, we have determined the crystal structure of the unphosphorylated form of Mps1 catalytic domain, both alone (apo-kinase) and in complex with SP600125. The catalytic domain of Mps1 adopts the classical fold of protein kinases, with the activation loop packing against the N-terminal lobe, where it induces conformational changes indicative of an inactive form of the enzyme. The structure of the complex with SP600125 shows the inhibitor bound in the ATP-binding site and highlights distinct structural features in the active site cleft that can be exploited for rational drug design. Cloning, Expression, Purification, and Crystallization of Mps1—DNA encoding residues 510–857 of human Mps1 (SP entry P33981) was amplified by PCR and cloned into the vector pET-30 EK/LIC (Novagen). The point mutants D664A and T686A were created by PCR with the wild-type (WT) template using standard mutagenic procedures. Recombinant His-tagged proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells (Novagen). Cells were harvested and then lysed by sonication into buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4 at 4 °C), 500 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 20 mm imidazole, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and an EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). Proteins were purified by affinity chromatography over nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid His·Bind resin (Novagen) and eluted in an imidazole gradient in buffer A followed by size-exclusion chromatography through Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare) in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4 at 4 °C), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and ion-exchange chromatography on a Mono Q column (GE Healthcare), from which proteins were eluted with an NaCl gradient (0–1 m) in 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0 at 4 °C). Prior to crystallization, WT Mps1 was treated with λ-phosphatase (New England Biolabs) overnight at room temperature, to permit dephosphorylation of the kinase, and repurified through a Mono Q column. The purified samples were concentrated to 5 mg·ml-1 in 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0 at 4 °C) and 120 mm NaCl. Mps1 was crystallized using vapor-diffusion methods in a solution containing 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 300 and 0.1 m HEPES (pH 6.5) at 20 °C. X-ray diffraction data were indexed in the space group I222 with unit cell parameters: a = 70.4, b = 103.9, c = 110.5 Å, and a = 70.6, b = 105.2, c = 112.0 for WT and T686A crystals, respectively. The T686A crystals were soaked in a solution containing 1 mm SP600125 inhibitor (anthra(1,9cd)pyrazol-6(2H)-one) (Calbiochem) for 30 min. Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement—Prior to data collection, Mps1 crystals were transferred to a cryoprotectant solution with 20% (v/v) glycerol for 1 min and then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen (WT-apo) or under a nitrogen stream (T686A-SP600125). X-ray diffraction data of Mps1 WT-apo crystals were recorded on beamline I03 (Diamond Light Source, Didcot, UK) at a wavelength of 0.92 Å on an ADSC Q315 3 × 3 CCD detector to 3.14 Å. The T686A-SP600125 crystals diffracted to 2.88 Å, and data were collected on a Raxis IV++ image-plate detector at a wavelength of 1.54 Å using an in-house rotating anode Rigaku MicroMax007 x-ray generator. Initial phases were obtained by the molecular replacement method using MolRep (16Vagin A. Teplyakov A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1622-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) with the coordinates of phosphorylase kinase (Phk) as a search model (PDB ID 1phk). This identified one molecule of WT apo-Mps1 per asymmetric unit, with interpretable electron density for residues Glu-516–Met-671, Asp-681–Met-698, and Ser-709–Gln-794. The structure of Mps1 T686A mutant was solved using molecular replacement with the WT Mps1 coordinates as a search model. The final model included residues Glu-516–Met-671, Asp-681–Met-698, and Ile-711–Thr-795. The R factor and Rfree are 0.223/0.289 and 0.221/0.261 for the final WT-apo and T686A-SP600125 models, respectively (Table 1).

Phosphate incorporation was assessed by autoradiography after SDS-PAGE. Purified WT Mps1 (2 μg) was incubated with 400 units of λ-phosphatase and 2 mm MnCl2 at 30 °C. After 60 min, λ-phosphatase was inactivated with 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, and the reaction mixture was subjected to kinase assay and Western blotting. Mps1 was immunoblotted with either anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Millipore) or anti-Mps1 C-terminal antibody (Millipore). Biochemical Analysis of Mps1 Catalytic Domain—The C-terminal catalytic domain of Mps1, as expressed in bacteria, was assayed for enzymatic activity to validate the native state of the recombinant protein. The affinity-purified Mps1 catalytic domain was active toward the exogenous substrate MBP (Fig. 1A). This suggests that the N-terminal region of Mps1 is not required for enzyme activity, in line with its reported role as a targeting domain (22Liu S.T. Chan G.K.T. Hittle J.C. Fujii G. Lees E. Yen T.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 138-1651Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To investigate the molecular basis of Mps1 activity, we mutated the DFG loop residue Asp-664 to Ala, which completely abolished enzyme activity (Fig. 1A). Another conserved residue, Thr-686, located in the p + 1 loop region (C-terminal to the activation loop) has recently been demonstrated to be autophosphorylated in vitro (8Mattison C.P. Old W.M. Steiner E. Huneycutt B.J. Resing K.A. Ahn N.G. Winey M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30553-30561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Mutation of Thr-686 to Ala also resulted in a catalytically disabled mutant with no kinase activity (Fig. 1A). This suggests that Thr-686 is important for catalytic function and that autophosphorylation of this site may therefore regulate Mps1 activity. The Mps1 catalytic domain was sensitive to the inhibitor SP600125 (Fig. 1A), as previously shown for endogenous Mps1 immunoprecipitated from human cells (13Schmidt M. Budirahardja Y. Klompmaker R. Medema R.H. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 866-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Next, we analyzed the effect of dephosphorylation on the activity of partially purified and electrophoretically pure WT Mps1 catalytic domains (Fig. 1B). We found that Mps1 assayed after gel filtration was phosphorylated on tyrosine residues and active toward MBP (Fig. 1B, lane 1). Subsequently, we dephosphorylated Mps1 with λ-phosphatase and demonstrated that this led to the loss of phosphotyrosine antibody reactivity. Interestingly, however, we were unable to demonstrate enzyme inactivation upon dephosphorylation because the addition of [γ-32P]ATP rapidly led to rephosphorylation of the Mps1 (as evidenced by increased 32P-incorporation) and enzymatic activity toward MBP (Fig. 1B, lane 2). Dephosphorylated Mps1 was further purified on Mono Q, and this dephosphorylated protein was subsequently used for crystallographic trials. This preparation could also reactivate in the presence of ATP (Fig. 1B, lane 3). Overall Structure of Mps1—We have determined the crystal structures of the non-phosphorylated Mps1 catalytic domain apo-enzyme and a complex of the T686A mutant with SP600125. Mps1 exhibits a characteristic bilobal kinase fold, with a small N-terminal lobe (residues Glu-516–Met-602) containing six β-strands and a 20-residue-long α-helix (αC) and a large C-terminal lobe (residues Asn-606–Gln-794) consisting mostly of helices (Fig. 2A). The two lobes are connected by a hinge loop (residues Glu-603–Gly-605) at the back of the active site cleft. The activation loop is only partially visible, with residues Gln-672 to Lys-680 poorly defined in the electron density maps and therefore omitted during refinement. Likewise, residues Ser-699–Lys-708 were not included in the final structure. The overall architecture of Mps1 is very similar to that of Phk (23Owen D.J. Noble M.E. Garman E.F. Papageorgiou A.C. Johnson L.N. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 3: 467-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), with a Cα root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 2.74 Å when 234 Cα atoms were aligned, despite the low sequence homology of 28% in the catalytic domain. An important difference between the structures is the conformation of the activation loop. Phk is a constitutively active kinase that does not require phosphorylation at the activation loop to generate full catalytic activity, whereas phosphorylation of the activation segment in Mps1 is important for enzyme activity (8Mattison C.P. Old W.M. Steiner E. Huneycutt B.J. Resing K.A. Ahn N.G. Winey M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30553-30561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 9Kang J. Chen Y. Zhao Y. Yu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 20232-20237Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In the Phk structure, the activation loop is extended over the C-terminal lobe and anchored by electrostatic interactions with the catalytic loop involving the “RD motif“ (23Owen D.J. Noble M.E. Garman E.F. Papageorgiou A.C. Johnson L.N. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 3: 467-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), comparable with the active conformation of phosphorylated cAPK (24Knighton D.R. Zheng J.H. Ten Eyck L.F. Ashford V.A. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1467) Google Scholar). This extended conformation allows full access to the ATP-binding site in the active site cleft and creates a substrate-binding interface at the C-terminal (p + 1) region of the activation loop. In contrast, the activation loop in Mps1 bends back to the N-terminal lobe, partially occluding the active site cleft opening, disrupting the N-terminal anchor of the activation loop, and displacing the αC helix (Fig. 2B). As a consequence of this displacement, Glu-571 in αC is unable to form ionic interactions with Lys-553 (Fig. 2B). The orientation of this conserved lysine residue is important for proper alignment of the ATP phosphates in productive catalysis and transfer of the γ-phosphate to the substrate (23Owen D.J. Noble M.E. Garman E.F. Papageorgiou A.C. Johnson L.N. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 3: 467-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 24Knighton D.R. Zheng J.H. Ten Eyck L.F. Ashford V.A. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1467) Google Scholar). This orientation is maintained by an ionic interaction with the conserved glutamic acid residue in the αC helix. The displacement of αC in the structure of the unphosphorylated Mps1, and subsequent disengagement of this ion pair, suggests that the orientation of Lys-553 is not optimal for catalysis. Displacement of the αC helix due to steric hindrance by the activation loop has been described for other kinases of the Src kinase family (25Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar) and recognized as an important mechanism for regulating enzyme activity (26Nolen B. Taylor S.S. Ghosh G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 15: 661-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (825) Google Scholar). A similar structural flexibility was observed for Aurora A, a mitotic kinase that is also regulated by autophosphorylation (27Eyers P.A. Erikson E. Chen L.G. Maller J.L. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 691-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The structure of unphosphorylated Aurora A in complex with adenosine shows an identical disengagement of the Lys-Glu interaction, driven by hindrance from the activation loop (28Cheetham G.M. Knegtel R.M. Coll J.T. Renwick S.B. Swenson L. Weber P. Lippke J.A. Austen D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42419-42422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In contrast, the structure of phosphorylated Aurora A (29Bayliss R. Sardon T. Vernos I. Conti E. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 851-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), exhibits a conformational change in the activation loop, which appears more extended toward the C-terminal lobe, resulting in the realignment of αC and positioning of Glu-181 in closer contact with Lys-162 (Fig. 2B). We predict that a comparable regulatory mechanism is likely to apply to Mps1, where phosphorylation at the activation loop may drive conformational changes that release the steric hindrance of αC, restoring Lys-553 interaction with Glu-571. This is supported in part by our biochemical data, which demonstrate that the inactive state of Mps1, as observed in the crystal structure, can be reversed by the addition of ATP in vitro, which induces autophosphorylation and recovery of catalytic activity (Fig. 1B). A high resolution structure of active phosphorylated Mps1 is needed to corroborate this model. Structural comparison with other kinases shows that except for Lys-553, the remainder of the conserved catalytic residues are correctly oriented in unphosphorylated Mps1. These include Asp-646 in the catalytic loop, which is involved in phosphate transfer to the substrate, and Asp-664 in the DFG loop, which coordinates the magnesium ion for ATP hydrolysis. Another important implication of the activation loop conformation in unphosphorylated Mps1 is the lack of electrostatic interactions between the catalytic loop and the p + 1 loop, where the functionally important Thr-686 residue is located. The effect of mutation at Thr-686 is not clear since mutation to Asp to mimic phosphorylation does not rescue the activity of budding yeast Mps1 (8Mattison C.P. Old W.M. Steiner E. Huneycutt B.J. Resing K.A. Ahn N.G. Winey M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30553-30561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) or human Mps1. 6Tyler, R. K., Chu, M. L. H., Johnson, H., McKenzie, E. A., Gaskell, S. J., and Eyers, P. A., submitted for publication. Although this residue is well defined in the density maps of the apo-kinase structure, there are no obvious interactions with the catalytic loop, as found in other active kinases, or with other regions of the kinase domain. The structure of the T686A mutant has an almost identical conformation at the p + 1 loop as the WT structure (Fig. 2C). One possible explanation is that upon phosphorylation, conformational changes in the activation loop could bring this residue in closer contact to the catalytic loop for interaction. Phosphorylation of Thr-686 may be required to mediate such interactions, as observed for the phosphorylated activation loop residue in many kinases (26Nolen B. Taylor S.S. Ghosh G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 15: 661-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Alignment of the p + 1 loop with the catalytic loop is important in forming the substrate-binding interface and is critical for kinase activity in Ser/Thr kinases (26Nolen B. Taylor S.S. Ghosh G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 15: 661-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (825) Google Scholar). The essential role of Thr-686 for catalytic activity (Fig. 1A) could therefore reflect a contribution to substrate binding. Complex of Mps1 with SP600125—SP600125 is an ATP-competitive kinase inhibitor, which was originally described as an inhibitor of JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3 (10Bennet B.L. Sasaki D.T. Murray B.W. O'Leary E.C. Sakata S.T. Xu W. Leisten J.C. Motiwala A. Pierce S. Satoh Y. Bhagwat S.S. Manning A.M. Anderson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13681-13686Crossref PubMed Scopus (2244) Google Scholar). It has also been valuable to validate the cellular functions of Mps1, with which JNK isoforms share some conserved features in the ATP-binding site (5Jelluma N. Brenkman A.B. van den Broek N.J. Cruijsen C.W. van Osch M.H. Lens S.M. Medema R.H. Kops G.J. Cell. 2008; 132: 233-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 13Schmidt M. Budirahardja Y. Klompmaker R. Medema R.H. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 866-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We observed that inhibition of the purified Mps1 catalytic domain was >90% complete in the presence of 10 μm SP600125 (Fig. 1A). To determine the mode of binding of this compound, we solved the structure of the T686A-SP600215 complex. The structures of both WT Mps1 apo-kinase and T686A-SP600125 exhibit only minor differences when superimposed, with an overall Cα r.m.s.d. of only 0.44 Å when 258 Cα atoms were aligned. The difference electron density map clearly showed SP600125 bound in the adenine-binding pocket, at the interface between the N- and C-terminal lobes (Fig. 3A). The binding site is lined with non-aromatic hydrophobic residues, including Ile-531, Val-539, and Ala-551 at the top and Ile-586, Ile-663, and Leu-654 at the bottom, which sandwich the inhibitor (Fig. 3A). Binding is further strengthened by hydrogen bonds between SP600215 N1 and Gly-605 main-chain NH and SP600125 N2 and Glu-603 main-chain carbonyl oxygen (Fig. 3A). This binding mode is similar to that observed in the JNK1-SP600125 complex, including van der Waals contacts with Met-602. This methionine is conserved in JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3, protein kinase B, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase but not in several other kinases sensitive to inhibition by SP600125 (11Heo S.H. Kim S.K. Seo C.I. Kim Y.K. Sung B.J. Lee H.S. Lee J.I. Park S.Y. Kim J.H. Hwang K.Y. Hyun Y.L. Jeon Y.L. Ro S. Cho J.M. Lee T.G. Yang C.H. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2185-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), and the importance of Met-602 for inhibition of Mps1 activity has already been demonstrated by mutagenesis of this residue (13Schmidt M. Budirahardja Y. Klompmaker R. Medema R.H. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 866-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). By comparing the Mps1 and JNK1 inhibitor-binding sites, we observed several differences that could be exploited for structure-based drug design to aid the development of Mps1-specific compounds. Of particular interest is the replacement of the hydrophobic Leu-110 in JNK1 by Cys-604 in Mps1. This represents a possible target for polar or disulfide interactions by inhibitor molecules. In addition, differences between the position of Ile-663 side chain in Mps1 and that of Leu-168 in JNK1 generate a cavity at the bottom floor of the hydrophobic pocket, which might specifically accommodate alternative groups at the carbonyl oxygen position of the inhibitor (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, as an extension of the ATP-binding site, we also identified a secondary pocket at the internal face of αC. This pocket is made available in the unphosphorylated form of Mps1 because of the disruption of the Glu-571-Lys-553 ion pair but not in JNK1, where this interaction is maintained. The smaller size of the secondary pocket in JNK1 is also explained by the position of Met-77 and Ile-106 side chains that form a gate, occluding the pocket (Fig. 3B). In Mps1, this pocket contains two tyrosine residues, Tyr-568 and Tyr-591, which could be targeted for π-stacking interactions with inhibitors to improve specificity. The secondary pocket accommodates a molecule of PEG from the crystallization solution, where it wraps around Lys-553 in an orientation that promotes electrostatic interactions with its ether oxygens (Fig. 3C). Our finding that this secondary pocket is present in the unphosphorylated form of the kinase suggests that inhibitors developed to interact in this region could be used to target inactive Mps1. This might provide a selective advantage for the mechanism of inhibition by a small molecule. A similar strategy has proved especially important in the development of therapeutic inhibitors such as Imatinib, which bind with high affinity to an unphosphorylated, inactive species of the tyrosine kinase BCR-ABL (30Nagar B. Bornmann W.G. Pellicena P. Schindler T. Veach D.R. Miller W.T. Clarkson B. Kuriyan J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4236-4243PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, we present the first crystallographic structure of human Mps1, an important regulator of chromosomal stability and a potential target in cancer therapy. The unphosphorylated form of the kinase domain shows a closed activation loop conformation, which causes long range alterations of the catalytic lysine residue, thus suggesting a potential mechanism of Mps1 activation by phosphorylation. A complex with the ATP-competitive inhibitor SP600125 reveals several important structural features and additional binding sites that could be exploited for the development of specific Mps1 inhibitors.

https://openalex.org/W1966849446,"Human platelets express protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) and PAR4 but limited data indicate for differences in signal transduction. We studied the involvement of PAR1 and PAR4 in the cross-talk between thrombin and epinephrine. The results show that epinephrine acted via α2A-adrenergic receptors to provoke aggregation, secretion, and Ca2+ mobilization in aspirin-treated platelets pre-stimulated with subthreshold concentrations of thrombin. Incubating platelets with antibodies against PAR4 or the PAR4-specific inhibitor pepducin P4pal-i1 abolished the aggregation. Furthermore, platelets pre-exposed to the PAR4-activating peptide AYPGKF, but not to the PAR1-activating peptide SFLLRN, were aggregated by epinephrine, whereas both AYPGKF and SFLLRN synergized with epinephrine in the absence of aspirin. The roles of released ATP and ADP were elucidated by using antagonists of the purinergic receptors P2X1, P2Y1, and P2Y12 (i.e. NF449, MRS2159, MRS2179, and cangrelor). Intriguingly, ATP, but not ADP, was required for the epinephrine/thrombin-induced aggregation. In Western blot analysis, a low concentration of AYPGKF, but not SFLLRN, stimulated phosphorylation of Akt on serine 473. Moreover, the phosphatidyl inositide 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 antagonized the effect of epinephrine combined with thrombin or AYPGKF. Thus, in aspirin-treated platelets, PAR4, but not PAR1, interacts synergistically with α2A-adrenergic receptors, and the PI3-kinase/Akt pathway is involved in this cross-talk. Furthermore, in PAR4-pretreated platelets, epinephrine caused dense granule secretion, and subsequent signaling from the ATP-gated P2X1-receptor and the α2A-adrenergic receptor induced aggregation. These results suggest a new mechanism that has ATP as a key element and circumvents the action of aspirin on epinephrine-facilitated PAR4-mediated platelet activation.

Upon injury of a vessel wall, subendothelial structures such as collagen and tissue factor are exposed to the blood. Collagen activates platelets directly, whereas tissue factor initiates the coagulation cascade and thereby induces formation of thrombin, which is considered to be the most powerful platelet activator. Two G-protein-coupled thrombin receptor subtypes designated protease-activated receptors 1 (PAR1) 4The abbreviations used are: PAR, protease-activated receptor; [Ca2+]i, cytosolic Ca2+ concentration; ERK2, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2; PI3-kinase, phosphatidyl inositide 3-kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; PRP, platelet-rich plasma; EPI, epinephrine; THR, thrombin. 4The abbreviations used are: PAR, protease-activated receptor; [Ca2+]i, cytosolic Ca2+ concentration; ERK2, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2; PI3-kinase, phosphatidyl inositide 3-kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; PRP, platelet-rich plasma; EPI, epinephrine; THR, thrombin. and PAR4 are expressed on the surface of human platelets. Thrombin acts on these receptors by cleaving the N-terminal extension to create a new N terminus that functions as a tethered ligand. The subsequent signal transduction pathway comprises phosphorylation cascades and rises in the cytosolic concentration of Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i). The biphasic Ca2+ response induced by thrombin can be separated into two discrete components, a rapid spike response, caused mainly by PAR1 activation, followed by a slower and prolonged response of PAR4, possibly caused by slower uncoupling from G-protein signaling (1Covic L. Gresser A.L. Kuliopulos A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5458-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 2Shapiro M.J. Weiss E.J. Faruqi T.R. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25216-25221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Both PAR1 and PAR4 activate the Gαq and Gα12/13 proteins (3Offermans S. Laugwitz K.L. Spicher K. Schultz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 504-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), but recent publications have indicated differences in the signal transduction pathways (4Holinstat M. Voss B. Bilodeau M.L. Hamm H.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 686-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 5Mazharian A. Roger S. Berrou E. Adam F. Kauskot A. Nurden P. Jandrot Perrus M. Bryckaert M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5478-5487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, the precise role of PAR4 signaling in platelet activation is still unclear. For instance, it is assumed that PAR1 is the high affinity thrombin receptor, whereas PAR4 may contribute to platelet activation only at higher thrombin concentrations (6Kahn M.L. Zheng Y.W. Huang W. Bigornia V. Zeng D. Moff S. Farese Jr., R.V. Tam C. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 1998; 394: 690-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cleavage of PAR1 alone is sufficient to cause complete release of ADP from dense granules (7Covic L. Singh C. Smith H. Kuliopulos A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2002; 87: 722-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).The response of platelets to a primary stimulus is amplified (both in vitro and in vivo) by different feedback loops, such as the release of ADP from the dense granules. ADP binds to two subtypes of G-protein-coupled purinergic receptors, designated P2Y1 and P2Y12 (8Daniel J.L. Dangelmaier C. Jin J. Ashby B. Smith J.B. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2024-2029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), and antagonists to purinergic receptors are now used clinically to control misdirected platelet activation. During dense granule secretion, ATP is concomitantly released to the extracellular environment, and platelets express ATP-gated Ca2+ channels called P2X1 receptors. Nevertheless, compared with ADP, the role of ATP in platelet activation is less well established.Circulating hormones such as epinephrine also participate in the interplay between different platelet activators. Epinephrine causes aggregation in platelet-rich plasma (PRP), but many investigators consider that epinephrine should be classified as a “potentiating” stimulus (9Steen V.M. Holmsen H. Aarbakke G.

However, research has not yet revealed the significance of different thrombin receptor subtypes and the importance of a secondary release of ADP and ATP in the cross-talk between thrombin and epinephrine. Epinephrine acts by binding to the Gz-coupled α2A-adrenergic receptor (Gz is a Gi variant), which inhibits cyclic AMP production (11Jakobs K.H. Wieland T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). From a mechanistic perspective, epinephrine has been found to potentiate the Ca2+ mobilization induced by thrombin and other agonists (12Keularts I.M. van Gorp R.M. Feijge M.A. Vuist W.M.

Activation of Syk tyrosine kinase, protein kinase C (PKC), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) have also been implicated in the interaction between thrombin and other platelet activators (12Keularts I.M. van Gorp R.M.

Indeed, we found that PAR4, but not PAR1, interacted synergistically with the α2A-adrenergic receptor to cause pronounced platelet activation. Intriguingly, we also noted that released ATP had a significant impact on platelet aggregation. This suggests both a vital role for PAR4 and an unexpectedly strong effect of ATP in the process of platelet activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The peptides TRAP-6 (SFLLRN) and AYPGKF, which are agonists of the thrombin receptor subtypes PAR1 and PAR4, respectively, were synthesized by the Biotechnology Centre of Oslo, Oslo University, Norway. The PAR4-blocking polyclonal chicken antibody was directed against a peptide that spans the thrombin cleavage site, which has the sequence GGDDSTPSILPAPRGYPGQVC. The peptide was synthesized by the Biotechnology Center of Oslo and used to immunize chickens. Chicken antibodies, in contrast to mammalian antibodies, do not cause platelet activation per se and are less likely to produce artifacts (16Lindahl T.L. Festin R. Larsson A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1992; 68: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, three laying white leghorn hens were immunized with the PAR4 peptide (2.0 mg) conjugated to hemocyanin (6.6 mg; obtained from Concholepas concholepas). The hens received one immunization with Freund's complete adjuvant and three booster injections with incomplete adjuvant. After the immunization period the eggs from the three hens were collected, and the antibodies were purified from the egg yolk by the polyethylene glycol method (17Akita E.M. Nakai S. J. Immunol. Methods. 1993; 160: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar).Innovagen (Lund, Sweden) synthesized the cell-penetrating pepducin P4pal-i1 (palmitate-NH-ATGAPRLST), which resembles the first intracellular loop of PAR4 and can, therefore, selectively inhibit PAR4 activation by interfering with binding of the G-protein (18Leger A.J.

The PAR1 antagonist SCH79797 dihydrochloride (N3-Cyclopropyl-7-[4-(1m-ethylethyl) phenyl] methyl-7H-pyrrolo [3,2-f]quinazoline-1,3-diamine dihydrochloride) was obtained from Tocris Cookson Ltd. (Bristol, UK). The polyclonal rabbit antibody (#9271) directed against serine 437-phosphorylated Akt was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA), and the phycoerythrin-conjugated SPAN12 antibody was from Immunotech (Marseilles, France). The lysing solution came from Diapensia HB (Linköping, Sweden).Cangrelor (formerly AR-C69931MX; N6-(2-methyl-tioethyl)-2-(3,3,3-trifluoro propylthio)-β,γ-dichloromethylene ATP tetrasodium salt) was kindly provided by AstraZeneca (Dr. Michael Wayne, Wilmington, DE) and the Medicines Co. We also used the following drugs (all from Sigma): ADP, aspirin, apyrase, α,β-MeATP, epinephrine, fura-2, ionomycin, LY 294002, luciferin/luciferase bioluminescent kit, MRS2159, MRS2179, NF449, prazosine, Ro318220, thrombin, UK 14.304, and yohimbine.Isolation of Human Platelets—Human blood was collected from healthy volunteers and immediately mixed with an acid-citrate-dextrose (ACD) solution (5 volumes blood, 1 volume ACD) comprising 85 mm sodium citrate, 71 mm citric acid, and 111 mm glucose. The blood was centrifuged for 20 min at 220 × g to obtain PRP. Aspirin (100 μm) and apyrase (1 units/ml) were added to the PRP to prevent platelet activation by thromboxane A2 and ADP during the isolation procedure; in some experimental settings aspirin was excluded from the isolation protocol. The PRP was subsequently centrifuged for 20 min at 480 × g to obtain a platelet pellet. The supernatant was removed, and the platelets were gently resuspended in HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) composed of 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 10 mm HEPES, 1 units/ml apyrase, and 10 mm glucose. The platelet suspensions were stored in plastic tubes at room temperature and were used within 3 h of preparation. The extracellular Ca2+ concentration was adjusted to 1 mm immediately before each measurement.Experimental Designs—Platelets were exposed to various concentrations of thrombin (0.21–21 nm) and, after 3 min, also to epinephrine (0.1–10 μm). In one experimental design, the time of incubation with thrombin (before adding epinephrine) was varied from 15 s to 5 min.Platelets were also exposed to the PAR1- and PAR4-activating peptides SFLLRN (0.3–12.5 μm) and AYPGKF (30–300 μm) followed by 10 μm epinephrine. Another method used to evaluate the significance of PAR4 and PAR1 activation was to initially incubate platelets with a PAR4-blocking antibody (10 μg/ml), an unspecific IgY antibody (10 μg/ml), the PAR4-specific inhibitor pepducin P4pal-i1 (10 μm), or the PAR1 antagonist SCH79797 (5 μm) for 5 min and then expose them to thrombin and epinephrine.The role of secondary release of ADP was evaluated by preincubating platelets for 3 min with the P2Y1 antagonist MRS2179 (10–20 μm) and/or the P2Y12 antagonist cangrelor (10–100 nm). Correspondingly, released ATP was analyzed by pretreating platelets for 3 min with the P2X1 antagonists MRS2159 (0.01–10 μm) and NF449 (0.1–10 μm).Measurement of Cytosolic Ca2+—Platelets were loaded with fura-2 by incubating PRP with 4 μm fura-2-acetoxymethylester (from a 4 mm stock solution dissolved in DMSO) for 45 min at 20 °C, and they were subsequently pelleted and resuspended as described under “Isolation of human platelets,” above. Before each measurement, 2 ml of platelet suspension (1–2 × 108/ml) was incubated at 37 °C for 5 min and then exposed to different drugs (see “Experimental designs,” above). Fluorescence signals from platelet suspensions were recorded using a Hitachi F-2000 fluorescence spectrofluorometer specially designed to measure [Ca2+]i. Fluorescence emission was determined at 510 nm, with simultaneous excitation at 340 and 380 nm. [Ca2+]i was calculated according to the general equation reported by Grynkiewicz et al. (19Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar): [Ca2+]i = Kd(R – Rmin)/(Rmax – R) (Fo/Fo). Maximum and minimum ratios were determined by adding 0.1% Triton X-100 and 25 mm EGTA, respectively.Measurement of Platelet Aggregation—Aliquots (0.5 ml) of platelet suspensions (2.5 × 108 platelets/ml) were preincubated at 37 °C for 2 min. Thereafter, platelet aggregation was induced by adding thrombin, PAR-activating peptides, and epinephrine. Changes in light transmission were recorded using a Chronolog Dual Channel lumi-aggregometer (Model 560, Chrono-Log, Haverston, PA).Measurement of Dense Granule Secretion—The amount of liberated ATP in platelet suspensions (0.5-ml aliquots; 2.5 × 108 platelets/ml) was registered using a luciferin/luciferase bioluminescent kit. Secretion of ATP was induced by adding thrombin or PAR-activating peptides alone or combined with epinephrine. The ATP-dependent increase in bioluminescence was recorded in the Chronolog lumi-aggregometer.Analysis of Serine-phosphorylated Akt—Isolated platelets (1–2 × 109/ ml; 100-μl aliquots) were prewarmed at 37 °C for 3 min and then incubated with SFLLRN, AYPGKF, or thrombin for 5 min. The reaction was stopped by mixing platelet suspensions (1:2 v/v) with Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad; 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, 25% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 5% mercaptoethanol (pH 6.8)) and subsequently heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Thereafter, the samples were stored at –70 °C until used.To analyze serine 473-phosphorylated Akt, the samples were again heated at 95 °C for 5 min and then separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE using a Mini-PROTEAN II electrophoresis cell (Bio-Rad). The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.) using a Mini Trans-Blot Electrophoretic Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad). To minimize unspecific binding, the membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C with 5% (w/v) dry milk and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) composed of 10 mm phosphate buffer and 150 mm NaCl. To detect of phosphorylated Akt, a polyclonal rabbit antibody against the serine 437 position of Akt and a secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody were used at dilutions of 1:1000 (Cell Signaling Technology). The membranes were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 between incubations and then analyzed using ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) in a LAS-1000 Imaging Analyzer (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan).Statistical Analysis—The results are expressed as the mean values ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined by applying Student's t test or analysis of variance followed by Dunette's post hoc test for multiple comparisons, as indicated. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism4™ (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).RESULTSSynergistic Interaction between Thrombin and Epinephrine in Mobilizing Cytosolic Ca2+—First, we evaluated the effect of the interaction between thrombin and epinephrine on the mobilization of cytosolic Ca2+. In fura-2-loaded, aspirin-treated platelets, thrombin caused a concentration-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i that was detectable at 0.21 nm and reached a maximum at around 7–21 nm (Fig. 1A). Epinephrine alone did not cause Ca2+ mobilization. However, in platelets pre-stimulated with thrombin, epinephrine (0.1–10 μm) induced a significant rise in [Ca2+]i (original traces in Fig. 1A; results are summarized in Figs. 1, B and C). Notably, the capacity of epinephrine to mobilize cytosolic Ca2+ was virtually independent of the concentration of thrombin (see Figs. 1, A and B). Hence, the magnitude of the epinephrine-induced rise in [Ca2+]i was about 100 nm in platelets pre-stimulated with low, intermediate, and high concentrations of thrombin.As shown in the inset in Fig. 1, epinephrine did not increase the [Ca2+]i in platelets pretreated with ADP (10 μm), platelet-activating factor (1 μm), or the Ca2+-ionophore ionomycin (50 nm). Moreover, a combination of activators (e.g. ADP combined with 10 μm lysophosphatidic acid) was not followed by an epinephrine-induced Ca2+ response (not shown). Thus, the Ca2+-mobilizing capacity of epinephrine in platelets seems to require pre-stimulation with thrombin.Involvement of PAR1 and PAR4 in Epinephrine-induced Ca2+ Mobilization—To clarify the relative roles of different subtypes of thrombin receptors, we treated platelets with the PAR1- and PAR4-activating peptides (SFLLRN and AYPGKF, respectively) followed by epinephrine (Figs. 2, A and B). Both SFLLRN (0.3–12.5 μm) and AYPGKF (30–300 μm) dose-dependently increased the [Ca2+]i. However, only in AYPGKF-pretreated platelets did subsequent exposure to epinephrine (10 μm; added 3 min after the PAR-activating peptides) cause a significant increase in [Ca2+]i (traces shown in Fig. 2A; results summarized in Fig. 2C). Moreover, preincubation of platelets with PAR4-blocking antibodies (10 μg/ml) or the PAR4-specific inhibitor pepducin P4pal-i1 (10 μm) antagonized the epinephrine-induced rise in [Ca2+]i in platelets preactivated with thrombin (results are summarized in Table 1; original traces are shown in the inset in Fig. 2A). Irrelevant isotype antibodies did not influence the effect of epinephrine (Table 1). SPAN-12 is an antibody that can only bind to the platelet PAR1 receptor when it is not cleaved by thrombin (20Molino M. Bainton D.F. Hoxie J.A. Coughlin S.R. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6011-6017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in a recent study, we found that binding of SPAN-12 to platelets was not influenced by the PAR4-blocking antibody, which indicates that those antibodies did not affect thrombin-induced cleavage of PAR1 (21Vretenbrant K. Ramström S. Bjerke M. Lindahl T.L. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2007; 97: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It should be mentioned that, because of its autofluorescence properties, the PAR1 antagonist SCH79797 could not be used in this experimental design. The role of adrenergic receptors was evaluated by pretreating platelets with the α2-adrenergic receptor antagonist yohimbine (1 μm) or the α1-adrenergic receptor antagonist prazosine (1 μm) and then exposing them to thrombin and epinephrine. Yohimbine, but not prazosine, abolished the epinephrine-induced Ca2+ mobilization (data not shown), which implies that the effect of epinephrine is mediated by α2A-adrenergic receptors.FIGURE 2The Ca2+-mobilizing effect of PAR-activating peptides and epinephrine. A, original traces of fura-2-loaded platelets exposed to the PAR1-activating peptide SFLLRN (0.3–12.5 μm) and the PAR4-activating peptide AYPGKF (30–300 μm). EPI (10 μm) was introduced 3 min after the PAR-activating peptides. The two traces to the right show the Ca2+-mobilizing capacity of epinephrine introduced 1 or 3 min after THR (0.7 nm). Inset, platelets stimulated with thrombin (0.7 nm) and epinephrine (10 μm) in the absence (Ctrl) and presence of the PAR4-specific inhibitor pepducin P4pal-i1 (10 μm).

Open table in a new tab We also found that the Ca2+-mobilizing effect of epinephrine in thrombin-pretreated platelets was strictly time-dependent. More exactly, the magnitude of the Ca2+ response gradually increased and reached a maximum level when epinephrine was introduced 3 min after thrombin (Figs. 2, A and D). Interestingly, AYPGKF-pretreated platelets responded more rapidly to epinephrine. As shown in Fig. 2D, the maximum magnitude of the epinephrine-induced Ca2+ response was observed only 1 min after the introduction of the PAR4-activating peptide. In SFLLRN-pretreated platelets, epinephrine induced a detectable Ca2+ response when the time gap was reduced to 1 min (Fig. 2D). However, the response induced by epinephrine was always much smaller than that caused by pre-exposing platelets to the PAR4-activating peptide AYPGKF or thrombin. Taken together, these results show that pre-stimulation of PAR4, but not PAR1, is necessary for epinephrine-induced Ca2+ mobilization in aspirin-treated platelets.Effect of PAR1 Activation on the Interplay between PAR4 and the α2A-Adrenergic Receptor—We found that pre-exposure of platelets to SFLLRN (12.5 μm) for 1 min significantly reduced subsequent Ca2+ responses triggered by AYPGKF (100 μm) and epinephrine (10 μm). Notably, this antagonizing effect was abolished when the time elapsed between SFLLRN and AYPGKF treatment was increased to 3 min (data not shown). In a slightly modified protocol, SFLLRN was introduced 1 min after AYPGKF and consequently 2 min before epinephrine. Even in this experimental design, activation of PAR1 significantly reduced the rise in [Ca2+]i caused by epinephrine (Fig. 3A). Specifically, the peak epinephrine-induced rise in [Ca2+]i was 71.6 ± 14.3 nm in platelets pretreated with AYPGKF alone and 43.3 ± 12.1 nm in those exposed to AYPGKF followed by SFLLRN (n = 5, p < 0.01). Thus, the results indicate that PAR1 signaling temporarily antagonizes the interplay between PAR4 and epinephrine. PKC has been implicated in the phenomenon of receptor desensitization (13Crouch M.F. Lapetina E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 584-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Hardy A.R. Conley P.B. Lou J. Benovic J.L. Poole A.W. Mundell S.J. Blood. 2005; 105: 3552-3560Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and therefore, we analyzed involvement of this signaling molecule in the antagonistic action of PAR1 on the epinephrine-induced increase in [Ca2+]i. Preincubation of the platelets with the PKC inhibitor Ro318220 (0.3 μm) abolished the suppressive effect of SFLLRN on epinephrine-induced Ca2+ mobilization (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, such treatment with Ro318220 significantly enhanced the epinephrine-induced Ca2+ response in platelets pre-stimulated with thrombin or SFLLRN (Fig. 3B). However, the latter effect was not observed in AYPGKF preactivated platelets. Together, these findings indicate that PAR1-mediated activation of PKC transiently inhibits the interaction between PAR4 and the α2A-adrenergic receptor.FIGURE 3Effects of the PKC inhibitor Ro31220 on Ca2+ mobilization. A, original traces of fura-2-loaded platelets stimulated with the PAR4-activating peptide AYPGKF (100 μm) followed by the PAR1-activating peptide SFLLRN (12.5 μm) and finally EPI (10 μm). SFLLRN and epinephrine were introduced 1 and 3 min, respectively, after stimulation with AYPGKF, as indicated by the arrows. In some experiments the platelets were pretreated for 3 min with the PKC inhibitor Ro318220 (0.3 μm; RO). The traces shown represent one of five separate experiments. B, summarized effects of the PKC inhibitor Ro318220 on epinephrine-induced peak rises in [Ca2+]i in platelets. Platelet suspensions were treated with Ro318220 for 3 min, after which THR (7 nm), SFLLRN (12.5 μm), or AYPGKF (100 μm) was added. Epinephrine (10 μm) was introduced 3 min later.

Ctrl, control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Synergistic Interaction between PAR4 and the α2A-Adrenergic Receptor on Platelet Aggregation—We also evaluated the effect of epinephrine added together with low concentrations of thrombin and PAR1- and PAR4-activating peptides on aggregation in aspirin-treated platelets. The aggregation response to thrombin alone was detectable down to a concentration of about 0.21 nm. In contrast, epinephrine alone did not induce platelet aggregation. Preincubation of platelets for 3 min with a subthreshold concentration of thrombin (i.e. a dose that did not directly provoke aggregation, 0.07–0.21 nm) markedly amplified aggregation subsequently induced by 10 μm epinephrine (original traces shown in Fig. 4A; results are summarized in Fig. 4B). Platelets stimulated with thrombin (0.21 nm) and pretreated with PAR4-blocking antibodies (10 μg/ml) or the PAR4-specific inhibitor pepducin P4pal-i1 (10 μm) exhibited no aggregation upon subsequent exposure to epinephrine (Figs. 4, A and C). Adding a higher dose of thrombin (not shown) or the PAR1-activating peptide SFLLRN easily overcame the inhibition induced by the PAR4-blocking antibodies or P4pal-i1 (Fig. 4A; traces to the right). Furthermore, both the PAR4-blocking antibodies and P4pal-i1 abolished aggregation responses induced by high concentrations (100–300 μm) of AYPGKF (Fig. 4A, inset). On the other hand, the platelets reacted normally to subsequent addition of 12.5 μm SFLLRN. Incubati"

We have hypothesized that an abnormally increased NO production in the pancreatic islets might be an important factor in the pathogenesis of beta-cell dysfunction.We show now that islets of type 2 spontaneous diabetes in GK rats display excessive NO generation associated with abnormal iNOS expression in insulin and glucagon cells, increased ncNOS activity, impaired glucose-stimulated insulin release, glucagon hypersecretion, and impaired glucose-induced glucagon suppression. Pharmacological blockade of islet NO production by the NOS inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) greatly improved hormone secretion from GK islets suggesting islet NOS activity being an important target to inactivate for amelioration of islet cell function. The incretin hormone GLP-1, which is used in clinical practice suppressed iNOS and ncNOS expression and activity with almost full restoration of insulin release and partial restoration of glucagon release. GLP-1 suppression of iNOS expression was reversed by PKA inhibition but unaffected by the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Injection of glucose plus GLP-1 in the diabetic rats showed that GLP-1 amplified the insulin response but induced a transient increase and then a poor depression of glucagon.The results suggest that abnormally increased NO production within islet cells is a significant player in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes being counteracted by GLP-1 through PKA-dependent, nonproteasomal mechanisms."

Using the CHAPSO-solubilized γ-secretase assay system, we previously found that γ-secretase activity was sensitive to the concentrations of detergent and phosphatidylcholine. This strongly suggests that the composition of the lipid bilayer has a significant impact on the activity of γ-secretase. Recently, level of secreted β-amyloid protein was reported to be attenuated by increasing levels of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) in cultured cells. However, it is not clear whether PI(4,5)P2 has a direct effect on γ-secretase activity. In this study, we found that phosphoinositides directly inhibited CHAPSO-solubilized γ-secretase activity. Interestingly, neither phosphatidylinositol nor inositol triphosphate altered γ-secretase activity. PI(4,5)P2 was also found to inhibit γ-secretase activity in CHAPSO-insoluble membrane microdomains (rafts). Kinetic analysis of β-amyloid protein production in the presence of PI(4,5)P2 suggested a competitive inhibition. Even though phosphoinositides are minor phospholipids of the membrane, the concentration of PI(4,5)P2 within the intact membrane has been reported to be in the range of 4–8 mm. The presence of PI(4,5)P2-rich rafts in the membrane has been reported in a range of cell types. Furthermore, γ-secretase is enriched in rafts. Taking these data together, we propose that phosphoinositides potentially regulate γ-secretase activity by suppressing its association with the substrate. γ-Secretase is an aspartic protease that hydrolyzes type I membrane proteins within the hydrophobic environment of the lipid bilayer.

(8Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5121) Google Scholar). The luminal portion of β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) is removed by β-secretase leaving the carboxyl-terminal fragment (βCTF or C99), which is the immediate substrate of γ-secretase, in the membrane (9Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P. Loeloff R. Luo Y. Fisher S. Fuller J. Edenson S. Lile J. Jarosinski M.A. Biere A.L. Curran E. Burgess T. Louis J.C. Collins F. Treanor J. Rogers G. Citron M. Science. 1999; 286: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3255) Google Scholar). γ-Secretase cleaves C99 in the middle of its transmembrane domain (γ-cleavage). This leads to release of β-amyloid (Aβ) protein that is the major component of senile plaques, one of the neuropathological hallmarks of AD (8Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5121) Google Scholar). Besides γ-cleavage, we and other groups have identified ϵ-cleavage that occurs close to the membrane/cytoplasmic boundary of APP (10Gu Y. Misonou H. Sato T. Dohmae N. Takio K. Ihara Y. J. Biol.

Familial AD mutations in presenilin 1/2 and APP invariably increase the level of AICD49–99, a potential counterpart of Aβ48, as well as the ratio of Aβ42/Aβ40 (13Sato T. Dohmae N. Qi Y. Kakuda N.

In addition, the expression of Aβ48 in cultured cells was shown to lead to an increase in the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio (14Funamoto S. Morishima-Kawashima M. Tanimura Y. Hirotani N. Saido T.C. Ihara Y. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13532-13540Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Thus ϵ-cleavage may determine the site preference of the γ-cleavage and the final Aβ species.Recently, we established a CHAPSO-solubilized γ-secretase assay system that exhibits high specific activity (15Kakuda N.

We confirmed that equimolar amounts of Aβ and AICD were produced from C99 by γ-secretase. In a series of experiments, we noted that the concentrations of detergent and phosphatidylcholine significantly affected γ-secretase activity (15Kakuda N. Funamoto S. Yagishita S. Takami M. Osawa S.

This observation points to the possibility that a change in the composition of the lipid bilayer could have a significant impact on the enzymatic activity of γ-secretase. The level of secreted Aβ from cultured cells was reported to be attenuated by increasing levels of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate [PI(4,5)P2], one of the phosphoinositides (19Landman N.

The phosphoinositides play pivotal roles in numerous biological processes, such as ion channel regulation, membrane trafficking, cell polarity, and actin rearrangement (20Brown F.D. Rozelle A.L.

Murray D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 151-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar) estimated that the intracellular concentration of PI(4,5)P2, if uniformly distributed inside the cell, was in the range of 2–30 μm, based on the dissociation constants between PH domains and PI(4,5)P2. Bunce et al. (27Bunce C.M. French P.J. Allen P. Mountford J.C. Moor B. Greaves M.F. Michell R.H. Brown G. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) reported that the concentration of PI(4,5)P2 was in the range of 32–159 μm in several cell species. Even though the phosphoinositides are a minor component of cellular lipids, one can assume that their concentrations in the two-dimensional intact membrane would be higher than that reported for the total three-dimensional cell volume. If the volume of the membrane is estimated as ∼10–20% of the cell volume, the concentrations of PI(4,5)P2 in the membrane are at least five times higher than those in the total cell volume. The local concentration of PI(4,5)P2 at the inner leaflet of neutrophil membrane was reported to be ∼5 mm in the steady state (28Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Further, Sheetz et al. (29Sheetz M.P. Febbroriello P. Koppel D.E.

In addition, a number of reports showed that PI(4,5)P2 localizes in the detergent-insoluble microdomains (rafts) of the membrane (31Laux T. Fukami K. Thelen M. Golub T. Frey D. Caroni P. J.

It has been proposed that there is a spatially confined pool of PI(4,5)P2 in the membrane (34Simonsen A. Wurmser A.E. Emr S.D. Stenmark H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 35Martin T.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 36Hinchliffe K.A.

Thus it is reasonable to consider that the concentration of PI(4,5)P2 in the microdomains of the membrane is much higher than previously thought. γ-Secretase is also enriched in lipid raft microdomains (38Vetrivel K.S.

It is likely that the phosphoinositides and γ-secretase localize in the same membrane microdomains.Furthermore, phosphoinositides were widely known to be modulated by their concentrations in membrane by extracellular stimulus in physiological condition (41Stephens L.R. Hughes K.T. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1991; 351: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Studies of several PH domains fused with green fluorescent protein revealed that concentrations of PI(3,4)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 were elevated after stimulus in Dictyostelium cells and neutrophils in vivo (21Funamoto S.

In neutrophils, it has been reported that the local concentration of PI(3,4,5)P3 at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane is 5 μm and that after extracellular stimulation it increases to 200 μm (28Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). The concentration of PI(3,4)P2 is estimated to increase from 10–20 to 100–200 μm upon stimulation (28Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M.

Those observations suggest that concentration of phosphoinositides can be modulated in physiological conditions. Recently, increasing phosphoinositide (PI(4,5)P2) levels alter Aβ production by cultured cells (19Landman N. Jeong S.Y. Shin S.Y. Voronov S.V. Serban G. Kang M.S. Park M.K. Di Paolo G. Chung S.

Here we examined whether there are direct effects of phosphoinositides on γ-secretase in both CHAPSO-soluble and -insoluble states.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen).

After Aβ transfer, the nitrocellulose membrane was boiled for 5 min in the aluminum boiling apparatus (Can Do, Tokyo, Japan) for enhanced detection. Aβ on the membrane were visualized by an ECL system (GE Healthcare) using the well characterized monoclonal antibodies 82E1, BA27 (highly specific for the Aβ40 carboxyl terminus), and BC05 (raised against Aβ35–43, specific for the Aβ42 carboxyl terminus, but cross-reactive with CTFs and full-length APP), for assessing the total Aβ, Aβ40, and Aβ42, respectively (47Suzuki N.

Microsomal fractions of the cells were homogenized in five volumes of 10% sucrose in MES-buffered saline (25 mm MES, pH 6.5, and 150 mm NaCl) containing 1% CHAPSO. After adjusting the sucrose concentration to 40%, the homogenate was centrifuged on a discontinuous sucrose gradient (5, 35, and 40%) at 39,000 rpm for 20 h at 4 °C on an SW 41 Ti rotor (Beckman). The interface between 5 and 35% sucrose was collected and designated as CHAPSO-insoluble rafts. The CHAPSO-insoluble rafts were diluted with three volumes of dilution buffer (20 mm PIPES, pH 7.2, 140 mm KCl, 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm EGTA) and incubated for 45 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of PI(4,5)P2. For assessing Aβ production from exogenously added C99-FLAG, the CHAPSO insoluble rafts that were obtained from cells grown in the absence of tetracycline were incubated for 60 min with 100 nm C99-FLAG in the presence or absence of PI(4,5)P2.Treatment of PLC Inhibitor—7WD10, CHO cells expressing APP751 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 200 μg/ml G418 (49Koo E.H.

Resultant pellet was mixed with the same solvent to complete neutral lipids extraction. 750 μl of MeOH: CHCl3:12 N HCl (40:80:1) was added to the pellet and mixed for extraction of acidic lipids. Supernatant was transferred to a new 1.5-ml tube and mixed with 250 μl of CHCl3 and 450 μl of 0.1 n HCl. After centrifugation, the organic phase was transferred to a new tube and dried up. The dried lipid sample was reconstituted with 80 μl of CHCl3: MeOH:H2O (1:2:0.8) and spotted onto PI(4,5)P2 Mass Strip (Echelon). PI(4,5)P2 in extracted lipid sample was detected with PLC-δ1 PH domain glutathione S-transferase-tagged protein (Echelon). Miocrosomal fraction prepared from cells treated with edelfosin was incubated at 37 °C for 0.5 h in the presence of 15 μm edelfosin and subjected to Western blot to assess effect of edelfosin on Aβ production from isolated membrane (10Gu Y.

After thorough washing, the γ-secretase complex bound to protein A-Sepharose beads was incubated in 0.25% CHAPSO buffer (50 mm PIPES, pH 7.2, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 0.25% CHAPSO, 2 mm diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate, 20 μg/ml antipain, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml TLCK, 10 mm phenanthroline, 2 mm thiorphan, and 0.1% phosphatidylcholine) with C99-FLAG substrate at 37 °C for 4 h together with defined concentrations of PI(4,5)P2. To evaluate inhibitory effects of PI(4,5)P2 on the interaction between γ-secretase and C99-FLAG substrate, C99-FLAG prebound anti-FLAG M2 agarose beads (Sigma) were mixed with the CHAPSO-solubilized microsomal fraction of CHO cells and incubated at 4 °C overnight in the presence or absence of 0.845 mm PI(4,5)P2. The agarose beads were washed three times and subjected to Western blotting to visualize γ-secretase components, including nicastrin, carboxyl-terminal fragment (CTF) of presenilin 1, and Aph-1. Presenilin 1 CTF, Aph-1, and Pen-2 were detected with anti-presenilin 1 CTF antiserum (a gift from Dr. Iwatsubo, University of Tokyo), anti-Aph1 polyclonal antibody (Covance), and anti-Pen-2 polyclonal antibody (50Shimojo M.

It is smaller and numerically simpler than the antenna, and its specific role in behavior has long been unclear. Because of its proximity to the mouthparts, I explored the possibility of a role in taste behavior. Maxillary palp was tuned to mediate odor-induced taste enhancement: a sucrose solution was more appealing when simultaneously presented with the odorant 4-methylphenol. The same result was observed with other odors that stimulate other types of olfactory receptor neuron in the maxillary palp. When an antennal olfactory receptor was genetically introduced in the maxillary palp, the fly interpreted a new odor as a sweet-enhancing smell. These results all point to taste enhancement as a function of the maxillary palp. It also opens the door for studying integration of multiple senses in a model organism."
https://openalex.org/W2083631285,"ATF4 is a transcription factor that induces a genetic program for amino acid synthesis and amino acid uptake. Previous work demonstrated that ATF4 expression is increased either by insulin or by the general amino acid control (GAAC) response, an evolutionarily ancient pathway that is activated when eukaryotic cells are deprived of amino acids. It is not known whether insulin and the GAAC pathway increase ATF4 expression by the same or different mechanisms. In these studies, we demonstrate that insulin-mediated ATF4 expression occurs as part of a coordinated anabolic program that does not require an essential component of the GAAC pathway, the protein kinase GCN2. Moreover, insulin and the GAAC pathway have an additive effect on expression of ATF4 and downstream mRNAs for amino acid synthesis and uptake. These data suggest that the GAAC pathway may facilitate insulin-mediated anabolism when exogenous amino acids are limiting. We conclude that insulin signaling and the GAAC response comprise two distinct yet complimentary pathways to ATF4 expression, allowing anabolism to be finely tuned to amino acid availability.

In mammals, changes in nutrient availability induce changes in levels of metabolic hormones, which in turn orchestrate the metabolism of trillions of cells, allowing them to cooperate and function as a single organism (1Foster D.W.

Conversely, in unicellular organisms, metabolism is largely governed by nutrient-sensing pathways, which sense changes in nutrient availability and generate an adaptive, cell autonomous metabolic response (3Towle H.C.

Microbiol. 2005; 59: 407-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar); amino acid deprivation increases levels of uncharged tRNAs, which bind to and activate the kinase GCN2. GCN2 phosphorylates the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), thereby inhibiting global protein synthesis but increasing synthesis of a few specific proteins. One such protein that is increased under these conditions is a basic leucine zipper transcription factor that activates a large panel of genes encoding amino acid transporters and amino acid biosynthetic enzymes. In yeast, this transcription factor is referred to as GCN4 (4Hinnebusch A.G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 59: 407-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar); the mammalian counterpart is activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4, also known as CREB2 (5Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y.

J. 2007; 402: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar)). In addition to stimulating ATF4 mRNA translation, amino acid deprivation increases levels of GCN4 or ATF4 mRNA (4Hinnebusch A.G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 59: 407-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar, 6Siu F. Bain P.J. LeBlanc-Chaffin R. Chen H. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24120-24127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The end result of the GAAC pathway is activation of genes that correct amino acid deficiencies and restore homeostasis.ATF4 is also subject to opposing regulation by hormones that play a central role in regulating mammalian metabolism (12Adams C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16744-16753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Glucocorticoids (catabolic hormones that are required for mammalian survival during prolonged fasting or stress) decrease levels of ATF4 mRNA and protein, leading to the repression of ATF4-dependent mRNAs encoding amino acid transporters and amino acid biosynthetic enzymes. Glucocorticoid-mediated repression of ATF4 is coupled with inhibition of global mRNA translation and protein synthesis and the activation of genes for protein catabolism. Conversely, insulin (an anabolic hormone) overcomes all of these effects of glucocorticoids. Thus, insulin increases levels of ATF4 mRNA, ATF4 protein, ATF4-dependent mRNAs, and global protein synthesis, and insulin represses genes for protein catabolism. Taken together, these data suggest that ATF4 mediates a portion of the coordinated anabolic response to insulin and that ATF4 is repressed as part of the coordinated catabolic response to glucocorticoids. Indeed, the in vivo role of ATF4 in mammalian anabolism has been established through studies of ATF4-deficient mice, which exhibit pleiotropic growth defects (13Taneka T. Tsujimura T. Takeda K.

Starbuck M. Liu X. Ron D. Parada L.F. Karsenty G. Cell Metab. 2006; 4: 441-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar).These considerations led us to ask the following question. What is the relationship between evolutionarily ancient nutrient-sensing pathways and the hormonal signaling pathways of multicellular organisms? With regards to ATF4, one possibility is that glucocorticoids and insulin regulate the GAAC pathway to control ATF4 and genes needed for amino acid synthesis and uptake. For example, insulin-mediated protein synthesis might induce a state of amino acid depletion within cells, thereby activating GCN2 and increasing ATF4; or insulin could directly activate GCN2 through a previously unrecognized mechanism. Alternatively, the integrated mammalian responses to fasting and feeding may have evolved in such a way that glucocorticoids and insulin regulate ATF4 independently of the GAAC pathway. Our goal in these studies was to address this question.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and Buffers—Dexamethasone, insulin (from bovine pancreas), and l-histidinol were obtained from Sigma. [3H]Leucine was obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (ARC). The following buffers were used. Buffer A contains 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium EDTA, 1 mm sodium EGTA, and protease inhibitor mixture (25 μg/ml N-acetyl-leucinal-leucinal-norleucinal, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Buffer B contains 250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 25% glycerol, 0.2% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 5% (w/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. Buffer C contains 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium EDTA, 1 mm sodium EGTA, and protease inhibitor mixture.Cell Culture—All studies described here utilized mouse L cells (D9 strain (18Lobel P. Fujimoto K. Ye R.D. Griffiths G. Kornfeld S. Cell. 1989; 57: 787-796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar)). Tissue culture medium A is Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 g/liter of glucose (Mediatech catalog number 10-014) containing antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate) and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum; medium B is medium A lacking antibiotics; medium C is medium A lacking fetal bovine serum. Cells were maintained in monolayer in medium A at 37 °C and an atmosphere of 8–9% CO2. With the exception of experiments using RNA interference (as described below), cells were set up for experiments in medium A on day 0 at a density of 7 × 105 cells/100-mm dish (for use on day 2) or 3.5 × 105 cells/100-mm dish (for use on day 3). Prior to the incubation protocols described in the figure legends, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).RNA Interference—Mouse L cells were set up at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/60-mm dish on day 0. On day 1, cells were washed with PBS, refed with 3 ml of medium B, followed by the addition of a mixture containing 1 ml of OptiMEM (Invitrogen), 10 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) and 200 nm siRNA duplex (to give a final siRNA concentration of 50 nm). Control cells were transfected with siCONTROL nontargeting siRNA (Dharmacon). The siRNA duplex targeting GCN2 (also known as eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α kinase 4 (Eif2ak4); GenBank™ accession number NM_013719) contained the following nucleotide sequence (5′ to 3′): sense GGAAAUCACUAGCUUGACAUU; antisense UGUCAAGCUAGUGAUUUCCUU. Similar results were obtained using an individual siRNA duplex targeting a different region of the GCN2 mRNA (containing the following nucleotide sequence (5′ to 3′): sense GCGCUGCGUUCUUCAGUGAUU; antisense UCACUGAAGAACGCAGCGCUU) or using a mixture of four siRNA duplexes targeting GCN2 (Dharmacon catalog number D-044353-02) (not shown). On day 2 (24 h after transfection), cells were re-fed with serum-free medium C and then subjected to varying conditions of incubation as described in the legends for Figs. 2 and 5. Following incubation, the cells from three identically treated dishes were pooled and harvested for total cellular RNA followed by analysis using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR).FIGURE 5Insulin and histidinol utilize different pathways to increase ATF4 expression.

PCR was carried out using the 7500 Fast real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). All qPCR reactions were performed in triplicate, and the cycle threshold (Ct) values were averaged to give the final results. The relative amounts of all RNAs were calculated using the comparative Ct method (22Liang G. Yang J. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

Following incubation, cells were washed twice with PBS and then harvested, and an aliquot of cells was subjected to precipitation using 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid in the presence of 0.45% salmon sperm DNA. Trichloroacetic acid precipitates were then applied to glass fiber filters set upon a vacuum manifold. Filters were sequentially washed with 10% trichloroacetic acid, 5% trichloroacetic acid, and 95% ethanol and then placed in scintillation mixture for measurement of acid-insoluble radioactivity. The final results were obtained by averaging the counts obtained from the three dishes in each condition that were incubated at 37 °C and then subtracting the background count obtained from the dish incubated at 4 °C and normalizing the counts to the total mg of protein/dish under each condition.Preparation of Nuclear Extracts, SDS-PAGE, and Immunoblot Analysis—Because ATF4 has an extremely short half-life (30–60 min) secondary to proteasomal degradation (23Lassot I.

Following incubation, the cells from three identically treated 100-mm dishes of cells were washed once with cold PBS, scraped and pooled into 50-ml tubes on ice, and then centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in 1.2 ml of buffer A and then passed through a 22-gauge needle 22 times followed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min. The 1000 × g pellet was resuspended in 250 μl of buffer C, rotated at 4 °C for 1 h, and then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min to remove insoluble material. The protein concentration was then measured using the BCA kit (Pierce), after which a 25-μg aliquot was mixed with 0.25 volume of buffer B and heated for 5 min at 95 °C. Samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to Hybond-C extra nitrocellulose filters (Millipore). Immunoblots were performed at room temperature using a 1:1000 dilution of a rabbit polyclonal antiserum SC-200 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), which recognizes the COOH terminus of mouse ATF4.Measurement of Intracellular Free Amino Acids—Following incubation, cells were washed three times with cold PBS and scraped into 10% (v/v) methanol (150 μl/60-mm dish). Lysates from two identically treated dishes of cells were pooled, protein concentrations were determined using the BCA method, and free (nonhydrolyzed) amino acid concentrations were determined using cation exchange chromatography (Hitachi L-8800 amino acid analyzer), as described previously (12Adams C.M.

When mouse L cells are incubated in serum-free medium containing glucocorticoids, they enter a metabolically quiescent state where expression of ATF4 and ATF4 target genes is repressed. Glucocorticoid-mediated repression of ATF4 is coupled with repression of ATF4-independent anabolic genes for lipid synthesis and uptake and the induction of catabolic genes for protein and lipid breakdown (12Adams C.M.

Under these conditions, a physiologic concentration of insulin dominantly overrides the effects of glucocorticoids, thus repressing catabolic genes and inducing expression of ATF4 and both ATF4-dependent and ATF4-independent anabolic genes (12Adams C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16744-16753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).To test the hypothesis that activation of the GAAC pathway might overcome the repressive effect of glucocorticoids on ATF4, we used histidinol, an amino alcohol that competitively inhibits histidinyl-tRNA synthetase, thereby increasing levels of uncharged tRNAHis and activating GCN2 (7Zhang P.

Our incubation protocol is shown in Fig. 1A; mouse L cells were incubated in the absence or presence of dexamethasone for 48 h followed by an additional 6-h incubation in the absence or presence of either insulin or histidinol, which was directly added to the cell culture medium in the continued presence of dexamethasone.FIGURE 1Histidinol overcomes glucocorticoid-mediated repression of ATF4 and ATF4-dependent mRNAs.

In this and all other experiments, histidinol or insulin was added directly to the existing cell culture medium (in the continued presence of dexamethasone).

J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16744-16753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) nor histidinol (supplemental Fig. 1) increased levels of ATF4 or ATF4-dependent mRNAs. Dexamethasone reduced expression of ATF4 (Fig. 1B, lane 2), and under these conditions, histidinol, like insulin, increased ATF4 protein levels (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4). In contrast to insulin (Fig. 1C, left side), histidinol did not increase levels of mRNAs involved in lipid synthesis and uptake nor decrease levels of mRNAs involved in protein or lipid breakdown (Fig. 1C, right side). Rather, histidinol specifically increased the mRNA encoding ATF4, which was followed by an increase in ATF4-dependent mRNAs encoding amino acid biosynthetic enzymes and amino acid transporters (Fig. 2A). The effect of histidinol on ATF4 and ATF4-dependent mRNAs was maximal at a concentration of 2 mm (Fig. 2B) and was inhibited by siRNA-mediated silencing of GCN2 (Fig. 2C). These data indicate that the GAAC pathway remains intact and functional in the presence of glucocorticoids.Glucocorticoids Coordinately Reduce Intracellular Free Amino Acids and tRNA Synthesis—ATF4 is required to maintain levels of intracellular free amino acids (12Adams C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16744-16753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Consistent with its repressive effect on ATF4, dexamethasone also reduced levels of intracellular amino acids (Fig. 3A). This presented a paradox. If the GAAC pathway is intact in glucocorticoid-treated cells (Figs. FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2) and glucocorticoids decrease free intracellular amino acid levels (Fig. 3A), then how do glucocorticoids decrease ATF4? We hypothesized that glucocorticoids might also repress tRNA levels. To test this, we measured levels of several pre-tRNAs (unspliced tRNA precursors that are used as markers of RNA polymerase III activity (20Winter A.G. Sourvinos G. Allison S.J. Tosh K. Scott P.H.

Fig. 3B shows that dexamethasone decreased levels of three different pre-tRNAs, which correlated with a reduction in global protein synthesis (Fig. 3C). These data suggest that glucocorticoids uncouple ATF4 from the GAAC pathway by coordinately regulating amino acid and tRNA levels.FIGURE 3Effect of dexamethasone on intracellular free amino acids, pre-tRNAs and global protein synthesis. A–C, mouse L cells were incubated for 48 h in medium C in the absence or presence of dexamethasone (Dex; 10 nm).

The reaction mechanism has been intensively investigated in particular for bacterial and eukaryotic GAPDHs (1Segal H.L. Boyer P.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1975; 250: 9137-9162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and consists of two steps as follows: (i) an oxidoreduction reaction, corresponding to the nucleophilic attack of the catalytic cysteine (Cys-149) on the aldehydic group of G3P, followed by a hydride transfer assisted by His-176 (base catalyst) from the generated thiohemiacetal to the C4 of the nicotinamide of NAD+ that leads to the formation of a thioacylenzyme (7Talfournier F. Colloc'h N. Mornon J.P. Branlant G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 447-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and (ii) a phosphorylation of the resulting thioester through the nucleophilic attack of inorganic phosphate on the carbonyl group of the thioacylenzyme. The second step is preceded by the exchange of NADH with NAD+, with the latter favoring the phosphorolysis step. Two anion recognition sites accommodate the inorganic phosphate ion and the phosphate groups of G3P and 1,3-DPG. Their positions within the active site have been deduced from the location of two sulfate ions derived from the ammonium sulfate crystallization medium (9Moras D. Olsen K.W. Sabesan M.N. Buehner M. Ford G.C. Rossmann M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 9137-9162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the basis of a model of the thiohemiacetal intermediate in the Homarus americanus GAPDH structure, the anion binding sites were initially attributed to the specific binding of the C3-phosphate (C3P) group of d-G3P (Ps site) and of the inorganic phosphate ion (Pi site). The location of the Ps site in the three-dimensional structures of eukaryotic and bacterial GAPDHs is conserved and independent of the enzyme state, apo-, or holo-form, and of the presence of ligands such as sulfate ions, phosphate ions, substrate, or substrate analogs. This Ps site is composed of the side chains of residues Arg-231 and Thr-179 and the 2′-hydroxyl group of the nicotinamide ribose of NAD+. On the contrary, the location of the Pi site appears to vary depending on the presence and nature of the bound ligands or source organism. This location is related to the conformation adopted by the segment composed of residues 206-212. Although the most common conformation is that originally found in the holoenzyme from H. americanus and Bacillus stearothermophilus (9Moras D. Olsen K.W. Sabesan M.N. Buehner M. Ford G.C.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14975-14986Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) that generates a Pi site located closer to the catalytic Cys-149 residue and 3 Å away from the former position, which has been called new Pi site. Whatever the considered position, the Pi site includes the side chains of residues Ser-148 and Thr-208 and the main-chain nitrogen of Gly-209. In addition, the new Pi site also involves residue Thr-150. Despite numerous functional (6Michels S. Rogalska E. Branlant G. Eur. J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 12968-12976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the individual role of Pi and Ps sites in the catalytic events remains unclear. Although it is generally assumed from geometrical considerations that inorganic phosphate must attack the intermediate from the Pi site, a possible flipping of the C3P of G3P between the two sites during catalysis was suggested by Skarzynski et al. (10Skarzyński T. Moody P.C. Wonacott A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 171-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Recently, using mutants of the active site cysteine, Didierjean et al. (16Didierjean C. Corbier C. Fatih M. Favier F. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. Aubry A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12968-12976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) obtained the structures of ternary complexes from B. stearothermophilus GAPDH with NAD+ and the physiological substrate d-G3P, the phosphate group of which was found to be bound at the Ps site. This result strongly suggests that the Ps site constitutes the binding site for the C3P group of the substrate but does not, however, exclude the possibility that the substrate could display different interactions especially with regard to its C3P group, once the covalent bond is formed between Cys-149 and d-G3P. Indeed this structure is representative of a Michaelis, non-covalent, complex and does not allow to prefigure the location of the C3P group in the intermediate stages of the reaction. Much of the uncertainty regarding the individual contribution of the two anion binding sites during the catalytic events derives from the absence of the structure of the physiological thioacylenzyme intermediate. To obtain this structure, holo-GAPDH crystals from B. stearothermophilus were soaked with the substrate G3P in the absence of inorganic phosphate. Formation of NADH in the crystal was monitored by single crystal absorption microspectrophotometry (17Pearson A.R. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 656-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), a method pioneered by Rossi and Bernhard (18Rossi G.L. Bernhard S.A. J. Mol.

Struct. 1996; 25: 343-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and for the design of kinetic crystallography experiments (20Bourgeois D. Royant A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 538-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). A series of microspectrophotometric studies on GAPDH crystals were previously carried out using a chromophoric substrate analog of 1,3-DPG (21Berni R. Mozzarelli A. Pellacani L. Rossi G.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 110: 405-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 22Vas M. Berni R. Mozzarelli A. Tegoni M. Rossi G.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1982; 257: 6739-6744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The experimental conditions suitable for the accumulation of the catalytically-relevant thioacylenzyme intermediate in the crystals of B. stearothermophilus GAPDH were thus designed and allowed us to solve its structure. This constitutes the first structure of a reaction intermediate of GAPDH in the presence of its cofactor NAD+. Analysis of the acylated structure reveals two major outcomes when compared with that of the non-covalent complex: a shift of the 206-210 loop, which delineates a new position for the Pi site comparable to that originally described for the holo-structure of Thermotoga maritima, and the location of the C3P group of the thioacyl intermediate, which is bound in this new Pi site. Chemicals—dl-Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (dl-G3P, Sigma) was prepared from the dl-G3P diethylacetal according to the manufacturer, and its concentration was assessed using GAPDH. Iodoacetic acid, ammonium sulfate, EDTA, NAD+, Tris, and dithiothreitol were from Sigma and were of the best available quality and used without further purification. Production, Purification, and Crystallization of Wild-type B. stearothermophilus GAPDH—The Escherichia coli strain used for wild-type GAPDH production was HB101 transformed with a pBluescript II SK containing the gap gene under the lac promoter. Purification was performed as previously described by Talfournier et al. (7Talfournier F. Colloc'h N. Mornon J.P. Branlant G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 447-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Purity of the enzyme was checked by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-PAGE and by mass spectrometry. Prior to crystallization, the enzyme was dialyzed overnight against 100 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol, and concentrated using a 30-kDa molecular mass cut-off centrifugation system (Centricon). Protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using a molecular mass of 143,776 Da and an extinction coefficient of 1.31 × 105 m-1 cm-1. Crystals of the holo-form of wild-type B. stearothermophilus GAPDH were obtained at 293 K using the hanging-drop, vapor diffusion method in the presence of ammonium sulfate as precipitating agent. The reservoir solution contained 2.7 m ammonium sulfate, 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.9. Drops were prepared by mixing in different ratios a solution containing 15 mg.ml-1 enzyme and 2 mm NAD+ and the reservoir solution. Crystals appear within 1 week from drops with mixed volumes of protein and reservoir solutions in ratios of 1/2, 1/1, or 2/1. Single Crystal-polarized Absorption Microspectrophotometric Measurements—Single crystals of GAPDH were resuspended at least six times in a stabilizing solution containing 2.7 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffered at pH 8.2. Crystals were loaded in a quartz flow cell mounted on the stage of a Zeiss MPM03 microspectrophotometer, equipped with a 10× ultrafluar objective and a thermostatic apparatus (24Mozzarelli A. Peracchi A. Rossi G.L. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15774-15780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polarized absorption spectra were recorded between 300 and 500 nm, with the electric vector of the linearly polarized light parallel to crystal edges. To follow the reaction of GAPDH crystals with d-G3P, crystals were suspended in the stabilizing solution containing dl-G3P at concentrations up to 60 mm. Polarized absorption spectra were recorded as a function of time to monitor reaction equilibration. To obtain the reference spectrum for the fully reduced NADH-enzyme complex, single crystals were treated with 1 mm sodium arsenate in the presence of G3P. The arsenate anion irreversibly reacts with the thioacylenzyme, shifting the equilibrium toward the full reduction of NAD+. At each G3P concentration, the fraction of reduced NADH was calculated by fitting the corresponding absorption spectrum to a linear combination of the spectra of the native form and the arsenate-treated form. As a control experiment, enzyme crystals were suspended in a solution containing 10 mm iodoacetic acid, 2.7 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.2. This experiment was aimed to demonstrate the disappearance of the Racker band, diagnostic of an active enzyme, due to the alkylation of the reactive Cys-149. All experiments were carried out at 15 °C. X-ray Diffraction Experiments—Crystals of the holoenzyme were soaked for 1.5-10 min in a crystallization medium containing 60 mm dl-G3P. Reaction was stopped by flash freezing crystals after a quick soak in a cryoprotective solution containing 20% (v/v) glycerol in addition to the crystallization medium. Several datasets were collected at 100 K using a synchrotron beam either at European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) or Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (Hamburg, Germany). 360 frames each of 0.5° oscillation step were systematically collected to assure collection of complete and redundant datasets, which were processed using the XDS package (25Kabsch W.

The structure reported here (see below) derived from a crystal, soaked for 3 min, which diffraction data were collected at the X13 beamline (Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron) using a MARCCD detector (165 mm) and a wavelength of 0.806 Å.

Cycles of refinement (Refmac5) alternated with manual rebuilding (Coot) were carried out to improve the model (29Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Water molecules were added using the built-in find-water function of Coot and individually checked for significant signal and consistent contact with H-bond donor/acceptor. The thioacylenzyme model obtained from soaked ammonium sulfate-grown crystal was refined up to final convergence, using all the reflections (sigma cut-off = 0) with R and Rfree of 18.2% and 23.9%, respectively. The final cycles of refinement were performed using the BUSTER-TNT program (31Bricogne G. Irwin J.J. Dodson E. Moore M. Ralph A. Bailey S. Macromolecular Refinement.

This gave a final R and Rfree of 16.1% and 19.8%, respectively. Structure Analysis and Final Structure Parameters—The geometry of the model was checked with PROCHECK (32Laskowski R.A. Macarthur M.W.

This spectral feature, known as the Racker band, is associated with a charge transfer between the catalytic cysteine residue and the NAD+ nicotinamide ring (35Racker E. Krimsky I. J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 198: 731-743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Carboxymethylation of GAPDH crystals at the Sγ of Cys-149 with iodoacetic acid resulted in the disappearance of the band (Fig. 1), as in solution, indicating that GAPDH in the crystal is in a catalytically active conformation. A similar observation was obtained on GAPDH crystals from Palinurus vulgaris (21Berni R. Mozzarelli A. Pellacani L. Rossi G.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 110: 405-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Upon addition of the physiological substrate G3P to holoenzyme-NAD+ crystals, an intense band centered at around 340 nm, associated with the formation of NADH, appeared with the concomitant disappearance of the Racker band (Fig. 1). This result indicates that the redox reaction has occurred in the crystalline state, with the hydride transfer from C1 of G3P to C4 of nicotinamide ring and concomitant formation of the thioacylenzyme-NADH complex, as observed in solution (2Trentham D.R. Biochem. J. 1971; 122: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 3Trentham D.R. Biochem. J. 1971; 122: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 36Harrigan P.J. Trentham D.R. Biochem. J. 1974; 143: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The reduction of all four NAD+ molecules of the tetramer could be achieved by adding sodium arsenate to the soaking solution containing G3P (Fig. 1). The arsenate anion irreversibly reacts with the acylenzyme, thus shifting the equilibrium toward the reduction of NAD+. The fraction of acylated sites and NADH molecules depends on the concentration of G3P in the soaking solution (Fig. 1, inset). A titration of GAPDH crystals with increasing concentrations of G3P revealed a relatively low apparent affinity for GAPDH with respect to solution (Fig. 1, inset), likely due to the inhibitory effect of the high sulfate concentration in the suspending medium, competing for the anion binding sites. Indeed, a similar behavior was observed for P. vulgaris GAPDH crystals, grown in ammonium sulfate (data not shown), whereas on the contrary, crystals of B. stearothermophilus, grown from polyethylene glycol solutions, reacted with G3P with complete reduction of NAD+ at ∼1 mm G3P (data not shown). However, the reaction of G3P with these polyethylene glycol-grown GAPDH crystals was systematically accompanied by a significant decrease of the diffraction power, preventing their use for structural determination. Overall Structure and Model Quality—The final model is composed of one tetramer in the asymmetric unit, each monomer containing residues 0-333 and one molecule of cofactor. The asymmetric unit also contains 4 bound G3P molecules, 18 sulfate ions (including two in each active site), 8 molecules of glycerol, and 1 molecule of ethylene glycol derived from the cryoprotective treatment (see “Experimental Procedures”) and 1743 water molecules. Except for some solvent-exposed side chains, residues of the model are well defined in the electron density maps. Only a few residual peaks, mostly in the solvent-exposed region, were not interpreted in the difference maps. The model has tight stereochemical restraints with r.m.s.d. on bond lengths and on bond angles of 0.011 Å and 1.27°, respectively (Table 1). The four monomers are named O, P, Q and R, following the nomenclature initially described for H. americanus GAPDH (37Buehner M. Ford G.C. Moras D. Olsen K.W. Rossmann M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 82: 563-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Using the O subunit as a reference, the root-mean-square deviations (r.m.s.d.) of backbone atoms after superimposition of the P, Q, and R subunits are 0.15, 0.14, and 0.12 Å, respectively, showing that the conformations of all four subunits in the final refined tetramer are very similar. Superimposition of the backbone atoms of our model onto the holo-structure described by Skarzynski et al. (10Skarzyński T. Moody P.C. Wonacott A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 171-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) (same space group and unit cell dimensions; pdb code 1gd1) gives an r.m.s.d. of 0.45 Å for the whole tetramer and a mean value of 0.27 Å for the different pairwise superimpositions of the monomers. No major difference was observed between the two structures except locally for the 206-212 loop, which exhibits deviations three times higher than the r.m.s.d. This conformational difference will be further described below. As expected from the stoichiometry of the reaction of GAPDH crystals with 60 mm dl-G3P (fraction of NADH per monomer of ∼0.70), determined by polarized absorption microspectrophotometry (Fig. 1, inset), the active site of each subunit was found to be present in two distinct, differently populated chemical states, which have been assumed to correspond to the native holo-structure with a free cysteine and a sulfate anion bound to the Pi site (mean refined fractional occupancy of ∼0.4, conformation A) and to the thioacylenzyme-NADH intermediate (mean refined fractional occupancy of ∼0.6, conformation B) (Table 2). The refined occupancies and B values of the ligands are similar in the four monomers and support an equival"

Low penetrant genes may play minor but contributive roles in the predisposition of these specific cancers (3Stacey S.N. Sulem P. Johannsson O.T. Helgason A. Gudmundsson J. Kostic J.P. Kristjansson K. Jonsdottir T. Sigurdsson H. Hrafnkelsson J. Johannsson J. Sveinsson T. Myrdal G. Grimsson H.N. Bergthorsson J.T. Amundadottir L.T. Gulcher J.R. Thorsteinsdottir U. Kong A. Stefansson K. PLoS Med. 2006; 3: e217Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In this regard, BARD1 is an interesting candidate for two major reasons. First, missense mutations in the BARD1 gene are associated with an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancers. Second, BARD1 is the constitutive nuclear partner of BRCA1.In the nucleus, BARD1 and BRCA1 form an obligate heterodimer that is important for mediating DNA damage recognition, signaling, and repair (4Irminger-Finger I. Jefford C.E. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 382-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Both proteins are tumor suppressors required for cell viability and genome integrity (5Deng C.X. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 1416-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). In mice, deletion of either protein leads to early stage embryonic lethality and high levels of genomic instability as indicated by the accumulation of chromosomal abnormalities. Together, the BARD1-BRCA1 complex favors survival and repair of the damaged cell. This is evidenced by co-localization of BARD1 and BRCA1 to nuclear sites of IR radiation-induced foci believed to be the location of stalled replication machinery and damaged DNA. BARD1 and BRCA1 associate with several complexes important for nuclear transcription, DNA repair, and cell cycle checkpoint regulation, although no detailed role in these processes has been described.The N-terminal RING domain and the two C-terminal BRCT domains of BARD1 share homology with BRCA1. The only direct interaction between the BARD1 and BRCA1 proteins is through helices flanking the RING motif of each protein. Unlike BRCA1, BARD1 has three predicted ankyrin (ANK) repeats adjacent to the first BRCT domain. ANK repeats fold into a helix-turn-helix-extended-loop topology, and together, they stack to form an ankyrin repeat domain (ARD). ARDs contain from 3 to 25 repeats, and their elongated and variable surfaces allow them to interact with a wide range of proteins (6Mosavi L.K. Cammett T.J. Desrosiers D.C. Peng Z.Y. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 1435-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 7Li J. Mahajan A. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15168-15178Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar).The ARD and BRCT domains appear to be functionally linked in BARD1 as both domains are required for BARD1-p53-dependent apoptosis (8Jefford C.E. Feki A. Harb J. Krause K.H. Irminger-Finger I. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3509-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the sequence connecting the ARD and BRCT domains is important for BARD1 interactions with p53 and CstF-50 and contains two BARD1 breast and ovarian cancer-predisposing mutations, C557S and Q564H. C557S increases the risk of breast cancer in patients also harboring a BRCA2 mutation (3Stacey S.N. Sulem P. Johannsson O.T. Helgason A. Gudmundsson J. Kostic J.P. Kristjansson K. Jonsdottir T.

The crystal structure is consistent with solution properties as determined by NMR studies. In addition, two reported missense mutations, N470S and V507M, within the ARD have been structurally characterized. Finally, we provide evidence for the independent behavior of the ARD and BRCT domains in solution. The structure of BARD1-ARD provides a basis for prediction of ARD function and the mechanism of interactions of the protein. It also provides key structural insights into functionally relevant isoforms of BARD1 and cancer-associated missense mutations.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids/Primers/Construct Definition—Constructs encoding BARD1 residues 397-777 and 566-777 were cloned into the pET151/D-TOPO vector using the Invitrogen directional cloning strategy. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate the BARD1 425-555 and other constructs, as well as the V507M and N470S mutants. Details can be found in the supplemental material.Protein Expression and Purification—pET151/D-TOPO BARD1 plasmids were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-DE3. BARD1 425-555 and 425-565 were grown in LB medium. Expression was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. The cultures grew for 24 h at 22 °C. BARD1 397-777, 425-777, and 566-777 were expressed both as described above as well as in ZYP-5052 autoinduction medium with similar expression times and temperatures.15N-labeled and 13C/15N-labeled samples of BARD1 425-565 were generated in minimal MOPS medium under the same conditions as the unlabeled protein. Due to their insolubility, but high expression levels, [15N]BARD1 566-777 and [15N]BARD1 425-777 were generated in either minimal MOPS medium or N-5052 autoinducing medium.All BARD1 constructs were purified by taking advantage of the N-terminal His6-TEV tag. Further details concerning the purification and trypsin digestion of the proteins can be found in the supplemental material.Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals of BARD1-ARD were originally produced by sitting drop vapor diffusion with sparse matrix crystallization buffers at 4 °C using 10 mg/ml BARD1 425-565 in buffers containing 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm DTT. After 3 months, small, thin hexagonal crystals were produced in Index screen condition 85 (Hampton Research, 0.2 mg of chloride, 0.1 m Tris hydrochloride, pH 8.5, 25% w/v polyethylene glycol 3350). Analysis of the protein by SDS-PAGE suggested that BARD1 425-565 had been proteolytically cleaved to 425-555 during the crystallization. Several crystals from the first screen were diluted into 50 μl of mother liquor and manually crushed with a glass rod. The mixture was diluted 10-fold with additional mother liquor and used for seeding during optimization screens. 1 μl of BARD1 425-555 protein at 20 mg/ml in the same buffer above was combined with 1 μl of crystal seeds and 2 μl of mother liquor for sitting drop vapor diffusion crystallization experiments at 4 °C. A large crystal was directly frozen in liquid N2, and diffraction data were collected at 100 K on a Rigaku R-axis IV++ system to 1.68 Å resolution. The crystals were monoclinic (space group P2 or P21) with unit cell dimensions of a = 37.8 Å, b = 74.1 Å, c = 51.2 Å, and β = 105.1°. The data were scaled and integrated with HKL2000 (13Otwinowski W. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38361) Google Scholar). Data reduction statistics have been summarized in supplemental Table 1.Structure Determination and Refinement—The structure of BARD1-ARD 425-555 was determined by molecular replacement with four ANK repeats from a designed ARD (Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID 1SVX (14Binz H.K.

The final refined 2.0 Å model contains 1945 atoms and 229 water molecules with final values of R and Rfree of 19.8 and 26.8%, respectively. Three residues at the N terminus and 10 BARD1 residues at the C terminus (547-555) are absent from the model due to poor electron density in these regions. Molprobity was used to check the stereochemistry (21Davis I.W. Leaver-Fay A. Chen V.B. Block J.N. Kapral G.J. Wang X. Murray L.W. Arendall W.B. II I Snoeyink J. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C.

Refinement statistics are reported in supplemental Table 1, and the electron density map is shown in supplemental Fig. 1.NMR Sample Preparation—BARD1 425-565 (ARD+Linker, wild type as well as N470S and V507M), 425-777 (ARD-BRCT), and 566-777 (BRCT)-labeled samples were prepared as discussed above. Details can be found in the supplemental material.RESULTSDomain Boundary Determination—The C-terminal half of BARD1 (residues 423-777) encompasses a highly conserved region predicted to fold into three ANK repeats followed by tandem BRCT domains. A linker of approximately 40 residues with no homology to known domains is found between the ANK repeats and the BRCT domains and might include an additional ANK repeat. “Capping” repeats are topologically similar to internal ANK repeats but have polar amino acid substitutions at positions that typically favor internal non-polar contacts. Therefore, they often remain unidentified by domain prediction servers.The domain boundaries were determined experimentally by limited trypsin proteolysis on a protein construct comprised of BARD1 residues 397-777. Analysis by SDS-PAGE and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight showed relatively stable fragments including ARD residues 425-565 and BRCT domains 566-777. Rapid proteolysis of residues 397-424 reduced the likelihood of an additional N-terminal ANK repeat. The beginning of a highly conserved region coincides with this N-terminal boundary. On the other hand, the proteolytic stability of the region C-terminal to the last predicted ANK repeat (residues 522-565) suggested the presence of a C-terminal capping ANK repeat. The final constructs used in the studies reported here are shown in Fig. 1.Overall Structure of the Four Ankyrin Repeats of BARD1—The tertiary structure of BARD1-ARD is composed of four ANK repeats that pack together to form an elongated structure measuring 35 × 24 × 18 Å (Fig. 2A). As in all ARDs, a hydrophobic core runs the entire length of the long axis (Fig. 2B). The hydrophobic core ends with the N- and C-terminal capping ANK repeats that contain polar amino acids at positions typically conserved for small non-polar residues in the core. In the N-terminal ANK repeat, Ser-443 and Tyr-446 substitute for the canonical valine and leucine positions, respectively, and in the C-terminal ANK repeat, Glu-537 and Lys-540 replace leucine and valine (Fig. 2, B and D).FIGURE 2Crystal structure of BARD1-ARD. A, stereo view of BARD1-ARD 425-546 with Cα backbone trace colored from blue (N terminus) to red (C terminus). The first three ANK repeats are composed of an inner α-helix 1 → sharp turn → outer α-helix 2 → 90° turn → extended loop topology. The first ANK repeat has an additional extended loop preceding the first α-helix, whereas the fourth ANK repeat loses regular secondary structure following the second turn of α-helix 2. B, hydrophobic core of BARD1-ARD with the ribbon structure colored gray. Residues belonging to the conserved hydrophobic core are represented as space-filling side chains and colored by atom type (hydrogen (white), carbon (green) oxygen (red), nitrogen (blue), and sulfur (yellow)). The hydrophobic core is strictly composed of aliphatic, non-polar side chains, whereas residues at the solvent interface have more polar, hydrophilic side chains. C, comparison of third ANK repeat (left) with the non-canonical fourth ANK repeat (right). The inner and outer α-helices of the fourth repeat are one helical turn shorter than the canonical ANK repeat. However, the overall orientation of α-helix 1 and α-helix 2 remains the same.

The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. Version Vo.99. DeLano Scientific LLC, Palo Alto, CA2002Google Scholar) with aCα root mean square deviation of 0.7 for 106 atoms. Right, BARD1-ARD ANK-4 (green) and GABPβ-ARD ANK-5 (blue) are shown in ribbon for comparison and to highlight the shortened α-helix 1 resulting from three fewer residues in the BARD1 repeat.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Typical of known ARD structures, extended loops primarily occur between ANK repeats and are stabilized by polar contacts within and between loops. BARD1-ARD also has a well ordered loop preceding the first ANK repeat in addition to the three internal loops. A similarly structured loop was observed preceding the first structured ankyrin repeat in the human Notch-ARD (22Ehebauer M.T. Chirgadze D.Y. Hayward P. Arias A.Martinez Blundell T.L. Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, unlike the BARD1-ARD, Notch has a poorly structured ankyrin repeat preceding the first structured loop.The C-terminal capping repeat differs significantly from the canonical ANK repeat. Its two helices are shorter (by one turn) than the canonical helices, yet it maintains the overall tertiary ANK repeat fold (Fig. 2, C and D). Moreover, the highly conserved histidine in the TPLH motif, conserved in non-terminal ANK repeats, is replaced by an aspartate, thus removing the histidine side chain that usually contributes to stabilization of the “i+1” extended loop.A similar half-ANK repeat was previously observed in GABPβ-ARD (23Batchelor A.H. Piper D.E. de la Brousse F.C. McKnight S.L. Wolberger C. Science. 1998; 279: 1037-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Structural alignment of BARD1-ARD with ANK repeats 2-5 of GABPβ-ARD demonstrates high tertiary homology, 0.7 Å Cα root mean square deviation despite low overall sequence conservation (Fig. 2E, left). The C-terminal half-ANK repeats have slight topological differences as three fewer residues connect the two helices in the BARD1 repeat relative to GABPβ, resulting in the α1 helix of the final repeat of BARD1 being one turn shorter (Fig. 2E, right).NMR Analysis of BARD1-ARD in Solution—Backbone resonance assignments for the BARD1-ARD+Linker construct, including residues C-terminal to the fourth repeat and terminating one residue before the first BRCT domain, were determined from standard triple resonance experiments. Nearly complete backbone and side-chain assignments were obtained. The secondary structure predicted from NMR chemical shifts closely matches those found in the crystal structure (supplemental Fig. 2). The NMR data for residues 547-565, C-terminal to the final helix in the crystal structure, do not indicate the existence of regular secondary structure.To determine how ordered each residue is in solution, we calculated the NMR-derived order parameter, S2. An average rotational correlation time of 13.3 ns was determined, consistent with a species with a molecular mass of 20 kDa, approximately the monomeric size for the construct. Residue-specific order parameter values determined for residues 428-545, including many residues within the extended loops, indicate motions consistent with a rigid body (supplemental Fig. 2B). Accurate values for the T1 and T2 relaxation times for residues 547-565 could not be determined due to their significantly longer relaxation times relative to the majority of the BARD1-ARD resonances. Heteronuclear nuclear Overhauser effects are negative for these residues and reflect motions consistent with a flexible disordered chain (supplemental Fig. 2C). This observation is also consistent with the absence of electron density for residues 547-555 in the crystal structure. Thus, the NMR data indicate that the extended loops observed in the crystal structure are well ordered in solution and behave as part of the globular domain, and those residues 547-565 of BARD1-ARD are disordered in solution.Analysis of BARD1-ARD Evolutionarily Conserved Residues—Analysis of all known ANK repeats shows that positions 2, 4-7, 9, 13, 21-22, and 25-26 within a canonical repeat are well conserved, and positions 8, 15-18, 20, 28, and 30-31 are semicon-served. The conserved regions include residues within the hydrophobic core, the TPLH motif that initiates the first helical turn of a repeat, and the two glycines present in sharp turns. We assume that these residues are required for the structural integrity of the general ANK motif. The remaining positions in each repeat were evaluated for their conservation in an alignment of BARD1 homologs. As shown in supplemental Fig. 3, BARD1-ARD is highly conserved through evolution. Conserved residues specific to BARD1 are indicated by asterisks.To identify potentially important surface features that could be involved in protein-protein interactions, a surface representation of the BARD1-ARD structure was painted with the BARD1-specific conserved residues (Fig. 3A) and an electrostatic surface potential map (Fig. 3B). A majority of the residues form a contiguous region on the surface. A wide acidic patch is present along the N-terminal half of the ARD, spanning ANK repeats 1-3 and involving residues in the respective loops and inner helices. The acidic patch coincides with several BARD1-specific conserved residues (Arg-427, Glu-429, Asp-458, Ala-460, Trp-462, and Tyr-492). Conserved residue Glu-467 forms the base of the patch and has been included in the BARD1-specific analysis as the amino acid type is significantly divergent from the consensus sequence, despite its conserved position in the general ANK repeat.FIGURE 3Sequence conservation and electrostatic surface potential analysis of BARD1-ARD. A, surface representation of the BARD1-ARD with BARD1-specific conserved residues (asterisked residues from supplemental Fig. 3) shown in yellow. B, electrostatic surface potential, generated by PyMOL, shows a large acidic patch, an acidic pocket, and a hydrophobic patch along the same surface previously shown to be specifically conserved. Negatively charged surfaces are shown in red, and positively charged surfaces are shown in blue.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A second feature is an acidic pocket that lies adjacent to the acidic patch. The pocket is made up of residues from ANK repeats 2-3. Conserved BARD1-specific residues that form the pocket include Trp-462, Gly-491, Tyr-492, Asp-495, and Lys-503. Conserved residues His-466 and Asp-500 also help form the pocket but again lie in positions generally conserved in all ANK repeats. Asp-500 has been included in the BARD1-specific conservation analysis as it too is significantly divergent from the consensus sequence. The pocket is separated from the acidic patch by a hydrophobic ridge formed by the side chains of three strictly conserved BARD1 residues, Ala-460, Trp-462, and Tyr-492. Finally, a small hydrophobic patch is formed by the extended loop prior to the fourth repeat and involves conserved residues Ile-525 and Phe-526.Characterization of BARD1-ARD N470S and V507M—Two mutations, N470S and V507M, have been reported within the structured BARD1-ARD, although their linkage to cancer predisposition remains unclear (24Vahteristo P. Syrjakoski K. Heikkinen T. Eerola H. Aittomaki K. Von Smitten K. Holli K. Blomqvist C. Kallioniemi O.P. Nevanlinna H. Eur. J. Hum.

Cancer Lett. 2003; 200: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Asn-470 is neither a general ANK motif, nor is it conserved among BARD1 homologues. It is buried within the acidic surface in the inner helix of the second ANK repeat with no solvent accessibility for the main chain atoms and only 28% solvent accessibility for its side chain. On the other hand, Val-507 is conserved in BARD1 and is a general ANK motif residue that is partially buried on the periphery of the conserved hydrophobic core, with one methyl group pointing to the interior hydrophobic core (4% solvent accessibility) and the other methyl group pointing into the solvent (32% solvent accessibility).We introduced each missense mutation into the recombinant construct 425-565 and compared their solution properties with the wild-type protein. Analysis of secondary structure content and thermal stability of BARD1-ARD N470S and V507M by circular dichroism revealed no significant differences (data not shown). Furthermore, limited proteolysis with trypsin under conditions similar to those used to define the protein domain boundaries did not indicate additional proteolytic susceptibility in the mutant proteins (data not shown).NMR spectroscopy was used to detect detailed changes in the BARD1-ARD. Two-dimensional-HSQC spectra of 15N-labeled wild type, N470S, and V507M were collected, and chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) from the native protein were calculated. A number of CSPs occurred in both sets of spectra and were localized around the site of mutation (supplemental Fig. 4, A-C). Likely due to its low solvent accessibility, the N470S CSPs include some perturbations within the hydrophobic core (Cys-469, Val-476, and Val-477) as well as several adjacent surface-exposed residues (Gly-461, Trp-462, His-671, Gly-672, His-673, and His-506). V507M also introduced several CSPs (supplemental Fig. 4, D-F). Met-539 has the largest CSP as its side chain is facing the buried methyl of Val-507. Perturbations were also observed in residues within the hydrophobic core (Ile-509, Val-510, and Met-539) in addition to residues peripheral to Val-507 and the hydrophobic core (Gly-505, His-506, His-506, Lys-511, Thr-534, Ser-538, Lys-540, and Leu-545).The ARD and BRCT Domains in the Intact C-terminal Region Behave Independently in Solution—The fourth ANK repeat in BARD1 alters the previously assumed domain boundaries between the ARD and BRCTs. In particular, the length of the linker sequence between the two structured domains is only 20 residues (547-567) rather than the ∼40 residues assumed based on the three-ANK model. The short length of the linker and the presence of two cancer-predisposing mutations within it suggest that the ARD and BRCT domains may either adopt a preferred conformation relative to one another or cooperate in the binding of partner proteins. If the domains make direct contact with each other, residues in the binding interface will be perturbed relative to the individual domains in solution. If the ARD and BRCT domains behave as independent structural units, the local environment for the individual domains will be (nearly) identical to that of the intact C-terminal region. To address the relationship between the two structured domains, we compared the HSQC spectra of three constructs of BARD1: ARD+Linker (residues 425-565), BRCT tandem domains (residues 566-777),"

We examined whether polymorphisms of interleukin (IL)-12 receptor B1 (IL-12RB1) affect the susceptibility to and outcome of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).A case-control study was carried out in Chinese SARS patients and healthy controls. The genotypes of 4SNPs on IL-12 RB1 gene, +705A/G,+1158T/C, +1196G/C and +1664 C/T, were determined by PCR-RFLP. Haplotypes were estimated from the genotype data using the expectation-maximisation algorithm.Comparison between patients and close contacts showed that individuals with the +1664 C/T (CT and TT) genotype had a 2.09-fold (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.90-7.16) and 2.34-fold (95% CI, 1.79-13.37) increased risk of developing SARS, respectively. For any of the other three polymorphisms, however, no significant difference can be detected in allele or genotype frequencies between patients and controls. Additionally, estimation of the frequencies of multiple-locus haplotypes revealed potential risk haplotypes (GCCT) for SARS infection.Our data indicate that genetic variants of IL12RB1confer genetic susceptibility to SARS infection, but not necessary associated with the progression of the disease in Chinese population."

Platforms for rapid detection and characterization of microbial agents are critically needed to prevent and respond to disease outbreaks. Available detection technologies cannot provide broad functional information about known or novel organisms. As a step toward developing such a system, we have produced and tested a series of high-density functional gene arrays to detect elements of virulence and antibiotic resistance mechanisms. Our first generation array targets genes from Escherichia coli strains K12 and CFT073, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus. We determined optimal probe design parameters for gene family detection and discrimination. When tested with organisms at varying phylogenetic distances from the four target strains, the array detected orthologs for the majority of targeted gene families present in bacteria belonging to the same taxonomic family. In combination with whole-genome amplification, the array detects femtogram concentrations of purified DNA, either spiked in to an aerosol sample background, or in combinations from one or more of the four target organisms. This is the first report of a high density NimbleGen microarray system targeting microbial antibiotic resistance and virulence mechanisms. By targeting virulence gene families as well as genes unique to specific biothreat agents, these arrays will provide important data about the pathogenic potential and drug resistance profiles of unknown organisms in environmental samples."
https://openalex.org/W2038055427,"Cells with functional DNA mismatch repair (MMR) stimulate G(2) cell cycle checkpoint arrest and apoptosis in response to N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). MMR-deficient cells fail to detect MNNG-induced DNA damage, resulting in the survival of ""mutator"" cells. The retrograde (nucleus-to-cytoplasm) signaling that initiates MMR-dependent G(2) arrest and cell death remains undefined. Since MMR-dependent phosphorylation and stabilization of p53 were noted, we investigated its role(s) in G(2) arrest and apoptosis. Loss of p53 function by E6 expression, dominant-negative p53, or stable p53 knockdown failed to prevent MMR-dependent G(2) arrest, apoptosis, or lethality. MMR-dependent c-Abl-mediated p73alpha and GADD45alpha protein up-regulation after MNNG exposure prompted us to examine c-Abl/p73alpha/GADD45alpha signaling in cell death responses. STI571 (Gleevec, a c-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor) and stable c-Abl, p73alpha, and GADD45alpha knockdown prevented MMR-dependent apoptosis. Interestingly, stable p73alpha knockdown blocked MMR-dependent apoptosis, but not G(2) arrest, thereby uncoupling G(2) arrest from lethality. Thus, MMR-dependent intrinsic apoptosis is p53-independent, but stimulated by hMLH1/c-Abl/p73alpha/GADD45alpha retrograde signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2079825986,"During polytopic protein biogenesis, multiple transmembrane segments (TMs) must pass through the ribosome exit tunnel and into the Sec61 translocon prior to insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. To investigate how movement of a newly synthesized TM along this integration pathway might be influenced by synthesis of a second TM, we used photocross-linking probes to detect the proximity of ribosome-bound nascent polypeptides to Sec61alpha. Probes were inserted at sequential sites within TM2 of the aquaporin-1 water channel by in vitro translation of truncated mRNAs. TM2 first contacted Sec61alpha when the probe was positioned approximately 38 residues from the ribosome peptidyltransferase center, and TM2-Sec61alpha photoadducts decreased markedly when the probe was >80 residues from the peptidyltransferase center. Unexpectedly, as nascent chain length was gradually extended, photocross-linking at multiple sites within TM2 abruptly and transiently decreased, indicating that TM2 initially entered, withdrew, and then re-entered Sec61alpha. This brief reduction in TM2 photocross-linking coincided with TM3 synthesis. Replacement of TM3 with a secretory reporter domain or introduction of proline residues into TM3 changed the TM2 cross-linking profile and this biphasic behavior. These findings demonstrate that the primary and likely secondary structure of the nascent polypeptide within the ribosome exit tunnel can influence the timing with which topogenic determinants contact, enter, and pass through the translocon."
https://openalex.org/W2040162022,"Current published data suggest that DNA mismatch repair (MMR) triggers prolonged G(2) cell cycle checkpoint arrest after alkylation damage from N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) by activating ATR (ataxia telangiectasia-Rad3-related kinase). However, analyses of isogenic MMR-proficient and MMR-deficient human RKO colon cancer cells revealed that although ATR/Chk1 signaling controlled G(2) arrest in MMR-deficient cells, ATR/Chk1 activation was not involved in MMR-dependent G(2) arrest. Instead, we discovered that disrupting c-Abl activity using STI571 (Gleevec, a c-Abl inhibitor) or stable c-Abl knockdown abolished MMR-dependent p73alpha stabilization, induction of GADD45alpha protein expression, and G(2) arrest. In addition, inhibition of c-Abl also increased the survival of MNNG-exposed MMR-proficient cells to a level comparable with MMR-deficient cells. Furthermore, knocking down GADD45alpha (but not p73alpha) protein levels affected MMR-dependent G(2) arrest responses. Thus, MMR-dependent G(2) arrest responses triggered by MNNG are dependent on a human MLH1/c-Abl/GADD45alpha signaling pathway and activity. Furthermore, our data suggest that caution should be taken with therapies targeting c-Abl kinase because increased survival of mutator phenotypes may be an unwanted consequence."
https://openalex.org/W2155028156,"Background The genome of the pico-eukaryotic (bacterial-sized) prasinophyte green alga Ostreococcus lucimarinus has one of the highest gene densities known in eukaryotes, yet it contains many introns. Phylogenetic studies suggest this unusually compact genome (13.2 Mb) is an evolutionarily derived state among prasinophytes. The presence of introns in the highly reduced O. lucimarinus genome appears to be in opposition to simple explanations of genome evolution based on unidirectional tendencies, either neutral or selective. Therefore, patterns of intron retention in this species can potentially provide insights into the forces governing intron evolution. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we studied intron features and levels of expression in O. lucimarinus using expressed sequence tags (ESTs) to annotate the current genome assembly. ESTs were assembled into unigene clusters that were mapped back to the O. lucimarinus Build 2.0 assembly using BLAST and the level of gene expression was inferred from the number of ESTs in each cluster. We find a positive correlation between expression levels and both intron number (R = +0.0893, p = <0.0005) and intron density (number of introns/kb of CDS; R = +0.0753, p = <0.005). Conclusions/Significance In a species with a genome that has been recently subjected to a great reduction of non-coding DNA, these results imply the existence of selective/functional roles for introns that are principally detectable in highly expressed genes. In these cases, introns are likely maintained by balancing the selective forces favoring their maintenance with other mutational and/or selective forces acting on genome size."
https://openalex.org/W2156204225,"Background Type 2 diabetes often displays hyperlipidemia. We examined palmitate effects on pancreatic islet function in relation to FFA receptor GPR40, NO generation, insulin release, and the PPARγ agonistic thiazolidinedione, rosiglitazone. Principal Findings Rosiglitazone suppressed acute palmitate-stimulated GPR40-transduced PI hydrolysis in HEK293 cells and insulin release from MIN6c cells and mouse islets. Culturing islets 24 h with palmitate at 5 mmol/l glucose induced β-cell iNOS expression as revealed by confocal microscopy and increased the activities of ncNOS and iNOS associated with suppression of glucose-stimulated insulin response. Rosiglitazone reversed these effects. The expression of iNOS after high-glucose culturing was unaffected by rosiglitazone. Downregulation of GPR40 by antisense treatment abrogated GPR40 expression and suppressed palmitate-induced iNOS activity and insulin release. Conclusion We conclude that, in addition to mediating acute FFA-stimulated insulin release, GPR40 is an important regulator of iNOS expression and dysfunctional insulin release during long-term exposure to FFA. The adverse effects of palmitate were counteracted by rosiglitazone at GPR40, suggesting that thiazolidinediones are beneficial for β-cell function in hyperlipidemic type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2002863037,"Information capture by photoreceptors ultimately limits the quality of visual processing in the brain. Using conventional sharp microelectrodes, we studied how locust photoreceptors encode random (white-noise, WN) and naturalistic (1/f stimuli, NS) light patterns in vivo and how this coding changes with mean illumination and ambient temperature. We also examined the role of their plasma membrane in shaping voltage responses. We found that brightening or warming increase and accelerate voltage responses, but reduce noise, enabling photoreceptors to encode more information. For WN stimuli, this was accompanied by broadening of the linear frequency range. On the contrary, with NS the signaling took place within a constant bandwidth, possibly revealing a 'preference' for inputs with 1/f statistics. The faster signaling was caused by acceleration of the elementary phototransduction current--leading to bumps--and their distribution. The membrane linearly translated phototransduction currents into voltage responses without limiting the throughput of these messages. As the bumps reflected fast changes in membrane resistance, the data suggest that their shape is predominantly driven by fast changes in the light-gated conductance. On the other hand, the slower bump latency distribution is likely to represent slower enzymatic intracellular reactions. Furthermore, the Q(10)s of bump duration and latency distribution depended on light intensity. Altogether, this study suggests that biochemical constraints imposed upon signaling change continuously as locust photoreceptors adapt to environmental light and temperature conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2156549729,"Remarkably, although cardiac disease accounts for the largest proportion of adult mortality and morbidity in the industrialized world, the genetic programs controlling early cardiogenesis are largely incompletely understood. To better understand this process, we set out to identify genes whose expression is enriched within early cardiac fated populations, obtaining the transcriptional signatures of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) at defined intervals during their differentiation along a cardiac path. We compared the RNA profiles of cardiac precursors cells (CPCs) with time-matched non-CPCs and undifferentiated mESCs, using a transgenic mESC line harboring an Nkx2-5 cardiac-specific regulatory sequence driving green fluorescent protein (GFP) to facilitate selection of CPCs. We identify 176 transcripts that are significantly elevated in their abundance within CPCs compared with other assayed populations, predicting that they will likely play a role in cardiogenesis. Of note, approximately 24% (43/176) of the cardiogenic candidate transcripts have known roles in cardiac function or development. Importantly, we evaluated the biological relevance of a significant subset 31/133 (23%) of the remaining candidate genes by in situ hybridization at multiple time points during development (embryonic day, E7.5–9.5) and report that all were expressed in key cardiac structures during cardiogenesis. Furthermore 9/31, of which many were previously uncharacterized, were detected as early as the formation of the cardiac crescent. These data demonstrate the potential power of integrating genomic approaches with mESC differentiation to illuminate developmental processes, and provides a valuable resource that may be mined to further elucidate the genetic programs underlying cardiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2022813624,"Background Surgery and radiation are the mainstays of therapy for human gliomas that are the most common primary brain tumors. Most recently, cell culture and animal studies provided the first convincing evidence that radiation not only eliminates tumor cells, but also modulates the immune response and likely improves anti-tumor immunotherapy. Methology/Pricipal Findings We present an in vivo study that analyzes the effects of radiation on the immune response in tumor patients. As readout system, we utilized the reactivity of glioma patients' sera against antigen GLEA2 as the most frequent antigen immunogenic in glioblastoma patients. We established an ELISA assay to analyze reactivity of 24 glioblastoma patients over a period of several months. As control we used 30 sera from healthy donors as well as 30 sera from lung cancer patients. We compared the course of GLEA2 seroreactivity at different times prior, during and after radiation. The GLEA2 seroreactivity was increased by the time of surgery, decreased after surgery, increased again under radiation, and slightly decreased after radiation. Conclusions/Significance Our results provide in vivo evidence for an increased antibody response against tumor antigens under radiation. Antigens that become immunogenic with an increased antibody response as result of radiation can serve as ideal targets for immunotherapy of human tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2059964527,"Background The revelation that the human genome encodes only ∼25,000 genes and thus cannot account for phenotypic complexity has been one of the biggest surprises in the post-genomic era. However, accumulating evidence suggests that transcriptional regulation may be in large part responsible for this observed mammalian complexity. Consequently, there has been a strong drive to locate cis-regulatory regions in mammalian genomes in order to understand the unifying principles governing these regions, including their genomic distribution. Although a number of systematic approaches have been developed, these all discount coding sequence. Methodology/Principal Findings Using the computational tool PRI (Pattern-defined Regulatory Islands), which does not mask coding sequence, we identified a regulatory region associated with the gene ADAMTS5 that encompasses the entirety of the essential coding exon 2. We demonstrate through a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation and reporter gene studies that this region can not only bind the myogenic transcription factors MYOD and myogenin and the E-protein HEB but can also function as a very strong myogenic transcriptional enhancer. Conclusions/Significance Thus, we report the identification and detailed characterization of an exonic enhancer. Ultimately, this leads to the interesting question of why evolution would be so parsimonious in the functional assignment of sequence."
https://openalex.org/W2126055619,"Background Intralocus sexual conflict can inhibit the evolution of each sex towards its own fitness optimum. In a previous study, we confirmed this prediction through the experimental removal of female selection pressures in Drosophila melanogaster, achieved by limiting the expression of all major chromosomes to males. Compared to the control populations (C1-4) where the genomes are exposed to selection in both sexes, the populations with male-limited genomes (ML1-4) showed rapid increases in male fitness, whereas the fitness of females expressing ML-evolved chromosomes decreased [1]. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we examine the behavioural phenotype underlying this sexual antagonism. We show that males expressing the ML genomes have a reduced courtship level but acquire the same number of matings. On the other hand, our data suggest that females expressing the ML genomes had reduced attractiveness, stimulating a lower rate of courtship from males. Moreover, females expressing ML genomes tend to display reduced yeast-feeding behaviour, which is probably linked to the reduction of their fecundity. Conclusion/Significance These results suggest that reproductive behaviour is shaped by opposing selection on males and females, and that loci influencing attractiveness and foraging were polymorphic for alleles with sexually antagonistic expression patterns prior to ML selection. Hence, intralocus sexual conflict appears to play a role in the evolution of a wide range of fitness-related traits and may be a powerful mechanism for the maintenance of genetic variation in fitness."
https://openalex.org/W2039126558,"Clinical and pathological changes in familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) cases may be similar or indistinguishable from sporadic CJD. Therefore determination of novel mutations in PRNP remains of major importance. We identified two different rare mutations in codon 188 of the prion protein gene (PRNP) in four patients suffering from a disease clinically very similar to the major subtype of sporadic CJD. Both mutations result in an exchange of the amino acid residue threonine for a highly basic residue, either arginine (T188R) or lysine (T188K). The T188R mutation was found in one patient and the T188K mutation in three patients. The prevalence of mutations at codon 188 of PRNP was tested in 593 sporadic CJD cases and 735 healthy individuals. Neither mutation was found. The data presented here argue in favor of T188K being a pathogenic mutation causing genetic CJD. Since one individual with this mutation, who is the father of a clinically affected patient with T188K mutation, is now 79 years old and shows no signs of disease, this mutation is likely associated with a penetrance under 100%. Further observations will have to show whether T188R is a pathogenic mutation."
https://openalex.org/W2025321322,"Microglial activation, characterized by p38 MAPK or p44/42 MAPK pathway signal transduction, occurs in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our previous studies demonstrated CD45, a membrane-bound protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP), opposed beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide-induced microglial activation via inhibition of p44/42 MAPK. Additionally we have shown agonism of the RB isoform of CD45 (CD45RB) abrogates lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced microglial activation.In this study, CD45RB modulation of Abeta peptide or LPS-activated primary cultured microglial cells was further investigated. Microglial cells were co-treated with ""aged"" FITC-Abeta(1-42) and multiple CD45 isoform agonist antibodies. Data revealed cross-linking of CD45, particularly the CD45RB isoform, enhances microglial phagocytosis of Abeta(1-42) peptide and inhibits LPS-induced activation of p44/42 and p38 pathways. Co-treatment of microglial cells with agonist CD45 antibodies results in significant inhibition of LPS-induced microglial TNF-alpha and IL-6 release through p44/42 and/or p38 pathways. Moreover, inhibition of either of these pathways augmented CD45RB cross-linking induced microglial phagocytosis of Abeta(1-42) peptide. To investigate the mechanism(s) involved, microglial cells were co-treated with a PTP inhibitor (potassium bisperoxo [1,10-phenanthroline oxovanadate; Phen]) and Abeta(1-42) peptides. Data showed synergistic induction of microglial activation as evidenced by TNF-alpha and IL-6 release; both of which are demonstrated to be dependent on increased p44/42 and/or p38 activation. Finally, it was observed that cross-linking of CD45RB in the presence of Abeta(1-42) peptide, inhibits co-localization of microglial MHC class II and Abeta peptide; suggesting CD45 activation inhibits the antigen presenting phenotype of microglial cells.In summary, p38 MAPK is another novel signaling pathway, besides p44/42, in which CD45RB cross-linking negatively regulates microglial Abeta phagocytosis while increasing potentially neurotoxic inflammation. Therefore, agonism of CD45RB PTP activity may be an effective therapeutic target for novel agents to treat AD due to its Abeta lowering, and inflammation reducing, properties that are particularly targeted at microglial cells. Such treatments may be more effective with less potential to produce systemic side-effects than therapeutics which induce non-specific, systemic down-regulation of inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2066353422,"In the work reported here, we set out to study the neural systems that detect predictable temporal patterns and departures from them. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to locate activity in the brains of subjects when they viewed temporally regular and irregular patterns produced by letters, numbers, colors and luminance. Activity induced by irregular sequences was located within dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, including an area that was responsive to irregular patterns regardless of the type of visual stimuli producing them. Conversely, temporally regular arrangements resulted in activity in the right frontal lobe (medial frontal gyrus), in the left orbito-frontal cortex and in the left pallidum. The results show that there is an abstractive system in the brain for detecting temporal irregularity, regardless of the source producing it."

To maximize fitness, males should adjust their copulatory investment in relation to this intensity. However, fitness costs associated with sperm competition may not only depend on how many males a female has mated with, but also how related rival males are. According to theoretical predictions, males should adjust their copulatory investment in response to the relatedness of their male rival, and transfer more sperm to females that have first mated with a non-sibling male than females that have mated to a related male. Here, for the first time, we empirically test this theory using the Australian field cricket Teleogryllus oceanicus. We expose male crickets to sperm competition from either a full sibling or non-sibling male, by using both the presence of a rival male and the rival male's actual competing ejaculate as cues. Contrary to predictions, we find that males do not adjust ejaculates in response to the relatedness of their male rival. Instead, males with both full-sibling and non-sibling rivals allocate sperm of similar quality to females. This lack of kin biased behaviour is independent of any potentially confounding effect of strong competition between close relatives; kin biased behaviour was absent irrespective of whether males were raised in full sibling or mixed relatedness groups."
https://openalex.org/W2009454964,"The content of guanine+cytosine varies markedly along the chromosomes of homeotherms and great effort has been devoted to studying this heterogeneity and its biological implications. Already before the DNA-sequencing era, however, it was established that the dinucleotides in the DNA of mammals in particular, and of most organisms in general, show striking over- and under-representations that cannot be explained by the base composition. Here we show that in the coding regions of vertebrates both GC content and codon occurrences are strongly correlated with such “motif preferences” even though we quantify the latter using an index that is not affected by the base composition, codon usage, and protein-sequence encoding. These correlations are likely to be the result of the long-term shaping of the primary structure of genic and non-genic DNA by a regime of mutation of which central features have been maintained by natural selection. We find indeed that these preferences are conserved in vertebrates even more rigidly than codon occurrences and we show that the occurrence-preference correlations are stronger in intronic and non-genic DNA, with the R2s reaching 99% when GC content is ∼0.5. The mutation regime appears to be characterized by rates that depend markedly on the bases present at the site preceding and at that following each mutating site, because when we estimate such rates of neighbor-base-dependent mutation (NBDM) from substitutions retrieved from alignments of coding, intronic, and non-genic mammalian DNA sorted and grouped by GC content, they suffice to simulate DNA sequences in which motif occurrences and preferences as well as the correlations of motif preferences with GC content and with motif occurrences, are very similar to the mammalian ones. The best fit, however, is obtained with NBDM regimes lacking strand effects, which indicates that over the long term NBDM switches strands in the germline as one would expect for effects due to loosely contained background transcription. Finally, we show that human coding regions are less mutable under the estimated NBDM regimes than under matched context-independent mutation and that this entails marked differences between the spectra of amino-acid mutations that either mutation regime should generate. In the Discussion we examine the mechanisms likely to underlie NBDM heterogeneity along chromosomes and propose that it reflects how the diversity and activity of lesion-bypass polymerases (LBPs) track the landscapes of scheduled and non-scheduled genome repair, replication, and transcription during the cell cycle. We conclude that the primary structure of vertebrate genic DNA at and below the trinucleotide level has been governed over the long term by highly conserved regimes of NBDM which should be under direct natural selection because they alter drastically missense-mutation rates and hence the somatic and the germline mutational loads. Therefore, the non-coding DNA of vertebrates may have been shaped by NBDM only epiphenomenally, with non-genic DNA being affected mainly when found in the proximity of genes."
