https://openalex.org/W2044084407,Honey bees orient to the earth's magnetic field. This ability may be associated with a region of transversely oriented magnetic material in the front of the abdomen. The magnetic moment apparently develops in the pupal state and persists in the adults.
https://openalex.org/W2078206071,"Isotopic composition of lead and strontium has been determined in a series of rock samples from two islands on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Both interand intra-island variations exist in the abundance of radiogenic isotopes of both elements. Lead from basalt of Ascension Island has a Pb(206)-Pb(204) ratio of 19.5, while the corresponding ratio at Gough Island is only 18.4. The Pb(208)-Pb(204) ratios from the two islands do not differ. Conversely, strontium from basalt of Ascension Island is less radiogenic than that from Gough Island basalts. The trachytes of both islands have lead and strontium that is more radiogenic than that found in the basalts. The inter-island differences indicate the existence of regional variations in the uranium-lead and rubidium-strontium ratios of the upper mantle source of these rocks and show that isotope compositions are a means for investigating chemical heterogeneities in the mantle."
https://openalex.org/W2005935078,"The Africanized honey bee, a hybrid of European and African honey bees, is thought to displace native pollinators. After experimental introduction of Africanized honey bee hives near flowers, stingless bees became less abundant or harvested-less resource as visitation by Africanized honey bees increased. Shifts in resource use caused by colonizing Africanized honey bees may lead to population decline of Neotropical pollinators."
https://openalex.org/W2160503789,"The Australian Nothomyrmecia macrops is the most primitive living ant. Until recently rediscovered, it was known only from two 46-year-old specimens, both workers. All developmental stages and adult castes are now known. Adults have stridulatory organs placed ventrally, between abdominal sternites III (with plectrum) and IV (with stridulitrum), differing from all other Hymenoptera, where these organs are dorsal. The chromosome number is the highest recorded for Hymenoptera (2n = 92). Virgin queens are brachypterous. Other anatomical and behavioral features are reviewed. Most are primitive for ants, many being shared with Myrmecia, another primitive Australian genus. Fundamental differences in abdominal structure place Myrmecia near the base of the poneroid phylad of ant subfamilies, while Nothomyrmecia is a primitive formicoid."
https://openalex.org/W2014438059,"The observed rate of isoleucine epimerization in peptides and proteins is dependent on (in addition to time and temperature) (i) the position of isoleucine in the peptide chain, (ii) the nature of adjacent amino acids, and (iii) the stability of the isoleucine peptide bonds. The relative rate is: NH(2)-terminal > COOH-terminal >> interior >/= free amino acid. The gradual hydrolysis of peptides and proteins to the more slowly epimerizing free amino acid causes a decrease in the apparent first-order rate constant with time. These results explain the isoleucine kinetics observed in fossil shells."
https://openalex.org/W2003908416,"The formation and propagation of spatial patterns in the presence of an initial gradient in temperature or the concentration of one or more of the reactants is explained kinematically. Experimental verification of this mechanism is given, showing that diffusion plays a very minor role in the formation of the bands."

https://openalex.org/W2087400196,"A space-time composite of polar stereographic ultraviolet images of Venus from Mariner 10 shows a remarkable circumpolar vortex. The vortex is characterized by a cloud which appears similar to dense terrestrial stratus having an albedo that is 50 percent higher. Spiral streaks converge into it from low latitudes, akin to the spiral bands of a hurricane. The bright visible polar cloud is not axisymmetric but has roughly an elliptical shape. The high brightness of the polar cloud suggests that it has a different origin from the rest of the Venus cloud cover."
https://openalex.org/W1997067158,"Imported cabbageworms, Pieris rapae (L.), were reared in cans exposed to light from fluorescent lamps for 10 hours daily. When larvae were exposed to daily electronic photoflashes scheduled 3 to 4 hours after the fluorescent lamp was turned off, pupae failed to diapause. Effective wavelengths are lower than those controlling photoperiodism in plants. The effective energies are about 1 joule per square centimeter."
https://openalex.org/W2000272826,A high-resolution radar sounder has been used in the simultaneous detection of atmospheric structure and insects. The vertical distribution of insects was often correlated with atmospheric structure. Continuous recordings revealed diurnal fluctuations and layering of insects at various altitudes.
https://openalex.org/W2029672087,"This article discusses circumstances under which free quarks catalyze exothermal nuclear reactions. It also presents possible methods for removing quarks sequestered by nuclear reaction products. Stable quarks that are negatively charged and significantly heavier than electrons attract positively charged nuclei to form new states of matter. The nuclei and quarks are closely bound, and presumably interact through both electromagnetic and nuclear forces. Nuclear fusion and fission are possible, as well as a new class of plural reactions in which either a quark isobar, isotope, or isotone is created in each individual reaction, with catalysis resulting in the overall system because the net transfer of charge, neutrons, or protons to the quarks is zero. The quark with quantum numbers of üü is a promising catalytic candidate. A satisfactory understanding of which reactions are or are not possible awaits the isolation of free quarks and a description of their strong interactions with matter. Finally, other kinds of stable negatively charged particles (such as heavy leptons), if discovered, can catalyze deuterium fusion reactions if thermal neutrons are used to liberate He(3)-bound catalytic particles."
https://openalex.org/W1993485169,"The climatic warming of 10,000 years ago is now affecting the central portions of ice sheets, causing ice-flow acceleration. This process explains the present-day thinning of the ice sheet in West Antarctica. Former ice sheets must have also responded to climatic warming with a delay of thousands of years. This lag in response is important in the climatic interpretation of glacial deposits and of changes in ice volume obtained from deep-sea cores."
https://openalex.org/W1976813707,The residence times of the soluble fractions of beryllium and aluminum in seawater are estimated to be 1500 years or more. These residence times are estimated from a comparison of the annual deposition rates of cosmogenic beryllium-10 and aluminum-26 with the concentrations of beryllium-10 and aluminum-26 in seawater estimated from the specific activities of these radionuclides in an authigenic mineral assembly such as a manganese nodule. These residence times are greater by an order of magnitude than the mean residence times of beryllium and aluminum estimated from the geochemical balance.
https://openalex.org/W2035043943,"The induction of the male sexual organ primordia (antheridial hyphae) by the steroid hormone antheridiol in the water mold Achlya ambisexualis requires both transcription and translation. Inhibition of either of these processes eliminates the expected increase in the production and release of the enzyme cellulase, which accompanies the formation of the antheridial hyphae."

https://openalex.org/W1995585112,"The luminosity function is used to estimate the number of invisible planet-like objects in the neighborhood of the sun, taking into account the likely chemical composition of planets in relation to the composition of main-sequence stars. There may be about 60 objects more massive than Mars for every visible star. An attempt is made to estimate the distribution of these planet-like cold bodies in relation to stars. It is suggested that stars, together with cold objects, were formed in clusters of bodies of random size distribution. Clusters averaging about 50 bodies each account for the observed distribution of frequencies of double and triple star systems relative to single stars. On this basis, virtually every star should have a planetary system associated with it. As a corollary, systems of cold bodies in which there are no luminous stars should be abundant. The possible distribution of planets around such stars has been studied, making use of the observed orbital characteristics of double star systems. It is concluded that favorable conditions for life processes may be far more abundant than has generally been thought possible."

https://openalex.org/W1975901692,"Apollo 16 and Apollo 17 photographs of the far side of the moon reveal a double-ringed basin 500 kilometers in diameter centered at 1 degrees N, 112 degrees E. The structure is very old and subdued; it is probably Pre-Nectarian in age and appears to have been filled and modified by younger events. The heights of the basin's rings are based on laser altimeter data from Apollo missions 15 through 17; these data suggest a third outer ring, approximately 1000 kilometers in diameter. Laser measurements also indicate that the filled basin separates the relatively low terrain on the eastern limb of the moon from the higher, more rugged highlands to the east."
