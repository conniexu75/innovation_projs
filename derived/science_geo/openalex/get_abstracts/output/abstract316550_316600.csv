https://openalex.org/W2093599502,"Experimental reduction of insect grazing pressures suggests that long-term, continuous feeding by phytophagous insects has severely depressed growth and productivity of subalpine Eucalyptus trees (measured by annual ring growth) for at least 25 years."
https://openalex.org/W2072533371,"Cyril Burt presented data in his classic paper ""Intelligence and social mobility"" that were in perfect agreement with a genetic theory of IQ and social class. A detailed analysis of these data reveals, beyond reasonable doubt, that they were fabricated from a theoretical normal curve, from a genetic regression equation, and from figures published more than 30 years before Burt completed his surveys."
https://openalex.org/W2049952821,"1) The distribution of age values obtained by potassium-argon determinations and whole-rock rubidium-strontium determinations appears to be almost identical for West African rocks of the pervasive Eburnean Orogenic Cycle and basement rocks at opposite locations in South America. 2) There is also a close correlation, with respect to potassium-argon age determinations on micas, rubidium-strontium determinations on total-rock samples, and the extent to which these two sets of values differ, between rocks of the Pan-African Orogenic Cycle and rocks of the Caririan Orogenic Cycle in Brazil, where these two groups of rocks lie opposite each other in the two continents. 3) When Africa and South America are ""fitted together,"" the sharply defined boundary between the Eburnean and the Pan-African age provinces in West Africa strikes directly toward the corresponding age boundary in northeast Brazil. 4) The transition from the 550-million-year Pan-African age province to the 2000-million-year age province in the Congo Craton in Cameroun-Gabon is matched in the rocks near the corresponding part of the east coast of Brazil. However the geological and age data are insufficient to do more than suggest the possibility of another age-boundary correlation here. 5) The evidence reported here supports the hypothesis of continental drift."

https://openalex.org/W2082966899,"Purple sea urchins were tagged, measured, and placed in a tidepool at Sunset Bay, Oregon. After 1 year, many animals had decreased in size. Accordingly, size is not necessarily a reliable index of age in Strongylocentrotus purpuratus; however, it is possible to conclude that these animals are relatively long-lived."
https://openalex.org/W1978883841,"A topographic feature on the continental slope off Charleston at 32 degrees N persistently deflects the Gulf Stream seaward, with the inshore surface thermal front deflected east or south of east in 27 of the 39 cases examined. Meanders often form downstream of the deflection, suggesting that the ""Charleston bump"" induces Gulf Stream fluctuations."
https://openalex.org/W2073399155,"For the first time, Gonyaulax excavata cysts have been shown to be toxic. Bottom sediments from a water depth of 90 meters off the Maine coast were extremely rich in cysts, which were approximately ten times more toxic than the corresponding motile stages. Cysts are probably ingested by shellfish, thereby causing shellfish toxicity in deeper waters offshore and contributing to shellfish toxicity in shallower coastal waters. A new approach to the problem of paralytic shellfish poisoning is therefore needed, one that takes into account benthic cysts and sedimentary factors affecting their distribution. The possible dangers of spreading poisoning through human activities must be considered."

https://openalex.org/W2035476620,"Optical microscopy shows that the protein network in endosperm cells of normal corn is composed of an amorphous matrix in which granules averaging about 2 microns in diameter are embedded. That these granules are rich in zein is demonstrated by their solubility in 80 percent ethanol. High-lysine corn, with submicroscopic granules clearly resolved only in the electron microscope, has a much lower content of zein than normal corn. The small size of subcellular protein granules in high-lysine maize as compared with normal corn correlates with the reported difference in zein content of the two types of corn."
https://openalex.org/W1979894106,"Mitochondria isolated from etiolated Texas male-sterile (TMS) cytoplasm maize (Zea mays L.) seedlings were adversely affected by methomyl (Lannate, 90 wettable powder), while those isolated from normal-fertile seedlings were not. In a manner analogous to that reported for Bipolaris (Helminthosporium) maydis (race T) toxin, experiments with TMS mitochondria showed that 1 to 3 millimolar methomyl inhibited the state 4 oxidation rate of combined malate and pyruvate while stimulating that of succinate or exogenous reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. Similar concentrations of methomyl effected an inhibition of phosphorylation, an increase in the percentage of transmittance of light through mitochondrial suspensions, and a decrease in the density of the mitochondrial matrix. Methomyl (15 millimolar) had little effect on the physiological activity or ultrastructure of isolated normal-fertile mitochondria. These observations provide the opportunity to specifically assess the homogeneity, or lack of it, of a cytoplasmic heritable characteristic in a widely divergent group of higher plants."
https://openalex.org/W1992041872,The spectral sensitivity at the opponent stage of the visual system is traditionally measured by a hue-cancellation procedure. Comparison with a direct hue-matching method shows that cancellation overestimates short-wavelength sensitivity by as much as a factor of 30. The observation implies that different mechanisms control the perception of short-wavelength and long-wavelength redness.
https://openalex.org/W1985347616,"The low-speed splash of a drop of liquid into a pool can result in a surprisingly complicated flow pattern, apparently not detected by previous experiments or theories. We examined the dynamics of this process by high-speed computer, obtaining a series of configuration plots at various stages of the splash."
https://openalex.org/W2026454283,"Investigation of 33 islands, scattered widely across the Caroline and Marshall Island groups in the Central Pacific revealed no emerged reefs in which corals had unquestionably formed in situ, or other direct evidence of postglacial high stands of sea level. Low unconsolidated rock terraces and ridges of reefflat islands, mostly lying between tide levels, were composed of rubble conglomerates; carbon-14 dating of 11 samples from the conglomerates so far may suggest a former slightly higher sea level (nine samples range between 1890 and 3450 and one approaches 4500 years ago). However, recent hurricanes have produced ridges of comparable height and material, and in the same areas relics from World War II have been found cemented in place. Thus these datings do not in themselves necessarily indicate formerly higher sea levels. Rubble tracts are produced by storms under present conditions without any change in datum, and there seems to be no compelling evidence that they were not so developed during various periods in the past."
https://openalex.org/W1977423181,"More than 50 cores ranging in age from Pliocene to Lower Miocene have been recovered from the East Pacific Rise. Near the crestal regions the sediment cover is thin or lacking, and only Pleistocene sediments were recovered. On the flanks, the sediment thickness increases and pre-Pleistocene sediments are encountered. This pattern of increasing age and increasing sediment thickness away from the axis of the rise is in agreement with that predicted for spreading of the ocean floor."
https://openalex.org/W2070566576,"The characteristics of the first archosaurs, the proterosuchian thecodonts, show that neither of the supposed common ancestors of archosaurs and lepidosaurs could actually be an ancestor of archosaurs. Instead, the evidence seems to indicate that the archosaurian ancestors are probably in the ophiacodont-varanopsid group of the pelycosaurian synapsids. In particular, the Varanopsidae are strongly indicative of proterosuchian relationships, as they have evolved some characters which are elsewhere found only in archosaurs. Archosaurs and lepidosaurs apparently have different origins; the former come from the pelycosaurs, and the latter come from the captorhinomorph cotylosaurs through the Millerettiformes."
https://openalex.org/W1979764570,"In sediments west of the East Pacific Rise between the equator and 20°N, Eocene microfossils are recorded no farther east than 134°W; Oligocene, no farther east than 125°W; while Miocene and Pliocene occurrences extend closer to the crest of the rise. This distribution may result from post-Eocene spreading of the sea floor here averaging about 8 centimeters per year."
https://openalex.org/W2091464778,"The surface area of silicic acid, a form of silica gel, has been determined by adsorption of methanol from a benzene solvent. The method is straightforward, uses inexpensive apparatus, and should be applicable to other particulate adsorbents."

https://openalex.org/W2033917345,"The radius of the line-emitting region in quasars is larger than 1 parsec for the cosmological hypothesis and smaller than 1 parsec for the local hypothesis. Variability in emission lines has been reported but not proved beyond doubt. Its time scale would be a direct observational indicator of this radius and would add an important element to the discussion of the origin of quasars. Objects that are variable in their optical continuum seem to be the most promising ones to look at for line variations, and they should be observed spectroscopically at regular intervals."
https://openalex.org/W2052008157,"Yields of free radicals in irradiated aqueous solutions of saccharides at 77°K are larger and qualitatively different from those observed in the components alone. In addition, a blue color results only with the solution. The mechanism proposed to explain the observations is the stabilization of hydrated electrons by the solute."
