https://openalex.org/W2025100148,"We present the complete sequence of a cDNA encoding the human amiloride-sensitive antiporter. After functional complementation of a mouse fibroblast mutant by gene transfer, we isolated a 0.8 kb genomic probe from a third-cycle mouse transformant. The probe detects gene amplification in antiporter “overexpressers” and a single class of mRNA of ca. 5.6 kb in human, mouse, and hamster cells. With this probe we isolated a 4 kb cDNA from a library constructed from a mouse transformant in which the transfected human gene was amplified. This cDNA includes a noncoding leader of 407 bp, a 2682 bp open reading frame, and a 3′ noncoding sequence cotaining a mouse B1 repeated element. The amino acid sequence predicts a protein of Mr = 99,354 with an N-terminal amphipathic domain that contains 10 putative transmembrane-spanning segments and two potential glycosylation sites, followed by a hydrophilic stretch of 395 residues, presumably cytoplasmic. Stable expression of the transfected cDNA in antiporter-deficient cells restored the key functional features of this transporter: H+i-activated Na+ influx, amiloride sensitivity, and pHi regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1585654931,"Stimulation of human neutrophils with f-met-leu-phe, platelet-activating factor, or leukotriene B4 resulted in an increase in [Ca2+]i. The [Ca2+]i rise was greater in the presence than absence of external Ca2+; the component that was dependent on external Ca2+ was blocked by Ni2+, or could be reconstituted by addition of external Ca2+ following discharge of the internal Ca2+ store. These measurements of [Ca2+]i responses provide only indirect evidence for agonist-stimulated Ca2+ entry, and here we have used an alternative approach to demonstrate directly agonist-stimulated divalent cation entry. In the presence of extracellular Mn2+, f-met-leu-phe, leukotriene B4, and platelet-activating factor stimulate a quench in fluorescence of fura-2-loaded human neutrophils. This quench was due to stimulated Mn2+ influx and was blocked by Ni2+. When Mn2+ was added in the continued presence of agonist, after discharge of the internal store of Ca2+, a stimulated quench was seen; this result shows that an elevated [Ca2+]i is not needed for the stimulation of Mn2+ entry. Depolarization by high [K+] or addition of the L-type Ca2+ channel agonist, BAY-R-5417, had little or no effect on either [Ca2+]i or Mn2+ entry. These results show that agonists stimulate divalent cation entry (Ca2+ or Mn2+) by a mechanism independent of changes in [Ca2+]i and unrelated to voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels."

https://openalex.org/W1969190686,"The CD4 antigen has been subverted as a receptor by the human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV). Several groups have reported that recombinant, soluble forms of the CD4 molecule (sCD4) block the infection of T lymphocytes by HIV-1, as CD4 binds the HIV envelope glycoprotein, gp120, with high affinity. We now report that sCD4 blocks diverse strains of HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV, but is less effective for HIV-2. The blocking effect is apparent even after adsorption of virions to CD4 cells. Soluble CD4 prevents HIV infection of T-lymphocytic and myelomonocytic cell lines, but neither sCD4 nor anti-CD4 antibodies inhibit infection of glioma and rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W2012068735,"The translocation of an RNA polymerase elongation complex along double helical DNA has been proposed to generate positive supercoiling waves ahead of and negative supercoiling waves behind the transcription ensemble. This twin supercoiled domain model has been tested in vitro. In the presence of prokaryotic DNA topoisomerase I, which selectively removes negative supercoils, transcription from a single promoter results in rapid and extensive positive supercoiling of the DNA template. The accumulation of positive supercoils in the DNA template requires continued movement of the elongation complex as well as sizable nascent RNA chains. These in vitro results provide direct biochemical evidence supporting the twin supercoiled domain model of transcription. Furthermore, the magnitute of DNA supercoiling (torsional) waves generated by transcription is much greater than previously expected, suggesting that transcription is one of the principal factors affecting intracellular DNA supercoiling."
https://openalex.org/W1534999453,"Abstract Type IV collagenase is a metalloproteinase which cleaves type IV collagen in a pepsin-resistant domain. Organomercurial activation of the latent 70-kDa type IV collagenase (type IV procollagenase) results in the autocatalytic removal of an amino-terminal domain resulting in the conversion to a 62-kDa activated form of the enzyme. Synthetic peptides corresponding to domains from the amino terminus (residues 1-17) and an internal domain near the carboxyl terminus (residues 472-490) were used as antigens to generate affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies which recognized their respective domains on the native type IV procollagenase. Western immunoblotting studies of the time course of the organomercurial activation process demonstrate a direct loss of the amino-terminal domain during the conversion to the lower molecular weight form. The amino-terminal sequence of the purified type IV procollagenase before and after activation reveals cleavage at a single locus with removal of residues 1-80, generating a new amino terminus YNFFPRKPKWDKNQ. This results in the removal of three distal cysteine residues located at positions 31, 36, and 73. The type IV collagenase site of autocatalytic cleavage corresponds exactly to the homologous sites of type I collagenase and stromelysin cleavage during their respective organomercurial activation. This site is adjacent to the carboxyl end of a highly conserved region consisting of the sequence PRCGVPDV, which contains an unpaired cysteine residue."
https://openalex.org/W2098507108,"Abstract Primary rat aortic cells, when treated with arginine vasopressin or depolarizing concentrations of K+, responded to atriopeptin II and 8-bromo-cGMP (8-Br-cGMP) with decreases in intracellular Ca2+ levels. The effects of atriopeptin and 8-Br-cGMP were diminished in cells which had been passaged many times. Low levels of cGMP-dependent protein kinase were present in soluble extracts prepared from the unresponsive cells in later passage compared with extracts from responsive cells. Unresponsive cells, when induced to incorporate cGMP-dependent protein kinase into the cytoplasm using the osmotic lysis procedure of Okada and Rechsteiner (Okada, C. Y., and Rechsteiner, M. (1982) Cell 29, 33-41), responded to atriopeptin and 8-Br-cGMP with reductions in peak Ca2+ levels in response to vasopressin and depolarizing concentrations of K+. Cells which were furnished with affinity-purified antibody to the cGMP-dependent protein kinase after the introduction of the kinase remained unresponsive to the effects of atriopeptin. In addition, antibody furnished to responsive primary cultured cells inhibited the effects of atriopeptin and 8-Br-cGMP on Ca2+ levels. These data suggest that repetitively passaged cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells lose their responsiveness to cGMP concurrently with the loss of cGMP-dependent protein kinase. Restoration of kinase to the cells results in the restoration of responsiveness to cGMP. Thus cGMP-dependent protein kinase appears to be the mediator of the reduction in Ca2+ levels upon elevation of intracellular cGMP."
https://openalex.org/W2078321980,"Differential gene expression in the mother cell chamber of sporulating cells of Bacillus subtilis is determined in part by an RNA polymerase sigma factor called sigma K (or sigma 27). The sigma K factor was assigned as the product of the sporulation gene spoIVCB on the basis of the partial aminoterminal amino acid sequence of the purified protein. The spoIVCB gene is now shown to be a truncated gene capable of specifying only the amino terminal half of sigma K. The carboxyl terminal half is specified by another sporulation gene, spoIIIC, to which spoIVCB becomes joined inframe at an intermediate stage of sporulation by site-specific recombination within a 5-base pair repeated sequence. Juxtaposition of spoIVCB and spoIIIC need not be reversible in that the mother cell and its chromosome are discarded at the end of the developmental cycle. The rearrangement of chromosomal DNA could account for the presence of sigma K selectively in the mother cell and may be a precedent for the generation of cell type-specific regulatory proteins in other developmental systems where cells undergo terminal differentiation."

The mutL locus encodes a polypeptide of 70,000 daltons as determined by denaturing gel electrophoresis. The native molecular weight of MutL protein as calculated from the sedimentation coefficient of 5.5 S and Stokes radius of 61 A is 139,000 daltons, indicating that MutL exists as a dimer in solution. In addition to its ability to complement methyl-directed DNA mismatch repair in mutL-deficient cell-free extracts, DNase I protection experiments demonstrate that the purified MutL protein interacts with the MutS-heteroduplex DNA complex in the presence of ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1548496378,"Human urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) binds rapidly and with high affinity to a number of human cell types; this localizes plasmin generation to the close environment of the cell surface. uPA binding to HeLa and U937 cells is mediated by a single class of sites with an affinity of 3.4 +/- 1.3 x 10(-10) M. Binding is abolished by treatment of the cells with trypsin. Chemical cross-linking of Mr 55,000 125I-uPA to the surface of HeLa and U937 cells with disuccinimidyl suberate or with formaldehyde results in the formation of a labeled complex of Mr 100,000, suggesting a Mr of 45,000 +/- 5,000 for the receptor or a subunit thereof. When cells solubilized in Triton X-114 are subjected to heat-induced phase separation, unoccupied receptor, receptor-bound 125I-uPA, and cross-linked 125I-uPA-receptor complex all partition in the detergent phase, whereas the unbound ligand remains in the aqueous phase; similar phase partitioning is observed with endogenous uPA-receptor complexes from cultured human and murine cells. Thus, uPA bound at the cell surface is tightly associated with an amphiphilic membrane protein. Interaction of uPA with this plasma membrane receptor is species-specific, since human uPA fails to bind to murine cells, and murine uPA does not bind to human cells. Finally, incubation of HeLa cells in the presence of epidermal growth factor or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate results, over a period of 24 h, in a progressive change in uPA binding: an approximately 10-fold increase in the number of sites is accompanied by a 10-fold decrease in their affinity. Cross-linking and phase partitioning of 125I-uPA bound to epidermal growth factor- or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-treated cells indicate that, as in control conditions, it is associated with a Mr 45,000 cell surface amphiphilic polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W1997215472,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) interacts with both high affinity (Kd = 10(-10)-10(-11)M) and low affinity (Kd = 10(-8)-10(-9)M) receptors; the binding of NGF to the high affinity receptor is correlated with biological actions of NGF. To determine whether a single NGF binding protein is common to both forms of the receptor, a full-length receptor cDNA was introduced in the NR18 cell line, an NGF receptor-deficient variant of the PC12 pheochromocytoma cell line. The transformant displayed (i) both high and low affinity receptors detectable by receptor binding; (ii) an affinity cross-linking pattern with 125I-labeled NGF similar to that of the parent PC12 cell line; and (iii) biological responsiveness to NGF as assayed by induction of c-fos transcription. These findings support the hypothesis that a single binding protein is common to both forms of the NGF receptor and suggest that an additional protein is required to produce the high affinity form of the NGF receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1541902039,"Blot analysis of poly(A+) RNA showed a rapid and dramatic insulin induction of fatty acid synthase (FAS) mRNA in diabetic mouse liver. Insulin administration to diabetic mice increased the mRNA level 4-fold within 1 h, and a maximum of 19-fold was reached in 6 h. The nutritional induction of FAS mRNA by fasting/refeeding was abolished by streptozotocin-induced diabetes and also by dibutyryl cAMP administered during refeeding in normal animals, demonstrating the roles of insulin and cAMP during nutritional manipulation. Run-on transcription analysis with isolated nuclei showed that the transcription rate of the FAS gene increased 3.5-fold after 30 min, reached a maximum of 7-fold after 2 h of insulin administration in diabetic animals, and was maintained at the maximum level to 6 h. The cAMP, administered to previously fasted normal mice during refeeding of a high carbohydrate diet, abolished the increased transcription of the FAS gene caused by nutritional manipulation. These results indicate positive control by insulin and negative control by dibutyryl cAMP of FAS gene transcription. Furthermore, the effect of insulin on the FAS mRNA level was abolished by cycloheximide administration. This indicates that ongoing protein synthesis is necessary for the transcriptional activation of the FAS gene by insulin."

https://openalex.org/W2086619832,"All mRNAs of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) contain in their 5' untranslated region a sequence termed TAR that responds to trans-activation by the tat (trans-activating) protein. This RNA sequence assumes a stable secondary structure, and its cap structure is relatively inaccessible. Here we report that these structural properties of the TAR sequence underlie the ability of TAR to inhibit in trans the translation of other mRNAs. This mechanism of translation inhibition involves the activation of the double-stranded RNA-dependent kinase (dsl), which in turn phosphorylates the protein synthesis initiation factor 2 (eIF-2). Mutations in the TAR region that diminish the stability of the secondary structure cause a significant reduction in the trans-inhibition. A similar reduction in the dsl activation occurs when TAR is placed further downstream of the cap structure. This is a clear demonstration of a specific naturally occurring mRNA sequence that can activate dsl. We suggest a novel translational regulatory mechanism that interdigitates the activities of eIF-2 and eIF-4F."
https://openalex.org/W1490560449,"The possible role of the catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase in mediating the regulation of prolactin gene transcription has been investigated through the use of a synthetic gene encoding the heat-stable inhibitor of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. To assess the effects of protein kinase inhibitor expression on cAMP induction of prolactin gene transcription, a marker gene containing the rat prolactin promoter and adjacent 5'-flanking sequences linked to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene was cotransfected with a protein kinase inhibitor-expression vector. The results demonstrate that the protein kinase inhibitor-expression vector reduced both basal and cAMP-stimulated expression of the cotransfected prolactin-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. A mutant protein kinase inhibitor-expression vector, coding for an inactive inhibitor protein, did not inhibit basal or cAMP-stimulated prolactin gene transcription. Furthermore, the protein kinase inhibitor-expression vector did not inhibit zinc induction of the metallothionein promoter. Analysis of protein kinase activity in transfected cells demonstrated that the protein kinase inhibitor expression vector reduced cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity but did not reduce protein kinase C activity. Nuclease protection experiments confirmed that the effects of the inhibitor vector involved changes in correctly initiated transcripts produced from the prolactin promoter. Surprisingly, the protein kinase inhibitor-expression vector reduced the effects of several different agents including epidermal growth factor, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, phorbol esters, and estrogen on prolactin gene expression to the same extent as it altered cAMP effects."
https://openalex.org/W2006712138,"Difficulties associated with in vitro manipulation and culture of the early chicken embryo have restricted generation of transgenic chickens to approaches that use replication-competent retroviruses. The need to produce transgenic chickens in the absence of replicating virus prompted development of a new method of gene transfer into the chicken. Microinjection of the replication-defective reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) vector ME111 beneath unincubated chicken embryo blastoderms results in infection of germline stem cells. This vector contains genetic information exogenous to the chicken genome, including both the herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase gene and the Tn5 neomycin phosphotransferase gene. About 8 percent of male birds hatched from injected embryos contained vector DNA in their semen. All four positive males tested passed vector sequences onto their progeny. Analysis of G1 offspring showed that gonads of G0 male birds were mosaic with respect to insertion of vector provirus. Thus, primordial germ cells present in the unincubated chicken embryo blastoderm are susceptible to infection by defective REV vectors."

HTLV-I sequences were detected in all six MS patients and in one individual from the control group by DNA blot analysis and molecular cloning of amplified DNAs. The viral sequence in MS patients were associated with adherent cell populations consisting predominantly of monocytes and macrophages. Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence analysis indicated that these amplified viral sequences were related to the HTLV-I proviral genome."
https://openalex.org/W1971180826,"Embryonal carcinoma (EC) cell lines are models for early cells in mouse embryogenesis. A 300-base pair fragment of the heavy chain enhancer was inactive in F9 EC cells, unlike in other nonlymphoid cells where it has significant activity. Alterations of the octamer motif increased enhancer activity. Nuclear extracts from F9 cells contained an octamer binding protein (NF-A3) that was unique to EC cells; the amount of NF-A3 decreased upon differentiation. It is proposed that NF-A3 represses specific regulatory sequences that contain the octamer motif. Thus, the same DNA sequence mediates either negative or positive transcriptional effects, depending on the cell type."

https://openalex.org/W1530048935,"Muscular dysgenesis is a lethal mutation in mice that results in a complete absence of skeletal muscle contraction due to the failure of depolarization of the transverse tubular membrane to trigger calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In order to determine whether the defect in muscular dysgenesis leads to a specific loss of one of the components of excitation-contraction coupling or to a generalized loss of all components of excitation-contraction coupling, we have analyzed skeletal muscle from control and dysgenic mice for the sarcoplasmic reticulum and transverse tubular proteins which are believe to function in excitation-contraction coupling. We report that the proteins involved in sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium transport, storage, and release [Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase, calsequestrin, and calcium release channel) are present in dysgenic muscle. Also present in dysgenic muscle is the 175/150-kDa glycoprotein subunit (α2) of the dihydropyridine receptor. However, the 170-kDa dihydropyridine binding subunit (α1) of the dihydropyridine receptor is absent in dysgenic muscle. These results suggest that the specific absence of the α1 subunit of the dihydropyridine receptor is responsible for the defects in muscular dysgenesis and that the α1 subunit of the dihydropyridine receptor is essential for excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle."

https://openalex.org/W1582263310,"Abstract The aim of the present study has been to characterize the regulation by opiates of 45Ca2+ influx in rat spinal cord-dorsal root ganglion cocultures. We have demonstrated that K+-induced depolarization, in the presence of the Ca2+ channel agonist Bay K8644, stimulated Ca2+ influx (3-4-fold) via the dihydropyridine class of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. While mu and delta opiates had no effect, kappa opiate agonists (e.g. U50488, dynorphin) profoundly depressed the stimulated Ca2+ influx (86% inhibition at 100 microM U50488). The kappa agonist action was stereospecific and could be reversed by the opiate antagonist naloxone. The inhibition produced by kappa agonists was greatly diminished following pertussis toxin treatment, and this effect was accompanied by toxin-induced ADP-ribosylation of a 40-41-kDa protein. This suggests that kappa opiate receptors are negatively coupled to voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, via a pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP-binding protein. Basal 45Ca2+ uptake, stimulated by adenylate cyclase activators (forskolin and cholera toxin), was potently inhibited by kappa opiates suggesting that, under conditions of neurohormonal stimulation of adenylate cyclase, kappa receptors are coupled to Ca2+ channels indirectly via the adenylate cyclase complex. In addition, cAMP-independent coupling pathways may also be involved."
https://openalex.org/W1485697008,"The requirement for nucleotide hydrolysis in the DNA repair mechanism of the Escherichia coli UvrABC protein complex has been analyzed. The DNA-activated UvrAB ATPase activity is part of a helicase activity exhibited by the UvrAB protein complex. The helicase acts only on short duplexes and, therefore, is unlike other helicases such as those involved in DNA replication that unwind long duplexes. The strand displacement activity occurs in the 5'----3' direction and requires either ATP or dATP. The helicase activity is inhibited by UV photoproducts. The absence of this activity in a complex formed with proteolyzed UvrB (UvrB*), a complex also deficient in the endonuclease activity, suggests that this activity is important in the repair mechanism. The UvrAB protein complex may remain bound to a damaged site and by coupling the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis, alter the DNA conformation around the damage site to one that is permissive for endonucleolytic events. The conformational changes may take the form of DNA unwinding."
https://openalex.org/W1527247597,"The oxidation of eugenol (4-allyl-2-methoxyphenol) by horseradish peroxidase was studied. Following the initiation of the reaction with hydrogen peroxide, eugenol was oxidized via a one-electron pathway to a phenoxyl radical which subsequently formed a transient, yellow-colored intermediate which was identified as a quinone methide. The eugenol phenoxyl radical was detected using fast-flow electron spin resonance. The radicals and/or quinone methide further reacted to form an insoluble complex polymeric material. The stoichiometry of the disappearance of eugenol versus hydrogen peroxide was approximately 2:1. The addition of glutathione or ascorbate prevented the appearance of the quinone methide and also prevented the disappearance of the parent compound. In the presence of glutathione, a thiyl radical was detected, and increases in oxygen consumption and in the formation of oxidized glutathione were also observed. These results suggested that glutathione reacted with the eugenol phenoxyl radical and reduced it back to the parent compound. Glutathione also reacted directly with the quinone methide resulting in the formation of a eugenol-glutathione conjugate(s). Using 3H-labeled eugenol, extensive covalent binding to protein was observed. Finally, the oxidation products of eugenol/peroxidase were observed to be highly cytotoxic using isolated rat hepatocytes as target cells."
https://openalex.org/W1512390789,"In this paper we examine the effect of the vasodilator peptide bradykinin on endothelial cell regulation of phosphoinositide (PI) turnover. The data show that the activation of PI turnover by bradykinin in bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells is insensitive to pertussis toxin, which ADP ribosylates a membrane protein of mol wt 40,000. However, this effect of bradykinin can be potentiated by guanosine 5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S), an activator of G proteins, and depressed by guanosine 5'-O-(2-thio)diphosphate (GDP beta S), an inhibitor of G proteins. After endothelial cells were preincubated for 1 h with GTP gamma S, there was a three- to fourfold increase in PI turnover. Preincubation of cells with GDP beta S did not affect the basal level of PI turnover, but completely prevented activation of PI turnover by bradykinin. 4 beta-Phorbol-12 beta-myristate-13 alpha-acetate can block the bradykinin-stimulated inositol monophosphate formation in cultured endothelial cells. The effects of bradykinin on PI turnover were blocked by B2 antagonists but not by B1 antagonists. Taken together, these results indicate that in endothelial cells the bradykinin B2 receptor is coupled to phospholipase C via a G protein (or proteins) that is not a substrate for pertussis toxin (neither Gi nor Go)."

https://openalex.org/W1550023054,"Abstract Resonance Raman scattering studies are reported on freshly prepared and aged ferric, ligand-free ferrous, and CO-bound ferrous cytochrome c peroxidase. The ferric form of the fresh enzyme has a heme which is penta-coordinate high spin, independent of buffer over the pH range 4.3-7, as determined by well established Raman marker lines. The aged enzyme displays a mixture of spin and coordination states, but it can be stabilized in the penta-coordinate high spin form in the presence of phosphate. These results can be accounted for by considering the size of the channel (6 A wide, 11 A long) between the distal side of the heme and the outer surface of the protein. A phosphate ion may be accommodated in this channel resulting in the stabilization of the distal heme pocket. The ferrous cytochrome c peroxidase in both the ligand-free and CO-bound states has an acidic and an alkaline form. The acidic form has the characteristic spectral features of peroxidases: a high frequency iron-histidine stretching mode (248 cm-1), a high frequency Fe-CO stretching mode (537 cm-1), and a low frequency C-O stretching mode (1922 cm-1). At alkaline pH these frequencies become similar to those of hemoglobin and myoglobin, with the corresponding modes located at 227, 510, and 1948 cm-1, respectively. We attribute the acid/alkaline transition in the ferrous forms of cytochrome c peroxidase to a rearrangement mainly of the proximal side of the heme, culminating in a change of steric interactions between the proximal histidine and the heme or of the hydrogen bonding network involving the proximal histidine. The new data presented here reconcile many inconsistencies reported in the past."
https://openalex.org/W1535040964,"Abstract The role of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation in the regulation of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase activity was investigated. Incubation of post mitochondrial supernatant with cAMP-dependent protein kinase (50 units) led to an increased (28%) recovery of the cytidylyltransferase in the cytosolic fraction, while incubation with an intestinal alkaline phosphatase (20 units) led to an increased (61%) recovery in the microsomal fraction. When pure cytidylyltransferase was incubated with washed microsomes in the presence of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (133 units), the enzyme associated with the supernatant fraction increased (3.12 +/- 0.02 to 3.77 +/- 0.03 nmol/min/ml) while that of the microsomal fraction decreased (1.36 +/- 0.01 to 0.56 +/- 0.05 nmol/min/ml) by 2.5-fold. The increase in the cytidylyltransferase activity in the supernatant corresponded to an increase in 32P incorporation into the cytidylyltransferase. Treatment with alkaline phosphatase (40 units) decreased the cytidylyltransferase activity in the supernatant (3.61 +/- 0.08 to 2.88 +/- 0.07 nmol/min/ml) while the activity in the microsomal fraction increased (0.56 +/- 0.08 to 1.16 +/- 0.06 nmol/min/ml) by 2-fold. The decrease in the cytidylyltransferase activity in the supernatant corresponded to a decrease in 32P incorporation into the cytidylyltransferase. Incubation of cytidylyltransferase with phosphatidylcholine vesicles in the presence of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (110 units) decreased the cytidylyltransferase activity by 30%. The decrease in cytidylyltransferase activity corresponded to an increase in 32P incorporation into the cytidylyltransferase. Treatment with alkaline phosphatase (20 units) resulted in a 41% increase in the cytidylyltransferase activity. The increase in cytidylyltransferase activity corresponded to a decrease in 32P incorporation into the cytidylyltransferase. Incubation of the cytidylyltransferase with [gamma-32P] ATP and cAMP-dependent protein kinase led to incorporation of 32P into the serine residues of cytidylyltransferase. If the cytidylyltransferase were preincubated with alkaline phosphatase prior to incubation with cAMP-dependent protein kinase, 2-fold more 32P (0.2 mol P/mol cytidylyltransferase) was incorporated into the cytidylyltransferase. Collectively, this data is in agreement with a role for reversible phosphorylation in the regulation of cytidylyltransferase."
https://openalex.org/W1592384650,"Abstract To clarify the roles of superoxide anion (O2.-) and methylene blue in the reductive activation of the heme protein indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, effects of xanthine oxidase-hypoxanthine used at various oxidase concentration levels as an O2.- source and an electron donor on the catalytic activity of the dioxygenase have been examined in the presence and absence of either methylene blue or superoxide dismutase using L- and D-tryptophan as substrates. In the absence of methylene blue, initial rates of the product N-formylkynurenine formation are enhanced in parallel with the xanthine oxidase level up to approximately 100 and approximately 50% of the apparent maximal activity (approximately 2 s-1) for L- and D-Trp, respectively. Superoxide dismutase effectively inhibits the reactions by 80-98% for both isomers. Additions of methylene blue (25 microM) help to maintain the linearity of the product formation that would be rapidly lost a few minutes after the start of the reaction without the dye, especially for L-Trp. Additions of methylene blue also enhance the activity to the maximal level for D-Trp. In the presence of methylene blue, the inhibitory effects of superoxide dismutase are considerably decreased with the increase in xanthine oxidase concentration, and at near maximal dioxygenase activity levels superoxide dismutase is totally without effect. In separate anaerobic experiments leuco-methylene blue, generated either by photoreduction or by ascorbate reduction, is shown to be able to reduce the ferric dioxygenase up to 25-40%. Substrate Trp and heme ligands (CO, n-butyl isocyanide) help to shift a ferric form----ferrous form equilibrium to the right. Thus, under aerobic conditions leuco-methylene blue might similarly be able to reduce the dioxygenase in the presence of an electron donor with the aid of substrate and O2. These results strongly suggest that indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase can be activated through different pathways either by O2.- or by an electron donor-methylene blue system. For the latter case, the dye is acting as an electron mediator from the donor to the ferric dioxygenase."
https://openalex.org/W1506179475,"Abstract G proteins, particularly those sensitive to pertussis toxin, are difficult to separate biochemically, creating uncertainty in functional assignments. For this reason the cDNAs encoding G alpha i-3 and two of the G alpha s splice variants were expressed as fusion proteins in Escherichia coli using a T7 promoter-based expression system. These proteins were denoted r alpha i-3 and r alpha s (short and long) and accumulated in bacteria to as much as 5-10% of total cellular protein, of which 5-10% was soluble in lysates. Soluble r alpha subunits were tested for stimulation of K+ channel activity in inside-out atrial membrane patches and for reconstitution of cyc- adenylyl cyclase activity. r alpha i-3, activated either by guanosine 5'-(3-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) or AlF-4, stimulated in a concentration-dependent manner single channel K+ currents in isolated atrial membrane patches of three species: guinea pigs, neonatal rats, and embryonic chick. In contrast, GTP gamma S-activated r alpha s did not. In agreement with a similar study by Graziano et al. (Graziano, M. P., Casey, P. J. and Gilman, A. G. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 11375-11381), both r alpha s forms reconstituted GTP gamma S-stimulated cyc- adenylyl cyclase activity, albeit at concentrations 50-100 times higher than those needed with native Gs. The concentrations of r alpha i-3 needed to stimulate the K+ channels were also higher than needed with native human erythrocyte Gk, in this case 30-50 times. Single K+ channel currents stimulated by r alpha i-3 were indistinguishable from those stimulated by the natural effector acetylcholine. Thus, bacterial expression of G alpha subunits provided the means to demonstrate unequivocally that Gi-3 has intrinsic Gk activity."
https://openalex.org/W1485108190,"Abstract We have examined the spatial organization of the redox active centers in the Site II segment of the bovine heart respiratory chain by using reconstituted proteoliposomes of ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (Complex III or cytochrome bc1 complex) and EPR techniques. 1) Mutual spin-spin interactions between intrinsic redox active centers were detected. The spin relaxation of the Rieske iron-sulfur cluster was enhanced by the paramagnetic cytochrome c1 and b566 hemes but not by cytochrome b562. 2) Relative distances of the individual redox active centers to the P-side and N-side surfaces of the reconstituted Complex III proteoliposome were measured by our paramagnetic probe method (Blum, H., Bowyer, J. R., Cusanovich, M. A., Waring, A. J., and Ohnishi, T. (1983) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 748, 418-428). The cytochrome b562 heme was shown to be close to the middle of the phospholipid bilayer, while the Rieske iron-sulfur cluster and cytochrome b566 heme were assigned to be near the P-side surface level of the membrane. This probe method is a low resolution technique from the structural viewpoint; however, it can provide direct and reliable assignment of the topographical locations of redox active centers within the membrane. This is the first direct demonstration of the transmembranous location of the two cytochrome b hemes, although electron transfer between these two hemes crosses only half of the membrane thickness. Our data support the assignment of transmembranous distribution of the redox active centers based on electrochromic measurements (Robertson, D.E., and Dutton, P.L. (1988) Biochim, Biophys. Acta 935, 273-291). The implication of these results on the mechanism of Site II energy coupling is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1520362885,"The SecY protein is a membrane-bound factor required for bacterial protein export and embedded in the cytoplasmic membrane by its 10 transmembrane segments. We previously proposed a topology model for this protein by adapting the Manoil-Beckwith TnphoA approach, a genetic method to assign local disposition of a membrane protein from the enzymatic activity of the alkaline phosphatase (PhoA) mature sequence attached to the various regions. SecY-PhoA hybrid proteins with the PhoA domain exported to the periplasmic side of the membrane have been obtained at the five putative periplasmic domains of the SecY sequence. We now extended this method to apply it to follow export of the newly synthesized PhoA domain. Trypsin treatment of detergent-solubilized cell extracts digested the internalized (unfolded) PhoA domain but not those exported and correctly folded. One of the hybrid proteins was cleaved in vivo after export to the periplasm, providing a convenient indication for the export. Results of these analyses indicate that export of the PhoA domain attached to different periplasmic regions of SecY occurs rapidly and requires the normal functioning of the secY gene supplied in trans. Thus, this membrane protein with multiple transmembrane segments contains multiple export signals which can promote rapid and secY-dependent export of the PhoA mature sequence attached to the carboxyl-terminal sides."
https://openalex.org/W1541993086,"The structural organization of the entire human nuclear encoded gene for mitochondrial cytochrome c1 was determined by analyzing a clone obtained from an EMBL3 genomic DNA library. The gene spans 2.4-kilobase pairs and contains seven exons interrupted by six introns of relatively small sizes. All intron/exon splice junctions follow the GT/AG rule. The 5′-flanking region of the gene lacks typical transcriptional regulatory sequence elements such as TATA and CAAT boxes but contains seven putative GC boxes (Sp1 binding sites) and several sequences that resemble another type of the Sp1 responsive element, the enhancer core consensus sequence, the AP-1 responsive element, and the cAMP- and phorbol ester-inducible element. The region also contains a 15-nucleotide sequence highly homologous to the AP-4 consensus sequence and to those in the 5′-flanking regions of the genes for two enzymes associated with respiratory function, the β subunit of human ATP synthase and chicken 5-aminolevulinate synthase. The presequence, which is essential for the transport of the cytochrome c1 precursor into mitochondria, is encoded in both the first and second exons, and the nucleotide sequence corresponding to the presequence is separated by the first intron. This is the first example of a leader sequence coding for a presequence clearly separated into two parts by an intron."
https://openalex.org/W1491876144,"To understand the basis of osteonectin (SPARC) transcriptional regulation, we have isolated a bovine genomic clone (lambda Og15) encoding exon 1 and 15 kilobase pairs (kb) of flanking DNA. Direct RNA sequencing of the 5' end of the osteonectin message showed it contained a sequence identical to that of a 2.4-kb EcoRI-BamHI fragment located midway in the clone lambda Og15. The results indicate exon 1 is located 10 kb away from exon 2 in the bovine genome. The DNA sequence unit CCTG is repeated five times in exon 1 which is composed exclusively of untranslated sequence. Sequence analysis of the 5'-flanking DNA revealed the presence of many regulatory motifs including a box with four overlapping SP1 consensus sequences. Immediately downstream from the GC box is a 72-base pair purine-rich stretch composed primarily of direct repeats of the sequence motifs GGGGA and GGA (GAGA box). Digestion of the flanking DNA in vitro with S1 endonuclease showed a site for the enzyme at position -55 which is just 3' to the GAGA box. Chimeric chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs were prepared containing the S1-sensitive site and showed substantial transcriptional activity in UMR-106 and fetal and adult human bone cells which are known to be high producers of the protein. The results indicate a potential regulatory activity of the S1 site in osteonectin gene activation."
https://openalex.org/W1499196587,"Abstract Aluminum ion perturbs the activity of a number of physiologically important enzymes, including members of a family of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G-proteins). G-proteins couple cellular receptor proteins to a variety of effector enzymes (including adenylate cyclase, phospholipase C, and the rod photoreceptor phosphodiesterase). We show herein that subnanomolar concentrations of free aluminum ion, produced in a carefully defined and kinetically stable manner through the buffering of total aluminum at 0.1-1.0 mM with calculated ratios of chelating agents, inhibit both the receptor-mediated activation and the self-inactivating GTPase activity of the rod photoreceptor G-protein, Gv. In the presence of 4 X 10(-10) M free aluminum ion, GTPase activity is inhibited from about 25-60% as the magnesium ion concentration is reduced from 10(-3) to about 5 X 10(-5) M. The principal effect of aluminum ion upon Gv is to inhibit receptor catalyzed nucleotide exchange. Binding of the GTP analog 5'-guanylyl imidodiphosphate can be reduced by as much as 90% by aluminum ion following subsaturating rhodopsin stimulation. Aluminum ion can produce either competitive or mixed noncompetitive inhibition of rhodopsin-catalyzed Gv activation and GTPase activity, as a function of whether Gv undergoes single (competitive), or multiple (mixed noncompetitive) nucleotide exchanges. The rod photoreceptor phosphodiesterase is only slightly inhibited by similar aluminum ion activities. Light- and Gv-coupled phosphodiesterase activation exhibits both a lower maximum rate of cyclic guanosine monophosphate hydrolysis and a slower inactivation in the presence of aluminum ion activities from about 10(-12) - 10(-10) M. These data suggest that intracellular free aluminum ion concentrations in the subnanomolar range could markedly affect the ability of cells to transduce extracellular signals. Interestingly, the combination of Al3+ and F- to produce the fluoro-aluminate species (AlFx) also inhibits the GTPase of G-proteins, although the mechanism of inhibition (e.g. binding to the G-protein.Mg2+.GDP complex) is totally distinct from that observed for free Al3+ and the overall effect on signal transduction (e.g. enhanced signal amplification) is in complete opposition to that observed for free Al3+."
https://openalex.org/W1581796882,"Abstract The cytotoxic alkaloid, camptothecin, does not inhibit the nicking-closing activity of the wheat germ type I topoisomerase (topo I). However, consistent with a previous report on the Hela cell topo I (Hsiang, Y.-H., Hertzberg, R., Hecht, S., and Liu, L.F. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 14873-14878), the drug does enhance DNA breakage when enzyme reactions are terminated with SDS. Drug-enhanced breakage was observed over the range of salt concentrations where the enzyme is most active (25-200 mM monovalent cation). The presence of the drug did not appear to make the enzyme more processive in the range of salt concentrations from 100 to 170 mM, indicating that it probably does not affect the binding of the enzyme to DNA. Addition of high salt (0.5 M) to enzyme reactions containing camptothecin, prior to the addition of the detergent, prevented some, but not all of the drug-enhanced breakage. This result indicates that the drug causes some permanent, salt-stable nicking of the DNA, an observation that may explain its cytotoxic effects. A comparison of the breakage specificity in the presence of the drug with the consensus sequence for breakage determined previously (Been, M.D., Burgess, R.R., and Champoux, J.J. (1984) Nucleic Acids Res. 12, 3097-3114) indicated that the drug has a minimal effect on the sequence specificity of the enzyme. However, the drug enhanced breakage at different sites to quite different extents. Therefore, camptothecin should be useful for localizing topo I break sites in vivo, but quantitative comparisons on the relative frequencies of breakage at different locations should be avoided."
https://openalex.org/W1538664873,"Abstract The mechanism of inhibition of two forms of human neutrophil collagenase (HNC) by six Au(I) compounds, some of which are used as chrysotherapeutic agents, has been investigated. The two forms of enzyme studied are active and latent HNC, the latter of which is activated by p-chloromercuribenzoate (PCMB). The effects of PCMB and Zn(II), which are normally included in the assays, on the activity of both forms of HNC and on their inhibition by these Au(I) compounds have also been studied. Zn(II) stimulates the activity of both the active and PCMB-activated latent forms of HNC up to a concentration of 50-100 microM, after which it inhibits markedly. PCMB activates latent HNC up to a concentration of 100 microM followed by inhibition at higher concentrations. Active HNC is not stimulated at PCMB concentrations below 100 microM, but is inhibited at higher concentrations. The stimulatory effects of Zn(II) and PCMB on HNC and its inhibition by PCMB are all attributable to binding at distinct sites. The inhibition of both active and PCMB-activated latent HNC by the Au(I) compounds is noncompetitive and is reversed by Zn(II). The inhibition of both forms of HNC by SKF 80544 and SKF 36914, which do not contain thiol ligands, is weak to moderate and is not influenced by the PCMB concentration. In contrast, PCMB markedly enhances the inhibition by Myocrisin, Sanocrisin, and Solganol by complexing to their thiol ligands to facilitate release of the Au(I) atom for binding to HNC. Cd(II) and Cu(II) also inhibit HNC noncompetitively, and inhibition is also reversed by Zn(II). Collectively, these data indicate that latent HNC contains a heavy metal binding site distinct from the active site at which Au(I), Cd(II), and Cu(II) bind to cause noncompetitive inhibition. Occupancy of this site by Zn(II) is characterized by retention of activity."
https://openalex.org/W1508691110,"Abstract Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is synthesized by the liver and many peripheral cells. Rat ovarian granulosa cells synthesize and secrete apoE, and this apoE production is increased by agents that increase cellular cAMP. In these studies of granulosa cell apoE synthesis we have examined the effect of agents that stimulate various cell kinases, including protein kinases A, G, and C. The cell content of apoE mRNA was measured simultaneously. Cholera toxin (1.25 micrograms/ml), dibutyryl-cAMP (5 mg/ml), and forskolin (10(-4) M), all of which increase cellular cAMP, stimulate apoE accumulation in the medium 7-10-fold. On the other hand, dibutyryl-cGMP (20 mg/ml) has no effect on apoE synthesis or secretion. The phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (100 ng/ml), a protein kinase C stimulator, increases apoE accumulation in the medium 8-10-fold, while 4 alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate, the inactive phorbol congener, has no such effect. The cAMP effect on apoE synthesis by granulosa cells is maximal at 48 h, while the phorbol ester effect is maximal at 72-96 h in culture. The data indicate that agents whose effects are mediated by activation of protein kinases A and C, but not G, stimulate granulosa cell apoE production. These effects on the amount of secreted apoE are temporally preceded by increases in the granulosa cell content of apoE messenger RNA. Together, these data suggest that the regulation of apoE production in the rat ovarian granulosa cell could involve transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1572025105,"Proline 17 in the glycine-rich region of adenylate kinase was replaced by Gly (the Gly-mutant) or Val (the Val-mutant) by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutant enzymes were purified to homogeneous states on sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis after solubilization of the proteins from the pellets of cell lysates of Escherichia coli. The apparent Km values of the Gly- and the Val-mutants for AMP increased approximately 7- and 24-fold, respectively, as compared with that of the wild-type enzyme. The apparent Km values for ATP also increased 7- and 42-fold in the Gly- and Val-mutants, respectively. In contrast, Vmax values of both mutant enzymes were comparable to that of the wild-type enzyme. These results suggest that Pro-17 plays an important role for the binding of substrates, but not for catalytic efficiency, although it does not directly interact with substrates. Adenosine diphosphopyridoxal, which specifically modifies Lys-21 in adenylate kinase (Tagaya, M., Yagami, T., and Fukui, T. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 8257-8261), inactivated the wild-type and mutant enzymes at almost the same rates. Interestingly, both mutant enzymes showed higher specificities for adenine nucleotides than the wild-type enzyme. Both mutant enzymes were less resistant than the wild-type enzyme against inactivation at elevated temperatures or by treatment with trypsin. It would appear that most of the properties of the mutant enzymes may be explained on the basis of a need for conformational flexibility of the loop which includes Pro-17 for substrate binding."
https://openalex.org/W1612413185,"The mitochondrial DNA of trypanosomes, kinetoplast DNA, is a network containing thousands of topologically interlocked minicircles. Minicircles are replicated as free molecules after being detached from the network. The minicircle L strand appears to be synthesized continuously and the H strand discontinuously. This paper describes properties of Trypanosoma equiperdum minicircle H strand fragments which could be Okazaki fragments. These fragments constitute a family of molecules of discrete sizes (ranging from about 70 to 1000 nucleotides) which map to specific locations. Three of the most prominent fragments, a 73-mer, 83-mer, and 138-mer, map at contiguous or overlapping sites. Based on their position relative to the initiation site for L strand synthesis, the 73-mer may be the first Okazaki fragment to be synthesized and either the 83-mer or the 138-mer may be the second. The 5' end of the 73-mer lies within a sequence, GGGCGT, found at a similar location in minicircles of all trypanosomatid species. During the maturation of free minicircles and after their reattachment to the networks there appears to be continued extension and ligation of the H strand fragments. However, the ligation of the 73-mer, 83-mer, and 138-mer to the rest of the H strand is delayed; their eventual ligation results in covalent closure of the minicircles."
https://openalex.org/W1550453838,"Abstract A specific stimulation of tubulin tyrosinolation in human neutrophils (PMNs) is induced by the synthetic peptide chemoattractant N-formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine (fMet-Leu-Phe), and this stimulation is closely associated with activation of the NADPH oxidase-mediated respiratory burst (Nath, J., and Gallin, J. I. (1983) J. Clin. Invest. 71, 1273-1281). In contrast, along with tubulin tyrosinolation, a distinctly different respiratory burst-associated random posttranslational incorporation of tyrosine into multiple PMN proteins is observed in PMNs stimulated with the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or sn-1,2-dioctanoylglycerol (DAG). In studies exploring the mechanism(s) of signal transduction for these distinct neutrophil responses, we found that the fMet-Leu-Phe-induced stimulation of tubulin tyrosinolation in PMNs and in differentiated HL-60 cells is completely blocked by pertussis toxin, while the PMA-induced random incorporation of tyrosine is not inhibited. We also found that expression of the fMet-Leu-Phe-mediated stimulation of tubulin tyrosinolation in HL-60 cells is correlated with increases in the specific activity of protein kinase C and with the acquisition of respiratory burst activity which occur during induced myeloid maturation of these cells. Furthermore, both the fMet-Leu-Phe-induced stimulation of tubulin tyrosinolation and the PMA or DAG-induced random posttranslational incorporation of tyrosine into multiple proteins in activated neutrophils, were found to be reversibly inhibited (greater than 70%) by the protein kinase inhibitors 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)piperazine (C-I) and 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H-7), in parallel with inhibition of superoxide (O2-) generation. In related studies, we also found that fMet-Leu-Phe-stimulated O2- production is comparably inhibited by C-I and H-7, but in a highly temperature-dependent manner. Inhibition was observed only when C-I or H-7 is added to PMNs at physiologic temperature, i.e. 37 degrees C. Interestingly, inhibition of the PMA-induced O2- generation by C-I or H-7 was not found to be similarly temperature-dependent. Considered together, these findings argue against the suggestion that there is a protein kinase C-independent pathway for activation of the respiratory burst in neutrophils stimulated with N-formyl peptides."
https://openalex.org/W1591584330,"Abstract The 2 cysteine residues present in the A subunit of pertussis toxin form a disulfide bond in the conformation of the toxin secreted from the bacteria. Previous studies have shown that reduction of this bond is necessary for activation of the enzyme. We have found that reduction of this bond also alters the conformation of the A subunit such that it no longer readily associates with the B oligomer of the toxin, a finding which may have implications concerning the form of the toxin found within the eukaryotic cell. In addition, we have demonstrated that reduction of the disulfide bond of the purified A subunit followed by treatment with sulfhydryl-modifying reagents such as N-ethylmaleimide or 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) results in inhibition of the NAD glycohydrolase activity of the protein. When a tryptic fragment of the A subunit which contains only 1 of the cysteine residues (Cys-41) of the native protein was reacted with N-ethylmaleimide, the NAD glycohydrolase activity of this fragment was substantially reduced. These data indicate that Cys-41 may be in a region of the molecule which is critical for the enzymatic activity of the toxin."
https://openalex.org/W1597596967,"Abstract The aim of this study was to identify and purify the Na+-H+ exchanger from rabbit renal brush border membranes by use of affinity chromatography. Triton-solubilized membranes were equilibrated with an affinity matrix consisting of the amiloride analogue A35 (5-N-(3-aminophenyl)amiloride) covalently coupled to Sepharose CL-4B beads through a triglycine spacer arm. The matrix was then washed extensively with buffer and sequentially eluted with buffer, buffer containing 5 mM amiloride, and 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Eluates were concentrated and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The silver-stained gel revealed a 25-kDa protein that was not visible in the initial solubilized brush border membrane extract, was not eluted from the affinity matrix by buffer alone, but was eluted with 5 mM amiloride. A subsequent elution with 1% SDS did not release any more of the 25-kDa protein, indicating that it had been completely eluted from the affinity matrix by amiloride. The presence of 5 mM amiloride during equilibration of the solubilized brush border extract with the affinity matrix completely blocked adsorption of the 25-kDa protein. The relative abundance of this protein correlated closely with Na+-H+ exchange activity when preparations of cortical brush border membrane vesicles, outer medullary brush border membrane vesicles, and cortical basolateral membrane vesicles were compared. Moreover, binding of the protein to the affinity matrix was inhibited by amiloride and amiloride analogues with a rank order identical to that for inhibition of Na+-H+ exchange activity. These findings strongly suggest that the 25-kDa protein is a structural component of the Na+-H+ exchanger."
https://openalex.org/W1592495390,"We are interested in developing methods to rigorously characterize the intrinsic enzymatic activity of the insulin receptor. We have previously shown that the intact, kinase active form of the receptor can be separated from inactive forms isolated from human placenta. Therefore, the determination of kinase activity, when normalized to the number of receptors based on binding, is not complicated by the presence of insulin receptor forms which bind insulin normally, but are kinase inactive. We now have extended this separation technique to insulin receptor preparations from rat liver. Thus, the determination and comparison of the intrinsic kinase activity of insulin receptor from human placenta and rat liver was performed. When normalized to the same number of insulin receptors which are autophosphorylated to the same degree, the rat liver insulin receptor catalyzes the transfer of phosphate from ATP to three different substrates, on average, 2.8-fold quicker than receptor from human placenta. This probably represents an inherent difference in the intrinsic kinase activity (Vmax), since the values for Km of the substrates are essentially identical, for insulin receptors from both sources. Intrinsic kinase differences may reflect different biological roles and/or differential regulation by exogenous factors. We are now examining this hypothesis in light of reports that demonstrate regulation of intrinsic kinase activity of the insulin receptor in certain physiological and pathological states."
https://openalex.org/W1517450868,"Abstract To investigate the inhibitory action and binding site of a quinone-like molecule, 5-undecyl-6-hydroxy-4,7-dioxobenzothiazole (UHDBT), a series of 4,7-dioxobenzothiazole derivatives were synthesized and their inhibitory efficiencies studied. Replacing the 6-hydroxyl or 2-hydrogen of UHDBT with a bromo or a methoxy group causes only a slight decrease in inhibitory efficiency, indicating that the 6-hydroxyl or the 2-hydrogen of UHDBT is not a structural requirement for inhibition. 5-Undecyl-6-bromo (or methoxy)-4,7-dioxobenzothiazole shows a pH-dependent inhibition similar to that observed with UHDBT, suggesting that the pH dependence is due to the presence of a dissociable group in the protein complex and not to the deprotonation of the hydroxyl group of the inhibitor. Replacing the 6-hydroxyl group with an azido group causes changes similar to those observed with UHDBT; the inhibition is accompanied by alteration of the epr characteristics of reduced iron-sulfur protein in ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase. The extent of inhibition is not changed upon illumination of the treated reductase. When the photolyzed, 6-azido-5-(1',2'-[3H] undecyl)-4,7-dioxobenzothiazole [( 3H]6-azido-UDBT)-treated reductase is subjected to organic solvent extraction, no radioactivity is found in the reductase protein. Rather, the radioactivity is located in the phospholipid fraction. A [3H]azido-UDBT-cardiolipin adduct, identified after separation of the phospholipid fraction by high performance liquid chromatography, has 6-azido-UDBT linked to an acyl group, not to the head group of the cardiolipin molecule. These results suggest that inhibition by UHDBT is due to perturbation of specific cardiolipin molecules in ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase. Since UHDBT and 6-azido-UDBT also inhibit the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activity of delipidated reductase (10% of the original lipid remaining) assayed after reconstitution with ubiquinone and phospholipid, and the [3H]azido-UDBT-cardiolipin adduct is also found in the delipidated reductase, the UHDBT-perturbed cardiolipin molecule is structurally indispensable to reductase and it tightly bound to the reductase protein, most likely the quinone binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1489747309,"A monoclonal antibody, 7B3, specific to the alpha subunit of the mitochondrial ATPase-ATP synthase inhibited the rate of ATP hydrolysis by either soluble F1 or electron transport particles up to a maximum of 75%. However, 7B3 did not modify the rate of ITP hydrolysis. In addition, the apparent Km for MgATP extrapolated at high ATP concentrations had the same value in the absence as in the presence of 7B3. The antibody did not change the inactivation rate of F1-ATPase induced by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or 4-chloro-7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole. These observations indicate that 7B3 did not directly interfere with the catalytic sites of ATP or ITP hydrolysis. On the contrary, 7B3 modified the interaction between nucleotide sites and therefore the regulation of the rate of ATP hydrolysis. Indeed, 7B3 changed into a positive cooperativity the negative cooperativity observed when measuring the rate of ATP hydrolysis as a function of ATP concentration. 7B3 also increased the binding of ADP to F1. 7B3 prevented the rapid phase of inactivation of F1 by 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine. This phase has been correlated to the binding of 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine to regulatory sites (Di Pietro, A., Godinot, C., Martin, J. C., and Gautheron, D. C. (1979) Biochemistry 18, 1738-1745). The inhibition of ATP hydrolysis is concomitant with the binding of 1 mol of IgG or of 2 mol of Fab fragments per mol of F1. However, by further increasing the ratio Fab/F1, only 1 mol of Fab remained bound to F1 without change in inhibition of ATPase activity. All these experiments strongly support the suggestion that F1 conformational changes occurring upon binding of 7B3 to alpha subunit induce a modification of interactions between nucleotide sites. This modification would be consecutive to a change in the normal interaction between the alpha and beta subunits which is required to observe an active rate of ATP hydrolysis or synthesis. In conclusion, the use of this monoclonal antibody demonstrates for the first time in mammalian F1 the role of the conformation of the alpha subunit in the regulation of the ATPase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1535782504,"Purified calcineurin phosphatase is converted upon incubation in millimolar Ni2+ or Mn2+ to an active form by association with these metal activators. The bound metal ion is not dissociable from calcineurin by dialysis or gel filtration, but can be released upon prolonged incubation of the enzyme with Ca2+/calmodulin or chelating agents (Pallen, C. J., and Wang, J. H. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 16115–16120). The present study has been undertaken to test the possibility that calcineurin in brain may contain tightly bound Ni2+ or Mn2+. A monoclonal antibody (VA1) immunoaffinity matrix was prepared and shown to affect specific precipitation of calcineurin from crude bovine brain extract. Using [3H]-, [63Ni2+]-, and [54Mn2+]calcineurin added to the extract as radioactive tracer, it was found that up to 80% of the calcineurin could be immunoprecipitated, and that more than 50% of the originally bound metal ions could be detected in the immunoprecipitate. When samples of calcineurin immunoprecipitated from brain extracts were analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy, Ni2+ and Mn2+ were not detected, whereas, Zn2+, a constitutive metal of calcineurin (King, M. M., and Huang, C. Y. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 8847–8856) was found in the expected amount. The result suggests that calcineurin in brain does not contain tightly associated Ni2+ or Mn2+."
https://openalex.org/W1529257585,"Abstract Triton X-100 extracts of purified rat brain synaptosomes exhibited marked phosphorylation of an endogenous Mr 87,000 polypeptide following chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. The protein kinase catalyzing this reaction was insensitive to cyclic AMP, Ca2+, calmodulin, and phorbol esters. However, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PIP) proved to be a potent inhibitor of the Mr 87,000 polypeptide phosphorylation at submicromolar concentrations, whereas phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylglycerol were less potent inhibitors. Unsaturated fatty acids could also mimic the effects of PIP at levels above 4 micrograms/ml. The inhibitory effect of PIP largely reflected a profound increase in the apparent Km for Mg2+ such that increasing Mg2+ levels could partially offset the action of PIP. The PIP-sensitive protein kinase was enriched in hypotonic lysates of synaptosomes from which it was partially purified by DEAE-cellulose, hydroxylapatite, and gel permeation chromatography. This purification separated the enzyme from its Mr 87,000 substrate; however, the presence of this polypeptide in heat-inactivated alkali extracts of rat brain provided an exogenous source of substrate which could be used to assay enzyme activity. The relevance of these data to a possible role for PIP and Mg2+ in cellular signaling is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1509118733,"Abstract A 58-kDa protein is found in microvilli and in actin-containing transmembrane complexes of 13762 ascites tumor cells with immobile surface receptors; it is absent from sublines with mobile receptors. 58-kDa protein has been proposed to stabilize microvilli and restrict receptor mobility by stabilizing membrane-microfilament interactions. Antibodies against 58-kDa protein were blot-purified from antisera of rabbits injected with crude transmembrane complex and were used to monitor purification of the protein. 58-kDa protein was extracted from EDTA/EGTA-stripped microvillar microfilament cores with 1 M NaCl. A single depolymerization-polymerization cycle of the microfilaments, followed by solubilization of 58-kDa protein in 1 M NaCl and chromatography on hydroxyapatite-Sephadex G-150, purified the protein to greater than 95% homogeneity. The native molecular weight and frictional coefficient indicated a monomeric, asymmetric structure. 58-kDa protein bound F-actin in pelleting assays and inhibited polymerization of pyrenyl-actin. It also bound phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylcholine vesicles in pelleting studies. Immunoblot analyses of endogenously and exogenously proteolyzed microvilli and their membranes and microfilament cores showed specific membrane and microfilament binding fragments of 28-30 kDa. The microfilament- and phospholipid-binding properties of 58-kDa protein and the localization of its proteolysis products are consistent with its proposed role in stabilizing membrane-microfilament interactions in the ascites cell microvilli."
