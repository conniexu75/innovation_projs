https://openalex.org/W1607207125,"To clone the CD63 antigen, originally described as a blood platelet activation marker, we adapted the expression cloning procedure of Seed and Aruffo (Seed, B., and Aruffo, A. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S. A. 84, 3365-3369) to allow cloning of intracellular antigens. A megakaryocyte expression cDNA library was transiently transfected into MOP-8 mouse fibroblasts cultured on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Individual cells expressing intracellular CD63 were identified by autoradiography. cDNA was extracted from positive spots and reintroduced into Escherichia coli. After two screening rounds, a CD63 cDNA clone was isolated as assessed by immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis. The single long open reading frame of 238 amino acids contained four putative transmembrane regions and three N-glycosylation sites. The CD63 gene was expressed in a wide variety of cells. Surprisingly, CD63 was identical to ME491, an antigen reported as a melanoma-associated antigen (Hotta, H., Ross, A. H., Huebner, K., Isobe, M., Wendeborn, S., Chao, M. V., Ricciardi, R. P., Tsujimoto, Y., Croce, C. M., and Koprowski, H. (1988) Cancer Res. 48, 2955-2962). By immunoelectron microscopy, co-localization with the lysosomal glycoproteins lamp-1 and -2 identified CD63 as a novel lysosomal membrane glycoprotein. CD63 was not related to the lysosomal glycoprotein family but contained the putative lysosomal targeting signal Gly-Tyr in its short cytoplasmic tail."
https://openalex.org/W1569389754,"A general repair process for DNA heteroduplexes has been detected in HeLa cell extracts. Using a variety of M13mp2 DNA substrates containing single-base mismatches and extra nucleotides, extensive repair is observed after incubation with HeLa cell cytoplasmic extracts and subsequent transfection of bacterial cells with the treated DNA. Most, but not all, mispairs as well as two frameshift heteroduplexes are repaired efficiently. Parallel measurements of repair in HeLa extracts and in Escherichia coli suggest that repair specificities are similar for the two systems. The presence of a nick in the molecule is required for efficient repair in HeLa cell extracts, and the strand containing the nick is the predominantly repaired strand. Mismatch-dependent DNA synthesis is observed when radiolabeled restriction fragments, produced by reaction of the extract with heteroduplex and homoduplex molecules, are compared. Specific labeling of fragments, representing a region of approximately 1,000 base pairs and containing the nick and the mismatch, is detected for the heteroduplex substrate but not the homoduplex. The repair reaction is complete after 20 min and requires added Mg2+, ATP, and an ATP-regenerating system, but not dNTPs, which are present at sufficient levels in the extract. An inhibitor of DNA polymerase beta, dideoxythimidine 5'-triphosphate, does not inhibit mismatch-specific DNA synthesis. Aphidicolin, an inhibitor of DNA polymerases alpha, delta, and epsilom, inhibits both semiconservative replication and repair synthesis in the extract. Butylphenyl-dGTP also inhibits both replicative and repair synthesis but at a concentration known to inhibit DNA polymerase alpha preferentially rather than delta or epsilon. This suggests that DNA polymerase alpha may function in mismatch repair."
https://openalex.org/W1603224226,"Adult rabbit smooth muscles contain two types of myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms, SM1 and SM2 which are generated through alternative RNA splicing from a single gene (Nagai, R., Kuro-o, M., Babij, P. & Periasamy, M. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 9734-9737). We previously reported that the expression of SM1 and SM2 during vascular development is differentially regulated at the level of RNA splicing, whereby SM1 is constitutively expressed from early development but SM2 appear after birth (Kuro-o, M., Nagai, R., Tsuchimochi, H., Katoh, H., Yazaki, Y., Ohkubo, A. & Takaku, F. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 18272-18275). We also demonstrated that embryonic vascular smooth muscles contain a third type of MHC isoform, referred to as SMemb in this report, which comigrates on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with SM2. In the present study we have isolated and characterized a cDNA clone (FSMHC34) for SMemb. FSMHC34 encodes the light meromyosin region including the carboxyl terminus and showed 70% amino acid sequence identity with SM1 or SM2. SMemb is a nonmuscle-type MHC and identical with brain MHC, but clearly distinct from 196-kDa nonmuscle MHC in cultured smooth muscle cells. The expression of SMemb was predominant in embryonic and perinatal aortas, but down-regulated with vascular development. Interestingly SMemb was reexpressed in proliferating smooth muscle cells of arteriosclerotic neointimas. These results suggest that smooth muscle proliferation is coupled to the expression of SMemb and that dedifferentiation of smooth muscles toward the embryonic phenotype is involved in the mechanisms underlying atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W1600065401,"Abstract Cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the bile acid biosynthetic pathway. Regulation of this pathway is thought to occur solely as a result of a negative feedback control mechanism that is dependent upon the flux and composition of bile salts undergoing enterohepatic circulation. We have used the chronic biliary diverted (CBD) rat model to study the mechanism of regulation of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase by taurocholate. As compared to nonoperated controls, CBD rats exhibited a 4.2-fold increase in cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase-specific activity, a 4.5-fold increase in enzyme mass, a 10-fold increase in steady-state mRNA levels, and a 3.4-fold increase in transcriptional (nuclear run-on) activity. Intraduodenal infusion of taurocholate at a rate of 36 mumol/100 g/h for 48 h in CBD rats caused a significant (p less than 0.05) decrease (64%) in cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase-specific activity, mass (72%), steady-state mRNA levels (74%), and transcriptional activity (57%) as compared to CBD controls. Cholesterol feeding increased cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase-specific activity (288%), poly(A) RNA levels (291%), and transcriptional activity (220%) as compared to control animals. These results provide convincing evidence that bile salts, either directly or indirectly, down-regulate in vivo transcription of the cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase gene, which is probably the major mechanism regulating the levels of this enzyme. The results of this study also suggest that the promoter for cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase may have both bile salt- and sterol-responsive elements."
https://openalex.org/W1505276365,"In this work, we used two approaches to localize the 90-kDa heat shock protein (hsp90)-binding site within the hormone-binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor. In the first approach, derivatives of the glucocorticoid receptor deleted for increasing portions of the COOH terminus were translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and the [35S]methionine-labeled translation products were immunoadsorbed with the 8D3 monoclonal antibody against hsp90. The data suggest that a segment from amino acids 604 to 659 (mouse) of the receptor is required for hsp90 binding. We have recently shown that the internal deletion mutant of the mouse receptor (delta 574-632) binds hsp90, although the complex is somewhat unstable (Housley, P. R., Sanchez, E. R., Danielsen, M., Ringold, G. M., and Pratt, W. B. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 12778-12781). The two observations indicate that amino acids 574-659 are involved in forming a stable receptor-hsp90 complex and that region 632-659 is especially important. To test this hypothesis directly, we synthesized three peptides corresponding to segments in region 624-665 and three peptides spanning the highly conserved sequence at amino acids 582-617, and we then tested the ability of the peptides to compete for the association of hsp90 with the L cell glucocorticoid receptor. In this assay, the immunopurified hsp90-free mouse receptor is incubated with rabbit reticulocyte lysate, which directs the association of rabbit hsp90 with the mouse receptor, simultaneously converting the receptor to the steroid binding state. All three peptides spanning region 624-665 and a peptide corresponding to segment 587-606 inhibited both hsp90 association with the receptor and reconstitution of steroid binding capacity. The data from all of the approaches support a two-site model for the hsp90-binding site in which the critical contact site occurs in region 632-659, which contains a short proline-containing hydrophobic segment and adjacent dipole-plus-cysteine motif that are conserved among all of the hsp90-binding receptors in the superfamily. A second hsp90 contact site is predicted in region 574-632, which contains the only highly conserved amino acid sequence in the receptor superfamily outside of the DNA-binding domain."
https://openalex.org/W1626408496,"We examined the relationship between the size of human apolipoprotein (apo) B and the formation and secretion of apoB-containing lipoprotein particles. Stable transformants of the rat hepatoma cell line McA-RH7777 harboring a variety of human apoB cDNA constructs were established, and these produced carboxyl-terminally truncated apoB proteins (apoB18, -B23, -B28, -B31, -B48, and -B53). Immunoblotting of apoB proteins secreted into the culture medium and fractionated by equilibrium density ultracentrifugation revealed that each of the truncated apoB species was secreted from the cells. The peak densities of the apoB-containing particles decreased as the length of the apoB proteins increased. Apolipoproteins B18 and B23 appeared at the bottom of the salt gradient (d = 1.23 g/ml), whereas particles containing apoB28, -B31, -B37, -B48, and -B53 exhibited progressive decreases in density. The density distribution of secreted apolipoproteins was not affected by the expression or secretion of these recombinant apoB species. As determined by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis, apoB28, -B31, -B37, -B48, and -B53 formed their own discrete particles, and there was a direct correlation between the size of the particles and the length of the apoB species. The efficiency and rate of secretion of these truncated forms of apoB were studied by measuring the decrease of immunoprecipitated 35S-labeled apoB proteins in the cells and their accumulation in the medium. Proteins corresponding to apoB28 or larger were rapidly and efficiently secreted, whereas apoB18 and apoB23 were secreted much more slowly. These data imply that the size of these truncated apoB forms governs the lipid content of the apoB-containing lipoproteins formed as well as the kinetics of secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1588550310,"Sites phosphorylated by casein kinase I have been characterized by the presence of acidic amino acids NH2-terminal to the modified residue. Recently, phosphoserine was shown to be a particularly effective determinant for casein kinase I action when present in the motif -S(P)-X-X-S- (Flotow, H., Graves, P. R., Wang, A., Fiol, C. J., Roeske, R. W., and Roach, P. J. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 14264-14269). Nonetheless, nonphosphorylated substrates for casein kinase I are well documented. In this study, we examined the efficacy of Asp and Glu residues as determinants of casein kinase I action using synthetic peptide substrates. Peptides with runs of Asp residues in the motif Dn-X-X-S- were substrates for casein kinase I. Peptides with n = 3 or 4 were the most effective substrates, much better than n = 2. The peptide with n = 1, a single Asp residue, was a very poor substrate. A block of 4 Glu residues was a little less effective as a substrate determinant than 4 Asp residues in an otherwise identical peptide. The most effective substrate, with the motif -D-D-D-D-X-X-S-, was specific for casein kinase I and was not detectably phosphorylated by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, casein kinase II, glycogen synthase kinase 3, or phosphorylase kinase and thus will be useful for the specific assay of casein kinase I. This peptide was nonetheless significantly worse as a substrate than peptides in which casein kinase I action was determined by phosphoserine in the -3 position. Still, the fact that Asp or Glu residues can specify a casein kinase I substrate suggests that acidic character has a role in substrate selection by this protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1502445277,"The thyroid plasma membrane contains a Ca2(+)-regulated NADPH-dependent H2O2 generating system which provides H2O2 for the thyroid peroxidase-catalyzed biosynthesis of thyroid hormones. The plasma membrane fraction contains a Ca2(+)-independent cytochrome c reductase activity which is not inhibited by superoxide dismutase. But it is not known whether H2O2 is produced directly from molecular oxygen (O2) or formed via dismutation of super-oxide anion (O2-). Indirect evidence from electron scavenger studies indicate that the H2O2 generating system does not liberate O2-, but studies using the modified peroxidase, diacetyldeuteroheme horseradish peroxidase, to detect O2- indicate that H2O2 is provided via the dismutation of O2-. The present results provide indirect evidence that the cytochrome c reductase activity is not a component of the NADPH-dependent H2O2 generator, since it was removed by washing the plasma membranes with 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid without affecting H2O2 generation. Spectral studies with diacetyldeuteroheme-substituted horseradish peroxidase showed that the thyroid NADPH-dependent H2O2 generator does not catalyze superoxide anion formation. The O2- adduct compound (compound III) was formed but was completely inhibited by catalase, indicating that the initial product was H2O2. The rate of NADPH oxidation also increased in the presence of diacetylheme peroxidase. This increase was blocked by catalase and was greatly enhanced by superoxide dismutase. The O2- adduct compound (compound III) was produced in the presence of NADPH when glucose-glucose oxidase (which does not produce O2-) was used as the H2O2 generator. NADPH oxidation occurred simultaneously and was enhanced by superoxide dismutase. We conclude that O2- formation occurs in the presence of an H2O2 generator, diacetylheme peroxidase and NADPH, but that it is not the primary product of the H2O2 generator. We suggest that O2- formation results from oxidation of NADPH, catalyzed by the diacetylheme peroxidase compound I, producing NADP degree, which in turn reacts with O2 to give O2-."
https://openalex.org/W1608904060,"A comparison of the three-dimensional structures of the flavin mononucleotide (FMN)-dependent enzymes glycolate oxidase, flavocytochrome b2, and trimethylamine dehydrogenase is presented. Their flavin-binding domains all have the same structural motif, the 8-fold beta/alpha-barrel domain, which is also present in a large number of other enzymes. FMN is bound in a similar fashion in all three enzymes. The binding site is at the carboxyl-terminal end of the eight beta-strands of the barrel where the active site is invariably found in this type of domain structure. The similarity of the structures of glycolate oxidase and flavocytochrome b2 extends to the loop regions and even outside the beta/alpha-barrels with a root mean square deviation of 0.93 A for 311 superimposed C alpha-atoms and with a sequence identity of 37%. A detailed analysis of their active sites shows, however, that the orientation of FMN is significantly different in the two structures due to different conformations of residues in the end of strand one. Thus, in flavocytochrome b2 a hydrogen bond is formed between the FMN N-5 position and the main chain amide of Ala-198, while in glycolate oxidase, the ring system is tilted away from the strand, creating a pocket on the re-side of the FMN ring where a water molecule is bound. Model building shows that this site could accommodate the hydroperoxide moiety of a FMN-4a-hydroperoxide intermediate. Thus, in the course of evolution, a few mutations in, and close to, the active sites have fine tuned these enzymes to exert their specific functions as an oxidase or transferase, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1589100504,"Diacylglycerols (DAGs) derived from phosphatidylcholine (PC) hydrolysis have been shown to activate protein kinase C (PKC) in vitro, but it is not known whether this event occurs in response to DAGs generated via agonist-induced PC hydrolysis in intact cells. In this report we have addressed this question directly, using alpha-thrombin stimulation of IIC9 fibroblasts. PKC activation in intact cells was assessed in two ways, by measuring: 1) PKC membrane association as determined by kinase activity and Western blot analysis and 2) the phosphorylation of an endogenous PKC substrate, an 80-kDa protein. Treatment with 500 ng/ml alpha-thrombin has been shown to stimulate both phosphoinositide and PC hydrolysis, whereas treatment with 100 pg/ml alpha-thrombin stimulates only PC breakdown. Using these two conditions, we show that DAG produced from phosphoinositide, but not PC hydrolysis, is associated with the activation of PKC."
https://openalex.org/W1494998770,"Abstract The altered calcium binding activity of calmodulins (CaM) with point mutations can be restored toward that of wild type CaMs by the formation of a complex between CaM and a CaM binding sequence. Three different site-specific mutations resulted in selective effects on the apparent stoichiometry and affinity of CaM for calcium, with maintenance of the ability to activate myosin light chain kinase. The effects on calcium binding, however, were suppressed when the mutant CaMs were complexed with RS20, a peptide analog of a myosin light chain kinase CaM binding site. The mutations included: 1) a Glu----Ala mutation at two phylogenetically conserved calcium ligands in the second (E67A-CaM) and fourth (E140A-CaM) sites; and 2) a Ser----Phe mutation at residue 101 (S101F-CaM) which affects ion channel regulation. The mutant CaMs bind 4 calciums in the absence of magnesium, but two sites have approximately 60- to 300-fold weaker binding than wild-type CaM (SYNCAM CaM). E67A-CaM and E140A-CaM bound only two calciums and S101F-CaM bound 4 calciums in the presence of magnesium. E67A-CaM and E140A-CaM recovered the ability to bind 4 calcium ions in the presence of the RS20 CaM binding peptide. These results are consistent with models in which the calcium binding activity of CaM within a supramolecular complex is different from purified CaM and raise the possibility that the selective functional effects of in vivo mutations in the calcium binding sites of CaM might be partially due to the ability of some CaM binding proteins to select and utilize CaM conformations with calcium ligation structures different from the so-called canonical EF-hand."
https://openalex.org/W1617868157,"Transcription of the chicken cardiac troponin T (cTNT) gene in myocardial cells requires upstream sequences not required for expression of this gene in embryonic skeletal muscle cells. Deletion analysis shows that the segment between nucleotides -247 and -201 (numbered relative to the transcription initiation site at +1) is capable of conferring cardiac specific expression to a cTNT promoter. The cardiac element within this segment contains at least two essential subregions: one residing upstream of position -215, which bears no homologies to known transcription elements, and an A/T-rich segment residing between positions -215 and -201. Conserved M-CAT motifs within the cTNT minimal promoter which are required for activity in skeletal muscle cells are also required for activity in myocardial cells, suggesting an interaction between the upstream cardiac element and proximal promoter elements. Gel-shift experiments demonstrate interaction between the upstream portion of the cardiac element and factor(s) present in the nuclei of cardiac and non-cardiac tissues. Thus, additional cis and trans factors are required for transcription of the cTNT gene in myocardial cells which are not required for expression in skeletal muscle cells."
https://openalex.org/W1673406890,"We synthesized several para-aminophenyl (pap-) mannose-terminated albumins with varying sugar density (Man7-HSA, Man22-HSA, and Man40-HSA) and compared hepatic uptake with (thio-)mannose-terminated bovine serum albumin (Man-43-AI-BSA) The rate of uptake in isolated perfused rat livers was found to be positively correlated with the sugar density (Man40-HSA = Man22-HSA greater than Man7-HSA greater than HSA). Immunohistochemical staining of liver sections showed for both types of neoglycoproteins that uptake occurred in nonparenchymal cells only. Competition experiments with a 500-fold excess of mannan, a known ligand for the mannose/N-acetylglucosamine receptor, that is predominantly localized in endothelial cells, showed complete inhibition of the (thio-)Man43-AI-BSA uptake. In the case of (pap-)mannose-terminated albumins, however, the extent of inhibition by mannan was moderate and decreased markedly with increasing sugar density, being only 20% for (pap-)Man40-HSA. Therefore, we hypothesized that one or more additional removal systems contributed to the clearance of these (pap-)mannose glycoproteins. We found that net negative charge of the (pap-)mannose albumins clearly increased with increasing sugar density, as shown on fast protein liquid chromatography anion-exchange chromatograms. To determine whether the scavenger receptor system that is also mainly present on endothelial cells is involved, we performed competition studies with strongly negatively charged substrates, such as dextran sulfate and formaldehyde-treated human serum albumin (fHSA). An excess of dextran sulfate (500 kDa), indeed blocked the (pap-)mannose-albumin uptake for more than 95%. Dextran sulfate completely inhibited the hepatic uptake of mannan as well, indicating that the polyanion does not discriminate between the scavenger system and the mannose receptor system and should be regarded as an aspecific inhibitor of receptor-mediated endocytotic pathways. Surprisingly, a 500-fold excess of fHSA only moderately (20%) inhibited the clearance of (pap-)Man40-HSA in spite of its high affinity for the scavenger receptor. However, a combination of mannan and fHSA strongly inhibited the uptake of (pap-)Man22-HSA (90%) and to a lesser extent (pap-)Man40-HSA (80%), indicating that a third uptake mechanism may exist that recognizes both mannose groups (or other sugars) and net negative charge. This so far unnoticed receptor system apparently is strongly affected by dextran sulfate and, as shown by immunohistochemistry, is mainly localized on Kupffer cells rather than on the endothelial cells of the liver."
https://openalex.org/W1597390857,"The mechanism by which extracellular ATP stimulates insulin secretion was investigated in RINm5F cells. ATP depolarized the cells as demonstrated both by using the patch-clamp technique and a fluorescent probe. The depolarization is due to closure of ATP-sensitive K+ channels as shown directly in outside-out membrane patches. ATP also raised cytosolic Ca2+ [( Ca2+]i). At the single cell level the latency of the [Ca2+]i response was inversely related to ATP concentration. The [Ca2+]i rise is due both to inositol trisphosphate mediated Ca2+ mobilization and to Ca2+ influx. The former component, as well as inositol trisphosphate generation, were inhibited by phorbol myristate acetate which uncouples agonist receptors from phospholipase C. This manoeuvre did not block Ca2+ influx or membrane depolarization. Diazoxide, which opens ATP-sensitive K+ channels, attenuated membrane depolarization and part of the Ca2+ influx stimulated by ATP. However, the main Ca2+ influx component was unaffected by L-type channel blockers, suggesting the activation of other Ca2+ conductance pathways. ATP increased the rate of insulin secretion by more than 12-fold but the effect was transient. Prolonged exposure to EGTA dissociated the [Ca2+]i rise from ATP-induced insulin secretion, since the former was abolished and the latter only decreased by about 60%. In contrast, vasopressin-evoked insulin secretion was more sensitive to Ca2+ removal than the accompanying [Ca2+]i rise. Inhibition of phospholipase C stimulation by phorbol myristate acetate abrogated vasopressin but only reduced ATP-induced insulin secretion by 34%. These results suggest that ATP stimulates insulin release by both phospholipase C dependent and distinct mechanisms. The Ca2+)-independent component of insulin secretion points to a direct triggering of exocytosis by ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1554340828,"The extracellular lignin peroxidase from the white-rot basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium is thought to play an important role in lignin biodegradation. However, the majority of lignin-derived preparations actually experience overall polymerization at the hands of the enzyme in vitro. It has now been found that, in the presence of H2O2 at pH 4.0, the monomeric lignin precursor coniferyl alcohol is polymerized quantitatively by a lignin peroxidase preparation which is uncontaminated with MnII-dependent peroxidases. 13C NMR spectrometry of the resulting dehydropolymerisates from 13C-labeled monolignols confirms that the frequencies of different interunit linkages are very similar to those engendered through the action of horseradish peroxidase with H2O2. Indeed, lignin peroxidase does not ultimately seem to be a prerequisite for lignin degradation in vivo, yet its activity can still accelerate the conversion of lignin-derived preparations by P. chrysosporium to CO2. Consequently, lignin peroxidase can provisionally be expected to fulfill two important functions. On the one hand, the enzyme may detoxify lower molecular weight phenolic compounds released from lignins during their fungal decomposition. On the other hand, through the introduction of suitable functional groups, lignin peroxidase could indirectly enhance the susceptibility of macromolecular lignin structures toward depolymerization by another enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1535464929,"Phosphorylation of the androgen receptor was investigated in the absence of hormone as well as during and after transformation of the receptor to the tight nuclear binding form. Human prostate tumor cells (LNCaP) were labeled for 4 h with [32P]orthophosphate in the presence or absence of steroid. Subsequently, androgen receptors were immunoprecipitated either from total cell lysates or from nuclear extracts using a specific monoclonal antibody. The immunoprecipitated receptor preparations were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western blotting, using a polyclonal antiserum, and autoradiography. It was observed that the androgen receptor is already phosphorylated in the absence of hormone, but undergoes a hormone-induced additional phosphorylation. After administration of 10 nM R1881, a 1.8-fold increase in phosphorylation over nonstimulated control cells was reached. Moreover, the amount of nuclear extractable androgen receptor was increased; the acquisition of tight nuclear binding capacity was accompanied by hormone-induced receptor phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1586734181,"The final steps in the synthesis of acetyl-CoA by CO dehydrogenase (CODH) have been studied by following the exchange reaction between CoA and the CoA moiety of acetyl-CoA. This reaction had been studied earlier (Pezacka, E., and Wood, H. G. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 1609-1615 and Ramer, W. E., Raybuck, S. A., Orme-Johnson, W. H., and Walsh, C. T. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 4675-4680). The CoA/acetyl-CoA exchange activity was determined at various controlled redox potentials and was found to be activated by a one-electron reduction with half-maximum activity occurring at -486 mV. There is approximately 2000-fold stimulation of the exchange by performing the reaction at -575 mV relative to the rate at -80 mV. Binding of CoA to CODH is not sensitive to the redox potential; therefore, the reductive activation affects some step other than association/dissociation of CoA. We propose that a metal center on CODH with a midpoint reduction potential of less than or equal to -486 mV is activated by a one-electron reduction to cleave the carbonyl-sulfur bond and/or bind the acetyl group of acetyl-CoA. Based on a comparison of the redox dependence of this reaction with that for methylation of CODH (Lu, W-P., Harder, S. R., and Ragsdale, S. W. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 3124-3133) and CO2 reduction and formation of the Ni-Fe-C EPR signal (Lindahl, P. A., Munck, E., and Ragsdale, S. W. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 3873-3879), we propose that the assembly of the acetyl group of acetyl-CoA, i.e. binding the methyl group of the methylated corrinoid/iron-sulfur protein, binding CO, and methyl migration to form the acetyl-CODH intermediate, occur at the novel Ni-Fe3-4-containing site in CODH. CO has two effects on the CoA/acetyl-CoA exchange: it activates the reaction due to its reductive capacity and its acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor. We also discovered that the CoA/acetyl-CoA exchange was inhibited by nitrous oxide via an oxidative mechanism. In the presence of a low-potential electron donor, CODH becomes a nitrous oxide reductase which catalytically converts N2O to N2. This study combined with earlier results (Lu, W-P., Harder, S. R., and Ragsdale, S. W. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 3124-3133) establishes that the two-subunit form of CODH is completely active in all reactions known to be catalyzed by CODH."
https://openalex.org/W1587819187,"Several detergents activated microsomal dehydrodolichyl diphosphate synthase of rat liver, but the chain length of products shifted downward from C90 and C95 with increasing concentration of the detergents. Maximum activation was observed at the concentration of 2% Triton X-100, 30 mM octyl glucoside, 30 mM 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate, and 10 mM deoxycholate with the product chain length being C80-C85, C65-C75, C70-C75, and C55-C65, respectively. The activity of Triton X-100 solubilized enzyme was decreased by asolectin, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylcholine. The chain lengths of products formed in the presence of these phospholipids were C85 and C90. In the presence of both phosphatidylcholine and Mg2+ the solubilized enzyme was able to produce C90 and C95 dehydrodolichyl diphosphates like native microsomal enzyme. Microsomal enzyme preparations from rat liver, brain, and testis catalyzed the formation of dehydrodolichyl diphosphates with the same chain lengths as those of the natural dolichols occurring in individual tissues. The chain length distribution of dehydrodolichyl products by (rat liver) microsomes also depended on the concentration of substrates. Not only did increasing the concentration of isopentenyl diphosphate lead to longer chain product, but decreasing that of farnesyl diphosphate increased product chain length."
https://openalex.org/W1504459477,"Immunoblot analysis of cell extracts using antibodies specific for the 91-kDa form of membrane-associated phosphatidate phosphatase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Lin, Y.-P., and Carman, G.M. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 8641-8645) revealed the existence of a 45-kDa form of the enzyme. Immunoblot analysis also showed that the 91-kDa form of the enzyme was a proteolytic product of a 104-kDa enzyme. The mitochondrial fraction contained the 45-kDa enzyme, whereas the microsomal fraction contained the 45- and 104-kDa enzymes. In vivo labeling experiments showed that the 104-kDa form of phosphatidate phosphatase was not a precursor of the 45-kDa form of the enzyme. The 45- and 104-kDa forms of phosphatidate phosphatase were purified and characterized. The enzymological properties of both enzymes were similar. However, the phosphatidate phosphatase 45- and 104-kDa proteins differed with respect to their isoelectric points and peptide fragments resulting from V8 proteolysis and cyanogen bromide cleavage. The expression of the phosphatidate phosphatase 45- and 104-kDa enzymes were regulated differentially in cells supplemented with inositol. The addition of inositol to the growth medium resulted in the induction of the phosphatidate phosphatase 45-kDa enzyme. The expression of the 104-kDa enzyme was not affected by inositol.

It led to the identification of a new cardiotoxin (CTX) analogue protein (CTX V) with major aggregation/fusion, but few hemolysis, activities. On the contrary, cardiotoxin (CTX III) induced significant hemolysis of human red blood cells but exhibited few aggregation/fusion activities. To study the structure/activity relationship of these CTX-induced processes, the amino acid sequence of CTX V was determined and its aggregation/fusion activity was compared with that of CTX III by transmission electron microscopy, quasielastic laser light scattering, differential scanning calorimetry, and fluorescence spectroscopy. The results show that the CTX-induced fusion process at temperatures slightly above that of the gel to liquid-crystalline phase transition of sphingomyelin vesicles can ultimately convert small sonicated vesicles into large fused vesicles with sizes of 1-2 microns. The abilities of CTX V to induce the leakage of sphingomyelin vesicles content and to cause the fusion of vesicles are approximately 10-fold higher than those of CTX III. Based on the CTX structures determined in the present and other studies, it is suggested that the amino acid residue X within the well conserved sequence of -Cys-Pro-X-Gly-Lys-Gln-Leu-Cys- plays a role in the interaction of CTX with lipid molecules. The lipid phase transition could further enhance the protein-lipid interaction in the process leading to the fusion of vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W1531782279,"Insulin action on gene expression can be glucose-dependent or -independent. Accumulation of aldolase B mRNA and of an unidentified 5.4-kilobase mRNA as well as accumulation of L-type pyruvate kinase mRNAs (Decaux, J.F., Antoine, B., and Kahn, A. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 11584-11590) in cultured hepatocytes isolated from fasted rats require the presence of both glucose and insulin, these agents not being effective individually. In contrast, maintaining the amount of albumin and transferrin mRNAs in these hepatocytes requires the presence of insulin alone, glucose having no effect by itself. Transcription of the albumin gene, investigated by run-on assay, is active in the presence of insulin alone, with or without glucose, whereas transcription of the aldolase B gene is stimulated by glucose and insulin together, but not by insulin or glucose alone. In addition, the stability of the albumin and aldolase B mRNAs in cultured hepatocytes is lowered in the absence of glucose and insulin together as compared to the stability in the presence of one or both agents. These results confirm that transduction of the insulin signal occurs via distinct pathways; one of these pathways could involve a secondary insulin-dependent modification of metabolite concentration, whereas other pathways could be more directly related to the activity(ies) of the occupied insulin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1534519444,"The key regulatory enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of the plant hormone ethylene is 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase (EC 4.4.1.14). We have partially purified ACC synthase 6,000-fold from Cucurbita fruit tissue treated with indoleacetic acid + benzyladenine + aminooxyacetic acid + LiCl. The enzyme has a specific activity of 35,000 nmol/h/mg protein, a pH optimum of 9.5, an isoelectric point of 5.0, a Km of 17 microM with respect to S-adenosylmethionine, and is a dimer of two identical subunits of approximately 46,000 Da each. The subunit exists in vivo as a 55,000-Da species similar in size to the primary in vitro translation product. DNA sequence analysis of the cDNA clone pACC1 revealed that the coding region of the ACC synthase mRNA spans 493 amino acids corresponding to a 55,779-Da polypeptide; and expression of the coding sequence (pACC1) in Escherichia coli as a COOH terminus hybrid of beta-galactosidase or as a nonhybrid polypeptide catalyzed the conversion of S-adenosylmethionine to ACC (Sato, T., and Theologis, A. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86, 6621-6625). Immunoblotting experiments herein show that the molecular mass of the beta-galactosidase hybrid polypeptide is 170,000 Da, and the size of the largest nonhybrid polypeptide is 53,000 Da. The data suggest that the enzyme is post-translationally processed during protein purification."
https://openalex.org/W1602085496,"The yeast Yarrowia lipolytica secretes an alkaline extracellular protease (AEP). It is first synthesized as a precursor comprising a putative signal peptide, a stretch of 10 X-Ala or X-Pro sequences that are substrates for a dipeptidyl aminopeptidase, a large pro-region that contains a glycosylation site and two Lys-Arg sites that can be cleaved by a KEX2-like endoprotease and finally the mature protease itself. A defect in the XPR6 (KEX2-like) gene results in the secretion of an inactive proenzyme (Matoba, S., and Ogrydziak, D. M. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 6037-6043), showing that the proregion inhibits protease activity. To determine whether the proregion plays an additional role in protease secretion, we have generated deletions and point mutations in the corresponding region of the structural gene. In this paper we examine the effects of these mutations on AEP secretion and maturation and show that the proregion is essential for its secretion. All deletions affecting the proregion resulted in the intracellular accumulation of unprocessed precursors. Deletion of the glycosylation site in the proregion resulted in the production of an unglycosylated precursor that was secreted and matured correctly at 18 degrees C but accumulated in the cells at 28 degrees C. From these results, we propose that the AEP prosequence plays an additional essential role in guiding the proper folding of the protein into a conformation compatible with secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1599739275,"Receptor-mediated recognition and adhesion to laminin, a specific glycoprotein from basement membranes, exert an important role in many biological phenomena. Studying cell surface proteins of B16-F10, a metastatic murine melanoma cell line, we identified a 120-140 kDa glycoprotein (gp120/140) that binds laminin. This glycoprotein was recognized by a polyclonal antibody raised against the human fibronectin receptor beta 1-integrin chain, as well as immunoprecipitated by an anti-alpha 6 chain (monoclonal antibody GoH3), characterizing it as an alpha 6/beta 1-integrin. Its binding to laminin was specific and displayed moderate affinity, as its apparent dissociation constant was 18 nM. To characterize the influence of carbohydrate moieties on the laminin-gp120/140 interaction, metaperiodate oxidation, metabolic inhibition of glycosylation, and enzymatic deglycosylation studies were performed. Our results indicate that gp120/140 Asn-linked oligosaccharides play a part in this interaction. Reciprocally, both metaperiodate and N-glycanase treatment of native laminin reduced its binding to gp120/140, characterizing the latter as a lectin-like molecule. These results point to glycosylation processes as a possible mechanism for variable binding specificity profiles among integrins."
https://openalex.org/W1522143119,"The identities of the amino acid at position 209 are most critical in determining specific coumarin 7- and steroid 15 alpha-hydroxylase activity in P450coh and P450(15)alpha, respectively. This system, therefore, provides us with an excellent model to study the structural basis for P450 specificity as a monooxygenase. We expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae a series of the mutated P450s in which residue 209 was substituted with the various amino acids and characterized the spectral property and hydroxylase activity of these mutated P450s. The positioning of a hydrophobic residue including Phe, Leu, and Val at position 209 resulted in shifting the P450 to the high-spin state, while a charged amino acid such as Lys or Asp produced the low-spin form. Moreover, a P450 with Asn or Gly in this position exhibited spectra indicating a mixture of the high- and low-spin forms. This spin alteration, depending upon the hydrophobicity and size of residue at position 209, indicates that this position is likely to reside close to the sixth axial ligand on the distal surface of the heme in these P450s. This proximity of residue 209 to the ligand may explain the critical role of this residue in determining the hydroxylase specificity and activity of these P450s."
https://openalex.org/W1590966264,"Three human class I major histocompatibility antigens (HLA) with molecular masses of 44, 39, and 36 kDa were identified in plasma by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Further biochemical characterization showed that these antigens in plasma could be fractionated by Sephacryl S-300 column chromatography into two different pools. The 44-kDa intact HLA heavy chains are detected only in pool I and have an apparent molecular weight of 200,000 as determined by calibrated gel filtration column chromatography. The 39- and 36-kDa HLA heavy chains are present only in pool II and have an apparent molecular weight of 50,000. HLA in pool I can be extracted by Triton X-114 detergent, but 39- and 36-kDa plasma HLA in pool II are water soluble and not extractable by Triton X-114. Amino acid sequences of NH2 termini for 44- and 39-kDa plasma HLA are identical to that of cellular HLA. In contrast, the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence for 36-kDa plasma HLA has not been reported previously for any other proteins. Since the loss of both transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail at the carboxyl terminus of HLA will generate a 36-kDa protein, the findings suggest that the 39-kDa HLA might be the product of alternatively spliced mRNA with deletion of the exon coding for transmembrane domain. By using polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing, the presence of alternatively spliced mRNA with deletion of the transmembrane domain exon was identified in mononuclear leukocytes of peripheral blood. This alternatively spliced HLA mRNA was not detectable in mononuclear leukocytes of an individual who had no 39-kDa plasma HLA. This finding indicates that the alternatively spliced mRNA in mononuclear leukocytes is responsible for the synthesis of a secretable class I HLA."
https://openalex.org/W1588136567,"A fragment of the rat androgen receptor (amino acids 533-637) containing the DNA-binding domain was produced in Escherichia coli as a fusion product with protein A of Staphylococcus aureus. The fusion protein was purified on IgG-Sepharose, a method that does not involve the use of denaturing agents. Approximately 4 mg of fusion protein was obtained from 500 ml of bacterial culture. In gel shift assays, the recombinant DNA-binding domain displays an affinity for a fragment of the long terminal repeat of mouse mammary tumor virus and for an intronic fragment of the gene coding for the C3 component of the androgen-regulated rat prostatic binding protein. In a DNase I footprinting assay, the fusion protein protects a sequence in the C3 fragment that has previously been shown to act as a functional androgen response element. Interestingly, a single base pair mutation in the response element, which abolishes androgen inducibility, also destroys the ability to interact with the recombinant androgen receptor DNA-binding domain."
https://openalex.org/W1502650833,"We have used synthetic peptides representing segments of the signal sequences of preferredoxin (pFd) and the precursor of the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (pS) to study interactions with the signal sequence recognition system at the chloroplast surface. Peptides representing the COOH-terminal 30 amino acids of the pFd and pS signal peptides were able to completely and reversibly inhibit the import of their homologous precursors into isolated chloroplasts at a 2.5 microM concentration. Import was blocked at the level of precursor binding to the chloroplast. This inhibition of precursor binding and import was not due to disruption of chloroplast integrity as incubation of isolated chloroplasts with the peptides did not cause measurable perturbation of the envelope membranes. The peptides also were able to block the import of the heterologous precursor protein, suggesting that pS and pFd share a common signal sequence recognition system. Visualization of the bound peptides at the chloroplast surface by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using antipeptide antibodies gave a marked punctate staining pattern. This pattern is consistent with the localization of chloroplast import receptor(s) at contact zones between the inner and outer envelope membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1565929404,"Abstract The gene for the methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS) from an extreme thermophile, Thermus thermophilus HB8, was cloned and sequenced. By expression of the T. thermophilus MetRS gene in Escherichia coli cells, thermostable MetRS was overproduced and purified to homogeneity by heat treatment and one-step column chromatography. The amino acid sequence of T. thermophilus MetRS showed low identities (approximately 25%) with those of MetRSs from E. coli, and cytoplasm and mitochondria of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, the amino acid residues in the binding sites for ATP and the anticodon and the 3' terminus of tRNA(Met) are highly conserved among the four MetRSs. T. thermophilus MetRS has a zinc finger-like sequence with all the three cysteine residues and a histidine residue. By site-directed mutagenesis of one of the cysteine residues (Cys127) of T. thermophilus MetRS, the SH group was found to be important for methionyl-tRNA synthesis. Just upstream of the structural gene for T. thermophilus MetRS there is a short open reading frame which codes for a methionine-rich peptide and is partly overlapped with an alternative terminator/antiterminator structure, suggesting that transcription of this gene is regulated by attenuation. Further upstream a region contains a nucleotide sequence homologous to that of the 5' half of T. thermophilus initiator tRNA(Met)."
https://openalex.org/W1584000520,"A cDNA encoding chicken glycine decarboxylase (pCP15b) was isolated using an antibody specific to this protein. Additional cDNAs were cloned with the aid of the genomic fragments obtained by using the pCP15b cDNA probe. No initiator methionine codon is found in the currently elucidated cDNA sequence, and an ATG codon in an exon is assigned to this role. The precursor glycine decarboxylase deduced from the 3514-base pair nucleotide sequence is comprised of 1,004 amino acids (Mr = 111,848). The 1,020 amino acid residues are encoded for the precursor form of human glycine decarboxylase (Mr = 112,869) in the 3,783-base long cDNA sequence of two 1.9-kilobase pair cDNAs with a pentanucleotide overlap. The pyridoxal phosphate binding site lysine and a glycine-rich region, which is suggested to be responsible for the attachment of the phosphate moiety of pyridoxal phosphate, are found in close proximity in both the chicken and human enzymes. This region essential for the enzyme action is suggested to be embedded in a segment rich in beta-turns and random coils and is surrounded by conserved and repetitive amino acid sequences. It is suggested that these structures are involved in the organization of the active site of glycine decarboxylase."
https://openalex.org/W1517116499,"The effect of recombinant interleukin-1 beta (rIL-1 beta) on elastin accumulation by lipid-laden interstitial cells (LIC) derived from neonatal rat lung was examined. The LIC, a fibroblast subtype, synthesized large amounts of elastin which was deposited into the extracellular matrix. This elastin was alkali-resistant and had an amino acid composition typical of adult rat elastin. Treatment of lipid-laden interstitial cell cultures with rIL-1 beta at 100 pg/ml caused a dramatic decrease in elastin accumulation as assessed by hot alkali treatment and transmission electron micrographs of the cell cultures. Tropoelastin formation was selectively decreased by rIL-1 beta relative to other proteins. Steady state levels of elastin mRNA were slightly decreased by rIL-1 beta at 5 pg/ml and markedly decreased by rIL-1 beta at 50 pg/ml or greater. The addition of indomethacin had no effect on rIL-1 beta-induced decreases in elastin mRNA levels. Inhibiting protein synthesis with cycloheximide blocked the effect of rIL-1 beta on elastin mRNA levels. The level of alpha 1(I) collagen mRNA was decreased by rIL-1 beta, but only at concentrations higher than that needed to induce a decrease in elastin mRNA. These data indicate that rIL-1 beta decreased steady state levels for elastin mRNA and elastin accumulation and can selectively regulate the accumulation of elastin and collagen."
https://openalex.org/W1517077268,"We describe a 20-kDa phosphorylated polypeptide, which is secreted constitutively at the apical surface of the kidney-derived Madin-Darby canine kidney cell line. Using polyclonal antibodies raised against this protein, we show that it is generated from a 60-kDa O-glycosylated, sulfated, and phosphorylated precursor protein by an intracellular proteolytic maturation step, which is pH-sensitive. Amino acid sequence analysis of the 20-kDa secreted polypeptide demonstrated that it displays 70% identity with the carboxyl-terminal amino acids of human osteopontin. The amino-terminal amino acid of the 20-kDa polypeptide corresponds to amino acid 213 of human osteopontin. Thrombin has been shown to cleave rat osteopontin in vivo and in vitro at amino acid 153, yielding two fragments of 28 and 26 kDa. A similar cleavage product can be detected by thrombin treatment of the 60-kDa precursor, suggesting that the precursor is identical or closely related to osteopontin. In the rat nephron, the protein has been localized along the luminal surfaces of the proximal and distal tubule and the collecting duct cells. These results show that in the kidney-derived cell line Madin-Darby canine kidney osteopontin or a closely related protein is proteolytically processed to a 20-kDa polypeptide, raising the possibility that diverse functions of osteopontin in various tissues might be attributed to specific processing to distinct polypeptides."
https://openalex.org/W1532966372,"Fucosyl residues in the alpha 1----3 linkage to N-acetylglucosamine (Fuc alpha 1----3GlcNAc) on oligosaccharides of glycoproteins and glycolipids have been detected in certain human tumors and are developmentally expressed (reviewed in Foster, C. S., and Glick, M. C. (1988) Adv. Neuroblastoma Res. 2, 421-432). In order to understand control mechanisms for the biosynthesis of these fucosylated glycoconjugates, GDP-L-Fuc-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminide alpha 1----3fucosyltransferase was purified from human neuroblastoma cells, CHP 134, utilizing either the immobilized oligosaccharide or disaccharide substrates. The enzyme, extracted from CHP 134 cells, was purified by DEAE- and SP-Sephadex chromatography and then by either immobilized substrate. alpha 1----3Fucosyltransferase was obtained in approximately 10% yield and was purified 45,000-fold from the cell extract. The kinetic properties of the enzyme showed an apparent KGDP-Fuc 43 microM, KGal beta 1----4GlcNAc 0.4 mM, KGal beta 1----4Glc 8.1 mM, and KFuc alpha 1----2Gal beta 1----4Glc 1.0 mM. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the affinity-purified enzyme showed two proteins which migrated, Mr = 45,000-40,000. The enzyme differed in substrate specificity, pH optimum, response to N-ethylmaleimide and ion requirements from the enzymes purified from human milk or serum. The inability of alpha 1----3fucosyltransferase to transfer to substrates containing NeuAc alpha 2----3 or alpha 2----6Gal is in contrast to the reports for the enzyme in other human tumors. This substrate specificity correlates with the oligosaccharide residues thus far defined on glycoproteins of CHP 134 cells since NeuAc and Fuc alpha 1----3GlcNAc have yet to be detected on the same oligosaccharide antenna. However, the enzyme transfers to Fuc alpha 1----2Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc/Glc with higher activity than the unfucosylated disaccharides, although neither alpha 1----2fucosyltransferase nor Fuc alpha 1----2 residues have been detected in CHP 134 cells. The different substrate specificities of alpha 1----3fucosyltransferase isolated from human tumors and normal sources leads to the suggestion that a family of alpha 1----3fucosyltransferases may exist and that they may be differentially expressed in human tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1488880692,"Actobindin was previously shown to be an 88-residue polypeptide (Mr 9761) with an internal tandem repeat of 33-34 amino acids. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments have confirmed this Mr for native actobindin. Pyreneglyoxal-labeled actobindin had a similar Mr by sedimentation equilibrium analysis and bound to actin in a manner qualitatively similar to unmodified actobindin as determined by gel electrophoretic analysis of covalently cross-linked products. The stoichiometry of the actin-actobindin interaction was determined from the change in apparent Mr of pyrene-glyoxal-labeled actobindin in the presence of actin, as determined by scanning the ultracentrifuge cell at a wavelength that detected only the labeled protein. These data were consistent with the formation of a complex containing two actin and one actobindin molecules. The overall KD describing the binding of the first actin to either of the two sites on actobindin was 3.3 microM. The binding constant for the second actin suggested either negative cooperativity or inequality of the two actin-binding sites. Similar binding constants were obtained by analysis of the fluorescence enhancement that occurred when actobindin bound to actin labeled with either pyrene iodoacetamide or 4-(N-iodoacetoxyethyl-N-methyl)-7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole. Cross-linking experiments with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide and N-hydroxy-sulfosuccinimide qualitatively agreed with predictions made from a two-binding site model. Additionally, both the fluorescence and cross-linking experiments suggested that the interaction of the two actin molecules may contribute to the stability of the heterotrimeric complex."
https://openalex.org/W1507784087,"Inhibition of a tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (ACP) from Leishmania donovani and the tartrate-sensitive ACP from human seminal fluid (prostatic ACP) was examined using a series of 13 molybdate-containing heteropolyanions. The heteropolyanions were divided into four groups based on the number of molybdenum atoms they contain: Group I, Mo4; Group II, Mo6-8; Group III, Mo12; Group IV, Mo18. Two of the four groups, those consisting of compounds that contain either an Mo4 unit or an Mo18 unit with a heteroatom in the central cavity, were potent inhibitors and exhibited the highest degree of selectivity against the leishmanial and seminal fluid ACPs. The inhibition of prostatic ACP by complex E2 could be completely reversed by dialysis. Little inhibition of the acid phosphatase, beta-glucuronidase, or alpha-mannosidase from human spleen was observed with complexes B' and E2. For the seminal fluid phosphatase, the Ki values obtained with arsenate and vanadate depended markedly on pH, suggesting that, unlike most other phosphatases, the conformation of the inhibitor binding site on human seminal fluid ACP is pH-dependent. Results of competition experiments performed with various inhibitor pairs indicated that complex D2 binds to the active site of prostatic ACP while complex M binds at some site on the enzyme that affects the active site. Binding of complex M also modifies the affinity of the enzyme for other inhibitors such as vanadate. The potency of several heteropolyanion complexes and their selective inhibition of pathophysiologically significant acid phosphatases indicate that these compounds may have value as tools for study of the structure and function of this class of enzyme and perhaps in the therapy of human disease."
https://openalex.org/W1552867788,"Five distinct serum A (SAA) cDNA clones have been isolated from a library constructed using hepatic mRNA isolated from an individual beagle dog with canine pain syndrome. This implies the existence of at least three SAA genes in the dog genome. One clone predicts a truncated amyloid A-like SAA molecule and offers a possible alternative mechanism for the pathogenesis of secondary amyloidosis. Relative to the human and mouse SAA proteins, an additional peptide of eight amino acids is specified by each of the dog cDNA clones. The existence of this peptide in all acute phase dog SAA proteins was confirmed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate of acute phase high density lipoprotein and provides supporting evidence for gene conversion as a mechanism for maintaining the homogeneity of the SAA gene family within a species. Analysis of hepatic RNA following induction of an acute phase response shows a dramatic increase in SAA mRNA concentration; the SAA transcripts show a transient increase in size early in inflammation due to an increase in polyadenylation."
https://openalex.org/W1520794681,"Leader peptidase (Lep) is a membrane-bound enzyme of the Escherichia coli inner membrane that serves to remove signal peptides from exported proteins. Statistical and experimental studies of known signal peptides have defined a short C-terminal region that seems to provide the information for correct by Lep. Based on the patterns of conserved amino acids found in this region, we have designed a signal peptide cleavage cassette. This cassette is processed at the expected site when introduced after an uncleaved signal peptide. Furthermore, processing is blocked in the predicted manner when the (-3, -1)-rule for signal peptide is violated. This suggests that current understanding of the sequence requirements for signal peptide is sufficiently advanced to be used in, e.g. protein engineering applications."
https://openalex.org/W1528171087,"The reductive debromination of BrCCl3 by ferrous deoxymyoglobin leads to the covalent bonding of the prosthetic heme to the protein. We have previously shown, by the use of peptide mapping and mass spectrometry, that residue 93 is covalently bound to the heme moiety. In the present study the structure of the heme adduct was more completely determined by 1H and 13C NMR techniques. We have found that the ring I vinyl group of the prosthetic heme was altered by the addition of a imidazole nitrogen to the alpha-carbon and a CCl2 moiety to the beta-carbon. The electronic absorption spectra of the oxidized and reduced states of the altered heme-protein indicated that the heme-iron exists in a bis-histidine-ligated form. Analysis of the crystal structure of native myoglobin suggested that for the altered heme-protein, residues 97 and 64 are ligated to the heme-iron and that residue 97 has replaced the native proximal residue 93. These movements, in effect a histidine shuffle at the active site, may be responsible for the enhanced reducing activity of the altered protein."
https://openalex.org/W1504813209,"Artificial bicistronic mRNAs based on rabbit beta-globin and bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase protein-coding sequences were tested for translation activity in a mouse astrocytoma cell-free extract. This cell extract exhibited an apparent preference for 5'-distal or internal initiation over 5'-proximal (first AUG) initiation. 5'-Distal initiation appeared to be 5'-cap independent, suggesting that nonstandard initiation was responsible. This conclusion was based on a lack of inhibition of internal initiation by added cap analog and insensitivity of internal initiation to the presence or absence of a 5'-cap structure. Exogenous reticulocyte initiation factors were tested for effect on 5'-proximal initiation. The only factor with a significant effect was found to be eukaryotic initiation factor 4F, or the cap-binding protein. Addition of this factor promoted 5'-end initiation as evident by a general increase in 5'-proximal open reading frame (ORF) product relative to 5'-distal ORF product. The relative expression of 5'-proximal to 5'-distal ORFs in bicistronic or multicistronic mRNAs may very well be dependent on activity levels of eukaryotic initiation factor 4F and possibly other mRNA-dependent initiation factors."
https://openalex.org/W1497171553,"Several cDNAs encoding H-protein, a constituent of the glycine cleavage system, were cloned from chicken liver cDNA libraries with an antibody raised against rat H-protein or with a nick-translated cDNA of an immunoreactive clone. The structure of the H-protein cDNA consisting of 910 base pairs was determined using clones with an apparent overlap in the nucleotide sequence. The cDNA encodes the precursor form of H-protein that is comprised of 39 amino acid residues for a mitochondrial presequence and 125 amino acid residues for the mature protein, following a 5' untranslated region of 13 base pairs. There are two genuine consensus sequences for the cleavage/polyadenylation of the precursor H-protein mRNA in the 3' untranslated region of the cDNA sequence. We showed by comparison with the delta-aminolevulinate synthase gene that only one copy of the H-protein cDNA occurs in the haploid genome of the chicken. Nevertheless, two types of H-protein mRNAs, which differ by the length of their 3' untranslated region, are produced in liver. The chicken H-protein gene extends over 8 kilobase pairs on the genome and includes 5 exons that encode the entire cDNA sequence. Two AATAAA motifs are coded in the last exon of this gene, suggesting that the differently size H-protein mRNAs are produced by the alternative use of these motifs."
https://openalex.org/W1529026604,"A 77Se-containing moiety has been attached to cysteine residues in bovine hemoglobin, reduced ribonuclease A, and glutathione by reaction with [77Se]6,6'-diselenobis(3-nitrobenzoic acid). The resultant species contain Se-S linkages that have 77Se NMR absorptions in the range range of 568-580 ppm. Spectra have been recorded at 4.7 and 9.7 tesla (T). For labeled hemoglobin a line width of 250 Hz is seen at 4.7 T and 1000 Hz at 9.4 T. This quadrupling of line width with doubling of observational field strength is consistent with exclusive relaxation by the chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) mechanism. These line widths are greater than expected for a molecule the size of hemoglobin and indicate some aggregation at the high concentrations used. Upon dissociation and partial unfolding of the hemoglobin subunits, the line widths of the selenium resonance decrease to 35 and 120 Hz at 4.7 and 9.4 T, respectively. The spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) for the dissociated hemoglobin at 9.4 T was found to be 220 ms. Together with a value of 377 ms for the spin-spin relaxation time (T2), determined from the line width, an estimate of the CSA was made. This gave a value of 890 ppm, which is in accord with other values for Se(II) linked only by single bonds. When this value for the CSA is used, together with the CSA contribution to the line width, in estimating a correlation time for seleno(3-nitrobenzoic acid) (SeNB)-labeled glutathione, a value of 4 x 10(-11) s is obtained. For SeNB-labeled denatured ribonuclease, four distinct resonances are resolvable at 4.7 T and five resonances at 9.4 T. From T1 values for these resonances and the value of 890 ppm for the CSA, an appropriate correlation time of 0.1 ns was determined, which should result in 77Se resonances of 0.2-1.0 Hz at 4.7 and 9.4 T, respectively. Much greater apparent line widths are observed, which are attributed to microheterogeneity resulting from formation of inter- and intramolecular disulfide linkages. It is concluded that when there are no complications from protein aggregation or chemical exchange, the CSA values anticipated to exist in glutathione peroxidase or other selenoproteins should result in resonances with line widths in the range from 27 to 170 Hz, depending on field strength. These resonances should therefore be observable in the intact protein, if 77Se-enriched material is available."
https://openalex.org/W1509888817,"31P NMR spectra of perfused lymphocytes, embedded in alginate capsules and activated by interleukin-2, were remarkably different from those of control lymphocytes. The main differences were the appearance and gradual increase in phosphodiester signals, glycerophosphocholine and glycerophosphoethanolamine. These metabolic changes also occurred following perfusion with phorbol ester and after incubation with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and were not dependent on a special growth medium. Nifedipine, a calcium channel blocking drug, inhibited the effects of phytohemagglutinin, but not of interleukin-2. There were no NMR spectral differences between peripheral lymphocytes, stimulated for 3 weeks, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Thus, sustained accelerated turnover of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine is an inherent feature of the activation process. 31P NMR spectra of lymphocytes are characterized by a low signal of phosphocholine. Perfusion studies with high concentrations of choline and the use of dapsone, an inhibitor of cytidylyltransferase, indicated that choline kinase plays a key role in regulating phosphaditylcholine synthesis in human lymphocytes."

Northern analysis suggested and run-off transcription confirmed that the glycine decarboxylase gene transcription is exclusively tissue-specific and takes place at different efficiencies in liver, kidney, and brain which are the chicken tissues exhibiting the glycine cleavage activity. No evidence for the glycine decarboxylase gene transcription was obtained in heart, spleen, and skeletal muscle. Basal and tissue-specific transcription of the H-protein gene can be distinguished. The tissue-specific transcription coordinates with transcription of the glycine decarboxylase gene in active tissues, while low abundance H-protein and its mRNA, products of the basal transcription, exist in inactive tissues together with small amounts of T-protein. Apparently, T-protein is synthesized by a process similar to that for H-protein. Glycine decarboxylase mRNA levels show a linear relationship with H-protein mRNA levels and with specific activities of the glycine cleavage reaction in active tissues. Tissue-specific distribution of the glycine cleavage activity is primarily determined by the expression of the glycine decarboxylase gene. The coordinate and tissue-specific transcription of the genes for the constituent proteins plays a key role in determining the magnitude of the glycine cleavage activity in chicken tissues and, thereby, the tissue-specificity of glycine metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1587349878,"Rat liver microsomes catalyzed the formation of A,E,E-geranylgeranyl diphosphate from farnesyl diphosphate and isopentenyl diphosphate in the presence of Triton X-100. Studies on product specificity using various primers such as Z,E-farnesyl diphosphate, E,E-farnesyl diphosphate, Z,E,E-geranylgeranyl diphosphate, E,E,E-geranylgeranyl diphosphate, Z,E,E,E-geranylfarnesyl diphosphate, and E,E,E,E-geranylfarnesyl diphosphate suggested that the microsomal dehydrodolichyl diphosphate synthase has such properties that it releases Z,E,E-geranylgeranyl diphosphate, the first intermediate, in the reactions with farnesyl diphosphate as the starting primer. Metabolic labeling of rat liver slices with [2-3H]mevalonic acid revealed the accumulation of E,E,E-geranylgeranyl (di)phosphates as well as dolichyl (di)phosphate (C85 and C90) and dehydrodolichol (C85 and C90), but no accumulation of Z,E,E-geranylgeranyl (di)phosphate or E,E-farnesyl (di)phosphate was detected. Microsomal enzyme preparations from mouse liver and hamster liver also produced Z,E,E-geranylgeranyl diphosphate from farnesyl diphosphate and isopentenyl diphosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1542804798,"Abstract The present work describes the detection, purification, and characterization of a serine endopeptidase with preference for a phosphoserine in the P1' position of the substrate. During probing for the enzyme in crude extracts, as well as during its 64,000-fold purification, 32P-labeled guanidovaleryl-Arg-Ala-Ser(P)-isobutyl amide (I) was used to measure the cleavage of the Ala-Ser(P) bond. With this substrate, kcat was 1.7 s-1 and Km was 30 microM at the pH optimum, 7.5. The enzyme was classified as a serine peptidase from its reaction with a set of inhibitors, among which diisopropyl fluorophosphate was effective at low (20 microM) concentration. The endopeptidase showed an Mr of 74,000 under native as well as denaturing and reducing conditions, indicating that the native enzyme consists of only one major polypeptide chain. The molecular size and inhibition profile suggested identity of this enzyme with prolyl endopeptidase (EC 3.4.21.26). This was supported by its activity against specific substrates, such as succinyl-Gly-Pro-Leu-Pro-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (kcat = 7.2 s-1 and Km = 290 microM), and by the inhibition of the latter activity by I. Compared with the cleavage of 100 microM I, Gly-Val-Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Val-Ala-Gln-Leu, after phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, was cleaved at the Ala-Ser(P) bond at a relative rate of 0.43, while cleavage of the Ala-Ser bond of the unphosphorylated undecapeptide was undetectable, i.e. less than 0.03. The pentapeptide Arg-Arg-Pro-Ser-Val was rapidly cleaved at the Pro-Ser bond (relative rate, 2.2). Still, the cleavage of the Pro-Ser(P) bond of the corresponding phosphorylated pentapeptide was even higher (relative rate, 4.0). These data suggest that phosphorylation of a serine residue in the P1' position of at least a few substrates of prolyl endopeptidase will increase the rate of their cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W1508634141,"The CD spectrum of a restriction fragment that contains a single copy of a Xenopus borealis somatic 5 S rRNA gene, like those of two smaller fragments from the binding site for transcription factor IIIA (TFIIIA), is that of B-form DNA. Under dehydrating conditions (76% ethanol) the 5 S rDNA undergoes a transition into an A conformation. The spectra of the three fragments, however, do exhibit some perturbation in that the longwave positive peaks are shifted to shorter wavelengths and have enhanced rotational strength compared with reference B-form spectra. The helical repeats measured for the smaller fragments indicate that the helix winding angle can account for these features in the CD spectra. We suggest that G:C-rich boxes that punctuate not only the TFIIIA binding site but the whole 5 S gene are responsible for the conformational perturbation manifest in the CD spectra and may play a role in the recognition of the DNA by the factor. The spectrum of the gene is unchanged in the presence of TFIIIA, indicating that the structural heterogeneity of the DNA persists upon complex formation. The CD spectra of native TFIIIA.5 S rRNA particles isolated from oocytes and of particles reconstituted in vitro are identical and only moderately different from the spectrum of free 5 S rRNA, suggesting that the protein effects only limited changes in the secondary and/or tertiary structure of the RNA. The helical structure of the two binding sites is discussed with respect to a common mode of interaction of TFIIIA with DNA and RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1537675325,"Glutamine/glutamic-acid rich proteins (GRPs) are a family of rat submandibular gland acinar proteins which are secreted in response to beta-adrenergic agonists such as isoproterenol. Two forms of GRP transcripts have been identified by isolating plasmids containing cDNAs which code for two distinct GRPs, termed GRP-Ca and GRP-Cb. GRP-Ca and GRP-Cb have identical sequences up to nucleotide 670. This is followed by a unique 90- (GRP-Ca) or 95- (GRP-Cb) base pair element. Both forms have common 3‘ nucleotide sequences, although the GRP-Cb stop codon is 27 base pairs further 3‘ from the start site of transcription. Systemic exposure to isoproterenol results in a decrease in the relative steady-state level of GRP-Ca transcripts within 24 h, whereas GRP-Cb message increases after several days of isoproterenol treatment. The demonstration that secretagogues such as isoproterenol can modulate changes in salivary protein expression suggests that the machinery responsible for exocytosis is functionally coupled to the cellular apparatus involved in acinar protein production."
https://openalex.org/W1531144232,"Spectrin chromatographically isolated from human red cell membranes contains a proteolytic activity, inhibited by leupeptin, with a dependence on calcium ions characteristic of a calpain I. The activity accompanies the spectrin on two successive gel filtration columns and is present in both the dimer and the tetramer. It is cryptic in the ghost membrane and in purified membrane skeletons until these are dissociated, apparently because the spectrin is resistant to attack in the tetrameric state. The activity is more strongly expressed in spectrin preparations from young than from old cells. Since the bound enzyme does not detectably change the elution volume of spectrin in gel filtration, it is likely that its molecular weight is low. Its activity reveals itself only in the formation of a modified spectrin, lacking the COOH-terminal, phosphorylated portion of the beta-chain. The phosphorylated fragment (15-20 kDa) can be identified by gel electrophoresis. The proteolytically modified spectrin dimers are unable to associate with like molecules, but are univalent with respect to formation of hybrid tetramers with native spectrin. The association constant for this process is lower than that for self-association of native spectrin by a factor of only 2. The proteolytically modified spectrin behaves similarly in this respect to a truncated spectrin mutant found in a form of hereditary elliptocytosis. The latter also resembles the proteolytic product in that both give rise to the same altered NH2-terminal tryptic fragment from the alpha-chain."
https://openalex.org/W1545006834,"Tin protoporphyrin IX (SnPP) is being used in the treatment of hyperbilirubinemia. We have studied the SnPP complex with equine myoglobin (EqMb) by 1H and 119Sn nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) as a general model for SnPP interaction with hemoproteins. The complex formed from SnPP and EqMb, SnPP.EqMb, was found to have essentially the same porphyrin-binding pocket as EqMbCO, including the same porphyrin orientation in the major form of EqMbCO. 119Sn NMR spectroscopy has been used to demonstrate that the proximal His93F8-metal coordination is likely to be intact in SnPP.EqMb. Minor shifts in the side chain positions of some of the residues are indicated, possibly reflecting the presence of water in the sixth coordination site. SnPP.EqMb appears to be stable; it persists at room temperature for weeks and exhibits very slow exchange rates (2H for 1H) for a large number of amide protons in the pH range 7-9."
https://openalex.org/W1530689596,"Murine erythroleukemia cells (Friend erythroleukemia cells of a C-10-6 line) synthesized sulfated glycosaminoglycans consisting mainly of heparan sulfate (more than 95%) with a small amount of chondroitin 4-sulfate. The heparan sulfate occurred as proteoglycans, of which the cell-associated component was separated into urea-insoluble (UI) and urea-soluble (US) fractions. The UI proteoglycan consisted of a single homogeneous molecular species with an estimated Mr of 360,000 (C(UI)PG), whereas the US component was composed of two subfractions: a homogeneous species with an Mr of 280,000 (C(US)PGI) and a mixture of compounds with Mr values of less than 80,000 (C(US)PGII), which were isolated in yields of about 110, 340, and 80 micrograms of hexuronate (HexUA), respectively, from 1.37 g of an acetone powder prepared from 5.7 x 10(9) cells in the logarithmic phase of growth. The proteoglycan released into the medium (12 liters) was a single homogeneous species with an Mr of 320,000 (MPG) which was purified in a yield of 500 micrograms of hexuronate. The major, cell-associated proteoglycan, C(US)PGI, had very high contents of serine and glycine, accounting for approximately 80% of the total amino acids. This proteoglycan as well as the other two large proteoglycans, C(UI)PG and MPG, were highly resistant to degradation by various proteinases. These three proteoglycans, C(UI)PG, C(US)PGI, and MPG, had heparan sulfates with estimated Mr values of 32,000, 27,000, and 30,000. On the other hand, the Mr of the smaller proteoglycan, C(UI)PGII, was not significantly different before and after beta-elimination, indicating that it contains only a small peptide, if any. The heparan sulfate of this proteoglycan consisted of smaller and heterogeneous molecular species with Mr values of 26,000, 20,000, and 4,000. Digestion of these heparan sulfates with heparitinase I plus II resulted in almost complete depolymerization and gave six unsaturated disaccharides, delta HexUA-GlcNAc, delta HexUA-Glc-NAc(6-SO4), delta HexUA-GlcNSO3, delta HexUA-GlcNSO3 (6-SO4), delta HexUA(2-SO4)-GlcNSO3, and delta HexUA(2-SO4)-GlcNSO3(6-SO4). The relative amounts of these disaccharides generated from the individual heparan sulfates showed that an average ratio of sulfate residues to repeating disaccharide units of the C(US)PGII-derived heparan sulfate (0.97) was significantly higher than those of the other three large proteoglycan-derived glycosaminoglycans (0.54-0.70)."
