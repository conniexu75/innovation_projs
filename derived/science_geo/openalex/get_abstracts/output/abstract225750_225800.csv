Presence of these substances in seed extracts has been detected through their accelerating effect on the elongation of cells in oat coleoptiles and through their stimulating effect on the growth of tomato and pepper fruits. In studying these seed hormones, investigators have most often applied them to plants of different species from those from which they were taken. In the present investigation, which was carried out under controlled greenhouse conditions, ether-soluble hormones obtained from the immature seeds of Black Valentine bean plants were applied to seedling plants of the same variety. Vegetative growth was accelerated in this way, and the plants were made to develop flowers 3-5 days earlier than untreated ones. The magnitude of the response reflected in vegetative growth varied, depending on the stage of development of the seeds from which the extracts were made. Under the conditions of the experiment, the amount of ether-soluble hormones increased rapidly in the seeds after the fourth day following pollination, reaching a maximum on about the seventh or eighth day, and then decreased rapidly to an immeasurable amount on about the fifteenth day. The most potent extracts were obtained from seeds 3-4 mm long taken from pods that varied from 12 to 13 cm in length. Maximum rate of pod growth (increase in pod length) occurred during the first 8-10 days following pollination. Growth of the seeds (fresh weight) was most rapid subsequent to this period. The peak of extractable hormones was more closely associated with pod growth than with seed growth, but this does not mean that the hormones necessarily influenced growth of the pods (Fig. 1). The lack of extractable hormones in the case of relatively mature seeds was not due to the thickened seed coats, since these seeds, when chopped into small pieces and soaked in ether, failed to yield a measurable amount of hormones. The extracts were prepared by soaking a freshly collected sample of whole seeds in moist ether at room temperature for 18-24 hr. After the ether was separated and evaporated, lanolin was mixed with the residue to afford the desired concentration of extract in the fatty carrier. In testing this method, the residue obtained from evaporating ether alone was mixed with lanolin and the mixture was applied to test plants, with no apparent effect. In measuring the potency (cell-elongating activity) of an extract, lanolin paste containing a known amount of the extract was applied quantitatively and a-A 4* _ -"

The variations, however, always remain within the order of magnitude of the values given above. It is concluded from these findings, as well as from studies on other proteins, that peptide bonds show a band with a maximum near 185 ma and that data collected at 205 mAt mirror this band. The details of this study will be reported elsewhere."
