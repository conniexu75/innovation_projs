https://openalex.org/W2070360049,Intravenous administration of D-fructose to rats rapidly depletes liver adenosine triphosphate and inorganic phosphate; marked elevations of uric acid and allantoin in plasma follow. Concomitantly the incorporation of DL-leucine-1-(14)C into liver protein is almost completely inhibited.
https://openalex.org/W2094345944,"The intraperitoneal administration of melatonin to rats caused an increase in brain serotonin concentration, especially in the midbrain. This effect could be demonstrated within 20 minutes of melatonin administration and was not associated with changes in norepinephrine concentration."
https://openalex.org/W2062509687,"Radioactivity was found in cell bodies of neurons and glial cells throughout brains of male and female rats that had been injected with either testosterone-H(3) or estradiol-H(3). Uptake by limbic and hypothalamic structures was higher and longer lasting than that in nonlimbic structures. In all brains, the preoptic area, prepiriform cortex, olfactory tubercle, and septum had particularly high, long-lasting uptake of both hormones."
https://openalex.org/W1977142311,"L-Lactic acid was the major component in material isolated from humans that was active as an attractant for female yellow fever mosquitoes, Aedes aegypti (L.). The L(+)-isomer was several times as attractive as the D-isomer. Good correlation was found between the attractiveness of an individual to mosquitoes and the quantity of lactic acid present in an acetone washing of his hand."

https://openalex.org/W2039691324,"An analog of staphylococcal nuclease has been prepared in which all amino acids, except the six following, are fully deuterated: tryptophan; methionine; tyrosine, in ring positions 2 and 6; histidine, in ring position 2; aspartic acid and asparagine, β-methylene; and glutamic acid and glutamine, γ-methylene. The analog has a much simpler high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum than the fully protonated enzyme. The effects of calcium ion and of the inhibitor 3′,5′-thymidine diphosphate on the spectrum of the analog were readily detected."
https://openalex.org/W2085831998,Hemoglobin solutions prepared from hemolyzed human erythrocyte packs have Newtonian flow properties. Diluted solutions are also Newtonian. All solutions have a viscosity lower than the apparent viscosity of erythrocyte suspensions of equal oxygen-carrying capacity. The presence of cell debris in hemoglobin solutions causes non-Newtonian (pseudoplastic or rheopectic) flow behavior.

https://openalex.org/W1963886968,"An inhibitor of virus is demonstrable in the serums of mice infected with Plasmodium berghei. The titer of the inhibitor, detectable within 10 hours after injection of parasitized blood, increases rapidly until 30 to 40 hours when it levels off or decreases slightly before reaching a plateau. The factor that induces production of the antiviral substance is not present in the plasma of the infected blood, and the inhibitor is not detectable in serums of mice injected with nonparasitized mouse erythrocytes. The inhibitor fulfills the essential requirements of an interferon."

https://openalex.org/W2065685663,"Bergner's theoretical analysis of tracer dynamics has important applications in biology, not only for the measurement of exchangeable mass (as he demonstrated) but also for elicitation of otherwise inaccessible information on total masses of particular elements in body organs or systems—as well as in chemical engineering and geophysics."
https://openalex.org/W1974685103,"Herpes simplex virus rapidly infected the trigeminal nerves of mice after intranasal inoculation. Centripetal neural spread was suggested by histologic evidence of encephalitis in the area of attachment of the trigeminal nerve. Furthermore, electron microscopy revealed virus replication primarily within Schwann cells of the trigeminal nerve, and neurons of the gasserian ganglion."
https://openalex.org/W2094035399,"Complex patterns of time, direction, and speed of running by small nocturnal mammals in activity wheels sometimes are duplicated almost exactly from night to night. These activity pattern repetitions disclose: (i) previously unknown capabilities of biological clocks to act as sequence programmers for behavior; (ii) that animals can retain a record of the sequence and timing of their activities covering an entire night; and (iii) that the activities of one night can bias an animal toward similar behavior on subsequent nights."
https://openalex.org/W2001769867,Administration of melatonin can prevent the diurnal rhythm of serotonin concentration characteristic of the pineal organ. Whether or not such a change is induced depends upon the point in the photoperiod when the hormone is injected. This observation indicates that the action of melatonin is affected by the photic environment of the recipient.

https://openalex.org/W2019529654,"It is commonly stated that, if hemoglobin were dissolved in the blood plasma rather than enclosed in corpuscles, the viscosity of the blood would be greatly increased. We found that when the corpuscles of dog or goat blood were disrupted with ultrasound, giving a solution with the same hemoglobin concentration, the relative viscosity was drastically reduced. It appears, therefore, that the existence of blood corpuscles does not contribute to a reduced viscosity of blood."
https://openalex.org/W2022135838,"After injection of living tetrahymena into the hemocoels of male cockroaches, recovered hemolymph immobilizes washed ciliates. The immobilizing material is sensitive to heat and acid, and can be separated with ammonium sulfate. Hemolymph from immune animals confers protection in another animal into which it is injected. Immobilizing activity of the hemolymph from immune animals is associated with a nonreactive, normal protein component present in hemolymph from nonimmunized insects."
https://openalex.org/W2046118237,"Skin fibroblasts from three adult patients with chronic noncerebral Gaucher's disease, three children of one of the patients, three parents, and six normal individuals were grown in cell culture. Giant fibroblasts containing metachromatic material were seen in all cultures derived from affected individuals and heterozygous carriers but not in those derived from normal individuals."
https://openalex.org/W1984767252,1-Aminocyclopentanecarboxylic acid was cleared from cerebrospinal fluid of the cat by a saturable mechanism. Clearance was inhibited by naturally occurring neutral amino acids. Carrier transport may explain the low ratio of amino acid in spinal fluid to that in plasma.
https://openalex.org/W2090035898,In pyramidal cells synaptic activation of the entire apical dendritic tree distal to the branch point of the major shaft can dominate the neuronal firing pattern. Uniform synaptic activation of distant parts of the dendritic tree (~ 750 microns from the soma) would produce potential changes at the soma of 2 to 3 percent of the magnitude of the dendritic potential changes. Even these small somatic potential changes could modulate the frequency of firing of neurons depolarized close to or above firing level by more proximal synaptic inputs.

https://openalex.org/W2001336722,"Using the technique of laser photolysis and spectroscopy, we have observed excited singlet state absorption bands in 1,2-benzanthracene at 560 and 520 nanometers. The bands decay in less than 50 nanoseconds and are replaced by the known absorption spectrum of the lowest triplet state."
https://openalex.org/W4250013515,"Superficial calcification was produced in the normal rabbit cornea by mild irradiation with a carbon dioxide laser. The calcification was entirely extracellular and closely resemnbled that observed in human band keratopathy, which was characterized as hydroxyapatite by x-ray diffraction. The electron-mnicroscopic appearance of calcific spheriules and conglomerates in early cornteal calcification is presented. The calcific spherules arise at the basal plasma membrane surface of the epithelial cells in close relation to their basement membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2039527020,"An assessment of the response of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus to substances injected into the coelom shows that (i) foreign molecules are cleared from the coelomic fluid more rapidly than native molecules, (ii) coelomocytes can respond selectively to albumins of human and bovine origin, and (iii) immunization attempts fail to elicit accelerated coelomocyte uptake or accelerated clearance of foreign protein."
https://openalex.org/W2053464070,A calcium-selective electrode with solid ion exchanger was prepared from a solution of the calcium salt of a dialkylphosphoric acid in collodion. The electrode responds rapidly and reproducibly to activity of calcium ion and demonstrates a selective response for calcium ion in the presence of alkaline earth and alkali metal cations.
https://openalex.org/W2022505903,"Irradiation at 254 millimicrons transforms 5-ethyldeoxyuridine to deoxyuridine by way of photohydration of the 5,6 bond and elimination of ethanol. At wavelengths to the red side of 265 millimicrons, photodimerization is the principal reaction, with a pronounced oxygen effect. The results are related to the photochemistry of thymidine and of bacteriophages containing incorporated 5-ethyluracil in place of thymine."
https://openalex.org/W1999568862,"IN the past few years, a number of measurements have been made of radon-222 concentrations in mines other than uranium mines1–4. The values found, expressed in picocuries of radon per litre of air, ranged from 0.2 pCi/l. (a value typical of that occurring in the atmosphere) to several hundred pCi/l., and it was therefore considered worthwhile making similar measurements in various British coal mines. Measurements have been made in twelve mines chosen from the East Midlands, Kent and Scottish coalfields."

https://openalex.org/W2057595930,"Estradiol prevented cholesterol-induced sexual reproduction by the fungus Pythium periplocum. Inhibition by estradiol was partial at 10-(6)M and complete at 10-(5)M, the same concentrations at which cholesterol and beta-sitosterol were initially and maximally active. Higher concentrations of estradiol were required for growth inhibition than for inhibition of reproduction."

https://openalex.org/W1983701282,Variations in the position of a point on the lateral pharyngeal wall relative to the external neck wall can be monitored by time-motion display of pulsed ultrasound. Such a portrayal is used to evaluate the lateral pharyngeal wall motion in normal and pathologic speakers during connected discourse.
https://openalex.org/W2048580267,"The newly hatched laughing gull chick (Larus atricilla) begs food by pecking at the parent's dark red bill. The spectral reflectance of the bill over a range of 300 to 1200 nanometers reflects increasingly more with wavelength beginning about 575 nanometers. Because the chick shows a bimodal, true color preference in pecking, with modes at about 625 and 450 nanometers; the latter, blue peak in the spectral response curve is apparently not adapted to the natural stimulus of the parent's bill. The blue peak might thus be the result of limitations in the neural coding of color information in the chick's visual system."
