https://openalex.org/W2144430955,"The complex allotetraploid nature of the cotton genome (AADD; 2n = 52) makes genetic, genomic and functional analyses extremely challenging. Here we sequenced and assembled the Gossypium arboreum (AA; 2n = 26) genome, a putative contributor of the A subgenome. A total of 193.6 Gb of clean sequence covering the genome by 112.6-fold was obtained by paired-end sequencing. We further anchored and oriented 90.4% of the assembly on 13 pseudochromosomes and found that 68.5% of the genome is occupied by repetitive DNA sequences. We predicted 41,330 protein-coding genes in G. arboreum. Two whole-genome duplications were shared by G. arboreum and Gossypium raimondii before speciation. Insertions of long terminal repeats in the past 5 million years are responsible for the twofold difference in the sizes of these genomes. Comparative transcriptome studies showed the key role of the nucleotide binding site (NBS)-encoding gene family in resistance to Verticillium dahliae and the involvement of ethylene in the development of cotton fiber cells."

These include rapid and robust WES of DNA derived from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue, analytical output similar to data from frozen samples and clinical interpretation of WES data for prospective use. Here, we describe a prospective clinical WES platform for archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples. The platform employs computational methods for effective clinical analysis and interpretation of WES data. When applied retrospectively to 511 exomes, the interpretative framework revealed a 'long tail' of somatic alterations in clinically important genes. Prospective application of this approach identified clinically relevant alterations in 15 out of 16 patients. In one patient, previously undetected findings guided clinical trial enrollment, leading to an objective clinical response. Overall, this methodology may inform the widespread implementation of precision cancer medicine."

The mammalian hippocampus plays a critical role in learning and memory processes, by transforming input from associative neocortical regions and sending output primarily through long-distance projecting pyramidal cells (PCs) in the CA1 region. These outputs target a number of brain areas, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), and amygdala (AMG) (Cenquizca and Swanson, 2007Cenquizca L.A. Swanson L.W. Spatial organization of direct hippocampal field CA1 axonal projections to the rest of the cerebral cortex.Brain Res. Brain Res.

Heterogeneity across the CA1 PC population is recognized along the radial axis (superficial to deep), marked by differential expression of the neurochemical markers (e.g., calbindin and zinc; Figure 1A), and in long-range projection patterns (Baimbridge and Miller, 1982Baimbridge K.G.

Whereas the CA1 region as a whole is known to be the general output of the hippocampus proper, how the heterogeneous PCs integrate into the CA1 circuit remains unknown. In particular, it is unclear what the nature of the relationship is between heterogeneity of PCs (Bannister and Larkman, 1995Bannister N.J. Larkman A.U.

Diversity in the Neuronal Machine. Oxford University Press, New York2005Google Scholar). Specifically, given the heterogeneous structural and functional properties of PCs in CA1, the question arises if all PCs are regulated by essentially identical local GABAergic circuits or whether hippocampal interneurons nonuniformly target specific subpopulations of CA1 PCs. The issue of heterogeneity in target selection by cortical interneurons is controversial. Some reports suggest that local GABAergic microcircuits in various cortical areas can be selective for different postsynaptic populations (Fariñas and DeFelipe, 1991Fariñas I. DeFelipe J.

In contrast, others reported a lack of preference in target selection for a variety of neocortical interneurons, including parvalbumin- (Packer and Yuste, 2011Packer A.M. Yuste R.

Dense inhibitory connectivity in neocortex.Neuron. 2011; 69: 1188-1203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The lack of clear evidence for or against the differential regulation of distinct subpopulations of CA1 PCs by local inhibitory circuits limits our understanding of hippocampal network operations. Among local microcircuits of the hippocampus, the interactions between PCs and perisomatic-targeting, fast-spiking, parvalbumin-expressing basket cells (PVBCs) (Figure 1B) have been extensively studied and inexorably linked to hippocampal rhythmogenesis (for a review, see Buzsáki and Wang, 2012Buzsáki G. Wang X.J. Mechanisms of gamma oscillations.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 35: 203-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar). The importance of these interneurons is also highlighted by the fact that PVBCs have been implicated, both within and outside the hippocampus, in local circuit operations, learning and memory, sensory processing, and critical period plasticity; aberrant PVBC activities may also be mechanistically linked to neurological and psychiatric disorders including epilepsy, autism, and schizophrenia (Pouille and Scanziani, 2004Pouille F.

A disinhibitory microcircuit initiates critical-period plasticity in the visual cortex.Nature. 2013; 501: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Therefore, we focused on these key GABAergic cells to test the hypothesis that interneurons can be selective with respect to the heterogeneity of PC populations to nonuniformly regulate distinct hippocampal output channels. In addition, we also examined the other, nonoverlapping basket cell population, the cholecystokinin-expressing basket cells (CCKBCs) (Armstrong and Soltesz, 2012Armstrong C. Soltesz I. Basket cell dichotomy in microcircuit function.J. Physiol. 2012; 590: 683-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), since the latter cells have been shown to be highly selective in establishing perisomatic synapses with specific postsynaptic target cell populations in MEC (Varga et al., 2010Varga C. Lee S.Y. Soltesz I. Target-selective GABAergic control of entorhinal cortex output.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 822-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In order to test the relationship between PVBC and CCKBC target selection and PC heterogeneity, we used in vitro paired intracellular recordings, in vivo two-photon functional imaging in awake mice, and computational modeling. The data showed that PVBCs evoked several times greater postsynaptic currents in CA1 PCs located in the deep compared to the superficial sublayer of stratum pyramidale. In sharp contrast, CCKBCs did not show any selectivity with regard to these PC subpopulations. Analysis of reciprocal connectivity revealed greater excitation of PVBCs by superficial PCs, suggesting the existence of highly preferential excitatory-inhibitory interactions between the PC subpopulations and the PVBCs. A computational network model incorporating our experimental findings indicated that the newly uncovered, biased PC-PVBC connectivity can give rise to a preferential feedforward inhibition from the superficial to deep pyramidal cell sublayer. Furthermore, we also found that PVBCs preferentially innervated PCs projecting to the amygdala but received preferential excitatory innervation from PCs that projected to the prefrontal cortex, thus revealing directionally biased local circuit interactions between separate output channels. These results demonstrate that hippocampal local inhibitory-excitatory circuits involving PVBCs form nonuniform connectivity motifs with various heterogeneous PC populations that may contribute to the sparse and distributed structure of hippocampal network activity. In vivo, the more than 40-mm-long axonal arborization of a single PVBC in the CA1 has over 10,000 putative presynaptic boutons, covering an area of about 1 mm2 where an estimated 10,000 PCs reside (Halasy et al., 1996Halasy K. Buhl E.H. Lörinczi Z. Tamás G. Somogyi P. Synaptic target selectivity and input of GABAergic basket and bistratified interneurons in the CA1 area of the rat hippocampus.Hippocampus. 1996; 6: 306-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, Bezaire and Soltesz, 2013Bezaire M.J. Soltesz I. Quantitative assessment of CA1 local circuits: knowledge base for interneuron-pyramidal cell connectivity.Hippocampus. 2013; 23: 751-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). However, in spite of the similarity of the number of boutons and potential target cells, single PVBCs innervate only about 10% of the PCs within their axonal cloud, forming multiple, basket-like synaptic contacts on the somata and proximal dendrites of the innervated PCs (Bezaire and Soltesz, 2013Bezaire M.J. Soltesz I. Quantitative assessment of CA1 local circuits: knowledge base for interneuron-pyramidal cell connectivity.Hippocampus. 2013; 23: 751-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). If individual PVBCs do not form synapses with all potential PCs within their reach, how do they choose their poststynaptic targets? Is the target selection a random process where a given PVBC selects some PCs by chance, or do these interneurons preferentially innervate a specific subset of PCs that share some common characteristics? In order to differentiate between these two possibilities, we set out to investigate whether the innervation patterns of PVBCs are related to the heterogeneity of CA1 PCs. Namely, we first tested the hypothesis that PVBCs preferentially innervated PCs based on the location of the PCs within the deep (closer to the stratum oriens) versus superficial (closer to the stratum radiatum) sublayers of the stratum pyramidale (Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5). Next, we also examined whether preferential innervation of PCs by PVBCs existed based on the differential long-distance projection targets of the postsynaptic PCs (Figure 6). The deep/superficial PC sublayers were defined as follows (see Figure 1A; in the septal [dorsal] CA1: superficial sublayer: 0–20 μm; deep sublayer: 20–40 μm; in the temporal [ventral] CA1: superficial sublayer: 0–50 μm; deep sublayer: 50–200 μm; for detailed explanations and rationale, see Supplemental Experimental Procedures available online). In order to determine the presence or absence of sublayer-specific patterns of postsynaptic PC innervation by PVBCs, we performed paired recordings from presynaptic PVBCs and postsynaptic deep (dPCs) or superficial PCs (sPCs) in acute hippocampal slices from mice expressing tdTomato in PV+ neurons. Because PV expression alone does not unequivocally define PVBCs (since there are other PV+ cells in CA1, including the dendritically projecting bistratified cells, and the axon initial segment-targeting axoaxonic or chandelier cells), every PVBC in this study was identified based on post hoc visualization of the axonal arbor (Figure 1B). Note that, in agreement with previous morphological studies (Bannister and Larkman, 1995Bannister N.J. Larkman A.U. Dendritic morphology of CA1 pyramidal neurones from the rat hippocampus: I. Branching patterns.J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 360: 150-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), there were some morphological differences between the dPCs and sPCs, with the dPCs having larger basal dendritic trees and somata (Figures S1A–S1D). There were no differences between dPCs and sPCs in terms of their firing frequency as a function of intracellularly injected current (Figure S1E) and in input resistance (Figure S1F). However, sPCs showed more depolarized resting membrane potentials (Figure S1G) and, as reported before (Jarsky et al., 2008Jarsky T. Mady R. Kennedy B. Spruston N. Distribution of bursting neurons in the CA1 region and the subiculum of the rat hippocampus.J. Comp. Neurol. 2008; 506: 535-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), larger sag potentials in response to large hyperpolarizing current pulses (Figure S1H). Thus, sPCs and dPCs are morphologically and physiologically distinct groups. The paired recordings revealed that the synaptic currents generated by PVBCs in sPCs and dPCs were far from uniform. Rather, action potentials in PVBCs evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in dPCs that were almost three times larger than the IPSCs in sPCs, both in the septal and temporal hippocampus (Figures 1C–1E; IPSC amplitudes including both successful events and failures, referred to as “effective” unitary IPSCs [euIPCs]: septal: dPC: 65.2 ± 17.2 pA, n = 7; sPC: 19.6 ± 5.4 pA, n = 7; p < 0.05; temporal: dPC: 65.0 ± 8.3 pA, n = 17; sPC: 24.9 ± 3.9 pA, n = 22; p < 0.005). Note that the difference in IPSC amplitudes was significant also when only the successful events were considered (referred to as “unitary” IPSC amplitudes [uIPSCs]: dPC: 68.4 ± 6.9 pA, n = 24; sPC: 32.4 ± 3.5 pA, n = 29; data pooled from septal and temporal CA1, p < 0.005). Furthermore, the robust difference in IPSC amplitudes was present without a difference in connection probability (ratio of connected and unconnected pairs during the paired recordings) (Figure 1F; septal: sPCs: 50%; dPCs: 50%; temporal: sPCs: 48.9%; dPCs: 43.6%). The larger events in the dPCs were not due to a preferential spatial arrangement of the pre- with respect to the postsynaptic cells, since the somatic distances of the PVBC-sPC pairs (76.2 ± 4.7 μm; n = 38) and the PVBC-dPC pairs (70.4 ± 6.3 μm; n = 30) were not different (p > 0.5; Figure 1G; the somata of the recorded sPCs and dPCs were distributed throughout the respective sublayers [Figure 1H]; the somata of the recorded PVBCs were located in both the superficial and the deep PC sublayers and in the stratum oriens [Figure 1H]). In addition, the larger euIPSCs in dPCs compared to sPCs were also observed when the postsynaptic cells shared a common presynaptic PVBC (n = 8 sequential paired recordings; dPC: 63.8 ± 15.9 pA; sPC: 22.1 ± 5.5 pA; p < 0.001). These data demonstrated that PVBCs showed selectivity in innervation patterns with respect to their CA1 PC targets. There was, however, variability of the recorded euIPSC amplitudes within both sPC and dPC groups and overlap in recorded amplitudes between groups (see Figure 1E). While there was a correlation between distance of the postsynaptic PCs from the stratum radiatum and the euIPSC amplitude (Figure 1I; R2 = 0.389, p < 0.05, septal CA1; R2 = 0.356, p < 0.005, temporal CA1), this was driven by the overall difference between sPCs and dPCs, as no correlation remained when examining either group individually (R2 = 0.027, p = 0.22, sPC; R2 = 0.045, p = 0.20, dPC; data from temporal CA1, where the number of data points was high enough for R2 statistics even after splitting data into two groups). Rather, it appeared that there were large- and small-amplitude euIPSCs in both groups, with more “large”-amplitude euIPSCs recorded from dPCs. Therefore, we performed a K-means test for two-clusters, which indicated a “small”-amplitude euIPSC cluster with a mean of 22.5 pA, and a “large”-amplitude cluster with a mean of 82.1 pA. The recorded average euIPSCs were significantly more likely to be “large” amplitude when recorded from a dPC (3 of 22 average euIPSCs recorded from sPCs were “large” amplitude versus 10 of 17 from dPCs, p < 0.01, Pearson’s chi-square test). This suggests that, although PVBCs did evoke significantly larger events in dPCs than in sPCs on average, the location of the PC somata was not a perfect predictor of euIPSC amplitude. Therefore, in a later part of the study, we also examined euIPSC amplitudes in PCs within the same sublayer but with different projection targets (see below and Figure 6). Morphological analysis of the pairs of recorded cells revealed that PVBCs formed significantly more perisomatic axon terminals on dPCs compared to sPCs (Figures 1J and S1I; dPC: 8.7 ± 0.9, n = 10; sPC: 4.0 ± 0.6, n = 10; p < 0.005), presenting structural evidence for an unequal innervation of PCs by PVBCs in the CA1 (note that the recovery rates of somata and proximal/distal dendrites after paired recordings were similar between sPCs and dPCs, indicating that the unequal PVBC innervation of the PCs was not due to a slicing artifact; Figure S1J). The presence of more boutons from single PVBCs on dPCs versus sPCs was consistent with the larger euIPSCs in dPCs. In support of the latter mechanism involving more presynaptic terminals and thus more GABA release sites on dPCs, the PVBC-to-dPC unitary inputs were accompanied by smaller coefficient of variation (dPC: 0.61 ± 0.06, n = 17; sPC: 1.00 ± 0.06, n = 22; p < 0.001) and larger probability of success in GABA release (dPC: 0.92 ± 0.03, n = 17; sPC: 0.66 ± 0.04, n = 22; p < 0.001), without differences in short-term plasticity properties (amplitude of the second uIPSC as a percentage of the first in response to two closely spaced presynaptic action potentials; dPC: 71.6% ± 7.6%, n = 17; sPC: 88.9% ± 9.9%, n = 22; p > 0.3). Furthermore, additional morphological analysis showed that the ratio of the number of somatic versus proximal dendritic PVBC boutons was similar between PVBC-sPC and PVBC-dPC pairs (Figure 1K; p > 0.38), indicating that the differences in euIPSC amplitudes could not be explained by a higher preference for the somata of dPCs by the PVBC inputs. Next, we set out to test the above physiological and structural findings by independent means. Namely, we predicted that the total number of PVBC boutons on individual dPCs should be approximately double that of the sPCs, because the electrophysiology experiments showed that the connection probability was similar between individual PVBCs and dPCs or sPCs (suggesting similar convergence), but single PVBCs formed about twice as many boutons on dPCs compared to sPCs. Therefore, we performed an immunocytochemical analysis of the overall PV boutons on biocytin-filled individual sPCs and dPCs. In agreement with our prediction, the results showed that the number of PV+ boutons around the somata of single dPCs were approximately 2-fold higher than in the case of sPCs (dPC: 107.3 ± 7.8, n = 7; sPC: 55.0 ± 2.8, n = 5; p < 0.005) (Figures 1L and S1K). Taken together, these data indicated that a similar number of PVBCs converged onto single dPCs and sPCs, but individual PVBCs provided more boutons onto dPCs compared to sPCs. Finally, we set out to determine whether activation of a population of heterogeneous PV+ cells (and not just individual PVBCs specifically) could evoke preferentially larger inhibitory events in dPCs. Optogenetic experiments were performed in hippocampal slices from PV-ChR2 mice that expressed the excitatory opsin channelrhodopsin (ChR2) selectively in PV+ cells. Activation of PV+ interneurons with blue light while dual patch-clamp recording from a dPC and an sPC resulted in significantly larger optogentically evoked IPSCs in dPCs compared to sPCs (dPC: 382.3 ± 47.8 pA, n = 8; sPC: 141.6 ± 26.3 pA, n = 8; p < 0.005; the light-evoked events were abolished by the GABAA receptor antagonist gabazine, 20 μM, n = 3; the light-evoked IPSCs were absent in opsin-negative animals, n = 3) (Figures 1M and 1N). These optogenetic results showed that PV+ cell activation in general was able to evoke preferentially larger inhibitory synaptic events in dPCs. In order to investigate the relevance of the above-described differential synaptic arrangement between PVBCs and PCs to behaving animals, we used two-photon Ca2+ imaging to record activity from PV+ axon terminals in the CA1 PC layer of head-fixed mice running on a treadmill (Figure 2A; Kaifosh et al., 2013Kaifosh P. Lovett-Barron M. Turi G.F. Reardon T.R. Losonczy A. Septo-hippocampal GABAergic signaling across multiple modalities in awake mice.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1182-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We selectively expressed the genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator GCaMP5 (Akerboom et al., 2012Akerboom J. Chen T.W. Wardill T.J. Tian L. Marvin J.S. Mutlu S. Calderón N.C. Esposti F. Borghuis B.G. Sun X.R. et al.Optimization of a GCaMP calcium indicator for neural activity imaging.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 13819-13840Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar) in PV+ interneurons of the CA1 and focused our imaging plane to the superficial and deep PC sublayers to record Ca2+-evoked fluorescence from axonal boutons surrounding the somata of unlabeled PCs. In agreement with the previously described running-associated elevation in the firing of identified PVBCs (Varga et al., 2012Varga C. Golshani P. Soltesz I. Frequency-invariant temporal ordering of interneuronal discharges during hippocampal oscillations in awake mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: E2726-E2734Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), we observed robust increases in PV+ axonal fluorescence in each field of view (FOV) during running (gray bars under traces in Figure 2B) compared to the nonrunning state. Importantly, the running-associated increases in full-field axonal fluorescence were significantly larger in the deep compared to the superficial sublayer (Figures 2B and 2C; deep: ΔF/F = 43.4% ± 3.7%; superficial: 30.3% ± 2.4%; n = 10 superficial-deep FOV pairs in 5 mice; p < 0.05), in agreement with the electrophysiological and structural data described in the previous section. The observed larger increases in PV+ axonal fluorescence in the deep compared to the superficial sublayer could have been caused by stronger activation of PV+ boutons in the deep sublayer or the presence of more PV+ boutons in the deep sublayer or both. In order to differentiate between these possibilities, we examined the running-associated increases in fluorescence in regions of interest (ROIs) around PV+ boutons. The fluorescence of PV+ ROIs increased in both layers during running (Figure 2D), but there was no difference in the enhancement in PV+ bouton ROI fluorescence between the sublayers (Figure 2E; deep: ΔF/F = 60.4% ± 6.2%, n = 5; superficial: 59.3% ± 7.2%, n = 5; p > 0.5). The latter imaging data were in overall agreement with the in vitro electrophysiology results that indicated no differences in short-term plasticity properties at PVBC"

https://openalex.org/W2135515146,"In heart muscle cells, a region of the sarcolemmal membrane periodically invaginates to form T tubules, a specialized membrane domain that contains important ion channels regulating cell contraction. Robin Shaw and his colleagues describe how a cardiac-specific splice variant of the isoform of the protein BIN1 helps make folds in T tubules, which affects the ability of ions in the extracellular space to freely diffuse and protects the heart from arrhythmia. Cardiomyocyte T tubules are important for regulating ion flux. Bridging integrator 1 (BIN1) is a T-tubule protein associated with calcium channel trafficking that is downregulated in failing hearts. Here we find that cardiac T tubules normally contain dense protective inner membrane folds that are formed by a cardiac isoform of BIN1. In mice with cardiac Bin1 deletion, T-tubule folding is decreased, which does not change overall cardiomyocyte morphology but leads to free diffusion of local extracellular calcium and potassium ions, prolonging action-potential duration and increasing susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias. We also found that T-tubule inner folds are rescued by expression of the BIN1 isoform BIN1+13+17, which promotes N-WASP–dependent actin polymerization to stabilize the T-tubule membrane at cardiac Z discs. BIN1+13+17 recruits actin to fold the T-tubule membrane, creating a 'fuzzy space' that protectively restricts ion flux. When the amount of the BIN1+13+17 isoform is decreased, as occurs in acquired cardiomyopathy, T-tubule morphology is altered, and arrhythmia can result."

Over the last decade it has become increasingly evident that transcription is closely integrated with other DNA-related processes, such as chromatin dynamics, DNA replication, and repair. Indeed, the essential process of expressing genes comes at a cost: the movement of RNA polymerases through DNA is associated with genome instability (Aguilera and Gómez-González, 2008Aguilera A. Gómez-González B. Genome instability: a mechanistic view of its causes and consequences.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2008; 9: 204-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, Helmrich et al., 2013Helmrich A.

Svejstrup J.Q. Ubiquitylation and degradation of elongating RNA polymerase II: the last resort.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1829: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Transcribing polymerases are potent modulators of other DNA-related processes, such as DNA replication. For example, transcription-associated DNA recombination involves clashes between transcription and replication, and transcription is also associated with mutagenesis and contraction of CAG repeats, as well as breaks at chromosome fragile sites (Aguilera and Gómez-González, 2008Aguilera A. Gómez-González B. Genome instability: a mechanistic view of its causes and consequences.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2008; 9: 204-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, Helmrich et al., 2013Helmrich A.

However, the mechanisms underlying transcription-associated genome instability remain largely obscure, and little is known about factors that might have evolved to counteract it. The RECQ proteins constitute a family of conserved DNA helicases that are important for maintaining genome stability, from bacteria to humans (Chu and Hickson, 2009Chu W.K. Hickson I.D. RecQ helicases: multifunctional genome caretakers.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 644-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The human genome encodes five RECQ family members: RECQL (RECQ1), BLM (RECQ2), WRN (RECQ3), RECQL4, and RECQL5. Mutations in three of these, namely BLM, WRN, and RECQL4, give rise to hereditary disorders associated with cancer predisposition and premature aging (Bloom’s, Werner’s, and Rothmund-Thomson’s syndrome, respectively) (Chu and Hickson, 2009Chu W.K. Hickson I.D. RecQ helicases: multifunctional genome caretakers.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 644-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Moreover, Recql5 knockout mice exhibit elevated levels of sister chromatid exchange and are predisposed to various types of cancer (Hu et al., 2005Hu Y. Lu X. Barnes E. Yan M. Lou H. Luo G.

Indeed, RECQL5 has been implicated in the prevention of replication fork collapse and the accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks (Hu et al., 2009Hu Y. Lu X. Zhou G. Barnes E.L. Luo G.

Concomitant mutation in RECQL5 and another RECQ family member typically has a more severe effect than mutation in just one (see, for example, Hu et al., 2005Hu Y. Lu X. Barnes E. Yan M. Lou H. Luo G. Recql5 and Blm RecQ DNA helicases have nonredundant roles in suppressing crossovers.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3431-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, Popuri et al., 2013Popuri V.

RECQL5 plays co-operative and complementary roles with WRN syndrome helicase.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: 881-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), suggesting that RECQL5 is active in pathways distinct from those governed by other RECQ members. However, despite RECQL5 being phenotypically implicated in the preservation of genome integrity at several levels, the mechanistic basis for its function remains poorly understood. RECQL5 is unique among the RECQ family by interacting with RNAPII, and it harbors two RNAPII interaction domains, which are relevant for the phenotypes of different RECQL5-deficient metazoan cell types (Aygün et al., 2008Aygün O.

The SET2-RPB1 interaction domain of human RECQ5 is important for transcription-associated genome stability.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2011; 31: 2090-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, transcription reactions reconstituted with pure general transcription factors and RNAPII suggest that RECQL5 might act as an inhibitor of transcription (Aygün et al., 2009Aygün O. Xu X. Liu Y. Takahashi H. Kong S.E. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Svejstrup J.Q. Direct inhibition of RNA polymerase II transcription by RECQL5.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 23197-23203Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, the physiological relevance, if any, of this surprising observation has not been investigated. Likewise, the mechanistic relationship between the effects of RECQL5 mutation on genome integrity and RNAPII transcription has also remained unclear. Here, we report that RECQL5 has genome-wide effects on transcript elongation and that it suppresses genome rearrangements associated with common fragile sites and transcription stress in the body of genes. Previous experiments indicated that RECQL5 can inhibit transcription, and transcript elongation in particular, in reactions reconstituted with purified transcription proteins (Aygün et al., 2009Aygün O. Xu X. Liu Y. Takahashi H. Kong S.E. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Svejstrup J.Q. Direct inhibition of RNA polymerase II transcription by RECQL5.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 23197-23203Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To investigate its role in vivo, we performed RNAPII ChIP-seq analysis after RECQL5 depletion. RECQL5 knockdown was achieved using two different lentivirus-driven shRNAs that substantially reduced protein levels, with higher knockdown efficiency reproducibly achieved using shRNA7 than shRNA5 (Figure S1A available online). Upon RECQL5 depletion, a striking genome-wide increase in RNAPII levels over transcription start sites (TSS) was observed, with the increase in peak size correlated with knockdown level (Figure 1A). However, RECQL5 depletion had little effect on total mRNA levels, and there was no correlation between the effect of RECQL5 depletion on promoter-proximal peaks and gene expression (Spearman correlation coefficient −0.05; see Figure S1B and Table S1 for expression data), indicating that RECQL5 does not significantly affect transcription initiation frequency.Figure 1RECQL5 Depletion Changes the Profile of RNAPII across the GenomeShow full caption(A) Effect of RECQL5 knockdown with two different shRNAs on the RNAPII ChIP-seq profile.

(C) RNAPII ratio of traveling ratios for 5,140 genes after knockdown or overexpression of RECQL5, relative to that in the control (set to 1). y axes indicate percent of all genes. See also Figure S1 and Table S1. Intriguingly, an inversion of the relative RNAPII levels across genes was observed approximately 500 bp downstream from the TSS, with less RNAPII being observed in transcribed regions upon RECQL5 knockdown. This effect was again reproducibly more severe with increasing knockdown efficiency, with the highest level of RECQL5 knockdown resulting in a ∼25% decrease in RNAPII density in transcribed regions (Figure 1A). To further analyze quantitatively how RECQL5 affects transcription at the genomic level, the density of RNAPII in the promoter-proximal region relative to the gene body, previously termed the traveling ratio (Reppas et al., 2006Reppas N.B. Wade J.T. Church G.M. Struhl K. The transition between transcriptional initiation and elongation in E. coli is highly variable and often rate limiting.Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 747-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), was calculated. In accordance with our observations, the traveling ratio was globally higher in cells lacking RECQL5 compared to control cells, again with a greater effect in cells with less RECQL5 protein (Figure S1C). We note that RECQL5 chromatin immuno-precipitation (ChIP) and ChIP-seq analysis was also attempted, but that sites of RECQL5 occupancy could not be reproducibly detected, possibly because RECQL5 is lowly expressed and represents a “moving target” without appreciable DNA sequence preference. We repeated the RNAPII ChIP-seq experiments, but this time after overexpressing RECQL5 (see Figure S1D). Gratifyingly, the effect of RECQL5 overexpression on RNAPII distribution was the opposite of that observed upon knockdown: it reduced RNAPII density over the promoter and TSS and resulted in increased levels across the transcribed regions (Figure 1B). In further support of a genome-wide effect of RECQL5 overexpression, the traveling ratio moved toward lower values under these conditions (Figure S1E). The traveling ratios given above were for all genes, whether they presented a clear promoter-proximal RNAPII peak or not. Given that genes with a promoter-proximal peak are more likely to be active, we next focused on 5,140 genes with clear promoter-proximal peaks, and then asked how RECQL5 affects the traveling ratio in this group of genes. Eighty percent (4,092 of the 5,140 genes) had a decreased traveling ratio upon RECQL5 overexpression. Conversely, 76% and 88% had an increased traveling ratio upon RECQL5 knockdown with shRNA5 and shRNA7, respectively (Figure 1C). Importantly, there was a substantial overlap between the genes that responded to either loss or increase of RECQL5 expression: among the 4,092 genes whose traveling ratio decreased upon RECQL5 overexpression, 3,641 (89%) were affected in the opposite direction by RECQL5 knockdown with shRNA7 (p value for overlap: 2.08 × 10−9). Thus, the same set of genes responded to a change in RECQL5 levels. We next tested whether RECQL5 might play a role in RNAPII transcript elongation in vivo. In order to first establish an effective and specific system for regulating RECQL5 levels, we created a human cell line in which an shRNA-resistant version of RECQL5 was expressed under the control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter. This allowed stable shRNA knockdown of the endogenous version of RECQL5. In this “RECQL5-shutoff” cell line, RECQL5 is expressed at near-normal levels, but doxycycline removal results in its efficient depletion (Figure 2A). Because the levels of RECQL5 are controlled only by doxycycline, this system effectively controls for off-target effects of shRNA treatment. This cell line was used in all subsequent in vivo experiments. Singh and Padgett, 2009Singh J. Padgett R.A. Rates of in situ transcription and splicing in large human genes.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 1128-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar previously used 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole 1-beta-D ribofuranoside (DRB) to measure RNAPII transcript elongation rates in vivo. DRB inhibits P-TEFb–dependent phosphorylation of Spt5 and Serine 2 of RNAPII’s C-terminal domain (CTD), resulting in a failure of newly initiated RNAPII to progress to the elongation phase while permitting mature elongation complexes to complete transcription. DRB thus reversibly blocks new transcript elongation and in effect synchronizes the transcription cycle. Polymerases can then be concomitantly released by inhibitor removal, so that the time-resolved arrival of RNAPII at different intron-exon junctions can be assessed. Figure 2B shows how transcription through the KIFAP3 gene proceeded after DRB removal. As expected, transcription over the first, promoter-proximal exon-intron junction was indistinguishable between the two cell lines (red and purple graphs). In contrast, pre-mRNA levels at an exon-intron junction 153 kilobases (kb) downstream from the TSS rose markedly earlier in the cell line depleted for RECQL5 (10–15 min; compare blue and green graphs). This corresponds to an overall mean elongation rate across the KIFAP3 gene of 2.34 kb/min in the knockdown compared to 1.87 kb/min in the WT (i.e., a 25% rate increase in the absence of RECQL5). We similarly compared elongation rates over seven regions in long human genes, and observed an increased transcript elongation rate at most, but not all of them, with an increase of ∼20% on average (Figure 2C, compare red and black bars). Importantly, overexpression of RECQL5 gave rise to the opposite effect: it generally reduced elongation rates (compare green and black bars). The decreases were consistently more severe at genes in which greater increases were observed upon RECQL5 depletion (e.g., ITPRex5-40 and IFT80), suggesting that elongation in these regions is particularly sensitive to RECQL5 levels. Conversely, regions in which little or no change in elongation rates was observed upon RECQL5 depletion were also largely unaffected by overexpression (e.g., EFNA2 and OPA1). These results are in line with those obtained by measuring traveling ratios: the same sets of genes are affected by RECQL5 depletion and overexpression. The results are also in agreement with the RNAPII ChIP-seq results above, as faster transcript elongation will result in lower RNAPII density in the transcribed region of genes (Ehrensberger et al., 2013Ehrensberger A.H. Kelly G.P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mechanistic interpretation of promoter-proximal peaks and RNAPII density maps.Cell. 2013; 154: 713-715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We next used DRB in combination with GRO-seq analysis (Core et al., 2008Core L.J. Waterfall J.J. Lis J.T. Nascent RNA sequencing reveals widespread pausing and divergent initiation at human promoters.Science. 2008; 322: 1845-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar), hereafter called DRB/GRO-seq, as a new method to analyze RNAPII elongation rates genome-wide. In DRB/GRO-seq, the position of RNAPII in the body of genes is analyzed by extending nascent RNA with BrUTP in run-on experiments performed at different times after DRB removal (Figure 3A). BrU-labeled RNA is then purified and subjected to deep sequencing. Transcription at the CTNNBL1 gene shows the potential of the technique (Figure 3B). Prior to the release from DRB inhibition (time = 0), the vast majority of reads were observed over a narrow area near the promoter. However, as time progressed, deep sequencing reads were observed further and further into the gene (the transcription “wave front” is indicated by vertical arrows). Likewise, when assessing the data as averages across appropriately long genes (8,529 genes, >30 kb), RNAPII activity was observed at the beginning of genes at time = 0, 200–500 nucleotides downstream from the TSS, but distinct from the promoter-proximal peak (PPP) observed by RNAPII ChIP-seq (Figure 3C, time = 0, see insert). It only moved into the body of genes upon drug removal, in line with the idea that DRB inhibits phosphorylation events required for the full function of the RNAPII elongation complex. The RNAPII wave front progressed 30–40 kb into genes after 25 min (min), while it reached 80–90 kb on average 40 min after DRB removal. Having established that DRB/GRO-seq can be used to characterize transcript elongation in vivo, we now compared wild-type cells with cells lacking RECQL5 (Figure 4). Significant differences were difficult to detect at the early time points. After 40 min, however, the RNAPII-activity wave-shape was clearly altered in the RECQL5 knockdown cells, with relative depletion of polymerases in the area up to around 40 kb and with a corresponding density increase in the region from 40 kb to the transcription wave front at ∼100 kb (Figure 4A), indicating that RNAPII generally transcribed further into genes in the absence of RECQL5. Figure 4B shows a specific example in which more nascent RNAPII transcript reads were detected 80–120 kb into the CTNNNBL1 gene in the absence of RECQL5 than in normal cells (more examples in Figure S2A).Figure S2RECQL5 Inhibits Transcription Elongation, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) Individual examples of DRB/GRO-seq traces before and after RECQL5 depletion, with computer-called wave fronts indicated (stippled lines; gray-shaded areas enlarged on right).

(B) Positions of RNAPII wave fronts calculated over appropriately long genes 25’ after DRB removal. No marked difference in the position of the wave fronts is observed in the RECQL5 KD cells compared to the control. We also determined the positions of the RNAPII wave fronts at 10, 25, and 40 min in appropriately long genes (Figures 4C and S2B, and data not shown). These were selected only on size and other genomic parameters, and not on differential behavior in the two cell types, but RECQL5 affected transcript elongation rates at the majority of them. Indeed, with elongation rates varying dramatically from gene to gene, only those at which transcript elongation was very slow, or extremely fast, were unaffected by RECQL5 depletion (Figure 4C). Moreover, using the wave front positions, the median elongation rates could be calculated (Figure 4D). In keeping with recent results (Danko et al., 2013Danko C.G. Hah N. Luo X. Martins A.L. Core L. Lis J.T. Siepel A. Kraus W.L. Signaling pathways differentially affect RNA polymerase II initiation, pausing, and elongation rate in cells.Mol. Cell. 2013; 50: 212-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), transcript elongation rates close to the promoter (i.e., at the early time points) were markedly lower than during elongation further into the gene (25–40 min comparison at bottom). This also helps explain the difference between elongation rates obtained by qPCR (Figure 2C) and DRB/GRO-seq. More importantly, elongation rates were significantly higher in cells lacking RECQL5: the median elongation rate in the 25–40 min interval was 3.96 kb/min in RECQL5-depleted cells and 3.13 kb/min in wild-type cells, a rate increase of 27% in the absence of RECQL5 (p value 1.22 × 10−8) (Figure 4D). Moreover, among the randomly selected genes in which elongation rates could be confidently measured, 77.7% had increased elongation rates in the mutant in the 25–40 min interval (and 78.4% in the 10–40 min interval). Together, these experiments indicate that RECQL5 moderates transcript elongation rates genome-wide. Previous results implicated RECQL5 in maintaining genome stability, but whether this role is connected to the effects on transcript elongation established here was unclear. We used comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to investigate whether chromosomal rearrangements occur upon RECQL5 depletion, and, if so, whether such rearrangements were associated with transcription. CGH compares two genomic DNA samples to detect differences such as gains or losses of whole chromosomes or, more likely, chromosomal regions (Park, 2008Park P.J. Experimental design and data analysis for array comparative genomic hybridization.Cancer Invest. 2008; 26: 923-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A batch of RECQL5-shutoff cells grown in the presence of doxycycline was split in two and grown either in the continued presence of doxycycline (to maintain RECQL5 expression [“wild-type”]), or without it to deplete RECQL5. Genomic DNA from the two cell populations was then compared (Figure 5A, left; and 5B). Because these cells were identical at the outset, any change in copy number will have occurred during this short period of growth (10 days, typically 10–14 cell divisions). Strikingly, no less than 249 genomic losses and gains occurred in response to RECQL5 depletion in the two independent comparisons, using a log2 ratio threshold of 0.2 (Figure 5A, right). This threshold signifies that more than ∼15% of cells in the RECQL5-depleted cell population carry the particular rearrangement and therefore provides a conservative measure of the total number of genomic rearrangements taking place. The large number of genomic alterations (161 losses and 88 gains; see also Table S2) inspired us to check the basal level of genome instability in the wild-type cell line itself. This is relevant because in CGH, one of the samples (the wild-type) is defined as unchanging, and genomic rearrangements in the test sample are then described relative to this reference. Again, the cell culture was split in two, but with RECQL5 expression maintained in both, before the genomes of the clones were compared. In this CGH comparison, gains and losses cannot be distinguished, as the reference sample is arbitrarily set (e.g., a loss detected in the “test” sample might equally well be a gain in the “reference” sample). A total of 25 genomic alterations were detected in two independent experiments (16 and 9, respectively), 10-fold less than observed when RECQL5 was depleted (Figure 5A, right; Table S3). Interestingly, although the size of the rearrangements observed upon RECQL5 depletion was relatively small (median was 45 kb for losses, and 37 kb for chromosomal gains), we identified no less than 22 examples of loss (out of 65 and 96, respectively) and 10 gains (out of 36/52) that occurred in both independent experiments (Figures 5A, right, 5C, and 5D). So, around a third of the genomic rearrangements in one experiment were also detected in the other. It is obvious that the likelihood of such repetition happening by chance is miniscule. Indeed, the p value can be estimated by a permutation test and is <3 × 10−4. In contrast, none of the rearrangements detected when comparing WT with WT were recurring, and none of these unique events overlapped with the recurring RECQL5-related events. We surmised that the recurring genomic rearrangements (22 examples of loss, 10 examples of gains; Figures 5A, right; see also Figures 5C and 5D) could be key to understanding RECQL5 function, so we initially focused on these high-confidence events. When exploring common features of the regions affected, we noted that almost a third (7 of 22; p value 0.033) of the loss regions reside inside one of 124 replication-dependent, common fragile sites (CFSs) mapped in human autosomes (Fungtammasan et al., 2012Fungtammasan A.

PD is caused by polymicrobial infections and aggressive immune responses. Genomic DNA of Porphyromonas gingivalis, the best-studied bacterial pathogen associated with severe PD, is detected within atherosclerotic plaque. We examined causal relationships between chronic P. gingivalis oral infection, PD, and atherosclerosis in hyperlipidemic ApoEnull mice. ApoEnull mice (n = 24) were orally infected with P. gingivalis for 12 and 24 weeks. PD was assessed by standard clinical measurements while the aorta was examined for atherosclerotic lesions and inflammatory markers by array. Systemic inflammatory markers serum amyloid A, nitric oxide, and oxidized low-density lipoprotein were analyzed. P. gingivalis infection elicited specific antibodies and alveolar bone loss. Fluorescent in situ hybridization detected viable P. gingivalis within oral epithelium and aorta, and genomic DNA was detected within systemic organs. Aortic plaque area was significantly increased in P. gingivalis-infected mice at 24 weeks (P<0.01). Aortic RNA and protein arrays indicated a strong Th2 response. Chronic oral infection with P. gingivalis results in a specific immune response, significant increases in oral bone resorption, aortic inflammation, viable bacteria in oral epithelium and aorta, and plaque development."
https://openalex.org/W2064591654,"Aberrant expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) is associated with various human cancers. However, the role of lncRNAs in Bcr-Abl-mediated chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is unknown. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of lncRNAs in human CML cells using an lncRNA cDNA microarray and identified an lncRNA termed lncRNA-BGL3 that acted as a key regulator of Bcr-Abl-mediated cellular transformation. Notably, we observed that lncRNA-BGL3 was highly induced in response to disruption of Bcr-Abl expression or by inhibiting Bcr-Abl kinase activity in K562 cells and leukemic cells derived from CML patients. Ectopic expression of lncRNA-BGL3 sensitized leukemic cells to undergo apoptosis and inhibited Bcr-Abl-induced tumorigenesis. Furthermore, transgenic (TG) mice expressing lncRNA-BGL3 were generated. We found that TG expression of lncRNA-BGL3 alone in mice was sufficient to impair primary bone marrow transformation by Bcr-Abl. Interestingly, we identified that lncRNA-BGL3 was a target of miR-17, miR-93, miR-20a, miR-20b, miR-106a and miR-106b, microRNAs that repress mRNA of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). Further experiments demonstrated that lncRNA-BGL3 functioned as a competitive endogenous RNA for binding these microRNAs to cross-regulate PTEN expression. Additionally, our experiments have begun to address the mechanism of how lncRNA-BGL3 is regulated in the leukemic cells and showed that Bcr-Abl repressed lncRNA-BGL3 expression through c-Myc-dependent DNA methylation. Taken together, these results reveal that Bcr-Abl-mediated cellular transformation critically requires silence of tumor-suppressor lncRNA-BGL3 and suggest a potential strategy for the treatment of Bcr-Abl-positive leukemia."

To assess the chronological sequence of the abnormalities the analysis was performed at different ages (8, 16 and 24 weeks). The retinas were evaluated in terms of morphological and functional abnormalities [electroretinography (ERG)]. Histological markers of neurodegeneration (glial activation and apoptosis) were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. In addition glutamate levels and glutamate/aspartate transporter (GLAST) expression were assessed. Furthermore, to define gene expression changes associated with early diabetic retinopathy a transcriptome analyses was performed at 8 week. Furthermore, an additional interventional study to lower blood glucose levels was performed.Glial activation was higher in diabetic than in non diabetic mice in all the stages (p<0.01). In addition, a progressive loss of ganglion cells and a significant reduction of neuroretinal thickness were also observed in diabetic mice. All these histological hallmarks of neurodegeneration were less pronounced at week 8 than at week 16 and 24. Significant ERG abnormalities were present in diabetic mice at weeks 16 and 24 but not at week 8. Moreover, we observed a progressive accumulation of glutamate in diabetic mice associated with an early downregulation of GLAST. Morphological and ERG abnormalities were abrogated by lowering blood glucose levels. Finally, a dysregulation of several genes related to neurotransmission and oxidative stress such as UCP2 were found at week 8.Our results suggest that db/db mouse reproduce the features of the neurodegenerative process that occurs in the human diabetic eye. Therefore, it seems an appropriate model for investigating the underlying mechanisms of diabetes-induced retinal neurodegeneration and for testing neuroprotective drugs."

GPCRs activate heterotrimeric G proteins by catalyzing the exchange of GDP for GTP in Gα, leading to dissociation of Gα·GTP from Gβγ. Released Gα·GTP and Gβγ have independent capacities to regulate effectors such as enzymes and ion channels. Gβγ released from a variety of GPCRs directly gates G-protein-activated inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK or Kir3) channels (Betke et al., 2012Betke K.M. Wells C.A. Hamm H.E.

Direct G protein modulation of Cav2 calcium channels.Pharmacol. Rev. 2006; 58: 837-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), which influences neuronal activity throughout the brain. Typical examples of such GPCRs are the GABAB receptors that are activated by GABA, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS (Chalifoux and Carter, 2011Chalifoux J.R. Carter A.G. GABAB receptor modulation of synaptic function.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2011; 21: 339-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, Gassmann and Bettler, 2012Gassmann M. Bettler B. Regulation of neuronal GABAB receptor functions by subunit composition.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 13: 380-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Presynaptic GABAB receptors inhibit voltage-activated Ca2+ channels to reduce the release of GABA and other neurotransmitters. Postsynaptic GABAB receptors activate Kir3 channels and thus inhibit neuronal activity by local shunting or by generating hyperpolarizing postsynaptic potentials. Since GABAB receptors regulate a wide variety of physiological processes in the nervous system, including neuronal firing, synaptic plasticity, and spontaneous network oscillations, the activity of GABAB receptors needs to be temporally precise. In the continuous presence of the agonist, GABAB receptors exhibit a time-dependent decrease in receptor response to avoid prolonged effects on neuronal activity, a phenomenon referred to as desensitization (Cruz et al., 2004Cruz H.G. Ivanova T. Lunn M.L. Stoffel M. Slesinger P.A. Lüscher C. Bi-directional effects of GABAB receptor agonists on the mesolimbic dopamine system.Nat.

GABAB receptor activation desensitizes postsynaptic GABAB and A1 adenosine responses in rat hippocampal neurones.J. Physiol. 2002; 544: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It is emerging that the desensitization of GABAB receptor-activated K+ currents observed in neurons integrates distinct mechanistic underpinnings. First, protein kinases such as PKA or CaMKII regulate desensitization by directly phosphorylating the receptor and influencing its internalization from the cell surface (Couve et al., 2002Couve A. Thomas P. Calver A.R. Hirst W.D. Pangalos M.N. Walsh F.S. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation facilitates GABAB receptor-effector coupling.Nat.

USA. 2010; 107: 13924-13929Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These phosphorylation-dependent processes typically operate on timescales of minutes to hours. Second, the “regulator of G-protein signaling” protein 4 (RGS4) induces a faster form of desensitization that occurs within seconds of agonist application (Fowler et al., 2007Fowler C.E. Aryal P. Suen K.F. Slesinger P.A. Evidence for association of GABAB receptors with Kir3 channels and regulators of G protein signalling (RGS4) proteins.J. Physiol. 2007; 580: 51-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, Mutneja et al., 2005Mutneja M. Berton F. Suen K.F. Lüscher C. Slesinger P.A. Endogenous RGS proteins enhance acute desensitization of GABAB receptor-activated GIRK currents in HEK-293T cells.Pflugers Arch. 2005; 450: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). RGS proteins are “GTPase-activating proteins” (GAPs) that promote desensitization by accelerating the rate of GTP hydrolysis at Gα (Ross and Wilkie, 2000Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. GTPase-activating proteins for heterotrimeric G proteins: regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) and RGS-like proteins.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Third, we recently reported that the K+ channel tetramerization domain (KCTD)-containing proteins 8, 12, 12b, and 16 represent a novel family of proteins regulating GABAB receptor-activated K+ and Ca2+ currents (Schwenk et al., 2010Schwenk J. Metz M. Zolles G. Turecek R. Fritzius T. Bildl W. Tarusawa E. Kulik A. Unger A. Ivankova K. et al.Native GABAB receptors are heteromultimers with a family of auxiliary subunits.Nature. 2010; 465: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The KCTDs are cytoplasmic proteins that constitutively bind to the C-terminal domain of GABAB2 (Ivankova et al., 2013Ivankova K. Turecek R. Fritzius T. Seddik R. Prezeau L. Comps-Agrar L. Pin J.P. Fakler B. Besseyrias V. Gassmann M. Bettler B. Up-regulation of GABAB receptor signaling by constitutive assembly with the K+ channel tetramerization domain-containing protein 12 (KCTD12).J. Biol.

Ivankova K. et al.Native GABAB receptors are heteromultimers with a family of auxiliary subunits.Nature. 2010; 465: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), which together with GABAB1 forms obligate heteromeric GABAB(1,2) receptors. All four KCTDs accelerate the rise time of receptor-activated K+ currents while only KCTD12 and KCTD12b induce fast and pronounced current desensitization (Schwenk et al., 2010Schwenk J. Metz M. Zolles G. Turecek R. Fritzius T. Bildl W. Tarusawa E. Kulik A. Unger A. Ivankova K. et al.Native GABAB receptors are heteromultimers with a family of auxiliary subunits.Nature. 2010; 465: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, Seddik et al., 2012Seddik R. Jungblut S.P. Silander O.K. Rajalu M. Fritzius T. Besseyrias V. Jacquier V. Fakler B. Gassmann M. Bettler B. Opposite effects of KCTD subunit domains on GABAB receptor-mediated desensitization.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 39869-39877Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Desensitization is due to the particular H1 homology domain in KCTD12 and KCTD12b as well as the absence of an antagonistic H2 homology domain present in KCTD8 and KCTD16 (Seddik et al., 2012Seddik R. Jungblut S.P. Silander O.K. Rajalu M. Fritzius T. Besseyrias V. Jacquier V. Fakler B. Gassmann M. Bettler B. Opposite effects of KCTD subunit domains on GABAB receptor-mediated desensitization.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 39869-39877Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the KCTDs regulate GABAB receptor-activated K+ and Ca2+ currents is unknown. Here we show that KCTD8, KCTD12, and KCTD16 all constitutively bind to the G protein, which stabilizes the G protein at the receptor and underlies accelerated K+-current responses. In addition, selectively KCTD12 binds to the activated Gβγ subunits at their interface with Kir3 channels, thereby uncoupling Gβγ from the channels. This postreceptor mechanism of desensitization is fully reversible and rendered receptor-specific through the exclusive association of native KCTD12 protein with GABAB receptors. Thus, these findings identify a unique receptor-specific mechanism for fast desensitization of G-protein-activated K+ currents. To study the desensitization of GABAB receptor-activated K+ currents, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from CHO cells expressing GABAB receptors and Kir3 channels with or without KCTD proteins. Application of the agonist baclofen to KCTD-free or KCTD16-containing GABAB receptors elicited robust outward K+ currents that slightly, and similarly, decreased in amplitude during a 1 min application period (Figures 1A and 1B ). In contrast, KCTD12-containing GABAB receptors elicited K+ currents that almost completely desensitized (Figures 1A and 1B). The time course of KCTD12-induced desensitization was approximated by a double exponential function with time constants of 1.9 ± 0.3 s (relative contribution to desensitization 42.4% ± 11.2%) and 14.3 ± 2.0 s. The KCTD12-induced desensitization was readily reversible upon removal of baclofen. After near complete baclofen-induced desensitization, the responses to subsequent baclofen applications (Figure 1C) fully recovered with a time constant of 83.6 s (fit to the mean, Figure 1D). To investigate whether KCTD12 directly desensitizes Kir3 channels, we activated the channels in a G-protein-independent manner with 1-propanol (Aryal et al., 2009Aryal P. Dvir H. Choe S. Slesinger P.A. A discrete alcohol pocket involved in GIRK channel activation.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 988-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, Kobayashi et al., 1999Kobayashi T. Ikeda K.

G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channels are targets of alcohol action.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 1084-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In the presence of KCTD12, 1-propanol induced K+ currents with negligible desensitization (Figure 1E). Moreover, 1-propanol effectively, and similarly, activated Kir3 channels both before and after complete KCTD12-induced current desensitization obtained by applying baclofen for 60 s (Figure 1F). Likewise, 1-propanol still activated Kir3 channels during baclofen-evoked KCTD12-induced current desensitization (Figure S1 available online). Together, these results demonstrate that KCTD12-induced desensitization is fast, fully reversible, activity dependent, and operates upstream of Kir3 channels. The above results suggest that KCTD12 induces desensitization at the receptor and/or the G protein. We used a proteomic approach combining antibody-based affinity purifications (APs) with high-resolution quantitative mass spectrometry (Müller et al., 2010Müller C.S. Haupt A. Bildl W. Schindler J. Knaus H.G. Meissner M. Rammner B. Striessnig J. Flockerzi V. Fakler B. Schulte U. Quantitative proteomics of the Cav2 channel nano-environments in the mammalian brain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Kulik A. et al.High-resolution proteomics unravel architecture and molecular diversity of native AMPA receptor complexes.Neuron. 2012; 74: 621-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) to address whether G protein subunits directly interact with KCTD12 in native tissue. For APs, we equilibrated the entire pool of solubilized KCTD12 protein in mouse brain membranes with anti-KCTD12 antibodies. To control the specificity of the APs, we used membrane fractions from Kctd12 knockout (Kctd12−/−) mice (Metz et al., 2011Metz M. Gassmann M. Fakler B. Schaeren-Wiemers N. Bettler B. Distribution of the auxiliary GABAB receptor subunits KCTD8, 12, 12b, and 16 in the mouse brain.J. Comp. Neurol. 2011; 519: 1435-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) (target KO; Figure 2A). The anti-KCTD12 antibody copurified GABAB1, GABAB2 (but no other GPCRs) and the G protein subunits Gαo, Gβ1, Gβ2, and Gγ12 (Figure 2A). Copurification of the G protein subunits was also observed when KCTD12 was not associated with GABAB receptors (using Gabbr2−/− mice [Gassmann et al., 2004Gassmann M. Shaban H. Vigot R. Sansig G. Haller C. Barbieri S. Humeau Y. Schuler V. Müller M. Kinzel B. et al.Redistribution of GABAB1 protein and atypical GABAB responses in GABAB(2)-deficient mice.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6086-6097Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar] for APs; Figure 2A). This suggests that KCTD12 directly interacts with G proteins. Interactions of KCTD12 with G proteins were confirmed in APs from HEK293T cells coexpressing combinations of epitope-tagged KCTD proteins and G protein subunits. FLAG-tagged KCTD12 copurified the G protein either as a Gαβγ trimer or as a Gβγ dimer (Figure 2B). Notably, copurification of individual G protein subunits with KCTD12 either failed (Gβ, Gγ) or was very inefficient (Gαo). APs with purified recombinant KCTD12 and Gβ1γ2 proteins confirmed that these proteins directly interact with each other (Figure S2). These results identify the Gβγ dimer as the primary interaction partner of KCTD12 (Figure 2B). Experiments with KCTD8 and KCTD16 confirmed that all KCTD subunits of GABAB receptors bind to Gβγ (Figure 2C). We next tested in transfected CHO cells whether KCTD12 desensitizes K+ currents by directly acting at the G protein. For this purpose, we activated Kir3 channels in a receptor-independent manner with the nonhydrolysable GTP-analog guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPγS), which we perfused into the cell via the recording pipette (Figure 3A). By exchanging for GDP at Gα, GTPγS liberates Gβγ and constitutively activates Kir3 channels (Breitwieser and Szabo, 1988Breitwieser G.E. Szabo G.

In the absence of KCTDs or in the presence of KCTD16, GTPγS induced slowly rising inwardly rectifying K+ currents that exhibited modest desensitization over the 10 min recording period (Figures 3A and 3B). In contrast, in the presence of KCTD12 the currents exhibited pronounced desensitization eventually leading to a decrease in amplitudes close to baseline (Figures 3A and 3B). Similar results for KCTD12-induced desensitization were obtained when Kir3 channels were activated by GTPγS in the presence of either wild-type (WT) GABAB receptors or mutant Y902A-GABAB2 receptors that are unable to bind KCTD12 (Correale et al., 2013Correale S. Esposito C. Pirone L. Vitagliano L. Di Gaetano S. Pedone E. A biophysical characterization of the folded domains of KCTD12: insights into interaction with the GABAB2 receptor.J. Mol.

These results demonstrate that KCTD12-induced Kir3 current desensitization requires activation of the G protein but does not require assembly of KCTD12 with GABAB receptors. Moreover, since GTPγS is nonhydrolysable, these experiments show that KCTD12 does not promote desensitization through GAP activity at Gα (Mutneja et al., 2005Mutneja M. Berton F. Suen K.F. Lüscher C.

Rather, the results point to an activity-dependent interaction of KCTD12 with the G protein, in addition to the constitutive interaction that KCTD12 shares with KCTD8 and KCTD16 (Figure 2). Indeed, constitutive activation of the G protein with AlF4− selectively increased KCTD12 binding to Gβγ, consistent with an activity-dependent binding site on Gβγ that is unique to KCTD12 (Figure 3C). We next studied whether KCTD12 and KCTD16 differentially influence G protein conformational rearrangements during G protein activation, using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) experiments in transfected CHO cells (Digby et al., 2006Digby G.J. Lober R.M. Sethi P.R. Lambert N.A. Some G protein heterotrimers physically dissociate in living cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 17789-17794Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, Frank et al., 2005Frank M. Thümer L. Lohse M.J. Bünemann M. G Protein activation without subunit dissociation depends on a Gαi-specific region.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24584-24590Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) (Figures 3D and 3E). Indeed, KCTD12 but not KCTD16 induced a significant increase in the magnitude of the BRET change during G protein activation. Moreover, reassociation of the G protein was slowed in the presence of KCTD12 (Figures 3D and 3F). Altogether, the data are compatible with KCTD12 influencing conformational changes of the G protein and/or increasing steady-state G protein dissociation in an activity-dependent manner. With native GABAB receptors where GABAB(1,2), KCTD12, and the G protein reside in close proximity (Schwenk et al., 2010Schwenk J. Metz M. Zolles G. Turecek R. Fritzius T. Bildl W. Tarusawa E. Kulik A. Unger A. Ivankova K. et al.Native GABAB receptors are heteromultimers with a family of auxiliary subunits.Nature. 2010; 465: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), constitutive and activity-dependent binding of KCTD12 to Gβγ may be envisaged as follows: receptor activation of the G protein, which is stabilized at the receptor via constitutive binding to KCTD12, promotes both activation of Kir3 channels and activity-dependent interaction of KCTD12 with Gβγ. Competition between KCTD12 and Kir3 channels for Gβγ reduces steady-state Gβγ interaction with the channels, which desensitizes the current response. Finally, the Gα·GDP subunit displaces KCTD12 from its activity-dependent binding site on Gβγ and reconstitutes the heterotrimeric G protein, which renders the desensitization mechanism reversible. To address whether KCTD12 occludes the channel binding site of Gβγ (Ford et al., 1998Ford C.E. Skiba N.P. Bae H. Daaka Y. Reuveny E. Shekter L.R. Rosal R. Weng G. Yang C.S.

MacKinnon R. X-ray structure of the mammalian GIRK2-βγ G-protein complex.Nature. 2013; 498: 190-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), we used a peptide derived from the Gβγ binding site of the Kir3.4 protein (Figure 4A). This Kir3.4-peptide inhibits Gβγ activation of Kir3 channels with an IC50 of 0.6 μM (Krapivinsky et al., 1998Krapivinsky G. Kennedy M.E. Nemec J. Medina I. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Gβγ binding to GIRK4 subunit is critical for G protein-gated K+ channel activation.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16946-16952Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Perfusion of the Kir3.4-peptide (40 μM) into CHO cells expressing GABAB receptors and Kir3 channels resulted in strong desensitization of the K+ currents during a 15 min baclofen application (Figure 4B, middle). The peptide-induced desensitization was slowly reversible; a 7 min period showed recovery of the baclofen response to about half of the initial peak current amplitude (Figures 4B, middle, and 4C), while complete recovery was obtained in the absence of the peptide (Figures 4B, top, and 4C). In the combined presence of KCTD12 and Kir3.4-peptide, the desensitization was faster than with the peptide alone (Figure 4B, bottom). However, a close to complete recovery of the peak K+ current amplitude was obtained within the 7 min period, showing that KCTD12 significantly counteracted the lasting inhibitory effect of the Kir3.4-peptide (Figures 4B, bottom, and 4C). The most likely explanation of these data is that KCTD12 efficiently competes with the Kir3.4-peptide for binding to activated Gβγ. While allosteric effects of KCTD12 on Kir3.4-peptide binding cannot be fully ruled out, we consider this possibility less likely. The Gβγ dimer is assumed to be a relatively rigid scaffold for protein binding and its X-ray structure remains unperturbed when bound to various peptides or effectors (Lin and Smrcka, 2011Lin Y.

Biophys. 2006; 39: 117-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Moreover, in our experiments, KCTD12 was unable to displace the Kir3.4 peptide once bound to Gβγ (Figure S3). Similar to KCTD12, GPCR kinase 2 (GRK2) binds to Gβγ and induces fast desensitization of GPCR-activated Kir3 currents in heterologous cells (Raveh et al., 2010Raveh A. Cooper A. Guy-David L. Reuveny E. Nonenzymatic rapid control of GIRK channel function by a G protein-coupled receptor kinase.Cell. 2010; 143: 750-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Because KCTD12 and GRK2 share no sequence or structural similarity, we compared the properties of the desensitization induced by the two proteins. Expression of GRK2 in CHO cells increased desensitization of baclofen-activated Kir3 currents by ∼30% (Figures 5A and 5C ). In contrast to KCTD12-induced desensitization, the GRK2-induced desensitization was irreversible within a 10 min period (Figures 5A and 5D). Moreover, the GRK2-induced desensitization was prevented by gallein (Figures 5B and 5C), a compound binding with high-affinity to the protein-protein interaction “hot spot” of Gβγ (Lehmann et al., 2008Lehmann D.M. Seneviratne A.M. Smrcka A.V. Small molecule disruption of G protein βγ subunit signaling inhibits neutrophil chemotaxis and inflammation.Mol.

Evidence that a protein-protein interaction ‘hot spot’ on heterotrimeric G protein βγ subunits is used for recognition of a subclass of effectors.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 767-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Gallein and selenocystamine (Dessal et al., 2011Dessal A.L. Prades R. Giralt E. Smrcka A.V. Rational design of a selective covalent modifier of G protein βγ subunits.Mol. Pharmacol. 2011; 79: 24-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), a structurally unrelated compound that also binds to the “hot spot,” did not prevent KCTD12-induced desensitization (Figure 5E). Thus, KCTD12 and GRK2 binding differs in its sensitivity to compounds that bind to the “hot spot” of Gβ. Nonetheless, as GRK2 and KCTD12 can displace each other from Gβγ (Figure S4), the binding domains of the two proteins overlap, probably in the channel-binding area on Gβγ. If KCTD12 induces desensitization by acting at Gβγ, it should not only desensitize GABAB-activated Kir3 currents but also those activated by other GPCRs, as long as there is free KCTD12 available to bind to G proteins. Indeed, we observed KCTD12-induced desensitization in heterologous cells with various GPCRs. For example, activation of adenosine A1 (Figure 6A) or mGlu2 receptors (Figures S5A and S5C) in the presence of KCTD12 in transfected CHO cells yielded desensitizing Kir3 currents. Activation of mutant Y902A-GABAB2 receptors that cannot bind KCTD12 gave rise to strongly desensitizing Kir3 currents in Xenopus oocytes only after injection of KCTD12 cRNA in large excess over GABAB receptor cRNA (ratio of 32:1; Figure 6B).

Here we demonstrate the divergent roles of ATP and adenosine released by bone osteocytes on breast cancers. We showed that conditioned media (CM) collected from osteocytes treated with alendronate (AD), a bisphosphonate drug, inhibited the migration of human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. Removal of the extracellular ATP by apyrase in CM abolished this effect, suggesting the involvement of ATP. ATP exerted its inhibitory effect through the activation of purinergic P2X receptor signaling in breast cancer cells evidenced by the attenuation of the inhibition by an antagonist, oxidized ATP, as well as knocking down P2X7 with small interfering RNA (siRNA), and the inhibition of migration by an agonist, BzATP. Intriguingly, ATP had a biphasic effect on breast cancer cells—lower dosage inhibited but higher dosage promoted its migration. The stimulatory effect on migration was blocked by an adenosine receptor antagonist, MRS1754, ARL67156, an ecto-ATPase inhibitor, and A2A receptor siRNA, suggesting that in contrast to ATP, adenosine, a metabolic product of ATP, promoted migration of breast cancer cells. Consistently, non-hydrolyzable ATP, ATPγS, only inhibited but did not promote cancer cell migration. ATP also had a similar inhibitory effect on the Py8119 mouse mammary carcinoma cells; however, adenosine had no effect owing to the absence of the A2A receptor. Consistently, ATPγS inhibited, whereas adenosine promoted anchorage-independent growth of MDA-MB-231 cells. Our in vivo xenograft study showed a significant delay of tumor growth with the treatment of ATPγS. Moreover, the extent of bone metastasis in a mouse intratibial model was significantly reduced with the treatment of ATPγS. Together, our results suggest the distinct roles of ATP and adenosine released by osteocytes and the activation of corresponding receptors P2X7 and A2A signaling on breast cancer cell growth, migration and bone metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2054121642,"Background Fructans, such as inulin, are dietary fibers which stimulate gastro-intestinal (GI) function acting as prebiotics. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) impairs GI motility, through production of reactive oxygen species. The antioxidant activity of various fructans was tested and the protective effect of inulin on colonic smooth muscle cell (SMC) impairment, induced by exposure of human mucosa to LPS, was assessed in an ex vivo experimental model. Methods The antioxidant capacity of fructans was measured in an in vitro system that simulates cooking and digestion processes. Human colonic mucosa and submucosa, obtained from disease-free margins of resected segments for cancer, were sealed between two chambers, with the mucosal side facing upwards with Krebs solution with or without purified LPS from a pathogenic strain of Escherichia coli (O111:B4) and inulin (Frutafit IQ), and the submucosal side facing downwards into Krebs solution. The solutions on the submucosal side were collected following mucosal exposure to Krebs in the absence (N-undernatant) or presence of LPS (LPS-undernatant) or LPS+inulin (LPS+INU-undernatant). Undernatants were tested for their antioxidant activity and the effects on SMCs contractility. Inulin protective effects on mucosa and submucosa layers were assessed measuring the protein oxidation level in the experimental conditions analyzed. Results Antioxidant activity of inulin, which was significantly higher compared to simple sugars, remained unaltered despite cooking and digestion processes. Inulin protected the mucosal and submucosal layers against protein oxidation. Following exposure to LPS-undernatant, a significant decrease in maximal acetylcholine (Ach)-induced contraction was observed when compared to the contraction induced in cells incubated with the N-undernatant (4±1% vs 25±5% respectively, P<0.005) and this effect was completely prevented by pre-incubation of LPS with Inulin (35±5%). Conclusions Inulin protects the human colon mucosa from LPS-induced damage and this effect appears to be related to the protective effect of inulin against LPS-induced oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2115728162,"In spite of the high relevance of lumbricid earthworms (‘Oligochaeta’: Lumbricidae) for soil structure and functioning, the taxonomy of this group of terrestrial invertebrates remains in a quasi-chaotic state. Earthworm taxonomy traditionally relies on the interpretation of external and internal morphological characters, but the acquisition of these data is often hampered by tedious dissections or restricted access to valuable and rare museum specimens. The present state of affairs, in conjunction with the difficulty of establishing primary homologies for multiple morphological features, has led to an almost unrivaled instability in the taxonomy and systematics of certain earthworm groups, including Lumbricidae. As a potential remedy, we apply for the first time a non-destructive imaging technique to lumbricids and explore the future application of this approach to earthworm taxonomy. High-resolution micro-computed tomography (μCT) scanning of freshly fixed and museum specimens was carried out using two cosmopolitan species, Aporrectodea caliginosa and A. trapezoides. By combining two-dimensional and three-dimensional dataset visualization techniques, we demonstrate that the morphological features commonly used in earthworm taxonomy can now be analyzed without the need for dissection, whether freshly fixed or museum specimens collected more than 60 years ago are studied. Our analyses show that μCT in combination with soft tissue staining can be successfully applied to lumbricid earthworms. An extension of the approach to other families is poised to strengthen earthworm taxonomy by providing a versatile tool to resolve the taxonomic chaos currently present in this ecologically important, but taxonomically neglected group of terrestrial invertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2026126870,"Dancing and singing to music involve auditory-motor coordination and have been essential to our human culture since ancient times. Although scholars have been trying to understand the evolutionary and developmental origin of music, early human developmental manifestations of auditory-motor interactions in music have not been fully investigated. Here we report limb movements and vocalizations in three- to four-months-old infants while they listened to music and were in silence. In the group analysis, we found no significant increase in the amount of movement or in the relative power spectrum density around the musical tempo in the music condition compared to the silent condition. Intriguingly, however, there were two infants who demonstrated striking increases in the rhythmic movements via kicking or arm-waving around the musical tempo during listening to music. Monte-Carlo statistics with phase-randomized surrogate data revealed that the limb movements of these individuals were significantly synchronized to the musical beat. Moreover, we found a clear increase in the formant variability of vocalizations in the group during music perception. These results suggest that infants at this age are already primed with their bodies to interact with music via limb movements and vocalizations."
https://openalex.org/W2139549981,"Identifying communities or clusters in networked systems has received much attention across the physical and social sciences. Most of this work focuses on single layer or one-mode networks, including social networks between people or hyperlinks between websites. Multilayer or multi-mode networks, such as affiliation networks linking people to organizations, receive much less attention in this literature. Common strategies for discovering the community structure of multi-mode networks identify the communities of each mode simultaneously. Here I show that this combined approach is ineffective at discovering community structures when there are an unequal number of communities between the modes of a multi-mode network. I propose a dual-projection alternative for detecting communities in multi-mode networks that overcomes this shortcoming. The evaluation of synthetic networks with known community structures reveals that the dual-projection approach outperforms the combined approach when there are a different number of communities in the various modes. At the same time, results show that the dual-projection approach is as effective as the combined strategy when the number of communities is the same between the modes."

Automated blood culture (BACTEC) was performed for all cases and unwell controls.Prevalence of pathogenic bacterial species amongst infants with NE was 3.6%, 6.9% and 8.9%, with culture, PCR and both tests in combination, respectively. More encephalopathic infants than controls had pathogenic bacterial species detected (8.9%vs2.0%, p = 0.028) using culture and PCR in combination. PCR detected bacteremia in 11 culture negative encephalopathic infants (3 Group B Streptococcus, 1 Group A Streptococcus, 1 Staphylococcus aureus and 6 Enterobacteriacae). Coagulase negative staphylococcus, frequently detected by PCR amongst case and control infants, was considered a contaminant. Prevalence of CMV, HSV and malaria amongst cases was low (1.5%, 0.5% and 0.5%, respectively).This real-time PCR panel detected more bacteremia than culture alone and provides a novel tool for detection of neonatal bloodstream pathogens that may be applied across a range of clinical situations and settings.

Methods Immortalized human corneal epithelial cells were grown to confluency on curved cellulose filters for seven days, and were then differentiated and stratified using an air-liquid interface for seven days before testing. Varying concentrations of a commercial ophthalmic solution containing benzalkonium chloride (BAK), a known cytotoxic agent, and two relevant ocular surfactants were tested on the model. A whole balafilcon A lens soaked in phosphate buffered saline (BA PBS) was also used to assess biocompatibility and verify the validity of the model. Viability assays as well as flow cytometry were performed on the cells to investigate changes in cell death and integrin expression. Results The reconstructed curved corneal epithelium was composed of 3–5 layers of cells. Increasing concentrations of BAK showed dose-dependent decreased cell viability and increased integrin expression and cell death. No significant change in viability was observed in the presence of the surfactants. As expected, the BA PBS combination appeared to be very biocompatible with no adverse change in cell viability or integrin expression. Conclusions The stratified, curved, epithelial model proved to be sensitive to distinct changes in cytotoxicity and is suitable for continued assessment for biocompatibility testing of contact lenses. Our results showed that flow cytometry can provide a quantitative measure of the cell response to biomaterials or cytotoxic compounds for both the supernatant and adherent cell populations. As a specifically designed in vitro model of the corneal epithelium, this quantitative model for biocompatibility at the ocular surface may help improve our understanding of cell-material interactions and reduce the use of animal testing."
https://openalex.org/W2045399762,"Introduction The natural history of HIV-1 infection and its progression towards AIDS vary considerably among individuals. Host genetic factors may be one of the possible reasons for variable HIV-1 disease progression. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region of TNF-α gene can influence its production. The aim of the present study was to determine the association of functional TNF-α SNPs and its associated parameters related to apoptosis that may influence the rate of HIV-1 disease progression. Methods Therapy naive, 100 HIV slow progressors (SPs), 100 HIV fast progressors (FPs), 50 HIV exposed but seronegative individuals (ESNs) and 260 healthy controls from same ethnic origin were recruited. Genotyping of TNF-α variants (−863C/A, -308G/A and -238G/A) was done using PCR-RFLP. CD4 counts were determined by flow cytometry. Plasma viral load was estimated by COBAS AMPLICOR HIV-1 monitor test. Plasma TNF-α concentration was estimated by Human CBA Th1/Th2 cytokine kit. The lymphocyte mitochondrial membrane potential was measured by JC-1 dye by flow cytometry. Results Genotype and allele frequency of TNF-α -238G/A and -863C/A was not significantly different in HIV-1-infected patients when compared to controls, while that of TNF-α -308G/A variant (high TNF-α producer) was significantly higher in FPs compared to SPs (p<0.01, OR = 3.43). Haplotype analyses also showed that carriers of high TNF-α producing haplotype CAG was significantly more common among FPs compared to SPs (p<0.01, OR = 3). The circulating TNF-α levels in blood also correlated well with genotypes. The lymphocyte mitochondrial membrane potential of FPs having CAG haplotype was significantly low as compared to wild type (CGG) haplotype (417±22 vs 571±28, p<0.01). Conclusion High producer haplotype, CAG of TNF-α gene associates with enhanced apoptosis of lymphocytes in HIV-1 infected individuals, hence faster progression to AIDS. However, further functional studies are needed to confirm this association and this knowledge may help clinicians to better understand the disease outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2023910179,"Helicobacter pylori is the strongest risk factor for the development of gastric cancer. Although the specific mechanisms by which this pathogen induces carcinogenesis have not been fully elucidated, high-expression interleukin (IL)-1β alleles are associated with increased gastric cancer risk among H. pylori-infected persons. In addition, loss of matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7) increases mucosal inflammation in mouse models of epithelial injury, and we have shown that gastric inflammation is increased in H. pylori-infected MMP7−/− C57BL/6 mice. In this report, we define mechanisms that underpin such responses and extend these results into a genetic model of MMP7 deficiency and gastric cancer. Wild-type (WT) or MMP7−/− C57BL/6 mice were challenged with broth alone as an uninfected control or the H. pylori strain PMSS1. All H. pylori-challenged mice were successfully colonized. As expected, H. pylori-infected MMP7−/− C57BL/6 mice exhibited a significant increase in gastric inflammation compared with uninfected or infected WT C57BL/6 animals. Loss of MMP7 resulted in M1 macrophage polarization within H. pylori-infected stomachs, as assessed by Luminex technology and immunohistochemistry, and macrophages isolated from infected MMP7-deficient mice expressed significantly higher levels of the M1 macrophage marker IL-1β compared with macrophages isolated from WT mice. To extend these findings into a model of gastric cancer, hypergastrinemic WT INS-GAS or MMP7−/− INS-GAS mice were challenged with H. pylori strain PMSS1. Consistent with findings in the C57BL/6 model, H. pylori-infected MMP7-deficient INS-GAS mice exhibited a significant increase in gastric inflammation compared with either uninfected or infected WT INS-GAS mice. In addition, the incidence of gastric hyperplasia and dysplasia was significantly increased in H. pylori-infected MMP7−/− INS-GAS mice compared with infected WT INS-GAS mice, and loss of MMP7 promoted M1 macrophage polarization. These results suggest that MMP7 exerts a restrictive role on H. pylori-induced gastric injury and the development of premalignant lesions by suppressing M1 macrophage polarization."
https://openalex.org/W1974459944,"Adiponectin is an adipokine that sensitizes the body to insulin. Low levels of adiponectin have been reported in obesity, diabetes and periodontitis. In this study we established experimental periodontitis in male adiponectin knockout and diet-induced obesity mice, a model of obesity and type 2 diabetes, and aimed at evaluating the therapeutic potential of adiponectin. We found that systemic adiponectin infusion reduced alveolar bone loss, osteoclast activity and infiltration of inflammatory cells in both periodontitis mouse models. Furthermore, adiponectin treatment decreased the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in white adipose tissue of diet-induced obesity mice with experimental periodontitis. Our in vitro studies also revealed that forkhead box O1, a key transcriptional regulator of energy metabolism, played an important role in the direct signaling of adiponectin in osteoclasts. Thus, adiponectin increased forkhead box O1 mRNA expression and its nuclear protein level in osteoclast-precursor cells undergoing differentiation. Inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling decreased nuclear protein levels of forkhead box O1. Furthermore, over-expression of forkhead box O1 inhibited osteoclastogenesis and led to decreased nuclear levels of nuclear factor of activated T cells c1. Taken together, this study suggests that systemic adiponectin application may constitute a potential intervention therapy to ameliorate type 2 diabetes-associated periodontitis. It also proposes that adiponectin inhibition of osteoclastogenesis involves forkhead box O1."

The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxic effects of MEHP on human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVEC) and its possible molecular mechanism. HUVEC cells were treated with MEHP (0, 6.25, 12.5, 25,50 and 100 µM), and the cellular apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane potential as well as intracellular reactive oxygen species were determined. In present study, MEHP induced a dose-dependent cell injury in HUVEC cell via an apoptosis pathway as characterized by increased percentage of sub-G1, activation of caspase-3, -8and -9, and increased ratio of Bax/bcl-2 mRNA and protein expression as well as cytochrome C releasing. In addition, there was obvious oxidative stress, represented by decreased glutathione level, increased malondialdehyde level and superoxide dismutase activity. N-Acetylcysteine, as an antioxidant that is a direct reactive oxygen species scavenger, could effectively block MEHP-induced reactive oxygen species generation, mitochondrial membrane potential loss and cell apoptosis. These data indicated that MEHP induced apoptosis in HUVEC cells through a reactive oxygen species-mediated mitochondria-dependent pathway."

In our previous study, a pathway for P3HP production was constructed in recombinant Esecherichia coli. Seven exogenous genes in P3HP synthesis pathway were carried by two plasmid vectors. However, the P3HP production was severely suppressed by strain instability due to plasmid loss. In this paper, two strategies, chromosomal gene integration and plasmid addiction system (PAS) based on amino acid anabolism, were applied to construct a genetically stable strain. Finally, a combination of those two methods resulted in the best results. The resultant strain carried a portion of P3HP synthesis genes on chromosome and the others on plasmid, and also brought a tyrosine-auxotrophy based PAS. In aerobic fed-batch fermentation, this strain produced 25.7 g/L P3HP from glycerol, about 2.5-time higher than the previous strain with two plasmids. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest P3HP production from inexpensive carbon sources."
https://openalex.org/W2077861279,"Background The anti-influenza virus activity of green tea catechins has been demonstrated in experimental studies, but clinical evidence has been inconclusive. School-aged children play an important role in the infection and spread of influenza in the form of school-based outbreaks. Preventing influenza infection among students is essential for reducing the frequency of epidemics and pandemics. As a non-pharmaceutical intervention against infection, gargling is also commonly performed in Asian countries but has not yet been extensively studied. Methods and Findings A randomized, open label, 2-group parallel study of 757 high school students (15 to 17 years of age) was conducted for 90 days during the influenza epidemic season from December 1st, 2011 to February 28th, 2012, in 6 high schools in Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan. The green tea gargling group gargled 3 times a day with bottled green tea, and the water gargling group did the same with tap water. The water group was restricted from gargling with green tea. The primary outcome measure was the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza using immunochromatographic assay for antigen detection. 757 participants were enrolled and 747 participants completed the study (384 in the green tea group and 363 in the water group). Multivariate logistic regression indicated no significant difference in the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza between the green tea group (19 participants; 4.9%) and the water group (25 participants; 6.9%) (adjusted OR, 0.69; 95%CI, 0.37 to 1.28; P = 0.24). The main limitation of the study is the adherence rate among high school students was lower than expected. Conclusions Among high school students, gargling with green tea three times a day was not significantly more efficacious than gargling with water for the prevention of influenza infection. In order to adequately assess the effectiveness of such gargling, additional large-scale randomized studies are needed. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01225770"
https://openalex.org/W2018101299,"Dysregulation of the astroglial glutamate transporters GLAST and GLT-1 has been implicated in several neurodegenerative disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) where a loss of GLT-1 protein expression and activity is reported. Furthermore, the two principal C-terminal splice variants of GLT-1 (namely GLT-1a and GLT-1b) show altered expression ratio in animal models of this disease. Considering the putative link between inflammation and excitotoxicity, we have here characterized the influence of TNF-α on glutamate transporters in cerebral cortical astrocyte cultures from wild-type rats and from a rat model of ALS (hSOD1G93A). Contrasting with the down-regulation of GLAST, a 72 h treatment with TNF-α substantially increased the expression of GLT-1a and GLT-1b in both astrocyte cultures. However, as the basal level of GLT-1a appeared considerably lower in hSOD1G93A astrocytes, its up-regulation by TNF-α was insufficient to recapitulate the expression observed in wild-type astrocytes. Also the glutamate uptake activity after TNF-α treatment was lower for hSOD1G93A astrocytes as compared to wild-type astrocytes. In the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, TNF-α did not influence GLT-1 isoform expression, suggesting an active role of dynamically regulated protein partners in the adaptation of astrocytes to the inflammatory environment. Confirming the influence of inflammation on the control of glutamate transmission by astrocytes, these results shed light on the regulation of glutamate transporter isoforms in neurodegenerative disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2060938180,"Background Dengue is the most important mosquito-borne viral disease in the world. Dengue virus infection may be asymptomatic or lead to undifferentiated fever, dengue fever with or without warning signs, or severe dengue. Lower respiratory symptoms are unusual and lung-imaging data in patients with dengue are scarce. Methodology/Principal Findings To evaluate lung changes associated with dengue infection, we retrospectively analyzed 2,020 confirmed cases of dengue. Twenty-nine of these patients (11 females and 18 males aged 16–90 years) underwent chest computed tomography (CT), which yielded abnormal findings in 17 patients: 16 patients had pleural effusion (the sole finding in six patients) and 11 patients had pulmonary abnormalities. Lung parenchyma involvement ranged from subtle to moderate unilateral and bilateral abnormalities. The most common finding was ground-glass opacity in eight patients, followed by consolidation in six patients. Less common findings were airspace nodules (two patients), interlobular septal thickening (two patients), and peribronchovascular interstitial thickening (one patient). Lung histopathological findings in four fatal cases showed thickening of the alveolar septa, hemorrhage, and interstitial edema. Conclusions/Significance In this largest series involving the use of chest CT to evaluate lung involvement in patients with dengue, CT findings of lower respiratory tract involvement were uncommon. When abnormalities were present, pleural effusion was the most frequent finding and lung involvement was often mild or moderate and bilateral. Extensive lung abnormalities are infrequent even in severe disease and when present should lead physicians to consider other diagnostic possibilities."
https://openalex.org/W2070917047,"Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) are latent cytoplasmic transcription factors linking extracellular signals to target gene transcription. Hematopoietic cells express two highly conserved STAT5-isoforms (STAT5A/STAT5B), and STAT5 is directly activated by JAK2 downstream of several cytokine receptors and the oncogenic BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase. Using an IL-3-dependent cell line with inducible BCR-ABL-expression we compared STAT5-activation by IL-3 and BCR-ABL in a STAT5-isoform specific manner. RNAi targeting of STAT5B strongly inhibits BCR-ABL-dependent cell proliferation, and STAT5B but not STAT5A is essential for BCL-XL-expression in the presence of BCR-ABL. Although BCR-ABL induces STAT5-tyrosine phosphorylation independent of JAK2-kinase activity, BCR-ABL is less efficient in inducing active STAT5A:STAT5B-heterodimerization than IL-3, leaving constitutive STAT5A and STAT5B-homodimerization unaffected. In comparison to IL-3, nuclear accumulation of a STAT5A-eGFP fusion protein is reduced by BCR-ABL, and BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activity induces STAT5A-eGFP translocation to the cell membrane and co-localization with the IL-3 receptor. Furthermore, BCR-ABL-dependent phosphorylation of Y682 in STAT5A was detected by mass-spectrometry. Finally, RNAi targeting STAT5B but not STAT5A sensitizes human BCR-ABL-positive cell lines to imatinib-treatment. These data demonstrate differences between IL-3 and BCR-ABL-mediated STAT5-activation and isoform-specific effects, indicating therapeutic options for isoform-specific STAT5-inhibition in BCR-ABL-positive leukemia."
https://openalex.org/W1977283973,"Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is extensively phosphorylated in cells within a region amino-terminal to the leucine-rich repeat domain. Since phosphorylation in this region of LRRK2, including Ser910, Ser935, Ser955, and Ser973, is significantly downregulated upon treatment with inhibitors of LRRK2, it has been hypothesized that signaling pathways downstream of the kinase activity of LRRK2 are involved in regulating the phosphorylation of LRRK2, although the precise mechanism has remained unknown. Here we examined the effects of LRRK2 inhibitors on the phosphorylation state at Ser910, Ser935, and Ser955 in a series of kinase-inactive mutants of LRRK2. We found that the responses of LRRK2 to the inhibitors varied among mutants, in a manner not consistent with the above-mentioned hypothesis. Notably, one of the kinase-inactive mutants, T2035A LRRK2, underwent phosphorylation, as well as the inhibitor-induced dephosphorylation, at Ser910, Ser935, and Ser955, to a similar extent to those observed with wild-type LRRK2. These results suggest that the kinase activity of LRRK2 is not involved in the common mechanism of inhibitor-induced dephosphorylation of LRRK2."
https://openalex.org/W2003110160,"Travel overseas has recently been considered a risk factor for colonization with drug-resistant bacteria. The purpose of this study was to establish the epidemiology and risk factors associated with the acquisition of drug-resistant bacteria by Japanese travelers.Between October 2011 and September 2012, we screened the stools of 68 Japanese returning travelers for extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli. All specimens were sampled for clinical reasons. Based on the results, the participants were divided into an ESBL-producing E. coli positive group (18 cases; 26%) and an ESBL-producing E. coli negative group (50 cases; 74%), and a case-control study was performed. Microbiological analyses of ESBL-producing strains, including susceptibility tests, screening tests for metallo-β-lactamase, polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequencing of blaCTX-M genes, multilocus sequence typing, and whole genome sequencing, were also conducted.In a univariate comparison, travel to India was a risk factor (Odds Ratio 13.6, 95% Confidence Interval 3.0-75.0, p<0.0001). There were no statistical differences in the characteristics of the travel, such as backpacking, purpose of travel, interval between travel return and sampling stool, and duration of travel. Although 10 of 13 analyzed strains (77%) produced CTX-M-15, no ST131 clone was detected.We must be aware of the possibilities of acquiring ESBL-producing E. coli during travel in order to prevent the spread of these bacteria not only in Japan but globally."
https://openalex.org/W2011338885,"Early and accurate pre-clinical and clinical biomarkers of hepatotoxicity facilitate the drug development process and the safety monitoring in clinical studies. We selected eight known model compounds to be administered to male Wistar rats to identify biomarkers of drug induced liver injury (DILI) using transcriptomics, metabolite profiling (metabolomics) and conventional endpoints. We specifically explored early biomarkers in serum and liver tissue associated with histopathologically evident acute hepatotoxicity. A tailored data analysis strategy was implemented to better differentiate animals with no treatment-related findings in the liver from animals showing evident hepatotoxicity as assessed by histopathological analysis. From the large number of assessed parameters, our data analysis strategy allowed us to identify five metabolites in serum and five in liver tissue, 58 transcripts in liver tissue and seven clinical chemistry markers in serum that were significantly associated with acute hepatotoxicity. The identified markers comprised metabolites such as taurocholic acid and putrescine (measured as sum parameter together with agmatine), classical clinical chemistry markers like AST (aspartate aminotransferase), ALT (alanine aminotransferase), and bilirubin, as well as gene transcripts like Igfbp1 (insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1) and Egr1 (early growth response protein 1). The response pattern of the identified biomarkers was concordant across all types of parameters and sample matrices. Our results suggest that a combination of several of these biomarkers could significantly improve the robustness and accuracy of an early diagnosis of hepatotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1972878159,"Aberrant de novo methylation of DNA is considered an important mediator of tumorigenesis. To investigate the role of de novo DNA methyltransferase 3a (Dnmt3a) in intestinal tumor development, we analyzed the expression of Dnmt3a in murine colon crypts, murine colon adenomas and human colorectal cancer using RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), quantitative PCR and immunostaining. Following conditional deletion of Dnmt3a in the colon of APC((Min/+)) mice, we analyzed tumor numbers, genotype of macroadenomas and laser dissected microadenomas, global and regional DNA methylation and gene expression. Our results showed increased Dnmt3a expression in colon adenomas of APC((Min/+)) mice and human colorectal cancer samples when compared with control tissue. Interestingly, in tumor tissue, RNA FISH analysis showed highest Dnmt3a expression in Lgr5-positive stem/progenitor cells. Deletion of Dnmt3a in APC((Min/+)) mice reduced colon tumor numbers by ~40%. Remaining adenomas and microadenomas almost exclusively contained the non-recombined Dnmt3a allele; no tumors composed of the inactivated Dnmt3a allele were detected. DNA methylation was reduced at the Oct4, Nanog, Tff2 and Cdkn1c promoters and expression of the tumor-suppressor genes Tff2 and Cdkn1c was increased. In conclusion, our results show that Dnmt3a is predominantly expressed in the stem/progenitor cell compartment of tumors and that deletion of Dnmt3a inhibits the earliest stages of intestinal tumor development."
https://openalex.org/W2007763549,"The biology of follicular lymphoma (FL) is largely dictated by the immune-effector and stromal cells that comprise its tumor microenvironment. FL-infiltrating T-cell populations that are thought to be fundamental to FL biology are follicular helper T-cells (TFH), follicular regulatory T-cells (TFR), a recently described population that regulates TFH activity, and regulatory T-cells (Treg). These T-cell populations have dynamic interactions with mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in the tumor microenvironment. Whereas MSCs have been shown to support FL B-cell and Treg viability, their effects on FL-infiltrating TFH and TFR cells have not been described. Herein we show that MSCs support the viability of FL-infiltrating TFH and TFR, as well as Tregs, in part through an IL-6-dependent mechanism. We further demonstrate that MSCs mediate TFH to TFR conversion by inducing the expression of FoxP3 in TFH cells, demonstrating for the first time that human TFR can be derived from TFH cells. Given that the balance of TFH and TFR populations likely dictate, in part, the biology of this disease, our data support the potential for targeting MSCs as a therapeutic strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2004944985,"The ShcA adaptor protein is engaged by numerous receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) in breast cancer cells. Once activated, RTKs phosphorylate three key tyrosine phosphorylation sites (Y239, Y240 and Y317) within ShcA that creates a docking site for Grb2/SOS and Grb2/Gab-containing complexes to activate the MAPK and AKT signaling pathways, respectively. We previously demonstrated that a tyrosine to phenylalanine substitution of the ShcA tyrosine phosphorylation sites (Shc3F-Y239/240/313F) significantly impairs breast tumor growth and angiogenesis in transgenic mouse models, in part, through the regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production. Despite this fact, the underlying molecular mechanisms by which ShcA transduces pro-tumorigenic signals in breast cancer cells remain poorly defined. In this study, we demonstrate that ShcA-dependent activation of AKT, but not the RAS/MAPK pathway, induces VEGF production by bolstering VEGF mRNA translation. Accordingly, ShcA drives breast tumor growth and angiogenesis in vivo in a 4E-BP-dependent manner. These findings establish ShcA as a biological bridge that links AKT activation downstream of RTKs to cap-dependent VEGF mRNA translation in order to promote mammary tumorigenesis."

Setting Medical and surgical wards of a university hospital with active MRSA control programme. Participants All patients hospitalized >48 h in study wards and screened for MRSA on admission and discharge Intervention: Rapid PCR-based screening test for MRSA compared with control screening test by enrichment culture using chromogenic agar. Objective We determined the benefit of PCR-detection versus culture-based detection of MRSA colonisation upon patient admission on early implementation of isolation precautions and reduction of hospital transmission of MRSA. Main outcome Cumulative rate of MRSA hospital acquisition of in patients screened negative on admission. Randomization The sequential order of inclusion of study wards in each arm was randomised by assigning a number to each ward and using a computer generated list of random numbers. Findings Of 3704 eligible patients, 67.8% were evaluable for the study. Compared with culture, PCR-screening reduced the median test reporting time from admission from 88 to 11 hours (p<0.001) and the median time from admission to isolation from 96 to 25 hours (p<0.001). MRSA acquisition was detected in 36 patients (3.2%) in the control arm and 34 (3.2%) in the intervention arm. The incidence density rate of hospital acquired MRSA was 2.82 and 2.57/1,000 exposed patient-days in the control and intervention arm, respectively (risk ratio 0.91 (95% confidence interval, 0.60–1.39). Poisson regression model adjusted for colonisation pressure, compliance with hand hygiene and antibiotic use indicated a RR 0.99 (95% CI, 0.69 to 1.44). Interpretation Universal PCR screening for MRSA on admission to medical and surgical wards in an endemic setting shortened the time to implement isolation precautions but did not reduce nosocomial acquisition of MRSA.

https://openalex.org/W2082652182,"In order to maximize their fitness, individuals aim at choosing territories offering the most appropriate combination of resources. As population size fluctuates in time, the frequency of breeding territory occupancy reflects territory quality. We investigated the relationships between the frequency of territory occupancy (2002-2009) vs. habitat characteristics, prey abundance, reproductive success and parental traits in hoopoes Upupa epops L., with the objective to define proxies for the delineation of conservation priority areas. We predicted that the distribution of phenotypes is despotic and sought for phenotypic characteristics expressing dominance. Our findings support the hypothesis of a despotic distribution. Territory selection was non-random: frequently occupied territories were settled earlier in the season and yielded higher annual reproductive success, but the frequency of territory occupancy could not be related to any habitat characteristics. Males found in frequently occupied territories showed traits expressing dominance (i.e. larger body size and mass, and older age). In contrast, morphological traits of females were not related to the frequency of territory occupancy, suggesting that territory selection and maintenance were essentially a male's task. Settlement time in spring, reproductive success achieved in a given territory, as well as phenotypic traits and age of male territory holders reflected territory quality, providing good proxies for assessing priority areas for conservation management."

The aim of this study was to identify PHEX gene mutations and describe the clinical features observed in 6 unrelated Chinese families and 3 sporadic patients with hypophosphatemic rickets/osteomalacia. Methods For this study, 45 individuals from 9 unrelated families of Chinese Han ethnicity (including 16 patients and 29 normal phenotype subjects), and 250 healthy donors were recruited. All 22 exons and exon-intron boundaries of the PHEX gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and directly sequenced. Results The PHEX mutations were detected in 6 familial and 3 sporadic hypophosphatemic rickets/osteomalacia. Altogether, 2 novel mutations were detected: 1 missense mutation c.1183G>C in exon 11, resulting in p.Gly395Arg and 1 missense mutation c.1751A>C in exon 17, resulting in p.His584Pro. No mutations were found in the 250 healthy controls. Conclusions Our study increases knowledge of the PHEX gene mutation types and clinical phenotypes found in Chinese patients with XLH, which is important for understanding the genetic basis of XLH. The molecular diagnosis of a PHEX genetic mutation is of great importance for confirming the clinical diagnosis of XLH, conducting genetic counseling, and facilitating prenatal intervention, especially in the case of sporadic patients."
https://openalex.org/W2010893273,"Background The ever-increasing older population and its association with serious overweight problems have garnered much attention. The correlation between being overweight and socioeconomic status factors could be helpful for understanding the inequalities among the overweight population. We examined the correlation between being overweight and some key variables, such as demographics, socioeconomic status, general health status, and health behavior in a large sample of older individuals, by each gender. Methods We used data from the 2008 Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging and it included 8,157 participants who were 45 years or older. To understand the relationship between the overweight participants in accordance to demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, health status, and health behaviors, a weighted chi-square test and logistic regression analysis were conducted by separating variables related to overweight, according to the genders. Results The number of people in the normal group was 6,347 (77.8%), while the people who were considered overweight were 1,810 (22.2%). Women (n = 4,583) constituted 52.7% of the subject, 24.9% of whom were classified as overweight. Meanwhile, 20.6% of the 47.3% (n = 3,574) of the sample who were men were classified as overweight. Participants between the ages of 45 and 64 with chronic diseases were more likely to be overweight. Men in the 4th quartile of household income were more likely to be overweight than those who were in the 1st quartile, in contrast, while unemployed women with lower education levels and urban residents were at greater risk for being overweight. Conclusions Among the men, health status and health behavior appeared to show a correlation with being overweight; however, among women, socioeconomic status factors were strongly related to being overweight. These findings appear to support the association of gender-specifics with the prevalence of being overweight."

Juvenile sea urchins are more susceptible to predators than adults, which affects community structure. Behavior is involved in anti-predator responses by changes in the expression of anti-predator responsive genes. Here, we investigated the effects of exposure to a predatory crab Charybdis japonica and covering behavior on survival and HSP70 expression of juvenile sea urchins Strongylocentrotus intermedius. C. japonica consumed large numbers of juvenile S. intermedius in 12 hours with a mortality of 34.17±11.43%. Covering behavior did not significantly reduce predation. Exposure to C. japonica did not significantly upregulate HSP70 expression of juvenile S. intermedius in 12 hours. Covering behavior showed no significant regulative effect on the gene expression of HSP70 of juvenile S. intermedius exposed to C. japonica for 12 hours. The results indicate that the anti-predator function of covering behavior is limited and that HSP70 expression does not appear to play an important role in the anti-predator process of S. intermedius."

Island ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to invasive species and other ecological disturbances. Properly documenting historic and current species distributions is critical for quantifying extinction events. Museum specimens, field notes, and other archived materials from historical expeditions are essential for documenting recent changes in biodiversity. The Islas Revillagigedo are a remote group of four islands, 700-1100 km off the western coast of mainland México. The islands are home to many endemic plants and animals recognized at the specific- and subspecific-levels, several of which are currently threatened or have already gone extinct. Here, we recount the initial discovery of an endemic snake Hypsiglena ochrorhyncha unaocularus Tanner on Isla Clarión, the later dismissal of its existence, its absence from decades of field surveys, our recent rediscovery, and recognition of it as a distinct species. We collected two novel complete mitochondrial (mt) DNA genomes and up to 2800 base-pairs of mtDNA from several other individuals, aligned these with previously published mt-genome data from samples throughout the range of Hypsiglena, and conducted phylogenetic analyses to infer the biogeographic origin and taxonomic status of this population. We found the Isla Clarión population to be most closely related to populations in the Sonora-Sinaloa state border area of mainland México and Isla Santa Catalina, in the Gulf of California. Based on genetics, morphology, and geographic distributions, we also recognize these two other lineages as distinct species. Our study shows the importance of museum specimens, field notes, and careful surveys to accurately document biodiversity and brings these island endemics (Clarión and Santa Catalina nightsnakes) and mainland population near the Sonora-Sinaloa state border to the attention of conservation biologists currently monitoring biodiversity in these fragile subtropical ecosystems."

Previously we demonstrated that strain M, the most prevalent multidrug-resistant (MDR) Mtb strain in Argentine, is a weak inducer of IFN-γ and elicits a remarkably low CD8-dependent cytotoxic T cell activity (CTL). In contrast, the closely related strain 410, which caused a unique case of MDR-TB, elicits a CTL response similar to H37Rv. In this work we extend our previous study investigating some parameters that can account for this discrepancy. We evaluated the expressions of the lytic molecules perforin, granzyme B and granulysin and the chemokine CCL5 in CD8+ T cells as well as activation markers CD69 and CD25 and IL-2 expression in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells stimulated with strains H37Rv, M and 410. Our results demonstrate that M-stimulated CD8+ T cells from purified protein derivative positive healthy donors show low intracellular expression of perforin, granzyme B, granulysin and CCL5 together with an impaired ability to form conjugates with autologous M-pulsed macrophages. Besides, M induces low CD69 and IL-2 expression in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, being CD69 and IL-2 expression closely associated. Furthermore, IL-2 addition enhanced perforin and granulysin expression as well as the degranulation marker CD107 in M-stimulated CD8+ T cells, making no differences with cells stimulated with strains H37Rv or 410. Thus, our results highlight the role of IL-2 in M-induced CTL activity that drives the proper activation of CD8+ T cells as well as CD4+ T cells collaboration."
https://openalex.org/W2019296609,"Seasonal rhythm in sex hormones has been extensively studied in birds, as well as its relationship with the type of mating system. The Greater Rhea (Rhea americana), a South American ratite species, reproduces seasonally and has a complex mating system: female-defense polygyny and sequential polyandry. The present study aimed at analyzing the endocrine basis of reproduction in this species and its relationship with its mating system. We used HPLC and electrochemiluminescence techniques to identify and measure plasma testosterone and estradiol levels. Annual oscillations in sex hormones, testosterone and estradiol, in adult males and females were observed. Lower levels of these hormones were exhibited during the non reproductive season (February to July), whereas their maximum values were reached in September for males and November-December for females. These fluctuations reflect the seasonal changes in gonadal function. By contrast, no significant sex hormones oscillations were observed in juvenile males and females (negative control of seasonal changes). Greater rheas maintain high testosterone and estradiol levels throughout the reproductive period. The high testosterone levels during incubation and chick rearing did not inhibit parental behavior in males, which appears not to conform to the “Challenge Hypothesis”. In females, the high estradiol levels throughout the reproductive season would be needed to sustain their long egg-laying period."

https://openalex.org/W1963628398,"Purpose Respiratory motion causes substantial artifacts in reconstructed PET images when using helical CT as the attenuation map in PET/CT imaging. In this study, we aimed to reduce the respiratory artifacts in PET/CT images of patients with lung tumors using an abdominal compression device. Methods Twelve patients with lung cancer located in the middle or lower lobe of the lung were recruited. The patients were injected with 370 MBq of 18F-FDG. During PET, the patients assumed two bed positions for 1.5 min/bed. After conducting free-breathing imaging, we obtained images of the patients with abdominal compression by applying the same setup used in the free-breathing scan. The differences in the standardized uptake value (SUV)max, SUVmean, tumor volume, and the centroid of the tumors between PET and various CT schemes were measured. Results The SUVmax and SUVmean derived from PET/CT imaging using an abdominal compression device increased for all the lesions, compared with those obtained using the conventional approach. The percentage increases were 18.1% ±14% and 17% ±16.8% for SUVmax and SUVmean, respectively. PET/CT imaging combined with abdominal compression generally reduced the tumor mismatch between CT and the corresponding attenuation corrected PET images, with an average decrease of 1.9±1.7 mm over all the cases. Conclusions PET/CT imaging combined with abdominal compression reduces respiratory artifacts and PET/CT misregistration, and enhances quantitative SUV in tumor. Abdominal compression is easy to set up and is an effective method used in PET/CT imaging for clinical oncology, especially in the thoracic region."
https://openalex.org/W1973424334,"The ability of chromatin to switch back and forth from open euchromatin to closed heterochromatin is vital for transcriptional regulation and genomic stability, but its dynamic structure is subject to disruption by exposure to environmental agents such as hexavalent chromium. Cr(VI) exposure disrupts chromatin remodeling mechanisms and causes chromosomal damage through formation of free radicals, Cr-DNA adducts, and DNA-Cr-protein cross-links. In addition, acute, high-concentration, and chronic, low-concentration exposures to Cr(VI) lead to significantly different transcriptional and genomic stability outcomes. We used mouse hepatoma Hepa-1c1c7 cells to investigate how transcriptional responses to chromium treatment might correlate with structural chromatin changes. We used Formaldehyde-Assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements (FAIRE) analysis coupled with deep sequencing to identify regions of the genome that may switch between open and closed chromatin in response to exposure to varying Cr(VI) concentrations. At either Cr(VI) concentration, chromatin domains surrounding binding sites for AP-1 transcription factors become significantly open, whereas BACH2 and CTCF binding sites are open solely at the low and high concentrations, respectively. Parallel gene expression profiling using RNA-seq indicates that the structural chromatin changes caused by Cr(VI) affect gene expression levels in the target areas that vary depending on Cr(VI) concentration, but show no correlation between global changes in the overall transcriptional response and Cr(VI) concentration. Our results suggest that FAIRE may be a useful technique to map chromatin elements targeted by DNA damaging agents for which there is no prior knowledge of their specificity, and to identify subsequent transcriptomic changes induced by those agents."

https://openalex.org/W2006435818,"Substantial effort is being expended on using micro-structural modeling of the white matter, with the goal of relating diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWMRI) to the underlying structure of the tissue, such as axonal density. However, one of the important parameters affecting diffusion is the water exchange rate between the intra- and extra-axonal space, which has not been fully investigated and is a crucial marker of brain injury such as multiple sclerosis (MS), stroke, and traumatic brain injury (TBI). To our knowledge, there is no diffusion analytical model which includes the Water eXchange Rate (WXR) without the requirement of short gradient pulse (SGP) approximation. We therefore propose a new analytical model by deriving the diffusion signal for a permeable cylinder, assuming a clinically feasible pulse gradient spin echo (PGSE) sequence. Simulations based on Markov Random Walk confirm that the exchange parameter included in our model has a linear correlation (R2>0.88) with the actual WXR. Moreover, increasing WXR causes the estimated values of diameter and volume fraction of the cylinders to increase and decrease, respectively, which is consistent with our findings from histology measurements in tissues near TBI regions. This model was also applied to the diffusion signal acquired from ex vivo brains of 14 male (10 TBI and 4 normal) rats using hybrid diffusion imaging. The estimated values of axon diameter and axonal volume fraction are in agreement with their corresponding histological measurements in normal brains, with 0.96 intra-class correlation coefficient value resulting from consistency analysis. Moreover, a significant increase (p = 0.001) in WXR and diameter and decrease in axonal volume fraction in the TBI boundary were detected in the TBI rats compared with the normal rats."
https://openalex.org/W2024895263,"Many of the structural and mechanistic requirements of oocyte-mediated nuclear reprogramming remain elusive. Previous accounts that transcriptional reprogramming of somatic nuclei in mouse zygotes may be complete in 24–36 hours, far more rapidly than in other reprogramming systems, raise the question of whether the mere exposure to the activated mouse ooplasm is sufficient to enact reprogramming in a nucleus. We therefore prevented DNA replication and cytokinesis, which ensue after nuclear transfer, in order to assess their requirement for transcriptional reprogramming of the key pluripotency genes Oct4 (Pou5f1) and Nanog in cloned mouse embryos. Using transcriptome and allele-specific analysis, we observed that hundreds of mRNAs, but not Oct4 and Nanog, became elevated in nucleus-transplanted oocytes without DNA replication. Progression through the first round of DNA replication was essential but not sufficient for transcriptional reprogramming of Oct4 and Nanog, whereas cytokinesis and thereby cell-cell interactions were dispensable for transcriptional reprogramming. Responses similar to clones also were observed in embryos produced by fertilization in vitro. Our results link the occurrence of reprogramming to a previously unappreciated requirement of oocyte-mediated nuclear reprogramming, namely DNA replication. Nuclear transfer alone affords no immediate transition from a somatic to a pluripotent gene expression pattern unless DNA replication is also in place. This study is therefore a resource to appreciate that the quest for always faster reprogramming methods may collide with a limit that is dictated by the cell cycle."

The participants were 1144 undergraduate students. After we removed some items that were not homogeneous, a principal component analysis extracted six components that accounted for 44.48% of the variance, a value similar to that obtained in the analysis conducted by Weber et al. Chinese undergraduates scored higher on the investment subscale compared with the results of Weber's study. The analysis of individual differences indicated that there was a significant gender difference in the ethical, investment and health/safety subscales, where males scored significantly higher than females. The type of home location was also significant on the ethical and health/safety subscales, where undergraduates from the countryside scored lower than undergraduates from cities and towns on the ethical subscale, and undergraduates from towns scored higher than those from other two areas on the health/safety subscale. Male undergraduates from towns scored higher than male undergraduates from other areas on the gambling subscale."
https://openalex.org/W2062429833,"To examine the difference between schizophrenia patients and normal controls on velocity and acceleration of saccade, by using the basic visually guided saccade (VGS) paradigm.Eighteen schizophrenia outpatients and fourteen normal controls participated in the VGS task. Multiple indicators, including amplitude, duration, velocity, latency, accuracy rate, acceleration, and deceleration were analyzed. Asymmetric acceleration index (AAI) was introduced to describe the difference between peak acceleration and peak deceleration. The correlation coefficient (RAD) of AAI and duration was computed to examine the difference between schizophrenia patients and normal controls.No significant difference between patients and normal controls was found on amplitude, duration, latency, and accuracy rate. However, RAD values of schizophrenia patients were significantly lower than the control group.Compared to normal controls, association of saccade duration and saccade acceleration/deceleration asymmetry during visually guided saccade was lower in schizophrenia patients."
https://openalex.org/W1972969829,"As new interventions to reduce childhood mortality are identified, careful consideration must be given to identifying populations that could benefit most from them. Promising reductions in childhood mortality reported in a large cluster randomized trial of mass drug administration (MDA) of azithromycin (AZM) prompted the development of visually compelling, easy-to-use tools that synthesize country-specific data on factors that would influence both potential AZM benefit and MDA implementation success.We assessed the opportunity to reduce mortality and the feasibility of implementing such a program, creating Opportunity and Feasibility Indices, respectively. Countries with high childhood mortality were included. A Country Ranking Index combined key variables from the previous two Indices and applied a scoring system to identify high-priority countries. We compared four scenarios with varying weights given to each variable. Twenty-five countries met inclusion criteria. We created easily visualized tools to display the results of the Opportunity and Feasibility Indices. The Opportunity Index revealed substantial variation in the opportunity for an MDA of AZM program to reduce mortality, even among countries with high overall childhood mortality. The Feasibility Index demonstrated that implementing such a program would be most challenging in the countries that could see greatest benefit. Based on the Country Ranking Index, Equatorial Guinea would benefit the most from the MZA of AZM in three of the four scenarios we tested.These visually accessible tools can be adapted or refined to include other metrics deemed important by stakeholders, and provide a quantitative approach to prioritization for intervention implementation. The need to explicitly state metrics and their weighting encourages thoughtful and transparent decision making. The objective and data-driven approach promoted by the three Indices may foster more efficient use of resources."
https://openalex.org/W2001009580,"Etravirine (ETV) is recommended in combination with a boosted protease inhibitor plus an optimized background regimen for salvage therapy, but there is limited experience with its use in combination with two nucleos(t)ide reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). This multicenter study aimed to assess the efficacy of this combination in two scenarios: group A) subjects without virologic failure on or no experience with non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) switched due to adverse events and group B) subjects switched after a virologic failure on an efavirenz- or nevirapine-based regimen. The primary endpoint was efficacy at 52 weeks analysed by intention-to-treat. Virologic failure was defined as the inability to suppress plasma HIV-RNA to <50 copies/mL after 24 weeks on treatment, or a confirmed viral load >200 copies/mL in patients who had previously achieved a viral suppression or had an undetectable viral load at inclusion. Two hundred eighty seven patients were included. Treatment efficacy rates in group A and B were 88.0% (CI95, 83.9–92.1%) and 77.4% (CI95, 65.0–89.7%), respectively; the rates reached 97.2% (CI95, 95.1–99.3%) and 90.5% (CI95, 81.7–99.3), by on-treatment analysis. The once-a-day ETV treatment was as effective as the twice daily dosing regimen. Grade 1–2 adverse events were observed motivating a treatment switch in 4.2% of the subjects. In conclusion, ETV (once- or twice daily) plus two analogs is a suitable, well-tolerated combination both as a switching strategy and after failure with first generation NNRTIs, ensuring full drug activity.
