https://openalex.org/W1483045044,"Ca2+-activated, phospholipid-dependent protein kinase from various mammalian tissues (Takai, Y., Kishimoto, A., Iwasa, Y., Kawahara, Y., Mori, T., and Nishizuka, Y (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 3692-3695) was greatly stimulated by the addition of diacylglycerol at less than 5% (w/w) the concentration of phospholipid. This stimulation was due to an increase in the apparent affinity of enzyme for phospholipid and to a concomitant decrease in the Ka value for Ca2+ from about 1 x 10(-4) M to the micromolar range. Diacylglycerol alone showed little or no effect on enzymatic activity over a wide range of Ca2+ concentrations. This effect was greatest for diacylglycerol which contained unsaturated fatty acid at least at position 2. The active diacylglycerols so far tested included diolein, dilinolein, diarachidonin, 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl diglyceride, and 1-stearoyl-2-linoleoyl diglyceride. In contrast, diacylglycerols containing saturated fatty acids such as dipalmitin and distearin were far less effective. Triacyl- and monoacylglycerols were totally ineffective, irrespective of the fatty acyl moieties. Cholesterol and free fatty acids were also ineffective. Based on these observations, a possible coupling is proposed between the protein kinase activation and phosphatidylinositol turnover which can be provoked by various extracellular messengers."
https://openalex.org/W2023338777,"We studied the role of the nuclear matrix (the skeletal framework of the nucleus) in DNA replication both in vivo and in a cell culture system. When regenerating rat liver or exponentially growing 3T3 fibroblasts are pulse-labeled with 3H-thymidine and nuclear matrix is subsequently isolated, the fraction of DNA remaining tightly attached to the matrix is highly enriched in newly synthesized DNA. After a 30 sec pulse labeling period and limited DNAase I digestion, the matrix DNA of 3T3 fibroblasts, which constitutes 15% of the total DNA, contains approximately 90% of the labeled newly synthesized DNA. Over 80% of this label can be chased out of the matrix DNA if the pulse is followed by a 45 min incubation with excess unlabeled thymidine. These and other kinetic studies suggest that the growing point of DNA replication is attached to the nuclear matrix. Studies measuring the size distribution of the matrix DNA also support this conclusion. Reconstitution controls and autoradiographic studies indicate that these results are not due to preferential, nonspecific binding of nascent DNA to the matrix during the extraction procedures. Electron microscopic autoradiography shows that, as with intact nuclei, sites of DNA replication are distributed throughout the nuclear matrix. A fixed site of DNA synthesis is proposed in which DNA replication complexes are anchored to the nuclear matrix and the DNA is reeled through these complexes as it is replicated."

https://openalex.org/W2125258660,"We carried out experiments to determine conditions for fibroblast adhesion to fibrinogen and fibrin substrata. Baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells did not attach to substrata composed of purified fibrinogen or fibrin. When cold-insoluble globulin (CIG) (plasma fibronectin) was bound to fibrinogen or fibrin substrata, adhesion of BHK sells was observed and the extent of adhesion was dependent upon the CIG conecntration. Binding of CIG to fibrinogen or fibrin substrata in the presence of Factor XIII (factor) under covalent crosslinking conditions resulted in a marked increased in the ability of the substrata to support cell adhesion. Control experiments indicated that CIG formed the sites on the fibrinogen and fibrin substrata to which the cells were attaching. In addition, the effect of factor XIII was shown to require covalent crossliking of CIG to the fibrinogen or fibrin, which involved a glutamine residue on the CIG molecule and could be prevented by prior crosslinking of CIG with putrescine or with itself. The enhanced ability of Factor XIII-crosslinked CIG substrata to support cell adhesion could not be accounted for by the absolute amount of CIG bound to the substrata. We present in this paper the possibility that the orientation of CIG on the substrata is the critical factor."
https://openalex.org/W2103853212,"Although a single transition in the cell cycle is both sufficient and necessary to account for the distribution of differences in the intermitotic times of sister cells, two random transitions seem necessary to account for the responses of quiescent cells to stimulation by growth factors. We propose that serum-depleted quiescent cells ""rest"" in an indeterminate state (Q) which they leave at random upon stimulation and initiate a lengthy process (L). Upon completion of L the cells enter another indeterminate state (A) which they also leave at random and shortly thereafter initiate S phase and subsequently divide. On leaving A they also re-enter Q, and, again at random, initiate L. This sequence, Q leads to L leads to A, is maintained in steady state proliferation, and because of the random exit from Q and A, overlaps to varying degrees with the conventional cell cycle (M-G1-S-G2-M). The hypothesis provides a qualitative account of various problematic features of the lag between stimulation and entry into S phase. It also provides a good quantitative account of the distribution of sibling differences, the correlation coefficient of sibling intermitotic times and the distribution of intermitotic times and the distribution of intermitotic times in steady state growing cultures. There are striking similarities between the hypothetical cycle and the centriole cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2069021292,"We present the first report of isolated mitotic apparatus with vesicular calcium sequestration. Phase-contrast, differential interference contrast and polarized light microscopy as well as transmission and scanning electron microscopic examinations revealed structures comparable to mitotic apparatus in vivo. Numerous membrane-bound vesicles which retained their osmotic activity were present throughout. Microtubules, yolk, ribosomes and condensed chromatin were also present. The protein composition of mitotic apparatus was not dramatically altered by treatment with 0.5% Triton X-100, even though vesicles were destroyed and yolk was extracted. Calcium sequestration was demonstrated with ATP-dependent accumulation of 45Ca by mitotic apparatus whose vesicles were left intact. Compared with controls for which no nucleotide was added, accumulation by mitotic apparatus with intact vesicles was enhanced to 184% when it was present. When ATP was supplemented with the divalent ionophore A23187, the calcium retention level was comparable to that of the control to which no nucleotide was added. Finally, the calcium accumulation by mitotic apparatus treated with either of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs AMPPCP or AMPPNP resulted in calcium retention levels similar to those of controls. The solubilization of vesicles with Triton X-100 abolished calcium accumulation in the presence or absence of any of the above additives. Resolution of vesicles on sucrose step gradients after 45Ca-oxalate loading with ATP or AMPPCP indicates that a specific vesicular fraction sequesters 45Ca."
https://openalex.org/W1569618923,"The substrate specificities of rat liver microsomal glucosidases I and II, which hydrolyze oligosaccharides of the composition Glc3-1Man9GlcNAc, were investigated. Glucosidases I and II were shown to have a specific and necessary interaction with the 6'-pentamannosyl branch of their oligosaccharide substrates; activity was reduced when mannose residues were removed from this branch. Both glucosidases responded to features at the reducing end of the oligosaccharide substrates; activity was lower towards lipid-linked and peptide-linked substrates than towards free oligosaccharide substrates. In addition, the glucosidases appeared to discriminate between oligosaccharides linked to lipid and oligosaccharides linked to peptide. We conclude that rat liver microsomal glucosidases I and II interact with extensive portions of oligosaccharide structure in addition to the glucose residues which they hydrolyze."
https://openalex.org/W2167162915,"The sodium- and potassium-transporting ionophore monensin induces the maturation of Caenorhabditis elegans spermatids to spermatozoa in vitro. Rearrangement of cytoplasm, fusion of membranous organelles with the plasma membrane and growth of pseudopodia, all characteristic of in vivo spermiogenesis, occur within five minutes after exposure to monensin at concentrations of 0.1–1.0 μM. This activation is dependent upon external Na+ and K+ ions but not Ca2+ ions. Monensin-activated spermatozoa have normal morphology and normal amoeboid motility. During activation spermatids twitch and rotate prior to pseudopod extension. Analysis of intermediates by transmission and scanning electron microscopy reveals that the sequence of morphogenetic events leading from the spherical spermatid to the polarized spermatozoan involves microvilli rearrangement and membranous organelle fusion, cytoplasmic polarization, then pseudopod extension."
https://openalex.org/W1605265326,"The biologically active peptide neurotensin (NT) has been isolated from fresh postmortem human small intestine and its identity with bovine hypothalamic and intestinal neurotensin has been established. Purification was achieved by gel filtration and two ion exchange chromatography steps; material was detected by radioimmunoassay (RIA). A substance was obtained that had integral molar ratios of amino acids and eluted in a single peak during reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). This material had an amino acid composition and COOH-terminal sequence identical with those of bovine NT. Human and bovine neurotensin gave rise to the same fragments when treated with papain; they were indistinguishable in RIAs using three different region-specific antisera and in their hypotensive effect on anesthetized rats. Using mucosal scrapings obtained immediately post-mortem from four subjects, the concentration of immunoreactive neurotensin was found to increase from duodenum to distal ileum, in agreement with results obtained in other mammalian species."
https://openalex.org/W2071010569,"A cloned 3.18 kb repeating unit of Xenopus laevis DNA, known to contain two tRNA1Met genes, has been partially sequenced. The sequenced region could potentially code for two more tRNA species. One is a phenylalanine tRNA with the same primary sequence as that found in a variety of mammals. The other is a tyrosine tRNA with a 13 bp intervening sequence located immediately adjacent or very close to the 3′ nucleotide of the anticodon. The two putative genes have opposite polarity and the sequences encoding the 5′ nucleotides of the mature tRNAs are separated by only 72 bp of DNA. Homologous GC-rich sequences of dyad symmetry precede each gene. Neither gene codes for the 3′ terminal CCA expected in the mature tRNAs. A short T cluster is present in the noncoding strand 3 bp away from the 3′ end of the tRNATyr gene. A similar short T cluster is located 26 bp downstream of the tRNAPhe sequence. The nucleotides in between are very GC-rich and are capable of forming a stable RNA hairpin. The possible significance of these features for tRNA gene evolution, RNA splicing and transcription is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W11569139,"Human platelets incubated with thrombin and indomethacin (50 microgram/ml) exhibit an accumulation of diglyceride larger and more persistent than that observed for platelets incubated with thrombin alone. The accumulation appears to be due to the impaired metabolism of diglyceride by diglyceride lipase. In preparations of broken platelets, indomethacin leads to inhibition of diglyceride lipase. A similar inhibition can be achieved by the addition of soybean lipoxidase, and both inhibitions can be counteracted by reduced glutathione. Further, hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (100 microM) markedly depresses diglyceride lipase activity, whereas neither the hydroxy derivative nor eicosatetraenoic acid displays a comparable effect. Indomethacin at concentrations comparable to those impairing diglyceride lipase does not inhibit diglyceride kinase. This report constitutes the first evidence for the functioning of diglyceride lipase in normal stimulated platelets, and points to a possible role for fatty acid hydroperoxides in governing the activity of this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2087696589,"To learn more about the pathway for degradation of an intrinsic membrane protein, we studied in cultured chick myotubes the effects of certain protease inhibitors and chloroquine (an inhibitor of lysosomal function) on degradation of the acetylcholine receptor measured with the specific ligand 125I-α-bungarotoxin. Leupeptin, chymostatin, anti-pain and chloroquine decreased by 2–10 fold the rate of degradation of the acetylcholine receptor-125I-α-bungarotoxin complex to 125I-tyrosine (p < 0.01). After removing the inhibitors, the degradative rate returned to control levels. Leupeptin and chloroquine did not appear toxic to the cells; these agents did not alter the overall rate of protein synthesis, and leupeptin did not decrease the incorporation of receptors into the surface membrane. Therefore these inhibitors probably inhibit the degradative process selectively. A lysosomal site for receptor degradation appears probable, since chloroquine slows this process; leupeptin, chymostatin and antipain all inhibit cathepsin B; and chloroquine and to a lesser extent leupeptin altered the ultrastructural appearance of this organelle. Cultures labeled with 125I-α-bungarotoxin and then incubated with leupeptin or chloroquine contained more radioactive protein than control cells. This material co-electrophoresed with bungarotoxin on sodium dodecylsulfate-urea-polyacrylamide gels. Thus myotubes exposed to these inhibitors seemed to accumulate undegraded bungarotoxin. They did not, however, contain more acetylcholine receptors on their surface. Instead, the inhibitor-treated cells accumulate toxin and receptors at some internal site. Thus treatment with such inhibitors does not appear to be a useful approach to the therapy of myasthenia gravis. The additional 125I-toxin found in cells incubated with leupeptin or chloroquine was less accessible to exogenous protease than the toxin bound to control cells and was more resistant to extraction by Triton X-100. Since internalization of the receptor continued in the presence of these inhibitors, this process must not be coupled tightly to subsequent proteolysis. Measurement of receptors within cells not exposed to 125I-α-bungarotoxin showed that incubation of myotubes with leupeptin or chloroquine for 48 hr increased the number of internal bungarotoxin-binding sites 2–11 fold (p < 0.001). Thus cells treated with these agents accumulate receptors intracellularly in a form that sediments at 35,000 × g. Electron microscopy showed that these treated myotubes contain 3–6 times more coated vesicles within their cytoplasm than control cells (p < 0.001). Thus chloroquine and leupeptin may retard receptor degradation in part by interfering with the fusion of coated vesicles with lysosomes."

https://openalex.org/W2042412706,"In the androgen-induced destruction of the mammary rudiments of 14 day male mouse fetuses, the hormone acts directly only on the mesenchyme, which then condenses around the epithelial gland buds and—in some unknown way—causes their necrosis. In this paper we report that an organspecific but not species-specific influence of mammary epithelium on the surrounding mesenchyme is required to allow its response to the hormone. This epithelial “signal” has a very short range; its transmission may depend on contact between the two tissues. The requirement for epithelial contact, however, may only exist for those mesenchymal cells that initiate the reaction at the tissue interface, whereas the hormone must act on all the cells that eventually form the mesenchymal condensation. Mesenchyme of the mammary region only is competent to produce this testosterone response. All the mesenchymal cells required for the reaction are already present at the epithelial surface at least 2 days before the hormone response occurs, and our experiments exclude the participation of any cells that could have arrived at the mammary bud through migration from more distant sites."

Two proteins (Mr = 45,000 and 55,000) are labeled with [32P]NAD when wild type or UNC membranes are incubated with the labeled nucleotide and cholera toxin (Johnson, G.L., Kaslow, H.R., and Bourne, H.R. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 7120-7123). The 45,000-dalton component appears to be a constituent of G/F. Two dimensional electrophoresis of the labeled proteins reveals that both are more acidic when derived from UNC cells."
https://openalex.org/W1577502833,"After immunization of rats with bovine serum albumin (BSA) for a 12-day period, approximately 90% of anti-BSA antibody was IgM. The circulating half-life of limiting amounts of 125I-BSA in immunized and control rats was 6 min and 24 h, respectively. The rapid clearance of 125I-BSA was inhibited by pre- or co-injection of mannan and ovalbumin, but not by asialofetuin, rat serum albumin, carbon particles, dextran, or depletion of serum complement. Soluble IgM . 125I-BSA complexes, formed in vitro under conditions of antibody excess, were rapidly cleared from the circulation of nonimmunized rats, and clearance was also inhibited by ovalbumin but not by asialofetuin. Immune complexes formed in vivo or in vitro were recovered primarily (approximately 60% of dose) in hepatic nonparenchymal cells and in other organs of the reticuloendothelial system. In experiments in vitro, IgM was bound tightly by concanavalin A only when complexed with antigen. Digestion of IgM . 125I-BSA complexes with alpha-mannosidase abolished both binding by concanavalin A and rapid clearance in normal rats. These data suggest that antigen-induced conformational changes can result in exposure of high mannose oligosaccharides on IgM which signal the clearance of soluble immune complexes from the circulation."

The transporter was solubilized with 2% cholate at high ionic strength (0.5 M NaCl) in the presence of 2.4% soybean phospholipids. Appropriate dilution and sedimentation yielded a preparation of the transporter which could be reconstituted into liposomes. The proteoliposomes catalyzed Ca2+ uptake with a specific activity about 5 times higher than native vesicles. External Na+ inhibited Ca2+ uptake with a Ki of 50 mM. The uptake of Ca2+ was also inhibited when the Na+ gradient was collapsed with nigericin. Ca2+ uptake was stimulated when either valinomycin or dinitrophenol was added to the assay, in line with the known electrogenic nature of the transport system."

Membrane glycoproteins prepared by Ricinus communis agglutinin-Sepharose affinity chromatography, which were free of glycolipids, were shown to be able to form complexes with iodinated cholera toxin by gel filtration column chromatography. These glycoproteins were further characterized by subjecting the complex of tritiated cholera toxin receptors, cholera toxin, and anti-cholera toxin antibody to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography and by localizing cholera toxin binding glycoproteins on sodium dodecyl sulfate-gels using iodinated cholera toxin. In addition to glycolipids, at least 5 glycoproteins with molecular weights of 69,000, 90,000, 100,000, 114,000, and 132,000 were identified by both methods. These results suggest that microvillus membranes contain glycoprotein and glycolipid receptors for cholera toxin."
https://openalex.org/W2138629856,"A heat shock to amebae of the amebo-flagellate Naegleria gruberi during differentiation into swimming flagellates results in the induction of heat shock proteins as well as multiple flagella. The principal heat shock proteins migrate on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels with apparent molecular weights of 96,000, 77,000, 70,000, and 68,000. These proteins are synthesized preferentially when cells at 25 degrees C are shifted to temperatures above 32 degrees C. The maximal incorporation of methionine into heat shock proteins occurs at 38.2 degrees C, the temperature at which maximal induction of multiple flagella has been reported. Synthesis of heat shock proteins requires new transcription as judged by the ability of actinomycin D to inhibit their synthesis during the first 15 min of heat shock but not thereafter. Although heat shock can induce multiple flagella only when applied during a restricted interval, heat shock proteins are induced at any time cells are shifted to 38.2 degrees C. The response to heat shock of the Naegleria heat shock proteins resembles that of Drosophila heat shock proteins, but the two groups of proteins differ in both size and number. Naegleria heat shock proteins are, however, strikingly similar in size to a group of heat-induced proteins found in chick embryo fibroblast, mouse L, and BHK cells."
https://openalex.org/W1581192941,"Melittin is the principal protein component of bee venom and is believed to function as a lytic agent. In aqueous salt solution, it is a tetramer of identical peptides, each with 26 amino acid residues. Although its amino acid composition is unusually nonpolar, and although it is believed to integrate into membranes while lysing cells, melittin is water-soluble at neutral pH. Two crystal forms have been grown from solutions containing ammonium sulfate and sodium formate, and their x-ray diffraction patterns indicate that the melittin tetramer contains at least one 2-fold axis of rotation. Both crystal forms are suitable for high resolution x-ray structural studies. Moreover, both crystals bind several heavy atoms as judged by changes in buoyancy, so that phase determination by the method of isomorphous replacement is possible. Crystallized melittin retains its lytic activity even under the conditions of crystallization (about 70% saturated ammonium sulfate)."
https://openalex.org/W73743631,"NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase of normal human erythrocytes was purified by procedures including affinity chromatography on Blue-Sepharose to an electrophoretically homogeneous protein. The purified enzyme was judged to be a typical flavoprotein based on its absorption spectrum (absorption maxima, 272, 390, and 462 nm; shoulders, 373 and 488 nm) and flavin content (1 mol of FAD/mol of enzyme). The minimum molecular weight calculated from the flavin content was 32,300. The purified enzyme showed a distinct negative circular dichroic spectrum at 280 nm and also at 460 to 480 nm. With the best preparations, the molar ellipticities at 280 and 460 nm were well correlated with the enzyme activity and flavin content in the enzyme. A partial loss of flavin from the enzyme led to a concomitant loss of enzyme activity and decrease in the molar ellipticities at 460 and 280 nm. Flavin analogues such as acrinol and proflavine (0.1 mM) strongly inhibited the enzyme activity, and atebrin (0.1 mM) also showed partial inhibition. Complete inhibition was observed with 1 mM of any these reagents. These results apparently indicate that FAD in the enzyme functions as a prosthetic group, and that circular dichroic spectroscopy is a good measure of the bound form of flavin in the enzyme."

In addition, some uncoupling of the normal reaction occurs, with glyoxylate and H2O adition, some uncoupling of the normal reaction occurs, with glyoxylate and H2O2 as products. Glyoxylate is also a substrate (presumably as its hydrate); in this case, the reaction products are oxalate and H2O2. Evidence is presented that the enzyme recognizes glycollate as a prochiral substrate, differentiating between the Re- and Si-faces of the alpha carbon atom. Two highly fluorescent species are formed concomitantly from the reaction with glycollate; they are proposed to be covalent alpha-glycollyl adducts to the reduced flavin position N(5). One of these adducts is labile and in rapid equilibrium with oxidized enzyme and glycollate, and with the complex of reduced enzyme and glyoxylate; this adduct is a catalytically competent intermediate. The other adduct is comparatively stable (t 1/2 for decay = 20 min at 25 degrees C) and does not react with O2. It is formed at a rate approximately 1% that of the catalytic adduct, but because of its lack of reaction with O2 and its stability, it gradually accumulates during catalytic turnover, resulting in catalytically incompetent enzyme. An isotope effect of approximately 4 is found in the reduction of oxidized enzyme flavin and in the formation of the labile fluorescent adduct, when alpha-2H2-glycollate or (R)-glycollate-2-d is used, but not with the (S)-glycollate-2-d enantiomer. It is concluded that the catalytic adduct is formed by hydrogen abstraction from the Re-face of glycollate."

The two enzymes co-purified to homogeneity from both peroxisomal and soluble fractions of spinach leaves. The evidence indicates that the two activities are associated with the same protein. The peroxisomal and soluble enzyme preparations had nearly identical properties, suggesting that the soluble enzyme is from broken peroxisomes. The two enzyme preparations utilized various L-amino acids as amino donors in the following order of activity with glyoxylate as amino acceptor; serine greater than alanine greater than tryptophan greater than asparagine greater than 5-hydroxytryptophan. Other amino acids tested were all much less active. With L-tryptophan as amino donor, the effective amino acceptors were glyoxylate and hydroxypyruvate; other 2-oxo acids tested were all inactive.

In these studies, we have reinvestigated trypsin activation of factor XI and demonstrate that trypsin-activated factor XI contains three chains of apparent Mr = 46,000, 37,000, and 26,000. Kinetic studies lead to the conclusion that the parent chain of Mr = 80,000 is cleaved into chains of Mr = 46,000 and 37,000.

https://openalex.org/W1496840819,"A variety of acyl esters of salicyclic acid and 3,5-dibromosalicylic acid have been prepared and examined for their ability to place the acyl group on hemoglobin. In general, short chain acyl groups (C2 and C3) are more reactive than longer chains (C4 to C10), but longer chains may be more effective with intact red cells because of their enhanced ability to permeate the erythrocyte membrane. The brominated salicyl esters also exhibit enhanced permeation of the membrane, as well as increased activity due to activation at the acyl site. Bis(salicyl) esters, nonbrominated and brominated, are more reactive than corresponding monoesters, and those from C4 dicarboxylic acids connect beta subunits by covalent bridges. These double-headed aspirins have the attractive features of being bound selectively by hemoglobin and of forming a covalent cross-link that may influence the conformation of the tetramer."
https://openalex.org/W1675225715,"The in which there is no net transport of reducing equivalents mediated by glutamate and aspartate movements across the mitochondrial membrane has been studied using nonrespiring liver mitochondria, supplied with a given extramitochondrial ATP/ADP ratio. Absorbance shifts in safranine have been used as a probe to estimate the membrane potential generated under these conditions. Measurements of the asymmetric distribution of substrate anions and of reducing potential across the limiting membrane gave estimated differences of between 2.2 and 3.3 kcal when the ATP/ADP ratio in the suspending medium was about 30. The estimated membrane potential under these conditions was about 140 mV. All of the above parameters were decreased in a corresponding manner when the ATP/ADP ratio imposed from outside was decreased. A strong inflection in the slope of correlated parameters was obtained when the ATP/ADP ratio was below about 0.5. On the other hand, there was a linear relationship between the membrane potential and the asymmetric poise of reducing equivalents and of carbon metabolites. It is concluded that the poise of reducing equivalents mediated by the malate-aspartate shuttle is determined principally by the membrane potential through its effect on the electrogenic exchange of glutamate and aspartate."

Based on prior evidence, the minimum illumination time required for postillumination phosphorylation in thylakoid membranes is taken as a measure of the time required for formation of a transmembrane pH gradient sufficient to drive ATP synthesis. Our results are consistent with the view that, following illumination, as the transient transmembrane electric gradient decays, the establishment and maintenance of a pH gradient serves for energy transfer from the photosystems to the ATP synthase complex."
https://openalex.org/W43794836,"Self-iodinated lactoperoxidase co-polymerizes with brain microtubules to constant specific activity and a stoichiometry of 0.2 to 0.3 lactoperoxidase molecule/tubulin heterodimer polymerized in the presence of 4 M glycerol. By contrast, iodinated tubulin loses its competence to polymerize. The lactoperoxidase-microtubule association is salt- and temperature-sensitive, shows considerable specificity, is saturable, and is reversible. Lactoperoxidase does not displace the microtubule-associated proteins from microtubules, does not promote polymerization, and binds to preformed microtubules. Self-iodinated lactoperoxidase also binds to tubulin oligomers at 0 degrees C and in the presence of CaCl2. The stoichiometry for this interaction is 0.6 to 0.8 molecules of enzyme/dimer. Lactoperoxidase forms a complex with soluble brain tubulin prepared by two cycles of polymerization and depolymerization or by phosphocellulose chromatography. The interaction was studied by sucrose gradient analysis, gel filtration, and spectral analysis based on the finding that tubulin binding to lactoperoxidase leads to a red shift in the Soret spectrum, yielding a difference spectrum with a minimum of 410 nm and maximum at 430 nm. This interaction involves one or more sulfhydryl groups of tubulin. Complex formation is relatively slow, is retarded by 0.6 M NaCl, and is accelerated by diiodotyrosine. By all three methods of analysis, the stoichiometry approaches a value of 2 lactoperoxidase molecules/tubulin dimer. There is a single class of binding sites in pig, beef, or rat tubulin with an apparent overall affinity constant of approximately 2.0 x 10(6) M-1. The molecular weight of the complex by sucrose gradient or gel filtration is approximately 140,000 i.e. half of the expected value for a 2:1 adduct. Since both alpha and beta subunits are present in the complex, we propose that the complex consists of a mixture of equal parts of presumably native alpha-tubulin-lactoperoxidase and beta-tubulin-lactoperoxidase."

Immunoprecipitations of the cell-free translation products demonstrate that the 17,500-dalton protein has immunologic determinants which are specifically recognized by antisera to calcitonin. In addition, the relative prominence of this protein is significantly diminished when mRNA from lines with low calcitonin content is used to direct cell-free protein synthesis. This evidence suggests that the initial translation product of calcitonin mRNA is a 17,500-dalton species which must undergo subsequent processing to generate the secreted polypeptide."

Neither the agonists carbamylcholine and oxotremorine nor the antagonist atropine did influence the dissociation rate (k-2) of the receptor . antagonist complex. Binding of the antagonist (A) takes place in two consecutive steps: (formula: see text). Agonists did not seem to influence the dissociation constant (k-1/k+1) of the first binding step, while atropine caused a large increase in this constant. These results indicate that while antagonist-antagonist competition can be explained in terms of competition for the free receptor (R), antagonist-agonist competition cannot be fitted with such a simple model."

https://openalex.org/W1607239286,"delta 5-3-Ketosteroid isomerase from Pseudomonas putida is subject to photoinactivation by light of wavelengths greater than 300 nm, specifically in the presence of the competitive inhibitor, 1,4,6-androstatrien-3-one-17 beta-ol (TEO). In the absence of this steroid or in the presence of the nonchromophoric steroidal competitive inhibitor, deoxycholate, the enzyme activity is essentially unaffected by irradiation. Deoxycholate protects the enzyme from the TEO-dependent reaction to a degree which is predictable from the concentrations of deoxycholate and TEO and their respective competitive inhibition constants, thus demonstrating that the inititial velocity of the photoinactivation is dependent upon the fraction of enzyme active sites occupied by TEO. Cholate, which is not a competitive inhibitor, does not protect enzyme activity. Amino acid analyses of hydrochloric acid hydrolysates of the photoinactivated enzyme show no significant differences from that of the native enzyme. However, the fraction of initial enzyme activity remaining correlates quantitatively with the disappearance of one of the four thiol groups in each polypeptide chain of the enzyme. Enzyme irradiated under the same conditions in the absence of TEO does not lose thiol groups."

https://openalex.org/W303585796,"Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.8) from beef brain has been purified 3100-fold to apparent homogeneity using a purification procedure based on GMP-Sepharose affinity chromatography. The native enzyme has a molecular weight of 84,000 as determined by gel filtration studies. A subunit molecular weight of 26,000 was obtained by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, suggesting that the enzyme is a trimer. Two forms of the enzyme have been separated by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing. Basic pI values of 7.85 and 8.10 were obtained for the two forms. These values are much higher than have been observed with any other purified phosphoribosyltransferase. The amino acid composition of the enzyme is 18 Lys, 6 His, 9 Arg, 1 Trp, 6 Cys, 28 Asx, 12 Thr, 16 Ser, 19 Glx, 10 Pro, 23 Gly, 16 Ala, 17 Val, 5 Met, 11 Ile, 19 Leu, 9 Tyr, and 8 Phe. An unusual basic amino acid, yet to be identified, was also present. The enzyme exhibits Km values of 0.42 microM for guanine, 0.99 microM for hypoxanthine, 18.6 microM for P-Rib-PP in the presence of guanine, and 2.9 microM for P-Rib-PP in the presence of hypoxanthine."
