https://openalex.org/W3049048202,"Humoral responses in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are often of limited durability, as seen with other human coronavirus epidemics. To address the underlying etiology, we examined post mortem thoracic lymph nodes and spleens in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and observed the absence of germinal centers and a striking reduction in Bcl-6+ germinal center B cells but preservation of AID+ B cells. Absence of germinal centers correlated with an early specific block in Bcl-6+ TFH cell differentiation together with an increase in T-bet+ TH1 cells and aberrant extra-follicular TNF-α accumulation. Parallel peripheral blood studies revealed loss of transitional and follicular B cells in severe disease and accumulation of SARS-CoV-2-specific ""disease-related"" B cell populations. These data identify defective Bcl-6+ TFH cell generation and dysregulated humoral immune induction early in COVID-19 disease, providing a mechanistic explanation for the limited durability of antibody responses in coronavirus infections, and suggest that achieving herd immunity through natural infection may be difficult."
https://openalex.org/W3082542755,"Abnormal epigenetic patterns correlate with effector T cell malfunction in tumours1-4, but the cause of this link is unknown. Here we show that tumour cells disrupt methionine metabolism in CD8+ T cells, thereby lowering intracellular levels of methionine and the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and resulting in loss of dimethylation at lysine 79 of histone H3 (H3K79me2). Loss of H3K79me2 led to low expression of STAT5 and impaired T cell immunity. Mechanistically, tumour cells avidly consumed methionine and outcompeted T cells for methionine by expressing high levels of the methionine transporter SLC43A2. Genetic and biochemical inhibition of tumour SLC43A2 restored H3K79me2 in T cells, thereby boosting spontaneous and checkpoint-induced tumour immunity. Moreover, methionine supplementation improved the expression of H3K79me2 and STAT5 in T cells, and this was accompanied by increased T cell immunity in tumour-bearing mice and patients with colon cancer. Clinically, tumour SLC43A2 correlated negatively with T cell histone methylation and functional gene signatures. Our results identify a mechanistic connection between methionine metabolism, histone patterns, and T cell immunity in the tumour microenvironment. Thus, cancer methionine consumption is an immune evasion mechanism, and targeting cancer methionine signalling may provide an immunotherapeutic approach."
https://openalex.org/W3082035823,"Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is a receptor in human cells that senses foreign cyclic dinucleotides that are released during bacterial infection and in endogenous cyclic GMP-AMP signalling during viral infection and anti-tumour immunity1-5. STING shares no structural homology with other known signalling proteins6-9, which has limited attempts at functional analysis and prevented explanation of the origin of cyclic dinucleotide signalling in mammalian innate immunity. Here we reveal functional STING homologues encoded within prokaryotic defence islands, as well as a conserved mechanism of signal activation. Crystal structures of bacterial STING define a minimal homodimeric scaffold that selectively responds to cyclic di-GMP synthesized by a neighbouring cGAS/DncV-like nucleotidyltransferase (CD-NTase) enzyme. Bacterial STING domains couple the recognition of cyclic dinucleotides with the formation of protein filaments to drive oligomerization of TIR effector domains and rapid NAD+ cleavage. We reconstruct the evolutionary events that followed the acquisition of STING into metazoan innate immunity, and determine the structure of a full-length TIR-STING fusion from the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. Comparative structural analysis demonstrates how metazoan-specific additions to the core STING scaffold enabled a switch from direct effector function to regulation of antiviral transcription. Together, our results explain the mechanism of STING-dependent signalling and reveal the conservation of a functional cGAS-STING pathway in prokaryotic defence against bacteriophages."
https://openalex.org/W3082772719,"Tropane alkaloids from nightshade plants are neurotransmitter inhibitors that are used for treating neuromuscular disorders and are classified as essential medicines by the World Health Organization1,2. Challenges in global supplies have resulted in frequent shortages of these drugs3,4. Further vulnerabilities in supply chains have been revealed by events such as the Australian wildfires5 and the COVID-19 pandemic6. Rapidly deployable production strategies that are robust to environmental and socioeconomic upheaval7,8 are needed. Here we engineered baker's yeast to produce the medicinal alkaloids hyoscyamine and scopolamine, starting from simple sugars and amino acids. We combined functional genomics to identify a missing pathway enzyme, protein engineering to enable the functional expression of an acyltransferase via trafficking to the vacuole, heterologous transporters to facilitate intracellular routing, and strain optimization to improve titres. Our integrated system positions more than twenty proteins adapted from yeast, bacteria, plants and animals across six sub-cellular locations to recapitulate the spatial organization of tropane alkaloid biosynthesis in plants. Microbial biosynthesis platforms can facilitate the discovery of tropane alkaloid derivatives as new therapeutic agents for neurological disease and, once scaled, enable robust and agile supply of these essential medicines."
https://openalex.org/W3082942379,"Innate immunity is associated with Alzheimer's disease1, but the influence of immune activation on the production of amyloid-β is unknown2,3. Here we identify interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) as a γ-secretase modulatory protein, and establish a mechanism by which inflammation affects the generation of amyloid-β. Inflammatory cytokines induce the expression of IFITM3 in neurons and astrocytes, which binds to γ-secretase and upregulates its activity, thereby increasing the production of amyloid-β. The expression of IFITM3 is increased with ageing and in mouse models that express familial Alzheimer's disease genes. Furthermore, knockout of IFITM3 reduces γ-secretase activity and the formation of amyloid plaques in a transgenic mouse model (5xFAD) of early amyloid deposition. IFITM3 protein is upregulated in tissue samples from a subset of patients with late-onset Alzheimer's disease that exhibit higher γ-secretase activity. The amount of IFITM3 in the γ-secretase complex has a strong and positive correlation with γ-secretase activity in samples from patients with late-onset Alzheimer's disease. These findings reveal a mechanism in which γ-secretase is modulated by neuroinflammation via IFITM3 and the risk of Alzheimer's disease is thereby increased."
https://openalex.org/W3082691473,"Most general anaesthetics and classical benzodiazepine drugs act through positive modulation of γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors to dampen neuronal activity in the brain1-5. However, direct structural information on the mechanisms of general anaesthetics at their physiological receptor sites is lacking. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of GABAA receptors bound to intravenous anaesthetics, benzodiazepines and inhibitory modulators. These structures were solved in a lipidic environment and are complemented by electrophysiology and molecular dynamics simulations. Structures of GABAA receptors in complex with the anaesthetics phenobarbital, etomidate and propofol reveal both distinct and common transmembrane binding sites, which are shared in part by the benzodiazepine drug diazepam. Structures in which GABAA receptors are bound by benzodiazepine-site ligands identify an additional membrane binding site for diazepam and suggest an allosteric mechanism for anaesthetic reversal by flumazenil. This study provides a foundation for understanding how pharmacologically diverse and clinically essential drugs act through overlapping and distinct mechanisms to potentiate inhibitory signalling in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W3081651558,"Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) fuse the inner and outer membranes of the nuclear envelope. They comprise hundreds of nucleoporins (Nups) that assemble into multiple subcomplexes and form large central channels for nucleocytoplasmic exchange1,2. How this architecture facilitates messenger RNA export, NPC biogenesis and turnover remains poorly understood. Here we combine in situ structural biology and integrative modelling with correlative light and electron microscopy and molecular perturbation to structurally analyse NPCs in intact Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells within the context of nuclear envelope remodelling. We find an in situ conformation and configuration of the Nup subcomplexes that was unexpected from the results of previous in vitro analyses. The configuration of the Nup159 complex appears critical to spatially accommodate its function as an mRNA export platform, and as a mediator of NPC turnover. The omega-shaped nuclear envelope herniae that accumulate in nup116Δ cells3 conceal partially assembled NPCs lacking multiple subcomplexes, including the Nup159 complex. Under conditions of starvation, herniae of a second type are formed that cytoplasmically expose NPCs. These results point to a model of NPC turnover in which NPC-containing vesicles bud off from the nuclear envelope before degradation by the autophagy machinery. Our study emphasizes the importance of investigating the structure-function relationship of macromolecular complexes in their cellular context."
https://openalex.org/W3082136743,"Single-cell barcoding technologies enable genome sequencing of thousands of individual cells in parallel, but with extremely low sequencing coverage (<0.05×) per cell. While the total copy number of large multi-megabase segments can be derived from such data, important allele-specific mutations-such as copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in cancer-are missed. We introduce copy-number haplotype inference in single cells using evolutionary links (CHISEL), a method to infer allele- and haplotype-specific copy numbers in single cells and subpopulations of cells by aggregating sparse signal across hundreds or thousands of individual cells. We applied CHISEL to ten single-cell sequencing datasets of ~2,000 cells from two patients with breast cancer. We identified extensive allele-specific copy-number aberrations (CNAs) in these samples, including copy-neutral LOHs, whole-genome duplications (WGDs) and mirrored-subclonal CNAs. These allele-specific CNAs affect genomic regions containing well-known breast-cancer genes. We also refined the reconstruction of tumor evolution, timing allele-specific CNAs before and after WGDs, identifying low-frequency subpopulations distinguished by unique CNAs and uncovering evidence of convergent evolution."

https://openalex.org/W3082268778,"The opsin family of G-protein-coupled receptors are used as light detectors in animals. Opsin 5 (also known as neuropsin or OPN5) is a highly conserved opsin that is sensitive to visible violet light1,2. In mice, OPN5 is a known photoreceptor in the retina3 and skin4 but is also expressed in the hypothalamic preoptic area (POA)5. Here we describe a light-sensing pathway in which POA neurons that express Opn5 regulate thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT). We show that Opn5 is expressed in glutamatergic warm-sensing POA neurons that receive synaptic input from several thermoregulatory nuclei. We further show that Opn5 POA neurons project to BAT and decrease its activity under chemogenetic stimulation. Opn5-null mice show overactive BAT, increased body temperature, and exaggerated thermogenesis when cold-challenged. Moreover, violet photostimulation during cold exposure acutely suppresses BAT temperature in wild-type mice but not in Opn5-null mice. Direct measurements of intracellular cAMP ex vivo show that Opn5 POA neurons increase cAMP when stimulated with violet light. This analysis thus identifies a violet light-sensitive deep brain photoreceptor that normally suppresses BAT thermogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3082402696,"The current novel coronavirus (nCoV) pandemic, COVID-19, was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has spread globally, causing startling loss of life, stalling the global economy, and disrupting social life. One of the challenges to contain COVID-19 is convincing people to adopt personal hygiene, social distancing, and self-quarantine practices that are related to knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of the residents of respective countries. Bangladesh, a densely populated country with a fast-growing economy and moderate literacy rate, has shown many hiccups in its efforts to implement COVID-19 policies. Understanding KAP may help policy makers produce informed decisions. This study assessed KAP in relation to COVID-19 in Bangladesh. An online survey using a pre-tested questionnaire conducted in late March 2020 attained 1,837 responses across Bangladesh. Ultimately, 1,589 completed responses were included in a statistical analysis to calculate KAP scores and their interrelations with sociodemographic variables. The overall KAP was poor, with only 33% of the participants demonstrating good knowledge, whereas 52.4% and 44.8% of the subjects showed good attitudes and practices, respectively. Sociodemographic factors had strong bearings on the KAP scores. Significantly higher KAP scores were evident in females over males, among aged 45 years and older over younger participants, and among retired workers and homemakers over students and public service employees. This study indicated a panic fuelled by poor understanding of COVID-19 associated facts and the need for the government to ensure more granular and targeted awareness campaigns in a transparent and factual manner to foster public confidence and ensure more meaningful public participation in mitigation measures. This study provides a KAP baseline regarding COVID-19 among Bangladeshis."

https://openalex.org/W3081989981,"DNA assembly is an integral part of modern synthetic biology, as intricate genetic engineering projects require robust molecular cloning workflows. Golden Gate assembly is a frequently employed DNA assembly methodology that utilizes a Type IIS restriction enzyme and a DNA ligase to generate recombinant DNA constructs from smaller DNA fragments. However, the utility of this methodology has been limited by a lack of resources to guide experimental design. For example, selection of the DNA sequences at fusion sites between fragments is based on broad assembly guidelines or pre-vetted sets of junctions, rather than being customized for a particular application or cloning project. To facilitate the design of robust assembly reactions, we developed a high-throughput DNA sequencing assay to examine reaction outcomes of Golden Gate assembly with T4 DNA ligase and the most commonly used Type IIS restriction enzymes that generate three-base and four-base overhangs. Next, we incorporated these findings into a suite of webtools that design assembly reactions using the experimental data. These webtools can be used to create customized assemblies from a target DNA sequence or a desired number of fragments. Lastly, we demonstrate how using these tools expands the limits of current assembly systems by carrying out one-pot assemblies of up to 35 DNA fragments. Full implementation of the tools developed here enables direct expansion of existing assembly standards for modular cloning systems (e.g. MoClo) as well as the formation of robust new high-fidelity standards."
https://openalex.org/W3082215451,"Neural stem cells (NSCs) in the dentate gyrus (DG) reside in a specialized local niche that supports their neurogenic proliferation to produce adult-born neurons throughout life. How local niche cells interact at the circuit level to ensure continuous neurogenesis from NSCs remains unknown. Here we report the role of endogenous neuropeptide cholecystokinin (CCK), released from dentate CCK interneurons, in regulating neurogenic niche cells and NSCs. Specifically, stimulating CCK release supports neurogenic proliferation of NSCs through a dominant astrocyte-mediated glutamatergic signaling cascade. In contrast, reducing dentate CCK induces reactive astrocytes, which correlates with decreased neurogenic proliferation of NSCs and upregulation of genes involved in immune processes. Our findings provide novel circuit-based information on how CCK acts on local astrocytes to regulate the key behavior of adult NSCs."

The Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) was used in the study. Based on research, five main types of the level of the material deprivation of European Union countries were identified. Research findings suggest that the population of old EU countries is less severely affected by material deprivation than people living in new member states. Also, the level of global material deprivation was assessed. The study was based on 2016 statistical data delivered by Eurostat."
https://openalex.org/W3082139831,"Aberrations in epigenetic modulation dysregulate transcription, playing a critical role in the developmental process of tumors, including lung cancer. Aberrant levels of the histone 3 lysine-27 demethylase KDM6A have been found in cancer and are either positively or negatively associated with tumorigenesis and prognosis. However, the clinical relevance and functional role of KDM6A in lung cancer is largely unknown. We found that KDM6A protein expression was higher in NSCLC tissues than in the corresponding paracancer tissues and that high KDM6A expression was associated with poor patient prognosis. Furthermore, KDM6A knockdown in NSCLC cell lines markedly inhibited the tumorigenic phenotype both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, KDM6A colocalized and cooperated with KMT2B to reprogram the transcriptional network via regulating the cancer pathway, in which abnormal activation of the Wnt pathway is the dominant factor. Interestingly, in NSCLC cell lines, H3K4me3 but not H3K27me2/3 or H3K4me1/2 was markedly altered upon KDM6A or KMT2B knockdown, indicating that KDM6A may act independently of H3K27 demethylases in NSCLC. Taken together, these results indicated that KDM6A or KMT2B may be a prognostic biomarker and promising therapeutic target in NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W3081558438,"Branched-chain α-keto acids (BCKAs) are catabolites of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). Intracellular BCKAs are cleared by branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH), which is sensitive to inhibitory phosphorylation by BCKD kinase (BCKDK). Accumulation of BCKAs is an indicator of defective BCAA catabolism and has been correlated with glucose intolerance and cardiac dysfunction. However, it is unclear whether BCKAs directly alter insulin signaling and function in the skeletal and cardiac muscle cell. Furthermore, the role of excess fatty acids (FAs) in perturbing BCAA catabolism and BCKA availability merits investigation. By using immunoblotting and ultra-performance liquid chromatography MS/MS to analyze the hearts of fasted mice, we observed decreased BCAA-catabolizing enzyme expression and increased circulating BCKAs, but not BCAAs. In mice subjected to diet-induced obesity (DIO), we observed similar increases in circulating BCKAs with concomitant changes in BCAA-catabolizing enzyme expression only in the skeletal muscle. Effects of DIO were recapitulated by simulating lipotoxicity in skeletal muscle cells treated with saturated FA, palmitate. Exposure of muscle cells to high concentrations of BCKAs resulted in inhibition of insulin-induced AKT phosphorylation, decreased glucose uptake, and mitochondrial oxygen consumption. Altering intracellular clearance of BCKAs by genetic modulation of BCKDK and BCKDHA expression showed similar effects on AKT phosphorylation. BCKAs increased protein translation and mTORC1 activation. Pretreating cells with mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin restored BCKA's effect on insulin-induced AKT phosphorylation.

A strong association between plasma BCAAs, muscle BCAA catabolic gene expression, and insulin resistance (IR) is reported in several human and rodent models of obesity (1Biswas D. Duffley L.

Whether defects in muscle BCAA-catabolizing enzyme expression and activity precede or follow obesity-induced IR remains unclear. Strikingly, in ob/ob and diet-induced obese (DIO) mice, BCKDK inhibition normalized BCAA catabolism and attenuated IR (23Zhou M. Shao J. Wu C.Y. Shu L. Dong W. Liu Y. Chen M. Wynn R.M. Wang J. Wang J. Gui W.J. Qi X. Lusis A.J. Li Z.

Therefore, restoring BCAA catabolism and clearing BCAA metabolites in endocrine disorders present beneficial functional outcomes. Conversely, accumulation of BCAA catabolites likely causes maladaptive substrate metabolism and organ dysfunction. However, it remains unknown whether BCKAs directly impact muscle insulin signaling to influence substrate utilization and mitochondrial function. A recent report demonstrated that incubation of cardiomyocytes with excess BCKAs reduces glucose uptake (24Renguet E. Ginion A. Gélinas R. Bultot L. Auquier J. Robillard Frayne I. Daneault C.

In the current study, we demonstrated post-translational changes in BCAA-catabolizing enzyme expression and increased circulating BCKAs, but not BCAAs, in the fasted mouse heart. However, in the skeletal muscle but not the heart of mice subjected to DIO, circulating BCKA levels increased with a concomitant decrease in BCAA-catabolizing enzyme expression. The effects of DIO on BCAA-catabolizing enzyme expression and BCKA content were replicated in vitro by treating cells with saturated FA palmitate. Additionally, we observed that treatment with exogeneous BCKAs or increasing intracellular BCKA levels by modulating BCKDHA and BCKDK enzymes resulted in impaired insulin signaling and function in the cardiac and skeletal muscle. Last, we demonstrated that BCKAs can activate protein translation, and its effect on insulin signaling is likely attributable to mTOR signaling activation. We examined whether acutely limiting nutrient intake (fasting) alters transcriptional or post-translational levels of BCAA catabolic enzymes in the cardiac and skeletal muscle (Fig. 1A). Male C57BL/6J mice subjected to overnight fasting exhibited a decline in body weight, serum glucose, and liver weight (Table S1) when compared with either ad libitum fed or refed mice. Ventricular weight to body weight ratio remained unchanged between groups (Table S1). Fasting increased serum BCKA levels (total and individual), whereas refeeding restored them to ad libitum fed levels (Fig. 1B). Unlike BCKAs, serum BCAAs levels remained unchanged following fasting but increased after refeeding (Fig. 1C). To confirm whether changes in circulating BCKAs were an outcome of altered BCAA catabolism, we examined protein markers of the BCAA catabolic pathway in the gastrocnemius muscle and heart. Inactivating phosphorylation of BCKDE1α at Ser-293 (suggestive of decreased BCKDHA activity) and total protein content of BCKDHA and BCKDK were unaltered in the gastrocnemius muscle (Fig. 1D). However, a marked increase in phosphorylation of BCKDE1α at Ser-293 was observed in the fasted hearts, which returned to fed levels upon 4 h of refeeding (Fig. 1E). Interestingly, BCKDHA protein levels were decreased upon fasting and were restored in the hearts of refed mice (Fig. 1E). In the heart, BCKDK protein levels remained unaltered across all the groups (Fig. 1E). Phosphorylated BCKDE1α Ser-293 levels in the heart (Fig. S1A) but not the gastrocnemius muscles (Fig. S1B) correlated with circulating BCKAs. Because nutritional changes are accompanied by changes in circulating insulin (decreased in fasting and increased in refeeding), we examined whether protein expression of BCAA-catabolizing enzymes corresponded with changes in AKT phosphorylation, an effector of insulin signaling. Immunoblot assessment of isoform-specific AKT phosphorylation revealed that AKT1 and AKT2, at Ser-473 and Ser-474, respectively, increased following refeeding in both gastrocnemius muscle (Fig. 1D) and heart (Fig. 1E). However, fasting decreased AKT2 Ser-474, but not AKT1 Ser-473, phosphorylation in both gastrocnemius muscle (Fig. 1D) and heart (Fig. 1E). Regardless of the tissue-specific changes in BCAA-catabolizing enzymes, AKT phosphorylation in both the heart (Fig. S1C) and gastrocnemius muscles (Fig. S1D) was negatively correlated with serum BCKAs. Notably, the changes in the BCAA catabolic protein expression and intracellular and circulating BCKAs were independent of mRNA expression changes of BCAA catabolic enzymes (Bckdha, Bckdk, Bcat2, Klf15, Oxct2a, Ivd2, Hmgcs1, and Mut) in both gastrocnemius and cardiac muscle (Fig. S1, E and F). Therefore, short-term physiological changes in insulin is associated with altered protein expression of BCAA-catabolizing enzymes and systemic BCKA content. During fasting, decreased insulin relieves inhibition of fatty acid oxidation in the muscle (26Ukropcova B. McNeil M. Sereda O. de Jonge L. Xie H. Bray G.A. Smith S.R. Dynamic changes in fat oxidation in human primary myocytes mirror metabolic characteristics of the donor.J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115 (16007256): 1934-194110.1172/JCI24332Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Because muscle BCAA-catabolizing enzyme expression decreased in the presence of excess lipids, we postulated that FAs compete with BCAAs as muscle substrates by likely regulating expression and activity of BCAA-catabolizing enzymes to govern BCAA catabolism. We ascertained whether amino acid–metabolizing enzymes in the muscle and systemic BCKAs were temporally regulated in a model of hyperinsulinemia and progressive lipid excess (DIO). Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat high-sucrose (HFHS) diet, and blood and tissues were collected at 2, 4, 8, and 13 weeks after feeding to determine the BCAA catabolic enzyme expression in the gastrocnemius muscle and heart (Fig. 2A). Systemic BCKA levels were down-regulated only at 13 weeks after HFHS feeding (Fig. 2B). Circulating BCAA levels remained unaltered across chow and HFHS groups at all time points (Fig. S2A). To examine the effect of progressive lipid loading on BCAA-metabolizing enzymes, we compared the expression profile of genes involved in BCAA catabolism in the gastrocnemius muscles between 2 weeks and 13 weeks of HFHS feeding. mRNA expression of Mut and Ivd2, intermediary effector enzymes of the BCAA oxidation pathway, was reduced in the gastrocnemius muscle at 13-week compared with 2-week HFHS-fed mice (Fig. 2C), consistent with a prior report in mice fed a (60%) high-fat diet (27Lerin C. Goldfine A.B. Boes T. Liu M. Kasif S. Dreyfuss J.M. De Sousa-Coelho A.L. Daher G. Manoli I. Sysol J.R. Isganaitis E. Jessen N. Goodyear L.J. Beebe K. Gall W. et al.Defects in muscle branched-chain amino acid oxidation contribute to impaired lipid metabolism.Mol. Metab. 2016; 5 (27689005): 926-93610.1016/j.molmet.2016.08.001Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Hmgcs1 levels were up-regulated in the gastrocnemius muscle in 13-week HFHS fed mice compared with 2-week HFHS fed mice (Fig. 2C), possibly as a compensatory mechanism to supply 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA for Hmgcl to maintain CoA pools. In the heart, mRNA expression of the BCAA catabolic enzymes, except for KLF15, remained unaltered in a setting of DIO (Fig. 2D). Because the earliest changes in mRNA expression were not detected until 13 weeks, we used 4-week, and not 2-week, HFHS-fed mice as controls to analyze protein expression. Phosphorylation of BCKDE1α at Ser-293 in the gastrocnemius muscles was unchanged at 8 weeks but increased at 13 weeks in HFHS-fed mice compared with the 4-week HFHS-fed mice (Fig. 2E). Unlike the fasted state (acute lipid turnover), no changes in BCKDH complex phosphorylation were found in hearts from HFHS-fed mice (chronic lipid excess) compared with chow-fed (Fig. 2F). AKT1 Ser-473 phosphorylation trended to decline in the gastrocnemius muscles (Fig. 2E) of 13-week HFHS-fed mice but remained unchanged in the heart (Fig. 2F), signifying a likely reduction in insulin action with progressive nutrient overload in the skeletal muscle during obesity. Together, these data demonstrate that unlike acute fasting, chronic HFHS feeding down-regulates enzymes involved in BCAA catabolism in the gastrocnemius muscle but not the heart. Chronic lipid overload not only drives IR but also increases systemic and myocellular BCAAs (1Biswas D. Duffley L. Pulinilkunnil T.

To simulate the gradual increase in FAs observed in obesity and IR ex vivo, C2C12 cells were treated with low (0.2 mm), intermediate (0.4 mm), and high (0.8 mm) palmitate for 16 h. Exposure to palmitate did not alter the expression of proximal BCAA-catabolizing genes (Bcat2, Bckdha) or the regulatory kinase, Bckdk (Fig. 3A). However, the intermediary (Acadsm, Ivd2) and distal (Hibch, Mut) genes were significantly down-regulated in the 0.8 mm palmitate-treated cells (Fig. 3A). Acadsm levels were also reduced in response to 0.4 mm palmitate treatment (Fig. 3A). As observed in HFHS-fed gastrocnemius muscles, Hmgcs1 was markedly up-regulated in all three palmitate-treated groups (Fig. 3A). Our data revealed that palmitate mimicked the effect of DIO on BCAA-catabolizing gene expression in vitro. To examine whether decreased mRNA expression of distal BCAA-oxidizing enzymes resulted in decreased BCAA catabolism, we measured intracellular BCKAs and BCAAs. Total and individual BCKAs were markedly elevated in 0.8 mm palmitate-treated cells (Fig. 3B), plausibly suggesting suppression of BCKA oxidation. This effect was not observed in cells treated with intermediate and low concentrations of palmitate (Fig. 3B). Intracellular BCAA levels remained unchanged across all treatment groups (Fig. 3C). Similar to that observed in physiological (fasting) and pathological (DIO) models of altered nutrient status, increases in BCKA levels corresponded with decreased phosphorylation of AKT1 and AKT2 at Ser-473 and Ser-474, respectively (Fig. 3, D and E), thereby calling into question the relationship between BCKAs and insulin signaling. Because lipid overload altered the expression of distinct BCAA catabolic enzymes and increased BCKA levels, at least in the skeletal muscle, we examined whether BCKAs influence muscle insulin signaling. BCKAs are emerging as clinically relevant biomarkers for IR (28Menni C. Fauman E. Erte I. Perry J.R. Kastenmüller G. Shin S.Y. Petersen A.K. Hyde C. Psatha M. Ward K.J. Yuan W. Milburn M. Palmer C.N.

Acute (30-min) treatment of C2C12 cells with 0.05 mm 4-methyl 2-oxopentanoic acid sodium salt (KIC), sodium-3-methyl-2-oxobutyrate (KIV), 3-methyl-2-oxovaleric acid sodium salt (KMV), or a combination of all three (BCKAs) decreased insulin-induced phosphorylation of AKT1 at Ser-473 and AKT2 at Ser-474 (Fig. 4A). Moreover, treating C2C12 cells with pathological concentrations of KIC (1, 2, and 5 mm) also resulted in a concentration-dependent impairment of insulin-induced AKT1 phosphorylation at Ser-473 (Fig. S3A). Notably, insulin-mediated activating phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) at Tyr-612 was inhibited by KIC at a concentration of 5 mm but not 1 or 2 mm (Fig. S3A). KIC-mediated inhibition of AKT1 and IRS1 phosphorylation was observed at 15 min and persisted until 30 min of KIC treatment (Fig. S3B). However, phosphorylated AKT1 levels were restored to control levels at 60 min (Fig. S3B). Similar to C2C12 cells, the inhibitory effect of KIC on insulin-stimulated AKT1 phosphorylation was also recapitulated in the rat L6 muscle cell line (Fig. S3C). Because BCKAs inhibited insulin signaling per se, we next tested whether BCKAs modified palmitate-induced inhibition of insulin signaling. In L6 cells incubated with 0.4 mm palmitate, KIC exacerbated palmitate-mediated decreases in AKT1 Ser-473 phosphorylation and phosphorylation of IRS1 at Tyr-612 (Fig. S3D), whereas in C2C12 cells, KIC's effect on AKT and IRS phosphorylation was exacerbated by palmitate (Fig. 4B). To address whether other ketoacids also impact skeletal muscle insulin signaling in the presence of palmitate, we treated C2C12 cells with 5 mm KIV (Fig. 4C), KMV (Fig. 4D), and a combination of all three BCKAs (Fig. 5A) in the presence or absence of 0.4 mm palmitate. Similar to the effect of KIC, AKT1 Ser-473 phosphorylation was impaired by both KIV and KMV in the absence of palmitate (Fig. 3, B and C). Moreover, KIV's effects on AKT and IRS phosphorylation were also exacerbated by palmitate as seen with KIC in C2C12 cells (Fig. 4C). KMV did not exacerbate palmitate-induced impairment of insulin signaling (Fig. 4, C and D). A combination of all BCKAs significantly reduced AKT1 phosphorylation at Ser-473 but did not exacerbate palmitate-induced insulin signaling impairment in C2C12 cells (Fig. 5A). Immunoprecipitation studies revealed reduced activating tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1 at residue 612 upon BCKA stimulation in C2C12 cells (Fig. 5B). Consistent with reduced AKT1 phosphorylation, insulin-induced AKT1 activity (Fig. 5C) and glucose uptake (Fig. 5D) were also decreased by KIC and KIV. KMV did not influence AKT1 activity and glucose uptake, perhaps reflecting its more modest ability to inhibit insulin signaling and function in C2C12 cells (Fig. 5D). Our data are consistent with a recent report that demonstrated that BCKAs inhibits insulin signaling in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (23Zhou M. Shao J. Wu C.Y. Shu L. Dong W. Liu Y. Chen M. Wynn R.M. Wang J.

KIC inhibited insulin-mediated AKT1 Ser-473 phosphorylation in the absence of palmitate not only in skeletal muscle cell lines but also in primary cells, such as neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) (Fig. 5E) and adult rat cardiomyocytes (ARCMs) (Fig. 5F). KIC exacerbated palmitate-induced insulin signaling impairment in ARCMs, but not in NRCMs (Fig. 5, E and F). Similarly, treatment with KIV and KMV also decreased insulin-stimulated AKT1 Ser-473 phosphorylation in ARCMs (Fig. S4A–B).

Metrics such as number of publications per researcher, h-indexes, and average number of citations were also assessed. Of the 1,047 researchers studied, 673 (64.3%) had at least one profile on the four sites, and the number of researchers having multiple profiles decreased as more sites were studied. Researchers with only one profile numbered 385 (36.8%), while 204 (19.5%) had two, 68 (6.5%) had three, and only 16 (1.5%) had four. ResearchGate had by far the highest number of researchers present, with 569 (54.3%), whereas presence on the other sites was about 15%. We found that, apart from Academia.edu, researchers in Sciences, Technology, and Medicine (STM) were over-represented. Overall, experienced male researchers were over-represented on the sites studied. Our results show that, because of the numerous profiles lacking publication references (particularly on ORCID) and a low presence of researchers on the four sites studied (except for ResearchGate), assessing the number of publications, h-indexes, or average number of citations per article of individuals or institutions remains challenging. Finally, our data showed that French researchers have not adopted the use of the two author identifier sites (i.e. ORCID and ResearcherID). As long as French researchers remain reticent, these sites will not be able to provide the services for which they were created: addressing the problem of author misidentification, consequently providing exhaustive access to scientific production and bibliometric indicators of individual researchers and their institutions."

TS mutants have distinct advantages in that they provide the ability to negatively regulate protein function without having to change the transcriptional context of the gene, add chemicals, or change media (23Kofoed M. Milbury K.L. Chiang J.H. Sinha S. Ben-Aroya S. Giaever G. Nislow C. Hieter P. Stirling P.C. An updated collection of sequence barcoded temperature-sensitive alleles of yeast essential genes.G3 (Bethesda). 2015; 5 (26175450): 1879-188710.1534/g3.115.019174Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Furthermore, by simply altering the temperature at which cells are grown, TS mutant proteins can be studied in a context in which they retain function (permissive temperature), lose function (nonpermissive temperature), or have partial function (semipermissive temperature) (24Ben-Aroya S. Coombes C. Kwok T. O'Donnell K.A. Boeke J.D. Hieter P. Toward a comprehensive temperature-sensitive mutant repository of the essential genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol.

Despite the long-term use of TS mutants, much is still left to discover in terms of the properties and mechanisms leading to temperature sensitivity. Many of the forward genetics screening processes that produce TS mutants result in multiple mutations, which can make determination of which mutations are causative and what mechanism is underlying the altered phenotype difficult. It has been predicted that the majority of phenotype-causing missense mutations in humans alter protein structure and lead to changes in protein stability or protein-protein interactions (PPIs) (26Sahni N. Yi S. Taipale M. Fuxman Bass J.I. Coulombe-Huntington J. Yang F. Peng J. Weile J. Karras G.I. Wang Y. Kovács I.A. Kamburov A. Krykbaeva I. Lam M.H.

This suggests that biophysical details behind a phenotype can likely be revealed by analyzing the cell-wide impacts of missense mutations on the proteome. For instance, an unbiased proteome-wide method for characterizing the global impact of temperature-sensitive mutations on PPIs would increase our ability to link genotype to phenotype in existing, uncharacterized mutants. It would also aid in the development of TS mutants for mechanistic studies of essential genes from any model system. More importantly, any approach developed to examine TS mutants could have broad applicability to studies on phenotype and/or disease-causing protein sequence variants in complex biological systems. Current widely used approaches, such as mRNA sequencing and global proteomics, provide valuable insight on expression levels; however, they provide no insights into potential changes in protein structure and/or PPIs. Large-scale PPI analysis continues to develop using MS-based workflows (27Huttlin E.L. Bruckner R.J. Paulo J.A. Cannon J.R. Ting L. Baltier K. Colby G. Gebreab F. Gygi M.P. Parzen H. Szpyt J. Tam S.

Additionally, large-scale interactome studies have to this point been focused on the normal cellular sequence variant for each target protein (known as the bait), leaving protein sequence variants out of consideration. Studies that have incorporated the use of human protein sequence variants into their analysis have been limited by the use of expression systems that are unlikely to reflect the native proteome (26Sahni N.

A nontargeted, proteome-wide MS methodology to evaluate how sequence variants in a protein of interest could affect PPI networks would improve our ability to predict the phenotypic outcomes of genomic mutations and would be more scalable than affinity purification–based approaches. Additionally, broad surveys of protein stability could provide unique biophysical insights, which can be directly compared with complementary computational methods, such as molecular dynamics and multisite λ-dynamics simulations. Nontargeted MS-based analyses have included approaches to characterize protein complex characteristics without affinity purification, including chromatography-based co-fractionation and thermal proximity co-aggregation (TPCA), which is a cellular thermal shift assay/TPP–related method (35Kirkwood K.J.

These methods have shown a great deal of promise but have not been fully developed for the investigation of disease-causing protein variants. From these studies, we propose that TPP-based analysis of protein thermal stability could have sufficient specificity and sensitivity to detect both large and small changes in PPI dynamics. Prior TPP experiments have revealed both direct and indirect consequences of on- and off-target drug and ligand binding through shifts in protein melt, suggesting that it could have broad applicability to discover biophysical changes in proteins in varying conditions (41Becher I.

To explore the utility of thermal profiling-based methods for analysis of protein sequence variants that result in pronounced cellular fitness defects within the context of the proteome, we have performed mutant TPP analysis (mTPP) in TS mutant yeast using quantitative MS (57Jafari R.

Missense mutations could alter protein structure and lead to changes in PPIs within associated complexes and, in theory, affect the thermal stability of either the individual protein or the entire PPI network as a consequence of structural or PPI interface changes. Therefore, we hypothesized that mTPP could be applied to study the effects of missense mutations on the proteome to link phenotype-causing mutations to PPI networks. This work clearly shows that mutant TPP is a useful application of thermal profiling for studying genetic perturbations in diverse cellular systems, laying a foundation for novel characterization of the biophysical mechanisms within the context of native proteomes. For our model system in these experiments, we chose TS yeast strains with missense mutations within individual subunits of the 26S proteasome complex, an essential protein complex responsible for the majority of selective proteolysis occurring in the cell (60Coux O.

The yeast proteasome is a large multisubunit protein complex made up of 33 subunits that form two subcomplexes: a 19S regulatory particle and a 20S core complex. Subunits within the 19S regulatory particle recognize and selectively bind ubiquitylated substrates and deubiquitylate and unfold them (62Finley D.

Substrates are then mechanically translocated into the proteolytic chamber of the 20S core for degradation (63Finley D. Ulrich H.D. Sommer T. Kaiser P.

Data were collected from the SMEs of the manufacturing industry of Pakistan. The significance of the model was assessed using the PLS-SEM (structural equation modeling). The findings of the study revealed a positive and significant relationship between supervisory behavior and sustainable employee behavior. Similarly, conflict management strategies had a positive effect on the relationship between supervisory behavior and sustainable employee behavior. This study adds in the current literature of supervisory behavior as a critical predictor of sustainable employee performance in two ways. Firstly, this study validates Conflict management strategies as an influential mediator between the relationship of supervisory behavior and sustainable employee performance. Secondly, this study provides substantial practical implications for managers at SMEs to enhance sustainable employee performance through supervisory behavior, stimulated by conflict management strategies. This study is based on cross-sectional data; more longitudinal studies can further strengthen the generalizability of relationships between the constructs. The study adds in the current literature of PLS-SEM as an assessment model for direct and mediation relationships."
https://openalex.org/W3082747635,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first identified in Wuhan, China and has since become pandemic. In response to the first cases identified in the United States, close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases were investigated to enable early identification and isolation of additional cases and to learn more about risk factors for transmission. Close contacts of nine early travel-related cases in the United States were identified and monitored daily for development of symptoms (active monitoring). Selected close contacts (including those with exposures categorized as higher risk) were targeted for collection of additional exposure information and respiratory samples. Respiratory samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Four hundred four close contacts were actively monitored in the jurisdictions that managed the travel-related cases. Three hundred thirty-eight of the 404 close contacts provided at least basic exposure information, of whom 159 close contacts had ≥1 set of respiratory samples collected and tested. Across all actively monitored close contacts, two additional symptomatic COVID-19 cases (i.e., secondary cases) were identified; both secondary cases were in spouses of travel-associated case patients. When considering only household members, all of whom had ≥1 respiratory sample tested for SARS-CoV-2, the secondary attack rate (i.e., the number of secondary cases as a proportion of total close contacts) was 13% (95% CI: 4–38%). The results from these contact tracing investigations suggest that household members, especially significant others, of COVID-19 cases are at highest risk of becoming infected. The importance of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers is also underlined. Isolation of persons with COVID-19, in combination with quarantine of exposed close contacts and practice of everyday preventive behaviors, is important to mitigate spread of COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3081726774,"Encapsulated ferritins belong to the universally distributed ferritin superfamily, whose members function as iron detoxification and storage systems. Encapsulated ferritins have a distinct annular structure and must associate with an encapsulin nanocage to form a competent iron store that is capable of holding significantly more iron than classical ferritins. The catalytic mechanism of iron oxidation in the ferritin family is still an open question because of the differences in organization of the ferroxidase catalytic site and neighboring secondary metal-binding sites. We have previously identified a putative metal-binding site on the inner surface of the Rhodospirillum rubrum encapsulated ferritin at the interface between the two-helix subunits and proximal to the ferroxidase center. Here we present a comprehensive structural and functional study to investigate the functional relevance of this putative iron-entry site by means of enzymatic assays, MS, and X-ray crystallography. We show that catalysis occurs in the ferroxidase center and suggest a dual role for the secondary site, which both serves to attract metal ions to the ferroxidase center and acts as a flow-restricting valve to limit the activity of the ferroxidase center. Moreover, confinement of encapsulated ferritins within the encapsulin nanocage, although enhancing the ability of the encapsulated ferritin to undergo catalysis, does not influence the function of the secondary site. Our study demonstrates a novel molecular mechanism by which substrate flux to the ferroxidase center is controlled, potentially to ensure that iron oxidation is productively coupled to mineralization.

The nanocages formed by the quaternary structure of DPS, DPSL, Ftn, and bacterioferritin allow iron oxidation and mineralization to occur within a biochemically privileged environment within the cell, which protects the host cell from iron-induced oxidative stress. Interestingly, the recently described IMEF and EncFtn proteins both have ferroxidase activity, but they do not form nanocage structures on their own; instead they must be localized to the lumen of encapsulin nanocages to form a competent iron store (4Giessen T.W.

EncFtn and IMEF are directed into encapsulins by a terminal localization sequence that binds to the interior wall of encapsulin. The EncFtn proteins form a distinct homodecameric annular assembly comprising a pentamer of dimers with D5 symmetry (Fig. 1A). Each EncFtn subunit is formed of two long anti-parallel helices (α1 and α2) followed by a shorter helix (α3) (Fig. 1B); this is in contrast to the classical ferritins, which have 4-helix subunits. The annular assembly has two classes of 2-fold symmetry forming two distinct dimer interfaces. One of the dimer assemblies contains the FOC across the dimer interface, with the two iron ions bound within the interface (Fig. 1C, FOC dimer). The other dimer forms a back-to-back conformation, exposing the metal ion binding residues, and is known as the nonFOC dimer (Fig. 1D) (24Ross J. Lambert T. Piergentili C. He D. Waldron K.J.

A model for the engagement of EncFtn decamers with the encapsulin nanocage has been proposed based on the crystallographic model of the Thermotoga maritima encapsulin complex (15He D. Hughes S.

Biol. 2008; 15 (19172747): 939-94710.1038/nsmb.1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In this model the C-terminal encapsulation sequence of the EncFtn interacts with a specific binding site on the encapsulin monomer, which is oriented to face the lumen of the nanocage (Fig. S1). This model places the central hole of the EncFtn decamer directly under the pores formed at the icosahedral 5-fold axis of the encapsulin nanocage, which would form a pathway for iron to transit across the encapsulin shell toward the putative metal entry site. The residues lining the 5-fold pore in the encapsulin nanocage are not well conserved between species, and based on crystallographic evidence, this pore is primarily made up of main-chain atoms, implying that this pore does not have a role as a selectivity filter. The catalytic route to iron mineralization in the different ferritin iron stores is still a subject of vigorous debate (23Chasteen N.D. Harrison P.M.

Furthermore, an additional metal-binding site located on the inner surface of the dodecamer has been identified in members of the DPSL proteins; because of its location, this site is reminiscent of the third iron site in Escherichia coli ferritins and bacterioferritins and it is proposed to be involved in the iron translocation through the protein shell (9Gauss G.H.

A partially occupied metal ion site was present on the outer surface (proposed exit site) of the EncFtn decamer, and a highly occupied metal ion site was present on the inner face (proposed entry site), which is proximal to the ferroxidase center (Fig. 2, A and B). Both of these sites are found at dimer interfaces between the two-helix EncFtn subunits and are formed when the four-helical ferritin fold is reconstituted by the iron-mediated assembly of the EncFtn ferroxidase center (24Ross J.

In our structure of the Rhodospirillum rubrum EncFtn protein, the entry site coordinates a calcium ion from the crystallization solution in a symmetrical arrangement of glutamic acid residues (Glu-31/Glu-34) and a tryptophan residue (Trp-38) contributed by each chain from the ferroxidase center dimer (24Ross J. Lambert T. Piergentili C. He D. Waldron K.J. Mackay C.L. Marles-Wright J. Clarke D.J. Mass spectrometry reveals the assembly pathway of encapsulated ferritins and highlights a dynamic ferroxidase interface.Chem. Commun. 2020; 56 (32090213): 3417-342010.1039/c9cc08130eCrossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). The metal coordination distances between the side-chain carboxylic acid oxygens and calcium ion are 2.1 Å for Ca–Glu-31–Ox and 2.7 Å for Glu34–Ox, which are similar to the Fe-Glu-Ox coordination distances seen in the FOC of 2.2–2.6 Å. We hypothesize that this site acts as an entry site for iron ions approaching the ferroxidase center and acts in some way to control the access of metal ions to the active site of the protein (Fig. 2C). The glutamic acid residues in the entry site are arranged in such a way as to capture and coordinate an Fe(II) ion in an octahedral geometry before passing it to the FOC. The positioning of Trp-38 adjacent to this site suggests that the indole ring sterically constrains the position of the Glu-31 side chain to an optimal position for metal coordination. We have considered several hypotheses regarding the functional role of the entry site, including acting as a flow restrictor valve to limit the flow of metal ions to the FOC (“valve” function), an electrostatic funnel to direct metal ions to the FOC (“attraction” function), a discriminatory filter to avoid mis-metalation and consequent inhibition of the active site (“filter” function) (Fig. 2, D–F), or for protein stability and assembly (“stabilizing” function). It is also possible that these functions may overlap, and the entry site may play a number of key roles in the stability and activity of the encapsulated ferritins. To understand the role of the entry site, a number of single-point amino acid variants of the R. rubrum EncFtn protein were produced to replace the residue of interest with nonmetal-binding residues. These variants were produced in the isolated R. rubrum EncFtn protein alone and in an R. rubrum Enc:EncFtn co-expression system. We produced and purified recombinant E31A, E34A, and W38G/A variants of EncFtn and the Enc:EncFtn complex and analyzed the solution and gas-phase behavior of these proteins to understand the influence of these variants on the stability of the EncFtn complex. We obtained X-ray crystal structures of the E31A and E34A variants of the EncFtn protein and found that their structures display altered entry site geometry and the abrogation of metal binding in this site. The functional role of the entry site was explored biochemically; we show that changes to the metal coordinating amino acids in this site enhance the ferroxidase activity of the EncFtn protein and increase its susceptibility to inhibition by competing zinc ions. Taken together, these results indicate that the entry site plays a minor role in stabilizing the oligomeric state of the EncFtn decamer and has a dual role as a site of metal ion attraction and as a flow restrictor valve to limit metal access to the ferroxidase center and thus slow the oxidation of ferrous ions to ferric ions. To explore the functional roles of the residues in the entry site of the R. rubrum EncFtn, single-point variants were produced by site-directed mutagenesis, removing each metal-binding residue in turn and substituting each with alanine or glycine. The average molecular masses of the EncFtn proteins were confirmed by LC–MS (Table S1). The resulting variants were also generated in association with the encapsulin to produce Enc:EncFtn complexes. Changes to the ferroxidase center affect both the assembly and activity of the R. rubrum EncFtn (EncFtn-WT) (15He D. Hughes S. Vanden-Hehir S. Georgiev A. Altenbach K. Tarrant E. Mackay C.L.

In addition to its N-terminal catalytic glycosylase domain, NEIL3 contains two tandem C-terminal GRF-type zinc fingers that are absent in the other NEIL paralogs. ssDNA binding by the GRF–ZF motifs helps recruit NEIL3 to replication forks converged at an ICL, but the nature of DNA binding and the effect of the GRF–ZF domain on catalysis of base excision and ICL unhooking is unknown. Here, we show that the tandem GRF–ZFs of NEIL3 provide affinity and specificity for DNA that is greater than each individual motif alone. The crystal structure of the GRF domain shows that the tandem ZF motifs adopt a flexible head-to-tail configuration well-suited for binding to multiple ssDNA conformations. Functionally, we establish that the NEIL3 GRF domain inhibits glycosylase activity against monoadducts and ICLs. This autoinhibitory activity contrasts GRF–ZF domains of other DNA-processing enzymes, which typically use ssDNA binding to enhance catalytic activity, and suggests that the C-terminal region of NEIL3 is involved in both DNA damage recruitment and enzymatic regulation.

The structure of the NEIL3–GD explains the enzyme's preference for ssDNA, because it lacks two of the three residues important for intercalating into the dsDNA during excision of the damaged nucleobase (9Liu M.

Unlike NEIL1, NEIL2, and the other Nei members, NEIL3 further contains a 323-residue C-terminal extension with three zinc finger (ZF) motifs—an internal RanBP/NPL4-type (NZF) and two glycine–arginine–phenylalanine (GRF) ZFs (10Krokeide S.Z.

Despite our understanding of the role of the GRF domain on recruitment of NEIL3 to converged forks at an ICL (28Wu R.A. Semlow D.R. Kamimae-Lanning A.N. Kochenova O.V. Chistol G. Hodskinson M.R.

Here, we report the first crystal structure of the NEIL3 GRF domain and probe the role for GRF DNA binding on NEIL3 ICL unhooking and base excision. We find that ssDNA binding by NEIL3's GRF motifs inhibits NEIL3 enzymatic activity. In addition, the structural flexibility between tandem GRF motifs suggests that this domain can adapt to a variety of ssDNA conformations. The individual NEIL3 GRF motifs have been shown to bind ssDNA (28Wu R.A. Semlow D.R. Kamimae-Lanning A.N. Kochenova O.V. Chistol G. Hodskinson M.R. Amunugama R. Sparks J.L. Wang M. Deng L.

We purified GST fusions (Fig. S1) of the Mus musculus (m)NEIL3 individual GRF1 and GRF2 and tandem GRF12 proteins and used electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) to probe DNA binding to 40-mer ssDNA, dsDNA, and fork (splayed arm) DNA structures, the latter of which contained a 20-nt dsDNA region with 20-nt ssDNA arms. Each GRF construct bound ssDNA, but not dsDNA (Fig. 1, A–C), consistent with previous results from Xenopus laevis (x)NEIL3 (28). We also observed that the individual and tandem GRF motifs bound fork DNA with an affinity similar to that of ssDNA. Notably, the tandem GRF12 protein displayed 5–10-fold higher affinity for ssDNA and fork DNA (apparent Kd = 10 nm) compared with the isolated GRF1 or GRF2 constructs (Kd,app = 50–100 nm). In addition, the GRF12 domain showed only one major protein–DNA complex band in EMSAs (Fig. 1A), whereas the individual GRF1 and GRF2 motifs exhibited multiple protein–DNA bands indicative of nonspecific binding at higher protein concentrations (Fig. 1, B and C). Despite the appearance of the plotted data shown in Fig. 1 (B and C), there is no statistically significant difference between the affinities of GRF1 and GRF2 for either ssDNA or forked DNA. In control experiments, neither purified recombinant GST (Fig. 1D) nor a NEIL3 GST–NZF domain fusion (Fig. 1E) bound DNA with appreciable affinity. These results indicate that the NEIL3 GRF12 domain binds ssDNA with no apparent specificity for a fork structure and that the tandem GRF motifs bind with higher affinity and specificity than either GRF motif alone. To shed light on the basis for cooperative DNA binding by the GRF12 domains, we crystallized and determined a 2.6 Å crystal structure of human (h)NEIL3 GRF12 domain using single-wavelength anomalous dispersion at the zinc edge (Fig. 2A and Fig. S2). The final model, which contains two GRF12 protomers per asymmetric unit, was refined to a crystallographic residual of 22.7% (Rwork) and 26.6% (Rfree) with reasonable statistics (Table 1). The structure resembles a butterfly, in which two side-by-side GRF motifs are joined by a three-residue flexible linker and oriented in a head-to-tail fashion, with the zinc-binding loops on opposite corners of the molecul"

Methods This prospective case series included 50 eyes of 50 patients undergoing phacoemulsification and implantation of the Clareon® CNA0T0 IOL using the AutonoMe® automated delivery system in the Department of Ophthalmology, Keio University School of Medicine. The clinical data were collected from 46 eyes of 46 patients preoperatively and 1 day, 1 week, and 1 and 3 months postoperatively. Endothelial-side incision gaping, posterior incision retraction, and Descemet’s membrane detachment were recorded as present or absent using anterior-segment optical coherence tomography postoperatively. Results The uncorrected distance and corrected distance visual acuities improved and stabilized 1 week postoperatively. The anterior chamber depth was stable from 1 week postoperatively. The subjective refraction was stable from 1 day postoperatively. Descemet’s membrane detachments and endothelial-side wound gaping were seen in 19 (41.3%) eyes and 34 (73.9%) eyes 1 day postoperatively and decreased gradually. Posterior incision retraction was seen in eight eyes (17.4%) on day 1 and increased to 19 eyes (41.3%) 3 months postoperatively. Conclusions The Clareon IOL had excellent refractive stability from day 1 postoperatively. The AutonoMe automated delivery system enables safe IOL implantation through a 2.4-mm corneal incision, although the wound required longer than 1 month to heal postoperatively."
https://openalex.org/W3081931373,"Angiogenesis inhibitors, such as the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor sunitinib, target vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling in cancers. However, only a fraction of patients respond, and most ultimately develop resistance to current angiogenesis inhibitor therapies. Activity of alternative pro-angiogenic growth factors, acting via RTK or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR), may mediate VEGF inhibitor resistance. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)β isoform is uniquely coupled to both RTK and GPCRs. We investigated the role of endothelial cell (EC) PI3Kβ in tumor angiogenesis. Pro-angiogenic GPCR ligands were expressed by patient-derived renal cell carcinomas (PD-RCC), and selective inactivation of PI3Kβ reduced PD-RCC-stimulated EC spheroid sprouting. EC-specific PI3Kβ knockout (ΕC-βKO) in mice potentiated the sunitinib-induced reduction in subcutaneous growth of LLC1 and B16F10, and lung metastasis of B16F10 tumors. Compared to single-agent sunitinib treatment, tumors in sunitinib-treated ΕC-βKO mice showed a marked decrease in microvessel density, and reduced new vessel formation. The fraction of perfused mature tumor microvessels was increased in ΕC-βKO mice suggesting immature microvessels were most sensitive to combined sunitinib and PI3Kβ inactivation. Taken together, EC PI3Kβ inactivation with sunitinib inhibition reduces microvessel turnover and decreases heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment, hence PI3Kβ inhibition may be a useful adjuvant antiangiogenesis therapy with sunitinib."

Acetylation of Pif1 exacerbated its overexpression toxicity phenotype, which was alleviated upon deletion of its N terminus. Biochemical assays demonstrated that acetylation of Pif1 stimulated its helicase, ATPase, and DNA-binding activities, whereas maintaining its substrate preferences.

Along with chromatin remodeling, access to the DNA is provided through either the active or passive action of helicases, which function to unwind dsDNA into its complementary single strands. Approximately 1% of the genes in eukaryotic genomes code for helicases, and to date, over 100 RNA and DNA helicases have been discovered (2Brosh Jr., R.M.

Following its initial discovery in yeast mitochondria over 20 years ago, Pif1 has been shown to also localize to the nucleus, where it participates in a myriad of DNA transactions. It functions in Okazaki fragment maturation, wherein it lengthens the flap ahead of DNA polymerase δ, allowing RPA to bind to the displaced flap (11Rossi M.L. Pike J.E. Wang W. Burgers P.M. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. Pif1 helicase directs eukaryotic Okazaki fragments toward the two-nuclease cleavage pathway for primer removal.J. Biol.

Recently, it was determined that the rate of replication on lagging strands containing G4s is delayed in the absence of Pif1, underscoring the need for Pif1 to unwind regions that are difficult to replicate due to the presence of DNA secondary structures (12Dahan D. Tsirkas I. Dovrat D. Sparks M.A. Singh S.P. Galletto R. Aharoni A. Pif1 is essential for efficient replisome progression through lagging strand G-quadruplex DNA secondary structures.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 (30395308): 11847-1185710.1093/nar/gky1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Pif1 also stimulates the activity of polymerase δ during break-induced replication through bubble migration (13Wilson M.A. Kwon Y. Xu Y. Chung W.H. Chi P. Niu H. Mayle R. Chen X. Malkova A. Sung P. Ira G. Pif1 helicase and Poldelta promote recombination-coupled DNA synthesis via bubble migration.Nature. 2013; 502 (24025768): 393-39610.1038/nature12585Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Furthermore, prior to mitosis, Pif1 helps to resolve R-loops and aid in protein displacement from tDNA (tRNA genes) (8Tran P.L.T. Pohl T.J. Chen C.F. Chan A. Pott S. Zakian V.A. PIF1 family DNA helicases suppress R-loop mediated genome instability at tRNA genes.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 (28429714): 1502510.1038/ncomms15025Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), whereas within the ribosomal DNA (rDNA), it is required for maintaining arrest at the replication fork barrier (14Ivessa A.S. Zhou J.Q. Zakian V.A. The Saccharomyces Pif1p DNA helicase and the highly related Rrm3p have opposite effects on replication fork progression in ribosomal DNA.Cell. 2000; 100 (10693764): 479-48910.1016/S0092-8674(00)80683-2Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Additionally, Pif1 acts as a negative regulator of telomerase, both at telomeric ends and sites of double-strand breaks (DSBs) where it prevents telomere addition, allowing for the recruitment of DSB repair factors (15Boulé J.B. Vega L.R. Zakian V.A. The yeast Pif1p helicase removes telomerase from telomeric DNA.Nature. 2005; 438 (16121131): 57-6110.1038/nature04091Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 16Makovets S.

Given Pif1's involvement in a plethora of cellular activities, it still remains a mystery how its numerous activities are regulated. Structurally, Pif1 is divided into three domains: N terminus, helicase core, and C terminus. A wealth of research has improved our understanding of the structural motifs and related functions of the helicase domain, but in comparison, little is known about the N- and C-terminal domains of Pif1. Currently, these regions are postulated to be modular accessory domains that may serve as regulatory regions (9Nickens D.G. Sausen C.W. Bochman M.L.

We hypothesize that the functional significance of these domains may help to maintain specific folds that are necessary for protein function and establish points for post-translational modifications (PTMs) (21Fairman-Williams M.E. Guenther U.P. Jankowsky E. SF1 and SF2 helicases: family matters.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2010; 20 (20456941): 313-32410.1016/j.sbi.2010.03.011Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Protein PTMs serve to expand a protein's functional toolbox by altering cellular localization and impacting protein structure, function, and availability, whereas mediating novel interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids (22Deribe Y.L.

Acetylation of the ε-amino group on a lysine residue is one such PTM that has been studied in the context of modulating chromatin architecture for many decades (23Allfrey V.G. Faulkner R. Mirsky A.E.

Because the sequence coding for Pif1 is fairly rich in lysine residues (∼10% of the whole sequence), an amino acid that serves as a good target for many PTMs, we were interested in investigating the acetylation dynamics of Pif1. In the current study, we aimed to specifically explore the lysine acetylation status of Pif1, identify the enzymes that dynamically mediate this modification, and elucidate the impact of acetylation on the protein's cellular functions and alterations to its biochemical activities. Using Pif1-FLAG overexpression constructs, we compared cellular toxicity in WT and acetyltransferase or deacetylase mutant strains. Based on the growth phenotypes, we determined that the acetyltransferase (KAT), NuA4 (Esa1), and its counteracting deacetylase (KDAC), Rpd3, are responsible for regulating Pif1 overexpression toxicity in vivo. The Pif1 N-terminal domain (PiNt) was critical for this toxicity regulation, as N terminally-truncated Pif1 (Pif1ΔN) did not behave in the same manner as the full-length Pif1. Additionally, using in vitro Piccolo NuA4 (Esa1)-acetylated recombinant protein, we evaluated the impact of this modification on Pif1's biochemical functions: DNA unwinding, G4 resolvase activity, DNA binding, and ATPase activity, and observed a stimulation in all four activities in the acetylated form when compared with the unmodified form of the protein. The results of our cellular assays and in vitro studies indicate that lysine acetylation serves as an important regulator of Pif1 activity within the cell. Acetylation dynamics within the cell are tightly regulated by KATs and counteracting KDACs (33Peng W. Togawa C. Zhang K. Kurdistani S.K. Regulators of cellular levels of histone acetylation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 2008; 179 (18493053): 277-28910.1534/genetics.107.085068Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These lysine modifiers regulate both histone and nonhistone proteins, thereby impacting biochemical activities and cellular processes (34Spange S. Wagner T. Heinzel T. Krämer O.H. Acetylation of non-histone proteins modulates cellular signalling at multiple levels.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2009; 41 (18804549): 185-19810.1016/j.biocel.2008.08.027Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Because the lysine-rich sequence of Pif1 makes it a target for modification by acetylation, we were interested in defining the effect of this modification on the functional activities of Pif1 within the cell. To understand the impact of global cellular acetylation on the function of Pif1, we initially sought to alter the acetylation dynamics in the cell by creating either KAT or KDAC mutant strains. It has previously been reported that the overexpression of Pif1 in S. cerevisiae is toxic to cell growth (35Chang M. Luke B. Kraft C. Li Z. Peter M. Lingner J. Rothstein R. Telomerase is essential to alleviate pif1-induced replication stress at telomeres.Genetics. 2009; 183 (19704012): 779-79110.1534/genetics.109.107631Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 36Nickens D.G. Sausen C.W. Bochman M.L. The biochemical activities of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pif1 helicase are regulated by its N-terminal domain.bioRxiv. 2019; : 59609810.1101/596098Google Scholar, 37Yoshikawa K. Tanaka T. Ida Y. Furusawa C. Hirasawa T. Shimizu H. Comprehensive phenotypic analysis of single-gene deletion and overexpression strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Yeast. 2011; 28 (21341307): 349-36110.1002/yea.1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used this overexpression toxicity phenomenon to develop a phenotypic assay to determine the impact of cellular acetylation. Our hypothesis was that altering the cellular levels of acetylation may influence Pif1 interactions with other proteins and/or its own function, thereby altering the overexpression toxicity phenotype. A galactose-inducible overexpression plasmid was used to overexpress Pif1 in WT, acetyltransferase mutant, and deacetylase deletion mutant cells. However, the growth kinetics (i.e. length of lag phase, doubling rate, and terminal cell density) of S. cerevisiae cells were affected by multiple variables in a somewhat stochastic manner (38Ngo M. Wechter N. Tsai E. Shun T.Y. Gough A. Schurdak M.E. Schwacha A. Vogt A. A high-throughput assay for DNA replication inhibitors based upon multivariate analysis of yeast growth kinetics.SLAS Discov. 2019; 24 (30802412): 669-68110.1177/2472555219829740PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it can be difficult to compare growth curves between independent experiments using the same strain, let alone comparing strains with multiple genetic backgrounds. To overcome these limitations of cell growth analyses, we developed a data analysis method to specifically focus on the effect of Pif1 overexpression regardless of strain background. First, cell growth was monitored by measuring the optical density of liquid cultures at 660 nm (A660) over 48 h, and the mean A660 for each strain was calculated. Then, to determine the effect of Pif1 overexpression on growth, the mean A660 of cells grown in galactose-containing medium was divided by the mean A660 of the same strain grown in glucose-containing medium, which strongly represses the GAL1/10 promoter. Finally, this galactose/glucose ratio for each Pif1-overexpressing strain was normalized to the same ratio from an empty vector control. The normalized growth value for each genotype is interpreted as the toxic effect of Pif1 overexpression in that specific genetic background. The results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 1. Here, we recapitulated the toxicity of Pif1 overexpression reported by others (35Chang M. Luke B. Kraft C. Li Z. Peter M. Lingner J. Rothstein R. Telomerase is essential to alleviate pif1-induced replication stress at telomeres.Genetics. 2009; 183 (19704012): 779-79110.1534/genetics.109.107631Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 36Nickens D.G.

Furusawa C. Hirasawa T. Shimizu H.

To determine whether acetylation of Pif1 had an effect on overexpression in toxicity, we performed similar experiments in KAT mutant cells. Acetyltransferases representative from the Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) family, the MYST family, and p300/CBP family were chosen for our studies (39Roth S.Y. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Histone acetyltransferases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70 (11395403): 81-12010.1146/annurev.biochem.70.1.81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar). The genes encoding the Gcn5 (GNAT) and Rtt109 (p300/CBP) KATs are nonessential and can be cleanly deleted, but the catalytic subunit Esa1 of the NuA4 complex (MYST) is essential (40Smith E.R. Eisen A. Gu W. Sattah M. Pannuti A. Zhou J. Cook R.G. Lucchesi J.C. Allis C.D. ESA1 is a histone acetyltransferase that is essential for growth in yeast.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Esa1p is an essential histone acetyltransferase required for cell cycle progression.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19 (10082517): 2515-252610.1128/mcb.19.4.2515Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), so the temperature-sensitive esa1-414 allele (42Chang C.S. Pillus L. Collaboration between the essential Esa1 acetyltransferase and the Rpd3 deacetylase is mediated by H4K12 histone acetylation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 2009; 183 (19596907): 149-16010.1534/genetics.109.103846Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) was used. This allele has reduced KAT activity at 30 °C but full activity at 25 °C. Pif1 overexpression in the esa1-414 background caused significantly (p < 0.001) reduced toxicity compared with WT when grown at the restrictive temperature (30 °C) but not at the permissive temperature (25 °C) (Fig. 1B). No such effect was observed upon Pif1 overexpression in the gcn5Δ and rtt109Δ backgrounds, suggesting that NuA4 (Esa1) acetylates Pif1 in vivo and that acetylation is connected to Pif1 overexpression toxicity. To address this hypothesis further, the effects of Pif1 overexpression were assessed in a set of S. cerevisiae strains each lacking a single KDAC (Fig. 1C). If hypoacetylation resulted in better growth upon Pif1 overexpression in the esa1-414 cells, then hyperacetylation in one or more KDAC-null backgrounds should exacerbate the toxicity. Indeed, we observed significant (p < 0.001) increases in Pif1 overexpression toxicity in cells lacking KDAC, Rpd3, or Hda2 (Fig. 1C). Unfortunately, we could not test for synergistic Pif1 toxicity in a double rpd3Δ hda2Δ mutant strain because that combination of KDAC deletions is synthetically lethal (data not shown). These results indicate that hyperacetylation of Pif1 in cells lacking Rpd3 or Hda2 leads to increased toxicity upon helicase overexpression. Furthermore, the experiments in Fig. 1B suggest that NuA4 (Esa1) mediates Pif1 acetylation in vivo, and Rpd3 and/or Hda2 are responsible for deacetylating Pif1 (Fig. 1C). It should be noted that NuA4 and Rpd3 are known to have balancing activities in vivo (42Chang C.S. Pillus L. Collaboration between the essential Esa1 acetyltransferase and the Rpd3 deacetylase is mediated by H4K12 histone acetylation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 2009; 183 (19596907): 149-16010.1534/genetics.109.103846Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), lending credence to these results, and thus, we focused on Rpd3 instead of Hda2 herein. Because Pif1 overexpression toxicity was significantly altered in specific KAT and KDAC mutant strains, we were interested in directly confirming if the lysine residues on Pif1 were acetylated in these backgrounds. Based on the results obtained in Fig. 1, B and C, we investigated the acetylation status of overexpressed Pif1-FLAG in the acetylation proficient (rpd3Δ) and acetylation deficient (esa1-414) strains that displayed significant difference in overall cell viability compared with the WT strain. To assess Pif1 acetylation, we immunoprecipitated the lysates with anti-acetyllysine antibody, followed by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody. Input and phosphoglycerate kinase (Pgk1) served as a loading control in all experiments. The Western blotting results showed increased Pif1 acetylation in the rpd3Δ lysate (1.7-fold) and decreased Pif1 acetylation in the esa1-414 lysate compared with the WT (compare lanes 2 and 3 to lane 1, respectively, Fig. 2A), consistent with the results in Fig. 1. These results further confirm that Pif1 acetylation is regulated by the action of NuA4 (Esa1) and its counteracting partner, Rpd3. To test the efficiency of recombinant Piccolo NuA4 (Esa1/Epl1/Yng2 subunits) for acetylating Pif1, we used a previously established in vitro acetylation protocol to modify recombinant Pif1 (29Ononye O.E. Njeri C.W. Balakrishnan L. Analysis of DNA processing enzyme FEN1 and its regulation by protein lysine acetylation.Methods Mol. Biol. 2019; 1983 (31087300): 207-22410.1007/978-1-4939-9434-2_12Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Using an anti-acetyllysine antibody, we were able to detect lysine acetylation of Pif1 on the Piccolo NuA4-modified Pif1 but not on the unmodified form (Fig. 2B), confirming that Piccolo NuA4 was capable of acetylating Pif1. Similarly, autoradiography of in vitro acetylated Pif1 also showed the helicase to be modified, in addition to the autoacetylation of the Esa1, Epl1, and Yng2 subunits of Piccolo NuA4 (Fig. S1). Furthermore, using tandem MS analysis, we were able to identify six acetyllysine sites on the in vitro-modified Pif1: Lys-118, Lys-129, Lys-525, Lys-639, Lys-725, and Lys-800 (Fig. 2C). An example of an acetylation spectrum detecting the +42 Da mass shift is shown in Fig. S2. These results establish a Pif1 acetylation signature that defines two sites of modification in the N-terminal domain (Lys-118 and Lys-129), three in the helicase domain (Lys-525, Lys-639, and Lys-725), and one on the C terminus (Lys-800). The two modified residues clustered in the PiNt were intriguing because although the function of the PiNt is still being elucidated, it has already been shown to regulate some of Pif1's activities and alter its overexpression toxicity in vivo (36Nickens D.G. Sausen C.W. Bochman M.L. The biochemical activities of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pif1 helicase are regulated by its N-terminal domain.bioRxiv. 2019; : 59609810.1101/596098Google Scholar). To investigate this further, we used an N-terminal domain truncation of Pif1 (Pif1ΔN) lacking amino acids 1-233 to determine the role of the PiNt in Pif1 acetylation. We found that similar to modifying the full-length Pif1, Piccolo NuA4 (Esa1) was also able to in vitro acetylate recombinant Pif1ΔN (Fig. 2B), and we detected sites Lys-525, Lys-639, Lys-725, and Lys-800 to be acetylated using MS. Additionally, acetylation of previously determined lysine sites on the helicase and C-terminal domains in the absence of PiNt were confirmed by MS. To assess the contribution of the PiNt to acetylation-dependent toxicity, we used the Pif1ΔN construct in our overexpression toxicity assay, investigating the same genetic backgrounds as in Fig. 1. As previously reported (36Nickens D.G. Sausen C.W. Bochman M.L. The biochemical activities of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pif1 helicase are regulated by its N-terminal domain.bioRxiv. 2019; : 59609810.1101/596098Google Scholar), Pif1ΔN was less toxic in this assay in WT cells than full-length Pif1 (Fig. 3, A and B), exhibiting a toxicity value of ∼0.8 compared with 0.4, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W3082489650,"Structural analyses identified the central domain of ryanodine receptor (RyR) as a transducer converting conformational changes in the cytoplasmic platform to the RyR gate. The central domain is also a regulatory hub encompassing the Ca2+-, ATP-, and caffeine-binding sites. However, the role of the central domain in RyR activation and regulation has yet to be defined. Here, we mutated five residues that form the Ca2+ activation site and 10 residues with negatively charged or oxygen-containing side chains near the Ca2+ activation site. We also generated eight disease-associated mutations within the central domain of RyR2. We determined the effect of these mutations on Ca2+, ATP, and caffeine activation and Mg2+ inhibition of RyR2. Mutating the Ca2+ activation site markedly reduced the sensitivity of RyR2 to Ca2+ and caffeine activation. Unexpectedly, Ca2+ activation site mutation E3848A substantially enhanced the Ca2+-independent basal activity of RyR2, suggesting that E3848A may also affect the stability of the closed state of RyR2. Mutations in the Ca2+ activation site also abolished the effect of ATP/caffeine on the Ca2+-independent basal activity, suggesting that the Ca2+ activation site is also a critical determinant of ATP/caffeine action. Mutating residues with negatively charged or oxygen-containing side chains near the Ca2+ activation site significantly altered Ca2+ and caffeine activation and reduced Mg2+ inhibition. Furthermore, disease-associated RyR2 mutations within the central domain significantly enhanced Ca2+ and caffeine activation and reduced Mg2+ inhibition. Our data demonstrate that the central domain plays an important role in channel activation, channel regulation, and closed state stability. Structural analyses identified the central domain of ryanodine receptor (RyR) as a transducer converting conformational changes in the cytoplasmic platform to the RyR gate. The central domain is also a regulatory hub encompassing the Ca2+-, ATP-, and caffeine-binding sites. However, the role of the central domain in RyR activation and regulation has yet to be defined.

Ryanodine receptor type 2 (RyR2) is an intracellular Ca2+ release channel that is expressed predominantly in the heart and brain and plays an essential role in many cellular processes, including muscle contraction, learning, and memory, by governing the release of Ca2+ from intracellular Ca2+ stores (1Coronado R.

RyR2 is normally activated through a mechanism known as Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR), in which an elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ opens the RyR2 channel, leading to a large Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the endoplasmic reticulum (10Ebashi S. Excitation-contraction coupling and the mechanism of muscle contraction.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53 (2042955): 1-1610.1146/annurev.ph.53.030191.000245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Endo M.

However, despite its physiological and pathological significance, the molecular mechanism underlying Ca2+ activation of RyR2 is not well defined.

Major efforts have been focused on identifying residues that are responsible for Ca2+ activation of RyR2. Through site-directed mutagenesis and single-channel analyses, we showed that a point mutation E3987A in RyR2 dramatically reduced the sensitivity of RyR2 to activation by Ca2+ (25Li P. Chen S.R.

We also reported that point mutation E3885A in RyR3 (corresponding to E3987A in RyR2) markedly decreased the Ca2+ sensitivity of RyR3 (26Chen S.R. Ebisawa K. Li X. Zhang L.

These findings indicate that residue Glu-3987 in RyR2 and the corresponding residue Glu-4032 in RyR1 and Glu-3885 in RyR3 play an important role in Ca2+ activation of RyRs.

Interestingly, the RyR1–Glu-4032 or RyR2–Glu-3987 residue is located just beside the Ca2+ activation site. Although the RyR1–Glu-4032 or RyR2–Glu-3987 residue does not directly contribute to Ca2+ coordination, it is involved in H-bonding between the central domain and the C-terminal domain (CTD) that may stabilize the Ca2+ binding pocket. Furthermore, the putative ATP- and caffeine-binding sites have also been localized to regions very close to the Ca2+ activation site (34Des Georges A. Clarke O.B. Zalk R. Yuan Q. Condon K.J.

For instance, mutations in the Ca2+ activation site (E3848A or E3922A in RyR2) diminished Ca2+ activation of RyR2, whereas mutation W4644A or W4644R in the caffeine-binding site abolished caffeine activation of RyR2 (37Murayama T.

It is also unclear how ATP and caffeine modulate Ca2+ activation of RyR2. To address these important questions, in the present study, we performed a systematic site-directed mutagenesis and structure-function relationship analysis of the central domain of RyR2. Our results revealed that the central domain plays a critical role not only in channel activation by Ca2+, ATP, and caffeine, but also in channel regulation by Mg2+ and in determining the stability of the closed state of the channel in the near absence of Ca2+. Our data also showed that disease-associated RyR2 mutations located within the central domain enhanced Ca2+ activation and reduced Mg2+ inhibition of RyR2. Thus, the central domain controls the activation and regulation of the RyR2 channel. Recent 3D structural analyses revealed the RyR2 Ca2+ activation site that is formed by residues Glu-3848, Glu-3922, Gln-3925, His-3850, and Thr-4931 (35Gong D. Chi X. Wei J. Zhou G. Huang G. Zhang L.

As shown in Fig. 1, there was little or no [3H]ryanodine binding to RyR2 WT in the near absence of Ca2+ (∼0.1 nm). This indicates that there is little or no Ca2+-independent basal activity of RyR2 WT. [3H]ryanodine binding to RyR2 WT was activated at ∼100 nm Ca2+ with an EC50 of 0.21 μm, maximized at ∼1 μm Ca2+, and slightly inactivated at >10 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 1, B, C, and E and Table 1). This is consistent with previous studies (25Li P. Chen S.R. Molecular basis of Ca2+ activation of the mouse cardiac Ca2+ release channel (ryanodine receptor).J. Gen.

Unlike WT, the E3848A mutant displayed a complex Ca2+ dependence of [3H]ryanodine binding. In the near absence of Ca2+, the E3848A mutant exhibited a substantially higher level of [3H]ryanodine binding than WT (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 1, C and E). This indicates that the E3848A mutation markedly increases the Ca2+-independent basal activity of RyR2. Interestingly, different from WT, elevating Ca2+ concentration from ∼1 μm to ∼10 mm decreased (rather than increased) [3H]ryanodine binding to the E3848A mutant. This suggests the existence of a putative Ca2+ inactivation site(s) in RyR2 that is independent of residue Glu-3848. However, at Ca2+ concentrations >10 mm Ca2+, [3H]ryanodine binding to the E3848A mutant increased but did not saturate even at 100 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 1E and Table 1). Because we could not estimate the maximal (saturated) [3H]ryanodine binding to E3848A, we cannot accurately determine the EC50 of Ca2+-dependent activation of E3848A, but it is likely to be greater than 10 mm (Fig. 1E and Table 1). We propose that this increase in [3H]ryanodine binding at Ca2+ concentrations >10 mm reflects the Ca2+-dependent activation of the E3848A mutant, which would be dramatically reduced com"
https://openalex.org/W3082633159,"Inflammation plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Significant association between serum albumin-to-globulin (AG) ratio and inflammation led us to investigate the prognostic value of serum AG ratio for incident CKD.The predictive value of serum AG ratio, white blood cell (WBC), and C-reactive protein (CRP) for CKD development was assessed in 8,057 non-CKD participants from a community-based, prospective cohort in Korea. Serum AG ratio was calculated by following equation: serum albumin (g/L)/[serum total protein (g/L)-serum albumin (g/L)]. Incident CKD was defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and/or proteinuria of more than 1+ on dipstick.Median serum AG ratio was 1.38 (interquartile range, 1.28-1.52). During a mean follow-up duration of 9.1±3.7 years, 1,732 participants (21.5%) developed CKD. In a multivariable Cox analysis, a low serum AG ratio was significantly associated with an increased risk of incident CKD (Q1, serum AG ratio <1.26: hazard ratio [HR] = 1.651, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.406-1.938, Q5 as reference; per 0.2 decrease, HR = 1.170, 95% CI = 1.109-1.234). Serum AG ratio was the only indicator to improve the predictability of CKD development (net reclassification index = 0.158, P <0.001; integrated discrimination improvement = 0.005, P <0.001), compared with WBC or CRP.This study demonstrates that low serum AG ratio is an independent predictor for CKD development and exhibits a stronger predictive value than other inflammatory markers. These findings suggest that determining serum AG ratio may be more valuable for predicting adverse kidney outcomes in non-CKD populations."
https://openalex.org/W3081591791,"A large number of newly synthesized membrane proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are assembled into multiprotein complexes, but little is known about the mechanisms required for assembly membrane proteins. It has been suggested that membrane chaperones might exist, akin to the molecular chaperones that stabilize and direct the assembly of soluble protein complexes, but the mechanisms by which these proteins would bring together membrane protein components is unclear. Here, we have identified that the tail length of the C-terminal transmembrane domains (C-TMDs) determines efficient insertion and assembly of membrane proteins in the ER. We found that membrane proteins with C-TMD tails shorter than ∼60 amino acids are poorly inserted into the ER membrane, which suggests that translation is terminated before they are recognized by the Sec61 translocon for insertion. These C-TMDs with insufficient hydrophobicity are post-translationally recognized and retained by the Sec61 translocon complex, providing a time window for efficient assembly with TMDs from partner proteins. Retained TMDs that fail to assemble with their cognate TMDs are slowly translocated into the ER lumen and are recognized by the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway for removal. In contrast, C-TMDs with sufficient hydrophobicity or tails longer than ∼80 residues are quickly released from the Sec61 translocon into the membrane or the ER lumen, resulting in inefficient assembly with partner TMDs. Thus, our data suggest that C-terminal tails harbor crucial signals for both the insertion and assembly of membrane proteins."

We used the Tumor Cancer Genome Atlas Pan Cancer dataset (TCGA Pan Can) to explore the impact of somatic CNA and gene expression levels (mRNA) of cancer-related genes in ESC. Results were correlated with clinico-pathologic parameters such as age of onset, disease stage, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) (n = 108). 1,449 genes with recurrent somatic CNA were identified, observed in 10% or more tumor samples. Somatic CNA and mRNA expression levels were highly correlated (r> = 0.6) for 383 genes. Among these, 45 genes were classified in the Tier 1 category of Cancer Genome Census-Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer. Eighteen of 45 Tier 1 genes had highly correlated somatic CNA and mRNA expression levels including ARNT, PIK3CA, TBLXR1, ASXL1, EIF4A2, HOOK3, IKBKB, KAT6A, TCEA1, KAT6B, ERBB2, BRD4, KEAP1, PRKACA, DNM2, SMARCA4, AKT2, SS18L1. Our results are in agreement with previously reported somatic CNA for ERBB2, BRD4 and PIK3C in ESC.

https://openalex.org/W3081550806,"The spatial arrangement and pore size distribution play an important role in accumulation and protection of exogenous organic matter (EOM) in the soil, but how different organic materials contribute to modify pore structure is poorly understood. We aimed at exploring possible changes in the complexity of the soil phase during fertilization with different doses of digestate and sludges sourced from the agro-food industry. For this purpose, the short-term effects—one year, of soil fertilization, were investigated in several sampling periods and within two depths (0–25 cm and 25–40 cm). Changes in the specific surface area (SSA), total pore volume (VMIP), total pore area (SMIP), average pore radius (RMIP) and pore size distribution (PSD) were monitored using N2 adsorption/desorption (NAD) and mercury porosimetry (MIP) methods. Our results showed that the intensity of observed changes depended on the type and dose of organic material, soil depth and sampling date. Accumulation of EOM increased with soil depth, masking a large proportion of SSA. Deeper soil layer was more susceptible to changes in the pore size distributions due to the formation of new elongated pores. We concluded that this specific structural porosity was related to the decomposition of organic matter during the formation of soil aggregates."

Dense planting with reduced nitrogen is a sustainable strategy for improving grain yield and nitrogen use efficiency. However, there is little information on the effects of dense planting with reduced nitrogen on direct-seeded inbred rice. Two-year field experiments were conducted with minirhizotron techniques to characterize the root morphological traits and distributions under different nitrogen application rates and sowing densities in two representative inbred rice varieties, Huanghuazhan (HHZ) and Yuenongsimiao (YNSM), grown under three nitrogen application rates (N0: 0 kg ha-1, LN: 135 kg ha-1, HN: 180 kg ha-1) and two sowing densities (LD: 18.75 kg ha-1, HD: 22.5 kg ha-1). Our study showed that dense planting with low nitrogen improved grain yield partly due to the increased panicle number. The higher sowing density with low nitrogen significantly affected the total root number (TRN), total root length (TRL), total root surface area (TRSA), and total root volume (TRV). There was a significant positive correlation between grain yield and TRL in the 10-20-cm soil layer (P < 0.05). The root morphological indexes were positively correlated with dry matter accumulation (P < 0.05) and negatively correlated with nitrogen content (P < 0.05) at the maturity stage.

Recent discoveries called attention to emerging functions of IGF2 in the brain, where it could be involved in processes of learning and memory consolidation. It was also proposed that these functions could be mediated by the receptor for IGF2 (IGF2R). Nevertheless, little is known about the mechanism of signal transduction through this receptor.

Next, we prepared specifically radiolabeled [125I]-monoiodotyrosyl-Tyr2-IGF2 and optimized a sensitive and robust competitive radioligand binding assay for determination of the nanomolar binding affinities of hormones for D11 of IGF2.

https://openalex.org/W3082816549,"Background There has been a paradigm shift in understanding homelessness. The shift is from the belief that homelessness results from lack of secure housing towards the view which explains homelessness in terms of the complex interactions of factors which determine the pathways into and out of homelessness. The evidence base for women’s homelessness is less robust than men’s homelessness. The effect of gender and its relationship with homelessness has been neglected. Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia, is estimated to be home for around 50,000 homeless people. This study aims to explore pathways through homelessness in women who were sheltered in a facility for the homeless in Addis Ababa. Methods In-depth interviews were conducted in 2019 with 14 women who were ‘roofless’, and were gathered for support in a temporary shelter in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The shelter was one of the eight such facilities established in Addis Ababa few months earlier than the study. For data analysis the QDA Miner 5.0.30 software was used and data was analyzed using thematic analysis approach. Results The analysis revealed that determinant factors for pathways into homelessness among women occurred on the background of predisposing factors, such as poverty, being raised by caregivers other than biological parents, child marriage, unstable employment history. On top of the predisposing factors listed above the occurrence of precipitating factors such as problems with marriage, migration, death of parents, deception, became the immediate cause of homelessness. Despite mentions of positive experiences of homelessness such as mutual support and good social life within network of homeless people, the net effect of the interaction between negative and positive experiences of the homeless life, together with the effectiveness of coping strategies by the participants resulted in the participants’ decision of whether homelessness is tolerable. Finally, the presence of perpetuating factors such as lack of affordable house, feeling of shame to go back home, and unfavorable situation at home discouraged participants from exiting the homeless situation. Conclusion From the findings of the study we conclude that the predisposing factors and the precipitating factors resulted in the occurrence of onset of homelessness among the participants. Once homeless, the experiences of life as homeless, and the availability of the means to exit from it determined whether the participants would stay homeless or exit from it."
https://openalex.org/W3082180450,"Cryopreservation of whole organs and specific tissues is an important and continually expanding field of medicine. The protocols currently used for organ preservation do not ensure survivability and functionality; the protocols for ovarian tissue lead to acceptable outcomes, but these are still capable of further improvement. In general, cryopreservation protocols need to be optimized. One important approach to improving cryopreservation protocols in general involves reducing exposure to cytotoxic cryoprotective agents prior to freezing. This study, therefore, evaluated the real-time tissue penetration of dimethyl sulfoxide, a cryoprotective agent that is widely used in cryopreservation. Dimethyl sulfoxide penetration in rat hearts perfused with a 15% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide solution was examined in real-time using dynamic contrast-enhanced micro-computed tomography imaging. Viability of cardiomyocytes was not significantly affected by the dimethyl sulfoxide perfusion procedure. Two different perfusion rates were evaluated and compared with perfusion using a common iodine-based contrast agent (iomeprol). The dynamic contrast-enhanced micro-computed tomography imaging data showed that dimethyl sulfoxide flushes both the extracellular and intracellular spaces in rat heart tissue to 95% equilibration after ≈ 35 s via perfusion. Subsequent wash-out via perfusion is completed to 95% within ≈ 49 s. The equilibration duration routinely used in dimethyl sulfoxide–based protocols for cryopreservation should therefore be questioned. Shorter incubation duration would perhaps be sufficient, as well as being beneficial in relation to cell survivability. It would be helpful to have techniques for non-invasive real-time monitoring of the penetration of cryoprotective agents and such techniques should be used to revise cryopreservation protocols. Switching to perfusion-based equilibration procedures might be beneficial, if feasible."
https://openalex.org/W3082264610,"In increasingly urban landscapes, the loss of native pollen and nectar floral resources is impacting ecologically important pollinators. Increased urbanization has also brought about the rise of urban gardens which introduce new floral resources that may help replace those the pollinators have lost. Recently, studies have shown that the microbial communities of nectar may play an important role in plant-pollinator interactions, but these microbial communities and the floral visitors in urban environments are poorly studied. In this study we characterized the floral visitors and nectar microbial communities of Ascelpias curassavica, a non-native tropical milkweed commonly, in an urban environment. We found that the majority of the floral visitors to A. curassavica were honey bees followed closely by monarch butterflies. We also found that there were several unique visitors to each site, such as ants, wasps, solitary bees, several species of butterflies and moths, Anna's hummingbird, and the tarantula hawk wasp. Significant differences in the nectar bacterial alpha and beta diversity were found across the urban sites, although we found no significant differences among the fungal communities. We found that the differences in the bacterial communities were more likely due to the environment and floral visitors rather than physiological differences in the plants growing at the gardens. Greater understanding of the impact of urbanization on the nectar microbiome of urban floral resources and consequently their effect on plant-pollinator relationships will help to predict how these relationships will change with urbanization, and how negative impacts can be mitigated through better management of the floral composition in urban gardens."
https://openalex.org/W3082590483,"The principal virulence factor of human pathogenic enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli is Shiga toxin (Stx). Shiga toxin 2a (Stx2a) is the subtype most commonly associated with severe disease outcomes such as hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome. The catalytic A1 subunit (Stx2A1) binds to the conserved elongation factor binding C-terminal domain (CTD) of ribosomal P stalk proteins to inhibit translation. Stx2a holotoxin also binds to the CTD of P stalk proteins because the ribosome-binding site is exposed. We show here that Stx2a binds to an 11-mer peptide (P11) mimicking the CTD of P stalk proteins with low micromolar affinity. We cocrystallized Stx2a with P11 and defined their interactions by X-ray crystallography. We found that the last six residues of P11 inserted into a shallow pocket on Stx2A1 and interacted with Arg-172, Arg-176, and Arg-179, which were previously shown to be critical for binding of Stx2A1 to the ribosome. Stx2a formed a distinct P11-binding mode within a different surface pocket relative to ricin toxin A subunit and trichosanthin, suggesting different ribosome recognition mechanisms for each ribosome inactivating protein (RIP). The binding mode of Stx2a to P11 is also conserved among the different Stx subtypes. Furthermore, the P stalk protein CTD is flexible and adopts distinct orientations and interaction modes depending on the structural differences between the RIPs. Structural characterization of the Stx2a-ribosome complex is important for understanding the role of the stalk in toxin recruitment to the sarcin/ricin loop and may provide a new target for inhibitor discovery."

Of them, 1063 patients presented CMV viremia, and 67 patients (93 eyes) were diagnosed with CMV retinitis. We enrolled 66 patients (91 eyes). The main outcomes included the initial best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), BCVA at the diagnosis of retinitis and last visit, involved retinal zone, peak CMV DNA levels in the peripheral blood and aqueous humor, time between HSCT and the diagnosis of retinitis, time between the diagnosis of viremia and retinitis, complications, recurrence, survival, and so on.The mean BCVA (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution) values before HSCT, at the time of retinitis diagnosis, and at the last visit were 0.041 ± 0.076, 0.262 ± 0.529, and 0.309 ± 0.547, respectively. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the involved zone (P = 0.001), time between HSCT and retinitis diagnosis (P = 0.019), and survival status (P = 0.001) were associated with the final visual acuity.The final visual prognosis was worse in patients with greater invasion of the central retinal zone, those with a longer interval between HSCT and the diagnosis of retinitis, and those who died. Prompt diagnosis of CMV retinitis through periodic fundus examinations of patients with CMV viremia can prevent severe vision loss. Once CMV viremia is confirmed, we recommend fundus examinations to be immediately performed and repeated every 2 weeks for at least 2 months, even if the CMV DNA titer in the peripheral blood becomes negative."
https://openalex.org/W3082329154,"Along with urbanization, the intensified nitrogen pollution in urban rivers and the form of black-odor rivers has become one of the biggest concerns. Better understanding of the nitrogen transformations and microbial mechanisms occurring within urban rivers could help to manage their water quality. In this study, pollution characteristics, potential nitrogen removal rate, composition and function of bacterial community, and abundance of functional genes associated with nitrogen transformation were comparatively investigated in a typical urban river (FC) and a suburban river (LH). Compared with LH, FC was characterized by higher content of nutrients, lower potential nitrogen removal rate and lower abundance of functional genes associated with nitrogen transformation in both overlying water and sediment, especially in summer. Sediment dissolved organic matter characterized by excitation−emission matrix (EEM) showed that FC was more severely polluted by high nitrogen organic matter. Our results revealed that anammox was the main nitrogen removal pathway in both rivers and potential nitrogen removal rates decreased significantly in summer. Bacterial community analysis showed that the benthic communities were more severely influenced by the pollutant than aquatic ones in both rivers. Furthermore, the FC benthic community was dominated by anaerobic respiring, fermentative, sulfate reduction bacteria. Quantitatively, the denitrification rate showed a significant positive correlation with the abundance of denitrification genes, whilst the anammox rate was significantly negatively correlated with bacterial diversity. Meanwhile, NH4+-N had a significant negative correlation to both denitrification and anammox in sediment. Taken together, the results indicated that the increased nitrogen pollutants in an urban river altered nitrogen removal pathways and bacterial communities, which could in turn exacerbate the nitrogen pollution to this river."

Natural honey is a mixture of 25 sugars (mainly fructose and glucose) that have different biological and pharmacological benefits. The present study was designed to determine if honey can be used as a nonpermeating cryoprotectant in vitrification of bovine oocytes. In the first experiment, denuded-MII oocytes were exposed to 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 or 2.0 M of honey or sucrose. Natural honey and sucrose caused similar ooplasm dehydration. A significant relationship existed between time and ooplasm volume change (P < 0.05), during dehydration and rehydration phases, in both honey and sucrose solutions. In the second experiment, the immature cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were vitrified in an EG/DMSO-based vitrification solution containing honey (0.5, 1 or 1.5 M) or sucrose (0.5 M) as a gold standard. The vitrified-warmed COCs were matured in vitro and evaluated for nuclear maturation. The maturation (MII) rate was greater in nonvitrified control (81%) than vitrified groups (54%, P < 0.05). In the third experiment, COCs were either remained nonvitrified (control) or vitrified in 1.0 M honey or 0.5 M sucrose, followed by IVM, IVF and IVC (for 9 days). Cleavage rate was greater in control (74%) than in vitrified groups (47%, P < 0.05), without significant difference between sugars. Blastocyst rate was 34, 13 and 3% in control, honey and sucrose groups respectively (P < 0.05). In conclusion, natural honey acted as a nonpermeating cryoprotectant in vitrification solution and improved the embryonic development in vitrified bovine COCs."
https://openalex.org/W3081669300,"Misoprostol is listed in the WHO essential medicines list and can be used for induction of labour, for prevention and treatment of post-partum haemorrhage, and for abortions. The compound is unstable, and substandard misoprostol preparations have been detected in low- and middle-income countries. We now investigated the stability of misoprostol tablets according to the international guidelines for stability testing of pharmaceutical products. Three brands (four batches) of misoprostol tablets were collected in Malawi and Rwanda: the originator product, a WHO-prequalified product, and a generic product without WHO prequalification. A further batch of the originator product was collected in Germany. To investigate the effect of damage to the primary packaging, additional blister strips of one sample were intentionally damaged with a needle and investigated in parallel. Samples were placed in stability chambers for six months at 40°C/75% relative humidity (RH) and at 25°C/60% RH. After 0, 1, 2, 3 and 6 months, misoprostol content was determined according to the International Pharmacopeia. At 40°C/75% RH, all samples showed a decline of misoprostol content, but four of the batches still remained within the pharmacopeial specifications, while one of the two batches of the generic product without WHO-prequalification showed a final content of 86.2% which is out of specifications. Damage to the primary packaging greatly decreased stability, resulting in a final content of only 48.2% of the declared misoprostol amount. At 25°C/60% RH all samples remained in specifications for six months, even the sample with the damaged blister. Dissolution of misoprostol remained in specifications of the pharmacopoeia for six months for all batches, except for the sample with damaged blisters stored at 40°C/75% RH. This study confirms that the stability of misoprostol tablets must be ensured by intact, good-quality primary packaging. Careful supplier qualification is required in the procurement process."
https://openalex.org/W3082044351,"Large-scale marine protected areas (LSMPAs), MPAs greater than 100,000km2, have proliferated in the past decade. However, the value of LSMPAs as conservation tools is debated, in both global scientific and policy venues as well as in particular sites. To add nuance and more diverse voices to this debate, this research examines the perspectives of stakeholders directly engaged with LSMPAs. We conducted a Q Method study with forty LSMPA stakeholders at five sites, including three established LSMPAs (the Marianas Trench Marine National Monument, United States; the Phoenix Islands Protected Area, Kiribati; the National Marine Sanctuary, Palau) and two sites where LSMPAs had been proposed at the time of research (Bermuda and Rapa Nui (Easter Island), Chile). The analysis reveals five distinct viewpoints of LSMPAs. These include three more optimistic views of LSMPAs we have named Enthusiast, Purist, and Relativist. It also depicts two more cautious views of LSMPAs, which we have named Critic and Skeptic. The findings demonstrate the multi-dimensionality of stakeholder viewpoints on LSMPAs. These shared viewpoints have implications for the global LSMPA debate and LSMPA decision-makers, including highlighting the need to focus on LSMPA consultation processes. Better understanding of these viewpoints, including stakeholder beliefs, perspectives, values and concerns, may help to facilitate more nuanced dialogue amongst LSMPA stakeholders and, in turn, promote better governance of LSMPAs."
https://openalex.org/W3082190460,"We illustrate and study the evolution of reported infections over the month of March in New York State as a whole, as well as in each individual county in the state. We identify piecewise exponential trends, and search for correlations between the timing and dynamics of these trends and statewide mandated measures on testing and social distancing. We conclude that the reports on April 1 may be dramatically under-representing the actual number of statewide infections, an idea which is supported by more recent retroactive estimates based on serological studies. A follow-up study is underway, reassessing data until June 1, using additional measures for validation and monitoring for effects of the PAUSE directive, and of the reopening timeline."
https://openalex.org/W3082219791,"Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMM) is a chronic, progressive, inflammatory and immune-mediated disease that affects the central nervous system and is characterized by episodes of neurological dysfunction followed by a period of remission. The pharmacological strategy aims to delay the progression of the disease and prevent relapse. Interferon beta and glatiramer are commonly used in the Brazilian public health system and are available to patients who meet the guideline criteria. The scenario of multiple treatments available and in development brings the need for discussion and evaluation of the technologies already available before the incorporation of new drugs. This study analyses the effectiveness of first-line treatment of RRMS measured by real-world evidence data, from the Brazilian National Health System (SUS).We conducted a non-concurrent national cohort between 2000 and 2015. The study population consisted of 22,722 patients with RRMS using one of the following first-line drugs of interest: glatiramer or one of three presentations of interferon beta. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate the time to treatment failure. A univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard model was used to evaluate factors associated with treatment failure. In addition, patients were propensity score-matched (1:1) in six groups of comparative first-line treatments to evaluate the effectiveness among them. The analysis indicated a higher risk of treatment failure in female patients (HR = 1.08; P = 0,01), those with comorbidities at baseline (HR = 1.20; P<0,0001), in patients who developed comorbidities after starting treatment (i.e., rheumatoid arthritis-HR = 1.65; P<0,0001), those exclusive SUS patients (HR = 1.31; P<0,0001) and among patients using intramuscular interferon beta (IM βINF-1a) (28% to 60% compared to the other three treatments; P<0,0001). Lower risk of treatment failure was found among patients treated with glatiramer.This retrospective cohort suggests that glatiramer is associated with greater effectiveness compared to the three presentations of interferon beta. When evaluating beta interferons, the results suggest that the intramuscular presentation is not effective in the treatment of multiple sclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W3081792862,"Aims This study is based on two experiments, the first, with an exploratory character. The aim of which is to assess the capacity of native vs international pop songs (NAT vs INT) from two consecutive life stages, Reminiscence bump (RB) and the immediately subsequent period (No reminiscence bump, NORB) to elicit positive emotions and autobiographical memories. Method A total of 15 middle-aged adults and 15 older adults participated in Experiment 1 (E1). Emotionality, song familiarity and associated autobiographical memories were assessed. Each participant was exposed to 20 randomly selected age-specific songs. Pre-and post-test measures of mood state were also included. Experiment 2 (E2) focused on late adulthood, using a sample of 35 persons. The experimental design was similar to that used in E1. However, this second experiment also included an analysis of the types of autobiographical memories generated by the experimental task and a study of their relationship with the characteristics of the songs, their familiarity and the emotions they produced, and the number of trials. The aim was to delve into the effects that influence the effectiveness of the induction procedure, particularly as regards emotional positivity and memory specificity. Results Regarding age effect, E1 results varied: under some conditions, emotionality showed no difference between groups, others showed positive older adult bias. In E2, the analysis of the relationships between memory types and the selected variables suggests the latter are not useful predictors of differences between memory types. The study design yielded a relatively high level of memory specificity and emotional positivity. Conclusion The findings question positivity bias in the elderly. RB music produces different effects depending on age. Enculturation can be an important mediating factor in emotionality and memory. Finally, experimental design improves specific memory and positivity."
https://openalex.org/W3081950896,"Background Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) can often be diagnosed based solely on symptoms and should be treated with a short course of narrow spectrum antibiotics. However, clinicians often order urine analyses and prescribe long courses of broad spectrum antibiotics. Objective The objectives of our study are: 1) Understand how primary care providers and residents clinically approach UTIs and 2) to understand specific opportunities, based on provider type, to target future antibiotic stewardship interventions. Design and participants We conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews of community primary care providers (n = 15) and internal medicine residents (n = 15) in St. Louis, Missouri from 2018–2019. A 5-point Likert scale was used to evaluate participant preferences for possible interventions. Interviews were transcribed, de-identified, and coded by two independent researchers using a combination inductive and deductive approach. Key results Several common themes emerged. Both providers and residents ordered urine tests to “confirm” presence of urinary tract infections. Antibiotic prescription decisions were often based on historical practice and anecdotal experience rather than local susceptibility data or clinical practice guidelines. Community providers were more comfortable treating patients over the phone than residents and tended to prescribe longer courses of antibiotics. Both community providers and residents voiced frustrations with guidelines being difficult to easily incorporate due to length and extraneous information. Preferences for receiving and incorporating guidelines into practice varied. Both groups felt benchmarking would improve prescribing practices but had reservations about implementation. Community providers preferred pragmatic clinical decision support systems and nurse triage algorithms. Residents preferred order sets. Conclusions Significant opportunities exist to optimize urinary tract infection management among residents and community providers. Multifaceted interventions that include provider education, synthesis of guidelines, and pragmatic clinical decision support systems are needed to improve antibiotic prescribing and diagnostic testing; optimal interventions to improve UTI management may vary based on provider training level."
https://openalex.org/W3081637506,"In eyewitness research the frequent use of video playback presented on a computer screen (i.e., 2D videos) in laboratory-based research is problematic due to the low realism of this method when presenting, for example, threatening (and non-threatening) first-person (and third-person) scenarios. However, in contrast to 2D videos, 360-degree videos presented in virtual reality (VR) presents the opportunity of achieving more realistic and immersive scenarios that might be better suited to mimic real-life incidents, as for example, in the case of a threatening first-person robbery. In the present study, we asked 37 participants to watch eight pre-recorded threatening or non-threatening 2D and VR videos, viewed from either a first- or third-person perspective. After each video, participants assessed the observed target's appearance and were then presented with either a target present (TP) or target absent (TA) six-person photograph line-up. We expected that VR would result in higher degrees of accuracy in both TP and TA line-ups compared with 2D and that the differences between manipulations would be more pronounced within VR compared with 2D. We found that TP (but not TA) accuracy was higher in 2D compared with VR videos (91 vs. 66%), that there was no main effect of perspective, and that threatening scenes increased TP (but not TA) accuracy compared to non-threatening scenes (86 vs. 70%). Furthermore, in VR (but not in 2D), threatening scenes increased TP (but not TA) accuracy compared with non-threatening scenes (85 vs. 40%). The results go against the expected increased accuracy in VR (vs. 2D) videos but support the notion that threatening (vs. non-threatening) scenes can increase identification accuracy in VR but not necessarily in 2D."
