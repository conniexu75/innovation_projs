https://openalex.org/W2161807488,Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) is a dominantly inherited disorder characterized by the occurrence of bilateral vestibular schwannomas and other central nervous system tumors including multiple meningiomas. Genetic linkage studies and investigations of both sporadic and familial tumors suggest that NF2 is caused by inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene in chromosome 22q12. We have identified a candidate gene for the NF2 tumor suppressor that has suffered nonoverlapping deletions in DNA from two independent NF2 families and alterations in meningiomas from two unrelated NF2 patients. The candidate gene encodes a 587 amino acid protein with striking similarity to several members of a family of proteins proposed to link cytoskeletal components with proteins in the cell membrane. The NF2 gene may therefore constitute a novel class of tumor suppressor gene.
https://openalex.org/W2024056631,"This paper reports the identification and functional expression of a gene that is involved in nitrate uptake in plants, a process essential for the assimilation of nitrate and the biological removal of nitrate from the soil solution. The CHL1 gene of Arabidopsis, which when mutated confers resistance to the herbicide chlorate and a decrease in nitrate uptake, was isolated and found to encode a protein with 12 putative membrane-spanning segments. Injection of CHL1 mRNA into Xenopus oocytes produces a nitrate- and pH-dependent membrane depolarization, inward current, and nitrate uptake. These data show that the CHL1 gene encodes an electrogenic nitrate transporter. CHL1 mRNA is found predominantly in roots and displays nitrate- and pH-dependent regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1990654868,"Motor neurons stimulate their postsynaptic muscle targets to synthesize neurotransmitter receptors. Polypeptide signaling molecules may mediate this inductive interaction. Here we report the purification of ARIA, a protein that stimulates the synthesis of muscle acetylcholine receptors, and the isolation of ARIA cDNA. Recombinant ARIA increases acetylcholine receptor synthesis greater than 3-fold, and it induces tyrosine phosphorylation of a 185 kd muscle protein. The ARIA cDNA hybridizes with mRNAs that are expressed in the spinal cord from E4, a time prior to the onset of neuromuscular synapse formation, through adulthood. By E7, hybridizing mRNAs are concentrated in motor neurons. Chicken ARIA is homologous to the rat Neu differentiation factor and human here-gulin, ligands for the receptor tyrosine kinase encoded by the neu (c-erbB2, HER2) proto-oncogene. Our data suggest that members of the ARIA protein family promote the formation and maintenance of chemical synapses and, furthermore, that receptor tyrosine kinases play important roles in this process."
https://openalex.org/W1554882994,"We have determined the patterns of mRNA and protein expression of 7 protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes in NIH 3T3 cells. Only PKC-alpha is expressed abundantly in NIH 3T3 cells; endogenous levels of the other 6 PKC isozymes are low or undetectable. We have overexpressed PKC-delta and -epsilon in these cells to observe activation/translocation of these two isozymes and the biological consequences of overexpression. Both PKC-delta and -epsilon, but not PKC-alpha, are partially associated with the insoluble fraction even in the absence of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Upon PMA stimulation, both PKC-delta and -epsilon translocate to the insoluble fraction of cell homogenates, as can be observed with the endogenous PKC-alpha. Overexpression of PKC-delta induces significant changes in morphology and causes the cells to grow more slowly and to a decreased cell density in confluent cultures. These changes are accentuated by treatment with PMA. Overexpression of PKC-epsilon does not lead to morphological changes, but causes increased growth rates and higher cell densities in monolayers. None of the PKC-delta overexpressers grow in soft agar with or without PMA, but all the cell lines that overexpress PKC-epsilon grow in soft agar in the absence of PMA, but not in its presence. NIH 3T3 cells that overexpress PKC-epsilon also form tumors in nude mice with 100% incidence. This indicates that high expression of PKC-epsilon contributes to neoplastic transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2160644552,"Bcl-3 is an IκB-related protein with ankyrin repeat motifs. Its gene is located at a site of recurrent translocations in a subset of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias. Bcl-3 associates tightly with p50B (NFKB2, p52) homodimers in cells, and together these proteins form a ternary complex with DNA at κB sites. Such an association functionally leads to a novel and potent form of transactivation through the κB motif: the tethering of Bcl-3 to DNA via the p50B homodimers allows Bcl-3 to transactivate directly, while p50B homodimers alone cannot. Transactivation mediated by Bcl-3 requires two cooperating domains located amino- and carboxyterminal to the ankyrin domain. Bcl-3 is localized to the nucleus, and a Bcl-3-p50B complex is detected in certain lymphoid cells. Our data reveal a novel role for Bcl-3, distinct from that of the inhibitor IκB. The results have implications for tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2084999188,"Oocyte maturation in Drosophila is supported by a cluster of 15 germline-derived nurse cells whose cytoplasm is transported into the oocyte through intercellular bridges called ring canals. kelch was isolated as a female sterile mutation affecting cytoplasm transport. We have cloned the kelch gene and found that it encodes an unusual transcript containing two open reading frames (ORF1 and ORF2) separated by a single UGA stop codon. At least two protein products are made from the kelch mRNA: a short protein from ORF1 and a longer protein from both ORF1 and ORF2 as a result of partial suppression of the UGA codon. The kelch ORF1 product is conserved, and antibodies directed against it are localized specifically to ring canals. Our results suggest that kelch produces a component of ring canals that regulates the flow of cytoplasm between cells."
https://openalex.org/W1990364715,"The binding and hydrolysis of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) by the small GTP-binding protein Sar1p is required to form transport vesicles from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Experiments revealed that an interaction between Sar1p and the Sec23p subunit of an oligomeric protein is also required for vesicle budding. The isolated Sec23p subunit and the oligomeric complex stimulated guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activity of Sar1p 10- to 15-fold but did not activate two other small GTP-binding proteins involved in vesicle traffic (Ypt1p and ARF). Activation of GTPase was inhibited by an antibody to Sec23p but not by an antibody that inhibits the budding activity of the other subunit of the Sec23p complex. Also, activation was thermolabile in pure samples of Sec23p that were isolated from two independent sec23 mutant strains. It appears that Sec23p represents a new class of GTPase-activating protein because its sequence shows no similarity to any known member of this family."
https://openalex.org/W2052823089,"Discrimination among the vast array of odors requires that the brain discern which of the numerous odorant receptors have been activated. If individual olfactory neurons express only a subset of the odorant receptor repertoire, then the nature of a given odorant can be discerned by identifying which cells have been activated. We performed in situ hybridization experiments demonstrating that individual olfactory neurons express different complements of odorant receptors and are therefore functionally distinct. Thus, a topographic map, defining either the positions of specific neurons in the epithelium or the positions of their projections, may be employed to determine the quality of an olfactory stimulus. Neurons expressing specific receptors appear to be randomly distributed within the olfactory epithelium. These data are consistent with a model in which randomly dispersed olfactory neurons with common receptor specificities project to common glomeruli in the olfactory bulb."
https://openalex.org/W1986683530,"The dorsal (dl) morphogen gradient initiates the formation of the mesoderm, neuroectoderm, and dorsal ectoderm by setting different limits of regulatory gene expression along the dorsoventral axis of the early Drosophila embryo. In this paper, we show that low affinity dl-binding sites restrict target gene expression to the ventralmost regions (presumptive mesoderm), where there are peak levels of dl, while high affinity sites permit expression in ventrolateral regions (mesoderm and mesectoderm) containing intermediate levels of the morphogen. Activation by low levels of dl in lateral regions (the presumptive neuroectoderm) depends on cooperative DNA binding interactions between dl and bHLH proteins. The snail repressor blocks this interaction and restricts expression to the neuroectoderm. We discuss how enhancers serve as templates to bring weakly interacting regulatory factors into close proximity so that they can function combinatorially to activate and repress transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1972263794,"The compartment of mouse B cell progenitors can be resolved into five developmentally related fractions by multicolor flow cytometry. Using this system and employing mutant mice in which the membrane exon of the mu chain, the lambda 5 gene, or the JH locus was inactivated by gene targeting, we found that expression of the pre-B cell receptor complex is necessary for the transition from the large CD43+ to the small CD43- pre-B cell stage. We report the occurrence of immunoglobulin heavy and light chain gene rearrangement at the stage of large B cell precursors. We show that neither the pre-B cell receptor complex nor any gene rearrangement in the heavy chain locus is required for the induction of kappa light chain gene rearrangement in early B cell progenitors."
https://openalex.org/W1998791246,"A molecular docking computer program (DOCK) was used to screen the Fine Chemical Directory, a database of commercially available compounds, for molecules that are complementary to thymidylate synthase (TS), a chemotherapeutic target. Besides retrieving the substrate and several known inhibitors, DOCK proposed putative inhibitors previously unknown to bind to the enzyme. Three of these compounds inhibited Lactobacillus casei TS at submillimolar concentrations. One of these inhibitors, sulisobenzone, crystallized with TS in two configurations that differed from the DOCK-favored geometry: a counterion was bound in the substrate site, which resulted in a 6 to 9 angstrom displacement of the inhibitor. The structure of the complexes suggested another binding region in the active site that could be exploited. This region was probed with molecules sterically similar to sulisobenzone, which led to the identification of a family of phenolphthalein analogs that inhibit TS in the 1 to 30 micromolar range. These inhibitors do not resemble the substrates of the enzyme. A crystal structure of phenolphthalein with TS shows that it binds in the target site in a configuration that resembles the one suggested by DOCK."

https://openalex.org/W2050756936,"Imaging the interior of living bodies with light may assist in the diagnosis and treatment of a number of clinical problems, which include the early detection of tumors and hypoxic cerebral injury. An existing picosecond time-of-flight and absorbance (TOFA) optical system has been used to image a model biologic system and a rat. Model measurements confirmed TOFA principles in systems with a high degree of photon scattering; rat images, which were constructed from the variable time delays experienced by a fixed fraction of early-arriving transmitted photons, revealed identifiable internal structure. A combination of light-based quantitative measurement and TOFA localization may have applications in continuous, noninvasive monitoring for structural imaging and spatial chemometric analysis in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2043850455,"The complexity and chronicity of parasitic infections have obscured the identification of biologically relevant antigens. Analysis of the T cell receptor repertoire used by mice infected with Leishmania major revealed the expansion of a restricted population of CD4+ cells. These cells expressed the V alpha 8-J alpha TA72, V beta 4 heterodimer in both progressive infection and protective immunity and across several major histocompatibility haplotypes. Thus, the same immunodominant parasite epitope drives the disparate outcomes of this infectious process, suggesting that candidate vaccine antigens selected by screening of immune individuals may be capable of exacerbating disease in genetically susceptible individuals."
https://openalex.org/W1536305347,"Hemoglobin synthesis in red cells is the major iron utilization pathway in the human body and accounts for > 80% of systemic iron turnover. The first step in erythroid heme biosynthesis is catalyzed by a tissue-specific isoform of 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS). The previous identification of iron-responsive elements in the 5'-untranslated region of human and murine erythroid ALAS mRNA raised the intriguing possibility that eALAS expression might be under iron-dependent translational control. As a consequence, a single post-transcriptional regulatory system could coordinate cellular iron acquisition via the transferrin receptor, storage via ferritin, and utilization via eALAS. We directly demonstrate iron-dependent translational regulation of eALAS mRNA in murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. The iron-responsive element motif contained in eALAS mRNA is shown to be sufficient to confer translational control to a reporter mRNA both in transfected MEL cells and in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1498536727,"Of the multiple soluble lactose-binding (S-Lac) lectins in rat intestine, the major one, tentatively designated RI-H, was previously isolated as a polypeptide of molecular weight approximately 17,000. We here report the sequence of RI-H, as determined both at the peptide level and at the nucleotide level. Surprisingly the cDNA encodes a protein of molecular weight approximately 36,000, and this protein contains two homologous but distinct domains each with sequence elements that are conserved among all S-Lac lectins. The C-terminal domain, designated domain II, corresponds to the lectin with M(r) of 17,000 previously isolated from intestinal extracts and shown to have lactose binding activity. By preparing recombinant protein containing only the N-terminal domain, designated domain I, we here directly demonstrate that it too binds lactose and a related range of sugars that are roughly similar to domain II, but clearly distinct. The new lectin, which we designate L-36, is highly expressed in full-length form in rat small and large intestine and stomach but was not detected in eight other tissues including lung, liver, kidney, and spleen. Each domain has approximately 35% sequence identity with the other domain and with the carbohydrate-binding domain of L-29, another S-Lac lectin, but only about 15% identity with other known S-Lac lectins."
https://openalex.org/W1512287707,"Astrocytes in the central nervous system are involved in a variety of functions including storage of glycogen, maintenance of the extracellular ionic equilibrium, and support for the migration and the differentiation of neurons. Astrocytes express membrane receptors allowing them to respond to extracellular signals. Activation of receptors induces a cascade of events, such as stimulation of protein kinases and subsequent phosphorylation of target proteins. To understand the regulatory processes underlying neuroglial interactions, attempts were made to identify major phosphorylated proteins in striatal astrocytes, grown in primary culture and labeled with [32P]phosphate. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed a major doublet, Pa and Pb, of highly labeled spots, with a low molecular weight (M(r) = 15,000) and acidic pI (pI = 5.2 and 5.3, respectively). Using an enriched, heat-stable, cytosolic fraction, Pa and Pb were eluted from semi-preparative two-dimensional gels and subjected to a limited proteolysis and partial microsequencing. The same sequences were obtained within Pa and Pb and had no homology with other known protein. Antibodies raised against corresponding synthetic peptides confirm that the doublet represents two isoelectric variants of the same protein, which also exists under a nonphosphorylated form, N. We propose to name this protein PEA-15, for Phosphoprotein Enriched in Astrocytes-15 kDa, according to its large enrichment in these cells. Treatment of intact astrocytes with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), which stimulates protein kinase C (PKC), increased the phosphorylation of the more acidic spot (Pb) while decreasing Pa intensity. Stimulations of astrocytes known to increase PKC activity, i.e. noradrenaline, or its inhibition by decreasing extracellular calcium concentrations, staurosporine, or desensitization following long term treatment with TPA, induced a phosphorylation or a dephosphorylation of PEA-15, respectively. Using purified PKC, PEA-15 appeared to be a good substrate in vitro. Two-dimensional peptide mapping revealed that the phosphorylation site in intact cells was identical with the site phosphorylated by PKC in vitro. Mapping the phosphopeptides by HPLC following endolysine C treatment lead to the identification of a sequence, phosphorylated in intact astrocytes and in vitro by PKC, containing a consensus site for PKC: LTRIPSAKK. Antibodies raised against a synthetic peptide derived from this sequence recognized N and Pa in control conditions and Pb after its dephosphorylation. Thus, PEA-15 is an endogenous substrate for PKC, the kinase mediating the transition from Pa to Pb."
https://openalex.org/W1517316106,"Using fast protein liquid chromatography, we have separated native Old Yellow Enzyme from Brewer's Bottom Yeast into three distinct fractions. Two of these fractions are homodimeric forms of the enzyme while the third is the corresponding heterodimeric form. One of these homodimeric fractions is identical in every respect to OYE1, originally cloned from Brewer's Bottom Yeast (Saito, K., Thiele, D. J., Davio, M., Lockridge, O., and Massey, V. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 20720-20724). We have cloned, sequenced, and expressed a second Old Yellow Enzyme gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, showing close similarity, but not identity, with OYE1. Native Old Yellow Enzyme samples were also affinity-purified from a strain of S. cerevisiae and an OYE deletion mutant constructed from it. A total of at least seven isozymes of Old Yellow Enzyme have been discovered, each having slightly different characteristics ranging from surface charge to NADPH dehydrogenase activities with different electron acceptors, as well as N-terminal amino acid sequence. In addition, both recombinant enzymes showed considerable similarity to two proteins in the GenBank/EMBL data bank, a 60,000-dalton bile acid-inducible polypeptide in Eubacterium sp. (Mallonee, D. H., White, W. B., and Hylemon, P. B. (1990) J. Lipid Res. 172, 7011-7019) and a 72,000-dalton NADH oxidase in Thermoanaerobium brockii."
https://openalex.org/W1563776614,"The major surface antigen of Pneumocystis carinii, a life-threatening opportunistic pathogen in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients, is an abundant glycoprotein that functions in host-organism interactions. A monoclonal antibody to this antigen is protective in animals, and thus this antigen is a good candidate for development as a vaccine to prevent or control P. carinii infection. We have cloned and sequenced seven related but unique genes encoding the major surface glycoprotein of rat P. carinii. Partial amino acid sequencing confirmed the identity of these genes. Based on Southern blot studies using chromosomal or restricted DNA, the major surface glycoproteins are the products of a multicopy family of genes. The predicted protein has an M(r) of approximately 123,000, is relatively rich in cysteine residues (5.5%) that are very strongly conserved, and contains a well conserved hydrophobic region at the carboxyl terminus. The presence of multiple related msg genes encoding the major surface glycoprotein of P. carinii suggests that antigenic variation is a possible mechanism for evading host defenses. Further characterization of this family of genes should allow the development of novel approaches to the control of this pathogen."

Previously, the algorithm had been applied only to known structures. This algorithm has now been applied to two previously unknown structures that contain 105 and 110 non-hydrogen atoms, respectively. This report focuses on (i) algorithmic and parametric optimizations of Shake-and-Bake and (ii) the determination of two previously unknown structures. Traditional tangent formula phasing techniques were unable to unravel these two new structures."
https://openalex.org/W2138068883,"T. brucei brucei released a lymphocyte triggering factor (TLTF), which triggered purified CD8+, but not CD4+, T cells to interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) mRNA expression and secretion and to [3H]thymidine incorporation. TLTF also induced mRNA for transforming growth factor beta, but not for interleukin-4. The action of this TLTF on mononuclear cell (MNC) cultures was blocked by anti-CD8 antibodies and by soluble CD8. MNCs from a mutant mouse strain lacking CD8 expression were not triggered by TLTF. IFN-gamma provides a growth stimulus for T. brucei brucei, and infected CD8- mice had much lower parasitemia and survived longer than CD8+ mice. The host-parasite interaction in experimental African trypanosomiasis thus involves parasite release of TLTF, which by binding to CD8 triggers CD8+ cells to produce the parasite growth-promoting cytokine IFN-gamma."
https://openalex.org/W1500012431,"The ExbB protein together with the ExbD and TonB proteins is involved in energy-coupled transport across the outer membrane of Escherichia coli. To understand this unusual process it is required to determine the subcellular location of ExbB and its transmembrane arrangement. Using ExbB-beta-lactamase fusion proteins as reporters for a periplasmic versus a cytoplasmic location of the fusion sites, and accessibility of ExbB in spheroplasts and cell lysates to aminopeptidase K, trypsin, and proteinase K, we arrived at a model of ExbB topology in the cytoplasmic membrane. Starting with the N terminus in the periplasm ExbB contains three transmembrane segments (residues 16-39, 128-155, 162-194) a small periplasmic loop and two large portions in the cytoplasm. Two of the 18 fusion proteins studied, ExbB34-beta-lactamase and ExbB41-beta-lactamase, conferred a high ampicillin resistance. Protease experiments revealed a high respectively low percentage of the molecules in a reverse transmembrane orientation. Both proteins were lacking positive charges at the inner side of the cytoplasmic membrane which determine the orientation of transmembrane segments."
https://openalex.org/W1480349284,"The mouse D3 dopamine receptor has been cloned from olfactory tubercle cDNA using polymerase chain reaction and has been found to exist in two alternatively spliced forms. These two mRNA isoforms differ by the presence or absence of 63 base pairs (bp), which encode 21 amino acids in the putative third cytoplasmic loop of the receptor. The longer form corresponds to the previously reported rat D3 dopamine receptor, to which it bears sequence homology of 94%. Northern blot analysis shows the mouse D3 receptor to be most abundant in the olfactory tubercle. Expression studies show the novel short D3 isoform to bind dopaminergic ligands with a D3-like pharmacological profile. Polymerase chain reaction analysis on different mouse brain regions shows the long and short D3 receptors to be present in the same tissues, the longer form invariably being the predominant one. Analysis of the gene for the mouse D3 dopamine receptor shows that no separate exon encodes the 63-bp stretch and reveals the presence of a consensus sequence for an acceptor site at the 3' end of the 63-bp stretch. This suggests that an internal acceptor site in the exon coding for the distal part of the third cytoplasmic loop directs alternative splicing of the D3 dopamine receptor."

https://openalex.org/W2115802085,"The major cysteine protease of Trypanosoma cruzi, cruzain, has been previously expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion polypeptide. The proteolytic processing events required to obtain active, mature cruzain from the recombinant expression system have been characterized using mutational analysis of the cloned gene. An inactive variant of cruzain (cruzain-C25A) revealed that the proteolytic cleavage of the COOH-terminal domain from the recombinant cruzain is independent of cruzain activity. This cleavage event, presumably performed by another protease, was reduced, although not completely eliminated, in a variant in which the cleavage recognition site was altered (cruzain-E219P). To obtain a homogeneous COOH terminus of the recombinant enzyme, a truncated form of cruzain (cruzain-delta c) was engineered by insertion of a stop codon in the gene at a site corresponding to autoproteolysis observed with the native enzyme, purified from epimastigotes. Diffraction quality crystals of recombinant cruzain (cruzain) and the truncated variant (cruzain-delta c) have been produced and characterized. Cruzain and cruzain-delta c were cocrystallized with the peptide fluoromethyl ketone (FMK) inhibitors, Z-Phe-Arg-FMK and Z-Phe-Ala-FMK, respectively, (where Z is benzyloxycarbonyl). The crystals are monoclinic, space group P2(1), with a = 45.5 A, b = 51.0 A, c = 45.7 A, and beta = 116.1 degrees. One cruzain molecule is present in the asymmetric unit. The crystallographic data reveal that the high resolution structure determination is feasible. This system will facilitate the three-dimensional structure determinations and biochemical analyses of cruzain and cruzain variants."

These cells had increased uptake into the tumor and suppression of tumor growth as compared with LAK cells alone, thereby improving the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Thus, tumor growth can be inhibited by targeted LAK cells, and SCID mice can be used to test the antitumor properties of human effector cells."
https://openalex.org/W1505584646,"We have previously described the isolation and initial characterization of functionally distinct 15-kDa protein isoforms (p15s) from rabbit polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) that bind with high affinity to Escherichia coli and modulate the antibacterial actions of other leukocyte proteins on this Gram-negative bacterium. We now report the cloning and sequencing of two distinct cDNAs from a rabbit bone marrow library that encode p15s differing at only 2 residues (His-3, Arg-88 versus Arg-3, Trp-88). Tryptophan-directed chemical cleavage of two isoforms purified from a single rabbit confirms the existence of multiple isoforms with distinct function and primary structure in a single rabbit. The p15 cDNAs encode putative signal sequences and studies of cellular and subcellular localization indicate that the p15s are granule-associated proteins of PMN. Both purified isoforms bind avidly to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the major component of the Gram-negative bacterial outer membrane. Analysis of the deduced primary structures of the p15s reveals homology to three other leukocyte proteins: CAP-18, an 18-kDa LPS-binding protein from rabbit PMN, pro-indolicidin, a 16-kDa precursor of an antibacterial peptide of bovine PMN, and cathelin, an 11-kDa cysteine protease inhibitor from porcine leukocytes, suggesting the existence of a novel family of leukocyte proteins with LPS-binding, antimicrobial, and protease-inhibitory activities."
https://openalex.org/W1533647724,"T7 phage RNA polymerase was used to transcribe a series of DNA templates bearing any of several precisely localized lesions. Lesions were positioned downstream of the T7 promoter on either strand of the DNA template to investigate the effects of these lesions on elongation of transcription. The following four types of DNA modifications were studied: 1) 3-hydroxy-2-hydroxymethyltetrahydrofuran (tetrahydrofuran), a synthetic apurinic/apyrimidinic site; 2) 8-oxoguanine (8-oxodG), an oxidized derivative of guanine; 3) N-acetyl-2-aminofluorene (AAF) modified guanine; 4) 2-aminofluorene (AF) modified guanine. None of these lesions blocked transcription elongation when they were located on the non-template strand. Lesions on the template strand blocked elongation with varied efficiency. The series of AAF-dG, AF-dG, and tetrahydrofuran lesions showed a progressively decreasing ability to block elongation, while 8-oxo-dG caused little, if any, premature termination. T7 RNA polymerase was able to read through all of the lesions with sufficient efficiency to permit chain termination sequencing using the read-through products as templates. AAF-dG and AF-dG adducts did not induce detectable misreading. Adenine and, more rarely, cytosine were incorporated opposite 8-oxo-dG, as observed for translesional synthesis by DNA polymerases. Adenine was most commonly inserted opposite the non-instructional abasic site analogue, although a minor fraction of guanine was incorporated."
https://openalex.org/W1633318893,"Abstract Nucleosomes have been reconstituted onto dodecameric repeats of a 208-base pair nucleosome positioning sequence at various subsaturating molar ratios of histone octamer to DNA repeat (r). These reconstitutes have been characterized with respect to lattice site occupancy distributions, nucleosome positioning, chromatin folding, and histone octamer dissociation. Reconstitution at 0.3 < or = r < or = 0.9 produces subsaturated chromatin templates with distinct compositional limits, n +/- 2 nucleosomes, where n is the average number of nucleosomes present on the template at that r value. Nucleosomes on subsaturated arrays occupy the same set of specific positions within the repeat unit as they do on saturated templates, with only very slight differences in the relative frequency of occupation of the various positions. The nucleosomes on very subsaturated templates, i.e. r < or = 0.5, are generally spread out. However, some nucleosome clustering is observed on these very subsaturated templates. These results indicate that assembly of nucleosomes onto this DNA lattice is not a strongly cooperative process. In 200 mM NaCl, subsaturated reconstitutes exhibit reduced levels of folding and histone octamer dissociation compared with saturated arrays. These results provide a framework for understanding the structural features of regions of chromatin partially depleted of nucleosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1597139514,"F-actin and tropomyosin inhibited the phosphorylation of calponin by protein kinase C, and the phosphorylation reduced the binding of calponin to F-actin and tropomyosin. Labeled phosphate from [gamma-32P]ATP was retained both on the chymotryptic NH2-terminal 22-kDa fragment, which contains the actin-, tropomyosin-, and calmodulin-binding regions, and on the COOH-terminal 12-kDa fragment. Fractionation of tryptic 32P-labeled peptides by high performance liquid chromatography allowed isolation of three phosphopeptides (designated T1, T2, and T3), each of which was located in three repeating amino acid motifs of calponin. Both the relative initial rates and extent of phosphorylation decreased in the order T2 > T3 > T1. Both serine and threonine residues were phosphorylated in T1 (GASQAGMTAPGTK), and only a threonine residue was phosphorylated in T2 (FASQQGMTAYGTR) and in T3 (GASQQGMTVYGLPR). As the 22-kDa fragment contained only T2, the phosphorylation site in T2 appeared to regulate the binding of calponin to F-actin and tropomyosin. The amino acid sequence of T2 indicates that protein kinase C phosphorylates Thr184. Thus Thr184 is the preferred site of phosphorylation and is functionally the most important of the sites phosphorylated by protein kinase C in smooth muscle calponin."
https://openalex.org/W1572052287,"Oligomycin,N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD), venturicidin, and tetracoordinate organotin compounds (R3SnX) are potent inhibitors of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex, all acting on the membrane sector, F0. Oligomycin and DCCD inhibit proton translocation through F0 and energy transfer between F0 and the catalytic sector, F1, of the ATP synthase complex. Our results have shown that venturicidin and organotin compounds (tributyltin and triphenyltin chloride were used) greatly attenuate these processes, but do not cause complete inhibition. As a result, bovine submitochondrial particles (SMP) treated with venturicidin or tributyltin chloride were shown to be capable of ATP hydrolysis and synthesis, albeit at very slow rates. We had shown previously that in ATP synthesis Vmax and apparent Km for ADP and Pi increase or decrease, respectively, as the steady-state membrane potential is elevated or lowered (Matsuno-Yagi, A., and Hatefi, Y. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 14031-14038). These changes occurred at constant Vmax/Km, suggesting that the apparent Km changes were due mainly to kcat changes. Results presented here show that, in respiring SMP treated with venturicidin or organotin compounds, the membrane potential is near the static-head level, but the slow rate of ATP synthesis takes place with a low KmADP value of 2-3 microM. In agreement with our previous conclusions, these results indicate that it is not the membrane potential per se that affects KmADP during ATP synthesis, but rather it is the rate of energy transfer from F0 to F1 that influences both Vmax and KmADP. Further conclusions from the above studies have been discussed in relation to the possible mechanism of energy transfer between F0 and F1 and the manner in which venturicidin and organotin compounds might attenuate this process."
https://openalex.org/W1512571415,"The rat hepatocyte cell adhesion molecule cell-CAM105 has recently been shown to be composed of at least two isoforms. Expression of the two isoforms in different tissues and during fetal liver development in rats was studied by RNase protection using a probe which could specifically and simultaneously detect both isoforms. This probe revealed protected fragments of expected lengths for the L-form and the S-form in RNA samples isolated from various adult rat tissues. High levels of the L-form and S-form messages were detected in liver and intestine, moderate levels were detected in lung, and weak signals were detected in muscle, kidney, and spleen. In liver development studies, the messages for cell-CAM105 showed a major increase on the first day after birth compared to the fetal stage, and both isoform messages were proportionally increased. These results indicate that both cell-CAM105 isoforms may have function(s) related to hepatocyte differentiation. To study the adhesion function of cell-CAM105 isoforms, full-length cDNAs for these isoforms were expressed in insect cells. The insect cells expressing the L-form cell-CAM105 were found to aggregate. However, expression of S-form cell-CAM105 did not support cell aggregation. These results indicate that L-form, but not S-form, cell-CAM105 directly mediates the cell adhesion function."
https://openalex.org/W1545144282,"Activation of the alternative pathway of complement by immune complexes involves the covalent attachment of the third component (C3) to the IgG heavy chain. In order to localize the site/sites of attachment, adducts of human C3.IgG were digested in situ with endoproteinase Lys-C and Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease, and the fragments were analyzed. The dimeric peptide containing the covalent bond, identified by alkylation of the free thiol group (Cys1010) with iodo[14C]acetamide, was isolated by high-performance liquid chromatography fractionation. A double sequence with NH2 termini corresponding to position 134 of IgG heavy chain and position 1002 of the C3 alpha' chain was found by analysis with automated Edman degradation. The intact dimeric peptide had a mass of 3453 Da and was composed of IgG and C3 fragments with predicted sizes of 23 and 12 residues, respectively. The IgG peptide includes a cluster of six potential acceptor sites for ester bond formation. Thus, it appears that C3 binding is limited to a single region within the CH1 domain of the IgG1 heavy chain."
https://openalex.org/W1565244762,"TSG6 was originally identified as a tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-inducible gene in human fibroblasts. Earlier we showed that the secretory TSG6 protein is a member of a family of hyaluronan-binding proteins that includes cartilage link protein, proteoglycan core protein, and the adhesion receptor CD44. In the present study we have used Southern blot analysis to demonstrate that TSG6 is a single-copy gene in the human and murine species. With the aid of a somatic cell hybrid mapping panel, TSG6 was assigned to human chromosome 2. Nuclear run-on analysis revealed that TNF produced a rapid, primary transcriptional activation of the TSG6 gene in normal human FS-4 fibroblasts. In order to learn more about the regulation of TSG6 gene expression, we cloned the TSG6 gene from a genomic library of human white blood cells. Sequencing of a 1.3-kilobase fragment of the 5'-flanking region of the TSG6 gene identified TATA-like and CAAT sequences near the transcription start site. In addition, potential binding sites for NF-IL-6, AP-1, interferon regulatory factors (IRF)-1 and -2, and glucocorticoid response elements were identified in the 5'-flanking region. A single transcription start site was identified by primer extension. Deletion analysis of the 5'-flanking region of the TSG6 DNA linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene revealed that a construct containing TSG6 DNA from positions -165 to +78 could be transcriptionally activated by interleukin(IL)-1, and to a lesser extent by TNF, upon transfection into FS-4 fibroblasts. The region that imparts inducibility by IL-1 or TNF (positions -165 to -58) contains potential binding sites for IRF-1 and -2, AP-1, and NF-IL-6. A region mediating transcriptional silencing was localized further upstream (between positions -332 and -165). The results suggest that TSG6 gene expression is regulated by an interplay of positively and negatively acting transactivating factors."
https://openalex.org/W2144025681,"Protein isoaspartyl methyltransferase is implicated in the repair of age-damaged proteins containing atypical, isoaspartyl linkages. To test the prediction that isoaspartyl proteins would accumulate during methyltransferase inhibition, rat PC12 cells were treated with the indirect methylation inhibitor, adenosine dialdehyde. We observed a marked, dose- and time-dependent, reversible accumulation of substrates for the enzyme that closely paralleled the elevation of its competitive inhibitor, S-adenosylhomocysteine. The accumulation of substrates also paralleled a cytostatic action of adenosine dialdehyde; however, 30 microM 3-deazaadenosine, another indirect methylation inhibitor, also caused an accumulation of substrates without affecting cell division, and other cytostatic agents did not affect substrate levels. Acidic gel electrophoresis revealed increased methyl-accepting capacity in a broad spectrum of proteins, with predominant increases in discrete bands of M(r) 46,000 and 110,000. A major substrate (M(r) 17,400) in untreated cells did not increase in methyl-accepting capacity during treatment. Methyl groups at the accumulated sites did not survive conventional electrophoresis, indicating the lability characteristic of isoaspartyl methyl esters in damaged proteins. These results are consistent with an involvement of the methyltransferase in the metabolism of damaged proteins, and they provide a basis for the characterization of physiological substrates for the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1554226644,"Replication protein A (RPA) is a three-subunit protein that plays a central role in eukaryotic DNA replication, recombination, and repair. We have previously reported the cloning and bacterial expression of the 70- and 32-kDa subunits of human RPA (hRPA). We have now cloned the 14-kDa subunit (hRPA3) from a HeLa cell cDNA library. The hRPA3 cDNA is a 692-base pair sequence that contains an open reading frame encoding a protein of 121 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 13.6 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence shows only limited similarity to the small subunit of yeast RPA and is unrelated to any other protein in the current data banks. A recombinant protein containing a short histidine tag at the NH2 terminus has been purified in good yield from Escherichia coli by metal-chelate affinity chromatography. Antibodies prepared against recombinant hRPA3 recognize the native protein and inhibit SV40 DNA replication in vitro. We have localized the genes for the 70-, 32-, and 14-kDa subunits to chromosomes 17, 1, and 7, respectively, using polymerase chain reaction amplification of genomic DNA from rodent-human hybrid cell lines. Since RPA appears to be involved in several fundamental cellular processes, the physical mapping of the RPA genes may be useful in identifying possible human genetic defects associated with RPA deficiency or dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W1503898156,"Calpain inhibitor I, N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (ALLN), a cell-permeable synthetic tripeptide with an aldehyde at its C terminus specifically inhibits the activity of cysteine proteases. Since the regulated degradation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells is blocked by ALLN and ALLN has a cytotoxic effect on cells, we attempted to isolate ALLN-resistant cells that overproduce an ALLN-sensitive protease(s). However, we obtained an ALLN-resistant cell line that overproduced P-glycoprotein (Sharma, R. C., Inoue, S., Roitelman, J., Schimke, R. T., and Simoni, R. D. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 5731-5734). To circumvent the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype during selection, we have stepwise selected an ALLN-resistant cell line of CHO cells in the presence of verapamil, a competitive inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. These non-MDR ALLN-resistant cells overexpress a 35-kDa protein and have increased aldo-keto reductase activity. Partial amino acid sequences of the 35-kDa protein are highly homologous to members of the aldo-keto reductase superfamily. The aldo-keto reductases are NADPH-dependent oxidoreductases and catalyze reduction of a wide range of carbonyl compounds such as aldehydes, sugars, and ketones. Our findings support the concept that a physiological function for aldo-keto reductases may be detoxification."
https://openalex.org/W1515450171,"Somatostatin (SRIF) receptors of GH4C1 cells occupied with biotinyl-NH-[Leu8,D-Trp22,Tyr25] somatostatin28 (bio-S28) have been affinity purified over streptavidin affinity columns (Eppler, C. M., Zysk, J. R., Corbett, M., and Shieh, H.-M. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 15603-15612). This procedure results in the copurification of a single subtype of SRIF receptor (SSTR2) and associated guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) that are coupled to these receptors. For accurate quantification it was necessary to: (i) use homogenous recombinant standards; (ii) accurately assess the purity of standards; (iii) determine recovery of G proteins during sample preparation and Western blotting; and (iv) account for cross-reactivity among antisera. Four pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins were quantified with previously characterized polyclonal antisera. Gi alpha 1 also was measured with a novel, more sensitive monoclonal antibody (7H7). Go alpha and Gi alpha 2 but not Gi alpha 1 and Gi alpha 3 were detected in membrane extracts prepared from GH4C1 cells. In contrast, the G proteins copurified with SSTR2 receptors were predominantly Gi alpha 2 (50% of total G protein) and Gi alpha 3 (36% of total G protein), whereas Go alpha and Gi alpha 1 were negligible. G beta subunits also were detected. Silver staining confirmed the absence of a 39-kDa protein, corresponding to the M(r) of Go alpha associated with purified SRIF receptor-G protein complexes. These data suggest that SRIF receptors selectively couple to two G proteins, one of which is sparsely expressed in GH4C1 cells; the data conform to the notion that SRIF receptors discriminate between similar pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1559069116,"Neuronal tissue-specific proteins B-50 (GAP-43, neuromodulin) and neurogranin are phosphorylated by phosphorylase kinase with stoichiometries of 0.4 and 0.5 mol of phosphate/mol of protein, respectively. The apparent Km and kcat values determined at pH 8.2 for neurogranin phosphorylation are 28.4 microM and 139.3 min-1, respectively, and for B-50 phosphorylation are 22.8 microM and 33.2 min-1, respectively. As a substrate of phosphorylase kinase, phosphorylase is approximately 44 and approximately 13 times better than B-50 and neurogranin, respectively. Both proteins are better substrates of protein kinase C than of phosphorylase kinase and are phosphorylated on a single site by phosphorylase kinase. The sequence analyses of tryptic phosphopeptides isolated from neurogranin and B-50 phosphorylated by phosphorylase kinase revealed the same amino acid sequence, IQASF, indicating that phosphorylase kinase phosphorylates the calmodulin-binding regulatory regions of B-50 and neurogranin previously known to be phosphorylated by protein kinase C (Coggins, P. J., and Zwiers, H. (1989) J. Neurochem. 53, 1895-1901; Baudier, J., Deloulme, J. C., Dorsselaer, A. V., Black, D., and Matthes, W. D. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 229-237). In rat brain synaptosomes, a relatively high phosphorylase kinase specific activity is detected, and approximately 32% activity is associated with synaptic membranes where B-50 is localized. In rat brain homogenate and synaptosomal membranes, phosphorylation of a protein that co-migrates with B-50 on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is enhanced in the presence of exogenous phosphorylase kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1608114043,"The ciliated protozoan Paramecium tetraurelia contains two protein kinase activities (CaPK-1 and CaPK-2) that are dependent on Ca2+ (Gundersen, R. E., and Nelson, D. L. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 4602-4609). We purified Ca(2+)-dependent protein kinase-1 (CaPK-1) 1,000-fold from the EGTA-extracted soluble fractions of Paramecium. The purified enzyme was a single polypeptide of 52 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a native molecular mass of 60,000, suggesting that the active enzyme is a monomer. The purified kinase used casein as the best substrate in vitro, and its activity was absolutely dependent on Ca2+. The physical, catalytic and regulatory properties were clearly distinct from those of casein kinase, protein kinase C, and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases. CaPK-1 was half maximally activated by submicromolar (0.2 microM) free Ca2+, and the purified kinase bound Ca2+ in a blot overlay assay. CaPK-1 and the previously characterized CaPK-2 were biochemically and immunologically different enzymes sharing a similar activation mechanism. CaPK-1 and CaPK-2 appear to be members of a new family of Ca(2+)-dependent protein kinases. A protein immunologically related to the CaPKs was also detected in rat brain."
https://openalex.org/W1481978313,"Mammalian aspartyl-tRNA synthetase occurs in the multienzyme complex of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, while bacterial and yeast aspartyl-tRNA synthetases exist as free soluble enzymes. Cloning and sequencing of mammalian aspartyl-tRNA synthetase revealed a newly evolved N-terminal 32-amino-acid sequence, which contains a putative amphiphilic helix (Jacobo-Molina, A., Peterson, R., and Yang, D. C. H. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 16608-16612). Human aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (hDRS) and an N-terminal 32-residue truncated form of human aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (hDRS delta 32) were expressed in Escherichia coli under the control of the inducible tac promoter as glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins linked through a thrombin cleavage site. The GST-hDRS fusion protein and the GST-hDRS delta 32 were purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose and were fully active in aspartylation of mammalian tRNA. After cleavage of GST from the fusion proteins by thrombin, hDRS and hDRS delta 32 were purified by affinity chromatography on tRNA-Sepharose. Both hDRS and hDRS delta 32 were present as a mixture of monomeric and dimeric forms. GST-hDRS formed high molecular weight aggregates while GST-hDRS delta 32 was a dimeric protein. Both hDRS and hDRS delta 32 bound to hydrophobic interaction gels such as aminohexyl-agarose. In the absence of propylene glycol, hDRS bound to amino-hexyl-agarose weaker than hDRS delta 32, but, in the presence of 50% propylene glycol, hDRS bound tighter than hDRS delta 32. Both hDRS and hDRS delta 32 were fully active in aspartylation of mammalian tRNA and ATP-PPi exchange. In comparison to the N-terminal truncated form, the full-length enzyme showed greater thermal stability and ATP-PPi exchange activity but lower aminoacylation activity. The catalytic constant of hDRS delta 32 for aminoacylation of tRNA was 2-fold higher than that of hDRS. The Michaelis-Menten constants for aspartic acid and tRNAAsp were 302 microM and 13 nM for hDRS, and 29 microM and 130 nM for hDRS delta 32, respectively. These results suggest that the newly evolved N-terminal peptide in hDRS may modulate the enzymatic activity, the stability, and the chromatographic behavior of hDRS. The structure and function of the N-terminal peptide in aspartyl-tRNA synthetase and in the synthetase complex will be discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1511713132,"Noncatalytic nucleotide sites of Escherichia coli F1-ATPase were studied by site-directed mutagenesis, covalent photolabeling with 2-azido-ATP, and lin-benzo-ATP binding. In wild-type, 89% of 2-azido-ATP label was bound to beta-subunit, whereas in the beta Y354F mutant, 95% of the label was bound to alpha-subunit. In the alpha R365Y mutant, label was seen on both alpha (38%) and beta (62%); whereas in the alpha R365F mutant, 93% was on beta. The fluorescence of noncatalytic site-bound lin-benzo-ATP was quenched markedly in F1 from wild-type (76% quench), alpha R365F (85%), alpha R365Y (90%), and alpha R365Y, beta Y354F (83%), but only by 28% in beta Y354F. These results together demonstrate that residues alpha R365 and beta Y354 lie close to the base moiety of adenine nucleotide bound in F1 noncatalytic sites. From comparison of sequences of alpha- and beta-subunits, it appears that residue alpha R365 in noncatalytic sites is equivalent to residue beta Y331 of the catalytic sites. Two unintended mutants were obtained in which alpha-subunit was increased in length by 17 amino acids due to repeat of residues alpha 361 to alpha 377, with either F or Y in the repeated alpha 365 position. Soluble F1 was obtained from both mutants, with novel properties."
https://openalex.org/W1614393064,"Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) has been employed to characterize the thermal denaturation of CPL1 lysozyme and its isolated fragments in the absence and presence of choline. The heat capacity function of CPL1 lysozyme shows two peaks with Tm values of 43.5 and 51.4 degrees C. At saturating concentrations of choline the second transition disappears, and the Tm is shifted to higher temperatures. The DSC thermogram of the C-CPL1 protein corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal domain of CPL1 lysozyme has a single peak with a Tm of 42.9 degrees C. The effect of choline is very similar to that observed for the whole CPL1 lysozyme. The NH2-terminal fragment obtained by proteolytic digestion shows a Tm of 52 degrees C, close to that of 51.4 degrees C found for the second transition of CPL1, and choline does not affect the Tm nor the denaturation enthalpy. These data suggest that choline is bound to the COOH-terminal domain of the protein. Deconvolution of the excess heat capacity curve of the CPL1 lysozyme shows that the data can be fitted to two two-state independent transitions. The analysis of the DSC curves showed that the NH2-terminal unfolding enthalpy steadily decreases with increasing concentrations of choline. These results indicate that, under saturating concentrations of choline, whole CPL1 could unfold as a single cooperative unit."
https://openalex.org/W1853075927,"Interleukin-8 (IL-8), a monocyte-derived neutrophil chemotactic agent, has a potential role in the regulation of inflammatory responses. The specific receptor for IL-8 has been identified and characterized on the surface of human neutrophils (Samanta, A. K., Oppenheim, J. J., and Matsushima, K. (1989) J. Exp. Med. 169, 1185-1189). The present study demonstrates that at least two sulfhydryl groups of this receptor from human neutrophils participate in the binding of IL-8. Incubation of neutrophils with sulfhydryl group-modifying reagents, N-ethylmaleimide and diazene dicarboxylic acid bis-N,N-dimethylamide (diamide), severely impaired the binding of 125I-IL-8 to neutrophils. Treatment with 0.8 mM N-ethylmaleimide and 0.4 mM diamide inhibit binding of 125I-IL-8 to the neutrophils by 62 and 60%, respectively. These inhibitory effects could be reversed by 84-87% by treatment with 2-4 mM dithiothreitol. The saturable amount of the ligand, IL-8, provided partial protection against the modifying reagents. N-Ethylmaleimide and diamide at a concentration of 0.4 mM reduced chemotactic migration of neutrophils in a Boyden chamber by 95 and 60%, respectively. At a concentration of 0.4 mM, N-ethylmaleimide reduced the IL-8-induced (10 micrograms/ml) release of myeloperoxidase by 50%. Under identical conditions, 0.4 mM diamide could reduce release of myeloperoxidase by 63%. Finally, N-ethylmaleimide severely affected the overall binding and total uptake of 125I-IL-8 to the neutrophils at 37 degrees C, a condition required for receptor-mediated internalization of the ligand and recycling of the receptor to the surface of neutrophils. Nitro blue tetrazolium reduction test of the lipopolysaccharide-stimulated neutrophils indicates that compared to control general metabolic functions of thiol-modified cells were markedly retained. These data suggest that at least two conformationally vicinal free reactive sulfhydryl groups are located in the binding domain of the receptor in neutrophils which are essential for IL-8-mediated biological responses."
https://openalex.org/W1840284621,"The interactions of [3H]procollagen I with various phospholipids were studied by density gradient centrifugation. At physiological conditions of pH, ionic strength, and temperature, there was no evidence for procollagen binding to phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, or phosphatidylserine liposomes. In contrast, procollagen I bound strongly to sphingomyelin liposomes in a reversible and saturable manner, with an apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of 2.6 nM. Binding occurred over a range of temperatures (4-37 degrees C) and was relatively unaffected by salt concentrations up to 1.2 M NaCl. Binding was observed in phosphate buffers, but not in the presence of high concentrations of Tris or Hepes. Bovine serum albumin had no effect on procollagen binding to sphingomyelin, and neither did unlabeled type I collagen, with or without the nonhelical telopeptides. Procollagen II and denatured procollagen I also bound to sphingomyelin. Procollagen binding to sphingomyelin at 35 degrees C was considerably reduced when small amounts of phosphatidylcholine were present, although binding was partially restored when the temperature was reduced below the corresponding phase transition temperature. Purified unlabeled procollagen COOH-terminal propeptides successfully competed for binding, and 125I-labeled COOH-terminal propeptides bound to sphingomyelin in the absence of procollagen. Weaker binding to sphingomyelin, mediated by the collagen triple helical region, was also observed; but this was dominated by the sphingomyelin-COOH-terminal propeptide interaction. The data suggest a novel mechanism for matrix vesicle-mediated biomineralization."
https://openalex.org/W1597805384,"URF13 is a membrane protein unique to mitochondria from maize having the Texas male-sterile cytoplasm (cms-T), which is capable of permeabilizing biological membranes in the presence of a family of pathotoxins (T-toxins) produced by certain fungi or the insecticide methomyl. The carboxylate-specific reagent dicyclohexylcarbodiimide has been shown previously to protect URF13-containing membranes against the permeabilizing effects of added T-toxin or methomyl. Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide was found to covalently cross-link URF13 into higher order oligomers, including dimers, trimers, and tetramers, in isolated cms-T mitochondria and Escherichia coli cells expressing URF13. In intact E. coli cells and isolated spheroplasts, the observed protection against the effects of methomyl was not associated with the appearance of dimers but was correlated with the appearance of cross-linked trimers and tetramers. Following treatment of E. coli cells expressing URF13 with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, the specific binding of tritiated T-toxin was reduced by 50% and all binding cooperativity was lost. A similar decrease in the level of T-toxin binding and loss of binding cooperativity were observed with site-directed, T-toxin-insensitive URF13 mutants at aspartate 39, the residue known to undergo reaction with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. When coupled with a postulated three membrane-spanning helical model of URF13, these results provide initial insights into the intermolecular interactions involved in URF13 oligomer formation."

https://openalex.org/W2140443842,"The crystal structure of human transthyretin (TTR) complexed with milrinone (2-methyl-5-cyano-3,4'-bipyridin-6(1H)-one), a positive inotropic cardiac agent, has been refined to R = 17.4% for 8-1.9-A resolution data. This report provides the first detailed description of protein interactions for an inotropic bipyridine agent which is an effective thyroid hormone binding competitor to transthyretin. Milrinone is bound along the 2-fold axis in the binding site with its substituted pyridone ring located deep within the channel of the two identical binding domains of the TTR tetramer. In this orientation the 5-cyano group occupies the same site as the 3'-iodine in the TTR complex with 3,3'-diiodothyronine (Wojtczak, A., Luft, J., and Cody, V. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 353-357), which is 3.5 A deeper in the channel than thyroxine (Blake, C. C. F., and Oately, S. J., (1977) Nature 268, 115-120). These structural results confirm computer modeling studies of milrinone structural homology with thyroxine and its TTR binding interactions and explain the effectiveness of milrinone competition for thyroxine binding to TTR. To understand the weaker binding affinity of the parent inotropic drug, amrinone (5-amino-3,4'-bipyridin-6(1H)-one), modeling studies of its TTR binding were carried out which indicate that the 5-amino group cannot participate in strong interactions with TTR and the lack of the 2-methyl further weakens amrinone binding."
