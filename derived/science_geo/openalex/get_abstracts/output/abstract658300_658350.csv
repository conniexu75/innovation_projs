https://openalex.org/W3078555423,"Lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer mortality, exhibits heterogeneity that enables adaptability, limits therapeutic success, and remains incompletely understood. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of metastatic lung cancer was performed using 49 clinical biopsies obtained from 30 patients before and during targeted therapy. Over 20,000 cancer and tumor microenvironment (TME) single-cell profiles exposed a rich and dynamic tumor ecosystem. scRNA-seq of cancer cells illuminated targetable oncogenes beyond those detected clinically. Cancer cells surviving therapy as residual disease (RD) expressed an alveolar-regenerative cell signature suggesting a therapy-induced primitive cell-state transition, whereas those present at on-therapy progressive disease (PD) upregulated kynurenine, plasminogen, and gap-junction pathways. Active T-lymphocytes and decreased macrophages were present at RD and immunosuppressive cell states characterized PD. Biological features revealed by scRNA-seq were biomarkers of clinical outcomes in independent cohorts. This study highlights how therapy-induced adaptation of the multi-cellular ecosystem of metastatic cancer shapes clinical outcomes."

The Three-Dimensional Organization of Mammalian Genomes.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2017; 33: 265-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). At a larger scale, chromatin is partitioned into A and B compartments that are enriched for active and inactive chromatin, respectively (Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009Lieberman-Aiden E. van Berkum N.L. Williams L. Imakaev M. Ragoczy T. Telling A. Amit I. Lajoie B.R. Sabo P.J. Dorschner M.O. et al.Comprehensive Mapping of Long-Range Interactions Reveals Folding Principles of the Human Genome.Science. 2009; 326: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (4135) Google Scholar). The physiological significance of A/B compartmentalization is implicated by its changes during development and between cell types (Yu and Ren, 2017Yu M. Ren B. The Three-Dimensional Organization of Mammalian Genomes.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2017; 33: 265-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Although these high-throughput sequencing-based approaches are powerful and have greatly enriched our knowledge of 3D genome organization, they provide contact information for pairs of chromatin loci but not direct spatial position information of individual loci. Furthermore, most of the genome-wide insights into chromatin organization are built on population-averaged contact maps across millions of cells. Investigation of 3D genome organization in single cells remains a challenging task despite recent improvements in single-cell Hi-C methods (Flyamer et al., 2017Flyamer I.M. Gassler J. Imakaev M.

Notably, a method that allows genome-scale measurements of chromatin organization and transcriptional activity in the same cells has not emerged, despite the demand for such a method to further our understanding of how chromatin organization regulates transcription and vice versa. Imaging-based approaches, on the other hand, provide a direct measure of the spatial positions of chromatin loci in individual cells with high detection efficiency. In particular, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) provides highly specific detection of chromatin loci in fixed cells (Levsky and Singer, 2003Levsky J.M. Singer R.H. Fluorescence in situ hybridization: past, present and future.J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2833-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system substantially enhances our ability to image specific chromatin loci in live cells (Chen et al., 2016aChen B.

A CRISPR-dCas Toolbox for Genetic Engineering and Synthetic Biology.J. Mol. Biol. 2019; 431: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, current imaging methods have limited throughput in sequence space, traditionally allowing the study of only a few genomic loci at a time. We recently developed a chromatin tracing approach by sequential rounds of FISH imaging that enabled imaging of tens of distinct chromatin loci in single cells (Wang et al., 2016Wang S. Su J.-H.

Spatial organization of chromatin domains and compartments in single chromosomes.Science. 2016; 353: 598-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). However, because the number of genomic loci that can be imaged in individual cells remains limited, a high-resolution view of whole chromosomes in single cells is still missing, not to mention a genome-scale view of chromatin organization in individual cells. Here we report a multi-scale multiplexed FISH imaging technology that enables simultaneous imaging of hundreds to more than 1,000 distinct genomic loci at various resolutions and genomic coverages in single cells. Using this approach, we further demonstrate simultaneous imaging of more than 1,000 genomic loci with nascent RNA transcripts of more than 1,000 genes residing in these loci and landmark nuclear structures, including nuclear speckles and nucleoli. This approach allows us to place chromatin organization in its native structural and functional context and, thus, to explore the relationship between chromatin organization, transcriptional activity, and nuclear structures in single cells. To enable a systematic view of chromatin structures across multiple scales, we developed an imaging platform (STAR Methods; Table S1) for direct visualization of chromatin with exceptionally high throughput in sequence space up to the genome scale. This platform includes two complementary approaches (Figure 1A). First, for imaging of chromatin structures that are relatively small so that different loci therein are difficult to resolve in any single image, we expanded our previously reported sequential imaging strategy (Wang et al., 2016Wang S. Su J.-H. Beliveau B.J. Bintu B. Moffitt J.R. Wu C. Zhuang X. Spatial organization of chromatin domains and compartments in single chromosomes.Science. 2016; 353: 598-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) to allow tracing of hundreds of chromatin loci in single cells. In this approach, chromatin is imaged one locus at a time (or M loci at a time with M-color imaging) across many imaging rounds (Figure 1A, left). We demonstrated this approach by using it to trace the conformation of whole chromosomes in single cells at high resolution. Second, to image chromatin structures that occupy an area substantially larger than the diffraction-limited resolution, we developed a more efficient, combinatorial imaging strategy based on multiplexed error-robust FISH (MERFISH) (Chen et al., 2015Chen K.H. Boettiger A.N. Moffitt J.R. Wang S. Zhuang X. Spatially resolved, highly multiplexed RNA profiling in single cells.Science. 2015; 348: aaa6090Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar), where many chromatin loci are imaged simultaneously in each round, and their distinct identities are determined based on the combinations of rounds in which they appear (Figure 1A, right). The latter approach allows more genomic loci to be imaged in fewer imaging rounds. We used this approach to provide a genome-scale view of chromatin organization in the context of transcriptional activity and important nuclear structures in single cells. In this section, we describe high-resolution whole-chromosome tracing using the sequential imaging approach (Figure 1A, left; Figure S1A). We first focused on human chromosome 21 (Chr21) and partitioned the non-repetitive portion of the chromosome (Chr21, 10.4–46.7 Mb, from the hg38 assembly) into ~650 segments (i.e., ~650 genomic loci), each 50 kb in length (see STAR Methods for details). We then designed a library of primary oligonucleotide probes (Table S2), each containing a variable target sequence for hybridizing to the different regions of the chromosome and a readout sequence that is unique to each of the 50-kb loci and can be detected by complementary fluorescent readout probes (Figure S1A). However, identifying these loci with ~650 distinct, dye-labeled readout probes would be prohibitively expensive, given the high cost of dye-labeled oligonucleotides. To overcome this challenge, we devised a two-step labeling strategy to detect the distinct readout sequences with a common set of three dye-labeled readout probes (one for each color channel) mediated by unlabeled adaptor probes that convert each locus-specific readout sequence into one of the three common readout sequences (Figure S1A; Table S3). Using this strategy, we sequentially imaged ~650 genomic loci in Chr21 in human lung fibroblast (IMR-90) cells using more than 200 rounds of hybridization with three-color imaging. To enable stable imaging over such a large number of rounds, we optimized our imaging protocol to (1) maintain sample integrity and primary probe binding stability and (2) ensure complete removal of the fluorescence signal after each imaging round and minimize the accumulation of residual signal across hundreds of labeling rounds (see STAR Methods for a detailed experimental protocol). After imaging, we determined the centroid position of each chromatin locus in 3D and reconstructed the conformation of each copy of Chr21 in each cell (Figure 1B). To estimate how stable the sample and imaging instruments were over many hybridization rounds, we re-imaged a subset of loci after different numbers of rounds and used the displacement between the originally imaged locations and re-imaged locations of the loci to assess measurement accuracy. The median displacement increased from ~70 nm to ~120 nm when the number of hybridization rounds separating the original and re-imaging instances increased from ~10 to ~250 (Figures S1B and S1C). Loci that displayed greater displacement upon re-imaging tended to have a lower fluorescence signal intensity (Figure S1D). Among the loci that had large spatial distances from neighboring loci, a fraction of them also exhibited large re-imaging displacement errors and low brightness, suggesting relatively low confidence in the localizations of these loci that are far away from both of their genomic neighbors (see STAR Methods for details). Overall, the median displacement errors for individual loci upon re-imaging were substantially smaller than the median distances between neighboring chromatin loci (~250 nm) (Figure S1B). In addition, median pairwise distances between imaged loci were highly reproducible between biological replicates (Figure S1E). The detection efficiency of the chromatin loci in these experiments was more than 90%. To obtain a population-averaged view of the conformation of Chr21, we quantified the pairwise interaction between imaged loci by calculating their median spatial distance and their proximity frequency (i.e., the probability that the loci come into proximity) across all imaged chromosome copies (~12,100 copies from the two replicates) (Figure 1C; Figures S1F–S1I). We observed a high correlation between our median pairwise distances from the imaging data and previously published Hi-C data (Figures S1F–S1I). To choose the cutoff distance below which we consider two loci to be in proximity, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient between the Hi-C data (Rao et al., 2014Rao S.S.P. Huntley M.H. Durand N.C. Stamenova E.K. Bochkov I.D. Robinson J.T. Sanborn A.L. Machol I. Omer A.D. Lander E.S. Aiden E.L. A 3D map of the human genome at kilobase resolution reveals principles of chromatin looping.Cell. 2014; 159: 1665-1680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2888) Google Scholar) and the proximity frequencies derived from our imaging data across a range of cutoff distances. The Pearson correlation coefficient remained high for a wide range of cutoff distances but peaked at 0.87 when the cutoff distance was ~400–600 nm (Figure S1J). We thus chose 500 nm as the cutoff distance to generate proximity frequency maps throughout this work. The median distance and the proximity frequency maps showed block-like TAD structures (Figure 1C; Figures S1F and S1H). TAD boundaries identified from the distance and proximity frequency maps from our imaging data were highly similar to those determined from Hi-C data and were not sensitive to the localization error (~100 nm) in our chromatin traces (Figure S1K). Chromosomes were partitioned into domains that manifested as on-diagonal block-like features in single-cell spatial distance matrices, which also exhibited complex off-diagonal features indicating longer-range interactions (Figure S1L). These domains, long-range interactions, and the inter-locus distances showed high cell-to-cell variability (Figures S1L and S1M), consistent with the substantial variability in chromatin contacts observed in single-cell Hi-C data (Flyamer et al., 2017Flyamer I.M.

We previously observed similar single-cell domains and cell-to-cell variability when imaging small (~2-Mb) regions of the chromosome (Bintu et al., 2018Bintu B. Mateo L.J. Su J.

Super-resolution chromatin tracing reveals domains and cooperative interactions in single cells.Science. 2018; 362 (eaau1783)Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). However, within these small regions, a sizable fraction of cells did not display clear domain boundaries, and it remained unclear whether domains did not form within those cells or whether the entire imaged regions were within a single domain. Furthermore, the small size of the imaged regions prohibited accurate characterization of certain domain properties, such as their physical and genomic sizes. The high genomic throughput in this study provides a whole-chromosome view of these single-cell domain structures, revealing their presence in most of the imaged chromosome copies, allowing us to characterize their properties in a more systematic manner. We first identified the genomic locations of the boundaries of these single-cell domains. Although we observed a non-zero probability of boundary formation at nearly all imaged genomic loci, the domain boundaries were preferentially positioned near the binding sites of CTCF and cohesin (Figures 1C and 1D). In addition to the cell-to-cell variations in domain boundary positions, we also observed substantial heterogeneity in other features of these single-cell domains, ranging from their physical size to the degree of insulation or interaction between domains (Figures 1E–1H). Single-cell domains were variable in their genomic size (Figure 1I) and physical size (Figures 1E and 1J), neither of which was sensitive to our estimated locus localization error (Figures 1I and 1J). Domains bounded by the same genomic regions or having the same genomic size varied considerably in physical size from cell to cell (Figure 1E; Figure S1N). Interestingly, domains bounded by pairs of CTCF/cohesin binding sites that form loops in Hi-C maps (Rao et al., 2014Rao S.S.P. Huntley M.H. Durand N.C. Stamenova E.K. Bochkov I.D. Robinson J.T.

In addition, the degree of physical segregation between neighboring domains also varied substantially (Figures 1F and 1L), with some neighboring domains completely segregated in space w"
https://openalex.org/W3079197556,"We previously demonstrated that leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients are selectively reliant on amino acid metabolism and that treatment with the combination of venetoclax and azacitidine (ven/aza) inhibits amino acid metabolism, leading to cell death. In contrast, ven/aza fails to eradicate LSCs in relapsed/refractory (R/R) patients, suggesting altered metabolic properties. Detailed metabolomic analysis revealed elevated nicotinamide metabolism in relapsed LSCs, which activates both amino acid metabolism and fatty acid oxidation to drive OXPHOS, thereby providing a means for LSCs to circumvent the cytotoxic effects of ven/aza therapy. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), the rate-limiting enzyme in nicotinamide metabolism, demonstrated selective eradication of R/R LSCs while sparing normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that elevated nicotinamide metabolism is both the mechanistic basis for ven/aza resistance and a metabolic vulnerability of R/R LSCs."
https://openalex.org/W3058093851,"Maternal decidual NK (dNK) cells promote placentation, but how they protect against placental infection while maintaining fetal tolerance is unclear. Here we show that human dNK cells highly express the antimicrobial peptide granulysin (GNLY) and selectively transfer it via nanotubes to extravillous trophoblasts to kill intracellular Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) without killing the trophoblast. Transfer of GNLY, but not other cell death-inducing cytotoxic granule proteins, strongly inhibits Lm in human placental cultures and in mouse and human trophoblast cell lines. Placental and fetal Lm loads are lower and pregnancy success is greatly improved in pregnant Lm-infected GNLY-transgenic mice than in wild-type mice that lack GNLY. This immune defense is not restricted to pregnancy; peripheral NK (pNK) cells also transfer GNLY to kill bacteria in macrophages and dendritic cells without killing the host cell. Nanotube transfer of GNLY allows dNK to protect against infection while leaving the maternal-fetal barrier intact."
https://openalex.org/W3051574499,"An animal at rest or engaged in stationary behaviors can instantaneously initiate goal-directed walking. How descending brain inputs trigger rapid transitions from a non-walking state to an appropriate walking state is unclear. Here, we identify two neuronal types, P9 and BPN, in the Drosophila brain that, upon activation, initiate and maintain two distinct coordinated walking patterns. P9 drives forward walking with ipsilateral turning, receives inputs from central courtship-promoting neurons and visual projection neurons, and is necessary for a male to pursue a female during courtship. In contrast, BPN drives straight, forward walking and is not required during courtship. BPN is instead recruited during and required for fast, straight, forward walking bouts. Thus, this study reveals separate brain pathways for object-directed walking and fast, straight, forward walking, providing insight into how the brain initiates context-appropriate walking programs."

https://openalex.org/W3078954816,"Fetal and adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have distinct proliferation rates, lineage biases, gene expression profiles, and gene dependencies. Although these differences are widely recognized, it is not clear how the transition from fetal to adult identity is coordinated. Here we show that murine HSCs and committed hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) undergo a gradual, rather than precipitous, transition from fetal to adult transcriptional states. The transition begins prior to birth and is punctuated by a late prenatal spike in type I interferon signaling that promotes perinatal HPC expansion and sensitizes progenitors to the leukemogenic FLT3ITD mutation. Most other changes in gene expression and enhancer activation are imprecisely timed and poorly coordinated. Thus, heterochronic enhancer elements, and their associated transcripts, are activated independently of one another rather than as part of a robust network. This simplifies the regulatory programs that guide neonatal HSC/HPC ontogeny, but it creates heterogeneity within these populations."

Astrocyte alterations were studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) including immunogold molecular localization, and by laser scanning microscopy (LSM) with immunofluorescence for integrin β1, α-dystroglycan, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Astrocyte proliferation and apoptosis were quantified by Ki67 and TUNEL labeling, respectively.Astrocytes in normal optic nerve head expressed integrin β1 and α-dystroglycan by LSM and TEM immunogold labeling at electron dense junctional complexes that were found only on cell membrane zones bordering their basement membranes (BM) at the peripapillary sclera (PPS) and optic nerve head capillaries. At 1-3 days after IOP elevation, abnormal extracellular spaces appeared between astrocytes near PPS, and axonal vesical and mitochondrial accumulation indicated axonal transport blockade. By 1 week, abnormal spaces increased, new collagen formation occurred, and astrocytes separated from their BM, leaving cell membrane fragments. Electron dense junctional complexes separated or were absent at the BM. Astrocyte proliferation was modest during the first week, while only occasional apoptotic astrocytes were observed by TEM and TUNEL.Astrocytes normally exhibit junctions with their BM which are disrupted by extended IOP elevation.

https://openalex.org/W3080540137,"Bladder cancer (BCA) is relatively common and potentially recurrent/progressive disease. It is also costly to detect, treat, and control. Definitive diagnosis is made by examination of urine sediment, imaging, direct visualization (cystoscopy), and invasive biopsy of suspect bladder lesions. There are currently no widely-used BCA-specific biomarker urine screening tests for early BCA or for following patients during/after therapy. Urine metabolomic screening for biomarkers is costly and generally unavailable for clinical use. In response, we developed Raman spectroscopy-based chemometric urinalysis (Rametrix™) as a direct liquid urine screening method for detecting complex molecular signatures in urine associated with BCA and other genitourinary tract pathologies. In particular, the RametrixTM screen used principal components (PCs) of urine Raman spectra to build discriminant analysis models that indicate the presence/absence of disease. The number of PCs included was varied, and all models were cross-validated by leave-one-out analysis. In Study 1 reported here, we tested the Rametrix™ screen using urine specimens from 56 consented patients from a urology clinic. This proof-of-concept study contained 17 urine specimens with active BCA (BCA-positive), 32 urine specimens from patients with other genitourinary tract pathologies, seven specimens from healthy patients, and the urinalysis control SurineTM. Using a model built with 22 PCs, BCA was detected with 80.4% accuracy, 82.4% sensitivity, 79.5% specificity, 63.6% positive predictive value (PPV), and 91.2% negative predictive value (NPV). Based on the number of PCs included, we found the RametrixTM screen could be fine-tuned for either high sensitivity or specificity. In other studies reported here, RametrixTM was also able to differentiate between urine specimens from patients with BCA and other genitourinary pathologies and those obtained from patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). While larger studies are needed to improve RametrixTM models and demonstrate clinical relevance, this study demonstrates the ability of the RametrixTM screen to differentiate urine of BCA-positive patients. Molecular signature variances in the urine metabolome of BCA patients included changes in: phosphatidylinositol, nucleic acids, protein (particularly collagen), aromatic amino acids, and carotenoids."
https://openalex.org/W3080408612,"Enzymes that cleave ATP to activate carboxylic acids play essential roles in primary and secondary metabolism in all domains of life. Class I adenylate-forming enzymes share a conserved structural fold but act on a wide range of substrates to catalyze reactions involved in bioluminescence, nonribosomal peptide biosynthesis, fatty acid activation, and β-lactone formation. Despite their metabolic importance, the substrates and functions of the vast majority of adenylate-forming enzymes are unknown without tools available to accurately predict them. Given the crucial roles of adenylate-forming enzymes in biosynthesis, this also severely limits our ability to predict natural product structures from biosynthetic gene clusters. Here we used machine learning to predict adenylate-forming enzyme function and substrate specificity from protein sequences. We built a web-based predictive tool and used it to comprehensively map the biochemical diversity of adenylate-forming enzymes across >50,000 candidate biosynthetic gene clusters in bacterial, fungal, and plant genomes. Ancestral phylogenetic reconstruction and sequence similarity networking of enzymes from these clusters suggested divergent evolution of the adenylate-forming superfamily from a core enzyme scaffold most related to contemporary CoA ligases toward more specialized functions including β-lactone synthetases. Our classifier predicted β-lactone synthetases in uncharacterized biosynthetic gene clusters conserved in >90 different strains of Nocardia. To test our prediction, we purified a candidate β-lactone synthetase from Nocardia brasiliensis and reconstituted the biosynthetic pathway in vitro to link the gene cluster to the β-lactone natural product, nocardiolactone. We anticipate that our machine learning approach will aid in functional classification of enzymes and advance natural product discovery."
https://openalex.org/W3081483181,"Electronic health records (EHRs) contain rich documentation regarding disease symptoms and progression, but EHR data is challenging to use for diagnosis prediction due to its high dimensionality, relative scarcity, and substantial level of noise. We investigated how to best represent EHR data for predicting cervical cancer, a serious disease where early detection is beneficial for the outcome of treatment. A case group of 1321 patients with cervical cancer were matched to ten times as many controls, and for both groups several types of events were extracted from their EHRs. These events included clinical codes, lab results, and contents of free text notes retrieved using a LSTM neural network. Clinical events are described with great variation in EHR texts, leading to a very large feature space. Therefore, an event hierarchy inferred from the textual events was created to represent the clinical texts. Overall, the events extracted from free text notes contributed the most to the final prediction, and the hierarchy of textual events further improved performance. Four classifiers were evaluated for predicting a future cancer diagnosis where Random Forest achieved the best results with an AUC of 0.70 from a year before diagnosis up to 0.97 one day before diagnosis. We conclude that our approach is sound and had excellent discrimination at diagnosis, but only modest discrimination capacity before this point. Since our study objective was earlier disease prediction than such, we propose further work should consider extending patient histories through e.g. the integration of primary health records preceding referral to hospital."

In the secretory pathway, newly synthesized membrane proteins (cargos) are exported from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) toward the Golgi, where they sequentially pass through cisternae of the Golgi stack. Once reaching the trans-side of the Golgi, cargos are packed into membrane carries destined for the plasma membrane (PM) or endolysosomes (1Guo Y. Sirkis D.W. Schekman R.

It is well-accepted that protein trafficking is mediated by a signal, usually a cytosolic short stretch of amino acids (AAs) that is recognized by diverse trafficking machineries. In the secretory pathway, the efficient ER export of many cargos can be facilitated by COPII coat–binding ER export signals (4Mancias J.D. Goldberg J. Exiting the endoplasmic reticulum.Traffic. 2005; 6 (15752134): 278-28510.1111/j.1600-0854.2005.00279.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 5Ma D. Jan L.Y.

Without such targeting or export signals, the majority of secretory cargos, such as vesicular stomatitis glycoprotein G (VSVG), follow the by default constitutive exocytic pathway and are exported from the Golgi in noncoated membrane carriers (7Hirschberg K.

So far, the generic Golgi export signal has not been identified for the constitutive pathway, although a putative signal was reported in a viral membrane protein (10Parmar H.B. Barry C. Kai F. Duncan R. Golgi complex-plasma membrane trafficking directed by an autonomous, tribasic Golgi export signal.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2014; 25 (24451258): 866-87810.1091/mbc.E13-07-0364Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Lacking a conventional coat-like machinery, it is also unclear how these cargos are sorted from Golgi transmembrane-resident proteins (hereafter referred to as residents) and recruited to the exocytic membrane carriers. Almost all secretory proteins are glycosylated in the ER and/or Golgi. However, the roles of polysaccharide chains or glycans in the protein secretion are still unclear. The best-known example is the mannose 6-phosphate (M6P)-modified glycan, which specifically attaches to the soluble hydrolytic enzymes of the lysosome (11Braulke T. Bonifacino J.S. Sorting of lysosomal proteins.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1793 (19046998): 605-61410.1016/j.bbamcr.2008.10.016Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 12Ghosh P. Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S.

At the TGN, M6P is recognized by M6P receptor, which subsequently concentrates lysosomal enzymes to clathrin-coated vesicles targeting to the endolysosome. As another example, at the ER exit site, the cargo receptor, ERGIC53, binds to the high-mannose N-glycans of several soluble secretory proteins, such as coagulation factor V and VII, for their efficient ER export through COPII-coated vesicles (13Dancourt J. Barlowe C. Protein sorting receptors in the early secretory pathway.Annu. Rev.

Although the molecular mechanism behind is still obscure, available data indicate that glycans are also involved in the sorting and trafficking of secretory cargos to the PM. In cargos without basolateral PM sorting signals, glycans have been demonstrated by multiple research groups to act as an apical PM-targeting signal in polarized epithelial cells (15Potter B.A. Hughey R.P. Weisz O.A. Role of N- and O-glycans in polarized biosynthetic sorting.Am. J. Physiol.

Balda M.S. Hauri H.P. Matter K. Carbohydrate-mediated Golgi to cell surface transport and apical targeting of membrane proteins.EMBO J. 1998; 17 (9524115): 1919-192910.1093/emboj/17.7.1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) to determine the role of N-glycosylation in the Golgi-to-PM trafficking. By employing reporters with mutated basolateral PM-targeting signals, they found that artificially introducing N-glycans targeted Golgi-arrested occludin and ERGIC53 chimeras to the PM, whereas abolishing the native N-glycosylation of Fc receptor by tunicamycin arrested its exocytic trafficking in the Golgi. In the budding yeast, Proszynski et al. (18Proszynski T.J. Simons K. Bagnat M. O-Glycosylation as a sorting determinant for cell surface delivery in yeast.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15 (14742720): 1533-154310.1091/mbc.e03-07-0511Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) found that compromising the O-glycosylation of a PM transmembrane protein, Fus1p, caused its accumulation in the late Golgi. Furthermore, they noted that the introduction of an O-glycosylation site to the Golgi-localized Fus1p mutant rescued its transport to the PM. Despite these works, according to our knowledge, the role of O- and N-glycans on the constitutive secretory transport of Golgi is still unclear and has not been systematically studied. Here, we first found that cargos lacking O-glycosylation can accumulate in the Golgi due to their slow Golgi export. By quantitatively measuring the Golgi residence times of various transmembrane secretory reporters, we subsequently uncovered that both O- and N-glycans can function as a generic Golgi export signal at the trans-Golgi for constitutive exocytic trafficking. During our study of secretory cargos, we focused on the cell surface receptor, interleukin 2 (IL2) receptor α subunit, or Tac. The expression of Tac is restricted to immune cells. Devoid of known sorting signals, it is commonly used as a type I transmembrane reporter for the study of the membrane trafficking. The luminal region of Tac comprises the IL2-binding domain (IBD) and stem region (Fig. 1A). The stem region is a short stretch of ∼30 AAs connecting the transmembrane domain and the extracellular IBD. GFP-tagged truncation clones were constructed to explore roles of different regions in Tac's secretory trafficking (Fig. 1A). As expected, full-length Tac was mainly found on the PM at the steady state, with no colocalization with the Golgi marker GM130 (Fig. 1B). However, in addition to the PM, we were surprised to find a predominant Golgi localization of Tac-TC (Fig. 1B), a truncation mutant missing the entire luminal region. Tac-STC, the IBD deletion clone, displayed an intermediate phenotype, in which roughly half of expressing cells had the same localization pattern as Tac (Fig. 1B), whereas the remaining showed the Golgi localization (Fig. S1A). Consistent with the visual assessment, the Golgi-to-cell intensity ratio of Tac-STC is between that of Tac and Tac-TC. Further investigation of Tac-STC on its Golgi localization is described below. Similar to a conventional Golgi resident, such as B4GALT1 (hereafter GalT), when the Golgi was disassembled by brefeldin A (19Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Brefeldin A: insights into the control of membrane traffic and organelle structure.J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116 (1740466): 1071-108010.1083/jcb.116.5.1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (1541) Google Scholar), the Golgi pool of Tac-TC redistributed to the ER (Fig. S1, B and C); when the Golgi was “dispersed” by the microtubule inhibitor, nocodazole (20Cole N.B. Sciaky N. Marotta A. Song J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Golgi dispersal during microtubule disruption: regeneration of Golgi stacks at peripheral endoplasmic reticulum exit sites.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7 (8730104): 631-65010.1091/mbc.7.4.631Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), Tac-TC also followed GalT to the Golgi mini-stack at the ER exit site (Fig. S1D). The normal Golgi localization of Tac-TC was restored when brefeldin A or nocodazole was washed out (Fig. S1, B–D). The protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide (CHX), was added throughout the treatment and washout to minimize the interference of the newly synthesized Tac-TC. In summary, our observations demonstrate that Tac-TC of the Golgi pool behaves like a conventional Golgi resident. Tac has not been known as a Golgi resident. A Golgi resident is usually expected to have a retrieval and/or retention mechanism to maintain its steady-state localization at the Golgi (21Banfield D.K. Mechanisms of protein retention in the Golgi.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2011; 3 (21525512): a00526410.1101/cshperspect.a005264Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 22Pelham H.R. Munro S.

What is the mechanism behind the Golgi localization of Tac-TC? A secretory cargo's Golgi localization is determined by its entrance and exit (or export) of the Golgi (Fig. 2A). For a conventional secretory cargo such as Tac, the Golgi entrance at the steady state is primarily contributed by the ER-to-Golgi transport of newly synthesized protein, whereas the exit is contributed by the Golgi-to-PM trafficking. Although recycling can possibly occur between the Golgi and ER (e.g. the retrograde followed by the anterograde or ER-to-Golgi trafficking), the recycled fraction is likely to be small. Most importantly, if a cargo resides in the Golgi at the steady state for a sufficiently long time, the cycling between the Golgi and ER reaches a semi-steady state and hence does not produce a substantial net change in the cargo's Golgi pool. We also studied the possibility of the post-Golgi retrieval of our reporters to the Golgi. It is known that VSVG does not return to the Golgi from the PM (23Lippincott-Schwartz J. Roberts T.H. Hirschberg K. Secretory protein trafficking and organelle dynamics in living cells.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16 (11031247): 557-58910.1146/annurev.cellbio.16.1.557Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Using the internalization of the surface-bound antibody, constitutive secretory cargos such as Tac, cluster of differentiation 8a (CD8a), transferrin receptor (TfR), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored mCherry (mCherry-GPI), did not return to the Golgi, once reaching the PM (Fig. S2A), consistent with their lack of Golgi-targeting signals. Interestingly, we found that post-Golgi-localized ST6GAL1 (hereafter ST) and ERGIC53 did not target to the Golgi from the PM and the endolysosome either (the significance of which will be discussed elsewhere) (Fig. S2, B and C). Hence, the pre- and post-Golgi recycling or retrieval are not considered in the Golgi localization of cargos used in this study. At the steady state, we can assume that the cargo's Golgi entrance velocity is a constant, which is determined by its rate of biosynthesis, and its Golgi export velocity follows the first-order kinetics. When the velocity of the export is equal to that of the entrance, the Golgi pool reaches dynamic equilibrium, and its size is expected to be in a reverse relationship with the Golgi export rate constant. Hence, a cargo that slowly exits the Golgi can have a significant Golgi localization, and, once the protein synthesis is blocked, the cargo's Golgi pool gradually decreases by following the exponential decay function (7Hirschberg K. Miller C.M. Ellenberg J. Presley J.F. Siggia E.D. Phair R.D. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Kinetic analysis of secretory protein traffic and characterization of Golgi to plasma membrane transport intermediates in living cells.J.

To test the hypothesis that the Golgi localization of Tac-TC is due to its slow Golgi export, we measured the t½ of Tac-TC's Golgi export and compared it with those of Golgi residents and conventional secretory cargos. To that end, we live-imaged cells expressing GFP-tagged proteins under the treatment of CHX (Fig. 2B). The t½, referred to as the Golgi residence time hereafter, was subsequently acquired by fitting the Golgi intensity decay data using the first-order exponential function (Fig. 2C). The usage of the Golgi residence time as a Golgi export metric is advantageous, as it should be independent of the cargo's expression level and post-Golgi fates, such as degradation and cleavage. The Golgi residence times of ST and ERGIC53 were similarly measured (Fig. S2, D and E). RUSH (retention using selective hooks) reporters (25Boncompain G. Divoux S. Gareil N. de Forges H. Lescure A. Latreche L. Mercanti V. Jollivet F. Raposo G. Perez F. Synchronization of secretory protein traffic in populations of cells.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 (22406856): 493-49810.1038/nmeth.1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) were employed to measure the Golgi residence times of constitutive secretory cargos, including mCherry-GPI, TNFα, and VSVG. They were first accumulated in the Golgi by 20 °C temperature block (26Saraste J. Kuismanen E. Pre- and post-Golgi vacuoles operate in the transport of Semliki Forest virus membrane glycoproteins to the cell surface.Cell. 1984; 38 (6432345): 535-54910.1016/0092-8674(84)90508-7Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), and the resulting Golgi pools were subsequently live-imaged at 37 °C (Fig. S2, F–H), at which RUSH reporters started synchronously leaving the Golgi for the PM. Altogether, our quantitative data demonstrate that, although significantly less than those of ST (5.3 h) and ERGIC53 (5.5 h) (Fig. S2, I and J), the Golgi residence time of Tac-TC (3.4 h) is ≥10-fold those of mCherry-GPI, TNFα, and VSVG (Fig. 2D and Fig. S2 (K–M)). Therefore, Tac-TC differs from conventional secretory cargos in its slow Golgi export, which likely results in its apparent Golgi localization. From the Golgi localization results of Tac truncation clones (Fig. 1B), we reasoned that the stem region should be essential for the efficient Golgi export. The most significant feature within this region is the presence of multiple Thr residues, which undergo mucin-type O-glycosylation at the Golgi (27Miedel M.C. Hulmes J.D. Weber D.V. Bailon P. Pan Y.C. Structural analysis of recombinant soluble human interleukin-2 receptor: primary structure, assignment of disulfide bonds and core IL-2 binding structure.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 154 (3134887): 372-37910.1016/0006-291X(88)90695-XCrossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We hence asked if the O-glycan can serve as a Golgi export signal for Tac. To test this hypothesis, we inhibited the O-glycosylation of Tac using two approaches. First, an O-glycosylation–negative Tac mutant, Tac(5A), was generated by mutating all 5 Thr residues within the stem region (Fig. 3A), which were previously known to be O-glycosylated (27Miedel M.C. Hulmes J.D. Weber D.V. Bailon P. Pan Y.C. Structural analysis of recombinant soluble human interleukin-2 receptor: primary structure, assignment of disulfide bonds and core IL-2 binding structure.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 154 (3134887): 372-37910.1016/0006-291X(88)90695-XCrossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). When expressed in cells, Tac(5A) displayed a strong Golgi localization (Fig. 3B, 0 min), in contrast to Tac (Fig. 1B). To measure the Golgi residence time of Tac, which does not display a steady-state Golgi localization, the 20 °C synchronization protocol was used to first accumulate GFP-Tac in the Golgi before live-imaging at 37 °C in the presence of CHX (Fig. 3C). Our data showed that the Golgi residence time of Tac(5A) (47 min) is almost 3-fold that of Tac (16 min) (Fig. 3, D and E). To rule out the effect of the pH variation across different Golgi regions on the GFP fluorescence (28Tsien R.Y. The green fluorescent protein.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67 (9759496): 509-54410.1146/annurev.biochem.67.1.509Crossref PubMed Scopus (4930) Google Scholar) and the potential structural hindrance of the luminal region by the luminally tagged GFP, we prepared C-terminally or cytosolically tagged Tac and Tac(5A) (Fig. S3A). We found that the Golgi residence times of C-terminally tagged Tac and Tac(5A) were very similar to the corresponding N-terminally tagged ones (Fig. S3, B and C), therefore suggesting that the pH and hindrance effect of GFP might be insignificant. Second, we took advantage of a small-molecule inhibitor, benzyl 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-α-d-galactopyranoside (GalNAc-O-Bn), which compromises the mucin-type O-glycosylation by blocking the extension of O-GalNAc, the first sugar that is covalently linked to the protein (29Kuan S.F. Byrd J.C. Basbaum C. Kim Y.S. Inhibition of mucin glycosylation by aryl-N-acetyl-α-galactosaminides in human colon cancer cells.J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264 (2509474): 19271-19277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We confirmed the inhibitory effect of GalNAc-O-Bn on the O-glycosylation of Tac by its gel migration profile (Fig. S3D). When cells expressing GFP-Tac were treated with GalNAc-O-Bn, Tac exhibited a substantial Golgi localization, and its Golgi residence time (51 min) is 2.6-fold that of DMSO control (20 min) (Fig. 3, F–H), which was acquired by the 20 °C synchronization protocol described above. Thus, extended O-glycans (hereafter O-glycans) can substantially promote the Golgi export of Tac compared with O-GalNAc, which results from prolonged GalNAc-O-Bn treatment. Consistent with our result, it was previously reported that O-glycosylation–deficient Tac accumulated intracellularly and had little cell surface expression (30Kozarsky K.F. Call S.M. Dower S.K. Krieger M. Abnormal intracellular sorting of O-linked carbohydrate-deficient interleukin-2 receptors.Mol. Cell Biol. 1988; 8 (3264879): 3357-336310.1128/mcb.8.8.3357Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar); in the budding yeast, Fus1p, a cell surface type I transmembrane protein, was found to require the O-glycosylation at its juxtamembrane region for its post-Golgi trafficking to the PM (18Proszynski T.J. Simons K. Bagnat M. O-Glycosylation as a sorting determinant for cell surface delivery in yeast.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15 (14742720): 1533-154310.1091/mbc.e03-07-0511Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We further investigated why the stem region containing Tac-STC displayed a mixed phenotype with a substantial fraction of cells showing the Golgi localization (Fig. 1B). The gel migration profile of Tac-STC and its 5A mutant revealed that only a small fraction of Tac-STC, 10% by quantifying band intensities in lane 1 and 3, is O-glycosylated (Fig. S3E). Hence, its Golgi localization is probably due to the lack of O-glycosylation in Tac-STC. Together, our observations suggest that the O-glycan at the stem region might be necessary for the efficient Golgi export of Tac. We tested two more secretory cargos that possess mucin-type O-glycosylation. Resembling Tac, CD8a is a type I transmembrane protein that has a juxtamembrane stem region with multiple O-glycosylation sites (Fig. 4A) (31Leahy D.J. Axel R. Hendrickson W.A. Crystal structure of a soluble form of the human T cell coreceptor CD8 at 2.6 Å resolution.Cell. 1992; 68 (1547508): 1145-116210.1016/0092-8674(92)90085-QAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). TfR is a type II transmembrane protein with a single O-glycosylation site (Thr-104) near its transmembrane domain (Fig. 4A). VSVG, a type I transmembrane protein that only undergoes N-glycosylation (32Ortega V. Stone J.A. Contreras E.M. Iorio R.M. Aguilar H.C. Addicted to sugar: roles of glycans in the order Mononegavirales.Glycobiology. 2019; 29 (29878112): 2-2110.1093/glycob/cwy053Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), served as a negative control. In cells expressing GFP-CD8a, TfR-GFP, or VSVG-SBP-GFP (in the presence of biotin), we observed that, whereas none appeared at the Golgi in control treatment, CD8a and TfR, but not VSVG, displayed strong Golgi localization under GalNAc-O-Bn treatment (Fig. 4 (B and C) and Fig. S4A). Their Golgi residence times under control and GalNAc-O-Bn treatment were subsequently measured (Fig. 4 (D–J) and Fig. S4 (B–E)). We found that GalNAc-O-Bn treatment substantially prolonged the Golgi residence times of both CD8a and TfR, but not that of VSVG. Like Tac, we also prepared CD8a with C-terminally or cytosolically tagged GFP (Fig. S4F) to rule out the pH and hindrance effect of luminally tagged GFP. The residence times of CD8a-GFP under DMSO or GalNAc-O-Bn treatment were very similar to those of an N-terminally tagged one (Fig. S4, G and H). In summary, our observations suggest that the O-glycan might be necessary for the efficient Golgi export of generic O-glycosylated cargos. We investigated the Golgi export of GFP-Tac(5A) (Fig. 3A) when O-glycans are reintroduced. The stem region of CD8a or Cstem (AAs 134–177) has 5 Thr and 2 Ser residues for potential O-glycosylation (Fig. 5A and Fig. S5A) (31Leahy D.J. Axel R. Hendrickson W.A. Crystal structure of a soluble form of the human T cell coreceptor CD8 at 2.6 Å resolution.Cell. 1992; 68 (1547508): 1145-116210.1016/0092-8674(92)90085-QAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Cstem was adopted as a transferable sequence for multiple O-glycosylation, together with a nonglycosylation negative control, Cstem(7A), in which the above-mentioned Thr and Ser are mutated to Ala. Cstem or Cstem(7A) was subsequently inserted in between GFP and Tac(5A) to make chimeras, GFP-Cstem-Tac(5A) and GFP-Cstem(7A)-Tac(5A) (Fig. 5A and Fig. S5A). Both chimeras were likely N-glycosylated as their gel migration profiles were sensitive to PNGase F treatment (Fig. S5B). Furthermore, GFP-Cstem(7A)-Tac(5A) was observed to migrate slightly faster than GFP-Cstem-Tac(5A), consistent with the expectation that the former has fewer or no O-glycans. When their Golgi residence times were subsequently measured, we observed that GFP-Tac(5A) with Cstem (38 min) had a much-reduced Golgi residence time compared with that with Cstem(7A) (76 min) (Fig. 5 (B and C) and Fig. S5C), suggesting that the O-glycan is probably sufficient to promote the Golgi export of Tac(5A). Altogether, our data demonstrate that the O-glycan is both necessary and sufficient for the efficient Golgi export of Tac, therefore supporting our hypothesis that the O-glycan might function as a Golgi export signal. We chose ST to study the effect of O-glycan's quantity on the Golgi export. We first confirmed that ST is N-glycosylated by PNGase F digestion (Fig. S5D), as reported previously (33Chen R. Jiang X. Sun D. Han G. Wang F. Ye M. Wang L. Zou H. Glycoproteomics analysis of human liver tissue by combination of multiple enzyme digestion and hydrazide chemistry.J.

https://openalex.org/W3081263281,"DNA-binding Transcription Factors (TFs) play a central role in regulation of gene expression in prokaryotic organisms, and similarities at the sequence level have been reported. These proteins are predicted with different abundances as a consequence of genome size, where small organisms contain a low proportion of TFs and large genomes contain a high proportion of TFs. In this work, we analyzed a collection of 668 experimentally validated TFs across 30 different species from diverse taxonomical classes, including Escherichia coli K-12, Bacillus subtilis 168, Corynebacterium glutamicum, and Streptomyces coelicolor, among others. This collection of TFs, together with 111 hidden Markov model profiles associated with DNA-binding TFs collected from diverse databases such as PFAM and DBD, was used to identify the repertoire of proteins putatively devoted to gene regulation in 1321 representative genomes of Archaea and Bacteria. The predicted regulatory proteins were posteriorly analyzed in terms of their genomic context, allowing the prediction of functions for TFs and their neighbor genes, such as genes involved in virulence, enzymatic functions, phosphorylation mechanisms, and antibiotic resistance. The functional analysis associated with PFAM groups showed diverse functional categories were significantly enriched in the collection of TFs and the proteins encoded by the neighbor genes, in particular, small-molecule binding and amino acid transmembrane transporter activities associated with the LysR family and proteins devoted to cellular aromatic compound metabolic processes or responses to drugs, stress, or abiotic stimuli in the MarR family. We consider that with the increasing data derived from new technologies, novel TFs can be identified and help improve the predictions for this class of proteins in complete genomes.

https://openalex.org/W3081388452,"The biogenesis of mitochondria requires the import of hundreds of precursor proteins. These proteins are transported post-translationally with the help of chaperones, meaning that the overproduction of mitochondrial proteins or the limited availability of chaperones can lead to the accumulation of cytosolic precursor proteins. This imposes a severe challenge to cytosolic proteostasis and triggers a specific transcription program called the mitoprotein-induced stress response, which activates the proteasome system. This coincides with the repression of mitochondrial proteins, including many proteins of the intermembrane space. In contrast, herein we report that the so-far-uncharacterized intermembrane space protein Mix23 is considerably up-regulated when mitochondrial import is perturbed. Mix23 is evolutionarily conserved and a homolog of the human protein CCDC58. We found that, like the subunits of the proteasome, Mix23 is under control of the transcription factor Rpn4. It is imported into mitochondria by the mitochondrial disulfide relay. Mix23 is critical for the efficient import of proteins into the mitochondrial matrix, particularly if the function of the translocase of the inner membrane 23 is compromised such as in temperature-sensitive mutants of Tim17. Our observations identify Mix23 as a novel regulator or stabilizer of the mitochondrial protein import machinery that is specifically up-regulated upon mitoprotein-induced stress conditions."

Participants were classified by amblyogenic risk factor (24 anisometropic, 25 strabismic and 30 mixed) and, for those with strabismus, also by refractive response (16 accommodative and 39 non-accommodative). We characterized our sample using three variables, called the ‘triplet’ henceforth: interocular acuity difference, stereoacuity and imbalance factor. Binocular imbalance showed high test-retest reliability (no significant difference between test and retest in a subgroup, n = 20, p = 0.831); was correlated with Worth 4 dots test (r = 0.538, p<0.0001); and correlated with both interocular acuity difference (r = 0.575, p<0.0001) and stereoacuity (r = 0.675, p<0.0001). The mean values of each variable of the triplet differed depending on group classification. Mixed and non-accommodative groups showed the worst mean values compared with the other groups. Among participants with strabismus, strabismic vs mixed subgroups did not show significant differences in any variable of the triplet, whereas the accommodative vs non-accommodative subgroups showed significant differences in all of them. According to a univariate logistic model, any variable of the triplet provides a good metric for differentiating patients from controls, except for binocular imbalance for anisometropic subgroup. The proposed binocular imbalance test is feasible and reliable. We recommend monitoring amblyopia clinically not only considering visual acuity, but also stereoacuity and interocular imbalance. Stereoacuity on its own fails because of the high percentage of patients with no measurable stereoacuity. Binocular imbalance may help to fill that gap."
https://openalex.org/W3080392625,"In face recognition applications, humans often team with algorithms, reviewing algorithm results to make an identity decision. However, few studies have explicitly measured how algorithms influence human face matching performance. One study that did examine this interaction found a concerning deterioration of human accuracy in the presence of algorithm errors. We conducted an experiment to examine how prior face identity decisions influence subsequent human judgements about face similarity. 376 volunteers were asked to rate the similarity of face pairs along a scale. Volunteers performing the task were told that they were reviewing identity decisions made by different sources, either a computer or human, or were told to make their own judgement without prior information. Replicating past results, we found that prior identity decisions, presented as labels, influenced volunteers’ own identity judgements. We extend these results as follows. First, we show that the influence of identity decision labels was independent of indicated decision source (human or computer) despite volunteers’ greater distrust of human identification ability. Second, applying a signal detection theory framework, we show that prior identity decision labels did not reduce volunteers’ attention to the face pair. Discrimination performance was the same with and without the labels. Instead, prior identity decision labels altered volunteers’ internal criterion used to judge a face pair as “matching” or “non-matching”. This shifted volunteers’ face pair similarity judgements by a full step along the response scale. Our work shows how human face matching is affected by prior identity decision labels and we discuss how this may limit the total accuracy of human-algorithm teams performing face matching tasks."

HIDS has an incidence of 1:50,000 to 1:5,000, and is thought to be prevalent mainly in northern Europe. Here, we report a case series of HIDS from India, which includes ten patients from six families who presented with a wide spectrum of clinical features such as recurrent fever, oral ulcers, rash, arthritis, recurrent diarrhea, hepatosplenomegaly, and high immunoglobulin levels. Using whole exome sequencing (WES) and/or Sanger capillary sequencing, we identified five distinct genetic variants in the MVK gene from nine patients belonging to six families. The variants were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic as per the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG-AMP) guidelines for annotation of sequence variants. Over 70% of patients in the present study had two recurrent mutations in MVK gene i.e. a nonsynonymous variant p.V377I, popularly known as the ‘Dutch mutation’, along with a splicing variant c.226+2delT in a compound heterozygous form. Identity by descent analysis in two patients with the recurrent variants identified a 6.7 MB long haplotype suggesting a founder effect in the South Indian population. Our analysis suggests that a limited number of variants account for the majority of the patients with HIDS in South India. This has implications in clinical diagnosis, as well as in the development of cost-effective approaches for genetic diagnosis and screening. To our best knowledge, this is the first and most comprehensive case series of clinically and genetically characterized patients with HIDS from India."

Sensitivity and specificity analyses were performed using combined fundoscopy and OCT as the reference standard.Ninety eyes were diagnosed with neovascular AMD and the remaining 19 eyes were normal based on the reference standard. Of these, neovascular AMD was detected using ClarusTM in 94.4% (85/90). The sensitivities of Optos® and digital fundus photographs were 81.1% (73/90) and 87.8% (79/90), respectively. The specificities using ClarusTM, Optos®, and digital fundus photographs were 89.5% (17/19), 94.7% (18/19), and 89.5% (17/19), respectively.ClarusTM, with its ability to image high-resolution wide field fundus, was considered superior for diagnosing neovascular AMD with high sensitivity and specificity.

The Genome-Wide Association analysis (GWAS) identified fourteen SNPs: rs135340276, rs134895560, rs110190635, rs42949831, rs135982573, rs109393235, rs109531929, rs135087545, rs41839733, rs42486577, rs136661522, rs110882543, rs110864071, rs109722627, (P<8.1E-05), nine of them were located on intergenic regions, harboring seventeen genes, of which only ACER3, VRK2, FANCL and SLCO3A1 were considered candidate associated with bovine temperament due to their reported biological functions. Five SNPs were located at introns of the NRXN3, EXOC4, CACNG4 and SLC9A4 genes. The indicated candidate genes are implicated in a wide range of behavioural phenotypes and complex cognitive functions. The association of the fourteen SNPs on bovine temperament traits (EV, PS and TS) was evaluated; all these SNPs were significant for EV; only some were associated with PS and TS. Fourteen SNPs were associated with EV which allowed the identification of twenty-one candidate genes for Brahman temperament. From a functional point of view, the five intronic SNPs identified in this study, are candidates to address control of bovine temperament, further investigation will probe their role in expression of this trait."

In this study, three potential influences are examined: 1) the robot’s level of interaction skills, 2) the robot’s expected future role as a helpful assistant or a threatening competitor, and 3) people’s individual background with regard to robots and technology in general. In an experimental lab study with a 2x2 between-subjects-design (N = 162), people read a vignette describing the social robot Nao either as assistant or competitor and subsequently interacted with Nao, which either displayed high or low interaction skills. Results of a structural equation model show that the robot’s interaction skill level had the strongest effect, with a low level leading to a negative evaluation of the robot’s sociability and competence and subsequently a negative general evaluation of the interaction with the robot. A robot which was expected to become a competitor was also evaluated as less sociable than a robot expected to become an assistant. Overall, in case of an actual interaction with a social robot, the robot’s behavior is more decisive for people’s evaluations of it than their expectations or individual backgrounds."
https://openalex.org/W3081324599,"Diabetes can elicit direct deleterious effects on the myocardium, independent of coronary artery disease or hypertension. These cardiac disturbances are termed diabetic cardiomyopathy showing increased risk of heart failure with or without reduced ejection fraction. Presently, there is no specific treatment for this type of cardiomyopathy and in the case of type I diabetes, it may start in early childhood independent of glycemic control. We hypothesized that alterations in isolated myocyte contractility and cardiac function are present in the early stages of experimental diabetes in rats before overt changes in myocardium structure occur. Diabetes was induced by single-dose injection of streptozotocin (STZ) in rats with data collected from control and diabetic animals 3 weeks after injection. Left ventricle myocyte contractility was measured by single-cell length variation under electrical stimulation. Cardiac function and morphology were studied by high-resolution echocardiography with pulsed-wave tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) measurements and three-lead surface electrocardiogram. Triglycerides, cholesterol and liver enzyme levels were measured from plasma samples obtained from both groups. Myocardial collagen content and perivascular fibrosis of atria and ventricle were studied by histological analysis after picrosirius red staining. Diabetes resulted in altered contractility of isolated cardiac myocytes with increased contraction and relaxation time intervals. Echocardiography showed left atrium dilation, increased end-diastolic LV and posterior wall thickness, with reduced longitudinal systolic peak velocity (S’) of the septum mitral annulus at the apical four-chamber view obtained by TDI. Triglycerides, aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase were elevated in diabetic animals. Intertitial collagen content was higher in atria of both groups and did not differ among control and diabetic animals. Perivascular intramyocardial arterioles collagen did not differ between groups. These results suggest that alterations in cardiac function are present in the early phase in this model of diabetes type 1 and occur before overt changes in myocardium structure appear as evaluated by intersticial collagen deposition and perivascular fibrosis of intramyocardial arterioles."
https://openalex.org/W3081097397,"Besides understanding the effects of fishing on harvested fish stocks, effects on non-target species, habitats and seafloor integrity also need to be considered. Static fishing gears have often been mentioned as a lower impact fishing alternative to towed gears, although studies examining their actual impact on the seafloor are scarce. In this study, we aimed to describe fish trap movements on the seafloor related to soaking time and trap retrieval. Impacts on the seafloor of lightweight rectangular traps and heavier circular traps were compared. We used 3D video cameras to estimate sweeping motion on the seabed and penetration into the sediment during soaking time. The area and distance swept by each type of trap during retrieval was determined by a camera set up facing the sea bottom. The potential rotation of the traps around the mainline was assessed using an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler. Results showed that no penetration and almost no movements could be detected during soaking time for either lightweight or heavy commercial traps, even for high tidal coefficient (maximum 6 cm). No rotation could be observed when the tide turned. The swept area covered by a trap during retrieval was low (maximum 2.04 m2) compared to towed fishing gear and other static gear."
https://openalex.org/W3081108324,"Cancer, the most stressful event a person may experience often triggers depression. Depression among these groups of people, in turn, affects chemotherapy adherence, length of hospitalization, quality of life and cancer treatment outcome. Even though the problem is enormous studies that address it are limited. Therefore this study was conducted to determine the prevalence of depression and associated factors among cancer patients on chemotherapy in Felege-Hiwot referral hospital and University of Gondar referral hospital, Northwest Ethiopia.An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from April to May 2019. A total of 302 cancer patients on chemotherapy were included. Depression was assessed using the patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9). Binary logistic regression was used to select variables and determine Crude Odds Ratio (COR). Variables with P value < 0.2 were entered into multivariable logistic regression. Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) with 95% confidence intervals for variables with P-value < 0.05 was estimated to show factors affecting depression among cancer patients. The fitness of the model was checked by using the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test.The prevalence of depression among cancer patients on chemotherapy was 70.86% (95% CI: 65.38, 75.92). Educational status of college and above (AOR = 0.1, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.43), Jobless (AOR = 0.15, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.58), Underweight(AOR = 2.39, 95% CI: 1.10, 5.19)chemotherapy duration ≥ 6 months or more (AOR = 2.36, 95% CI: 1.16, 4.79) were notably associated with depression.The burden of depression among cancer patients in this study was high. We recommend concerned bodies working to curve the problem to intervene based on the identified risk factors. Improving educational status, reducing work stress and maintaining normal weight would reduce depression."
https://openalex.org/W3080388560,"Root treatment with oxathiapiprolin, benthiavalicarb or their mixture Zorvec-Endavia [ZE (3+7, w/w)] was shown to provide prolonged systemic protection against foliar oomycete pathogens attacking cucumber, tomato and basil. Here we report that these fungicides can effectively protect potato plants against late blight when applied to the soil in which such potato plants are grown. In two field experiments, performed in 2019 and 2020, potato plants grown in 64 L containers were treated with a soil drench of oxathiapiprolin, benthiavalicarb or ZE at 12.5, 25 or 50 mg ai/five plants in a container. Artificial inoculations with Phytophthora infestans revealed that such treated plants were protected against late blight in a dose-dependent manner all along the season. Interestingly, oxathiapiprolin persisted in the treated soil for at least 139 days, providing systemic protection against late blight to the following potato crops grown in that treated soils. Potato plants grown in loess soil in the field were either sprayed or drenched with ZE. Plants treated via the soil were significantly better protected against late blight compared to the plants treated by a spray. The data demonstrate a new strategy for season-long protection of potato against late blight by a single soil application of ZE. The systemic nature of oxathiapiprolin and benthiavalicarb composing ZE assures the translocation to the foliage of two fungicides with different modes of action. This shall minimize the risk of developing resistance against either fungicide in the treated crops."
https://openalex.org/W3081101175,"Objectives Although smoking is known to have a negative impact in patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS), only a few studies have examined the association between electronic cigarette (e-cig) use and MetS. Methods Among 22,948 participants in the 6th Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 14,738 (13,459 [91.3%] never, 954 [6.5%] ever, and 325 [2.2%] current e-cig users) were selected. The relationship between e-cig exposure and MetS (based on the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel [NCEP-ATP] III criteria) was evaluated using a multivariable logistic regression analysis. An unweighted analysis was performed to evaluate this association without a sampling weight. A subgroup analysis was performed among active smokers to compare dual users with never e-cig users. Results Among current e-cig users, 85.0% were dual users, 12.7% were former cigarette users, and 2.2% were only e-cig users. After adjustment for covariates, abdominal obesity and hypertriglyceridemia were significantly associated with current e-cig exposure (odds ratio [OR]: 1.88, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.41–2.50 and OR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.00–1.74 respectively [compared with the never e-cig users group]). Compared with never e-cig users, current e-cig users showed an OR of 1.27 (95% CI: 0.96–1.70, Ptrend = 0.01) for MetS. In the unweighted analysis, the OR for MetS in current e-cig users was 1.40 (95% CI: 1.08–1.81, Ptrend <0.01). Compared with never e-cig users, dual users showed a higher OR for abdominal obesity (OR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.25–2.34, Ptrend <0.001). Conclusions Current e-cig exposure was associated with an increased risk of MetS. Dual use of e-cigs and cigarettes was associated with abdominal obesity. Further longitudinal studies and better assessment of e-cig use and type are needed to clarify this relationship."
https://openalex.org/W3081385286,"Bordetella pertussis vaccine escape mutants that lack expression of the pertussis antigen pertactin (Prn) have emerged in vaccinated populations in the last 10-20 years. Additionally, clinical isolates lacking another acellular pertussis (aP) vaccine component, filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), have been found sporadically. Here, we show that both whole-cell pertussis (wP) and aP vaccines induced protection in the lungs of mice, but that the wP vaccine was more effective in nasal clearance. Importantly, bacterial populations isolated from the lungs shifted to an FHA-negative phenotype due to frameshift mutations in the fhaB gene. Loss of FHA expression was strongly selected for in Prn-deficient strains in the lungs following aP but not wP vaccination. The combined loss of Prn and FHA led to complete abrogation of bacterial surface binding by aP-induced serum antibodies. This study demonstrates vaccine- and anatomical site-dependent adaptation of B. pertussis and has major implications for the design of improved pertussis vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W3068279136,"Academic travel has a substantial carbon footprint. The ongoing pandemic has propelled the development and adoption of technologies for online delivery of seminars and remote attendance at scientific conferences. This should not lead to the complete elimination of in-person events, but the scientific community must seize the opportunity to permanently change its modus operandi and reduce the impact of its activities on the environment. Academic travel has a substantial carbon footprint. The ongoing pandemic has propelled the development and adoption of technologies for online delivery of seminars and remote attendance at scientific conferences. This should not lead to the complete elimination of in-person events, but the scientific community must seize the opportunity to permanently change its modus operandi and reduce the impact of its activities on the environment. I was supposed to be across the ocean mid-June for a society-run conference on plant reproduction. However, just like many other conferences this year, the event was canceled because of COVID-19. I currently serve as the society’s president, and I had been looking forward to hearing about research happening in the field and discussing new initiatives with the executive board. Though the cancellation was disappointing, not going on this and several other trips has allowed me to substantially reduce my carbon footprint this year. Despite being aware that my academic travel contributes substantially to my overall carbon footprint, it has taken the ongoing international pandemic to trigger me to critically review my habits. It has prompted me to reflect on the assumed benefits of academic travel and the creative alternatives that can replace it. Just like many of my colleagues, my annual travel schedule usually comprises multiple trips abroad. It is not unusual for a mid-career principal investigator (PI) to attend 5, 10, or even more out-of-town events per year to attend workshops, conferences, PhD defenses, or invited seminars. All of this adds up to academics traveling at a rate that is substantially higher than the average population (Buchs, 2019Buchs M. University sector must tackle air travel emissions. The Conversation, July 9, 2019.2019https://theconversation.com/university-sector-must-tackle-air-travel-emissions-118929Google Scholar; Nathans and Sterling, 2016Nathans J. Sterling P. How scientists can reduce their carbon footprint.eLife. 2016; 5: e15928Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar; Quinton, 2020Quinton J.N. Cutting the carbon cost of academic travel.Nat Rev Earth Environ. 2020; 1: 13Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Given that many of these trips involve plane travel, an activity that causes a particularly high amount of greenhouse gas release, conference attendance alone has been calculated to represent 35% of a researcher’s overall carbon footprint (Achten et al., 2013Achten W.M.J. Almeida J. Muys B. Carbon footprint of science: More than flying.Ecological Indicators. 2013; 34: 352-355Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). As a result, the sector has a staggering carbon footprint (Sarabipour et al., 2020Sarabipour S. Schwessinger B. Mumoki F. Mwakilili A. Khan A. Debat H. Saez P. Seah S. Mestrovic T. Evaluating features of scientific conferences: A call for improvements.bioRxiv. 2020; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.02.022079Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Travel is, therefore, a worthwhile target for the reduction of the impact of academic activities on the environment. Yet, reducing academic travel is one of the last and most vehemently opposed bastions encountered by academic administrators aiming to make their institutions’ operations more sustainable. Although many universities worldwide have successfully increased the energetic efficiencies of buildings and operations, or eliminated single use carbon-neutral plastic items, curbing academic travel has been met with pronounced resistance as this measure is perceived to interfere with academic freedom and mandate. The opportunity to travel in the name of science, be it on field trips, to conferences, or to visit other research institutions, is considered by most academic researchers to be an integral part of their work. For many, it is even considered a perk that goes a long way toward compensating for modest salaries, performance pressure, and extreme work schedules associated with a successful tenure-track career. When scientists defend the necessity of travel, one of the main arguments is the perceived correlation between the value of an academic CV and the frequency of travel. The number of international speaking opportunities is, after all, among the quantifiable academic performance indicators. It is prestigious to be invited, it seems important to be visible in the community, and, more than anything, it appears crucial to disseminate research in person and to build the academic network. As a result, merit algorithms at many institutions reward international visibility and by consequence, the incentive system is designed to be in direct opposition to sustainability goals. However, whether the true value of these travel-related elements in the CV is actually as high as perceived has been put into question since research output and citations were found to not correlate with travel frequency in a study conducted at the University of British Columbia (Wynes et al., 2019Wynes S. Donner S.D. Tannason S. Nabors N. Academic air travel has a limited influence on professional success.J. Clean. Prod. 2019; 226: 959-967Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We must therefore carefully examine our motivations for travel. Significant improvements in the ecological impact of science will take structural changes in how the scientific community values professional travel as a currency of success. It calls for innovative ideas on how to replace or disrupt that value with sustainable alternatives, and it will necessitate individual willpower to adopt and persist in changes to our habits. At the institutional level, incentive structures must be reviewed to critically examine how performance parameters can be reconciled with sustainability goals. At the individual level, critical self-assessment is warranted. Some colleagues have started developing ideas for making academic travel and events more sustainable (Hamant et al., 2019Hamant O. Saunders T. Viasnoff V. Seven steps to make travel to scientific conferences more sustainable.Nature. 2019; 573: 451-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar; Nathans and Sterling, 2016Nathans J. Sterling P. How scientists can reduce their carbon footprint.eLife. 2016; 5: e15928Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar; Quinton, 2020Quinton J.N. Cutting the carbon cost of academic travel.Nat Rev Earth Environ. 2020; 1: 13Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar; Sarabipour et al., 2020Sarabipour S. Schwessinger B. Mumoki F. Mwakilili A. Khan A. Debat H. Saez P. Seah S. Mestrovic T. Evaluating features of scientific conferences: A call for improvements.bioRxiv. 2020; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.02.022079Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar), but few have taken drastic steps, and the disciplinary background doesn’t seem to make a difference (Wynes et al., 2019Wynes S. Donner S.D. Tannason S. Nabors N. Academic air travel has a limited influence on professional success.J. Clean. Prod. 2019; 226: 959-967Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Despite the slow progress, we are amid a massive shift in the culture and practice of scientific travel. All it took to expedite change was a pandemic. All travel worldwide came to a screeching halt because of a curveball with effects that are unprecedented in our lifetimes. The sudden emergence of the pandemic threat to human health was able to accomplish what the potentially much bigger threat of climate change hadn’t been able to do: it forced entire societies to engage in altruism and accept that the greater good requires individual sacrifice and change of behavior. Will our ability to respond to a perceived acute threat translate into the collective change of behavior that is necessary to face the much bigger yet apparently slower approaching threat of climate change? It is likely that once the current pandemic crisis is over, we will be tempted to return to the modus operandi of pre-2020. Once international travel restrictions are lifted and airlines resume their schedules, most of us will be eager to catch up. There might even be an overcompensation given that many of the conferences originally scheduled for 2020 are now rescheduled to 2021, and hotels and conference centers will be eager to fill their capacity. We have an opportune time, between now and the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, to pause for a moment and reflect on the future of academic travel. The sudden necessity to shelter in place and stop seeing people in person brought about the rapid emergence of alternative ways to meet and interact. Remote collaboration-enabling software, which had been available but only sporadically employed, is now ubiquitously installed on everyone’s computers. Although many had used Skype for simple videoconferencing before, we have now discovered a whole new technological world: from conversing with dozens of people simultaneously while screen sharing a presentation, to virtual waiting rooms, breakout sessions, and creative virtual backgrounds that successfully mask the pile of unfolded laundry in our home office. We should now seriously consider which of the face-to-face interactions we used to travel for before the pandemic could be permanently replaced through these technological means. Some types of academic interactions are easier to transfer to an online venue than others. Lab meetings, for example, became quite productive for my own team. We seized the opportunity to invite external speakers to journal clubs, something we hadn’t even thought of previously. The same format is easily adopted for the participation of external examiners at thesis defenses, and there is no reason to discontinue this practice after the pandemic. Online delivery of courses and lectures, on the other hand, remains a challenge—talking to a green light on top of a computer screen is so much harder than standing in front of a room with an audience whose members smile and nod in 3D, whose body language tells you whether to speed up or go slower, whether to rephrase a statement or skip a slide. With practice, delivering seminars remotely will become second nature, however. One of the most complex types of events to bring online is a scientific conference because it comprises so much more than oral presentations and poster sessions. The program of a typical larger conference might feature plenary and concurrent symposia, breakout sessions, panel discussions, networking events, workshops, poster competitions, industry exposition, award ceremonies, interview training sessions, banquets, and social mixers. Each of these formats has a purpose ranging from the dissemination and discussion of scientific data to career development training for junior scientists. Most importantly, conferences offer opportunities for both targeted and serendipitous encounters. Students can seek out potential future supervisors at the poster session, and scientific collaborations are born from spontaneous conversations at the welcome mixer. Online conferences had to invent ways to simulate these different communication channels and types of socialization and some did so quite successfully. Even chance encounters have been emulated by creating algorithms that bring individuals together on a virtual meeting platform (Achakulvisut et al., 2020Achakulvisut T. Ruangrong T. Acuna D. Wyble B. Goodman D. Kording K. neuromatch: Algorithms to match scientists.eLife Labs. 2020; https://elifesciences.org/labs/5ed408f4/neuromatch-algorithms-to-match-scientistsGoogle Scholar). So, is this the brave new world of the scientific conference? Is this the solution to the travel conundrum of the academic, at least until petrol-free and sustainable alternatives are widely implemented for travel and mobility? The answer is “yes, but not exclusively.” The resounding “yes” is motivated by the fact that, in addition to reducing the overall carbon footprint, online meetings have other advantages. For instance, participation is more affordable, accessible, and less time intensive. Online conferences offer the possibility to include those who are unable to travel for a variety of reasons, be they financial, related to family care obligations, reduced mobility or health reasons, or caused by travel bans or visa problems (Sarabipour et al., 2020Sarabipour S. Schwessinger B. Mumoki F. Mwakilili A. Khan A. Debat H. Saez P. Seah S. Mestrovic T. Evaluating features of scientific conferences: A call for improvements.bioRxiv. 2020; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.02.022079Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Online conferences are also easier to organize logistically, and the format offers structural opportunities. For example, more oral presentations than a conventional on-site conference can be accommodated, and posing questions doesn’t require the courage to grab the microphone but can be done through a chat function. The chat can also be used during synchronously delivered presentations for real-time exchange between audience members thus enriching the experience, especially for junior scientists (Achakulvisut et al., 2020Achakulvisut T. Ruangrong T. Acuna D. Wyble B. Goodman D. Kording K. neuromatch: Algorithms to match scientists.eLife Labs. 2020; https://elifesciences.org/labs/5ed408f4/neuromatch-algorithms-to-match-scientistsGoogle Scholar). The momentum created through the current pandemic needs to be seized to further develop the sophistication and versatility of online platforms to address their inherent challenges and promote their adoption. Challenges arise, for instance, when participants are in different time zones, and interacting with people on a screen for hours at a time is simply exhausting. Many of these challenges will certainly be solved through improved technology. Soon enough, the conference experience might be enriched using virtual reality headsets that allow participants to partake in a group chat around a virtual water cooler. Alternatively, hybrid models can be envisaged that combine online with smaller and local in-person events (Abbott, 2020Abbott A. Low-carbon, virtual science conference tries to recreate social buzz.Nature. 2020; 577: 13Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Here is the caveat: as brilliantly imaginative as future technological solutions will be, participating in an event from the office chair or kitchen table will never allow the experience of a full immersion. That pile of laundry, successfully masked from view by the virtual background on screen, will not fold itself—as your partner or child will certainly remind you. Traveling to an on-site conference means being away from home, being away from the daily grind—a state that frees the mind from domestic chores and day-to-day professional responsibilities. Letting the mind detach from daily routines for a while is beneficial for creativity. The proverbial collaboration that starts with an equation scribbled on the back of a cocktail napkin requires that the mind be allowed to wander and that we feel a connection to others that may start with a joint walk to a restaurant, a morning jog with like-minded colleagues along the river, or a friendly swim competition in the ocean behind the conference hotel. Aside from mental availability when away from home, an in-person event also involves the use of more senses than just seeing and hearing. The gustatory, olfactory, and tactile experience of a shared meal generates a feeling of community. I will never forget the lunch table discussion between two competing research groups who met in person for the first time at a conference that I had organized a few years ago. Arguments flew, hands waved, forks carved equations into the wooden table. Agreement on anything at all seemed far off. But by the time dessert was served, the two groups had not only agreed to amicably disagree but also to co-author a review paper. How much better can the outcome of a single shared lunch be? Would this be achievable on an online platform? Hard to say, but I don’t think so. It’s those seemingly collateral experiences happening outside of the official conference program that make the on-site conference experience worthwhile. The people I spent late nights on the dance floor with are the ones I still co-author papers with, who accept my graduate students for internships, or who respond to my invitations for review assignments. Our regulatory cell growth model began at a beachside conference venue as a collaborative drawing in the sand made using a stick and seashells to illustrate cellular features. Can scientific connections be maintained through online communication? Certainly. Can true relationships built on trust be created through online channels? I doubt it. Shared evenings spent exploring the local cuisine in a hole-in-the-wall restaurant or practicing for the conference’s traditional acapella singing competition are more conducive for that purpose (Figure 1). There are intangible elements of a connection that don’t develop unless you “break bread” together or walk up the same mountain after the last symposium of the day. Although we should carefully choose which events are truly worth the carbon footprint, we still need in-person academic events. However, before booking a trip, we should reflect on whether the event offers opportunities that cannot be reproduced online. Is the PI’s presence at a recurring conference required each year? Could the grad student attend the event on their own to ensure “visibility” of the lab? Will there be true benefit to our research program or career? Will the venue inspire us? Would participating in a small local workshop be more productive than presenting a talk at a huge international conference? A critical (carbon) cost-benefit analysis should precede all conference travel. The conference that I was meant to attend this June has been rescheduled to next year. In the role as the society’s president, I will ensure that the event is organized with sustainability goals in mind and provides enriching opportunities, particularly for early career researchers. I do hope that it will be worthwhile for those participating. My own participation in earlier iterations of this conference series had played a crucial role in my eventual involvement on the society’s executive board. The feeling of belonging that began the first time I participated as a graduate student, decades ago, directly influenced the amount of time and effort I have put into helping the society function. It is not the talks or posters—elements that can be easily delivered via digital platforms—I remember from that first conference. The lasting impressions stem from shared dinners, midnight swims, and late nights at the pub with those who would eventually become co-authors or provide constructive criticism of my work. It is imperative that academics reduce their carbon footprint. There are many ways to do so, both in private and professional life—all involve changing habits. Changing travel routines requires a departure from an element of academia that many of us have considered an integral part ever since our graduate studies. If all of us travel less often, but more deliberately, we can make a difference without entirely giving up what has made academia special for hundreds of years.

At that stage it was already clear that 2020 would not be a normal year for any of us. When finalizing this issue, we realized that nearly half of the papers relate to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19—a topic that didn’t exist a year ago. This alone speaks volumes about the remarkable efforts of the scientific community, but the depths of compassion and tenacity run deeper. Full-Text PDF Open Archive"
https://openalex.org/W3080104592,"Echocardiography is the basic imaging technique used to determine the odds of maintaining sinus rhythm (SR) following direct current cardioversion (DCCV) for persistent atrial fibrillation (AF). However, most studies are focused on the echocardiographic parameters obtained during SR resulting from successful DCCV. The aim of this study was to assess the value of the echocardiographic parameters measured before DCCV for the prognosis of SR maintenance after DCCV. The study included 146 patients with persistent AF who underwent DCCV. Clinical and echocardiographic data were collected directly before DCCV and, for patients with SR, one month, six months, and 12 months after DCCV. We found that left atrial emptying fraction (LAEF) assessed during atrial fibrillation was significantly larger in the group with SR maintenance after 12 months than in the group with AF recurrence (30.8±8.3 vs. 24.6±10.4%; p<0.001). In multivariable logistic regression analysis with a model containing echocardiographic parameters, LAEF (OR 1.053; 95% CI 1.011–1.096; p = 0.013) and the E/e’mean ratio (OR 0.883; 95% CI 0.788–0.990; p = 0.033) were independent predictors of SR maintenance. Analyzing a model including clinical and echocardiographic variables, only LAEF (OR 1.046; 95% CI 1–1.095; p = 0.049) and beta-blockers used before DCCV (OR 14.694; 95% CI 1.622–133.139; p = 0.017) were independent predictors of SR maintenance after 12 months. Our results indicate that LAEF measured during AF is a significant predictor of SR maintenance in the 12 months following DCCV due to persistent AF. Our findings confirm the recently raised hypothesis about the superiority of echocardiographic parameters assessing mechanical remodeling over parameters assessing structural remodeling of left atrium in predicting sinus rhythm maintenance after electrical cardioversion."

Ipriflavone (IP), therapeutic compound to postmenopausal osteoporosis, has limited estrogenic activity and is accounted as AChE inhibitor. The developing of drug delivery systems to enable drug targeting to specific sites increases the drug therapeutic effect.The aim of the present study was to formulate and evaluate ipriflavone loaded albumin nanoparticles (IP-Np) along with free ipriflavone against lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced neuroinflammation in rats.Neuroinflammation was induced by intra-peritoneal (i.p) injection of LPS (250 μg/kg rat body weight) then treatments were conducted with (1) ipriflavone at two doses 50 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg, (2) IP-Np (5 mg ipriflavone/kg) or (3) IP-Np coated with polysorbate 80 (IP-Np-T80) (5 mg ipriflavone/kg). The alteration of the inflammatory response in male adult Wistar rats' brain hippocampus was investigated by examining associated indices using biochemical and molecular analyses.A significant upsurge in inflammatory mediators and decline in antioxidant status were observed in LPS-induced rats. In one hand, ipriflavone (50 mg/kg), IP-Np and IP-Np-T80 ameliorated LPS induced brain hippocampal inflammation where they depreciated the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β) and enhanced antioxidant status. In another hand, ipriflavone at dose (5 mg/kg) didn't show the same therapeutic effect.The current study provides evidence for the potential neuroprotective effect of ipriflavone (50 mg/kg) against LPS-induced neuroinflammation in rats through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. Moreover, nanoparticles significantly attenuated neuroinflammation in concentration lower than the effective therapeutic dose of free drug ten times."
https://openalex.org/W3080479937,"Introduction Hypertension among HIV positive patients in low- and middle-income countries has got little attention and data on the problem is limited in Ethiopia. Hence, this study aims to determine the magnitude of hypertension and its associated factors among HIV-positive patients receiving care at referral hospitals of Northwest Ethiopia Materials and methods A cross-sectional study design was conducted to determine the burden of hypertension in patients living with HIV receiving care at referral hospitals of Northwest Ethiopia between November 2018 and May 2019. Four hundred seven randomly selected adult patients were included for the study. Using standardized questionnaire, sociodemographic, behavioral and clinical data were collected. Anthropometric parameters, fasting blood sugar as well as lipid profiles were determined. Bivariate and multivariate binary logistic regression analysis was performed. Result A total of 407 study subjects with 98% response rate have been included in this study. The prevalence of hypertension was 14.0% (95% CI: 10.63,17.37). Elementary educational status as compared to no education [AOR (95% CI) 2.75 (1.12,6.75), p< 0.05], moderate monthly income compared to low [AOR (95% CI) 4.27 (2.09,8.73), p<0.01], waist circumference [AOR (95% CI) 4.27 (2.09,8.73), p<0.01], taking concomitant other drug therapy [AOR (95% CI) 5.72 (2.25,14.54), p<0.01] and duration of antiretroviral therapy [AOR (95% CI) 1.12 (1.04,1.20) were significantly associated with hypertension. Conclusion Hypertension is not uncommon in patients living with HIV. Educational status, monthly income, waist circumference, concomitant drug therapy and duration of antiretroviral therapy are linked with hypertension. The finding pinpoints that health care providers should work up on risk factors to reduce the burden of hypertension among the patients."
https://openalex.org/W3080586264,"Allogeneic cultured epidermis (allo-CE) is a cultured keratinocyte sheet manufactured from donor cells and promotes wound healing when used in deep dermal burns, donor sites, and chronic ulcers and serves as a wound dressing. Allo-CE is usually cryopreserved to be ready to use. However, the cryopreservation procedure will damage the cell viability, and the influence of Allo-CE, according to its viability or wound healing process, has not been evaluated sufficiently. In this study, we aimed to prove the influence of keratinocyte viability contained in allo-CEs on wound healing. We prepared CEs with Green’s method using keratinocytes obtained from a polydactyly patient and then prepared four kinds of CEs with different cell viabilities [fresh, cryopreserved, frozen, and FT (freeze and thaw)]. The cell viabilities of fresh, cryopreserved, frozen, and FT CEs were 95.7%, 59.9%, 16.7%, and 0.0%, respectively. The four CEs had homogeneous characteristics, except for small gaps found in the FT sheet by transmission electron microscopy observation. The four CEs were applied on the full-thickness skin defect of diabetic mice (BKS.Cg-Dock 7m +/+ Leprdb/Jcl), and the wound area and neoepithelium length were evaluated on days 4, 7, and 14. As a result, FT CEs without viable cells similarly promoted epithelialization on days 4 and 7 (p<0.05) and accelerated wound closure on day 7 (p<0.01) as fresh CEs compared with the control group. In conclusion, the promoting effect of allo-CE on wound healing does not depend on cell viability. Lyophilized CEs may be a suitable wound dressing with a long storage period at room temperature."
https://openalex.org/W3081312355,"Increased deposition of fibronectin fibrils containing EDA+fibronectin by TGFβ2 is thought to be involved in the reduction of aqueous humor outflow across the trabecular meshwork (TM) of the eye and the elevation in intraocular pressure (IOP) observed in primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). Using a fibronectin-binding peptide called FUD that can disrupt fibronectin fibrillogenesis, we examined if disrupting fibronectin fibrillogenesis would affect IOP in the TGFβ2 BALB/cJ mouse model of ocular hypertension. BALB/cJ mice that had been intravitreally injected with an adenovirus (Ad5) expressing a bioactive TGFβ2226/228 showed a significant increase in IOP after 2 weeks. When 1μM FUD was injected intracamerally into mice 2 weeks post Ad5-TGFβ2 injection, FUD significantly reduced IOP after 2 days. Neither mutated FUD (mFUD) nor PBS had any effect on IOP. Four days after FUD was injected, IOP returned to pre-FUD injection levels. In the absence of TGFβ2, intracameral injection of FUD had no effect on IOP. Western blotting of mouse anterior segments expressing TGFβ2 showed that FUD decreased fibronectin levels 2 days after intracameral injection (p<0.05) but not 7 days compared to eyes injected with PBS. mFUD injection had no significant effect on fibronectin levels at any time point. Immunofluorescence microscopy studies in human TM (HTM) cells showed that treatment with 2ng/ml TGFβ2 increased the amount of EDA+ and EDB+ fibronectin incorporated into fibrils and 2μM FUD decreased both EDA+ and EDB+ fibronectin in fibrils. An on-cell western assay validated this and showed that FUD caused a 67% reduction in deoxycholate insoluble fibronectin fibrils in the presence of TGFβ2. FUD also caused a 43% reduction in fibronectin fibrillogenesis in the absence of TGFβ2 while mFUD had no effect. These studies suggest that targeting the assembly of fibronectin fibrillogenesis may represent a way to control IOP."
https://openalex.org/W3080118954,"The majority of psychoacoustic research investigating sound localization has utilized stationary sources, yet most naturally occurring sounds are in motion, either because the sound source itself moves, or the listener does. In normal hearing (NH) listeners, previous research showed the extent to which sound duration and velocity impact the ability of listeners to detect sound movement. By contrast, little is known about how listeners with hearing impairments perceive moving sounds; the only study to date comparing the performance of NH and bilateral cochlear implant (BiCI) listeners has demonstrated significantly poorer performance on motion detection tasks in BiCI listeners. Cochlear implants, auditory protheses offered to profoundly deaf individuals for access to spoken language, retain the signal envelope (ENV), while discarding temporal fine structure (TFS) of the original acoustic input. As a result, BiCI users do not have access to low-frequency TFS cues, which have previously been shown to be crucial for sound localization in NH listeners. Instead, BiCI listeners seem to rely on ENV cues for sound localization, especially level cues. Given that NH and BiCI listeners differentially utilize ENV and TFS information, the present study aimed to investigate the usefulness of these cues for auditory motion perception. We created acoustic chimaera stimuli, which allowed us to test the relative contributions of ENV and TFS to auditory motion perception. Stimuli were either moving or stationary, presented to NH listeners in free field. The task was to track the perceived sound location. We found that removing low-frequency TFS reduces sensitivity to sound motion, and fluctuating speech envelopes strongly biased the judgment of sounds to be stationary. Our findings yield a possible explanation as to why BiCI users struggle to identify sound motion, and provide a first account of cues important to the functional aspect of auditory motion perception."
https://openalex.org/W3080405253,"Background The association between daily changes in ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and cardiovascular diseases have been well established in mechanistic, epidemiologic and exposure studies. Only a few studies examined the effect of hourly variations in air pollution on triggering cardiovascular events. Whether the current PM2.5 standards can protect vulnerable individuals with chronic cardiovascular diseases remain uncertain. Methods we conducted a time-stratified, case-crossover study to assess the associations between hourly changes in PM2.5 levels and the vascular disease onset in residents of Tainan City, Taiwan, visiting Emergency Room of Chi Mei Medical Center between January 2006 and December 2016. There were 26,749 cases including 10,310 females (38.5%) and 16,439 males (61.5%) identified. The time of emergency visit was identified as the onset for each case and control cases were selected as the same times on other days, on the same day of the week in the same month and year respectively. Residential address was used to identify the ambient air pollution exposure concentrations from the closest station. Conditional logistic regression with the stepwise selection method was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for the association. Results When we only included cases occurring at PM2.5>10 μg/m3 and PM2.5>25 μg/m3, very significant ORs could be observed for 10 μg/m3 increases in PM2.5 at 0 and 1 hour, implying fine particulate exposure could promptly trigger vascular disease events. Moreover, a very clear increase in risk could be observed with cumulative exposure from 0 to 48 hours, especially in those cases where PM2.5>25 μg/m3. Conclusions Our study demonstrated that transient and low concentrations of ambient PM2.5 trigger adult vascular disease events, especially cerebrovascular disease, regardless of age, sex, and exposure timing. Warning and delivery systems should be setup to protect people from these prompt adverse health impacts."
https://openalex.org/W3080742738,"Environmental exposure to arsenite (As3+) has a strong association with the development of human urothelial cancer (UC) and is the 5th most common cancer in men and the 12th most common cancer in women. Muscle invasive urothelial cancer (MIUC) are grouped into basal or luminal molecular subtypes based on their gene expression profile. The basal subtype is more aggressive and can be associated with squamous differentiation, characterized by high expression of keratins (KRT1, 5, 6, 14, and 16) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) within the tumors. The luminal subtype is less aggressive and is predominately characterized by elevated gene expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- gamma (PPARγ) and forkhead box protein A1 (FOXA1). We have previously shown that As3+-transformed urothelial cells (As-T) exhibit a basal subtype of UC expressing genes associated with squamous differentiation. We hypothesized that the molecular subtype of the As-T cells could be altered by inducing the expression of PPARγ and/or inhibiting the proliferation of the cells. Non-transformed and As-T cells were treated with Troglitazone (TG, PPARG agonist, 10 μM), PD153035 (PD, an EGFR inhibitor, 1 μM) or a combination of TG and PD for 3 days. The results obtained demonstrate that treatment of the As-T cells with TG upregulated the expression of PPARγ and FOXA1 whereas treatment with PD decreased the expression of some of the basal keratins. However, a combined treatment of TG and PD resulted in a consistent decrease of several proteins associated with the basal subtype of bladder cancers (KRT1, KRT14, KRT16, P63, and TFAP2A). Our data suggests that activation of PPARγ while inhibiting cell proliferation facilitates the regulation of genes involved in maintaining the luminal subtype of UC. In vivo animal studies are needed to address the efficacy of using PPARγ agonists and/or proliferation inhibitors to reduce tumor grade/stage of MIUC."
https://openalex.org/W3081458041,"The EARLYSTIM Study compared deep brain stimulation (DBS) with best medical treatment (BMT) over 2-years, showing a between-group difference of 8.0 from baseline in favor of DBS in health-related quality of life (HRQoL), measured with the PDQ-39 SI (summary index). This study obtained complementary information about the importance of the change in HRQoL as measured by the PDQ-39, using anchor-based (Patient Global Impression of Change, PGIC) and distribution-based techniques (magnitude of change, effect size, thresholds, distribution of benefit) applied to the EARLYSTIM study data. Anchor-based techniques showed a difference follow-up–baseline for patients who reported “minimal improvement” of -5.8 [-9.9, -1.6] (mean [95%CI]) in the DBS group vs -2.9 [-9.0, 3.1] in the BMT group. As the vast majority (80.8%) of DBS patients reported “much or very much improvement”, this difference was explored for the latter group and amounted to -8.7 for the DBS group and -6.5 in the BMT group. Distribution-based techniques that analyzed the relative change and treatment effect size showed a moderate benefit of the DBS on the HRQoL, whereas a slight worsening was observed in the BMT group. The change in the DBS group (-7.8) was higher than the MIC (Minimally Important Change) estimated value (-5.8 by the anchor; -6.3 by triangulation of thresholds), but not in the BMT (0.2 vs. -3.0 to -5.4, respectively). Almost 90% of the patients in the DBS group declared some improvement (58.3% and 56.7% beyond the estimated MIC), which was significantly different from the BMT group whose proportions were 32.0% and 30.3%, respectively. The number needed to treat to improve ≥1 MIC by DBS vs BMT was 3.8. Change in depression, disability and pain influenced the improvement of the DBS group. DBS improved HRQoL in a high proportion of patients to a significant and moderate degree, at 2 years follow-up."
https://openalex.org/W3080636027,"Defining the relationship between maternal care, sensory development and brain gene expression in neonates is important to understand the impact of environmental challenges during sensitive periods in early life. In this study, we used a selection approach to test the hypothesis that variation in maternal licking and grooming (LG) during the first week of life influences sensory development in Wistar rat pups. We tracked the onset of the auditory brainstem response (ABR), the timing of eye opening (EO), middle ear development with micro-CT X-ray tomography, and used qRT-PCR to monitor changes in gene expression of the hypoxia-sensitive pathway and neurotrophin signaling in pups reared by low-LG or high-LG dams. The results show the first evidence that the transcription of genes involved in the hypoxia-sensitive pathway and neurotrophin signaling is regulated during separate sensitive periods that occur before and after hearing onset, respectively. Although the timing of ABR onset, EO, and the relative mRNA levels of genes involved in the hypoxia-sensitive pathway did not differ between pups from different LG groups, we found statistically significant increases in the relative mRNA levels of four genes involved in neurotrophin signaling in auditory brain regions from pups of different LG backgrounds. These results suggest that sensitivity to hypoxic challenge might be widespread in the auditory system of neonate rats before hearing onset, and that maternal LG may affect the transcription of genes involved in experience-dependent neuroplasticity."
https://openalex.org/W3080748616,"Introduction Hypoglycemia is a true medical emergency, which needs prompt recognition and treatment to prevent organ damage and mortality. Knowledge about the prevention of hypoglycemia is an important step to self-care practice because informed people are more likely to have a better hypoglycemia prevention practice. The aim of this study was to explore hypoglycemia prevention practice and its associated factors among diabetes patients at a university teaching hospital in Ethiopia. Method A cross-sectional study was carried out on a total of 422 systematically selected diabetic patients at the University of Gondar Referral and Teaching Hospital. Data were collected using a pre-tested, structured, and interviewer-administered questionnaire. The collected data was analyzed by SPSS version 20 and associated variables were measured using binary logistic regression and within 95% confidence interval. A p-value <0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Result From the total of 422 diabetic patients, 61.6% were males, 70.1% of them were urban dwellers, 37.9% of them were unable to write and read, and 70.6% of the participants were taking insulin. The majority of respondents had good knowledge of (77.5%) and practice of (93.1%) hypoglycemia prevention. Only good participant knowledge about hypoglycemia prevention was strongly associated with the practice of its prevention (AOR: 2.87 (1.2–6.8), p = 0.01). Conclusion and recommendation Even though diabetic patients with good knowledge of hypoglycemia and its prevention was strongly associated with good prevention practice, there exists a gap in knowledge of hypoglycemia prevention. Hence, we recommend counseling be offered to patients regarding hypoglycemia during their visit to the diabetic clinic. Counseling points such as common clinical symptoms, its negative consequence, as well as remedial options are essential elements for the improvement of their practice on its prevention."
https://openalex.org/W3080798325,"Mutations in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor gene (RYR1) can cause susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia (MH), a potentially lethal genetic condition triggered by volatile anesthetics. MH is associated with hypermetabolism, which has directed research interest into oxidative phosphorylation and muscle bioenergetics. The most common cause of MH in the United Kingdom is the c.7300G>A RYR1 variant, which is present in ∼16% of MH families. Our study focuses on the MH susceptible G2435R-RYR1 knock-in mouse model, which is the murine equivalent of the human c.7300G>A genotype. Using a combination of transcriptomics, protein expression, and functional analysis, we investigated adult muscle fiber bioenergetics in this mouse model. RNA-Seq data showed reduced expression of genes associated with mitochondria and fatty acid oxidation in RYR1 mutants when compared with WT controls. Mitochondrial function was assessed by measuring oxygen consumption rates in permeabilized muscle fibers. Comparisons between WT and homozygous G2435R-RYR1 mitochondria showed a significant increase in complex I-facilitated oxidative phosphorylation in mutant muscle. Furthermore, we observed a gene-dose-specific increase in reactive oxygen species production in G2435R-RYR1 muscle fibers. Collectively, these findings provide evidence of metabolic defects in G2435R-RYR1 knock-in mouse muscle under basal conditions. Differences in metabolic profile could be the result of differential gene expression in metabolic pathways, in conjunction with mitochondrial damage accumulated from chronic exposure to increased oxidative stress."

This two-step labeling method is used to covalently attach commercially available derivatives of biotin, peptide epitope tags, and fluorescent dyes to the terminal phosphates of polyphosphate. Additionally, we report three facile methods for purifying conjugated polyphosphate from excess reactants."
https://openalex.org/W3080538278,"Background and objectives The hydroxylation to 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) occurs in the liver and the impact of liver disease on vitamin D is unclear. This study evaluated the relationship between vitamin D concentrations and hepatic histopathology, seasonality and patient characteristics in well-characterized patients having undergone a liver biopsy. Method 25(OH)D was measured post-hoc in pre-treatment serum from 331 North European patients with chronic HCV genotype 2 or 3 infection (NORDynamIC study). Liver biopsies were scored for fibrosis and inflammation according to the Ishak protocol, and graded for steatosis. Non-invasive markers of hepatic fibrosis as well as baseline viral and host characteristics, including genetic polymorphisms rs2228570, rs7975232, and rs10877012 were also evaluated. Results Mean 25(OH)D concentration was 59 ±23 nmol/L, with 41% having values <50 nmol/L and 6% were <30 nmol/L. 25(OH)D correlated with fibrosis (r = -0.10, p ≤0.05) in univariate but not in multivariate analyses. No association was observed between 25(OH)D and hepatic inflammation, but with steatosis in HCV genotype 2 infected patients. None of the genetic polymorphisms impacted on 25(OH)D levels or fibrosis. 25(OH)D levels were significantly inversely correlated to BMI (r = -0.19, p = 0.001), and was also associated with season and non-Caucasian ethnicity. Conclusion Fibrosis was not independently associated with 25(OH)D concentration and no association was seen with hepatic inflammation, but HCV genotype 2 infected patients with moderate-to-severe steatosis had lower 25(OH)D levels compared to those without steatosis. A high percentage had potential risk of 25(OH)D deficiency, and BMI, seasonality and ethnicity were independently associated with 25(OH)D as previously reported."
https://openalex.org/W3081086929,"While medical advocacy is mandated as a core professional commitment in a growing number of ethical codes and medical training programs, medical advocacy and social justice engagement are regularly subordinated to traditional clinical responsibilities. This study aims to provide insight into factors that motivate clinician engagement and perseverance with medical advocacy, so as to inform attempts by policymakers, leaders and educators to promote advocacy practices in medicine. Furthermore, this study aims to provide an analysis of the role of medical advocates in systems where patients’ rights are perceived to be infringed and consider how we might best support and protect these medical advocates as a profession, by exploring the experiences and perspectives of Australian clinicians defending the health of detained asylum seekers. In this qualitative study thirty-two medical and health professionals advocating on asylum seeker health in immigration detention were interviewed. Transcripts were coded both inductively and deductively from interview question domains and thematically analysed. Findings suggested that respondents’ motivations for advocacy stemmed from deeply intertwined professional and personal ethics. Overall, advocacy responses originated from the union of three integral stimuli: personal ethics, proximity and readiness. We conclude that each of these three integral factors must be addressed in any attempt to foster advocacy within the medical profession. In light of current global trends of increasingly protectionist immigration practices, promoting effective physician advocacy may become essential in ensuring patients’ universal right to health."
https://openalex.org/W3080279805,"Based on the engineering background in which the rock surrounding a wellbore is affected by a thermal shock, impact disturbances from drilling vibration, cyclic heat extraction and high temperature during hydrothermal geothermal energy mining, the environmental conditions in the shaft wall rock are simulated by means of high temperature, cooling, immersing granite in water with different curing temperatures and applying impact loads. Additionally, an experimental study on the mechanical characteristics of circular granite specimens under radial impact loads and in the heat treatment and water curing conditions is carried out. The results show that the inner diameters of the rings, heating temperatures, curing water temperatures and cycle heating times are less affected than other parameters by the impact load-strain curves of circular granite, which can generally be divided into three sections, i.e., the initial straight stage, nonlinear ascent yield stage and post-peak nonlinear decline stage. The factors in the test weaken the capacity of the circular granite to resist the impact, but the sizes of the inner diameters of the rings play a leading role. Dynamic tensile strain is generated in the inner wall along the impact direction during the impact, while compressive strain is produced on the inner wall in the vertical impact loading direction. By analysing the crack propagation and final failure mode of circular granite, it is found that dynamic tensile failures are generated, crack initiation starts from the inner wall along the impact loading direction, and the outer circle in the vertical direction lags behind. The crack starts early and develops quickly on one side of the transmission bar. Finally, the failure criterion is established on the basis of some assumptions and circular-granite deformation failure characteristics, and the parameters, measured by the Brazilian disk test, are reasonably verified via substitution into the failure criterion equation."
https://openalex.org/W3080998533,"Speed skating is a technical endurance sport. Still, little is known about technical changes in junior speed skaters. Therefore, changes in technique throughout a 1500-m time-trial of elite junior speed skaters is investigated to explore differences between sexes, performance levels and competitive seasons. At (inter)national 1500-m competitions, knee and push-off angles were obtained for 120 elite junior speed skaters (56 female, 64 male, age 17.6±1.1 years) per lap at 250m (lap 1), 650m (lap 2), 1050m (lap 3) and 1450m (lap 4). Additionally, 1500m end-times and lap-times were obtained to divide skaters in faster and slower performance groups and to analyze pacing behavior. Fifteen skaters (8 female, 7 male, age 17.3±1.5 years) were measured again after 1.6±0.6 years. (Repeated measures) ANOVAs were used for statistical analyses (p<0.05). ICC, determined in a pilot study, was 0.55 for knee and 0.76 for push-off angles. Elite junior speed skaters increased their knee angles throughout the race (p<0.005), regardless of sex (p = 0.110) or performance level (p = 0.714). Push-off angles increased from lap 1-3 (p<0.001), in which men showed a larger decay than female skaters (p<0.05), this holds for both performance groups (p = 0.103). Faster skaters had smaller knee and push-off angles than slower skaters (p<0.05). Males showed smaller body angles than females (p<0.001). Faster male and female skaters showed a relative slower start and faster lap 3 compared to slower skaters (p<0.05). Development over competitive seasons showed a shift towards smaller push-off angles (p = 0.038) and less decay in knee angles from lap 2-3 (p = 0.026). The present study shows that technique throughout the 1500m deteriorates. Deterioration in technique is regardless of performance level, even with different pacing behaviors. Differences between sexes were found for push-off angles. The longitudinal development suggests changes in technique towards senior level and highlights the importance of studying juniors separate from seniors."
https://openalex.org/W3080858677,"Background The Health Resources and Services Administration’s (HRSA), HIV/AIDS Bureau (HAB) is responsible for leading the nation’s efforts to provide health care, medications, and support services to low-income people living with HIV through the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP). The RWHAP funds and coordinates with cities, states, and local community-based organizations to deliver efficient and effective HIV care, treatment, and support services for over half a million vulnerable people living with HIV (PLWH) and their families in the United States. The annual RWHAP Services Report (RSR) is an important source of information for monitoring RWHAP’s progress towards National HIV/AIDS Strategy goals. Since 2010, HRSA HAB has used the annual client-level RSR data to monitor program-related outcomes, conduct program evaluations, understand service provision, and conduct extensive analysis on disparities in viral suppression and retention in HIV care. HRSA HAB receives annual RSR submissions from RWHAP recipients and sub-recipients. However, the de-identified nature of the data limits HRSA HAB’s ability to expand beyond year-to-year analyses and conduct additional analyses to evaluate outcomes for clients who are seen in multiple years. The current paper describes the development and validation of a method to link RSR client-level records across multiple data years. Methods and findings Using seven RSR reporting years of data (2010 to 2016), we applied a Fellegi-Sunter (F-S) linkage model that used client demographic characteristics and their providers’ geographic locations to calculate matching weights for each record pair based on estimated agreement and disagreement conditional probabilities across RSR years. To validate our methodology, we conducted an internal sample review and external validation to assess the level of accuracy of the linkage, and the extent to which the linked data set corresponds accurately to clinical records of individual clients. The linkage result yielded 70 to 80 percent year-to-year client carry-over rate over seven years of the RSR data; 96 percent linkage ratio from the internal sample review and 79.9 to 94.2 percent of provider network client carry- over rate per year from the external validation. Conclusions This methodology addresses a gap in data analysis capabilities by allowing HRSA HAB to link RWHAP clients across reporting years. Despite weak identifying information and lack of continuity of service reporting, the longitudinal linkage improves HRSA HAB’s ability to evaluate the patterns of viral suppression and monitor service utilization over time for individuals who receive services in multiple years. These analyses will support future analytic activities in understanding the impact and outcomes of the RWHAP, and will assist HRSA HAB in monitoring progress toward meeting National HIV/AIDS Strategy goals. For those looking for ways to assess health services data, the F-S unsupervised method combining weak identifying attributes and geographic proximity offers practical solutions to the problem of linking de-identified information about individuals across multiple years and improving longitudinal research."
https://openalex.org/W3081366306,"Background Diagnosis and treatment for Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD) is inaccessible for many of the 33 million people in low and middle income countries living with this disease. More knowledge about risk factors and pathophysiologic mechanisms involved is needed in order to prevent disease and optimize treatment. This study investigated risk factors in a Nepalese population, with a special focus on Vitamin D deficiency because of its immunomodulatory effects. Methods Ninety-nine patients with confirmed RHD diagnosis and 97 matched, cardiac-healthy controls selected by echocardiography were recruited from hospitals in the Central and Western region of Nepal. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were assessed using dried blood spots and anthropometric values measured to evaluate nutritional status. Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to define association between vitamin D deficiency and RHD. Results The mean age of RHD patients was 31 years (range 9–70) and for healthy controls 32 years (range 9–65), with a 4:1 female to male ratio. Vitamin D levels were lower than expected in both RDH and controls. RHD patients had lower vitamin D levels than controls with a mean s-25(OH)D concentration of 39 nmol/l (range 8.7–89.4) compared with controls 45 nmol/l (range 14.5–86.7) (p-value = 0.02). People with Vitamin D insufficiency had a higher risk (OR = 2.59; 95% CI: 1.04–6.50) of also having RHD compared to people with Vitamin D concentrations >50 nmol/l. Body mass index was significantly lower in RHD patients (22.6; 95% CI, 21.5–23.2) compared to controls (24.2; 95% CI, 23.3–25.1). Conclusion RHD patients in Nepal have lower Vitamin D levels and overall poor nutritional status compared to the non-RHD controls. Longitudinal studies are needed to explore the causality between RHD and vitamin D level. Future research is also recommended among Nepali general population to confirm the low level of vitamin D as reported in our control group."
https://openalex.org/W3080229376,"A major source of epilepsy is Neurocysticercosis (NCC), caused by Taenia solium infection. Solitary cysticercus granuloma (SCG), a sub-group of NCC induced epilepsy, is the most common form of NCC in India. Current diagnostic criteria for SCG epilepsy require brain imaging which may not be available in communities where the disease is endemic. Identification of serum changes and potential biomolecules that could distinguish SCG epilepsy from idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IE), without the initial need for imaging, could assist in disease identification, understanding, and treatment. The objective here was to investigate, using mass spectrometry (MS), sera biomolecule differences between patients with SCG epilepsy or IE to help distinguish these disorders based on physiological differences, to understand underlying phenotypes and mechanisms, and to lay ground work for future therapeutic and biomarker analyses. Sera were obtained from patients with SCG or IE (N = 29 each group). Serum mass peak profiling was performed with electrospray ionization (ESI) MS, and mass peak area means in the two groups were compared using leave one [serum sample] out cross validation (LOOCV). Serum LOOCV analysis identified significant differences between SCG and IE patient groups (p = 10−20), which became non-significant (p = 0.074) when the samples were randomly allocated to the groups and reanalyzed. Tandem MS/MS peptide analysis of serum mass peaks from SCG or IE patients was performed to help identify potential peptide/protein biochemical and phenotypic changes involving these two forms of epilepsy. Bioinformatic analysis of these peptide/protein changes suggested neurological, inflammatory, seizure, blood brain barrier, cognition, ion channel, cell death, and behavior related biochemical systems were being altered in these disease states. This study provides groundwork for aiding in distinguishing SCG and IE patients in minimally invasive, lower-cost manners, for improving understanding of underlying epilepsy mechanisms, and for further identifying discriminatory biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets."
