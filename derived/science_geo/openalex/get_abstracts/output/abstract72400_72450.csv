The properties of this substance are described; its structure was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectros-copy."

https://openalex.org/W2081967216,"EVIDENCE for a causal relationship between blooms of the Florida red tide organism, Gymnodinium breve Davis, and mass mortalities of marine animals seems well established1. In most cases the mortalities can be ascribed to a toxin which has been isolated from a bloom, as well as from laboratory cultures of G. breve1,2. Other studies have been concerned with physiological and some chemical properties of the toxin2–6."

Comparison of its specific properties with enzyme isolated from liver indicates many similarities including size. Examination of the reversible reaction catalyzed by the erythrocyte enzyme from both forward and reverse directions revealed a highly selective product inhibition by UDP-glucose. Since a dual enzyme function involving both regulation and synthesis of UDP-glucose was implied, additional UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylases were examined in relation to their product inhibition characteristics for comparative purposes. The product inhibition studies were extended and applied in distinguishing the kinetic mechanism of erythrocyte UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase. From the product inhibition patterns and initial velocity studies an ordered Bi-Bi reaction mechanism was indicated in which nucleotide adds first as substrate to the enzyme and is last to be released. Michaelis constants for each of the substrates and dissociation (inhibition) constants for substrates combining with free enzyme were also determined."

https://openalex.org/W1970759416,"THE hydrated electron, e−aq, and the OH radical are the principal products of the radiation induced decomposition of liquid water; with gamma rays the 100 eV yields1 of these reactive intermediates are closely approximated by the values Ge−aq ≃ GOH ≃ 2.6. While certain classes of organic compounds are known to react quantitatively with both e−aq and OH in oxygen-free solution, the observed yield for net destruction of such solutes may be quite low compared with the G value for water decomposition. In interpreting the radiation chemistry of such systems the concept of a reconstitution or back-reaction must be invoked."

Hematocrit values were not reduced and erythrocyte life-spans were not shortened by the antioxidants. The reticulocytosis is attributed to delayed loss of reticular material from the maturing erythrocytes. components."
https://openalex.org/W2005723406,"As well as its ability to induce cancer in various tissues, the polycyclic hydrocarbon 3-methylcholanthrene (MCA) is capable of affecting the activity of certain endocrine glands1–3 and altering the metabolism of several hormones4–7. Indirect evidence from several sources6,8–12 indicates that, in various experimental conditions, MCA may be capable of inhibiting, potentiating or mimicking the activity of certain steroid hormones. We have conducted preliminary experiments aimed at testing more rigorously the alleged steroidal activity of MCA. In the experiment reported here, MCA was tested for oestrogenic (uterotrophic) activity in a four point assay using oestrone as the reference standard."
https://openalex.org/W2018588263,"EVANS et al.1 have shown that a “late labelling” X chromosome occurs in normal somatic cells of the mouse. Using female mice, heterozygous for the Cattanach translocation, in which an autosomal segment is inserted into an X chromosome making the translocated chromosome (Xt) recognizable as the longest member of the complement2, they showed that this abnormally long chromosome was “hot” in about half the cells that contained a late-labelling chromosome. In the remaining cells, the hot chromosome was always one of the long chromosomes and was presumed to be the Xn chromosome. These observations were interpreted as supporting evidence for the postulate of random inactivation3 of the maternal and paternal X chromosomes."
