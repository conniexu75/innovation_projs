https://openalex.org/W4311551454,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are ineffective against solid tumors with immunosuppressive microenvironments. To overcome suppression, we engineered circuits in which tumor-specific synNotch receptors locally induce production of the cytokine IL-2. These circuits potently enhance CAR T cell infiltration and clearance of immune-excluded tumors, without systemic toxicity. The most effective IL-2 induction circuit acts in an autocrine and T cell receptor (TCR)- or CAR-independent manner, bypassing suppression mechanisms including consumption of IL-2 or inhibition of TCR signaling. These engineered cells establish a foothold in the target tumors, with synthetic Notch–induced IL-2 production enabling initiation of CAR-mediated T cell expansion and cell killing. Thus, it is possible to reconstitute synthetic T cell circuits that activate the outputs ultimately required for an antitumor response, but in a manner that evades key points of tumor suppression."
https://openalex.org/W4311551459,"Synthetic gene circuits that precisely control human cell function could expand the capabilities of gene- and cell-based therapies. However, platforms for developing circuits in primary human cells that drive robust functional changes in vivo and have compositions suitable for clinical use are lacking. Here, we developed synthetic zinc finger transcription regulators (synZiFTRs), which are compact and based largely on human-derived proteins. As a proof of principle, we engineered gene switches and circuits that allow precise, user-defined control over therapeutically relevant genes in primary T cells using orthogonal, US Food and Drug Administration-approved small-molecule inducers. Our circuits can instruct T cells to sequentially activate multiple cellular programs such as proliferation and antitumor activity to drive synergistic therapeutic responses. This platform should accelerate the development and clinical translation of synthetic gene circuits in diverse human cell types and contexts."
https://openalex.org/W4311556607,"The World Health Organization declared mpox (or monkeypox) a public health emergency of international concern in July 2022, and prophylactic and therapeutic measures are in urgent need. The monkeypox virus (MPXV) has its own DNA polymerase F8, together with the processive cofactors A22 and E4, constituting the polymerase holoenzyme for genome replication. Here, we determined the holoenzyme structure in complex with DNA using cryo–electron microscopy at the global resolution of ~2.8 angstroms. The holoenzyme possesses an architecture that suggests a “forward sliding clamp” processivity mechanism for viral DNA replication. MPXV polymerase has a DNA binding mode similar to that of other B-family DNA polymerases from different species. These findings reveal the mechanism of the MPXV genome replication and may guide the development of anti-poxvirus drugs."
https://openalex.org/W4311551615,"Electronic and optical excitations in two-dimensional systems are distinctly sensitive to the presence of a moiré superlattice. We used cryogenic transmission electron microscopy and spectroscopy to simultaneously image the structural reconstruction and associated localization of the lowest-energy intralayer exciton in a rotationally aligned WS 2 -WSe 2 moiré superlattice. In conjunction with optical spectroscopy and ab initio calculations, we determined that the exciton center-of-mass wave function is confined to a radius of approximately 2 nanometers around the highest-energy stacking site in the moiré unit cell. Our results provide direct evidence that atomic reconstructions lead to the strongly confining moiré potentials and that engineering strain at the nanoscale will enable new types of excitonic lattices."
https://openalex.org/W4311551606,"Mixed-matrix membranes (MMMs) have been investigated to render energy-intensive separations more efficiently by combining the selectivity and permeability performance, robustness, and nonaging properties of the filler with the easy processing, handling, and scaling up of the polymer. However, truly combining all in one single material has proven very challenging. In this work, we filled a commercial polyimide with ultrahigh loadings of a high–aspect ratio, CO 2 -philic Na-SSZ-39 zeolite with a three-dimensional channel system that precisely separates gas molecules. By carefully designing both zeolite and MMM synthesis, we created a gas-percolation highway across a flexible and aging-resistant (more than 1 year) membrane. The combination of a CO 2 -CH 4 mixed-gas selectivity of ~423 and a CO 2 permeability of ~8300 Barrer outperformed all existing polymer-based membranes and even most zeolite-only membranes."
https://openalex.org/W4311559145,"Advancing electronics to interact with tissue necessitates meeting material constraints in electrochemical, electrical, and mechanical domains simultaneously. Clinical bioelectrodes with established electrochemical functionalities are rigid and mechanically mismatched with tissue. Whereas conductive materials with tissue-like softness and stretchability are demonstrated, when applied to electrochemically probe tissue, their performance is distorted by strain and corrosion. We devise a layered architectural composite design that couples strain-induced cracked films with a strain-isolated out-of-plane conductive pathway and in-plane nanowire networks to eliminate strain effects on device electrochemical performance. Accordingly, we developed a library of stretchable, highly conductive, and strain-insensitive bioelectrodes featuring clinically established brittle interfacial materials (iridium-oxide, gold, platinum, and carbon). We paired these bioelectrodes with different electrochemical probing methods (amperometry, voltammetry, and potentiometry) and demonstrated strain-insensitive sensing of multiple biomarkers and in vivo neuromodulation."
https://openalex.org/W4311601673,"Aliphatic allylic amines are found in a great variety of complex and biorelevant molecules. The direct allylic C–H amination of alkenes serves as the most straightforward method toward these motifs. However, use of widely available internal alkenes with aliphatic amines in this transformation remains a synthetic challenge. In particular, palladium catalysis faces the twin challenges of inefficient coordination of Pd(II) to internal alkenes but excessively tight and therefore inhibitory coordination of Pd(II) by basic aliphatic amines. We report a general solution to these problems. The developed protocol, in contrast to a classical Pd(II/0) scenario, operates through a blue light–induced Pd(0/I/II) manifold with mild aryl bromide oxidant. This open-shell approach also enables enantio- and diastereoselective allylic C–H amination."
https://openalex.org/W4311601716,"Peroxisomes are ubiquitous organelles whose dysfunction causes fatal human diseases. Most peroxisomal proteins are imported from the cytosol in a folded state by the soluble receptor PEX5. How folded cargo crosses the membrane is unknown. Here, we show that peroxisomal import is similar to nuclear transport. The peroxisomal membrane protein PEX13 contains a conserved tyrosine (Y)– and glycine (G)–rich YG domain, which forms a selective phase resembling that formed by phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeats within nuclear pores. PEX13 resides in the membrane in two orientations that oligomerize and suspend the YG meshwork within the lipid bilayer. Purified YG domains form hydrogels into which PEX5 selectively partitions, by using conserved aromatic amino acid motifs, bringing cargo along. The YG meshwork thus forms an aqueous conduit through which PEX5 delivers folded proteins into peroxisomes."

The synthesized series of azomethines exhibited promising efficacy against liver cancer cell line. Screening of the synthesized series identified compound 7d with the least cell viability value (11.71 ± 0.39%) as the most potent anticancer agent in contrast to the reference drug acefylline (cell viability = 80 ± 3.87%). In this study, the potentials of the novel agents ( 7a-k ) to inhibit liver cancer proteins were assessed. Subsequently, the structure-activity relationship of the potential drug candidates was assessed via ADME/T molecular screening. The cytotoxic potential of these derivatives was also investigated by hemolysis and thrombolysis. Their hemolytic and thrombolytic studies showed that all of these drugs had very low cytotoxicity and moderate clot lysis activity. Compound 7g (0.26% hemolysis) and 7k (52.1% clot lysis) were the least toxic and moderate thrombolytic agents respectively."
https://openalex.org/W4311664787,"Abstract Although we understand how serotonin receptors function at the single-cell level, what role different serotonin receptors play in regulating brain-wide activity and, in turn, human behavior, remains unknown. Here, we developed transcriptomic–neuroimaging mapping to characterize brain-wide functional signatures associated with specific serotonin receptors: serotonin receptor networks (SRNs). Probing SRNs with optogenetics–functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and pharmacology in mice, we show that activation of dorsal raphe serotonin neurons differentially modulates the amplitude and functional connectivity of different SRNs, showing that receptors’ spatial distributions can confer specificity not only at the local, but also at the brain-wide, network level. In humans, using resting-state functional MRI, SRNs replicate established divisions of serotonin effects on impulsivity and negative biases. These results provide compelling evidence that heterogeneous brain-wide distributions of different serotonin receptor types may underpin behaviorally distinct modes of serotonin regulation. This suggests that serotonin neurons may regulate multiple aspects of human behavior via modulation of large-scale receptor networks."
https://openalex.org/W4311551625,"After decades of debate, biologists today largely agree that most speciation events require an allopatric phase (that is, geographic separation), but the role of adaptive ecological divergence during this critical period is still unknown. Here, we show that relatively few allopatric pairs of birds, mammals, or amphibians exhibit trait differences consistent with models of divergent adaptation in each of many ecologically relevant traits. By fitting new evolutionary models to numerous sets of sister-pair trait differences, we find that speciating and recently speciated allopatric taxa seem to overwhelmingly evolve under similar rather than divergent macro–selective pressures. This contradicts the classical view of divergent adaptation as a prominent driver of the early stages of speciation and helps synthesize two historical controversies regarding the ecology and geography of species formation."
https://openalex.org/W4311668626,"With modern treatments for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (EF), indicative of impaired cardiac systolic function, patients may exhibit an increase in EF. Limited data are available regarding the clinical management of this growing population, categorized as heart failure with improved EF (HFimpEF), which has a high event rate and has been excluded from virtually all prior heart failure outcomes trials. In a prespecified analysis of the DELIVER trial ( NCT03619213 ), of a total of 6,263 participants with symptomatic heart failure and a left ventricular EF >40%, 1,151 (18%) had HFimpEF, defined as patients whose EF improved from ≤40% to >40%. Participants were randomized to 10 mg dapagliflozin or placebo daily and the primary outcome of the trial was a composite of cardiovascular death or worsening heart failure (heart failure hospitalization or an urgent heart failure visit). Participants with HFimpEF had similar event rates to those with an EF consistently >40%. In participants with HFimpEF, dapagliflozin reduced the primary composite outcome (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.56-0.97), first worsening heart failure events (HR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.61-1.14), cardiovascular death (HR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.41-0.96) and total worsening heart failure events (rate ratio = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.50-0.94) to a similar extent as for individuals with an EF consistently >40%. These data suggest that patients with HFimpEF who are symptomatic may benefit from the addition of a sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor to previously instituted guideline-directed medical therapy to further reduce morbidity and mortality."
https://openalex.org/W4311551607,"Cell death induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) can be beneficial during infection by helping to mount proper immune responses. However, TNF-induced death can also drive a variety of inflammatory pathologies. Protectives brakes, or cell-death checkpoints, normally repress TNF cytotoxicity to protect the organism from its potential detrimental consequences. Thus, although TNF can kill, this only occurs when one of the checkpoints is inactivated. Here, we describe a checkpoint that prevents apoptosis through the detoxification of the cytotoxic complex IIa that forms upon TNF sensing. We found that autophagy-related 9A (ATG9A) and 200kD FAK family kinase-interacting protein (FIP200) promote the degradation of this complex through a light chain 3 (LC3)-independent lysosomal targeting pathway. This detoxification mechanism was found to counteract TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1)-mediated embryonic lethality and inflammatory skin disease in mouse models."

https://openalex.org/W4311551508,"Internal Combustion (IC) engines are prevalent in the process sector, and maintaining sufficient Air-Fuel Ratio (AFR) regulation in their fuel system is crucial for enhanced engine performance, fuel economy, and environmental safety. Faults in the AFR system's sensors cause the engine to shut down, hence, fault tolerance is essential. In order to avoid engine shutdown, this paper offers a novel Active Fault-Tolerant Control System (AFTCS) for air-fuel ratio control of an Internal Combustion (IC) engine in a process plant. In the Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) unit, the proposed AFTCS uses a nonlinear regression-based observer model for analytical redundancy. The suggested system was simulated in the MATLAB / Simulink environment. The proposed system was tested at two different speeds (300 r/min and 600 r/min) and the results show that the system's response is within the acceptable bound without compromising the stability. The findings also demonstrate the higher fault tolerance capability for sensor defects of the AFR control system, particularly for the MAP sensor (at 300 r/min) in terms of reduced oscillatory response in comparison to the current literature. Compared to the linear regression-based and Genetic Algorithm (GA) based model, the nonlinear regression-based model results in a more accurate estimation of the faulty sensors. The proposed model is also efficient in terms of computation power and response time."

https://openalex.org/W4311551618,"Background Catheter ablation for asymptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) remains controversial. The aim of the present study was to explore the prognostic impact of catheter ablation in asymptomatic AF patients. Methods We performed a post-hoc analysis of 537 risk-matched pairs of AF patients receiving first-time catheter ablation or conservative management. The primary outcome measure was a composite of cardiovascular death, heart failure (HF) hospitalization, ischemic stroke, or major bleeding. The study patients were divided into asymptomatic and symptomatic patients, and were further divided according to the presence or absence of previous AF-related complications (ischemic stroke or HF hospitalization). Results Most baseline characteristics were well balanced between the catheter ablation versus conservative management groups. The median follow-up period was 5.3 years. Catheter ablation as compared to conservative management was associated with significantly lower incidence of the primary outcome measure in the asymptomatic AF patients (14.7% versus 25.4% at 8-year, log-rank P = 0.008). However, the advantage of catheter ablation was significant only in the high-risk subset of patients with the previous AF-related complications (19.2% versus 55.6% at 8-year, log-rank P = 0.006), but not in those without (13.9% and 17.3%, P = 0.08). On the other hand, among the symptomatic AF patients, catheter ablation was associated with significantly lower incidence of the primary outcome measure regardless of the previous AF-related complications. Conclusions In the post-hoc analysis of the matched AF cohort, catheter ablation as compared with conservative management was associated with better long-term clinical outcomes among asymptomatic AF patients only when the previous AF-related complications were present."

The relation between inflammatory activation in the post-operative period and the long-term prognosis was already postulated. The possible predictive role of preoperative inflammatory indexes after the off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting technique on long term survival was the aim of the study. Study population included 171 patients with a median age of 64 years (59–64) operated on using off-pump technique between January and December 2014. Patients enrolled in the current study were followed-up for 8 years. We conducted a multivariable analysis of pre-operative and post-operative inflammatory markers based on analysis of the whole blood count. The overall survival rate was 80% for the total follow-up period, while 34 deaths were reported (30-days mortality rate of 1%). In the multivariable analysis, a pre-operative value of systemic inflammatory response index (SIRI) &gt;1.27 (HR = 6.16, 95% CI 2.17–17.48, p = 0.012) revealed a prognostic value for long-term mortality assessment after off-pump surgery. Preoperative inflammatory activation evaluated by systemic inflammatory reaction index (SIRI) possess a prognostic value for patients with complex coronary artery disease. The SIRI value above 1.27 indicates a worse late prognosis after off-pump coronary artery bypass (AUC = 0.682, p&lt;0.001)."
https://openalex.org/W4311551484,"Rural revitalization aims to consolidate the achievements of poverty alleviation. Furthermore, enhancing the sustainable poverty alleviation ability of farmers in poverty-stricken areas is a critical concern. Using samples of farmers in four regions of the Yunnan province in China, multidimensional poverty and sustainable poverty alleviation ability indexes were constructed. Furthermore, a multidimensional poverty double boundary method (A-F method) was used to identify multidimensional poverty, and binary logistic function in SPSS was used to perform a regression analysis between multidimensional poverty and sustainable poverty alleviation ability. Results showed that as the poverty dimension increased, poverty incidence rate in the four regions decreased, with middle poverty incidence rate being the highest. Ability poverty was then identified as the major type of poverty in the sample, with the group of poor farmers with a high dimension of poverty being the most affected. Therefore, based on the ability structure of sustainable farmers out of poverty, we analyze the prominent problem of the ability construction of sustainable poverty reduction and propose a path for promoting sustainable poverty reduction ability. Hence, we will effectively link poverty alleviation with rural vitalization."
https://openalex.org/W4311551756,"Amazonian mammal diversity is exceptionally high, yet new taxonomic discoveries continue to be made and many questions remain for understanding its diversification through time and space. Here we investigate the diversification of spiny rats in the genus Makalata, whose species are strongly associated with seasonally flooded forests, watercourses and flooded islands. We use a biogeographical approach based on a mitochondrial cytochrome b gene through divergence time estimation and reconstruction of ancestral areas and events. Our findings indicate an ancient origin of Makalata for the Guiana Shield and Eastern Amazonia as ancestral area. A first cladogenetic event led to a phylogeographic break into two broader clades of Makalata through dispersal, implying a pattern of western/Eastern Amazonian clades coinciding with the Purus Arch (middle Miocene). Most of subclades we infer originated between the late Pliocene to the early Pleistocene, with few recent exceptions in the early Pliocene through dispersal and vicariant events. The hypothesis of rivers as dispersal barriers is not corroborated for Makalata, as expected for mammalian species associated with seasonally flooded environments. We identify two key events for the expansion and diversification of Makalata species: the presence of geologically stable areas in the Guiana and Brazilian shields and the transition from lacustrine conditions in western Amazonia (Acre system) to a river system, with the establishment of the Amazon River transcontinental system and its tributaries. Our results are congruent with older geological scenarios for the Amazon basin formation (Miocene), but we do not discard the influence of recent dynamics on some speciation events and, mainly, on phylogeographic structuring processes."
https://openalex.org/W4311552106,"Stem cells must balance proliferation and quiescence, with excess proliferation favoring tumor formation, and premature quiescence preventing proper organogenesis. Drosophila brain neuroblasts are a model for investigating neural stem cell entry and exit from quiescence. Neuroblasts begin proliferating during embryogenesis, enter quiescence prior to larval hatching, and resume proliferation 12-30h after larval hatching. Here we focus on the mechanism used to exit quiescence, focusing on ""type II"" neuroblasts. There are 16 type II neuroblasts in the brain, and they undergo the same cycle of embryonic proliferation, quiescence, and proliferation as do most other brain neuroblasts. We focus on type II neuroblasts due to their similar lineage as outer radial glia in primates (both have extended lineages with intermediate neural progenitors), and because of the availability of specific markers for type II neuroblasts and their progeny. Here we characterize the role of Insulin-like growth factor II mRNA-binding protein (Imp) in type II neuroblast proliferation and quiescence. Imp has previously been shown to promote proliferation in type II neuroblasts, in part by acting antagonistically to another RNA-binding protein called Syncrip (Syp). Here we show that reducing Imp levels delays exit from quiescence in type II neuroblasts, acting independently of Syp, with Syp levels remaining low in both quiescent and newly proliferating type II neuroblasts. We conclude that Imp promotes exit from quiescence, a function closely related to its known role in promoting neuroblast proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W4311601713,"Grassland is the largest terrestrial ecosystem in the Yellow River Basin and an important ecological barrier in the basin. Scientific and accurate estimation of the service value of grassland ecosystems in the Yellow River Basin is of great significance for maintaining the ecological security of the Yellow River Basin. This study was based on Constanza, a method based on the correction of natural grassland ecosystem service value in the Yellow River Basin. This method considers grassland biomass, estimates the ecological service value of each type of grassland item by item, and analyzes their spatial distribution and topographic gradient differentiation characteristics. The results showed that the unit price of soil conservation services provided by the grassland ecosystem in the Yellow River Basin has an advantage (6.2 times) which is the lowest unit price of raw materials. The total value of grassland ecosystem services in the Yellow River Basin is 100.82 × 10 10 Yuan. Among the various services, the adjustment service has the largest value, accounting for 50.56% of the total value, while the sum of the supply service, support service and cultural service amounted to 49.44%. The high-value areas of grassland ecosystem services are mainly distributed in the upper and lower reaches of the basin, as the low-value areas are located in the Ningxia and Hetao Plains and most parts of the Loess Plateau. The ESV per unit area of grassland in the Yellow River Basin showed a decreasing to increasing trend with the increase in elevation and topographic relief, as the ESV continued to increase with slope increase."
https://openalex.org/W4311601855,"The overexpression of α 2 δ-1 is related to the development and degree of malignancy of diverse types of cancer. This protein is an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated Ca 2+ (Ca V ) channels, whose expression favors the trafficking of the main pore-forming subunit of the channel complex (α 1 ) to the plasma membrane, thereby generating an increase in Ca 2+ entry. Interestingly, TLR-4, a protein belonging to the family of toll-like receptors that participate in the inflammatory response and the transcription factor Sp1, have been linked to the progression of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Therefore, this report aimed to evaluate the role of the α 2 δ-1 subunit in the progression of GBM and investigate whether Sp1 regulates its expression after the activation of TLR-4. To this end, the expression of α 2 δ-1, TLR-4, and Sp1 was assessed in the U87 human glioblastoma cell line, and proliferation and migration assays were conducted using different agonists and antagonists. The actions of α 2 δ-1 were also investigated using overexpression and knockdown strategies. Initial luciferase assays and Western blot analyses showed that the activation of TLR-4 favors the transcription and expression of α 2 δ-1, which promoted the proliferation and migration of the U87 cells. Consistent with this, overexpression of α 2 δ-1, Sp1, and TLR-4 increased cell proliferation and migration, while their knockdown with specific siRNAs abrogated these actions. Our data also suggest that TLR-4-mediated regulation of α 2 δ-1 expression occurs through the NF-kB signaling pathway. Together, these findings strongly suggest that the activation of TLR-4 increases the expression of α 2 δ-1 in U87 cells, favoring their proliferative and migratory potential, which might eventually provide a theoretical basis to examine novel biomarkers and molecular targets for the diagnosis and treatment of GBM."
https://openalex.org/W4311601992,"Brucellosis is one of the most neglected zoonotic diseases in the world. It affects all age groups and both sexes. A cross-sectional study was conducted from December 2019 to May 2020 to estimate the seroprevalence and assess the potential risk factors of brucellosis among dairy cow owners and dairy farmworkers, and assess their knowledge, attitudes, and practices in selected sites in the central highlands of Oromia, Ethiopia. A structured interview question was administered to 284 respondents, and only 166 of them volunteered to give a blood sample. Most respondents had limited knowledge of brucellosis (93.3%), zoonotic diseases transmitted by handling animal delivery (88%), and consuming raw milk and other animal products (90.0%). Accordingly, 149 blood samples from animal owners and 17 farmworkers were collected for serological testing. The serum samples collected were initially screened using the Rose Bengal Plate test, and the Complement Fixation test was used as a confirmatory test. The overall seroprevalence of zoonotic brucellosis was 1.2% (95%CI: 0.32–4.27). There was a statistically significant association of human brucellosis with human housing (OR = 1.8, p = 0.002), contact with aborted fetus (OR = 21.19, p = 0.017), drinking raw milk from non-aborted (OR = 24.99, p = 0.012), aborted (OR = 5.72, 0.019), and retained fetal membrane (OR = 4.22, p = 0.029) cows. In conclusion, the present study revealed that the seroprevalence of brucellosis in the study area was low. Public awareness among animal owners, farm and animal health workers on the transmission and health hazards of brucellosis needs to be addressed through community training. Implementing one health approach between veterinary and medical health professionals must be strengthened."
https://openalex.org/W4311602023,"There is paucity of culturally adapted tools for assessing depression and anxiety in children and adolescents in low-and middle-income countries. This hinders early detection, provision of appropriate and culturally acceptable interventions. In a partnership with the University of Nairobi, Nairobi County, Kenyatta National Hospital, and UNICEF, a rapid cultural adaptation of three adolescent mental health scales was done, i.e., Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and additional scales in the UNICEF mental health module for adolescents.Using a qualitative approach, we explored adolescent participants' views on cultural acceptability, comprehensibility, relevance, and completeness of specific items in these tools through an adolescent-centered approach to understand their psychosocial needs, focusing on gender and age-differentiated nuances around expression of distress. Forty-two adolescents and 20 caregivers participated in the study carried out in two primary care centers where we conducted cognitive interviews and focused group discussions assessing mental health knowledge, literacy, access to services, community, and family-level stigma.We reflect on process and findings of adaptations of the tools, including systematic identification of words adolescents did not understand in English and Kiswahili translations of these scales. Some translated words could not be understood and were not used in routine conversations. Response options were changed to increase comprehensibility; some statements were qualified by adding extra words to avoid ambiguity. Participants suggested alternative words that replaced difficult ones and arrived at culturally adapted tools.Study noted difficult words, phrases, dynamics in understanding words translated from one language to another, and differences in comprehension in adolescents ages 10-19 years. There is a critical need to consider cultural adaptation of depression and anxiety tools for adolescents.Results informed a set of culturally adapted scales. The process was community-driven and adhered to the principles of cultural adaptation for assessment tools."
https://openalex.org/W4311602065,"To explore the correlation between UGT1A1 variant and neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in Chinese Uighur and Han populations. We conducted this study in Urumqi, China. Umbilical cord blood specimens and clinical information of term infants born in the studied center were collected. Variation status of UGT1A1 was determined by direct sequencing or capillary electrophoresis analysis. 102 Uighur and 99 Han normal term neonates, together with 19 hospitalized term newborns (10 Uighur and 9 Han) due to significant hyperbilirubinemia were enrolled into the final analysis. The incidence of neonates with high-risk transcutaneous bilirubin level (TCB) were much higher in Han newborns than in Uighur newborns( P = 0.01). Also, there was statistically significant difference in (TA) 7 promoter mutation of UGT1A1 between Han and Uighur group(χ2 = 4.675, P = 0.03). Furthermore, exon mutation (c.211 and /or c.1091) in UGT1A1 gene was significantly associated with increased TCB level (OR adj = 1.41, 95%CI: 0.25–2.51, P = 0.002) and higher risk of hyperbilirubinemia in both Han and Uighur infants after adjusted for covariates (OR adj = 2.21, 95%CI: 1.09–4.49, P = 0.03). In conclusion, UGT1A1 promoter polymorphism seem to be an important genetic modulator of plasma bilirubin level and neonatal hyperbilirubinemia risk within ethnic groups. Genetic assessment of UGT1A1 coding variants may be useful for clinical diagnosis of neonatal jaundice."
https://openalex.org/W4311651314,"Background The amplification of GTP cyclohydrolase 1 ( pfgch1 ) in Plasmodium falciparum has been linked to the upregulation of the pfdhfr and pfdhps genes associated with resistance to the antimalarial drug sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. During the 1990s and 2000s, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine was withdrawn from use as first-line treatment in southeast Asia due to clinical drug resistance. This study assessed the temporal and geographic changes in the prevalence of pfdhfr and pfdhps gene mutations and pfgch1 amplification a decade after sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine had no longer been widely used. Methods A total of 536 P . falciparum isolates collected from clinical trials in Thailand, Cambodia, and Lao PDR between 2008 and 2018 were assayed. Single nucleotide polymorphisms of the pfdhfr and pfdhps genes were analyzed using nested PCR and Sanger sequencing. Gene copy number variations of pfgch 1 were investigated using real-time polymerase chain reaction assay. Results Sequences of the pfdhfr and pfdhps genes were obtained from 96% (517/536) and 91% (486/536) of the samples, respectively. There were 59 distinct haplotypes, including single to octuple mutations. The two major haplotypes observed included IRN I- AGE AA (25%) and IRNL -S G K G A (19%). The sextuple mutation IRNL -S G K G A increased markedly over time in several study sites, including Pailin, Preah Vihear, Ratanakiri, and Ubon Ratchathani, whereas IRNI - AGE AA decreased over time in Preah Vihear, Champasak, and Ubon Ratchathani. Octuple mutations were first observed in west Cambodia in 2011 and subsequently in northeast Cambodia, as well as in southern Laos by 2018. Amplification of the pfgch1 gene increased over time across the region, particularly in northeast Thailand close to the border with Laos and Cambodia. Conclusion Despite the fact that SP therapy was discontinued in Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos decades ago, parasites retained the pfdhfr and pfdhps mutations. Numerous haplotypes were found to be prevalent among the parasites. Frequent monitoring of pfdhfr and pfdhps in these areas is required due to the relatively rapid evolution of mutation patterns."

In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effect of ibrutinib, an orally bioavailable BTK inhibitor in the pathogenesis of Graves' orbitopathy (GO) in in vitro model.Expression of BTK in orbital tissues from GO and normal control subjects were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Primary cultured orbital fibroblasts from each subject were exposed to ibrutinib and stimulated with interleukin (IL)-1β or insulin like growth factor (IGF)-1. Production of inflammatory cytokines was evaluated by real time PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The downstream transcription factors were also determined by western blot assays.The expression of BTK in GO tissues were significantly higher than in healthy controls. After stimulation of GO orbital fibroblasts with IL-1β or IGF-1, BTK mRNA and phosphorylated (p)- BTK protein expression was also enhanced. Ibrutinib reduced the expression of BTK mRNA and proteins of p-BTK, and inhibited the IL-1β- and IGF-1-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-6, IL-8 and COX-2 in both GO and normal cells. Ibrutinib also significantly attenuated phosphorylation of Akt, p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B-cells (NF-κB) in IL-1β stimulated GO cells and Akt, JNK, and NF-κB in IL-1ß stimulated normal cells.BTK expression is enhanced in GO tissue and orbital fibroblasts. Ibrutinib, a BTK inhibitor suppresses proinflammatory cytokine production as well as phosphorylation of Akt and NF-κB protein. Our results suggest the potential role of BTK in GO inflammatory pathogenesis and possibility of a novel therapeutic target of GO."
https://openalex.org/W4311551263,"c-Rel, a member of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) family, is preferentially expressed by immune cells and is known to regulate inflammation, autoimmune diseases and cancer. However, there is a lack of therapeutic intervention to specifically inhibit c-Rel in immune cells. Recent success with Pfizer and Moderna mRNA lipid-encapsulated vaccines as well as FDA approved medicines based on siRNA prompted us to test a lipid nanoparticle-based strategy to silence c-Rel in immune cells. Specifically, we encapsulated c-Rel-targeting siRNA into distearoyl-phosphatidylserine (DSPS)-containing nanoparticles. DSPS is a saturated phospholipid that serves as the “eat-me” signal for professional phagocytes such as macrophages and neutrophils of the immune system. We demonstrated here that incorporation of DSPS in liposome nanoparticles (LNP) improved their uptake by immune cells. LNP containing high concentrations of DSPS were highly effective to transfect not only macrophages and neutrophils, but also lymphocytes, with limited toxicity to cells. However, LNP containing low concentrations of DSPS were more effective to transfect myeloid cells than lymphoid cells. Importantly, DSPS-LNP loaded with a c-Rel siRNA were highly effective to inhibit c-Rel expression in several professional phagocytes tested, which lasted for several days. Taken together, our results suggest that DSPS-LNP armed with c-Rel siRNA could be exploited to target immune cells to limit the development of inflammatory diseases or cancer caused by c-Rel upregulation. In addition, this newly developed DSPS-LNP system may be further tested to encapsulate and deliver other small molecule drugs to immune cells, especially macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes for the treatment of diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4311551350,"Clustering analysis’ primary purpose is to divide a dataset into a finite number of segments based on the similarities between items. In recent years, a significant amount of study has focused on the spatio-temporal aspects of clustering. However, clusters are no longer regarded as static objects since changes influence them in the underlying population. This paper describes an R package implementing the MONIC framework for tracing the evolution of clusters extracted from temporal datasets. The name of the package is clusTransition, which stands for Cluster Transition. The algorithm is based on re-clustering cumulative datasets that evolve at successive time-points and monitoring the transitions experienced by the clusters in these clustering solutions. This paper’s contribution is to demonstrate how the package clusTransition is developed in the R programming language, and its workflow is discussed using hypothetical and real-life datasets."
https://openalex.org/W4311551356,"High-resolution magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has attracted much attention due to its contribution to clinical diagnoses and treatment. However, because of the interference of noise and the limitation of imaging equipment, it is expensive to generate a satisfactory image. Super-resolution (SR) is a technique that enhances an imaging system's resolution, which is effective and cost-efficient for MR imaging. In recent years, deep learning-based SR methods have made remarkable progress on natural images but not on medical images. Most existing medical images SR algorithms focus on the spatial information of a single image but ignore the temporal correlation between medical images sequence. We proposed two novel architectures for single medical image and sequential medical images, respectively. The multi-scale back-projection network (MSBPN) is constructed of several different scale back-projection units which consist of iterative up- and down-sampling layers. The multi-scale machine extracts different scale spatial information and strengthens the information fusion for a single image. Based on MSBPN, we proposed an accurate and lightweight Multi-Scale Bidirectional Fusion Attention Network(MSBFAN) that combines temporal information iteratively. That supplementary temporal information is extracted from the adjacent image sequence of the target image. The MSBFAN can effectively learn both the spatio-temporal dependencies and the iterative refinement process with only a lightweight number of parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that our MSBPN and MSBFAN are outperforming current SR methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy and parameter quantity of the model."
https://openalex.org/W4311551598,"Despite Bangladesh being one of the leading countries in aquaculture food production worldwide, there is a considerable lack of updated scientific information about aquaculture activities in remote sites, making it difficult to manage sustainably. This study explored the use of geospatial and field data to monitor spatio-temporal changes in aquaculture production sites in the Satkhira district from 2017–2019. We used Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission digital elevation model (SRTM DEM) to locate aquaculture ponds based on the terrain elevation and slope. Radar backscatter information from the Sentinel-1 satellite, and different water indices derived from Sentinel-2 were used to assess the spatio-temporal extents of aquaculture areas. An image segmentation algorithm was applied to detect aquaculture ponds based on backscattering intensity, size and shape characteristics. Our results show that the highest number of aquaculture ponds were observed in January, with a size of more than 30,000 ha. Object-based image classification of Sentinel-1 data showed an overall accuracy above 80%. The key factors responsible for the variation in aquaculture were investigated using field surveys. We noticed that despite a significant number of aquaculture ponds in the study area, shrimp production and export are decreasing because of a lack of infrastructure, poor governance, and lack of awareness in the local communities. The result of this study can provide in-depth information about aquaculture areas, which is vital for policymakers and environmental administrators for successful aquaculture management in Satkhira, Bangladesh and other countries with similar issues."

https://openalex.org/W4311551645,"Background Radiomics involves the extraction of quantitative information from annotated Computed-Tomography (CT) images, and has been used to predict outcomes in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC). Subjecting combined Radiomics and Clinical features to Machine Learning (ML) could offer better predictions of clinical outcomes. This study is a comparative performance analysis of ML models with Clinical, Radiomics, and Clinico-Radiomic datasets for predicting four outcomes of HNSCC treated with Curative Radiation Therapy (RT): Distant Metastases, Locoregional Recurrence, New Primary, and Residual Disease. Methodology The study used retrospective data of 311 HNSCC patients treated with radiotherapy between 2013–2018 at our centre. Binary prediction models were developed for the four outcomes with Clinical-only, Clinico-Radiomic, and Radiomics-only datasets, using three different ML classification algorithms namely, Random Forest (RF), Kernel Support Vector Machine (KSVM), and XGBoost. The best-performing ML algorithms of the three dataset groups was then compared. Results The Clinico-Radiomic dataset using KSVM classifier provided the best prediction. Predicted mean testing accuracy for Distant Metastases, Locoregional Recurrence, New Primary, and Residual Disease was 97%, 72%, 99%, and 96%, respectively. The mean area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) was calculated and displayed for all the models using three dataset groups. Conclusion Clinico-Radiomic dataset improved the predictive ability of ML models over clinical features alone, while models built using Radiomics performed poorly. Radiomics data could therefore effectively supplement clinical data in predicting outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4311551712,"Background While there is growing support for screening for Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), rigorous evidence on the efficacy and preference of screening methods is needed. Objective To examine caregiver: (1) rates of disclosure of their child’s exposure to ACEs using item-level response (each item can be endorsed) versus aggregate-level response (only total score reported) screening format, (2) associations between family demographic factors and disclosure by screening format, and (3) emotional reaction and experience of screening formats in a diverse, low-income pediatric population. Methods Caregiver participants (n = 367) were randomized to complete the Pediatric ACEs and Related Life Events Screener (PEARLS) tool, in an aggregate-level response vs item-level response format from 2016–2019. Select caregivers (n = 182) participated in debriefing interviews. T-test and chi-square analyses in 2019 compared PEARLS disclosure rates and reactions between the screening modalities. Regression models explored interactions with child characteristics. Thematic analysis of interview notes captured caregiver screening experience. Results PEARLS disclosure rates were significantly higher in the aggregate-level response compared to the item-level response screening arm (p &lt;0.05). This difference was accentuated for children identified as black and/or male (p &lt;0.05). Caregiver reactions to PEARLS screening were rarely negative in either screening format. Qualitative data demonstrated strong caregiver preference for the item-level response format; additional themes include provider relationship, fear with disclosure, and screening outcome expectations. Conclusion While caregivers reported a preference for the item-level response format, the aggregate-level response screening format elicited higher disclosures rates particularly for children who are black or ma.

However, the genetic diversity of different serogroups of nontyphoidal Salmonella in Guizhou is unknown. This study aimed to obtain the RNA secondary structure of the typical direct repeat sequences, the characteristics of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) genotypes, and the genetic diversity of different serogroups of nontyphoidal Salmonella strains. The 342 nontyphoidal Salmonella strains were collected from nine cities (prefectures) of Guizhou province during 2013–2018, serotyped by slide agglutination, and examined the molecular genotypes by CRISPR method. The strains were divided into five serogroups. The dominant serogroup was group B (47.08%), followed by group D1 (36.55%). One hundred and thirty-five CRISPR genotypes were detected with 108 novel spacer sequences amongst 981 unique spacer sequences. The diversity of nontyphoidal Salmonella CRISPR loci was not only the deletion, duplication, or point mutation of spacer sequences but also the acquisition of new spacer sequences to form novel genotypes. The CRISPR genotyping was an effective typing method that could reveal the genetic diversity of different nontyphoidal Salmonella serotypes except for S . Enteritidis."

https://openalex.org/W4311601712,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) stem cells are required for the initiation and maintenance of the disease. Activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is required for the survival and development of AML leukaemia stem cells (LSCs) and therefore, targeting β-catenin is a potential therapeutic strategy. NUC-7738, a phosphoramidate transformation of 3'-deoxyadenosine (3'-dA) monophosphate, is specifically designed to generate the active anti-cancer metabolite 3'-deoxyadenosine triphosphate (3'-dATP) intracellularly, bypassing key limitations of breakdown, transport, and activation. NUC-7738 is currently in a Phase I/II clinical study for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors. Protein expression and immunophenotypic profiling revealed that NUC-7738 caused apoptosis in AML cell lines through reducing PI3K-p110α, phosphorylated Akt (Ser473) and phosphorylated GSK3β (Ser9) resulting in reduced β-catenin, c-Myc and CD44 expression. NUC-7738 reduced β-catenin nuclear expression in AML cells. NUC-7738 also decreased the percentage of CD34+ CD38- CD123+ (LSC-like cells) from 81% to 47% and reduced the total number and size of leukemic colonies. These results indicate that therapeutic targeting of the PI3K/Akt/GSK3β axis can inhibit β-catenin signalling, resulting in reduced clonogenicity and eventual apoptosis of AML cells."

https://openalex.org/W4311601766,"Although the increased risk of developing sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) associated with the inheritance of the apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) allele is well characterized, the molecular underpinnings of how ApoE4 imparts risk remains unknown. Enhanced proteolysis of the ApoE4 protein with a toxic-gain of function has been suggested and a 17 kDa amino-terminal ApoE4 fragment (nApoE41-151) has been identified in post-mortem human AD frontal cortex sections. Recently, we demonstrated in vitro, exogenous treatment of nApoE41-151 in BV2 microglial cells leads to uptake, trafficking to the nucleus and increased expression of genes associated with cell toxicity and inflammation. In the present study, we extend these findings to zebrafish (Danio rerio), an in vivo model system to assess the toxicity of nApoE41-151. Exogenous treatment of nApoE41-151 to 24-hour post-fertilization for 24 hours resulted in significant mortality. In addition, developmental abnormalities were observed following treatment with nApoE41-151 including improper folding of the hindbrain, delay in ear development, deformed yolk sac, enlarged cardiac cavity, and significantly lower heart rates. A similar nApoE31-151 fragment that differs by a single amino acid change (C>R) at position 112 had no effects on these parameters under identical treatment conditions. Decreased presence of pigmentation was noted for both nApoE31-151- and nApoE41-151-treated larvae compared with controls. Behaviorally, touch-evoked responses to stimulus were negatively impacted by treatment with nApoE41-151 but did not reach statistical significance. Additionally, triple-labeling confocal microscopy not only confirmed the nuclear localization of the nApoE41-151 fragment within neuronal populations following exogenous treatment, but also identified the presence of tau pathology, one of the hallmark features of AD. Collectively, these in vivo data demonstrating toxicity as well as sublethal effects on organ and tissue development support a novel pathophysiological function of this AD associated-risk factor."

The multivariable-adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for the association between food expense insufficiency and socioeconomic and sociodemographic factors.A large-scale, cross-sectional online questionnaire survey.From August to September 2020, 25,482 participants aged 15-79 years completed the questionnaire (JACSIS 2020 study; Group 1). In October 2020, 917 single parents were surveyed for oversampling purposes. There were 179 single parents in Group 1 and a total of 1096 single parents in Group 2.Group 1 and Group 2 had 747 (2.9%) and 55 (5.0%) participants, respectively, who experienced food expense insufficiency for the first time after April 2020. Young age, part-time employment, being a single parent (in Group 1), and the number of people in the household (five or more in Group 1 and child/children alone in Group 2) were significantly associated with food expense insufficiency. As being a single parent was significantly associated with food expense insufficiency in Group 1 (AOR [95% CI] = 7.23 [5.40-9.68]), we further examined it in Group 2. Single parents who exhibited multiple factors (young age, part-time employment, living only with child/children) were likely to experience food expense insufficiency (15.3-15.8%).Triggered by the pandemic, a small percentage of individuals experienced food expense insufficiency. We identified that factors such as young age, part-time employment, and being a single parent were significantly associated with food expense insufficiency, and discovered that a multiplicity of these factors further increased the risk. Our findings suggest an urgent need to support individuals with a potentially high risk of food expense insufficiency."
https://openalex.org/W4311684253,"Informatization plays an increasingly important role in the tourism industry, while its effectiveness in alleviating tourism risks remains to be verified. This research aims to explore the effects of country risks on the international tourism and the moderating role of informatization between the two. This study firstly measures country risks based on the ICRG database, quantifies international tourism by tourism revenue, tourism expenditure, and tourist arrival, and calculates informatization level from informatization facilities, informatization applications, and informatization skills. A dynamic SYS-GMM model is then adopted to verify the research hypotheses based on the panel data of 138 countries from 2000 to 2019. The research results show that the composite country risk, political risk, economic risk, and financial risk all show a negative impact on the international tourism indicators regardless of different time periods, regions, or income levels. However, the effects are more obvious before the global financial crisis in 2008 and regions and countries with lower income levels. In addition, informatization is found to positively mitigate the adverse impacts of country risks on international tourism, especially for economic and financial risks. The research findings indicate the risk hedge potential of informatization in the tourism industry, which provides a profound reference for destination risk management."
