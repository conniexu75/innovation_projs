https://openalex.org/W2048551141,"Polo-like kinases (Plks) perform crucial functions in cell-cycle progression and multiple stages of mitosis. Plks are characterized by a C-terminal noncatalytic region containing two tandem Polo boxes, termed the Polo-box domain (PBD), which has recently been implicated in phosphodependent substrate targeting. We show that the PBDs of human, Xenopus, and yeast Plks all recognize similar phosphoserine/threonine-containing motifs. The 1.9 A X-ray structure of a human Plk1 PBD-phosphopeptide complex shows that the Polo boxes each comprise beta6alpha structures that associate to form a 12-stranded beta sandwich domain. The phosphopeptide binds along a conserved, positively charged cleft located at the edge of the Polo-box interface. Mutations that specifically disrupt phosphodependent interactions abolish cell-cycle-dependent localization and provide compelling phenotypic evidence that PBD-phospholigand binding is necessary for proper mitotic progression. In addition, phosphopeptide binding to the PBD stimulates kinase activity in full-length Plk1, suggesting a conformational switching mechanism for Plk regulation and a dual functionality for the PBD."
https://openalex.org/W1969921713,"Surfactant proteins A and D (SP-A and SP-D) are lung collectins composed of two regions, a globular head domain that binds PAMPs and a collagenous tail domain that initiates phagocytosis. We provide evidence that SP-A and SP-D act in a dual manner, to enhance or suppress inflammatory mediator production depending on binding orientation. SP-A and SP-D bind SIRPalpha through their globular heads to initiate a signaling pathway that blocks proinflammatory mediator production. In contrast, their collagenous tails stimulate proinflammatory mediator production through binding to calreticulin/CD91. Together a model is implied in which SP-A and SP-D help maintain a non/anti-inflammatory lung environment by stimulating SIRPalpha on resident cells through their globular heads. However, interaction of these heads with PAMPs on foreign organisms or damaged cells and presentation of the collagenous tails in an aggregated state to calreticulin/CD91, stimulates phagocytosis and proinflammatory responses."
https://openalex.org/W2097672870,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNFalpha) receptor signaling can simultaneously activate caspase 8, the transcription factor, NF-kappaB and the kinase, JNK. While activation of caspase 8 is required for TNFalpha-induced apoptosis, and induction of NF-kappaB inhibits cell death, the precise function of JNK activation in TNFalpha signaling is not clearly understood. Here, we report that TNFalpha-mediated caspase 8 cleavage and apoptosis require a sequential pathway involving JNK, Bid, and Smac/DIABLO. Activation of JNK induces caspase 8-independent cleavage of Bid at a distinct site to generate the Bid cleavage product jBid. Translocation of jBid to mitochondria leads to preferential release of Smac/DIABLO, but not cytochrome c. The released Smac/DIABLO then disrupts the TRAF2-cIAP1 complex. We propose that the JNK pathway described here is required to relieve the inhibition imposed by TRAF2-cIAP1 on caspase 8 activation and induction of apoptosis. Further, our findings define a mechanism for crosstalk between intrinsic and extrinsic cell death pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2145593944,"The canonical condensin complex (henceforth condensin I) plays an essential role in mitotic chromosome assembly and segregation from yeast to humans. We report here the identification of a second condensin complex (condensin II) from vertebrate cells. Condensins I and II share the same pair of structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) subunits but contain different sets of non-SMC subunits. siRNA-mediated depletion of condensin I- or condensin II-specific subunits in HeLa cells produces a distinct, highly characteristic defect in chromosome morphology. Simultaneous depletion of both complexes causes the severest defect. In Xenopus egg extracts, condensin I function is predominant, but lack of condensin II results in the formation of irregularly shaped chromosomes. Condensins I and II show different distributions along the axis of chromosomes assembled in vivo and in vitro. We propose that the two condensin complexes make distinct mechanistic contributions to mitotic chromosome architecture in vertebrate cells."
https://openalex.org/W2140371210,"The ClyA protein is a pore-forming cytotoxin expressed by Escherichia coli and some other enterobacteria. It confers cytotoxic activity toward mammalian cells, but it has remained unknown how ClyA is surface exposed and exported from bacterial cells. Outer-membrane vesicles (OMVs) released from the bacteria were shown to contain ClyA protein. ClyA formed oligomeric pore assemblies in the OMVs, and the cytotoxic activity toward mammalian cells was considerably higher than that of ClyA protein purified from the bacterial periplasm. The redox status of ClyA correlated with its ability to form the oligomeric pore assemblies. In bacterial cells with a defective periplasmic disulphide oxidoreductase system, the ClyA protein was phenotypically expressed in a constitutive manner. The results define a vesicle-mediated transport mechanism in bacteria, and our findings show that the localization of proteins to OMVs directly may contribute to the activation and delivery of pathogenic effector proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2044710235,"The mitochondrial ribosome is responsible for the biosynthesis of protein components crucial to the generation of ATP in the eukaryotic cell. Because the protein:RNA ratio in the mitochondrial ribosome (approximately 69:approximately 31) is the inverse of that of its prokaryotic counterpart (approximately 33:approximately 67), it was thought that the additional and/or larger proteins of the mitochondrial ribosome must compensate for the shortened rRNAs. Here, we present a three-dimensional cryo-electron microscopic map of the mammalian mitochondrial 55S ribosome carrying a tRNA at its P site, and we find that instead, many of the proteins occupy new positions in the ribosome. Furthermore, unlike cytoplasmic ribosomes, the mitochondrial ribosome possesses intersubunit bridges composed largely of proteins; it has a gatelike structure at its mRNA entrance, perhaps involved in recruiting unique mitochondrial mRNAs; and it has a polypeptide exit tunnel that allows access to the solvent before the exit site, suggesting a unique nascent-polypeptide exit mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2115885986,"We examined the mechanism responsible for the degradation of p21, a negative regulator of the cell division cycle. We found that p21 proteolysis requires functional ubiquitin and Nedd8 systems. Ubiquitinylated forms of p21 and p21(K0), a p21 mutant missing all lysines, are detected in vivo and in vitro, showing that the presence of lysines is dispensable for p21 ubiquitinylation. Instead, the free amino group of the N-terminal methionine of p21 is a site for ubiquitinylation in vivo. Although wild-type p21 is more abundantly ubiquitinylated than p21(K0) mutant due to the presence of internal lysine residues, their rates of proteolysis are indistinguishable. These results demonstrate that proteasomal degradation of p21 is regulated by the ubiquitin pathway and suggest that the site of the ubiquitin chain is critical in making p21 a competent substrate for the proteasome."
https://openalex.org/W2127325743,"The postsynaptic density contains multiple protein complexes that together relay the presynaptic neurotransmitter input to the activation of the postsynaptic neuron. In the present study we took two independent proteome approaches for the characterization of the protein complement of the postsynaptic density, namely 1) two-dimensional gel electrophoresis separation of proteins in conjunction with mass spectrometry to identify the tryptic peptides of the protein spots and 2) isolation of the trypsin-digested sample that was labeled with isotope-coded affinity tag, followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for the partial separation and identification of the peptides, respectively. Functional grouping of the identified proteins indicates that the postsynaptic density is a structurally and functionally complex organelle that may be involved in a broad range of synaptic activities. These proteins include the receptors and ion channels for glutamate neurotransmission, proteins for maintenance and modulation of synaptic architecture, sorting and trafficking of membrane proteins, generation of anaerobic energy, scaffolding and signaling, local protein synthesis, and correct protein folding and breakdown of synaptic proteins. Together, these results imply that the postsynaptic density may have the ability to function (semi-) autonomously and may direct various cellular functions in order to integrate synaptic physiology.

Together, these results imply that the postsynaptic density may have the ability to function (semi-) autonomously and may direct various cellular functions in order to integrate synaptic physiology. The majority of excitatory neurotransmission in the brain occurs via glutamatergic synapses. In the presynaptic element of the synapse, specialized secretion machinery determines the activity-dependent membrane fusion of glutamate-containing vesicles and the release of transmitter into the synaptic cleft. In the postsynaptic element, glutamate receptors and downstream signal transduction are organized by the protein assembly of the postsynaptic density (PSD). 1The abbreviations used are: PSD, postsynaptic density; CaMKII, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II; CHIP, C terminus of HSP70 interaction protein; EF-1α, eukaryotic elongation factor-1 α; Hsp, heat shock protein; ICAT, isotope-coded affinity tag; IF-4, eukaryotic initiation factor-4; LC, liquid chromatography; MALDI-TOF/TOF® MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight/time-of-flight mass spectrometer; NMDA receptor, N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor; PMF, peptide mass fingerprint; SAP, synapse-associated protein; Ub-Pr, ubiquititation/proteasome; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: PSD, postsynaptic density; CaMKII, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II; CHIP, C terminus of HSP70 interaction protein; EF-1α, eukaryotic elongation factor-1 α; Hsp, heat shock protein; ICAT, isotope-coded affinity tag; IF-4, eukaryotic initiation factor-4; LC, liquid chromatography; MALDI-TOF/TOF® MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight/time-of-flight mass spectrometer; NMDA receptor, N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor; PMF, peptide mass fingerprint; SAP, synapse-associated protein; Ub-Pr, ubiquititation/proteasome; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid.

The modulation of this molecular architecture of the synapse is at the basis of synaptic plasticity (6.Malinow R. Malenka R.C. Annu. Rev.

Cell. 2002; 108: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and aberrations thereof may underlie neuronal disorders.In view of the importance of the PSD in glutamatergic neurotransmission and its involvement in neuroplasticity, considerable efforts have been made to identify its protein constituents as a prelude to understand the molecular basis of PSD functioning. In the past several years, yeast two-hybrid technology has been extensively used to characterize proteins that interact with the glutamate receptors and may constitute core elements of the PSD involved in the regulation of receptor trafficking and signaling (reviewed in Refs. 9.Sheng M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7058-7061Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 10.McGee A.W. Bredt D.S. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 11.Garner C.C. Nash J. Huganir R.L. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 274-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Based largely on these studies a protein-protein interaction map of the PSD has emerged. In brief, the model posits that the postsynaptic receptor complexes are localized by scaffolding proteins such as the synapse-associated protein (SAP) 90 (also known as PSD-95). These proteins link the receptors to various signaling molecules e.g. nitric-oxide synthase, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors. Receptors and scaffolding proteins are further linked to cytoskeletal proteins, the arrangement of which will determine the morphology of and protein trafficking in the spine.Yeast two-hybrid experiments are particularly useful in the detection of pairwise protein interactions, but are limited in their ability to reveal the global protein constituents of the protein complexes/organelles of interest. Alternatively, several PSD proteins have been identified from protein complexes by conventional biochemical means (12.Walsh M.J. Kuruc N. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) or via the generation of antibodies against the protein complex for screening of the expression library (13.Langnaese K. Seidenbecher C. Wex H. Seidel B. Hartung K. Appeltauer U. Garner A. Voss B. Mueller B. Garner C.C. Gundelfinger E.D. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 42: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For a global analysis of proteins the recently developed mass spectrometric-based proteome approach is particular attractive because hundreds of proteins can be displayed and identified. The large dataset generated can be used to formulate hypotheses and in turn design experiments to understand the (distinct) physiological processes carried out by the differentially composed protein complexes. Recently, several large scale proteome and proteomics studies have been reported (4.Husi H. Ward M.A. Choudhary J.S. Blackstock W.P. Grant S.G. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar, 5.Husi, H., Choudhary, J., Blackstock, W., and Grant, S. G.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4069-4080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).One of the first applications of proteome research in neuroscience was aimed at the characterization of novel PSD proteins (18.Walikonis R.S. Jensen O.N. Mann M. William Provance D. Mercer J.A. Kennedy M.B. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4069-4080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PSD fraction was isolated using a standard protocol developed by Carlin et al. (19.Carlin R.K. Grab D.J. Cohen R.S. Siekevitz P. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 831-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). The PSD proteins were partially separated on an SDS electrophoresis gel, trypsinized, and then characterized based on their peptide mass fingerprint (PMF). About thirty proteins, including “classic” and novel PSD proteins, were successfully elucidated. Overall, the number of proteins identified was lower than that expected, which may amount to above a hundred (4.Husi H. Ward M.A. Choudhary J.S. Blackstock W.P. Grant S.G. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar, 9.Sheng M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7058-7061Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 10.McGee A.W. Bredt D.S. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This suggested that a considerable number of PSD proteins remained to be characterized.In this study we aimed at a much higher coverage of the PSD protein content in order to reveal groups of proteins that would predict novel synaptic functions. We employed two methods for the separation and detection of the proteins, namely (a) high-load preparative two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to separate a larger number of PSD proteins with increased resolution, and identified the tryptic peptides of individual protein spots by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight/time-of-flight mass spectrometer (MALDI TOF/TOF® MS), (b) isotope-coded affinity tagging (ICAT) of the proteins followed by trypsin digestion and the separation of cysteine-containing peptides by nano-liquid chromatography (LC) coupled online to an electrospray quadrupole-TOF mass spectrometer for the identification of the peptides (20.Tao W.A. Aebersold R. Curr. Opin. Biotech. 2003; 14: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). A large number of previously identified PSD proteins, as well as novel groups of proteins, were detected. Western blotting analysis of proteins from selected functional groups confirmed the enrichment of these proteins in the PSD. Grouping of the proteins based on their functions indicated protein complexes that are involved in diverse physiological activities, e.g. the receptors and ion channels, protein synthesis and breakdown, scaffolding, signal transduction etc. The wide diversity of proteins that may be active in the PSD clearly indicates the PSD to be the organizer of spine functioning sustaining the emerging view (21.Zhang W. Benson D.L. Hippocampus. 2000; 10: 512-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 22.Nimchinsky E.A. Sabatini B.L. Svoboda K. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 313-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar) that considers the dendritic spine as the smallest self-sustaining (semi)-autonomous neuronal organelle.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPurification of the PSD—The PSD fraction was isolated either as described (23.Wyneken U. Smalla K.-H. Marengo J.J. Soto D. de la Cerda A. Tischmeyer W. Grimm R. Boeckers T.M. Wolf G. Orrego F. Gundelfinger E.D. Neurosci. 2001; 102: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) based on the original method of Carlin et al. (19.Carlin R.K. Grab D.J. Cohen R.S. Siekevitz P. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 831-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar), or based largely on a variant of the original method (24.Wu K. Carlin R. Siekevitz P. J. Neurochem. 1986; 46: 831-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In brief, in the original method, forebrains of 30 days old untreated rats were homogenized in homogenization buffer (5 mm Hepes, pH 7.4; 320 mm sucrose) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cell debris and nuclei were removed by 1,000 × g centrifugation. The supernatant was spun for 20 min at 12,000 × g, resulting in supernatant and pellet P2. The P2 pellet was further fractionated by centrifugation in a sucrose step gradient to obtain the synaptosome, an organelle that contains both pre- and postsynaptic compartments. Synaptosome was lysed in hypotonic solution to release the cytoplasmic proteins and organelles such as mitochondria and small synaptic vesicle, and the resulting synaptic membrane was recovered by centrifugation using the sucrose gradient as stated above. For isolation of the PSD fraction, the synaptic membrane was diluted with 12 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 320 mm sucrose and an equal volume of 1% Triton X-100, 320 mm sucrose. The suspension was stirred for 15 min and then centrifuged for 30 min at 33,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 320 mm sucrose, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.1. After 15 min of stirring, the PSD proteins were pelleted by a 2-h centrifugation at 201,800 × g. All steps were carried out at 4 °C. This PSD preparation was used for all the two-dimensional gel experiments.In the variant method, the synaptic membrane was isolated as described above, and stirred for 30 min over ice in 1% Triton X-100 in 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4). After centrifugation for 15 min at 30,000 × g, the pellet was suspended in 320 mm sucrose in Hepes buffer and loaded on top of a sucrose gradient consisting of 1 m, 1.5 m, and 2 m sucrose. The sample was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2 h, and the interface between 1.5 and 2 m was collected, mixed with equal volume of water containing 2% Triton X-100 and 150 mm KCl, and loaded directly on top of a sucrose gradient of 1.5/2 m. The gradient was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The interface at 1.5/2 m sucrose was collected, diluted 2× with water, and centrifuged to obtain the PSD fraction. After washing once with water, the pellet was redissolved in 0.5% SDS and then used for ICAT labeling, trypsin digestion, and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry studies.Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was carried out as described (25.Jimenez C.R. Eyman M. Scotto Lavina Z. Gioio A. Li K.W. van der Schors R.C. Geraerts W.P.M. Giuditta A. Kaplan B.B. van Minnen J. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In brief, samples were solubilized in lysis buffer for 30 min (9 m urea, 2% CHAPS, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5% dithiothreitol, and 0.5% IPG buffer 3–10) and then centrifuged. 370 μl of the supernatant was used for the rehydration and simultaneously loading of the proteins to the IPG strip (Immobiline 18 cm DryStrip 3–10 NL, Amersham Biosciences), at 30 V for 12 h. The voltage was increased to 8000 V and focused for a total of 65,000 V/hr. Immediately after being focused, IPG strips were wrapped in plastic foil and stored at –80 °C. Prior to SDS-PAGE, IPG strips were equilibrated in 6 m urea/2% SDS/1% dithiothreitol/50 mm Tris, pH 8.8/30% glycerol for 15 min, followed by equilibration in 6 m urea/2% SDS/2.5% iodoacetamide/50 mm Tris, pH 8.8/30% glycerol for 15 min. The second dimension separation was run overnight using the Isodalt System (Amersham Biosciences) in 1.5-mm 11% gels (Duracryl, Genomic Solutions) at 25 mA per gel at 15 °C. After electrophoresis, gels were fixed and stained using either silver or colloidal Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250. The gels were washed once with water and stored at room temperature in a plastic sealing until tryptic digestion.Digestion of Proteins from Two-dimensional Gels—All the visible protein spots from the Coomassie Blue-stained gel were manually excised with a round bottom dermal slicer of 3-mm diameter. The gel pieces were destained in 60% acetonitrile in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.5, and then dehydrated with 100% acetonitrile. The shrunken gel pieces were reswelled in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer, dehydrated again in 100% acetonitrile, and dried in a speedvac. For gel pieces that were heavily stained the rehydration/dehydration step was repeated once. The gel pieces were rehydrated in 8 μl of trypsin solution (20 μg/ml) for 1 h, followed by addition of 50 μlof25mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer to completely immerse the gel pieces. After incubation overnight at room temperature, 0.5 μl of the incubation buffer was pipetted to the MALDI plate and mixed with 1 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid. The samples were analyzed by a MALDI TOF/TOF® (Applied Biosystems) mass spectrometer (see below). In cases where the mass spectrometric signals were weak, the incubation buffer was loaded into a C18 Ziptip (Millipore) according to the protocol provided by the company. The bound peptides were eluted from the Ziptip using 1.0 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, which was directly deposited onto the MALDI plate. The α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix concentration was 5 mg/ml in 50% acetonitrile/50% water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid.For the identification of (the abundant) proteins from the silver stained gel, protein spots were digested as stated above. After incubation with trypsin the supernatant was loaded into a self-packed Poros R2 (PerSeptive Biosystems) micro-tip, and eluted in 5 μl 50% acetronitrile/1% formic acid directly into a spraying electrode and analyzed by an electrospray Q-TOF (Micromass) mass spectrometer as described previously (26.Nagle G.T. de Jong-Brink M. Painter S.D. Li K.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1213-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and below.Immunoblots—P2, synaptosome, synaptic membrane and PSD fraction were lysed in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis lysis buffer, except that the IPG buffer and bromphenol blue were omitted from the lysis buffer. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay. Equal volume of the extract was mixed with 2× SDS buffer, boiled for 2 min, and 10 μg was loaded to a 10% mini SDS-gel. Electrophoresis was carried out at 120 V for 1 h, and the proteins were electrotransblotted to nitrocellulose membrane in the CAPSO buffer containing 10% methanol at 30V overnight. The membranes were blocked in 2% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline for 1 h, incubated in the primary antibodies (1:1000) for 1 h, washed in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, and incubated in the secondary antibodies (1:2000) for another hour. Signals were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). The primary antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnologies (EF-1α), BD Pharmingen (NMDA receptor subunit 1 clone 54.1), and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sorting nexin 3). Anti PSD-95 was a gift from Dr. T. Südhof. The anti-ribosome serum was obtained from a patient with systemic Lupus erythematosus. All secondary antibodies were purchased from Dako.Mass Spectrometry of Trypsin-digested Protein Spots from Two-dimensional Gels—The mass spectrometer utilized for the high throughput protein analysis was an Applied Biosystems 4700 Proteomics Analyzer with TOF/TOF™ Optics. This MALDI tandem mass spectrometer uses a 200 Hz frequency-tripled neodinium YAG laser operating at a wavelength of 355 nm. For MS/MS, ions generated by the MALDI process were accelerated at 8 kV through a grid at 6.7 kV into a short, linear, field-free drift region. In this region the ions passed through a timed-ion selector (TIS) device that is able to select one peptide from a mixture of peptides at different m/z for subsequent fragmentation in the collision cell. After a peptide at a given m/z was selected by the TIS it passed through a retarding lens where the ions were decelerated and then passed into the collision cell, which was operated at 7 kV. The collision energy was defined by the potential difference between the source and the collision cell and hence was 1 kV. Inside the collision cell the selected peptide ions collided with air at a pressure of 1 × 10–6 Torr. After passing through the collision cell the ions (both intact peptide ion, the precursor, and fragments caused by collision with the air, the product ions) were reaccelerated in the second source region at 15 kV, passed through a second, field free, linear drift region, into the reflector and finally to the detector. The detector amplified and converted the signal to electrical current, which was observed and manipulated on a PC-based operating system. For reflector mode the operation of the instrument is far simpler. After the MALDI process generates the peptide ions they are accelerated at 20 kV through a grid at 14 kV into the first, short, linear, field-free drift region. After this point the rest of the instrument can be treated as a continuation of this field-free, drift region until the ions enter the reflector and then reach the detector where, as before, the signal at the detector is amplified and converted to electrical current. Both MS and MS/MS spectra were searched against the Mascot data base search engine (Matrix Science) to identify the proteins.Electrospray (tandem) mass spectrometric experiments were performed on a Micromass Q-TOF mass spectrometer as described previously (26.Nagle G.T. de Jong-Brink M. Painter S.D. Li K.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1213-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The tryptic-digested samples were loaded into a nanoelectrospray capillary, which was pulled from a borosilicate glass capillary GC 100F-10 with a microcapillary puller. An internal wire electrode inserted inside the capillary was used for the measurement. The cone voltage was set at 25–30 V. For MS measurements, the quadrupole was operated in the rf-only mode and mass analysis was performed using the TOF analyzer. For tandem MS experiments, precursor ions were selected using the quadrupole, fragmented in the collision chamber using energies between 20 and 65 eV and argon as the collision gas, and the daughter ions detected by the TOF analyzer. Two major tryptic peptides were used for tandem MS, and the resulting daughter ion spectra were searched using the Mascot search engine. The electrospray MS that we used is less sensitive than the MALDI TOF/TOF® MS, and the potential co-migrating minor proteins in the protein spots are less likely to be detected.ICAT Labeling and Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry—The PSD fraction of about 0.1 mg was dissolved in 200 μl of 0.5% SDS in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5. It was then diluted 2 times in 50 mm Tris buffer, incubated with 1 mm TCEP, and labeled with ICAT® reagents according to the instruction of the ICAT labeling procedure as provided by the company (Applied Biosystems) with minor variations. Briefly, after neutralization of the ICAT® reagents, the samples were further diluted to a final concentration of 0.05% SDS. Trypsin at a ratio of 1:10 with respect to the sample protein concentration was added and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The digest was acidified and loaded into a4 × 15 mm cation exchange column equilibrated with 10 mm KH2PO4/25% acetonitrile, pH 3.0 at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The column was washed with 3 column volumes of equilibration buffer to remove excess ICAT and other reagents and bound peptides were eluted from the column with 400 mm KCl in the same buffer and collected as single fraction. The fraction was neutralized and loaded into a 4 × 15 mm avidin column equilibrated in 2× phosphate-buffered saline. Non-ICAT-labeled peptides were removed by extensive washing with 2× phosphate-buffered saline, followed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline, 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate/20% methanol, pH 8.3 and water, and finally the bound ICAT-labeled peptides were eluted with 3 column volumes of 30% acetonitrile/0.4% trifluoroacetic acid. The eluted peptides were evaporated to dryness and reconstituted in 100 μl of cleavage reagent for 2 h at 37 °C to cleave the biotin portion of the tag from the labeled peptides. The fraction was dried, reconstituted in 150 μl of 5% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and injected into a reversed phase capillary trap column at 40 μl/min. The peptides were resolved on a Dionex 75 μm × 15 cm C18 capillary column at 200 nl/min using a linear acetonitrile gradient from 5 to 50% in 60 min. The peptides were sprayed online into an electrospray quadrupole time-of-flight hybrid MS (QSTAR® from Applied Biosystems). Proteins were identified by analysis of collected MS/MS data using Pro ICAT™ software (Applied Biosystems).RESULTSFor two decades the 2× Triton extraction method to yield the PSD fraction from rat brain as developed by Carlin and coworkers (19.Carlin R.K. Grab D.J. Cohen R.S. Siekevitz P. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 831-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 24.Wu K. Carlin R. Siekevitz P. J. Neurochem. 1986; 46: 831-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) has been the standard protocol for the purification of PSD proteins and has been used in previous studies as the source for the characterization of novel PSD protein components. In the present study two independent proteome approaches were used, namely two-dimensional gel electrophoresis in conjunction with MALDI tandem mass spectrometry, and the ICAT peptide derivatization technique with nano-liquid chromatography coupled online to electrospray tandem mass spectrometry.In the first instance we used the two-dimensional gel-based method for the isolation of the PSD proteins. We verified the purification efficacy of the protocol resulting in the PSD fraction. We then completed the characterization of the proteins from the PSD fraction.First, we examined the enrichment of well-established PSD proteins in the PSD fraction, namely an NMDA receptor subunit NR1 and SAP90/PSD-95, and the depletion of a presynaptic marker protein, the integral synaptic vesicle membrane protein synaptophysin. Equal amounts of P2, synaptosome, synaptic membrane, and PSD fractions were run on an SDS gel, electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and immunostained with antibodies against NR 1, SAP90/PSD-95, and synaptophysin, respectively. Fig. 1 reveals the high enrichment of the NR1 and SAP90/PSD-95 in the PSD fraction. Synaptophysin is enriched in the synaptosome, diminished in the synaptic membrane and totally absent from the PSD fraction.Second, the progress of purification was monitored by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. 400-μg protein extracts of synaptosome, synaptic membrane, and the PSD fractions were separated by large format two-dimensional gels and stained with silver. The synaptosome fraction contains a high number of protein species over a wide range of isoelectric focusing point (pI) and Mr (Fig. 2A). The PSD fraction on the other hand exhibits a less complex protein pattern (Fig. 2C). Compared with the synaptic membrane a number of protein spots are relatively reduced in the PSD fraction, indicating that these proteins may not anchor to the PSD core (Fig. 2B). We then characterized nine of these proteins spots that are highly expressed in the synaptic membrane but apparently are absent or greatly reduced in the PSD fraction. Electrospray tandem mass spectrometry reveals that eight of them are mitochondrial proteins, namely aconitase, dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase, ATP synthase α chain, H-ATP synthase subunit d, pyruvate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, fumarase, and dihydrolipoamide acetyltranstransferase. Furthermore, there is a single glial cell-specific protein, the voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein 1. Six of these proteins are not detectable in the PSD fraction (see Table I), and the other three proteins appear as minor spots. This shows that the Triton X-100 extraction step selectively removes proteins that are known to be exogenous to the PSD. But it also indicates that a small fraction of high"

Presynaptic LTP is known to require the active zone protein RIM1alpha, but the underlying induction mechanism remains unclear. We now show that PKA directly phosphorylates RIM1alpha at two sites. Using paired recordings from cultured cerebellar granule and Purkinje neurons, we demonstrate that LTP is absent in neurons from RIM1alpha KO mice but is rescued by presynaptic expression of RIM1alpha. Mutant RIM1alpha lacking the N-terminal phosphorylation site is unable to rescue LTP in RIM1alpha knockout neurons but selectively suppresses LTP in wild-type neurons. Our findings suggest that PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the active zone protein RIM1alpha at a single N-terminal site induces presynaptic LTP."

Recent studies implicating Stat5a and Stat5b in the growth response to GH in mice and observations linking Stat5b to control of IGF-I gene transcription in rats have prompted the current investigations into the molecular determinants of a putative regulatory network extending from GH through Stat5b to IGF-I. Here we characterize as critical components of this hormone-activated transcriptional pathway two adjacent Stat5 binding sites in the second intron of the rat IGF-I gene located within a conserved region previously found to undergo acute and reversible changes in chromatin structure after in vivo GH treatment. As assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, GH rapidly induced binding of Stat5 to this DNA segment in the liver of GH-deficient rats, just prior to the onset of transcription from both major and minor IGF-I gene promoters. Biochemical reconstitution experiments showed that the two intronic Stat5 DNA elements were able to bind Stat5b in vitro after GH treatment could transmit GH- and Stat5b-dependent transcriptional responsiveness to the major IGF-I promoter and to a minimal neutral gene promoter and were required for full stimulation of reporter gene activity by GH. Taken together, these results identify an intronic enhancer as a key mediator of GH-induced IGF-I gene transcription working through Stat5b and provide new insight into the molecular architecture of this transcriptional pathway.

GH initiates its physiological effects after binding to the transmembrane GH receptor and activating JAK2, a receptor-associated intracellular tyrosine protein kinase (2Herrington J. Carter-Su C. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 252-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), thereby setting into motion a series of protein phosphorylation cascades that lead to the activation of several transcription factors including AP-1 and Stats1, 3, 5a, and 5b among others (11Rotwein P. Thomas M.J. Harris D.M. Gronowski A.M. LeStunff C. J. Anim. Sci. 1997; 75: 11-19Google Scholar). It has been known for over a decade that GH rapidly and potently induces IGF-I gene transcription in vivo (12Bichell D.P. Kikuchi K. Rotwein P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1899-1908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), leading to the sustained production of IGF-I mRNAs and protein (12Bichell D.P. Kikuchi K. Rotwein P. Mol.

Contributing to this challenge is the fact that the IGF-I gene is more complicated that its simple protein structure would have predicted. In mammals, the gene is transcribed from two promoters, each with unique leader exons, and its initial transcripts undergo both alternative splicing and differential polyadenylation to yield multiple mature mRNA species (14Rotwein P.

Here we use a combination of in vivo observations in GH-deficient rats and biochemical reconstitution experiments in tissue culture cells to identify a region within the IGF-I gene that binds Stat5 in a GH-dependent manner and is capable of mediating GH-stimulated IGF-I gene activation via this transcription factor. Materials—Antibodies to Stat5 (C17X) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and antibodies to anti-FLAG (M2) were from Sigma. Recombinant rat GH was from the National Hormone and Pituitary Program, NIDDK, National Institutes of Health. Oligonucleotides were synthesized at the Oregon Health & Sciences University Core Facility. Transit-LT1 was purchased from Mirus (Madision, WI), protein A-agarose beads were from Sigma, and the Qiaquick PCR DNA purification kit was from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). All of the other chemicals were reagent grade and were obtained from commercial suppliers. Recombinant Plasmids—A plasmid in pGL2 has been described encoding 1711 bp of rat IGF-I promoter 1 and the first 328 bp of exon 1 (18Thomas M.J. Umayahara Y. Shu H. Centrella M. Rotwein P.

An 825-bp fragment of rat IGF-I intron 2 was added 5′ to the promoter by standard molecular cloning methods. The mouse GH receptor in pcDNA3 was a gift from Dr. F. Talamantes (University of California, Santa Cruz, CA), and rat Stat5b in pcDNA3 was from Dr. Christin Carter-Su (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). The latter was modified by site-directed mutagenesis to add an NH2-terminal FLAG epitope tag, and point mutations were introduced to create constitutively active Stat5b (Stat5bCA, N699H) as described previously (15Woelfle J. Billiard J. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22696-22702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Thymidine kinase luciferase was from Dr. Susan Berry (University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN). It was modified by the addition of portions of rat IGF-I intron 2 as indicated in Fig. 5. Transient Transfections and Reporter Gene Assays—COS-7 cells (from ATCC) were incubated in media under conditions described previously (15Woelfle J. Billiard J. Rotwein P. J. Biol.

After incubation for 24 h, serum-free medium was added containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 8 h followed by the addition of recombinant rat GH (40 nm final concentration) or vehicle for 30 min. Cells were then harvested, and nuclear proteins were isolated (19Gronowski A.M. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7874-7878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For reporter gene assays, cells on 6-well tissue culture dishes were co-transfected with mouse GH receptor (750 ng) and wild type Stat5b (750 ng) and the promoter-reporter plasmids indicated in Figs. 4 and 5 (750 ng). Cells were incubated for 24 h followed by the addition of serum-free medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin and either rat GH or vehicle for 18 h. Cells were then harvested, and cell lysates were used for luciferase assays. All of the results were normalized for total cellular protein values. Animal Studies—Male Sprague-Dawley rats, hypophysectomized by a transauricular route at age 7 weeks, were purchased from Harlan Sprague-Dawley (Indianapolis, IN). Animals were housed at the OHSU Animal Care Facility on a 12-h light/dark schedule with free access to food and water and received care according to National Institutes of Health guidelines. All of the procedures were approved by the OHSU Animal Care and Use Committee. Glucocorticoids (cortisol phosphate, 400 μg/kg/day) and thyroxine (10 μg/kg/day) were replaced by daily subcutaneous injection, and GH deficiency was confirmed by failure to grow during a 2-week observation period. Following this interval, rats were injected intraperitoneally with either vehicle (saline) or 1.5 μg/g recombinant rat GH. At intervals, rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital (50 mg/kg intraperitoneally) and sacrificed. Liver proteins were isolated as described previously (19Gronowski A.M. Rotwein P. J. Biol.

After incubation of proteins and DNA for 30 min at 4 °C, products were separated by electrophoresis through non-denaturing 4-12% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) at 120 V for 2 h at 20 °C. Results were detected using a Molecular Imager FX and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Antibody supershift and competition experiments were performed as described previously (19Gronowski A.M.

RNA Analysis—Hepatic nuclear RNA was isolated as described previously (12Bichell D.P. Kikuchi K. Rotwein P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1899-1908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNA concentration was determined spectrophotometrically at 260 nm, and its quality was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Nuclear RNA (5 μg) was reverse-transcribed with random hexamers in a final volume of 20 μl using a RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). PCR reactions were then performed with 0.5 μl of cDNA (15Woelfle J.

For each time point, a 200-mg fragment of rat liver was minced and incubated at 20 °C in 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 1% formaldehyde on a rotating platform for 15 min followed by the addition of 1.5 ml of 1 m glycine and incubation for an additional 5 min. After centrifugation at 200 × g for 5 min at 20 °C, the pellet was suspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, transferred to a 2-ml Dounce apparatus, and homogenized with 10 strokes of a tight fitting pestle. After brief centrifugation in a microcentrifuge, the pellet was suspended in 400 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, pH 8.1, plus protease inhibitors) and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. Each sample was sonicated at 4 °C using a total of 5 pulses for 15 s each of a Branson Micro-tip sonicator at setting 5 interspersed with 30-s incubations on ice. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge, the supernatant was diluted 10-fold with immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.1, plus protease inhibitors) and 1-ml aliquots were used for immunoprecipitation as described previously (20Shang Y.

Kikuchi K. Rotwein P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1899-1908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, we found that Stat5b was required for acute activation of IGF-I gene transcription by GH (15Woelfle J. Billiard J. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22696-22702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The latter observations prompted the analysis of the IGF-I gene including HS7 for potential Stat5 binding sequences. A map of the first three exons of the rat IGF-I gene is illustrated in Fig. 1A and includes tandem promoters P1 and P2, their leader exons 1 and 2, respectively, and exon 3, which encodes the NH2-terminal half of the mature IGF-I peptide (14Rotwein P. Rosenfeld R. Roberts C.J. Contemporary Endocrinology: The IGF System. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 19-35Google Scholar). HS7 is located approximately midway between exons 2 and 3 as indicated. The DNA sequence illustrated below the map represents part of the 3′ end of HS7. It contains two putative Stat5 binding sites labeled GHRE-1 and GHRE-2, respectively, which both conform to the consensus of 5′-TTCNNNGAA-3′ (21Horvath C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 496-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Fig. 1B demonstrates that this 84-bp region of the rat IGF-I gene is fairly well conserved in two other mammalian species and that GHRE-1 is preserved as a potential Stat binding site among rat, mouse, and human IGF-I genes. There is additionally an ∼85% identity over the 900 bp flanking the 84-bp HS7 core DNA sequence between rats and mice and an ∼64% identity between rat and human IGF-I genes (data not shown). Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments were performed to determine whether the IGF-I HS7 region was capable of binding Stat5 in vivo in a GH-dependent way. As shown in Fig. 2A, in liver chromatin from GH-deficient rats, little Stat5 could be detected in association with HS7. Within 15 min of systemic hormone injection, Stat5 was found in chromatin at the HS7 site and this protein-DNA interaction persisted for the 60-min duration of the experiments. Nearly identical binding kinetics were observed at the proximal promoter of the GH-activated Sp12.1 gene, which contains tandem Stat5 sites (22Berry S.A. Bergad P.L. Whaley C.D. Towle H.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1714-1719PubMed Google Scholar), although no binding of Stat5 was observed at IGF-I intron 3 or proximal promoter 1 or to portions of the c-fos or β-actin genes, indicating that Stat5 was not being non-specifically cross-linked to DNA in liver chromatin. Hormone-dependent gene transcription was next assessed to evaluate the functional consequences of GH-stimulated Stat5 binding to the HS7 region of the rat IGF-I gene. Hepatic nuclear RNA was isolated from the same livers used for ChIP assays, and the accumulation of nascent transcripts was measured by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. As seen in Fig. 2B, transcripts directed by IGF-I promoters 1 and 2 were both strongly induced within 30 min after systemic GH injection and were increased in abundance by 60 min. Similar results were observed for Spi 2.1 gene activation. In this experimental model, GH also transiently induced c-fos gene expression as shown previously (23Gronowski A.M. Rotwein P. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4741-4748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but had little effect on β-actin. Thus, in vivo GH treatment rapidly and potently stimulates binding of Stat5 to the HS7 site in the second intron of the rat IGF-I gene in the liver followed by activation of transcription from both IGF-I promoters. DNA Binding Properties of GHRE-1 and GHRE-2—We used gel-mobility shift experiments to determine whether Stat5b could bind directly to GHRE-1 or GHRE-2. Fig. 3A shows results using labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides for each element. Nuclear protein extracts were prepared from COS-7 cells transfected with expression plasmids for the mouse GH receptor and either wild type or constitutively active rat Stat5b and treated with GH or vehicle for 30 min. As seen in Fig. 3A, GH induced the binding of wild type Stat5b to both DNA probes, whereas constitutively active Stat5b was able to bind in the absence of hormone. Antibody supershift experiments confirmed that Stat5b interacted with each oligonucleotide. We next evaluated the binding of endogenous hepatic Stat5 to the putative GHREs in HS7. Shown in Fig. 3B are results using labeled GHRE-1 and nuclear protein extracts from GH-deficient rats acutely treated with hormone. Inducible binding was observed beginning within 15 min after systemic GH injection and reached a maximum by 30-60 min. Under the conditions used in these experiments, no binding to a GHRE-2 oligonucleotide could be detected (data not shown), implying that it is a lower affinity site compared with GHRE-1. As a control, gel-mobility shift assays were performed with a double-stranded oligonucleotide that recognizes members of the Sp1 family of transcription factors (24Boulikas T. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 1994; 4: 117-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) that are not regulated by GH. As expected, constant protein-DNA interactions were observed over the same time course, indicating that both the quantity and quality of nuclear protein extracts were similar at each time point after hormone treatment. The relative affinity of GHRE-1 for hepatic Stat5 was assessed using liver nuclear proteins isolated at 60 min after injection of GH and a variety of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides. As shown in Fig. 3C, GHRE-1 competed avidly with itself for nuclear protein binding, whereas GHRE-2 competed poorly, even at a ×100 molar concentration. The contiguous Stat5 binding sites from the Spi 2.1 gene promoter competed with GHRE-1 but only at ×100 concentration, and the unrelated binding site for the Oct-1 transcription factor (24Boulikas T. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 1994; 4: 117-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) was ineffective. Taken together, the results in Fig. 3 show that GHRE-1 and GHRE-2 are bona fide Stat5 binding elements and that the affinity of Stat5 for GHRE-1 is greater than that for GHRE-2. GHRE-1 and GHRE-2 Mediate GH-activated and Stat5b-dependent Gene Transcription—We used reconstitution experiments in COS-7 cells to evaluate the transcriptional properties of HS7 and GHRE-1 and GHRE-2. Cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids for the mouse GH receptor and rat Stat5b and luciferase fusion genes containing rat IGF-I promoter 1 alone or with an 825-bp fragment of rat HS7 including GHRE-1 and GHRE-2. As shown in Fig. 4, GH treatment had no effect on the activity of the native IGF-I promoter but induced a 3.5-fold increase in luciferase activity of fusion genes containing the HS7 segment. To extend this observation of GH-stimulated gene transcription through HS7, additional reconstitution experiments were performed with luciferase reporter genes containing a minimal thymidine kinase promoter. As pictured in Fig. 5A, in the presence of GHRE-1 and GHRE-2 and Stat5b, GH induced a 6-7-fold increase in luciferase activity. The importance of the two GHREs for hormonal regulation was next evaluated after engineering point mutations into each site. As illustrated in Fig. 5B, a ∼8-fold increase in luciferase was detected after GH when both GHREs were present. The hormonal response dropped to ∼4-fold when only one GHRE was intact and declined to <1.4-fold when both were mutated. In addition, four copies of GHRE-1 were able to transfer an ∼7-fold response to GH onto the minimal thymidine kinase promoter (data not shown). Thus, each GHRE is capable of mediating GH-induced gene transcription in the presence of Stat5b. A long-standing challenge in the field of growth biology has been to understand the biochemical mechanisms by which GH activates IGF-I gene expression. Here we identify binding sites for the transcription factor Stat5 in a region within the second intron of the rat IGF-I gene previously shown to undergo a GH-stimulated chromatin transition coincident with hormone-induced IGF-I transcription (12Bichell D.P. Kikuchi K. Rotwein P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1899-1908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We show that this segment of the IGF-I gene binds Stat5 in vivo in a GH-dependent way just prior to the onset of IGF-I gene activation, can bind Stat5b in vitro, and is sufficient to mediate hormone-regulated and Stat5b-dependent reporter gene expression in the context of both the major IGF-I gene promoter and a minimal thymidine kinase promoter. Taken together, these results show that Stat5b is a key protein responsible for the induction of IGF-I gene transcription by GH and define the molecular architecture of this transcriptional response. Previous gene knock-out studies have established a role for Stat5b and to a lesser extent Stat5a in the physiological pathways responsible for normal somatic growth in rodents (16Udy G.B. Towers R.P. Snell R.G. Wilkins R.J. Park S.H. Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. Davey H.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7239-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar, 17Teglund S. McKay C.

In the absence of these proteins, mice developed up to a 30% deficit in postnatal linear growth that was associated with an ∼50% decline in serum levels of IGF-I (16Udy G.B. Towers R.P. Snell R.G.

More recently, we found that forced expression of a dominant-negative version of Stat5b in GH-deficient rats blocked the acute activation of IGF-I transcription by GH, whereas constitutively active Stat5b stimulated IGF-I gene expression in the absence of hormone (15Woelfle J. Billiard J. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22696-22702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Both groups of observations implicated Stat5b in IGF-I gene regulation but did not identify specific biochemical mechanisms, a question that we now have addressed. Members of the Stat family of transcription factors bind as dimers to DNA response elements consisting of variants of the palindromic nucleotide sequence 5′-TTCN2-4GAA-3′ where N signifies any deoxyribonucleotide (21Horvath C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 496-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Ehret et al. (25Ehret G.B. Reichenbach P. Schindler U. Horvath C.M. Fritz S. Nabholz M. Bucher P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6675-6688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) recently showed that Stats 1 and 5 preferentially bind to sites where n = 3 (25Ehret G.B. Reichenbach P. Schindler U. Horvath C.M. Fritz S. Nabholz M. Bucher P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6675-6688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). This is the precise spacing of IGF-I GHRE-1 and GHRE-2. Based on their results, we find additionally that GHRE-1 is identical in its core DNA sequence to Stat5 binding sites in the Cis and T cell receptor γ genes and that GHRE-2 is identical to the Stat5 response element in the αs1 casein gene (25Ehret G.B. Reichenbach P. Schindler U. Horvath C.M. Fritz S. Nabholz M. Bucher P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6675-6688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), thus providing further evidence supporting our experimental data that GHRE-1 and GHRE-2 are bona fide Stat5 binding sequences. The exact biochemical steps by which Stat5 activates target gene transcription remain incompletely understood. Previous studies established that the COOH-terminal transcription activation region of the protein could interact directly with the transcriptional co-activators CREB-binding protein and p300 (26Pfitzner E. Jahne R. Wissler M. Stoecklin E. Groner B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1582-1593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Ye S.K. Agata Y. Lee H.C. Kurooka H. Kitamura T. Shimizu A. Honjo T. Ikuta K. Immunity. 2001; 15: 813-823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), a process that led to chromatin modifications including histone acetylation (26Pfitzner E. Jahne R.

Immunity. 2001; 15: 813-823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and that transcription was facilitated by another Stat5-interacting protein, Nmi (28Zhu M. John S. Berg M. Leonard W.J. Cell. 1999; 96: 121-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Others have identified the widely expressed protein, centrosomal P4.1-associated protein, as a second co-activator of Stat5 that also physically interacted with the COOH terminus of the protein (29Peng B. Sutherland K.D. Sum E.Y. Olayioye M. Wittlin S. Tang T.K. Lindeman G.J. Visvader J.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2019-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). More recent studies have focused on the surprising observation that upon binding of activated Stat5 to regulatory sites on target genes, an associated histone deacetylase activity was enhanced (30Rascle A. Johnston J.A. Amati B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4162-4173Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 31Xu M. Nie L. Kim S.H. Sun X.H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In one series of experiments, the deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A globally blocked cytokine-induced activation of Stat5-dependent genes (30Rascle A. Johnston J.A. Amati B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4162-4173Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In another study, recruitment of the histone deacetylase, HDAC-1, to the Id-1 promoter by active Stat5 led to deacetylation of the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β, events that were required for induction of Id-1 transcription (31Xu M. Nie L. Kim S.H. Sun X.H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Our observations do not shed light on whether co-regulatory proteins with either acetyltransferase or deacetylase activity associate with Stat5 on the IGF-I gene but do provide a robust model system for answering this question. GH and IGF-I play central roles in human physiology. They are essential for normal growth during fetal and postnatal development and are critical for tissue maintenance and repair during aging (2Herrington J. Carter-Su C. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 252-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 3Jones J.I. Clemmons D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 3-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Lupu F.

In contrast, normal levels of both proteins have been found to have potential pathogenic consequences, being linked by epidemiological studies to several cancers (32Pollak M. Growth Horm. IGF Res. 2000; 10: 521-524Google Scholar). Thus, a full understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which GH regulates IGF-I gene expression will be necessary for developing effective therapeutic strategies to use these potent agents safely (33Kaspar B.K Llado J Sherkat N Rothstein J.D.

Abnormally high phosphorylation levels (hyperphosphorylation) at Ser-2843 in RyR1 and Ser-2809 in RyR2 and dissociation of FK506-binding proteins from the receptors have been implicated as one of the causes of altered calcium homeostasis observed during human heart failure. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we prepared recombinant RyR1 and RyR2 mutant receptors mimicking constitutively phosphorylated and dephosphorylated channels carrying a Ser/Asp (RyR1-S2843D and RyR2-S2809D) and Ser/Ala (RyR1-S2843A and RyR2-S2809A) substitution, respectively.

SR Ca2+ release is initiated by an action potential on the surface membrane that activates SR calcium release channels also known as ryanodine receptors (RyRs). In mammalian skeletal muscle, this process is mediated by a direct physical interaction between voltage-gated, dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channels located in the surface membrane and transverse tubular infoldings (t-tubules) and the skeletal muscle RyR (RyR1) (1Rios E. Pizarro G. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 849-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). In mammalian myocardium, an action potential initiates cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) activation and SR Ca2+ release by a mechanism referred to as calcium-induced calcium release (2Fabiato A. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 245: C1-C14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During calcium-induced calcium release, the influx of Ca2+ ions through voltage-gated, dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channels triggers the massive release of Ca2+ from the SR by activating a group of closely opposed RyR2s (3Franzini-Armstrong C.

Modulation of skeletal and cardiac excitation-contraction coupling results, in part, from changes in the phosphorylation state of numerous SR proteins involved in Ca2+ homeostasis. One of these proteins has been suggested to be the ryanodine receptor. RyR1 and RyR2 belong to a family of ligand-gated ion channels composed of four large subunits with molecular masses of ∼565 kDa with each subunit being associated with one small 12- and 12.6-kDa FK506-binding protein (FKBP12 and -12.6), respectively (4Franzini-Armstrong C.

The FKBPs belong to the family of immunophilins, exhibit cis/trans isomerase activity, and have been reported to stabilize channel protein conformation and synchronize the gating of neighboring RyRs (coupled gating) (6Brillantes A.B. Ondrias K. Scott A. Kobrinsky E. Ondriasova E. Moschella M.C. Jayaraman T. Landers M. Ehrlich B.E. Marks A.R.

RyR1 and RyR2 are part of a multiprotein complex that includes cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), protein phosphatase 1, and muscle protein kinase A-anchoring protein (9Marx S.O. Reiken S. Hisamatsu Y. Jayaraman T. Burkhoff D. Rosemblit N. Marks A.R. Cell. 2000; 101: 365-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1673) Google Scholar). The RyR2 complex also contains and is regulated by protein phosphatase 2A (9Marx S.O. Reiken S. Hisamatsu Y. Jayaraman T. Burkhoff D. Rosemblit N. Marks A.R. Cell. 2000; 101: 365-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1673) Google Scholar, 10Bandyopadhyay A. Shin D.W. Ahn J.O. Kim D.H. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Although isoform-specific differences are observed, the skeletal and cardiac ryanodine receptors are regulated by a common group of endogenous ligands including Ca2+, Mg2+, ATP, and calmodulin (5Fill M. Copello J.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 893-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar, 11Meissner G. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: d2072-d2080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Initially RyR2 was proposed to have a unique phosphorylation site (RyR2-Ser-2809) for Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII). The site was also phosphorylated by PKA but to a lesser extent (12Witcher D.R. Kovacs R.J. Schulman H. Cefali D.C. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11144-11152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although initial studies found that the homologous site in skeletal RyR (RyR1-Ser-2843) was not phosphorylated by CaMKII (12Witcher D.R. Kovacs R.J. Schulman H. Cefali D.C. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11144-11152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), other studies have observed in vitro CaMKII phosphorylation of this site and additional threonine residue(s) (13Chu A.

Hellmann G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1175: 193-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Different functional effects following CaMKII and PKA phosphorylation also indicated the presence of additional phosphorylation sites (15Hain J. Onoue H. Mayrleitner M. Fleischer S. Schindler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2074-2081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Metabolic labeling of RyR2 provided direct evidence for additional phosphorylation sites by showing that CaMKII phosphorylates at least four additional sites in RyR (16Rodriguez P. Bhogal M.S. Colyer J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38593-38600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In support of a physiological role, CaMKII co-purified with cardiac muscle RyR (17Hohenegger M. Suko J. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and, in skeletal SR vesicles, remained anchored to RyR in lipid bilayer measurements, altering the regulation of channel activity by ATP and Ca2+ (18Dulhunty A.F. Laver D. Curtis S.M. Pace S. Haarmann C. Gallant E.M. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 3240-3252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle, αKAP, a non-kinase protein, has been identified as one of the anchoring proteins necessary for targeting the CaMKII holoenzyme to the SR membrane (19Bayer K.U. Harbers K. Schulman H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5598-5605Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In single channel measurements, PKA-mediated phosphorylation of RyR decreased ATP and Mg2+ sensitivity, and the phosphorylated RyR channels exhibited an increase in the number of channel events and mean open time (20Uehara A. Yasukochi M. Mejia-Alvarez R. Fill M. Imanaga I. Pflueg. Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2002; 444: 202-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and altered the Ca2+ sensitivity under non-steady-state conditions (21Valdivia H.H. Kaplan J.H. Ellis-Davies G.C. Lederer W.J. Science. 1995; 267: 1997-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). In failing hearts, release of protein phosphatases from the RyR2 protein complex has been suggested to increase the endogenous PKA-mediated phosphorylation levels of RyR2 (“hyperphosphorylation”) (9Marx S.O. Reiken S. Hisamatsu Y. Jayaraman T. Burkhoff D. Rosemblit N. Marks A.R. Cell. 2000; 101: 365-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1673) Google Scholar). Recently hyperphosphorylation and FKBP12 depletion of the skeletal ryanodine receptor during heart disease have been described and linked to the severely decreased exercise capability observed in these patients (22Ward C.W. Reiken S. Marks A.R. Marty I. Vassort G. Lacampagne A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1517-1519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Failing to observe dissociation of protein phosphatase 1, the only phosphatase known to associate with RyR1, during heart failure indicates a novel mechanism for PKA-mediated hyperphosphorylation of RyR1 in skeletal muscle (23Reiken S. Lacampagne A. Zhou H. Kherani A. Lehnart S.E. Ward C. Huang F. Gaburjakova M. Gaburjakova J. Rosemblit N. Warren M.S. He K.L. Yi G.H. Wang J. Burkhoff D. Vassort G. Marks A.R. J.

In both RyR1 and RyR2, hyperphosphorylation of the receptor was accompanied by an almost complete elimination of FKBP12 and FKBP12.6 binding to the receptor (9Marx S.O. Reiken S. Hisamatsu Y.

Loss of FKBP was proposed to increase RyR sensitivity to the agonist Ca2+ and thereby increase SR Ca2+ “leakiness” at diastolic Ca2+ levels (9Marx S.O. Reiken S. Hisamatsu Y. Jayaraman T. Burkhoff D.

To investigate the functional effects of RyR phosphorylation in more detail, we prepared recombinant RyR1 and RyR2 phosphorylation mutants that cannot be phosphorylated at their known phosphorylation site, RyR1-Ser-2843 and RyR2-Ser-2809, due to an alanine or aspartic acid substitution. These amino acid substitutions mimic a constitutively dephosphorylated and phosphorylated receptor state, respectively. Functional and biochemical effects of these mutations were assessed using [3H]ryanodine binding, single channel, and calcium imaging measurements as well as co-immunoprecipitation. The results presented here suggest that ryanodine receptors may be phosphorylated at additional site(s) in vivo and that phosphorylation of RyR1-Ser-2843 and RyR2-Ser-2809, per se, does not cause major functional changes. Materials—Phospholipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). [3H]Ryanodine and [32P]PO43- were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and ICN Biomedicals Inc. (Costa Mesa, CA), respectively. FK506 was generously provided by Dr. Bekershy, Fujisawa Healthcare Inc., Deerfield, IL. All chemicals used were of analytical grade. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Cell Culture—The full-length rabbit RyR1 cDNA was constructed as described previously (27Gao L. Tripathy A. Lu X. Meissner G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Full-length rabbit RyR2 was kindly provided by Dr. Junichi Nakai, National Institute of Physiological Science, Okazaki, Japan. cDNAs encoding RyR1-S2843A and -S2843D and RyR2-S2809A and -S2809D mutants were prepared using Pfu polymerase-based chain reaction and the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the gmanufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The sequences of the primers used for mutagenesis were as follows: RyR1-S2843A, g aca cgg aag att Gcc cag act gcc cag; RyR1-S2843D, g aaa aag aca cgg aag att GAc cag act gcc cag acc tac; RyR2-S2809A, ga act cgt cgt att Gct cag aca agc cag g; RyR2-S2809D, cc ctt tat aac cga act cgt cgt att GAt cag aca agc c. The PvuI/NdeI (positions 8600–11304) fragment of RyR1 cDNA and the MunI/XbaI (positions 7736–10066) fragment of RyR2 subcloned into vector served as the template for mutagenesis. The complete mutated sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The RyR1 mutated sequence was subcloned back into the original position of RyR1 in two steps: to a vector containing PvuI/XbaI (positions 8600–15276) fragment and preparation of mutated RyR1 full-length plasmids by ligation of two fragments (ClaI/PvuI and PvuI/XbaI containing the mutated sequence) and pCMV5 (ClaI/XbaI). The RyR2 fragment with the mutation was subcloned back into the original position of RyR2 in two steps: to a vector containing BbrPI/SacII (positions 5038–11203) fragment and to full-length RyR2 in pCIneo. Nucleotide numbering is as described previously (27Gao L. Tripathy A. Lu X. Meissner G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 28Nakai J. Imagawa T. Hakamata Y. Shigekawa M. Takeshima H. Numa S. FEBS Lett. 1990; 271: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). WT and mutant RyRs were transiently expressed, in the presence of FKBP12.6 where indicated, in HEK293 cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and plated the day before transfection. For each 10-cm culture dish, 3.5 μg of cDNA was used. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. Crude membrane fractions were prepared as described previously (27Gao L. Tripathy A. Lu X. Meissner G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and stored under liquid nitrogen until use. Preparation of SR Vesicles—SR vesicle fractions enriched in [3H]ryanodine binding were prepared from rabbit skeletal and canine cardiac muscle in the presence of protease inhibitors (100 nm aprotinin, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) (29Meissner G.

Single Channel Measurements—Single channel measurements were performed in symmetric KCl solutions (250 mm, 20 mm KHepes, pH 7.4) containing additions as indicated (31Stange M. Tripathy A. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1419-1429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Membrane fractions containing the WT and mutant receptors were added to the cis chamber of a bilayer apparatus and fused in the presence of an osmotic gradient with Mueller-Rudin type planar bilayers containing a 5:3:2 mixture of bovine brain phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylcholine (35 mg of total phospholipid/ml n-decane). The gradient was formed across the bilayer membrane with 250 mmcis KCl and 20 mmtrans KCl solutions. After appearance of single channel activity, an increase in trans KCl concentration to 250 mm prevented further incorporation of RyRs. The trans side of the bilayer was defined as ground. Channel activities were recorded at –20 mV and with 10 mm Ca2+ in the trans chamber at 0-mV holding potential using a commercially available patch clamp amplifier with a bilayer headstage (Axopatch 1D, Axon Instruments, Burlingame, CA). Measurement of the sensitivity of the channels to cytosolic Ca2+ indicated that in a majority of recordings (>98%) the cytosolic side of RyRs faced the cis side and the luminal side faced the trans side of the bilayer. Electrical signals were filtered at 2 kHz or 300 Hz with K+ and Ca2+ as current carrier, respectively, and digitized at 10 kHz. Data acquisition and analysis were performed with the software package pClamp 9.0.2. (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Data files were directly acquired using the continuous gap-free mode. Channel parameters were calculated from current recordings of 2-min duration using a threshold setting of 50% of the current amplitude between the closed and open states. Channel open probability (Po) in multichannel recordings was calculated using the formula Σ iPo,i/N where N is the total number of channels, and Po,i is channel open probability of the ith channel. The presence of possible substates relative to the full-open amplitude was probed using current amplitude histograms obtained from 2-min single channel recordings. [3H]Ryanodine Binding—Ryanodine binds with high specificity to the RyRs and is widely used as a probe of channel activity because of its preferential binding to the open channel state (4Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 699-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 32Sutko J.L. Airey J.A. Welch W. Ruest L. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 53-98PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, experiments were performed as described previously (33Balshaw D.M. Xu L. Yamaguchi N. Pasek D.A. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20144-20153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Membrane fractions (25–75 μg of protein in 120 μl of total sample volume) were incubated with 2.5 nm [3H]ryanodine in 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.0 buffer containing 150 mm KCl, 0.3 m sucrose, under oxidizing (1 mm oxidized glutathione, GSSG) or reducing (5 mm reduced glutathione, GSH) conditions, and the indicated additions of channel agonists and/or antagonists. After 24 h at room temperature, samples were diluted with 8.5 volumes of ice-cold water and placed on Whatman GF/B filters preincubated with 2% polyethylenimine in water. Radioactivity remaining on the filters was determined by liquid scintillation counting to obtain bound [3H]ryanodine. Nonspecific binding was determined using a 1000-fold excess of unlabeled ryanodine in the presence of 1 mm EGTA. The total number of ryanodine binding sites (Bmax) was determined in 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.0 buffer containing 800 mm KCl, 200 μm free Ca2+ by Scatchard plot analysis or at 30 nm [3H]ryanodine, a condition that caused maximal binding of [3H]ryanodine to the receptors. If not stated differently, data were normalized using Bmax values. In experiments using protein phosphatase-treated SR, acid phosphatase (Sigma) was dialyzed for 5 h at 4 °C against sample buffer, and membranes were subsequently incubated with phosphatase at 60 μg of protein/unit of protein phosphatase for 1 h at 37 °C. RyR2-Ser-2809 phosphorylation levels of treated and untreated samples were determined by immunoblot analysis using a phospho-RyR2-Ser-2809- and dephospho-RyR2-Ser-2809-specific antibody (Badrilla, Leeds, UK). Development and analysis of Western blots were performed as described under “Co-immunoprecipitation of RyRs and FKBPs” except that 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline was used for blocking and primary antibody incubation medium, and Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 was used as washing buffer. Co-immunoprecipitation of RyRs and FKBPs—For immunoprecipitation experiments, membranes (1–2 mg of protein) were homogenized in ice-cold 20 mm NaPipes, pH 7.2 buffer containing 0.3 m sucrose, 1 m NaCl, 2.5% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors (Complete choice protease inhibitor tablets, Roche Applied Science) using a Teflon homogenizer. Following a 10-min incubation on ice, samples were diluted with ice-cold water to 1.25% Triton X-100 and incubated on ice for an additional 20 min. Solubilized receptors were separated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 40 min, diluted with 20 mm NaPipes, pH 7.0 buffer containing 0.3 m sucrose, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1.2 mm CaCl2, and protease inhibitors to 0.3% Triton X-100 and 125 mm NaCl, and incubated with mouse monoclonal antibody RyRD110 (1:10) raised against rabbit skeletal muscle RyR and mouse monoclonal antibody RyRC3-33 (1:10) raised against cardiac muscle RyR at 4 °C. After 12 h, anti-mouse IgG-agarose beads (Sigma) were added, and the sample was incubated for an additional 2 h. Subsequently beads were washed three times with 20 mm NaPipes, pH 7.0 buffer containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 125 mm NaCl and once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove residual Triton X-100. Bound proteins were solubilized in SDS buffer at 37 °C for 15 min and separated on 3–15% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins in the top half of the gel (>60 kDa) were transferred in a cooled wet chamber for 1 h at 400 mA and 12 h at 1000 mA onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) and blocked with 5% milk and 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS. RyRs were detected using monoclonal antibody RyRD110 and monoclonal antibody RyRC3-33, both diluted to 1:10 with 5% milk and 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS. The bottom half of the gel was transferred in a semidry chamber overnight at 50 mA onto polyvinylidene difluoride, blocked with 5% milk and 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, and blotted with anti-FKBP antibody (Alexis) diluted to 1:2000 in 5% milk and 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS. RyR and co-immunoprecipitated FKBP were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences), and proteins were quantified using Kodak Scientific Imaging Systems 1D version 3.6 software. Calcium Imaging—Cellular Ca2+ release in response to caffeine was determined by intracellular fluo-4 fluorescence. HEK293 cells transfected with cDNA encoding WT and mutant RyRs were grown on glass coverslips. RyR2 cDNAs were co-transfected with FKBP12.6 cDNA. For control experiments, non-transfected cells or cells transfected with vector-only plasmids were used. Calcium imaging experiments were performed similarly to those described in Ref. 34Fessenden J.D. Wang Y. Moore R.A. Chen S.R. Allen P.D. Pessah I.N. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2509-2525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar. Approximately half-confluent cells were loaded with 5 μm fluo-4 ester, 0.1% dispersion agent (F-127) at 37 °C in Krebs-Ringer-Henseleit solution (KRH) containing 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 6 mm glucose, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, and 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. After 1 h, cells were rinsed with KRH to remove non-hydrolyzed fluorophore and transferred to a chamber. The fluorescence response was measured using a Nikon Eclipse TE300 microscope and Photon Technology International Deltascan system. Fluo-4 was excited at 490 nm, and emitted fluorescence was recorded at 526 nm. Base-line fluorescence was adjusted to 30–40 response units and recorded for 30 s, and caffeine responsiveness of cells was measured by rapid (∼1-s) addition of freshly made caffeine solution to a final concentration of 10 mm. Preliminary experiments indicated that this concentration was sufficient to result in maximal caffeine response. To allow normalization, cells were subsequently treated with ionomycin to measure fluorescence in the presence of 2 mm Ca2+. For analysis, individual cells were defined as regions of interest, and average fluorescence was quantified using the program ImageMaster (Photon Technology International). Background levels were subtracted, and responsiveness was normalized using the analysis program Felix (Photon Technology International). Metabolic Labeling of RyR2—In metabolic labeling experiments, ∼2–3 × 107 HEK293 cells were used. To increase the extent of metabolic 32Pi labeling, cells were incubated for 1 h in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium prior to labeling for 12 h in fresh phosphatefree medium supplemented with 100 μCi/ml 32Pi (ICN Biomedicals Inc.). PBS and all other buffers used for harvesting and processing the cells contained Complete choice protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitor mixture I (Sigma), 1 mm Na3VO4, and 75 mm Na3PO4. Crude membrane fractions from metabolically labeled HEK293 cells were solubilized in 20 mm NaPipes, pH 7.4 buffer containing 0.3 m sucrose, 2.5% Triton X-100, and 1 m NaCl. Extended solubilization times of 4 h were required before affinity purification to eliminate a 32P-labeled high molecular weight band traveling closely above the RyR on the gels. Following dilution to 0.3% Triton X-100 and 125 mm NaCl, RyR2 was purified by binding to CaM-agarose beads in the presence of 900 μm free Ca2+ and 3 mm dithiothreitol. Following washing of the beads, proteins were separated by 3–10% SDS-PAGE. Gels were silver-stained and dried using a gel drying solution (Invitrogen), and the incorporation of 32Pi was visualized using phosphorimaging (Storm PhosphorImager, ImageQuant analysis software, and general purpose screens, all obtained from Amersham Biosciences). In parallel experiments, unlabeled cells were processed identically. The position of RyR2 as determined by Western blot analysis was used to identify the silver-stained RyR2 bands in the 32Pi-labeled gels and PhosphorImager scans. To quantify the amount of 32Pi incorporation, identically sized gel pieces containing the RyR2 band were incubated with scintillation fluid for 24 h and counted using a scintillation counter. To account for potential differences in initial 32Pi uptake by the cells, 32P content of a second gel piece at 200-kDa molecular mass was determined and used to normalize the RyR2 signal. Background signal intensities of non- and vector-only-transfected cells were determined and subtracted from all samples, and final results were adjusted for RyR2 protein content based on signal intensity in silver-stai"

Because TNF receptor 2 lacks an intrinsic kinase activity, we examined the kinase(s) mediating TNF-induced Etk activation. TNF induces a coordinated phosphorylation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and Etk, which is blocked by VEGFR2-specific inhibitors. In response to TNF, Etk and VEGFR2 form a complex resulting in a reciprocal activation between the two kinases. Subsequently, the downstream phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt signaling (but not signaling through phospholipase C-γ) was initiated and directly led to TNF-induced EC migration, which was significantly inhibited by VEGFR2-, PI3K-, or Akt-specific inhibitors. Phosphorylation of VEGFR2 at Tyr-801 and Tyr-1175, the critical sites for VEGF-induced PI3K-Akt signaling, was not involved in TNF-mediated Akt activation. However, TNF induces phosphorylation of Etk at Tyr-566, directly mediating the recruitment of the p85 subunit of PI3K. Furthermore, TNF- but not VEGF-induced activation of VEGFR2, Akt, and EC migration are blunted in EC genetically deficient with Etk. Taken together, our data demonstrated that TNF induces transactivation between Etk and VEGFR2, and Etk directly activates PI3K-Akt angiogenic signaling independent of VEGF-induced VEGFR2-PI3K-Akt signaling pathway.

VEGF primarily utilizes its receptor VEGFR2 (also Flk-1 or KDR) to induce angiogenic responses by activating a variety of signaling cascades including activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt, phospholipase Cγ (PLC-γ) and mitogen-activated protein kinase. It has been proposed that VEGF induces autophosphorylation of VEGFR2 at several tyrosine residues which serve as docking sites for signaling molecules such as PI3K and PLC-γ. The specific tyrosine residue contributing to VEGF-induced recruitment and activation of PLC-γ by VEGFR2 remains controversial (16Wu L.W. Mayo L.D. Dunbar J.D. Kessler K.M. Baerwald M.R. Jaffe E.A.

However, TNF induces EC migration and tube formation in the absence of proangiogenic factors, suggesting that TNF can directly activate EC migratory pathways (5Sarma V. Wolf F.W. Marks R.M. Shows T.B. Dixit V.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3302-3312PubMed Google Scholar, 6Frater-Schroder M. Risau W. Hallmann R. Gautschi P. Bohlen P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The mechanism by which TNF induces EC migratory pathways is poorly understood. We have recently shown that Etk is a critical mediator in TNF-induced EC migration and tube formation (23Pan S. An P. Zhang R. He X. Yin G. Min W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7512-7523Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The endothelial/epithelial tyrosine kinase (Etk or Bmx), a member of the Btk non-receptor tyrosine kinase family, has been implicated in cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and survival (24Tamagnone L. Lahtinen I. Mustonen T. Virtaneva K. Francis F. Muscatelli F. Alitalo R. Smith C.I. Larsson C. Alitalo K. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3683-3688PubMed Google Scholar, 25Qiu Y. Kung H.J.

Etk and three other members of this family (Btk, Itk, and Tec), participate in signal transduction in response to virtually all types of extracellular stimuli that are transmitted by growth factor receptors, cytokine receptors, G-protein-coupled receptors, antigen receptors, and integrins (27Qiu Y.

They share a common structure domain including a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, TEC homology domain, which has a PXXP motif (with exception of Etk), an SH3 and an SH2 domain, and a kinase domain. It has been proposed that intramolecular interactions between the PXXP motif in TEC homology domain and the SH3 domain and between the PH domain and the kinase domain fold Btk family kinases into a “closed” form (25Qiu Y. Kung H.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5651-5661Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 26Mano H. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1999; 10: 267-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Based on data from Etk activation by focal adhesion kinase, it has been proposed that integrin-induced binding of Etk to focal adhesion kinase leads to phosphorylation of Etk at Tyr-40 to open up the closed conformation of the inactive Etk and allow the kinase to be phosphorylated by Src family kinases at the highly conserved tyrosine residue Tyr-566 in the catalytic domain (25Qiu Y. Kung H.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5651-5661Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 31Chen R. Kim O. Li M. Xiong X. Guan J.L. Kung H.J. Chen H. Shimizu Y. Qiu Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). However, TNFR2 has no kinase activity, and it is not clear how Etk is activated in response to TNF. We propose that TNF induces recruitment of additional kinase(s) (23Pan S. An P. Zhang R. He X. Yin G. Min W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7512-7523Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The aim of this study is to identify the kinase for Etk activation by TNF. We show that TNF uses Etk to transactivate VEGFR2, which is in turn required for Etk activation by TNF. Thus, Etk and VEGFR2 serve as a mutual activator and effector in TNF pathway. In the TNF response, phosphorylation of Etk, but not of VEGFR2, is a critical mediator in recruiting PI3K and activation of Akt. Etk acts upstream of VEGFR2 and PI3K-Akt to specifically mediate TNF-induced angiogenic signaling pathway distinct from that induced by VEGF. Materials—Mammalian expression plasmids for Etk/Bmx wild type and mutants were provided by Dr. Dianqing Wu (University of Connecticut) and those for VEGFR2 (Flk-1/KDR) were provided by Dr. Bruce Terman (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York). The VEGFR2 and Etk point mutants were generated by the QuikChange™ site-specific mutagenesis kit followed the Manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (4-[4′-chloro-2′-fluoro)phenylamino]-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline), SU1498, AG1478, 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP2), LY29294002, SP600125, Akt inhibitor, and U73122 were purchased from Calbiochem. Anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473), anti-Akt, anti-phospho-PLC-γ (Tyr(P)-783), and anti-PLC-γ were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 (Tyr(P)-4G10) was from Upstate Biotechnology. Anti-FLAG M2 antibody was from Sigma, and anti-T7 was from Novagen. Anti-VEGFR2, anti-Etk/Bmx, anti-p85 (PI3K), anti-JNK1, and protein A/G PLUS-agarose were from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). Generation of Antibodies against Phospho-VEGFR2 and Phospho-Etk—Polyclonal antibodies directed against specific phospho-VEGFR2 and phospho-ETK were produced by immunizing rabbits with one of three synthetic phospho-peptides corresponding to residues surrounding human VEGFR2 Tyr-1054/1059 and Tyr-1175 and human ETK Tyr-566. The peptide sequences are RDIpYKDPDpYVRKG, QQDGKDpYIVLPISE, and VLDDQpYVSSVGT, respectively, where pY indicates phospho-tyrosine. The peptides were synthesized with N-terminal cysteine residues and coupled to KLH for immunization. The antibodies were affinity-purified from rabbit antisera by affinity chromatography steps using protein A columns to purify immunoglobulins followed by specific phospho-peptide (immunogen) columns to obtain the phospho-VEGFR2(Tyr-1054/1059), phospho-VEGFR2(Tyr-1175), and phospho-ETK(Tyr-566) affinity-purified antibodies employed in this study. Cell and Cytokines—Human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC) and bovine aorta endothelial cells (BAEC) were purchased from Clonetics (San Diego, CA). Lung endothelial cells isolated from Etk/Bmx-deficient mice were isolated according to a procedure described (23Pan S. An P. Zhang R. He X. Yin G. Min W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7512-7523Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Minced tissue was digested with collagenase. Large tissue fragments were removed by filtration through a 100-mesh nylon screen. The filtrate was collected on a 20-mesh nylon screen, washed, then purified using Percoll gradient centrifugation. EC contained in the 3rd through 10th fractions from the top of the gradient (density 1.00-1.050 g/ml) were collected, washed, and then seeded into dishes containing EC growth medium. Contaminating non-EC were removed by mechanical weeding and by fluorescence activated cell sorting using antibodies to platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (CD31) to label the EC. The sorted cells were assessed for EC phenotype, including morphology, and expression of von Willebrand Factor and PECAM-1. EC were used at passages 1-5. Human and murine recombinant TNF and human VEGF165 were from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Transfection—Transfection of BAEC was performed by LipofectAMINE 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Cells were cultured at 90% confluence in 6-well plates and transfected with total 4 μg of plasmid constructs as indicated. Cells were harvested at 36-48 h post-transfection, and cell lysates were used for protein assays. JNK Kinase Assay—JNK assays were performed as described previously using glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun-(1-80) fusion protein as a substrate (32Liu Y. Yin G. Surapisitchat J. Berk B.C. Min W. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 917-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Briefly, a total of 400 μg of cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with 5 μg of antibody against JNK1 (Santa Cruz). The immunoprecipitates were mixed with 10 μg of glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun-(1-80) suspended in the kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm ATP) containing 1 μl (10 μCi) of [γ-32P]ATP. The kinase assay was performed at 25 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer, the products were resolved by SDS-PAGE (12%), and the phosphorylated glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun (1-80) was visualized by autoradiography. The JNK1 protein was determined by Western blot with anti-JNK1. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—BAEC after various treatments were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in a membrane lysis buffer (30 mm Tris, pH 8, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10 g/liter polyoxyethylene-8-lauryl ether, 1 mmO-phenanthroline, 1 mm indoacetamide, 10 mm NaF, 5 mm orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate). Cells were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cell lysates were then thaw on ice, scraped, sonicated, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. Supernatants were used immediately for immunoblot or immunoprecipitation. For immunoprecipitation to analyze protein interaction in vivo, supernatants of cell lysates were diluted 3 times with a cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.75% Brij 96, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA). The lysates were then incubated with the first protein-specific antiserum (e.g. anti-Etk or anti-VEGFR2) on ice for 1.5 h. Then 10 μl of protein A/G PLUS-agarose was added and incubated for 2 h with rotation. Immune complexes were collected after each immunoprecipitation by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min followed by 3-5 washes with lysis buffer. The immune complexes were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot with the second protein (e.g. phosphotyrosine antibody, Upstate, NY). The chemiluminescence was detected using an ECL kit according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). For detection of FLAG-tagged proteins (Etk mutants) and T7-tagged proteins (e.g. Etk), anti-FLAG M2 antibody and anti-T7 were used for immunoblots, respectively. EC Migration Assay and Image Analysis—EC migration was performed as described previously (23Pan S. An P. Zhang R. He X. Yin G. Min W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7512-7523Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Briefly, BAEC were cultured in 0.5% fetal bovine serum overnight and subjected to “wound injury” with a yellow tip. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline once, and fresh media (0.5% fetal bovine serum) with or without TNF (1 ng/ml) were added. Cells were further cultured for the indicated times. The EC migration in culture was determined by measuring wound areas in cell monolayers. Three different images from each well along the wound were captured by a digital camera under a microscope (4×). A hemocytometer (1 mm2/grid) was used as a standard. Wound area (mm2) was measured and analyzed by NIH Image 1.60. Statistical analyses were performed with StatView 4.0 package (ABACUS Concepts). Data are presented as means (±S.D.). Differences were analyzed by an unpaired two-tailed Student t test. Values of p < 0.05 were taken as significant. TNF Induces a Coordinated Phosphorylation of VEGFR2 and Etk in a VEGFR2 Kinase-dependent Manner—Because TNFR2 has no intrinsic kinase activity, we reasoned that another tyrosine kinase(s) is involved in TNF/TNFR2-induced Etk activation. To define the kinase(s) responsible for Etk activation, we examined the effect of various kinase inhibitors on TNF-induced Etk activation. Human EC (HUVEC) were preincubated with inhibitors specific to EGFR (AG1478, 1 μm), VEGFR (SU1498, 30 μm or VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, 10 μm), or Src family protein kinases (PP2, 10 μm) for 30 min followed by stimulation with TNF (1 ng/ml for 15 min). Etk activation was determined by immunoprecipitation with anti-Etk followed by Western blot with anti-phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)). Results show that TNF-induced Etk activation was blocked by inhibitors of VEGFR2 but not of EGFR or Src (Fig. 1a). As a control, TNF-induced JNK activation was not blocked by inhibitors to VEGFR2, EGFR, or Src but could be blocked by JNK-specific inhibitor SP600125 (20 μm) (Fig. 1b). It is well known that VEGFR2 activation by VEGF involves receptor tyrosine phosphorylations. To determine whether TNF also induces VEGFR2 phosphorylation, HUVEC were treated with TNF (1 ng/ml) or VEGF (10 ng/ml) for various time points (1, 2, 5, 15 min). VEGFR2 phosphorylation was determined by immunoprecipitation by anti-VEGFR2 followed by Western blot with anti-phosphotyrosine. Consistent with previous reports, VEGF rapidly induces activation of VEGFR2 (peaks at 1 min). In contrast, TNF induces phosphorylation of VEGFR2 in a delayed kinetics (peaks at 15 min) (Fig. 1c) and sustained for 2 h (not shown). To determine whether TNF, like VEGF, induced VEGFR2 autophosphorylation, HUVEC were treated with TNF (1 ng/ml for 15 min) or VEGF (10 ng/ml for 2 min) in the presence of various inhibitors as indicated. VEGFR2 phosphorylation induced by TNF (as well as VEGF) was specifically blocked by VEGFR2 inhibitors (but not by EGFR inhibitor) (Fig. 1d), suggesting that TNF induces a transactivation of VEGFR2 primarily through VEGFR2 autophosphorylation. Similar results were obtained for TNF-induced VEGFR2 and Etk activation in BAEC (data not shown). These data demonstrate a link between VEGFR2 transactivation and Etk activation by TNF. Association of Etk with VEGFR2 Stimulates a Reciprocal Activation between Etk and VEGFR2—To determine the mechanism by which TNF induces VEGFR2 transactivation, which is required for TNF-induced Etk activation, we examined if there is an association of Etk with VEGFR2. HUVEC were treated with TNF (1 ng/ml for 15 min) or VEGF (10 ng/ml for 2 min), and association of VEGFR2 with Etk was determined by immunoprecipitation with anti-VEGFR2 followed by Western blot with anti-Etk. TNF, but not VEGF, strongly induced Etk·VEGFR2 complex formation (Fig. 2a). Association of VEGFR2 and Etk was also observed in BAEC in response to TNF (data not shown). To determine effects of VEGFR2-Etk association on their phosphorylations, Etk and VEGFR2 were co-transfected into BAEC (which has a high transfection efficiency compared with HUVEC). Phosphorylation of VEGFR2 and Etk was determined by immunoprecipitation with anti-VEGFR2 or anti-Etk followed by Western blot with anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10). VEGFR2 showed a basal phosphorylation, likely resulting from an autoactivation upon overexpression. Co-expression of Etk-WT and the constitutively active Etk (Etk-SK containing the SH2 and the kinase domains) enhanced VEGFR2 tyrosine phosphorylation. In contrast, the dominant negative forms of Etk (Etk-KD with a single mutation in the kinase domain or Etk-DK with deletion of kinase domain) decreased autoactivation of VEGFR2 (Fig. 2b). As a control VEGFR2-KM (the kinase-inactive mutant) did not show either the basal or Etk-enhanced phosphorylation (Fig. 2b). These data suggest that Etk induces VEGFR2 autoactivation in Etk kinase-dependent manner. The dominant negative effects of Etk-KD and Etk-DK in EC likely resulted from inhibition of endogenous Etk activity induced by VEGFR2 overexpression. We then examined Etk phosphorylation by VEGFR2. FLAG-tagged Etk was transfected into BAEC in the presence VEGFR2-WT or VEGFR2-KM. Etk tyrosine phosphorylation was determined by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG followed by Western blot with anti-phosphotyrosine. Expression of VEGFR2-WT, but not VEGFR2-KM, induces phosphorylation of Etk (Fig. 2c), further confirming that VEGFR2 kinase activity is required for Etk phosphorylation. TNF Induces VEGFR2 and PI3K-dependent Activation of Akt but Not of PLC-γ—VEGF through VEGFR2 activates PI3K-Akt and PLC-γ, two independent signaling pathways were implicated in angiogenesis. To determine whether TNF transactivates VEGFR2, leading to activation of the downstream signaling pathways, BAEC were treated with TNF or VEGF as indicated. The phospho-specific antibodies were used to determine activation of Akt (Ser(P)-384) and PLC-γ (Tyr(P)-783) by Western blot. As a control, VEGF induces activation of both Akt and PLC-γ (Fig. 3a). In contrast, TNF activated Akt but not PLC-γ (Fig. 3a). To examine if TNF-induced Akt is dependent on VEGFR2 and PI3K, BAEC were pretreated with a specific inhibitor to VEGFR2 (SU1498, 10 μm), PI3K (LY294002, 30 μm), or (AG1478, 1 μm) for 30 min followed by TNF treatment (1 ng/ml for 15 min). TNF-induced Akt activation was blocked by the inhibitors specific to VEGFR2 and PI3K but not by the inhibitor to EGFR (Fig. 3b). These data indicate that TNF induces VEGFR2 transactivation sufficient to activate PI3K-Akt but not PLC-γ signaling. Previously we demonstrated that Etk is a critical mediator in TNF-induced EC migration and tube formation (23Pan S. An P. Zhang R. He X. Yin G. Min W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7512-7523Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To determine whether TNF/Etk-induced VEGFR2-PI3K-Akt signaling contributes to TNF-induced angiogenesis, we determined the effects of VEGFR2, PI3K, and Akt-specific inhibitors on TNF-induced EC migration in an in vitro migration assay. Monolayer culture of BAEC was subjected to wound injury and incubated for indicated times (12-24 h) in the presence of TNF (1 ng/ml) with specific inhibitors to EGFR (AG1478, 1 μm), VEGFR2 (30 μm SU1498 or 10 μm VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor), PI3K (LY294002, 30 μm), Akt (Akt inhibitor, 30 μm), or PLC-γ (U73122, 30 μm). EC migration was determined as described previously (23Pan S. An P. Zhang R. He X. Yin G. Min W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7512-7523Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). PI3K inhibitor caused EC death, consistent with the data that inhibition of PI3K synergizes TNF-induced EC apoptosis (33Madge L.A. Pober J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15458-15465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). EGFR inhibitor (AG1478) or PLC-γ inhibitor (U73122) did not block TNF-induced EC migration, consistent with the fact that AG1478 does not block TNF-induced VEGFR2-Akt pathway and that TNF does not induce PLC-γ activation. However, inhibitors to VEGFR2, PI3K, and Akt significantly block BAEC migration (Fig. 3c). These data demonstrate that VEGFR2, PI3K, and Akt are critical for TNF-induced EC migration. The Tyr(P)-1175 of VEGFR2 Is Not Critical for TNF-induced Akt Activation—To define the molecular mechanism by which TNF induces a distinct VEGFR2 downstream pathway from that by VEGF, we reasoned that TNF could induce a different site-specific phosphorylation of VEGFR2. To test this hypothesis, we examined TNF-induced VEGFR2 phosphorylation using the antibodies against site-specific phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)-1175 and Tyr(P)-1054/1059) on VEGFR2. We first verified the antibody specificity by mutant Flk-1 with mutations at specific phosphotyrosine residues. VEGFR2 mutants (VGFR2-WT, KM, Y1175F, Y801F/Y1175F, Y1054F/Y1059F) were transfected into 293T cells (where no endogenous VEGFR2 was detected), and total phosphorylation of VEGFR2 was detected by"

The cyclopentenone 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) has been reported to inhibit the activity of the transcription factor AP-1 in several experimental settings. We have explored the possibility of a direct interaction of 15d-PGJ2 with AP-1 proteins. Here we show that 15d-PGJ2 covalently modifies c-Jun and directly inhibits the DNA binding activity of AP-1. The modification of c-Jun occurs both in vitro and in intact cells as detected by labeling with biotinylated 15d-PGJ2 and mass spectrometry analysis. Attachment of the cyclopentenone prostaglandin occurs at cysteine 269, which is located in the c-Jun DNA binding domain. In addition, 15d-PGJ2 can promote the oligomerization of a fraction of c-Jun through the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds or 15d-PGJ2-bonded dimers. Our results identify a novel site of interaction of 15d-PGJ2 with the AP-1 activation pathway that may contribute to the complex effects of cyclopentenone prostaglandins on the cellular response to pro-inflammatory agents. They also show the first evidence for the induction of protein cross-linking by 15d-PGJ2. Cyclopentenone prostaglandins may interfere with cellular functions by multiple mechanisms.

However, the possibility of a direct interaction of cyPG with AP-1 proteins has not been explored. cyPG are reactive compounds that possess an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl group in the cyclopentenone ring. This group may react with sulfhydryl groups of cysteine residues of proteins by Michael's addition (20Noyori R. Suzuki M. Science. 1993; 259: 44-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), resulting in an alteration of protein function (16Cernuda-Morollón E. Pineda-Molina E. Cañada F.J. Pérez-Sala D. J. Biol.

Cys269 is located in close contact with DNA, and it is involved in the redox and nitric oxide-dependent regulation of DNA binding by means of specifically targeted S-glutathionylation (21Abate C.

Cys320 is located in the leucine zipper region and participates in c-Jun homo- or heterodimerization with proteins of the Fos family through the formation of an intermolecular disulfide bridge (24Glover J.N.

These observations unveil a novel PPAR-γ-independent mechanism that may contribute to the overall effect of cyPG on the AP-1 signaling pathway. Materials—Human recombinant c-Jun (full-length protein) was from Promega (Madison, WI).

Anti-c-Jun antibodies sc-044 and sc-045, anti-c-Fos sc-413, and anti-PPARγ sc-7196 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).

NIH-3T3 fibroblasts and RAW264.7 macrophages were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Treatment with 15d-PGJ2 was carried out in serum- and phenol red-free medium. Levels of 15d-PGJ2 in the cell culture supernatant of RAW264.7 macrophages, incubated in the absence or presence of 10 μg/ml bacterial lipopolysaccharide for 24 h, were assessed with an enzyme immunoassay from Assay Designs, Inc. (Ann Arbor, MI) following the instructions of the manufacturer. Preparation of Total Cell Lysates and Nuclear Extracts—Cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1% Nonidet P-40, or RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors for 30 min on ice. DNA was disrupted by several forced passes through a narrow needle, and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C. Nuclear extracts were obtained as described previously in detail (26Díaz-Cazorla M. Pérez-Sala D. Lamas S. J..Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 943-952PubMed Google Scholar). Protein content was determined using the BCA protein assay from Pierce for the cell lysates and the Bradford protein assay from Bio-Rad for the nuclear extracts. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—Sense and antisense oligonucleotides corresponding to the AP-1 site from the human prepro-endothelin-1 promoter (5′-TGTTGGTGACTAATAACAC-3′), located at -114 to -96 bases from the transcriptional start site, were annealed and labeled by incubation with [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described previously (26Díaz-Cazorla M. Pérez-Sala D. Lamas S. J..Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 943-952PubMed Google Scholar). Two ng of the labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides (∼20,000 cpm) were used per binding reaction. For EMSA of recombinant human c-Jun, 0.5 μm c-Jun treated with vehicle or 15d-PGJ2 was incubated for 30 min at r.t. in the presence of labeled oligonucleotide, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10 μg/ml poly(dI-dC) carrier in binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40). For EMSA of nuclear extracts, incubation reactions containing 4 μg of protein were carried out for 20 min on ice. Unless stated otherwise, the DTT final concentration was 0.1 mm. Protein-DNA complexes were separated by electrophoresis on non-denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. For competition experiments, a 200-fold excess of unlabeled AP-1 oligonucleotide or of an unrelated oligonucleotide of sequence 5′-GGAGAGGGGATTCCCTGCG-3′ was added to the binding reaction to ensure the specificity of the AP-1-DNA complexes. The intensity of the complexes formed was quantitated by densitometry of the autoradiographic exposures of gels. Analysis of the Interaction between 15d-PGJ2and Recombinant c-Jun in Vitro—Full-length recombinant human c-Jun or purified c-Jun fragments were incubated at a final concentration of 5 μm in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 45 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.14 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm DTT, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 1% glycerol in the presence of 15d-PGJ2, biotinylated 15d-PGJ2, or vehicle (Me2SO) for 2 h at r.t. The incubation mixtures were analyzed either by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry or by SDS-PAGE on 15% polyacrylamide gels followed by staining with Coomassie Blue or Western blot and detection of incorporated biotin with HRP-conjugated streptavidin and ECL (Amersham Biosciences). By using the c-Jun-(223-327) construct as an acceptor, the incorporation of biotinylated 15d-PGJ2 (from 2 to 20 μm) was proportional to the concentration of protein and PG, as estimated from the densitometry of the ECL exposures. MALDI-TOF Analysis—For analysis of control and 15d-PGJ2-treated c-Jun, trifluoroacetic acid was added to the incubation mixtures at a final concentration of 0.1%, and peptides were purified on ZipTip C18 (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The laser desorption/ionization experiments were performed on a BIFLEX III time-of-flight instrument (Bruker-Franzen Analytik, Bremen, Germany) operated in the positive mode. A saturated solution of sinapinic acid in acetonitrile/water (1:2) with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was used as the matrix. Equal volumes (0.5 μl) of the sample solution and the matrix were spotted on the target and air-dried. External calibration was performed, using the protein calibration standard II (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany), and samples were analyzed in the linear mode. For analysis of c-Jun monomer and dimer, 15d-PGJ2-treated c-Jun was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. Bands corresponding to the monomer and dimer species were excised and digested in-gel with trypsin. The resulting peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in the reflectron mode. A saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in acetonitrile/water (1:2) with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was used as the matrix. External calibration was performed, using the monoisotopic peaks of angiotensin (m/z 1046.5), adrenocorticotropic hormone (m/z 2,465.2), and the matrix (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, m/z 379) recorded in a single spectrum. Typically, 50-100 laser shots were summed into a single mass spectrum for analysis. Analysis of c-Jun Dimerization—Dimerization assays were performed essentially as described (22Klatt P. Pineda-Molina E. Lacoba M.G.D. Padilla C.A. Martínez-Galisteo E. Bárcena J.A. Lamas S. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1481-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). c-Jun-(223-327) was incubated under the conditions described above, except that DTT final concentration was 0.5 mm, in the absence or presence of 10 μm 15d-PGJ2 or 1 mm H2O2 for 30 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of iodoacetamide at a final concentration of 50 mm and a further 30-min incubation at r.t. The reversibility of dimer formation was assessed by addition of 10 mm DTT and incubation at r.t. for 30 min before iodoacetamide addition. Aliquots of the incubation mixtures containing 1.7 μg of protein were analyzed by non-reducing SDS-PAGE on 15% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 and analyzed by image scanning. Binding of Biotinylated 15d-PGJ2to c-Jun in Intact Cells—HeLa or NIH-3T3 cells were incubated in the presence of 10 μm biotinylated 15d-PGJ2 for 2 h. Cells were lysed in RIPA, and biotinylated proteins were purified by adsorption onto Soft-Link avidin (Promega, Madison, WI) following the manufacturer's instructions. The presence of c-Jun, or other proteins of interest, in the eluate was assessed by Western blot. In addition, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-c-Jun antibodies, and the incorporation of biotinylated 15d-PGJ2 into the immunoprecipitated protein was monitored by Western blot and detection with HRP-conjugated streptavidin. 15d-PGJ2Inhibits AP-1 DNA Binding Activity Both in Intact Cells and in Vitro—15d-PGJ2 has been reported to inhibit the transcriptional activity of AP-1 and to reduce its DNA binding activity in several cell types (11Ricote M. Li A.C. Willson T.M. Kelly C.J. Glass C.K. Nature. 1998; 391: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3260) Google Scholar, 19Sawano H. Haneda M. Sugimoto T. Inoki K. Koya D. Kikkawa R.

Lazar M.A. Pestell R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3057-3070Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), through PPARγ-dependent or -independent mechanisms. We were interested in studying whether the direct modification of AP-1 constituents by 15d-PGJ2 may be involved in the inhibitory effect. Treatment of HeLa cells with 10 μm 15d-PGJ2 reduced the DNA binding activity of AP-1, as evaluated by EMSA, by ∼30% (Fig. 1A). A similar inhibitory effect was evidenced in RMC (Fig. 1B). c-Jun and c-Fos proteins are the major components of the AP-1-DNA complex detected in nuclear extracts from cytokine-stimulated RMC as deduced from the blocking effect of specific antibodies (Fig. 1C). The decrease in AP-1-DNA complex formation elicited by 15d-PGJ2 was not the result of a reduction in the nuclear levels of c-Jun and c-Fos proteins, either in RMC (Fig. 1D) or in HeLa (not shown). Interestingly, the inhibitory effect could also be observed in a cell-free system by incubating nuclear extracts isolated from cytokine-stimulated cells with 15d-PGJ2in vitro (Fig. 2A). The extent of inhibition was similar when extracts from HeLa cells, in which AP-1 activity derives primarily from the c-Jun protein (28Bohmann D. Bos T.J. Admon A. Nishimura T. Vogt P.K. Tjian R. Science. 1987; 283: 1386-1392Crossref Scopus (953) Google Scholar, 29Diamond M.I. Miner J.N. Yoshinaga S.K. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1990; 249: 1266-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A), or from RMC (not shown) were used. In order to explore whether 15d-PGJ2 directly interacts with AP-1 proteins, we used recombinant c-Jun as a model. Incubation of c-Jun with 15d-PGJ2 led to a marked inhibition of the ability of the purified protein to bind DNA (Fig. 2B). These results show that 15d-PGJ2 directly interferes with c-Jun DNA binding.Fig. 215d-PGJ2 inhibits AP-1 DNA binding in vitro.A, nuclear extracts isolated from Ck-stimulated HeLa cells were split in several aliquots that were incubated in vitro in the presence of the indicated concentrations of 15d-PGJ2 for 30 min at room temperature, after which AP-1 DNA binding activity was analyzed by EMSA. When indicated, EMSA was performed in the presence of excess unlabeled AP-1 (comp) or unrelated oligonucleotides. B, recombinant human c-Jun protein was treated with 15d-PGJ2 for 30 min before being analyzed by EMSA. The intensity of the AP-1- or the c-Jun-c-Jun-DNA complex was estimated by image scanning and is expressed as percentage of the values obtained in the absence of PG. Similar results were obtained in three (A) or two (B) independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) 15d-PGJ2Forms a Covalent Adduct with c-Jun—To characterize the interaction between 15d-PGJ2 and c-Jun, we used a biotinylated 15d-PGJ2 derivative. Incubation of recombinant c-Jun with biotinylated 15d-PGJ2 led to the formation of a c-Jun-15d-PGJ2 adduct that was resistant to electrophoresis under denaturing conditions, as evidenced by Western blot and detection with HRP-conjugated streptavidin (Fig. 3A). Labeling of c-Jun was completely prevented by excess 15d-PGJ2, suggesting that this interaction is specific. The incorporation of 15d-PGJ2 was dose-dependent and could be detected with nanomolar concentrations of this cyPG (Fig. 3B). We have shown above that the interaction of 15d-PGJ2 with c-Jun precludes DNA binding. We then explored whether DNA binding by c-Jun would prevent incorporation of 15d-PGJ2. As shown in Fig. 3C, preincubation of c-Jun with an oligonucleotide containing the consensus site for binding of AP-1 markedly reduced incorporation of biotinylated 15d-PGJ2. In contrast, a mutated AP-1 oligonucleotide or an oligonucleotide with a consensus sequence for binding of NF-κB did not display this protective effect. These results suggest that the interaction of 15d-PGJ2 with c-Jun involves a region closely implicated in DNA binding. The region of c-Jun that is in close contact with DNA contains a cysteine residue (cysteine 269), which has been shown to be specifically targeted by S-glutathionylation under oxidative and nitrosative stress conditions, an interaction that results in inhibition of DNA binding (22Klatt P. Pineda-Molina E. Lacoba M.G.D. Padilla C.A. Martínez-Galisteo E. Bárcena J.A. Lamas S. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1481-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 23Klatt P. Pineda-Molina E. Lamas S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15857-15864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Preincubation of c-Jun with the thiol reagent iodoacetamide blocked incorporation of biotinylated 15d-PGJ2 (Fig. 3D). This confirms the requirement of free cysteine residues for attachment of this cyPG. Moreover, preincubation of c-Jun with oxidized glutathione or nitrosoglutathione under conditions previously found to specifically induce the glutathionylation of cysteine 269 also precludes binding of biotinylated 15d-PGJ2 (Fig. 3D). These results point to the involvement of cysteine 269 of c-Jun in the interaction with 15d-PGJ2. The interaction between 15d-PGJ2 and c-Jun was next studied by mass spectrometry. Untreated c-Jun-(223-327) showed a peak of m/z = 13,479, which corresponds to the calculated molecular mass of the hexahistidine-c-Jun-(223-327) construct (22Klatt P. Pineda-Molina E. Lacoba M.G.D. Padilla C.A. Martínez-Galisteo E. Bárcena J.A. Lamas S. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1481-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) and a peak of m/z = 6,768 (doubly charged) (Fig. 4A). Treatment of c-Jun with 15d-PGJ2 resulted in the appearance of a peak of m/z = 13,828 and its corresponding doubly charged peak. This mass is compatible with the formation of a covalent adduct between 15d-PGJ2 (mass 316.5) and c-Jun (expected m/z of the adduct 13,795.5), plus an excess of 32 Da that may be accounted for by oxidative modifications of two additional residues (expected m/z 13,827.5, see below). Interestingly, a peak of m/z = 13,634 was also detected in the 15d-PGJ2-treated c-Jun sample. This could be indicative of the formation of a c-Jun dimer containing one 15d-PGJ2 molecule, the doubly charged species of which would appear at that position of the spectrum (expected m/z = 13,637). Observation of the higher molecular mass region of the spectrum (Fig. 4B) allowed the detection of a species with m/z = 27,065, compatible with a c-Jun dimer, in the untreated sample. In contrast, in the 15d-PGJ2-treated c-Jun sample, two not completely resolved peaks were detected with m/z of 27,380 and 27,685, respectively, which represent increments with respect to the control c-Jun preparation of 315 and 620 Da, compatible with the incorporation of one and two 15d-PGJ2 molecules, respectively, into a putative c-Jun dimer. 15d-PGJ2Induces c-Jun Dimerization—Dimerization of c-Jun molecules through the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds has been shown to occur under oxidative conditions, and it has been proposed as one of the potential mechanisms involved in redox regulation of AP-1 DNA binding (30Bannister A.J. Cook A. Kouzarides T. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1243-1250PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the effect of 15d-PGJ2 on c-Jun dimer formation, we separated c-Jun monomers from covalently linked dimers by non-reducing SDS-PAGE, by a method established previously (22Klatt P. Pineda-Molina E. Lacoba M.G.D. Padilla C.A. Martínez-Galisteo E. Bárcena J.A. Lamas S. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1481-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 23Klatt P. Pineda-Molina E. Lamas S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15857-15864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Incubation of c-Jun constructs with 15d-PGJ2 induced the appearance of higher molecular weight species compatible with dimer and, in a smaller proportion, multimer formation (Fig. 5A). The electrophoretic mobility of the 15d-PGJ2-induced c-Jun dimer was different from that induced by H2O2 treatment. The 15d-PGJ2-induced dimer appeared as a diffuse doublet, whereas H2O2 treatment elicited predominantly the appearance of the lower component of this doublet. The proportion of dimer formation was 13 and 17% for 15d-PGJ2 and H2O2 treatment, respectively (estimates from three independent experiments). H2O2-induced c-Jun dimer formation could be reversed by treatment with excess DTT. In contrast, 15d-PGJ2-elicited dimerization was only partially abrogated by DTT. These observations suggest that 15d-PGJ2 may induce both reversible and non-reversible dimerization of c-Jun. cyPG may form Michael adducts with cysteine residues of glutathione or proteins. However, the possibility that 15d-PGJ2 may induce protein cross-linking has not been raised. To address this question we treated c-Jun with 15d-PGJ2 and assessed the appearance of higher molecular weight species by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (Fig. 5B). 15d-PGJ2 treatment induced the appearance of c-Jun dimer in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 5B, right panel). Concentrations as low as 2 μm 15d-PGJ2 induced significant dimer formation, and a maximal effect was attained with concentrations between 10 and 100 μm. c-Jun dimerization could be detected as early as 5 min after addition of 15d-PGJ2, and it was maximal after 2 h of incubation (not shown). The ability of 15d-PGJ2 to induce c-Jun dimerization may be due to the presence of several electrophilic carbons in the molecule, two of which can simultaneously form Michael adducts with thiols. In accordance with this, PGA1, which is also a cyclop"
https://openalex.org/W2013643452,"In A431 cells, depletion of cholesterol with methyl-β-cyclodextrin induced an increase in both basal and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated EGF receptor phosphorylation. This increase in phosphorylation was site-specific, with significant increases occurring at Tyr845, Tyr992, and Tyr1173, but only minor changes at Tyr1045 and Tyr1068. The elevated level of receptor phosphorylation was associated with an increase in the intrinsic kinase activity of the EGF receptor kinase, possibly as a result of the cyclodextrin-induced enhancement of the phosphorylation of Tyr845, a site in the kinase activation loop known to be phosphorylated by pp60src. Cholesterol and its enantiomer (ent-cholesterol) were used to investigate the molecular basis for the modulation of EGF receptor function by cholesterol. Natural cholesterol (nat-cholesterol) was oxidized substantially more rapidly than ent-cholesterol by cholesterol oxidase, a protein that contains a specific binding site for the sterol. By contrast, the ability of nat- and ent-cholesterol to interact with sphingomyelins and phosphatidylcholine and to induce lipid condensation in a monolayer system was the same. These data suggest that, whereas cholesterol-protein interactions may be sensitive to the absolute configuration of the sterol, sterol-lipid interactions are not. nat- and ent-cholesterol were tested for their ability to physically reconstitute lipid rafts following depletion of cholesterol. nat- and ent-cholesterol reversed to the same extent the enhanced phosphorylation of the EGF receptor that occurred following removal of cholesterol. Furthermore, the enantiomers showed similar abilities to reconstitute lipid rafts in cyclodextrin-treated cells. These data suggest that cholesterol most likely affects EGF receptor function because of its physical effects on membrane properties, not through direct enantioselective interactions with the receptor. In A431 cells, depletion of cholesterol with methyl-β-cyclodextrin induced an increase in both basal and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated EGF receptor phosphorylation. This increase in phosphorylation was site-specific, with significant increases occurring at Tyr845, Tyr992, and Tyr1173, but only minor changes at Tyr1045 and Tyr1068. The elevated level of receptor phosphorylation was associated with an increase in the intrinsic kinase activity of the EGF receptor kinase, possibly as a result of the cyclodextrin-induced enhancement of the phosphorylation of Tyr845, a site in the kinase activation loop known to be phosphorylated by pp60src. Cholesterol and its enantiomer (ent-cholesterol) were used to investigate the molecular basis for the modulation of EGF receptor function by cholesterol. Natural cholesterol (nat-cholesterol) was oxidized substantially more rapidly than ent-cholesterol by cholesterol oxidase, a protein that contains a specific binding site for the sterol. By contrast, the ability of nat- and ent-cholesterol to interact with sphingomyelins and phosphatidylcholine and to induce lipid condensation in a monolayer system was the same. These data suggest that, whereas cholesterol-protein interactions may be sensitive to the absolute configuration of the sterol, sterol-lipid interactions are not. nat- and ent-cholesterol were tested for their ability to physically reconstitute lipid rafts following depletion of cholesterol. nat- and ent-cholesterol reversed to the same extent the enhanced phosphorylation of the EGF receptor that occurred following removal of cholesterol. Furthermore, the enantiomers showed similar abilities to reconstitute lipid rafts in cyclodextrin-treated cells. These data suggest that cholesterol most likely affects EGF receptor function because of its physical effects on membrane properties, not through direct enantioselective interactions with the receptor. Cholesterol is an essential component of mammalian membranes. It alters membrane fluidity, thickness, curvature, and permeability (1Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

In addition, cholesterol is an important constituent of lipid rafts, specialized membrane microdomains that are rich in cholesterol, sphingolipids, and saturated phospholipids (1Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar, 6Jones D.H. Barber K.R. VanDerLoo E.W. Grant C.W.

Through interactions with cholesterol, the acyl chains of phospholipids in lipid rafts pack tightly together and extend fully to create a liquid-ordered phase (7Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol.

A subset of plasma membrane proteins selectively partition into the ordered environment of lipid rafts (1Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Because of the large number of signaling proteins that are localized to lipid rafts, it has been postulated that these domains serve as regulatory platforms for some signal transduction pathways (11Anderson R.G.W.

A variety of studies have shown that EGF receptor function is affected by the levels of cholesterol, which is present at higher concentrations in lipid rafts than in the surrounding plasma membrane (16Pike L.J. Han X. Chung K.-N. Gross R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2075-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Depletion of cholesterol from cells leads to an increase in both basal (17Chen X.

The enhanced receptor tyrosine phosphorylation appears to be due to a rise in the intrinsic kinase activity of the receptor (19Pike L.J. Casey L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10315-10322Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Cholesterol depletion has also been shown to result in an increase in the number of cell-surface EGF-binding sites (19Pike L.J. Casey L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10315-10322Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 20Roepstorff K. Thomsen P. Sandvig K. van Deurs B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18954-18960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) The increased EGF binding seems to result from an unmasking of receptors that are present on the surface of cells, but are unable to bind EGF in the presence of elevated levels of cholesterol (19Pike L.J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 18954-18960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In addition to altering the intrinsic binding and kinase activity of the EGF receptor, cholesterol also modulates signaling events directly downstream of the EGF receptor. For example, depletion of cholesterol impairs the ability of EGF to stimulate phosphatidylinositol turnover (21Pike L.J. Miller J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22298-22304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). By contrast, cholesterol depletion leads to the enhancement of EGF-stimulated MAPK activity (22Furuchi T. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21099-21104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that cholesterol plays a significant role in modulating EGF receptor-mediated signaling. However, the molecular basis for these effects of cholesterol on EGF receptor function is not known. Cholesterol could affect EGF receptor function indirectly by influencing the physical properties of the membrane, such as thickness, fluidity, or lateral domain formation (3Burger K. Gimpl G. Fahrenholz F. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1577-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 23Gimpl G. Burger K. Fahrenholz F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10959-10974Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Indeed, depletion of cholesterol leads to the loss of the EGF receptor from low density lipid raft domains (19Pike L.J. Casey L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10315-10322Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 21Pike L.J. Miller J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22298-22304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), suggesting that some of the effects of cholesterol on EGF receptor function could be mediated through the ability of the sterol to promote lateral membrane domain formation. Alternatively, cholesterol could bind specifically to the receptor, regulating its activity through allosteric mechanisms. In this study, we further characterize the effects of cholesterol depletion on EGF receptor function and address the question of whether the effects of cholesterol are due to membrane level effects of the compound or result from specific molecular recognition of the sterol. We report here that the enhanced basal and hormone-stimulated phosphorylation of the EGF receptor that occurs upon cellular cholesterol depletion is due to a selective increase in the phosphorylation of a subset of the phosphorylatable tyrosine residues in the C-terminal tail of the receptor. Using natural cholesterol (nat-cholesterol) and its enantiomer (ent-cholesterol), we provide evidence that the effects of cholesterol on EGF receptor function are most likely due to non-enantio-selective effects of the sterol on membrane properties such as fluidity and the ability to form rafts. EGF was prepared by the method of Savage and Cohen (24Savage R.C. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7609-7611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody PY20 was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Polyclonal antibodies against Tyr(P)845, Tyr(P)992, Tyr(P)1045, and Tyr(P)1068 of the EGF receptor were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). A monoclonal antibody against Tyr(P)1173 of the EGF receptor was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The anti-flotillin monoclonal antibody was from BD Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA). Polyvinylidene fluoride membranes were from Osmonics, Inc. (Westborough, MA). The enhanced chemiluminescence kit was from Amersham Biosciences. The cholesterol CII and free cholesterol E assay kits were from Wako Bioproducts (Richmond, VA). Methyl-β-cyclodextrin was from Aldrich. Egg sphingomyelin and (2S,3R,4E)-2-stearoylaminooctadec-4-ene-3-hydroxy-1-phosphocholine (N-stearoylsphingomyelin) were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). All other chemicals were from Sigma. Cell Culture—A431 cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 7% newborn calf serum and 3% fetal calf serum. Cells were incubated overnight in DMEM containing 0.1% newborn calf serum prior to use. Chinese hamster ovary cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were incubated overnight in Ham's F-12 medium containing 0.1% fetal calf serum prior to use. Synthesis of ent-Cholesterol—ent-Cholesterol was prepared from ent-desmosterol through a minor modification of methods described previously (25Westover E.J. Covey D.F. Steroids. 2003; 68: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Silyl-protected ent-desmosterol was subjected to catalytic hydrogenation (300 p.s.i. H2, 15 min, platinum/carbon) and then treated to remove the silyl protecting group to give ent-cholesterol (m.p. 147.5-148 °C, [α]20 = +40.0 C (C, 1.0, in CHCl3)). Fig. 1 shows the structures of nat- and ent-cholesterol. Preparation of Cholesterol·Methyl-β-cyclodextrin Complexes—Cholesterol·methyl-β-cyclodextrin complexes were synthesized as described by Klein et al. (26Klein U. Gimpl G. Fahrenholz F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13784-13793Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Briefly, 30 mg of nat- or ent-cholesterol was dissolved in 400 μl of isopropyl alcohol/chloroform (2:1, v/v). Methyl-β-cyclodextrin (1 g) was dissolved in 11 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and heated to 80 °C with stirring. The solubilized sterol was added in small aliquots to the heated solution over 30 min. Cholesterol Depletion and Repletion—For cholesterol depletion, cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in DMEM containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.2) and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (DMEM/BSA) and the indicated concentration of methyl-β-cyclodextrin. Control cells were incubated in the same medium lacking cyclodextrin. To replete cells with cholesterol following cyclodextrin treatment, cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in DMEM/BSA containing the indicated concentration of sterol·cyclodextrin complex. For both cholesterol depletion and repletion, the tissue culture plates were swirled every 10 min to ensure continuous mixing of the components in the medium. Cholesterol Assay—Cells were washed twice with 1 ml of cold PBS, and lipids were extracted with 2 ml of hexane/isopropyl alcohol (3:2, v/v) for 1 h at room temperature. The organic extract was removed from the cell monolayer, and the solvent was removed in a SpeedVac. The lipid residue was solubilized in 1 ml of the cholesterol CII assay kit buffer solution. As reported previously (27Luker G.D. Pica C.M. Kumar A.S. Covey D.F. Piwnica-Worms D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7651-7661Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), color generation from nat-cholesterol standards reached a plateau after 5 min at 37 °C and remained stable through 60 min at this temperature, whereas ent-cholesterol standards required 60 min at 37 °C for complete color development. Samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C prior to measuring absorbance at 505 nm. After lipid extraction, the residual cell monolayers were solubilized with 10 mm sodium borate and 1% SDS. Aliquots of the solubilized material were then used for determination of total protein content using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay. Cholesterol Oxidase Assay—Assay of cholesterol oxidase was carried out utilizing the free cholesterol E assay kit. The free cholesterol E assay reagent contains cholesterol oxidase plus several additional components (peroxidase, 4-aminoantipyrene, and DEHSA (3-((3,5-dimelhoxyphenyl)ethylamino)-2-hydroxy-1-propanoic acid monosodium salt)) that permit the colorimetric detection of the hydrogen peroxide produced upon oxidation of cholesterol. For assay, 5 μg of either nat- or ent-cholesterol in complex with cyclodextrin was placed in a glass tube. One ml of the free cholesterol E assay kit buffer solution was then added. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. The absorbance of the samples at 600 nm was measured immediately. Equal concentrations of free cholesterol and cyclodextrin-complexed cholesterol gave equivalent absorbance measurements in this assay. Cell-surface EGF Binding—A431 cells were grown to confluence in 24-well dishes and incubated overnight in DMEM containing 0.1% fetal calf serum. After treatment to alter cholesterol content, cultures were washed with ice-cold PBS and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C in 1 ml of DMEM/BSA, 50 pm125I-EGF, and increasing concentrations of unlabeled EGF. At the end of the incubation, cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS. Cell monolayers were dissolved in 1 ml of 1 m NaOH and counted for 125I. Data were analyzed using the LIGAND computer program (28Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar). Stimulation of Cells with EGF and Preparation of Cell Lysates—Cells in 35-mm dishes were treated to alter cholesterol content as outlined above. At the end of the incubation, EGF was added to the medium for 5 min. Cells were then washed with cold PBS and lysed by scraping the monolayers into 300 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, and 5 mm EDTA) containing 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μm sodium o-vanadate, 10 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were incubated on ice for 10 min with periodic vortexing and then clarified by centrifugation at 12000 × g for 10 min. Aliquots were then taken for determination of total protein concentration. Receptor tyrosine phosphorylation was determined by Western blotting. EGF Receptor Dephosphorylation—To assess the rate of EGF receptor dephosphorylation, cholesterol-depleted or cholesterol-repleted cells were stimulated with 1.25 nm EGF for 5 min at 37 °C. The medium was removed, and cells were washed with cold PBS. Residual cell surface-bound EGF was removed by incubating the cells twice for 2 min in 50 mm glycine and 100 mm NaCl (pH 4.0) on ice. After an additional wash with cold PBS, warmed DMEM/BSA was added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. Cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer as usual. Receptor tyrosine phosphorylation was determined by Western blotting. Membrane Preparation and in Vitro Phosphorylation Assays—Cells were treated to alter cholesterol levels and then lysed by homogenization in 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.2). Membranes were pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 12000 × g and resuspended in 70 mm β-glycerophosphate, 250 mm NaCl, and 25% glycerol (pH 7.2). Assays were carried out in a final volume of 50 μl containing 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 μm ATP, 12 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 20 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate, 100 μm sodium o-vanadate, and 1 μg of membrane protein. When included, EGF was added at a final concentration of 25 nm. Membranes were incubated with growth factor for 5 min at room temperature. Assays were begun by the addition of ATP and metal ions. After incubation at 30 °C for 15 s, reactions were stopped by the addition of 50 μl of SDS sample buffer. Samples were boiled, run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and analyzed by Western blotting. Preparation of Lipid Rafts—All manipulations were performed at 4 °C. After appropriate treatments, one 150-mm plate of A431 cells was washed five times with PBS and scraped into 0.4 ml of 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 20 mm Tris (pH 7.8). Cells were lysed by passage through a 23-gauge needle 10 times. The lysates were sonicated five times for 15 s using a Branson 250 sonicator set at maximal power output for a microtip. After centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min, the post-nuclear supernatant was mixed with an equal volume of 85% sucrose in MES-buffered saline (25 mm MES (pH 6.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA) and placed in the bottom of a centrifuge tube. A 15-35% discontinuous sucrose gradient was formed above the lysate by adding sucrose-containing buffers as follows: 2 ml of 35% sucrose, 2 ml of 28% sucrose, 2 ml of 22% sucrose, and 4 ml of 15% sucrose, all in MES-buffered saline. The gradient was centrifuged for 18 h at 210,000 × g in an SW 41 rotor (Beckman Instruments). After discarding the uppermost 4 ml, the gradient was fractionated into eight 1-ml fractions. Then, 100-μl aliquots of each fraction were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. Western Blotting—Samples containing 25-100 μg of protein mixed with SDS sample buffer were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with 10% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature (PY20, Tyr(P)1173, DB-1, flotillin) or overnight at 4 °C (Tyr(P)845, Tyr(P)992, Tyr(P)1045, and Tyr(P)1068). Antibody detection was carried out using enhanced chemiluminescence. Langmuir Film Balance—Water for the subphase buffer was purified by reverse osmosis, activated charcoal adsorption, and mixed-bed deionization; passed through a Milli-Q UV Plus system (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA); and filtered through a 0.22-μm Millipak 40 membrane. Subphase buffer (pH 6.6) consisting of 10 mm potassium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.2% sodium azide was stored under argon until used. Glassware was acid-cleaned and rinsed thoroughly with deionized water and then with hexane/ethanol (95:5). Solvent purity was verified by dipole potential measurements prior to use (29Smaby J.M. Brockman H.L. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1991; 58: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Final stock concentrations of sterols were determined gravimetrically using a Cahn microbalance (Model 4700), and those of sphingomyelins by lipid phosphate analysis (30Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Surface pressure-molecular area isotherms were measured using a computer-controlled, Langmuir-type balance, described in detail previously (31Li X.-M. Momsen M.M. Smaby J.M. Brockman H.L. Brown R.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5954-5963Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 32Li X.-M. Momsen M.M. Brockman H.L. Brown R.E. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 1535-1546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and calibrated according to the equilibrium spreading pressures of known lipid standards (33Momsen W.E. Smaby J.M. Brockman H.L. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1990; 135: 547-552Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The subphase was maintained at a fixed temperature using a thermostatted circulating water bath. The film balance was housed in an isolated laboratory supplied with clean air by a Bioclean air filtration system equipped with charcoal and HEPA filters. The trough was separately enclosed under humidified argon and cleaned by passage through a seven-stage series filtration setup consisting of an Alltech activated charcoal gas purifier, a LabClean filter, and a series of Balston disposable filters consisting of two adsorption (carbon) and three filter units (93 and 99.99% efficiency at 1 μm). Film balance features that contribute to isotherm reproducibility include automated lipid spreading via a modified high pressure liquid chromatography autoinjector, automated surface cleaning by multiple barrier sweeps between runs, and highly accurate reproducible setting of the subphase level by an automated aspirator. Lipids were mixed and spread (51.67-μl aliquots) from stock solutions dissolved in hexane/ethanol (95:5). Films were compressed at a rate of ≤4 Å2/molecule/min after an initial delay period of 4 min. Standard errors of the resulting force-area isotherms were routinely <2%. Site-specific Effect of Cholesterol on EGF Receptor Phosphorylation—A431 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of methyl-β-cyclodextrin for 30 min to remove cholesterol. Lysates were prepared and analyzed for receptor tyrosine phosphorylation by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As shown in Fig. 2A, cholesterol depletion increased basal tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor up to 11-fold. The dose of methyl-β-cyclodextrin yielding maximal stimulation was 7.5 mm when confluent cultures were used. However, when significantly subconfluent cells were used, the optimal concentration of methyl-β-cyclodextrin was 2-3-fold less than this. This indicates that it is the ratio of cells to reagent that is important rather than the absolute concentration of reagent added. In addition to enhancing basal EGF receptor phosphorylation, cholesterol depletion also increased EGF-stimulated receptor phosphorylation at all doses of EGF tested (Fig. 2B). At the maximal dose of EGF, receptor phosphorylation was enhanced from 1.2- to 2.0-fold in different experiments. The EC50 for EGF was ∼2 nm and was essentially unchanged following cholesterol depletion. Thus, the increase in EGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor following cholesterol depletion appears to be due to a change in the maximal level of phosphorylation rather than to a change in the EC50 for EGF. The increase in EGF receptor phosphorylation was associated with only a modest increase in the number of cell-surface EGF-binding sites (Fig. 3). Scatchard analysis indicated the presence of a single class of EGF-binding sites on control cells that exhibited a Kd of ∼10 nm. Cyclodextrin treatment resulted in an ∼10% increase in the number of EGF-binding sites present on A431 cells with no change in the binding affinity of EGF. The EGF receptor contains several tyrosine residues that become phosphorylated in response to EGF. To determine whether all sites were similarly affected by cholesterol depletion, EGF receptor phosphorylation was analyzed using a panel of antibodies that recognize specific phosphorylated tyrosine residues on the receptor. The data in Fig. 4 show that cholesterol depletion differentially affected the phosphorylation of individual tyrosine residues. Cholesterol depletion routinely enhanced the EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of tyrosines 845, 992, and 1173. By contrast, the level of hormone-stimulated phosphorylation of tyrosines 1045 and 1068 was relatively unaffected by removal of cholesterol. In all cases, cholesterol depletion did not significantly alter the EC50 for receptor phosphorylation. These data indicate that cholesterol depletion induces site-specific changes in phosphorylation of the EGF receptor. Comparison of the Enantiomers of Cholesterol—The effect of cholesterol depletion on EGF receptor phosphorylation could be due either to an effect of cholesterol on the physical properties of the membrane or to direct interaction of the sterol with the EGF receptor or another protein that regulates receptor phosphorylation. Theoretically, the use of cholesterol enantiomers should allow discrimination between these two possibilities. Because the physical properties of nat-cholesterol and its enantiomer, ent-cholesterol, are identical, their effects on general membrane properties should not be significantly different. However, because the two enantiomers have mirror image shapes, they should interact differently with molecules, such as proteins, that contain a stereospecific binding site for the sterol. To determine whether cholesterol affects EGF receptor function due to general membrane level effects or to direct binding to a protein, the enantiomer of cholesterol was synthesized (25Westover E.J. Covey D.F. Steroids. 2003; 68: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and used as a tool to probe the effects of cholesterol on EGF receptor function. The ability of nat- and ent-cholesterol to interact with lipids and proteins was first compared in model systems to characterize the behavior of these two enantiomers in sterol-protein and sterol-lipid interactions. To assess the characteristics of nat- and ent-cholesterol when interacting specifically with a protein, the ability of cholesterol oxidase to use these enantiomers as substrates was compared. As shown in Fig. 5, nat-cholesterol was rapidly oxidized by cholesterol oxidase in a standard cholesterol assay system. The oxidation of nat-cholesterol was essentially complete within 30 s under these conditions and showed a t1/2 of <10 s. By contrast, ent-cholesterol was much more slowly oxidized by cholesterol oxidase under the same conditions. Approximately 30 min were required for complete oxidatio"

To restore light sensitivity, the all-trans-retinaldehyde must be chemically re-isomerized by an enzyme pathway called the visual cycle. Rpe65, an abundant protein in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and a homolog of β-carotene dioxygenase, appears to play a role in this pathway. Rpe65-/- knockout mice massively accumulate all-trans-retinyl esters but lack 11-cis-retinoids and rhodopsin visual pigment in their retinas. Mutations in the human RPE65 gene cause a severe recessive blinding disease called Leber's congenital amaurosis. The function of Rpe65, however, is unknown. Here we show that Rpe65 specifically binds all-trans-retinyl palmitate but not 11-cis-retinyl palmitate by a spectral-shift assay, by co-elution during gel filtration, and by co-immunoprecipitation. Using a novel fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) binding assay in liposomes, we demonstrate that Rpe65 extracts all-trans-retinyl esters from phospholipid membranes. Assays of isomerase activity reveal that Rpe65 strongly stimulates the enzymatic conversion of all-trans-retinyl palmitate to 11-cis-retinol in microsomes from bovine RPE cells. Moreover, we show that addition of Rpe65 to membranes from rpe65-/- mice, which possess no detectable isomerase activity, restores isomerase activity to wild-type levels. Rpe65 by itself, however, has no intrinsic isomerase activity. These observations suggest that Rpe65 presents retinyl esters as substrate to the isomerase for synthesis of visual chromophore. This proposed function explains the phenotype in mice and humans lacking Rpe65. Photon capture by a rhodopsin pigment molecule induces 11-cis to all-trans isomerization of its retinaldehyde chromophore.

This proposed function explains the phenotype in mice and humans lacking Rpe65. Light perception in vertebrates is mediated by a group of G protein-coupled receptors called the opsins. Most opsin pigments contain 11-cis-retinaldehyde (11cRAL) 1The abbreviations used are: 11cRAL, 11-cis-retinaldehyde; IMH, isomerohydrolase; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; Ab, antibody; FRET, fluorescent resonance energy transfer; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; atROL, all-trans-retinol; atRAL, all-trans-retinaldehyde; atRE, all-trans-retinyl ester; RPE, retinal pigment epithelium; 11cRP, 11-cis-retinyl palmitate; CRALBP, cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein; LCA, Leber's congenital amaurosis. 1The abbreviations used are: 11cRAL, 11-cis-retinaldehyde; IMH, isomerohydrolase; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; Ab, antibody; FRET, fluorescent resonance energy transfer; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; atROL, all-trans-retinol; atRAL, all-trans-retinaldehyde; atRE, all-trans-retinyl ester; RPE, retinal pigment epithelium; 11cRP, 11-cis-retinyl palmitate; CRALBP, cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein; LCA, Leber's congenital amaurosis. as the light-absorbing chromophore. Absorption of a photon induces 11-cis to all-trans isomerization of the chromophore, resulting in the activated species, metarhodopsin II. After a brief period, metarhodopsin II decays to yield apo-rhodopsin and free all-trans-retinaldehyde (atRAL). Before light sensitivity of the pigment can be restored, the atRAL must be chemically re-isomerized to 11cRAL by a metabolic pathway called the visual cycle. Most steps in this pathway take place within cells of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) adjacent to the photoreceptors. The key step in this pathway is all-trans to 11-cis re-isomerization of the retinoid, which is catalyzed by an enzyme activity called isomerohydrolase (IMH). IMH has been shown to use fatty acyl esters of retinol as a substrate (1.Moiseyev G. Crouch R.K. Goletz P. Oatis Jr., J. Redmond T.M. Ma J.X.

Leber's congenital amaurosis (LCA) is a severe and relatively common autosomal recessive disease that results in blindness at birth. LCA is frequently caused by mutations in the RPE65 gene (5.Gu S.M. Thompson D.A. Srikumari C.R.S. Lorenz B. Finckh U. Nicoletti A. Murthy K.R. Rathmann M. Kumaramanickavel G. Denton M.J. Gal A. Nat.

Eriksson U. Allen R.A. Peterson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14978-14985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rpe65 has high affinity for phospholipid membranes but contains no membrane-spanning domains (8.Bavik C.O. Busch C. Eriksson U. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23035-23042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Tsilou E. Hamel C.P. Yu S. Redmond T.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 346: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Mice with a knockout mutation in rpe65 massively accumulate all-trans-retinyl esters (atRE) in their RPE and have no detectable 11-cis-retinoids (10.Redmond T.M. Yu S. Lee E. Bok D. Hamasaki D. Chen N. Goletz P. Ma J.X. Crouch R.K. Pfeifer K. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Photoreceptors in rpe65-/- mice are morphologically normal but contain only apo-rhodopsin instead of rhodopsin pigment. These observations led to speculation that Rpe65 may be IMH. In the current study, we sought to define the function of Rpe65 and its relationship to IMH. We show by several approaches that Rpe65 specifically binds all-trans-retinyl palmitate (atRP), the most abundant retinyl ester in RPE cells (11.Futterman S. Andrews J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 81-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further, we present data suggesting that atRP bound to Rpe65 is the substrate for IMH. Expression of Bovine Rpe65 in Baculovirus-infected Sf9 Cells—We cloned the complete coding sequence of bovine Rpe65 into pFastBac bacmid (Invitrogen) and used it to transfect Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells following the manufacturer's procedure. Following infection, adherent cells were lysed in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.0, 1% CHAPS, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The detergent-soluble fractions were analyzed by gel filtration (Zorbax GF-250) on an Agilent 1100 series liquid chromatograph (mobile phase = 20 mm Na2HPO4, 130 mm NaCl, flow = 1 ml/min, 280 nm detection). Proteins eluting at Mr 158-43 kDa were collected and concentrated using Centricon 30,000 molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) ultrafiltration devices (Millipore). The retained proteins were separated on an ÄKTA FPLC (Amersham Biosciences) using a Mono Q anion exchange column equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-OAc, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm NaOAc, flow = 1 ml/min. A gradient to 0.5 m NaOAc over 60 min was initiated 10 min after sample injection. Collected gradient fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting to confirm the presence of Rpe65. For reconstitution studies, partially purified Rpe65 or control proteins from non-expressing Sf9 cells were exchanged into reconstitution buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) using 30,000 MWCO ultrafiltration devices. In some experiments the detergent-soluble fractions were used without further purification. Bovine Rpe65 Antibody—The synthetic peptide from bovine Rpe65, NFITKINPETLETIK, was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and injected (∼500 μg) subcutaneously as an emulsion with complete Freund' s adjuvant (Invitrogen) into New Zealand White rabbits. Intramuscular boosts were done at 3-week intervals using incomplete Freund' s adjuvant. Total IgG was purified from whole serum on a protein A column. The IgG fraction (15 mg), was immobilized on 1 ml of Affi-Gel 10 matrix according to the manufacturer's instructions. SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—Protein samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 4-12% gradient gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) in a semidry transblot apparatus (BioRad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After blocking in 5% nonfat milk, blots were reacted with the anti-Rpe65 peptide Ab at 1:2000 dilution. Bands were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (Kirkegaard & Perry laboratories). Retinoid Preparation and Synthesis—Retinoids were obtained from Sigma (atRP, atROL, atRAL, and β-carotene) or were synthesized from 11cRAL (11cRP and 11cROL) according to published procedures (12.Bridges C.D. Alvarez R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 463-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). All retinoids were purified by HPLC to >98% purity (ratio of sample peak area to total chromatogram peak area) and quantified by UV-vis spectroscopy using published molar extinction coefficients (13.Garwin G.G. Saari J.C. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 313-324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purified retinoid stocks were stored in ethanol at -80 °C prior to use. Spectrophotometric Analysis of Retinoid Binding—Divided quartz cuvettes (containing two compartments separated by a quartz window) were used in mixing studies to detect retinoid binding. An absorbance baseline (400-250 nm) was established in which each cell contained a protein sample (0.5-1.0 mg/ml of detergent-solubilized Rpe65 in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS) in one compartment and the test retinoid (atRP, atROL, β-carotene, 11cRP, 11cROL, atRAL, or 11cRAL) at 40 μm in the same buffer in the adjacent compartment. The sample cell was mixed and absorbance measurements were taken at the indicated times using the un-mixed cell as a reference (temp = 30 °C). Control studies were performed in an identical fashion using either heat-denatured protein or lipid-free bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml). Gel Filtration and Immunoprecipitation—[1-14C]palmitate-atRP (80 μm, 2 μCi) was added (in DMF at 0.25% v/v) to detergent-solubilized proteins from either non-transfected Sf9 cells or Sf9 cells expressing Rpe65. Samples were rocked overnight at 4 °C and centrifuged at 45,000 × g, 30 min to remove particulate debris. Sample aliquots from the binding mixtures were analyzed by gel filtration chromatography (described above) with on-line photodiode array and radiometric ([14C]) detection (525TR FSA, Packard Instruments) and in immunoprecipitation studies. Briefly, 50 μl of Rpe65 IgG-Affi-Gel 10 beads were incubated with 30 μl of sample (∼50 μg of protein) in phosphate-buffered saline/0.3% CHAPS at 4 °C overnight. Similar incubations were performed on control samples containing retinoid alone (C1) and protein alone (C2). Following incubation, the mixtures were centrifuged at 15,000 × g, 30 s and the supernatant (unbound) fractions were collected. The beads were washed three times with 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline/0.3% CHAPS and resuspended in 50 μl of of 2× Laemmli buffer (4% SDS). Aliquots of each fraction were taken for scintillation counting and for Western blot analysis. Radoactivity in C1 was used to correct for nonspecific retinoid binding, while C2 was used to confirm immunolabeling of Rpe65. Preparation of BODIPY-PC and Pyranine Proteoliposomes—Proteoliposomes were prepared according to published methods (14.Evans K.O. Lentz B.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1241-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Chloroform stocks of dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) and dilinoleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DLPC) (Avanti Polar Lipids) were mixed (85:15 mol/mol, respectively) and dried under a stream of argon. Identical samples containing 0.5 mol% of the phosphatidylcholine analog, β-BODIPY 500/510 C12-HPC, (Molecular Probes) were treated in a similar fashion. The dried phospholipid (PL) residues were resuspended in hexane and placed on dry ice. Methanol was added to 5% v/v, and the samples were placed under high vacuum for 12-16 h. Partially purified Rpe65 or control proteins (30,000 MWCO retentates from non-transfected Sf9 cells) were added to resuspend the PL residues. Samples that did not contain BODIPY-PC were supplemented with pyranine (Molecular Probes) at 2 mm in reconstitution buffer. Samples were agitated for 2 h at room temperature. Proteoliposomes were prepared from the resulting multilamellar vesicles (MLV) by the extrusion method (15.Mayer L.D. Hope M.J. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 858: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar, 16.Lentz B.R. Carpenter T.J. Alford D.R. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5389-5397Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The MLV suspensions were extruded through 5-μm polycarbonate membranes (Nucleopore Corp) using a Liposofast lipid extruder (Avestin). Vesicles were fractionated and washed by repeated centrifugation (233,000 × g, 45 min) and resuspension in reconstitution buffer. In some experiments, vesicles were fractionated by gel filtration as described above. The washed proteoliposomes (final phospholipid concentration = 2.5-3.6 mm, final protein concentration = 0.8-1.5 mg/ml) were used immediately or stored at 4 °C for 48 h before use. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) Studies and Fluorescence Microscopy—The binding/internalization of atRP in Rpe65 and control proteoliposomes was determined by FRET analysis where the emission of atRP (400-500 nm) was used to excite the BODIPY-PC or pyranine fluorescent dyes. atRP was added (in DMF, 0.1% v/v) to the washed proteoliposomes at 2 mol% relative to total phospholipids, and the samples were rocked at 33 °C. Aliquots of the binding mixtures were removed at the indicated times and analyzed on an Agilent liquid chromatograph equipped with an on-line fluorescence detector (flow rate = 0.5 ml/min; temp = 25 °C). The instrument executed two injections with a 1-min interval between injections. During the first injection, excitation was set to 325 ± 10 nm; emission was set to either 520 ± 10 nm for BODIPY-PC proteoliposomes or 510 ± 10 nm for pyranine proteoliposomes. For the second injection, excitation was set to 460 ± 10 nm, emission acquisition parameters were unchanged. Spectral data for all runs were acquired in the region of 400-600 nm to confirm FRET spectra. The association of atRP with liposomes containing either Sf9-Rpe65 or Sf9 protein was examined by phase contrast fluorescence microscopy on a Zeiss Axiovert 135 inverted microscope using a Plan-Neofluor 40×/0.75 objective and appropriate filters (DAPI/Hoechst/AMCA, 360 ± 40 nm exciter, 460 ± 25 nm emitter) (Chroma Technology). Preparation of Proteoliposomes—Microsomal proteins were prepared from homogenates of bovine RPE as previously described (17.Mata N. Radu R. Clemmons R. Travis G. Neuron. 2002; 36: 69-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Microsomal membranes (5-10 mg/ml) were treated with 365-nm UV light (5 min on ice) to destroy endogenous retinoids, and were homogenized in solubilization buffer (25 mm Tris OAc, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μm leupeptin, 0.5% Genapol X-100). The sample was rocked for 1 h at 4 °C followed by centrifugation at 175,000 × g, 35 min. Solubilization buffer in the supernatant fraction was exchanged for reconstitution buffer as described above (final protein concentration = 2-4 mg/ml, final detergent concentration = 0.25%). The protein sample was added to an equal volume of PL suspension containing dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine/dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine/phosphatidyl inositol/phosphatidic acid (25:60:5:10, mol/mol, respectively in reconstitution buffer, 10 mm total lipid) to obtain a final protein concentration of 1-2 mg/ml and a lipid concentration of 5 mm. Apo-CRALBP (18.Crabb J.W. Carlson A. Chen Y. Goldflam S. Intres R. West K.A. Hulmes J.D. Kapron J.T. Luck L.A. Horwitz J. Bok D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 746-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) was added to a final concentration of 10 μm, and the sample was agitated at 37 °C for 1 h. The sample was treated with SM-2 Bio-Beads to remove the detergent and generate proteoliposomes (19.Levy D. Bluzat A. Seigneuret M. Rigaud J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1025: 179-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 20.Menon A.K. Watkins W.E. Hrafnsdottir S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 241-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Vesicles were fractionated and washed as described above. To prepare Sf9-atRP and Rpe65-atRP proteoliposomes, mixtures containing varied amounts of solubilized protein from either non-expressing Sf9 cells (1-3 mg/ml) and atRP (20-60 μm) or Rpe65-expressing Sf9 cells (3-5 mg/ml) and atRP (20-60 μm) were prepared and mixed at 4 °C for 1 h. Sf9-atRP proteoliposomes were generated by adding the mixed samples to an equal volume of the PL suspension followed by detergent removal and vesicle fractionation as described above for bovine RPE proteoliposomes. Rpe65-atRP proteoliposomes were prepared similarly except that the binding mixtures were first applied to a gel filtration column to obtain the atRP-bound Rpe65 complex (see fraction 18, Fig. 2A). The recovered fraction was added to an equal volume of the PL suspension and vesicles were generated as described. Liposomes containing only atRP were prepared by mixing various concentrations of atRP (10-60 nmol in chloroform) with a similar PL mixture (5 mm) before solvent evaporation and resuspension in reconstitution buffer. To facilitate sample comparison in enzyme assays, vesicles containing similar amounts of protein (0.2-0.4 mg/ml) and/or atRP (3-5 μm) were used. Proteoliposome Fusion and Enzyme Assays—The ability of Sf9-atRP-, Rpe65-atRP-, or atRP-liposomes to serve as substrate vehicles for enzymes in proteoliposomes containing solubilized bovine RPE microsomal protein was determined by inducing fusion of the vesicles with polyethylene glycol (21.Haque M.E. McCoy A.J. Glenn J. Lee J. Lentz B.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14243-14251Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 22.Haque M.E. McIntosh T.J. Lentz B.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4340-4348Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). A 200-μl aliquot of the respective substrate liposomes was added to 200 μl of RPE proteoliposomes, and the samples were preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C. Prewarmed polyethylene glycol was added to 10% w/v, and incubation was resumed for 1.5 h at 37 °C. Samples were quenched with 200 μl of chilled methanol and 100 μl of water. Retinoids were extracted into hexane (2 × 500 μl) and analyzed by HPLC as previously described (17.Mata N. Radu R. Clemmons R. Travis G. Neuron. 2002; 36: 69-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Effects of Rpe65 on IMH Activities in Mouse RPE—Wild-type (C57BL/6) and strain-matched rpe65-/- knockout mice (10.Redmond T.M. Yu S. Lee E. Bok D. Hamasaki D. Chen N. Goletz P. Ma J.X. Crouch R.K. Pfeifer K. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar) were reared in 12-hr light/dark cycles at 20-40 lux for 5 weeks. Mice (n = 12 per group) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (200 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) and sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Eyes were removed and the anterior segments, vitreous and retina were discarded. The remaining RPE/eyecups were homogenized in BTP buffer (12 eyecups/ml, 10 mm BTP, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μm leupeptin, 2 mm CaCl2) using a Duall glass-glass homogenizer, and centrifuged at 175,000 × g for 15 min. The resulting pellets were homogenized in BTP buffer containing 0.1% CHAPS (w/v), and the centrifugation step was repeated. The supernatant fraction, which contained ∼95% of the endogenous retinoids, was decanted, and the sedimented protein was homogenized in BTP buffer containing 1% CHAPS followed by brief sonication (3 × 5 s bursts, 20 watt output) and mixing (45 min at 4 °C). The samples were centrifuged at 175,000 × g for 30 min. The soluble fractions were removed and subjected to gel filtration to remove excess detergent, as described above (final CHAPS concentration = 0.2%). The recovered protein was concentrated and assayed for IMH activity plus or minus added Rpe65 from expressing Sf9 cells. Briefly, 400 μg of each protein sample (100 μl) were added to a reaction mixture containing 25 μm apo-CRALBP in BTP buffer (100 μl) and either 100 μg of Rpe65 (50 μl) or 50 μl of reconstitution buffer. 1 μl of a 400-μm solution of atRP in DMF was added to the reaction mixtures (final atRP concentration = 1.6 μm), the reaction mixtures were sonicated as described above, and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with vigorous shaking. Control reactions to measure potential catalytic activity of Rpe65 were performed as above except that the RPE proteins were substituted with heat-denatured protein. [3H]atROL or [3H]atRP were used as substrate. All reactions were quenched with 100 μl of methanol and the retinoids extracted into 600 μl of hexane. Solvent was removed under a stream of nitrogen and the sample residues were resuspended in 10% dioxane/hexane. Retinoids were analyzed by HPLC as described on an Agilent Zorbax RX-SIL column (4.6 × 250 mm) and a mobile phase of 10% dioxane/hexane, flow = 1 ml/min. Determination of Vesicle Size—Average diameters of the lipid vesicles used in FRET analyses and in fusion assays were determined by quasi-elastic light scattering (QELS). QELS measurements were performed on a Nicomp 380 Submicron Particle Sizer equipped with a helium-neon laser (532 nm) and a computer-controlled auto-correlator (Particle Sizing Systems). Size determinations were made after 15-20 min of analysis time. These data were compared with data obtained from polystyrene microspheres of known size (Duke Scientific Corporation). Interaction between Rpe65 and atRP Induces a Change in the UV Absorption Spectrum—A specific interaction between an apoprotein and its light-absorbing ligand invariably induces a change in the absorption spectrum. An indication of this change is the presence of one or more nodal isosbestic points in overlaid spectra from before and after interaction of the ligand with the protein (23.Poole R.K. Bashford C.L. Harris D.A. Bashford C.L. Spectrophotometry and Spectrofluorimetry: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1987: 23-489Google Scholar). To test for possible binding of atRE to Rpe65, we added samples of atRP and Rpe65 separately to the two chambers of a divided cuvette. In this and all subsequent experiments, we used baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells as a source of Rpe65. These cells contained no detectable retinoids, hence the starting Rpe65 protein was in the apo or unbound state. UV absorption spectra were obtained at different times after sample mixing in the cuvette. Incubation of atRP with Rpe65 caused a reduction in UV absorption at 355 nm and an increase at 280 nm, resulting in an isosbestic point at 295 nm (Fig. 1A). The absorption maximum (λmax) of atRP dispersed in binding buffer was 355 nm. Thus, incubation with Rpe65 reduced the UV absorption of free atRP. We repeated this mixing experiment, substituting the geometric isomer, 11-cis-retinyl palmitate (11cRP) for atRP. Here, no change in UV absorption was observed during incubation with Rpe65 (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the interaction with atRP is specific for the all-trans isomer. We used the same spectral assay to test for possible interactions between Rpe65 and atRAL or 11cRAL. Similar to 11cRP, we observed no changes in the UV-absorption spectra of the retinaldehydes upon incubation with Rpe65 (not shown). We also tested for an interaction between Rpe65 and β-carotene. Again, incubation with Rpe65 resulted in no change in the absorption spectrum (not shown). However, incubation of Rpe65 with atROL induced a hyperchromatic shift in near-UV absorption with appearance of an isosbestic point at 285 nm (Fig. 1C). As a positive control, we performed similar spectral analysis on 11cROL and cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein (apo-CRALBP), which specifically binds 11cROL and 11cRAL (24.Saari J.C. Bredberg D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7618-7622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, we observed an isosbestic point in the overlaid spectra (Fig. 1D). Together these results suggest that Rpe65 interacts with atRP and atROL, but does not interact with 11cRP, atRAL, 11cRAL, or β-carotene. Co-elution of Rpe65 and atRP by Gel Filtration and Immunoprecipitation—If Rpe65 binds atRE, atRP should co-elute with Rpe65 during gel filtration chromatography. We incubated a CHAPS detergent extract of Rpe65-expressing Sf9 cells with an excess of [14C]atRP. As a control, we incubated a CHAPS extract of non-expressing Sf9 cells with [14C]atRP. We separated both samples by gel filtration chromatography and monitored atRP elution by measuring 14C-disintegrations per min (dpm) with an online flow-scintillation analyzer. We also collected 1-min fractions for analysis by SDS-PAGE. The [14C]atRP eluted in two peaks (Fig. 2A). The first peak was in the column void volume, similar to the profile observed when [14C]atRP in CHAPS was chromatographed alone (not shown) or with a CHAPS extract of non-expressing Sf9 cells (Fig. 2A). The second peak of 14C-dpm was in fractions 17-19 of the Rpe65-expressing sample and contained the preponderance of eluted Rpe65 by protein gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2B). No second peak of 14C-dpm was observed in the sample derived from non-expressing Sf9 cells. We obtained UV absorption spectra at the two peaks of 14C-dpm in the Rpe65 experiment. The spectrum from the first peak showed a λmax of 325 nm (Fig. 2A, inset), characteristic of atRP in CHAPS. The spectrum from the second peak showed a λmax of 280 nm, characteristic of proteins, with less intense absorption at 325 nm (Fig. 2A, inset). These data suggest that atRP binds to Rpe65. To confirm that atRP binds specifically to Rpe65, we prepared an immunoaffinity matrix containing immobilized IgG from antisera against Rpe65. We incubated CHAPS detergent extracts of Rpe65-expressing and non-expressing Sf9 cells with an excess of 14C-labeled atRP. Both samples were incubated with the immunoaffinity matrix. We analyzed the unbound, wash, and eluted fractions for 14C-dpm. We also did immunoblot analysis of the unbound and eluted fractions with the Rpe65 antibody. Most 14C-dpm were in the unbound fraction due to the excess of added [14C]atRP (Fig. 2C). This fraction also showed considerable Rpe65 immunoreactivity due to incomplete binding to the immunoaffinity matrix. Importantly, significant 14C-dpm (∼15%) were present in the Rpe65-containing eluted fraction. 14C-dpm were scarcely detectable in the equivalent fraction of the non-expressing control sample (Fig. 2C). We confirmed chemical integrity of the eluted [14C]atRP by HPLC analysis following gel filtration and immunoprecipitation. Together these results identify Rpe65 as the protein binding partner for atRP. Since atROL showed spectral evidence for an interaction with Rpe65 (Fig. 1C), we repeated the gel filtration experiment, substituting [3H]atROL for [14C]atRP. Here, we observed no co-elution of 3H-dpm with Rpe65 (not shown). This suggests that the interaction of atROL with Rpe65 may be too weak to survive chromatographic separation. Rpe65 Solubilizes atRP and Facilitates Its Removal from Membranes—Retinyl esters are virtually insoluble in aqueous solutions and thus do not exchange between membrane compartments (25.Ho M.T.

https://openalex.org/W1972693783,"Dedicated machinery for N-terminal methionine excision (NME) was recently identified in plant organelles and shown to be essential in plastids. We report here the existence of mitochondrial NME in mammals, as shown by the identification of cDNAs encoding specific peptide deformylases (PDFs) and new methionine aminopeptidases (MAP1D). We cloned the two full-length human cDNAs and showed that the N-terminal domains of the encoded enzymes were specifically involved in targeting to mitochondria. In contrast to mitochondrial MAP1D, the human PDF sequence differed from that of known PDFs in several key features. We characterized the human PDF fully in vivo and in vitro. Comparison of the processed human enzyme with the plant mitochondrial PDF1A, to which it is phylogenetically related, showed that the human enzyme had an extra N-terminal domain involved in both mitochondrial targeting and enzyme stability. Mammalian PDFs also display non-random substitutions in the conserved motifs important for activity. Human PDF site-directed mutagenesis variants were studied and compared with the corresponding plant PDF1A variants. We found that amino acid substitutions in human PDF specifically altered its catalytic site, resulting in an enzyme intermediate between bacterial PDF1Bs and plant PDF1As. Because (i) human PDF was found to be active both in vitro and in vivo, (ii) the entire machinery is conserved and expressed in most animals, (iii) the mitochondrial genome expresses substrates for these enzymes, and (iv) mRNA synthesis is regulated, we conclude that animal mitochondria have a functional NME machinery that can be regulated."
https://openalex.org/W2039994681,"A tight balance between synaptic vesicle exocytosis and endocytosis is fundamental to maintaining synaptic structure and function. Calcium influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels is crucial in regulating synaptic vesicle exocytosis. However, much less is known about how Ca2+ regulates vesicle endocytosis or how the endocytic machinery becomes enriched at the nerve terminal. We report here a direct interaction between voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and endophilin, a key regulator of clathrin-mediated synaptic vesicle endocytosis. Formation of the endophlin-Ca2+ channel complex is Ca2+ dependent. The primary Ca2+ binding domain resides within endophilin and regulates both endophilin-Ca2+ channel and endophilin-dynamin complexes. Introduction into hippocampal neurons of a dominant-negative endophilin construct, which constitutively binds to Ca2+ channels, significantly reduces endocytosis-mediated uptake of FM 4-64 dye without abolishing exocytosis. These results suggest an important role for Ca2+ channels in coordinating synaptic vesicle recycling by directly coupling to both exocytotic and endocytic machineries."
https://openalex.org/W2040399605,"Ca2+-dependent activator protein for secretion (CAPS) 1 is an essential cytosolic component of the protein machinery involved in large dense-core vesicle (LDCV) exocytosis and in the secretion of a subset of neurotransmitters. In the present study, we report the identification, cloning, and comparative characterization of a second mammalian CAPS isoform, CAPS2. The structure of CAPS2 and its function in LDCV exocytosis from PC12 cells are very similar to those of CAPS1. Both isoforms are strongly expressed in neuroendocrine cells and in the brain. In subcellular fractions of the brain, both CAPS isoforms are enriched in synaptic cytosol fractions and also present on vesicular fractions. In contrast to CAPS1, which is expressed almost exclusively in brain and neuroendocrine tissues, CAPS2 is also expressed in lung, liver, and testis. Within the brain, CAPS2 expression seems to be restricted to certain brain regions and cell populations, whereas CAPS1 expression is strong in all neurons. During development, CAPS2 expression is constant between embryonic day 10 and postnatal day 60, whereas CAPS1 expression is very low before birth and increases after postnatal day 0 to reach a plateau at postnatal day 21. Light microscopic data indicate that both CAPS isoforms are specifically enriched in synaptic terminals. Ultrastructural analyses show that CAPS1 is specifically localized to glutamatergic nerve terminals. We conclude that at the functional level, CAPS2 is largely redundant with CAPS1. Differences in the spatial and temporal expression patterns of the two CAPS isoforms most likely reflect as yet unidentified subtle functional differences required in particular cell types or during a particular developmental period.

Regulated secretion of neurotransmitters, hormones, or peptides from neurons and neuroendocrine cells is mediated by the Ca2+-dependent fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane (1Sudhof T.C.

Despite some striking differences between SCVs and LDCVs with respect to their structure, release kinetics, and recycling, the two vesicle types employ a very similar set of proteins for the regulation and execution of their Ca2+-regulated fusion with the plasma membrane. Such conserved components of the secretory machinery of SCVs and LDCVs include (i) the SNARE complex components synaptobrevin, SNAP-25, and syntaxin, which mediate the fusion reaction, (ii) the putative exocytotic Ca2+-sensor synaptotagmin, (iii) the SNARE complex regulators soluble NSF-attachment protein and NSF, or (iv) the syntaxin regulator Munc18 (1Sudhof T.C.

In contrast to the considerable number of proteins that function in both the SCV and LDCV secretory pathways, only very few proteins were proposed to be more or less specifically involved in the secretion of only one type of vesicle. One such protein is CAPS1, which was discovered as an essential cytosolic factor in Ca2+-triggered norepinephrine release from cracked PC12 cells where it is required for a secretory step that follows ATP-dependent priming (7Hay J.C.

CAPS1 is a 145-kDa protein that contains a central PH domain whose binding to acidic phospholipids in the plasma membrane is essential for CAPS1 function (10Grishanin R.N. Klenchin V.A. Loyet K.M.

In addition, a C2 domain precedes the central PH domain (10Grishanin R.N. Klenchin V.A. Loyet K.M. Kowalchyk J.A. Ann K. Martin T.F. J. Biol.

Not all aspartic acid residues essential for Ca2+ binding to C2 domains are conserved in the CAPS1 C2 domain, indicating that this domain may not serve as a Ca2+ sensor. Genetic studies on the invertebrate orthologues of CAPS1 in Caenorhabditis elegans (12Avery L. Bargmann C.I. Horvitz H.R. Genetics. 1993; 134: 455-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Drosophila melanogaster (5Renden R. Berwin B. Davis W. Ann K. Chin C. Kreber R. Ganetzky B. Martin T.F. Broadie K. Neuron. 2001; 31: 421-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) demonstrated an important role of CAPS isoforms in the secretion of a subset of neurotransmitters. Antibody inhibition studies in chromaffin cells (13Elhamdani A. Martin T.F. Kowalchyk J.A. Artalejo C.R. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7375-7383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and melanotrophs (14Rupnik M.

A specific function of CAPS1 for LDCV exocytosis was deduced from the findings that norepinephrine but not glutamate release from permeabilized synaptosomes is dependent on CAPS1 (15Tandon A.

Floor E. Martin T.F. Neuron. 1998; 21: 137-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Currently, the molecular mechanism of CAPS1 function in LDCV secretion is unknown. In the present study, we report the identification, cloning, and comparative characterization of a second mammalian CAPS isoform, CAPS2. Our data demonstrate that CAPS isoforms in higher mammals compose a family of two structurally and functionally highly related proteins with striking differences in their spatial and temporal expression patterns. Cloning of Human CAPS2 cDNA—Protein profile searches for proteins containing MHD domains identified a murine cDNA fragment (GenBank™/EBI accession no. AF000969) with high homology to rat CAPS1 (11Koch H. Hofmann K. Brose N. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Subsequent searches in human and murine genome databases (Celera) showed that the initially identified murine cDNA fragment corresponded to an as yet unidentified second CAPS gene, CAPS2. The complete coding sequences of murine and human CAPS2 were assembled from genomic data base sequences (Celera; GA_x6K02T2P3E9, murine; GA_x5YUV32W188, human). Based on this sequence information, the human CAPS2 cDNA was amplified by PCR from a human brain cDNA preparation (Clontech), cloned into pCRII-TOPO (Invitrogen), and sequenced using the dideoxy chain termination method with dye terminators on an ABS 373 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). A eukaryotic expression vector encoding full-length human CAPS2 (pcDNA3-hCAPS2) was generated in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). A corresponding full-length rat CAPS1 expression vector (pcDNA3-rCAPS1) was generated from a published CAPS1 plasmid (8Walent J.H. Porter B.W. Martin T.F. Cell. 1992; 70: 765-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignments were calculated with Lasergene (DNAS-TAR) and improved manually. Northern Blots—Rat multiple tissue RNA blots (Clontech) were hybridized at high stringency with uniformly labeled probes derived from rat CAPS1 cDNA (bp 152–997; GenBank™/EBI accession no. U16802), and mouse CAPS2 cDNA (bp 10–744; GenBank™/EBI accession no. AF000969). In Situ Hybridization—In situ hybridization experiments with mouse brain and adrenal gland sections were performed as described previously (17Augustin I. Betz A. Herrmann C. Jo T. Brose N. Biochem. J. 1999; 337 (Pt. 3): 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Antisense oligonucleotides representing the following sequences were chosen as probes: bp 1696–1740 of mouse CAPS1 cDNA (GenBank™/EBI accession no. NM_012061) and bp 461–505 of mouse CAPS2 cDNA (GenBank™/EBI accession no. AF000969). Images were captured with a Camedia C-3030 Zoom digital camera (Olympus). Generation of Antibodies Against CAPS1 and CAPS2—Recombinant GST-rCAPS1 (218–390) fusion protein was generated by using the expression plasmid pGEX-rCAPS1 (218–390), which encodes rat CAPS1 residues 218–390 in frame with GST (18Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). A polyclonal antibody directed against rat CAPS1 was generated with GST-rCAPS1 (218–390) fusion protein as the antigen. The antiserum was affinity-purified on GST-rCAPS1 (218–390) and immobilized on an Immobilon-P polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore) (19Olmstedt J.B. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 134: 467-472Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The antibody was mono-specific for CAPS1 and cross-reacted with the murine orthologue, as demonstrated by Western blots with wild-type and CAPS1-deficient brain tissue from a deletion mutant mouse. 2D. Speidel, C. Enk, K. Reim, F. Varoqueaux, and N. Brose, unpublished data. A polyclonal antibody directed against murine CAPS2 was raised to a peptide with the sequence H2N-CQKLKRSQNSAFLD-CONH2 (Eurogentec), which corresponds to residues 309–321 of mouse CAPS2 and is completely conserved in human CAPS2. For affinity purification of the antibody, 10 mg of peptide antigen were conjugated to 0.5 g of thiopropyl-Sepharose 6B (Amersham Biosciences). The peptide-conjugated resin was incubated with 5 ml of antiserum and then washed extensively, first with 0.1 m Tris (pH 8.0), followed by 0.5 m NaCl/0.1 M Tris (pH 8.0) and 0.01 m Tris (pH 8.0). Bound antibodies were eluted with 0.2 m glycine (pH 2.7)/0.1 M NaCl, followed by 0.2 m glycine (pH 2.3)/0.1 M NaCl, and immediately neutralized with Tris-HCl. Two ml of each eluate were tested on Western blots. The fraction with the highest titer and the lowest cross reactivity was then concentrated with Centricon 30 (Amicon). Western Blots—For Western blot sample preparation, tissues and brain regions from adult rats as well as whole mouse brains from different developmental stages were removed and homogenized in 25 mm Hepes/KOH (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA (pH 8.0), 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin. After determination of protein concentrations, samples were dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed using standard procedures (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar, 21Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44933) Google Scholar). Immunoreactive bands were visualized with enhanced chemoluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). The following antibodies were used: polyclonal antisera to CAPS1 (1:5000) and CAPS2 (1:500), and monoclonal antibodies to synaptophysin 1 (1:10,000; Synaptic Systems), N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunit 1 (1:10,000) (22Brose N. Gasic G.P. Vetter D.E. Sullivan J.M. Heinemann S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22663-22671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and actin (1:6000; SIGMA). Subcellular Fractionation—Subcellular fractionations were prepared essentially as described previously (23Jones D.H. Matus A.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 356: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). They were designated as follows: H, homogenate; P1, nuclear pellet; P2, crude synaptosomal pellet; P3, light membrane pellet; S3, cytosolic fraction; LP1, lysed synaptosomal membranes; LP2, crude synaptic vesicle fraction; LS2, cytosolic synaptosomal fraction; S1, supernatant after synaptosome sedimentation; and LS1, supernatant after LP1 sedimentation. Immunocytochemistry—Animals were deeply anesthetized with tribromoethanol. After a brief rinse with normal saline (50–100 ml), each rat was perfused transcardially with 300 ml of cold 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) for 10 min. The brains were quickly removed, placed in 20% sucrose/0.02 M potassium PBS for cryoprotection, and frozen on dry ice. Sagittal 10-μm frozen cryostat sections were collected and blocked in PBS containing 2% normal goat serum and 0.25% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature. Thereafter, sections were incubated with polyclonal antibodies to CAPS1 (1:2000) or CAPS2 (1:2000) and monoclonal antibodies to GAD65 (1:1000, Chemicon) or synaptophysin (1:500) at 4 °C for 16 h. The antibodies were diluted in PBS that contained 2% normal goat serum and 0.25% Triton X-100. After 3 rinses in PBS, the sections were incubated with Alexa488- or Alexa568-labeled goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories) at room temperature. The sections were then rinsed in PBS and mounted with 1.5% N-propyl gallate. Digital images were captured with an LSM510 laser scanning microscope (Zeiss) and analyzed with the LSM510 software. Ultrastructural Analysis—Adult male rats were perfused with saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde/0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer. The brains were taken out, and 40-μm-thick vibratome sections were collected and stained for CAPS1 as indicated above, except that a biotinylated secondary antibody was used (1:300, Vector Laboratories), followed by an avidin-biotin-peroxidase amplification (Vectastain ABC, Vector Laboratories), a 3,3′-diaminobenzidine labeling reaction, and silver intensification (24Brandstatter J.H. Lohrke S. Morgans C.W. Wassle H. J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 370: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Sections were extensively washed, osmicated for 1 h (1% OsO4 in phosphate buffer), dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol and propylene oxide, and embedded in Durcupan (Durcupan ACM, Fluka) by a 48-h polymerization at 60 °C. Light-gold ultra-thin sections were cut, contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and observed in a LEO 912AB transmission electron microscope (Zeiss). Digital images were captured with a ProScan CCD camera and analyzed with the Analysis version 3.2 software (Soft Imaging System). Preparation of PC12 Cell Ghosts and Measurement of [3H]NE Release—The preparation of PC12 cell ghosts and the measurement of [3H]NE release were performed as described (8Walent J.H. Porter B.W. Martin T.F. Cell. 1992; 70: 765-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The techniques and protocols involved in overexpression of CAPS proteins in COS-1 cells, preparation of cytosol fractions from these cells, and [3H]NE release assays were published previously (10Grishanin R.N. Klenchin V.A. Loyet K.M. Kowalchyk J.A. Ann K. Martin T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22025-22034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic expression vectors encoding full-length rat CAPS1 and mutant CAPS1-bearing mutations in the PH domain (R558D/K560E/K561E) were generated in pcDNA3.1/myc-His B (Invitrogen). A full-length human CAPS2 expression vector was generated in pEF6/myc-His C (Invitrogen). All recombinant proteins were expressed in COS-1 cells, purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen), analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining, and quantified with known amounts of CAPS1. Structure and Conservation of CAPS Isoforms—By using MH domain profiles, we identified CAPS1 and a closely related murine protein fragment (mCPD2; GenBank™/EBI accession no. AF000969) as distant relatives of members of the Munc13 family of synaptic vesicle priming proteins (11Koch H. Hofmann K. Brose N. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Detailed analysis of the murine and human genomic Celera databases revealed that mCPD2 is part of a novel CAPS gene product, CAPS2. No evidence for additional CAPS genes in the current murine and human genomic databases was obtained. We assembled the complete murine and human CAPS2 coding sequences from genomic sequence data (Celera: GA_x6K02T2P3E9, murine; GA_x5YUV32W188, human) and then used the deduced coding sequences to design specific PCR primers and amplify the full-length human CAPS2 cDNA from a brain cDNA preparation. Three types of PCR amplicons were obtained, subcloned, and sequenced. They differed by the absence or presence of a 333-bp fragment in the 5′ half and/or of a 120-bp fragment in the 3′ half of the cDNA (Fig. 1). Because these regions correspond to individual exons in the murine and human genomic sequences, they are likely to represent alternatively spliced sequences. In the course of the present study, a murine CAPS2 cDNA sequence was deposited in GenBank™/EBI under accession no. AY072800. This sequence is almost identical to the sequence we deduced from genomic data and was used for subsequent comparative sequence analyses. Comparison of CAPS sequences between species showed that the respective murine and human CAPS1 and CAPS2 orthologues are very similar to each other, with over 95% identity at the amino acid level. The corresponding sequence identity between the homologous isoforms was about 80% (Fig. 1). All CAPS proteins are large multidomain proteins containing a central PH domain and an MH domain in their C-terminal half. The novel mouse and human CAPS2 isoforms contain 1275 residues (146 kDa) and 1296 residues (148 kDa), respectively, and are slightly smaller than their CAPS1 counterparts which contain 1382 residues (156 kDa) and 1353 residues (153 kDa), respectively. Together, these findings show that CAPS isoforms in mammals form a small family of two highly homologous proteins with identical domain structure. Expression Patterns of CAPS mRNAs—To determine the expression patterns of CAPS mRNAs in different tissues, we hybridized RNA blots loaded with poly(A)+-enriched RNA from different rat tissues at high stringency with probes representing rat CAPS1 (bp 152–997; GenBank™/EBI accession no. U16802) and mouse CAPS2 (bp 10–744; GenBank™/EBI accession no. AF000969) cDNA fragments. CAPS1 mRNA was detected almost exclusively in brain. In contrast, CAPS2 mRNA was expressed most strongly in brain but was also detectable in lung, liver, kidney, and testis (Fig. 2). The sizes of the CAPS1 and CAPS2 mRNAs were very similar and in the range of 5.0 kb. Thus, the CAPS protein family, like most other protein families involved in regulated exocytosis, is composed of brain-specific and more ubiquitously expressed isoforms. Cellular Expression Patterns of CAPS mRNAs in the Central Nervous System—So far, our data demonstrated that the two CAPS isoforms are most strongly expressed in the central nervous system. On the other hand, CAPS1 was initially discovered in the context of LDCV secretion from PC12 cells (7Hay J.C. Martin T.F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 8Walent J.H. Porter B.W. Martin T.F.

To determine the cellular expression pattern of CAPS mRNAs in the brain and adrenal, we performed in situ hybridization experiments using representative mouse organs. We found that in the adult mouse brain, CAPS1 mRNA is strongly expressed in almost all nerve cells of the brain, although it is absent from glial cells (Fig. 3). In contrast, CAPS2 mRNA expression in the adult brain is less uniform, with high mRNA levels in cerebellum, cortex, olfactory bulb, CA1/CA2 regions of the hippocampus, and dentate gyrus, and levels below the detection limit in the CA3 regions of the hippocampus, striatum, thalamus, superior and inferior colliculi, and brain stem (Fig. 3). A similar picture emerged with respect to the brains of newborn mice, where CAPS1 mRNA was strongly expressed in almost all neuron-rich areas, whereas CAPS2 mRNA expression was less uniform and strongest in the developing hippocampus and cerebellum (Fig. 3). In the adult adrenal gland, CAPS1 mRNA expression was restricted to the chromaffin cells of the medulla (Fig. 3). CAPS2 mRNA levels in the adrenal were at the detection limit of our in situ hybridization assays (Fig. 3). These findings demonstrate that the two CAPS isoforms are differentially expressed in the central nervous system and neuroendocrine cells. Thus, despite their high degree of homology, the two CAPS variants may only be partially redundant in mammals. Expression Patterns of CAPS Proteins—For the isoform-specific detection of CAPS proteins, we generated polyclonal antisera to CAPS1 and CAPS2 using a GST fusion protein with a highly conserved CAPS1 sequence and a highly conserved CAPS2 peptide sequence as antigens (see “Materials and Methods”). The antibodies were found to be isoform-specific, as determined by Western blots of HEK293 cells overexpressing full-length rat CAPS1 or human CAPS2, where single bands of 150 kDa (CAPS1) and 140 kDa (CAPS2) were detected (data not shown). Moreover, the antibody to CAPS1 readily cross-reacted with mouse CAPS1, as determined in Western blot analyses of wild-type and CAPS1-deficient brain samples (data not shown).2 Likewise, the antibody to CAPS2, which was raised against a completely conserved mouse/human peptide, cross-reacted with mouse and rat CAPS2, as illustrated by the specific detection of a 140-kDa protein and a slightly smaller band in mouse and rat tissue samples (Fig. 4). The smaller bands at ∼120 kDa that were detected in several tissues by our CAPS1 and CAPS2 antibodies do not originate from degradation (not shown) and most likely represent splice variants (Fig. 1). In agreement with the data obtained in RNA blot experiments, CAPS1 protein was found to be predominantly expressed in brain and, at lower levels, in pancreas and adrenal gland. No CAPS1 was detected in liver, kidney, testis, lung, heart muscle, spleen, and skeletal muscle (Fig. 4A). In contrast, high CAPS2 protein expression was not only detected in brain but also in liver and testis. CAPS2 levels in adult adrenal gland and lung were just above the detection limit of the Western blot assay, whereas no CAPS2 was detected in pancreas, kidney, heart muscle, spleen, and skeletal muscle (Fig. 4A). Within the central nervous system, CAPS1 protein expression was found to be uniformly strong in all brain regions except the spinal cord, where only low amounts were detected. CAPS2 protein expression, on the other hand, was strongest in the cerebellum, moderate in brain stem and thalamus, weak in hippocampus, hypothalamus, and superior/inferior colliculi, and at or below the detection limit in homogenates from all other brain regions tested (Fig. 4B). Analysis of cortical subcellular fractions showed a very similar subcellular distribution of CAPS1 and CAPS2 protein. Both isoforms are largely soluble, with a membrane-bound pool associated mainly with vesicular (LP2) and less with synaptic plasma membrane fractions (LP1) (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, the soluble pools of CAPS1 and CAPS2 were strongly enriched in synaptic fractions (LS2) (Fig. 4C). During brain development, CAPS1 protein expression is similar to that of synaptic markers. Expression is first detectable late in embryogenesis (embryonic day 14) and increases to reach a plateau about 20 days after birth, when most synapses have been formed. A smaller CAPS1 immunoreactive band, most likely representing a splice variant, is detectable only in late phases of development, at and after postnatal day 21 (Fig. 4D). In contrast, CAPS2 protein expression levels are more stable during development and somewhat higher in the embryonic brain as compared with later phases of development (Fig. 4D). In summary, the high degree of homology between the two CAPS isoforms and their identical subcellular distribution in rat brain fractions indicate that CAPS1 and CAPS2 serve similar functions in the central nervous system. Their striking non-overlapping developmental and tissue expression patterns (Fig. 4, A and D; also see below), on the other hand, are compatible with the view that individual CAPS isoforms also play specific roles in certain cell types or during particular phases of development. Distribution of CAPS Proteins in Neural and Neuroendocrine Tissue—To compare the localization of CAPS1 and CAPS2 in the brain and adrenal gland, we performed immunocytochemical-labeling experiments on rat tissue sections using isoform-specific primary and fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies. CAPS1 distribution in hippocampus was very similar to that of the presynaptic marker synaptophysin. CAPS1 immunoreactivity was absent from the cell body layers of the hippocampus and dentate gyrus but abundant in the synaptic neuropil, except for the stratum lucidum and stratum lacunosum moleculare where CAPS1 was not detected (Fig. 5A). In contrast, CAPS2 immunoreactivity in the hippocampus was restricted to the polymorph layer of the dentate gyrus and, strikingly, to the stratum lucidum where CAPS1 was not detectable (Fig. 5A). The prominent nuclear labeling, which was obtained with the antibody to CAPS2 (Fig. 5, A and B), was also seen with the corresponding preimmune serum (not shown) and is, therefore, likely due to nonspecific cross-reactivity. In the cerebellum, the two CAPS isoforms showed a partially complementary distribution. CAPS1 was mainly detected in the glomeruli of the granule cell layer where it colocalized with synaptophysin, whereas CAPS2 was found almost exclusively in the synaptic neuropil of the molecular layer, also colocalized with synaptophysin (Fig. 5B). This differential distribution of CAPS1 and CAPS2 protein in cerebellum is in agreement with the distribution of the respective mRNAs (Fig. 3). Here, the predominant expression of CAPS2 mRNA in granule cells (Fig. 3) is the reason for the high CAPS2 protein levels in the molecular layer where granule cell axons terminate (Fig. 5B), whereas low levels of CAPS1 mRNA in the granule cell layer (Fig. 3) are paralleled by low CAPS1 protein levels in the molecular layer (Fig. 5B). In the olfactory bulb, CAPS1 was detected mainly in the glomeruli, colocalized with synaptophysin (Fig. 5C), whereas CAPS2 was not detectable (data not shown). Similarly, with our staining and imaging methods, only CAPS1 but not CAPS2 immunoreactivity was detectable in the adult adrenal gland, where it was restricted to the medulla (Fig. 5D). This apparent lack of CAPS2 in the adult adrenal gland, as determined by immunostaining, correlates well with the barely detectable levels of the corresponding mRNA, as determined by in situ hybridization assays (Fig. 3). Only by the extremely sensitive Western blotting technique was CAPS2 detectable in homogenates of adult adrenal gland (Fig. 4A), indicating that CAPS2 protein is indeed expressed in this tissue during adulthood, albeit at extremely low levels. Taken together, our light microscope data demonstrate a strikingly complementary synaptic distribution of CAPS1 and CAPS2 in certain brain regions such as the hippocampus and cerebellum, indicating that different types of synapses employ different CAPS isoforms. At higher resolution, the CAPS1 localization within the glomeruli of the cerebellar granule cell layer appeared to overlap only partially with that of synaptophysin. In particular, peripheral regions of glomeruli contained synaptophysin but not CAPS1 (Fig. 6B). Indeed, costaining with antibodies to GAD65, a marker of GABA-ergic terminals, revealed very little colocalization of CAPS1 with GAD65 (Fig. 6A), indicating that CAPS1 is absent from GABA-ergic Golgi cell nerve terminals and essentially specific for mossy fiber terminals within the glomeruli of the cerebellar granule cell layer. This notion was supported by an electron microscopic investigation in which we found CAPS1 to be localized specifically to mossy fiber terminals in the cerebellar granule cell layer but absent from neighboring symmetric, presumably GABA-ergic terminals (Fig. 6, C and D). In the molecular layer, CAPS1 was found to be very rare and was occasionally detected in dendritic compartments (Fig. 6E). In the hippocampus, CAPS1 was found mainly in asymmetric, presumably glutamatergic terminals (Fig. 6F). Thus, CAPS1 appears to be specific for glutamatergic terminals. So far, our antibodies to CAPS2 have not provided reliable staining at the ultrastructural level (data not shown). Comparison of CAPS1 and CAPS2 Function in Regulated Exocytosis—To test whether the novel CAPS2 isoform is similar to CAPS1 with respect to its role in the Ca2+-dependent triggering step of LDCV exocytosis, we examined the ability of proteins purified from COS-1 cells overexpressing wild-type CAPS1, wild-type CAPS2, or an inactive form of CAPS1 (R558D/K560E/K561E) to reconstitute the Ca2+-dependent triggering step of LDCV exocytosis from permeable PC12 cells. The purified dysfunctional CAPS1R558D/K560E/K561E mutant (10Grishanin R.N. Klenchin V.A. Loyet K.M. Kowalchyk J.A. Ann K. Martin T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22025-22034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) showed only background activity (Fig. 7). In contrast, wild-type CAPS1 or wild-type CAPS2 exhibited significantly higher levels of activity that were similar for reconstituting the Ca2+-dependent triggering step of LDCV exocytosis from permeable PC12 cells. These results indicate that CAPS1 and CAPS2 are functionally equivalent regulators of Ca2+-dependent LDCV exocytosis. CAPS1 was initially discovered as a cytosolic protein that functions in Ca2+-dependent exocytosis from permeable PC12 cells at a step that follows ATP-dependent priming (7Hay J.C. Martin T.F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 8Walent J.H. Porter B.W. Martin T.F.

Chem. 1997; 272: 19637-19640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). How this biochemically defined ATP-dependent priming step in the secretory process relates to the LDCV priming steps that are determined by patch-clamp amperometry with high temporal resolution is unclear. Later studies revealed an LDCV-specific role of CAPS1 (15Tandon A. Bannykh S. Kowalchyk J.A. Banerjee A. Martin T.F. Balch W.E. Neuron. 1998; 21: 147-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) that correlated well with the fact that membrane-bound CAPS1 in brain homogenates is associated with LDCVs but not with synaptic vesicles (16Berwin B. Floor E. Martin T.F. Neuron. 1998; 21: 137-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, the molecular basis of CAPS1 function has remained unknown. Its limited homology to Munc13 proteins in a region that is involved in syntaxin binding to Munc13s indicates that CAPS1 might serve a role in LDCV exocytosis analogous to the priming activity of Munc13s, which appears to involve modulation of syntaxin function (25Betz A. Okamoto M. Benseler F. Brose N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2520-2526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 26Richmond J.E. Weimer R.M. Jorgensen E.M. Nature. 2001; 412: 338-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In the present paper, we describe a novel CAPS isoform, CAPS2. The same isoform was very recently discovered in an independent study searching for novel interactors of dystrophin. However, proof of an interaction of CAPS2 with dystrophin beyond yeast two-hybrid data was not provided, and CAPS2 was characterized only at the level of its gene structure and mRNA expression using PCR and Northern blotting (27Cisternas F.A. Vincent J.B. Scherer S.W. Ray P.N. Genomics. 2003; 81: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). CAPS2 is highly homologous to CAPS1 (78–79% identity). Indeed, residues that are essential for CAPS1 function, such as W537, K538, R540, R558, K560, or K561 in the PH domain of rat CAPS1 (10Grishanin R.N. Klenchin V.A. Loyet K.M. Kowalchyk J.A. Ann K. Martin T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22025-22034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) are conserved in CAPS2 (Fig. 1). As a consequence, CAPS2 is functionally equivalent to CAPS1 with respect to its role in LDCV exocytosis from PC12 cells (Fig. 7). In addition, the subcellular localization of CAPS1 and CAPS2 within the cortex, as determined biochemically, is very similar (Fig. 4C). Finally, just like CAPS1 (Figs. 5 and 6), CAPS2 appears to be a presynaptic protein in the central nervous system, as illustrated best by the strong mRNA expression in cerebellar granule cells accompanied by a strong protein expression in the cerebellar molecular layer where the granule cell axons terminate (Fig. 5B). Taken together, these data indicate that CAPS1 and CAPS2 have very similar molecular functions in a very similar subcellular compartment. In that context, the striking differences between CAPS1 and CAPS2 with respect to their expression in different tissues (Fig. 4A), different brain regions (Fig. 4B), different synapse populations (Fig. 5, A and B), and different developmental phases (Fig. 4D) most likely reflect as yet unidentified subtle functional differences that are specifically required in the respective tissue or brain area or during a particular developmental period. In view of the apparently specific role at least of CAPS1 in LDCV exocytosis, the possible function of CAPS2 expressed in liver, lung, or testis (Fig. 4A) remains unclear. To address these open questions, we have initiated a detailed genetic study involving ablation of the two CAPS genes in mice. Presently available data indicate an LDCV-specific function of CAPS1 (15Tandon A. Bannykh S. Kowalchyk J.A. Banerjee A. Martin T.F. Balch W.E. Neuron. 1998; 21: 147-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 16Berwin B. Floor E. Martin T.F. Neuron. 1998; 21: 137-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This is supported by the detection of CAPS1 mRNA and protein in adrenal slices (Figs. 3 and 5D). In view of these published and novel findings, a striking and surprising observation of the present study was the highly specific and strong presynaptic accumulation of CAPS1 and CAPS2 (Fig. 5). In the case of CAPS1, this presynaptic localization was verified by electron microscopic observations (Fig. 6, C–F) and appeared to be specific for asymmetric glutamatergic synapses (Fig. 6, A–D). Electron micrographs of mossy fiber terminals in the cerebellar granule layer (see example in Fig. 6C) typically showed that entire synapses were filled with CAPS1 immunoreactivity even when no LDCVs were present, and accumulations of immunoreaction product were only sporadically associated with LDCVs (Fig. 6C, arrow). Admittedly, our electron microscopic method did not reach the level of resolution of immunogold labeling, and it does not, in principle, allow one to draw conclusions about the subcellular compartment or secretory vesicle type that CAPS1 is bound to and acts upon. Nevertheless, the abundance of CAPS1 (and CAPS2) in presynaptic terminals is very suggestive of an additional function of these proteins that is not linked exclusively to LDCV exocytosis. Apart from a direct, possibly Munc13-like role of CAPS proteins in classical synaptic transmission, such LDCV-independent functions of CAPS could also involve a role in the delivery of active-zone transport vesicles to synapses (28Garner C.C. Zhai R.G. Gundelfinger E.D. Ziv N.E. Trends Neurosci. 2002; 25: 243-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Again, detailed genetic studies in vertebrates will be helpful to resolve this problem. In summary, we have identified a second mammalian CAPS isoform, CAPS2, whose structure and function are very similar to those of CAPS1 and which may function in a very similar subcellular context, i.e. in neuroendocrine cells and presynaptic terminals of the central nervous system. Differences in the spatial and temporal expression patterns of the two CAPS isoforms most likely reflect as yet unidentified subtle functional differences required in particular cell types or during a particular developmental period. The abundance of CAPS proteins in synaptic terminals indicates that they may also be important for neuronal functions that are not related exclusively to LDCV exocytosis. We thank T. Hellmann and K. Hellmann for excellent technical assistance, and F. Benseler, I. Thanhäuser, and S. Handt for DNA sequencing and oligonucleotide synthesis."

Experiments with BNIP3 have implicated the transmembrane (TM) domain in its proapoptotic function, homodimerization, and interactions with Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. We show that the BNIP3 TM domain self-associates strongly in Escherichia coli cell membranes and causes reversible dimerization of a soluble protein in the detergent SDS when expressed as an in-frame fusion. Limited mutational analysis identifies specific residues that are critical for BNIP3 TM self-association in membranes, and these residues are also important for dimerization in SDS micelles, suggesting that the self-association observed in membranes is preserved in detergent. The effects of sequence changes at positions Ala176 and Gly180 suggest that the BNIP3 TM domain associates using a variant of the GXXXG motif previously shown to be important in the dimerization of glycophorin A. The importance of residue His173 in BNIP3 TM domain dimerization indicates that polar residues, which have been implicated in self-association of model TM peptides, can act in concert with the AXXXG motif to stabilize TM domain interactions. Our results demonstrate that the hydrophobic C-terminal TM domain of the pro-apoptotic BNIP3 protein dimerizes tightly in lipidic environments, and that this association has a strong sequence dependence but is independent of the identity of flanking regions. Thus, the transmembrane domain represents another region of the Bcl-2 superfamily of proteins that is capable of mediating strong and specific protein-protein interactions.

Thus, the transmembrane domain represents another region of the Bcl-2 superfamily of proteins that is capable of mediating strong and specific protein-protein interactions. The Bcl-2 superfamily of proteins plays a central role in regulating mitochondria-mediated apoptosis; the Bax subfamily promotes apoptosis, whereas the Bcl-2 subfamily protects against apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 1Gross A.

Mutational analysis shows that the TM domain interaction is mediated by both polar interactions and the motif AXXXG, and that the detergent-solubilized dimer is disrupted by the same mutations that disrupt the membrane-embedded complex. Our findings demonstrate that the BNIP3 TM domain can form stable dimers in membranes independent of other regions of BNIP3 and suggest that the C-terminal hydrophobic tails of this Bcl-2 family member may mediate functionally important protein-protein interactions in membranes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESVectors and Constructs—The TOXCAT vector, pccKAN, and the derivatives carrying the TM domain of glycophorin A (pccGpA-WT) and a disruptive glycophorin A mutant (pccGpA-G83I) were described previously (38Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). DNA coding for transmembrane domains was generated by PCR and ligated in-frame to the NheI and BamHI sites of pccKAN using XbaI and BamHI sites in the PCR products. Sequences were confirmed by automated dideoxynucleotide sequencing of the TM regions of the constructs; amino acid sequences are given in Table I. The staphylococcal nuclease/BNIP3 TM domain fusion protein (SN/BNIP3TM) was generated from the previously described staphylococcal nuclease/glycophorin A TM domain fusion protein vector (pT7SN/GpA) (39Lemmon M.A. Flanagan J.M.

All mutations were confirmed by automated dideoxynucleotide sequencing of the TM regions of the constructs.Expression of ToxR′(TM)MBP Constructs—Plasmids encoding ToxR′(TM)MBP chimerae were transformed into Escherichia coli NT326 cells (kindly provided by D. M. Engelman) and plated onto Luria Bertani (LB) plates (with 50 μg/ml ampicillin); colonies were inoculated into LB medium (with 50 μg/ml carbenicillin), and glycerol stocks were made at A600 ∼0.2 and stored at -80 °C. LB cultures (with 50 μg/ml carbenicillin) were inoculated from frozen glycerol stocks and grown at 37 °C until approximately A420 ∼1.0, when culture densities were equalized by (at least 16-fold) dilution into fresh culture tubes. These cultures were again grown to A420 ∼1.0, and 6.0 A420 units of cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed with 0.5 ml of sonication buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). Cells were then resuspended in 2 ml of sonication buffer and lysed by probe sonication. After removing an aliquot (100 μl) for Western blot analysis, the remaining lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g, and the supernatant was stored on ice until the spectrophotometric assay was performed. Normalization of lysate concentrations was confirmed by assaying total protein (Bio-Rad).Spectrophotometric CAT Assay—The assay of Shaw (40Shaw W.V. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 43: 737-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar) was used to detect chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity in cell lysates. This method follows the release of coenzyme A upon transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to chloramphenicol by quantifying the color change at 412 nm that occurs upon reaction of the free thiol of CoASH with 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid). 10 μl of lysate was mixed with 250 μl of reaction buffer (0.1 mm acetyl-CoA, 0.4 mg/ml 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid), 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.8), and the absorbance at 412 nm was acquired at 3-s intervals for a minimum of 2 min to establish a background rate of acetyl-CoA hydrolysis. 10 μl of 2.5 mm chloramphenicol was then added with mixing, and the absorbance was followed for 1 min. Each lysate was assayed in triplicate, and the slopes of the recorded data were converted to enzyme activity units (ϵ = 13,600 at 412 nm). Linear least squares fits to the data with high correlation coefficients and low variance indicated that the data being fit corresponded to regions for initial rates. Background acetyl-CoA hydrolysis was very low, rarely exceeding 1 unit of activity. Reported data are the averages from at least three separate experiments, and this method proved to give excellent reproducibility. All kinetics traces were acquired on a Cary 50 spectrophotometer.Western Blots—Cell lysates were mixed 1:1 with 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, heated to 90 °C or 95 °C for 5 min, separated on pre-cast 15% polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad), blotted onto nitrocellulose, detected with an anti-MBP primary antibody (New England Biolabs) or with an anti-staphylococcal nuclease antibody (prepared by Bethyl Industries), and visualized with an anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugate and ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences).Maltose Complementation Assays—For complementation assays, E. coli NT326 cells expressing ToxR′(TM)MBP constructs were grown overnight in liquid M9 minimal medium containing 0.4% glucose, washed, streaked on M9 minimal media plates containing 0.4% maltose as the only carbon source, and incubated for 2 days at 37 °C. Plates were imaged using a NucleoTech GelExpert digital camera system.Expression and Purification of Staphylococcal Nuclease Chimerae— Plasmid pT7SN/BNIP3 (or a mutant) was transformed into BL21(DE3) cells and plated onto LB plates (with 50 μg/ml ampicillin). Colonies were inoculated into LB medium (with 50 μg/ml carbenicillin), and glycerol stocks were made at A600 ∼0.2 and stored at -80 °C. LB overnight cultures (with 50 μg/ml carbenicillin) started from frozen glycerol stocks were used to inoculate 1-liter LB cultures, which were grown at 37 °C to A600 ∼1.0, induced with 0.6 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside, and harvested by centrifugation after 3 h. Cells were resuspended in 1:20 culture volume of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 8.0), subjected to three rounds of freeze-thaw, incubated with 0.1 mg/ml hen egg white lysozyme for 30 min on ice, and disrupted by sonication. CaCl2 was added to 5 mm, and the lysate was incubated on ice for a further 30 min to allow the nuclease activity of SN/BNIP3TM to fragment nucleic acid. The soluble fraction of this lysate was removed by centrifugation (12,000 × g for 10 min) and decantation. The pellet was extracted with lysis buffer plus 1 m NH4OAc, subjected to centrifugation, and the supernatant discarded. The pellet was extracted with lysis buffer plus the detergent Thesit (Fluka) at a concentration of 2% (w/v) and subjected to centrifugation, and the supernatant was again discarded. This pellet was extracted with lysis buffer plus 1 m NH4OAc and 2% Thesit, and the SN/BNIP3TM fusion protein was found in the supernatant following centrifugation for 30 min at 15,000 × g. This supernatant was dialyzed against lysis buffer plus 0.1 m NH4OAc and 0.2% Thesit and clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 12,000 × g. SN/BNIP3TM fusion protein was purified from the supernatant by ion-exchange chromatography over DE52 and CM52 resins at pH 8.0 in the presence of 0.2% Thesit. Additional purification was achieved in some cases by reversed phase-high pressure liquid chromatography on a phenyl stationary phase (Zorbax SB-Phenyl) in a gradient of isopropyl alcohol/acetonitrile (2:3) and water in the presence of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid.Purification of BNIP3 TM Peptide—SN/BNIP3TM protein purified by ion exchange in the presence of Thesit (above) was digested by addition of trypsin (1:40 weight ratio) and incubation overnight at 37 °C. Time courses revealed that intact SN/BNIP3TM disappeared within 30 min. BNIP3 TM domain peptide was purified by reversed phase-high pressure liquid chromatography on a phenyl stationary phase (Zorbax SB-Phenyl) in a gradient of isopropyl alcohol/acetonitrile (2:3) versus water in the presence of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptide identity was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (Dr. T. D. Marriott, Rice Department of Chemistry), with experimental masses matching calculated masses to within 2 atomic mass units.RESULTSHomodimerization of BNIP3 as detected both on SDS-PAGE and in yeast two-hybrid experiments depends on the presence of the BNIP3 TM domain (24Chen G. Ray R. Dubik D. Shi L. Cizeau J. Bleackley R.C. Saxena S. Gietz R.D. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1975-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). We have used the TOXCAT system (38Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) to determine whether the isolated BNIP3 TM domain is sufficient to cause self-association. In this assay, the TM domain is inserted as an in-frame fusion between ToxR′ (an N-terminal DNA-binding protein) and MBP (a C-terminal maltose-binding protein that is targeted to the periplasm). Expression of the ToxR′(TM)MBP construct in the E. coli membrane allows the read-out of TM-dependent dimerization of the ToxR′ domain through the reporter gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), which is under the control of the ToxR-responsive promoter ctx. Proper insertion topology can be verified by the ability of periplasmic MBP to restore to mutant E. coli the ability to grow on maltose as a sole carbon source. This approach has been used to characterize TM-TM interactions in several systems (34McClain M.S. Cao P. Cover T.L. Infect.

Methods Enzymol. 1975; 43: 737-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The positive control, ToxR′(GpA)MBP, bears the self-associating TM domain of glycophorin A and causes strong expression of the CAT gene (38Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 39Lemmon M.A. Flanagan J.M. Hunt J.F. Adair B.D. Bormann B.J. Dempsey C.E. Engelman D.M. J. Biol.

The negative control, which is identical except for the disruptive mutation G83I in the TM domain, causes minimal CAT expression (31Lemmon M.A. Flanagan J.M. Treutlein H.R. Zhang J. Engelman D.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12719-12725Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 38Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The ToxR′(BNIP3)MBP construct, which bears the BNIP3 TM domain (including residues 164-184 of mammalian BNIP3), shows CAT levels more than double those of the glycophorin A construct, indicating that the BNIP3 TM domain drives dimerization more strongly than does the glycophorin A TM domain. By contrast, the TM domains of two other BH3-only proteins, Hrk (44Inohara N. Ding L. Chen S. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1686-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) and Blk (45Hegde R.

Western blots of whole cell lysates detected with anti-MBP antibodies (inset in Fig. 1) demonstrate that the levels of ToxR′(TM)MBP fusion proteins in these cells are comparable, so differences in CAT expression are not due to variations in the amount of ToxR′ DNA-binding domain. MBP complementation assays confirm that the topologies of the ToxR′-MBP fusions are as expected (Fig. 2). We conclude that the BNIP3 TM domain is capable of very tight self-association in E. coli membranes.Fig. 2Topology assays for ToxR′(TM)MBP constructs. NT326 (malE-deficient) cells carrying various expression vectors were streaked onto an M9 minimal media plate with 0.4% maltose as carbon source. Untransformed (untrans) cells or cells carrying a construct with a stop codon in place of the TM domain (no TM) were unable to grow. In contrast, cells expressing full-length ToxR′(TM)MBP fusion proteins were able to grow, indicating that the maltose-binding domain of the fusion was expressed periplasmically.

We demonstrate that the integrin-associated tetraspanin, CD81, regulates VLA-4 and VLA-5 adhesion strengthening in monocytes and primary murine B cells. CD81 strengthens multivalent VLA-4 contacts within subsecond integrin occupancy without altering intrinsic adhesive properties to low density ligand. CD81 facilitates both VLA-4-mediated leukocyte rolling and arrest on VCAM-1 under shear flow as well as VLA-5-dependent adhesion to fibronectin during short stationary contacts. CD81 also augments VLA-4 avidity enhancement induced by either chemokine-stimulated Gi proteins or by protein kinase C activation, although it is not required for Gi protein or protein kinase C signaling activities. In contrast to other proadhesive integrin-associated proteins, CD81-promoted integrin adhesiveness does not require its own ligand occupancy or ligation. These results provide the first demonstration of an integrin-associated transmembranal protein that facilitates instantaneous multivalent integrin occupancy events that promote leukocyte adhesion to an endothelial ligand under shear flow.

To emigrate from the bloodstream to specific sites of inflammation or antigen presentation, circulating leukocytes must rapidly develop firm adhesion to vessel walls in response to both adhesive and stimulatory endothelial signals (1Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6373) Google Scholar). These tissue-specific “traffic signals” orchestrate a selective multistep cascade of attachment (tethering), rolling, and arrest of recruited leukocyte subsets under disruptive shear forces (2Alon R. Feigelson S. Semin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The firm adhesions are mediated exclusively by subsets of leukocyte integrins, which include α4β7, VLA-4 (α4β1), and LFA-1 (3Berlin C. Bargatze R.F. Campbell J.J. von Andrian U.H. Szabo M.C.

These integrins exhibit basal recognition of ligand under shear flow and enable leukocyte capture, rolling, and arrest on their respective endothelial ligands when present at sufficiently high densities (5Alon R.

This basal integrin adhesiveness can be dramatically augmented by leukocyte exposure to appropriate endothelial chemokines in situ, which enhance integrin avidity through their respective G-protein-coupled receptors on tethered leukocytes (7Bargatze R.F.

In addition, previous studies suggested that VLA-4 and LFA-1 associations with the intracellular actin-cytoskeleton control integrin adhesiveness to ligand under shear flow and are independent of the intrinsic affinity of these integrins to their respective ligands (5Alon R.

Accordingly, the ability of leukocyte integrins to self-cluster upon ligand binding has been predicted to facilitate the generation of high avidity tethers under disruptive shear forces even without acquisition of conformations with high affinity to monovalent ligands (10Grabovsky V.

The tetraspanins can either constitutively or inducibly associate with key signaling effectors of integrin function such as phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (18Berditchevski F. Tolias K.F. Wong K.

Several tetraspanins, including CD81, CD82, and CD151 as well as other integrin partners, augment integrin-dependent cell adhesion (20Behr S. Schriever F. J. Exp.

However, these activities are observed after prolonged contacts that involve cytoskeletal remodeling events downstream to the nascent integrin-dependent contacts. Recently, the β3- and β1-integrin-associated protein pentaspan, CD47, was shown to indirectly augment rapid VLA-4 adhesion strengthening to VCAM-1 under shear flow (24Ticchioni M. Raimondi V. Lamy L. Wijdenes J. Lindberg F.P. Brown E.J. Bernard A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This CD47-mediated augmentation required, however, the co-occupancy of CD47 with its endothelial ligand and did not affect the inherent VLA-4 adhesion to VCAM-1 (24Ticchioni M. Raimondi V. Lamy L. Wijdenes J. Lindberg F.P. Brown E.J. Bernard A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To date, functional evidence that a membranal integrin-associated molecule can directly up-regulate integrin avidity to ligand at rapid adhesive contacts independent of its own occupancy or ligation, has not been demonstrated.We now report that the CD81 tetraspanin is a key regulator of multivalent β1 integrin contacts that are critical for rapid adhesion strengthening in monocytes and primary murine B cells interacting with VCAM-1 under shear flow. This specialized activity does not require ligation or external occupancy of CD81 by ligand. CD81-facilitated VLA-4 adhesiveness results in the potentiation of rolling and arrest of CD81-expressing leukocytes on VCAM-1 as well as on immobilized integrin-binding mAb under shear flow. It also enables CD81-expressing leukocytes to integrate proadhesive inside-out signals from both chemokines and phorbol esters much more efficiently than CD81-null cells. CD81 is a first example of a membranal integrin-associated molecule acting as a facilitator of an exceptionally fast stabilization of multivalent integrin contacts under shear flow.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and AntibodiesRecombinant 7-domain human VCAM-1, sVCAM-1, was provided by Dr. R.

Boettiger D. Spooncer E. Norton J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5234Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and a single cell clone was isolated for subsequent infection by retroviral vectors. Human CD81 DNA was amplified by PCR using the forward primer GGTATGAATTCGCCGCCATGGGAGTGGAGGG and the reverse primer GGTACTCGAGCTCAGTACACGGAGCTGTTC (italized residues are the EcoRI and XhoI sites, and underlined are the start and stop codons). The amplified CD81 DNA was digested with EcoRI and XhoI and inserted into respective sites in the multicloning region of the retroviral vector pBMN-IRES-GFP. This retroviral vector encodes an IRES downstream of the multicloning region, followed by the green fluorescent protein (GFP), and was kindly provided by Dr. G. Nolan (Stanford University). Production of high titer ecotropic retrovirus in the θNX-Eco cells and infection by the retroviruses encoding the GFP alone or CD81 and GFP was performed as detailed. 2www.stanford.edu/group/nolan/retroviral_systems/phx.html. U937 cells-expressing CD81 and GFP or GFP alone were subcloned and cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and antibiotics. Murine B and T splenocytes were prepared and cultured from wild type and CD81 knockout Balb/c mice, as described (27Maecker H.T. Levy S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1505-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot AnalysisFor immunoprecipitation studies, 5 × 107 cells were solubilized in 1 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm vanadate, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm Nappi, 80 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 25 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% Brij 58, and one “protease inhibitor mixture” tablet (Roche Diagnostics)) and precleared with human serum albumin-conjugated Protein G-Sepharose (Danyel Biotech Ltd., Uppsala, Sweden). Lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies (10 μg/ml) for 60 min followed by the addition of Protein G beads overnight at 4 °C. Proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes and reacted with appropriate antibodies followed by peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies. For Western blot studies, 1 × 107 cells (treated or untreated) were solubilized in 100 μl of lysis buffer (as above, but with 1% Nonidet P-40 instead of Brij 58) and 10 μl of lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE in reducing buffer. Blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Sigma).Antibody-coated Microbeads AssaySheep anti-mouse IgG magnetic M-280 Dynabeads (Dynal Biotech Inc., Lake Success, NY) were coated with various concentrations (0.004-1 μg/ml) of HP1/2 or isotope matched control mAb, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells and antibody-coated beads were mixed for 30 s in binding medium, consisting of H/H medium (Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2, at a concentration of 1 × 107 cells/ml at a 1 cell:8 beads ratio, followed by a 3-fold dilution in binding medium. The cellular side scatter, distinguishing between bead-bound and bead-free cells, was then analyzed immediately in a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Pharmingen). Binding specificity was confirmed by the complete absence of cell binding by control mAb-coated beads.Flow Cytometry and Immunofluorescence Cell StainingStaining and fluorescence activated cell sorter analysis were performed as previously described (9Feigelson S.W. Grabovsky V. Winter E. Chen L.L. Pepinsky R.B. Yednock T. Yablonski D. Lobb R. Alon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13891-13901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For α4 integrin immunostaining, U937 monocytic cells were washed in PBS, fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS (30 min, room temperature), and incubated with anti-α4 B5G10 mAb for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were then washed once with PBS + 5 mm EDTA and twice with PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin and then stained with Alexa Fluor-546-conjugated anti-mouse Ab (Molecular Probes). Cells were attached to poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides and coverslips were mounted with elvanol overnight. Fluorescence microscopy was performed with a confocal microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE300 with the Laser scanning system 2000, Bio-Rad).Laminar Flow Adhesion AssaysPreparation of Adhesive Substrates—Purified ligands or mAbs were dissolved in PBS buffered with 20 mm bicarbonate, pH 8.5, and incubated on a polystyrene plate (60 × 15-mm Petri dish; BD Biosciences) for 2 h at 37 °C or overnight at 4 °C. The plate was then washed three times with PBS and blocked with human serum albumin (20 mg/ml in PBS) for 2 h at 4 °C. For SDF-1 co-immobilization on the adhesive substrate, ligands were coated in the presence of normal or heat-denatured chemokine (R&D Systems) (2 μg/ml) and a carrier protein (human serum albumin, 2 μg/ml) as previously described (10Grabovsky V. Feigelson S. Chen C. Bleijs R. Peled A. Cinamon G. Baleux F. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Lapidot T. van Kooyk Y. Lobb R. Alon R. J. Exp.

Grabovsky V. Winter E. Chen L.L. Pepinsky R.B. Yednock T. Yablonski D. Lobb R. Alon R. J. Biol.

Cells were washed with cation-free H/H medium, resuspended in binding medium (described above), and perfused through the flow chamber at the desired shear stress. All experiments were conducted at 37 °C and the entire period of cell perfusion was recorded with a long integration LIS-700 CCD video camera (Applitech, Holon, Israel). All cellular interactions with the adhesive substrates were manually quantified as previously described (10Grabovsky V. Feigelson S. Chen C. Bleijs R. Peled A. Cinamon G. Baleux F. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Lapidot T. van Kooyk Y. Lobb R. Alon R. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Tethers were defined as transient if cells attached briefly (<2 s) to the substrate, rolling if cells displayed a rolling motion for >5 s, and as arrests if immediately arrested and remaining stationary for at least 5 s of continuous flow. Frequencies of adhesive categories within differently pretreated cells were determined as a percentage of cells flowing immediately over the substrates, as previously described (10Grabovsky V. Feigelson S. Chen C. Bleijs R. Peled A. Cinamon G. Baleux F. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Lapidot T. van Kooyk Y. Lobb R. Alon R. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). To assess rapid development of integrin avidity to ligand at stationary contacts, cells were allowed to settle onto the substrate for 1 min at stasis. Flow was then initiated and increased stepwise every 5 s by a programmed set of rates. At the indicated shear stresses, the number of cells that remained bound was expressed relative to the number of cells originally settled on the substrate.RESULTSCD81 Enhances the Avidity of α4Integrin Measured during Rapid Contact of Mouse B Lymphocyte and Human U937 Cells with Immobilized VCAM-1—To directly address the role of CD81 in integrin adhesion strengthening, we compared the ability of B splenocytes derived from normal and cd81-/- mice to develop integrin-dependent adhesion to the endothelial VLA-4 ligand, VCAM-1. CD81-expressing B splenocytes, although expressing slightly lower levels of α4 integrins (Fig. 1A, top left) generated much higher VLA-4 avidity to VCAM-1 than their CD81-null counterparts (Fig. 1A, right). In contrast, resting mouse wild type T splenocytes, which lack surface CD81 (Fig. 1B, bottom left), exhibited comparable VLA-4 avidity to VCAM-1 as that developed by T splenocytes derived from cd81-/- mice (Fig. 1B, right). This finding suggests that in B splenocytes, the CD81 tetraspanin enhances VLA-4 adhesion strengthening to VCAM-1 at rapid contact sites.The female infertility of cd81-/- mice (29Deng J. Yeung V.P.

Levy, unpublished data. limited the availability of cells and thus the extensive molecular characterization of the role of CD81 in regulating VLA-4 properties in murine leukocytes. To extend these results to an in vitro human system, we utilized U937 promonocytic leukemia cells, which do not express endogenous CD81. The human monocyte line was reconstituted with CD81 by stable retroviral infection with a vector encoding CD81 and a GFP reporter (herein CD81), or with GFP alone (herein null). Clones identical in α4 integrin expression (Fig. 2A) were used for further characterization. Notably, both cells lacked α4β7 (Fig. 2A) indicating that all α4 expression in these cells is exclusively associated VLA-4 (α4β1).Fig. 2CD81 facilitates multivalent VLA-4 tethers to VCAM-1.A, flow cytometry of cell surface expression of VLA-4 (upper panel) or CD81 (lower panel) on CD81-deficient U937 cells transfected with CD81 and GFP reporter (CD81; black) or GFP reporter alone (Null; gray). Cells were stained with anti-α4-specific HP1/2 or anti-human CD81 5A6 mAbs, followed by secondary PE-labeled anti-mouse Ig. There was no detectable expression of α4β7 in both cells using the α4β7-specific mAb Act-I.4B, spontaneous adhesion of CD81-expressing or -null cells to high and low density VCAM-1 at stasis. Strength of adhesion was analyzed as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Antibody blocking of CD81-expressing cells with the anti-α4 HP1/2 mAb (10 μg/ml) completely eliminated all cell adhesion to both VCAM-1 densities, as depicted by the open triangle. The mean ± range of two independent fields is shown. C, mAb-induced CD81 ligation does not increases VLA-4 avidity to VCAM-1. CD81-expressing U937 cells were left untreated or incubated with mAb (5 μg/ml for 15 min at 37 °C) specific for CD81 (5A6) or L-selectin (DREG-200) or treated with activating mAb to β1 (TS2/16) and their strength of VLA-4-dependent adhesion to VCAM-1 (0.75 μg/ml) was analyzed. The mean ± range of two independent fields is depicted. D, tethering, rolling, and spontaneous arrest of CD81-null and CD81-expressing U937 cells interacting with VCAM-1 under continuous shear flow. Tethered cells, determined in two fields at 1 dyn/cm2, were grouped into three categories, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Inset depicts enlarged bars for tether categories of both cell types on the lowest tested density VCAM-1. Results in B and D are representative of four experiments. Results in C are of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Reminiscent of B splenocytes (Fig. 1A), CD81-expressing monocytes developed greater shear-resistant VLA-4-dependent adhesion to high density VCAM-1 than their CD81-null counterparts after a 1-min static contact with the integrin ligand (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, CD81 did not contribute to VLA-4-dependent adhesion strengthening to low density VCAM-1 (Fig. 2B). CD81-augmented VLA-4 adhesiveness to VCAM-1 was α4-specific as it was entirely blocked by preincubation of the cells with either an α4 blocking mAb (Fig. 2B) or the VLA-4-specific ligand, Bio1211 (30Lin K.

This result ruled out a contribution of a direct co-adhesive interaction between CD81 and VCAM-1 to the VLA-4-dependent adhesion to VCAM-1. Pretreatment of CD81-expressing or null U937 cells with pharmacological inhibitors of PKC, protein-tyrosine kinase, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase did not affect the ability of their VLA-4 to develop adhesion strengthening at these rapid static contacts.4 Thus, the proadhesive effects of CD81 on VLA-4 adhesiveness did not involve activities of these kinases shortly prior to or within the time frame of the integrin contact with ligand. Furthermore, external ligation of CD81 with a stimulatory mAb (31Todd S.C. Lipps S.G. Crisa L. Salomon D.R. Tsoukas C.D. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2055-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) did not enhance VLA-4-dependent U937 adhesion VCAM-1 developed at 1-min static contacts at any ligand density tested (Fig. 2C).4 This result rules out the possibility that external CD81 ligation could, on its own, induce rapid generation of high VLA-4 avidity to VCAM-1.Strikingly, CD81 also dramatically up-regulated the ability of VLA-4 in U937 cells to support cell capture and rolling on VCAM-1 under persistent physiological shear flow (Fig. 2D). Reminiscent of its proadhesive role at stationary VLA-4/VCAM-1 contacts, the contribution of CD81 to enhanced VLA-4 adhesiveness to low density VCAM-1 was diminished (Fig. 2D). The ability of VLA-4 to capture cells and mediate their successive rolling adhesions on VCAM-1 under shear flow involves generation of critical avidity to VCAM-1 within adhesive contacts lasting fractions of seconds (9Feigelson S.W. Grabovsky V. Winter E. Chen L.L. Pepinsky R.B. Yednock T. Yablonski D. Lobb R. Alon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13891-13901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Thus, CD81 appeared to augment the ability of VLA-4 to generate critical binding avidity to high and medium density VCAM-1 at subsecond contacts without affecting the capacity of the integrin to recognize and transiently adhere to low density VCAM-1 (Fig. 2D, inset). As observed at stationary contacts, CD81 ligation with a stimulatory mAb failed to up-regulate VLA-4 mediated capture, rolling, or arrest on VCAM-1 under shear flow,4 suggesting that CD81 promotes VLA-4 avidity to high density ligand independent of its own ligation.CD81 Up-regulates Rapid VLA-4 Adhesion Strengthening without Altering Integrin Ligand Binding Properties or Preformed Clustering—Artificial stimulation of integrin affinity to ligand often rescues adhesive defects caused by impaired inside-out integrin signaling (9Feigelson S.W.

Suspension of CD81-null U937 cells in Mg2+ to artificially activate VLA-4 affinity did not rescue, however, the inability of VLA-4 to support high avidity adhesion to VCAM-1 at stasis.4 These results suggested that the major defect in VLA-4 function in CD81-null cells is affinity-independent. Consistent with this conclusion, direct binding to a monovalent VLA-4 binding peptide, the LDV derivative Bio1211 (30Lin K. Ateeq H.S. Hsiung S.H. Chong L.T. Zimmerman C.N. Castro A. Lee W.C.

Pulse-chase experiments using transiently transfected COS7 cells demonstrated that organic solutes also increased the processing of the core-glycosylated form of green fluorescent protein-ΔF508 CFTR. Moreover, the prolonged half-life of the complex-glycosylated form of GFP-ΔF508 CFTR suggests that this treatment stabilized the mature form of the protein. In vitro studies of purified NBD1 stability and aggregation showed that myoinositol stabilized both the ΔF508 and wild type CFTR and inhibited ΔF508 misfolding. Most significantly, treatment of CF bronchial airway cells with these transportable organic solutes restores cAMP-stimulated single channel activity of both CFTR and outwardly rectifying chloride channel in the cell surface membrane and also restores a forskolin-stimulated macroscopic 36Cl- efflux.

However, the small fraction of ΔF508 CFTR protein that arrives at the plasma membrane retains function as a cAMP-responsive chloride channel, although with a decreased open probability compared with wild-type CFTR (5Dalemans W.

The trafficking defect of ΔF508 CFTR can be reversed by lowering the growth temperature (25-27 °C) of ΔF508 CFTR-expressing cells. Low temperature, in a time-dependent manner, leads to the appearance of the mature, fully glycosylated, high molecular weight form of CFTR, as well as a restoration of cAMP-dependant chloride channel activity (7Denning G.M. Anderson M.P. Amara J.F. Marshall J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1992; 358: 761-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). High concentrations of glycerol (1 m) or 100 mm trimethylamine N-oxide also increase the plasma membrane expression of ΔF508 CFTR in NIH 3T3 cells and HEK 293 cells (8Brown C.R. Hong-Brown L.Q.

It is currently thought that these organic solutes stabilize proteins by promoting selective hydration of the polypeptide (14Wang A. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9101-9108Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, the major renal organic solutes such as 300 mm sorbitol, myoinositol, and taurine recently have been shown to increase processing in renal medulla cells transfected with ΔF508 CFTR (15Howard M.

Together, these observations suggest the potential utility of treating airways with organic solutes or “chemical chaperones” for CF therapy. Promoting the folding of the mutant protein may lead to trafficking of some of the mislocalized, mutant protein to the plasma membrane, where it may rescue sufficient membrane chloride conductance in CF cells to counteract the genetic defect. However, in addition to its function as a chloride channel, CFTR performs vital regulation of other transport processes in the apical membrane of epithelia, which, when lost, may also contribute to the pathology. We expected that if organic solutes indeed rescued the folding and restored the chloride channel function of CFTR, this treatment should also rescue the interactions that CFTR normally has with other ion channels such as the outwardly rectifying chloride channel (ORCC). One caveat of the previous studies using organic solutes to refold ΔF508 CFTR is the high concentrations of organic solutes that were required to restore channel function. Here, we present data suggesting that organic solutes can be used in much lower concentrations than previously suspected, by utilizing the activity of endogenous organic solute cotransporters that actively accumulate these solutes. These accumulated solutes not only correct the chloride channel function of CFTR but also promote ORCC function. Antibodies—Antibody 169, a rabbit anti-human CFTR R domain polyclonal antibody generated to peptide IEEDSDEPLERRLSLVPDSEQGE, was a gift from Dr. William Guggino (The Johns Hopkins University). This antibody recognized both the core glycosylated band (band B, ∼160 kDa) and the fully glycosylated form of CFTR (band C, ∼180 kDa) in T84 cells, HBE cells, and NIH 3T3 cells transfected with WT CFTR. In IB3 cells or NIH 3T3 cells transfected with ΔF508 CFTR, the major band detected was the core glycosylated B band. Human CFTR C-terminal monoclonal antibody from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) (MAB25031) was used to confirm the results in many experiments and in all experiments gave bands of the same molecular weight as antibody 169. The monoclonal antibodies to the Na,K-ATPase α1 subunit and β-actin were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY) (05-369) and Sigma (A5441), respectively. The monoclonal antibody to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was a gift from Dr. Michael Sirover (Temple University). The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody was from Amersham Biosciences. The polyclonal GFP antibody was from BD Biosciences (8372-2). Cell Culture—The IB3-1 (IB3) cell line is an SV40-transformed line derived from the bronchial epithelium of a cystic fibrosis patient with the ΔF508/W1282X genotype (X = stop mutation). The W1282X mutation produces an unstable mRNA (16Hamosh A. Rosenstein B.J. Cutting G.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1992; 1: 542-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). IB3 cells were grown in T75 culture flasks in LHC-8 media (Biofluids, Rockville, MD) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin and 2.5 μg/ml fungizone (Invitrogen). T84 cells, a human colonic epithelia cell line obtained from ATCC, were grown in 1:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with wide-type CFTR or ΔF508 CFTR (gift from Dr. M. Welsh) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were routinely maintained in 5% CO2 incubators at 37 °C. When cells were treated, organic solutes were added to the routine growth medium. The addition of 10 mm solute marginally increased the osmolality of growth culture medium from 300 mosmol/kg H2O to 310 mosmol/kg H2O, as measured by a vapor pressure osmometer (Wescor Inc., Logan UT). COS7 cells were obtained from ATCC and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Organic solutes were administered to cells 24 h post-transfection. Immunoprecipitation and Phosphorylation of CFTR—Biochemical analysis of CFTR expression and glycosylation was performed by immunoprecipitation with anti-CFTR antibodies followed by in vitro phosphorylation using protein kinase A and [γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 1). The procedures were described previously (3Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E.

Briefly, cells grown under indicated conditions were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (Sigma) and scraped into lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40) containing 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mml-phenylalanine, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, and the following protease inhibitors: pepstatin A (2 μg/ml), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), elastinal (4 μg/ml), benzamidine (0.5 mg/ml), 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.4 mm iodoacetic acid, 2.5 mm phenanthroline and 0.1 mmN-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (all from Sigma). The cells were then homogenized in lysis buffer, placed on ice for 60 min, and then centrifuged for 30 s at 10,000 × g in an Eppendorf bench top centrifuge. The protein in the supernatant was quantified with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) and stored at -80 °C. One milligram of lysate protein in 1 ml of lysis buffer with protease inhibitors was precleared with 2 μl of normal rabbit serum (used only for polyclonal antibody 169) and 30 μl of Protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 2 h and centrifuged at 10,000 × g to remove nonspecific complexes. Subsequently, either 2 μl of antibody 169, a rabbit polyclonal anti-human CFTR R domain antibody, or 1 μg of mouse monoclonal C-terminal antibody (IgG2a) were added and incubated at 4 °C overnight. To pull down the antigen-antibody complexes, equivalent amounts of Protein A beads were added to each reaction tube and incubated at 4 °C for 60 min. The antigen-antibody-bead complex was pelleted by a brief spin and then washed five times for 10 min each time with 1 ml of lysis buffer. The immunoprecipitates were then washed once with 1 ml of Tris-buffered saline, pH 8.0, and incubated with 5 units of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (Sigma) and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 50 μl of PKA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) at 30 °C for 1 h. Following two washes with lysis buffer, the immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 40 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) and incubated at 65 °C for 4 min. The sample was spun 2 min at 8,000 × g, and the supernatant was either stored at -20 °C overnight or loaded directly onto a gel. The proteins were separated on 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) and prepared for autoradiography. Exposure time was 30-60 min at -80 °C. Western Blotting—Cell lysates were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer and incubated at room temperature for 60 min. After separating on either 5 or 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) in Tris/glycine transfer buffer (Bio-Rad) containing 10% methanol. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TTBS) for 1 h at room temperature and then was incubated overnight with primary antibodies in the blocking buffer. The primary antibodies were diluted 1:400 for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 1:2,000 for actin, and 1:20,000 for Na,K-ATPase α subunit. The membrane was washed three times with TTBS for 10 min each wash and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody diluted 1:10,000. After washing, the blots were visualized using the SuperSignal West Dura substrate (Pierce). Pulse Chase and Immunoprecipitation—Experiments were performed utilizing COS7 cells transiently transfected with GFP-ΔF508 CFTR or wild type GFP-CFTR and grown in T75 flasks. The GFP expression plasmids were a gift from Dr. Bruce Stanton (Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH). Previous data showed that the addition of GFP to the N terminus did not affect CFTR trafficking or degradation (18Moyer B.D. Loffing J. Schwiebert E.M. Loffing-Cueni D. Halpin P.A. Karlson K.H.

Cells were rinsed three times and then starved for 1 h at 37 °C in methionine- and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). Cells were pulse-labeled with 500 μCi/ml [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (ICN Biomedical, Irvine, CA) for 15 min and then chased with prewarmed Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10 mm methionine and 4 mm cysteine for the indicated times. At each time point, the cells were placed on ice, rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS, and lysed in lysis buffer supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min. Wild type GFP-CFTR or GFP-ΔF508 CFTR was immunoprecipitated using a polyclonal antibody to GFP (8372-2; BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) from cell lysates precleared for 2 h with Protein A-Sepharose fast flow beads (Amersham Biosciences). The immunoprecipitation products were eluted with sample buffer and separated on a 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Following electrophoresis, the gel was fixed (isopropyl alcohol/water/acetic acid, 25:65:10), enhanced with Amplify (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min, dried for autoradiography, and read on a phosphoimager (ImageQuant 5.0). In Vitro Folding and Aggregation—The vectors directing expression of His-tagged CFTR NBD1 and NBD1ΔF are similar to the pET 28a-derived vectors described previously (20Qu B.H. Thomas P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7261-7264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), except they contain residues 388-655 (NBD388) or 419-655 (NBD419) of human CFTR. The NBD388 proteins include all of the residues from the crystal structure of the recently solved CFTR NBD except for a C-terminal helix, which, until recently, has been ascribed to the R-domain. 2H. Lewis, Structural GenomiX, personal communication. The NBD419 proteins include the entire F1-like core and the α-helical subdomains of the domain but lack a β-strand from the β-sheet subdomain at their extreme N termini as well as the C-terminal helix. The purified NBD proteins were refolded overnight at 4 °C in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 375 mml-arginine, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 200 mm guanidine HCl at a final concentration of 4 μm and subsequently used to determine thermal stability and aggregation properties in the presence and absence of myoinositol. Both of the domains cooperatively fold and recapitulate the effects of the ΔF508 mutation on folding, 3P. H. Thibodeau and P. Thomas, unpublished data. although the NBD419 cannot reach the native state due to the lack of an intact β subdomain, thereby providing a model for a trapped, partially folded NBD1. The purified CFTR NBD1 and NBD1ΔF proteins were used to assess the effects of myoinositol on the thermodynamic stability and folding and aggregation of the NBD1 as previously described (21Qu B.H. Strickland E.H. Thomas P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15739-15744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In brief, the refolded wild type CFTR and ΔF508 NBD1 were subjected to temperature melts to ascertain stabilities in the absence or presence of myoinositol. The temperature was ramped from either 25 to 60 °C or from 10 to 70 °C over 30 min or 2 h, respectively, and monitored turbidimetrically or by light scattering at 400 nm. To test the effect of myoinositol on the NBD1 aggregation, refolded protein was diluted into arginine buffer containing different concentrations of myoinositol at 37 °C, and aggregation was monitored turbidimetrically. The partially folded NBD1 molecules associate in a time-dependent manner to form larger aggregates that scatter visible light. Formation of these aggregated species is continuously monitored by detecting scattered 400 nm light 90° to incident on a PTI Quantamaster or turbidimetrically at 400 nm on a Shimadzu UV-2101PC spectrophotometer. The data are representative of experiments performed at least four times, using two protein preparations per experiment. Single Channel Patch Clamp Recordings—Single channel patch clamp studies were performed on excised inside-out patches using conventional procedures as described previously (22Egan M.E. Schwiebert E.M. Guggino W.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C243-C251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were seeded on polylysine-coated coverslips (Sigma) and treated with 1 or 10 mm myoinositol or betaine for 24 h. Recording pipettes were constructed from borosilicate glass capillaries (Garner Glass, Claremont, CA) using a microelectrode puller (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA). The pipettes were partially filled with a standard pipette solution and usually had a tip resistance of 5-10 megaohms. Recordings were performed at room temperature (20-22 °C). Single channel currents were recorded with a patch clamp amplifier (L/M EPC7; Darmstadt, Germany) filtered at 10 kHz using an eight-pole Bessel filter and stored on computer. Data were redigitized at 2 kHz for analysis using pCLAMP7 (Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA) The bath solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm HEPES, and 0.5 mm CaCl2 (free Ca2+ 110 nm as measured by Fura-2), pH 7.3, with or without the addition of organic solutes. The pipette solution contained in 140 mm NaC1 or less to balance the osmolality of organic solutes, 2 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.3. All solutions were filtered through 0.2-μm filters. Osmolality was measured by a vapor pressure osmometer (Wescor Inc.) to maintain equal osmolality in the preincubation growth medium and internal and external pipette solutions. Chloride channels were activated by the addition of a final concentration of 75 nm of the catalytic subunit of PKA (Promega, Madison, WI) and 1 mm Mg-ATP. To prevent CFTR channel rundown in excised patches, 1 mm Mg-ATP was added to the bath solution. Each patch was observed for at least 10 min, and open probability (Po) was calculated from a current recording of at least 3-min duration. ORCC and CFTR channel activity were distinguished by their single channel conductance, respectively. In order to further characterize these channels in some experiments, after the currents were recorded 50 μm DIDS (Sigma) or 3 mm diphenylamine-2-carboxylate (Sigma) were added to bath solution to inhibit ORCC and CFTR channel activity, respectively. The number of detected ΔF508 CFTR or ORCC channels in the total number of patches recorded is presented as the frequency and was analyzed by Fisher's exact test (Table I). The differences in open probability between treated and control groups were analyzed using Student's t test. Data are indicated as the mean ± S.E., where an asterisk represents p < 0.05, and a double asterisk indicates p < 0.01.Table IFrequency of chloride channel activity stimulated by PKA and ATP in patches from control, myoinositol-treated (MI), or betaine-treated IB3 cellsControl1 mm MI10 mm MI1 mm betaine10 mm betaineCFTR0/54(0%)7/20(35%)**10/26(38%)**1/12(8%)5/32(16%)**ORCC0/54(0%)7/20(35%)**6/26(23%)**2/12(17%)*6/32(19%)** Open table in a new tab Chloride Release Assay—The forskolin-stimulated release of 36Cl- from IB3 cells was performed using blinded trials as an estimate of cellular chloride efflux as previously described (23Schwiebert E.M.

Cells grown to about 90% confluence in six-well plates were treated with various concentrations of myoinositol in culture medium for 24 h. The cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen). Each well was then filled with 1.5 ml of Ringer's solution containing a total of 5 μCi of 36Cl- (sodium salt with a specific activity of 1 μCi/μl from PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 2-3 h. All 36Cl- release assays were performed in a 37 °C warm room, which assured constant temperature, with each well serving as its own control (one trial). At time zero, Ringer's solution without cAMP agonists was added and removed immediately to wash away excess extracellular isotope. A fresh aliquot of Ringer's solution was added immediately after this initial wash, and then 36Cl- release was measured every 15 s by removing the Ringer's solution and replacing it with fresh Ringer's solution until the 1-min time point was reached. At this time, a Ringer's solution containing forskolin (2.5 μm), 8-bromo-cAMP (250 μm), and 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP (250 μm) was added to the dish. The cAMP agonist containing Ringer's solution was collected every 15 s for the remaining 2 min of the release assay. At the end of the run, 0.5 n NaOH was added in two aliquots to lyse the cells, and all of the cell lysate was recovered to determine how much 36C1- remained in the cells. The radioactivity of the efflux samples and the cell lysate was measured in a scintillation counter. The amount of 36Cl- accumulated in the medium over each 15-s time period was normalized to the initial 36C1- loss in the first 15 s time point of that trial. The rate of release was calculated by comparing each time point to the previous one. The normalized rate of release of 36Cl- for the trials is shown as a normalized number ± S.D. The rates of 36Cl- release after the application of cAMP agonists under control and experimental conditions were compared, and the differences in slopes were evaluated using analysis of variance. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. Organic Solutes Treatment Increases the Fully Glycosylated Form of CFTR—It is well established that the normal processing of CFTR from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the plasma membrane entails the addition and modification of oligosaccharides in the Golgi apparatus (3Cheng S.H.

The immature form of CFTR, representing CFTR situated in the ER, is a core-glycosylated protein that is sensitive to endoglycosidase H (band B). The fully glycosylated, endoglycosidase H-resistant CFTR protein is about 20-30 kDa greater in molecular mass than the core glycosylated CFTR and represents the mature form of CFTR (band C) that is localized in the post-ER compartments, including the plasma membrane. Immunoprecipitation from T84 cells using either CFTR antibody provided a molecular mass control in each CFTR immunoprecipitation assay, because this cell line expresses mainly the mature, fully glycosylated CFTR (band C) as well as a small amount of the immature core glycosylated form of CFTR (band B) (Fig. 1, A (lane 2), B (lane 1), and E). The CF cell line, IB3, showed mainly the core-glycosylated band B form of this protein (Fig. 1A, lane 1) consistent with expression of the ΔF508 CFTR mutant. In some experiments (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 5), another higher molecular mass band was present in IB3 control cells probably as a result of gentamicin that was added to some of the culture medium provided by the manufacturer. Gentamicin enhances read-through of the W1282X deletion (24Bedwell D.M. Kaenjak A. Benos D.J. Bebok Z. Bubien J.K. Hong J. Tousson A. Clancy J.P. Sorscher E.J. Nat.

Recent results from myoinositol-treated renal cells transfected with ΔF508 CFTR show double CFTR bands, suggesting that there may be other explanations for double bands (15Howard M. Fischer H.

https://openalex.org/W1969026949,"Although acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP) has been detected in the nucleus, the physiological significance of this observation is unknown. As shown herein for the first time, ACBP in the nucleus physically and functionally interacted with hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α (HNF-4α), a nuclear binding protein that regulates transcription of genes involved in both lipid and glucose metabolism. Five lines of evidence showed that ACBP bound HNF-4α in vitro and in the nucleus of intact cells. (i) ACBP interaction with HNF-4α elicited significant changes in secondary structure. (ii) ACBP and HNF-4α were coimmunoprecipitated by antibodies to each protein. (iii) Double immunolabeling and laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) of rat hepatoma cells and transfected COS-7 cells significantly colocalized ACBP and HNF-4α within the nucleus and in the perinuclear region close to the nuclear membrane. (iv) LSCM fluorescence resonance energy transfer determined an intermolecular distance of 53 Å between ACBP and HNF-4α in rat hepatoma cell nuclei. (v) Immunogold electron microscopy detected ACBP within 43 Å of HNF-4α. These interactions were specific since ACBP did not interact with Sp1 or glucocorticoid receptor in these assays. The functional significance of ACBP interaction with HNF-4α was evidenced by mammalian two-hybrid and transactivation assays. ACBP overexpression in COS-7 or rat hepatoma cells enhanced transactivation of an HNF-4α-dependent luciferase reporter plasmid by 3.2- and 1.6-fold, respectively. In contrast, cotransfection with antisense ACBP expression vector inhibited transactivation. LSCM of the individual triple fluorescent-labeled (HNF-4α, ACBP, and luciferase) rat hepatoma cells showed a high correlation (r2, 0.936) between the level of luciferase and the level of ACBP expression. In summary, ACBP physically interacted with HNF-4α in vitro and in intact cells, although ACBP expression level directly correlated with HNF-4α-mediated transactivation in individual cells. Although acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP) has been detected in the nucleus, the physiological significance of this observation is unknown.

(iv) LSCM fluorescence resonance energy transfer determined an intermolecular distance of 53 Å between ACBP and HNF-4α in rat hepatoma cell nuclei. (v) Immunogold electron microscopy detected ACBP within 43 Å of HNF-4α. These interactions were specific since ACBP did not interact with Sp1 or glucocorticoid receptor in these assays. The functional significance of ACBP interaction with HNF-4α was evidenced by mammalian two-hybrid and transactivation assays. ACBP overexpression in COS-7 or rat hepatoma cells enhanced transactivation of an HNF-4α-dependent luciferase reporter plasmid by 3.2- and 1.6-fold, respectively. In contrast, cotransfection with antisense ACBP expression vector inhibited transactivation. LSCM of the individual triple fluorescent-labeled (HNF-4α, ACBP, and luciferase) rat hepatoma cells showed a high correlation (r2, 0.936) between the level of luciferase and the level of ACBP expression. In summary, ACBP physically interacted with HNF-4α in vitro and in intact cells, although ACBP expression level directly correlated with HNF-4α-mediated transactivation in individual cells.

Until recently, ACBP was thought to be primarily cytosolic and unique among the soluble intracellular lipid proteins in exhibiting very high affinity (Kd values of 0.5-10 nm) and exclusive specificity for long chain fatty acyl-CoAs (LCFA-CoAs) (1Gossett R.E.

First, ACBP may be involved in directly presenting LCFACoAs as substrates for lipid metabolic enzymes. A variety of studies in vitro suggest that ACBP extracts LCFA-CoAs from membranes (6Chao H.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10540-10553Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) to increase the soluble LCFA-CoA pool available for intracellular transport (reviewed in Ref. 2Knudsen J. Jensen M.V.

Second, ACBP may control the level of unbound LCFA-CoA available for interaction with regulatory sites on metabolic enzymes (e.g. acetyl-CoA carboxylase) and intracellular signaling proteins (e.g. protein kinase C) in the cytosol (reviewed in Refs. 12Faergeman N.J.

Third, recent data demonstrating the presence of significant amounts of ACBP in the nuclei of transfected cells overexpressing ACBP suggest that ACBP may also be involved in direct or ligand (LCFA-CoA)-dependent regulation of nuclear proteins that activate transcription of genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism (14Elholm M.

The relative order of affinities of these nuclear receptors for LCFA-CoAs is HNF-4α (Kd of 1.5-4 nm) >> TR (Kd of 120 nm) >> PPARα (displaces Wy14643). On this basis, it appears that only HNF-4α binds LCFA-CoAs with affinities in the physiological range of LCFACoA levels in the nucleus, <10 nm (17Petrescu A.D. Hertz R. Bar-Tana J. Schroeder F.

HNF-4α is a nuclear receptor with major roles in hepatocyte differentiation during liver development and in regulating the transcription of numerous target genes involved in lipid transport and metabolism (22Kardassis D.

Nature. 1992; 355: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Recently, a conditional gene knockout of HNF-4α in mice confirmed that HNF-4α is an important in vivo regulator of genes involved in lipid homeostasis including apolipoproteins (apoAI, -II, and -IV, apoB, apoCII and -III, and apoE), microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A), liver-fatty acid-binding protein (LFABP), and PPAR-α (24Hayhurst G.P. Lee Y.H. Lambert G. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1393-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). A study in which 9000 genes were analyzed by cDNA microarray technology in human hepatoma cells that overexpressed HNF-4α demonstrated that 26 of the 45 HNF-4α-sensitive genes were related to lipid metabolism (25Naiki T. Nagaki M. Shidoji Y. Kojima H. Imose M. Kato T. Ohnishi N. Yagi K. Moriwaki H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14011-14019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Although ACBP and HNF-4α both bind LCFA-CoAs with nanomolar affinities and have been reported to modulate lipid metabolism, it is not known if (i) ACBP interacts directly with HNF-4α at the molecular level, (ii) ACBP interacts directly with HNF-4α at the cellular level, and (iii) ACBP expression influences HNF-4α transcriptional functions. Materials—Recombinant mouse ACBP was produced and purified as described (6Chao H. Martin G. Russell W.K. Waghela S.D. Russell D.H. Schroeder F. Kier A.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10540-10553Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). HNF-α-LBD was obtained as described earlier (16Hertz R. Magenheim J. Berman I. Bar-Tana J.

Fetal bovine serum, bovine serum albumin, protein A-Sepharose 4CL, FITC-goat anti-rat IgG, and protease inhibitor mixture were purchased from Sigma. Lab-Tek coverglass slides were purchased from Fisher. Mouse anti-firefly luciferase monoclonal antibody was from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against glucocorticoid receptor α (GR) and Sp1 protein were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Gold-labeled polyclonal antibodies against rabbit IgG (Aurion, Wageningen, The Netherlands) were purchased through Electron Microscopy Sciences (Fort Washington, PA). Texas Red goat anti-rabbit IgG, TOTO-3 (a DNA staining dimeric cyanine fluorophore), and SlowFade kit were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). FluoroLink Cy5-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG was from Amersham Biosciences. The mammalian expression vector pCi-neo, Renilla luciferase expression plasmid pRL-CMV, dual luciferase reporter assay system, and CheckMate mammalian two-hybrid system were from Promega (Madison, WI). LipofectAMINE 2000, used for DNA transfections, was purchased from Invitrogen. All reagents and solvents used were of the highest grade available and were cell culture tested as necessary. CD of ACBP and HNF-4α-LBD—Far-UV circular dichroic spectra of HNF-4α-LBD and ACBP in 2 mm Tri-HCl, pH 8, containing 0.5% glycerol and 0.05 mm dithiothreitol were measured separately and in mixture. The CD measurements were performed with a J-710 Spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Baltimore, MD) using a 1-mm cuvette. Spectra were recorded from 250 to 195 nm at 50 nm/min with a time constant of 1 s and a bandwidth of 2 nm. For each CD profile an average of 10 scans was obtained. Percentages of various secondary structures in HNF-4α-LBD, ACBP, and (HNF-4α-LBD + ACBP) were calculated from CD spectra by using the CDstr program (26Hennessey J.P. Johnson W.C. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1085-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 27Compton L.A. Johnson Jr., W.C. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). The CD spectrum of (ACBP + HNF-4α-LBD) was compared with a theoretical spectrum obtained by summing the spectra of the HNF-4α-LBD and ACBP recorded separately for each protein in a concentration equal to that in the mixture. Because of the molecular weight difference between ACBP (10,000 Da) and HNF-4α-LBD (amino acids 132-455; 36,172 Da), 4 μm ACBP and 1.11 μm HNF-4α-LBD solutions were used, respectively, such that the molar concentrations of amino acids were equivalent. For mixtures of the two proteins, 2 μm ACBP and 0.56 μm HNF-4α-LBD were used in order to (i) maintain equivalent concentrations of amino acids from the two proteins and (ii) maintain the same total concentration of amino acids as was used for CD of the individual proteins. ACBP and HNF-4α-LBD Antisera for Coimmunoprecipitation, Western Blotting, and Immunocytochemistry—Rabbit polyclonal anti-rat ACBP and anti-rat HNF-4α-LBD antisera were obtained as described previously (6Chao H. Martin G. Russell W.K. Waghela S.D. Russell D.H. Schroeder F. Kier A.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10540-10553Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 9Gossett R.E. Edmondson R.D. Jolly C.A. Cho T.H. Russell D.H. Knudsen J. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The specificity of appropriate dilutions of the purified anti-ACBP antibodies for Western blotting was determined as described earlier (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Anti-ACBP antisera did not cross-react with HNF-4α-LBD, HNF-4α. For fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) determined by laser scanning confocal microscopy, pure fractions of anti-ACBP and HNF-4α IgGs were prepared using an Econo-Pac protein kit from Bio-Rad as described earlier (29Wouters F. Bastiaens P.I. Wirtz K.W. Jovin T.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7179-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 30Kenworthy A.K. Methods. 2001; 24: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The pure IgGs were then Cy3-labeled (anti-HNF-4α IgG) or Cy5-labeled (anti-ACBP IgG) using a Fluorolink-antibody Cy3 and Cy5 labeling kit from Amersham Biosciences according to the manufacturer's instructions. Coimmunoprecipitation—The ability of polyclonal anti-ACBP or polyclonal anti-HNF-4α-LBD antiserum to coimmunoprecipitate both proteins from mouse liver homogenate and rat hepatoma cells was tested. Mouse liver was diced in RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor mixture (1 ml of buffer per 200 mg of liver tissue) and subjected to 30 strokes within a Dounce homogenizer. RIPA buffer consisted of 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS (31Uittenbogaard A. Ying Y.S. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6525-6532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Unbroken cells and debris were removed by centrifugation at 600 × g for 5 min. Homogenates of mouse liver and hepatoma cells were incubated with antibodies against rat ACBP, rat-HNF-4α-LBD, mouse GR, and mouse Sp1 protein, respectively, at 4 °C overnight. Protein A-Sepharose 4CL was blocked for nonspecific binding with 2% bovine serum albumin in RIPA buffer, added to the overnight immunoprecipitated complexes, and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. After extensive washings with 500 mm NaCl in RIPA buffer, the beads were solubilized in 2× sample buffer for further SDS-PAGE separation and Western blotting. The immunoprecipitates were tested for the presence of ACBP, HNF-4α, Sp1 protein, and GR by Western blotting as follows. Western Blotting—Protein concentration was determined by BCA Protein Assay (Pierce). SDS-PAGE and protein transfer on nitrocellulose membranes were performed as described (17Petrescu A.D. Hertz R. Bar-Tana J. Schroeder F. Kier A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23988-23999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207192) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies used in Western blotting were rabbit anti-rat ACBP and anti-rat-HNF-4α-LBD polyclonal antibodies prepared as described above. Specific proteins were visualized either by a colorimetric method utilizing alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrate (Sigma) or by a chemiluminescent method employing horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and luminol/hydrogen peroxide substrates (Amersham Biosciences). Detection of ACBP·HNF-4α Complexes by Immunoelectron Microscopy in Mouse Liver—Four-month-old mice were anesthetized with tribromoethanol and perfused through the left heart ventricle with 3% formaldehyde, 0.05% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, with 3.2% sucrose. After 5 min of perfusion at 24 °C, the liver was collected, minced, and immersed in the same fixative for 1 h at 4 °C and then washed with 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer containing 3.5% sucrose. The tissue was treated with 0.25% tannic acid for 1 h at 4 °C and with 2% uranyl acetate in 70% ethanol cooled at -35 °C for 40 min, and then dehydrated in an ethanol series and embedded in Lowicryl K4M resin. Ultrathin tissue sections (50-60 nm) were placed on Formvar-coated nickel grids and immunogold stained with anti-ACBP antiserum raised in rat (diluted 1:50-1:80) alone or in mixture with either anti-HNF-4α or anti-glucocorticoid receptor, raised in rabbit (diluted 1:150). These sections were washed and incubated with a mixture of goat anti-rat conjugated to 6-nm gold particles and goat anti-rabbit conjugated to 15-nm gold particles. All sections were post-stained very briefly with aqueous uranyl acetate and Reynold's lead citrate and examined with a Zeiss 10c transmission electron microscope. Cell Culture—COS-7 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Rat hepatoma cells T-7 were generously provided by Dr. Charles Baum (University of Chicago, Chicago). The cells were grown in high glucose/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. 4-Well LabTek chamber slides were used for the immunofluorescence confocal microscopy experiments, and 6-well plates and 10-cm cell culture dishes for all the other purposes (e.g. transfection experiments). Preparation of Cells for Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy— COS-7 and rat hepatoma cells grown in 4-well LabTek chamber slides were washed with Hanks' solution, fixed with 70:30 acetone/ethanol (v/v) for 30 min at -20 °C, and blocked against nonspecific binding with 10% fetal bovine serum in Hanks' solution for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies for another 1 h at room temperature. After extensive washing of unbound antibodies with Hanks' solution, the cells were mounted by the use of Slow Fade kit. Rabbit anti-rat HNF-4α polyclonal, rat anti-mouse ACBP polyclonal, and mouse anti-firefly luciferase monoclonal antisera were used as primary antibodies. Texas Red goat anti-rabbit IgG, FITC goat anti-rat-IgG, and FluoroLink Cy5-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG were used as secondary antibodies. In some experiments the nuclear areas of cells were defined by staining the DNA with TOTO-3, a dimeric cyanine fluorophore. Specificity of immunostaining was determined by deleting the primary antibody and using either one or both secondary antibodies. Several dilutions (1:20-1:200) of each primary and secondary antibody were tested and optimized. This minimized nonspecific adsorption of fluorescent antibodies, ensured separation of the fluorescent signals, and optimized fluorophore concentration to preclude self-quenching (33Musch A. Cohen D. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 291-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). LSCM and Image Analysis—LSCM was performed on an MRC-1024 fluorescence imaging system (Bio-Rad) consisting of an Axiovert 135 microscope (Zeiss, New York) equipped with three independent low noise photomultiplier tube channels. The excitation light (λ = 488, 568, and 647 nm) from a 15-milliwatt krypton-argon laser was delivered to the sample through ×63 Zeiss Plan-Fluor oil immersion objective, numerical aperture 1.45. Texas Red and Cy3 were excited at 568 nm, and their emission was detected through an HQ 585/40 bandpass filter. FITC was excited with 488 nm light, and its emission was selected through a 540/30 filter. TOTO-3 (DNA stain) and Cy5 were excited with 647 nm light and their emission selected through a 680/32 bandpass filter. The conventional colors of emitted light were red (for Texas Red and Cy3), green (for FITC), and blue (for Cy5 and TOTO-3). Images were acquired and analyzed using LaserSharp (from Bio-Rad) and MetaMorph Image Analysis (from Advanced Scientific Imaging, Meraux, LA) software. Colocalization analysis was performed on an average of 20 cells from four different wells, and the results obtained are shown for a representative set of cells. LaserSharp version 3.0 software was used for colocalization analysis, and two values (colocalization coefficients) were calculated based on Pearson's correlation coefficient, which is a well established means of describing the degree of overlap between patterns or images (34Manders E.M.M. Verbeek F.J. Aten J.A. J. Microsc. (Oxf.). 1993; 169: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1527) Google Scholar). The software calculated the colocalization (coloc) coefficients for two different fluorophores, designated red (R) and green (G) herein, according to the following equations: Cred = Σ Ri,coloc/Σ Ri and Cgreen = Σ Gi,coloc/Σ Gi. In these equations Σ Ri,coloc represents the sum of intensities of all red pixels that also have a green component; Σ Ri is the sum of all the red pixels in the image; Σ Gi,coloc represents the sum of intensities of all green pixels that have a red component; Σ Gi is the sum of intensities of all green pixels in the image. The coefficients generated by LaserSharp have values between 0 and 1; a value of 0 indicates that there is no colocalization, whereas a value of 1.0 means there is complete colocalization. Similarly, for three channel images (designated red, green, and blue, respectively) analyses were performed not only to compare red and green colocalization but also green with blue and red with blue. These three channel analyses yielded three different colocalization coefficients, one for each pair of color combinations. The software allowed for independent background selection and subtraction before calculation of the coefficients. Fluorograms were generated from the entire image, displaying the intensity and distribution of different colored pixels within the merged image as a scattergram. FRET Microscopy—In order to estimate the intermolecular distance between ACBP and HNF-4α molecules that were detected colocalized in confocal microscopy images, FRET between Cy3-labeled anti-HNF-4α IgG and Cy5-labeled anti-ACBP IgG was determined as described earlier (29Wouters F. Bastiaens P.I. Wirtz K.W. Jovin T.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7179-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 30Kenworthy A.K. Methods. 2001; 24: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Rat hepatoma cells were processed as for immunofluorescence microscopy, except that only primary antibodies that had been Cy3- and Cy5-labeled were used. Qualitatively, FRET from Cy3 to Cy5 was demonstrated by detection of sensitized emission of Cy5 (through the 680/32 bandpass filter) upon excitation of Cy3 at 568 nm, after correction of some bleed through of Cy3 emission through the same filter as follows. Fluorescence emission through 680/32 filter was recorded before and after photobleaching Cy5 at 647 nm for 3 min (the duration of photobleaching was optimized such that a good decrease in Cy5 fluorescence was obtained without affecting the emission intensity of Cy3). The image recorded after photobleaching Cy5 was the bleed through of Cy3 emission through PMT3 (with 680/32 bandpass filter). Fluorescence intensity of emission through this 680/32 filter before photobleaching Cy5 (FRET acceptor), being the sum resulted from sensitized emission of Cy5 and the bleed through of Cy5, was always higher than the one taken after Cy5 photobleaching, clearly indicating FRET from Cy3 to Cy5. Quantitative measurements for FRET efficiency estimation were carried out as described (29Wouters F. Bastiaens P.I. Wirtz K.W. Jovin T.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7179-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). FRET efficiency was calculated according to E = (Ipost - Ipre)/Ipost, where E is FRET efficiency; Ipost is the acceptor (Cy3) fluorescence intensity after Cy5 photobleach, and Ipre is the acceptor (Cy3) fluorescence intensity before Cy5 photobleach. An average value of E was calculated from measurements of Cy3 fluorescence emission increase after Cy5 photobleaching in 50 different cells. The calculated E was further used to estimate R, the intermolecular distance between Cy3 and Cy5 (distance ultimately dictated in this experiment by the proximity between ACBP and HNF-4α), according to E = 1/(1 + (R/R0)6), where R0, the distance for which a 50% FRET efficiency occurs, is known to be 50 Å for the Cy3/Cy5 FRET pair. DNA Constructs and Plasmids Used in Transfection Assays—COS-7 and rat hepatoma cells were transfected with the following expression and reporter plasmids. A set of sense and antisense mouse ACBP expression vectors was constructed by inserting the 276-bp ACBP cDNA into an XhoI cloning site of pCI-neo mammalian expression vector purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). For an efficient repression of ACBP expression, an antisense ACBP vector was constructed using a pUC plasmid that contained the mouse pgk-1 gene promoter, as described (35Adra C.N. Boer P.H.

K., Mochizuki, N., Kasai, Y., Georgescu, S. P., Tang, K. M., Ito, M., Lincoln, T. M., and Mendelsohn, M. E. (1999) Science 286, 1583-1587). Alternative splicing of a 3′-exon produces a LZ+ or LZ- MBS, and the sensitivity to cGMP-mediated smooth muscle relaxation correlates with the relative expression of LZ+/LZ- MBS isoforms (Khatri, J. J., Joyce, K. M., Brozovich, F. V., and Fisher, S. A. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 37250 -37257). In the present study, we determined the effect of LZ+/LZ- MBS isoforms on cGMP-induced MLC20 dephosphorylation. Four avian smooth muscle MBS-recombinant adenoviruses were prepared and transfected into cultured embryonic chicken gizzard smooth muscle cells. The expressed exogenous MBS isoforms were shown to replace the endogenous isoform in the MLC phosphatase holoenzyme. The interaction of type I PKG (PKGI) with the MBS did not depend on the presence of cGMP or the MBS LZ. However, direct activation of PKGI by 8-bromo-cGMP produced a dose-dependent decrease in MLC20 phosphorylation (p < 0.05) only in smooth muscle cells expressing a LZ+ MBS. These results suggest that the activation of MLC phosphatase by PKGI requires a LZ+ MBS, but the binding of PKGI to the MBS is not mediated by a LZ-LZ interaction. Thus, the relative expression of LZ+/LZ- MBS isoforms could explain differences in tissue sensitivity to NO-mediated vasodilatation.

Recent evidence (11.Lincoln T.M. Pharmacol.

PKGI mediates smooth muscle cell relaxation by several mechanisms. It has been demonstrated that PKGI acts on the maxi K+ channel to produce hyperpolarization of the smooth muscle (12.Alioua A.

(Lond.). 2000; 524: 865-878Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). MLC phosphatase is a holoenzyme consisting of a catalytic subunit (PP1cδ); a myosin-binding subunit (MBS), which is also referred to as the myosin-targeting subunit (MYPT1); and a 20-kDa subunit of unknown function (5.Hartshorne D.J. Ito M. Erdîdi F. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 325-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The activation of MLC phosphatase by PKGI is hypothesized to be due to a leucine zipper-leucine zipper (LZ-LZ) interaction of the N-terminal LZ of PKGIα and the C-terminal LZ of the MBS of MLC phosphatase (1.Surks H.K. Mochizuki N. Kasai Y. Georgescu S.P. Tang K.M. Ito M. Lincoln T.M. Mendelsohn M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1583-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 2.Khatri J.J. Joyce K.M. Brozovich F.V. Fisher S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37250-37257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The MBS has four major isoforms, which are produced by alternative RNA splicing of two different exons (5.Hartshorne D.J. Ito M. Erdîdi F. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 325-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Tissue-specific and developmentally regulated alternative splicing of a 123-bp central exon produces a 41-amino acid central insert (19.Dirksen W.P. Vladic F. Fisher S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C589-C600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternative splicing of the 31-bp 3′-exon is responsible for the expression of LZ+ or LZ- MBS isoforms (5.Hartshorne D.J. Ito M. Erdîdi F. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 325-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Specifically, exclusion of the 3′-exon shifts the reading frame of the MBS transcript to encode a C-terminal LZ (2.Khatri J.J. Joyce K.M. Brozovich F.V. Fisher S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37250-37257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that sensitivity to cGMP-mediated relaxation correlates with the relative expression of LZ+/LZ- MBS isoforms (2.Khatri J.J. Joyce K.M. Brozovich F.V. Fisher S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37250-37257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), which is consistent with the activation of MLC phosphatase activity resulting from a LZ-LZ interaction of PKGIα with the MBS (1.Surks H.K. Mochizuki N. Kasai Y. Georgescu S.P. Tang K.M. Ito M. Lincoln T.M. Mendelsohn M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1583-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that cGMP-dependent activation of MLC phosphatase activity and smooth muscle vasodilatation are due to a LZ-LZ interaction of PKGIα and MBS by changing the expression of the MBS isoform, in isolation, and determining the effect on cGMP-mediated MLC20 dephosphorylation in primary cultured smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Cloning of the Chicken MBS of the MLC Phosphatase cDNA Fragment—Total RNA was isolated from fresh chicken gizzard and urinary bladder smooth muscle tissues using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Full-length cDNA encoding the MBS was synthesized by reverse transcription-PCR using the total RNA as template. We used primers 5′-GCGGCGATAGCGAGGGGGTCAG-3′ and 5′-CAGGTAAGAGGGCATTTGGCAGGATA-3′, flanking the MBS cDNA sequence between bp +86 and +3382 (20.Shimizu H. Ito M. Miyahara M. Ichikawa K. Okubo S. Konishi T. Naka M. Tanaka T. Hirano K. Hartshorne D.J. Nakano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30407-30411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PCR products were cloned into the pCR2.1 plasmid vector (Invitrogen). cDNAs corresponding to four alternative splicing variants of the chicken smooth muscle MBS, differing in the inclusion or exclusion of a central exon and a 3′-exon, were screened (see Fig. 1) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Note that the sequence at base 1822 is C instead of G, which encodes position 568; the GTT (valine) reported by Shimizu et al. (20.Shimizu H. Ito M. Miyahara M. Ichikawa K. Okubo S. Konishi T. Naka M. Tanaka T. Hirano K. Hartshorne D.J. Nakano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30407-30411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is CTT (leucine) in eight independent clones obtained by reverse transcription-PCR. Construction of Recombinant Adenoviruses Encoding MBS Isoforms—Recombinant adenoviruses were generated using the AdEasy system (21.He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar). The four MBS cDNAs were individually cloned into transfer vector pAdTrack-CMV (9.2 kb, kanamycin-resistant) downstream of a cytomegalovirus promoter. This vector has a second cytomegalovirus promoter expressing green florescent protein. Escherichia coli BJ5183 cells were first transformed with supercoiled adenoviral backbone DNA pAdEasy-1 (33.4 kb, ampicillin-resistant). The transformants were confirmed by restriction enzyme mapping and then prepared in competent cells by an acid salt method (22.Alexander D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 41-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For in vivo homologous recombination in the bacterial cell, ∼0.5-1 μg of linearized MBS-pAdTrack (12.5 kb) recombinant plasmid DNA was transformed into the above competent E. coli cells, followed by plating on LB agar medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin. The MBS-recombinant adenovirus plasmids were retransformed into a recA- strain of E. coli (JM109) for large-scale DNA preparation and verified by restriction enzyme mapping and PCR using two pairs of specific MBS primers: 5′-1620/3′-2069 (flanking the central alternative exon) and 5′-2888/3′-3203 (flanking the 3′-end alternative exon), respectively (see Fig. 1). To produce the MBS-recombinant adenovirus, 293 mammalian packaging cells (Quantum Biotechnology) were grown to ∼70% confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. 5 μg of each MBS-recombinant adenovirus plasmid DNA was linearized by the restriction enzyme PacI and used for transfection of 293 cells with LipofectAMINE™ 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The amplified MBS-recombinant viruses and their protein products in 293 cells were verified by PCR as described above and by Western blotting using anti-MYPT1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), respectively (Fig. 1). After verification, a few rounds of amplification were performed in 293 cells to produce high titer viral stocks. All four MBS-recombinant adenoviruses and an adenovirus vector control were titrated by plaque forming units in 293 cell cultures. Preparation of Chicken Smooth Muscle Cells—Primary cultures of chicken gizzard SMCs were isolated from day 15 embryos using a modification of a previously described method (23.Huang Q.Q. Fisher S.A. Brozovich F.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35095-35098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 24.Hayashi K. Saga H. Chimori Y. Kimura K. Yamanaka Y. Sobue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28860-28867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Briefly, after being minced into fine pieces, the gizzard tissue was incubated in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Cellgro) containing 0.15% (w/v) collagenase type I (Worthington) at 37 °C for 20∼40 min. Dispersed single cells were collected by passing the cell suspension through a cell strainer (70 μm; BD Biosciences). The cells were then collected by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 5 min and washed twice with cell culture medium (50:50 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and nutrient mixture F-12 medium plus 0.5% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin). The cells were suspended in cell culture medium and plated in culture dishes at 3-4 × 104 cells/cm2. Overnight cultures of the cells at ∼50-70% confluence were used for experiments. All cells used in this experiment were maintained in low concentration fetal bovine serum (0.5%) cell culture medium and did not undergo any further passage. MBS-Recombinant Adenovirus Infection—18-24 h after plating, the SMC monolayers were infected with MBS-recombinant adenoviruses or adenovirus vector control at a multiplicity of infection of 40-100. This dosage was optimized to infect >50% of the SMCs without visible cytopathic effects. The viral stock was mixed with the same cell culture medium and added to the culture dish at 50 μl/cm2. The culture dishes were slowly rocked at 37 °C for 2 h. The infected cell cultures were supplemented with culture medium to 200 μl/cm2 and maintained at 37 °C for 48 h. The infection of SMCs was indicated by the expression of green florescent protein as visualized under a fluorescence microscope. The expression levels of exogenous and endogenous MBS isoforms in all experimental SMCs were verified by PCR and Western blotting as described below. Western Blot Analyses—Total protein was extracted from cultured SMCs or chicken tissue samples in SDS sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE at an acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio of 29:1. MBS was resolved using 6% gels, PKGI and calponin using 10% gels, and MLC20 and PP1cδ using 15% gels. Following SDS-PAGE separation, protein bands were electrophoretically transferred to 0.45-μm pore nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schüll) in buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, 192 mm glycine, and 10% (v/v) methanol at 280 mA for 40 min. The protein bands were visualized on the blot either by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrate reaction or by an ECL Plus Western blot detection system (Amersham Biosciences). The antibodies used were anti-MYPT1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. and Covance), anti-PKGIα and anti-PKGIβ (Stressgen Biotech Corp.), anti-calponin CP3 (25.Jin J.-P. Walsh M.P. Resetar A. McMartin G.A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), anti-PP1cδ (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), and anti-MLC20 (Sigma). The secondary antibodies specific to the first antibody used were alkaline phosphatase-conjugated and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated for 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrate reaction and ECL, respectively. Co-immunoprecipitation—Adherent SMCs (∼0.5-1 × 107 cells) were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed on ice with 0.5 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer A (1.Surks H.K. Mochizuki N. Kasai Y. Georgescu S.P. Tang K.M. Ito M. Lincoln T.M. Mendelsohn M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1583-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 600 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 7 mm MgCl2, 2 mg/ml N-dodecyl-β-maltoside, 0.4 mg/ml cholesteryl hemisuccinate, 10 mm sodium molybdate, 10% (v/v) protease inhibitor, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Chicken aortic and gizzard tissues were homogenized as we described previously (2.Khatri J.J. Joyce K.M. Brozovich F.V. Fisher S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37250-37257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The cell or tissue lysate was gently rotated for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell lysate was then precleaned with ∼10% (v/v) protein G-Sepharose™ slurry (Amersham Biosciences) by rotating at 4 °C for 90 min and incubated with either 10 μl of anti-PP1cδ antibody or 5 μl of anti-PKGIα antibody with normal rabbit serum as a negative control. After rotating the lysate/antibody mixture overnight at 4 °C, the same quantity of protein G-Sepharose™ slurry was added and incubated by rotation at 4 °C for 2 h. After washing three times with ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, the protein G-Sepharose beads were collected, suspended in 50 μl of SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described above. cGMP Stimulation of Cultured SMCs and Measurement of MLC20Phosphorylation—A less hydrolyzable, cell-permeable analog of cGMP, 8-bromo (Br)-cGMP (sodium salt; Calbiochem), was serially diluted from 10-3 to 10-6m in the medium of SMC monolayer cultures and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min to stimulate PKG. The reaction was stopped by removal of the culture medium and immediate addition of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid (Sigma) in water containing 10 mm dithiothreitol, followed by freezing at -70 °C to allow proteins to precipitate. The cells were then scraped into 10% trichloroacetic acid solution and transferred to microcentrifuge tubes. The protein precipitates were collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. After washing twice with 100% acetone containing 10 mm dithiothreitol, the pellet was air-dried, resuspended in 50 μl of urea sample buffer (8 m urea, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 22 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.6), 22 mm glycine, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue), and incubated at room temperature for 45 min to dissolve the protein. The samples were then cleaned by passing through an Ultrafree-MC centrifugal filter (Amicon, Inc.) at 12,000 × g for 5 min. Non-phosphorylated MLC20, monophosphorylated MLC20 (P1-MLC20), and diphosphorylated MLC20 (P2-MLC20) were resolved by electrophoresis using a urea/glycerol-PAGE system with 10% polyacrylamide (acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio of 19:1), 40% (v/v) glycerol, 22 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.6), and 22 mm glycine (26.Richards C.T. Ogut O. Brozovich F.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4422-4427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 27.Hathaway D.R. Haeberle J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: C345-C351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), running at 300 V for 5-6 h in buffer containing 22 mm Tris-HCl, 22 mm glycine, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% thioglycolic acid (pH 8.6). The gel was then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for Western blotting as described above. MLC20 bands were identified using anti-MLC20 antibody and quantified by Scion Image Beta Version 4.0.2 software. The percentage of phosphorylated MLC20 was calculated by the ratio of phosphorylated MLC20 to total MLC20 (P1-MLC20 or P2-MLC20/(P1-MLC20 + P2-MLC20 + MLC20)). The data are expressed as a percentage of phosphorylated MLC20 (P1-MLC20 or P2-MLC20) against unstimulated controls. All values are means ± S.D., and p < 0.05 was taken as the level for significance. The full-length chicken smooth muscle MBS cDNA is 4.7 kb, with the coding region from base 121 to 3251 (20.Shimizu H. Ito M. Miyahara M. Ichikawa K. Okubo S. Konishi T. Naka M. Tanaka T. Hirano K. Hartshorne D.J. Nakano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30407-30411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternative RNA splicing of a central exon and the 3′-exon produces several different protein isoforms, and the expression of these isoforms is both developmentally regulated and tissue-specific (2.Khatri J.J. Joyce K.M. Brozovich F.V. Fisher S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37250-37257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 19.Dirksen W.P. Vladic F. Fisher S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C589-C600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The MBS isoforms differ by the presence or absence of the central insert (CI+ or CI-) and the C-terminal LZ (LZ+ or LZ-). In this study, four distinct cDNAs encoding the CI+/LZ+, CI+/LZ-, CI-/LZ+ and CI-/LZ- isoforms, respectively, were cloned and successfully expressed in both a mammalian cell line and primary cultured avian SMCs. It has been well documented that primary cultured SMCs under conventional serum-stimulated conditions quickly convert from a differentiated to dedifferentiated state. The degree of dedifferentiation is related to the time and passage in culture (28.Kashiwada K. Nishida W. Hayashi K. Ozawa K. Yamanaka Y. Saga H. Yamashita T. Tohyama M. Shimada S. Sato K. Sobue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15396-15404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and it has been documented that the expression of PKG is rapidly down-regulated with the passage of SMCs (29.Chiche J.D. Schlutsmeyer S.M. Bloch D.B. de la Monte S.M. Roberts Jr., J.D. Filippov G. Janssens S.P. Rosenzweig A. Bloch K.D. J. Biol.

In our experiments, the number of freshly isolated single cells obtained during isolation from the tissue was sufficient, so the cells did not need to be passaged; and the chicken gizzard SMCs were always kept in low serum (0.5%) medium to maintain a differentiated state. The SMCs for these conditions expressed ∼60% of the PKG compared with tissue at this stage and markers of the differentiated state such as calponin and smooth muscle myosin light chain and heavy chain (data not shown). Recombinant adenoviruses are currently used for a variety of purposes, including gene transfer. We chose this technique as the delivery vehicle to bring the MBS expression construct into SMCs because it has a high transfection efficiency, and SMCs do not need to be passaged for transfection. Normally, 60-100% of the cells are infected. SMCs infected by recombinant adenovirus express predominantly the expected exogenous MBS isoform. The exogenous MBS was overexpressed at levels 5-10 times higher than the endogenous MBS (Fig. 2), without changing the level of expression of other major smooth muscle proteins, including PKGI (both α and β isoforms), calponin, PP1cδ, and MLC20, compared with the uninfected control SMCs or SMCs infected with a adenovirus vector alone (Fig. 2). Co-immunoprecipitation assays using anti-PP1cδ antibody were performed to capture PP1cδ from the lysate of SMCs overexpressing a single MBS isoform to determine whether the exogenous MBS replaced the endogenous isoform of MBS in the MLC phosphatase holoenzyme. The results show that the immunoprecipitates of PP1cδ in all groups of the cell lysates contained MBS isoform patterns similar to those in the corresponding whole cell lysate (Fig. 3A), indicating that the overexpressed exogenous MBS isoform was proportionally assembled into the MLC phosphatase complex to replace the endogenous MBS isoform in the holoenzyme. Co-immunoprecipitation by anti-PKGI antibody was used to determine whether PKGI was associated with the MBS. Our results demonstrate that, in cultured SMCs, neither the LZ+ nor LZ- MBS isoforms bound to PKGI (Fig. 3B). This contrasts with the results obtained with both embryonic and day 7 chicken aortic and gizzard tissues, where we found that both LZ+ and LZ- MBS isoforms associated with PKGI, and although the association did not depend on the presence of cGMP, cGMP appeared to increase the binding of the MBS to PKGI in the aorta (Fig. 3C). Comparing adult gizzard, aorta, and SMCs, the PKG/MBS ratio was highest in adult gizzard and lowest in cultured SMCs. It has been reported that the interaction of the N-terminal LZ of PKGIα (but not PKGIβ) mediates cGMP-stimulated smooth muscle relaxation through interaction with the C-terminal LZ of the MBS of MLC phosphatase (1.Surks H.K. Mochizuki N. Kasai Y. Georgescu S.P. Tang K.M. Ito M. Lincoln T.M. Mendelsohn M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1583-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). We used both reverse transcription-PCR with PKGIα or PKGIβ isoform-specific primers and Western blotting with both a PKGI-nonspecific antibody and a PKGIβ-specific antibody to show the expression of PKGIα versus PKGIβ in embryonic and adult chicken aortic and gizzard smooth muscle tissues as well as in cultured SMCs (Fig. 4). Expression of PKGI in embryonic day 15 chicken aortic and gizzard smooth muscle tissues was similar; and after 72 h in culture, PKGI expression in the SMCs was 50-60% of the level at embryonic day 15. In addition, the expression of PKGI was up-regulated in aortic and down-regulated in gizzard smooth muscle tissues during development and after hatching (Fig. 4). The Western blots confirm that, in the smooth muscle tissue, only PKGIα was expressed (Fig. 4). In cultured SMCs, PKGIα expression predominated, as PKGIβ was barely detected (Fig. 4). MLC20 phosphorylation levels were determined after stimulation of infected monolayer cultures of SMCs with 8-Br-cGMP. The control cultured SMCs expressed an endogenous MBS isoform that was CI+ and LZ+. 8-Br-cGMP stimulation resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the level of phosphorylation of MLC20 (P2-MLC20) in SMCs expressing a LZ+ MBS (Fig. 5). In uninfected control SMCs as well as in SMCs infected with adenovirus vector or MBS-recombinant adenoviruses expressing an exogenous LZ+ MBS, the level of P2-MLC20 decreased to ∼65% of the unstimulated control at 0.01-1 mm 8-Br-cGMP. However, in cells overexpressing LZ- MBS isoforms, 8-Br-cGMP produced a significant decrease in MLC20 phosphorylation only at the highest concentration of 8-Br-cGMP (10-3m) (Fig. 5). These results suggest that the expression of the C-terminal LZ of the MBS may be required for PKG to activate MLC phosphatase during cGMP-mediated smooth muscle relaxation. In this study, we have shown that we could change the expression of the MBS isoform of the MLC phosphatase, in isolation, without changing the expression of other contractile proteins (Fig. 2), and the exogenous MBS isoform replaced the endogenous isoform in the MLC phosphatase holoenzyme (Fig. 3A). Our data show that cGMP stimulation of MLC phosphatase containing a LZ+ MBS isoform produced a dose-dependent decrease in MLC20 phosphorylation, whereas cGMP stimulation of MLC phosphatase containing LZ- MBS isoforms did not produce dose-dependent dephosphorylation of MLC20 (Fig. 5). These data demonstrate that, in cultured SMCs, a LZ+ MBS is required for PKG activation of MLC phosphatase activity. Previous studies have suggested that the activation of MLC phosphatase by PKG is due to a LZ-LZ interaction of PKGIα and the MBS (1.Surks H.K. Mochizuki N. Kasai Y. Georgescu S.P. Tang K.M. Ito M. Lincoln T.M. Mendelsohn M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1583-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). A series of PKG constructs were used to show that only PKG with the LZ would co-immunoprecipitate with the MBS. Our co-immunoprecipitation studies with the cultured chicken SMCs did not detect an association of either LZ+ or LZ- MBS isoforms with PKG. However, in both embryonic and adult smooth muscle tissues, we observed the association of both LZ+ (aortic) and LZ- (adult gizzard) MBS isoforms with PKG (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that the MBS LZ is not required for an association of PKG and the MBS. We also found that the interaction of PKG and the MBS was unrelated to the presence of cGMP, although cGMP appeared to enhance the association in aortic tissue (Fig. 3C). This result is similar to our previous report (2.Khatri J.J. Joyce K.M. Brozovich F.V. Fisher S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37250-37257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), where the LZ+ MBS was associated with PKG. In this study (2.Khatri J.J. Joyce K.M. Brozovich F.V. Fisher S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37250-37257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), we could not co-immunoprecipitate the LZ- MBS and PKG from adult chicken gizzard, possibly because the expression of PKG was rapidly down-regulated after hatching (Fig. 4). These results suggest that a LZ-LZ interaction does not mediate the interaction of PKG with the MBS. It is unclear why we did not observe association of the MBS and PKG in cultured SMCs, whereas the MBS and PKG were associated in both the presence and absence of cGMP in chicken tissue expressing either LZ+ or LZ- MBS isoforms. However, in the cultured SMCs, we can rule out that the absence of an association of the MBS with PKG is due to a lack of PKGIα expression (Fig. 4). Our data show that an association between PKG and the MBS is not required for cGMP to activate MLC phosphatase activity, although a LZ+ MBS isoform is necessary for cGMP to stimulate MLC20 dephosphorylation. PKG has multiple targets in smooth muscle (1.Surks H.K. Mochizuki N. Kasai Y. Georgescu S.P. Tang K.M. Ito M. Lincoln T.M. Mendelsohn M.E.

Our data suggest that an association of PKG and the MBS is needed for PKG to efficiently activate MLC phosphatase activity, and the lack of this interaction in cultured SMCs could explain the difference in sensitivity to cGMP in chicken tissue with a LZ+ MBS, where force relaxation is seen at 0.1 μm 8-Br-cGMP (2.Khatri J.J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 37250-37257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and in cultured SMCs expressing LZ+ MBS isoforms, where MLC20 dephosphorylation begins between 1 and 10 μm 8-Br-cGMP (Fig. 5). However, both in our previous report performed with smooth muscle strips (2.Khatri J.J. Joyce K.M. Brozovich F.V. Fisher S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37250-37257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and in the present study of cultured SMCs, a LZ+ MBS is required for cGMP-mediated smooth muscle relaxation. Taken together, these results suggest that the interaction of PKG with the MBS is not due to a LZ-LZ interaction, but could be due to an interaction of a coiled-coil domain of PKG with the coiled-coil domain of the MBS. The MBS has a predicted coiled-coil domain between amino acids 647-705 and amino acids 888-928 (30.Langsetmo K. Stafford III, W.F. Mabuchi K. Tao T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34318-34322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar); and similarly, the N-terminal 10-46 residues of PKGI have a 100% probability of a coiled-coil domain structure. 2T. Tao, personal communication. It should be noted that all of the constructs of PKG used by Surks et al. (1.Surks H.K. Mochizuki N. Kasai Y. Georgescu S.P. Tang K.M. Ito M. Lincoln T.M. Mendelsohn M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1583-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) containing the LZ also contained the coiled-coil domain, and mutations that disrupted the coiled-coil domain of PKGI inhibited binding of PKG and the MBS. Thus, the results of Surks et al. could also be consistent with an interaction of the coiled-coil domain of PKG with the coiled-coil domain of the MBS. The mechanism for activation of MLC phosphatase by PKG is unknown. It is possible that PKG and the MBS interact via coiled-coil domains, and activation of MLC phosphatase activity could be due to phosphorylation of the MBS by PKG. It has been reported that PKG phosphorylates the MBS (1.Surks H.K. Mochizuki N. Kasai Y. Georgescu S.P. Tang K.M. Ito M. Lincoln T.M. Mendelsohn M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1583-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). PKG binding to substrates is mediated by an Arg-Arg or Arg-Lys sequence (31.Dostmann W.R. Taylor M.S. Nickl C.K. Brayden J.E. Frank R. Tegge W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14772-14777Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and PKG phosphorylates at a Ser-Ser sequence (32.MacDonald J.A. Walker L.A. Nakamoto R.K. Gorenne I. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. Haystead T.A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 479: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). There are consensus sites for PKG binding at residues 841 and 842 (Arg-Arg) and residues 847 and 848 (Arg-Arg), and a Ser-Ser phosphorylation site lies at residues 790-794 of the MBS, all of which are between the two predicted coiled-coil domains of the MBS. Another PKG-binding site can be found at residues 916 and 917 (Arg-Lys); and similarly, another Ser-Ser sequence lies at residues 895 and 896 of the MBS, which are within one of the predicted coiled-coil domains (amino acids 888-928) and ∼100 residues from the beginning of the C-terminal LZ (amino acid 1002). It could be that the presence of the C-terminal LZ in the MBS exposes the more C-terminal binding and phosphorylation sites to PKG and allows for PKG to bind to and phosphorylate the MBS and thus to increase MLC phosphatase activity. In LZ- MBS isoforms, PKG could bind to the MBS, but the phosphorylation sites may not be accessible to PKG, and MLC phosphatase with a LZ- MBS would not be activated by PKG. In summary, the results of this study suggest that PKG binds to the MBS, possibly via coiled-coil domain interactions, and the activation of MLC phosphatase activity by PKG requires an LZ+ MBS. The expression of LZ+ MBS isoforms is developmentally regulated and tissue-specific (2.Khatri J.J. Joyce K.M. Brozovich F.V. Fisher S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37250-37257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar); and thus, the tissue diversity in the sensitivity to NO-mediated vasodilatation in smooth muscle could be determined, in part, by the relative expression of LZ+/LZ- MBS isoforms.

https://openalex.org/W2153061750,"X-ray and electron diffraction studies of specific reaction intermediates, or reaction intermediate analogues, have produced a consistent picture of the structural mechanism of light-driven proton pumping by bacteriorhodopsin. Of central importance within this picture is the structure of the L-intermediate, which follows the retinal all-trans to 13-cis photoisomerization step of the K-intermediate and sets the stage for the primary proton transfer event from the positively charged Schiff base to the negatively charged Asp-85. Here we report the structural changes in bacteriorhodopsin following red light illumination at 150 K. Single crystal microspectrophotometry showed that only the L-intermediate is populated in three-dimensional crystals under these conditions. The experimental difference Fourier electron density map and refined crystallographic structure were consistent with those previously presented (Royant, A., Edman, K., Ursby, T., Pebay-Peyroula, E., Landau, E.

Based on the refined crystallographic structures, molecular dynamic simulations were used to examine the influence of the conformational change of the protein that is associated with the K-to-L transition on retinal dynamics.

Based on the refined crystallographic structures, molecular dynamic simulations were used to examine the influence of the conformational change of the protein that is associated with the K-to-L transition on retinal dynamics. Implications regarding the structural mechanism for proton pumping by bacteriorhodopsin are discussed. Light-driven vectorial proton translocation is basic to the mechanism of energy transduction by photosynthetic systems. Bacteriorhodopsin (bR) 1The abbreviations used are: bR, bacteriorhodopsin; LT, low temperature; EC, extracellular; CCD, charge-coupled device; Wat, water; σ, root mean square electron density of the map. is the simplest known light-driven proton pump and has long served as a model system for understanding how protons may be transported “up hill” against a transmembrane proton motive potential. bR contains seven transmembrane α-helices that surround a proton translocation channel lined with strategically placed charged residues (3.Henderson R. Baldwin J.M. Ceska T.A. Zemlin F. Beckmann E. Downing K.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 899-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (2439) Google Scholar). Depending upon their protonation states, which change in a well orchestrated cascade as a proton is transported across the cell membrane, these charged residues can serve as either proton donors or proton acceptors. Light activation of the chromophore, an all-trans-retinal molecule covalently attached to Lys-216 in helix G via a protonated Schiff base (the primary proton donor) results in the 13-cis-retinal configuration with two-thirds quantum efficiency. Steric conflicts and mechanical stress resulting from photoisomerization initiate a sequence of conformational changes that can be characterized spectroscopically and that perturb the local environment of several key residues, strongly affecting their pKa values and creating transient pathways for proton transfer. The specific spectral intermediates of the bR photocycle have been well characterized, and a common reaction scheme is: bR570 → K590 ↔ L550 ↔ M412 ↔ N560 ↔ O640 → bR570 (sub-scripts denote the wavelengths of the respective absorption maxima). M412 is usually associated with two distinct intermediates (4.Varo G. Lanyi J.K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5008-5015Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), commonly referred to as the early and late M-states, whose spectrally silent transition correlates with a conformational change on the cytoplasmic half of the protein. In general, at low temperatures the thermal motions that aid the crossing of energy barriers associated with specific transitions can be reduced or even frozen out, and light activation of three-dimensional crystals can populate specific photocycle intermediates (5.Schlichting I.

In that study three-dimensional crystals of bR were illuminated for 30 s with green light, thereby populating primarily K170K, followed by a further 40-s relaxation in the dark (1.Royant A. Edman K. Ursby T. Pebay-Peyroula E. Landau E.M. Neutze R. Nature. 2000; 406: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) in which L170K evolved. Subsequently the crystals were quenched in liquid nitrogen. As stated in that study, this trapping protocol produced predominantly the L-intermediate, although the existence of other species was detected and acknowledged (1.Royant A. Edman K. Ursby T. Pebay-Peyroula E. Landau E.M. Neutze R. Nature. 2000; 406: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and was later quantified as a mixture of K170K, L170K, and M170K in the ratio 1:3:1 (2.Royant A. Edman K. Ursby T. Pebay-Peyroula E. Landau E.M. Neutze R. Photochem. Photobiol. 2001; 74: 794-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Due to the mixture of spectral species the interpretation of our earlier structural result has been controversial (30.Balashov S.P. Ebrey T.G. Photochem. Photobiol. 2001; 73: 453-462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Lanyi J.K. J. Phys. Chem. 2000; B104: 11441-11448Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 32.Lanyi J.K. Luecke H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). As such it is valuable to repeat the intermediate trapping experiment under conditions that produce pure L-intermediate in three-dimensional bR crystals. In this work we present spectral and structural results following red light illumination of three dimensional bR crystals cooled to 150 K. The spectral analysis, difference Fourier map, and refined crystallographic structure demonstrate that the light-induced structural changes previously reported (1.Royant A. Edman K. Ursby T. Pebay-Peyroula E. Landau E.M. Neutze R. Nature. 2000; 406: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) were correctly interpreted as characterizing the build up of LLT. It follows that the mechanistic model of vectorial proton transport by bR should incorporate the fact that significant rearrangements of water molecules on the EC half of the protein, a reorientation of the guanidinium group of Arg-82 toward the EC medium, and a local flex of helix C toward the proton translocation channel centered near Asp-85 all occur after retinal photoisomerization yet prior to the primary proton transfer event from the Schiff base to Asp-85. Building upon the refined structural models, molecular dynamic simulations are presented that illustrate how the geometry of the retinal is perturbed by the conformational change in the protein associated with the K-to-L transition, providing structural insight into how the L-intermediate sets the stage for the primary proton transfer from the Schiff base to Asp-85 in the L-to-M transition. Protein Crystallization—bR was crystallized using a lipidic cubic phase matrix as described previously (33.Landau E.M. Rosenbusch J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14532-14535Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). These crystals grow as hexagonal plates typically 70 μm across and less than 10 μm thick. Crystals were harvested from the viscous lipidic environment by a lipase treatment (34.Nollert P. Landau E.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1998; 26: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For both microspectrophotometry and x-ray diffraction studies, crystals were light adapted (35.Balashov S.P. Imasheva E.S. Govindjee R. Ebrey T.G. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 473-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at room temperature by several minutes of exposure to bright white light immediately prior to being mounted on cryoloops and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Single Crystal Microspectrophotometry—Single crystal microspectrophotometry (36.Hadfield A. Hajdu J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 839-842Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 37.Bourgeois D.

Crystallogr. 2002; 35: 319-326Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar) was used to characterize both the ground state (Fig. 1a) and spectral intermediate (Fig. 1b) trapped within three-dimensional crystals of bR. An Oxford Cryosystems nitrogen gas stream held the crystal at a constant temperature of 150 K. The reaction was initiated using a 20-milliwatt, 635 nm laser diode coupled to a 225-μm-diameter optical fiber, which guided light to within ∼300 μm of the crystal position incident at an angle ∼30° relative to that of the crystal plate. The optical fiber was decoupled relative to the red laser, and the light flux was measured using a Newport 818-UV photometer with the same red light intensity being used for both x-ray diffraction and microspectrophotometry experiments (estimated to be of the order of 5 watts/cm2 at the crystal position). The ground state spectrum (Fig. 1a) and the difference spectrum between that recorded during red light illumination and the ground state spectrum (Fig. 1b, discontinuous line) were recorded using a continuous wave halogen lamp with a probe spot diameter of ∼15 μm. The difference spectrum between the spectrum recorded following 30-s illumination and 40-s delay in the dark and the ground state spectrum (Fig. 1b, continuous line) was recorded using a 10-μs Xenon flash lamp. An Ocean Optics SD-2000 CCD spectrophotometer was used to record spectra enabling a broader wavelength domain to be sampled with significantly higher sensitivity than in previous work (2.Royant A. Edman K. Ursby T. Pebay-Peyroula E. Landau E.M. Neutze R. Photochem. Photobiol. 2001; 74: 794-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). X-ray Data Collection—Light-adapted (35.Balashov S.P. Imasheva E.S. Govindjee R. Ebrey T.G. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 473-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) frozen bR crystals were illuminated at 150 K with red light (λ = 635 nm) for 30 s followed by a further 40-s delay in the dark and were then quenched in liquid nitrogen. Approximately 20 min following off-line trapping, crystals were mounted on the x-ray goniometer of beamline ID14-EH2 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. A first (coarse) alignment of the crystal on the goniometer head was made using red light, and the final adjustment (a few seconds) was made using dim white light. An x-ray wavelength of 0.93 Å was used for data collection with an ADSC Quantum4 CCD detector. 120 frames of 1°/frame were collected with 30-s x-ray exposure/frame. Data were processed using the HKL package (38.Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L. Isaacs N.W. Bailey S. Data Collection and Processing. DL/SCI/R34. Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1993: 55-62Google Scholar) and the CCP4 suite (39.Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Crystallographic data were detwinned according to the formula (41.Royant A. Grizot S. Kahn R. Belrhali H. Fieschi F. Landau E.M. Pebay-Peyroula E. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 784-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), Idetwin(h1)=[(1-x)Iobs(h1)-xIobs(h2)]/(1-2x)(Eq. 1) Idetwin(h2)=-[xIobs(h1)-(1-x)Iobs(h2)]/(1-2x)(Eq. 2) prior to further crystallographic analysis where Idetwin is the intensity corresponding to diffraction from an untwinned crystal, Iobs is the (twinned) measured intensity, the two reflections h1 and h2 are related by the twin operation but not by crystallographic symmetry, and x is the degree of merohedral twinning. When following this procedure the detwinned data is independent of any structural model, and the number of independent observations is not reduced, but the errors associated with detwinning increase with increasing twinning, approaching infinity as x approaches 0.5 (41.Royant A.

Consequently when following this protocol the refined crystallographic R-factors are typically somewhat larger than might be expected. For perfectly twinned (or almost perfectly twinned) crystallographic data (from which several intermediate structures of bR have been reported (12.Facciotti M.T. Rouhani S. Burkard F.T.

Rather when calculating electron density maps the “detwinned” observations are recovered according to the formula (42.Redinbo M.R. Yeates T.O. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1993; 49: 375-380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Idetwin(h1)=[Iobs(h1)+Icalc(h1)-Icalc(h2)]/2(Eq. 3) Idetwin(h2)=[Iobs(h1)+Icalc(h2)-Icalc(h1)]/2(Eq. 4) or variations thereof, which depend explicitly upon intensities calculated from the structural model, Icalc(h) (the convention is that Idetwin and Icalc correspond to diffraction from only half of the crystal). In this case each observation Iobs(h1) and its associated twin Iobs(h2) cannot be measured independently (i.e. Iobs(h1) = Iobs(h2)), and the number of independent observations at any given resolution is reduced almost exactly by a half relative to data with low levels of twinning. Consequently refined crystallographic R-factors from perfectly twinned data are typically a factor of 1/√2 lower than for low (or un-)twinned data (40.Yeates T.O. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 344-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 41.Royant A. Grizot S. Kahn R. Belrhali H. Fieschi F. Landau E.M. Pebay-Peyroula E. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Crystallogr. 1993; 49: 375-380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the explicit dependence of the detwinned data on the model itself (Equations 3 and 4) introduces additional model bias in electron density maps. Our work on the ground state (43.Belrhali H. Nollert P. Royant A. Menzel C. Rosenbusch J.P. Landau E.M. Pebay-Peyroula E. Struct. Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 909-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (409) Google Scholar) and KLT-state (10.Edman K. Nollert P. Royant A. Belrhali H. Pebay-Peyroula E. Hajdu J. Neutze R. Landau E.M. Nature. 1999; 401: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) of bR was free from merohedral twinning, and our previous work on LLT (x = 0.26 (1.Royant A. Edman K. Ursby T. Pebay-Peyroula E. Landau E.M. Neutze R. Nature. 2000; 406: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar)) as well as that presented here (x = 0.27) had sufficiently low levels of twinning such that data were detwinned according to Equations 1 and 2 prior to further structural analysis. Difference Fourier Analysis—Detwinned crystallographic data were scaled together with the ground state observations (Protein Data Bank entry 1QHJ) using the CCP4 suite (39.Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The difference Fourier electron density map was calculated by Fourier transform of (Fexc-Fgnd)·exp(i·Φgnd) using the refined ground state model (Protein Data Bank entry 1QHJ) for phases (43.Belrhali H. Nollert P. Royant A. Menzel C. Rosenbusch J.P. Landau E.M. Pebay-Peyroula E. Struct. Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 909-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The structural changes described here were interpreted directly from the difference electron density map and were confirmed by partial occupancy refinement. Structural Refinement—Partial occupancy refinement was performed, using CNS (44.Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16709) Google Scholar), by refining one excited state conformation (labeled LLT or L150K, which was allowed to change conformation), while the ground state model (with complementary occupancy) was held fixed. After the models were aligned as rigid bodies, a simulated annealing refinement of LLT was performed to escape bias toward the initial model. The crystallographic occupancy was determined by first selecting 10 evenly spaced (from 0 to 100%) values for the crystallographic occupancy, refining the structure of LLT with this occupancy held fixed, and then refining the occupancy with the model for LLT held fixed. The crystallographic occupancy converged from above and from below to a value of 50% (see Ref. 2.Royant A. Edman K. Ursby T. Pebay-Peyroula E. Landau E.M. Neutze R. Photochem. Photobiol. 2001; 74: 794-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar for details of the method). As with previous work (1.Royant A. Edman K. Ursby T. Pebay-Peyroula E. Landau E.M. Neutze R.

Molecular Dynamic Simulations—Molecular dynamic simulations were used to investigate the influence of the K-to-L structural transition on retinal dynamics. Crystallographically resolved water molecules and additional water molecules predicted using Dowser (104.Zhang L. Hermans J. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1996; 24: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) were included in these simulations. Dowser assigns non-crystallographic water molecules by constructing a molecular surface from the input structure file and finding positions where a solvent probe (with a default radius of 0.2 Å) touches three atoms simultaneously. Energies were computed for buried waters, and those with a stabilization energy of at least -2 kcal/mol were included in the model. Lipid molecules were removed from the model, which was instead inserted into a slab of low temperature argon atoms (45.Aqvist J. Luzhkov V. Nature. 2000; 404: 881-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) with enhanced Lennard Jones repulsions between argon and water (σ = 0.36 nm and ϵ = 0.85 kJ/mol) so as to mimic the hydrophobic membrane environment. Simulations of the intact membrane bilayer have been reported (46.Baudry J. Tajkhorshid E. Molnar R. Phillips J. Schulten K. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2001; 105: 905-918Crossref Google Scholar) but were not considered essential for this work. Time-dependent protein dynamic simulations of 500-ps duration were performed using the chemical simulation software package GROMACS (47.Lindahl E. Hess B. van der Spoel D. J. Mol. Model. 2001; 7: 306-317Crossref Google Scholar) with a time step of 1 fs. The Gromos-96 force field was used throughout (48.van Gunsteren W.F. Billeter S.R. Eising A.A. Hunenberger P.H. Kruger P.

Tajkhorshid, personal communication. and torsional displacements from planarity were subject to a harmonic energy penalty of ∼320 kJ·mol-1·radian-2. All protein Cα atoms were restrained to their crystal positions by a force constant of 100 kJ·mol·nm-1. Equilibration of this system for 20 ps resulted in models with well relaxed argon and water molecules, and the potential energy in any given simulation converged within 80 ps. The root mean square deviation of the non-hydrogen atoms of the average trajectory structures (from 100 to 300 ps) deviated from the crystallographic structures by ∼1.0 Å. Spectral Analysis—Fig. 1a shows the absorption spectrum of light-adapted bR (35.Balashov S.P. Imasheva E.S. Govindjee R. Ebrey T.G. Biophys.

In Fig. 1b, two difference spectra (illuminated state spectrum minus the ground state spectrum) recorded at 150 K are presented: one recorded with simultaneous red light illumination contains a discontinuity at 635 nm due to scatter of the red laser light from the crystal and in agreement with difference spectra presented in Ref. 15.Lanyi J.K.

The trans-interactions of nectins furthermore induce activation of Cdc42 and Rac small G proteins, but the roles of these small G proteins activated in this way remain unknown. We examined here the role and the mode of action of Cdc42 in the organization of AJs and TJs in MDCK cells.

The inhibitory effect of NWASP-CRIB-CAAX on the formation of AJs and TJs was suppressed by co-expression of nectin-1 of which trans-interaction activated endogenous Cdc42. Moreover, the formation of the claudin-based TJs required a greater amount of activated Cdc42 than that of the E-cadherin-based AJs.

Cell-cell adhesion is an essential feature of epithelia that ensures their polarized status and therefore their differentiation and physiological functions. In polarized epithelial cells, cell-cell adhesion is mediated through a junctional complex composed of tight junctions (TJs), 1The abbreviations used are: TJstight junctionsAJsadherens junctionsCRIB domainCdc42 and Rac interactive binding domainDSsdesmosomesGFPgreen fluorescent proteinEGFPenhanced GFPF-actinactin filamentsmAbmonoclonal antibodyMDCK cellsMadin-Darby canine kidney cellspAbpolyclonal antibodyPIphosphatidylinositolDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumPBSphosphate-buffered salineFCSfetal calf serum. cell-cell adherens junctions (AJs), and desmosomes (DSs) (1Farquhar M.G. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 375-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar). These junctional structures are typically aligned from the apical to the basal side, although DSs are independently distributed in other areas (1Farquhar M.G. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 375-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar). The formation and maintenance of TJs and DSs are totally dependent on the formation and maintenance of AJs (2Tsukita S. Furuse M. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 268-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). At AJs, E-cadherin is a key Ca2+-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecule (3Gumbiner B. Stevenson B. Grimaldi A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1575-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 4Takeichi M. Development. 1988; 102: 639-655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E-cadherin forms cis-dimers and then trans-dimers (trans-interactions) through the extracellular region, causing cell-cell adhesion. The cytoplasmic tail of E-cadherin is linked to the actin cytoskeleton through many peripheral membrane proteins, including α-catenin, β-catenin, vinculin, and α-actinin, which strengthen the cell-cell adhesion activity of E-cadherin (5Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). At TJs, claudins are key Ca2+-independent cell-cell adhesion molecules that form TJ strands (2Tsukita S. Furuse M.

Nectins are Ca2+-independent Ig-like cell-cell adhesion molecules at AJs in epithelial cells and fibroblasts (6Takai Y. Nakanishi H. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Nectins compose a family of four members, nectin-1, -2, -3, and -4. All nectins form homo-cis-dimers and then homo-trans-dimers (trans-interactions), causing cell-cell adhesion. Nectin-3 furthermore forms hetero-trans-dimers with nectin-1 and -2. Nectin-4 also forms hetero-trans-dimers with nectin-1. Nectins are associated with the actin cytoskeleton through afadin, a nectinand F-actin-binding protein. Nectins play roles in the organization of AJs and TJs in cooperation with E-cadherin and claudins in epithelial cells. Kinetically, nectins increase the velocities of the formation of AJs and TJs (7Honda T. Shimizu K. Kawakatsu T. Yasumi M. Shingai T. Fukuhara A. Ozaki-Kuroda K. Irie K. Nakanishi H. Takai Y.

The Rho family small G proteins, Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, have all been reported to affect the formation and/or maintenance of AJs (9Braga V.M. Curr. Opin.

Cell. 1999; 10: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), although expression of a constitutively active mutant of Rho (V14Rho) does not affect the formation of the E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell AJs (14Takaishi K. Sasaki T. Kotani H. Nishioka H. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Rac activity is necessary for the establishment of AJs in epithelial cells (12Braga V.M. Machesky L.M. Hall A. Hotchin N.A. J.

The activation of Rac leads to a dramatic reorganization of intercellular contacts in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Tight contact is restricted to the apical area of the lateral plasma membrane in wild-type MDCK cells, whereas tight contact extends over the entire lateral plasma membrane in MDCK cells expressing a constitutively active mutant of Rac1 (V12Rac1) (14Takaishi K.

Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In addition, the lateral plasma membrane displays extensive interdigitation in MDCK cells expressing V12Rac1. In MDCK cells expressing a constitutively active mutant of Cdc42 (V12Cdc42), tight contact extends over the entire lateral plasma membrane, but the interdigitation of the lateral plasma membrane is much less pronounced than that in MDCK cells expressing V12Rac1 (17Kodama A. Takaishi K. Nakano K. Nishioka H. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3996-4006Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Cdc42 is required for membrane protein traffic and the gate and fence function at TJs in MDCK cells (18Kroschewski R. Hall A. Mellman I. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 19Rojas R. Ruiz W.G. Leung S.M. Jou T.S. Apodaca G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2257-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, it remains unknown whether the activation of Cdc42 is necessary for the formation of AJs. Recent studies have demonstrated that the trans-interaction of E-cadherin induces activation of Rac, but not that of Cdc42, in several cell lines including epithelial cells and fibroblasts (20Nakagawa M.

It has been shown that Cdc42 is activated upon formation of cell-cell adhesion in MDCK cells (21Noren N.K. Niessen C.M. Gumbiner B.M. Burridge K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33305-33308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), but it remains unknown how Cdc42 is activated (25Yap A.S. Kovacs E.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that the trans-interactions of nectins induce not only activation of Rac but also that of Cdc42, resulting in formation of lamellipodia and filopodia, in fibroblasts and MDCK cells (26Kawakatsu T.

Fukuhara A. Irie K. Nakamura T. Matsuda M. Takai Y. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the role and the mode of action of the Cdc42 activated by the trans-interactions of nectins in the formation of AJs and TJs in MDCK cells. For this purpose, we first made NWASP-Cdc42 and Rac interactive binding (CRIB) domain, an inhibitor of activated Cdc42, fused to the Ki-Ras CAAX motif (NWASP-CRIB-CAAX; where A is aliphatic amino acid), which was preferentially targeted to the cell-cell adhesion sites in MDCK cells, because the overexpressed NWASP-CRIB protein mostly localized in nuclei and might not inhibit effectively the action of the Cdc42 activated by the trans-interactions of nectins at the cell-cell adhesion sites in MDCK cells. By overexpressing various combinations of NWASP-CRIBCAAX, V12Cdc42, and nectin-1 in MDCK cells, we show here that the Cdc42 activated by the trans-interactions of nectins is involved in the organization of AJs and TJs in different mechanisms in MDCK cells. Expression Plasmids—Expression vectors for enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged NWASP-Cdc42 and Rac interactive binding (CRIB) domain (pEGFP-NWASP-CRIB) and Myc-tagged V12Cdc42 (pEFBOS-myc-V12Cdc42) were prepared as described (17Kodama A.

Subcellular Fractionation—Subcellular fractionation was performed as described previously (31Yamamoto Y. Mandai K. Okabe N. Hoshino T. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2545-2554Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, MDCK cells (6 × 106 cells/10-cm dish) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) on four 10-cm dishes at 37 °C for 24 h. After the culture, the cells (2.4 × 107 cells) were transfected with 28 μg of pEGFP, pEGFP-CAAX, pEGFP NWASP-CRIB, pEGFP-NWASP-CRIB-CAAX, or pEGFP-NWASPCRIB[H208D]-CAAX using LipofectAMINE 2000 Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. After a 48-h culture, the cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) three times, scraped with a rubber policeman, harvested in 4 ml of ice-cold PBS, and collected by centrifugation at 800 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. The cells were suspended in 2 ml of ice-cold Buffer A (10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 25 mm NaHCO3) and homogenized with 10 strokes in a cell cracker. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected as the post-nuclear fraction. The pellet was suspended in 2 ml of Buffer A and kept as the nuclear fraction. The supernatant (0.45 ml) was applied on a 4.2-ml continuous sucrose density gradient (10–40%) with 0.3 ml of 50% sucrose cushion, followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h. After the centrifugation, fractions of 0.3 ml each were collected. Each fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting using indicated Abs. A Cell-Cell Adhesion Assay—Cell-cell adhesion of wild-type MDCK, nectin-1-MDCK, and V12Cdc42-MDCK cells were assayed as described (14Takaishi K. Sasaki T. Kotani H. Nishioka H. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 27Honda T. Shimizu K. Kawakatsu T. Fukuhara A. Irie K. Nakamura T. Matsuda M. Takai Y. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, the cells (5 × 105 cells/35-mm dish) were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FCS at 37 °C for 24 h and then transfected with 4 μg of pEGFP, pEGFP-CAAX, pEGFP-NWASP-CRIB, pEGFP-NWASP-CRIB-CAAX, or pEGFP-NWASP-CRIB[H208D]CAAX using LipofectAMINE 2000 Reagent (Invitrogen Corp.). After a 24-h culture, the cells were washed with 5 ml of PBS and incubated in DMEM (at a final concentration of 2 mm Ca2+) at 37 °C for 1 h. The medium was replaced with DMEM containing 5 mm EGTA (at a final concentration of 2 μm Ca2+), and then the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. After the incubation, the cells were washed with DMEM and further incubated in DMEM (at a final concentration of 2 mm Ca2+) at 37 °C for 2 h. The cells were then fixed, followed by immunostaining with indicated Abs. Microinjection—Microinjection was performed as described (14Takaishi K. Sasaki T. Kotani H. Nishioka H. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Wild-type MDCK and nectin-1-MDCK cells (1.0 × 105 cells/well) were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FCS on a coverslip in a 24-well dish at 37 °C for 24 h, and then the cells were serum-starved for 24 h. After the serum starvation, the cells were microinjected with a mixture of indicated plasmids. The microinjected cells were incubated in DMEM at 37 °C for 30 min and then incubated in DMEM containing 5 mm EGTA (at a final concentration of 2 μm Ca2+) at 37 °C for 30 min. Thereafter, the cells were incubated in DMEM (at a final concentration of 2 mm Ca2+) at 37 °C for 2 h. The cells were then fixed, followed by immunostaining using indicated Abs. Other Procedures—SDS-PAGE was done as described (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207522) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined with bovine serum albumin as a reference protein (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217507) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence microscopy of cultured cells was done with a confocal imaging system (Radian 2000, Bio-Rad) as described (29Takahashi K. Nakanishi H. Miyahara M. Mandai K. Satoh K. Satoh A. Nishioka H. Aoki J. Nomoto A. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 34Mandai K. Nakanishi H. Satoh A. Obaishi H. Wada M. Nishioka H.

Reduction of the Velocities of the Formation of AJs and TJs by NWASP-CRIB-CAAX—To inhibit the action of the Cdc42 activated by the trans-interactions of nectins at the cell-cell junctions, we first expressed EGFP-NWASP-CRIB, a specific inhibitor of activated Cdc42 (35Takenawa T. Miki H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1801-1809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in MDCK cells. The CRIB domain of NWASP specifically binds to activated Cdc42 and inhibits the action of activated Cdc42 (35Takenawa T. Miki H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1801-1809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the signal for EGFP-NWASP-CRIB appeared in nuclei, and the signal was hardly observed at the cell-cell adhesion sites (Fig. 1A). The signal for EGFP alone was diffusely observed in the cytosol (Fig. 1A). If NWASP-CRIB is preferentially targeted to the cell-cell adhesion sites, the NWASP-CRIB would effectively inhibit the action of activated Cdc42 there. Thus, we prepared a plasmid for EGFP-NWASP-CRIB fused to the Ki-Ras CAAX motif with the polybasic sequence (pEGFP-NWASP-CRIBCAAX). The CAAX motif is required for targeting of Ki-Ras to the plasma membrane (36Magee T. Marshall C. Cell. 1999; 98: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). When EGFP-NWASP-CRIB-CAAX was expressed in MDCK cells, the signal for EGFP-NWASP-CRIB-CAAX was markedly observed at the cell-cell adhesion sites (Fig. 1A). The signal for EGFP fused to the Ki-Ras CAAX motif with the polybasic sequence (EGFP-CAAX) was also observed at the cell-cell adhesion sites (Fig. 1A). To confirm that EGFP-NWASP-CRIB-CAAX is targeted to the cell-cell adhesion sites where E-cadherin localizes, we performed the subcellular fractionation of MDCK cells expressing EGFP-NWASP-CRIB-CAAX. First, we examined the expression levels of the EGFP-NWASP-CRIB, EGFP-NWASP-CRIBCAAX, EGFP, and EGFP-CAAX proteins by Western blotting using the anti-GFP pAb. MDCK cells transiently expressing either EGFP-NWASP-CRIB-CAAX, EGFP-NWASP-CRIB, EGFP-CAAX, or EGFP were homogenized and kept as the homogenate. The expression levels of these proteins were approximately equal in the homogenate (Fig. 1B, lane H). The homogenate was fractionated into the nuclear fraction and the post-nuclear fraction by centrifugation. Most of EGFPNWASP-CRIB-CAAX, EGFP-CAAX, and EGFP were detected in the post-nuclear fraction, whereas most of EGFP-NWASP-CRIB was detected in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 1B, lanes N and P). To examine the more detailed subcellular distribution of EGFP-NWASP-CRIB-CAAX, the post-nuclear fraction was subjected to sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. After the centrifugation, each fraction was collected from the bottom (fraction 1) to the top (fraction 15) in the tube, followed by Western blotting of each fraction. EGFP-NWASP-CRIB-CAAX was indeed detected in the plasma membrane fraction where E-cadherin was detected (Fig. 2A, fractions 1–4). EGFPNWASP-CRIB-CAAX was also detected in the intracellular vesicular organelle fraction (Fig. 2A, fractions 5–14) where Rab7 and EEA1, the markers for late and early endosomes (37Leung S.M. Ruiz W.G. Apodaca G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2113-2150Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar), respectively, were detected, and in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 2A, fractions 14 and 15) where α-tubulin, the marker for cytoplasm, was detected. In contrast, EGFP-NWASP-CRIB was hardly detected in the plasma membrane fraction (Fig. 2B, fractions 1–4). EGFP-CAAX was detected in the plasma membrane fraction, whereas EGFP was hardly detected in the plasma membrane fraction (data not shown). It is not known why there are two differently migrating bands of EGFPNWASP-CRIB-CAAX and EGFP-NWASP-CRIB, but it may be due to the degradation or unprocessed forms. These results indicate that the addition of the Ki-Ras CAAX motif with the polybasic sequence to NWASP-CRIB enhances targeting of NWASP-CRIB to the plasma membrane. By use of NWASP-CRIB-CAAX, we then examined a role(s) of activated Cdc42 in the formation of cell-cell adhesion. If activated Cdc42 is involved in proper formation of AJs and/or TJs, overexpression of NWASP-CRIB-CAAX in wild-type MDCK cells would affect the accumulation of nectins, afadin, E-cadherin, or claudin-1 during the formation of cell-cell adhesion. Wild-type MDCK cells were transfected with a plasmid for EGFP-NWASP-CRIB-CAAX or EGFP-CAAX and cultured at 2 mm Ca2+ for 24 h. After the culture, the cells were incubated at 2 μm Ca2+ for 2 h and then incubated at 2 mm Ca2+ for 2 h. E-cadherin and claudin-1 were immunostained. Afadin was also immunostained instead of nectins, because nectin-1 and -2 are expressed in wild-type MDCK cells as estimated by Western blotting, but neither of them is immunostained by currently available antibodies (30Sakisaka T. Nakanishi H. Takahashi K. Mandai K. Miyahara M. Satoh A. Takaishi K. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1609-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 38Fukuhara A. Irie K. Nakanishi H. Takekuni K. Kawakatsu T. Ikeda W. Yamada A. Katata T. Honda T. Sato T. Shimizu K. Ozaki H. Horiuchi H. Kita T. Takai Y. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7649-7655Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The signals for afadin, E-cadherin, and claudin-1 were concentrated at the cell-cell adhesion sites in wild-type MDCK cells after the 24-h culture at 2 mm Ca2+ as described (8Honda T. Shimizu K. Fukuhara A. Irie K. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 306: 104-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) (data not shown). The signal for E-cadherin or claudin-1 was not observed at any site along the plasma membrane in wild-type MDCK cells after the 2-h incubation at 2 μm Ca2+ as described (8Honda T. Shimizu K. Fukuhara A. Irie K. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 306: 104-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) (data not shown), whereas the signal for afadin was diffusely observed along the entire surface of the plasma membrane as described (38Fukuhara A. Irie K. Nakanishi H. Takekuni K. Kawakatsu T. Ikeda W. Yamada A. Katata T. Honda T. Sato T. Shimizu K. Ozaki H. Horiuchi H. Kita T. Takai Y. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7649-7655Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar) (data not shown). The signals for afadin, E-cadherin, and claudin-1 were re-concentrated at the cell-cell adhesion sites between the wild-type MDCK cells expressing EGFP-CAAX after the 2-h incubation at 2 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 3, A–D). On the other hand, the signals for afadin, E-cadherin, and claudin-1 were reduced at the cell-cell adhesion sites between the wild-type MDCK cells expressing EGFP-NWASP-CRIB-CAAX (Fig. 3, A–D). These results indicate that NWASP-CRIB-CAAX inhibits the accumulation of afadin, E-cadherin, and claudin-1 at the newly formed cell-cell adhesion sites, resulting in a reduction of the velocities of the formation of AJs and TJs in wild-type MDCK cells. We confirmed that the inhibitory effect of NWASP-CRIBCAAX is due to its specific interaction with activated Cdc42. For this purpose, we prepared a mutant [H208D] in which a histidine residue conserved in all CRIB motifs is replaced by an aspartate residue. This mutant does not bind activated Cdc42 (28Miki H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Takenawa T. Nature. 1998; 391: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). When EGFP-NWASP-CRIB[H208D]-CAAX was expressed in wild-type MDCK cells, its distribution and expression patterns were the same as those of EGFP-NWASP-CRIBCAAX (Fig. 1, A and B, and data not shown). We then transfected wild-type MDCK cells with a plasmid for EGFPNWASP-CRIB[H208D]-CAAX and cultured them at 2 mm Ca2+ for 24 h. After the culture, the cells were incubated at 2 μm Ca2+ for 2 h and then incubated at 2 mm Ca2+ for 2 h. The signals for afadin, E-cadherin, and claudin-1 were re-concentrated at the cell-cell adhesion sites between the wild-type MDCK cells expressing EGFP-NWASP-CRIB[H208D]-CAAX after the 2-h incubation at 2 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 3, A–D). These results indicate that the inhibitory effect of NWASP-CRIBCAAX is due to its specific interaction with activated Cdc42. Increase of the Velocities of the Formation of AJs and TJs by V12Cdc42—The result that inhibition of the action of activated Cdc42 reduces the velocities of the formation of AJs and TJs suggests that overexpression of V12Cdc42 conversely increases their velocities. To test this possibility, V12Cdc42-MDCK cells (MDCK cells stably overexpressing V12Cdc42) and wild-type MDCK cells were incubated at 2 μm Ca2+ for 2 h and then incubated at 2 mm Ca2+ for 2 h. The signals for afadin, E-cadherin, and claudin-1 were re-concentrated at the cell-cell adhesion sites in a time-dependent manner after both the cells were incubated at 2 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 4, A–D), but the time courses of the accumulation of afadin, E-cadherin, and claudin-1 at the cell-cell adhesion sites in V12Cdc42-MDCK cells were much faster than those in wild-type MDCK cells. These results indicate that overexpression of V12Cdc42 increases the velocities of the formation of the E-cadherin-based AJs and the claudin-based TJs in epithelial cells. Suppression of the Inhibitory Effect of NWASP-CRIB-CAAX by V12Cdc42—We next examined whether the inhibitory effect of NWASP-CRIB-CAAX is suppressed by co-expression with V12Cdc42. A plasmid for Myc-tagged V12Cdc42 was co-micro-injected with a plasmid for EGFP-NWASP-CRIB-CAAX into wild-type MDCK cells. After a 30-min incubation at 2 mm Ca2+, the cells were incubated at 2 μm Ca2+ for 30 min and then incubated at 2 mm Ca2+ for 2 h. The signals for afadin, E-cadherin, and claudin-1 were re-concentrated at the cell-cell adhesion sites between the wild-type MDCK cells expressing both EGFP-NWASP-CRIB-CAAX and Myc-tagged V12Cdc42 after the 2-h incubation at 2 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 5, A–D). In contrast, the signals for afadin, E-cadherin, and claudin-1 were reduced at the cell-cell adhesion sites between the wild-type MDCK cells expressing only EGFP-NWASP-CRIB-CAAX (Fig. 5, A–D), consistent with the results in Fig. 3. These results indicate that the inhibitory effect of NWASP-CRIB-CAAX is mediated through the inhibition of the action of activated Cdc42. Suppression of the Inhibitory Effect of NWASP-CRIB-CAAX by Nectin-1—We then examined whether the inhibitory effect of NWASP-CRIB-CAAX is suppressed by the trans-interactions of nectins which induce activation of Cdc42. To test this possibility, we used nectin-1-MDCK cells (MDCK cells stably overexpressing exogenous nectin-1). Nectin-1-MDCK cells were transfected with a plasmid for EGFP-NWASP-CRIB-CAAX or EGFP-CAAX and cultured for 24 h. After the culture, the cells were incubated at 2 μm Ca2+ for 2 h and then incubated at 2 mm Ca2+ for 2 h. The signals for afadin and E-cadherin, but not that for claudin-1, were re-concentrated at the cell-cell adhesion sites between the nectin-1-MDCK cells expressing EGFP-NWASP-CRIB-CAAX (Fig. 6, A–D). These results indicate that the trans-interaction of nectin-1 suppresses the inhibitory effect of NWASP-CRIB-CAAX on the accumulation of afadin and E-cadherin, but not that of claudin-1, at the newly formed cell-cell adhesion sites. Different Sensitivities of the Formation of AJs and TJs to Activated Cdc42—The result that the trans-interaction of nectin-1 suppresses the inhibitory effect of NWASP-CRIB-CAAX on the accumulation of afadin and E-cadherin, but not that of claudin-1, led us to questions of whether the formation of TJs requires a greater amount of activated Cdc42 than that of AJs and of whether the amount of the Cdc42 activated by the trans-interaction of nectin-1 is not enough to suppress the inhibitory effect of NWASP-CRIB-CAAX. We microinjected various doses of a plasmid for EGFP-NWASP-CRIB-CAAX from 0.01 to 0.1 mg/ml into nectin-1-MDCK and wild-type MDCK cells. After a 30-min incubation at 2 mm Ca2+, the cells were incubated at 2 μm Ca2+ for 30 min and then incubated at 2 mm Ca2+ for 2 h. The microinjection with a lower concentration (0.01 mg/ml) of the plasmid resulted in accumulation of the signal for claudin-1 at the cell-cell adhesion sites between the nectin-1-MDCK cells expressing EGFP-NWASP-CRIB-CAAX after the 2-h incubation at 2 mm Ca2+, but resulted in a reduction of that between the wild-type MDCK cells expressing EGFP-NWASP-CRIB-CAAX (Fig. 7). In contrast, the microinjection with a higher concentration (0.1 mg/ml) of the plasmid resulted in a reduction of the signal for claudin-1 at the cell-cell adhesion sites between the nectin-1-MDCK cells expressing EGFP-NWASP-CRIB-CAAX and between the wild-type MDCK cells expressing EGFP-NWASP-CRIB-CAAX. These results indicate that the trans-interaction of nectin-1 indeed suppresses the inhibitory effect of NWASP-CRIB-CAAX on the formation of the claudin-1-based TJs and that the formation of TJs and AJs has different sensitivities to activated Cdc42. Formation of Filopodia by V12Cdc42—Activated Cdc42 is well known to induce formation of filopodia in fibroblasts (39Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5229) Google Scholar). The trans-interactions of nectins increase the velocities of the formation of AJs and TJs (8Honda T. Shimizu K. Fukuhara A. Irie K. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 306: 104-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the Cdc42 activated by the trans-interactions of nectins induces formation of filopodia to increase the number of cell-cell contact sites in wild-type MDCK cells, resulting in an increase of the velocities of the formation of AJs and TJs. In the last experiment, we tested whether a constitutively active mutant of Cdc42 induces formation of filopodia in wild-type MDCK cells. Wild-type MDCK cells were microinjected with a plasmid for EGFP-V12Cdc42, EGFP-Cdc42 (wild type), or EGFP and incubated at 2 mm Ca2+ for 3 h. The cells expressing EGFPV12Cdc42 induced formation of filopodia, whereas the cells expressing EGFP-Cdc42 (wild type) or EGFP did not (Fig. 8 and data not shown). These results suggest that the Cdc42 activated by the trans-interactions of nectins during the formation of cell-cell adhesion induces formation of filopodia in MDCK cells, resulting in an increase of the velocities of the formation of AJs and TJs. We have shown here that inhibition of the action of activated Cdc42 by NWASP-CRIB-CAAX results in a decrease in the velocities of the formation of AJs and TJs in MDCK cells. Conversely, a constitutively active mutant of Cdc42 increases their velocities. The inhibitory effect of NWASP-CRIB-CAAX on the formation of AJs and TJs is suppressed by the trans-interactions of nectins. We have demonstrated previously (7Honda T. Shimizu K. Kawakatsu T.

Taken together, it is likely that the Cdc42 activated by the trans-interactions of nectins increases the velocities of the formation of AJs and TJs in MDCK cells. We have proposed that at the initial stage of the formation of AJs, cell-cell contact sites are formed mainly by the trans-interactions of nectins, because nectins kinetically form microclusters more rapidly than E-cadherin (6Takai Y. Nakanishi H. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 7Honda T. Shimizu K. Kawakatsu T. Yasumi M. Shingai T. Fukuhara A. Ozaki-Kuroda K. Irie K. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We have shown here that V12Cdc42, a constitutively active mutant of Cdc42, induces formation of filopodia in MDCK cells. Thus, the Cdc42 activated by the trans-interactions of nectins is likely to increase the number of filopodia at the cell-cell contact sites at the initial stage of the formation of AJs, resulting in an increase of the number of cell-cell contact sites like “fork initiation” described for DNA replication (40Georgopoulos C. Trends Genet. 1989; 5: 319-321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the activation of Rac induces formation of lamellipodia and increases the velocity of the formation of the E-cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion, resulting in maturation of the E-cadherin-based cell-cell AJs in a phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase-independent manner (15Ehrlich J.S. Hansen M.D. Nelson W.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 259-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The trans-interaction of E-cadherin induces activation of Rac (20Nakagawa M.

Fukuhara A. Irie K. Nakamura T. Matsuda M. Takai Y. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Two studies (22Betson M. Lozano E. Zhang J. Braga V.M.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 20533-20539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) have shown that the activation of Rac by the trans-interaction of E-cadherin is independent of PI 3-kinase, whereas two other studies (20Nakagawa M. Fukata M. Yamaga M. Itoh N. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1829-1838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Kovacs E.M. Ali R.G. McCormack A.J. Yap A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6708-6718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) have shown that PI 3-kinase is required for the full activation of Rac by the trans-interaction of E-cadherin. On the other hand, the trans-interactions of nectins induce activation of Rac and Cdc42 in a PI 3-kinase-independent manner (27Honda T. Shimizu K. Kawakatsu T. Fukuhara A. Irie K. Nakamura T. Matsuda M. Takai Y. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that the Rac activated by the trans-interactions of nectins induces formation of lamellipodia that efficiently expands the cell-cell adhesion between the filopodia, acting like a so-called “zipper.” It remains unknown whether the E-cadherin-induced activation of Rac is involved in the formation of cell-cell adhesion. Our data support a model in which the formation of the claudin-based TJs requires a larger amount of activated Cdc42 than that of the E-cadherin-based AJs, indicating that there are different sensitivities of the formation of AJs and TJs to activated Cdc42 and that the modes of action of Cdc42 for the formation of AJs and TJs are different. Many downstream effectors have been identified for Cdc42, including IQGAP1, NWASP/WASP, and Par6 (41Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar, 42Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). IQGAP1 and NWASP/WASP are F-actin-binding proteins (35Takenawa T. Miki H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1801-1809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar). The nectin-afadin system is thought to regulate the organization of the peripheral actin cytoskeleton to facilitate the formation of AJs by the following two different ways: via F-actin-binding proteins associated with nectins, such as afadin, α-catenin, α-actinin, and vinculin; and via Cdc42 and Rac through their downstream effectors, IQGAP1, NWASP/WASP, and IRSp53/WAVE (6Takai Y. Nakanishi H. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 43Takai Y. Irie K. Shimizu K. Sakisaka T. Ikeda W. Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 655-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Par6 is a key player for the formation of TJs, and Cdc42 regulates the activity of the Par6/aPKC-containing complex in MDCK cells (42Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 44Ohno S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the Kd values of activated Cdc42 to WASP-CRIB and Par6-CRIB are 1.6 and 50 nm, respectively (45Garrard S.M. Capaldo C.T. Gao L. Rosen M.K. Macara I.G. Tomchick D.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1125-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Moreover, the formation of TJs depends on that of AJs (2Tsukita S. Furuse M. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 268-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that at the initial stage of the formation of the cell-cell adhesion, the trans-interactions of nectins produce a lower concentration of activated Cdc42 which is enough for binding to NWASP/WASP, but not to Par6, leading to the formation of AJs, but not TJs; and at the middle and/or late stages, an increasing number of the trans-interactions of nectins produce a higher concentration of activated Cdc42 which is enough for binding to Par6, leading to the formation of TJs. In this way, the Cdc42 activated by the trans-interactions of nectins may be involved in the organization of AJs and TJs. We have shown here that overexpression of V12Cdc42 induces formation of filopodia in wild-type MDCK cells. In our previous report, however, we could not observe formation of filopodia induced by overexpressed V12Cdc42 in wild-type MDCK cells (46Yasuda T. Ohtsuka T. Inoue E. Yokoyama S. Sakisaka T. Kodama A. Takaishi K. Takai Y. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The discrepancy between this study and our previous study might be due to the different assay conditions. In this study, wild-type MDCK cells were microinjected after the cells were serum-starved for 24 h, and the phenotypes of the cells were observed 3 h after the microinjection. On the other hand, in the previous study, wild-type MDCK cells were microinjected without serum starvation, and the phenotypes of the cells were observed 12 h after the microinjection. We thank Drs. M. Takeichi, S. Narumiya, T. Takenawa, and W. Birchmeier for generous gifts of reagents."

AP-2 is involved in the formation of clathrin coats at the plasma membrane and links receptor internalization to clathrin assembly. This complex consists of large subunits, α- and β2-adaptins, and two smaller ones, μ2 and σ2, and has some structural similarity to AP-1 and AP-3 involved in clathrin coat production at the trans-Golgi and endosomes, respectively (12Kirchhausen T. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 705-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar).Since the original description of clathrin (13Pearse B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 1255-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), a great deal of information has been gained from co-localization experiments, bulk measurements of endocytosis and in vitro reconstitution (14Steer C.J.

These techniques are limited in real-time kinetic information regarding the production of individual clathrincoated vesicles. Recently, time-lapse epifluorescence microscopy studies have provided important insights into this process. For example, clathrin-coated vesicles appear to form only in restricted areas of the plasma membrane (17Gaidarov I. Santini F. Warren R.A. Keen J.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) and agonist-activated G-protein coupled receptors target to preexisting clathrin-coated pits for internalization, as opposed to inducing coat formation de novo (18Santini F.

Chem. 2002; 277: 3552-3559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The technique of total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIR-FM) provides a sensitive approach to examine events near the plasma membrane such as exocytosis, cell adhesion, and cytoskeletal organization (20Axelrod D. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 89: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 21Schmoranzer J. Goulian M. Axelrod D. Simon S.M. J.

Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 298-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). More recently, work by our laboratory and others has demonstrated that TIR-FM is a suitable system for analysis of molecules involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (23Licht S.S. Sonnleitner A. Weiss S. Schultz P.G. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2916-2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 24Merrifield C.J. Feldman M.E. Wan L. Almers W. Nat.

Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 847-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar).The present studies have extended our analysis of endocytosis to the AP-2 complex. Using dual-color TIR-FM to analyze the dynamics of clathrin and AP-2 in live cells, we have observed strong spatial co-localization between dsRed-clathrin and markers for AP-2. However, this correlation only holds for the static population of clathrin spots. AP-2 was not found in dynamic puncta, laterally mobile or internalized. Thus, these two populations of clathrin may be functionally distinct, and although AP-2 may be involved in the production of clathrin coats, it does not seem to be retained during the process of endocytosis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Constructs and Cell Culture—EGFP-αC-adaptin was generated by transferring the full-length mouse αC cDNA from the pACT2 vector (a gift of Dr. Juan Bonifacino, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) downstream and in frame with EGFP in pEGFP-C2 vector (Clontech) using the BglII and SalI. dsRed-clathrin (rat light chain a) was a gift of Dr. Thomas Kirchhausen, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA. EGFP-β2-adaptin was a gift of Dr. Marc G. Caron, Duke University, Durham, NC). HeLa cells were maintained in DMEM (Mediatech Cellgro, Herndon, VA) with 10% fetal bovine serum in a 37 °C incubator humidified with 5% CO2 and were imaged 48 h post-transfection with either Fugene6 (Roche Diagnostics) or the Calcium Phosphate kit (Invitrogen).Immunocytochemistry—Immunocytochemistry was performed as described previously (26Benmerah A.

Primary antibodies included anti-transferrin receptor (TfR) (CD71) and anti-γ-adaptin 100.3 and anti-β-adaptins 100.1 mouse monoclonal antibodies (Sigma), anti-CALM (C-18) and anti-Epsin (R-20) goat polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-clathrin (derived from the CON.1 hybridoma (ATCC, Manassas, VA)) and anti-Eps15 (3T, a gift of Dr. Pier Di Fiore, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy). AlexaFluor594-labeled goat anti-mouse and donkey anti-goat immunoglobulins were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Samples were examined under an epifluorescence microscope (Leica) with a cooled CCD camera (Micromax, Princeton Instruments). Images were acquired with MetaMorph (Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA) and processed with MetaMorph, NIH image (rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/) and Photoshop (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA).Tf and LDL Uptake—Cells were placed in serum free DMEM for 30 min in a 37 °C incubator to chase out cell surface bound Tf or LDL. Cells were incubated for 30 min in AlexaFluor546-Tf or DiI-LDL (Molecular Probes) diluted 1:100 in serum free DMEM, rinsed two times in phosphate-buffered saline, and placed in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum for 30 min at 37 °C. Finally, cells were rinsed two times in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed for 5 min in 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA). Epifluorescence imaging was performed as described previously (21Schmoranzer J. Goulian M. Axelrod D. Simon S.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 25Rappoport J.Z. Simon S.M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 847-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 28Rappoport J.Z. Taha B.W. Simon S.M. Traffic. 2003; 4: 460-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). EGFP fluorescence was collected with a 515/30 band pass filter (500 ms exposure) and AlexaFluor546 or DiI emission with a 570lp long pass filter (100-ms exposure). All filters and dichroic mirrors were obtained from Chroma Technologies Corp. (Brattleboro, VT). Average fluorescence per pixel for each channel was calculated for each cell using MetaMorph.TIR-FM Image Acquisition—TIR-FM was performed at 37 °C as described previously (21Schmoranzer J. Goulian M. Axelrod D. Simon S.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 25Rappoport J.Z. Simon S.M. J.

Cell. 2001; 12: 3489-3501Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). dsRed and EGFP simultaneous acquisition was performed utilizing an emission splitter (Dual-View, Optical Insights, LLC, Santa Fe, NM) equipped with a dichroic mirror to split the emission (550DCLP). The EGFP emission was then collected through an emission band pass filter (515/30) and the dsRed through an emission long pass filter (580lp).Dual-color Processing—Dual-color TIR-FM image streams were aligned and correlation coefficients were calculated using MetaMorph, as described previously (25Rappoport J.Z. Simon S.M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 847-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The correlation coefficient is a pixel-by-pixel comparison of the intensity values between the two channels being analyzed and provides a relative numerical representation of co-localization. Correlation coefficients were obtained following pixel shift of the red image planes 1 pixel at a time for 10 pixels in each direction. Each of the four values for each pixel shift was averaged. Alignment was verified by an exponential decrease in correlation coefficient following pixel shift.Calculation of Co-localization—200 dsRed-clathrin puncta were circled and average fluorescence was measured (50 per image). These regions were then transferred onto the corresponding EGFP-αC-adaptin image, and average fluorescence was measured. The same was done for EGFP-αC-adaptin spots and for the corresponding locations on the dsRed-clathrin images. Additionally, this procedure was performed for regions that did not contain dsRed-clathrin spots and regions without EGFP-αC-adaptin spots. Normalized fluorescence for all dsRed-clathrin regions was calculated by subtracting from the average fluorescence of that region the mean average fluorescence of the 50 regions identified from that image as not containing a dsRed-clathrin spot. The same was done for each EGFP-αC-adaptin data point.Calculation of Fluorescence in Static, Disappearing, and Mobile Spots—15 spots within each category were identified (5 per stream). The total fluorescence and area of the region of interest was obtained for each channel, as were the total fluorescence and area of a larger region surrounding the spot. The total fluorescence and area of the spot were then subtracted from the values for the larger region, and then the resultant fluorescence was divided by the area to obtain a value for average background fluorescence within an annulus surrounding each. Finally, each spot was normalized by dividing the average spot fluorescence per pixel by the average annulus fluorescence per pixel and then subtracting 1 from this number. For EGFP-αC-adaptin and dsRed-clathrin, the average spot area was 28.6 ± 1.1 pixels, and the average annulus area was 122.9 ± 14.5 pixels. For EGFP-β2-adaptin and dsRed-clathrin, the average spot area was 23.9 ± 0.92 pixels, and the average annulus area was 80.1 ± 6.5 pixels.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONPrevious studies have documented different populations of cell surface clathrin: static spots, mobile spots, and those that appeared to undergo endocytosis (17Gaidarov I.

Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 847-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 28Rappoport J.Z. Taha B.W. Simon S.M. Traffic. 2003; 4: 460-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) the clathrin puncta at the cell surface that disappeared into the cell (∼15% per min) or moved laterally in linear trajectories parallel to the plane of the plasma membrane (∼2% per min) represented a minority of the total. Thus, two general classes of plasma membrane associated clathrin can be defined, the dynamic and the static.The AP-2 complex is a key player in the production of clathrin coats, forming the junction between internalized receptors and clathrin triskelia. To examine when and where the AP-2 complex engages the endocytic machinery, we expressed a subunit of the AP-2 complex, α-adaptin, as a fusion protein to EGFP. A similar fusion protein has recently been used as a marker for the AP-2 complex in FRAP (fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching) studies (30Wu X. Zhao X. Puertollano R. Bonifacino J.S. Eisenberg E. Greene L.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 516-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and appeared to exhibit wild-type function.Following immunocytochemistry, many EGFP-αC-adaptin puncta co-localized with endogenous clathrin (Fig. 1, A and B), as well as other markers of clathrin-coated pits (clathrin, 96.7% co-localization; β-adaptin, 99.7%; Eps15, 98.9%; epsin, 97.7%; and CALM, 99.2%; in all cases n > 375 spots). Additionally, EGFP-αC-adaptin also co-localized with endogenous TfR suggesting its presence in active endocytic structures (Fig. 1, C and D; 94.1% co-localization, n = 409 spots). In contrast, γ-adaptin (a component of AP-1 and not AP-2) did not co-localize with EGFP-αC-adaptin (data not shown). When cells were co-transfected with dsRed-clathrin and EGFP-αC-adaptin and imaged simultaneously by TIR-FM, these two proteins appeared to co-localize in a large proportion of plasma membrane associated puncta (Fig. 2A). dsRed-clathrin intensity was significantly greater in puncta labeled with EGFP-αC-adaptin than in regions without EGFP-αC-adaptin puncta, and EGFP-αC-adaptin fluorescence was higher in regions containing dsRed-clathrin puncta than regions that did not (Fig. 2B). Additionally, quantification of the spatial correlation and the observation that the correlation coefficient decreased exponentially with deliberate misalignment of one image relative to the other indicated significant overlap between the α-adaptin and clathrin signals (Fig. 2C). Thus, EGFP-αC-adaptin co-localized in most, but not all, plasma membrane associated clathrin puncta.Fig. 2Co-localization of EGFP-αC-adaptin and dsRed-clathrin at the plasma membrane.A, dual-color TIR-FM.

C, pixel shift analysis comparing red and green channels. D, AlexaFluor546-Tf uptake in HeLa cell transfected with EGFP-αC-adaptin imaged via epi-fluorescence (n = 116 cells).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To verify that EGFP-αC-adaptin does not affect clathrin-mediated endocytosis, we quantified the uptake of AlexaFluor546-Tf and DiI-conjugated low density lipoprotein (DiI-LDL) in cells transiently expressing this fusion protein. In these studies endocytosis did not seem to be significantly affected by the expression of EGFP-αC-adaptin (Fig. 2D and data not shown). Since EGFP-αC-adaptin localizes to clathrin-coated pits, and its expression does not adversely affect endocytosis, this fusion protein was used to study the spatial-temporal regulation of the AP-2 complex.In contrast to the presence of a dynamic population of clathrin puncta (as quantified above), when EGFP-αC-adaptin was used to image AP-2, all puncta were static. This was observed consistently whether the EGFP-αC-adaptin was observed in single color mode or, when co-expressed with dsRed-clathrin, in simultaneous dual-color TIR-FM video imaging (Video 1 in the Supplemental Material).These results led us to more specifically evaluate the co-localization between dsRed-clathrin and EGFP-αC-adaptin. When a total of 200 spots were analyzed from at least four co-transfected cells (50 per field), 99.5% of EGFP-αC-adaptin puncta were labeled with dsRed-clathrin. In contrast, only 89.5% of dsRed-clathrin puncta were labeled with EGFP-αC-adaptin (179/200: 25 out of 29 in the enlarged field in Fig. 2A). Similarly, in immunocytochemistry studies several puncta of endogenous clathrin or TfR did not contain EGFP-αC-adaptin (arrowheads in Fig. 1). Thus, we hypothesized that clathrin devoid of AP-2 might represent the dynamic clathrin, puncta moving parallel to the coverslip or into the cell. To test this hypothesis we examined whether there were criteria that could distinguish dsRed-clathrin puncta that did or did not label with EGFP-αC-adaptin.To evaluate the dsRed-clathrin that did not co-localize with EGFP-αC-adaptin, clathrin puncta were classified as static, mobile, or disappearing. Fifteen spots were identified from each category, and the dsRed-clathrin fluorescence was analyzed for each. Subsequently, the EGFP-αC-adaptin fluorescence at the same points in space and time was evaluated. Although, EGFP-αC-adaptin fluorescence was equal to dsRed-clathrin fluorescence in static spots, at the sites of disappearing or mobile spots the EGFP-αC-adaptin fluorescence was indistinguishable from the background fluorescence in annuli surrounding the puncta (Fig. 3). Thus, this analysis strongly suggests that the dsRed-clathrin puncta devoid of EGFP-αC-adaptin are the dynamic population.Fig. 3dsRed-clathrin and EGFP-αC-adaptin fluorescence in disappearing, mobile, and static spots, n = 15 spots per group from at least three cells. Fluorescence is normalized to the local background fluorescence surrounding each spot at the image plane analyzed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In many cases moving dsRed-clathrin spots, without AP-2, appeared to originate from static puncta of clathrin and AP-2 (Fig. 4). A decrease in clathrin intensity was recorded (Fig. 4A) as part of a dsRed-clathrin spot moved away toward the second static spot (Fig. 4C). In contrast, the fluorescence of EGFP-αC-adaptin at the static spot did not decrease (Fig. 4, A and D). Additionally, although dsRed-clathrin fluorescence at the second spot increased as the mobile spot approached (Fig. 4B), the EGFP-αC-adaptin intensity at this location did not change.Fig. 4Absence of αC-adaptin in dynamic clathrin spots.A and B, dsRed-clathrin and EGFP-αC-adaptin fluorescence, normalized to local background, at spots 1 and 2 from four image planes (presented in C and D).

The arrows in C and D track the motion of a dsRed-clathrin spot from spot 1 (arrow in first frame) to spot 2 (arrow in last frame).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The observation of mobile clathrin puncta emerging from static spots does not necessitate that they originated as a single unified structure. However, as the depth of penetration of the evanescent field is roughly equal to the diameter of a clathrin-coated pit (∼100 nm), it is unlikely that these occurrences are the results of two distinct clathrin structures co-localizing in X and Y space relative to the plasma membrane but at different depths within the cell. The stepwise increase and decrease in clathrin spot fluorescence at the static points where dsRed-clathrin and EGFP-αC-adaptin co-localize before and after the observed motility (Fig. 4) suggests direct interactions between the static and mobile populations of clathrin. If they did indeed originate from separate puncta, it would still hold that the dynamic moving puncta are devoid of EGFP-αC-adaptin.Our analysis (Figs. 1 and 2), as well as those of others (30Wu X. Zhao X. Puertollano R. Bonifacino J.S. Eisenberg E. Greene L.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 516-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), suggest that EGFP-tagged α-adaptin is a suitable marker for the AP-2 complex. However, we sought to test our observations with an alternate marker for AP-2 (β2-adaptin), which when linked to green fluorescent protein (or yellow fluorescent protein) has also been reported to retain wild type function (31Jiang X. Huang F. Marusyk A. Sorkin A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 858-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 32Laporte S.A. Oakley R.H. Zhang J. Holt J.A. Ferguson S.S. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Proc.

In preliminary studies EGFP-β2-adaptin did not seem to significantly decrease uptake of either AlexaFluor546-Tf or DiI-LDL (data not shown). In the LDL internalization assay some transfected cells did tend to have reduced endocytosis, although this finding was not statistically significant (R2 = 0.0358).TIR-FM performed on cells co-expressing dsRed-clathrin and EGFP-β2-adaptin demonstrated significant co-localization (Fig. 5A), and video microscopy confirmed the relative static nature of β2-adaptin-labeled AP-2 compared with clathrin. Although a few dynamic clathrin spots appeared to contain some EGFP-β2-adaptin, as with EGFP-αC-adaptin, the vast majority of both disappearing and mobile spots were devoid of detectable AP-2 (Fig. 5B). Quantification demonstrated that the EGFP-β2-adaptin present at the site of 15 disappearing or mobile clathrin spots was not significantly different from local background. In contrast, static spots contained nearly equivalent amounts of clathrin and AP-2 (Fig. 5B). Thus, these results verify our previous observations with EGFP-αC-adaptin.Fig. 5Absence of β2-adaptin in dynamic clathrin spots.A, overlay of dsRed-clathrin (red) and EGFP-β2-adaptin (green) TIR-FM images. Scale bar: 5 μm. B, normalized dsRed-clathrin and EGFP-β2-adaptin fluorescence in disappearing, mobile and static spots, n = 15 spots per group from at least three cells. Fluorescence is normalized to the local background fluorescence surrounding each spot at the image plane analyzed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)While co-localization was observed between clathrin and AP-2 for a majority of spots, a static analysis does not represent the entire story. Our observations show that the minority of clathrin spots devoid of AP-2 are the clathrin puncta moving either parallel, or perpendicular, to the plasma membrane. This suggests that static co-localized puncta of clathrin and AP-2 may serve as loci for the formation of clathrin-coated pits. It is possible that the dynamic population of clathrin represents clathrin-coated vesicles that contain AP-2, but that the AP-2 is polarized toward the cytosolic side of the nascent vesicle, out of the evanescent field. However, as the depth of penetration of the evanescent field employed in these studies approximates the diameter of a clathrin-coated vesicle (∼100 nm), this is probably not the case.The observation that AP-2 does not remain with clathrin puncta that start to move was not predicted in light of current models which suggest that the AP-2 complex remains within clathrin-coated vesicles subsequent to fission from the plasma membrane (10Schmid S.L.

However, as these studies represent the first live cell imaging of the AP-2 complex during endocytosis, we currently have no information with which to directly compare our observations. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is involved in internalization of receptors and ligands, cell adhesion molecules, and the synaptic vesicle cycle (1Bretscher M.S.

Pre-mRNA splicing in trypanosomes is an essential step in gene expression, because all mRNAs undergo trans-splicing (1Agabian N.

One unique property of the snRNAs that participate in trans-splicing is their different cap structure. The SL RNA possesses a complex cap structure known as “cap4,” which consists of 2′-O-methylation of the sugar groups of the 4-nt AACU, with additional methylation on the bases of the first (m6,6A) and the fourth (m3U) nucleotides (5Perry K.L.

A co-transcriptional model for cap4 methylation was proposed that provides evidence that modification of the first 2 nt takes place on short nascent SL RNA transcripts. Modification of the fourth cap nucleotide took place only after the Sm binding site was transcribed (19Mair G. Ullu E. Tschudi C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28994-28999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Recently, studies in L. tarentolae and Trypanosoma brucei provided evidence that the SL RNA is also present in the cytoplasm and does not reside only in the nucleus (20Zeiner G.M. Sturm N.R. Campbell D.A. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 222-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Treatment of these parasites with the karyopherin-specific inhibitor leptomycin B eliminated the cytoplasmic SL RNA, and SL RNA export was shown to be mediated by the nuclear exporter, exportin 1 (XPO1). Interestingly, treatment with leptomycin B resulted in the accumulation of SL RNA with a 3′ tail, which lacked the modification on the cap4 position, suggesting that a cytoplasmic stage is necessary for SL RNA biogenesis (20Zeiner G.M.

These snRNAs are first exported to the cytoplasm assisted by several factors, including the cap-binding complex (22Izaurralde E. Lewis J. Gamberi C. Jarmolowski A. McGuigan C. Mattaj I.W.

Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar), and an additional adaptor for RNA export, PHAX (24Ohno M. Segref A. Bachi A. Wilm M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 2000; 101: 187-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Upon their export to the cytoplasm, U snRNAs interact with the seven Sm proteins to form the snRNP core complex. In vitro experiments indicate that the Sm core is assembled in a stepwise manner. The subcomplexes, D1-D2 and E-F-G, bind concomitantly to the Sm site, forming a subcore complex, and assembly is completed by its association with the B-D3 complex (25Raker V.A. Plessel G. Luhrmann R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2256-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The assembly takes place on the SMN complex, which contains additional proteins, namely SIP1/Gemin 2-7 (26Liu Q. Fischer U. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1997; 90: 1013-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 27Pellizzoni L. Yong J. Dreyfuss G. Science. 2002; 298: 1775-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The binding of the Sm protein to SMN requires the dimethylation of SmD1 and SmD3 on the arginine of the RG repeats present in these proteins (28Brahms H. Raymackers J. Union A. de Keyser F. Meheus L. Lührmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17122-17129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Following snRNP Sm core assembly, the m7G cap of the snRNA is converted to 2,2,7-trimethylated guanosine by methyltransferase (29Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1986; 46: 905-911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) and the U tail undergoes 3′ end trimming (30Seipelt R.L. Zheng B. Asuru A. Rymond B.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Both of these events are dependent on proper Sm core assembly. In budding yeast, it is not clear whether snRNP assembly involves a cytoplasmic phase. A yeast homologue of SMN is absent in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (31Will C.L. Lührmann R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 290-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). However, La protein, an autoantigen known to bind and stabilize nascent polymerase III transcripts, also binds to U snRNA precursors and facilitates U snRNP assembly in vivo (32Pannone B.K. Xue D. Wolin S.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7442-7453Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). After snRNP assembly in the cytoplasm, the snRNA is imported back to the nucleus by a special import factor, Snuportin-1, which also interacts with the general import factor importin β, both of which are required for U snRNP import (33Palacios I. Hetzer M. Adam S.A. Mattaj I.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6783-6792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Huber J. Cronshagen U. Kadokura M. Marshallsay C. Wada T. Sekine M. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4114-4126Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). As the snRNAs re-enter into the nucleus, the snRNAs associate with particle-specific proteins, and the snRNAs are internally modified at several positions by pseudouridylation and 2′-O-methylation, which are guided by novel guide RNAs, the small cajal body RNAs localized in Cajal bodies (35Darzacq X. Jady B.E. Verheggen C. Kiss A.M. Bertrand E. Kiss T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2746-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The U6 snRNA is the only spliceosomal RNA that has a different biogenesis pathway. The RNA is transcribed by RNA polymerase III and acquires a γ-monomethyl cap structure. Assembly of the U6 snRNP is thought to take place entirely in the nucleus. The RNA binds a set of Sm-like proteins known as Lsm proteins, which share the conserved structural motifs characteristic of all Sm protein family (36Mayes A.E. Verdone L. Legrain P. Beggs J.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4321-4331Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The U6 acquires the 2′-O-methylation and pseudouridylation in the nucleolus (37Ganot P. Jady B.E. Bortolin M.L. Darzacq X. Kiss T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6906-6917Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Trypanosomes carry Sm proteins that bind to the U snRNAs and SL RNA (38Palfi Z. Günzl A. Cross M. Bindereif A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9097-9101Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 39Goncharov I. Palfi Z. Bindereif A. Michaeli S. J. Biol.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8967-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). As their counterparts in other eukaryotes, the trypanosome proteins have the potential to form the canonical heptameric ringlike structure. The Sm proteins carry a bipartite Sm motif, including interesting deviations from the Sm consensus. Interestingly, the SmD1 and D3 lack the C-terminal RG dipeptide repeats of the human homologue. The arginines in this domain are methylated in the mammalian proteins (28Brahms H. Raymackers J. Union A. de Keyser F. Meheus L. Lührmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17122-17129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), constituting an important determinant of the Sm epitope. The lack of these modifications may explain why the trypanosome Sm proteins are not recognized by human Sm antibodies (16Michaeli S. Roberts T.G. Watkins K.P. Agabian N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10582-10588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Palfi Z. Günzl A. Cross M. Bindereif A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9097-9101Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The in vivo functions of Sm proteins were studied in yeast by induced depletion of SmD1. Under SmD1 depletion, splicing was inhibited at the initial step, and the level of U1, U2, U4, and U5, but not U6, was decreased. The data therefore suggest that Sm proteins play an essential role for splicing, snRNA maturation, and stability (41Rymond B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 848-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this study, we silenced two Sm proteins, namely SmE and SmD1, by RNAi, using either the expression of stem-loop RNA from the inducible procyclin (EP) promoter or from the inducible T7-opposing promoters (42Wang Z. Englund P.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4674-4683Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Silencing was lethal, and both trans- and cis-splicing were inhibited. The reduction of the Y structure intermediate suggests that trans-splicing was inhibited at the first step of splicing. As expected, the level of U1, U2, U4, and U5 snRNAs was reduced. Surprisingly, the level of SL RNA was elevated; the level of U6 and the spliced leader-associated RNA (SLA1) did not change, suggesting that U6 and SLA1 RNAs bind different core proteins. The SL RNA accumulated in the cytoplasm; it carried a long 3′ tail and lacked the modification at the cap4 nt, but it carried the ψ at position -12, suggesting that the pseudouridylation directed by SLA1 (44Liang X.-H. Xu Y.-X. Michaeli S. RNA. 2002; 8: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) takes place before the exit of the SL RNA into the cytoplasm. The SL RNA accumulated in the cytoplasm in “speckles,” which may represent the site of SL RNP assembly. The accumulation of SL RNA lacking the Cap +4nt suggests that this modification is coupled to Sm assembly and may serve as the signal for re-entry into the nucleus, analogous to the function of TMG for snRNP biogenesis. All the oligonucleotides were specific for T. brucei. Oligonucleotides for the Silencing Constructs—223392 (5′-CGACGCGTCTCATTTGATCGCTCCGTCCT-3′antisense), from positions 601 to 621 of the SmD1 coding region including a MluI site (underlined), was used for PCR amplification of the 317 bp for cloning into the pLew100 vector (42Wang Z. Englund P.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4674-4683Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) to generate the stem-loop construct. 979219 (5′-CCCAAGCTTCTCATTTGATCGCTCCGTCCT-3′ antisense), from positions 601 to 621 of the SmD1 coding region, including a HindIII site (underlined), was used for PCR amplification of the 317 bp for cloning into the pJM326 vector (42Wang Z.

Englund P.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4674-4683Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Oligonucloetides for Analysis of Small RNAs—All the oligonucleotides were specific for T. brucei. 9091 (5′-TGCGTCTGTTGGCCC-3′, antisense) was complementary to the SL RNA from positions 65 to 79. 14824 (5′-AGCTAAAAAGCCGAGAAGATAT-3′, antisense) was complementary to U2 snRNA, from positions 34 to 45. 16513 (5′-CCGCTCGAGGACACCCCAAAGTTT-3′, antisense) was complementary to U5 snRNA, from positions 48 to 62. 31253 (5′-TCTYGCTCTCCAGTTTCRTG-3′, antisense) was complementary to SLA1 RNA from positions 51 to 70. 12407 (5′-AGCTATATCTCTCGAA-3′, antisense) was complementary to U6 snRNA from position 81 to 95. TBU3 (5′-TGCCGTTCATCGAAC-3′, antisense) was complementary to U3 snoRNA from positions 109 to 123. 17036 (5′-GTACCGGATATAGT-3′, antisense) was complementary to U4 snRNA, from positions 60 to 75. TB 7SL-5A (5′-GAACCCCCGCTTGTCC-3′, antisense) was complementary to 7SL RNA, from positions 60 to 75. Oligonucleotides Used for RT-PCR of the Poly(A) Polymerase Gene—850143 (5′-CCCAACGAAACCACTAGAGG-3′ sense) was specific for the poly(A) polymerase gene (PAP), first exon, from positions 223 to 242. 307867 (5′-CTGTTCGTCGTCGTGGCA-3′, sense) was specific for the PAP cis-spliced intron, upstream from 3′ splice site, from -133 to -150. 264749 (5′-ATCGACAGCTGTGCCTCTG-3′, antisense) was complementary to the PAP gene located 136 bp downstream from the 3′ splice site. Oligonucleotides for Synthesis of 7SL RNA and the SL RNA Probes—953610 (5′-CCG CTCGAG AGC CGG AGC GCA TTG CTC TG-3′, sense) covered positions 1-16 of the T. brucei 7SL RNA with an XhoI site. 953611 (5′-CCC AAGCTT CCG CCT CGC GAC GAC ACT-3′, antisense) was complementary to positions 253-278 of the 7SL RNA with a HindIII site. These oligonucleotides were used for PCR to generate the probe for in situ hybridization. P0134B10 (5′-AAC TAA CGC TAT TAT TA-3′, sense) contained positions 1-17 of SL RNA. 0244C02 (5′-TTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGA AAA AAA ATA AAA AAA ATA-3′, antisense) was complementary to positions 143-161 with respect to the +1 position of the SL RNA transcript containing the T7 promoter (underlined). These oligonucleotides were used for preparing the PCR product used for the in vitro transcription of the SL RNA antisense probe. Cell Growth and Transfection—Procyclic T. brucei strain 29-13 (obtained from the laboratory of Paul England), which carries integrated genes for T7 polymerase and the tetracycline repressor, was grown in SDM-79 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in the presence of 50 μg/ml hygromycin and 15 μg/ml G418. Cell growth was monitored by hemocytometer. To establish the cell lines with the dsRNA-expressing construct, transformants were selected with 5 μg/ml phleomycin. For cloning, the transfected cells were diluted onto microtiter plates in the presence of untransfected T. brucei 29-13, which served as feeder cells. The feeder cells (108) were diluted 1:20, and 2.5 ml was added to 0.5 ml (∼5 × 105 cells) of cells after transfection. The mixture was diluted from 1:10 to 1:10,000, and 200 μl were portioned as aliquots onto the microtiter plate. Next, the microtiter plate was incubated in a humid chamber at 27 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. After 2-3 weeks, a clonal population was obtained in the microtiter plates and the cells were transferred to medium for propagation. Cells from cultures that showed typical growth arrest upon tetracycline induction were grown and frozen. Every 2 weeks a new culture was started from the original frozen stock. Preparation of Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extracts—T. brucei procyclics (108) were harvested and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellet was resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml leupeptin). Next, the cells were broken by 20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer in the presence of 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The nuclei were pelleted at 10,000 × g. The pellet and the cytoplasmic fractions were deproteinized and the RNA subjected to primer extension with the different probes. Northern Analysis—Total RNA was prepared with TRIzol reagent (Sigma), and 20 μg/lane was fractionated on a 1.2% agarose, 2.2 m formaldehyde gel. The RNA was visualized with ethidium bromide. The SmE and SmD1 mRNA and tubulin mRNAs were detected with randomly labeled probes (Random Primer DNA Labeling Mix, Biological Industries Co.). For analyzing small RNAs, total RNA was fractionated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea. The RNA was transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond; Amersham Biosciences) and probed with γ-32P-end-labeled oligonucleotides or antisense SL RNA probe. The antisense SL RNA probe was transcribed in vitro by T7 polymerase using a PCR product encoding for the SL RNA gene and carrying the T7 promoter as a template. Primer Extension and Mapping the Pseudouridine on the SL RNA—Primer extension was as described previously (12Xu Y. Ben-Shlomo H. Michaeli S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8473-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Total RNA or RNA from nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions (10 μg) was used in a primer extension reaction with 100,000 cpm [γ-32P]ATP-labeled oligonucleotide. After annealing at 55-60 °C for 15 min and chilling on ice for 2 min, 1 unit of reverse transcriptase (Expand RT, Roche) and 1 unit of RNase inhibitor (Promega) were added and an extension reaction was performed at 42 °C for 90 min. The extension products were ethanol-precipitated and analyzed on 6% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gel. For determining the ψ on the SL RNA, RNA from 5 × 108 cells was divided into two parts. Half was treated with 30 μl of CMC buffer (0.17 m CMC in 50 mm Bicine, pH 8.3, 4 mm EDTA, 7 m urea) at 37 °C for 20 min. To remove the CMC groups, the CMC-treated RNA was subjected to alkali hydrolysis with 40 μl of Na2CO3 (50 mm, pH 10.4) at 37 °C for 2 h, as previously described (45Bakin A. Ofengand J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9754-9762Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The RNA (15 μg) was used as a template in primer extension analysis with oligonucleotide 9091. Western Analysis—Whole cell extracts of induced and uninduced cells was prepared from 5 × 108 cells as previously described (16Michaeli S. Roberts T.G. Watkins K.P. Agabian N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10582-10588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extracts were fractionated on a DEAE column, and the column eluate was analyzed by Western analysis. Proteins were fractionated on SDS-PAGE (12% gel), transferred to NitroBind (Micron Separations, Inc.), and probed with the antibodies. The anti-CP antibodies (kindly provided by Albrecht Bindereif) were diluted 1:1000 (43Palfi Z. Bindereif A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20159-20163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bound antibodies were detected with goat anti-rabbit bound to horseradish peroxidase and visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). RNase Protection—Total RNA (10-30 μg) was mixed with 100,000 cpm of gel-purified RNA probe and concentrated by ethanol precipitation. The pellet was washed and dissolved in hybridization buffer (40 mm PIPES, pH 6.4, 80% formamide, 0.4 m sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA). After having been boiled for 1 min, the samples were incubated at 42 °C for 14-16 h. After the hybridization, the samples were diluted 1:10 with a solution consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 200 mm sodium acetate, containing 2.5 units/ml RNase ONE (Promega). The digestion was performed at 30 °C for 1 h and terminated by proteinase K digestion. After phenol-chloroform extraction, the protected products were precipitated with ethanol in the presence of 20 μg of glycogen and analyzed on a 6% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea denaturing gel. RT-PCR—The total RNA was extensively treated with DNase inactivation reagent (DNA-free; Ambion) to remove the DNA contamination. Reverse transcription was performed on the RNA with antisense primers. The samples were heated for 5 min at 95 °C, followed by annealing for 15 min at 60 °C. After having been chilled on ice for 2 min, 1 unit of reverse transcriptase (Expand RT, Roche) and 1 unit of RNase inhibitor (Promega) were added, and the reaction was performed at 42 °C for 60 min. Next, the cDNA was used in PCR amplification. The negative control consisted of RNA that was directly used for PCR. In Situ Hybridization—PCR for preparing the digoxigenin-11 (DIG)-labeled DNA probe was performed under standard conditions using the expand high fidelity enzyme (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The dNTP mixture contained 200 μm amounts of each of the nucleotides except dTTP (130 μm) and DIG-dUTP (70 μm). The conditions for fixation and hybridization were similar to those published previously (46Liu L. Ben-Shlomo H. Xu Y.X. Stern M.Z. Goncharov I. Zhang Y. Michaeli S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18271-18280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Microscopic slides were prepared by dropping 20 μl of fixed-cell suspension on glass slides. The slides were allowed to air-dry. Before hybridization, the cells were subjected to partial hydrolysis and proteolysis by using 0.1% pepsin in 0.01 m HCl for 5 min at 37 °C. The DIG-labeled PCR product was in 60% deionized formamide, 2× SSC, 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, and 500 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Hybridization was performed at 42 °C overnight. After hybridization, the slides were rinsed three times for 20 min each in 50% formamide, 2× SSC at 42 °C. Finally, slides were washed three times for 5 min at room temperature. For detection of the DIG-labeled probes, slides were incubated for 45 min at room t"
https://openalex.org/W1982709555,"We have employed microarray technology using RNA from normal 3T3-L1 adipocytes and from 3T3-L1 adipocytes made insulin-resistant by treatment with tumor necrosis factor-α to identify a new class of insulin-responsive genes. These genes continued to respond normally to insulin even though the adipocytes themselves were metabolically insulin-resistant, i.e. they displayed a significantly decreased rate of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Approximately 12,000 genes/expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were screened. Of these, 40 genes/ESTs were identified that became insulin-resistant as expected (e.g. Socs-3, junB, and matrix metalloproteinase-11). However, 61 genes/ESTs continued to respond normally to insulin. Although some of these genes were previously shown to be regulated by insulin (e.g. Glut-1 and β3-adrenergic receptor), other novel insulin-sensitive genes were also identified (e.g. Egr-1, epiregulin, Fra-1, and ABCA1). Real-time reverse transcription-PCR analysis confirmed the expression patterns of several of the differentially expressed genes. One gene that remained insulin-sensitive in the insulin-resistant adipocytes is the transcription factor Egr-1. Using an antisense strategy, we show that tissue factor and macrophage colony-stimulating factor, two cardiovascular risk factors, are downstream EGR-1 target genes in the adipocyte. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that some signaling pathways remain insulin-sensitive in metabolically insulin-resistant adipocytes. These pathways may promote abnormal gene expression in hyperinsulinemic states like obesity and type II diabetes and thus may contribute to pathologies associated with these conditions.

These pathways may promote abnormal gene expression in hyperinsulinemic states like obesity and type II diabetes and thus may contribute to pathologies associated with these conditions. Insulin resistance and obesity represent rapidly growing major health problems worldwide and are hallmarks for type II diabetes (1Zimmet P. Alberti K.G. Shaw J. Nature. 2001; 414: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (4498) Google Scholar). A strong correlation exists between insulin resistance and abdominal visceral fat accumulation (2Bjorntorp P. Diabetes Metab. Res. Rev. 1999; 15: 427-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and a substantial body of evidence points to the existence of genetic determinants of fat mass (3Comuzzie A.G. Allison D.B.

However, despite recent advancements in these fields, the molecular changes that contribute to these conditions and to the subsequent development of type II diabetes remain enigmatic.Studies of cultured adipocytes and of mouse models of obesity have begun to shed light on this problem. For example, the adipocyte can no longer be viewed as a passive participant in the development of obesity and is now considered to be a metabolically active secretory cell that plays an important role in the regulation of energy balance and body composition (7Loskutoff D.J. Samad F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). During the development of obesity and type II diabetes, these cells increase in size and exhibit modified metabolic properties, and their sensitivity/response to hormones may change. Experimental and clinical observations support a connection between adipocyte-derived factors and the association of insulin resistance with an increased risk for cardiovascular events (8Juhan-Vague I. Alessi M.C. Morange P.E. Ann. Med. 2000; 32: 78-84PubMed Google Scholar).Insulin itself is a hormone that induces a cascade of intracellular events in the adipocyte (9Saltiel A.R. Kahn C.R. Nature. 2001; 414: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (3842) Google Scholar). For example, upon binding to the α-subunits of its receptor at the cell surface, insulin activates the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the β-subunits of the receptor. This interaction leads to phosphorylation of intracellular proteins, including insulin receptor substrate-1–4, GAB-1, and Cbl. The insulin signals subsequently diverge through different pathways that appear to control distinct functions such as glucose transport, glucose/lipid metabolism, cell growth, protein synthesis, and gene expression (10Ferrannini E. Galvan A.Q. Gastaldelli A. Camastra S. Sironi A.M. Toschi E. Baldi S. Frascerra S. Monzani F. Antonelli A. Nannipieri M. Mari A. Seghieri G. Natali A. Eur. J. Clin.

For example, numerous studies have confirmed a role for phosphatidylinositol (PI) 1The abbreviations used are: PIphosphatidylinositolMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseIRinsulin-resistantNnormalPAI-1plasminogen activator inhibitor-1MCP-1monocyte chemoattractant protein-1TNF-αtumor necrosis factor-αESTexpressed sequence tagMCSFmacrophage colony-stimulating factorCCchange callFC-fold changeRTreverse transcriptionMOmorpholino oligonucleotide(s).1The abbreviations used are: PIphosphatidylinositolMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseIRinsulin-resistantNnormalPAI-1plasminogen activator inhibitor-1MCP-1monocyte chemoattractant protein-1TNF-αtumor necrosis factor-αESTexpressed sequence tagMCSFmacrophage colony-stimulating factorCCchange callFC-fold changeRTreverse transcriptionMOmorpholino oligonucleotide(s). 3-kinase and AKT/protein kinase B in metabolic signaling; and recently, it was reported that TC10 is important for glucose transport and metabolism (11Chiang S.H. Baumann C.A. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Watson R.T. Neudauer C.L. Macara I.G. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2001; 410: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). However, the effects of insulin on gene expression often occur independently of PI 3-kinase activity and may instead require activation of the Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway, especially in the insulin-resistant (IR) state (12Samad F. Pandey M. Bell P.A. Loskutoff D.J. Mol. Med. 2000; 6: 680-692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Cusi K. Maezono K. Osman A. Pendergrass M. Patti M.E. Pratipanawatr T. DeFronzo R.A. Kahn C.R.

Rev. 1995; 75: 473-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). It is frequently used to describe the impairment of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by muscle and adipocytes. However, the degree to which some of the other actions of insulin (e.g. gene expression) are normal or resistant in this state is not clear. If some genes do not become resistant to insulin, then it is possible that the hyperinsulinemia that frequently accompanies obesity and insulin resistance may promote the abnormal expression of these genes in insulin-responsive tissues. This hypothesis is supported by previous observations showing that IR adipocytes and mice remained sensitive to insulin in terms of the expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) (12Samad F. Pandey M. Bell P.A. Loskutoff D.J. Mol. Med. 2000; 6: 680-692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (16Shimomura I. Matsuda M. Hammer R.E. Bashmakov Y.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7265-7270Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). Identification of the genes that continue to respond to insulin in IR adipocytes, in concert with studies of the properties of these genes and the signaling pathways that regulate them, may provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms that control abnormal gene expression in obesity and type II diabetes.To begin to define this gene family, we screened ∼12,000 transcripts by performing expression profiling using microarray technology. By comparing the gene expression profiles of insulin-treated normal (N) 3T3-L1 adipocytes and metabolically IR 3T3-L1 adipocytes prepared by treatment with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (12Samad F. Pandey M. Bell P.A. Loskutoff D.J. Mol. Med. 2000; 6: 680-692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we have identified 61 genes/expressed sequence tags (ESTs) that respond normally to insulin in IR adipocytes. One of these genes is the transcription factor Egr-1. Antisense studies demonstrated that activation of Egr-1 promoted the induction of tissue factor and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF) mRNAs by insulin.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—Murine 3T3-L1 fibroblasts (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured in vitro and differentiated into fully mature adipocytes as described (12Samad F. Pandey M. Bell P.A. Loskutoff D.J. Mol. Med. 2000; 6: 680-692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1975; 5: 19-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). IR cells were obtained by incubating the differentiated adipocytes for 3 days in the presence of 3 ng/ml TNF-α (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) with fresh media changes each day as described (12Samad F. Pandey M. Bell P.A. Loskutoff D.J. Mol. Med. 2000; 6: 680-692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Sartipy P. Loskutoff D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1994; 91: 4854-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). Adipocytes treated in parallel but without TNF-α were considered N adipocytes. In both cases, after overnight incubation in serum-free medium supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin, insulin-stimulated 2-[3H]deoxyglucose transport was determined as described (12Samad F. Pandey M. Bell P.A. Loskutoff D.J. Mol. Med. 2000; 6: 680-692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For experiments with insulin, the cells were incubated with or without 1000 nm bovine insulin (Sigma) for 3 h in fresh serum-free medium. Under the experimental conditions used in this study, this concentration of insulin appears to signal mainly via the insulin receptor (12Samad F. Pandey M. Bell P.A. Loskutoff D.J. Mol. Med. 2000; 6: 680-692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Sartipy P. Loskutoff D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7265-7270Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). After completion of each experiment, the cells were lysed using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and the extracts were stored at -80 °C until further processed. For protein extraction, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and extracted using 1% SDS.RNA Isolation—Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent together with a subsequent cleanup RNeasy protocol (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA) following the instructions of the manufacturers.Gene Expression Profiling—For each experiment, total RNA was isolated and pooled from duplicate culture dishes and reverse-transcribed into cDNA, which, in turn, was used as template for the generation of biotin-labeled cRNA. The cRNA was fragmented and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChips® U74A v2 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) at the DNA Array Core Facility of the Scripps Research Institute according to the Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis manual. However, it should be noted that the first experiment with IR cells was conducted using the original version U74A arrays. The hybridized chips were stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin conjugate and then scanned using an Agilent GeneArray scanner. Quantitative analysis of hybridization patterns and intensities was performed automatically by Affymetrix software as described (20Lockhart D.J. Dong H. Byrne M.C. Follettie M.T. Gallo M.V. Chee M.S. Mittmann M. Wang C. Kobayashi M. Horton H. Brown E.L. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1675-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (2795) Google Scholar, 21Lipshutz R.J. Fodor S.P. Gingeras T.R. Lockhart D.J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1856) Google Scholar), and the resulting data were analyzed using Affymetrix Microarray Suite Version 5.0 software. To ensure reproducibility of the microarray results, the experiments were repeated three times (twice using the U74A v2 chip and once using the U74A chip) each for N and IR 3T3-L1 adipocytes over a time period of 9 months using cells at the same passage for each experiment.Each GeneChip® was evaluated using “single array analysis” as described by Affymetrix. The RNA levels were quantitatively estimated by “signal,” which serves as an indicator of the level of expression of a transcript, and by “detection call,” which is obtained using an algorithm based on signal intensity and quality. With the detection call, a transcript is classified as “absent,” “marginal,” or “present.”Genes/ESTs (from hereon referred to only as genes) with altered expression after insulin treatment were identified by two criteria using “comparison analysis” as follows. First, a “change call” (CC) was obtained for each comparison. With the CC, a gene is classified as increased (I), marginally increased (MI), no change (NC), marginally decreased (MD), or decreased (D). A scoring system for the CC was established, with a CC of I = 1, MI = 0.5, NC = 0, MD = -0.5, and D = -1. The CC score was calculated as the sum of the CC for each of the three individual experiments with N and IR cells, respectively. Second, the “-fold change” (FC) in expression between insulin-treated cells and control cells was calculated using the signal log ratio and formulas provided by Affymetrix.The selection criteria for increased expression between control and insulin-treated cells for each condition (N and IR cells) for any given gene were as follows. First, a detection call of present for the gene in the insulin-treated cells was required in all three replicate experiments. Second, the CC score for the gene had to be ≥2.5, i.e. the independent replicates for a given gene all had to show a consistent change of expression. Finally, the FC had to be >3 for the gene in either N or IR cells. The selection criteria for decreased expression between control and insulin-treated cells were a detection call of present in the control cells in all three experiments, a CC score of -2.5 or less, and an FC of less than -3. Similar selection criteria, sometimes referred to as “directional consistency,” have been used before and have proven successful for accurate identification of differentially expressed genes using Affymetrix GeneChips® (22Busch A.K.

This analysis generated two classes of genes: 1) genes that remained insulin-sensitive and that were regulated by insulin in both N and IR cells with no significant difference in FC between the two conditions and 2) genes that became insulin-resistant and that were regulated by insulin in N adipocytes, but were not regulated or were significantly less regulated in IR cells.Real-time Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was reverse-transcribed, and the resulting cDNA was analyzed by real-time PCR as described (17Sartipy P. Loskutoff D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7265-7270Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar) using gene-specific primer sets (see Supplemental Material). Real-time PCRs were performed with SYBR Green I chemistry in an iCycler (Bio-Rad). The authenticity of the PCR products was verified by melting curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis. cDNA quantities were normalized to 18 S rRNA quantities measured in the same samples.Antisense Morpholino Oligonucleotide (MO) Inhibition of Egr-1 Translation—Fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with Egr-1-specific antisense MO (Gene Tools, LLC, Philomath, OR) at a final concentration of 1.4 μm following the Special Delivery protocol indicated by the manufacturer. The sequence of the Egr-1 antisense MO was 5′-CAGCGAGCTGGAGAACTGATGTTGG. A control antisense MO composed of a random sequence (Gene Tools, LLC) was also used at the same concentration. MO-treated cells were incubated with or without 1000 nm insulin for 3 h at 37 °C, and total cell protein and RNA were prepared as described above.Western Blotting—Protein extracts from MO-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes (50 μg/lane) were loaded onto a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad). After electrophoresis, the gel was blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a Trans-Blot® semidry transfer cell (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. EGR-1 protein was detected using rabbit polyclonal IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1:2000 and peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) diluted 1:10,000 essentially as described (25Sartipy P. Bondjers G. Hurt-Camejo E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1934-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The blot was developed using the SuperSignal® West Pico system (Pierce).Data and Statistical Analysis—Microarray data obtained from Affymetrix Microarray Suite Version 5.0 software were imported into Microsoft Excel 2000 for further analysis. All other calculations were done using GraphPAD Prism Version 3.02 software. The data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance between two groups was determined using Student's t test.RESULTSChronic TNF-α Treatment of 3T3-L1 Adipocytes Leads to Metabolic Insulin Resistance in Vitro—To obtain IR adipocytes, fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated for 3 days with low concentrations of TNF-α (3 ng/ml), a treatment that previously had been shown to significantly reduce the rate of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake without inducing morphological changes in mature adipocytes (12Samad F. Pandey M. Bell P.A. Loskutoff D.J. Mol. Med. 2000; 6: 680-692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Sartipy P. Loskutoff D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 971-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). In this regard, the TNF-α-treated cells did not display general signs of dedifferentiation because the expression levels of several adipocyte markers (e.g. adipsin, fatty-acid synthase, and lipoprotein lipase) were not altered (data not shown). To verify that the cells used in these experiments were IR, we measured insulin-stimulated 2-[3H]deoxyglucose transport. As illustrated in Table I, TNF-α pretreatment of the adipocytes decreased the rate of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by ∼60%. Microarray analysis of the RNA prepared from these cells also indicated that there were defects in IR cells regarding expression of genes that control insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. For example, expression of the glucose transporters GLUT-4 and GLUT-1 was significantly decreased in IR cells compared with N cells (40 and 50%, respectively) (Table I). The expression of hexokinase II, an enzyme that catalyzes the first step in intracellular glucose metabolism, also appeared to be decreased by ∼30%, reaching borderline significance. Finally, although the low expression levels of the PI 3-kinase p85 β-subunit, of insulin receptor substrate-2, and of protein kinase Cϵ in N cells were close to the detection limit of the microarrays, they were given a present call. However, these genes were not detected in the IR cells and thus were given an absent call in these cells. The absent call makes it impossible to determine quantitative changes in the expression levels of these genes after treatment with TNF-α. However, it is anticipated that the changes are in the same range as those for Glut-4, hexokinase II, and Glut-1. Taken together, these data support previous observations showing that TNF-α-treated adipocytes become metabolically IR (19Hotamisligil G.S. Murray D.L. Choy L.N. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4854-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar, 27Ruan H. Miles P.D. Ladd C.M. Ross K. Golub T.R. Olefsky J.M. Lodish H.F. Diabetes. 2002; 51 (P. D.

Cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated overnight in serum-free medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was then determined as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the data are expressed as the percentage of insulin-stimulated uptake in normal cells set to 100%. Changes in expression of genes previously reported to be involved in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and metabolism were monitored using Affymetrix U74A v2 microarrays. The quantitative changes in gene expression were illustrated using the signal parameter, which is proportional to the abundance of a transcript.

Initially, the specificity of the microarray analysis was investigated. To estimate the false-positive rate, comparison analysis was performed using the data from the three independent replicates of the untreated control N 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In theory, there should be no differentially expressed genes in these comparisons. However, minor experimental errors and variations between RNA samples may introduce false-positive results that would seem to indicate differentially expressed genes. The false-positive rate was 0.72% using the directional consistency criterion as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Further filtering out of genes that displayed an FC of <2 (increase or decrease) decreased the false-positive rate to 0.42%, and increasing the stringency to an FC of <3 (increase or decrease) resulted in a false-positive rate of only 0.13%. This high stringency ensured confidence in the reproducibility of the results and was therefore subsequently used to identify differentially expressed genes in insulin-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes.Once the analysis system was optimized to minimize false positives, the microarrays were screened for differentially expressed genes (Tables II, III, IV, V). The differential expression of the various genes was qualitatively evaluated using the detection call and the CC score (see “Experimental Procedures”). The quantitative changes in gene expression are illustrated using the parameter FC, which represents the relative change in the abundance of a transcript after insulin treatment in relation to its untreated control. To minimize any bias in the interpretation of the data, we used statistical tools to assign differentially expressed genes to different classes (insulin-sensitive and insulin-resistant). Because the power of statistics increases as the number of replicates are increased, the analysis of only a few replicates that display relatively high variation may lead to the misleading conclusion that there is no difference between two treatments. To draw attention to this potential limitation, we listed the genes in Tables II, III, IV, V in order of decreasing confidence in the results. The majority of the genes (i.e. those in the top 80% or so in each table) were classified with a high level of confidence. However, a few genes displayed rather large quantitative variation in response to insulin between experiments, and these are listed in the bottom of the tables. Thus, although the statistical analysis indicated no significant difference in the response of these genes to insulin in N and IR adipocytes, these data should be interpreted with some caution. Further validation experiments are needed to classify these genes with certainty.Table IIGenes that are up-regulated by insulin and continue to respond to insulin in IR adipocytes N and IR 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated with or without 1000 nm insulin for 3 h. Differentially expressed genes were identified using Affymetrix U74A v2 microarrays as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Shown are the genes that were up-regulated in response to insulin treatment. The basal gene expression levels may differ between N and IR cells for certain genes. Nevertheless, there is not a statistically significant difference in the FC between N and IR cells.Gene nameAccession no.FC ± S.E.FCIR/FCNNIRESTAW260308aThe genes indicated represent those that were unrecognized in the first experiment with IR cells by probe sets subsequently defined by Affymetrix to be faulty, but that were considered increased in the other five experiments with IR and N cells5.7 ± 1.110.5 ± 7.91.8ESTAI8455849.2 ± 1.411.3 ± 6.61.2ESTAV376312aThe genes indicated represent those that were unrecognized in the first experiment with IR cells by probe sets subsequently defined by Affymetrix to be faulty, but that were considered increased in the other five experiments with IR and N cells4.5 ± 0.35.3 ± 0.71.2ESTAI851250aThe genes indicated represent those that were unrecognized in the first experiment with IR cells by probe sets subsequently defined by Affymetrix to be faulty, but that were considered increased in the other five experiments with IR and N cells4.1 ± 1.05.0 ± 2.01.2ESTAW215736aThe genes indicated represent those that were unrecognized in the first experiment with IR cells by probe sets subsequently defined by Affymetrix to be faulty, but that were considered increased in the other five experiments with IR and N cells4.1 ± 0.44.4 ± 0.11.1ESTAW1214473.3 ± 0.23.6 ± 0.21.1Small inducible cytokine A7 (MCP-3)X700584.8 ± 0.54.8 ± 0.71.0ESTAI596360aThe genes indicated represent those that were unrecognized in the first experiment with IR cells by probe sets subsequently defined by Affymetrix to be faulty, but that were considered increased in the other five experiments with IR and N cells4.0 ± 0.33.7 ± 0.00.9ESTAI8405793.7 ± 0.33.3 ± 0.20.9SIK similar protein (nucleolar protein-5)AF0532323.5 ± 0.33.3 ± 0.70.9ESTAI132491aThe genes indicated represent those that were unrecognized in the first experiment with IR cells by probe sets subsequently defined by Affymetrix to be faulty, but that were considered increased in the other five experiments with IR and N cells3.1 ± 0.12.8 ± 0.00.9EpiregulinD3078299.0 ± 41.275.6 ± 59.30.8Heme oxygenase (decycling)-1X56824aThe genes indicated repr"

A reverse strand gene located upstream of the parkin gene in the human genome has been identified. The gene product, termed Glup/PACRG, forms a large molecular chaperone complex containing heat shock proteins 70 and 90 and chaperonin components. Glup suppressed cell death induced by accumulation of unfolded Pael receptor (Pael-R), a substrate of Parkin. On the other hand, Glup facilitated the formation of inclusions consisting of Pael-R, molecular chaperones, protein degradation molecules, and Glup itself, when proteasome is inhibited. Glup knockdown attenuated the formation of Pael-R inclusions, which resulted in the promotion of cell death with extensive vacuolization. Moreover, Glup turned out to be a component of Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease cases. These data suggest that Glup may play an important role in the formation of Lewy bodies and protection of dopaminergic neurons against Parkinson's disease.

Although the physiological function of α-SYN is still unclear, there is evidence that even wild-type α-SYN is a major component of Lewy bodies (LBs) and that its overexpression in animal models causes neurodegeneration, thus suggesting that α-SYN might be important in the etiology of PD (3Trojanowski J.Q.

LBs are neuronal inclusions that are frequently found in various regions, including the substantia nigra, of the brains of PD patients. This finding strongly suggests the involvement of abnormal protein turnover in PD.

Parkin protein is a RING finger-type ubiquitin ligase, and AR-JP-linked Parkin mutants are defective in ubiquitin ligase activity (7Imai Y. Soda M. Takahashi R. J. Biol.

The accumulation of unfolded Pael-R, a substrate for Parkin recently identified in our laboratory, causes unfolded protein stress, which results in cell death. Parkin eliminates unfolded Pael-R, in cooperation with the molecular chaperone Hsp70 and a U box protein, known as CHIP. Other findings in transgenic α-SYN toxicity have demonstrated that molecular chaperones attenuate unfolded protein toxicity, without suppressing the formation of inclusion bodies (10Auluck P.K.

Thus, protein degradation and the molecular chaperone system appear to be closely associated with the pathogenesis and prevention of PD. During structural analysis of the parkin gene, another gene was found to be located only 200 bp upstream of the parkin gene (11Asakawa S. Tsunematsu K. Takayanagi A. Sasaki T. Shimizu A. Shintani A.

Here we report that the gene located upstream of parkin (designated as Glup) is one component of LBs and suppresses unfolded Pael-R-mediated neural death, promoting formation of Pael-R inclusion bodies.

Full-length cDNAs of human and mouse Glup and human β-actin were cloned by reverse transcription and PCR from a human brain cDNA library or first strand cDNA from Neuro2A cells and subcloned into the mammalian expression vectors pcDNA3, with or without various tags (Invitrogen). For RNAi experiments, the sequences of human Glup, 5′-AAGATCCTACCTGTCCTTCCAC-3′ (for clone h4), and murine Glup, 5′-AAGATTCTACCTGTCATTCCTC-3′ (for clone m4) and 5′-AAGAACATGAATGTGAACTCCG-3′ (for clone m5), were inserted into pSUPER vector to generate short hairpin RNA. Anti-Glup Ab was raised against GST-Glup after removal of the GST moiety. For the most part, full-length GST-Glup is difficult to express in bacteria, and it is therefore expressed as an N-terminal truncated form with a GST moiety. The Ab is affinity-purified by the antigen. Anti-VCP Ab was generated against recombinant His6-tagged (His-) VCP expressed in bacteria. Anti-TCP1α (23c and 84a) and anti-TCP1β (CTA-200) Abs were from StressGen. Anti-TCP1β (C-17), anti-Hsp90 (H-114), and anti-Hsp70 (K-20 and W-24) Abs were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-FLAG (M2) and anti-γ-tubulin (GTU-88) were obtained from Sigma. Anti-HA (3F10) and anti-Hop (28Kim S. Nollen E.A. Kitagawa K. Bindokas V.P. Morimoto R.I. Nat.

For immunoabsorption experiments, FLAG-Glup, FLAG-Parkin, FLAG-Pael-R, and TCP1β-Myc purified from cultured cells as well as recombinant His-Hsp70, His-VCP, and His-Hdj-2 from bacteria were used for the corresponding Abs. MG-132 was obtained from the Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan). Cell Culture, Transfection, and Cell Death Assays—Human embryonic kidney 293T and neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine fetal calf serum. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells transfected with pcDNA3 bearing FLAG-Glup, FLAG-Parkin, or Pael-R-FLAG were selected with 1 mg/ml G418. The cells stably expressing these proteins were isolated as 293/FLAG-Glup, 293/FLAG-Parkin, or 293/FLAG-Pael-R cells, respectively. Primary midbrain cultures were prepared from E12.5 mouse embryos and were maintained with Neurobasal Medium supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen). Transfection and cell death assays using PC12 cells expressing Pael-R with EGFP (P1 cell) were carried out as described previously (15Imai Y. Soda M. Hatakeyama S. Akagi T. Hashikawa T. Nakayama K.I. Takahashi R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The amounts of total DNA for transient transfection were equally adjusted. Immunoprecipitation, Western Blot, and Fractionation—Immunoprecipitation, Western blot, and detergent-soluble/insoluble fractionation were performed as described previously (13Imai Y. Soda M. Inoue H. Hattori N. Mizuno Y. Takahashi R. Cell. 2001; 105: 891-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). Immunohisto/Cytochemistry—Immunocytochemistry was performed as described (13Imai Y. Soda M. Inoue H. Hattori N. Mizuno Y. Takahashi R. Cell. 2001; 105: 891-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). Thereafter, the cells were analyzed using a laser-scanning confocal microscope system (Leica, TCS SP2). For the LB staining experiment, 15 autopsy brains consisting of 6 patients with PD (aged 64-81 years) and 3 with dementia with Lewy bodies (aged 73-84 years) were examined. Samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde with 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, for a week and embedded in paraffin. Midbrain sections (5 μm thick) pretreated with 99% formic acid for 3 min were stained with anti-Glup Ab (dilution 1:5), using a Vectastain ABC elite kit (Vector), and counterstained with hematoxylin. For a preabsorption test, the Ab solution, including 10 μg/ml Glup protein and 2% bovine serum albumin, was preincubated at room temperature for 2 h before staining. Glup Forms a Complex with Chaperones—Because there have been recent reports that Glup/PACRG is co-regulated with Parkin by the shared promoter, we expected Glup to be functionally related to Parkin. To elucidate its physiological function in the cell, we biochemically isolated Glup-binding proteins (Fig. 1A). The binding proteins included Hsp70, heat shock cognate protein (Hsc) 70, Hsp90, a co-chaperone Hop, components of mammalian chaperonin, and known substrates of these chaperones tubulins and actin (16Yaffe M.B. Farr G.W. Miklos D. Horwich A.L. Sternlicht M.L. Sternlicht H. Nature. 1992; 358: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 17Sternlicht H. Farr G.W. Sternlicht M.L. Driscoll J.K.

A. 1994; 91: 9111-9115Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Among them, Hsc/Hsp70 and actin were also detected with the FLAG-Parkin immunoprecipitate. We detected seven of eight components of chaperonin in the biochemically isolated Glup complex and confirmed by immunoprecipitation/Western blot analysis that the last component TCP1θ is located in the Glup complex (Fig. 1B). The components of chaperonin, TCP1α and -β, interacted with Glup with an N-terminal FLAG tag (FLAG-Glup) but only weakly with FLAG-Parkin, whereas Hsp70 bound to FLAG-Glup as well as FLAG-Parkin and Pael-R with a C-terminal FLAG-tag (Pael-R-FLAG) (Fig. 1B). The interaction of Hsp90 with Glup was more specific than other proteins (Fig. 1B). Gel filtration analysis revealed that Glup could form a huge complex with Hsp90, Hsp70, Hop, TCP1α (Fig. 1C), TCP1β, and TCP1θ (data not shown). Because Glup binds to chaperonin much more strongly than Parkin and Pael-R and because the molecular size of Glup is suitable for the pore of chaperonin, it is possible that Glup is one of the substrates for chaperonin. To examine whether Glup is a substrate of chaperonin, we co-immunoprecipitated FLAG-Glup with TCP1β or TCP1α following synthesis of FLAG-Glup in the reticulocyte lysate (Fig. 2A). The amount of co-immunoprecipitated Glup was essentially constant up to 40 min after Glup synthesis was terminated, during the time in which the known chaperonin substrate β-actin was rapidly released from TCP1α (19Gao Y. Thomas J.O. Chow R.L. Lee G.H. Cowan N.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1043-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). We next pulse-labeled 293 cells stably expressing FLAG-Glup (293/FLAG-Glup cells) with [35S]methionine/cysteine and then chased the amount of co-immunoprecipitated FLAG-Glup or β-actin with TCP1α (Fig. 2B). The pulse-chase experiment also showed that Glup, but not β-actin, constitutively associates with a component of chaperonin. Finally, we investigated the effects of ATP, GTP, or these derivatives on the binding of Glup to a chaperonin component (Fig. 2C). The affinity between Glup and TCP1β was completely unaffected by these reagents. These results strongly suggest that Glup is not a substrate of chaperonin. Glup Binds to Parkin and Pael-R—Glup forms a complex with molecular chaperones such as Hsp70, and because Parkin also binds to Hsp70, we expected that Glup would also bind to Parkin, either directly or via Hsp70. Transient transfection and subsequent immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Glup specifically binds to FLAG-Parkin (Fig. 3A). Next, we generated an anti-Glup antibody (Ab), and we confirmed that the Ab recognized ∼28-kDa proteins, which are expressed abundantly in the cortex, the brainstem, and the spinal cord and weakly in the cerebellum (Fig. 3, B and C, and data not shown). With the anti-Glup Ab, we detected anti-Glup-positive signals in the anti-Parkin immunoprecipitate, both from cultured cells and brain tissue (Fig. 3C). The amount of associated Glup with Parkin was increased in the Parkin immunoprecipitate following transient Hsp70 overexpression (Fig. 3D). Although transient TCP1β overexpression dramatically promotes TCP1β incorporation into the Parkin immunoprecipitate, its ability to recruit Glup into the Parkin complex is less than that of Hsp70 (Fig. 3D). Further association analysis in Hsp70 co-expression with Glup or Parkin and treatment of proteasome inhibitors (MG-132 and lactacystin) were carried out using 293 cells stably expressing FLAG-Parkin or FLAG-Glup. Hsp70 overexpression, inhibition of proteasome activity, or a combination of these led to a mild increase in Hsp70 recruitment into the Parkin or Glup immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3E, lanes 3-6 and 15-18 in the 3rd row) and led to an increase in Parkin-Glup binding (Fig. 3E, lanes 3-6 and 15-18 in the 2nd row). As reported previously, Parkinimmunoprecipitated complex contained a U box protein CHIP and an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident Hsp40 Hdj-2 (Fig. 3E, the 4th and 5th row). CHIP was constitutively present in the Glup immunoprecipitate even in the absence of Parkin (Fig. 3E, 4th row). However, Hsp70 overexpression or proteasome inhibition only slightly promoted the association of CHIP with Glup. In contrast, Hdj-2 was recruited to Glup only during proteasome inhibition with MG-132 or lactacystin (Fig. 3E, lanes 15, 16, and 18 in the 5th row). VCP, which is an AAAATPase family molecule involved in the organization of cellular membranes and ER-associated degradation, was detected in both Parkin and Glup immunoprecipitates only upon proteasome inhibition (Fig. 3E, the 6th row). Binding of VCP to Glup was stronger than to Parkin. Glup binding-chaperones such as Hsp90, TCP1α, and TCP1β seemed to be constantly associated with Glup and very weakly with Parkin during these treatments (Fig. 3E, 7th to 9th rows). We next examined whether Pael-R was able to associate with Glup in the presence or absence of Hsp70 or TCP1β overexpression (Fig. 4A). Unlike Parkin, Pael-R was hardly associated with TCP1β, as shown in Fig. 1B. Interaction between Glup and Pael-R, similar to that between Glup and Parkin, was promoted by Hsp70, but not by TCP1β, and was dramatically strengthened by the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (Fig. 4B). Thus, overexpression of Hsp70 and proteasome inhibition promoted interaction of Parkin and Pael-R with Glup probably because the up-regulated Hsp70 facilitates direct binding of Parkin and Pael-R to Glup and because some of the Hsp70 bound to Parkin and Pael-R will recruit Glup. In contrast, the marked increase in Glup binding to Pael-R after proteasome inhibition did not appear only due to Hsp70 up-regulation. Glup Is a Component of Lewy Bodies—Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that inhibition of proteasome activity effectively led to recruitment of Glup to Parkin and particularly to Pael-R. To explore the mechanism underlying the effect of proteasome inhibition, immunocytochemical analysis was performed in the presence or absence of a proteasome inhibitor. Glup is normally associated with vesicles and sometimes shows filamentous structures within the cytosol and neurites of primary cultured neurons (Fig. 5A) and neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells (data not shown). We have reported that Pael-R forms aggresome-like inclusions in the perinuclear region of cells overexpressing Pael-R in the presence of MG-132 (13Imai Y. Soda M. Inoue H. Hattori N. Mizuno Y. Takahashi R. Cell. 2001; 105: 891-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, when Glup was co-expressed together with Pael-R, Glup was co-localized with the perinuclear inclusion of Pael-R (Fig. 5B). The cellular localization of Glup showed a basically punctate pattern in the cells and largely overlapped with TCP1β and partially overlapped with Hsp70, Parkin, and CHIP under physiological conditions (Fig. 5, C-E and H, left columns). Although the binding of Hdj-2 and VCP to Glup was not detected in the immunoprecipitation analysis, partial colocalization of these molecules was observed, suggesting that VCP and Hdj-2 transiently associated with Glup in cells (Fig. 5, F and G, left columns). On the other hand, when cells expressing Pael-R were treated with MG-132, they formed Pael-R-positive inclusions, the cores of which contained Parkin, Hsp70, CHIP and Hdj-2 (Fig. 5, C-F, middle and right columns). In contrast, VCP accumulated in the periphery of the inclusions rather than in the central regions (Fig. 5G, middle and right columns). TCP1β was either not recruited into the inclusion (Fig. 5H, upper part in the middle and right columns) or overlapped more scarcely (Fig. 5H, lower part in the middle and right columns). The specificity of the antibodies used in the immunocytochemical experiments was confirmed by immunoabsorption with the antigen (Fig. 5I). These results seemed to explain the results of the immunoprecipitation assay shown in Fig. 4E.Fig. 5Glup is recruited into Pael-R inclusions.A, primary cultured neurons from the mouse midbrain were stained with anti-Glup Ab (green) and counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (blue) to visualize the nucleus.

B, neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells transfected with Venus (an improved version of yellow fluorescent protein)-fusioned Glup and monomeric red fluorescence protein-fusioned Pael-R were treated with 10 μm MG-132 for 12 h after 20 h post-transfection (30Nagai T.

Arrowheads indicate a Pael-R-immunopositive inclusion. I, a, SH-SY5Y cells treated with MG-132 after transfection with Pael-R as in B-H were stained with anti-Pael-R Ab (blue), together with anti-Glup Ab solution preabsorbed with FLAG-Glup purified from 293/FLAG-Glup cells. The Glup signals (green) in both the Pael-R inclusions (arrowheads) and the cytosol almost disappeared. A similar result was obtained by the anti-Pael-R preabsorption (data not shown). b-f, SH-SY5Y cells treated as above were stained with anti-Pael-R (blue) and anti-Glup (green) Abs together with anti-Parkin (b), anti-Hsp70 (c), anti-VCP (d), anti-Hdj-2 (e), or anti-TCP1β (f) Ab solution preabsorbed with the antigens (red). The disappearance of the signals of these Abs after preabsorption indicated the specificity of these Abs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The presence of Glup in the Pael-R-positive inclusions led us to examine whether Glup is a component of LBs (Fig. 6). Anti-Glup Ab strongly recognized the LBs in cases with sporadic PD and dementia with LBs (Fig. 6, A-C). In contrast, incubation with Ab solution preabsorbed against FLAG-Glup purified from 293/FLAG-Glup cells (preabsorbed) did not show any signals in the brain sections, indicating that the anti-Glup Ab specifically recognizes Glup protein (Fig. 6D).

Med. 2001; 7: 1144-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that Hsp70 and Parkin are components of LB or cellular inclusions. Therefore, Hsp70 or Parkin may recruit Glup into these inclusions. To examine this possibility, FLAG-Glup, immunoprecipitated from 293/FLAG-Glup cells treated with or without MG-132, was subjected to a gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 7A). The result revealed that part of Glup was >1 MDa of the high molecular mass in the presence of MG-132 (Fig. 7A, fractions 1-8). The amounts of co-immunoprecipitated Parkin and Hsp70 were increased in the presence of MG-132, as shown in Fig. 3E. Moreover, MG-132 treatment also promoted the recruitment of Parkin and Hsp70, but not TCP1α or -β, to the high molecular weight fractions. Consistent with the gel filtration experiment, an immunocytochemical analysis showed that the subcellular localization of both overexpressed and endogenous Glup were dramatically changed by MG-132 treatment, which led Glup into γ-tubulin-positive large inclusions, so-called aggresomes (Fig. 7, C and F compared with B, and data not shown). In contrast, Hsp70 and TCP1β did not show any cytoplasmic aggregates in the presence of MG-132, even when overexpressed in SH-SY5Y, Neuro2A, and 293/FLAG-Glup cells (Fig. 7, E and H, and data not shown). A previous study reported that overexpressed Parkin forms aggresomes upon proteasome inhibition in COS-7 cells (23Junn E. Lee S.S. Suhr U.T. Mouradian M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47870-47877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We also observed that both overexpressed and endogenous Parkin were recruited into γ-tubulin-positive inclusions in MG-132-treated SH-SY5Y (Fig. 7, D and G) and Neuro2A cells (data not shown). However, the aggresome-forming efficiencies of both overexpressed and endogenous Glup were much higher than that of Parkin (Fig. 7H). Moreover, transient co-expression of Glup with Parkin-Myc or His-Hsp70 in the presence of MG-132 facilitated the aggresome formation of Parkin-Myc or His-Hsp70 in SH-SY5Y (Fig. 7I) and Neuro2A cells (data not shown). Taken together, our results indicated that Glup rather recruits Parkin or Hsp70 into cytoplasmic aggregates than otherwise, suggesting that Glup may be one of cytoplasmic aggregate-promoting factors. Glup Suppresses Pael-R-induced Cell Death, Promoting Cytoplasmic Inclusions—We predicted that Glup might protect neuronal cells against cell death induced by unfolded Pael-R protein stress, because Glup forms a large complex containing molecular chaperones. We first examined the effect of Glup on Pael-R overexpression in SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 8A). As reported previously, co-expression of Parkin and Pael-R suppressed the formation of Triton X-100-insoluble Pael-R-immunoreactive material, which represents unfolded and insolubilized Pael-R, whereas inhibition of proteasomal activity through treatment with MG-132 enhanced the accumulation of Pael-R-immunoreactive material within the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction (13Imai Y. Soda M. Inoue H. Hattori N. Mizuno Y. Takahashi R. Cell. 2001; 105: 891-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). Co-expression of Glup and Pael-R had a slight but significant inhibitory effect on the accumulation of insoluble Pael-R, and the addition of Parkin expression had an additive inhibitory effect. Under these conditions, we performed a cell death assay by Pael-R overexpression (Fig. 8B). Transfection of Pael-R led to the death of the transfected cells, and treatment with MG-132 during Pael-R expression caused a dramatic increase in cell death. Co-expression of Parkin suppressed cell death by ∼50%. Transfection of Glup also suppressed cell death to the same extent, although Glup only weakly inhibited the accumulation of unfolded Pael-R. Co-expression of Parkin and Glup with Pael-R effectively suppressed cell death by ∼70%. PC12 cells expressing Pael-R-EGFP in an inducible manner undergo cell death when Pael-R-EGFP protein expression is induced (15Imai Y. Soda M. Hatakeyama S. Akagi T. Hashikawa T. Nakayama K.I. Takahashi R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Thus, we performed a cell survival assay by transient co-transfection of these cells with various cDNAs, including some encoding anti-apoptotic factors (Fig. 8C). The ER chaperone, BiP, offers significant protection against Pael-R-EGFP-induced cell death. Parkin, Hsp70, and CHIP also suppress cell death following induction of Pael-R-EGFP, as reported previously (15Imai Y. Soda M. Hatakeyama S. Akagi T. Hashikawa T. Nakayama K.I. Takahashi R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Moreover, Glup effectively suppressed Pael-R-induced cell death in the present experiment. In contrast, various caspase inhibitory proteins, including XIAP, c-IAP1, c-IAP-2, and p35, did not significantly protect against cell death, suggesting that unfolded Pael-R-induced cell death is not a typical apoptosis process but a caspase-independent process. Similar results were obtained in cell survival assays using Pael-R-transfected differentiated Neuro2A cells (data not shown). To examine further the function of Glup in cells, we used RNA interference (RNAi). Western blotting showed that human (SH-SY5Y) and mouse (Neuro2A) Glup proteins were specifically reduced after transfection of the plasmids for Glup RNAi (clone h4 for human and clones m4 and m5 for mouse Glup). The efficiencies of these decreases using h4, m4, and m5 were ∼85, 95, and 90%, respectively, whereas Parkin levels were not significantly affected (Fig. 9A). Next, we examined the effect of Glup knockdown or overexpression on Pael-R-induced cell death in the presence or absence of MG-132 (Fig. 9B). SH-SY5Y or Neuro2A cells were transfected with Pael-R plasmid together with or without plasmid encoding Glup or Glup RNAi in the presence or absence of MG-132. MG-132 treatment after Glup co-transfection promoted the formation of the Pael-R inclusions during the time in which these cells demonstrated firm adhesion to the culture dish, with the neurites and the integrity of their cytoplasmic membranes being maintained, suggesting that these cells remained healthy even when harboring the inclusions (Fig. 9, B and C). Glup knockdown by RNAi in association with MG-132 led to cell death with abnormal vacuolization of cytoplasm without obvious inclusions (Fig. 9D). The morphology of the cell death induced by Glup knockdown was quite distinct from that induced by Pael-R overexpression, which contained a large perinuclear inclusion in the cell (Fig. 9D, box). These effects were well correlated with the RNAi efficiency of each clone. Moreover, Glup overexpression partially abrogated the effect of Glup RNAi. These observations implied that the formation of cytoplasmic inclusions by Glup ensures the prevention of the cell death induced by unfolded proteins, at least in the short term. glup (alternatively called HAK005771 or PACRG) has been identified as a gene that lies in close proximity to the parkin gene responsible for juvenile Parkinson's disease (11Asakawa S. Tsunematsu K. Takayanagi A. Sasaki T. Shimizu A. Shintani A. Kawasaki K. Mungall A.J. Beck S. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 24West A. Farrer M. Petrucelli L. Cookson M. Lockhart P. Hardy J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 1146-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The glup and parkin genes are arranged in a head-to-head orientation with a 200-bp sequence between them. This configuration suggests that the two genes might share a bi-directional promoter. Previous analyses of promoter activity using the reporter genes indicate that these genes are indeed co-regulated at the transcriptional level (12West A.B. Lockhart P.J. O'Farell C. Farrer M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Unlike Parkin, however, Glup protein expression appears largely restricted to the central nervous system, indicating that glup is also regulated at a post-translational level (data not shown). In the central nervous system, a number of neuronal populations, including dopaminergic neurons, are Glup-immunoreactive in the neuronal fibers as well as in the neuronal bodies. These observations suggest that Glup is important for maintenance of neuronal function. Although the physiological significance of the observed interaction between Glup and Parkin remains unclear, an increase in the amount of Hsp70 in Parkin complex led to an increase in Glup, suggesting that Hsp70 may mediate the binding between Glup and Parkin. Glup failed to promote the ubiquitin ligase activity of Parkin or the degradation of Pael-R in vitro (data not shown). However, overexpression of Glup was observed to suppress cell death induced by overexpressed Pael-R in various neuronal cell lines. This protective effect of Glup appeared to be similar to that of Hsp70, because overexpression of Glup increased the amount of soluble fraction of Pael-R (see Fig. 4A). Furthermore, the binding property of Glup to TCP1 chaperonin components appears to be stable and strong in the presence of ATP, although the possibility that Glup is just a substrate of Hsp70 or Hsp90 cannot be formally excluded. Given that Glup is a positive co-factor of molecular chaperones, it is consistent with the observations that Glup 1) slightly suppresses insolubilization of Pael-R, 2) inhibits cell death by unfolded Pael-R, and 3) is a component of LBs or the cytoplasmic inclusions, as well as Hsp70. Thus, it is an interesting possibility that Glup is a nervous system-specific cofactor of chaperonin or a link molecule of chaperonin to other chaperones containing Hsp70 and Hsp90 in the central nervous system. The seeds of LBs are believed to be an aberrant fibrillization of α-SYN, which is a major component of LBs. Although we failed to detect the physical interaction between α-SYN and Glup (data not shown), there are a growing number of reports showing LBs sequester protein-folding machineries and molecules involved in the protein degradation. In many experiments using cultured cells, as well as in this study, it is suggested that the disturbance of proteasome activity during overexpression of certain proteins leads to the formation of the unfolded protein inclusion such as aggresomes. These cytoplasmic or nuclear inclusions are also reported to sequester molecular chaperones, transcription factor complexes, and ubiquitin-proteasome-related molecules, which might lead to impairment of cellular activity and survival (25Shimohata T. Nakajima T. Yamada M. Uchida C. Onodera O. Naruse S. Kimura T. Koide R. Nozaki K. Sano Y. Ishiguro H. Sakoe K. Ooshima T. Sato A. Ikeuchi T. Oyake M. Sato T. Aoyagi Y. Hozumi I. Nagatsu T.

Science. 2001; 292: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar). These observations in cultured cells are likely to, at least in part, reflect the formation of LBs in dopaminergic neurons of PD patients, in which the failure of the ubiquitin-proteasome system is implicated as the primary cause, and a long term maturation process will be required to convert the amorphous aggregates into LBs consisting of 10-nm amyloid fibrils (20McNaught K.S. Shashidharan P. Perl D.P. Jenner P. Olanow C.W. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 16: 2136-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the promotion of the formation of Pael-R inclusion by Glup seems to have a positive correlation with the protective function of Glup against cell death by Pael-R overexpression. This observation might support the notion that intermediates of unfolded proteins are more toxic than filamentous LBs or cytoplasmic inclusions (27Goldberg M.S. Lansbury P.T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E115-E119Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). According to our hypothesis, Glup aggregation might absorb the toxic intermediates, recruiting molecular chaperones and protein degradation machineries. Because it was reported that Hsp70 in aggregation is functionally mobile, the Glup aggregation containing Hsp70 and Parkin may deal with the cytotoxic intermediates by breaking them down or turning them into harmless molecules (28Kim S. Nollen E.A. Kitagawa K. Bindokas V.P. Morimoto R.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 826-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The mechanism of Glup aggregation by proteasome inhibition remains to be elucidated. This remarkable phenomenon cannot be explained simply by an increase in cellular Glup protein levels due to its increased stability, because Hsp70 co-expression, which did not lead to Glup aggregation (data not shown), also increased the total amount of cellular Glup and promoted Hsp70 or Parkin binding to Glup (Fig. 3E). Glup seems to be associated with cytoplasmic vesicles (Fig. 5A) and was able to bind directly to certain lipids (data not shown), suggesting that Glup preferentially binds to hydrophobic molecules. This characteristic is similar to that of α-synclein (29Sharon R. Goldberg M.S. Bar-Josef I. Betensky R.A. Shen J. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9110-9115Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). There might be a common mechanism in aggregation of lipid-binding proteins upon proteasomal inhibition. In conclusion, Glup, a gene product adjacent to the parkin gene, attenuated cell death by Pael-R overexpression, facilitating the formation of cytoplasmic inclusions that appears to be cell-protective, at least in the short term. Thus, Glup could serve as a cell death inhibitor for degenerating neurons in PD or in related neurodegenerative disorders. We thank Y. Suzuki for the constructs EGFP RNAi and TCP1β-Myc and M.

The interaction engages the PIKfyve chaperonin domain and four out of the six C-terminally positioned kelch repeats in p40.

Next, newly synthesized acid hydrolases that function in lysosomes are diverted from the secretory pathway through binding to one of the two mannose 6-phosphate-receptor (MPR) types, and reach MVBs by the biosynthetic pathway. Finally, several transport routes that deliver cargo to the trans-Golgi network emanate from MVBs. To dispatch cargo in the correct direction, MVBs ought to perform numerous sorting functions, the molecular mechanisms of which are just beginning to be unraveled. PIKfyve enzyme, a large protein of 2052 amino acids, is one of the multiple molecules thought important in MVB morphogenesis and function (9Ikonomov O.C. Sbrissa A. Foti M. Carpentier J.-L. Shisheva A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4581-4591Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Encoded by a single-copy evolutionarily conserved gene on locus 2q34 in humans, mammalian PIKfyve is responsible for intracellular PtdIns 5-P and PtdIns 3,5-P2 biosynthesis (reviewed in Ref. 10Shisheva A. Cell Biol. Internat. 2001; 25: 1201-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). PIKfyve could also act as a protein kinase, but the physiologically relevant substrates are currently unknown (11Sbrissa A. Ikonomov O.C. Shisheva A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15980-15989Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The enzyme is primarily cytosolic with ∼30% associated with membranes (12Shisheva A. Rusin B. Ikonomov O.C. DeMarco C. Sbrissa D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11859-11869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence microscopy data co-localize a subset of membrane-bound PIKfyve with late-endosome markers consistent with a plausible role of PIKfyve in the function of this compartment. The first indication for such a role came from cell studies utilizing PIKfyve point mutants deficient in the lipid kinase activity (13Ikonomov O.C. Sbrissa D. Shisheva A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26141-26147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 14Ikonomov O.C. Sbrissa D. Mlak M. Kanzaki M. Pessin J. Shisheva A. J. Biol.

Expression of these mutants in different cell types was found to induce a dramatic dominant-negative effect in the form of a progressive accumulation of dilated cytoplasmic vacuoles of endocytic origin indicating the role of PIKfyve in maintaining endosome membrane homeostasis. Recent ultrastructural studies identify the swollen compartment as MVBs, which, in addition to a significant gain of limiting membranes, display a lower number of internal vesicles (9Ikonomov O.C. Sbrissa A. Foti M. Carpentier J.-L. Shisheva A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4581-4591Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of active PIKfyve at higher levels or cytoplasmic microinjection of the PIKfyve lipid product, PtdIns 3,5-P2, restores the normal cell morphology (13Ikonomov O.C. Sbrissa D.

Together, these results specify the important role of PIKfyve PtdIns 3,5-P2-generating activity and yet-to-be identified PtdIns 3,5-P2 downstream effectors in MVB biogenesis and function. multivesicular body phosphatidylinositol chaperonin phosphate bisphosphate glutathione S-transferase glutathione trans-Golgi network enhanced green fluorescent protein mannose 6-phosphate receptor high speed pellet low speed pellet insulin-regulated aminopeptidase nucleotide(s) cytomegalovirus hemagglutinin. Besides the C-terminally positioned catalytic domain, the PIKfyve molecule harbors three other evolutionarily conserved modules: a FYVE finger that interacts specifically with PtdIns 3-P, a DEP domain, found in other proteins important in membrane association, and a chaperonin domain, homologous to the TCP-1 complex that associates with and facilitates the folding of newly synthesized actin and tubulin (10Shisheva A. Cell Biol. Internat. 2001; 25: 1201-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). While the FYVE finger domain was found to function as a major determinant for the PtdIns 3-P-dependent PIKfyve localization to late endosome membranes (15Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O.C. Shisheva A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6073-6079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), the significance of the other two conserved domains in PIKfyve function is still unknown. With the premise that the latter two domains serve to interact with yet-to-be identified proteins relevant to the role of PIKfyve in maintaining MVB morphology and function, we have initiated yeast two-hybrid screens using the individual chaperonin and DEP domains as baits. Here we report the identification of p40 transport factor as a binding protein for the PIKfyve chaperonin domain. p40 has been discovered previously in a search for proteins interacting with Rab9, a GTPase localized on late endosomes and facilitating late endosome-to-Golgi transport of MPR (16Diaz E. Schimmöller F. Pfeffer S.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Through selective binding to the GTP-loaded Rab9, p40 promotes the in vitro transport of MPR from late endosomes to TGN (16Diaz E. Schimmöller F. Pfeffer S.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Because anti-p40 antibodies, but not the p40-depleted cytosols, inhibit this transport step, Pfeffer and collaborators (16Diaz E. Schimmöller F. Pfeffer S.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) suggest the membrane-associated p40 is the active species that, together with the active Rab9, functions in the return of MPR to TGN. Here we demonstrate that PIKfyve chaperonin domain associates with p40 and that p40 membrane association is strictly dependent on PIKfyve enzymatic activity. Because p40 was found to be an in vitro substrate for the PIKfyve protein kinase activity, we speculate that p40-PIKfyve interaction and the subsequent PIKfyve-catalyzed p40 phosphorylation anchors p40 to discrete membranes facilitating late endosome-to-TGN transport. Cell Cultures—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 or COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics as described previously (13Ikonomov O.C.

The generation and maintenance of stably transfected doxycycline-inducible HEK293 cell lines expressing PIKfyveWT (clone 9), the dominant-negative kinase-deficient PIKfyveK1831E mutant (clone 5), or the control cell (TetOn) line were described elsewhere (17Ikonomov O.C.

Ikonomov O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 20Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O.C. Shisheva A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21589-21597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-GFP and anti-phosphoserine-specific (1C8) antibodies were from Clontech and Calbiochem, respectively. The polyclonal antibodies were from the following sources: anti-HA and anti-GST, gifts by Mike Czech; anti-p40, a gift by Susan Pfeffer; and anti-IRAP, a gift by Paul Pilch. Plasmids for Yeast Two-hybrid System—Three baits encompassing the evolutionarily conserved domains of the PIKfyve protein were inserted in-frame with the LexA into pNLexNLS for yeast two-hybrid screening. The first one constituted the FYVE finger plus the DEP domain of PIKfyve (residues 99-473) and was generated by subcloning the EcoRI fragment of the pGEX-1-PIKfyveL (99-473) vector into the EcoRI digest of pNLexNLS. The second bait corresponded to the DEP domain consensus sequence in PIKfyve (residues 384-445) and was generated by PCR (sense primer 5′-CCCGGAATTCGATCACCGTTAC and antisense primer 5′-CCCGGGATCCTTACAACGCATATTC) designed with the appropriate restriction sites for subcloning into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of pNLexNLS. The third construct encompassed the chaperonin-like (Ch) domain consensus sequence in PIKfyve (residues 616-868) and was generated by two consecutive subclonings into pGEX-3X and pNLexNSL vectors. Specifically, first, the 2-kbp EcoRV fragment (nucleotides 1983-3919) released from pBluescript II SK(+)PIKfyveWT cDNA was blunt-ligated into the SmaI site of pGEX-3X. After confirmation of the correct orientation, the BamHI fragment (0.76 kbp) of the above vector was released and subcloned into the BamHI-digested pNLexNLS. The correct organization and sequence of all constructs were confirmed by restriction endonuclease digestion and DNA sequencing. Other Constructs—Generation of pCMV5-HA-PIKfyveSWT and pCMV5-HA-PIKfyveSΔ560-12231 was described elsewhere (20Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O.C. Shisheva A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21589-21597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Recombinant adenoviruses, expressing HA-PIKfyveSWT were produced as described elsewhere (13Ikonomov O.C. Sbrissa D. Shisheva A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26141-26147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Full-length human p40 was generated in BglII/HindIII restriction sites of pEGFP-C2 (Clontech) using pQE31-p40 cDNA (a kind gift by Dr. Susan Pfeffer) and the following strategy. First, the N-terminal DNA fragment (from the ATG initiation codon up to the HindIII site) was obtained by PCR using BglII-flanked sense primer (5-CGCAGATCTCCATGAAGCCAAC), HindIII-flanked antisense primer (5′-GAGAAGCTTCTGTTTGG) and pQE31-p40 cDNA as a template. The PCR product (∼180 bp) was digested with BglII/HindIII and then ligated together with the HindIII fragment of pQE31-p40 (∼1 kbp) into BglII/HindIII-digested pEGFP-C2. The PCR-amplified sequence and the correct orientation of the construct were verified by sequencing and restriction endonuclease mapping. Full-length p40 fused in-frame with GST was generated by first amplifying the coding sequence of p40 by PCR using primers with added EcoRI or XhoI restriction sites: sense 5′-CGGCGAATTCATGAAGCAAC-3′ and antisense 5′-CAGCCTCGAGTTAGTCCACTAC-3′, with the restriction sites underlined. The PCR product was digested with HindIII, and the resulting two fragments of 180 bp (nt 150-329 of p40 sequence GI:5032014) and 968 bp (nt 329-1297) were subsequently cut with EcoRI and XhoI, respectively, and ligated into the EcoRI/XhoI digest of pGEX5X-1 (Amersham Biosciences). Two C-terminal GST fusion peptides, residues 133-372, and 264-372, were also generated in pGEX5X-1 vector. For the first C-terminal peptide, the EcoRI/XhoI fragment (encompassing nt 546-1297) derived from clone YA#19 (isolated in the two-hybrid screen here, see below) was inserted into the corresponding digest of pGEX5X-1. For the second one, the PstI/SalI fragment (encompassing nt 941-1297) from pEGFP-p40 was subcloned initially into the corresponding digest of pBluescript II SK+ and then released by SmaI/XhoI digest for subcloning into SmaI/XhoI sites of pGEX5X-1. An N-terminal GST fusion peptide of p40 (residues 1-264) was generated by first subcloning the BglII/PstI fragment of pEGFP-p40 (nt 150-941) into pCMV5. The EcoRI/SalI fragment of the pCMV5-p40 construct was then ligated into EcoRI/SalI digest of pGEX4T-2 (Amersham Biosciences). The organization of the constructs was confirmed by restriction endonuclease digest and sequencing. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—Interaction mating version of two-hybrid screen was performed following already published procedures (21Kolonin M.G. Zhong J. Finley Jr., R.L. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 26-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the bait cDNA in pNLex (NLS) vector was transformed in RFY 309 (MATa) strain. The suitability of the bait was determined by interaction mating of the transformed MATa with a MATα strain (RFY231) pretransformed with human HeLa cell cDNA library (22Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chetkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar) or only with the empty library vector pJG4-5. The positives for interaction, as a result of the activation of the LEU2 reporter gene, showed galactose-dependent growth on plates without leucine. Due to its low background, i.e. low activation of the LEU2 reporter by itself, the PIKfyve-chaperonin (PIKfyve-Ch) domain bait was selected for further screening. To avoid the characterization of repetitive cDNA isolates, candidate clones were amplified by PCR using primers based on the sequence adjacent to the multiple cloning site of pJG4-5. The PCR products were digested with HaeIII, and the restriction patterns were compared after agarose gel separation. The candidates with different patterns were further studied by cross-mating assay with PIKfyve-Ch bait and several unrelated baits. The clones confirmed as true positives, i.e. selectively interacting with the PIKfyve-Ch bait and being dependent on galactose but not glucose for growth without leucine, were further characterized by sequencing. GST Protein Production and Purification—All GST fusion proteins were produced in transformed XA-90 Escherichia coli strain. Bacteria were grown for 1.5 h and then stimulated with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for an additional 6 h. The cells were lysed with 1 mg/ml lysozyme in a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell lysates were treated with DNase (0.1 mg/ml) in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2. Purification of the GST fusion proteins was achieved on GSH-agarose beads (Sigma) as described previously (15Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O.C. Shisheva A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6073-6079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In some experiments, the GST proteins were eluted from the beads and dialyzed against 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. The concentration and quality of the purified proteins, bound to or eluted from the beads, were determined electrophoretically by the intensity of the Coomassie Blue-stained protein bands versus bovine serum albumin standard (Pierce). Transient Co-transfection and Subcellular Fractionation—HEK293 cell stable lines inducibly expressing PIKfyveWT of PIKfyveK1831E, seeded at 750,000 cells/100-mm plates were co-transfected with pEGFP-p40 cDNA using LipofectAMINE as a transfection reagent. 24-40 h post-transfection, cells were rinsed in homogenization “HES++ buffer” (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, supplemented with 1× protease inhibitor mixture (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm benzamidine) and 1× phosphatase inhibitor mixture (25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, and 2 mm NaVO3) at room temperature and then scraped in the same buffer at 4 °C. Cells were then homogenized in a motor-driven Teflon/glass homogenizer with 15 strokes at 1700 rpm. Homogenates were subjected to subcellular fractionation following published protocols established for 3T3-L1 adipocytes (12Shisheva A. Rusin B. Ikonomov O.C. DeMarco C. Sbrissa D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11859-11869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, homogenates were first centrifuged at 9,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C (Sorval Instrument Division, SS-34 rotor) to obtain the low speed pellet (LSP). The supernatant was then centrifuged in a TLA 100.3 rotor (Beckman Instruments Inc.) at 4 °C for 24 min at 200,000 × g to separate the high speed pellet (HSP) from the fraction of the soluble proteins (referred to herein as cytosol). Pellets were resuspended in “HES++ buffer” to a protein concentration of ∼2 mg/ml (bicinchoninic protein assay kit, Pierce, Rockford, IL). Fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. Cytosolic fractions were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA or anti-PIKfyve antibodies as described below. In some experiments cultured cells were fractionated into total membrane and cytosol. In this case, cells were homogenized as above and then fractionated by two sequential centrifugations at 800 × g for 3 min to eliminate the nuclear pellet and then at 200,000 × g for 20 min in a TLA 100.3 rotor, to obtain the total membrane and cytosolic fractions. Total membrane pellets were resuspended as above, and the fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting or immunoprecipitation. Equilibrium Centrifugation in Self-formed Iodixanol Gradient—A total membrane fraction prepared from HEK293 cell stable lines inducibly expressing PIKfyveWT and resuspended in “HES++ buffer” were mixed with iodixanol (OptiPrep; Sigma) in a polyallomer Quick-Seal centrifuge tube to 30% iodixanol and 128 mm sucrose concentration as described previously (12Shisheva A. Rusin B. Ikonomov O.C. DeMarco C. Sbrissa D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11859-11869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A self-generating gradient was performed by centrifugation to equilibrium for 4 h as specified previously (12Shisheva A. Rusin B. Ikonomov O.C. DeMarco C. Sbrissa D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11859-11869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Fractions (∼ 0.37 ml) were collected from the bottom of the tube and were analyzed for protein concentration and by immunoblotting with antibodies indicated in the legend to Fig. 6. GST Pull-down Assay—GST-p40, GST alone or the fusion peptides, GST-p40-(133-372), GST-p40-(264-372), and GST-p40-(1-264), each at 5 μg/tube, were immobilized and purified on GSH-agarose beads. Cytosols derived from COS-7 cells infected or non-infected with adenoviruses encoding PIKfyveWT, prepared as previously described (13Ikonomov O.C. Sbrissa D. Shisheva A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26141-26147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), were added and incubated with the beads for 18 h at 4 °C. Beads were then washed three times in a cytosol-washing buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture). Washed beads were then boiled in sample buffer, and the proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation—Immunoblotting with the indicated polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies was performed subsequent to protein separation by SDS-PAGE and electrotransfer onto nitrocellulose membranes as previously described (19Shisheva A. Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). A chemiluminescence kit (Pierce) was used to detect the horseradish-peroxidase-bound secondary antibodies. Protein levels on the blots were quantified with a laser densitometer (Molecular Dynamics) by area integration scanning. Several exposures of each blot were quantified to assure that the chemiluminescence exposures were within the linear range of the film. PIKfyve proteins were immunoprecipitated from radioimmune precipitation assay buffer lysates of COS-7 cells transiently transfected with indicated PIKfyve constructs or from lysates of HEK293 cells infected with adenovirus encoding HA-PIKfyveWT using anti-HA or anti-PIKfyve antibodies as described previously (11Sbrissa A. Ikonomov O.C. Shisheva A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15980-15989Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In some experiments PIKfyve proteins were immunoprecipitated from cytosols of a HEK293 cell line stably transfected with HA-PIKfyveWT. Control immunoprecipitates with preimmune serum or anti-HA immunoprecipitates from control non-transfected or non-infected cells were run in parallel. Immunoprecipitation was carried out for 16 h at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B added in the final 1.5 h of incubation. Immunoprecipitates were washed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer or cytosol-washing buffer plus 1× protease inhibitor mixture and then solubilized in sample buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblotting as described above. p40 in Vitro Phosphorylation—The ability of PIKfyve to phosphorylate p40 was tested in vitro using PIKfyve immunopurified from HEK293 cells infected with adenovirus encoding PIKfyveWT following a published protocol (11Sbrissa A. Ikonomov O.C. Shisheva A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15980-15989Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, anti-PIKfyve or preimmune precipitates, immobilized on protein A-Sepharose were washed three times in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer supplemented with 1× protease inhibitor mixture and then three times with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Washed beads were preincubated with the purified GST-p40 fusion protein or GST alone, each at 800 μg/ml for 10 min at 25 °C. The reaction was initiated by addition of the ATP/ion mix composed of [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi) 25 μm ATP, 5 mm MnCl2, and 25 mm MgCl2 in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and continued for 15 min at 25 °C. The supernatants were removed. The beads were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, supplemented with 50 mm NaF and 10 mm Na4P2O7, then boiled in sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and analyzed by autoradiography and immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. Liposome Binding Assay—A possible specific interaction of p40 with PtdIns 5-P and PtdIns 3,5-P2 was examined exactly as described previously (15Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O.C. Shisheva A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6073-6079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) using GST-p40 (5 μg) immobilized on GSH-agarose beads and PtdIns 5-P-enriched or PtdIns 3,5-P2-enriched liposomes. GST protein (5 μg) was used as a control. Identification of p40 as a PIKfyve-binding Protein by Yeast Two-hybrid Interaction—To identify proteins that interact with PIKfyve, we constructed the chaperonin domain (residues 616-868) and DEP domain (residues 384-445) of PIKfyve in pNLexNLS vector for screening a HeLa cell cDNA library. Initial tests, however, revealed that the DEP domain construct produced a high background. A similar high background was seen with a DEP domain bait expanded with some upstream sequence encompassing the N-terminally positioned FYVE finger (residues 99-473). Therefore, both baits containing the DEP domain were not used for further screening. Screening of 106 cDNA library transformants by the mating version of the yeast two-hybrid system (21Kolonin M.G. Zhong J. Finley Jr., R.L. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 26-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the chaperonin-like domain as a bait resulted in 27 clones as potential interactors. Four of these clones encoded the p40 transport factor. The remaining clones encoded three other proteins, which are under characterization and will be described elsewhere. Pull-down and Immunoprecipitation Experiments Confirm PIKfyve-p40 Interaction—All the p40 clones isolated from our screening lacked the initial N-terminal part of the full-length molecule. The latter was generated by PCR amplification of the N-terminal amino acid segment using the full-length human p40 (16Diaz E. Schimmöller F. Pfeffer S.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) as a template as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To confirm the interaction of p40 with PIKfyve, a GST-conjugated peptide corresponding to full-length human p40 was used in pull-down experiments. Western blot analysis, illustrated in Fig. 1A, reveals that a substantial fraction of the immunoreactive PIKfyveWT binds to GST-p40 following incubation of bacterially produced purified GST-p40 with cytosols derived from COS cells infected with adenovirus encoding HA-PIKfyveWT. Control pull-down experiments with GST protein immobilized on GSH beads or GSH beads alone showed undetectable immunoreactive bands with electrophoretic properties of HA-PIKfyve (Fig. 1A). The interaction of PIKfyveWT with p40 was further verified by co-immunoprecipitation experiments in a HEK293 stable cell line inducibly expressing HA-PIKfyveWT and transiently co-transfected with pEGFP-p40 cDNA (Fig. 1"
https://openalex.org/W2081133395,"HCF-1 is a transcriptional cofactor required for activation of herpes simplex virus immediate-early genes by VP16 as well as less clearly defined roles in cell proliferation, cytokinesis, and spliceosome formation. It is expressed as a large precursor that undergoes proteolysis to yield two subunits that remain stably associated. VP16 uses a degenerate 4-amino acid sequence, known as the HCF-binding motif, to bind to a six-bladed β-propeller domain at the N terminus of HCF-1. Functional HCF-binding motifs are also found in LZIP and Zhangfei, two cellular bZIP transcription factors of unknown function. Here we show that the HCF-binding motif occurs in a wide spectrum of DNA-binding proteins and transcriptional cofactors. Three well characterized examples were further analyzed for their ability to use HCF-1 as a coactivator. Krox20, a zinc finger transcription factor required for Schwann cell differentiation, and E2F4, a cell cycle regulator, showed a strong requirement for functional HCF-1 to activate transcription. In contrast, activation by estrogen receptor-α did not display HCF dependence. In Krox20, the HCF-binding motif lies within the N-terminal activation domain and mutation of this sequence diminishes both transactivation and association with the HCF-1 β-propeller. The activation domain in the C-terminal subunit of HCF-1 contributes to activation by Krox20, possibly through recruitment of p300. These results suggest that HCF-1 is recruited by many different classes of cellular transcription factors and is therefore likely to be required for a variety of cellular processes including cell cycle progression and development.

These results suggest that HCF-1 is recruited by many different classes of cellular transcription factors and is therefore likely to be required for a variety of cellular processes including cell cycle progression and development. HCF-1 (also known as C1 factor) is a heterodimeric nuclear protein composed of a family of polypeptides generated from a 2035-amino acid precursor by site-specific proteolysis (1Kristie T.M.

After cleavage of the precursor, the N- and C-terminal processing products remain as a stable complex through two matching sets of self-interaction domains (3Wilson A.C. Peterson M.G. Herr W.

HCF-1 is expressed and processed in most cell types and with the exception of unstimulated sensory neurons, is predominantly nuclear and tightly associated with chromatin (3Wilson A.C. Peterson M.G.

The N-terminal subunit includes a six-bladed β-propeller domain characteristic of proteins in the kelch superfamily and an adjacent basic region (9LaBoissière S. Walker S. O'Hare P. Mol. Cell.

The C-terminal subunit includes a transcriptional activation domain (HCF-1AD), a pair of degenerate fibronectin type III repeats, and a bipartite nuclear localization signal (4Wilson A.C. Boutros M.

The cellular functions of HCF-1 appear to be multifaceted and are still only partially understood. The most clearly established role is in regulation of viral and cellular transcription. This was first described in the context of the herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1The abbreviations used are: HSVherpes simplex virusHBMHCF-binding motifERαestrogen receptor αbFGF-2basic fibroblast growth factor 2ADactivation domainlucluciferaseWTwild type. transactivator VP16 (reviewed in Refs. 14O'Hare P.

HCF-1 is necessary for the recruitment of VP16 to HSV immediate-early gene promoters and for transcriptional activation by the assembled VP16-induced complex (13Luciano R.L. Wilson A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13403-13408Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition, both subunits of HCF-1 have been shown to interact with cellular transcriptional activators and repressors (7Lu R. Yang P. O'Hare P. Misra V. Mol. Cell.

Analysis of a temperature-sensitive hamster cell line (tsBN67) carrying a missense mutation in the HCF-1 β-propeller has revealed a role in cell cycle progression and cytokinesis (22Goto H.

Last, HCF-1 is incorporated into spliceosome complexes and may participate in mRNA splicing as well as transcription (24Ajuh P. Chusainow J. Ryder U. Lamond A.I.

The N-terminal β-propeller domain is central to most HCF-1 functions. The 380-amino acid domain encompasses six kelch (HCFKEL) repeats, which are predicted to form the six blades of the propeller structure. The domain is sufficient to bind VP16 and assemble a VP16-induced complex on DNA in association with the cellular POU protein Oct-1 (11Wilson A.C. Freiman R.N. Goto H. Nishimoto T. Herr W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6139-6146Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the HCF-1 protein encoded by the tsBN67 cell line, there is a missense mutation in the β-propeller that changes proline 134 to serine (11Wilson A.C. Freiman R.N. Goto H. Nishimoto T. Herr W. Mol.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 726-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). At the non-permissive temperature, HCF-1 is unable to support transactivation by VP16 and is released from the cellular chromatin (8Wysocka J. Reilly P.T. Herr W. Mol. Cell.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 726-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Yeast interaction screens using the β-propeller domain identified two ATF/cAMP-response element-binding protein-like basic leucine zipper proteins known as LZIP/Luman and Zhangfei (7Lu R. Yang P. O'Hare P. Misra V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5117-5126Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 16Freiman R.N. Herr W.

Sequence comparison with VP16 revealed a 4-amino acid sequence motif, termed the HCF-binding motif (HBM), that is used by all three proteins to recognize the HCF-1 β-propeller (16Freiman R.N. Herr W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3122-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 25Lu R. Yang P. Padmakumar S. Misra V. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6291-6297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This motif ((D/E)HXY) consists of an acidic residue (aspartic acid or glutamic acid) followed by an invariant histidine, any residue (X), and then an invariant tyrosine. The HBM is an integral part of the LZIP transactivation domain, and recruitment of HCF-1 is required for activation by LZIP (26Luciano R.L. Wilson A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10757-10762Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Recently, functional HBM sequences have been identified in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ-coactivator PGC-1β and a novel nuclear export factor termed HPIP (27Lin J. Puigserver P. Donovan J. Tarr P. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1645-1648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 28Mahajan S.S. Little M.M. Vazquez R. Wilson A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44292-44299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). As a starting point for study of defined cellular processes regulated by HCF-1, we searched the protein sequence data bases to identify known transcription factors that contain potential HBMs. Many candidates were identified in this way, and in several the HBM lies in a region of the protein already known to be involved in gene activation. Three candidates, Krox20 (also known as EGR2, NGF1-B), E2F4, and estrogen receptor α (ERα), representing well studied members of unrelated protein families, were selected for further analysis. Krox20 is a member of the Krüpple-like zinc finger protein family and plays a critical role in hindbrain development and myelination of the peripheral nervous system (29Nagarajan R. Svaren J. Le N. Araki T. Watson M. Milbrandt J. Neuron. 2001; 30: 355-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). E2F4 plays a key role in regulating the cell cycle as well as differentiation processes such as adipogenesis (30Trimarchi J.M. Lees J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). ERα is a steroid hormone receptor that stimulates gene expression in a ligand-dependent manner (31McDonnell D.P. Norris J.D. Science. 2002; 296: 1642-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). We found that transactivation by Krox20 and E2F4 but not ERα was dependent on the presence of functional HCF-1. Mutation of the HBM or deletion of the activation domain of HCF-1 significantly reduced the ability of Krox20 to stimulate transcription from a synthetic promoter composed of a GC-rich Krox20 binding site or a natural promoter from the human bFGF-2 gene. The results of these experiments suggest that HCF-1 plays multiple roles in the regulation of cellular transcription. In addition to ubiquitous processes such as promoting cell proliferation, HCF-1 is likely to be important for tissue-specific events including myelination by Schwann cells and development of the central nervous system. Data Base Analysis—The SWISS-PROT and Translated EMBL (TrEMBL) data bases were searched using ScanProSite, a web-based motif search tool provided by the Expert Protein Analysis System (ExPASy) 2us.expasy.org. proteomics server of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (32Gattiker A. Bienvenut W. Bairoch A. Gasteiger E. Proteomics. 2002; 10: 1435-1444Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Using the query “[DE]HxY,” searches were restricted to mammalian proteins and individual entry annotations were used to identify transcription factors. Expression Plasmids—The full-length murine Krox20 open reading frame was amplified by PCR from a cDNA clone provided by Dr. Jeffrey Milbrandt (Washington University, St. Louis, MO), and subcloned into the cytomegalovirus enhancer-driven mammalian expression vectors pCGT and pCGN, thereby adding N-terminal T7 and hemagglutinin-epitope tags (11Wilson A.C. Freiman R.N. Goto H. Nishimoto T. Herr W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6139-6146Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Note that the mouse Krox20 protein was used in these experiments. Mouse and human proteins are highly homologous (overall 89% identical and 95% similar), especially within the activation and DNA-binding domains. In addition, Krox20 sequences (full-length or the first 170 residues) were subcloned into pCGNGal4, creating a hemagglutinin-tagged fusion to the yeast Gal4 DNA-binding domain (residues 1 to 94). All PCR amplified fragments were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Alanine substitution mutagenesis of the Krox20 HBM (residues 162 to 165) was performed by QuikChange™ (Stratagene) and verified by DNA sequencing. A diagnostic PstI site was incorporated into the changes to identify mutants. The plasmid encoding Gal4-E2F4-(240-412) was kindly provided by Dr. David Johnson (University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX) (33Wang D. Russell J.L. Johnson D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3417-3424Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The Gal4-responsive luciferase reporter plasmid used in this study was p5xGal4-E1B-luc and contains five tandem Gal4-binding sites (CGGAGTACTGTCCTCCG) (34Sun P. Enslen H. Myung P.S. Maurer R.A.

For temperature shift experiments, tsBN67 cells were grown at 33.5 °C. After electroporation, the transfected cells were plated and allowed to recover at 33.5 °C for 2 h before transfer to 39.5 °C. Candidate HCF-binding Motifs Are Found in Many Cellular Transcription Factors—To identify cellular proteins that can interact with HCF-1, we searched the SWISS-PROT and EMBL protein data bases for sequences matching the HBM consensus ((D/E)HXY) using the web-based ScanProsite search tool. As anticipated, this short and degenerate motif was present in a large number of mammalian proteins of different functions and cellular localization. SWISS-PROT alone yielded more than 370 unique hits. Given the previously established role of HCF-1 in regulation of gene expression, and the predominantly nuclear localization of the protein, we focused on known or suspected DNA-binding proteins and transcriptional co-regulators (see Fig. 1 for a listing). As expected, the search identified previously known HBM-containing proteins. These include HSV VP16 and its homologues from related α-herpesviruses as well as the cellular proteins LZIP, Zhangfei, HPIP, and PGC-1α and -β (7Lu R. Yang P. O'Hare P. Misra V. Mol. Cell.

The sequences flanking the core motif show no obvious homology, although there is evidence that flanking sequences do influence HBM function (38Wu T.J. Monokian G. Mark D.F. Wobbe C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3484-3493Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In terms of the candidate HBM-containing proteins, we noted that in several examples, the HBM-like sequence is conserved in non-human counterparts and/or falls within a region of the protein known to contain an activation domain. A clear example is the Krox20/EGR2 protein (Fig. 2A). Orthologs from other vertebrates preserve the putative HBM, although in birds, fish, and amphibians the first position is changed from an aspartic acid to a glutamic acid. In fish and amphibians the variable third position is also changed from leucine to isoleucine that preserves the hydrophobic nature of the side group. The activation domain of Krox20 has been mapped to the N terminus of the protein (residues 1-184) and encompasses the HBM-like sequence (residues 162-165) (39Vesque C. Charnay P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2485-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This arrangement is strongly reminiscent of LZIP in which the N-terminal activation domain includes the HBM (26Luciano R.L. Wilson A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10757-10762Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Transcriptional Activation by Krox20 and E2F4 Is Temperature-sensitive in tsBN67 Cells—To determine whether any of these sequence matches represent functional HBMs, we selected three candidates, Krox20, E2F4, and ERα, and tested them for HCF dependence. Each activator was analyzed by transient transfection of tsBN67, a derivative of BHK21 that carries a temperature-sensitive version of HCF-1. At the permissive temperature of 33.5 °C, HCF-1 is functional and the cells proliferate normally, whereas at the non-permissive temperature (39.5 °C), the HCF-1 β-propeller domain is inactivated and the cells asynchronously arrest (11Wilson A.C. Freiman R.N. Goto H. Nishimoto T. Herr W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6139-6146Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 22Goto H. Motomura S. Wilson A.C. Freiman R.N. Nakabeppu Y. Fukushima K. Fujishima M. Herr W. Nishimoto T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 726-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Transactivation by Krox20 was examined in two contexts (Fig. 2, B and C). In the first (Fig. 2B), full-length Krox20 (Krox20FL) was cotransfected into tsBN67 cells together with a Krox20-responsive luciferase reporter (GC-luc) composed of two Krox20-binding sites (5′-GCGGGGGCG-3′) placed upstream of the prolactin core promoter. Pools of transfected cells were split into halves and incubated for 40 h at either the permissive or non-permissive temperature, and then assayed for luciferase activity. Expression of Krox20 gave a 7-fold stimulation at the permissive temperature but this was abolished when cells were cultured at 39.5 °C. The reporter alone showed a similar reduction reflecting the activity of low levels of endogenous Krox20 protein. The result of this experiment suggests that Krox20 requires HCF-1 to activate transcription. In the second approach (Fig. 2B), we tested an N-terminal fragment of Krox20 (residues 2-170) corresponding to the activation domain (39Vesque C. Charnay P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2485-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This fragment was fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Gal4DBD) and cotransfected with a luciferase reporter gene (5xGal4-E1B-luc) containing five Gal4-binding sites upstream of the adenovirus E1B TATA box. Gal4-Krox20N170 activated transcription 5-fold at the permissive temperature and this activation was reduced to only 2-fold at the non-permissive temperature. This result substantiates the temperature-dependent activation observed using full-length Krox20 and argues that HCF-1 contributes to transcriptional activation rather than recognition of the GC-rich Krox20-binding site. We also tested a C-terminal fragment from human E2F4 (residues 240-412) fused to the Gal4DBD (Gal4-E2F4-(240-412)) (Fig. 2D). This fragment includes the activation and pocket protein-binding domains but not the DNA-binding or dimerization domains (33Wang D. Russell J.L. Johnson D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3417-3424Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Expression of Gal4-E2F4-(240-412) at the permissive temperature increased transcription of the report by ∼8-fold and this was significantly reduced in cells maintained at the non-permissive temperature. In contrast to Krox20 and E2F4, activation by the full-length estrogen receptor (ERα) using a reporter linked to an estrogen response element showed little difference at the two temperatures (Fig. 2E). Under these conditions, ERα is activated by ligand present in the calf sera. Addition of the ligand estradiol (100 nm) to the culture media gave similar results (data not shown). These results indicate that not all of the activators containing HBM-like sequences require HCF-1 to activate transcription, thus highlighting the role of HCF-1 in specific programs of gene expression. Mutation of the HBM Prevents Transactivation by Krox20— To determine whether the HBM-like sequence in Krox20 contributes to activation domain function, we generated a substitution mutant (Krox20 HBMKO, Fig. 2A) simultaneously changing all four residues of the motif to alanine. HeLa cells were cotransfected with the wild type and mutant versions of full-length Krox20 together with the GC-luc reporter (Fig. 3A). Wild type Krox20 (WT) activated transcription 6-fold, whereas the mutant (HBMKO) activated transcription only 1.5-fold. This indicates that the HBM identified through a sequence data base search is an important component of the Krox20 activation domain. We also examined the consequence of overexpressing HCF-1 (Fig. 3B). HeLa cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding full-length Krox20 and HCF-1. Coexpression of both proteins resulted in a greater level of activation than with Krox20 alone. This stimulation was not observed when HCF-1 was expressed on its own. This suggests that HCF-1 can only contribute to activation when brought to the promoter via a DNA-binding protein such as Krox20. HCF-1 Is Required for Activation of the bFGF-2 Promoter— The bFGF-2 promoter (shown schematically in Fig. 3C) contains multiple GC-rich elements and at least two of these (boxes i and iii) have been shown to bind Krox20 (or the related Krox24/EGR1) protein in vitro, leading to promoter activation (36Biesiada E. Razandi M. Levine E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18576-18581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 40Svaren J. Sevetson B.R. Golda T. Stanton J.J. Swirnoff A.H. Milbrandt J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6010-6019Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To address the role of HCF-1 in regulation of the bFGF-2 promoter, we cotransfected 293T cells with increasing amounts of expression plasmids encoding wild type and HBMKO Krox20 together with the full-length bFGF-2 promoter driving the luciferase reporter gene (41Shibata F. Baird A. Florkiewicz R.Z. Growth Factors. 1991; 4: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The promoter was activated in a dose-dependent manner by wild type Krox20, but showed a significantly reduced response to Krox20 HBMKO (Fig. 3D). As shown in Fig. 3E, the experiment was repeated using 500 ng of each Krox20 expression plasmid and extracts were assayed for protein expression by immunoblotting with an antibody against the T7 epitope-tagged Krox20 proteins as well as for luciferase activity. Activation of the bFGF-2 promoter was significantly reduced with the HBMKO mutant compared with wild type, although there was little detectable difference in protein expression. These results show that mutation of the candidate HBM in Krox20 reduces its ability to activate transcription from a natural promoter. The HCF-1 β-Propeller Associates with the Activation Domain of Krox20—By analogy to VP16, LZIP, and HPIP, it is possible that the HCF-1 β-propeller alone is sufficient for recognition of the HBM in Krox20 (11Wilson A.C. Freiman R.N. Goto H. Nishimoto T. Herr W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6139-6146Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 16Freiman R.N. Herr W.

Chem. 2002; 277: 44292-44299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To date, we have been unable to detect a stable interaction between Krox20 and HCF-1 using gel mobility shift or in vitro coimmunoprecipitation assays, suggesting the interaction is weak or stabilized by other factors present in vivo (data not shown). Instead, we have used a mammalian one-hybrid recruitment assay in transfected 293T cells to characterize the interaction between the β-propeller of HCF-1 and Krox20. Gal4-HCF-1N380WT was co-expressed with Krox20FL and the Gal4-responsive reporter (Fig. 4A). The β-propeller of HCF-1 did not activate the reporter gene unless coexpressed with Krox20FL. The specificity of this interaction was verified using the tsBN67 version of the HCF-1 β-propeller. This is identical to wild type except that proline 134 has been changed to serine (P134S). Previous studies have shown that this single substitution is sufficient to prevent interaction with VP16 and LZIP (11Wilson A.C. Freiman R.N. Goto H. Nishimoto T. Herr W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6139-6146Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 16Freiman R.N. Herr W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3122-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 25Lu R. Yang P. Padmakumar S. Misra V. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6291-6297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, activation was not observed using the P134S mutant, indicating that recruitment of Krox20FL to the promoter was dependent on a functional β-propeller domain. To better define sequences in Krox20 required for this interaction, the recruitment assay was repeated using Krox20N170 in place of Krox20FL (Fig. 4B). Again Krox20N170 was able to activate the reporter in the presence of Gal4-HCF-1N380WT, but not the P134S mutant. This result shows that the Krox20 activation domain was sufficient for interaction with the HCF-1 β-propeller domain.

https://openalex.org/W2005816843,"Activator of G protein signaling 3 (AGS3) is a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) that contains four G protein regulatory (GPR) or GoLoco motifs in its C-terminal domain. The entire C-terminal domain (AGS3-C) as well as certain peptides corresponding to individual GPR motifs of AGS3 bound to Gαi1 and inhibited the binding of GTP by stabilizing the GDP-bound conformation of Gαi1. The stoichiometry, free energy, enthalpy, and dissociation constant for binding of AGS3-C to Gαi1 were determined using isothermal titration calorimetry. AGS3-C possesses two apparent high affinity (Kd ∼ 20 nm) and two apparent low affinity (Kd ∼ 300 nm) binding sites for Gαi1. Upon deletion of the C-terminal GPR motif from AGS3-C, the remaining sites were approximately equivalent with respect to their affinity (Kd ∼ 400 nm) for Gαi1. Peptides corresponding to each of the four GPR motifs of AGS3 (referred to as GPR1, GPR2, GPR3, and GPR4, respectively, going from N to C terminus) bound to Gαi1 with Kd values in the range of 1-8 μm. Although GPR1, GPR2, and GPR4 inhibited the binding of the fluorescent GTP analog BODIPY-FL-guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate to Gαi1, GPR3 did not. However, addition of N- and C-terminal flanking residues to the GPR3 GoLoco core increased its affinity for Gαi1 and conferred GDI activity similar to that of AGS3-C itself. Similar increases were observed for extended GPR2 and extended GPR1 peptides. Thus, while the tertiary structure of AGS3 may affect the affinity and activity of the GPR motifs contained within its sequence, residues outside of the GPR motifs strongly potentiate their binding and GDI activity toward Gαi1 even though the amino acid sequences of these residues are not conserved among the GPR repeats.

The α subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (Gα) act as molecular switches to modulate intracellular signaling pathways. In the classical G protein signaling cycle, agonist-bound G protein-coupled receptors catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP at the catalytic site of Gα. Thus activated, Gα subunits subsequently dissociate from the heterodimeric complex of Gβ and Gγ subunits (Gβγ) (1Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). GTP-bound Gα subunits modulate the activity of effector enzymes, including adenylyl cyclase, phospholipase Cβ, and nucleotide exchange factors for the small GTPase, Rho (2Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W.

Signaling is terminated by the intrinsic GTPase activity of Gα; upon hydrolysis of GTP, Gα·GDP reassociates with Gβγ to form the inactive heterotrimer. Several molecules can regulate the G protein reaction cycle by modulating the rate of GTP hydrolysis or nucleotide exchange. The most familiar of these are regulators of G protein signaling (RGSs), 1The abbreviations used are: RGSregulator of G protein signalingAGS3activator of G protein signaling 3AGS3-CC-terminal half (residues 465-650) of AGS3GDIguanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitorPINSpartner of inscuteableITCisothermal titration calorimetryGPRG protein regulatoryGPRexextended GPR peptideGSTglutathione S-transferaseGTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphatePcp2Purkinje cell protein-2GAPGTPase-activating proteinDTTdithiothreitol.1The abbreviations used are: RGSregulator of G protein signalingAGS3activator of G protein signaling 3AGS3-CC-terminal half (residues 465-650) of AGS3GDIguanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitorPINSpartner of inscuteableITCisothermal titration calorimetryGPRG protein regulatoryGPRexextended GPR peptideGSTglutathione S-transferaseGTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphatePcp2Purkinje cell protein-2GAPGTPase-activating proteinDTTdithiothreitol. which increase the GTPase activity of Gα subunits (5Ross E.M.

In recent years, a new class of regulators has been discovered, typified by activator of G protein signaling 3 (AGS3). Like Gβγ, AGS3 selectively binds to the GDP-bound form of Gα and acts as a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) (6De Vries L. Fischer T. Tronchere H. Brothers G.M. Strockbine B.

Because both PINS and AGS3 can activate Gβγ-mediated signaling in the absence of G protein-coupled receptor activation, it has been suggested that they serve as “receptor-independent activators” of G protein signaling (7Takesono A.

Mutagenic scanning experiments have revealed a conserved functional core within GPR repeats corresponding to the sequence FFXLLXXXXXXXMX(D/E)QR that is required for GDI activity (16Peterson Y.K. Hazard III, S. Graber S.G. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6767-6770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Experiments with chimeric constructs of Gαi1 and Gαs identified the switch regions and helical domain of Gα as GoLoco binding sites (25Natochin M. Gasimov K.G. Artemyev N.O. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The recently determined crystal structure of the complex between a peptide that contains the GoLoco motif of RGS14 and the GDP-bound form of Gαi1 reveals the structural basis of GDI activity and specificity (26Kimple R.J. Kimple M.E. Betts L. Sondek J. Siderovski D.P. Nature. 2002; 416: 878-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The GoLoco peptide reorganizes and stabilizes the switch regions of Gαi1, and the arginine residue located in the conserved Asp-Gln-Arg (DQR) triad of the GoLoco motif is inserted into the active site of Gαi1 and interacts with the β phosphate of GDP. Residues C-terminal to the GoLoco motif interact with non-conserved residues in the helical domain of Gαi1 and are therefore proposed to be determinants of specificity (26Kimple R.J. Kimple M.E. Betts L. Sondek J. Siderovski D.P. Nature. 2002; 416: 878-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar).Inasmuch as a single GoLoco/GPR motif can possess GDI activity, the biochemical advantage conferred by proteins such as AGS3, which possess multiple copies of GPR motifs in tandem repeats, is worthy of investigation. The presumption that each of the GPR motifs in AGS3 possesses GDI activity has received experimental support, suggesting that AGS3 and its homologs might serve as scaffolds for GDP-bound Gα subunits (12Bernard M.L. Peterson Y.K. Chung P. Jourdan J. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1585-1593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Although it is possible that each of the four GPR motifs in AGS3 can bind one molecule of Gαi1, the actual stoichiometry of the complex has not been determined. It has been observed that an AGS3 construct containing only two GPR repeats is substantially less potent than one containing all four (14Natochin M. Lester B. Peterson Y.K. Bernard M.L. Lanier S.M. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40981-40985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Therefore, GPR motifs might function cooperatively, for example, by adopting a more stable tertiary structure in the context of AGS3 than would individual GPR motifs in isolation. It is also possible that the GPR repeats within AGS3 differ in their Gα specificity, affinity, or GDI activity.To address these questions, we used isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to determine the stoichiometry and thermodynamic parameters associated with binding of Gαi1·GDP to AGS3-C and constructs of AGS3-C from which one or more GPR repeats had been deleted. In a complementary series of experiments, we measured the affinity and GDI activity of peptides derived from each of the GPR repeats of AGS3 to establish a correlation between affinity and biological activity. These experiments provided direct insight into the thermodynamic basis for the GDI activity of AGS3 and the relationship between activity and binding affinity.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents—Peptides that correspond in amino acid sequence to the GPR motifs 1-4 (Fig. 1A) of rat AGS3 were synthesized in the Protein Chemistry Technology Core at The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas: GPR1, 469EECFFDLLSKFQSSRMDDQRCPL492; GPR2, 524EEFFDLIASSQSRRLDDQRASV545; GPR3, KK-571GDEFFNMLIKYQSSRIDDQRCPP593; GPR4, 606EDFFSLIQRVQAKRMDEQRVDL627. Two lysine residues were added to the N terminus of the GPR3 peptide to enhance its solubility. In addition, the GPR consensus peptide (11Peterson Y.K. Bernard M.L. Ma H. Hazard III, S. Graber S.G.

The C terminus of each peptide was blocked by amidation. The purity of the synthetic peptides was verified using electrospray mass spectrometry and analytical high performance liquid chromatography. Peptides were desalted by elution through Sep-pack C18 cartridges (Waters), lyophilized, and stored at -20 °C. BODIPY-FL-GTPγS (BODIPY® FL thioether, sodium salt) was purchased from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR). pGEX-4T-1 expression vectors (Amersham Biosciences) encoding peptides corresponding to AGS3 GPR motifs extended with native N- and C-terminal flanking residues (Fig. 1B) were a gift from Dr. Stephen M. Lanier (Department of Pharmacology, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center). These peptides were expressed as N-terminal fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase (GST) (12Bernard M.L. Peterson Y.K. Chung P. Jourdan J. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1585-1593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The fusion peptides corresponding to the extended forms of the first three GPR motifs are referred to as GPR1ex (Pro463-Glu501), GPR2ex (Ser516-Leu555), and GPR3ex (Gly563-Thr602), respectively.AGS3 Expression Plasmids—The C-terminal domain of rat AGS3, residues 465-650, subcloned as an N-terminal His6 fusion protein in the expression vector pQE30 was a gift from Dr. Stephen M. Lanier. This domain contains four GPR motifs: GPR1, residues 470-489; GPR2, residues 524-542; GPR3, residues 572-590; and GPR4, residues 606-624. AGS3-C was cloned into the pDEST-15 destination vector as a GST fusion protein using the Gateway cloning system (Invitrogen). A tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site was inserted between coding regions for GST and AGS3. Cleavage by tobacco etch virus protease introduces an extra glycine residue at the N terminus. Two deletion mutants of AGS3 were also created: AGS3-Δ34 encompasses the first two (N-terminal) GPR domains of AGS3, residues 465-548; and AGS3-Δ4 includes the first three GPR domains, residues 465-597. Both mutants were created by inserting stop codons at the desired C terminus of the open reading frame of AGS3 using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene).Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Recombinant Gαi1 was expressed and purified as described previously (27Lee E. Linder M. Gilman A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 146-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). AGS3 and the deletion mutants of AGS3 were expressed in transformed BL21 (DE3) strains of Escherichia coli cells as GST fusion proteins. Cells were grown in 1-3 liters of LB medium at 37 °C to A600 of ∼0.9 and induced with 200 μm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 30 °C for 5 h for expression of recombinant proteins. Induced cells were harvested by centrifugation, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. Frozen cells were thawed and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Na+·HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 1× protease mixture PTT (1000× PTT contains 23 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 21 mg/ml Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, and 21 mg/ml N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone dissolved in 1:2 (v/v) solution of dimethyl sulfoxide and isopropanol)) containing 3 mg/ml hen egg white lysozyme for 30 min at 4 °C with continuous stirring followed by sonication for 5 min on ice (5-s pulse and 5-s idle cycle). The cell lysate was centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 40 min at 4 °C in a Beckman Ti45 rotor. Clear supernatant was filtered using a 0.45-μm syringe filter and loaded on glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (Amersham Biosciences). The resin was washed with lysis buffer, and the GST-tagged proteins were eluted with elution buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, 25 mm reduced glutathione, and 1× PTT). The purified GST fusion proteins were cleaved using 10 μg of recombinant tobacco etch virus protease/mg of fusion protein at 4 °C overnight and dialyzed against low salt buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 1× PTT, 5% glycerol). The protein was loaded on a Hi-Trap Q™ column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a 75-ml linear gradient of 100-750 mm NaCl. The proteins were eluted at 150-250 mm NaCl concentration. Fractions containing AGS3 or its deletion mutants were pooled, concentrated, and loaded on tandem Superdex™ 200 and 75 gel filtration columns (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with low salt buffer supplemented with 100 mm NaCl. The peak fractions were pooled, concentrated, and stored at 4 °C. Protein concentration was estimated by the Bradford assay using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. GST fusion proteins with extended GPR peptides were expressed in BL21 (DE3) strains. 2M. Bernard, Y. Peterson, and S. M. Lanier, personal communication. Cells (1 liter) were grown to an A600 of 0.5-0.6 and induced with 100 μm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 30 °C for 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. Frozen cells were thawed and resuspended in lysis buffer containing 1× PBS (1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm KCl, 140 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cell lysis was performed by brief 1-min sonication on ice followed by incubation with 1% Triton X-100 with continuous stirring at 4 °C. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 40 min at 4 °C in a Beckman Ti45 rotor. Cleared lysate was loaded on glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer. The resin was washed with lysis buffer, and the fusion proteins were eluted using buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, 5 mm EDTA, and 25 mm reduced glutathione. The fusion proteins were dialyzed against a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA, concentrated, and stored at 4 °C. Protein concentration was estimated by measuring A280 and using theoretically predicted extinction coefficients.Preparation and Purification of AGS3-C·Gαi1·GDP Complexes—The complex of Gαi1·GDP with AGS3-C was formed by incubating the proteins together in molar ratios (Gαi1·AGS3-C) exceeding 4:1 to ensure saturation of AGS3-C. Molar ratios exceeding 3:1 and 2:1 were used for complex formation of Gαi1 with AGS3-Δ4 and AGS3-Δ34, respectively. In a typical experiment, 100 μl of 500 μm AGS3-C was mixed with 500 μl of 350 μm Gαi1 in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm GDP and incubated on ice for 2 h. The resulting complex was separated at 4 °C on tandemly connected Superdex 200 and 75 gel filtration columns (Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, and 1× PTT as the running buffer. The apparent molecular weights of the complexes were estimated using gel filtration standards (Bio-Rad).Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Isothermal titration calorimetry was performed at 20 °C (293 K) using a MicroCal VP-ITC (MicroCal, Northhampton, MA) calorimeter. Protein samples were dialyzed against titration buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm DTT, and 10 μm GDP). Because peptides could not be dialyzed due to their lower molecular weight, lyophilized peptides were dissolved directly in titration buffer. Samples were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm in a bench-top microcentrifuge (Forma Scientific) for 5 min before loading in the sample cell or syringe. Contents of the sample cell were stirred continuously at 300 rpm during the experiment. A typical titration of Gαi1 with GPR peptides involved 25-30 injections at 3-min intervals of 8-10 μl of peptide solution (1 mm) into a sample cell containing 1.4 ml of Gαi1 (45-50 μm). For the titration of Gαi1 with AGS3-C or its deletion mutants, Gαi1 (125-200 μm) was injected through the syringe into a sample cell containing AGS3-C (5-10 μm); the injection volume was decreased to 5-6 μl, and the number of injections was increased to 45-50. For the GST fusion extended GPR peptides, Gαi1 (175-225 μm) was injected (35 injections of 8 μl) into the sample cell containing GPRex fusion peptide (20-25 μm), and NaCl (100 mm) was added to the titration buffer to avoid nonspecific interactions with GST. The heats of dilution of the titrants were subtracted from the titration data for base-line correction. The base line-corrected data were analyzed with MicroCal Origin™ 5.0 software to determine the enthalpy (ΔH), association constant (Ka), and stoichiometry of binding (N). Thermal titration data were fit to one or more of the three association models available in the software: “single set of identical sites,” “two sets of independent sites,” and “sequential binding sites” (28Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2416) Google Scholar, 29Microcal (1998) ITC Data Analysis in Origin, Version 5.0, Northampton, MAGoogle Scholar). The models were compared by visual inspection of the fitted curves and by comparing the χ2 values obtained after the computation. The model resulting in the lowest value of χ2 was considered the best model to describe the molecular mechanism of binding. Free energy change (ΔG) and entropy change (ΔS) were calculated from ΔH and Ka using standard free energy relationships. Several titrations were performed (two to four) for each sample set to evaluate reproducibility.Nucleotide Exchange Assay—The rate of guanine nucleotide exchange on Gαi1 was assayed by monitoring the rate at which the fluorescent GTP analog BODIPY-FL-GTPγS replaces bound GDP in the catalytic site of Gαi1 (30McEwen D.P. Gee K.R. Kang H.C. Neubig R.R. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 291: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Binding of the fluorescent nucleotide analog is accompanied by an increase in fluorescence of the BODIPY moiety. Gαi1 (final concentration, 200 nm) in assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm MgCl2) was incubated in the presence or absence of AGS3-C, AGS3-Δ34, AGS3-Δ4, GPR peptides, or GST fusion GPRex (at concentrations indicated in Figs. 4, 6, and 7) for 1-2 h at 25 °C. Samples were transferred into a 3-ml quartz cuvette with a"

Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), which activates both NF-κB and AP-1, increased <i>MAT2A</i> expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner, binding of both NF-κB and AP-1 to the <i>MAT2A</i> promoter and <i>MAT2A</i> promoter activity, with the latter effect blocked by site-directed mutagenesis of the NF-κB and AP-1 binding sites. Blocking NF-κB with IκB super-repressor or AP-1 with dominant-negative c-Jun led to decreased basal <i>MAT2A</i> expression and prevented the TNFα-induced increase in <i>MAT2A</i> expression. Although blocking NF-κB had no influence on the ability of TNFα to increase AP-1 nuclear binding, blocking AP-1 with dominant-negative c-Jun prevented the TNFα-mediated increase in NF-κB binding.

Studies of MMP-26 indicate that it has substrate specificity similar to other MMPs, with the exception of a preference for Ile at the P2 and P2′ positions, for small residues at the P3′ and P4′ positions, and Lys at the P4 position (11Park H.I.

MMP-26 also hydrolyzes several synthetic fluorogenic peptide substrates designed for stromelysin-1, gelatinases, collagenases, and tumor necrosis factor-α converting enzyme (4Park H.I. Ni J.

According to these peptide substrate studies, MMP-26 may be capable of cleaving a broad range of substrates, although it has less catalytic efficiency than other MMPs. X-ray crystal structures of MMPs illustrate that overall topology and secondary structures are conserved (12Gooley P.R. O'Connell J.F. Marcy A.I. Cuba G.C. Salowe S.P. Bush B.L. Hermes J.D.

Three types of S1′ pockets can be distinguished from the available structures of MMPs (19Bode W. Fernandez-Catalan C. Tschesche H. Grams F. Nagase H. Maskos K. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 639-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 20Nagase H. Clendeninn N.J. Appelt K. Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitors in Cancer Therapy. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 39-66Google Scholar). One type is a shallow pocket, as found in MMP-1 (human fibroblast collagenase; 13) and MMP-7 (matrilysin; 16), where the pockets are limited by the side chains of Arg and Tyr, respectively, crossing the pockets. Many of the structurally known MMPs possess Leu at the corresponding site, and its side chain forms the top of the pocket rather than crossing the pocket. These Leu-containing MMPs may be further classified as deep and intermediate S1′ pocket MMPs. A deep, tunnel-like pocket is found in MMP-3 (stromelysin-1; 12), MMP-12 (metalloelastase; 17), and MMP-14 (MT1-MMP; 21), whereas MMP-2 (gelatinase A; 22), MMP-8 (human neutrophil collagenase; 15), and MMP-9 (gelatinase B; 23) possess an intermediate-sized pocket, which is neither deep nor shallow. An enzyme with a shallow pocket prefers large, aliphatic residues in the P1′ position, such as Leu and Met (24Netzel-Arnett S. Sang Q.-X. Moore W.G.I. Narve M. Birkedal-Hansen H. Van Wart H.E.

The remainder of the MMPs can accommodate larger amino acid derivatives, such as homophenylalanine, in the P1′ position (26Mucha A. Cuniasse P. Kannan R. Beau F. Yiotakis A. Basset P. Dive V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2763-2768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). MMP-26, composed of 261 amino acid residues and lacking a hemopexin-like domain, represents the smallest member of the MMP family. The primary structure of MMP-26 can be divided into three regions that include a signal peptide, a propeptide domain, and a catalytic domain. MMP-26 identification, expression, and substrate specificity have been explored by several groups (4Park H.I. Ni J. Gerkema F.E. Liu D. Belozerov V.E. Sang Q.-X. J. Biol.

However, the S1′ pocket characteristics of MMP-26 are unknown because of the absence of an MMP-26 x-ray crystallographic structure. Therefore, in this study we have utilized previously characterized and newly developed mercaptosulfide MMPIs (27Schwartz, M. A., and Van Wart, H. E. (October 3, 1995) U. S.

A., and Van Wart, H. E. (October 3, 1995) U. S. Patent 5455262Google Scholar). Subsequent coupling with l-PheNHMe or l-leucine-p-methoxyanilide (27Schwartz, M. A., and Van Wart, H. E. (October 3, 1995) U. S. Patent 5455262Google Scholar) afforded the S-Boc and N-Boc protected inhibitors as mixtures of two diastereomers. The N-Boc group was selectively removed and replaced by the other acyl groups (29Jin Y. Ghaffari M.A. Schwartz M.A. Tetrahedron Lett. 2002; 43: 7319-7321Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The diastereomers were separated by flash chromatography on silica gel or by reverse-phase preparative high performance liquid chromatography on a C18 column. The slower-eluting S-Boc protected diastereomer exhibited the more potent MMP inhibition in each case. Its stereochemistry was assigned by 1H NMR NOE analysis (MAG-182), x-ray crystallography (YHJ-294-2) (29Jin Y. Ghaffari M.A. Schwartz M.A. Tetrahedron Lett. 2002; 43: 7319-7321Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar), or by analogy. Finally, the S-Boc protecting groups were removed by brief treatment with 2 N HCl in acetic acid and the mercaptosulfide inhibitors were isolated by lyophilization of the reaction mixture.

Inhibition of MMPs with Mercaptosulfide MMPIs—An inhibitor set consisting of eight mercaptosulfide inhibitors was chosen to evaluate the S1′ pocket of MMP-26 (Fig. 1). These inhibitors contain P1′ and P2′ residues and have a mercapto and a sulfide group as a possible bidentate metal-binding moiety. The inhibitors contain a Leu side chain (MAG-181 and -182 and YHJ-294-1 and -2) or a Homophe side chain (YHJ-72, -73, -74, and -75) at the P1′ site. These inhibitors were tested against MMPs with known pocket characteristics (MMP-1–3, -7–9, -12, and -14). The inhibition potency of this class of inhibitors for the MMPs is significantly enhanced with a β-H configuration at the five-membered ring containing the mercapto and sulfide groups. The inhibitors with a Leu side chain are more potent against the shallow pocket MMPs, MMP-1/human fibroblast collagenase, and MMP-7/matrilysin than those with a Homophe side chain. Inhibitors with a Homophe side chain (YHJ-72, -73, 74, and -75) were more potent against the known deep-pocket MMPs such as MMP-3, -12, and -14 than those with Leu side chain. The inhibitors with the Leu side chain at the P1′ site (MAG-182 and YHJ-294-2) inhibit MMP-7 (40 and 26 nm, respectively) and MMP-12 (130 and 93 nm, respectively) without significant differences in Kiapp values. However, the presence of Homophe at the P1′ site dramatically distinguishes MMP-12 from MMP-7. YHJ-73 efficiently inhibits MMP-12 (13 nm), however, the potency is decreased to 1 μm against MMP-7. This trend is also displayed by YHJ-75, which has a high nmKiapp value against MMP-7 (300 nm) but retains potency against MMP-12 (5.6 nm). This dramatic change of potency because of changes in the P1′ site of the inhibitors is consistently observed with the remaining shallow- and deep-pocket MMPs. MMPs with an intermediate pocket can also accommodate the Homophe at the P1′ residue. However, the difference in inhibitor potency observed with Leu or Homophe at the P1′ residue is not as remarkable as that in the shallow- and deep-pocket MMPs. Inhibitors containing Leu at the P1′ site (MAG-182 and YHJ-294-2) are only slightly more potent against MMP-2 and MMP-9 than inhibitors with Homophe (YHJ-73 and -75). These Homophe inhibitors are still potent against MMP-8 with Kiapp values in the low nanomolar range. In general, these results indicate that mercaptosulfide inhibitors are suitable for characterizing the S1′ pocket of MMPs. Characteristics of the S1′ Pocket of MMP-26 as Probed by Mercaptosulfide MMPIs—Inhibition constants for the inhibitors in Fig. 1 were measured with MMP-26 (Table I). YHJ-294-2 is the most potent inhibitor of MMP-26 among the mercaptosulfide inhibitors tested, with a Kiapp value of 2.8 nm. MMP-26 also favors the β-H configuration at the cyclopentyl or pyrrolidine ring moiety in the inhibitor. Addition of the urea-substituted pyrrolidine ring in place of the cyclopentyl ring (YHJ-294-1 and -2; YHJ-74 and -75) enhances the stereoselectivity for the β-H configuration. Importantly, MMP-26 prefers Leu over Homophe at the S1′ site, similar to the intermediate pocket MMPs, MMP-2, -8, and -9.Table IInhibition of human MMPs by mercaptosulfide MMP inhibitorsInhibitorKiappShallowDeepIntermediateMMP-1MMP-7MMP-3MMP-12MMP-14MMP-2MMP-8MMP-9MMP-26nmnmnmMAG-18168071025001,300259854.14481MAG-1824940470130241.10.890.5717YHJ-72>12 × 1035,500150130380930530180160YHJ-73>12 × 1031,000100131620708.628YHJ-294-15,2003,500>40 × 10316,0003,000430130550450YHJ-294-21002636093136.11.21.22.8YHJ-743600270117208830022082YHJ-752400300215.63.76.9443.08.6 Open table in a new tab Characterization of MMP"
https://openalex.org/W2079817946,"The RecA proteins of Escherichia coli (Ec) and Deinococcus radiodurans (Dr) both promote a DNA strand exchange reaction involving two duplex DNAs. The four-strand exchange reaction promoted by the DrRecA protein is similar to that promoted by EcRecA, except that key parts of the reaction are inhibited by Ec single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB). In the absence of SSB, the initiation of strand exchange is greatly enhanced by dsDNA-ssDNA junctions at the ends of DNA gaps. This same trend is seen with the EcRecA protein. The results lead to an expansion of published hypotheses for the pathway for RecA-mediated DNA pairing, in which the slow first order step (observed in several studies) involves a structural transition to a state we designate P. The P state is identical to the state found when RecA is bound to double-stranded (ds) DNA. The structural state present when the RecA protein is bound to single-stranded (ss) DNA is designated A. The DNA pairing model in turn facilitates an articulation of three additional conclusions arising from the present work. 1) When a segment of a RecA filament bound to ssDNA is forced into the P state (as RecA bound to the ssDNA immediately adjacent to dsDNA-ssDNA junction), the segment becomes “pairing enhanced.” 2) The unusual DNA pairing properties of the D. radiodurans RecA protein can be explained by postulating this protein has a more stringent requirement to initiate DNA strand exchange from the P state. 3) RecA filaments bound to dsDNA (P state) have directly observable structural changes relative to RecA filaments bound to ssDNA (A state), involving the C-terminal domain.

The 352-amino acid polypeptide (Mr 37,842) functions as part of a helical nucleoprotein filament (1Cox M.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 57: 551-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 2Lusetti S.L. Cox M.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 71-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). RecA protein promotes a DNA strand exchange reaction that reflects its major function in cellular recombination (Fig. 1A). The RecA filament forms on the circular single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). A linear duplex is then aligned with the bound ssDNA, and strand exchange ensues. This order of substrate binding, ssDNA first and dsDNA second, is characteristic of the DNA strand exchange reactions promoted by all RecA family proteins, with one exception treated below. Strand exchange can initiate on either end of the linear duplex, but the reaction is propagated uniquely 5′ to 3′ relative to the single-stranded DNA substrate (3Cox M.M. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6018-6022Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 4Kahn R. Cunningham R.P. Das Gupta C. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

DNA pairing is initiated, and considerable strand exchange can occur without ATP hydrolysis (e.g. with the use of ATPγS or RecA mutants that bind but do not hydrolyze ATP) (6Jain S.K. Cox M.M.

However, when ATP (or dATP) is hydrolyzed, the reaction becomes unidirectional and can bypass substantial structural barriers such as heterologous sequence insertions in one of the DNA substrates (6Jain S.K.

The present work focuses on the initial DNA pairing that occurs during DNA strand exchange, as promoted by RecA and related proteins. A range of issues are addressed, and these require an introduction to five separate but related topics. RecA protein of E. coli single-stranded double-stranded single-stranded DNA-binding protein adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) linear Duplex substrate circular ssDNA adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate gapped duplex nucleotides RecA protein of D. radiodurans. First, the single-stranded DNA-binding protein (EcSSB) has a major effect on all RecA reactions, playing a role in at least two steps in DNA strand exchange. SSB can both inhibit and enhance the RecA filament formation. The assembly of a filament on ssDNA occurs with distinct nucleation and extension steps, with the extension proceeding 5′ to 3′. In the absence of SSB, RecA protein nucleates well onto ssDNA but does not extend into regions containing secondary structure. The effect of SSB depends on when it is added. If bound to the DNA prior to addition of RecA, the SSB inhibits the nucleation step (13Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 14Kowalczykowski S.C. Biochimie (Paris). 1991; 73: 289-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). If SSB is added after RecA nucleation has occurred, the SSB facilitates the extension phase of the process, melting the regions of secondary structure before being displaced by RecA (13Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 14Kowalczykowski S.C. Biochimie (Paris). 1991; 73: 289-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, SSB plays an important role during DNA strand exchange, binding to the displaced strand of the duplex substrate as the reaction proceeds (15Lavery P.E. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9315-9320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ullsperger C.J. Cox M.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10859-10866Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The stimulatory effects of SSB can be partially compensated for by forming RecA filaments on ssDNA under conditions in which little secondary structure exists, and then adding the Mg2+ needed for efficient reaction (a Mg2+-shift protocol) (17Flory J. Tsang S.S. Muniyappa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7026-7030Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 18Muniyappa K. Shaner S.L. Tsang S.S. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2757-2761Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Second, The RecA protein from Deinococcus radiodurans (DrRecA) promotes DNA strand exchange a little differently than a typical RecA recombinase. D. radiodurans is part of a small family of bacterial species that are the most radiation-resistant organisms known (19Battista J.R. Earl A.M. Park M.J. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 362-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 20Ferreira A.C. Nobre M.F. Rainey F.A. Silva M.T. Wait R. Burghardt J. Chung A.P. da Costa M.S.

Although this organism efficiently repairs many types of DNA damage (21Minton K.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), resistance to ionizing radiation is especially remarkable. D. radiodurans is able to survive exposures to γ radiation of 1.7 megarads without lethality or induced mutation (22Daly M.J. Ouyang L. Fuchs P. Minton K.W. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3508-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and can survive hundreds of irradiation-induced DNA double-stranded breaks per haploid genome (22Daly M.J. Ouyang L. Fuchs P. Minton K.W. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3508-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 23Lin J.Y. Qi R. Aston C. Jing J.P. Anantharaman T.S. Mishra B. White O. Daly M.J. Minton K.W. Venter J.C. Schwartz D.C. Science. 1999; 285: 1558-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The mechanisms underlying the very efficient DNA repair of this organism remain poorly understood (24Makarova K.S. Aravind L. Wolf Y.I. Tatusov R.L. Minton K.W. Koonin E.V. Daly M.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 44-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). A functional DrRecA protein is required for expression of the radiation-resistant phenotypes (25Minton K.W. Mutat. Res. 1996; 363: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The DrRecA protein (362 amino acids, Mr 38,013) has an amino acid sequence that is 57% identical (72% similar) to that of the EcRecA protein. In most respects, the DrRecA protein is similar to other bacterial RecA proteins. It forms helical filaments on DNA, hydrolyzes ATP and dATP, and promotes DNA strand exchange (26Kim J.I. Sharma A.K. Abbott S.N. Wood E.A. Dwyer D.W. Jambura A. Minton K.W. Inman R.B. Daly M.J. Cox M.M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1649-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It does bind to dsDNA much faster than the EcRecA protein. However, the most substantial difference documented to date concerns the pathway for DNA strand exchange, where the order of substrate binding changes in reactions promoted by the DrRecA protein. In the reaction of Fig. 1A, the filament is formed first on the duplex DNA, and the single-stranded DNA is then brought in for exchange (27Kim J.-I. Cox M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7917-7921Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Third, the initial alignment and pairing of the two DNA molecules by the EcRecA protein and the eukaryotic Rad51 protein has been the focus of numerous studies, reviewed in some detail elsewhere (2Lusetti S.L. Cox M.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 71-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 28Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 63: 310-366Google Scholar). There are several distinct kinetic steps in the pairing process, as explored by the Camerini-Otero and Radding groups (29Yancey-Wrona J.E. Camerini-Otero R.D. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1149-1158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 30Bazemore L.R. Takahashi M. Radding C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14672-14682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 31Bazemore L.R. Foltastogniew E. Takahashi M. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11863-11868Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A theme of the kinetic studies is the existence of a fast second order step followed by a slower first order step in the pairing and exchange pathway (29Yancey-Wrona J.E. Camerini-Otero R.D. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1149-1158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 30Bazemore L.R. Takahashi M. Radding C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14672-14682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 31Bazemore L.R. Foltastogniew E. Takahashi M. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11863-11868Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), with both steps being reversible in the presence of ATP (30Bazemore L.R. Takahashi M. Radding C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14672-14682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 31Bazemore L.R. Foltastogniew E. Takahashi M. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11863-11868Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Also important is another contribution by Radding and co-workers (32Gupta R.C. Folta-Stogniew E. O'Malley S. Takahashi M. Radding C.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 705-714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) that, when combined with earlier work, provides a good picture of the likely pairing process. The effort focuses on the human Rad51 protein, but we assume that the DNA pairing process is similar in Rad51 and RecA. In brief, the duplex DNA probably approaches the bound single strand via the minor groove in the duplex. The homology search likely involves base flipping, with A:T base pairs playing a particularly prominent role. DNAs with high GC content block or reduce DNA strand exchange involving short oligonucleotides (32Gupta R.C. Folta-Stogniew E. O'Malley S. Takahashi M. Radding C.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 705-714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Fourth, there is an important contrast between the 3- and 4-strand exchange processes diagrammed in Fig. 1. The E. coli RecA protein will promote a 4-strand exchange reaction (Fig. 1B). One of the duplex substrates must have a single-strand gap. The gap serves as both a nucleation site for RecA filament formation and as an initiation site for DNA strand exchange. The second linear duplex must overlap the gap by at least 50–100 bp for an efficient strand exchange to occur (33Conley E.C. West S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10156-10163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Lindsley J.E. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10164-10171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These reactions are also unidirectional, proceeding 5′ to 3′ relative to the ssDNA in the gap (35West S.C. Cassuto E. Howard F.P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1982; 187: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 36West S.C. Howard-Flanders P. Cell. 1984; 37: 683-691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 37Chow S.A.

Cell. 1998; 1: 309-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The 4-stranded portion of the reaction also requires ATP hydrolysis. When ATP is not hydrolyzed, reactions are initiated in the gap but do not proceed beyond the gap region (7Kim J.I. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16444-16449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Shan Q. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5712-5724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Even though the exchange is largely between two duplex DNAs, SSB plays a significant role in the 4-strand reaction. Some early reports indicated that SSB did not stimulate the 4-strand exchange reactions (35West S.C. Cassuto E. Howard F.P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1982; 187: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 39West S.C. Cassuto E. Howard-Flanders P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1982; 186: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, subsequent studies found that SSB greatly enhanced most 4-strand exchange processes (34Lindsley J.E. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10164-10171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and SSB has generally been included in these reactions (7Kim J.I. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16444-16449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Shan Q. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol.

Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 309-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The apparent requirement for SSB in many but not all 4-strand exchange reactions has never been explained. Fifth, there is now evidence for at least four different functional states of RecA protein, occurring at different reaction stages. These have recently been designated O, Ac, Ao, and P (1Cox M.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 57: 551-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 40Lusetti S.L. Shaw J.J. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16381-16388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). The O state is largely inactive and is found in the absence of nucleotide cofactor or in the presence of ADP (41Yu X. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 334-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This form can bind to DNA, creating a helical filament with a pitch of 76 Å (41Yu X. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 334-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). There may be multiple forms of this state, depending on binding to ADP and/or ssDNA (42Lee J.W. Cox M.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7666-7676Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 43Lee J.W. Cox M.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7677-7683Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Addition of ATP, ATPγS, or dATP results in a conformation change to an active form that is manifested by extended filaments on DNA with a pitch of 95 Å (41Yu X. Egelman E.H. J. Mol.

This form is given the general designation A, and this is the form that hydrolyzes ATP with a kcat of about 30 min–1 when bound to ssDNA. The A and O states are not directly interconvertible, such that RecA bound to ssDNA in the O state must dissociate and re-bind in the A state (41Yu X. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 334-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 42Lee J.W. Cox M.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7666-7676Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 43Lee J.W. Cox M.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7677-7683Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). There are two forms of the “A” state. A closed form, found at relatively low Mg2+ concentrations, has a restricted capacity for the pairing of the bound ssDNA to homologous duplexes and is thus designated Ac (for closed form of A) (40Lusetti S.L. Shaw J.J. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16381-16388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In this state, the DNA pairing is enhanced if the linear duplex has a single-strand extension at the end (40Lusetti S.L. Shaw J.J. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16381-16388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). An open form of A (Ao) is found at higher Mg2+ concentrations (6–8 mm above the ATP concentration) and is much more permissive in DNA pairing reactions (40Lusetti S.L. Shaw J.J. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16381-16388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The Ac to Ao transition involves the C terminus of RecA protein (40Lusetti S.L. Shaw J.J. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16381-16388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Besides the DNA pairing modulation, many properties of Ac and Ao appear to be similar, such as the capacity to hydrolyze ATP. However, there is additional evidence that Mg2+ concentrations affect RecA function and structural state. The contour lengths of RecA-ssDNA nucleoprotein filaments formed in 1 mm magnesium are 116–120% relative to duplex DNA in the presence of 1 mm ATPγS (50Honigberg S.M. Gonda D.K. Flory J. Radding C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11845-11851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 137% relative to duplex DNA in the presence of 1.3 mm ATP (17Flory J. Tsang S.S. Muniyappa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7026-7030Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), which translates to less filament extension than the 150% extension observed when the filaments are formed with 10 mm magnesium ion (41Yu X. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 334-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 44Egelman E.H. Stasiak A. J. Mol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 16372-16380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Elevated Mg2+ levels also result in the formation of RecA filament bundles observable by electron microscopy under some conditions (44Egelman E.H. Stasiak A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 677-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 45Egelman E.H. Stasiak A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 329-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 52Yu X. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 193-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Finally, with elevated Mg2+ levels, RecA protein better resists displacement by SSB (13Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Both states, Ac and Ao, hydrolyze ATP at similar rates. Image reconstructions from electron micrographs have shown that RecA, particularly the C-terminal domain, undergoes significant conformation changes in response to ATP hydrolysis (53Yu X. Jacobs S.A. West S.C. Ogawa T. Egelman E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8419-8424Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 54VanLoock M.S. Yu X. Yang S. Lai A.L. Low C. Campbell M.J. Egelman E.H. Structure. 2003; 11: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We anticipate that both A states exist in a family of conformations, with the exact conformation present in a certain protomer dependent on the stage of the ATP hydrolytic cycle. When a second strand of DNA is present, either by direct binding to dsDNA or as a result of DNA strand exchange, another structural change occurs to a state we designate P (1Cox M.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 57: 551-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The evidence for this is functional and indirect, but nonetheless extensive. The P structural form is characterized by 30% lower rates of ATP hydrolysis (55Bedale W.A. Cox M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5725-5732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 56Schutte B.C. Cox M.M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5616-5625Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), higher rates of exchange of RecA monomers into and out of the filament (57Shan Q. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 756-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 58Shan Q. Cox M.M. J. Biol.

Biol. 1996; 257: 756-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 59Arenson T.A. Tsodikov O.V. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) than the A conformations. A distinction between the A and P states can also be seen in the RecA-stimulated autocatalytic cleavage of the LexA repressor (60Takahashi M. Schnarr M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). On ssDNA (the A state), RecA protein stimulates LexA cleavage, whereas stimulation is much reduced when RecA is bound to dsDNA (60Takahashi M. Schnarr M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Most studies of RecA protein-mediated stimulation of LexA cleavage have been carried out in the presence of relatively low Mg2+ concentrations (61Little J.W. Edmiston S.H. Pacelli L.Z. Mount D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3225-3229Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 62Little J.W. Biochimie (Paris). 1991; 73: 411-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), so that the Ac form of RecA may be the most active in this reaction. The present study began as an effort to explore further the DNA pairing properties of the DrRecA protein, specifically focused on 4-strand exchange reactions in an attempt to explain the unusual DNA pairing pathway of the protein. The study evolved into an investigation of fundamental DNA pairing mechanisms, although the results do suggest an explanation for the unique DNA pairing properties of the DrRecA protein. The work provides some data consistent with the observations of Radding and co-workers (32Gupta R.C. Folta-Stogniew E. O'Malley S. Takahashi M. Radding C.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 705-714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) that A:T base pairs are important for the initiation of DNA pairing and extends the observation to RecA protein. In addition, evidence is provided that the P conformation of the RecA protein does not simply occur as a result of DNA strand exchange but is instead a conformation that greatly facilitates the process of DNA strand exchange. The primary observation around which these conclusions are built is that a 4-strand exchange reaction is greatly enhanced if the end of the linear DNA coincides with the very end of the gap in the gapped DNA substrate. On a gapped DNA, the RecA filament is in effect a mixture of segments in the A conformation (in the gap) and in the P conformation (on the duplex DNA). We hypothesize that the P conformation, which is the more cooperative of the two, extends for a short distance into the gap, leading to a large enhancement of DNA pairing near the dsDNA-ssDNA junction at the end of the gap. Finally, the structural alterations that relate the A and P forms of RecA protein (on ssDNA versus on dsDNA, respectively) are explored via the use of image reconstruction from electron micrographs. Enzymes and Reagents—The EcRecA and DrRecA proteins were purified by polyethyleneimine precipitation followed by a DEAE-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) and a hydroxyapatite column (Bio-Rad) as described (51Lusetti S.L.

To identify these exosites, we prepared six antithrombin-α1-proteinase inhibitor chimeras in which antithrombin residues 224-286 and 310-322 that circumscribe a region surrounding the reactive loop on the inhibitor surface were replaced in 10-16-residue segments with the homologous segments of α1-proteinase inhibitor. All chimeras bound heparin with a high affinity similar to wild-type, underwent heparin-induced fluorescence changes indicative of normal conformational activation, and were able to form SDS-stable complexes with thrombin, factor Xa, and factor IXa and inhibit these proteases with stoichiometries minimally altered from those of wild-type antithrombin. With only one exception, conformational activation of the chimeras with a heparin pentasaccharide resulted in normal ∼100-300-fold enhancements in reactivity with factor Xa and factor IXa. The exception was the chimera in which residues 246-258 were replaced, corresponding to strand 3 of β-sheet C, which showed little or no enhancement of its reactivity with these proteases following pentasaccharide activation. By contrast, all chimeras including the strand 3C chimera showed essentially wild-type reactivities with thrombin after pentasaccharide activation as well as normal full-length heparin enhancements in reactivity with all proteases due to heparin bridging. These findings suggest that antithrombin exosites responsible for enhancing the rates of factor Xa and factor IXa inhibition in the conformationally activated inhibitor lie in strand 3 of β-sheet C of the serpin.

Antithrombin is the major serpin family regulator of blood clotting proteases in plasma (1Björk I. Olson S.T. Church F.C. Cunningham D.D. Ginsburg D. Hoffman M. Stone S.R. Tollefsen D.M.

This essential anticoagulant protein inhibits clotting proteases, mainly thrombin, factor Xa, and factor IXa, by forming stable equimolar complexes with the enzymes through an unusual mechanism, which is shared by other serpin family protease inhibitors (1Björk I.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8143-8152Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In this mechanism, the protease initially recognizes an exposed reactive loop of the inhibitor as a normal substrate. The protease catalytic serine proceeds to attack a reactive bond in the loop, producing the usual acyl-intermediate of the proteolysis reaction in which the C-terminal residue of the bond is severed and the N-terminal residue is covalently joined to the protease serine in an ester linkage. This triggers a major serpin conformational change, wherein the N-terminal end of the cleaved loop along with the tethered protease inserts into β-sheet A of the serpin body, thereby dragging the protease to the opposite pole of the serpin, where it is inactivated by crushing (6Stratikos E.

The anticoagulant function of antithrombin requires the participation of the glycosaminoglycans, heparin and heparan sulfate, as cofactors (1Björk I. Olson S.T. Church F.C. Cunningham D.D.

These polysaccharides activate antithrombin to inhibit its target proteases at physiologically significant rates by binding the serpin and inducing conformational changes that enhance the serpin's reactivity with the enzymes (10Olson S.T. Björk I. Bock S.C. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2002; 12: 198-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The binding involves a sequence-specific pentasaccharide in the glycosaminoglycans present in only a fraction of the molecules (11Choay J. Petitou M. Lormeau J.C. Sinaÿ P. Casu B. Gatti G. Biochem.

Manithody C. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol.

Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6353-6364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This basic exosite is accessible only in the presence of physiologic levels of calcium ions in those target proteases that retain their γ-carboxyglutamic acid domain (i.e. factor Xa and factor IXa) (5Bedsted T. Swanson R. Chuang Y.-J. Bock P.E. Björk I. Olson S.T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8143-8152Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 19Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16824-16827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Calcium ions expose the basic exosite by binding to the γ-carboxyglutamic acid domain and disrupting an intramolecular interaction with the exosite. The x-ray crystal structures of free and heparin pentasaccharide-complexed antithrombin have revealed the conformational changes in antithrombin that are responsible for allosteric activation (20Skinner R. Abrahams J.-P. Whisstock J.C. Lesk A.M. Carrell R.W. Wardell M.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 601-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 21Jin L. Abrahams J.P. Skinner R. Petitou M. Pike R.N. Carrell R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14683-14688Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Significant structural changes are induced in the heparin binding site by the bound pentasaccharide that result in a high affinity complementary interaction. These changes are globally transmitted to the rest of the protein and especially affect the reactive center loop conformation. The N-terminal hinge residues of the antithrombin reactive loop are thus buried in β-sheet A in the free serpin structure but are expelled from sheet A in the heparin-complexed serpin, resulting in exposure of the loop in a manner typical of other serpin structures (21Jin L. Abrahams J.P. Skinner R. Petitou M. Pike R.N. Carrell R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14683-14688Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Additionally, the x-ray structures together with biochemical and mutagenesis data have suggested that the primary specificity-determining residue of the loop, the P1 Arg-393 residue, makes a weak interaction with Glu-255 of the serpin body in the native partially buried loop conformation, which is then disrupted in the activated expelled loop state (22Chuang Y.-J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 24460-24465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, mutagenesis of the reactive loop P6-P3′ residues that comprise the protease binding site has shown that conformational activation of antithrombin does not simply involve making the reactive loop more accessible to target proteases. Thus, whereas the reactivity of unactivated antithrombin with proteases is sensitive to such reactive loop mutations, the heparin enhancement in reactivity is not affected (5Bedsted T. Swanson R. Chuang Y.-J. Bock P.E. Björk I. Olson S.T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8143-8152Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 22Chuang Y.-J. Swanson R. Raja S.M. Bock S.C. Olson S.T.

Med. 2002; 12: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These findings have suggested that exosites outside of the P6-P3′ reactive loop region are responsible for the heparin enhancement of antithrombin's reactivity with its target proteases. Whereas exosites clearly exist on heparin to enable a full-length heparin to promote antithrombin-protease reactions by bridging the inhibitor and protease in a ternary complex, additional exosites must also exist on antithrombin to explain how conformational activation by the pentasaccharide produces several hundred-fold enhancements in antithrombin reactivity with two target proteases, factor Xa and factor IXa (5Bedsted T. Swanson R. Chuang Y.-J. Bock P.E. Björk I. Olson S.T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8143-8152Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 22Chuang Y.-J. Swanson R. Raja S.M. Bock S.C. Olson S.T.

Med. 2002; 12: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have located the antithrombin exosites by engineering a series of chimeras in which regions that circumscribe the reactive loop were changed to the homologous regions of the serpin, α1-proteinase inhibitor (α1PI) 1The abbreviations used are: α1PIα1-proteinase inhibitorATantithrombin. (27Elliott P.R. Abrahams J -P. Lomas D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Because this approach retains those conserved hydrophobic core residues that are critical for serpin tertiary structure (28Irving J.A. Pike R.N. Lesk A.M. Whisstock J.C. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1845-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), we expected that it would reveal which antithrombin surface residues surrounding the reactive loop participated in exosite interactions with proteases. All chimeras retained the ability to bind heparin with high affinity, undergo conformational activation, and form stable equimolar complexes with thrombin, factor Xa, and factor IXa, indicating that the amino acid changes had not altered the unique anticoagulant properties of antithrombin. Of the six antithrombin-α1PI chimeras that were made, only one chimera, containing the α1PI segment of strand 3 of β-sheet C, showed a defect in the ability of the heparin pentasaccharide to enhance its reactivity with both factors Xa and IXa. By contrast, full-length bridging heparin enhancements of antithrombin reactivity with thrombin, factor Xa, and factor IXa were essentially normal for this and all other antithrombin chimeras. These results suggest that a common antithrombin exosite that recognizes both factor Xa and IXa upon conformational activation resides in strand 3 of β-sheet C. α1-proteinase inhibitor antithrombin. Construction, Expression, and Purification of Wild Type and Variant Antithrombins—Recombinant antithrombins were constructed on an N135Q background by ligating the cDNAs encoding the antithrombins into the pFastBac1 vector from the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen). Mutations were introduced into the N135Q antithrombin cDNA by the splicing-overlapping extension method (29Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2641) Google Scholar) utilizing the Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Briefly, two oligonucleotides encoding the changes for overlapping 5′-end and 3′-end segments of the mutated region in sense and antisense strands and extending outside of the mutated region were annealed to the antithrombin cDNA along with complementary strand primers and extended in separate PCRs. The PCR products of these reactions were then annealed through the overlap region and extended in a third PCR to generate a double-stranded antithrombin cDNA containing the desired mutations. Oligonucleotides for introducing the mutations were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Recombinant proteins were expressed in insect cells after infection with baculovirus containing the inserted wild-type or variant antithrombin cDNA as described previously (30Ersdal-Badju E. Lu A.

Recombinant antithrombins were purified by first concentrating the medium by ultrafiltration (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and then chromatographing the concentrate on a 5-ml HiTrap heparin-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) with NaCl gradient elution as in previous studies (30Ersdal-Badju E.

The concentration of the wild-type protein was measured from the absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 37,700 m-1 cm-1 (32Nordenman B. Nyström C. Björk I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 78: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Concentrations of antithrombin variants were determined using the Micro BCA Protein Assay (Pierce) with wild-type antithrombin as a standard. Proteases—Human α-thrombin was prepared by first purifying prothrombin from plasma and then activating the zymogen and purifying the enzyme as described (33Miletich J.P. Broze Jr., G.J. Majerus P.W. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 105: 304-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 34Owen W.G. Jackson C.M. Thromb. Res. 1973; 3: 705-714Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Factor Xa (predominantly α-form), factor IX and factor XIa were purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). Factor IXa was obtained by activation of the zymogen with factor XIa as described (5Bedsted T. Swanson R. Chuang Y.-J. Bock P.E. Björk I. Olson S.T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8143-8152Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Heparins—A synthetic heparin pentasaccharide corresponding to the antithrombin binding sequence in heparin (11Choay J. Petitou M. Lormeau J.C. Sinaÿ P. Casu B. Gatti G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 116: 492-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar) was generously provided by Maurice Petitou (Sanofi Recherche, Toulouse, France). A full-length heparin with reduced polydispersity that contained the pentasaccharide and had an average chain length of ∼50 saccharides was isolated from commercial heparin by size and antithrombin affinity fractionation as previously described (35Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Concentrations of heparins were obtained by stoichiometric titrations of antithrombin with the saccharides monitored by tryptophan fluorescence changes accompanying the interaction as in previous studies (13Olson S.T.

Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). SDS and Native PAGE—The purity of recombinant antithrombins was verified by reducing or nonreducing SDS-PAGE on 10% acrylamide gels using the Laemmli discontinuous buffer system (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). The ability of the recombinant inhibitors to form SDS-stable complexes with thrombin and factor Xa was evaluated by reacting 1.6 μm recombinant antithrombin and 0.8 μm protease for 15-18 h or in some cases for 1 h. Native PAGE was conducted with the Laemmli buffer system under nondenaturing conditions. Experimental Conditions—All experiments were conducted at 25 °C in either 20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.1 mm EDTA or 100 mm Hepes, 5 mm CaCl2 buffer. Each buffer contained 0.1% (w/v) polyethylene glycol and NaCl to achieve an ionic strength (I) of 0.15 and was adjusted to pH 7.4. Heparin Binding to Antithrombin Variants—Binding of heparin pentasaccharide to wild-type and variant antithrombins was analyzed by titrating the inhibitor with the saccharide and monitoring the tryptophan fluorescence changes induced by the binding with an SLM 8000 spectrofluorimeter as in previous studies (13Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Fluorescence changes were computer-fit by the quadratic equilibrium binding equation with the stoichiometry, KD, and maximal fluorescence enhancement the fitted parameters. Stoichiometry of Antithrombin-Protease Reactions—The stoichiometries of inhibition of thrombin, factor Xa, and factor IXa by wild-type and variant antithrombins were measured essentially as in previous studies (5Bedsted T. Swanson R. Chuang Y.-J. Bock P.E. Björk I. Olson S.T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8143-8152Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 13Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J.

Varying amounts of antithrombin were added to a fixed concentration of thrombin, factor Xa, or factor IXa (50-100 nm) to give molar ratios of inhibitor/protease up to ∼2 in 100-μl reaction volumes. Reactions with factor Xa and thrombin were done both in the absence of heparin and in the presence of 100 nm heparin pentasaccharide or full-length heparin, whereas those with factor IXa were conducted just in the presence of the full-length heparin. Reactions were allowed to proceed to completion (>99%) based on measured rate constants, for times of 15-18 h for uncatalyzed reactions and 0.5-2 h for catalyzed reactions. Residual enzyme activity was then measured by the addition of 0.9 ml of chromogenic substrate, either 100 μm S-2238 (Chromogenix, Franklin, OH) for thrombin, 100 μm Spectrozyme FXa for factor Xa, or 300 μm Spectrozyme FIXa for factor IXa (American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT). The factor IXa substrate was made up in a pH 8 Hepes buffer containing 10 mm CaCl2 and 33% ethylene glycol to increase the sensitivity of the assay (5Bedsted T. Swanson R. Chuang Y.-J. Bock P.E. Björk I. Olson S.T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8143-8152Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The initial linear rate of substrate hydrolysis was monitored from the absorbance changes at 405 nm for several minutes. Alternatively, factor IXa activity was measured with 100 μm Pefafluor FIXa fluorigenic substrate (Centerchem, Norwalk, CT), and the increase in fluorescence due to substrate hydrolysis was monitored using excitation and emission wavelengths of 380 and 440 nm, respectively (5Bedsted T. Swanson R. Chuang Y.-J. Bock P.E. Björk I. Olson S.T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8143-8152Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The decrease in enzyme activity as a function of increases in the inhibitor/enzyme ratio was fit by linear regression, and the stoichiometry was obtained from the intercept of the linear plot with the abscissa. Kinetics of Protease Inhibition by Antithrombin—Second-order rate constants for the inhibition of thrombin, factor Xa, and factor IXa by the recombinant antithrombins in the absence and presence of pentasaccharide or full-length heparins were determined under pseudo-first-order conditions with at least a 10-fold molar excess of inhibitor over protease as in past studies (5Bedsted T. Swanson R. Chuang Y.-J. Bock P.E. Björk I. Olson S.T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8143-8152Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 35Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 37Turk B. Brieditis I. Bock S.C. Olson S.T. Björk I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6682-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Antithrombin concentrations ranged from 100 nm to 5 μm, and protease concentrations were 2-25 nm in a reaction volume of 50-100 μl. Catalytic heparin concentrations ranged from 0 to 10 nm in most cases but were extended up to 100 nm for some factor IXa reactions. Stoichiometric heparin concentrations comparable with the antithrombin concentration were used for antithrombin-pentasaccharide complex reactions with thrombin and with factor IXa and for reactions of the strand 3C antithrombin chimera with factor Xa. Reactions of free antithrombins and those reactions of antithrombin-pentasaccharide complexes in which stoichiometric heparin concentrations were employed with proteases were monitored by quenching reactions after varying times with 0.9-0.95 ml of 100-300 μm chromogenic or 100 μm fluorigenic substrate containing 50 μg/ml Polybrene to neutralize heparin when present. Residual protease activity was measured from the initial rate of substrate hydrolysis as described above. The observed pseudo-first-order rate constants (kobs) for the inhibition reactions were obtained by fitting the loss of enzyme activity to a single exponential decay function by nonlinear regression analysis (5Bedsted T. Swanson R. Chuang Y.-J. Bock P.E. Björk I. Olson S.T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8143-8152Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 37Turk B. Brieditis I. Bock S.C. Olson S.T. Björk I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6682-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The second-order rate constants for free antithrombin reactions were calculated by dividing kobs by the antithrombin concentration. Rate constants for heparin-catalyzed reactions were obtained by dividing kobs by the concentration of antithrombin-heparin complex calculated from measured KD values for the interaction after correcting for any contribution of the free antithrombin reaction. The kinetics of inhibition of thrombin, factor Xa, and factor IXa by recombinant antithrombins in the presence of catalytic levels of heparin were analyzed as a function of the heparin concentration for a fixed reaction time. Thrombin reaction times were 18 s, factor Xa times were 2-5 min, and factor IXa times were 1-2 min. The decrease in protease activity as a function of increases in heparin concentration was fit by a single exponential function based on the following equation (37Turk B. Brieditis I. Bock S.C. Olson S.T. Björk I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6682-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).[P]t=[P]0×exp-(kuncat×[AT]0×t+kH×[H]0×([AT]0/(KAT,H+[AT]0))×t)(Eq. 1) In this equation, [P]0 and [P]t denote protease concentrations at time 0 and time t, [AT]0 and [H]0 are antithrombin and heparin concentrations, kuncat and kH are the second-order rate constants for free antithrombin and antithrombin-heparin complex reactions with protease, and KAT,H is the dissociation constant for the antithrombin-heparin interaction. Rearranging this equation shows that the inhibition of protease will decay exponentially as a function of the heparin concentration when the reaction time is fixed.[P]t=[P]0×exp-(kuncat×[AT]0×t)×exp-(kH×([AT]0/(KAT,H+[AT]0))×t×[H]0)(Eq. 2) The intercept of the exponential at zero heparin concentration in this case is equal to [P]0 × exp -(kuncat × [AT]0 × t), and the exponential constant is equal to kH × ([AT]0/(KAT,H + [AT]0)) × t. The second-order inhibition rate constant for the heparin-catalyzed reaction is thus obtained by dividing the fitted exponential constant by the fixed reaction time and by the factor [AT]0/(KAT,H + [AT]0), representing the fraction of antithrombin complexed with heparin. This analysis provides a robust determination of the association rate constant and validation of the second-order kinetic behavior over a range of antithrombin-heparin complex concentrations with minimal expenditure of reagents. Design of the Antithrombin-α1PI Chimeras—We previously showed that conformational activation of antithrombin by heparin generates new interaction exosites outside the serpin reactive loop, which enhance the inhibitor's reactivity with the target proteases, factor Xa and factor IXa (5Bedsted T. Swanson R. Chuang Y.-J. Bock P.E. Björk I. Olson S.T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8143-8152Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 22Chuang Y.-J. Swanson R. Raja S.M. Bock S.C. Olson S.T.

Chem. 2001; 276: 14961-14971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In order to map these exosites, we constructed six chimeric variants in which linear segments of antithrombin consisting of 10-16 residues were replaced with the homologous sequences from the prototypic serpin, α1PI. The replaced segments corresponded to regions of the inhibitor that circumscribe the reactive protease binding loop and that involve secondary structural elements lying within 20 Å of the principal specificity-determining residue of the reactive loop, the P1 arginine 393 residue (20Skinner R.

Examination of the structures of known factor Xa-protein protease inhibitor complexes showed that the 20-Å distance would encompass the “reach” of the surface loops of factor Xa surrounding the enzyme active site, which were expected to interact with the putative exosite of antithrombin (38Wei A.

https://openalex.org/W1991767570,"Calmodulin (CaM) is the major Ca2+ sensor in eukaryotic cells. It consists of four EF-hand Ca2+ binding motifs, two in its N-terminal domain and two in its C-terminal domain. Through a negative feedback loop, CaM inhibits Ca2+ influx through N-methyl-d-aspartate-type glutamate receptors in neurons by binding to the C0 region in the cytosolic tail of the NR1 subunit. Ca2+-depleted (apo)CaM is pre-associated with a variety of ion channels for fast and effective regulation of channel activities upon Ca2+ influx. Using the NR1 C0 region for fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy studies we found that not only Ca2+-saturated CaM but also apoCaM bound to NR1 C0. In vitro interaction assays showed that apoCaM also binds specifically to full-length NR1 solubilized from rat brain and to the complete C terminus of the NR1 splice form that contains the C0 plus C2′ domain. The Ca2+-independent interaction of CaM was also observed with the isolated C-but not N-terminal fragment of calmodulin in the independent spectroscopic assays. Fluorescence polarization studies indicated that apoCaM associated via its C-terminal domain with NR1 C0 in an extended conformation and collapsed to adopt a more compact conformation of faster rotational mobility in its complex with NR1 C0 upon addition of Ca2+. Our results indicate that apoCaM is associated with NR1 and that the complex of CaM bound to NR1 C0 undergoes a dramatic conformational change when Ca2+ binds to CaM.

Glutamate is the prevailing excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain.

NMDA receptors in the cerebral cortex largely consist of two NR1 and two or three NR2A and 2B subunits, which are homologous to each other (1.Seeburg P.H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 297-303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 2.Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Annu. Rev.

Each subunit has an extracellular N terminus, four membrane regions (M1–4), and an intracellular C terminus. M1, M3, and M4 are transmembrane regions but M2 loops into and back out of the plasma membrane at its cytoplasmic face. The C-terminal domain of NR1 contains the 30 residue-long membrane-proximal C0 region common to all NR1 isoforms, followed in some NR1 isoforms by the C1 region (37 residues), which can be spliced in or out, and by either the C2 (38 residues) or the C2′ (22 residues) region, which is downstream of C2 in the genome. The C2 region can be spliced out but, when present, C2′ will not be translated because C2 carries its own stop codon. In a negative feedback loop calmodulin (CaM) inhibits Ca2+ influx through the NMDA receptor by strongly binding to the NR1 C0 region in the presence of Ca2+ (5.Ehlers M.D. Zhang S. Bernhardt J.P. Huganir R.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 745-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 6.Zhang S. Ehlers M.D. Bernhardt J.P. Su C.T. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1998; 21: 443-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The same region interacts with α-actinin, which can be displaced by Ca42+-CaM (7.Wyszynski M. Lin J.

J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48441-48448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Displacement of α-actinin appears to reduce NMDA receptor activity by increasing desensitization, i.e. closing of the receptor pore while the agonist is still present (9.Krupp J.J. Vissel B. Thomas C.G. Heinemann S.F. Westbrook G.L. J Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1165-1178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Ca42+-CaM-mediated negative feedback mechanism may help to reduce the otherwise uncontrolled Ca2+ influx through the NMDA receptor during ischemia as occurs during stroke and other pathological conditions (10.Lee J.-M. Zipfel G.J. Choi D.W. Nature. 1999; 399: A7-A14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Rothman S.M. Olney J.W. Trends Neurosci. 1987; 10: 299-302Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). Ischemia triggers a massive release of glutamate from neurons, which results in over-activation of NMDA receptors. The ensuing unchecked Ca2+ influx ultimately leads to neuronal dysfunction and death. CaM constitutes the major Ca2+ sensor in eukaryotes and is ubiquitously expressed. It spans 148 residues and consists of an N- and a C-terminal domain, each containing two EF-hand Ca2+ binding sites (I–IV). It is highly conserved with only 3 residues differing between Drosophila and man. Ca2+ binds cooperatively, with sites III and IV in the C-domain usually having a 10-fold higher affinity than sites I and II in the N-domain. Ca2+ binding induces rearrangement of the tertiary structure of each domain, stabilizing the exposure of hydrophobic clefts. These surfaces promote the association of CaM with a wide array of target proteins including kinases, phosphatases, ion channels, esterases, and metabolic enzymes (12.Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Cell. 2002; 108: 739-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 13.Saimi Y. Kung C. Annu. Rev.

Early genetic studies of avoidance reactions of Paramecium led to the realization that (a) CaM was a subunit of two classes of ion channels in those organisms and (b) the two domains of CaM had separable roles in regulating ion channels (15.Kink J.A. Maley M.E. Preston R.R. Ling K.Y. Wallen-Friedman M.A. Saimi Y. Kung C. Cell. 1990; 62: 165-174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 16.Kung C. Preston R.R. Maley M.E. Ling K.Y. Kanabrocki J.A. Seavey B.R. Saimi Y. Cell Calcium. 1992; 13: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Out of more than a dozen mutants, those that disrupted Ca2+-dependent K+-channel regulation in Paramecium and caused an exaggerated response to a chemical stimulus all mapped to the C-domain: either within sites III and IV (e.g. S101F, H135R) or to the terminal helix in that domain (e.g. M145V). In contrast, regulatory mutations that hindered Ca2+-dependent Na+-channel regulation, causing an abbreviated response to negative stimuli, mapped to positions in the N-domain of CaM, primarily between sites I and II (e.g. G40E, E54K) (15.Kink J.A. Maley M.E. Preston R.R. Ling K.Y. Wallen-Friedman M.A. Saimi Y. Kung C. Cell. 1990; 62: 165-174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 16.Kung C. Preston R.R. Maley M.E. Ling K.Y. Kanabrocki J.A. Seavey B.R. Saimi Y. Cell Calcium. 1992; 13: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The effects of the mutations on Ca2+ binding were different: mutations in sites III and IV diminished Ca2+ binding while all other mutations had little effect (17.VanScyoc W.S. Shea M.A. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1758-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 18.Jaren O.R. Harmon S. Chen A.F. Shea M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6881-6890Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Because all of the N-domain mutants exhibited Ca2+ binding affinities similar to those of wild type, it appeared that the physiological defects caused by these mutations were likely to be related to target binding properties (17.VanScyoc W.S. Shea M.A. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1758-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 18.Jaren O.R. Harmon S. Chen A.F. Shea M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6881-6890Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Studies of these mutants binding to a helical peptide showed that all of the mutants could bind under apo (Ca2+-depleted) conditions and also suggested that CaM may engage in a stepwise Ca2+-dependent association of its domains with a target (19.Sorensen B.R. Eppel J.T. Shea M.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 896-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Such a mechanism contradicted the long held view of CaM as an “all-or-none” regulator of target proteins, “on” in the presence of Ca2+ and “off” in its absence. In fact, it is now known that CaM interactions vary greatly between its many targets (Fig. 1) (12.Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Cell. 2002; 108: 739-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 14.Vetter S.W. Leclerc E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 404-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar).

Cell. 1996; 84: 745-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) suggested that the interaction of CaM with NR1 C0 only occurs in the presence of Ca2+ (5.Ehlers M.D. Zhang S. Bernhardt J.P. Huganir R.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 745-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) raising the possibility that the NMDA receptor may be an exception to this rule. Such an exception would be critical because it would question the general relevance of pre-association of CaM with various ion channels for fast and effective signaling. Therefore and because of the central role the NMDA receptor plays during ischemia-triggered neuronal damage and the antagonistic effect of Ca42+-CaM on NMDA receptor activity we want to gain a better understanding of the molecular interplay between CaM and NR1. We investigated whether Ca2+-depleted (apo)CaM is pre-associated with the NMDA receptor. In the earlier study by Ehlers et al. (5.Ehlers M.D. Zhang S. Bernhardt J.P. Huganir R.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 745-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) CaM binding under Ca2+-depleted conditions had only been studied by pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays, during which protein-protein interactions with an off-rate in the minute range may be lost. We employed several spectroscopic methods to study CaM association with a peptide spanning most of the NR1 C0 region (NR1C0p; residues 838–865) under Ca2+-depleted (apo) and Ca2+-saturating conditions. Fluorescence and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy provided strong evidence for association of CaM with NR1C0p not only in the presence of Ca2+ but also under apo conditions. ApoCaM also bound specifically to the full-length NR1 subunit isolated from rat brain and to a GST fusion protein of the C terminus of the C0-C2′ splice form of NR1 when a fast washing protocol was used. Experiments with isolated domain fragments of CaM further indicated that the C-but not the N-domain of CaM selectively interacts with NR1C0p under apo conditions. Fluorescence anisotropy of NR1C0p in the presence of saturating concentrations of apoCaM is larger than in the presence of Ca42+-CaM demonstrating that the rotational mobility of NR1C0p is lower when bound to apoCaM than to Ca42+-CaM. These results suggest that apoCaM is pre-associated with NR1 C0 via its C-domain and that Ca2+ induces the bind of the N-domain to NR1 C0. The latter interaction results in a CaM-NR1C0p complex that is more compact than the apoCaM-containing complex. Materials—Fluorescein-labeled NR1 C0 peptide (NR1C0p; Fluorescein-SRHKDARRKQMQLAFAAVNVWRKNLQDR) was custom-synthesized by the W. M. Keck Biotechnology Resource Center, Yale University (New Haven, CT), and purified by HPLC. NR1C0p corresponded to residues 838–865 of NR1, containing a single tryptophan residue at its position 21. A biotinylated form of a peptide with a nearly identical sequence (biotin-NR1C0p: biotin-RHKDARRKQMQLAFAAVNVWRKNLQ) was obtained from the same source. Recombinant rat calmodulin (CaM1–148) and N- and C-domain fragments (CaM1–80 and CaM76–148, respectively) were overexpressed in Escherichia coli using the pT7-7 vector in Lys-S cells (U. S. Biochemicals, Cleveland, OH) (27.Sorensen B.R. Shea M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4244-4253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purification was performed on phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences) (28.Putkey J.A. Slaughter G.R. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4704-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant proteins were characterized by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by silver staining (29.Pedigo S. Shea M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10676-10689Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). CaM samples were depleted of Ca2+ by successive dialyzes at 4 °C against 50 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm NTA, with 5 mm EGTA and then against the same buffer containing only 0.05 mm EGTA. Fluorescence Emission Wavelength Scans—Fluorescence emission studies were performed with an SLM-4800 spectrofluorimeter (SLM, Urbana, IL) with a Xenon short arc lamp (Ushio, Inc.), using 8 nm bandpasses with NR1C0p (2.54 μm) and CaM (∼2.3 μm) for Trp fluorescence, and a Fluorolog 3 spectrofluorimeter (Jobin Yvon, Horiba) with a 450 watt xenon lamp using 3 nm bandpasses with NR1C0p (0.22 μm) and CaM (∼2.5 μm) for fluorescein fluorescence. Emission spectra of NR1C0p were obtained at λex of 297 nm for tryptophan and λex of 496 nm for fluorescein. The following buffer conditions were used: 50 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.05 mm EGTA, 5 mm NTA, ±10 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, 22 °C. Data were corrected for contributions from the buffer but not corrected for instrument response. Each experiment was repeated at least three times with consistent results. Circular Dichroism—CD spectra were collected with an Aviv 62DS CD instrument using 2-s increments, a 1.5-nm bandpass, and 0.5-nm wavelength spacing from 260 to 215 nm. CD spectra were recorded in a quartz cuvette (1-cm pathlength) with 6 μm recombinant CaM or its fragments and 10.24 μm or 13.54 μm NR1C0p. The following buffer conditions were used: 2 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.05 mm EGTA, 5 mm, ±10 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4 22 °C. Each experiment was repeated three times under both conditions. In each individual experiment, readings from three successive scans were averaged, and data were corrected for contribution from buffer. To observe changes in the ellipticity of biotin-NR1C0p, CD spectra were collected using 0.5-nm step size and 1.0-nm bandwidth in a 1-cm quartz cuvette at 22 °C. Ellipticity of 120 μm biotin-NR1C0p was monitored in ddH2O with increasing fractional concentrations (v/v) of TFE (2,2,2-trifluoro-ethanol; Sigma Chemicals). Fluorescence Anisotropy—Fluorescence anisotropy was measured using a Fluorolog 3 (Jobin Yvon, Horiba) spectrofluorimeter with an 8-nm bandpass. Fluorescein fluorescence was detected at λex of 496 nm and λem of 520 nm. Anisotropy R was calculated with r = (IVV-G × IVH)/(IVV + 2 × GIVH)[IVV and IVH: intensity of vertically or horizontally emitted light, respectively, when vertically excited; IHV and IHH: intensity of vertically or horizontally emitted light, respectively, when horizontally excited; G = IHV/IHH]. Three readings were taken for each measurement and averages calculated and recorded. Each signal was monitored for 2 s. Buffer consisted of 50 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.05 mm EGTA, 5 mm NTA, pH 7.4, 22 °C. Aliquots were added from concentrated apoCaM samples (0.5–1.2 mm) to titrate NR1C0p with a starting concentration of 0.22 μm; the total dilution of the NR1C0p solution in the cuvette was <3% over the course of the titrations. To determine the affinity of apoCaM1–148 and apoCaM76–148 for NR1C0p, the anisotropy data from the titration curves with increasing amounts of CaM shown in Fig. 6, A and C were fit to a simple binding model, treating the peptide-CaM complex as having a 1:1 stoichiometry. Fractional saturation of the peptide by CaM was represented as Y = (Ka[X])/(1 + Ka[X]) (29.Pedigo S. Shea M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10676-10689Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), where Ka represents the intrinsic association constant (Ka = 1/Kd) for CaM binding to NR1C0p and [X] is the CaM concentration. Titration curves were analyzed with NONLIN (30.Johnson M.L. Frasier S.G. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 117: 301-342Crossref Scopus (507) Google Scholar). The abscissa in Fig. 6 is shown on a log scale. To indicate the value of anisotropy in the absence of apoCaM (i.e. at 0 m), the abscissa value was chosen arbitrarily to be 5 × 10-8m; fitting was done using the actual value. For the second phase of these experiments (right panels in Fig. 6), the final solution of the titration of NR1C0p with apoCaM was titrated subsequently with 10 mm CaCl2 in 50 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.05 mm EGTA, 5 mm NTA, pH 7.4, 22 °C. The abscissa represents the total concentration of Ca2+ added; the concentration of free Ca2+ would be lower because of competition between CaM and the EGTA used to deplete the sample of calcium initially. Each experiment was repeated at least three times with consistent results. Pull-down of CaM with Purified NR1 and GST-NR1C0-C2′—NR1 and the AMPA-type glutamate receptor subunit GluR1 were solubilized from crude rat forebrain membrane fractions and immunoisolated as described (31.Leonard A.S.

This procedure efficiently extracts GluR1 and NR1 from the membranes and dissociates NR1 from NR2 subunits and GluR1 from the other AMPA receptor subunits (i.e. GluR2 and GluR3; Refs. 31.Leonard A.S.

Samples were washed twice as fast as possible, usually for a total of 1.5–2 min, with HEPES buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 10 mm CaCl2 if present during the incubation with CaM. The proteins were extracted using standard SDS sample buffer (31.Leonard A.S. Hell J.W. J. Biol.

After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were cut into half, the upper portion probed with anti-NR1, stripped, and re-probed with anti-GluR1 (31.Leonard A.S. Hell J.W. J. Biol.

The samples were washed three times with HEPES buffer, incubated with 0.1–50 μm purified CaM (Sigma) in HEPES buffer ± 10 mm CaCl2 for 2 h at 4 °C, and washed two times as quickly as possible (1.5–2 min total time) with HEPES buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and also CaCl2 if the latter was present during the incubation with CaM. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting was performed as described above. Quantification of the CaM immunosignals was conducted by determining the mean density as measured by Adobe Photoshop after digitizing exposed films with a UMAX UTA1100 scanner. CaM regulates the activity of a variety of ion channels including voltage-gated K+ channels (20.Xia X.M. Fakler B. Rivard A. Wayman G. Johnson-Pais T. Keen J.E. Ishii T. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T.

Cell. 1996; 84: 745-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). In the presence of Ca2+, CaM inhibits NMDA receptor activity via its interaction with the C0 region in the cytosolic C terminus of the NR1 subunit (5.Ehlers M.D. Zhang S. Bernhardt J.P. Huganir R.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 745-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 6.Zhang S. Ehlers M.D. Bernhardt J.P. Su C.T. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1998; 21: 443-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The previous biochemical characterization of the CaM-NMDA receptor interaction suggested that CaM binding to the NR1 C0 region strictly requires Ca2+ (5.Ehlers M.D. Zhang S. Bernhardt J.P. Huganir R.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 745-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). This conclusion relied on pull-down experiments, in which an interaction that is specific but has a fast off-rate would be lost. Because apoCaM is associated with other ion channels for fast and efficient signaling, we investigated with complementary spectroscopic methods and pull-down assays whether CaM may be able to interact in a similar Ca2+-independent manner with NR1 C0. Tryptophan Fluorescence of NR1C0p—Because CaM does not have a tryptophan, the fluorescent properties of tryptophan at position 21 (Trp-21) of the NR1C0p peptides can be utilized to detect changes in its immediate environment that occur when the peptide binds to CaM. The NR1C0p tryptophan was effectively excited at 297 nm; at this wavelength contribution by tyrosine or phenylalanine to the fluorescence signal is minimal. The resulting emission spectrum of the NR1C0p had a λmax of 350 nm in the absence of CaM (Fig. 2 A–F, black traces). Addition of full-length CaM1–148 to NR1C0p changed the emission spectrum of Trp-21 of NR1C0p not only under Ca2+-saturating (Fig. 2A) but also under Ca2+-depleted conditions (Fig. 2D). There was a blue-shift (to lower wavelength) in λmax of the emission spectrum by slightly less than 20 nm under Ca2+-depleted conditions and slightly more than 20 nm under Ca2+-saturating conditions. At the same time the maximal intensity of the emission signals increased by about 2- and 4-fold, respectively. These findings suggest that apoCaM as well as Ca42+-CaM can interact with NR1C0p. To investigate whether the N- or C-domain of CaM is necessary or sufficient for interaction with NR1C0p under apo or Ca2+-saturated conditions, we used recombinant purified CaM1–80 (N-domain followed by the linker region) and CaM76–148 (C-domain preceded by the linker region) for similar measurements. Both fragments bound to NR1C0p in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 2, E and F). A shift of slightly less than ∼20 nm in λmax was observed upon addition of the N- as well as the C-domain. CaM76–148, but not CaM1–80, also interacted with the peptide under Ca2+-depleted conditions (Fig. 2, B and C). Binding of the apo C-domain caused a shift of λmax by ∼10 nm to 340 nm and a modest increase in the maximal intensity of"

Magnesium ions enhance farnesylation catalyzed by FTase by several hundred-fold, with a KMg value of 4 mm. The magnesium ion is proposed to coordinate the diphosphate leaving group of farnesyldiphosphate (FPP) to stabilize the developing charge in the farnesylation transition state. Here we further investigate the magnesium binding site using mutagenesis and biochemical studies. Free FPP binds Mg2+ with a Kd of 120 μm. The 10-fold weaker affinity for Mg2+ observed for the FTase·FPP·peptide ternary complex is probably caused by the positive charges in the diphosphate binding pocket of FTase. Furthermore, mutation of aspartate β352 to alanine (Dβ352A) or lysine (Dβ352K) in FTase drastically alters the Mg2+ dependence of FTase catalysis without dramatically affecting the rate constant of farnesylation minus magnesium or the binding affinity of either substrate. In Dβ352A FTase, the KMg increases 28-fold to 110 ± 30 mm, and the farnesylation rate constant at saturating Mg2+ decreases 27-fold to 0.30 ± 0.05 s-1. Substitution of a lysine for Asp-β352 removes the magnesium activation of farnesylation catalyzed by FTase but does not significantly enhance the rate constant for farnesylation in the absence of Mg2+. In wild type FTase, Mg2+ can be replaced by Mn2+ with a 2-fold lower KMn (2 mm). These results suggest both that Mg2+ coordinates the side chain carboxylate of Asp-β352 and that the role of magnesium in the reaction includes positioning the FPP prior to catalysis.

Farnesylation is just one type of protein prenylation; proteins can also be modified with geranylgeranyl groups in a reaction catalyzed by geranylgeranyl transferase type I or type II (GGTase I and GGTase II) (11Yokoyama K. Goodwin G.W. Ghomashchi F. Glomset J.A. Gelb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5302-5306Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 12Seabra M.C. Goldstein J.L. Sudhof T.C. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14497-14503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GGTase I also recognizes protein substrates with a C-terminal CaaX motif, but GGTase I substrates most frequently contain a leucine or phenylalanine at the X position (13Yokoyama K. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4055-4060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Finegold A.A. Johnson D.I. Farnsworth C.C. Gelb M.H. Judd S.R. Glomset J.A. Tamanoi F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Reiss Y. Casey P.J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1991; 65: 429-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Prenyltransferases contain an active site zinc ion that is required for activity; FTase and GGTase II also use a magnesium ion to facilitate catalysis (16Huang C.-c. Casey P.J. Fierke C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 17Reiss Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol.

Poulter C.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10454-10463Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, GGTase I apparently catalyzes the same prenyl transfer reaction with no dependence on magnesium ions (20Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 925-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In FTase, the magnesium ion has been proposed to coordinate to the diphosphate of FPP, but the exact location of the magnesium binding site has not yet been identified (21Saderholm M.J. Hightower K.E. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12398-12405Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The bound zinc ion of FTase coordinates to the cysteine sulfur of the protein substrate, lowering the pKa to form a zinc-thiolate at neutral pH (22Hightower K.E. Huang C.-c. Casey P.J. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15555-15562Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 23Rozema D.B. Poulter C.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13138-13146Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the proposed farnesylation transition state of FTase (Scheme 1), positive charge accumulates on the C-1 of FPP, and the diphosphate leaving group develops additional negative charge (24Huang C. Hightower K.E. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2593-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 25Dolence J.M. Poulter C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5008-5011Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Bound magnesium is proposed to stabilize the negative charge buildup on the diphosphate moiety and activate the leaving group (21Saderholm M.J. Hightower K.E. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12398-12405Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although magnesium is not absolutely required for FTase catalysis, millimolar concentrations of magnesium ions enhance the rate constant for product formation by 700-fold (24Huang C. Hightower K.E. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2593-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Several pieces of experimental evidence indicate that the diphosphate of FPP forms part of the magnesium binding site. X-ray crystallography of the FTase ternary complex in the presence of manganese showed a manganese ion bound near the diphosphate-like moiety of a FPP analog (26Long S.P. Casey P.J. Beese L.S. Structure. 2000; 8: 209-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Also, the FTase-catalyzed farnesylation using farnesylmonophosphate (FMP) as a substrate is not activated by magnesium ions, indicating that the diphosphate moiety is required for magnesium-induced rate acceleration (21Saderholm M.J. Hightower K.E. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12398-12405Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition, the apparent magnesium affinity increases with increasing pH with a pKa of 7.4, which is consistent with deprotonation of farnesyldiphosphate to enhance magnesium coordination (21Saderholm M.J. Hightower K.E. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12398-12405Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, other aspects of FTase catalysis indicate that the magnesium binding site may consist of more than the diphosphate of FPP. The magnesium dependence of the reaction has a KMg of 2 mm, which is a weaker affinity than one would predict for a magnesium-diphosphate interaction (21Saderholm M.J. Hightower K.E. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12398-12405Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Also, if the magnesium interacts only with the diphosphate, one would predict that the GGTase I-catalyzed reaction should also be magnesium-dependent, since geranylgeranyldiphosphate would presumably have an affinity for magnesium that is similar to FPP. Analysis of binary FTase·FPP crystal structures and inactive ternary FTase·FPP·peptide crystal structures (27Long S.B. Casey P.J. Beese L.S.

In the crystal structure of an inactive FTase ternary complex with bound manganese, the only manganese ligands observed were the two oxygens of the diphosphate-like moiety of the FPP analog (26Long S.P. Casey P.J. Beese L.S. Structure. 2000; 8: 209-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In most enzymes that use a catalytic magnesium ion, there is at least one carboxylate ligand from the enzyme that coordinates the magnesium ion in the active site (29Black C.B. Huang H.W. Cowan J.A. Coord. Chem. Rev. 1994; 135: 165-202Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 30Cowan J.A. BioMetals. 2002; 15: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). In the class I terpenoid synthase enzymes, which catalyze a prenyl transfer reaction, there is an aspartate-rich region of the enzyme active site, often a DDXXD motif, that binds the magnesium ion (31Starks C.M.

In FTase, the diphosphate moiety of FPP is surrounded by residues Lys-α164, His-β248, Arg-β291, Lys-β294, and Tyr-β300 (26Long S.P. Casey P.J. Beese L.S.

These side chains create a hydrogen bonding network around the diphosphate and create a pocket of positive charge that should repel a divalent cation. In the crystal structures of inactive ternary complexes of FTase, including the structure with bound manganese, the two reacting atoms, the C-1 of FPP and the peptide thiolate, are 7 Å apart, reflecting an inactive conformation (Fig. 1) (26Long S.P. Casey P.J. Beese L.S. Structure. 2000; 8: 209-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 28Strickland C.L. Windsor W.T. Syto R. Wang L. Bond R. Wu Z. Schwartz J. Le H.V.

A. 2001; 98: 12948-12953Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). An x-ray crystal structure of the FTase·product complex and mutagenesis studies of the diphosphate binding pocket suggest that an active structure may by achieved by a conformational change of FPP in which the first two prenyl groups rotate (37Long S.B. Casey P.J. Beese L.S. Nature. 2002; 419: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 38Pickett J.S. Bowers K.E. Hartman H.L. Fu H.-W. Embry A.C. Casey P.J. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9741-9748Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). When this active conformation of FPP bound to FTase is modeled (38Pickett J.S. Bowers K.E. Hartman H.L. Fu H.-W. Embry A.C. Casey P.J. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9741-9748Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the C-1 of FPP moves to within 2.4 Å of the peptide sulfur nucleophile. Furthermore, the diphosphate moiety moves slightly away from the positively charged diphosphate binding pocket and toward aspartate β352. This amino acid has not been previously studied by mutagenesis because it is not conserved in all prenyltransferases and is located ∼7 Å away from the FPP substrate in the ternary complex crystal structures (Fig. 1). In FTase and GGTase II, an aspartate is conserved across all organisms at position 352 (FTase) and 280 (GGTase II), whereas GGTase I has a conserved lysine at the corresponding position 311 (39Dolence J.M. Rozema D.B. Poulter C.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9246-9252Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Long et al. (37Long S.B. Casey P.J. Beese L.S. Nature. 2002; 419: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) proposed that this lysine residue in GGTase I replaces magnesium in the geranylgeranylation reaction by appropriate placement of a positive charge. Therefore, the analogous aspartate residues are proposed to function as magnesium ligands in FTase and GGTase II. In this study, we examine the role of Asp-β352 in magnesium binding through mutagenesis and biochemical experiments. These data demonstrate that the FTase·FPP·peptide ternary complex has a weaker affinity for magnesium than FPP alone in solution, indicating that the protein side chains modulate the magnesium affinity of the diphosphate moiety. Mutation of Asp-β352 to Ala has no effect on the rate constant for product formation in the absence of magnesium; however, the apparent magnesium affinity, KMg, decreases 28-fold, and the magnesium-activated farnesylation rate constant decreases 27-fold. The farnesylation rate constant catalyzed by the Dβ352K mutant is not enhanced by the addition of magnesium ions. Furthermore, the positive charge of the lysine side chain does not substitute for Mg2+ to enhance the farnesylation rate constant. Manganese, although more electrophilic, has only a modestly enhanced affinity for the FTase ternary complex than magnesium. In summary, these data provide evidence that at least one FTase side chain, Asp-β352, coordinates a catalytic Mg2+ in addition to coordination by the substrate diphosphate. Furthermore, the positively charged groups in the diphosphate binding pocket of FTase decrease the Mg2+ affinity of FPP more than 10-fold. Finally, the formation of the catalytic magnesium site is coupled to the formation of the active substrate conformation of FPP bound to FTase, where the diphosphate of FPP moves out of the diphosphate binding pocket toward Asp-β352, whereas C-1 of FPP moves within reacting distance of the zinc thiolate (37Long S.B. Casey P.J. Beese L.S. Nature. 2002; 419: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 38Pickett J.S. Bowers K.E. Hartman H.L. Fu H.-W. Embry A.C. Casey P.J. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9741-9748Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Therefore, Mg2+ may accelerate catalysis both by stabilizing developing negative charge in the transition state and by stabilizing the active site conformation prior to catalysis. Miscellaneous Methods—All assays were performed at 25 °C. All curve fitting was performed with Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software). [3H]FPP was purchased from Amersham Biosciences, vacuum-dried, washed with 100% methanol, and resuspended in 20 mm Heppso, pH 7.8, 0.5 mm 3-14 zwittergent, to a final concentration of 20 μm. [3H]FMP was obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). The peptides GCVLS and dansylated GCVLS were synthesized and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography by Bethyl Laboratories, Inc. (Montgomery, TX) and the University of Michigan Peptide Core (Ann Arbor, MI), respectively. The concentration of peptide was determined spectroscopically at 412 nm by reaction of the cysteine thiol with 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), using an extinction coefficient of 14,150 m-1 cm-1 (40Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 94: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). FTase concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 150,000 m-1 cm-1 (41Wu Z. Demma M. Strickland C.L. Syto R. Le H.V. Windsor W.T. Weber P.C. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Farnesyl protein transferase inhibitor II (I2) was purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. TLC plates were prerun in 100% acetone before use. Magnesium Binding Affinity for FPP—The affinity of the diphosphate of FPP for Mg2+ in the absence of enzyme was determined by competition assays in which the fluorescence of the Mg2+·8-hydroxyquinoline-5-sulfonic acid (HQS) complex decreases as the concentration of FPP increases, due to the formation of the nonfluorescent Mg2+·FPP complex. Increasing concentrations of FPP (0-2 mm) were titrated into a cuvette containing 30 μm MgCl2 and 240 μm HQS in 50 mm Tris, pH 8, buffer. The fluorescence of the Mg2+·HQS was measured with an excitation wavelength of 390 nm and an emission wavelength of 500 nm (42Soroka K. Vithanage R.S. Phillips D.A. Walker B. Dasgupta P.K. Anal. Chem. 1987; 59: 629-636Crossref Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 43Popovich O. Rogers L.B. Spectrochim. Acta. 1960; 16: 49-57Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The dissociation constant for magnesium binding to FPP was determined by fitting Equation 1 to the data, where ΔFL represents the observed fluorescence, IF is the initial fluorescence, EP is the fluorescence end point, KDMg is the dissociation constant for Mg2+ binding to FPP, and KHQS is the dissociation constant for Mg2+ binding to HQS. The KHQS was determined to be 240 μm by measuring the dependence of fluorescence on the magnesium concentration (not shown).ΔFL=IF1+KHQS[HQS](1+[Mg2+]KDMg)+EP(Eq. 1) Preparation of FTase—Mutagenesis of the FPT/pET23a plasmid (44Zimmerman K.A. Scholten J.D. Huang C. Fierke C.A. Hupe D.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 14: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) was performed using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the following codon changes: Dβ352A, GAC to GCC; and Dβ352K, GAC to AAA. The changes were confirmed by DNA sequencing (University of Michigan DNA Sequencing Core). Recombinant rat FTase was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells and purified as described previously (38Pickett J.S. Bowers K.E. Hartman H.L. Fu H.-W. Embry A.C. Casey P.J. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9741-9748Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 44Zimmerman K.A. Scholten J.D. Huang C. Fierke C.A. Hupe D.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 14: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). After each column, the protein fractions were tested for FTase activity in a 96-well plate assay as described (38Pickett J.S. Bowers K.E. Hartman H.L. Fu H.-W. Embry A.C. Casey P.J. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9741-9748Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The purified FTase was determined by SDS-PAGE to be >90% pure. The protein was dialyzed against HT buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 1 mm TCEP), concentrated to 40 μm, and frozen at -80 °C. Transient Kinetics—Single turnover assays were performed for FTase mutants Dβ352A and Dβ352K at varying magnesium or manganese concentrations in 50 mm Heppso, pH 7.8, as described previously (21Saderholm M.J. Hightower K.E. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12398-12405Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The MgCl2 or MnCl2 concentration was varied from 0.01 to 60 mm. The ionic strength in the reactions was kept constant at 0.2 m with the addition of NaCl, and 1 mm TCEP was included as a reductant. Reactions with farnesylation rate constants of less than 0.1 s-1 were performed manually using 0.8 μm FTase, 0.4 μm [3H]FPP, and 100 μm GCVLS (8-μl reaction volume). FTase was preincubated with [3H]FPP for 15 min, and then the reaction was initiated by the addition of GCVLS. The reactions were quenched at varying times (3 s to 3 h) by the addition of 8 μl of cold isopropyl alcohol and placed on ice. For reactions with product formation rate constants faster than 0.1 s-1, a KinTek rapid quench apparatus was used (KinTek Corp., Austin, TX). The 30-μl reactions contained 0.2 μm FTase, 0.1 μm [3H]FPP, and 100 μm GCVLS. The reactions were quenched with 80% isopropyl alcohol, 20% acetic acid at varying times (0.005-600 s) then dried under vacuum and resuspended in 50% isopropyl alcohol. The product was separated from substrate by thin layer chromatography on polyester-backed silica gel plates (Whatman PE SIL G) with an 8:1:1 (v/v/v) isopropyl alcohol/NH4OH/H2O mobile phase. The product migrates in this mobile phase, but the FPP substrate remains at the origin, so the plates were cut accordingly, and the radioactivity was quantified by scintillation counting. The radioactivity in the product was divided by the total radioactivity for each time point to calculate the fraction of product formed. The rate constant for product formation (kobs) was determined by fitting Equation 2 to these data, where Pt is the product formed at time t, and P∞ is the calculated reaction end point, which varied from 65 to 90%.PtP∞=1-e-kobst(Eq. 2) The magnesium or manganese dependence was determined by plotting the kobs against the metal concentration and fitting Equation 3 to the data. KMg (KMn) represents the apparent dissociation constant, kmaxMg(kmaxMn) is the rate constant of the reaction at saturating metal concentration, and k0 is the rate constant of the reaction in the absence of magnesium or manganese.kobs=kmaxMg1+KMg/[Mg2+]+k0(Eq. 3) Steady State Kinetics—Steady state kinetic assays were performed with 24 nm wild type or mutant FTase, 1 μm [3H]FPP, and 10 μm GCVLS in 50 mm Heppso, pH 7.8, 1 mm TCEP, and 5 mm MgCl2 as described previously (24Huang C. Hightower K.E. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2593-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, both substrates are saturating, and a linear fit of the first 10% of the reaction reflects kcat. Reaction with FMP—The reactions with [3H]FMP were measured at pH 6.1, the optimum pH of the reaction for wild type FTase (21Saderholm M.J. Hightower K.E. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12398-12405Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The assays were done as described above for [3H]FPP, with 50 mm Mes, pH 6.1, in place of 50 mm Heppso, pH 7.8, as the buffer. The TLC plates were run in a 7:2:1 (v/v/v) isopropyl alcohol/NH4OH/H2O mobile phase and treated as described above for the reaction with FPP. Equation 2 was fit to these data. Peptide Binding Affinity—The affinity of the D352β mutants for the peptide substrate was determined as previously described by measuring the affinity of FTase·I2 for dansyl-GCVLS (Dns-GCVLS) (22Hightower K.E. Huang C.-c. Casey P.J. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15555-15562Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The binding of Dns-GCVLS to FTase was observed by fluorescence resonance energy transfer, where the tryptophan residues of FTase are excited at 280 nm and the bound dansyl group emits at 496 nm. The samples were prepared with 50 mm Heppso, pH 7.3, 2 mm TCEP, 1 mm MgCl2, 40 nm I2, 20 nm Dβ352A or Dβ352K FTase, and 10 nm EDTA. The ionic strength of the samples was maintained at 0.1 m with NaCl. The sample was preincubated for 15 min and then aliquots of Dns-GCVLS (0-4 μm) were added with a 2-min stirred and a 1-min unstirred incubation prior to each measurement. A weighted fit of Equation 4 to the data yielded the apparent dissociation constants, where ΔFL represents the observed fluorescence corrected for background, EP is the fluorescence end point, IF is the initial fluorescence, [Pep] is the concentration of Dns-GCVLS, and KDpep is the dissociation constant for Dns-GCVLS.ΔFL=EP(1+KDpep/[Pep])+IF(Eq. 4) FPP Binding Affinity—The affinity of FPP for D352β mutant FTase was determined by equilibrium dialysis as previously described (24Huang C. Hightower K.E. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2593-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 44Zimmerman K.A. Scholten J.D. Huang C. Fierke C.A. Hupe D.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 14: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A 1-ml solution of 10-200 nm Dβ352A or Dβ352K FTase was preincubated with 20 nm [3H]FPP for 3 h at room temperature in buffer (50 mm Heppso, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm TCEP). This solution was then dialyzed against 1 ml of the same buffer using a SpectraPor 25,000 molecular weight cut-off dialysis membrane. After 22 h, the radioactivity in several 100-μl samples from both sides of the membrane was determined by sc"
https://openalex.org/W2054063234,"To investigate the involvement of transmembrane segment 7 (TMS7) of hPepT1 in forming the putative central aqueous channel through which the substrate traverses, we individually mutated each of the 21 amino acids in TMS7 to a cysteine and analyzed the mutated transporters using the scanning cysteine accessibility method. Y287C- and M292C-hPepT1 did not express at the plasma membrane. Out of the remaining 19 transporters, three (F293C-, L296C-, and F297C-hPepT1) showed negligible glycyl-sarcosine (gly-sar) uptake activity and may play an important role in defining the overall hPepT1 structure. K278C-hPepT1 showed ∼40% activity and the 15 other transporters exhibited more than 50% gly-sar uptake when compared with wild type (WT)-hPepT1. Gly-sar uptake for the 16 active transporters containing cysteine mutations was then measured in the presence of 2.5 mm 2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide (MTSEA) or 1 mm [2-(trimethylammonium) ethyl] methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET). Gly-sar uptake was significantly inhibited for each of the 16 single cysteine mutants in the presence of 2.5 mm MTSEA. In contrast, significant inhibition of uptake was only observed for K278C-, M279C-, V280C-, T281C-, M284C-, L286C-, P291C-, and D298C-hPepT1 in the presence of 1 mm MTSET. MTSET modification of R282C-hPepT1 resulted in a significant increase in gly-sar uptake. To investigate this further, we mutated WT-hPepT1 to R282A-, R282E-, and R282K-hPepT1. R282E-hPepT1 showed a 43% reduction in uptake activity, whereas R282A- and R282K-hPepT1 had activities comparable with WT-hPepT1, suggesting a role for the Arg-282 positive charge in substrate translocation. Most of the amino acids that were MTSET-sensitive upon cysteine mutation, including R282C, are located toward the intracellular end of TMS7. Hence, our results suggest that TMS7 of hPepT1 is relatively solvent-accessible along most of its length but that the intracellular end of the transmembrane domain is particularly so. From a structure-function perspective, we speculate that the extracellular end of TMS7 may shift following substrate binding, providing the basis for channel opening and substrate translocation. To investigate the involvement of transmembrane segment 7 (TMS7) of hPepT1 in forming the putative central aqueous channel through which the substrate traverses, we individually mutated each of the 21 amino acids in TMS7 to a cysteine and analyzed the mutated transporters using the scanning cysteine accessibility method. Y287C- and M292C-hPepT1 did not express at the plasma membrane. Out of the remaining 19 transporters, three (F293C-, L296C-, and F297C-hPepT1) showed negligible glycyl-sarcosine (gly-sar) uptake activity and may play an important role in defining the overall hPepT1 structure. K278C-hPepT1 showed ∼40% activity and the 15 other transporters exhibited more than 50% gly-sar uptake when compared with wild type (WT)-hPepT1. Gly-sar uptake for the 16 active transporters containing cysteine mutations was then measured in the presence of 2.5 mm 2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide (MTSEA) or 1 mm [2-(trimethylammonium) ethyl] methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET). Gly-sar uptake was significantly inhibited for each of the 16 single cysteine mutants in the presence of 2.5 mm MTSEA. In contrast, significant inhibition of uptake was only observed for K278C-, M279C-, V280C-, T281C-, M284C-, L286C-, P291C-, and D298C-hPepT1 in the presence of 1 mm MTSET. MTSET modification of R282C-hPepT1 resulted in a significant increase in gly-sar uptake. To investigate this further, we mutated WT-hPepT1 to R282A-, R282E-, and R282K-hPepT1. R282E-hPepT1 showed a 43% reduction in uptake activity, whereas R282A- and R282K-hPepT1 had activities comparable with WT-hPepT1, suggesting a role for the Arg-282 positive charge in substrate translocation. Most of the amino acids that were MTSET-sensitive upon cysteine mutation, including R282C, are located toward the intracellular end of TMS7.

From a structure-function perspective, we speculate that the extracellular end of TMS7 may shift following substrate binding, providing the basis for channel opening and substrate translocation. The human dipeptide transporter, hPepT1, is a 708-amino acid protein containing 12 α-helical transmembrane segments. It is mainly expressed in the small intestine (1Liang R. Fei Y.J. Prasad P.D.

However, the rational design of drugs and prodrugs as substrates has been limited because the tertiary structure of the transporter has not yet been elucidated. Several attempts have been made to determine the nature of its substrate-binding site and proton-binding site (17Fei Y.J. Liu J.C. Fujita T. Liang R. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

However, experimental validation of this model is required in order to define the fine structure of the substrate-binding site and to understand the mechanism of substrate transport. transmembrane segment 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid methanethiosulfonate 2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide [2-(trimethylammonium) ethyl]methanethiosulfonate bromide phosphate-buffered saline glycyl-sarcosine wild type substituted cysteine accessibility method. transmembrane segment 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid methanethiosulfonate 2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide [2-(trimethylammonium) ethyl]methanethiosulfonate bromide phosphate-buffered saline glycyl-sarcosine wild type substituted cysteine accessibility method. The substituted cysteine accessibility method (SCAM) has been used successfully to study the fine structure of various ion channels and transporters and, in particular, to determine the portion of transmembrane segments that line the channel pore or solute pathway (21Sahin-Toth M. Kaback H.R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1024-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 22Javitch J.A. Li X. Kaback J. Karlin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This method involves scanning cysteine mutagenesis of a transmembrane domain followed by covalent modification with an aqueous-soluble cysteine-reactive reagent; usually a methanethiosulfonate (MTS). Substrate uptake is used as a measure of the extent of modification, and hence solvent accessibility, of a particular amino acid. This approach has been utilized to obtain critical insight into the structures of the Glut1 glucose transporter (25Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3498-3503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), dopamine D2 receptor (26Fu D. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Chen J. Javitch J.A.

Chem. 2001; 276: 10775-10781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In performing such studies, it is first of importance to determine the reactivity of endogenous cysteines with the cysteine-modifying reagents. We have shown previously that the 11 endogenous cysteines present in WT-hPepT1 either do not react with the MTS reagents or that their modification with the MTS reagents does not have a significant impact on hPepT1 activity (29Kulkarni A.A. Haworth I.S. Lee V.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 306: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This makes the application of SCAM to hPepT1 particularly appropriate. Indeed, we have recently shown that TMS5 is an integral part of the hPepT1 substrate translocation pathway by using a systematic cysteine-scanning mutagenesis approach in conjunction with MTS reagents (29Kulkarni A.A. Haworth I.S. Lee V.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 306: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These results suggested that TMS5 is slightly tilted from the vertical axis of the channel, with the exofacial half-forming a classical amphipathic α-helix and the cytoplasmic half being highly solvent-accessible (29Kulkarni A.A. Haworth I.S. Lee V.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 306: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To determine the contributions of TMS7 in forming a part of the hPepT1 substrate-binding region, we have used the same approach to evaluate the relative orientation, functional importance, and solvent accessibility of this transmembrane segment with respect to the aqueous channel through which the substrate is transported. Our cysteine-scanning data and further mutagenesis results for Arg-282 suggest that TMS7 is a relatively solvent-accessible transmembrane segment and is particularly so at its cytoplasmic end. Materials—[3H]Glycyl-sarcosine (4 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). Cell culture media and supplies were obtained from Invitrogen. 2-Aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide (MTSEA) and [2-(trimethylammonium) ethyl]methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET) were purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Site-directed Mutagenesis—The hPepT1 cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. Matthias A. Hedigar) was subcloned into the eukaryotic expression plasmid pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) by ligating the 2306 KpnI/BamHI fragment into the multiple cloning sites of pcDNA3. This pcDNA3-hPepT1 plasmid is under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. This plasmid was used as a template for all the mutagenesis reactions. The standard site-directed mutagenesis protocol provided by the manufacturer was followed using the Gene Editor™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). The mutated cDNA was transformed into an Escherichia coli strain, BMH71-18 Mut.S, which is incapable of correcting mismatches. This process of amplification was repeated once more using the JM109-competent cells to enrich the mutated population. The transformed cells were then plated onto ampicillin LB plates and incubated overnight. Individual colonies obtained on the ampicillin LB plates were amplified further. The plasmid extracted from each colony was then subjected to DNA sequencing analysis to verify the mutations (Genemed Synthesis Inc., San Francisco). Transient Transfection of the Mutants in HEK293 Cells—The transfection of hPepT1 in HEK293 cells (ATCC CRL-1573) has been reported previously (20Bolger M.B. Haworth I.S. Yeung A.K. Ann D. von Grafenstein H. Hamm-Alvarez S. Okamoto C.T. Kim K.J. Basu S.K. Wu S. Lee V.H. J. Pharm. Sci. 1998; 87: 1286-1291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These cells were used for the expression of WT-hPepT1 and the mutated transporters because of their low endogenous dipeptide transport activity. The uptake of [3H]gly-sar in WT-hPepT1-transfected HEK293 cells was 100 times higher than that in mock-transfected HEK293 cells (20Bolger M.B. Haworth I.S. Yeung A.K. Ann D. von Grafenstein H. Hamm-Alvarez S. Okamoto C.T. Kim K.J. Basu S.K. Wu S. Lee V.H. J. Pharm. Sci. 1998; 87: 1286-1291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The HEK293 cells were split into 60 × 15-mm dishes and grown overnight (>20 h) at 50-75% confluence. The medium was then removed, and 2 ml of transfection solution (2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 20 μl of DEAE-dextran (25 mg/ml) and 10 μl of chloroquine (20 mm)) was added to each dish. The mixture was then incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The transfection solution was prepared previously in a stock of 20 ml which was then divided into 10 portions (2 ml each); 1 μg of DNA was added to each portion, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. After removing the transfection solution, 2 ml of 10% Me2SO in DPBS (sterile PBS) was added to each dish. Following an incubation period of 2 min at room temperature, the Me2SO solution was removed and replaced by 4 ml of fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in each dish. The cells were grown overnight, and then each dish was split into 6 wells of 12-well plates. Immunolocalization—The procedure for immunofluorescence microscopy staining has been described in detail previously (30Yeung A.K. Basu S.K. Wu S.K. Chu C. Okamoto C.T. Hamm-Alvarez S.F. von Grafenstein H. Shen W.C. Kim K.J. Bolger M.B. Haworth I.S. Ann D.K. Lee V.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected HEK293 cells were plated onto coverslips and cultured for 48 h. The coverslips were then incubated with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at room temperature for 20 min. After washing 3 times with PBS, the coverslips were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min, washed once, and then blocked with 1% bovine serum in PBS at room temperature for 30 min. After washing once with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS (PBST), the coverslips were incubated with primary antibodies for 2 h. After washing 3 times with PBST, they were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h. The coverslips were washed again with PBST (twice) and PBS (once). Finally, the coverslips were mounted onto slides with anti-fade medium and examined by fluorescence microscopy. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blots—Cell lysates were precleared with Sepharose CL-2B cross-linked 2% beaded agarose (Sigma) combined with affinity-purified anti-hPepT1 antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were collected with protein A-Sepharose (Sigma). Further details of the protocol will be subsequently published. 2C. Chu, C. T. Okamoto, and V. H. L. Lee, manuscript in preparation. The immunoprecipitates were fractionated by electrophoresis on an 8% pre-cast polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel (Gradipore, Inc., Hawthorne, NY), blotted onto Trans-Blot® transfer medium pure nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad), probed with affinity-purified anti-hPepT1 primary antibody, and visualized with secondary antibody and chemiluminescence (30Yeung A.K. Basu S.K. Wu S.K. Chu C. Okamoto C.T. Hamm-Alvarez S.F. von Grafenstein H. Shen W.C. Kim K.J. Bolger M.B. Haworth I.S. Ann D.K. Lee V.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Inhibition Studies with Sulfhydryl Reagents—Prior to the uptake measurements, the transfected cells, adhered to the wells, were washed with the transport medium (MES-Tris, pH 6 buffer). Each well was then incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with a solution containing [3H]gly-sar (0.5 μCi/ml) after preincubation with 2.5 mm MTSEA or 1 mm MTSET (Toronto Research Chemicals Inc., Ontario, Canada) for 10 min. After washing three times in ice-cold MES-Tris, pH 6.0 buffer, the cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (1% SDS). BCA protein assay reagents were used to determine the protein content of each well, and the cell-associated radioactivity was measured in a Beckman liquid scintillation counter. Mock-transfected and WT-hPepT1-transfected HEK293 cells were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. The characteristics of dipeptide uptake by WT-hPepT1-transfected HEK293 cells in the presence of MTS reagents were very similar to those in the absence of the MTS reagent (29Kulkarni A.A. Haworth I.S. Lee V.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 306: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Computational Analysis—A helical wheel model of the transmembrane segment 7 of hPepT1 was constructed using the Lasergene software (DNAstar, Inc., Madison, WI). The three-dimensional models were generated using in-house software (TMD) and viewed using WebLab ViewerPro 3.7 (Accelrys Inc., San Diego). We have shown previously (29Kulkarni A.A. Haworth I.S. Lee V.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 306: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) that the activity of WT-hPepT1 is not significantly changed by the presence of MTS reagents, by studying the effect of 1 mm MTSET or 2.5 mm MTSEA on gly-sar uptake by WT-hPepT1 in HEK293 cells and in Xenopus oocytes. Hence, WT-hPepT1 was used as a control in the current work. Each of the 21 residues within TMS7 of WT-hPepT1 was individually mutated to a cysteine (Table I). Each mutated transporter was transiently transfected into HEK293 cells, and their plasma membrane expression in these cells was evaluated using immunofluorescence microscopy. Two of the 21 mutated transporters (Y287C- and M292C-hPepT1) did not express at the plasma membrane, as seen by a lack of fluorescence intensity on the edge of each cell transfected with these two mutants (Fig. 1). Low or negligible protein expression levels as a result of single amino acid mutation have been demonstrated before in various membrane proteins including hPepT1 (25Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3498-3503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 28Slotboom D.J. Konings W.N. Lolkema J.S. J. Biol.

Commun. 2003; 306: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of the 21 hPepT1 mutants followed by Western blot analysis confirmed these results, because Y287C- and M292C-hPepT1 showed insignificant steady state protein expression (Fig. 2). This suggests that single cysteine mutations at these two positions were responsible for the incorrect synthesis and/or misfolding of the mutated proteins. Due to lack of expression, HEK293 cells transfected with these mutants show negligible gly-sar uptake (Fig. 3).Table ICysteine scanning mutants of TMS7 of hPepT1 A series of 21-cysteine scanning mutant cDNAs was created by oligonucleotide-mediated site-directed mutagenesis of the wild type hPepT1 cDNA. Each of the 21 amino acid residues within the putative transmembrane helix 7 was individually mutated to a cysteine.

The steady state protein expression of these transporters also compares well with that of WT-hPepT1, as confirmed by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2). Three of these 19 transporters (F293C-, L296C-, and F297C-hPepT1) showed negligible gly-sar uptake activity; K278C-hPepT1 showed ∼40% activity, and the 15 remaining transporters exhibited more than 50% gly-sar uptake when compared with WT-hPepT1 (Fig. 3). We assessed the solvent accessibilities of the cysteine residues in the 19 mutated transporter proteins in order to determine the residues that would likely be a part of the substrate translocation pathway. This was achieved by measuring the specific uptake activities of these proteins after preincubation with the hydrophilic sulfhydryl-specific chemical reagents MTSET (1 mm) and MTSEA (2.5 mm), and comparing these data to those measured in the absence of these reagents (Figs. 4 and 5). MTSET is completely membrane-impermeable, but MTSEA is slightly membrane-permeable and has a molecular volume about 60% that of MTSET (molecular volume = 109 Å3).Fig. 5Effect of 1 mm MTSET on [3H]gly-sar uptake activities of the cysteine-scanning mutants of TMS7 of hPepT1. 72 h post-transfection, the transfected cells, adhered to the wells, were washed with the transport medium (MES-Tris, pH 6 buffer). Each well was then incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with a solution containing [3H]gly-sar (0.5 μCi/ml) after pre-incubation with 1 mm MTSET for 10 min. After washing three times in ice-cold MES-Tris, pH 6.0 buffer, the cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (1% SDS). BCA protein assay reagents were used to determine the protein content of each well, and the cell-associated radioactivity was measured in a Beckman liquid scintillation counter. Results represent the % gly-sar uptake of each individual mutant transporter protein when compared with wild type hPepT1 (n = 4-8). The background uptake values of mock-transfected HEK293 cells were subtracted.

The remaining 16 single cysteine-mutated transporters were active and exhibited considerable gly-sar uptake activities. Gly-sar uptake for these transporters was then measured in the presence of 2.5 mm MTSEA or 1 mm MTSET. MTSEA (2.5 mm) significantly inhibited gly-sar uptake by each of the 16 mutated hPepT1 transporters (Fig. 4). In contrast, 1 mm MTSET selectively inhibited the transport activities of 8 (K278C-, M279C-, V280C-, T281C-, M284C-, L286-, P291C-, and D298C-hPepT1) of the 16 mutated hPepT1 proteins to a significant extent (p < 0.05, n = 3-6) (Fig. 5). F285C- and W294C-hPepT1 did show a slight inhibition of gly-sar uptake in the presence of 1 mm MTSET, but this inhibition was comparable with that observed with WT-hPepT1 under similar conditions. The transport activity of R282C-hPepT1 and I288C-hPepT1 was significantly increased following incubation with 1 mm MTSET (p < 0.05, n = 3-6) (Fig. 5). The result for R282C-hPepT1 was somewhat surprising, because Arg-282 is positively charged and is expected to be in an aqueous environment. Hence, we expected that R282C would be accessible to the MTS reagents and that this would result in a significant inhibition of gly-sar uptake. However, we observed that after incubation with 1 mm MTSET, the transport activity of R282C-hPepT1 was similar to WT-hPepT1. To explore this observation further, we measured the gly-sar uptake activities of R282E- and R282K-hPepT1 (Fig. 6). We have reported previously (20Bolger M.B. Haworth I.S. Yeung A.K. Ann D. von Grafenstein H. Hamm-Alvarez S. Okamoto C.T. Kim K.J. Basu S.K. Wu S. Lee V.H. J. Pharm. Sci. 1998; 87: 1286-1291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) that R282A-hPepT1 showed a small reduction in gly-sar uptake, but the difference from that of WT-hPepT1 was not significant. R282K-hPepT1 showed uptake similar to that of WT-hPepT1 (n = 3-6, p < 0.05). In contrast, R282E-hPepT1 showed an ∼43% reduction in gly-sar uptake when compared with WT-hPepT1 (n = 3-6, p < 0.05). Helical wheel analysis of the effects of cysteine-scanning and MTS modification in TMS7 of hPepT1 show that the amino acid residues that are sensitive to MTS modification are positioned over the majority of the circumference of the wheel (Fig. 7). This is in sharp contrast with the results that we have reported for TMS5 of hPepT1 (29Kulkarni A.A. Haworth I.S. Lee V.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 306: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), in which the MTSET-sensitive residues are gathered together on a single face of a generally amphipathic α-helix (29Kulkarni A.A. Haworth I.S. Lee V.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 306: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The TMS7 helical wheel (Fig. 7) indicates that this transmembrane domain is not classically amphipathic. However, representation of the solvent-accessible and non-solvent-accessible residues in a lateral view of TMS7 (Fig. 8) suggests that the properties of the helix differ at its extracellular and intracellular ends. In the following paragraphs we examine the potential functional roles of amino acids in various region of TMS7.Fig. 8Proposed orientation of TMS7 in hPepT1. A lateral view of TMS7 in hPepT1 showing amino acids for which cysteine mutation eliminated transport (green), amino acids accessible to the MTS reagents (blue), amino acids that hamper membrane expression when mutated to a cysteine (white), amino acids that increase uptake activity in the presence of 1 mm MTSET when mutated to a cysteine (light blue), and non-accessible amino acids (orange).

We have identified previously a number of amino acids in TMS5 of hPepT1 that showed a similar effect on mutation to cysteine (29Kulkarni A.A. Haworth I.S. Lee V.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 306: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) or alanine (30Yeung A.K. Basu S.K. Wu S.K. Chu C. Okamoto C.T. Hamm-Alvarez S.F. von Grafenstein H. Shen W.C. Kim K.J. Bolger M.B. Haworth I.S. Ann D.K. Lee V.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), including Tyr-167, Asn-171, and Ser-174 (unpublished data for N171A and S174A). 3A. A. Kulkarni, I. S. Haworth, T. Uchiyama, and V. H. L. Lee, unpublished data. These TMS5 amino acids are all hydrophilic, and we interpreted these data to suggest that they were lining the substrate translocation channel and interacting with the substrate. However, the TMS7 amino acids that cannot tolerate mutation to cysteine, Phe-293, Leu-296, and Phe-297, are hydrophobic. Hence, we believe that they probably play a structural role in transporter function. Model building of the orientation of these three amino acids suggests that the two methyl groups of the leucine side chain pack against the faces of the phenylalanine rings, and mutation of any one of the three will disturb the Phe-Leu-Phe hydrophobic packing interaction. We note that this sort of interaction has been observed elsewhere as in, for example, the peptide GILGFVFTL binding to the MHC protein HLA-A2 (31Madden D.R. Garboczi D.N. Wiley D.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 693-708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). In this context, mutation of Phe-5 to alanine of the peptide disrupts the peptide conformation and reduces the affinity for the protein. 4W. S. Meng, H. von Grafenstein, and I. S. Haworth, unpublished results. Hence, Phe-293, Leu-296, and Phe-297 in hPepT1 may form a similar interaction that provides a “cushion” against which other transmembrane segments may pack, and a mutation of any one of these 3 amino acids to a cysteine may cause a conformational change leading to hPepT1 inactivity. W294C-hPepT1 showed a relatively small reduction in glysar uptake in the presence of MTSET, but the difference between its uptake and that of the wild type protein was significant. We have shown previously (20Bolger M.B. Haworth I.S. Yeung A.K. Ann D. von Grafenstein H. Hamm-Alvarez S. Okamoto C.T. Kim K.J. Basu S.K. Wu S. Lee V.H. J. Pharm. Sci. 1998; 87: 1286-1291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) that a W294A mutation in hPepT1 influenced the kinetics of gly-sar uptake and, in particular, had a significant effect on the Michaelis-Menten Km value, which was almost 10 times larger that for WT-hPepT1. This is notable, because most other mutations of hPepT1 amino acids in putative transmembrane domains that influence uptake kinetics tend to show altered Vmax values (20Bolger M.B. Haworth I.S. Yeung A.K. Ann D. von Grafenstein H. Hamm-Alvarez S. Okamoto C.T. Kim K.J. Basu S.K. Wu S. Lee V.H. J. Pharm. Sci. 1998; 87: 1286-1291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and do not influence Km. Hence, we suggest that Trp-294 largely plays a role in maintaining the structural integrity of the protein, but probably does not interact directly with the substrate. Its location may lie at the interface between the solvent-accessible and -inaccessible regions, and this is consistent with the MTSET modification data and with the three-dimensional helical structure shown in Fig. 8. We note that W294C-hPepT1 did not show reduced uptake compared with WT-hPepT1 (Fig. 3), in contrast to W294A-hPepT1 (20Bolger M.B. Haworth I.S. Yeung A.K. Ann D. von Grafenstein H. Hamm-Alvarez S. Okamoto C.T. Kim K.J. Basu S.K. Wu S. Lee V.H. J. Pharm. Sci. 1998; 87: 1286-1291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We have not followed up this observation further, but it may be that the somewhat larger size of the cysteine side chain, compared with alanine, sufficiently reflects the steric bulk of the tryptophan side chain and better maintains the correct helical packing. The most surprising finding was that the mutation of Arg-282 to a cysteine did not have any significant effect on hPepT1 activity and that R282C did not show any significant inhibition of gly-sar uptake after incubation with the membrane-impermeable MTSET. One would expect that arginine, being a positively charged amino acid, would be facing the aqueous substrate pathway and would be reactive toward the MTS reagent when mutated to a cysteine, causing a significant inhibition of gly-sar uptake. However, the results are contradictory to these expectations. After incubation with 1 mm MTSET, R282C-hPepT1 exhibits WT-hPepT1-like gly-sar uptake (∼20% increase in uptake activity, compared with R282C-hPepT1 in the absence of MTSET). We have also shown previously that R282A-hPepT1 has activity comparable with WT-hPepT1 (20Bolger M.B. Haworth I.S. Yeung A.K. Ann D. von Grafenstein H. Hamm-Alvarez S. Okamoto C.T. Kim K.J. Basu S.K. Wu S. Lee V.H. J. Pharm. Sci. 1998; 87: 1286-1291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To investigate these observations further, we generated the R282K- and R282E-hPepT1 proteins. Our results showed that R282K-hPepT1 retains WT-hPepT1-like activity, whereas R282E-hPepT1 has a 43% reduction in its activity. This suggests that the positive charge is important at amino acid position 282, and we speculate that the 20% increase in uptake activity of R282C-hPepT1 in the presence of MTSET is due to the formation of a “pseudo-arginine” at position 282 by the MTSET (Fig. 9). However, we are unable to explain the increase in I288C-hPepT1 activity after incubation with 1 mm MTSET or the decrease in R282C-hPepT1 activity after incubation with 2.5 mm MTSEA. The exact role of the positive charge of Arg-282 in the hPepT1 substrate translocation mechanism remains difficult to determine. However, it is of interest that Arg-282 in TMS7 and Asp-341 in TMS8 are likely to be spatially proximal. The extracellular loop between TMS7 and TMS8 of hPepT1 is relatively short (∼30 amino acids), which suggests that TMS7 and TMS8 are proximal. Considering the vertical lengths of these 2 transmembrane segments and assuming that they are adjacent to each other, Arg-282 in TMS7 and Asp-341 in TMS8 are located approximately at the same depth from the extracellular side of the lipid membrane. Hence they should lie in close proximity to each other and may potentially form an Arg-282 to Asp-341 salt bridge. Supporting this idea is the observation that D341A-hPepT1 exhibits WT-hPepT1 like activity, 3A. A. Kulkarni, I. S. Haworth, T. Uchiyama, and V. H. L. Lee, unpublished data. similarly to R282A-hPepT1. Helical wheel analysis of the effects of cysteine-scanning and MTS modification in TMS7 of hPepT1 are reminiscent of the findings obtained for TMS7 of the facilitative glucose transporter Glut1 (32Hruz P.W. Mueckler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36176-36180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) but sharply contrast with the results obtained for TMS5 of hPepT1 (29Kulkarni A.A. Haworth I.S. Lee V.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 306: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The helical wheel arrangement of sulfhydryl reagent-sensitive residues on TMS5 and TMS7 of hPepT1 is strikingly similar to the arrangement observed in TMS5 and TMS7 of Glut1 (32Hruz P.W. Mueckler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36176-36180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 33Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10923-10926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, a lateral view of TMS7 of the two proteins suggests that there are a number of differences between hPepT1 and Glut1, and in particular, the extracellular end of TMS7 of hPepT1 appears to be rather less solvent-accessible than the same region of Glut1 TMS7. Hence, our data suggest that the structures of hPepT1 and Glut1 may be similar in a general sense and that there may be value in further comparison of the putative substrate translocation mechanisms of the two proteins. However, it remains likely that the details of these mechanisms will be significantly different. Preliminary molecular modeling of the likely interactions between hPePT1 TMS7 and TMS8, based on data from this and other mutagenesis and SCAM studies, allows us to speculate that the extracellular end of TMS7 may shift following substrate binding, providing the basis for channel opening and substrate translocation. We intend to further probe this speculative proposal by mutagenesis and SCAM analysis of other hPepT1 transmembrane domains. We thank Michaela K.

The new family of anilinoquinazoline inhibitors was discovered by a search for potential drugs in the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes. Although the site of binding on FBPase is clear, the kinetic mechanism of inhibition for this new class of inhibitor was not reported. Independent of the efforts above, a screen for new inhibitors of FBPase resulted in the discovery of a chemically distinct molecule (OC252-324, hereafter OC252, Fig. 1) that targets the same binding site on FBPase. Inhibition of FBPase by OC252 is cooperative (Hill coefficient of 2), synergistic with AMP and F26P2, noncompetitive with respect to Mg2+, but uncompetitive with respect to F16P2. OC252 greatly decreases the concentration at which substrate inhibition dominates the kinetics of FBPase. The crystal structure reveals a pair of OC252 molecules bound to each face of an FBPase tetramer. The quaternary conformation of the tetramer differs from the canonical R- and T-states, observed in the absence and presence of AMP, respectively, yet the loop (residues 52-72) is in its disengaged conformation. A strong hydrogen bond between OC252 and the side chain of a conserved aspartate residue of undetermined functional significance suggests the possibility of a binding site recognized by an unknown natural effector.

Other chemicals were of reagent grade or the equivalent. QSW-HR high pressure liquid chromatography resin came from Toso-Hass Bioseparations. FBPase-deficient Escherichia coli strain DF 657 came from the Genetic Stock Center at Yale University. Plasmids used in the expression of wild-type FBPase came from a previous investigation (20Nelson S.W. Choe J.-Y. Iancu C.V. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11100-11106Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The inhibitor OC252 was provided by Ontogen Corp. (Carlsbad, CA). Expression and Purification of Wild-type FBPase—Separate preparations of enzyme were used for the structural and kinetics investigations. Recombinant FBPase was expressed in a strain of E. coli deficient in endogenous FBPase and then purified to homogeneity. Cell-free extracts of the wild-type FBPases were subjected to heat treatment (65 °C for 5 min), followed by centrifugation. For enzyme used in kinetics investigations, the supernatant solution was loaded onto a Cibacron Blue-Sepharose column, previously equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. FBPases were eluted from that column with 1 mm AMP and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The eluent from the first column was loaded directly onto a DEAE-Sepharose column and then eluted with a NaCl gradient (0-0.3 m). The purified enzyme was dialyzed extensively against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. For crystallization experiments, after volume reduction by pressure concentration through an Amicon PM-30 membrane, the supernatant solution from centrifugation was passed through a CM-Sepharose column using a NaCl gradient (20-400 mm) in 10 mm Tris malonate, pH 6.0, and then dialyzed against KPi (20 mm, pH 7.0). Purity and protein concentrations of FBPase preparations were confirmed by SDS-PAGE (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar) and the Bradford assay (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar), respectively. Kinetic Experiments—Assays for the determination of specific activity, kcat, and activity ratios at pH 7.5 and 9.5 employed the coupling enzymes, phosphoglucose isomerase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (1Benkovic S.T. de Maine M.M. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1982; 53: 45-82PubMed Google Scholar). The reduction of NADP+ to NADPH was monitored by absorbance spectroscopy at 340 nm. All other assays used the same coupling enzymes, but monitored NADPH production by its fluorescence emission at 470 nm, using an excitation wavelength of 340 nm. Kinetic assays were performed at room temperature (22 °C). Data fitting and analysis used the program DYNAFIT (27Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar). Crystallization of the Product Complex—Crystals of FBPase grew by the method of hanging drops. Equal parts of a protein solution (FBPase (10 mg/ml), KPi, pH 7.4 (10 mm), MgCl2 (5 mm), F6P (5 mm), and OC252 (2 mm)) and a precipitant solution (Tris malonate, pH 7.4 (2.5 mm), polyethylene glycol 3350 (6% w/v)) were combined in a droplet of 4 μl total volume. Wells contained 500 μl of the precipitant solution. Crystals of dimensions 0.4 × 0.4 × 0.3 mm grew in approximately 3 days at 20 °C. OC252 is relatively insoluble in aqueous solutions. Approximately 10 mg of pure inhibitor was dissolved initially in acetone, and appropriately measured aliquots were distributed to empty vials. The acetone was removed by evaporation, and the protein solution above was added. The inhibitor dissolved after a brief time interval to provide the clear protein solution used in the crystallization experiments. Data Collection—Data were collected at Iowa State University on a rotating anode/Siemens area detector at 120 K, using CuKα radiation passed through a graphite monochromator. Data were reduced by XENGEN (28Howard A.J. Nielsen C. Xuong N.H. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 114: 452-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Structure Determination, Model Building, and Refinement—Crystals grown for the present study are isomorphous to the AMP-Zn2+-product complex (17Choe J.-Y. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8565-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Phase angles, used in the generation of initial electron density maps, were based on model 1EYJ of the Protein Data Bank, from which water molecules, metal cations, small molecule ligands, and residues 52-72 had been omitted. Residues 52-72 were built into the electron density of omit maps, with reference to the Cα coordinates of loop 52-72 from the AMP complex (17Choe J.-Y. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8565-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), using the program XTALVIEW (29McRee D.E. J. Mol. Graphics. 1992; 10: 44-46Crossref Google Scholar) and a Silicon Graphics work station. A molecule of Pi and of F6P and two magnesium cations were added to omit electron density of the active site. Strong electron density remained, however, near the center of the tetramer, which easily accommodated a molecule of OC252. The resulting model underwent refinement, using CNS (30Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu M.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2539) Google Scholar). A cycle of refinement consisted of slow cooling from 2500 to 300 K in steps of 25 K, followed by 120 cycles of conjugate gradient minimization, and concluded by the refinement of individual thermal parameters. Thermal parameter refinement employed restraints of 1.5 Å2 on nearest neighbor and next-to-nearest neighbor main chain atoms, 2.0 Å2 on nearest neighbor side chain atoms, and 2.5 Å2 on next-to-nearest neighbor side chain atoms. In subsequent cycles of refinement, water molecules were fit to difference electron density of 2.5σ or better and were added until no significant decrease was evident in the Rfree value. Included in the final model were water molecules that make suitable donor-acceptor distances to each other and the protein and have thermal parameters under 60 Å2. Expression and Purification of Wild-type FBPase—Expression and isolation procedures described above provide FBPase in at least 95% purity, as judged by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). The kcat value (22 ± 1 s-1) and the ratio of specific activities at pH 7.5 to 9.5 (3.3) indicate high purity and little or no proteolysis of the purified enzyme, consistent with the results from electrophoresis. Kinetics Experiments—By using fixed concentrations of MgCl2 (0.5 mm, approximately the Ka for Mg2+) and F16P2 (20 μm, saturating), initial velocities vary as the inverse square of OC252 concentration (Hill coefficient of 1.97 ± 0.1) with an I0.5 (concentration of OC252 that causes 50% inhibition) of 1.87 ± 0.07 μm (Fig. 2). F26P2, AMP, and OC252 inhibit FBPase synergistically; I0.5 values for OC252 are 0.63 ± 0.04 μm (Hill coefficient, 1.6 ± 0.1) in the presence of 1.5 μm AMP and 0.48 ± 0.01 μm (Hill coefficient, 1.7 ± 0.1) in the presence of 0.45 μm F26P2. The numerical values above result from a fit of data to Equation 1,Vo/Vm=I0.5/(I0.5-In)(Eq. 1) where n is the Hill coefficient, Vm the initial velocity in the absence of inhibitor, Vo the initial velocity at a specific inhibitor concentration, I the concentration of OC252, and I0.5 the concentration of OC252 that causes 50% inhibition. Kinetics data were taken over broad concentration ranges of Mg2+ (0.2-5 mm), F16P2 (1-20 μm), and OC252 (0-20 μm) in order to determine the kinetic mechanism of inhibition. Plots of reciprocal velocity against 1/[Mg2+]2 (F16P2 saturating, but below concentrations that cause significant substrate inhibition) and 1/[F16P2] (Mg2+ saturating) indicate noncompetitive inhibition with respect to Mg2+ and uncompetitive inhibition with respect to F16P2 (Fig. 3). As is evident from Fig. 3A, substrate inhibition increases significantly with rising inhibitor concentration. Data from Fig. 3A were fit to nine different kinetic models using the program DYNAFIT (27Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar), combining mechanisms of competitive, noncompetitive, and uncompetitive inhibition by OC252, with and without pathways for inhibitor-induced substrate inhibition or partial inhibitor-induced substrate inhibition (Table I). (Inhibitor-induced substrate inhibition requires the binding of OC252 prior to the binding of the inhibitory F16P2 molecule. Inhibitor-induced partial substrate inhibition allows turnover of the substrate-inhibited enzyme at a reduced maximal velocity.) All successful kinetic models include the association of two molecules of OC252 with an E·(Mg2+)2·F16P2 complex to form an E·(Mg2+)2·F16P2·(OC252)2 complex (uncompetitive inhibition with respect to F16P2). The latter complex induces the formation of E·(Mg2+)2·(F16P2)2·(OC252)2 (inhibitor-induced substrate inhibition). Parameters representing the formation of an E·(Mg2+)2·(OC252)2 complex (which would result in competitive, noncompetitive, or mixed inhibition with respect to F16P2 and/or the turnover of the E·(Mg2+)2·(F16P2)2·(OC252)2 complex (inhibitor-induced partial substrate inhibition) are not justified on the basis of F tests. Hence, model H of Table I represents the data at saturating Mg2+ with the fewest parameters. Scheme I then represents the kinetic mechanism of inhibition at all concentrations of the relevant ligands.Table IHypothetical models of inhibition of FBPase by OC252 Open table in a new tab Scheme IView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) From Scheme I we derived the following relationship (Equation 2) assuming rapid-equilibrium kinetics under initial velocity conditions,1/V=(1/Vm)(1+Ka/A2+Kb/B+(KiaKb)/(A2B)+(KaI2)/(KiA2)+(I2/Kii)(1+B/Kiis))(Eq. 2) where A, B, and I are concentrations of free Mg2+, F16P2, and OC252, respectively; Vm is the maximal velocity, and Kia, Ka, Kb, Ki, Kii, and Kiis are dissociations constants for two Mg2+ atoms from the E·(Mg2+)2 complex, for two Mg2+ atoms from the E·(Mg2+)2·F16P2 complex, for F16P2 from the E·(Mg2+)2·F16P2 complex, for two OC252 molecules from the E·F16P2·(OC252)2 complex, for two molecules of OC252 from the E·(Mg2+)2·F16P2·(OC252)2 complex, and for the second (inhibitory) molecule of F16P2 from the E·(Mg2+)2·(F16P2)2·(OC252)2 complex, respectively. Equation 2 simplifies under conditions of saturating Mg2+ to Equation 3,1/V=(1/Vm)(1+Kb/B+(I2/Kii)(1+B/Kiis))(Eq. 3) which is used in the determination of Vm, Kb, Kii, and Kiis from data in Fig. 3A. Under these conditions, [F16P2]≫Kb, Equation 2 simplifies to Equation 4,1/V=(1/Vm)(1+Ka/A2+(KaI2)/(KiA2)+(I2/Kii)(1+B/Kiis))(Eq. 4) which is used in the determination of Vm, Ka, and Ki from data in Fig. 3B using numerical values for Kii and Kiis from Equation 3.

Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8565-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Two subunits of FBPase are in the asymmetric unit of this crystal form. Cα coordinates of the independent subunits superimposed with a root mean square deviation of 0.38 Å, using a subset of residues (33-49, 75-265, and 272-330), which do not exhibit significant tertiary conformational differences between the T- and R-state subunits of FBPase (10Choe J.-Y. Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 33: 11441-11450Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Regions of weak or absent electron density include residues 1-8 and 63-70. The model begins at residue 9 and continues to the last residue of the sequence, but segment 63-70 is unreliable, as evidenced by high thermal parameters. Thermal parameters vary from 5 to 57 Å2. As determined by PROCHECK (32Laskowski R.A. Mac Arthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl.

Open table in a new tab Although the two subunits of the OC252 complex are similar, the ligation of each active site by metals differs. In the subunit labeled chain B, strong electron density is at metal site 1. The thermal parameter of Mg2+ at full occupancy here refines to a value of 10 Å2, which is significantly less than the average value (20 Å2) for atoms of the protein ligated to that metal. Hence Mg2+ and a heavier metal (Zn2+, on the basis of prior experience (19Choe J.-Y. Iancu C.V. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16015-16020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)) probably co-occupy site 1 in chain B. Site 2 of chain B has diffuse electron density that may represent disordered water molecules or the combination of water molecules and Mg2+ at low occupancy; Mg2+ at full occupancy refined at metal site 2 with a thermal parameter of 32 Å2. In the subunit labeled chain A, Mg2+ refines with thermal parameters of 18 and 29 Å2 at sites 1 and 2, respectively. Metal site 2 in chain A may be occupied partially by Mg2+. The conformations of side chains near metal site 2 also differ in each of the symmetry unique subunits of the crystal. In addition, molecules of Pi are at partial occupancy at each active site, but molecules of F6P are at full occupancy. OC252 is arguably a highly constrained pseudo-tetrapeptide (Fig. 1); the first and fourth “residues” have tyrosyl side chains, a methylene group in residue 2 covalently bridges the phenylalanyl side chain to its amide nitrogen, and an n-propyl group is the side chain of residue 3. The N-2 atom of OC252 corresponds to the backbone nitrogen atom of the first and third residues, and the terminal carboxyl group is absent. Atoms C-8, C-10, and C-12 have the l-configuration of a common amino acid. In their FBPase complex, two molecules of OC252 are in mutual contact, related to each other by the molecular 2-fold axis that projects through the face of the FBPase tetramer. Most of the contacts between inhibitor and protein are apolar; however, the phenol oxygen atoms of residues 1 and 4 of OC252 hydrogen-bond with backbone carbonyl 71 and the side chain of Asp187, respectively. Furthermore, the C—O bond axis of backbone carbonyl 51 is normal to the plane defined by atoms C-8, N-2, C-11, and C-12 of OC252, with its oxygen atom 3.2 Å from atom N-2. The latter suggests an electronic resonance state of the bound OC252 molecule that stabilizes this close contact (Fig. 1). Although the OC252 and AMP crystalline complexes are isomorphous, the two FBPase tetramers adopt different quaternary conformations. Superpositions of C1-C2 subunit pairs from the OC252, T-state, and R-state complexes give comparable root mean squared deviations (Table IV). (See Fig. 4 for the convention adopted in the labeling of subunits.) On the other hand, superpositions of tetramers give significantly larger deviations, suggesting different quaternary structures. Indeed, the C3-C4 subunit pair in the OC252 complex rotates ∼14° relative to the C1-C2 subunit pair, falling some 3° short of the canonical T-state (Fig. 5). Hereafter, we refer to the quaternary state of FBPase induced by OC252 as the I-state.Table IVRoot mean squared deviations (in Å) in superpositions of C1-C2 subunits and tetramers (boldface) of FBPaseT-stateOC252 complexR-state2.71/0.5782.16/0.481T-state0.703/0.332 Open table in a new tab The I-state must be due to the specific effects of the OC252 inhibitor. First, the conditions of crystallization for the T-, R-, and I-states of FBPase differ only by the presence or absence of allosteric effectors. The T-state crystallizes in the presence of AMP (17Choe J.-Y. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B.

Clarke C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The diet-derived Q8 masks a Q auxotrophy in clk-1 animals. Unexpectedly, wild-type animals fed the Q-less E. coli have an extended adult life span (15Larsen P.L. Clarke C.F. Science. 2002; 295: 120-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). This suggests an interesting contrast in the requirements for Q; it is essential for development, yet exogenous Q8 is detrimental to the longevity of adult animals. It is not understood why the clk-1 animals remain abnormal when supplied a Q8-replete diet. The diet-derived Q8 is present in mitochondria isolated from clk-1 mutant adults; however, it is important to note that the amount of Q8 assimilated is far lower than the amount of Q9 produced by N2 (16Jonassen T. Marbois B.N. Faull K.F. Clarke C.F. Larsen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45020-45027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We considered that uptake of the shorter Q8 isoform derived from the diet may contribute to the Clk-1 phenotypes, because the worms normally synthesize the Q9 isoform. To further understand the effects of tail length on Q function and transport, we utilized E. coli strains that had been engineered to produce quinones with different tail lengths (17Okada K. Kamiya Y. Zhu X. Suzuki K. Tanaka K. Nakagawa T. Matsuda H. Kawamukai M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5992-5998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Okada K. Suzuki K. Kamiya Y. Zhu X. Fujisaki S. Nishimura Y. Nishino T. Nakagawa T. Kawamukai M. Matsuda H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The polyprenyldiphosphate synthase gene ispB was disrupted, and homologues from different organisms were introduced on plasmids, generating E. coli that produced Q7, Q8, Q9, or Q10. We examined the effects of feeding these different Q isoforms on reproductive fitness and progeny viability in both N2 and clk-1 animals. Although N2 animals showed no significant differences in brood size or morphology regardless of the Q fed, we found that clk-1(qm30) animals displayed a sterile phenotype when fed bacteria producing the shortest isoform, Q7. The gonads of these animals were shriveled and disordered. Lipid extracts from both the E. coli food and worms were analyzed to determine the levels of uptake and subcellular distribution of the varying Q isoforms within the worms. Although these animals assimilate Q7, it does not accumulate as efficiently within the mitochondria. Interestingly, the clk-1(e2519) animals have a very similar quinone profile to that of clk-1(qm30) animals, yet they produce viable progeny when fed the Q7-producing food. The gonadal morphology is also less affected. Mitochondria isolated from clk-1(qm30) mutants uniquely separate into two densities when purified on Nycodenz gradients, a functionally normal fraction and a less functional, denser fractions (termed the bottom band). Although this bottom band mitochondrial fraction is not observed in the clk-1(e2519) mutants fed Q7, it is present when this strain is fed a Q-less diet, which results in sterility. Together the data suggest that the Clk phenotypes result from several biochemical defects: a lack of endogenously produced Q, a decrease in bacterially derived mitochondrial Q content, poorly functioning mitochondria, and the specific mutation in the CLK-1 polypeptide itself. Culture Conditions and Strains—Methods for C. elegans were standard (19Sulston J.E. Hodgkin J. Wood W.B. The Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 587-606Google Scholar). N2 (Bristol strain) was used as wild type, and the clk-1 alleles used in this study were e2519 and qm30 (12Wong A. Boutis P. Hekimi S. Genetics. 1995; 139: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Kawamukai, Shimane University Open table in a new tab Brood Size Determination—The number of progeny was determined for animals fed the designated E. coli from the L1 stage and from the dauer larval stage. To obtain synchronous L1 larvae, gravid adult animals were treated with alkaline hypochlorite to isolate eggs as per Sulston and Hodgkin (19Sulston J.E. Hodgkin J. Wood W.B. The Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 587-606Google Scholar). The eggs were incubated in S Medium overnight (N2) or over two nights (clk-1) without E. coli to obtain synchronous starved L1 larvae. Worms were placed individually onto nematode growth medium plates with a thin lawn of E. coli and were moved once or twice daily to fresh plates during the egg laying period. Eggs and freshly hatched L1 larvae were counted (egg count). Plates were retained and observed until the larvae reached L4, as determined by the developing vulval morphology, or for 2 weeks. Larvae that reached L4 were removed and counted (progeny count). Isolation and Quantification of Quinones—For the determination of E. coli quinone content, cultures were grown in Luria Broth at 37 °C overnight and collected by centrifugation. Nematodes were cultured at 20 °C in S Medium in the presence of OP50 until dauer larvae were obtained. To obtain large quantities of gravid adults, dauer larvae were isolated with 1% SDS treatment and allowed to recover in S Medium with OP50. Eggs were obtained from the gravid adults as above and were allowed to hatch overnight in S Medium without food. The synchronous L1 larvae were then fed the E. coli ispB mutants engineered to produce either Q7 or Q8. When the animals had developed to young adults, as determined by vulval morphology, they were collected by centrifugation, separated from bacteria and debris by sucrose floatation, and allowed to clear bacteria from the gut for a minimum of 30 min in M9. Following another sucrose floatation, the samples were stored at -80 °C until use. Prior to the lipid extraction, all samples were resuspended in ∼12 ml of water, and three 1-ml aliquots were moved to preweighed Eppendorf tubes. The small aliquots were centrifuged at maximum speed, and the wet weights of the pellets were determined. These samples were dried overnight using a heated speedvac, and the dry pellet weights were determined. The dried pellets were then resuspended in 1 n NaOH using ∼1 ml per 2 mg dry weight. The samples were assayed for protein concentration by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). This allowed for direct comparisons between wet weight, dry weight, and amount protein. The remaining 9-ml samples were pelleted in tared glass tubes, and the wet pellet weights were determined. In general, ∼0.55-g wet weight nematodes and 0.35-g wet weight E. coli was used per extraction. The pellets were resuspended in a small volume of water, and the internal standards (in ethanol) were added at a concentration of 20-30 pmol per μl of final resuspension volume. Q10 was used as an internal standard for the nematode extractions and for the Q7-, Q8-, and Q9-producing bacterial strains. Q6 was the internal standard for the Q10-producing bacteria. 9 ml of MeOH and 6 ml of petroleum ether was added to each tube, and the extraction proceeded with shaking overnight in the dark at 4 °C. The tubes were centrifuged at 2000 rpm, 4 °C for 10 min. The top petroleum ether layers were removed, and a second extraction was done with 4 ml of petroleum ether for one more hour. The petroleum ether extracts were combined and dried under nitrogen. The dried lipids were finally resuspended in 9:1 MeOH/EtOH. The nematode lipids were resuspended in 100 μl, and the bacterial lipids were resuspended in 2 ml of 9:1 MeOH/EtOH. Quantification by HPLC linked with an electrochemical detector (ECD) was performed as described previously (16Jonassen T. Marbois B.N. Faull K.F. Clarke C.F. Larsen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45020-45027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial Isolation—Nematode subcellular fractionation and crude mitochondrial isolation were done as described previously (16Jonassen T. Marbois B.N. Faull K.F. Clarke C.F. Larsen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45020-45027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) except a protease inhibitor mixture was added (catalog number 1873580; Roche Applied Science) to the isolation buffer (IB). The crude mitochondria were further purified over a linear Nycodenz gradient as described by Glick and Pon (20Glick P.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) with the following adjustments. The step gradient was prepared from a 60% Nycodenz stock in IB diluted to 30, 25, 20, 15, and 10% in IB and layered. The brown band at the 20-25% region contained the purified mitochondria, which were isolated as by Glick and Pon (20Glick P.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The purified mitochondrial pellets were resuspended in a volume of IB similar to that originally loaded on the gradient. A lower, more dense band was seen in mitochondrial preparations from clk-1(qm30) animals at the 25-30% region. This band was also present in mitochondrial preparations of clk-1(e2519) animals fed GD1. These bands were separately extracted and identified as bottom bands. Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay. Lipid extractions and electrochemical detection were performed as above. Enzyme Assays—Mannosidase II (Golgi) activity assays were adapted from Ren et al. (21Ren J. Castellino F.J. Bretthauer R.K. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 951-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and were performed in a total volume of 0.2 ml containing 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 6.0, 4 mmp-nitrophenyl-α-d-mannopyranoside as substrate, and 100-250 μg of protein per assay. Glucose 6-phosphatase (ER) activity and 5′-nucleotidase (plasma membrane) activity were assayed as by Stephenson and Clarke (22Stephenson R.C. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13314-13319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except the incubations took place at 30 °C. Succinate-cytochrome c reductase activity was measured using 50 μg of mitochondrial protein per assay in 40 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 20 mm sodium succinate, 500 μm EDTA, pH 7.4, and 250 μm potassium cyanide. Samples were incubated in this assay buffer for 15 min at 30 °C. The reaction was initiated with the addition of 50 μm horse heart cytochrome c and monitored for 3.5 min via spectrophoto-metric measurements of absorbance at 550 nm minus 540 nm. The reduction rate of cytochrome c was calculated using the extinction coefficient 18.5 mm-1 cm-1. Western Blotting—Western analysis utilizing the antibody against the β subunit of the F1-ATPase was done as by Jonassen et al. (16Jonassen T. Marbois B.N. Faull K.F. Clarke C.F. Larsen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45020-45027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Similar methods were used with the following primary antibodies: hexokinase (1:1000 dilution) and actin (1:1000 dilution) except that 80 μg of protein were loaded in each lane, and horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies to rabbit IgG were used at a 1:1000 dilution. Image Acquisition—Dauer larvae were moved to nematode growth medium plates containing 1 μg/ml tetramethylrhodamine, ethyl ester (TMRE; Molecular Probes) inoculated with either OP50 or the Q7-producing strain. The animals were allowed to develop to adulthood. The adults were picked to small droplets of 10 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) on a 2% agarose pad and decapitated just below the pharyngeal bulb, allowing exposure and extension of the gonadal arm. Fluorescent images and DIC images were acquired using an Olympus Fluoview 300 confocal microscope with a 40× oil objective (numerical aperture = 1.35) and Cy3 filter, performed at the Optical Imaging Facility at University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio. Gonadal length was determined using Image J (National Institutes of Health: rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). Profile of Quinones in Engineered E. coli—Before determining the effects of feeding the engineered E. coli ispB mutant strains to the nematodes, the quinone content of these bacterial strains was quantified with a sensitive electrochemical detection system linked with HPLC. Although the bacteria primarily produced the designated Q isoform, each strain also produced other isoforms (Fig. 1). The total amounts of the primary isoforms for the Q8-producing strains were highest, at 6371 ± 176 pmol Q8 per mg protein for OP50 and 5207 ± 124 pmol Q8 per mg protein for K0229:pKA3 (Q8 diet). K0229:pMN18 (Q7 diet) accumulated 4733 ± 120 pmol Q7 per mg protein, but it also produced a significant amount of Q6, at 1205 ± 44 pmol Q6 per mg protein. The total quinone levels in the longer chain Q9 and Q10-producing strains were 57 and 35% of OP50 levels, respectively. K0229:pSN18 (Q9 diet) accumulated 3024 ± 63 pmol Q9 per mg protein, and K0229:pLD23 (Q10 diet) only accumulated 1733 ± 8 pmol Q10 per mg protein. Interestingly, unlike OP50, the engineered ispB mutants did not contain detectable levels of menaquinone (MK8, vitamin K2), an isoprenoid naphthoquinone required by some prokaryotic electron transport chains (23Gennis R.B. Stewart V. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 217-261Google Scholar). Brood Size of clk-1 Mutants Is Affected by the Distinct Qn Diets—Once the lipid profiles of the bacterial foods had been analyzed, the effects of the distinct Qn isoforms on the reproductive fitness of N2 and clk-1 animals were determined. N2 animals fed OP50 laid ∼300 eggs per individual (Fig. 2A). There was no significant difference in the number of eggs laid by N2 animals fed the different strains of E. coli containing predominantly Q7, Q8, or Q10. There was a statistically significant increase in the number of eggs laid when the animals were fed the Q9 diet; however, the number of progeny that developed to L4 larvae did not vary significantly on any food source tested (Fig. 2B). The clk-1(e2519) animals showed a 40% decrease in egg laying when fed the Q7 diet as compared with the Q8-replete diets. These mutants displayed a statistically significant increase in egg production when fed Q9- or Q10-producing E. coli, with 25-30% more viable progeny than those hermaphrodites fed OP50. The worms fed the Q7-containing food developed slightly more slowly than their siblings fed the Q8-producing food; their generation time, from egg to first egg laid, was about one and a half days longer. The generation time of mutants fed the Q9- or Q10-producing bacteria was about half a day faster than those fed the Q8 diet. clk-1(qm30) animals exhibited a dramatic phenotype when fed the Q7-producing bacteria from the L1 larval stage; some of these worms were completely sterile, whereas the rest laid very few eggs, with a range of 0 to 32 eggs per hermaphrodite. The average number of eggs was 14, but the average number of viable larvae produced from these eggs was less than one. The length of time it took for these eggs to hatch and develop was also variable and extended. It took up to 1 week for these hatchlings to develop to the L4 larval stage, and much of this time was spent in embryonic development. After 2 weeks, all remaining eggs were considered nonviable. The generation time, from egg to first egg laid, was 10 days for mutants fed the Q7 diet, as compared with 6 days when the animals were fed OP50. When fed E. coli producing Q8, Q9, or Q10, the clk-1(qm30) nematodes produced similar numbers of eggs as when fed OP50. Although the number of eggs laid when the animals were fed the Q9- and Q10-producing bacteria was similar to that laid with Q8-replete food, far fewer eggs developed into L4 larvae. The dead eggs were examined, revealing embryos at different stages of development. Thus, it appears that there is a mild embryonic lethality associated with the clk-1(qm30) mutant and the Q9 and Q10 diets. When clk-1(qm30) dauer larvae were recovered on the Q7 diet, the brood sizes were significantly lowered, but the effect was not as striking as when the animals were fed this diet commencing as L1 larvae. The average number of eggs laid was 91 ± 38 per individual; however, most of these eggs were nonviable. The average number of progeny developing to the L4 stage was 30 ± 25. The numbers of eggs produced when the animals were fed the Q8, Q9, or Q10 diets were similar to those fed OP50, although the viability of the eggs laid when the nematodes were fed Q9 or Q10 diets was lower. Therefore, with all diets, the clk-1(qm30) animals produced more eggs and more viable progeny when developing from the dauer stage than when developing from L1 larvae on the designated food. Assimilation of Dietary Q7 and Q8 by Nematodes—Considering the lack of viable progeny from the clk-1(qm30) animals fed the Q7-producing strain, it was important to determine whether these worms could assimilate this shorter isoform. N2, clk-1(e2519), and clk-1(qm30) animals were fed the Q7-producing bacteria or the isogenic Q8-producing strain from starved L1 larvae until adulthood. The lipids were extracted from these animals, and the quinones were quantified. There was no significant difference in the number of pmol quinones per mg protein of endogenous Q9 or RQ9 produced in the N2 animals whether they were fed the Q7-orQ8-producing bacteria (Fig. 3). There was slightly more Q8 than Q7 assimilated from the diet in the N2 animals, 101 ± 6 pmol Q8 per mg protein versus 65 ± 5 pmol Q7 per mg protein. The mutant strains clk-1(e2519) and clk-1(qm30) similarly accumulated Q7 and Q8 from their respective diets, in addition to the endogenously synthesized DMQ9 and RQ9. In three separate experiments, the levels of DMQ9 did not show a consistent trend when the animals were fed either food. Characterization of Subcellular Fractions—Although Q7 could be assimilated by all strains tested, the question remained whether it could be successfully transported to the mitochondria where it could function in mitochondrial respiration. Therefore, purified mitochondria were isolated from N2, clk-1(e2519), and clk-1(qm30) adults that had been fed different E. coli foods as starved L1 larvae. In addition to the expected purified mitochondrial band in the Nycodenz gradient, a denser band at the 25-30% region of the gradient was observed in all mitochondrial preparations from clk-1(qm30) animals. This band was also identifiable in mitochondrial preparations of clk-1(e2519) animals fed the Q-less E. coli strain GD1 (data not shown). These bands were separately extracted and identified as bottom bands. Western analysis was used to verify that mitochondrial components were enriched in the purified mitochondrial fractions and to assist in identifying the bottom band fraction. The β subunit of the F1-ATPase, a marker of the inner mitochondrial membrane, was found to be clearly present in the crude and purified mitochondrial fractions from both N2 and clk-1 animals and in the bottom band fraction from clk-1(qm30) animals (data not shown). Additionally, Western analysis verified the lack of hexokinase, a cytosolic marker, in both crude and purified mitochondrial fractions, and the absence of actin, a cytoskeletal marker, in purified mitochondria (data not shown). Unfortunately, antibodies generated against polypeptides localized to various other membranous organelles in other species failed to cross-react with expected homologues in C. elegans. Therefore, to determine the extent of contamination of mitochondria by other organelles, mannosidase II (Golgi), glucose 6-phosphatase (ER), and 5′-nucleotidase (plasma membrane) activities were each assayed in all subcellular fractions of clk-1(e2519) (Table II). Although the crude mitochondrial fractions showed an enrichment of the Golgi and ER membrane marker enzymes per mg protein compared with the post-nuclear supernatants, the purified mitochondrial fractions showed a substantial decrease in mannosidase II and glucose 6-phosphatase activities and an elimination of 5′-nucleotidase activity.Table IIEnzyme assaysclk-1 (e25 19) subcellular fractionMannosidase II activity (Golgi)Glucose 6-phosphatase activity (ER)5′-Nucleotidase activity (plasma membrane)nmol para-nitrophenol produced/hr/mg proteinnmol phosphate produced/min/mg proteinPost-nuclear supernatant8.27.71."

Regulation of macrophage gene expression by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is of potential importance in the pathogenesis of infection, inflammation, and septic shock. A detailed understanding of the molecular basis of such disease requires a thorough analysis of the mechanisms by which the actions of LPS are transduced to the nucleus to alter gene expression. The expression of C/EBPβ is inducible in monocytes and macrophages by LPS. C/EBPβ has been implicated in the regulation of proinflammatory cytokines as well as other genes associated with macrophage activation and the acute phase response (3Akira S. Isshiki H. Sugita T.

C/EBPβ can also activate the proximal promoter of the human TNF-α gene in RAW264.7 monocytic cells, whereas overexpression of a dominant negative C/EBPβ inhibits LPS-induced activation (10Pope R.

In the murine P388D1(IL1) cell line, C/EBPβ is constitutively expressed, and IL-6 and TNF-α can readily be induced by agents such as LPS. The exact molecular mechanisms of LPS stimulation of IL-6 and TNF-α gene expression and how this relates to C/EBPβ-mediated activation of these genes remain unclear.

Structurally, members of C/EBP family are bZIP proteins with sequence-specific DNA binding activity when homo- or heterodimerized. The DNA-binding and transactivation domains are located in the C- and N-terminal regions, respectively (11Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The intronless c/ebpβ gene (also known as lap in rat, agp/ebp in mouse, and NF-IL6 in human) encodes three isoforms, including two activators (termed LAP* and LAP, respectively) and a repressor (i.e. LIP). These isoforms of C/EBPβ are differentially translated from the same mRNA (12Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). The expression of these isoforms is developmentally and hormonally regulated (12Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 13Diehl A.M.

Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1223-1232PubMed Google Scholar). The functional differences between the two activator isoforms, LAP* and LAP, have been addressed in two examples (15Lee Y.M. Miau L.H. Chang C.J. Lee S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4257-4263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kowenz-Leutz E. Leutz A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 735-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The 21 amino acids of the N terminus region of LAP* are responsible for its functional interaction with NF-κB and for recruiting to the SWI-SNF complex involved in chromatin remodeling. Both NF-κB and C/EBPβ can activate the inflammatory cytokine genes, and conversely, these cytokines can induce NF-κB and C/EBPβ (17Matsusaka T. Fujikawa K. Nishio Y. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10193-10197Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the mechanisms for activating C/EBPβ and NF-κB may converge on a post-translational level. There is a cysteine residue, Cys11, located in the 21-amino acid stretch of the N-terminal region of LAP*. The possibility of Cys11 involved in the tertiary structure or redox sensing that results in the differential activation of LAP* and LAP deserves to be investigated. The activities of transcription factors may be regulated in a redox-sensitive manner. LPS has been shown to induce changes in cellular redox states. The cellular levels of thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase, and NADPH, as well as the reactive oxygen species, may be elevated by LPS treatment (18Ejima K. Koji T. Nanri H. Kashimura M. Ikeda M.

Among the redox-sensing proteins, thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase, and other related oxidoreductases are involved in the regulation of activities of many key proteins in species ranging from bacteria to eukaryotic cells. REF-1 has been characterized as a factor that imparts strong DNA binding activity to the AP-1 complex by maintaining the cysteines as reduced sulfhydryl groups (32Xanthoudakis S. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). The DNA binding activity of transcription factors can be affected by redox modifications (25Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher III, F.J.

To address the potential regulation of LAP* and LAP activity by LPS, we performed detailed biochemical and functional studies on the differential regulation of LAP* and LAP. Here we report that only LAP* is activated by LPS-induced redox switch. Upon reduction, LAP* is activated to up-regulate the transcription of IL-6 gene in P388D1(IL1) cells. We have determined that disulfide bonds formed in LAP* and LAP. A cysteine residue located in the N-terminal 21-amino acid region plays key roles in determining the tertiary structure and the redox-regulated activation of LAP*. The importance and the biological significance of this discovery are discussed. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone). P388D1(IL1) cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mml-glutamine (Invitrogen). Both cultures were supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. All nuclear extracts from 293T or P388D1(IL1) cells were fresh prepared with nitrogen gas. Transient transfection of 293T cells was performed with a calcium phosphate precipitation method. The calcium phosphate-plasmid DNA precipitate contained, in each well of a 6-well plate, 1 μg of AGP-CAT, 0.3 μg of pSV-β-galactosidase, and various constructs of pCMV-C/EBPβ (detailed in the legend of figures). pCMV plasmid DNA was used to give a final amount of 2 μg of DNA for each transfection. 20 h post-transfection, the cultures were replaced with fresh medium and treated with either 10 μm pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) or 1 mmN-acetylcysteine (NAC) for 16 h. The cells were harvested, and CAT activity was determined and normalized with β-galactosidase activity. At least two independent, duplicate experiments were performed to each assay. Plasmids—The AGP-CAT and pCMV-C/EBPβ plasmids were obtained as described elsewhere (38Lee Y.M. Tsai W.H. Lai M.Y. Chen D.S. Lee S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 432-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged LAP*, LAP, and LIP constructs were obtained by cloning the full-length and the respective N-terminal deletion constructs into pCMV-tag2 expression vector (Stratagene). Mutants of each of the six cysteine residues (i.e. Cys → Ser) were generated with the M13mp18 site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega) using the following synthetic primers: C11S, 5′-ACGCAGCAAGCCTCCCG-3′; C33S, 5′-AGCCCGACAGCCTGGAA-3′; C123S, 5′-CCGCCCGCAAGCTTTCCG-3′; C143S, 5′-CCGCGGACAGCAAGCGC-3′; C201S, 5′-CCCGCCGCAAGCTTCGCG-3′; and C296S, 5′-CGGGCCACAGCTAGCGCGGCGCG-3′. The mutated nucleotides are underlined. The mutated cDNAs were then cloned into pCMV-tag vector. Antibodies—18F8 monoclonal antibody was produced from hybridomas generated by fusing splenocytes from BALB/c mouse immunized with MHRLLAWDAACLPPPAAFPKLH with myelomas. 1H7 monoclonal antibody was obtained by immunizing BALB/c mice with recombinant LIP. A16 and other antibodies were described previously (15Lee Y.M. Miau L.H. Chang C.J. Lee S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4257-4263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were modified from previously described methods (39Duong D.T. Waltner-Laws M.E. Sears R. Sealy L. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32234-32242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, P388D1(IL-1) cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C. The nuclei were isolated and sonicated into oligonucleosomes of ∼600 bp in length. The sheared chromatin was immunoprecipitated with 18F8 and 1H7 antibodies overnight, followed by 1 h of incubation with protein G-agarose, cross-linking reversal, and deproteination. The presence of immunoprecipitated DNA was detected by PCR with the following primers: IL-6, sense, 5′-GCTTCTTAGGGCTAGCCTCA-3′, and antisense, 5′-AGCTACAGACATCCCCAGTC-3′; TNF-α, sense, 5′-TTCCGAGGGTTGAATGAGAGCT-3′, and antisense, 5′-TTTCTGTTCTCCCTCCTGGCTA-3′; and C/EBPβ, sense, 5′-GTAGCTGGAGGAACGATC3′, and antisense, 5′-TCGGGAACACGGAGGAGC-3′. PCR was performed for 25 cycles. The products were resolved by 2% agarose gels and visualized with ethidium bromide staining. UV-illuminated images were photographed and analyzed by AlphaImager 1220 (Alpha Innotech Corp.) Northern Blot Analysis—P388D1(IL1) cells were cultured to 80% confluent and stimulated with 1 μg/ml LPS (Escherichia coli 0111:B4; Sigma). The total RNA was extracted with TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen). Approximately 10 μg of total cellular RNA of each sample was separated by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel and analyzed by Northern blotting according to standard protocols. IL-6 probe was generated by reverse transcription-PCR from P388D1(IL1) RNA with the following primers: IL-6 forward primer, 5′-ATGAAGTTCCTCTCTGCAAGAG-3′, and IL-6 reverse primer, 5′-CTAGGTTTGCCGAGTAGATCTCA-3′. Full-length cDNA was used to probe C/EBPβ RNA as described previously (4Chang C.J. Chen T.T. Lei H.Y. Chen D.S. Lee S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6642-6653Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Alkylation of Free Thiol Groups with Iodoacetamide in Vivo—The alkylation method was performed as described previously (40Mancini R. Fagioli C. Fra A.M. Maggioni C. Sitia R. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). P388D1(IL1) cells were stimulated with 1 μg/ml LPS in the presence of 0.1 mm iodoacetamide (Sigma) to prevent free thiol groups from oxidizing to disulfide. Direct lysates were prepared at the indicated times with SDS sample dye containing 200 mm iodoacetamide at room temperature. The lysates were then resolved by nonreducing SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—The specific probe for C/EBPβ was prepared by annealing the oligonucleotides 5′-GATCATTTTGTGTAAGAC-3′ and 5′-GATCGTCTTACACAAAAT-3′. The probe was labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Nuclear extract (5-10 μg) from P388D1(IL1) cells or transfected 293T cells was incubated with the probe (1 ng) and 300 ng poly(dI-dC) in either the absence or presence of DTT, NADPH (Sigma), thioredoxin (Sigma), or the combination of NADPH, thioredoxin, and thioredoxin reductase (Sigma) at 37 °C for 20 min. For supershift assay, after the reaction mixture was incubated, 1-2 μl of anti-C/EBPβ antibody was added, and the incubation continued at room temperature for additional 20 min. The reaction mixtures were separated by 5% PAGE in Tris/glycine/EDTA buffer. Disulfide Bond Determination by Liquid Chromatography Electro-spray Ionization Mass Spectrometry —FLAG-C/EBPβ isoforms were expressed in 293T cells, immunoprecipitated by M2 beads, and resolved in SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. The in-gel tryptic digest of C/EBPβ was dissolved in 0.1% formic acid, separated with an ABI 140D HPLC (Perkin-Elmer, 150 × 0.5 mm Brownlee reversed phase C18 column packed with 5-μm particles with a 300-Å pore), and on-line detected with a Finnigan Mat LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer. The mobile phase of HPLC consisted of various mixing ratios of 0.1% aqueous formic acid (solution A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (solution B). The HPLC analysis was run using a gradient: 5% B for the first 25 min, 5-15% B in 25-30 min, 15-50% B in 30-100 min, and 50-65% B in 100-105 min; this final isocratic solvent was used until all of the peptides were eluted. The eluted peptides were analyzed under positive ion mass spectrometry scan mode over an m/z range of 395-1605. A table of detected masses was generated from the acquired mass spectra by the SEQUEST Browser software (Finnigan). The acquired ion masses were then manually examined for possible combinations of peptides containing cysteine residues. LAP* Is Recruited to IL-6 Gene Promoter after LPS Treatment—Schematic representation of the C/EBPβ isoforms is shown in Fig. 1A. There are six cysteine residues in the mouse LAP* (i.e. Cys11, Cys33, Cys123, Cys143, Cys201, and Cys296), five in LAP (i.e. Cys33, Cys123, Cys143, Cys201, and Cys296), and two in LIP (i.e. Cys201 and Cys296). Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies that recognize only LAP* (i.e. 18F8 and N21), both LAP* and LAP (i.e. A16), as well as all three isoforms (i.e. 1H7) were generated (Fig. 1A, the regions recognized by these monoclonal antibodies are indicated at the top of this figure). To investigate the differential recruitment of C/EBPβ isoforms to target gene promoters, 18F8 and 1H7 were employed for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments of IL-6 and C/EBPβ genes from LPS-treated P388D1(IL1) cells. Schematic representations of these target genes are shown in the top panels of Fig. 1B. Semi-quantitative analysis of the amounts of DNA immunoprecipitated by 18F8, 1H7, and anti-p50 antibody is shown in Fig. 1C. LAP* is selectively recruited to the IL-6 gene promoter only after LPS stimulation, whereas the binding of the sum of all three C/EBPβ isoforms as visualized by ChIP using 1H7 remains constant, independent of the time course of LPS treatment (Fig. 1B, 18F8 and 1H7 of left panels). The binding of LAP* to the promoter region of C/EBPβ is undetectable as demonstrated by ChIP assay with 18F8, but the time course of 1H7 binding to the C/EBPβ promoter remains unchanged upon LPS treatment (Fig. 1B, 18F8 and 1H7 of right panels). NF-κB, known as the predominant factor responsible for the induction of inflammatory cytokine genes (41Sweet M.J. Hume D.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 8-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar), was also tested in ChIP experiment with anti-p50 antibody. Indeed, NF-κB was also recruited to the IL-6 promoter, albeit with different kinetic pattern from that of LAP* (Fig. 1B, α p50 of left panels). The kinetics of LAP* recruitment to the IL-6 promoter correlates well with the expression of IL-6 mRNA (Fig. 1B, 18F8 and IL-6 of left panels). C/EBPβ is constitutively expressed in P388D1(IL1) cells (Fig. 1B, C/EBPβ of right panels and data not shown). Neither LAP* nor NF-κB was recruited to the C/EBPβ promoter upon LPS treatment of P388D1(IL1) cells (Fig. 1B, 18F8 and α p50 of right panels). Taken together, these results suggest that LAP* may play key roles for LPS-induced IL-6 expression but not in the constitutive expression of C/EBPβ gene. In addition to, or in conjunction with LAP*, NF-κB could also play important roles in LPS-mediated IL-6 gene expression. LAP* Activation Correlates with the Reduction of Intramolecular Disulfide Bonds—We next aimed to examine the potential mechanisms that govern the LPS-induced recruitment of LAP* to the IL-6 gene promoter. A number of different pathways have been described to activate C/EBPβ, including transcriptional up-regulation, post-translational modifications, and nuclear translocation (42Bradley M.N. Zhou L. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4841-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The Northern data in Fig. 1B (C/EBPβ panel) exclude the possibility of transcriptional up-regulation in the present assay system. Immunological analyses demonstrated that both protein level and subcellular localization of C/EBPβ isoforms remain unchanged regardless of whether the P388D1(IL1) cells were treated with LPS or not (data not shown). Because LPS treatment is associated with alterations of the redox state, we hypothesized that LAP* could be regulated by a redox switch. Interestingly, amino acid alignment shows that the cysteine residues in C/EBPβ are highly conserved among species (Fig. 2A). Moreover, an extra cysteine residue is located in the N-terminal 21-amino acid stretch that is unique to LAP* (Fig. 2A). To assess whether these cysteine residues were involved in disulfide bond rearrangements during LPS treatment, we performed Western blot analysis to LPS-treated P388D1(IL1) under nonreducing conditions. Iodoacetamide was used to trap the free thiol groups during LPS treatment. At least two species of LAP* displaying slower mobility were observed 1 h after LPS treatment (Fig. 2B), suggesting the differential reduction of intramolecular disulfide bonds. The kinetics of these mobility changes in LAP* also correlates with the ChIP pattern of 18F8 antibody and the induction of IL-6 gene depicted in Fig. 1B. However, when the same protein preparations were subjected to a treatment with the reducing agent DTT, no mobility change could be observed (Fig. 2B, upper panel). On the contrary, LAP does not show a similar change of mobility under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 2B, bottom panel). These observations suggest that endogenous LAP* exists in a more compact conformation, which is relaxed by disulfide bond reduction upon LPS stimulation. To further confirm this finding, we treated the nuclear extract of P388D1(IL1) cells with various concentrations of DTT and analyzed by Western blot under nonreducing conditions. As shown in Fig. 2C, the N21 antibody detected three different migration forms of LAP* (upper panel). A slightly slower migration form was also observed for LAP from the same extracts (Fig. 2C, lower panel), whereas no mobility change was detected in LIP (data not shown). The same migration behavior was also observed for FLAG-tagged recombinant C/EBPβs expressed in 293T cells (Fig. 2D). Identification of the Intramolecular Disulfide Bonds in LAP* and LAP—To determine which cysteine residues are involved in the intramolecular disulfide bond formation in LAP* and LAP, we performed mass spectrometric analysis. FLAG-LAP* was digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by mass spectrometer. Disulfide bonds between Cys11 and Cys33, between Cys123 and Cys143, and between Cys201 and Cys296 of LAP* were identified (Fig. 3A). When FLAG-LAP was subjected to a similar analysis, only Cys123 and Cys201 were found to form intramolecular disulfide bond. This result is consistent with the barely detectable mobility shift of endogenous LAP shown in Fig. 2B. The major determinant in disulfide bond formation between LAP* and LAP hinges on the Cys11 residue of LAP*. To assess the importance of this residue in the overall disulfide bond formation, we performed site-directed mutagenesis that substituted the cysteine with a serine residue. Analysis of this mutant FLAG-LAP* (C11S) reveals that only Cys123 and Cys201, and not Cys11 and Cys33 nor Cys201 and Cys296, were linked by disulfide bond formation. When Cys11 is substituted, the tertiary structure of FLAG-LAP*(C11S) is apparently similar to that of LAP. To correlate these results, we expressed each mutant of the cysteine residues of LAP* and examined their migration pattern under nonreducing SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 3B, all of the mutants migrate more slowly than the wild type protein. The mobility of C123S, C143S, C201S, and C296S was somewhat diffused as compared with that of C11S and C33S. The mobility of C11S and C33S was similar, in accordance to their partnership in disulfide bond formation. Taken together, these data provide evidence that all of the cysteine residues in LAP* are linked by disulfide bond formation. Cys11 plays a central role in determining the tertiary structure of LAP*. If the disulfide bond between Cys11 and Cys33 is disrupted by point mutation, LAP* assumes a conformation that is similar to that of LAP. Transcriptional Activity of LAP* Is Greatly Enhanced under Reducing Conditions—Having demonstrated that LAP* undergoes reduction of disulfide linkages and activation upon LPS stimulation, we then evaluated the effect of reducing power on the transcription activity of LAP*. The expression vectors of LAP* and LAP were transfected into 293T cells together with AGP-CAT reporter. Consistent with our previous results published elsewhere, LAP is more active than LAP* when tested by transient transfection experiments (15Lee Y.M. Miau L.H. Chang C.J. Lee S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4257-4263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When LAP* transfectants were treated with the reducing agents PDTC or NAC, the activ"

Residues βT304, βD305, βD302, γQ269, and γR268 were found to be very important for ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by soluble F1-ATPase, and the latter four residues were also very important for oxidative phosphorylation. The greatest effects on catalytic activity were observed by the substitution of side chains that contribute to the shortest and/or multiple H-bonds as well as the salt bridge. Residue βD305 would not tolerate substitution with Val or Ser and had extremely low activity as βD305E, suggesting that this residue is particularly important for synthesis and hydrolysis activity. These results provide evidence that tight winding of the γ subunit coiled-coil is important to the rate-limiting step in ATP hydrolysis and are consistent with an escapement mechanism for ATP synthesis in which αβγ intersubunit interactions provide a means to make substrate binding a prerequisite of proton gradient-driven γ subunit rotation.

The α and β subunits are arranged alternately similar to the sections of an orange around a central γ subunit stalk (see Fig. 1A). Catalytic activity occurs at the αβ interfaces, primarily within each β subunit. The F1 portion can be isolated from Fo and function as an ATPase (1Frasch W.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 310-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The F1 functions as an ATP driven rotary motor (2Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1960) Google Scholar), which moves through a complete 360° rotation in three discrete 120° steps. The binding of Mg2+-ATP to a catalytic site initiates a 90° rotation of the γ subunit to form an intermediate state. Following a 2-ms pause, a 30° rotation concurrent with product release completes the catalytic cycle (3Yasuda R. Noji H. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Itoh H. Nature. 2001; 410: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). the extrinsic membrane associated portion of the F1Fo-ATP synthase residues βY297-βD305 of E. coli F1-ATPase 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid Protein Data Bank crystal structure H8E Protein Data Bank crystal structure 1BMF or 1E1Q 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate. the extrinsic membrane associated portion of the F1Fo-ATP synthase residues βY297-βD305 of E. coli F1-ATPase 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid Protein Data Bank crystal structure H8E Protein Data Bank crystal structure 1BMF or 1E1Q 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate. Differences in the conformation of the γ subunit have been observed between ground state F1 structures (4Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2748) Google Scholar, 5Braig K. Menz R.I. Montgomery M.G. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E.

Cell. 2001; 106: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), a putative posttransition state structure that contains Mg2+ADP and SO42- at the low affinity catalytic site and the transition state analog Mg2+-ADP-fluoroaluminate bound at the other two catalytic sites. In this intermediate state structure, the position of the γ subunit used to attach the probe for rotation studies is rotated approximately 30° from its position in ground state structures. As a consequence, the coiled-coil of the γ subunit is more tightly wound in the (ADP·AlF4-)2F1 structure than in the ground state. The major specific interaction between the helical coiled-coil of the γ subunit and the (αβ)3 subcomplex occurs with γR268 2E. coli numbering of F1 residues is used throughout this paper.2E. coli numbering of F1 residues is used throughout this paper. and γQ269 in all of the F1 structures. These residues form a “catch” with a loop of the β subunit in the empty catalytic site conformation that encompasses residues 297–305 (Fig. 1A). In the ground state structure, this catch results from a salt bridge between γR268 and βD302 and from H-bonds among γQ269, βD302, and βT304 (Fig. 1B). In the (ADP·AlF4-)2F1 structure, the catch loop of the catalytic site with bound Mg2+-ADP and SO42- also interacts with γR268 and γQ269. However, the interactions of these residues with the catch loop in (ADP·AlF4-)2F1 differ from the ground state, such that γR268 and γQ269 are rotated approximately 15° as shown in Fig. 1C. Among other differences, γR268 forms a second salt bridge with βD305 of the catch loop in (ADP·AlF4-)2F1. The region of the γ subunit that interacts with the β subunit catch loop was one of three γ subunit locations where second site mutations suppressed the deleterious effects of ATP synthase activity caused by the F1 γM23K mutant (7Al-Shawi M.K. Ketchum C.J. Nakamoto R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2300-2306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, Al-Shawi et al. (7Al-Shawi M.K. Ketchum C.J. Nakamoto R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2300-2306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) concluded that γM23K decreases the coupling efficiency of F1Fo because of an increase in the energy of interaction between β and γ subunits. Catch loop residue βY297 is approximately 5.5 Å from the terminal phosphate in the conformation of the catalytic site that binds Mg2+-AMPPNP (4Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2748) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutants of this residue in Chlamydomonas chloroplast F1 decreased Mg2+-ATPase activity and changed the electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum of vanadyl bound as VO2+-ATP to the low affinity catalytic site (8Chen W. Frasch W.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7729-7735Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). These changes indicated that this functional surrogate for the Mg2+ cofactor used βY297 as a metal ligand during the initial binding of metal-nucleotide to the empty catalytic site. Based on these observations, it was proposed that intersubunit H-bonds between the γ subunit and the (αβ)3 ring prevent rotation driven by the proton gradient until the empty catalytic site binds substrate. Deformation of the catch loop-γ subunit interactions induced by substrate binding would provide an escapement mechanism that would maintain tight coupling between the proton-motive force and ATP synthesis. In this study, we have mutated γR268 and γQ269 as well as residues in the catch loop of the β subunit to assess the importance of the intersubunit interactions at this location to catalytic activity. The results presented here suggest that these subunit interactions are very important to ATP hydrolysis and synthesis. Plasmid p3U+ containing the entire Escherichia coli unc operon and the AN887 strain of E. coli, which contains a Mu phage suppression of the endogenous unc operon, were a generous gift from T. Duncan and R. Cross. Plasmid pLysS (Novagen) that encodes T7 lysozyme was inserted to assist with breaking of the E. coli cells and to provide chloramphenicol resistance. Transformation of the AN887 strain by plasmid pLysS resulted in the strain ANLS. Construction of pXL1 was performed by insertion of a six-histidine residue tag immediately after the start codon of unc A, which encodes the F1 α subunit, using the Stratagene Chameleon double-stranded site-directed mutagenesis kit. The mutagenic primer was 5′-TAAGGGGACTGGAGCATGCATCACCATCACCATCACCAGCTGAATTCCACCGAA-3′. The underlined base insertions add a His6 tag, whereas the boldface base change introduces a PvuII site (CAA to CAG). The selection primer utilized was 5′-CTGTGACTGGTGACGCGTCAACCAAGTC-3′. Here the underlined base changes convert the unique restriction site ScaI to MluI (AGTACT to ACGCGT). The desired mutations were first identified by screening with PvuII and then confirmed by DNA sequencing using ABI prism automatic sequencing as were the sequences of all of the other mutations. Strain AN887 was transformed via insertion of pXL1 by electroporation (9Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A further mutation, γS193C, was made to facilitate attachment of rotation probes for future studies. The mutagenic primer utilized was 5′-CTGCCGTTACCGGCATGCGATGATGATGATCTG-3′, and an XmnI restriction site was deleted through the following mutagenic primer 5′-CATCATTGGAAAACGCTCTTCGGGGCG-3′. The resulting cell line that contains the His6 tag, γS193C mutation, and XmnI deletion is referred to as XL10. The γR268L, γQ269L, βD302V, βT304A, βD302T, βD305V, βD305S, and βD305E mutants were prepared in plasmid pXL1 using the Stratagene QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit with the oligonucleotide primers as follows: 5′-GGTATACAACAAAGCTCTTCAGGCCAGCATTACTCAG-3′ and its complement 5′-CCTGAGTAATGCTGGCCTGAAGAGCTTTGTTGTATACC-3′ for creation of γR268L; 5′-GGTATACAACAAAGCTCGTCTGGCCAGCATTACTCAGG-3′ and its complement 5′-CCTGAGTAATGCTGGCCAGACGAGCTTTGTTGTATACC-3′ for creation of γQ269L; 5′-GTATACGTACCTGCGGATGTCTTGACTGACCCG-3′ and its complement 5′-CGGGTCAGTCAAGACATCCGCAGGTACGTATAC-3′ for the creation of βD302V; 5′-CCTGCGGATGACTTGGCTGACCCGTCTCCG-3′ and its complement 5′-CGGAGACGGGTCAGCCAAGTCATCCGCAGG-3′ for the creation of βT304A; 5′-GTATACGTACCTGCGGATACCTTGACTGACCCG-3′ and its complement 5′-CGGGTCAGTCAAGGTATCCGCAGGTACGTATAC-3′ for the creation of βD302T; 5′-GCGGATGACTTGACTGTTCCGTCTCCGGC-3′ and its complement 5′-GCCGGAGACGGAACAGTCAAGTCATCCGC-3′ for the creation of βD305V; 5′-GCGGATGACTTGACTAGCCCGTCTCCGGC-3′ and its complement 5′-GCCGGAGACGGGCTAGTCAAGTCATCCGC-3′ for the creation of βD305S; and 5′-GCGGATGACTTGACTGAACCGTCTCCGGC-3′ and its complement 5′-GCCGGAGACGGTTCAGTCAAGTCATCCGC-3′ for the creation of βD305E. The resulting plasmid was used to transform the ANLS strain. The F1-ATPase was purified from E. coli using a modified form of the procedure described by Wise (10Wise J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10403-10409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown on LB agar plates enriched with 10 mm MgSO4 and 20 mm glucose containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Single colonies were picked and transferred to 250-ml flasks containing LB medium with the same supplements and grown overnight at 37 °C and shaken at 250 rpm. Overnight cultures were then transferred to 2-liter baffled flasks containing 1 liter of minimal medium (60 mm K2HPO4,40mm NaH2PO4,15 mm (NH4)2SO4) with 50 μg/ml ampicillin, 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and glucose to a final concentration of 30 mm. Cells were grown until late log phase at 37 °C and shaken at 250 rpm. The cultures were then harvested by centrifugation at 6000 × g. Prior to dissociation of F1 from Fo, membranes were washed once with 50 mm TES (pH 8.0), 40 mm ϵ-aminocaproic acid, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 4.8 mmpara-aminobenzamidine. Removal of F1 was accomplished via washing of membranes with 5 mm TES (pH 8.0), 40 mm ϵ-aminocaproic acid, 5%(v/v) glycerol, and 1.0 mm EDTA. Dithiothreitol was excluded from all of the buffers to avoid reducing the nickel column material. Membranes were then centrifuged at 100,000 × g, and the supernatant containing F1 was concentrated down to ∼5 ml via pressure dialysis using an Amicon YM100 membrane. Nickel affinity chromatography was utilized to purify the His6-tagged F1 under native conditions as described in the Qiagen nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow product manual. Proteins removed from membranes in earlier steps were exchanged into nickel column Binding Buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm imidazole, 1 mm ATP). Buffer exchange was accomplished by concentrating the crude F1 extract to <5% of the original volume by pressure dialysis using an Amicon YM100 membrane followed by dilution in Binding Buffer. Diluted F1 was stirred in the presence of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column material for 1 h and packed into a column. Unwanted proteins were removed by flushing the column in Wash Buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mm ATP). The purified His6-tagged F1 was then removed with Elution Buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 100 mm imidazole, 1 mm ATP). Succinate-dependent growth measurements were determined by growing single colonies picked from LB agar plates overnight at 37 °C and shaken at 250 rpm in 50-ml cultures of minimal medium described above with 50 μg/ml ampicillin, 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 30 mm succinate, and 600 mg/liter casein hydrolysate. Overnight cultures were then inoculated into 1-liter cultures of the same medium, grown at 37 °C, and shaken at 250 rpm. Absorbance at 600 nm was used as a measure of cell density, and the doubling time of each culture was determined in the log phase of growth. The rate of ATP hydrolysis was measured with an ATP-regenerating coupled assay that consisted of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm KCl, 2.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.15 mm-0.3 mm NADH, 50 μg/ml pyruvate kinase, 50 μg/ml lactate dehydrogenase, and 3 nm F1 with 2 mm Mg2+-ATP. The rate was determined as the change in absorbance at 340 nm using a Varian Cary 50 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer equipped with a stirred cell Peltier temperature control. The reaction was initiated by the addition of F1 to the assay mixture. Reaction rates were calculated from data collected 8–10 min after initiation of the reaction to allow for dissociation of the ϵ subunit and to minimize inhibition by entrapped Mg2+-ADP (11Kato Y. Sasayama T. Muneyuki E. Yoshida M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Arrhenius analyses of data to determine the entropic and enthalpic components of the free energy of activation were performed using standard Equations 1,2,3 (12Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19640-19648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar),EA=ΔH‡+RT(Eq. 1) ΔG‡=ΔH‡-TΔS‡(Eq. 2) ΔG‡=-RTln(Nh/RTkcat)(Eq. 3) where kcat is the turnover number, EA is the Arrhenius activation energy, N is Avogadro's number, and ΔH‡ and ΔS‡ are the enthalpic and entropic components of the changes in Gibbs free energy of activation (ΔG‡). All of the Mg2+-ATPase assays were accomplished within 5 days of the date at which the F1-ATPase preparation was completed. After this period, the preparations were found to lose activity as the result of an increase in the entropy of activation (data not shown). With the exception of βD305V and βD305S, the yield of F1 purified from the site-directed mutants to remove γ subunit-catch loop interactions was approximately the same as that isolated from the XL10 strain. Intact F1-ATPase that contained the βD305V or the βD305S mutants was never successfully isolated, and these mutations were presumed to interfere with assembly of the F1Fo-ATP synthase. The F1-ATPase isolated from E. coli with the other mutations (γR268L, γQ269L, βD302T, βD302V, βT304A, or βD305E) contained all five subunits as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). These results suggest that these latter mutations did not significantly affect the synthesis and assembly of the enzyme. The relative ability of the mutant and wild type strains to grow via oxidative phosphorylation on minimal medium in the presence of succinate was assessed by determining growth curves. The inability of βD305V and βD305S mutants to assemble intact F1-ATPase coupled with their inability to grow on minimal medium with succinate was utilized as a negative control in which the growth rate was dependent on the rate of ATP synthesis catalyzed by the F1Fo-ATP synthase. The doubling times calculated from the growth curves are summarized in Table I.Table IComparison of the relative ability of mutant and XL10 strains to grow via oxidative phosphorylation and of purified F1-ATPase to hydrolyze ATPStrainSuccinate-dependent doubling timesaConditions for growth on succinate via oxidative phosphorylation were the same as described in “Experimental Procedures.”kcat of F1-ATPase activitydConditions for ATP hydrolysis were the same as described in “Experimental Procedures.”hs-1XL102.997βD305VNGbNo growth was observed because F1Fo ATP synthase did not assemble.NDeNot determined because F1-ATPase did not assemble.βD305SNGbNo growth was observed because F1Fo ATP synthase did not assemble.NDeNot determined because F1-ATPase did not assemble.βD305ENGcNo Growth observed after 13 h.4βD302T4.33βD302V3.90βT304A2.730γR268L4.712γQ269LNGcNo Growth observed after 13 h.1a Conditions for growth on succinate via oxidative phosphorylation were the same as described in “Experimental Procedures.”b No growth was observed because F1Fo ATP synthase did not assemble.c No Growth observed after 13 h.d Conditions for ATP hydrolysis were the same as described in “Experimental Procedures.”e Not determined because F1-ATPase did not assemble. Open table in a new tab The F1Fo demonstrated very little tolerance for the substitution of βD305. In addition to the fact that substitution of this carboxyl for a hydroxyl prevented assembly of F1, the most conservative mutation, βD305E, completely impaired the succinate-dependent growth rate. The strain that contained the γQ269L mutation was also unable to grow on succinate, indicating that these residues are very important for ATP synthase activity. The ability of the strains that contained γR268L, βD302V, or βD302T mutants to grow on succinate was also significantly decreased. The doubling time of the strain containing γR268L was nearly twice that of XL10, whereas that of the strains that contained mutants of βD302 increased by approximately 1.5-fold. However, the rate of growth of the βT304A mutant on succinate was not affected. None of the mutations made to either the β or γ subunits affected the ability of the bacteria to grow on minimal medium in the presence of glucose. These results suggest that the poor growth on minimal medium with succinate was the result of impairment of the ability of the F1Fo complex to synthesize ATP. The mutations that interfered with γ subunit-catch loop interactions also affected the ATPase activity of isolated F1 significantly. Fig. 2 shows an Arrhenius plot the Mg2+-ATPase activity. With the exception of the γQ269L mutant, the mutations decreased the temperature stability of the enzyme. Although XL10-F1 was stable to 50 °C, βT304A-F1 and βD305E-F1 were stable only to 32.5 °C, whereas βD302T-F1 and γR268L-F1 reached their stability limits at 40 and 27.5 °C, respectively. Consequently, a direct comparison of the effects of the mutations on kcat was made at 25 °C where all of the enzymes were stable as shown in Table I. The F1-ATPase that contained the βD302V mutation had no detectable ATP hydrolysis activity over the temperature range of 5–50 °C despite the fact that this mutant retained partial ability to grow on minimal medium with succinate (Table I). The more conservative βD302T mutation retained approximately 3% of the XL10-F1 activity. The effect of this mutation on ATPase activity was substantially greater than its effect on succinate-dependent growth. The kcat values of βD305E-F1 and γQ269L-F1 were only 4 and 1% XL10-F1, respectively, which were comparable to their effects on the succinate-dependent growth rate. It is noteworthy that the temperature stability of the γQ269L-F1 mutant was comparable to XL10-F1 despite the fact that both ATP hydrolysis and the growth rate on succinate were significantly lower than XL10-F1. The difference in ATPase activity and succinate-dependent growth of the βT304A and γR268L mutations were 2.5–3-fold with kcat values for ATP hydrolysis that were 45 and 16% XL10-F1, respectively. When the data are plotted as in Fig. 2, the activation energy (EA) is determined directly from the slope. The values for enthalpy of activation, ΔH‡, of ATP hydrolysis are directly proportional to EA as per Equation 1 and were calculated from the data indicated by the solid lines in the Arrhenius plot as summarized at 25 °C in Fig. 3. For every mutant that retained Mg2+-ATPase activity, ΔH‡ was significantly lower than observed with XL10-F1. The γR268L mutation had the most dramatic effect on ΔH‡ with a value of 27.4 kJ/mol, which is ∼50% of the observed XL10 value of 54.7 kJ/mol. Mutants βD305E and βD302T decreased ΔH‡ to 33.6 and 37.6 kJ/mol or 61 and 68% XL10, respectively. It is noteworthy that complete removal of the hydrogen bond and the salt bridge at this location via mutant βD302V rendered the enzyme unable to hydrolyze ATP at all of the temperatures tested and that the βD305S and βD305V mutants were unable to assemble F1Fo. Mutants γQ269L and βT304A also decreased the ΔH‡ of Mg2+-ATPase activity to approximately 46.9 and 51.1 kJ/mol, respectively. Fig. 3 also shows the entropy of activation, TΔS‡, and free energy of activation, ΔG‡, derived from the data in Fig. 2. The free energy of activation is inversely proportional to kcat as per Equation 3. Because ΔG‡ is the result of the difference between ΔH‡ and TΔS‡ (Equation 2), the free energy barrier of the reaction will increase as the value of TΔS‡ becomes more negative. Although all of the mutants lowered ΔH‡, lower rates of ATP hydrolysis were observed in every case because the entropic component of the energy barrier for the reaction increased (became more negative) to a greater extent than the decrease in ΔH‡. The value of TΔS‡ for ATP hydrolysis of γR268L-F1 and βD305E-F1 was –39.4 kJ/mol, nearly a 6-fold difference from the XL10-F1 value of –7.5 kJ/mol. A 3.5- and 4.5-fold difference in TΔS‡ from that of XL10-F1 was observed with βD302T-F1 (–32.7 kJ/mol) and γQ269L-F1 (–35.7 kJ/mol), respectively. Mutant βT304A, which retained its ability to grow on succinate and had the highest kcat for ATP hydrolysis, had the smallest changes in both ΔH‡ and TΔS‡. The more negative values of TΔS‡ observed in all of these mutants are consistent with an increase in disorder due to the weakening of or loss of either a hydrogen bond or salt bridge. The results presented here imply that hydrogen bonds and salt bridges between the β subunit catch loop and the γ subunit are very important to the catalytic function of the enzyme. Residues βT304, βD305, βD302, γQ269, and γR268 were found to be very important for ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by soluble F1-ATPase, and the latter four residues were also very important for oxidative phosphorylation. At a resolution of 2.4 Å, typical of the available F1 crystal structures, it is difficult to determine whether a hydrogen bond is present or assesses its relative strength based on structural information alone. It is remarkable that single mutations to remove the possibility to make a single hydrogen bond or salt bridge outside the catalytic site can have such large effects on catalytic activity. Several of the residues in the catch loop make a more important contribution to ATP hydrolysis than to ATP synthesis. The greatest differential effects were observed with mutants to βD302, although the γR268 and βT304 mutants also affect hydrolysis to a greater extent than synthesis. Even though mutations to these latter residues caused 2.5–3-fold differences in the decrease of hydrolysis and synthesis, the results indicate that γR268 was much more important to synthesis than βT304. These differential effects probably result from the fact that ATP hydrolysis was measured with isolated F1, whereas the competency of ATP synthesis was assessed by the growth rate of the E. coli strains on succinate. In the latter case, the fully assembled F1Fo-ATP synthase may have a different rate-limiting step than isolated F1. Relationship between Catch Loop-γ Subunit Interactions and ATP Hydrolysis—The rate-limiting step of the ATPase reaction of isolated F1 occurs after a 90° rotation of the γ subunit induced by Mg2+-ATP binding (3Yasuda R. Noji H. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Itoh H. Nature. 2001; 410: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). The catalytic cycle is completed by a 30° rotation of the γ subunit concurrent with product release. In the (ADP·AlF4-)2F1 crystal structure, the portion of the γ subunit used to attach the rotation probe is rotated approximately 30° from the ground state structure (6Menz R.I. Walker J.E. Leslie A.G. Cell. 2001; 106: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). This crystal structure contains Mg2+-ADP and SO42- at the low affinity catalytic site and the transition state analog Mg2+-ADP-fluoroaluminate at the other two catalytic sites. Although the foot region of the γ subunit, the point of attachment for the rotation probe, was found to be rotated about 30° in (ADP·AlF4-)2F1, the C terminus of this subunit is in nearly the same position as the other F1 structures. Consequently, the helical coiled-coil of the γ subunit is wound more tightly in (ADP·AlF4-)2F1 than the ground state structure. This implies that some of the torque on the γ subunit generated upon substrate binding may be used to wind the coiled-coil more tightly by inducing a 120° rotation of the C terminus while the foot of the γ subunit rotates 90°. Relaxation of the coiled-coil during the final 30° rotation could contribute to the energy needed to complete the rate-limiting step of the reaction. The results presented here are consistent with a role for the intermolecular interactions of the catch loop serving to promote the formation of the tightly wound form of the coiled-coil in a manner that provides energy for the final 30° rotation during the rate-limiting step. Because product release is rate-limiting to F1-ATPase activity (3Yasuda R. Noji H. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Itoh H. Nature. 2001; 410: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar), the thermodynamic parameters measured here provide information concerning this step. Despite the fact that all of the mutants decreased ΔH‡, the changes in entropy of activation more than compensated for the more favorable values of ΔH‡, thereby significantly lowering kcat. These changes in TΔS‡ can be explained if the elimination of the salt bridges and/or H-bonds between the β subunit-catch loop and γ subunit increased the number of allowable conformations of the F1 subunits during the rate-limiting step. Although some of these additional conformations dramatically lower the activation energy barrier, and thus ΔH‡, from that of XL10-F1, many more of them are nonproductive. The additional time needed for the enzyme to adopt a productive conformation in the absence of the salt bridge or H-bond leads to the decrease in kcat. It is noteworthy that βD305, the residue that tolerated mutations least, forms a salt bridge to the γ subunit in (ADP·AlF4-)2F1, which may represent the rate-limiting conformation, but not in the ground state structures. Relationship between Catch Loop-γ Subunit Interactions and ATP Synthesis—The results presented here also indicate that catch loop-γ subunit interactions are important to ATP synthesis. The succinate-dependent growth rate of the γQ269L and βD305E strains was 1% of wild type, suggesting that these residues were essential for ATP synthase activity. The γR268L and both βD302 mutants also decrease the growth rate by 4- and 2-fold, respectively. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the residues at the catch loop serve as an escapement mechanism during ATP synthesis (12Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19640-19648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this mechanism, the trans-membrane proton gradient provides constant torque to the γ subunit (via the c-subunit ring). The interactions between the γ and αβ subunit rings prevent this rotation until the empty catalytic site binds substrate. When the H-bonds and salt bridges at the catch loop are broken as the result of substrate binding, the torque on the γ subunit is greater than the energy in the remaining H-bonds, such that rotation of the γ subunit induces the conformational changes in the catalytic sites necessary for ATP synthesis. The results presented here suggest that residues γQ269, γR268, βD305, and βD302 contribute to the restraint of the rotation of the γ subunit during ATP synthesis prior to the binding of substrate. Zhou et al. (13Zhou Y. Duncan T.M. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10583-10587Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) demonstrated that substrate binding was a prerequisite of proton gradient-driven rotation in E. coli F1Fo by direct observation of rotation via the FLAG epitope. Mutations to residues in the catch loop have been found in naturally occurring second site revertants of the inhibitory γM23K mutant (7Al-Shawi M.K. Ketchum C.J. Nakamoto R.K. J. Biol.

We note that in every case the reported revertants cause the loss or weakening of a salt bridge or an H-bond either in the catch loop or near the γ subunit C terminus. Second site mutations to restore ATP synthase activity to γQ269E or γT273V had similar effects and identified a third important location in the γ subunit N terminus (14Nakamoto R.K. al-Shawi M.K. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14042-14046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We note that several intersubunit H-bonds are present at the N terminus of the γ subunit. These results suggest that the sum of the energy in the intersubunit H-bonds and salt bridges, regardless of their location, must not be above or below a certain value for the enzyme to function. If the steps in ATP synthesis are the reverse of those during hydrolysis, the first synthesis step involves a 30° rotation of the γ subunit that forms the tightly wound coiled-coil. The available data suggest that the intersubunit H-bonds and salt bridges appear to be stronger in this conformation. Consequently, the proton-motive force may be capable of driving the 30° rotation, even though substrate has not bound to the empty catalytic site. With the mutants described here, the energy of the proton gradient may be sufficient to induce rotations greater than 30° that induce conformations of the catalytic sites not conducive to product formation. We thank Jennifer Sniegowski and David S. Lowry for assistance with construction of mutants, Kathryn Boltz for development of methods, and Laura Rodriguez for excellent technical support."
https://openalex.org/W2064536971,"In Escherichia coli, heme is delivered to cytochrome c in a process involving eight proteins encoded by the ccmABCDEFGH operon. Heme is transferred to the periplasmic heme chaperone CcmE by CcmC and from there to apocytochrome c. The role of CcmC was investigated by random as well as site-directed mutagenesis. Important amino acids were all located in periplasmic domains of the CcmC protein that has six membrane-spanning helices. Besides the tryptophan-rich motif and two conserved histidines, new residues were identified as functionally important. Mutants G111S and H184Y had a clear defect in CcmC-CcmE interaction, did not transfer heme to CcmE, and lacked c-type cytochromes. Conversely, mutants D47N, R55P, and S176Y were affected neither in interaction with nor in delivery of heme to CcmE but produced less than 10% c-type cytochromes. A strain carrying a CcmCE fusion had a similar phenotype, suggesting that CcmC is important not only for heme transfer to CcmE but also for its delivery to cytochrome c. Co-immunoprecipitation of CcmC with CcmF was not detectable although CcmE co-precipitated individually with CcmC and CcmF. This contradicts the idea of CcmCEF supercomplex formation. Our results favor a model that predicts CcmE to shuttle between CcmC and CcmF for heme delivery.

Our results favor a model that predicts CcmE to shuttle between CcmC and CcmF for heme delivery. The covalent attachment of heme to the CXXCH signature motif of apocytochromes is a critical step during cytochrome c biosynthesis. The process of cytochrome c maturation involves the formation of two thioether bonds between the vinyl groups of heme and the cysteinyl residues of apocytochrome c. Three distinct systems for the biogenesis of c-type cytochromes have evolved in different classes of organisms, which are annotated as systems I, II, and III (reviewed in Refs. 1Thöny-Meyer L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 337-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 2Xie Z. Merchant S. Biochim. Biophys.

System I is present in α- and γ-proteobacteria, Deinococcus, archaea, and protozoal and plant mitochondria. System II prevails in Gram-positive bacteria, cyanobacteria, some β-, δ-, and ϵ-proteobacteria, and plant and algal chloroplasts. System III cytochrome c maturation operates in fungal and metazoal mitochondria. The γ-proteobacterium Escherichia coli requires eight cytoplasmic membrane proteins encoded by the ccmABCDEFGH operon (5Thöny-Meyer L. Fischer F. Künzler P. Ritz D. Hennecke H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4321-4326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Grove J. Tanapongpipat S. Thomas G. Griffiths L. Crooke H. Cole J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 467-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). These proteins catalyze the covalent attachment of heme to the conserved CXXCH motifs of apocytochromes c. In E. coli, c-type cytochromes are synthesized exclusively under anaerobic respiratory conditions, under which the expression of the ccm genes is also induced (7Choe M. Reznikoff W.S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1165-1172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Rabin R.S. Stewart V. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3259-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 9Tanapongpipat S. Reid E. Cole J.A. Crooke H. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). One of the key steps in the maturation pathway is the transfer and covalent attachment of heme to the cytochrome c maturation-specific heme chaperone, CcmE (10Schulz H. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. Science. 1998; 281: 1197-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar); subsequently, heme is transferred from the holo-CcmE intermediate to apocytochrome c. It has been shown earlier that covalent binding of heme to an essential histidine (His130) of apo-CcmE requires the activity of the CcmC maturation factor (11Schulz H. Fabianek R.A. Pellicioli E.C. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6462-6467Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). CcmC is an integral membrane protein whose topology was derived from that of its homologues in Rhodobacter capsulatus and Pseudomonas fluorescens (12Goldman B.S. Beckman D.L. Monika E.M. Kranz R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5003-5008Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 13Gaballa A. Baysse C. Koedam N. Muyldermans S. Cornelis P. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). E. coli CcmC shares 41% identity and 58% similarity with its R. capsulatus homologue HelC and 52% identity and 70% similarity with its P. fluorescens homologue. According to the experimentally established membrane topology of these proteins, CcmC contains six transmembrane domains, separated by two cytoplasmic and three periplasmic domains (14Ren Q. Thöny-Meyer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32591-32596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). An E. coli ccmC in-frame deletion mutant is deficient in the production of c-type cytochromes (15Throne-Holst M. Thöny-Meyer L. Hederstedt L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), most likely because heme cannot be transferred to CcmE (11Schulz H. Fabianek R.A. Pellicioli E.C. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6462-6467Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Several ccmC mutants from different organisms have been described, which were not only affected in cytochrome c maturation but also exhibited other phenotypes. Particularly interesting was the analysis of P. fluorescens ccmC mutants, which showed that CcmC is required for the production of pyoverdines, a fluorescent siderophore (13Gaballa A. Baysse C. Koedam N. Muyldermans S. Cornelis P. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 16Gaballa A. Koedam N. Cornelis P. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In Paracoccus denitrificans, a ccmC mutant in addition to deficiencies in cytochrome c maturation and siderophore production showed intolerance to rich medium (17Page M.D. Ferguson S.J. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 3047-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The connection between these processes is not known. In the pathogenic bacterium Legionella pneumophila, CcmC was found to be required for cytochrome c production, for growth in low iron conditions, and for at least some forms of intracellular infection of eukaryotic hosts (18Viswanathan V.K. Kurtz S. Pedersen L.L. Abu-Kwaik Y. Krcmarik K. Mody S. Cianciotto N.P. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 1842-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). CcmC contains a conserved tryptophan-rich signature motif (WGXφWXWDXRLT, where φ represents an aromatic amino acid residue) (1Thöny-Meyer L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 337-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 3Kranz R. Lill R. Goldman B. Bonnard G. Merchant S. Mol.

Merchant S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4632-4639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) that resides in the second periplasmic domain (Fig. 1) and shares a high degree of similarity with the tryptophan-rich motif of CcmF, NrfE, and the CcsA homologues of type II cytochrome c maturation (21Thöny-Meyer L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, two absolutely conserved histidines are present in the first and third periplasmic domains of CcmC. Mutational analysis of these motifs of the E. coli CcmC protein revealed that they are functionally important (22Schulz H. Pellicioli E.C. Thöny-Meyer L. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 1379-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The accumulation of hydrophobic residues within the tryptophan-rich motif was initially thought to provide a platform for the binding of heme with the two conserved histidines serving as axial heme ligands (12Goldman B.S. Beckman D.L. Monika E.M. Kranz R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5003-5008Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Only recently it was shown that CcmC can bind heme and that the tryptophan-rich motif is involved in a direct interaction with CcmE (14Ren Q. Thöny-Meyer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32591-32596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Apart from the amino acids in this motif, CcmC contains several other highly conserved residues, which have never been studied so far in regard to their role in heme binding and/or delivery during cytochrome c maturation. In this study, we asked whether additional domains or amino acids are required for the function of CcmC. This is important because CcmC undergoes protein-protein interaction with at least CcmE but most likely also with CcmD, a small cytoplasm-oriented membrane protein (22Schulz H. Pellicioli E.C. Thöny-Meyer L. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 1379-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and perhaps also with the ABC transporter subunits CcmAB (23Goldman B.S. Beckman D.L. Bali A. Monika E.M. Gabbert K.K. Kranz R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 724-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although CcmC seems to bind heme (14Ren Q. Thöny-Meyer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32591-32596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), no mutants with defects in heme binding have been described so far. If CcmC is involved in heme transport across the membrane, one might find residues with membrane internal or even cytoplasmic location that are necessary for heme binding. Here, we explored on the one hand a strategy to generate random ccmC mutants deficient in cytochrome c maturation. These were identified in a genetic screen based on the colony phenotype under anaerobic respiratory growth conditions, when E. coli synthesizes up to six different c-type cytochromes (24Gon S. Patte J.C. Mejean V. Iobbi-Nivol C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5779-5786Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 25Iobbi-Nivol C. Crooke H. Griffiths L. Grove J. Hussain H. Pommier J. Mejean V. Cole J.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 119: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Their expression depends on the availability of terminal electron acceptors such as nitrate, nitrite, and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) 1The abbreviation used is: ! TMAOtrimethylamine N-oxide. in the growth medium. Any block of cytochrome c maturation would affect the cells' ability to respire anaerobically on such terminal electron acceptors. Our screen allowed the identification of cytochrome c maturation-deficient mutants in a background strain that lacks Me2SO reductase (26Sambasivarao D. Weiner J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5935-5943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This approach to identify new and important residues in CcmC was unbiased, which is important because of the high number of highly conserved residues. On the other hand, we also introduced alanines at invariant and highly conserved positions that had neither been mutated before nor hit by the random mutagenesis approach. trimethylamine N-oxide.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 263-274Google Scholar), resulting in EC28Δdms and MC1061Δdms, respectively. Construction of Plasmids and Site-directed Mutagenesis—E. coli strains DH5α (28Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8216) Google Scholar) and XL1-Blue (29Bullock W.O. Fernandez J.M. Short J.M. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 376-379Google Scholar) were used as host for clonings. The plasmids pEC816, pEC817, pEC818, pEC819, pEC820, pEC828, and pEC829 expressing CcmC with the mutations W114A, R128A, L82A, W180A, W125I, and D126A, respectively, were constructed by QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) using pEC486 as a template and the primers listed in Table II. pEC821 expressing a C-terminally truncated CcmCΔN223-K245-His6 was constructed by inverse PCR, using pEC486 as a template and the following set of divergent primers. The 5′ primer contained the coding sequence for six histidines upstream of the stop codon and a KpnI restriction site, whereas the 3′ primer contained a KpnI restriction site. The PCR product was digested with KpnI and self-ligated to obtain pEC821. pEC799 expressing CcmD and CcmE was constructed by amplifying a 680-bp NdeI-EcoRI by PCR fragment with the primers ccmDnNdeI and ccmEcEcoRI, using pEC86 as a template. This fragment was digested with NdeI and EcoRI and ligated into the 5.4-kb NdeI- and EcoRI-digested pISC2. pEC827 expressing hexahistidine-tagged CcmC along with CcmD and CcmE was constructed by the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) using pEC406 as a template. For the construction of a plasmid expressing CcmF, the ccmF gene was amplified by PCR using a forward primer containing the NdeI site and a reverse primer with an EcoRI site. A 2-kb NdeI-EcoRI fragment containing ccmF was then cloned behind the arabinose promoter of pISC2 (30Thöny-Meyer L. Künzler P. Hennecke H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), resulting in pEC825. Plasmid pEC826 expressing the CcmCE fusion protein was constructed by QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis with a primer pair that eliminates the ccmC stop codon in pEC409 by the addition of an adenine nucleotide. In plasmid pEC409, the ccmC stop codon overlaps with start codon of ccmE. The plasmids pEC803, pEC804, pEC805, pEC806, pEC807, pEC808, pEC812, pEC815, and pEC824 expressing CcmC with V177G, D47N, R55P, W119R, S176Y, L183P, D126G/H184Y, H184Y, and G111S, respectively, were obtained from the random mutagenesis as described below.Table IIOligonucleotide primers used for plasmid construction and sequencingPrimerBasesNucleotide sequence (5′–3′)UsageccmCL82A-f31ggcagcgtttattggcgcggtctggcagatgQuikChange™ primerccmCL82A-r31catctgccagaccgcgccaataaacgctgccQuikChange™ primerccmCW114A-f34ggttaccggctctgcagcgggaaaaccgatgtggQuikChange™ primerccmCW114-r34ccacatcggttttcccgctgcagagccggtaaccQuikChange™ primerccmCR128A-f34tgggtatgggatgcagcgctgacttctgaactggQuikChange™ primerccmCR128A-r34ccagttcagaagtcagcgctgcatcccatacccaQuikChange™ primerccmCY139A-f34ggtgctgctgtttttggcggtgggtgtgattgccQuikChange™ primerccmCY139A-r34ggcaatcacacccaccgccaaaaacagcagcaccQuikChange™ primerccmCW125IClaI-f43ggcacctggtgggtaatcgatgcacgtctgacttctgaactggQuikChange™ primerccmCW125IClaI-r43ccagttcagaagtcagacgtgcatcgattacccaccaggtgccQuikChange™ primerccmCD126AKpnI-f44ccgatgtggggtacctggtgggtatgggctgcacgtctgacttcQuikChange™ primerccmCD126AKpnI-r44gaagtcagacgtgcagcccatacccaccaggtaccccacatcggQuikChange™ primerccmCΔ223–245-His KpnI56ggggtacctcagtggtggtggtggtggtggtgacgcatccgcatcagcgtcagcgtggcForward primer for cloning pEC821KpnI pACYC184 positions 3541–357135ggggtacctcatatcgtcaattattacctccacggReverse PCR primer for cloning pEC821ccmCW180A-f38cattactccgtggagtgggcgaacaccctgcatcagggQuikChange™ primerccmCW180A-r38ccctgatgcagggtgttcgcccactccacggcgtaatgQuikChange™ primerccmDN NdeI26cggatccatatgacccctgcatttgcForward PCR primer for cloning pEC799ccmEC EcoRI24gggaattctcatgatgctgggtccReverse PCR primer for cloning pEC799ccmC-His-f57gaaaagaggccgtaaaacaccaccaccaccaccactgatgacccctgcatttgcttccQuikChange™primerccmC-His-r57ggaagcaaatgcaggggtcatcagtggtggtggtggtggtgtttacggcctcttttcQuikChange™ primerccmFN NdeI29ggcgatatgcatatgatgccagaaattggForward primer for cloning pEC825ccmFC EcoRI27cgggaattctcatacggcctccggcgcReverse PCR primer for cloning pEC825pACYC184 1613–162917cggcaccgtcaccctggForward PCR primerpACYC184 4011–394120cccccgttttcaccatgggcReverse PCR primer with NcoI siteccmC*E-f30gaaaagaggccgtaaaatgaatattcgccgQuikChange™ primerccmC*E-r30cggcgaatattcattttacggcctcttttcQuikChange™ primer Open table in a new tab Random Mutagenesis by Error-prone PCR—Mutations were introduced randomly into the 756-bp ccmC gene encoding a C-terminal histidine tag (-His6). PCR was performed with 10 ng of DNA template and the forward and reverse primers pACYC184 1613-1629 and pACYC184 4011-3941, respectively. The reaction was carried out in the presence of 200 μm dATP, dCTP, dTTP, 20 μm dGTP, and 180 μm dITP or in the presence of 200 μm dATP, dGTP, dTTP, 20 μm dCTP, and 180 μm dITP for 25 cycles. The PCR products were digested with NcoI and BfmI and ligated into NcoI- and BfmI-digested pEC486. The ligated product was transformed into the EC28Δdms strain. Random Mutagenesis by Using a Repair-deficient Strain—Random mutagenesis of the ccmC gene was carried out in the Stratagene XL1-Red mutator strain (Stratagene). Plasmid pEC486 containing wild-type ccmC was transformed into E. coli XL1-Red. This strain lacks three key enzymes for DNA repair, which leads to a 5000-fold increase in the mutation rate. DNA extracted from approximately 1000 colonies was extracted and electroporated into the EC28Δdms strain. DNA Sequencing—All constructs and mutants derived from PCR products were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis (Microsynth, Balgach, Switzerland). In plasmid pEC820 and pEC829, spontaneous silent mutations were found at nucleotide positions 678 and 360 of ccmC, resulting in conservative L226L and G120G changes, respectively. Cell Fractionation—For the preparation of subcellular fractions, bacterial cultures were grown anaerobically in the presence of nitrate. Periplasmic proteins obtained from 1200-ml cultures were treated with polymyxin-B sulfate as described previously (14Ren Q. Thöny-Meyer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32591-32596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For the preparation of membrane proteins, 600 ml of anaerobically grown bacterial culture were harvested, and membrane proteins were extracted as described previously (14Ren Q. Thöny-Meyer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32591-32596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Biochemical Methods—Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) and bovine serum albumin as a standard. Holo-cytochrome c550 and holo-CcmE formation was analyzed qualitatively by immunoblot and heme staining (22Schulz H. Pellicioli E.C. Thöny-Meyer L. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 1379-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Soluble cytochrome c (c550) in the periplasmic fractions was quantified by absorption difference spectroscopy using a ϵ550-536 nm of 23.2 mm-1 cm-1 (30Thöny-Meyer L. Künzler P. Hennecke H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of the His-tagged CcmC versions and of cytochrome c550-His6 was performed using monoclonal tetra-His antibodies (Qiagen) at a dilution of 1:2000. Antibodies directed against a CcmE peptide (10Schulz H. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. Science. 1998; 281: 1197-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) or a combination of the three CcmF peptides 410PLVRWGRDRPRKIRN424, 508SVERDVRMKSGDSVD522, and 630DPRYRKRVSPQKTAPE645 were used at a dilution of 1:5000 and 1:10,000, respectively. Signals were detected using goat anti-mouse IgG (for His tag detection) or goat anti-rabbit IgG (for detection of other antigens) conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Bio-Rad) as secondary antibodies and disodium 3-(4-methoxyspiro{I,2-dioxetane-3,2′-(5′-chloro)tricyclo [3.3.1.1.3,7]decan}-4-yl)phenyl phosphate (Roche Applied Science) as substrate. Heme Binding Assays—150 μg of total membrane proteins were solubilized at 4 °C for 1 h in 1 ml of solubilization buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5% lauroyl sarcosine). After centrifugation, the supernatant was treated with hemin-agarose (Sigma) or aminododecyl-agarose (Sigma) as described previously for CcmC (14Ren Q. Thöny-Meyer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32591-32596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Agarose beads were washed three times with solubilization buffer and twice with PBS to remove unbound material and then treated with 2× SDS loading dye (containing 50 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The mixture was subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE. Proteins in the gel were visualized by immunoblot analysis. Co-immunoprecipitation—0.5 mg of membrane proteins were solubilized and precipitated with 5 μl of undiluted anti-CcmE, 5 μl of undiluted anti-CcmF, or 10 μl of anti-His tag antibodies according to the method described previously (14Ren Q. Thöny-Meyer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32591-32596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed with antiserum against the tetra-His tag, CcmE, or CcmF peptides as indicated. Rationale of the Screen—In the ccmC in frame deletion mutant EC28Δdms (ΔA63-G156; ΔdmsABC::kan), the predicted trans-membrane helices II, III, and IV of CcmC together with the periplasmic domain II containing the tryptophan-rich motif are deleted. A ΔccmCΔdmsABC double mutant was constructed by P1 transduction of a ΔdmsABC::kan allele from a mutant kindly provided by Dr. J. Weiner. DmsABC constitutes an Me2SO reductase that catalyzes the reduction of Me2SO and TMAO under anaerobic conditions. The dms mutant cannot grow anaerobically on minimal medium with glycerol and Me2SO (26Sambasivarao D. Weiner J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5935-5943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the TMAO reductase allows E. coli to grow by anaerobic respiration with TMAO as a terminal electron acceptor. TMAO reductase is a hetrodimeric enzyme composed of TorA, a periplasmic reductase containing molybdenum as cofactor and TorC, a membrane-bound pentaheme c-type cytochrome. During anaerobic TMAO respiration, electrons are transferred from the menaquinone pool to TorC and then delivered to TorA, which in turn reduces TMAO to trimethylamine (31Pommier J. Mejean V. Giordano G. Iobbi-Nivol C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16615-16620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). TorC requires the cytochrome cmaturation (ccm) system composed of the CcmABCDEFGH proteins to insert the hemes covalently. Any block of TorC maturation is expected to abolish anaerobic growth on TMAO, when the alternative pathway for electron transfer via Me2SO reductase is excluded. Hence, the ΔccmCΔdms mutant had a strong anaerobic growth phenotype; in contrast to the wild type, which formed large red colonies on TMAO plates, the mutant grew poorly and was white. The remaining growth capability of this mutant may be due to yet another Me2SO reductase encoded by a second set of dmsABC genes that are expressed constitutively (32Oresnik I.J. Ladner C.L. Turner R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). When the mutant was transformed with a plasmid expressing ccmC-H6 encoding wild-type, His-tagged CcmC, the cells were red and formed normal size colonies, but when an empty vector was used as control, they were small and white. This phenotype was the basis for a color screen for ccmC mutants. Generation and Analysis of Random ccmC Mutants—Random mutations wer"
https://openalex.org/W1989968940,"The role of the opsonic receptors FcγR and CR3 on the release of arachidonic acid (AA) by human monocytes was studied using IgG-ovalbumin (OVA) equivalence immune complexes (IC), anti-OVA IgG bound to OVA-coupled latex beads, and C3bi-bound IC. Release of AA was produced by IC and latex-OVA beads bound to IgG, whereas binding of C3bi to IC inhibited the ability of IC to release AA. In contrast, coating of zymosan particles with C3bi enhanced AA release as compared with that produced by non-coated particles. Masking of C3bi on C3bi-bound IC by incubation with anti-C3 IgG resulted in the recovery of their ability to release AA, thereby suggesting that binding of C3b by IC reduces their flogogenic effects, whereas opsonization of microbial walls by complement may enhance their proinflammatory potential. The binding/uptake of opsonized zymosan particles was inhibited by anti-CR3 Ab and C3bi-bound IC, but not by β-glucan, mannan, and anti-Toll-like receptor 2 Ab. These findings show that cooperative engagement of CR3 on both the lectin-like site involved in β-glucan binding and the I-domain involved in C3bi binding, as it can be observed in the innate immune response, produces AA release, whereas the unique interaction of C3bi-bound IC with the I-domain of CR3, as it may occur in the adaptive immune response, diverts the IC lattice from a productive interaction with FcγR linked to AA release.

This is accompanied with the covalent binding of C3 to the Ag-Ab lattice when IC formation takes place in biological fluids containing complement, due to the high reactivity of the internal thioester group of C3, which becomes exposed to the solvent upon proteolytic activation of C3 (1Isenman D.E. Kells D.I. Cooper N.R. Muller-Eberhard H.J. Pangburn M.K. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4458-4467Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). IC containing covalently bound C3b have the capacity to interact with receptors for the Fc portion of the IgG molecule (FcγR) and with CR3 (complement receptor type 3, Mac-1, αMβ2 integrin, CD18/CD11b).

The study of several models of immune-mediated tissue injury in mice with a targeted disruption of the γ-chain of FcγR has made it possible to discriminate between IC deposition and the inflammatory response produced by IC, thereby depicting a model of IC-mediated injury in which FcγR-mediated events rather than the complement system are critical to the tissue damage (2Sylvestre D.L. Ravetch J.V. Science. 1994; 265: 1095-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 3Hazenbos W.L. Gessner J.E. Hofhuis F.M. Kuipers H. Meyer D. Heijnen I.A. Schmidt R.E. Sandor M. Capel P.J. Daeron M. van de Winkel J.G.J. Verbeek J.S. Immunity. 1996; 5: 181-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). However, the existence of a complex regulatory interplay between complement and the FcγR route is supported by a number of observations: (i) the solubilization and clearance of IC by complement (4Miller G.W. Nussenzweig V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), (ii) the inhibition of the interaction of IC with FcγR in lymphocytes produced by the covalent binding of C3bi to Fc (5Eden A. Bianco C. Nusenzweig V. Cell. Immunol. 1973; 7: 459-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and (iii) the hypersensitivity to renal injury by IC elicited by low plasma levels of C3 (6Pickering M.C. Cook H.T. Warren J. Bygrave A.E. Moss J. Walport M.J. Botto M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Furthermore, clinical studies have shown an increased incidence of immune-mediated diseases in patients with reduced levels of complement factors (7Morgan B.P. Walport M.J. Immunol. Today. 1991; 12: 301-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Studies of several models of immune-mediated inflammation have disclosed a role for lipid mediators in the mediation of the early extravasation of protein-rich plasma (8Steil A.A. Garcia Rodriguez M.C. Alonso A. Sánchez Crespo M. Bosca L. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 114: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and in the late inflammatory response (9Choi I.W. Kim Y.S. Kim D.K. Choi J.H. Seo K.H. Im S.Y. Kwon K.S. Lee M.S. Ha T.Y. Lee H.K. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), whereas the recruitment of leukocytes is mainly explained by the production of chemokines (10Marsh C.B. Gadek J.E. Kindt G.C. Moore S.A. Wewers M.D. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3161-3167PubMed Google Scholar, 11Standiford T.J. Kunkel S.L. Lukacs N.W. Greenberger M.J. Danforth J.M. Kunkel R.G. Strieter R.M. J.

These responses have been related to the cross-linking of FcγR receptors; however, most studies have been conducted in mice, which express FcγR subtypes different from those present in human cells (13Daeron M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 203-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar, 14Ravetch J.V. Bolland S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 275-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar). For instance, murine leukocytes express the inhibitory FcγRII receptor (the murine homologue of human FcγRIIB), whereas human monocytes express FcγRIIA and FcγRIII is only detected in about 10% of human blood monocytes (15Passlic B. Flieger D. Ziegler-Hetbrock H.W. Blood. 1989; 74: 2527-2534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we have addressed the effects of both native IC and IC covalently bound to C3bi (C3bi-IC) on the release of arachidonic acid (AA) by human mononuclear cells, and compared these effects with those elicited by C3bi attached to other structures, for instance zymosan particles and F(ab′)2-coated latex beads. Our data show triggering of the AA cascade by FcγR cross-linking in monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages. However, binding of C3bi to IC diminishes their capacity to release AA, whereas binding of C3bi to zymosan particles has the opposite effect. These data show the existence of a diversity of signaling processes associated to opsonic receptors, which allow coupling of phagocytosis to proinflammatory events under conditions strongly dependent on the nature of the engulfed particle and the presence of associated C3bi molecules. Reagents—Anti-human CD11b/Mac-1 IgG1 mAb was from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-human C3 Ab was a gift from Dr. Fernando Vivanco, Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Madrid, Spain. The IgG fraction of this antiserum was purified by FPLC using a protein G-Superose column (Amersham Biosciences). Zymosan particles conjugated with Alexa Fluor® 488 were from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR). Goat anti-human C3 Ab, zymosan, soluble β-glucan from seaweed (laminarin, ∼8 kDa), soluble mannan from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and carboxylate-modified latex beads were from Sigma Chemical Co. Rabbit polyclonal Ab against Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR-2) and TLR-4 were a kind gift from Drs. Keith Ray and Ginette Squires from GlaxoSmithKline R & D (Stevenage, UK). IgG-OVA equivalence IC were made according to classical procedures with optimal amounts of antigen using IgG Ab raised in rabbits by s.c. injections of OVA in CFA, followed by booster i.m. IgG Ab were purified from heat-inactivated serum by precipitation with ammonium sulfate. Solutions of both OVA and Ab were sterilized by ultrafiltration before use. Binding of C3 to IC—To obtain IC bound covalently to C3bi, IC were extensively washed with PBS and incubated with NHS under conditions that allow the activation of the complement system through the alternative pathway. For this purpose, 100 μl of a suspension containing 100 μg of IC were incubated for 15 min with 800 μl of NHS depleted of Ca2+ and Mg2+ by treatment with Chelex-100, and then supplemented with 5 mm Mg2+. The reaction was stopped with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS, and the precipitates were washed three times with the same buffer. Binding of C3 to IC under the aforementioned conditions does not produce dissociation of antigen-antibody complexes as determined by the lack of significant appearance of free antigen in the supernatant (16Alcolea J.M. Antón L.C. Marqués G. Sánchez Corral P. Vivanco F. Complement. 1987; 4: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Moreover, this procedure mimics the solubilization of IC deposited in tissues and is characterized by an efficient incorporation of C3b molecules onto the Ab (17Vivanco F. Muñoz E. Vidarte L. Pastor C. Mol. Immunol. 1999; 36: 843-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The formation of ester bonds between C3bi and IgG γ-chain was demonstrated by the presence of high molecular mass protein adducts sensitive to hydroxylamine treatment (18Takata Y. Tamura N. Fujita T. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 2531-2537PubMed Google Scholar). The coupling of C3bi was further confirmed by immunoblotting using anti-C3 polyclonal Ab. Zymosan was opsonized with NHS for 15 min at 37 °C, followed by extensive washing with PBS. Preparation of IgG-coated Latex Beads—OVA was coupled to 1-μm carboxylate-modified latex beads by incubation with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide, using a two-step procedure to improve OVA incorporation. Coating of the OVA-coupled beads with IgG was carried out by incubation with anti-OVA IgG purified by protein G chromatography. Anti-OVA F(ab′)2 was obtained by pepsin digestion of purified IgG from rabbit anti-OVA antiserum, followed by protein A chromatography to remove both undigested IgG and Fc fragments. Coupling of C3bi to latex beads was carried out on beads coated with both anti-OVA IgG and F(ab′)2, according to the protocol described for IC. C3bi coupling to the beads was monitored by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Cell Culture, Metabolic Labeling, and Assay of [3H]AA Release— THP-1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Human monocytes were isolated from peripheral blood of healthy volunteer donors by centrifugation onto Ficoll cushions and adherence to plastic dishes for 2 h. At the end of this period, non-adhered cells were removed by extensive washing. Radioactive labeling with [3H]AA was performed by overnight incubation of cells in the absence of serum and the presence of 0.25 μCi/ml [3H]AA in 0.25% essentially fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. After labeling, cells were washed with medium and allowed to equilibrate at 37 °C in medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin, before the addition of agonists or vehicle. The release of [3H]AA into the culture medium was measured by scintillation counting. Contamination of platelets under these conditions of cell isolation and labeling was less than 2 platelets per monocyte. Human platelets were obtained by centrifugation of platelet-rich plasma and pelleting, prior to labeling with [3H]AA. Differentiation of monocytes into macrophages was conducted by culture of adhered monocytes in the presence of autologous serum for 2-3 weeks in Primaria 6-well dishes (Falcon Plastics Inc.), in the absence of exogenous cytokine cocktails. Immunoblotting of cPLA2—Protein extracts were collected from culture dishes in ice-cold extraction buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4. The amount of protein in each cell lysate was assayed using the Bradford reagent, and 100 μg of protein sample were loaded on each lane of a 10% acrylamide SDS/PAGE gel. Nonspecific protein binding sites in the membranes were blocked with 5% milk in TBS supplemented with 0.05% Tween®-20, and incubated with an anti-cPLA2 mAb from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-454). This was followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG Ab. Detection was performed using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Assay for Phagocytosis and Flow Cytometry—Cells were incubated for different times with zymosan particles conjugated with Alexa Fluor® 488 at the concentration of 5 particles per cell at 37 °C. Subsequently, cells were washed, treated with 100 units/ml lyticase in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature in order to dissolve extracellular zymosan, and then resuspended in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1 mm EDTA for analysis by flow cytometry in a FACScan® cytofluorometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Parallel controls were performed at 4 °C to block endocytic uptake of the particles. The surface display of CD11b was determined by indirect immunofluorescence with anti-human CD11b/Mac-1 IgG1 mAb, followed by washing with PBS, and incubation with goat anti-mouse IgG-FITC conjugate (Sigma) 1:100 for 30 min at 4 °C. Isotype-matched irrelevant Ab was used as control. Stimulation of Human Monocytes via Both FcγR and CR3 Induces [3H]AA Release—Previous studies in the human monocytic cell line THP-1 showed that stimulation of FcγR failed to release [3H]AA (19Fernández N. Renedo M. Sánchez Crespo M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), thus suggesting that FcγRI and FcγRIIA, which are the types of FcγR receptors expressed in this cell line, do not trigger the cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) route, i.e. the enzyme pathway involved in the selective release of AA from membrane phospholipids. To address whether this lack of response of the cPLA2 pathway was a general property of AA metabolism in THP-1 cells or whether this was restricted to some stimuli, THP-1 cells were activated with complement-coated zymosan particles, a stimulus resembling opsonized microbial agents, which induces AA release by acting through the β2 integrin Mac-1/CR3 (20Thornton B.P. Vetvicka V. Pitman M. Goldman R.C. Ross G.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1235-1246PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions [3H]AA release was not observed (data not shown), despite the facts that THP-1 cells expressed CR3, as judged form the surface display of CD11b demonstrated by flow cytometry (Fig. 1A), and engulfed complement-coated zymosan particles (Fig. 1, B and C). Taken together these findings suggest that THP-1 cells, which are a good model to study the responses involving transcriptional regulation and gene expression in response to FcγR cross-linking (21Fernández N. Renedo M. García-Rodríguez M.C. Sánchez Crespo M. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 3321-3328Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), may be activated by physiological stimuli without a concomitant release of AA, thus agreeing with the low amounts of eicosanoids yielded by these cells in the absence of phorbol ester- and dimethyl sulfoxide-induced differentiation (22Hanasaki K. Ono T. Saiga A. Morioka Y. Ikeda M. Kawamoto K. Higashino K. Nakano K. Yamada K. Ishizaki J. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34203-34211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Since unlike monocytes, THP-1 cells do not show spontaneous adherence to plastic dishes, experiments were conducted in human monocytes to determine whether the absence of adherence-induced signals could account for the lack of FcγR-mediated AA release of THP-1 cells. As shown in Fig. 2, adherence of monocytes to plastic dishes is not a requirement for [3H]AA release, since non-adhered mononuclear cells released [3H]AA in response to both IC and opsonized zymosan. Because platelets may be present in mononuclear cell preparations and express FcγRIIA, some experiments were conducted on platelets to address their potential contribution to [3H]AA release. Addition of IC at the dose of 100 μg/ml for 90 min at 37 °C to [3H]AA-labeled human platelets did not elicit [3H]AA release above that found in control cells (data not shown). Moreover, non-adhered mononuclear cells did not release [3H]AA in response to thrombin (Fig. 2), an agonist known to induce AA release in platelets, thus indicating that platelet contamination does not account for the release of [3H]AA elicited by IC on human mononuclear cells. To rule out the possible contribution to [3H]AA release of the lymphocytes present in the preparation of mononuclear cells, further experiments were carried out in adhered monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages. As shown in Fig. 2, these cell populations released [3H]AA in response to both physiological and non-physiological agonists. Since LPS is a potential contaminant of many biological reagents, the effect of concentrations of Escherichia coli LPS known to be active on the NF-κB route coupled to the TLR-4 system was addressed. LPS concentrations of 1 and 10 μg/ml did not elicit [3H]AA release on human monocytes, thus making it unlikely that contamination by LPS could account for the effect of IC on [3H]AA release (Fig. 2). The temporal course of [3H]AA release elicited by IC was similar to that produced by opsonized zymosan particles (Fig. 3A). As regards the dose-dependence, maximal release was observed with 100 μg/ml IC, whereas higher concentrations induced the release of lower amounts of [3H]AA (Fig. 4A). In contrast, [3H]AA release induced by engagement of CR3 by opsonized zymosan particles plateaued at a concentration of 1 mg/ml and did not show significant changes at higher concentrations (Fig. 3B). To confirm that the enhancing effect of serum on the ability of zymosan particles to release [3H]AA was dependent on the activation of the complement system, some experiments were conducted using serum depleted of Ca2+ and Mg2+ by treatment with Chelex-100. As shown in Fig. 3B, this treatment did not modify the effect of zymosan particles, thus making it unlikely that serum components other than complement factors could account for the observed effect.Fig. 2[3H] AA release by non-adhered mononuclear cells, adhered monocytes, and macrophages. Monocytes adhered to plastic dishes and macrophages derived from monocytes by 2-week culture in the presence of autologous serum were labeled with [3H]AA and stimulated for 90 min in the presence of vehicle or the indicated additions. The combination of 32 nm PMA and 1 μm ionophore A23187 was used as a positive control to produce [3H]AA release by a mechanism not dependent on the expression of functional receptors on the cell surface.

B, adhered monocytes were incubated with different concentrations of zymosan, complement-coated zymosan, and zymosan incubated with NHS treated with Chelex-100 to remove Ca2+ and Mg2+ to block the activation of the complement system.

Nussenzweig V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 23Takahashi M. Takahashi S. Brade V. Nussenzweig V. J. Clin. Invest. 1978; 62: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The formation of these complexes was verified by SDS-PAGE and confirmed by the sensitivity of the formation of these adducts to Mg2+ and Ca2+ chelation (Fig. 4C), and hydroxylamine treatment (Fig. 4D), as well as by immunoblotting with a polyclonal anti-human C3 Ab, which disclosed the presence of some protein bands (Fig. 4E), the Mr of which was similar to that assigned to the Coomassie-stained protein bands. Of note, the [3H]AA release induced by C3bi-IC was significantly lower than that induced by IC containing similar amounts of IgG (Fig. 4A), thus suggesting that the reaction of IC with C3bi gives rise to a IC lattice showing a distinct ability to interact with signaling receptors, most likely due to the ability of C3bi-IC to interact with CR3, in such way that it inhibits their ability to induce [3H]AA release through FcγR. Treatment of C3bi-IC with anti-C3 IgG, but not with an irrelevant rabbit IgG, allowed the recovery of the ability to release [3H]AA (Fig. 4F), thus indicating that masking the C3bi moieties with IgG in the C3bi-IC lattice makes these complexes similar to those formed in the absence of complement. Evidence of the involvement of the cPLA2 route in the release of [3H]AA was obtained by addressing the appearance of the bandshift of the enzyme produced by phosphorylation on Ser-505 by MAP kinases. As shown in Fig. 4B, IC elicited a time-dependent phosphorylation of macrophage cPLA2 which was slightly detectable 5 min after addition of the stimulus, but which did not reach its maximal extent until 30 min, thus agreeing with the protracted pattern of [3H]AA release observed. Since these experiments suggested that the interaction of IgG with FcγR through the Fc portion is important for the induction of AA release, the effect of the removal of Fc portion on the ability of IC to release [3H]AA was addressed using OVA-coupled latex beads coated with anti-OVA F(ab′)2, taking advantage of the ability of F(ab′)2 to bind covalently to C3bi on the Ser-132 of the CH1 domain (24Vidarte L Pastor C. Mas S. Blazquez A.B. de los Rios V. Guerrero R. Vivanco F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38217-38223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 5A shows the characterization by SDS-PAGE of IgG-C3bi and F(ab′)2-C3bi adducts coupled to the latex-OVA beads. Fig. 5B shows the sensitivity of these adducts to hydroxylamine treatment as in the case of IgG-OVA IC. Moreover, immunoblotting with anti-C3 polyclonal Ab allows the detection of C3 associated to well characterized protein bands (Fig. 5C). Stimulation of monocytes with anti-OVA IgG coated latex-OVA beads produced a significant [3H]AA release, whereas this was not observed when latex-OVA beads were coated with F(ab′)2 nor with latex-OVA beads coated with F(ab′)2 and coupled to C3bi, thereby indicating that Fc-FcγR interaction is essential for IC-induced [3H]AA release and that stimulation through C3bi does not elicit productive binding in this system (Fig. 5D). Effect of Opsonic versus Non-opsonic Stimulation of Monocytes—β-Glucan shares with C3bi the ability to interact with CR3, although on different portions of the receptor molecule (20Thornton B.P. Vetvicka V. Pitman M. Goldman R.C. Ross G.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1235-1246PubMed Google Scholar). Coating with C3bi significantly enhanced the ability of zymosan particles to release [3H]AA in human monocytes, as well as the phagocytic uptake of the particles by both THP-1 cells and monocyte-derived macrophages (Fig. 1, C and D), thus suggesting that contrary to IC, opsonization of zymosan particles may enhance their proinflammatory properties. Since cell receptors such as dectin-1 (25Brown G.D. Taylor P.R. Reid D.M. Willment J.A. Williams D.L. Martinez-Pomares L. Wong S.Y. Gordon S. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar), a mannan-dependent receptor (26Taylor P.R. Brown G.D. Reid D.M. Willment J.A. Martínez-Pomares L. Gordon S. Wong S.Y.C. J.

As shown in Fig. 6, mannan elicited significant [3H]AA release at concentrations above 5 mg/ml, this effect being additive with that produced by opsonized zymosan. In contrast, the soluble β-glucan laminarin, which is a genuine ligand of dectin-1 (25Brown G.D. Taylor P.R. Reid D.M. Willment J.A. Williams D.L. Martinez-Pomares L. Wong S.Y. Gordon S."

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2799-2809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It provides an alternative mechanism to a hydrophobic transmembrane domain for membrane attachment and enables stable but reversible anchoring of a protein to the lipid bilayer (2McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). GPI anchor addition occurs during the initial stages of nascent protein entry into the secretory pathway, and by its very nature must occur post-translationally. The preformed GPI moiety is transferred en bloc to the carboxyl terminus of a precursor protein very soon after translocation of the polypeptide chain across the ER membrane (3Bangs J.D. Hereld D.

Sci. 1992; 17: 470-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The precursor protein contains two signal sequences to ensure GPI anchor addition, one at the amino terminus targeting the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum and one at the carboxyl terminus for recognition by the GPI-anchoring machinery (5Udenfriend S. Micanovic R. Kodukula K. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1991; 15: 739-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The signal for GPI anchor addition is characterized by a carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic domain preceded by a short hydrophilic spacer linked to the GPI anchor attachment (ω) site (6Udenfriend S. Kodukula K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 563-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic domain shares many characteristics with a classical transmembrane domain, which has led to the suggestion that this region could partition into the lipid bilayer either during or soon after protein translocation (7Berger J. Micanovic R. Greenspan R.J. Udenfriend S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1457-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Irrespective of this partitioning event the recognition of the carboxyl-terminal signal sequence by the enzyme catalyzing GPI anchor addition occurs rapidly following completion of protein synthesis (8Kodukula K.

The enzyme responsible for GPI anchor addition has been termed a transamidase as it catalyzes the cleavage of the carboxyl-terminal signal sequence and the concomitant addition of a preformed GPI anchor (9Maxwell S.E.

The GPI transamidase is a multisubunit complex containing at least five polypeptide chains. These have been identified both by genetic (10Hamburger D. Egerton M. Riezman H. J.

Gpi8p belongs to a novel family of cysteine proteases and has been shown both to bind to the polypeptide substrate (15Vidugiriene J. Vainauskas S. Johnson A.E. Menon A.K. Eur. J.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3461-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The other components of the complex are less well characterized, but it is clear that the presence of each polypeptide is essential for activity of the complex (14Ohishi K. Inoue N. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4088-4098Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). A non-functional protein complex will form in the absence of Gpi8p, Gaa1p, or PIG-S but not in the absence of PIG-T, leading to the suggestion that PIG-T functions to assemble the complex (14Ohishi K. Inoue N. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4088-4098Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The exact function of each of the components of the complex along with their functional interaction with each other, the precursor protein, and the GPI anchor remains to be fully elucidated. The close similarity between the hydrophobic region of the GPI anchor signal sequence and a hydrophobic transmembrane domain raises the question of whether the translocon can distinguish between the two and whether they share common mechanisms of membrane insertion. Transmembrane domains are usually flanked by charged residues carboxyl-terminal to the hydrophobic domain that act as stop transfer signals preventing full translocation through the translocon pore (18High S. Dobberstein B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The transmembrane domains are then thought to partition into the lipid bilayer by lateral gating of the subunits of the translocon (19Martoglio B. Hofmann M.W. Brunner J. Dobberstein B. Cell. 1995; 81: 207-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether a similar mechanism of membrane insertion occurs during GPI signal sequence translocation or whether the GPI anchor signal is fully translocated into the lumen of the ER prior to recognition by the transamidase. Uncleaved precursors of GPI-anchored proteins are not membrane-associated suggesting that the hydrophobic sequence does not partition into the lipid bilayer (20Delahunty M.D. Stafford F.J. Yuan L.C. Shaz D. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12017-12027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Modification of the hydrophobic domain that results in a lack of translocation across the ER membrane also prevents GPI anchor addition, indirectly suggesting that full translocation of the signal across the lipid bilayer is required for recognition by the transamidase and GPI anchor addition (21Wang J. Maziarz K. Ratnam M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1303-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These results would suggest that the signal is fully translocated into the ER lumen, although such a mechanism has not been proven directly and seems counterintuitive given the hydrophobic nature of the GPI anchor signal sequence. We approached the question of GPI anchor signal sequence translocation and the requirements for membrane integration by translation of a number of variants of the model GPI-anchored substrate prepromini-PLAP (22Kodukula K. Micanovic R. Gerber L. Tamburrini M. Brink L. Udenfriend S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4464-4470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a cell-free system (16Spurway T.D. Dalley J.A. High S. Bulleid N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15975-15982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). By the addition of N-glycosylation sites close to and within the GPI anchor signal sequence we probed the accessibility of the signal to the oligosaccharyltransferase and thereby determined whether the signal is fully translocated into the ER lumen. We showed conclusively that the signal is indeed fully translocated and that the hydrophobic domain of a GPI anchor signal sequence cannot function as a transmembrane domain even when flanked by charged residues. Interestingly we found that a single amino acid change can convert the hydrophobic domain within the GPI signal to an authentic transmembrane domain that becomes fully integrated into the ER membrane. These results highlight the crucial role played by hydrophobic domains of transmembrane proteins that prevent full translocation thereby allowing membrane integration via lateral gating of the translocon. Plasmid Construction—The cDNA encoding mini-PLAP was a gift from Dr. M. E. Medof (Case Western Reserve, University, Cleveland, OH). Mini-membrane PLAP was constructed by extension PCR of full-length (FL)-PLAP (16Spurway T.D. Dalley J.A. High S. Bulleid N.J. J. Biol.

FL-membrane PLAP was digested with StuI and HindIII, and the resulting 390-bp StuI/HindIII fragment was subcloned into a StuI/HindIII-digested and purified pGem3Z/mini-PLAP, creating the plasmid pGem3Z/mini-membrane. Signal vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)G and signal VSVG-G were created by extension PCR from FL-PLAP template using the following primers: 5′ oligonucleotide primer 5′-CGCGGCTTCTTCCTCTTCGTG-3′ was complementary to a sequence upstream of a StuI restriction enzyme site in FL-PLAP; 3′ primers, for signal VSVG, 5′-CTGTCTTTTCTTGGTGTGCTTTAATTTAATGCAAAGATGGATACCAACTCGGGGAGCAGTGGCCGTCTCCAG-3′, and for signal VSVG-G, 5′-CTGTCTTTTCTTGGTGTGCTTTAATTTAATGCAAAGATGGATACCAACTCGGGGAGCAGTGGCGTTCTCCAG-3′. The consecutive 3′ primer was used for both signal VSVG and signal VSVG-G2 and was 5′-CACGTCGTGAAGCTTTTACT TTCCAAGTCGGTTCATCTCTATGTCTGTATAAATCTGTCTTTTCTTGGTGTGC-3′ and contained a stop codon and a HindIII restriction enzyme site.

TM-VSVG was created using a previously constructed FL-PLAP TM-VSVG construct. FL-PLAP TM-VSVG was created by extension PCR with the following primers: 5′ oligonucleotide primer 5′-CGCGGCTTCTTCCTCTTCGTG-3′ was complementary to a sequence upstream of a StuI restriction enzyme site in FL-PLAP and the overlapping 3′ primers 5′-TAGTCCAATGATTAACCCTATGATAAAGAAAAAAGAGGCAATAGACCGCCCCGGGTGCGCGGCGTC-3′, 5′-GGTGTGCTTTAATTTAATTTAATGCAAAGATGGATACCAACTCGGAGAACCAAGAATAGTCCAATGATTAACCCTATG-3′, and 5′-GCGGCAGGACTCGAGTTACTTTCCAAGTCGGTTCATCTCTATGTCTGTATAAATCTGTCTTTTCTTGGTGTGCTTTAATTTAATGCAAAG-3′.

The resulting construct was digested with XhoI and KpnI and subcloned into a XhoI/KpnI-digested and purified pGem4Z/mini-PLAP. Introduction of glycosylation sequons within mini-PLAP and mini-membrane was achieved by site-directed mutagenesis using the following sense primers: G1 glycosylation mutant A175N, 5′-CTGGCGCCCCCCAACGGCACCACCGAC-3′; G2 glycosylation mutant T204N, 5′-CTGCT-GGAGAACGCCACTGCTCCC-3′.

Transcription in Vitro—Transcription reactions were carried out as described previously (23Gurevich V.V. Pokrovskaya I.D. Obukhova T.A. Zozulya S.A. Anal.

Preparation of Semipermeabilized Cells—The human lymphoblastoid cell line K562 was obtained from the European collection of animal cell cultures. The cell line was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Semipermeabilized (SP) cells were prepared by treatment with digitonin as described previously (24Wilson R. Allen A.J. Oliver J. Brookman J.L. High S. Bulleid N.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Translation in Vitro—Protein was synthesized using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Flexilysate™, Promega). The translation reaction (25 μl) contained 16.5 μl of reticulocyte lysate, 40 μm methionine-free amino acid mixture, 45 mm KCl, 15 μCi of l-[35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 1 μl of transcribed mRNA, and SP cell preparation (∼2 × 105 cells). Hydrazine (10 mm) was included in translations where indicated. Translations were incubated at 30 °C for 60 min and were terminated by centrifugation (12,000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C) to isolate SP cells. Translated products were then processed for further analysis as described below. To be noted, all translations were preformed in triplicate. Endoglycosidase H Treatment—Following translation, isolated SP cells were solubilized in endoglycosidase H dissolution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% (w/v) SDS) for 5 min at 95 °C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (13,000 × g for 10 min). An equal volume of 150 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5, containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mm) was added to the soluble fraction. The samples were divided into two equal aliquots and incubated for 12 h at 37 °C with either 1 unit of endoglycosidase H (Roche Applied Science) or buffer alone. Treated and untreated samples were then subjected to immunoisolation with amino antibody and analysis by SDS-PAGE. Proteinase K Digestion—After translation isolated cells were resuspended in KHM buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 110 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate) supplemented with 10 mm CaCl2 and were treated with proteinase K (Roche Applied Science) at a concentration of 250 μg/ml for 30 min at 0 °C either in the presence or absence of 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Following digestion samples were treated with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) to terminate proteinase K digestion. Samples were immunoisolated with amino antibody and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. Immunoisolation—The amino polyclonal rabbit antibody, which specifically recognizes amino-terminal signal sequence-cleaved PLAP, was produced as described previously (16Spurway T.D. Dalley J.A. High S. Bulleid N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15975-15982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For immunoisolation, SP cells were solubilized in 500 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.02% (w/v) azide) and incubated with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose (10%, w/v) (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 30 min at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged to remove protein A-bound cell contaminants, and precleared supernatants were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose and 2 μl of amino antibody. After incubation protein A-Sepharose-bound material was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 1 min, washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer, and then subjected to analysis by SDS-PAGE. Electrophoresis—Samples for SDS-PAGE were resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (0.065 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.02% (w/v) bromphenol blue) plus 50 mm DTT and were boiled for 5 min. Proteins were resolved through 12.5% gels, fixed in 10% (v/v) acetic acid, 10% (v/v) methanol, and dried, and labeled products were visualized by autoradiography or imaged using a Fuji BAS 2000 phosphorimaging system. We have previously shown that the initial stages of GPI anchor addition can be faithfully reconstituted by translating a model GPI-anchored protein in the presence of SP cells derived from cells grown in culture (16Spurway T.D. Dalley J.A. High S. Bulleid N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15975-15982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Here we used this experimental approach to investigate the ability of the ER translocon to fully translocate the hydrophobic region of the GPI anchor signal sequence. Recognition of the GPI anchor signal by the transamidase could occur following complete translocation of the polypeptide chain across the ER membrane requiring a rapid recognition of the signal by the transamidase in the aqueous environment of the ER lumen (Fig. 1A). Alternatively the translocon could recognize and bind to the hydrophobic sequence preventing full translocation and allowing integration into the lipid bilayer by lateral gating of the translocon prior to interaction with the transamidase (Fig. 1B). To investigate these two alternative models we constructed variants of the GPI-anchored protein prepromini-PLAP, creating a potential glycosylation site either just amino-terminal to the cleavage site or within the hydrophobic portion of the GPI anchor signal sequence (Fig. 2). Prepromini-PLAP is not normally glycosylated so the addition of an oligosaccharide side chain would indicate that the glycosylation site is accessible to the machinery for N-linked glycosylation. We also created variants that contain additional sequence at the carboxyl terminus of the GPI anchor signal. These additional sequences include either a series of charged residues that would be predicted to act as a stop transfer signal or a naturally occurring cytosolic domain from VSVG protein. Further variants were constructed whereby the hydrophobic region of the signal for GPI anchor addition was either modified, by changing a single charged residue to a more hydrophobic residue, or replaced with the transmembrane region from VSVG protein with or without the cytosolic tail. To simplify the interpretation of the results, all products of translation from the various constructs were subjected to immunoisolation with an antibody that only recognizes the amino-terminal signal sequence-cleaved forms of the protein (16Spurway T.D. Dalley J.A. High S. Bulleid N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15975-15982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Is the Signal for GPI Anchor Addition Accessible to the Glycosylation Machinery?—Our initial approach to address the question of whether the signal for GPI anchor addition is fully translocated into the lumen of the ER was to determine whether a glycosylation site positioned four amino acids from the cleavage site could be accessible to the glycosylation machinery. The glycosylation sequon would only be glycosylated if it is accessible to the oligosaccharyltransferase and therefore in the lumen of the ER. When prepromini-PLAP was translated in the presence of SP cells and the products were immunoisolated, two major translation products were identified with relative molecular masses of 29 and 25 kDa (Fig. 3A, lane 1). It has previously been demonstrated that these products represent promini-PLAP and GPI-anchored mini-PLAP, respectively (22Kodukula K. Micanovic R. Gerber L. Tamburrini M. Brink L. Udenfriend S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4464-4470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Translation of the glycosylation variant prepromini-PLAP-G1 in the presence of SP cells yielded three major immunoprecipitated products with relative molecular masses of 33, 29, and 25 kDa (Fig. 3A, lane 2). The 33-kDa product was sensitive to digestion with endoglycosidase H (Fig. 3A, lane 3) demonstrating that this glycosylation site was accessible to the oligosaccharyltransferase and that this product is glycosylated promini-PLAP-G1. To further identify the products of translation of prepromini-PLAP-G1, we carried out translations in the presence of hydrazine (Fig. 3B). Hydrazine can act as an alternative nucleophile during the transamidation reaction resulting in the formation of a hydrazide product, which has a greater electrophoretic mobility than the GPI-anchored form (9Maxwell S.E. Ramalingam S. Gerber L.D. Brink L. Udenfriend S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19576-19582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This difference in mobility is clearly demonstrated when prepromini-PLAP was translated in the presence of SP cells and hydrazine (Fig. 3B, lane 2). The 25-kDa GPI-anchored mini-PLAP now migrated with a relative molecular mass of 23 kDa. When prepromini-PLAP-G1 was translated in the presence of SP cells and hydrazine an additional immunoprecipitated product with relative molecular mass of 27 kDa was formed (Fig. 3B, lane 4). This result demonstrates that the 29-kDa product synthesized in the absence of hydrazine contains both unglycosylated promini-PLAP and glycosylated mini-PLAP. The fact that the G1 glycosylation site is utilized and that the glycosylated product can be GPI-anchored demonstrates that the addition of an oligosaccharide side chain close to the cleavage site does not inhibit the transamidase or that the glycosylation site is still accessible to the transferase following GPI anchor addition. As we cannot distinguish between these two possibilities it is not clear from these results alone whether the polypeptide chain is fully translocated and glycosylated prior to GPI anchor addition. To further address whether the signal sequence for GPI anchor addition is translocated prior to GPI anchor addition a glycosylation site was introduced into the hydrophobic region of the signal sequence. When prepromini-PLAP-G2 was translated in the presence of SP cells and the products of translation were immunoisolated, three major products were visualized with relative molecular masses of 33, 29, and 25 kDa (Fig. 3C, lane 1). The 29- and 25-kDa products co-migrated with the promini-PLAP and mini-PLAP (Fig. 3A, lane 1), whereas the 33-kDa product was sensitive to digestion with endoglycosidase H (Fig. 3C, lane 2). The fact that translation of promini-PLAP-G2 yielded both GPI-anchored mini-PLAP and glycosylated promini-PLAP demonstrates that addition of the glycosylation site within the hydrophobic domain does not prevent GPI anchor addition and that the hydrophobic region is accessible to the oligosaccharyltransferase. These results strongly suggest that the signal for GPI anchor addition can be fully translocated into the lumen of the ER. Can the Translocon Distinguish between a GPI Anchor and a Transmembrane Domain?—The main determinant for integration of a polypeptide chain into a lipid bilayer is the presence of a stop transfer sequence, a region of 20-30 relatively hydrophobic amino acids followed by charged residues (18High S. Dobberstein B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal signal for GPI anchor addition contains some of the characteristics of a stop transfer sequence in that it contains ∼20 hydrophobic residues. However, as it is located at the end of the protein it contains no carboxyl-terminal flanking charged residues. For mini-PLAP the carboxyl-terminal signal is strongly predicted to behave as a transmembrane domain based upon hydrophobicity (predictions carried out using software such as TMbase (25Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 166Google Scholar)), therefore flanking the carboxyl-terminal end with charged residues could potentially convert the signal to a stop transfer sequence with the consequence of integrating the polypeptide chain into the lipid bilayer. To ascertain whether the translocon could recognize a GPI anchor signal as an authentic stop transfer sequence, we added the amino acids-RRKS to the carboxyl-terminal end of the hydrophobic signal. The resulting construct termed mini-membrane was translated in the presence of SP cells in the absence and presence of hydrazine to determine whether the modified GPI signal was still a substrate for the transamidase. The main product of translation for mini-membrane migrated with a slightly slower mobility than promini-PLAP (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 1 and 3). This product is “promini-membrane” since these translation products have been immunoisolated with an antibody recognizing the amino-terminal signal sequence-cleaved translation products. In the presence of hydrazine an additional product was observed that had an identical mobility to the hydrazide product formed when mini-PLAP was translated in the presence of hydrazine (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 2 and 4). Although this is a minor product it was reproducibly seen when mini-membrane was translated in the presence of hydrazine. This demonstrates that the transamidase can potentially recognize and cleave mini-membrane suggesting that at least some of the translation product was fully translocated into the ER lumen despite the presence of charged residues flanking the hydrophobic GPI anchor signal sequence. The low level of transamidase activity could be a result of a low level of full translocation or due to the charged residues affecting the ability of the transamidase to recognize and cleave the GPI anchor signal sequence. To further investigate whether mini-membrane had been fully translocated rather than integrated into the lipid bilayer we modified the hydrophobic signal to include a glycosylation site (as we did for the G2 construct) to generate mini-membrane-G2. When this construct was translated in the presence of SP cells an additional product with a slower mobility than promini-membrane was observed (Fig. 4B, lane 2). This product was sensitive to digestion with endoglycosidase H verifying that it represents glycosylated promini-membrane (Fig. 4B, lane 3). It is unlikely that translocation was due to cleavage of the additional charged amino acids as no product co-migrating with promini-PLAP can be seen after translation of mini-membrane-G2 (Fig. 4B, lane 2) even after deglycosylation (lane 3). That only a proportion of the mini-membrane-G2 translation product was glycosylated is not surprising as glycosylation sites close to the carboxyl terminus are poorly recognized by the oligosaccharyltransferase (26Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17338-17343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The fact that the G2 site was recognized at all does demonstrates that the GPI signal was accessible to the oligosaccharyltransferase suggesting that the polypeptide chain was fully translocated into the ER lumen. The results obtained with mini-membrane could be explained if the short stretch of amino acids added were not sufficient to convert the GPI signal into a stop transfer signal. We therefore made a further construct where we added the 29-amino acid cytosolic tail from VSVG protein to the carboxyl-terminal end of the polypeptide chain (Fig. 2) either with the authentic GPI signal (signal VSVG) or with the GPI signal containing a potential glycosylation site (signal VSVG-G). When the signal VSVG-G construct was translated in the presence of SP cells a translation product was synthesized that had a slower mobility than the signal VSVG translation product (Fig. 5A, compare lanes 3 and 5). This translation product was sensitive to digestion with endoglycosidase H (Fig. 5B, lane 2) verifying that the glycosylation site within the GPI signal was utilized. Additionally when translated in the presence of hydrazine both the signal VSVG and the signal VSVG-G were converted to the mini-PLAP hydrazide albeit rather inefficiently (Fig. 5A, lanes 4 and 6). Again these results suggest that both these constructs are translocated into the ER lumen where they are accessible to both the glycosylation machinery and the transamidase. Therefore, the presence of the VSVG cytosolic tail does not seem to convert the GPI signal into a stop transfer sequence and prevent translocation. As the levels of glycosylation and transamidase activity were low our results might be explained by the SP cells allowing a minor level of translocation even of authentic transmembrane proteins. To investigate this point we made a construct where we replaced the hydrophobic region of the GPI signal with the stop transfer sequence from VSVG (called TM-VSVG) and a construct that contains a potential glycosylation site within the hydrophobic region (termed TM-VSVG-G) (Fig. 2). We then ascertained whether the hydrophobic region within TM-VSVG was at any stage accessible to the transamidase or the glycosylation machinery. When TM-VSVG-G was translated in the presence of SP cells a single translation product was observed that was not sensitive to digestion with endoglycosidase H (Fig. 6A, lanes 1 and 2). Additionally no hydrazide product was seen when TM-VSVG-G or TM-VSVG was translated in the presence of hydrazine (Fig. 6A, lanes 4 and 6). To demonstrate that the hydrophobic domain from the VSVG stop anchor sequence could be recognized by the transamidase we prepared a construct that was identical to TM-VSVG but without the VSVG cytosolic tail (TM minus tail). Translation of TM minus tail in the presence of SP cells resulted in the appearance of a single translation product (Fig. 6B, lane 1). When hydrazine was included in the translation an additional product was seen (Fig. 6B, lane 2). Hence the TM minus tail was recognized by the transamidase and cleaved to form a hydrazide product. Taken together these results demonstrate that the low efficiency of glycosylation and transamidase activity cannot be simply explained by a low level of translocation as no glycosylation or transamidase processing of TM-VSVG or TM-VSVG-G occurred. To demonstrate directly that the signal for GPI anchor addition is translocated fully and efficiently across the ER membrane we carried out a protease protection experiment. The products of translation from signal VSVG and signal VSVG-G synthesized in the presence of SP cells were subjected to digestion with proteinase K either in the presence or absence of Triton X-100. For both constructs the translation products were protected from proteolysis in the absence of added detergent but were degraded after the membranes were solubilized (Fig. 7A, lanes 2, 3, 5, and 6). This result demonstrates that the translation products were completely sequestered within the lumen of the ER with no region of the translation product being accessible to the protease. If the modified GPI signal behaved as a stop transfer sequence then the integration of the polypeptide chain into the lipid bilayer would result in the cytosolic tail being exposed to and cleaved by the protease. To demonstrate this effect we translated TM-VSVG in the presence of SP cells. A single translation product was observed (Fig. 7A, lane 7) that was sensitive to proteolysis after treatment with proteinase K (Fig. 7A, lane 8). The appearance of a slightly faster migrating translation product indicates that the polypeptide chain was integrated into the lipid bilayer but that the cytosolic tail was still accessible to and degraded by the protease. The translation products were degraded completely when the SP cells were solubilized with detergent prior to proteolysis (Fig. 7A, lane 9). Taken together these results prove that the hydrophobic region from the GPI signal cannot act as a stop transfer sequence even when an authentic cytosolic tail is added to the carboxyl terminus. Both the glycosylated and the unglycosylated form of signal VSVG-G was protected from proteolysis showing that the low level of glycosylation is not due to a lack of translocation (Fig. 7A, lanes 4 and 5). These data suggest that the hydrophobic domain from the GPI anchor signal sequence contains some characteristic that prevents normal recognition by the translocon to allow integration into the ER membrane. The sequence (VVPALLPL-LAGTLLLLETATAP) contains one charged residue and two internal proline residues that could influence either overall hydrophobicity or helical content. To determine whether these residues have an influence over the ability of this sequence to act as a transmembrane domain we initially changed the charged residue (Glu) to a hydrophobic residue (Leu) to created signal VSVG-E/L. When this construct was translated in the presence of SP cells a single translation product was observed (Fig. 7B, lane 1) that was sensitive to proteolysis after treatment with proteinase K (Fig. 7B, lane 2). The appearance of a slightly faster migrating translation product indicates that the polypeptide chain was integrated into the lipid bilayer. The translation products were degraded completely when the SP cells were solubilized with detergent prior to proteolysis (Fig. 7B, lane 3). We also introduced this mutation into the signal VSVG-G construct (signal VSVG-G-E/L) and found that when this construct was translated in the presence of SP cells the synthesized polypeptide was refractory to glycosylation (Fig. 7C, lanes 3 and 4). Additionally no hydrazide product was seen when signal VSVG-E/L was translated in the presence of hydrazine (Fig. 7D, lane 3). These results clearly demonstrate that a single amino acid change converts the GPI anchor signal sequence into a transmembrane domain. The initial stage in the attachment of a GPI anchor to the carboxyl-terminal end of a polypeptide chain involves recognition of the GPI anchor signal sequence by the transamidase complex. The results presented here demonstrate conclusively that this recognition event occurs following full translocation of the chain across the ER membrane. The consequence of this observation is that the process of protein translocation and GPI anchor addition are segregated and that the hydrophobic GPI anchor signal sequence will be transiently exposed to the lumen of the ER. However, it is highly likely that protein translocation and GPI anchor addition are tightly coordinated in a similar fashion to N-linked glycosylation (27Whitley P. Nilsson I.M. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6241-6244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Following translocation the hydrophobic GPI anchor signal sequence would need to be rapidly recognized by the transamidase as any prolonged exposure to the aqueous environment may lead to nonspecific association or sequestration away from the protein surface. Hence it would seem reasonable to suggest that the transamidase, like the oligosaccharyltransferase, is associated with the translocon ready to recognize and interact with newly translocated proteins. The transamidase itself is a multisubunit complex with a clearly defined function for only one of the five subunits (17Meyer U. Benghezal M. Imhof I. Conzelmann A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3461-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). One function of the complex could be to interact with a ribosome-associated translocon to allow rapid and efficient recognition and processing of GPI anchor signal sequences. The results presented here also clearly demonstrate that the hydrophobic region within the GPI signal cannot act as a transmembrane domain even when followed by an authentic cytosolic domain. This would suggest that there is some characteristic of the hydrophobic domain from a GPI anchor signal sequence that allows the ribosome or translocon to distinguish it from a transmembrane domain. Recognition of transmembrane domains is thought to occur very soon after synthesis potentially by the ribosome itself (28Liao S. Lin J. Do H. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). One model suggests that there are two stages of recognition. The first stage is an initial interaction with the ribosome that triggers a conformational change within the translocon facilitating recruitment of immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein to the luminal face thereby sealing the pore (Fig. 8). The seal prevents further translocation allowing synthesis of the cytosolic domain. The next stage is an interaction of the transmembrane domain with components of the translocon (Sec61α and translocating chain-associated membrane protein) that facilitates lateral integration of this domain into the lipid bilayer. During the final stage, the transmembrane domain can interact with both protein and lipid components of the translocon (19Martoglio B. Hofmann M.W. Brunner J. Dobberstein B. Cell. 1995; 81: 207-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 29McCormick P. Miao Y. Shao Y. Lin J. Johnson A.E. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 329-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The physical characteristics of the transmembrane domain that facilitate either protein-protein or protein-lipid interaction are unclear but presumably involve a combination of hydrophobicity and helical content. Hence the GPI anchor signal sequence must either be insufficiently hydrophobic or not sufficiently α-helical to be recognized as a potential transmembrane domain by components of the ribosome-translocon complex. The ability to distinguish between a transmembrane domain and the GPI signal is unlikely to be due to overall hydrophobicity as algorithms designed to detect transmembrane domains predict that the hydrophobic region of a GPI signal should potentially act as a transmembrane domain (25Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 166Google Scholar). Also some transmembrane domains are quite hydrophilic (30Wilkinson B.M. Critchley A.J. Stirling C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25590-25597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) suggesting that hydrophobicity is important but not the only requirement for membrane integration. Inspection of the GPI anchor sequence reveals the presence of a single charged residue and two internal proline residues within the sequence that could influence conformation. Recent work has demonstrated that a disproportionate number of proline residues are found in transmembrane domains (31Wigley W.C. Corboy M.J. Cutler T.D. Thibodeau P.H. Oldan J. Lee M.G. Rizo J. Hunt J.F. Thomas P.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 381-388PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of proline actually increases the α-helical content by thermodynamically disfavoring the formation of β-sheet conformations within detergent micelles. Hence the presence of proline does not preclude the possibility that this domain can adopt an α-helical conformation. Exchanging single charged residues within GPI anchor signal sequences can, however, render the sequence able to act as a transmembrane domain (20Delahunty M.D. Stafford F.J. Yuan L.C. Shaz D. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12017-12027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that the presence of proline did not prevent membrane integration; rather the presence of the charged residue was responsible for the lack of recognition of this domain by the translocon. Whether the single amino acid change results in a significant change of conformation or a change in helical surface leading to a change in recognition by the translocon is not clear and will be the subject of future work. It would appear that subtle differences in the hydrophobic region of GPI anchor signal sequences prevent the recognition of the region by the ribosome or translocon and allow full translocation across the ER membrane. Hence an essential feature of a GPI signal is that it contains not just a hydrophobic domain but a hydrophobic domain that has some characteristic, such as the positioning of charged residues, that prevents recognition as a potential transmembrane domain. Conversely overall hydrophobicity cannot guarantee that a sequence will behave as a transmembrane domain; a positive recognition by the ribosome or translocon must occur to ensure the pathway of membrane integration rather than full translocation occurs. We thank Professor Stephen High for many fruitful discussions during the course of this work and Dr. Martin Poole for critical reading of the manuscript."

It is well known that the major factor ensuring “correct” gene expression in bacteria is the efficiency with which RNAP recognizes the promoters of different genes. Although the principal determinants for promoter recognition reside in the RNAP σ subunit, at many promoters, the α subunits also play a key role (1Gross C. Chan C. Dombroski A. Gruber T. Sharp M.

Each RNAP α subunit consists of two independently folding domains connected by a flexible linker. The N-terminal domain (αNTD; residues 8-235 in Escherichia coli α) carries determinants for the interaction of the α subunits with the rest of RNAP, whereas the C-terminal domain (αCTD; residues 249-329 in E. coli α) carries determinants for interaction with promoter DNA elements and with certain transcription factors (4Blatter E.E.

At some promoters, the interaction of αCTD with specific DNA sequence elements (known as UP elements) is essential for optimal transcription initiation.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 491-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 10Yasuno Y. Yamazaki T. Tanaka Y. Kodama T. Matsugami A. Katahira M. Ishihama A. Kyogoku T. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 213-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Genetic analyses, together with the structural studies, have identified residues in two helix-loop-helix motifs that are responsible for DNA binding. Thus, Arg265, Asn268, Gly296, Lys298, and Ser299 appear to be the crucial α subunit residues that make contact with the DNA minor groove (reviewed in Ref. 3Gourse R.L. Ross W. Gaal T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar and see Ref. 8Benoff B. Yang H. Lawson C.L. Parkinson G. Liu J. Blatter E. Ebright Y.W. Berman H.M. Ebright R.H. Science. 2002; 297: 1562-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). These residues are part of a small segment of the surface of αCTD known as the 265 determinant. The linker joining αNTD and αCTD contains at least 13 amino acids and appears to be very flexible and unstructured (11Jeon Y.H. Yamazaki T. Otomo T. Ishihama A. Kyogoku Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 953-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A consequence of this is that αCTD can bind at different locations at different promoters. At promoters where RNAP initiates transcription without the need for an activator protein, one αCTD contacts the DNA minor groove near position -41, upstream of the promoter -35 element (3Gourse R.L. Ross W. Gaal T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 12Naryshkin N. Revyakin A. Kim Y. Mekler V. Ebright R.H. Cell. 2000; 101: 601-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In some cases, a distinct segment of the surface of this αCTD, known as the 261 determinant (including α residue Glu261), has been shown to contact domain 4 of the RNAP σ subunit, which docks with the promoter -35 element (13Chen H. Tang H. Ebright R.H. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1621-1633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 14Ross W. Schneider D.A. Paul B.J. Mertens A. Gourse R.L. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1293-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). At activator-independent promoters, the second αCTD may contact UP element DNA or may be free to contact upstream sequences at different locations (3Gourse R.L. Ross W. Gaal T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 12Naryshkin N. Revyakin A. Kim Y. Mekler V. Ebright R.H. Cell. 2000; 101: 601-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). At activator-dependent promoters, the location of αCTD is dependent on the organization of the DNA site(s) for the activator, and there are great variations in the positioning of αCTD at different promoters (15Rhodius V. Busby S. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 152-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). For any activator-dependent promoter, a key challenge is to understand how the different determinants of bound αCTD are oriented with respect to the rest of RNAP and other bound proteins. The role of αCTD has been most intensively studied at E. coli promoters that are dependent on the cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP; also known as catabolite activator protein). When triggered by cyclic AMP, CRP binds to target sequences at dozens of different promoters and activates transcription by recruiting RNAP to these promoters (reviewed in Ref. 16Kolb A. Busby S. Buc H. Garges S. Adhya S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 749-795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CRP is a homodimer that binds to 22-bp sequences at target promoters. Simple CRP-dependent promoters (i.e. promoters that are dependent on binding of a single CRP dimer) fall into two classes (reviewed in Ref. 17Busby S. Ebright R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). At class I promoters, CRP binds upstream of the RNAP binding determinants (usually centered near position -61, -71, or -81), and the downstream subunit of the CRP dimer makes a direct interaction with αCTD to recruit it, and thereby the rest of RNAP, to the promoter. At class II promoters, CRP binds to a site centered near position -41 and overlaps the promoter -35 region. The upstream subunit of the CRP dimer makes a direct interaction with αCTD that recruits it to the DNA segment immediately upstream of bound CRP. Although two αCTDs of RNAP could potentially interact with the two subunits of the CRP dimer, a single CRP-αCTD interaction suffices for CRP-dependent transcription activation at both classes of CRP-dependent promoter (18Lloyd G.S. Niu W. Tebbutt J. Ebright R.H. Busby S.J.W. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2557-2565Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The same surface of CRP interacts with αCTD at both class I and class II promoters (17Busby S. Ebright R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). This has been identified as a surface-exposed loop adjacent to the helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif (activating region 1, AR1; residues 156-164). Analysis of the high resolution crystal structure of a CRP·αCTD·DNA ternary complex shows that AR1 contacts a segment of the surface of αCTD that is located on the opposite face from the 261 determinant (8Benoff B. Yang H. Lawson C.L. Parkinson G. Liu J. Blatter E. Ebright Y.W. Berman H.M. Ebright R.H. Science. 2002; 297: 1562-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). This surface, known as the 287 determinant, includes residues 285-289 that had been identified in previous genetic analyses as being the most likely residues in αCTD to make direct contact with CRP (19Savery N.J. Lloyd G.S. Kainz M. Gaal T. Ross W. Ebright R.H. Gourse R.L. Busby S.J.W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3439-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 20Savery N.J. Lloyd G.S. Busby S.J.W. Thomas M.S. Ebright R.H. Gourse R.L. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2273-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The high resolution crystal structure of a CRP·αCTD·DNA ternary complex, together with genetic and footprint analyses, provides a framework for understanding the arrangement of CRP and RNAP subunits during open complex formation at any CRP-dependent promoter. Notwithstanding this, there is a need for direct methods to find the location and, more importantly, the orientation of the two RNAP αCTDs at different promoters with different organizations. A novel approach to this problem was taken by Murakami et al. (21Murakami K. Kimura M. Owens J.T. Meares C.F. Ishihama A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1709-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 22Murakami K. Owens J.T. Belyaeva T.A. Meares C.F. Busby S.J.W. Ishihama A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11274-11278Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) who exploited the DNA cleavage reagent, iron [S]-1-[p-bromoacetamidobenzyl]ethylenediaminetetraacetate (FeBABE). RNAP was reconstituted with purified α subunits that had been covalently modified with FeBABE, open complexes were formed at different promoters, and the DNA cleaving ability of FeBABE was triggered. In these experiments, the FeBABE reagent was tethered to Cys269, immediately adjacent to the DNA binding 265 determinant, and thus the positions of DNA cleavage at the target promoter reveal the locations of αCTD binding. In this study, we have extended this analysis by attaching the FeBABE reagent either to position 273 or to position 302 of the RNAP α subunit; these positions are located on opposite faces of αCTD (Fig. 1). Our aim was to chose two well separated positions that were removed from the DNA binding surface of αCTD, in order to investigate not only the location of the two RNAP αCTDs but also their orientation when bound at different CRP-dependent promoters. Thus, we present data for complexes at simple class I and class II CRP-dependent promoters, as well as at a CRP-independent derivative.

This plasmid carries the rpoA sequence with cysteine codons at positions 54, 131, 176, and 269. Thus, using PCR, these were changed to alanine codons, prior to the insertion of single cysteine codons at desired locations. For the PCR, mutagenic oligos were used together with flanking oligos, and the resulting PCR fragments were cloned into pHTT7f1NHα vector DNA, cut with the appropriate restriction enzymes. Oligos D25330 and D25335 were first used to replace codon Cys176, with the resulting PCR fragment being cloned into pHTT7f1NHα using EcoRI and HindIII sites. Next, oligos D25331 and D25332 were used to replace codon Cys131 with the resulting PCR fragment being cloned into pHTT7f1NHα Ala176 using PmlI and EcoRI sites. In the next step, megaprimer PCR was used to remove codon Cys54. The megaprimer fragment was generated using oligos D25333 and D25387, and then the megaprimer and oligo D25334 were used to add codon Ala54. The resulting PCR product containing Ala54 was cloned into the pHTT7f1NHα Ala131 Ala176 plasmid using XbaI and PmlI sites. Finally, a derivative of pHTT7f1NHα, encoding rpoA with no cysteine codons, was made by cloning a DNA fragment from plasmid pHTf1α carrying an Ala269 codon (27Tang H. Severinov K. Goldfarb A. Fenyo D. Chait B. Ebright R.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 3058-3067Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) using oligos D10885 and D21316 and HindIII and BamHI sites. This derivative was then used as the template for the construction of mutants carrying single cysteine codons at positions 273 or 302 in the rpoA gene, using megaprimer PCR. Mutagenic oligos D25817 or D26543, respectively, were used together with oligo D10885 to generate the megaprimer fragments, and then the megaprimers and oligos D21316 were used to add the single cysteine codons. Resulting PCR fragments were cloned into pHTT7f1NHα Ala54-Ala131-Ala176-Ala269 by using HindIII and BamHI sites. The sequences of all plasmids were checked using automated sequencing with the sequencing primers, D25612 and D25613 (University of Birmingham Genomics Facility). Purification of α Mutants—Strain BL21 DE3 carrying pHTT7f1NHα derivatives was used to overexpress His-tagged α protein with single cysteines at position 273 or position 302. 500-ml cultures in Lennox broth containing ampicillin (200 μg/ml) were grown at 37 °C to an A650 of ∼0.6-0.8, induced by the addition of 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (and an additional 200 μg/ml ampicillin), and grown for a further 3 h. Cells were then harvested and resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol). Following sonication, the lysate was cleared by centrifugation and subjected to Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose affinity chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). The column was pre-equilibrated in lysis buffer, and the bound α subunits were eluted with a gradient of 0-200 mm imidazole. Fractions containing α were pooled, concentrated, and exchanged into buffer for conjugation with FeBABE (10 mm MOPS, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol) using spin columns (Vivascience). Conjugation of α Derivatives with FeBABE—FeBABE was purchased from NBS Biologicals Ltd., dissolved in Me2SO, and stored at -70 °C. Conjugation with FeBABE was initiated by mixing 100 μm α (final concentration) in 700 μl of conjugation buffer with 1 mm FeBABE (final concentration). Following incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, samples were quenched by the addition of 700 μl of lysis buffer and concentrated using spin columns (Vivascience). The efficiency of conjugation was determined by quantifying free sulfhydryl groups on both conjugated and unconjugated protein with the fluorescent reagent, 7-diethylamino-3-(4′maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin, as described by Greiner et al. (30Greiner D.P. Miyake R. Moran J.K. Jones A.D. Negishi T. Ishihama A. Meares C.F. Bioconjugate Chem. 1997; 8: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The ability of the conjugated α subunits (compared with wild type α and unconjugated single cysteine α protein) to bind to DNA was confirmed using electromobility shift assays at the α(-63)CC(-41.5) promoter, as in Savery et al. (19Savery N.J. Lloyd G.S. Kainz M. Gaal T. Ross W. Ebright R.H. Gourse R.L. Busby S.J.W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3439-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Samples were stored at -20 °C after the addition of 50% (v/v) glycerol. Reconstitution of RNAP Derivatives—Preparation of inclusion bodies containing β, β′, or σ70 subunits from strains XL1-Blue [pLHN12β], BL21 DE3 [pT7β′], and BL21 DE3 [pMKSe2], respectively, and reconstitution of RNAP using these inclusion bodies was performed as described in Tang et al. (26Tang H. Severinov K. Goldfarb A. Ebright R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4902-4906Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The reconstituted holoenzyme was then purified based on the methods of Tang et al. (26Tang H. Severinov K. Goldfarb A. Ebright R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4902-4906Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and Igarashi and Ishihama (31Igarashi K. Ishihama A. Cell. 1991; 65: 1015-1022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reconstituted holoenzyme was diluted 2.5-fold with dilution buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.9, 100 μm EDTA, 5% (v/v) glycerol) and subjected to DEAE-Sepharose chromatography and Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose affinity chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). The DEAE-Sepharose column was pre-equilibrated with DEAE buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol), and the bound holoenzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of 100-700 mm NaCl in DEAE buffer. Pooled fractions were then applied to a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose affinity column. The column was pre-equilibrated with storage buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.9, 200 mm NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol), and the holoenzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of 0-250 mm imidazole in storage buffer. Fractions containing holoenzyme were pooled, and buffer was exchanged into storage buffer and concentrated using spin columns (Vivascience). Samples were stored at -20 °C after the addition of 50% (v/v) glycerol. In Vitro Transcription Experiments—To show that reconstituted RNAP derivatives were transcriptionally active, transcription assays were carried out according to Savery et al. (19Savery N.J. Lloyd G.S. Kainz M. Gaal T. Ross W. Ebright R.H. Gourse R.L. Busby S.J.W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3439-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Reactions were initiated by the addition of the RNAP derivative and were terminated after 15 min at 30 °C by the addition of 25 μl of stop solution (7 m urea, 1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol). Products were analyzed on 6% acrylamide gels containing 7 m urea. Gels were processed and then scanned using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). DNA Cleavage by FeBABE—DNA templates for footprinting were obtained using cesium chloride preparations of plasmids carrying the desired promoters cloned in pSR. AatII-HindIII fragments were purified and labeled at the HindIII end with either [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (for the template strand) or [α-32P]ATP and E. coli DNA polymerase Klenow fragment (for the non-template strand). RNAP holoenzyme was mixed with promoter DNA in a reaction volume of 35 μl (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 50 mm potassium glutamate, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. After 10 min, complexes were treated with heparin (50 μg/ml final concentration) for 1 min at 37 °C. DNA cleavage was then initiated by the addition of 3 mm sodium ascorbate and 3 mm hydrogen peroxide. Samples were incubated for at least 2 min at 37 °C before cleavage was stopped by the addition of EDTA and thiourea to final concentrations of 45 and 7 mm, respectively. Modified DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol and then analyzed on a 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 6 m urea. Gels were calibrated with Maxam-Gilbert G + A sequence ladders. Gels were processed and then scanned using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Construction of RNA Polymerase Conjugated with FeBABE—Models of αCTD bound to DNA are shown in Fig. 1. Contact with the minor groove of the DNA target is due to residues of the 265 determinant (pink), and the 261 determinant (yellow) and 287 determinant (green) are displayed on opposite faces of αCTD so that they could interact with neighboring proteins bound to adjacent sites on the DNA. The aim of our work was to devise a method to allow experimental determination of the orientation of binding of RNAP αCTD in transcriptionally competent complexes at any promoter. Thus, for any case, we could investigate whether the 287 determinant was pointing upstream or downstream (and vice versa for the 261 determinant). To do this, we exploited the DNA-cleaving agent, FeBABE, which can be tethered to specific residues in the RNAP α subunit by engineering derivatives carrying single cysteine residues. Starting with plasmid pHTT7f1NHα, a T7 vector for overexpression of RNAP α carrying a hexahistidine tag, a derivative was first engineered that encoded cysteine-free α, in which all the naturally occurring cysteine residues were replaced with alanine residues. By using this construct, further derivatives, pHTT7f1NHα 273C and pHTT7f1NHα 302C, encoding α with single cysteines, either at position 273 or position 302, were then constructed by replacing the glutamic acid residues at positions 273 or 302 with cysteines. These two positions in αCTD were chosen because they are located on opposite surfaces of αCTD (Fig. 1) and because alanine substitution at these locations is known to have little or no detrimental effect (19Savery N.J. Lloyd G.S. Kainz M. Gaal T. Ross W. Ebright R.H. Gourse R.L. Busby S.J.W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3439-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 20Savery N.J. Lloyd G.S. Busby S.J.W. Thomas M.S.

Microbiol. 2000; 37: 1032-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Plasmids pHTT7f1NHα 273C and pHTT7f1NHα 302C were used to overexpress the single cysteine α derivatives, and the overexpressed proteins were purified and conjugated with FeBABE reagent. Titrations with the fluorescent reagent, 7-diethylamino-3-(4′maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin, showed that the conjugation efficiency was 50-70% with Cys273α and 70-85% with Cys302α. In preparatory experiments, we used electromobility shift assays to check the binding of conjugated and non-conjugated α protein to DNA fragments containing an UP element and to DNA fragments to which CRP was already bound (details of the assays are shown in Ref. 19Savery N.J. Lloyd G.S. Kainz M. Gaal T. Ross W. Ebright R.H. Gourse R.L. Busby S.J.W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3439-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The assays showed that the interactions of α with DNA and with CRP are unaffected by conjugation with FeBABE (data not shown). The FeBABE-labeled α subunits were then combined with the RNAP β and β′ subunits to make core RNAP, before being mixed with σ to form holoenzyme. The ability of the preparations of RNAP, reconstituted with FeBABE-labeled Cys273 or Cys302 α subunits, to initiate transcription was confirmed by multiround in vitro transcription assays at the lacUV5 promoter. Results illustrated in Fig. 2 show that the preparations of RNAP labeled with FeBABE are transcriptionally active, although we cannot be certain that they are fully active compared with the starting RNAP. This uncertainty is principally due to variations in reconstitution efficiencies and in the specific activity of the reconstituted RNAP preparations. However, the clarity of the FeBABE cleavage patterns, discussed below, argues that any variations in transcriptional activities between different preparations are unlikely to affect substantially our conclusions. Binding of αCTD at a Class II Promoter Activated by CRP— The different promoters that we have investigated are illustrated in Fig. 3. The first promoter that we studied is a simple class II CRP-dependent promoter, CC(-41.5), that carries a consensus DNA site for CRP centered at position -41.5. This promoter was chosen because previous footprinting studies had clearly shown that both αCTDs bind upstream of bound CRP (33Belyaeva T. Bown J. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Busby S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2242-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). One αCTD protects the DNA minor groove near position -60, and its 287 determinant interacts with AR1 of CRP (19Savery N.J. Lloyd G.S. Kainz M. Gaal T. Ross W. Ebright R.H. Gourse R.L. Busby S.J.W.

https://openalex.org/W2020757790,"Rpb4, the fourth largest subunit of RNA polymerase II in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is required for many phenotypes, including growth at high and low temperatures, sporulation, pseudohyphal growth, activated transcription of a subset of genes, and efficient carbon and energy metabolism. We have used deletion analysis to delineate the domains of the protein involved in these multiple phenotypes. The scRpb4 protein is conserved at the N and C termini but possesses certain non-conserved regions in the central portion. Our deletion analysis and molecular modeling results show that the N- and C-terminal conserved regions of Rpb4 are involved in interaction with Rpb7, the Rpb4 interacting partner in the RNA polymerase II. We further show that the conserved N terminus is required for efficient activated transcription from the INO1 promoter but not the GAL10- or the HSE-containing promoters. The N terminus is not required for any of the stress responses tested: growth at high temperatures, sporulation, and pseudohyphal growth. The conserved C-terminal 23 amino acids are not required for the role of Rpb4 in the pseudohyphal growth phenotype but might play a role in other stress responses and activated transcription. From the deletion analysis of the non-conserved regions, we report that they influence phenotypes involving both the N and C termini (interaction with Rpb7 and transcription from the INO1 promoter) but not any of the stress-responsive phenotypes tested suggesting that they might be involved in maintaining the two conserved domains in an appropriate conformation for interaction with Rpb7 and other proteins. Taken together, our results allow us to assign phenotype-specific roles for the different conserved and non-conserved regions of Rpb4."
https://openalex.org/W2008526600,"To identify new genes that retinoic acid activates, we employed an mRNA differential display technique and screened for genes that are differentially expressed in promyeloleukemic HL-60 cells incubated in the presence of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) compared with the absence of ATRA. We cloned the coding region of a retinoic acid-induced gene from a human thymus library, which was the mRNA encoding the 666-amino acid human homologue of mouse proline-rich protein 76. We have designated it RARP1 (retinoic acid response proline-rich protein 1). Transcription of an ∼2.4-kbp mRNA occurred mainly in organs with immune functions, such as thymus, spleen, and peripheral leukocytes. Cycloheximide blocked the ATRA-induced expression. In megakaryocyte-like human erythroleukemia HEL cells, the amount of RARP1 mRNA was high, but it was low in human T-lymphoblastoid Jurkat cells. A specific antibody against RARP1 recognized a 110-kDa protein, which accumulates after incubation of HL-60 cells with ATRA. In immunohistochemical experiments, strong RARP1 staining was observed in the megakaryocytes of bone marrow and spleen, and heterogeneous stain was seen in thymus. Transcriptional studies showed that RARP1 expression impaired the transactivation through activator protein1 and serum responseelement in all cell lines we checked, whereas it did not affect the transactivation through cAMP-response element in the same cell lines. Further analysis demonstrated that proline-rich regions of RARP1 are the functional regions regulated for suppression of activator protein1 transactivation. These data suggest that ATRA-inducible RARP1 selectively affects signal transduction and may contribute to myeloid and megakaryocytic differentiation. To identify new genes that retinoic acid activates, we employed an mRNA differential display technique and screened for genes that are differentially expressed in promyeloleukemic HL-60 cells incubated in the presence of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) compared with the absence of ATRA. We cloned the coding region of a retinoic acid-induced gene from a human thymus library, which was the mRNA encoding the 666-amino acid human homologue of mouse proline-rich protein 76.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 605: 33-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). In the hematopoietic system, Breitman et al. (2Breitman T.R. Selonick S.E. Collins S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2936-2940Crossref PubMed Scopus (1858) Google Scholar) first reported the action of ATRA to promote HL-60 cell differentiation in vivo. The specific action has led to widespread use of ATRA to promote induction of neutrophilic differentiation of leukemic cells as a selective means of chemotherapy for fresh acute promyeloleukemic cells (3Huang M.E. Ye Y.C. Chen S.R. Chai J.R. Lu J.X. Zhoa L. Gu L.J. Wang Z.Y. Blood. 1988; 72: 567-572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Retinoic acid receptors and retinoic X-receptors are two distinct families of nuclear receptors that belong to the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor family (4Pfahl M. Apfel R. Bendik I. Fanjul A. Graupner G. Lee M.O. La-Vista N. Lu X.P. Piedrafita J. Ortiz M.A. Vitam. Horm. 1994; 49: 327-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). ATRA binds with retinoic acid receptors, and another retinoid, 9-cis-retinoic acid, binds with retinoic X-receptors (5Levin A.A. Sturzenbecker J.L. Kazmer S. Bosakowski T. Huselton C. Allenby G. Speck J. Kratzeisen C. Rosenberger M. Lovery A. Grippo J.F. Nature. 1992; 255: 359-361Crossref Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). DNA array, suppression-subtractive hybridization, and differential display-PCR analyses demonstrated that some genes are up- and down-regulated directly or indirectly by the treatment with ATRA in human promyeloleukemia NB4 cells (6Liu T.-X. Zhang J.-W. Tao J. Zhang R.-B. Zhang Q.-H. Zhao C.-J. Tong J.-H. Lanotte M. Waxman S. Chen S.-J. Mao M. Hu G.-X. Chen Z. Blood. 2000; 96: 1496-1504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is understandable that retinoic acid directly or indirectly activates a series of genes that may contribute to differentiation of HL-60 cells. all-trans-retinoic acid retinoic acid-response proline-rich protein pleckstrin homology cyclic AMP-response element serum-response element fluorescein isothiocyanate tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate Chinese hamster ovary rapid amplification of cDNA ends phosphate-buffered saline elongation factor 1 TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate activator protein1. To identify the gene that responds to retinoic acid, we employed a differential display technique using the mRNA from HL-60 cells treated with or without ATRA. We cloned the human homologue of “mouse proline-rich protein 76” and evaluated the mRNA expression in various tissues and reactivity to other differentiation-induced agents. The mRNA was preferentially expressed in the hematopoietic and immune systems, and the marked protein expression was observed in megakaryocytes. Because the protein contains putative Ras-associated domain, pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and proline-rich domain, we evaluated the effect of the RARP1 expression on signal transduction in vitro. Cell Culture and Isolation of Poly(A) RNA—HL-60 and Jurkat cells were purchased from RIKEN. The cells were cultured with RPMI media containing 10% fetal bovine serum. CHO-K1 and CHO-IR cells were cultured as described previously (7Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4427-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from HL-60 cells after 24 h of incubation in the presence or absence of 1 μm ATRA using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Poly(A) RNA was purified by QuickPrep Micro mRNA purification kit (Amersham Biosciences). mRNA Differential Display—Differential display PCR was performed using Genehunter RNA image kit (Genehunter Corp., Nashville, TN), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Two hundred ng of poly(A) RNAs from treated cells were reverse-transcribed with 100 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase in the presence of one-base anchored oligo(dT) primers for 1 h at 37 °C in a total volume of 20 μl. The reaction was terminated by incubation at 75 °C for 5 min. Two μl of the reaction mixture was PCR-amplified with AmpliTaq (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in 0.2 μm H-AP4 (5′-AAGCTTCTCAACG-3′), 13-mer (5′-end primers), and oligo(dT)11 primers (5′-AAGCTTTTTTTTTTTG-3′) (3′-end primers), using a Gene-Amp PCR system 2400 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After cloning into the pGEM-T Easy vector using the TA cloning system (Promega, Madison, WI), the sequenced cDNAs were analyzed via the BLAST program for matches in the GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ data base and were compared with each other via FASTA analysis (DDBJ, Mishima, Japan). The motif search was carried out using Interpro Scan (www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/scan.html). Subcloning and Northern Hybridization Analysis—PCR-reamplified cDNA fragments were subcloned into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Differential expression of the cDNA fragment in the presence or absence of ATRA was confirmed by Northern hybridization following standard procedures. The differentially expressed cDNA fragment or the fragment including the full coding region, labeled with a [α-32P]deoxy-CTP by random prime labeling, was used as the probe for hybridization. As a loading control, elongation factor 1α (EF1) mRNA was detected with an EF1 cDNA probe as described previously (8Ann D.K. Lin H.H. Lee S. Tu Z.-J. Wang E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 699-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the experiment with cycloheximide (Fig. 5c), HL-60 cells were treated for 12 h with medium alone, 1 μm ATRA, 10 μg/ml cycloheximide, or 1 μm ATRA plus 10 μg/ml cycloheximide. For the experiment with HL-60, HEL, and Jurkat cells (Fig. 5d), each cells were treated for 24 h with or without 1 μm ATRA. For the experiment with various compounds (Fig. 5e), HL-60 cells were treated for 24 h with 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide, 10 nm 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), 10 mm troglitazone, 1 μm 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, or 1 μm ATRA. Total RNA was isolated from HL-60 cells using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Cloning Full-length cDNA of RARP1—The nucleotide sequence of RARP1 was determined with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences automated DNA sequencer. Human thymus cDNA library was purchased from Clontech Laboratories (Palo Alto, CA). 2234-bp fragment was isolated from the library. The 5′-end of the gene was cloned by using 5′-RACE method. The 5′-end and 3′-fragment were subcloned into pGEM3Zf. The two clones were digested with BglII restriction site presented in the overlapping region, and the resulting fragments were ligated to obtain full-length RARP1 cDNA. Both the forward and the reverse strands of the cDNA were sequenced to determine the complete cDNA sequence. Construction of the Mammalian Expression Vector and Its Deleted Protein Expression Vectors—The EcoRI-BlnI fragment was cloned into EcoRI-XbaI site of pCDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). The SalI-BlnI fragment including complete coding region of the RARP1 was cloned into SalI-XbaI sites of pDNR-1r vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). A series of deleted mutant fragment was amplified with the following primers and subcloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI): for sense primers: SAL1S, 5′-TGTCGACCGAATTCACTACAGATTAGC-3′; Sal175S, 5′-AGTCGACAAGAAGCTCGTCGTCAAGGTG-3′; and SAL279S, 5′-GGTCGACGGAAAAAAAGAAAGCAAGGAA-3′; for antisense primers: XBA176A, 5′-GTCTAGACTTAACCTTGGCCTCCTTCAG-3′; XBA263A, 5′-GTCTAGATTTCTCCTCTTTCTCCAAAAA-3′; and XBA419A, 5′-GTCTAGAATACTTGGCTATCCGTATTCC-3′. After checking the fidelity of the sequences, each SalI-XbaI fragment was cloned into the pDNR-1r vector. Each fragment was transferred to pLP-CMV-Myc vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) through Cre-mediated recombination. The gene was expressed from the immediate early promoter of cytomegalovirus as a C-terminal fusion to the c-Myc epitope tag. Preparation of Polyclonal Antibodies to RARP1—Synthetic peptides containing a part of the RARP1 amino acid sequence were used in the immunization. The amino acid sequence (CPVPPKRQENPGHPGG) was chosen because of its high antigenicity index, determined by Epitope Adviser (Fujitsu, Shizuoka, Japan). The synthetic peptide was common to the mouse and human proteins. Antibodies were raised in rabbits and were purified by affinity column chromatography with the immunized peptide. Western Blotting and Immunohistochemical Staining—Western blotting of RARP1 was performed as described previously (9Suzuki S. Mori J. Kobayashi M. Inagaki T. Inaba H. Komatsu A. Yamashita K. Takeda T. Miyamoto T. Ichikawa K. Hashizume K. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2003; 148: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed by adding lysis buffer (0.05% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Proteins were resuspended in lysis buffer containing 2% SDS and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were blocked with TBS-T (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% skim milk. Detection was carried out by measuring the enhanced chemiluminescence using a horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Six-week-old mouse frozen tissues were cut in 20-μm sections using a cryostat. After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS, sections were reacted with the primary antibody (1:250 dilution) 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, sections were incubated with FITC-labeled swine anti-rabbit IgG (1:100 dilution) (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) for 2 h at room temperature. In double staining experiments, sections were reacted with rabbit anti-RARP1 antibody and rat anti-CD41 antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, sections were incubated with TRITC-labeled swine anti-rabbit IgG and FITC-labeled swine anti-rat IgG for 2 h at room temperature as the second antibody. After washing with PBS, the sections were mounted with Slow-Fade (Molecular Probes, Portland, OR). Cells expressing FITC and TRITC were imaged on a FLUOVIEW laser-scanning confocal microscope mounted on a BX-50 inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with a 20 × 0.5 N.A. lens (Fig. 6, c–e) or a 40 × 1.0 N.A. oil immersion lens (Fig. 6f). Promoter-Reporter Assay—To detect the pathway activated in the presence of RARP1, we utilized the Mercury Pathway Profiling Systems (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Briefly, CHO-K1, Jurkat, and CHO-IR cells were cultured in 24-well dishes and transiently transfected with promoter-reporter plasmids using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) with serum-free Ham's F-12 media as described in the manufacturer's protocol. These plasmids contained the luciferase reporter gene downstream of several copies of specific transcription factors binding sequences such as AP1, cyclic AMP-response element (CRE), and serum-response element (SRE). In addition, we cotransfected with pSV-β-galactosidase vector (Promega Corp., Madison) in the presence or absence of RARP1 expression vector. Transfected cells were allowed to recover for 24 h after incubating with or without 100 ng/ml TPA, 5 mm dibutyryl cAMP, and 5% fetal bovine serum, respectively. Luciferase activity was determined by the Luciferase Assay System (Promega Corp., Madison) according to the protocol using Berthold Lumat (EG&G Berthold, Evry, France). The activity of β-galactosidase was measured by the method described previously (10Mori J. Suzuki S. Kobayashi M. Inagaki T. Komatsu A. Takeda T. Miyamoto T. Ichikawa K. Hashizume K. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1538-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and all luciferase data were corrected for β-galactosidase activity to account for variations in transfection efficacy. Identification of Differentially Expressed Fragments—We performed differential display on the mRNA from HL-60 cells treated with and without 1 μm retinoic acid (Fig. 1). One of the differentially expressed cDNA fragments, named AP4G, was re-amplified from the band and cloned into pGEM-T vector. The resultant clone was sequenced. Sequence analysis showed that the sequence of AP4G must be located on the 3′-end of a novel gene with unknown function. Cloning the Full-length cDNA of RARP1—Screening of the mRNA expression in 64 different human tissues and 8 cancer cells demonstrated that the AP4G was preferentially expressed in human thymus, spleen, lymph node, bone marrow, and peripheral leukocytes (data not shown). The same probe was used to screen a normal thymus cDNA library. One of the positive clones containing a 2.2-kb (clone 9) insertion was sequenced. By searching with FASTA program, we identified two sequences (GenBank™/EMBL/DDBJ accession numbers AK000812 and BC023110). AK000812 is a human gene whose nucleotide 458–839 was completely the same as the 5′-end of clone 9. BC023110 was a mouse clone that denotes “proline-rich protein 76” whose function is not known. Based on this information, we carried out 5′-RACE. Assembly of the clones and the RACE-PCR sequences gives 2456 nucleotides. The cDNA sequence contains an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 666 amino acids (Fig. 2). Protein homology search with Interpro Scan predicted that there were three functional domains, such as the proline-rich domain, the Ras-associated domain, and the PH domain. The identity score between mouse proline-rich protein 76 and RARP1 was 79.5%. There were two highly homologous regions. One was 83 amino acids in N-terminal region (96.4%). The other was the middle region between 158 alanine and 446 valine including the Ras-associated domain and the PH domain (94.8%). Although the similarities were low in the two proline-rich regions between 84 leucine and 157 glutamine, and 223 amino acids in C-terminal region, the localization of proline residues was conserved. The complete nucleotide sequence of the RARP1 cDNA has been deposited into the DDBJ/GenBank™/EBI Data Bank as accession number AB085852. Tissue Distributions of the RARP1—Analyses of the tissue distributions of RARP1 transcript were carried out using Northern blot membranes manufactured in Clontech. A single band whose length is ∼2.6 kb was identified (Fig. 3). RARP1 was dominantly expressed in thymus, spleen, liver, and peripheral leukocytes. Characterization of RARP1 Expression—The RARP1 was induced by ATRA in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4a). Northern analysis showed that the mRNA was increased 6–12 h after adding 1 μm ATRA in HL-60 cells (Fig. 4b). The treatment with cycloheximide suppressed the expression of the elongation factor 1α (EF1) in HL-60 cells (Fig. 4c, middle panel). The expression of RARP1 was slightly affected by cycloheximide (Fig. 4c, upper panel), although the treatment with cycloheximide blocked the induction of RARP1 with ATRA. The expression in HEL cells was higher than that in HL-60 cells and was increased by the treatment with ATRA, whereas the expression was low and did not respond in Jurkat cells (Fig. 4d). ATRA increased the RARP1 mRNA, although the other known differentiation agents studied did not induce the mRNA (Fig. 4e). RARP1 Protein Accumulates in HL-60 Cells after Incubation with ATRA—We raised specific antibody against RARP1 peptide. A 110-kDa protein was detected in the HL-60 cell lysate treated with 1 μm ATRA for 24 h (Fig. 5a). The expression of the protein was accumulated during 5 days of incubation with 1 μm ATRA in HL-60 cells. The molecular mass of the protein was similar to that expressed in CHO-K1 cells transfected with the mammalian expression vector for RARP1 (Fig. 5b). The cytoplasm was dominantly stained with anti-RARP1 antibody (Fig. 5c). Immunohistochemical Findings—Because mRNA expression was dominant in the tissues associated with immune and hematopoietic systems, we performed immunohistochemistry by using the antibody in thymus, spleen, and bone marrow. Heterogeneous staining was observed in thymus (Fig. 5d). Marked expression was detected in the cytoplasms of megakaryocytes or their progenitor cells whose surface was stained with FITC-labeled CD41 antibody in bone marrow and spleen (Fig. 5, e–g). RARP1 Suppresses TPA- or SRE-driven Transcription— Because motif scanning analyses showed putative Ras-associated domain, PH domain, and proline-rich domain in the RARP1 molecule, we initially evaluated the function of the protein as signaling mediators. To detect the signaling pathway activated in the presence of RARP1 expression, we utilized the Mercury Pathway Profiling Systems (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Several cis-acting enhancer elements, such as AP1 (activator protein1), CRE, and SRE included in this system, were assessed in CHO-K1, Jurkat cells exposed to 100 ng/ml TPA, 5 mm dibutyryl cAMP, and 5% fetal bovine serum, respectively (Fig. 6, a and b). Transcription from the CRE element was not affected, whereas those from the AP1 and SRE were found to be inhibited by the expression of RARP1 in the cell lines studied. To demonstrate the selective effect of RARP1 on endogenous pathways of the signal transduction more clearly, we used CHO-IR cells that possess permanently overexpressed insulin receptor (7Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4427-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Insulin increased transcriptional activity through AP1, SRE, as well as CRE in the cell line. Expression of RARP1 diminished insulin-induced promoter activities through AP1 and SRE but not through CRE (Fig. 6c). Two Proline-rich Domains Were Required for Suppression of Insulin-induced Transactivity through AP1—To map the functional regions for suppression of AP1 transactivation, we transfected with a series of deletion mutants of RARP1 in CHO-IR and evaluated transactivity after stimulation with insulin. As shown in Fig. 7, the insulin-induced AP1 activity was reduced by 23% in the presence of the intact RARP1. The region between 1 and 124 did not affect the transactivity, whereas the region between 1 and 176 decreased the activity by 65%. The suppression was not observed when we transfected the region between 175 and 419, whereas the region between 175 and 666 inhibited the AP1 transactivity by 54%. We have isolated a novel ATRA-response gene by using differential display technique. The FASTA analysis demonstrated that the gene was a human homologue of mouse proline-rich protein 76. The protein was designated RARP1. Structural analysis demonstrated that the protein contains a putative Ras-associated domain, a PH domain, and two proline-rich domains. Ras-associated domain is reported as the effector molecule for R-Ras, K-Ras, and Rap (11Hofer F. Fields S. Schneider C. Martin G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11089-11093Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The function of the PH domain is not clear, but this domain binds to heterotrimeric G proteins, lipids such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, and phosphorylated serine/threonine residues (12Saraste M. Hyvonen M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The proline-rich domain is a low complexity region that is found a variety of proteins from prokaryotes and eukaryotes. It is reported as the molecule of the effector domain for Src homology domain 3 (SH3) (13Pessin J.E. Okada S. Endocr. J. (Suppl. 46). 1999; : S11-S16Crossref Google Scholar). These bioinformatic data suggest that the gene product, at least in part, may be related to the signaling mechanisms. There are numerous ATRA up- and down-regulated genes that are associated with signal transduction, such as fgr, protein kinase Cα, inositol trisphosphate receptor, c-fms, and Src-like adapter protein blr-1 (14Katagiri K. Katagiri T. Koyama Y. Morikawa M. Yamamoto T. Yoshida T. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 701-707PubMed Google Scholar, 15Devalia V. Thomas N.S. Roberts P.J. Jones H.M. Linch D.C.

Cell Biol. 2001; 80: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The ATRA-induced alteration of the expression of these genes including the RARP1, which might induce a different response to the extracellular signals, results in the differentiation of the cells. The similarity to the mouse homologue showed that 83 amino residues in the N-terminal region, the Ras-associated domain, the PH domain, and the position of proline residues in the two proline-rich domains are conserved, suggesting that these regions are crucial for the physiological function of the molecule. The RARP1 mRNAs are preferentially expressed in thymus, spleen, liver, and peripheral leukocytes. Because immunohistochemically liver was not stained with anti-RARP1 antibody (data not shown), the mRNA signal in liver was probably derived from the contaminated leukocytes or lymphocytes. Thus, the expression may be overestimated in liver. The distribution of the RARP1 mRNA suggests that the protein might be related to the hematopoietic and immune function. The RARP1 induction was detected 6–12 h after incubation with ATRA. It is consistent with most of the ATRA-activated genes induced 12–48 h after treatment with ATRA in promyeloleukemic cells (6Liu T.-X. Zhang J.-W. Tao J. Zhang R.-B. Zhang Q.-H. Zhao C.-J. Tong J.-H. Lanotte M. Waxman S. Chen S.-J. Mao M. Hu G.-X. Chen Z. Blood. 2000; 96: 1496-1504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cycloheximide suppressed the expression of EF1 as demonstrated previously (20Chacko G. Ling Q. Hajjar K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19840-19846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The constitutive expression of RARP1 was slightly affected by the treatment with cycloheximide, although the ATRA-induced expression was blocked by the treatment with cycloheximide, suggesting that ATRA-induced proteins are required for ATRA-induced expression of RARP1 at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level. The higher expression was observed in HEL cells, whereas the lower expression was observed in Jurkat cells, indicating various expression levels in leukemia and lymphoma cells. Various stimulators are reported to induce the differentiation in HL-60 cells (21Breitman T.R. Hemmi H. Imaizumi M. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1986; 226: 215-233PubMed Google Scholar). Although dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), TPA, thiazolidinedione including troglitazone, 1,25 (OH)2D3 as well as ATRA induce differentiation in HL-60 cells, the RARP1 expression was not induced by the compounds except ATRA. The data suggest that the retinoic acid is a potent initiator for the induction of RARP1 in HL-60 cells. On the other hand, the protein levels gradually increased after 5 days of incubation with ATRA. ATRA induces apoptosis in HL-60 cells. Since the numbers of the surviving cells decreased during the 5-day incubation with ATRA, the extracts of the protein were mainly obtained from surviving cells, suggesting that the RARP1 expression may be limited to intracellular regions in surviving and/or differentiated cells. Heterogeneous expression of the RARP1 protein in thymus suggests that the expression of the protein may relate to the T-cell development. Marked expression in megakaryocytes implies that the function of the protein relates to megakaryoplatelet differentiation. The molecular mechanisms of RARP1 action are as yet unknown. The gene expression profiling study demonstrated that ATRA induces or suppresses the genes that are participating in the signal transduction pathways including JAKs/STAT, cAMP/protein kinase A, protein kinase C, and mitogen-activated protein kinase in NB4 cells (6Liu T.-X. Zhang J.-W. Tao J. Zhang R.-B. Zhang Q.-H. Zhao C.-J. Tong J.-H. Lanotte M. Waxman S. Chen S.-J. Mao M. Hu G.-X. Chen Z. Blood. 2000; 96: 1496-1504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of several protein domains that are characteristic for signal regulators suggests that RARP1 can directly or indirectly modulate signal transduction. This hypothesis is supported by the selective inhibitory effect of the protein on the transcriptional activity through AP-1 and SRE and not CRE. The two proline-rich domains were required for the suppressive effect of AP1 signaling in the molecule, indicating that the domain-specific function may be present in the molecule of the RARP1. In summary, we have identified RARP1 as the ATRA-induced product in HL-60 cells. Its induction was specifically controlled by ATRA. The protein expression affected signaling mechanisms selectively through its proline-rich domains. Because RARP1 expression was also expressed at high levels in megakaryocyte as well as thymus in vivo, it will be important to determine whether it affects not only myeloid differentiation but also cellular development and/or disease in the lymphoid and megakaryotic lineage of the cells."
