https://openalex.org/W2086124604,High-resolution electron microscopy has revealed that the regions of contact between smooth muscle cells from dog intestine are areas of fusion of adjacent cell membranes. For morphological and functional reasons this type of contact between excitable cells has been termed a nexus.
https://openalex.org/W2092885039,"The wing vibrations of courting male Drosophila melanogaster Meigen produced pulsations of sound, with each pulse apparently caused by 1 to 2 cycles of wing movement. The average repetition rate at 25 degrees C was 29.8 pulses per second. The rate was dependent on temperature, increasing at 1.4 pulses per additional degree Celsius."
https://openalex.org/W2043202840,"Varved sediments from a lake near the present forest-prairie border in northwestern Minnesota provide an annual record of climate change for the last 10,400 years. Climate-sensitive mineral, chemical, and biological components show that the mid-Holocene dry interval between 8500 and 4000 years ago is asymmetrical and actually consists of two distinct drier pulses separated by a moister interval that lasted about 600 years. Cyclic fluctuations with periods of several hundred years were abrupt and persistent throughout the Holocene and are most clearly recorded within the two drier pulses."

The highest level recorded was 6000 ppm. Carbon monoxide was also formed by Euphorbia. Germinating seeds of rye, cucumber, and other species also produced carbon monoxide at levels of 10 to 25 ppm."
https://openalex.org/W1999663357,"In summary, then, we would like to suggest that in broad investigations of the patterns of interaction and relationship among organisms the artificial and stultifying fragmentation of population biology into divisions such as taxonomy, population genetics, and ecology should be ignored. Care also should be taken to scrutinize current concepts such as ""species,"" ""niche,"" and ""community."" If some emergent patterns seem to correspond to a great degree with these concepts, then the concepts may be given operational definitions and the labels should be retained. If there is no such correspondence, then the concepts will have outlived their usefulness and should be discarded. The basic units of population biology are not communities, species, or even populations, but individual organisms (32). In populations, variation, growth, genetic equilibria, selection, behavior, and so on are not ""things"" but relationships. Therefore, what is of interes in population biology is the pattern in which organisms are related in space and time (33)."
https://openalex.org/W2085908501,"Animal life has been shown to exist under the Ross Ice Shelf, from samples obtained with bottom-sampling equipment through naturally occurring cracks in the permanent shelf ice. An abundant fauna, comprising at least nine phyla, was found on a mud and rock bottom. This fauna differs somewhat from that found under nearby seas periodically covered with sea ice 2 to 3 meters thick."

https://openalex.org/W2063989698,"A model is proposed for the East Coast Magnetic Anomaly that, for the first time, incorporates an observed basement feature-a normal fault that consistently lies below the landward flank of the anomaly. The East Coast Magnetic Anomaly is similar to slope anomalies found over passive continental margins in many parts of the world. Thus the proposed model can be used to interpret slope anomalies in general."
https://openalex.org/W2148120872,"Potassium, sodium, and calcium increase and chloride, magnesium, and free amino acids decrease in cold acclimated fresh-water mussels and earthworms. Increased protein synthesis occurs. Neurosecretory cells of cold earthworms exhibit increased activity. Addition of cold worm body fluid stimulates increased O2 consumption by normal tissues, indicating that a hormonal agent triggers the sequence of changes."
https://openalex.org/W1987156795,"Coals were refluxed with palladium, ruthenium, and rhodium catalysts in high-boiling aromatic and heteroaromatic solvents. As much as 53 percent of the hydrogen in one coal was evolved as hydrogen gas. The yield of hydrogen varied with the rank of the coal and the nature of the solvent but was little influenced by the metal or catalyst support."
https://openalex.org/W2032396693,"After being unreported for 83 years, Eulimnadia agassizii Packard was collected from a temporary pool in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, in 1956 and again in 1961. This conchostracan attains maturity in 5 days and may reappear several times during the summer months in the same location."
https://openalex.org/W2059868944,"The Mendocino fracture zone may continue through or below North America near 40Â°N latitude. This is suggested by instances of left-lateral movement, location of basin deeps, sedimentation patterns, interruption of a major magnetic anomaly, and inflection of major structural trends. A major segmentation of middle North America results."
https://openalex.org/W1998138921,"Chromatophore complexes are described in the siphonophore Nanomia cara. The dispersion and concentration of pigment are related to variation in light intensity and do not appear to be endogenously influenced. The pigment, possibly an ommochrome, has an absorption maximum at 465 to 470 mmicro."

https://openalex.org/W2150554915,Goldfish placed in deoxygenated water learned to interrupt a light beam in order to obtain brief exposure to aerated water. The training procedure brought this behavior under the control of arbitrary visual stimuli.
https://openalex.org/W2083296004,"The occurrence of pogonophoran worms of the genus Siboglinum off the east coast of Florida is reported. Their presence in association with pennatulids is noted, and compared with a similar instance in the Bering Sea. This association is probably due to similar ecological requirements."
