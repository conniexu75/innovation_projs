https://openalex.org/W2593603912,"Vaccine hesitancy has become the focus of growing attention and concern globally despite overwhelming evidence of the value of vaccines in preventing disease and saving the lives of millions of individuals every year. Measuring vaccine hesitancy and its determinants worldwide is important in order to understand the scope of the problem and for the development of evidence-based targeted strategies to reduce hesitancy. Two indicators to assess vaccine hesitancy were developed to capture its nature and scope at the national and subnational level to collect data in 2014: 1) The top 3 reasons for not accepting vaccines according to the national schedule in the past year and whether the response was opinion- or assessment-based and 2) Whether an assessment (or measurement) of the level of confidence in vaccination had taken place at national or subnational level in the previous 5 years. The most frequently cited reasons for vaccine hesitancy globally related to (1) the risk-benefit of vaccines, (2) knowledge and awareness issues, (3) religious, cultural, gender or socio-economic factors. Major issues were fear of side effects, distrust in vaccination and lack of information on immunization or immunization services. The analysis revealed that 29% of all countries had done an assessment of the level of confidence in their country, suggesting that vaccine confidence was an issue of importance. Monitoring vaccine hesitancy is critical because of its influence on the success of immunization programs. To our knowledge, the proposed indicators provide the first global snapshot of reasons driving vaccine hesitancy and depicting its widespread nature, as well as the extent of assessments conducted by countries."
https://openalex.org/W2593544648,"The reasons for using electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) are poorly understood and are primarily documented by expensive cross-sectional surveys that use preconceived close-ended response options rather than allowing respondents to use their own words. We passively identify the reasons for using ENDS longitudinally from a content analysis of public postings on Twitter. All English language public tweets including several ENDS terms (e.g., “e-cigarette” or “vape”) were captured from the Twitter data stream during 2012 and 2015. After excluding spam, advertisements, and retweets, posts indicating a rationale for vaping were retained. The specific reasons for vaping were then inferred based on a supervised content analysis using annotators from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. During 2012 quitting combustibles was the most cited reason for using ENDS with 43% (95%CI 39–48) of all reason-related tweets cited quitting combustibles, e.g., “I couldn’t quit till I tried ecigs,” eclipsing the second most cited reason by more than double. Other frequently cited reasons in 2012 included ENDS’s social image (21%; 95%CI 18–25), use indoors (14%; 95%CI 11–17), flavors (14%; 95%CI 11–17), safety relative to combustibles (9%; 95%CI 7–11), cost (3%; 95%CI 2–5) and favorable odor (2%; 95%CI 1–3). By 2015 the reasons for using ENDS cited on Twitter had shifted. Both quitting combustibles and use indoors significantly declined in mentions to 29% (95%CI 24–33) and 12% (95%CI 9–16), respectively. At the same time, social image increased to 37% (95%CI 32–43) and lack of odor increased to 5% (95%CI 2–5), the former leading all cited reasons in 2015. Our data suggest the reasons people vape are shifting away from cessation and toward social image. The data also show how the ENDS market is responsive to a changing policy landscape. For instance, smoking indoors was less frequently cited in 2015 as indoor smoking restrictions became more common. Because the data and analytic approach are scalable, adoption of our strategies in the field can inform follow-up survey-based surveillance (so the right questions are asked), interventions, and policies for ENDS."
https://openalex.org/W2592565933,"Hyaluronan (HA) is an extremely large polysaccharide (glycosaminoglycan) involved in many cellular functions. HA catabolism is thought to involve the initial cleavage of extracellular high-molecular-weight (HMW) HA into intermediate-size HA by an extracellular or cell-surface hyaluronidase, internalization of intermediate-size HA, and complete degradation into monosaccharides in lysosomes. Despite considerable research, the identity of the hyaluronidase responsible for the initial HA cleavage in the extracellular space remains elusive. HYAL1 and HYAL2 have properties more consistent with lysosomal hyaluronidases, whereas CEMIP/KIAA1199, a recently identified HA-binding molecule that has HA-degrading activity, requires the participation of the clathrin-coated pit pathway of live cells for HA degradation. Here we show that transmembrane protein 2 (TMEM2), a mammalian homolog of a protein playing a role in zebrafish endocardial cushion development, is a cell-surface hyaluronidase. Live immunostaining and surface biotinylation assays confirmed that mouse TMEM2 is expressed on the cell surface in a type II transmembrane topology. TMEM2 degraded HMW-HA into ∼5-kDa fragments but did not cleave chondroitin sulfate or dermatan sulfate, indicating its specificity to HA. The hyaluronidase activity of TMEM2 was Ca2+-dependent; the enzyme's pH optimum is around 6–7, and unlike CEMIP/KIAA1199, TMEM2 does not require the participation of live cells for its hyaluronidase activity. Moreover, TMEM2-expressing cells could eliminate HA immobilized on a glass surface in a contact-dependent manner. Together, these data suggest that TMEM2 is the long-sought-after hyaluronidase that cleaves extracellular HMW-HA into intermediate-size fragments before internalization and degradation in the lysosome.

It is a linear polymer of extremely large molecular mass, often exceeding 106 Da (1Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R. Hyaluronan.FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2074) Google Scholar). The sheer size of HA suggests that cells should have very efficient mechanisms for its metabolism. In fact, one-third of the total body HA, which is estimated to be 15 g in a human with a 70-kg body weight, is thought to be turned over daily (2Fraser J.R. Laurent T.C. Turnover and metabolism of hyaluronan.Ciba Found. Symp. 1989; 143: 41-53PubMed Google Scholar). In skin, the metabolic half-life of HA is 1 to 1.5 days (3Stern R. Devising a pathway for hyaluronan catabolism: are we there yet?.Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 105R-115RCrossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). It is believed that high-molecular-weight (HMW) HA (106–107 Da) is first degraded extracellularly into intermediate-size fragments of 10–100 kDa. These are then internalized and degraded to monosaccharides by the combined actions of lysosomal hyaluronidase and exoglucosidases (4Stern R. Kogan G. Jedrzejas M.J. Soltés L. The many ways to cleave hyaluronan.Biotechnol. Adv. 2007; 25: 537-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Considering the accumulating evidence for the role of HA degradation in tumor invasion and metastasis (5Chanmee T. Ontong P. Itano N. Hyaluronan: A modulator of the tumor microenvironment.Cancer Lett. 2016; 375: 20-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), identifying the molecule(s) that degrade HA on the cell surface is an important biological issue. hyaluronan high molecular weight fluorescein-labeled hyaluronan glycosaminoglycan chondroitin sulfate embryonic day cell migration-inducing and hyaluronan-binding protein dermatan sulfate glycosylphosphatidylinositol quantitative PCR. The HYAL family molecules have been implicated as the major players in HA catabolism. HYAL1 and HYAL2 are expressed widely and postulated to be the key hyaluronidases involved in HA catabolism in somatic tissues. However, some data on HYAL1 and HYAL2 are inconsistent with the notion that these molecules are the physiological hyaluronidases that cleave HMW-HA on the cell surface or in the extracellular space. Both HYAL1 and HYAL2 favor acidic pH for their activity. HYAL1 is enzymatically active only below pH 5.5 (6Afify A.M. Stern M. Guntenhöner M. Stern R. Purification and characterization of human serum hyaluronidase.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 434-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and the pH optimum for HYAL2 is pH 4 (7Lepperdinger G. Strobl B. Kreil G.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22466-22470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Such low pH optima suggest that they are more likely to be lysosomal enzymes. In fact, there is evidence that both HYAL1 and HYAL2 are primarily present in lysosomes (7Lepperdinger G. Strobl B. Kreil G.

Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 6296-6300Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Although HYAL2 is GPI-anchored and a part of HYAL2 molecules are fractionated in the membrane fraction (9Rai S.K. Duh F.M. Vigdorovich V. Danilkovitch-Miagkova A. Lerman M.I. Miller A.D.

U.S.A. 2001; 98: 4443-4448Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), this does not entirely substantiate its physiological role as a cell-surface hyaluronidase, as its HA-degrading activity is very low, at least 50 times lower than that of HYAL1 (9Rai S.K.

Other HYAL family molecules, PH-20/SPAM1 and HYAL5, can function at neutral pH (11Stern R. Jedrzejas M.J. Hyaluronidases: their genomics, structures, and mechanisms of action.Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 818-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 12Kim E. Baba D. Kimura M. Yamashita M. Kashiwabara S. Baba T.

Although there are reports that PH-20/SPAM1 is expressed in some cancers (13Bouga H. Tsouros I. Bounias D. Kyriakopoulou D. Stavropoulos M.S. Papageorgakopoulou N. Theocharis D.A. Vynios D.H.

Res. 2002; 103: 203-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), their expression in normal tissues is largely restricted in the testis, and it is unlikely that PH-20/SPAM1 and HYAL5 act as principal extracellular hyaluronidase in a broad range of normal somatic tissues. Other than the HYAL family molecules, the cell migration-inducing and hyaluronan-binding protein (CEMIP), also known as KIAA1199, has HA-binding and -degrading activities (16Yoshida H. Nagaoka A. Kusaka-Kikushima A. Tobiishi M. Kawabata K. Sayo T. Sakai S. Sugiyama Y. Enomoto H. Okada Y. Inoue S. KIAA1199, a deafness gene of unknown function, is a new hyaluronan binding protein involved in hyaluronan depolymerization.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 5612-5617Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). CEMIP is a putative secretory protein containing an N-terminal signal sequence, and therefore it is considered to be a strong candidate as a hyaluronidase that acts in the extracellular space. CEMIP-mediated HA degradation, however, requires the participation of the clathrin-coated pit pathway (16Yoshida H. Nagaoka A. Kusaka-Kikushima A. Tobiishi M. Kawabata K. Sayo T. Sakai S. Sugiyama Y. Enomoto H. Okada Y. Inoue S. KIAA1199, a deafness gene of unknown function, is a new hyaluronan binding protein involved in hyaluronan depolymerization.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 5612-5617Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), suggesting that CEMIP may not simply act as an extracellular hyaluronidase. Also noteworthy is that neither conditioned media of CEMIP-expressing cells nor recombinant CEMIP show HA-degrading activity. In addition, CEMIP is detected mainly inside the cells (16Yoshida H. Nagaoka A. Kusaka-Kikushima A. Tobiishi M. Kawabata K. Sayo T. Sakai S. Sugiyama Y. Enomoto H. Okada Y. Inoue S. KIAA1199, a deafness gene of unknown function, is a new hyaluronan binding protein involved in hyaluronan depolymerization.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Unraveling the role of KIAA1199, a novel endoplasmic reticulum protein, in cancer cell migration.J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2013; 105: 1402-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Against this backdrop, we sought to identify a novel hyaluronidase that is present and functions on the cell surface. Here we report that transmembrane protein 2 (TMEM2), a type II transmembrane protein with sequence similarities to CEMIP, is such a cell-surface hyaluronidase. TMEM2 depolymerizes HMW-HA to HA fragments of ∼5 kDa in a Ca2+-dependent manner with a pH optimum between pH 6 and 7. Surface biotinylation and live cell immunostaining confirm that TMEM2 is indeed expressed on the cell surface, and TMEM2-expressing cells can degrade substrate-bound HA in a contact-dependent manner. Finally, absolute quantification of transcript copy numbers reveals that Tmem2 mRNA is expressed ubiquitously in adult mouse tissues and during development at far higher levels than Cemip mRNA. Together, these data suggest that TMEM2 is a novel hyaluronidase that cleaves extracellular HMW-HA into intermediate-sized fragments prior to internalization and complete degradation of these HA fragments in the lysosome. In search of a novel hyaluronidase that is present on the cell surface, we searched the database for mammalian proteins that have similarity to CEMIP. This led to the identification of TMEM2 (HUGO Gene Nomenclature ID: 11869), a member of the TMEM family, as a candidate. The TMEM family is a heterogeneous collection of more than 300 different human open reading frames that are grouped based only on the presence of at least one putative transmembrane domain (18Wrzesiński T. Szelag M. Cieślikowski W.A. Ida A. Giles R. Zodro E. Szumska J. Poźniak J. Kwias Z. Bluyssen H.A. Wesoly J. Expression of pre-selected TMEMs with predicted ER localization as potential classifiers of ccRCC tumors.BMC Cancer. 2015; 15: 518Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The functions of many of TMEM proteins are unknown. In the case of TMEM2, however, the phenotype of zebrafish mutants of the TMEM2 homolog suggests its role in cardiac morphogenesis (19Smith K.A.

The open reading frame of human TMEM2 (NCBI RefSeq: NM_013390) predicts a type II transmembrane protein containing PbH1 repeats, a structural feature present in CEMIP (16Yoshida H. Nagaoka A. Kusaka-Kikushima A. Tobiishi M. Kawabata K. Sayo T. Sakai S. Sugiyama Y. Enomoto H. Okada Y. Inoue S.

Domain structures of TMEM2 in comparison with CEMIP are shown in Fig. 1A. The deduced amino acid sequence of TMEM2 consists of (from its N terminus) an 82-residue cytoplasmic domain, a single transmembrane domain, and 1278-residue extracellular domain. The extracellular domain contains one G8 domain (22He Q.Y. Liu X.H. Li Q. Studholme D.J. Li X.W. Liang S.P. G8: a novel domain associated with polycystic kidney disease and non-syndromic hearing loss.Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 2189-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), one GG domain (23Guo J. Cheng H. Zhao S. Yu L. GG: a domain involved in phage LTF apparatus and implicated in human MEB and non-syndromic hearing loss diseases.FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 581-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and three PbH1 repeats. In comparison, CEMIP contains one G8, two GG, and four PbH1 repeats, and the overall amino acid identity between CEMIP and the extracellular domain of TMEM2 is 48%. We examined whether TMEM2 is indeed expressed as a type II transmembrane protein. Mouse TMEM2 cDNA tagged with a FLAG epitope at its C terminus was transiently transfected to MG-63 cells, and the expression of TMEM2 was probed by live immunostaining with anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 1B, live staining with anti-FLAG antibody detected TMEM2 immunoreactivity on the cell surface, demonstrating not only the presence of the protein on the cell surface but also that the C terminus is outside the cell. To further investigate cell-surface expression of TMEM2, we performed a surface biotinylation assay on TMEM2-transfected MG-63 and 293T cells. This analysis confirms cell-surface localization of TMEM2 in both MG-63 and 293T cells (Fig. 1C, surface). No TMEM2 was detected in culture supernatants (Fig. 1C, supernatant). Together, these results demonstrate that TMEM2 is a type II transmembrane protein, as predicted from its deduced sequence. To determine whether TMEM2 has the ability to depolymerize HA, we used a cell-based HA degradation assay, in which fluorescein-labeled HA (FA-HA) of various sizes was added to culture media of 293T cells transiently transfected with the FLAG-tagged, full-length TMEM2 cDNA (TMEM2WT). Parental 293T cells show no HA-depolymerizing activity in this assay (16Yoshida H. Nagaoka A. Kusaka-Kikushima A. Tobiishi M. Kawabata K. Sayo T. Sakai S. Sugiyama Y. Enomoto H. Okada Y. Inoue S. KIAA1199, a deafness gene of unknown function, is a new hyaluronan binding protein involved in hyaluronan depolymerization.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 5612-5617Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) (see also the elution patterns with mock-transfected cells in Fig. 2A). With TMEM2-transfected cells, HMW-HA with an average molecular size of 1500 kDa (FA-HA1500) was depolymerized into fragments of ∼5 kDa (Fig. 2A, HA1500). Smaller HA (FA-HA200 and FA-HA20) were also depolymerized into ∼5-kDa fragments (Fig. 2A, HA200 and HA20), whereas HA fragments with an average size of 5 kDa (Fig. 2A, HA5) were not further degraded, suggesting that ∼5 kDa (∼100 sugar residues long) is the smallest size on which TMEM2 can act. It has been reported that the HYAL family hyaluronidases, such as HYAL1 and HYAL2, have broad substrate specificity and depolymerize not only HA but chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate (11Stern R. Jedrzejas M.J. Hyaluronidases: their genomics, structures, and mechanisms of action.Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 818-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). To examine the substrate specificity of TMEM2, we tested chondroitin sulfate (CS)-A, CS-C, CS-D, and dermatan sulfate (DS) in the same cell-based assay. None of these GAGs were depolymerized by TMEM2 (Fig. 2B), indicating that the GAG depolymerizing activity of TMEM2 is specific for HA. To gain insight into the enzymatic mechanism of TMEM2, we first examined the Ca2+ dependence of HA-depolymerizing activity. Although there has been no report that the HYAL family hyaluronidases require Ca2+ for their activity, some of the bacterial polysaccharide lyases, such as pectate lyases, with which TMEM2 shares the PbH1 repeats, are Ca2+-dependent (24Scavetta R.D. Herron S.R. Hotchkiss A.T. Kita N. Keen N.T. Benen J.A. Kester H.C. Visser J. Jurnak F.

Biol. 1994; 1: 717-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). To examine the requirement for Ca2+, the HA degradation assay was performed with the membrane fraction of TMEM2-transfected 293T cells as an enzyme source. As shown in Fig. 2C, FA-HA1500 was depolymerized into ∼5-kDa fragments in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 but not in the absence of CaCl2, demonstrating that TMEM2 requires Ca2+ for its HA-depolymerizing activity. Although a detailed elucidation of its exact enzymatic mechanism would ultimately require the three-dimensional structure of TMEM2 complexed with HA fragments, we sought to gain initial insight into this issue by examining the effect of mutagenesis of certain amino acid residues that are considered to be functionally important based on sequence information. One such residue is Arg265 (Fig. 3A), which positionally corresponds to the site of the deafness mutation (Arg187) in the human CEMIP gene (16Yoshida H. Nagaoka A. Kusaka-Kikushima A. Tobiishi M. Kawabata K. Sayo T. Sakai S. Sugiyama Y. Enomoto H. Okada Y. Inoue S. KIAA1199, a deafness gene of unknown function, is a new hyaluronan binding protein involved in hyaluronan depolymerization.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 5612-5617Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 27Abe S. Usami S. Nakamura Y. Mutations in the gene encoding KIAA1199 protein, an inner-ear protein expressed in Deiters' cells and the fibrocytes, as the cause of nonsyndromic hearing loss.J. Hum. Genet. 2003; 48: 564-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Because this mutation in CEMIP has been shown to reduce its HA-depolymerizing activity (16Yoshida H. Nagaoka A. Kusaka-Kikushima A. Tobiishi M. Kawabata K. Sayo T. Sakai S. Sugiyama Y. Enomoto H. Okada Y. Inoue S. KIAA1199, a deafness gene of unknown function, is a new hyaluronan binding protein involved in hyaluronan depolymerization.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 5612-5617Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), we surmised that Arg265 may also be important for the HA-depolymerizing activity of TMEM2. Moreover, an interesting feature in the region surrounding Arg265 is the DQD275 sequence just downstream of Arg265. DXD motifs have been shown to serve as functionally critical Ca2+-coordination sites in Erwinia pectate lyases, which, like TMEM2 and CEMIP, contain the PbH1 repeats (24Scavetta R.D. Herron S.R. Hotchkiss A.T. Kita N. Keen N.T. Benen J.A. Kester H.C. Visser J. Jurnak F.

Also, many glycosyltransferases possess DXD motifs that are involved in the coordination with divalent cations and/or a ribose (29Lairson L.L. Henrissat B. Davies G.J. Withers S.G. Glycosyltransferases: structures, functions, and mechanisms.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar). Thus we performed a series of mutagenesis experiments focused on Arg265, Asp273, and Asp275. In addition, we generated mutants at other acidic residues in the region (Glu260, Asp262, Glu281, Glu283, and Asp286). Among these residues, Arg265, Asp273, and Asp286 are completely conserved between TMEM2 and CEMIP (Fig. 3A). We generated single- and double-point mutants in which residues have been mutagenized as follows: R265C, D273N, D275N, D286N, E260N/D262Q, and E281Q/E283Q. We first confirmed that these mutagenized TMEM2 proteins were expressed at similar levels upon transfection into 293T cells (Fig. 3B). HA degradation assays with 293T cells were performed with these mutants (Fig. 3C). D275N, E260N/D262Q, and E281Q/E283Q mutants are as enzymatically active as wild-type TMEM2. In contrast, the activities of R265C, D273N, and D286N mutants were greatly reduced in comparison with wild-type TMEM2. Although the elucidation of the role of these residues requires the crystal structure of TMEM2, these results demonstrate that this region is important for the hyaluronidase activity of TMEM2. The presence of TMEM on the cell surface (see Fig. 1) and its activity under standard cell culture conditions (see Fig. 2) strongly suggest that TMEM2 acts primarily on the cell surface. We sought additional insight into the cellular site of action of TMEM2 by examining the pH optimum for its HA-degrading activity. To prevent the contamination in this analysis by endogenous hyaluronidases residing in intracellular compartments, we produced an N-terminally truncated, soluble TMEM2 consisting only of its extracellular domain. Truncated TMEM2 was secreted into culture supernatants of 293T cells as a soluble protein migrating at ∼180 kDa (Fig. 4A). HA degradation assays were performed in a range of pH 4–8 with concentrated culture supernatants as an enzyme source. Results from these experiments indicate that the soluble TMEM2 is active in the range of pH 5–8 with the highest activity around pH 6 (Fig. 4, B and C), consistent with the notion that TMEM2 is functional in the extracellular environment. Below pH 5, TMEM2 quickly loses activity, becoming totally inactive at pH 4. This suggests that TMEM2 is unlikely to be enzymatically active in lysosomes. Additionally, the retention of enzymatic activity of this soluble form demonstrates that, unlike CEMIP, TMEM2 can exert the hyaluronidase activity independent of the participation of cellular endocytic pathways. Cell-surface localization of TMEM2 and the lack of release into culture supernatants (see Fig. 1) suggest that TMEM2 degrades matrix-bound HA upon cell contact or adhesion. To examine this mode of action, we devised an assay in which TMEM2-transfected 293T cells are cultured on a substrate of FA-HA1500 immobilized to amino-silanized glass (30Werb Z. Tremble P.M. Behrendtsen O. Crowley E. Damsky C.H. Signal transduction through the fibronectin receptor induces collagenase and stromelysin gene expression.J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 877-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). In this assay, the spatial nature of HA degradation is revealed as “dark holes” in a fluorescent background. Cultures with mock-transfected cells revealed no holes in HA substrates (Fig. 5, mock). In contrast, TMEM2-transfected cells created conspicuous holes, corresponding to the locations of cell clusters adhering to the substrate (Fig. 5, Wild-type TMEM2). As an additional control, we examined cells transfected with the D273N mutant, which has greatly reduced hyaluronidase activity (see Fig. 3C). D273N-expressing cells created less significant holes than cells transfected with wild-type TMEM2 (Fig. 5, D273N). Together, these results indicate that cells expressing TMEM2 can degrade matrix-bound HA at sites of cell-substratum contacts. To gain insight regarding the physiological sites of TMEM2 action, we analyzed Tmem2 mRNA expression in various mouse tissues. In doing so, we also sought to compare the expression levels of Tmem2 and Cemip, because both are presumed to act on the same substrate. However, standard expression profiling techniques, such as qPCR and microarray analysis, do not allow comparison of expression levels between different genes (“inter-gene” comparison). Therefore, to enable inter-gene comparison between Tmem2 and Cemip, we performed absolute quantification of mRNA copy numbers using the standard curve method (31Yu Y. Lee C. Kim J. Hwang S. Group-specific primer and probe sets to detect methanogenic communities using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2005; 89: 670-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6A, Tmem2 is widely expressed in essentially all organs examined, with copy numbers greater than 2 × 105 copies per μg of total RNA. (In comparison, Hyal2 mRNA is expressed at 4.1 × 105, 7.3 × 105, and 1.4 × 105 copies per μg of total RNA in the heart, liver, and lung, respectively.) An especially high level of Tmem2 expression was found in the lung (1.6 × 106 copies per μg of total RNA). Also noteworthy is that the expression level of Tmem2 is much higher than that of Cemip in the majority of organs, except for the brain, spleen, and synovium where they are expressed at similar levels. Essentially no Cemip transcripts were detected in the lung, liver, salivary gland, colon, kidney, and ureter. Developmental expression was examined in whole mouse embryos at embryonic day (E) E11, E15, and E17 (Fig. 6B). A high level of Tmem2 expression was found at embryonic day E11, after which expression declines. Little Cemip expression was detected at any time point examined. Together, these data demonstrate that in essentially all adult tissues and during embryonic development, Tmem2 is much more abundantly expressed than Cemip. Catabolism of HA involves multiple steps mediated by enzymes present in different cellular compartments. The widely accepted model (11Stern R. Jedrzejas M.J. Hyaluronidases: their genomics, structures, and mechanisms of action.Chem.

We selectively targeted the O-GlcNAcase (Oga) gene in the mouse brain to define the role of O-GlcNAc cycling in the central nervous system. Brain knockout animals exhibited dramatically increased brain O-GlcNAc levels and pleiotropic phenotypes, including early-onset obesity, growth defects, and metabolic dysregulation. Anatomical defects in the Oga knockout included delayed brain differentiation and neurogenesis as well as abnormal proliferation accompanying a developmental delay. The molecular basis for these defects included transcriptional changes accompanying differentiating embryonic stem cells. In Oga KO mouse ES cells, we observed pronounced changes in expression of pluripotency markers, including Sox2, Nanog, and Otx2. These findings link the O-GlcNAc modification to mammalian neurogenesis and highlight the role of this nutrient-sensing pathway in developmental plasticity and metabolic homeostasis."

However, they lack insight into mechanisms, often have low external and ecological validity, and have rarely focused on people with some psycho-physiological affection. The aim of this study was to use a randomized, case-crossover design to investigate: (i) the effects of unconstrained exposure to real natural and urban environments on psycho-physiological indicators of people with indications of psychological distress, (ii) the possible differential effects of 30 and 30+180 minutes exposures, and (iii) the possible mechanisms explaining these effects. Material and methods People (n = 26) with indications of psychological distress were exposed to green (Collserola Natural Park), blue (Castelldefels beach) and urban (Eixample neighbourhood) environments in Catalonia. They were exposed to all environments in groups for a period of 30+180 minutes between October 2013 and January 2014. During the exposure period, participants were instructed to do what they would usually do in that environment. Before, during (at 30 and 30+180 minutes) and after each exposure, several psycho-physiological measures were taken: mood (measured as Total Mood Disturbance, TMD), attention capacity (measured as backwards digit-span task), stress levels (measures as salivary cortisol), systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, autonomous nervous system (assessed as heart rate variability and the indicators: low frequency power (LF), high frequency power (HF), ratio between LF and HF (LF:HF), and coefficients of component variance of LF, HF, and LF:HF). We also measured several potential mediators: air pollution, noise, physical activity, social interactions, and self-perceived restoration experience. Results When compared with responses to urban environment, we found statistically significantly lower TMD [-4.78 (-7.77, -1.79) points difference], and salivary cortisol [-0.21 (-0.34, -0.08) log nmol/L] in the green exposure environment, and statistically significantly lower TMD [-4.53 (-7.57, -1.49) points difference], and statistically significant favourable changes in heart rate variability indicators (specifically LF:HF and CCV-LF:HF with around -0.20 points of difference of the indicators) in the blue exposure environment. Physical activity and self-perceived restoration experience partially mediated the associations between NOE and TMD. Physical activity and air pollution partially mediated the associations between NOE and heart rate variability. Discussion and conclusions This study extends the existing evidence on the benefits of NOE for people's health. It also suggests NOE potential as a preventive medicine, specifically focusing on people with indications of psychological distress. Trial registration Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02624921"

A four-enzyme pathway in the mitochondrion detoxifies H2S by converting it to thiosulfate and sulfate. Recent studies have shown that globins like hemoglobin and myoglobin can also oxidize H2S to thiosulfate and hydropolysulfides. Neuroglobin, a globin enriched in the brain, was reported to bind H2S tightly and was postulated to play a role in modulating neuronal sensitivity to H2S in conditions such as stroke. However, the H2S reactivity of the coordinately saturated heme in neuroglobin is expected a priori to be substantially lower than that of the 5-coordinate hemes present in myoglobin and hemoglobin. To resolve this discrepancy, we explored the role of the distal histidine residue in muting the reactivity of human neuroglobin toward H2S. Ferric neuroglobin is slowly reduced by H2S and catalyzes its inefficient oxidative conversion to thiosulfate. Mutation of the distal His64 residue to alanine promotes rapid binding of H2S and its efficient conversion to oxidized products. X-ray absorption, EPR, and resonance Raman spectroscopy highlight the chemically different reaction options influenced by the distal histidine ligand. This study provides mechanistic insights into how the distal heme ligand in neuroglobin caps its reactivity toward H2S and identifies by cryo-mass spectrometry a range of sulfide oxidation products with 2–6 catenated sulfur atoms with or without oxygen insertion, which accumulate in the absence of the His64 ligand.

https://openalex.org/W2594371417,"IL-1β release is integral to the innate immune system. The release of mature IL-1β depends on 2 regulated events: the de novo induction of pro-IL-1β, generally via NF-κB-dependent transduction pathways; and the assembly and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. This latter step is reliant on active caspase-1, pannexin-1, and P2X7 receptor activation. Pathogen-associated molecular patterns in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria activate IL-1β release from immune cells via TLR2 and TLR4 receptors, respectively. We found that pro-IL-1β and mature IL-1β release from human monocytes is stimulated by the TLR2 agonists Pam3CSK4 or FSL-1, as well as the TLR4 agonist LPS in the absence of additional ATP. TLR2 agonists required pannexin-1 and P2X7 receptor activation to stimulate IL-1β release. In contrast, IL-1β release stimulated by the TLR4 agonist LPS is independent of both pannexin-1 and P2X7 activation. In the absence of exogenous ATP, P2X7 activation requires endogenous ATP release, which occurs in some cells via pannexin-1. In line with this, we found that LPS-stimulated human monocytes released relatively low levels of ATP, whereas cells stimulated with TLR2 agonists released high levels of ATP. These findings suggest that in human monocytes, both TLR2 and TLR4 signaling induce pro-IL-1β expression, but the mechanism by which they activate caspase-1 diverges at the level of the pannexin-1/ATP/P2X7 axis.-Parzych, K., Zetterqvist, A.

Pars plana vitrectomy (23G) was performed in the right eye of 24 pigmented rabbits. Retinal detachment of two quadrants was induced by creating a small retinotomy near the vascular arcade and injecting balanced salt solution (BSS) subretinally. The retina was reattached by injecting air, which was followed by increasing the infusion pressure, and the retinal tear was treated by endolaser photocoagulation. At the end of the procedure, the eye was filled either with 5000-cs silicone oil (after fluid air exchange) or the respective hydrogel (with two different viscosities). Follow-up examination included slit lamp examination, funduscopy, intraocular pressure measurements (IOP), optical coherence tomography (OCT) and electroretinogram (ERG) measurements. After a maximum follow-up of four weeks both eyes were removed, examined macroscopically, photographed, and prepared for histology. Of the eight rabbits that received silicone oil, seven (87.5%) developed a recurrent retinal detachment with pronounced proliferative vitreoretinopathy within the first two weeks after surgery. In contrast, in the hydrogel treated eyes, the retina stayed attached in the majority of the cases (73.3%). IOP and retinal morphology were normal as long as the retina remained re-attached. In conclusions, this model of retinal detachment, both thiolated crosslinked hyaluronate hydrogels showed superior efficacy when compared to silicone oil. These hydrogels have a promising potential as novel vitreous body substitutes."
https://openalex.org/W2594209308,"Background Penicillium roqueforti is a filamentous fungus used for making blue cheeses worldwide. It also occurs as a food spoiler and in silage and wood. Previous studies have revealed a strong population genetic structure, with specific traits associated with the different populations. Here, we used a large strain collection from worldwide cheeses published recently to investigate the genetic structure of P. roqueforti. Principal findings We found a genetic population structure in P. roqueforti that was consistent with previous studies, with two main genetic clusters (W+C+ and W-C-, i.e., with and without horizontal gene transferred regions CheesyTer and Wallaby). In addition, we detected a finer genetic subdivision that corresponded to the environment and to protected designation of origin (PDO), namely the Roquefort PDO. We indeed found evidence for eight genetic clusters, one of the cluster including only strains from other environments than cheeses, and another cluster encompassing only strains from the Roquefort PDO. The W-C- and W+C+ cheese clusters were not the most closely related ones, suggesting that there may have been two independent domestication events of P. roqueforti for making blue cheeses. Significance The additional population structure revealed here may be relevant for cheese-makers and for understanding the history of domestication in P. roqueforti."
https://openalex.org/W2592460359,"Protein O-glycosylation is an important post-translational modification in all organisms, but deciphering the specific functions of these glycans is difficult due to their structural complexity. Understanding the glycosylation of mucin-like proteins presents a particular challenge as they are modified numerous times with both the enzymes involved and the glycosylation patterns being poorly understood. Here we systematically explored the O-glycosylation pathway of a mucin-like serine-rich repeat protein PsrP from the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae TIGR4. Previous works have assigned the function of 3 of the 10 glycosyltransferases thought to modify PsrP, GtfA/B, and Gtf3 as catalyzing the first two reactions to form a unified disaccharide core structure. We now use in vivo and in vitro glycosylation assays combined with hydrolytic activity assays to identify the glycosyltransferases capable of decorating this core structure in the third and fourth steps of glycosylation. Specifically, the full-length GlyE and GlyG proteins and the GlyD DUF1792 domain participate in both steps, whereas full-length GlyA and the GlyD GT8 domain catalyze only the fourth step. Incorporation of different sugars to the disaccharide core structure at multiple sites along the serine-rich repeats results in a highly polymorphic product. Furthermore, crystal structures of apo- and UDP-complexed GlyE combined with structural analyses reveal a novel Rossmann-fold add-on domain that we speculate to function as a universal module shared by GlyD, GlyE, and GlyA to forward the peptide acceptor from one enzyme to another. These findings define the complete glycosylation pathway of a bacterial glycoprotein and offer a testable hypothesis of how glycosyltransferase coordination facilitates glycan assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2594771362,"Stable isotope ratios of grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) guard hair collected from bears on the lower Stikine River, British Columbia (BC) were analyzed to: 1) test whether measuring δ34S values improved the precision of the salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) diet fraction estimate relative to δ15N as is conventionally done, 2) investigate whether measuring δ34S values improves the separation of diet contributions of moose (Alces alces), marmot (Marmota caligata), and mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus) and, 3) examine the relationship between collection date and length of hair and stable isotope values. Variation in isotope signatures among hair samples from the same bear and year were not trivial. The addition of δ34S values to mixing models used to estimate diet fractions generated small improvement in the precision of salmon and terrestrial prey diet fractions. Although the δ34S value for salmon is precise and appears general among species and areas, sulfur ratios were strongly correlated with nitrogen ratios and therefore added little new information to the mixing model regarding the consumption of salmon. Mean δ34S values for the three terrestrial herbivores of interest were similar and imprecise, so these data also added little new information to the mixing model. The addition of sulfur data did confirm that at least some bears in this system ate marmots during summer and fall. We show that there are bears with short hair that assimilate >20% salmon in their diet and bears with longer hair that eat no salmon living within a few kilometers of one another in a coastal ecosystem. Grizzly bears are thought to re-grow hair between June and October however our analysis of sectioned hair suggested at least some hairs begin growing in July or August, not June and, that hair of wild bears may grow faster than observed in captive bears. Our hair samples may have been from the year of sampling or the previous year because samples were collected in summer when bears were growing new hair. The salmon diet fraction increased with later hair collection dates, as expected if samples were from the year of sampling because salmon began to arrive in mid-summer. Bears that ate salmon had shorter hair and δ15N and δ34S values declined with hair length, also suggesting some hair samples were grown the year of sampling. To be sure to capture an entire hair growth period, samples must be collected in late fall. Early spring samples are also likely to be from the previous year but the date when hair begins to grow appears to vary. Choosing the longest hair available should increase the chance the hair was grown during the previous year and, maximize the period for which diet is measured."

Understanding the impact of spaceflight factors, microgravity in particular, on cellular responses to DNA damage is essential for assessing the radiation risk for astronauts and the mutation rate in microorganisms. In a study conducted on the International Space Station, confluent human fibroblasts in culture were treated with bleomycin for three hours in the true microgravity environment. The degree of DNA damage was quantified by immunofluorescence staining for γ-H2AX, which is manifested in three types of staining patterns. Although similar percentages of these types of patterns were found between flight and ground cells, there was a slight shift in the distribution of foci counts in the flown cells with countable numbers of γ-H2AX foci. Comparison of the cells in confluent and in exponential growth conditions indicated that the proliferation rate between flight and the ground may be responsible for such a shift. We also performed a microarray analysis of gene expressions in response to bleomycin treatment. A qualitative comparison of the responsive pathways between the flown and ground cells showed similar responses with the p53 network being the top upstream regulator. The microarray data was confirmed with a PCR array analysis containing a set of genes involved in DNA damage signaling; with BBC3, CDKN1A, PCNA and PPM1D being significantly upregulated in both flight and ground cells after bleomycin treatment. Our results suggest that whether microgravity affects DNA damage response in space can be dependent on the cell type and cell growth condition."

Here, we carried out a comparative analysis of computationally predicted protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks from five closely related yeast species. We used the Protein-protein Interaction Prediction Engine (PIPE), which uses a database of known interactions to make sequence-based PPI predictions, to generate high quality predicted interactomes. Simulated proteomes and corresponding PPI networks were used to provide null expectations for the extent and nature of PPI network evolution. We found strong evidence for conservation of PPIs, with lower than expected levels of change in PPIs for about a quarter of the proteome. Furthermore, we found that changes in predicted PPI networks are poorly predicted by sequence divergence. Our analyses identified a number of functional classes experiencing fewer PPI changes than expected, suggestive of purifying selection on PPIs. Our results demonstrate the added benefit of considering predicted PPI networks when studying the evolution of closely related organisms."

Fibrin-based matrices (derived from human plasma or plasma cryoprecipitate) were used as scaffolds, and primary cells were obtained from conjunctival tissue. Conjunctival constructs were analyzed by immunofluorescent staining and scanning electron microscopy and cell proliferation was measured with alamarBlue® assay. After characterizing the constructs, four different experimental conditions were analyzed in cryoprecipitate matrices: controls, air-lifted cultures (to increase cell stratification), partially desiccated cultures (to mimic dry eye disease), and IL-13-treated cultures (to mimic allergy). Constructs were stained with hematoxylin/eosin to observe changes in morphology. High molecular weight glycoconjugates were identified by HPA staining. MUC5AC and IL-6 secretion was evaluated by ELISA. The fibrin-based matrices supported conjunctival cell growth. Epithelial cells grew on the surface of the scaffolds and underwent stratification that increased over time. These cells had microvilli, which suggests cell polarization and functionality. Fibroblasts were integrated in the scaffold and showed elongated shape. Compared to controls, air-lifted construct had increased epithelial stratification and upregulated MUC5AC secretion. Increased MUC5AC secretion also occurred in partially desiccated and IL-13-treated cultures. The inflammatory status of cells was evaluated by IL-6 levels which were increased in air-lifted and partially desiccated cultures, but not in IL-13-treated ones. In conclusion, we have developed a new three-dimensional model of human conjunctiva that can be used to study ocular surface inflammatory diseases."

Upon successful penetration of an insect host, the nematode regurgitates Photorhabdus into the insect circulatory fluid (hemocoel). The bacteria replicate and produce immunosuppressants to commandeer the insect's innate immune system, insecticidals to aid in killing the insect, nematode development signals to promote Heterorhabditis to recover from its IJ developmental stage, and diverse antimicrobials to protect the newly acquired food source. The insects ultimately die by septicemia, whereas the nematodes prosper from feeding on the resulting Photorhabdus biomass.

Because of the multiple host-bacteria and microbe-bacteria interactions that occur during the multilateral symbiosis, the Photorhabdus genus has emerged as a rich source of biologically active small molecules (5.Bode H.B.

Some of these pathways have been characterized. For example, Photorhabdus produces a variety of anthraquinone and indigoidine pigments (7.Brachmann A.O. Joyce S.A. Jenke-Kodama H. Schwär G.

Photorhabdus produces a spectrum of cytotoxic peptides, such as kolossin from a giant non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (14.Bode H.B. Brachmann A.O. Jadhav K.B. Seyfarth L. Dauth C. Fuchs S.W.

Stilbenes fall within the polyketide-phenylpropanoid class of natural products and are commonly found in plants. However, the first discovery of bacterial stilbenes, such as 3,5-dihydroxy-4-isopropyl-trans-stilbene (compound 1), was from Photorhabdus, representing a rarely reported chemical trait in bacteria (8.Richardson W.H.

The metabolite has been shown to have moderate inhibitory activity against phenoloxidase (18.Eleftherianos I. Boundy S. Joyce S.A. Aslam S. Marshall J.W. Cox R.J. Simpson T.J.

U.S.A. 2007; 104: 2419-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Stilbene 1 also contributes to the bacterial “food signal,” an interkingdom-signaling pathway that contributes to the developmental recovery of the IJ stage of the nematode (21.Joyce S.A. Brachmann A.O. Glazer I. Lango L. Schwär G. Clarke D.J. Bode H.B. Bacterial biosynthesis of a multipotent stilbene.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2008; 47: 1942-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). More recently, a downstream stilbene metabolite derived from the epoxidation of 1, 2-isopropyl-5-(3-phenyl-oxiranyl)-benzene-1,3-diol (2), has been elucidated from greater waxmoth larvae (Galleria mellonella) infected by the Heterorhabditis-Photorhabdus pair (19.Hu K. Li J. Li B. Webster J.M. Chen G. A novel antimicrobial epoxide isolated from larval Galleria mellonella infected by the nematode symbiont, Photorhabdus luminescens (Enterobacteriaceae).Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2006; 14: 4677-4681Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The metabolite was confirmed by synthesis, but its absolute configuration remained undefined. This stilbene epoxide also exhibited significant antimicrobial activities against a panel of microbes (19.Hu K. Li J. Li B. Webster J.M. Chen G. A novel antimicrobial epoxide isolated from larval Galleria mellonella infected by the nematode symbiont, Photorhabdus luminescens (Enterobacteriaceae).Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2006; 14: 4677-4681Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In this study, we characterized Plu2236, an orphan FAD-dependent monooxygenase (FMO), by X-ray crystallography, which revealed an overall fold common to FMOs with a tightly bound FAD prosthetic group. Through bacterial genetics (Δplu2236) and in vitro biochemical reconstitution of Plu2236, we show that this enzyme is a stilbene epoxidase and is required to stereoselectively convert 1 to 2. By defining this enzymatic stilbene epoxidation process, we were able to further examine the developmental and biological effects of the P. luminescens stilbene epoxide in two animal models, nematode IJ recovery (H. bacteriophora) and insect pathogenicity (G. mellonella). In the invertebrate animal infection model, we observed two new stilbene-derived metabolites that were dependent on the epoxidase. Characterization of these metabolites led to new stilbene-l-proline conjugates, prolbenes A (3) and B (4), and the completion of the absolute configurational assignment of stilbene epoxide (2). l-Proline is one of the dominant amino acids in the insect circulatory fluid and represents a nutrient signal in P. luminescens that stimulates the production of select secondary metabolic pathways in the bacterium (10.Crawford J.M. Kontnik R. Clardy J. Regulating alternative lifestyles in entomopathogenic bacteria.Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 69-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The chemical features of the circulatory fluid and the electrophilicity of the stilbene epoxide promote l-proline functionalization and, correspondingly, attenuation of the stilbene epoxide antimicrobial activities. Finally, we show that stilbene epoxidation reduces bacterial host cytotoxicity and likely contributes to an enzymatic stilbene detoxification strategy in P. luminescens. The crystal structure of an orphan FMO from P. luminescens TT01 was determined in the trigonal P3221 space group with one molecule in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 1A and Table 1). Analysis of the crystal structure using PISA (28.Krissinel E. Henrick K. Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6801) Google Scholar) does not suggest any stable multimeric assembly of the P. luminescens FMO (PlFMO). The structure of the FMO reveals a typical two domain fold (29.Eswaramoorthy S. Bonanno J.B. Burley S.K. Swaminathan S. Mechanism of action of a flavin-containing monooxygenase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The NADP-binding domain (residues 76–89 and 178–300) contains a seven-stranded β-sheet packed against three helices. The larger FAD-binding domain consists of a four-stranded parallel β-sheet packed between a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and a group of six α-helices. A Rossmann fold, common to the nucleotide-binding proteins, made up of the β1-α1-β2 motif containing the characteristic GXGXXG sequence is present at the N terminus of the FAD-binding domain. In PlFMO, this sequence corresponds to GAGIGG between residues 7 and 12 (Fig. 1C; supplemental Fig. S1). The tightly bound prosthetic group FAD is well defined in the electron density maps (Fig. 1B) and makes extensive interactions with PlFMO, including 18 hydrogen bonds (Fig. 1C). A search for structural homologs of PlFMO identified Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron TetX (BtTetX) among others with a z-score of 35.6 (30.Volkers G. Palm G.J. Weiss M.S. Wright G.D. Hinrichs W.

A structural superposition of BtTetX onto PlFMO reveals a well conserved fold (Fig. 1D; supplemental Fig. S1) with a root mean-square-deviation of 3.0 Å over 345 Cα atomic pairs despite low sequence identity of 23%. Also, the FAD of PlFMO is bound in the IN conformation, where isoalloxazine and adenine rings are distal to each other, as observed in the case of BtTetX (30.Volkers G. Palm G.J. Weiss M.S.

Open table in a new tab The protein sequence and X-ray structure of Plu2236 support an undefined monooxygenation reaction. To determine the specific function(s) of this orphan FMO, we cleanly deleted plu2236 in wild type P. luminescens TT01 using allelic-exchange mutagenesis. LC/MS comparisons of organic extracts from liquid cultures of wild type and Δplu2236 strains, along with organic extracts from insect larvae infected by these bacteria, revealed that the production of a major peak (m/z [M + H]+ = 271) was completely abrogated in the mutant strain relative to the wild type strain (Fig. 2, A and B). The UV-visible, mass spectral, and chromatographic properties of this peak were consistent with stilbene epoxide (2) (Fig. 2C). The planar structure of 2 from P. luminescens was first reported as an antimicrobial metabolite from an insect model infected by the nematode carrying P. luminescens (19.Hu K. Li J. Li B. Webster J.M. Chen G. A novel antimicrobial epoxide isolated from larval Galleria mellonella infected by the nematode symbiont, Photorhabdus luminescens (Enterobacteriaceae).Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2006; 14: 4677-4681Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We isolated this peak from a larger-scale wild type culture, and NMR analysis confirmed the planar structural assignment (supplemental Fig. S2). We also isolated and confirmed the structure of its precursor stilbene (1, m/z [M + H]+ = 255) by NMR from the wild type culture (Fig. 2C; supplemental Fig. S3) (23.Park H.B. Crawford J.M. Lumiquinone A, an α-aminomalonate-derived aminobenzoquinone from Photorhabdus luminescens.J. Nat. Prod. 2015; 78: 1437-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Stilbene 1 represents the observed epoxidase substrate, and as expected, it accumulates in the plu2236 mutant strain (Fig. 2A). These experiments demonstrate that Plu2236 is an FAD-dependent stilbene epoxidase responsible for converting 1 to 2. The stilbene biosynthetic gene “cluster” in P. luminescens is genomically fragmented, with mini-gene clusters localized to at least four distinct regions of the genome (21.Joyce S.A. Brachmann A.O. Glazer I. Lango L. Schwär G. Clarke D.J. Bode H.B. Bacterial biosynthesis of a multipotent stilbene.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2008; 47: 1942-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The stilbene epoxidase gene (plu2236) is adjacent to stlA (plu2234), a phenylalanine ammonia lyase that converts phenylalanine to cinnamic acid, initiating phenylpropanoid/stilbene biosynthesis. To support the function of PlFMO in a cell-free system, we overexpressed and purified N-terminal His6-tagged Plu2236 (supplemental Fig. S4). In vitro protein biochemical experiments were conducted using 200 μm isolated stilbene substrate 1, 100 μm NADH or NADPH, and 5 μm of the FAD-containing enzyme (Fig. 3A). After 30 min, the reaction mixtures were extracted with an equal volume of ethyl acetate; the organic fraction was dried, and the products were analyzed by high-resolution ESI-QTOF-MS. Extracted ion chromatogram analyses of the in vitro reactions showed conversion of stilbene substrate 1 to stilbene epoxide 2 in the presence of supplemented NADPH or NADH (Fig. 3, B and C). NADPH was preferred over NADH. These in vitro protein biochemical experiments demonstrate that PlFMO is necessary and sufficient for the stereoselective epoxidation reaction. To assess stilbene production in the animal model, we first analyzed organic extracts from wild type P. luminescens TT01 in a waxmoth larval (G. mellonella) infection model compared with non-infected control larvae. Larvae were frozen, ground, and extracted over a time course (6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h) using several organic solvents, including n-hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol. C18-reversed-phase LC/MS analysis demonstrated that stilbene (1, tR = 23.5 min) and stilbene epoxide (2, tR = 22.5 min) could readily be detected in the ethyl acetate extracts of Photorhabdus-infected larvae (supplemental Fig. S5). The stilbenes were detectable after 24 h and were maximally observed at 48 h in the time-dependent analysis (Fig. 4B, inset). During the course of this analysis, we observed the production of two additional distinct peaks (tR = 14.2 and 15.3 min) that were dependent on the stilbene epoxidase and shared similar production characteristics as the stilbenes (Fig. 4). However, these additional peaks exhibited similar UV-visible spectra (λmax 210 nm) that were distinct from the stilbenes and consistent with strong phenyl chromophores (supplemental Fig. S6). High-resolution ESI-QTOF-MS data analysis suggested that these molecules were novel stilbene-derived isomers with the chemical formula C22H27NO5 (supplemental Fig. S7). To isolate the new stilbene-derived metabolites detected in the invertebrate animal infection model, we cultivated wild type P. luminescens in a hemolymph mimetic medium (HMM) that is based on the concentrations of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids present in G. mellonella circulatory fluid (10.Crawford J.M.

Pyrazinone protease inhibitor metabolites from Photorhabdus luminescens.J. Antibiot. 2016; 69: 616-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Ethyl acetate extracts from initial 5-ml cultures were monitored by LC/MS, and the unknown target peaks were successfully produced under the P. luminescens culture conditions (supplemental Fig. S8). A subsequent 16 liters of HMM culture was initiated, and after 48 h of aerobic cultivation at 30 °C, the cleared supernatant was extracted twice with equal portions of ethyl acetate (32 liters total), yielding 2.3 g of crude material. Multiple reversed-phase HPLC fractionations of the organic materials allowed us to homogeneously isolate the two molecules, 3 (tR = 18.9 min, 1.5 mg) and 4 (tR = 20.5 min, 1.8 mg). Their planar chemical structures were proposed based on the interpretation of their 1D and 2D NMR (gCOSY, gHSQC, and gHMBC) spectra (supplemental Figs. S9–S16). Compound (3) was isolated as an amorphous solid with the molecular formula C22H27NO5 based on its HR-ESI-QTOF-MS spectrum (observed [M + H]+ at m/z 386.1964; calculated 386.1967) (Fig. 5C). Analysis of the 1H NMR spectral data (Table 2; supplemental Fig. S9) suggested the presence of two separate spin systems, including an isopropyl stilbene scaffold and a proline group, which was consistent with the COSY NMR spectral data (Fig. 5A; supplemental Fig. S10). COSY cross-peaks from H-10/H-14 (2H, δH 7.59, m) to H-12 (1H, δH 7.16, t, J = 7.2 Hz), and from a methine H-15 (1H, δH 4.23, m) to the two methyl groups H-16 and H-17 indicated the presence of a mono-substituted benzene ring and an isopropyl group, r"
https://openalex.org/W2593679046,"Moderate physical activity can be experienced by some as pleasurable and by others as discouraging. This may be why many people lack sufficient motivation to participate in the recommended 150 minutes of moderately intense exercise per week. In the present study, we assessed how pleasure and enjoyment were modulated differently by one's tolerance to self-paced physical activity. Sixty-three healthy individuals were allocated to three independent experimental conditions: a resting condition (watching TV), a cycling in silence condition, and a cycling in music condition. The tolerance threshold was assessed using the PRETIE-Questionnaire. Physical activity consisted in cycling during 30 minutes, at an intensity perceived as ""somewhat difficult"" on the Ratings of Perceived Exertion Scale. While controlling for self-reported physical activity level, results revealed that for the same perception of exertion and a similar level of enjoyment, the High Tolerance group produced more power output than the Low Tolerance group. There was a positive effect of music for High Tolerant individuals only, with music inducing greater power output and more pleasure. There was an effect of music on heart rate frequency in the Low Tolerant individuals without benefits in power output or pleasure. Our results suggest that for Low Tolerant individuals, energizing environments can interfere with the promised (positive) distracting effects of music. Hence, tolerance to physical effort must be taken into account to conceive training sessions that seek to use distracting methods as means to sustain pleasurable exercising over time."
https://openalex.org/W2591575507,"Lung cancer is one of the most common malignancies with a high rate of mortality. Lung cancer stem-like cells (CSCs)/ cancer-initiating cells (CICs) play major role in resistance to treatments, recurrence and distant metastasis and eradication of CSCs/CICs is crucial to improve recent therapy. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are major effectors of cancer immunotherapy, and CTLs recognize antigenic peptides derived from antigens that are presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. In this study, we analyzed the potency of a cancer-testis (CT) antigen, brother of the regulator of the imprinted site variant subfamily 6 (BORIS sf6), in lung CSC/CIC immunotherapy. BORIS sf6 mRNA was expressed in lung carcinoma cells (9/19), especially in sphere-cultured lung cancer stem-like cells, and in primary lung carcinoma tissues (4/9) by RT-PCR. Immunohistochemical staining using BORIS sf6-specific antibody revealed that high expression of BORIS sf6 is related to poorer prognosis. CTLs could be induced by using a human leukocyte antigen, (HLA)-A2 restricted antigenic peptide (BORIS C34_24(9)), from all of 3 HLA-A2-positive individuals, and CTL clone cells specific for BORIS C34_24(9) peptide could recognize BORIS sf6-positive, HLA-A2-positive lung carcinoma cells. These results indicate that BORIS sf6 is a novel target of lung cancer immunotherapy that might be useful for targeting treatment-resistant lung cancer stem-like cells."
https://openalex.org/W2594572376,"Polyalanine (poly(A)) diseases are caused by the expansion of translated GCN triplet nucleotide sequences encoding poly(A) tracts in proteins. To date, nine human disorders have been found to be associated with poly(A) tract expansions, including congenital central hypoventilation syndrome and oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy. Previous studies have demonstrated that unexpanded wild-type poly(A)-containing proteins localize to the cell nucleus, whereas expanded poly(A)-containing proteins primarily localize to the cytoplasm. Because most of these poly(A) disease proteins are transcription factors, this mislocalization causes cellular transcriptional dysregulation leading to cellular dysfunction. Correcting this faulty localization could potentially point to strategies to treat the aforementioned disorders, so there is a pressing need to identify the mechanisms underlying the mislocalization of expanded poly(A) protein. Here, we performed a glutathione S-transferase pulldown assay followed by mass spectrometry and identified eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 α1 (eEF1A1) as an interacting partner with expanded poly(A)-containing proteins. Strikingly, knockdown of eEF1A1 expression partially corrected the mislocalization of the expanded poly(A) proteins in the cytoplasm and restored their functions in the nucleus. We further demonstrated that the expanded poly(A) domain itself can serve as a nuclear export signal. Taken together, this study demonstrates that eEF1A1 regulates the subcellular location of expanded poly(A) proteins and is therefore a potential therapeutic target for combating the pathogenesis of poly(A) diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2592330990,"The molecular mechanism of stress-induced hepatic steatosis is not well known. Human leucine zipper protein (LZIP) regulates the expression of genes involved in inflammation, cell migration, and stress response. The aim of this study was to determine the regulatory role of LZIP in stress-induced hepatic steatosis. We used a microarray analysis to identify LZIP-induced genes involved in hepatic lipid metabolism. LZIP increased the expression of apolipoprotein A-IV (APOA4) mRNA. In the presence of stress inducer, APOA4 promoter analysis was performed, and LZIP-induced lipid accumulation was monitored in mouse primary cells and human tissues. Under Golgi stress conditions, LZIP underwent proteolytic cleavage and was phosphorylated by AKT to protect against proteasome degradation. The stabilized N-terminal LZIP was translocated to the nucleus, where it directly bound to the APOA4 promoter, leading to APOA4 induction. LZIP-induced APOA4 expression resulted in increased absorption of surrounding free fatty acids. LZIP also promoted hepatic steatosis in mouse liver. Both LZIP and APOA4 were highly expressed in human steatosis samples. Our findings indicate that LZIP is a novel modulator of APOA4 expression and hepatic lipid metabolism. LZIP might be a therapeutic target for developing treatment strategies for hepatic steatosis and related metabolic diseases.—Kang, M., Kim, J., An, H.-T., Ko, J.

https://openalex.org/W2593069390,"Purpose Unambiguous evaluation of glioblastoma (GB) progression is crucial, both for clinical trials as well as day by day routine management of GB patients. 3D-volumetry in the follow-up of GB provides quantitative data on tumor extent and growth, and therefore has the potential to facilitate objective disease assessment. The present study investigated the utility of absolute changes in volume (delta) or regional, segmentation-based subtractions for detecting disease progression in longitudinal MRI follow-ups. Methods 165 high resolution 3-Tesla MRIs of 30 GB patients (23m, mean age 60.2y) were retrospectively included in this single center study. Contrast enhancement (CV) and tumor-related signal alterations in FLAIR images (FV) were semi-automatically segmented. Delta volume (dCV, dFV) and regional subtractions (sCV, sFV) were calculated. Disease progression was classified for every follow-up according to histopathologic results, decisions of the local multidisciplinary CNS tumor board and a consensus rating of the neuro-radiologic report. Results A generalized logistic mixed model for disease progression (yes / no) with dCV, dFV, sCV and sFV as input variables revealed that only dCV was significantly associated with prediction of disease progression (P = .005). Delta volume had a better accuracy than regional, segmentation-based subtractions (79% versus 72%) and a higher area under the curve by trend in ROC curves (.83 versus .75). Conclusion Absolute volume changes of the contrast enhancing tumor part were the most accurate volumetric determinant to detect progressive disease in assessment of GB and outweighed FLAIR changes as well as regional, segmentation-based image subtractions. This parameter might be useful in upcoming objective response criteria for glioblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W2593993727,"Burkholderia cenocepacia is an opportunistic pathogen responsible for life-threatening infections in cystic fibrosis patients. B. cenocepacia is extremely resistant towards antibiotics and therapy is complicated by its ability to form biofilms. We investigated the efficacy of an alternative antimicrobial strategy for B. cenocepacia lung infections using in vitro and in vivo models. A screening of the NIH Clinical Collection 1&2 was performed against B. cenocepacia biofilms formed in 96-well microtiter plates in the presence of tobramycin to identify repurposing candidates with potentiator activity. The efficacy of selected hits was evaluated in a three-dimensional (3D) organotypic human lung epithelial cell culture model. The in vivo effect was evaluated in the invertebrate Galleria mellonella and in a murine B. cenocepacia lung infection model. The screening resulted in 60 hits that potentiated the activity of tobramycin against B. cenocepacia biofilms, including four imidazoles of which econazole and miconazole were selected for further investigation. However, a potentiator effect was not observed in the 3D organotypic human lung epithelial cell culture model. Combination treatment was also not able to increase survival of infected G. mellonella. Also in mice, there was no added value for the combination treatment. Although potentiators of tobramycin with activity against biofilms of B. cenocepacia were identified in a repurposing screen, the in vitro activity could not be confirmed nor in a more sophisticated in vitro model, neither in vivo. This stresses the importance of validating hits resulting from in vitro studies in physiologically relevant model systems."
https://openalex.org/W2594600324,"The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between the body mass index (BMI) at a breast cancer diagnosis and various factors including the hormone-receptor, menopause, and lymph-node status, and identify if there is a specific patient subgroup for which the BMI has an effect on the breast cancer prognosis. We retrospectively analyzed the data of 8,742 patients with non-metastatic invasive breast cancer from the research database of Asan Medical Center. The overall survival (OS) and breast-cancer-specific survival (BCSS) outcomes were compared among BMI groups using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional-hazards regression models with an interaction term. There was a significant interaction between BMI and hormone-receptor status for the OS (P = 0.029), and BCSS (P = 0.013) in lymph-node-positive breast cancers. Obesity in hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer showed a poorer OS (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.92 to 2.48) and significantly poorer BCSS (HR = 1.80, 95% CI = 1.08 to 2.99). In contrast, a high BMI in hormone-receptor-negative breast cancer revealed a better OS (HR = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.16 to 1.19) and BCSS (HR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.19 to 1.44). Being underweight (BMI < 18.50 kg/m2) with hormone-receptor-negative breast cancer was associated with a significantly worse OS (HR = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.00–3.95) and BCSS (HR = 2.24, 95% CI = 1.12–4.47). There was no significant interaction found between the BMI and hormone-receptor status in the lymph-node-negative setting, and BMI did not interact with the menopause status in any subgroup. In conclusion, BMI interacts with the hormone-receptor status in a lymph-node-positive setting, thereby playing a role in the prognosis of breast cancer."

Second, we examined the effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 on inflammatory cytokine secretion or fibrosis in HRPTEpiC induced by inflammatory cytokines or activated CD4+ T cells using ELISA and real-time PCR. Lastly, we compared urine inflammatory-cytokine (IL-6, IL-8) or KIM-1 levels in kidney transplant recipients low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) group (< 20 ng/mL) (n = 40) and normal 25(OH)D group (n = 50).Pre-incubation with 1,25(OH)2D3 significantly reduced the percentages of Th1 and Th17 cells compared to that of Th0 condition (P < 0.05 for each). In contrast, 1,25(OH)2D3 increased the proportion of Th2 and Treg cells in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05 for each). Treatment of HRPTEpiC with inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-17, and TGF-β) or effector CD4+ T cells resulted in increased production of IL-6, IL-8, or KIM-1 from HRPTEpiC in a dose-dependent manner. However, treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 significantly reduced the level of these cytokines (P < 0.05 for all). Western blot analysis demonstrated that the mTOR/STAT3/ERK pathway was downregulated by 1,25(OH)2D3 in HRPTEpiC. Furthermore, the concentrations of urine IL-6/creatinine (P < 0.05) and Kim-1/creatinine (P < 0.05) were higher in the low 25(OH)D group than in the normal 25(OH)D group in kidney transplant recipients.The results of this study suggests that vitamin D may have a significant role in the regulation of inflammation in allograft tissue in kidney transplant recipients.All participants provided written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

https://openalex.org/W2592622639,"In humans, umami taste can increase the palatability of foods rich in the amino acids glutamate and aspartate and the 5'-ribonucleotides IMP and GMP. Umami taste is transduced, in part, by T1R1-T1R3, a heteromeric G-protein coupled receptor. Umami perception is inhibited by sodium lactisole, which binds to the T1R3 subunit in vitro. Lactisole is structurally similar to the fibrate drugs. Clofibric acid, a lipid lowering drug, also binds the T1R3 subunit in vitro. The purpose of this study was to determine whether clofibric acid inhibits the umami taste of glutamate in human subjects. Ten participants rated the umami taste intensity elicited by 20 mM monosodium glutamate (MSG) mixed with varying concentrations of clofibric acid (0 to 16 mM). In addition, fourteen participants rated the effect of 1.4 mM clofibric acid on umami enhancement by 5' ribonucleotides. Participants were instructed to rate perceived intensity using a general Labeled Magnitude Scale (gLMS). Each participant was tested in triplicate. Clofibric acid inhibited umami taste intensity from 20 mM MSG in a dose dependent manner. Whereas MSG neat elicited ""moderate"" umami taste intensity, the addition of 16 mM clofibric acid elicited only ""weak"" umami intensity on average, and in some subjects no umami taste was elicited. We further show that 1.4 mM clofibric acid suppressed umami enhancement from GMP, but not from IMP. This study provides in vivo evidence that clofibric acid inhibits glutamate taste perception, presumably via T1R1-T1R3 inhibition, and lends further evidence that the T1R1-T1R3 receptor is the principal umami receptor in humans. T1R receptors are expressed extra-orally throughout the alimentary tract and in regulatory organs and are known to influence glucose and lipid metabolism. Whether clofibric acid as a lipid-lowering drug affects human metabolism, in part, through T1R inhibition warrants further examination."
https://openalex.org/W2592763526,"Wadi El-Hitan, the UNESCO World Heritage Site, of the Fayum Depression in the northeast part of the Western Desert of Egypt, has produced a remarkable collection of Eocene vertebrates, in particular the fossil whales from which it derives its name. Here we describe a new genus and species of marine catfishes (Siluriformes; Ariidae), Qarmoutus hitanensis, from the base of the upper Eocene Birket Qarun Formation, based on a partial neurocranium including the complete left side, partial right dentary, left suspensorium, two opercles, left pectoral girdle and spine, nuchal plates, first and second dorsal spines, Weberian apparatus and a disassociated series of abdominal vertebrae. All of the elements belong to the same individual and some of them were found articulated. Qarmoutus gen. nov. is the oldest and the most complete of the Paleogene marine catfishes unearthed from the Birket Qarun Formation. The new genus exhibits distinctive features not seen in other African Paleogene taxa, such as different sculpturing on the opercle and pectoral girdle with respect to that on the neurocranium and nuchal plates, denticulate ornamentation on the skull bones arranged in longitudinal rows and forming a radiating pattern on the sphenotic, pterotic, extrascapular and the parieto-supraoccipital, indentations or pitted ornamentation on the nuchal plates as well as the parieto-supraoccipital process, strut-like radiating pattern of ornamentation on the opercle from the proximal articulation to margins, longitudinal, curved, reticulate ridges and tubercular ornamentations on the cleithrum, sinuous articulation between the parieto-supraoccipital process and the anterior nuchal plate, long, narrow, and arrowhead shaped nuchal shield, very small otic capsules restricted to the prootic. Multiple parsimony and Bayesian morphological phylogenetic analyses of Ariidae, run with and without “molecular scaffolds”, yield contradictory results for the placement of Qarmoutus; the genus is either a phylogenetically basal ariid, or it is deeply nested within the ariid clade containing New World species of Sciades."
https://openalex.org/W2594069880,"Background/Objectives The supine sagittal abdominal diameter (SAD) and standing waist circumference (WC) describe abdominal size. The SAD/height ratio (SADHtR) or WC/height ratio (WHtR) may better identify cardiometabolic disorders than BMI (weight/height2), but population-based distributions of SADHtR and WHtR are not widely available. Abdominal adiposity may differ by sociodemographic characteristics. Subjects/Methods Anthropometry, including SAD by sliding-beam caliper, was performed on 9894 non-pregnant adults ≥20 years in the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys of 2011–2014. Applying survey design factors and sampling weights, we estimated nationally representative SADHtR and WHtR distributions by sex, age, educational attainment, and four ancestral groups. Results The median (10th percentile, 90th percentile) for men’s SADHtR was 0.130 (0.103, 0.165) and WHtR 0.569 (0.467, 0.690). For women, median SADHtR was 0.132 (0.102, 0.175) and WHtR 0.586 (0.473, 0.738). Medians for SADHtR and WHtR increased steadily through age 79. The median BMI, however, reached maximum values at ages 40–49 (men) or 60–69 (women) and then declined. Low educational attainment, adjusted for age and ancestry, was associated with elevated SADHtR more strongly than elevated BMI. While non-Hispanic Asians had substantially lower BMI compared to all other ancestral groups (adjusted for sex, age and education), their relative reductions in SADHtR and WHtR, were less marked. Conclusions These cross-sectional data are consistent with monotonically increasing abdominal adipose tissue through the years of adulthood but decreasing mass in non-abdominal regions beyond middle age. They suggest also that visceral adipose tissue, estimated by SADHtR, expands differentially in association with low socioeconomic position. Insofar as Asians have lower BMIs than other populations, employing abdominal indicators may attenuate the adiposity differences reported between ancestral groups. Documenting the distribution and sociodemographic features of SADHtR and WHtR supports the clinical and epidemiologic adoption of these adiposity indicators."

The absence of molecular information about this insect reinforces the need for studies and an effective method to control this pest. In this study, RNA-Seq technology was employed to study different parts of M. fryanus larvae. The generated data will help in further investigations about the taxonomy, development, and adaptation of this insect. RNA was extracted from six different parts (head, fat body, integument, hindgut, midgut, and foregut) using Trizol methodology. Using Illumina paired-end sequencing technology and the Trinity platform, trimming and de novo assembly was performed, resulting in 44,567 contigs longer than 200 nt for a reunion of data from all transcriptomes, with a mean length of 1,095.27 nt. Transcripts were annotated using BLAST against different protein databanks (Uniprot/Swissprot, PFAM, KEEG, SignalP 4.1, Gene Ontology, and CAZY) and were compared for similarity using a Venn diagram. Differential expression patterns were studied for select genes through qPCR and FPKM comprising important protein families (digestive peptidases, glucosyl hydrolases, serine protease inhibitors and otopetrin), which allowed a better understanding of the insect's digestion, immunity and gravity sensorial mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2594697816,"BET proteins (BRD2, BRD3, BRDT and BRD4) belong to the family of bromodomain containing proteins, which form a class of transcriptional co-regulators. BET proteins bind to acetylated lysine residues in the histones of nucleosomal chromatin and function either as co-activators or co-repressors of gene expression. An imbalance between HAT and HDAC activities resulting in hyperacetylation of histones has been identified in COPD. We hypothesized that pan-BET inhibitor (JQ1) treatment of BET protein interactions with hyperacetylated sites in the chromatin will regulate excessive activation of pro-inflammatory genes in key inflammatory drivers of alveolar macrophages (AM) in COPD.Transcriptome analysis of AM from COPD patients indicated up-regulation of macrophage M1 type genes upon LPS stimulation. Pan-BET inhibitor JQ1 treatment attenuated expression of multiple genes, including pro-inflammatory cytokines and regulators of innate and adaptive immune cells. We demonstrated for the first time that JQ1 differentially modulated LPS-induced cytokine release from AM or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of COPD patients compared to PBMC of healthy controls. Using the BET regulated gene signature, we identified a subset of COPD patients, which we propose to benefit from BET inhibition.This work demonstrates that the effects of pan-BET inhibition through JQ1 treatment of inflammatory cells differs between COPD patients and healthy controls, and the expression of BET protein regulated genes is altered in COPD. These findings provide evidence of histone hyperacetylation as a mechanism driving chronic inflammatory changes in COPD."

This ocular autoimmune disorder is mainly mediated by T CD4+ lymphocytes poising a TH1 phenotype. Costimulatory molecules are known to play an important role on T cell activation and therefore represent interesting therapeutical targets for autoimmune disorders. CD28 is the prototypical costimulatory molecule for T lymphocytes, and plays a crucial role in the initiation, and maintenance of immune responses. However, previous attempts to use this molecule in clinical practice achieved no success. Thus, we evaluated the efficacy of mPEG PV1-Fab' (PV1), a novel selective CD28 antagonist monovalent Fab fragment in the treatment of Experimental Autoimmune Uveitis (EAU). Here, we showed that PV1 treatment decreases both average disease score and incidence of EAU. A decrease in the activation profile of both T CD4+ and T CD8+ eye-infiltrating lymphocytes was evidenced. In the periphery, T CD4+ cells from PV1-treated mice also showed a decrease in their activation status, with reduced expression of CD69, CD25, and PD-1 molecules. This suppression was not dependent on Treg cells, as both their frequency and absolute number were lower in PV1-treated mice. In addition, frequency of CD4+IFN-γ+ T cells was significantly lower in PV1-treated group, but not of IL-17-producing T cells. Moreover, after specific restimulation, PV1 blockade selectively blocked IFN-γ production by CD4+ lymphocytes Taken together, our data suggest that mPEG PV1-Fab' acts mainly on IFN-γ-producing CD4+ T cells and emphasize that this specific CD28 blockade strategy is a potential specific and alternative tool for the treatment of autoimmune disorders in the eye."

However, the importance of Gly-221 for HABP2 activity is unclear. Here, we used G221E, G221A, and G221S mutants to assess the role of Gly-221 in HABP2 catalysis. The G221E variant failed to activate the single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator, and the G221A and G221S variants displayed moderately reduced single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator activation.

https://openalex.org/W2499683052,"Many communities in the Midwestern United States obtain their drinking water from shallow alluvial wells that are vulnerable to contamination by NO3-N from the surrounding agricultural landscape. The objective of this research was to assess cropping systems with the potential to produce a reasonable return for farmers while simultaneously reducing the risk of NO3-N movement into these shallow aquifers. From 2009 to 2013 we conducted a field experiment in northwest Iowa in which we evaluated five cropping systems for residual (late fall) soil NO3-N content and profitability. Soil samples were taken annually from the top 30 cm of the soil profile in June and August, and from the top 180 cm in November (late fall). The November samples were divided into 30 cm increments for analysis. Average residual NO3-N content in the top 180 cm of the soil profile following the 2010 to 2013 cropping years was 134 kg ha-1 for continuous maize (Zea mays L.) with a cereal rye (Secale cereale L.) cover crop, 18 kg ha-1 for perennial grass, 60 kg ha-1 for a three year oat (Avena sativa L.)-alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.)-maize rotation, 85 kg ha-1 for a two year oat/red clover (Trifolium pratense L.)-maize rotation, and 90 kg ha-1 for a three year soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.)-winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-maize rotation. However, residual NO3-N in the 90 to 180 cm increment of the soil profile was not significantly higher in the oat-alfalfa-maize cropping system than the perennial grass system. For 2010 to 2013, average profit ($ ha-1 yr-1) was 531 for continuous corn, 347 for soybean-winter wheat-maize, 264 for oat-alfalfa-maize, 140 for oat/red clover-maize, and -384 (loss) for perennial grass. Considering both residual soil NO3-N and profitability data, the oat-alfalfa-maize rotation performed the best in this setting. However, given current economic pressures widespread adoption is likely to require changes in public policy."

The ubiquitous TGM2 has well described enzymatic and non-enzymatic functions but in-spite of numerous studies its physiological function in humans has not been defined. We compared data on non-synonymous single nucleotide variations (nsSNVs) and loss-of-function variants on TGM1-7 and F13a from the Exome aggregation consortium dataset, and used computational and biochemical analysis to reveal the roles of damaging nsSNVs of TGM2. TGM2 and F13a display rarer damaging nsSNV sites than other TGMs and sequence of TGM2, F13a and TGM1 are evolutionary constrained. TGM2 nsSNVs are predicted to destabilize protein structure, influence Ca2+ and GTP regulation, and non-enzymatic interactions, but none coincide with conserved functional sites. We have experimentally characterized six TGM2 allelic variants detected so far in homozygous form, out of which only one, p.Arg222Gln, has decreased activities. Published exome sequencing data from various populations have not uncovered individuals with homozygous loss-of-function variants for TGM2, TGM3 and TGM7. Thus it can be concluded that human transglutaminases differ in harboring damaging variants and TGM2 is under purifying selection suggesting that it may have so far not revealed physiological functions."
https://openalex.org/W2592689801,"Resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) is an imaging technology that has recently gained attention for its ability to detect disruptions in functional brain networks in humans, including in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD), revealing early and widespread brain network abnormalities. This methodology is now readily applicable to experimental animals offering new possibilities for cross-species translational imaging. In this context, we herein describe the application of rsfMRI to the unilaterally-lesioned 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) rat, a robust experimental model of the dopamine depletion implicated in PD. Using graph theory to analyse the rsfMRI data, we were able to provide meaningful and translatable measures of integrity, influence and segregation of the underlying functional brain architecture. Specifically, we confirm that rats share a similar functional brain network topology as observed in humans, characterised by small-worldness and modularity. Interestingly, we observed significantly reduced functional connectivity in the 6-OHDA rats, primarily in the ipsilateral (lesioned) hemisphere as evidenced by significantly lower node degree, local efficiency and clustering coefficient in the motor, orbital and sensorimotor cortices. In contrast, we found significantly, and bilaterally, increased thalamic functional connectivity in the lesioned rats. The unilateral deficits in the cortex are consistent with the unilateral nature of this model and further support the validity of the rsfMRI technique in rodents. We thereby provide a methodological framework for the investigation of brain networks in other rodent experimental models of PD, as well as of animal models in general, for cross-comparison with human data."

In this study, we show that Brachypodium distachyon is a useful model system for stem pith parenchyma biology. Brachypodium can be grown under condition where it resembles the growth patterns of important crops in that it produces large amounts of stem material with the lower leaves senescing and with significant stores of photosynthate located in the stem parenchyma cell types. We further characterize stem plastid morphology as a function of tissue types, as this organelle is central for a number of metabolic pathways, and quantify gene expression for the four main classes of starch biosynthetic genes. Notably, we find several of these genes differentially regulated between stem and leaf. These studies show, consistent with other grasses, that the stem functions as a specialized storage compartment in Brachypodium."
https://openalex.org/W2952614789,"The decrease of federal and state support threatens long-term sustainability of research in publicly supported academic health centers. In weathering these financial threats, research at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), has undergone 3 substantial changes: institutional salary support goes preferentially to senior faculty, whereas the young increasingly depend on grants; private and government support for research grows apace in clinical departments but declines in basic science departments; and research is judged more on its quantity (numbers of investigators and federal and private dollars) than on its goals, achievements, or scientific quality. We propose specific measures to alleviate these problems. Other large public academic health centers probably confront similar issues, but-except for UCSF-such centers have not been subjected to detailed public analysis.-Bourne, H. R., Vermillion, E. B. Lost dollars threaten research in public academic health centers."
https://openalex.org/W2592073513,"Food web structure and species richness are both subject to biotic (e.g. predation pressure and resource limitation) and abiotic stress (e.g. environmental change). We investigated the combined effects of both types of stress on richness and connectance, and on their relationship, in a predator-prey system. To this end, we developed a mathematical two trophic level food-web model to investigate the effects of biotic and abiotic stress on food web connectance and species richness. We found negative effects of top-down and bottom-up control on prey and predator richness, respectively. Effects of top-down and bottom-up control were stronger when initial connectance was high and low, respectively. Bottom-up control could either aggravate or buffer negative effects of top-down control. Abiotic stress affecting predator richness had positive indirect effects on prey richness, but only when initial connectance was low. However, no indirect effects on predator richness were observed following direct effects on prey richness. Top-down and bottom-up control selected for weakly connected prey and highly connected predators, thereby decreasing and increasing connectance, respectively. Our simulations suggest a broad range of negative and positive richness-connectance relationships, thereby revisiting the often found negative relationship between richness and connectance in food webs. Our results suggest that (1) initial food-web connectance strongly influences the effects of biotic stress on richness and the occurrence of indirect effects on richness; and (2) the shape of the richness-connectance relationship depends on the type of biotic stress."
https://openalex.org/W2594002887,"While the immunogenic potential of the vaccination against infectious diseases was extensively shown, data on the safety assessment of recombinant proteins in vaccine formulations administered during pregnancy are still scarce. In the current study, the antigenicity of a vaccine against leishmaniasis (based on Leishmania braziliensis recombinant protein peroxidoxin) during pregnancy and possible maternal reproductive outcomes and fetal anomalies after immunization with a leishmanial vaccine or adjuvant alone (Bordetella pertussis derived MPLA adjuvant) were assessed. Rats were mated and allocated in three groups: Control-rats received saline; Adjuvant-rats received the adjuvant MPLA, and Vaccine-rats received the combination of MPLA and peroxidoxin. The administration was subcutaneously at the dorsal region, three times (days 0, 7, 14 of pregnancy). On day 21 of pregnancy, all rats were bled for biochemical and immunological measurements. The gravid uterus was weighed with its contents, and the fetuses were analyzed. The immunization with peroxidoxin induced a significant production of circulating IgG levels compared to other groups but caused a significant in post-implantation loss (14.7%) when compared to Control (5.0%) and Adjuvant (4.4%) groups. Furthermore, a significantly high rate of fetal visceral anomalies, such as hydronephrosis and convoluted ureter, was also observed in animals that received vaccine when compared to Control or Adjuvant groups. These data indicate the importance of safety evaluation of vaccines during pregnancy and the limited use of peroxidoxin administration during pregnancy. More importantly, the safety monitoring of immunization with MPLA derived from Bordetella pertussis demonstrated no reproductive outcomes associated with adjuvant administration, suggesting its safe use during pregnancy."

https://openalex.org/W2593611758,"Hybrid weakness, a phenomenon opposite to heterosis, refers to inferior growth and development in a hybrid relative to its pure-line parents. Little attention has been paid to the phenomenological or mechanistic aspect of hybrid weakness, probably due to its rare occurrence.Here, using a set of interspecific triploid F1 hybrids between Oryza sativa, ssp. japonica (genome AA) and a tetraploid wild rice species, O. alta (genome, CCDD), we investigated the phenotypic and physiological differences between the F1 hybrids and their parents under normal and nitrogen-limiting conditions. We quantified the expression levels of 21 key genes involved in three important pathways pertinent to the assayed phenotypic and physiological traits by real-time qRT-PCR. Further, we assayed expression partitioning of parental alleles for eight genes in the F1 hybrids relative to the in silico ""hybrids"" (parental cDNA mixture) under both normal and N-limiting conditions by using locus-specific cDNA pyrosequencing.We report that the F1 hybrids showed weakness in several phenotypic traits at the final seedling-stage compared with their corresponding mid-parent values (MPVs). Nine of the 21 studied genes showed contrasted expression levels between hybrids and parents (MPVs) under normal vs. N-limiting conditions. Interestingly, under N-limiting conditions, the overtly enhanced partitioning of maternal allele expression in the hybrids for eight assayed genes echo their attenuated hybrid weakness in phenotypes, an observation further bolstered by more resemblance of hybrids to the maternal parent under N-limiting conditions compared to normal conditions in a suite of measured physiological traits. Our observations suggest that both overall expression level and differential partitioning of parental alleles of critical genes contribute to condition-specific hybrid weakness."
https://openalex.org/W2593998525,"Atherosclerosis is a complex multifactorial disease and the apolipoprotein E (APOE) polymorphism has been associated to vascular complications of atherosclerosis.To investigate the relationship between the APOE genotypes and advanced peripheral vascular disease.258 consecutive patients (201 males and 57 females, mean age 70.83 ± 7.89 years) with severe PVD were enrolled in a 42-months longitudinal study (mean 31.65 ± 21.11 months) for major adverse cardiovascular events. At follow-up genotypes of the APOE polymorphism were investigated in blinded fashion.As compared with ε3/ε3, in ε4-carriers a significant higher incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (35.58% vs. 20.79%; p = 0.025) and total peripheral revascularization (22.64% vs. 5.06%; p < 0.001) was observed. Prospective analysis, showed that ε4-carriers have an increased hazard ratio for major adverse cardiovascular events (adjusted HR 1.829, 95% CI 1.017-3.287; p = 0.044) and total peripheral revascularization (adjusted HR = 5.916, 95% CI 2.405-14.554, p <0.001).The ε4 allele seems to be risk factor for major adverse cardiovascular events, and in particular for total peripheral revascularization in patients with advanced atherosclerotic vascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W2594344245,"Background The Subclass Coleoidea (Class Cephalopoda) accommodates the diverse present-day internally shelled cephalopod mollusks (Spirula, Sepia and octopuses, squids, Vampyroteuthis) and also extinct internally shelled cephalopods. Recent Spirula represents a unique coleoid retaining shell structures, a narrow marginal siphuncle and globular protoconch that signify the ancestry of the subclass Coleoidea from the Paleozoic subclass Bactritoidea. This hypothesis has been recently supported by newly recorded diverse bactritoid-like coleoids from the Carboniferous of the USA, but prior to this study no fossil cephalopod indicative of an endochochleate branch with an origin independent from subclass Bactritoidea has been reported. Methodology/Principal findings Two orthoconic conchs were recovered from the Early Eocene of Seymour Island at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, Antarctica. They have loosely mineralized organic-rich chitin-compatible microlaminated shell walls and broadly expanded central siphuncles. The morphological, ultrustructural and chemical data were determined and characterized through comparisons with extant and extinct taxa using Scanning Electron Microscopy/Energy Dispersive Spectrometry (SEM/EDS). Conclusions/Significance Our study presents the first evidence for an evolutionary lineage of internally shelled cephalopods with independent origin from Bactritoidea/Coleoidea, indicating convergent evolution with the subclass Coleoidea. A new subclass Paracoleoidea Doguzhaeva n. subcl. is established for accommodation of orthoconic cephalopods with the internal shell associated with a broadly expanded central siphuncle. Antarcticerida Doguzhaeva n. ord., Antarcticeratidae Doguzhaeva n. fam., Antarcticeras nordenskjoeldi Doguzhaeva n. gen., n. sp. are described within the subclass Paracoleoidea. The analysis of organic-rich shell preservation of A. nordenskjoeldi by use of SEM/EDS techniques revealed fossilization of hyposeptal cameral soft tissues. This suggests that a depositional environment favoring soft-tissue preservation was the factor enabling conservation of the weakly mineralized shell of A. nordenskjoeldi."
https://openalex.org/W2591612906,"Recently, we described a new animal model of CNS primitive neuroectodermal tumors (CNS-PNET), which was generated by orthotopic transplantation of human Radial Glial (RG) cells into NOD-SCID mice's brain sub-ventricular zone. In the current study we conducted comprehensive RNA-Seq analyses to gain insights on the mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis in this mouse model of CNS-PNET. Here we show that the RNA-Seq profiles derived from these tumors cluster with those reported for patients' PNETs. Moreover, we found that (i) stabilization of HIF-1α and HIF-2α, which are involved in mediation of the hypoxic responses in the majority of cell types, (ii) up-regulation of MYCC, a key onco-protein whose dysregulation occurs in ~70% of human tumors, and (iii) accumulation of stabilized p53, which is commonly altered in human cancers, constitute hallmarks of our tumor model, and might represent the basis for CNS-PNET tumorigenesis in this model. We discuss the possibility that these three events might be interconnected. These results indicate that our model may prove invaluable to uncover the molecular events leading to MYCC and TP53 alterations, which would be of broader interest considering their relevance to many human malignancies. Lastly, this mouse model might prove useful for drug screening targeting MYCC and related members of its protein interaction network."
https://openalex.org/W2592196543,"We investigate whether individuals are more prone to act selfishly if they can passively allow for an outcome to be implemented (omission) rather than having to make an active choice (commission). In most settings, active and passive choice alternatives differ in terms of factors such as the presence of a suggested option, costs of taking an action, and awareness. We isolate the omission effect from confounding factors in three experiments, and find no evidence that the distinction between active and passive choices has an independent effect on the propensity to implement selfish outcomes. This suggests that increased selfishness through omission, as observed in various economic choice situations, is driven by other factors than a preference for selfish omissions."
https://openalex.org/W2594051768,"The Florida harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex badius collects the seeds of many plant species and stores them in underground nest chambers for later consumption. Seeds taken from multiple nests in 1989, 2014 and 2015 were separated by size and species and identified through published keys, comparison with herbarium specimens and with identified seed collections. Harvester ants stored at least 58 species of seeds from 20 plant families in their chambers. This paper presents images of each seed species in several aspects, their relative abundance in P. badius nests, their size relative to the smallest, and links to online data and images of the parent plant species, as well as to herbarium specimens. A number of seeds and plant families present at the site were not found in ant nests. These data and images will be valuable for future studies and experiments to untangle the choices the ants make in relation to what the plants and the seasons offer them."
https://openalex.org/W2592778494,"L-[methyl-11C]Methionine (11C-Met) is useful for estimating the therapeutic efficacy of particle radiotherapy at early stages of the treatment. Given the short half-life of 11C, the development of longer-lived 18F- and 123I-labeled probes that afford diagnostic information similar to 11C-Met, are being sought. Tumor uptake of 11C-Met is involved in many cellular functions such as amino acid transport System-L, protein synthesis, and transmethylation. Among these processes, since the energy-dependent intracellular functions involved with 11C-Met are more reflective of the radiotherapeutic effects, we evaluated the activity of the amino acid transport System-A as an another energy-dependent cellular function in order to estimate radiotherapeutic effects. In this study, using a carbon-ion beam as the radiation source, the activity of System-A was evaluated by a specific System-A substrate, alpha-[1-14C]-methyl-aminoisobutyric acid (14C-MeAIB). Cellular growth and the accumulation of 14C-MeAIB or 14C-Met were evaluated over time in vitro in cultured human salivary gland (HSG) tumor cells (3-Gy) or in vivo in murine xenografts of HSG tumors (6- or 25-Gy) before and after irradiation with the carbon-ion beam. Post 3-Gy irradiation, in vitro accumulation of 14C-Met and 14C-MeAIB decreased over a 5-day period. In xenografts of HSG tumors in mice, tumor re-growth was observed in vivo on day-10 after a 6-Gy irradiation dose, but no re-growth was detected after the 25-Gy irradiation dose. Consistent with the growth results, the in vivo tumor accumulation of 14C-MeAIB did not decrease after the 6-Gy irradiation dose, whereas a significant decrease was observed after the 25-Gy irradiation dose. These results indicate that the activity of energy dependent System-A transporter may reflect the therapeutic efficacy of carbon-ion radiotherapy and suggests that longer half-life radionuclide-labeled probes for System-A may also provide widely available probes to evaluate the effects of particle radiotherapy on tumors at early stage of the treatment."
