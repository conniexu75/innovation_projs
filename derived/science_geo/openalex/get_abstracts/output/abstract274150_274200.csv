https://openalex.org/W2031508977,"Lindeman's classic paper on energy flow in ecosystems was initially rejected for publication in Ecology. Reviewers felt there were insufficient data to support the theoretical model and that theoretical essays were inappropriate for Ecology. The paper was subsequently accepted by Thomas Park, the zoological editor, after correspondence with G. Evelyn Hutchinson who indicated the importance of theory in the development of ecology."

Homoiothermal conditions, isometric concentrations of phosphorus, and increases of dissolved oxygen were achieved, at various rates of treatment. The application of the technique for lake management and in studies of lake dynamics is suggested."

Razran [Science 128, 758 (3 Oct. 1958)], the quotation given in the first sentence of the section ""Oral comments"" (p. 760) should have read: ""Pavlov remarked to me that one of the biggest scientific errors of his life was his assertion that acquired habits could be inherited,"" instead of "". . . could not be inherited."""
