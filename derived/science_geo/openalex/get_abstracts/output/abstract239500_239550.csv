https://openalex.org/W1982813608,"Achieving optical gain and/or lasing in silicon has been one of the most challenging goals in silicon-based photonics because bulk silicon is an indirect bandgap semiconductor and therefore has a very low light emission efficiency. Recently, stimulated Raman scattering has been used to demonstrate light amplification and lasing in silicon. However, because of the nonlinear optical loss associated with two-photon absorption (TPA)-induced free carrier absorption (FCA), until now lasing has been limited to pulsed operation. Here we demonstrate a continuous-wave silicon Raman laser. Specifically, we show that TPA-induced FCA in silicon can be significantly reduced by introducing a reverse-biased p-i-n diode embedded in a silicon waveguide. The laser cavity is formed by coating the facets of the silicon waveguide with multilayer dielectric films. We have demonstrated stable single mode laser output with side-mode suppression of over 55 dB and linewidth of less than 80 MHz. The lasing threshold depends on the p-i-n reverse bias voltage and the laser wavelength can be tuned by adjusting the wavelength of the pump laser. The demonstration of a continuous-wave silicon laser represents a significant milestone for silicon-based optoelectronic devices."

The mechanism through which this life extension is mediated remains incompletely understood. Here we have examined the cellular effects of overexpression of SIRT1, the closest mammalian ortholog of Sir2. In PC12 cells, increased expression of the NAD-dependent deacetylase SIRT1 reduces cellular oxygen consumption by ∼25%. We further demonstrate that SIRT1 expression can alter the transcriptional activity of the mitochondrial biogenesis coactivator PGC-1α. In addition, SIRT1 and PGC-1α directly interact and can be co-immunoprecipitated as a molecular complex. A single amino acid mutation in the putative ADP-ribosyltransferase domain of SIRT1 inhibits the interaction of SIRT1 with PGC-1α but does not effect the interaction of SIRT1 with either p53 or Foxo3a. We further show that PGC-1α is acetylated in vivo. This acetylation is augmented by treatment with the SIRT1 inhibitor nicotinamide or by expression of the transcriptional coactivator p300. Finally we demonstrate that SIRT1 catalyzes PGC-1α deacetylation both in vitro and in vivo. These results provide a direct link between the sirtuins, a family of proteins linked to lifespan determination and PGC-1α, a coactivator that regulates cellular metabolism.

The most widely held theory of aging suggests that mitochondrial oxygen consumption and resulting reactive oxygen species generation fuel the aging process (1Finkel T. Holbrook N.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 239-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (7348) Google Scholar). In lower organisms such as yeast and worms, increased expression of the enzyme Sir2, an NAD-dependent deacetylase, results in an increased life span (2Kaeberlein M. McVey M. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2570-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (1765) Google Scholar, 3Tissenbaum H.A. Guarente L. Nature. 2001; 410: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar). Sir2 belongs to a growing family of enzymes collectively known as the sirtuins (4Bitterman K.J. Medvedik O. Sinclair D.A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 376-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 5Blander G. Guarente L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 417-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar, 6Denu J.M.

Genome Biology. 2004; (http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/1/reviews/0224)PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism through which Sir2 extends lifespan is unclear, although its role in gene silencing has been commonly implicated (2Kaeberlein M. McVey M. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2570-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (1765) Google Scholar, 8Imai S.I. Armstrong C.M. Kaeberlein M. Guarente L. Nature. 2000; 403: 795-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (2788) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the relationship, if any, between the sirtuins and mitochondrial metabolism remains largely unexplored. Analysis of Sir2 enzymatic function has revealed that it functions differently from previously described histone deacetylases. In particular, studies with purified Sir2 protein revealed that, for every acetyl lysine group that is removed from a presumed substrate, one molecule of NAD is cleaved (4Bitterman K.J. Medvedik O. Sinclair D.A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 376-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 5Blander G. Guarente L. Annu. Rev.

Verdin E. Genome Biology. 2004; (http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/1/reviews/0224)PubMed Google Scholar). The products produced by this Sir2 enzymatic deacteylation include both nicotinamide and O-acetyl-ADP-ribose. Therefore, Sir2 appears to possess two enzymatic activities, including the deacetylation of a target protein and the metabolism of NAD. These two activities are coupled, because the acetyl group from the target protein is transferred to the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD. Although acetylation and deacetylation have been clearly recognized as reversible modulators of protein activity, the role, if any, of the novel O-acetyl-ADP-ribose moiety remains unclear. Interestingly, a recent report suggested that direct injection of O-acetyl-ADP-ribose into oocytes retards subsequent maturation (9Borra M.T. O'Neill F.J. Jackson M.D. Marshall B. Verdin E. Foltz K.R. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12632-12641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The requirement for NAD in the deacetylase activity of Sir2 has led to the suggestion that enzymatic activity could be regulated by the concentration of NAD, the ratio of NAD/NADH, or by the intracellular concentration of nicotinamide (10Revollo J.R.

Nature. 2003; 423: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). In particular, caloric restriction appears to augment lifespan in a wide range of species, and evidence suggests that the life extension induced by nutritional deprivation involves, and in some cases requires, Sir2 (11Lin S.J. Defossez P.A. Guarente L. Science. 2000; 289: 2126-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1481) Google Scholar, 14Cohen H.Y. Miller C. Bitterman K.J. Wall N.R. Hekking B. Kessler B. Howitz K.T.

A. 2004; 101: 15998-16003Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Because the level of oxidized and reduced NAD may be altered under starved conditions, this has led to the hypothesis that Sir2 activity is augmented during caloric restriction by alterations in the NAD/NADH ratio (11Lin S.J. Defossez P.A. Guarente L. Science. 2000; 289: 2126-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1481) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, considerable controversy exists as to whether starvation significantly alters the NAD/NADH ratio and whether or not this ratio does or does not physiologically regulate Sir2 activity (12Lin S.J. Ford E. Haigis M. Liszt G. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 12-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 16Anderson R.M. Latorre-Esteves M. Neves A.R. Lavu S. Medvedik O. Taylor C. Howitz K.T. Santos H. Sinclair D.A. Science. 2003; 302: 2124-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In this report, we provide evidence for another direct link between sirtuins and metabolism. In particular we demonstrate a molecular interaction between SIRT1 and the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α, a master regulator of metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis (17Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 78-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar). Cell Lines and Plasmids—Clonal cell lines were established from PC12 cells obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD). Cells were maintained in a basal growth medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. This media formulation contains high glucose (4.5 g/liter) but no exogenous pyruvate. HeLa cells (ATCC) were grown in the same medium. The wild type mouse SIRT1 cDNA was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology and subcloned into a HA 1The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutinin; WT, wild type; GST, glutathione S-transferase. -tagged cDNA cloning vector (pCruzHA, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). A glycine to alanine site ADP-ribosyltransferase mutant at position 261 of SIRT1 was constructed by standard methods, and mutant and wild type constructs were confirmed by direct sequencing. This amino acid substitution has been previously demonstrated to abrogate essentially all of the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity in yeast Sir2 protein (8Imai S.I. Armstrong C.M. Kaeberlein M. Guarente L. Nature. 2000; 403: 795-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (2788) Google Scholar). Clonal cell lines expressing wild type SIRT1 (WT), SIRT1G261A, or the empty HA-vector alone (Neo) were obtained by transfection and subsequent isolation by limiting dilutions in G418 selection. In stable clones that expressed wild type or mutant SIRT1, transgene expression was determined by Western blot analysis using an antibody recognizing the HA epitope (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Total SIRT1 expression was determined by Western blot using an SIRT1-specific antibody (Upstate). Levels of SIRT1 mRNA were determined by reverse transcription-PCR analysis using the following SIRT1-specific primers: 5′-CCTGACTTCAGATCAAGAGACGGTA-3′ and 5′-CTGATTAAAAATGTCTCCACGAACAG-3′. Primers for β-actin were provided by the manufacturer (Clontech). Measurement of cytochrome oxidase subunit II expression was also determined by Western blot expression using a commercially available antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Human SIRT3 was cloned by standard PCR-based methods and verified by direct sequencing. Oxygen Consumption—Oxygen consumption was measured using a fiber optic oxygen monitor (Instech). All measurements of oxygen consumption were performed in intact cells. Cells were plated in 15-cm dishes and allowed to grow for 7 days prior to trypsinization and subsequent oxygen determination. Oxygen consumption was performed in basal growth medium (see above), because we observed that measured oxygen consumption varied substantially depending on the extracellular supply of glucose, pyruvate, and serum. For analysis we used 20 individual control cell lines (Neo), 23 SIRT1-overexpressing cells, and 7 clones of SIRT1G261A. Each cell line was measured by either duplicate or triplicate determinations. PGC-1α Transcriptional Activity and Protein-Protein Interaction— For determination of PGC-1α transcriptional activity we transfected PC12 cells with a previously described construct encoding full-length PGC-1α fused to the GAL-4 DNA binding domain (18Vega R.B. Huss J.M. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1868-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). This construct (0.4 μg) was co-transfected with increasing amount of wild type SIRT1 (0.1–0.4 μg) or a similar amount of the ADP-ribosyltransferase-inactive mutant. A GAL-4-dependent luciferase reporter (0.2 μg) and an internal Renilla control (0.05 μg) were also transfected into each dish. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were harvested and PGC-1α transcriptional activity was analyzed using the dual luciferase reporter assay (Promega). Results are expressed in arbitrary units from a single experiment performed in triplicate and are representative of at least three similar experiments. To assess the interaction of PGC-1α and SIRT1, cells were transfected with wild type HA-SIRT1 and Myc-PGC-1α alone or in combination. These experiments were performed in HeLa cells, because these cells resulted in substantially higher transgene expression. Twenty-four hours after transfection, extracts were prepared in Lysis buffer (19Nemoto S. Finkel T. Science. 2002; 295: 2450-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar), and 1 mg of total cell extract was immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody (BabCO). The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the level of co-immunoprecipitated Myc-PGC-1α was determined by Western blot analysis using an anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Reciprocal immunoprecipitations were also performed in an analogous fashion by first immunoprecipitating 1 mg of protein lysate with a Myc-epitope antibody followed by Western blotting with an anti-HA antibody. To analyze the interaction of wild type SIRT1 and SIRT1G261A with Foxo3a and p53, we immunoprecipitated cell lysates as above except that cells were previously transfected with expression vectors encoding either wild type p53 or epitope-tagged Myc-Foxo3a. These constructs have been previously described (20Nemoto S. Fergusson M.M. Finkel T. Science. 2004; 306: 2105-2108Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitated p53 was visualized following Western blot analysis using an anti-p53 antibody (FL-393; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). PGC-1α Acetylation—To assess the level of PGC-1α acetylation, HeLa cells were transfected with a Myc-PGC-1α expression vector and where indicated, an expression vector encoding p300. Acetylation status was determined by immunoprecipitation of 2 mg of protein lysate in lysis buffer (19Nemoto S. Finkel T. Science. 2002; 295: 2450-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar) using an antibody directed against the Myc-epitope tag. Levels of acetylated PGC-1α were subsequently assessed with an antiacetyl lysine antibody (Cell Signaling). Where indicated, 10 mm nicotinamide was added for the last 15 h prior to harvest. For the in vitro deacetylation reaction, immunoprecipitated PGC-1α was incubated with 1 μg of GST-SIRT1. The deacteylation reaction was performed in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, for 1 h at 30 °C in the presence or absence of the indicated concentration of NAD or nicotinamide. After incubation with GST-SIRT1 the level of acetylated PGC-1α was determined as above by Western blot analysis followed by detection using an anti-acetyl lysine antibody. To assess whether SIRT1 influenced cellular metabolic rate, we sought to mimic the conditions previously demonstrated to extend life span in lower organisms. In both yeast and worms, simple overexpression of Sir2 results in an increase in life span (2Kaeberlein M. McVey M. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2570-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (1765) Google Scholar, 3Tissenbaum H.A. Guarente L. Nature. 2001; 410: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar). We therefore established stable PC12 cell lines that constitutively expressed increased levels of SIRT1. On average SIRT1 mRNA expression and protein (data not shown) were increased ∼3-fold in these cell lines (Fig. 1A). We also simultaneously established cell lines that expressed a mutant of SIRT1 harboring a glycine to alanine substitution at amino acid position 261 of the protein (SIRT1G261A). This amino acid is in a highly conserved domain required for the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of yeast Sir2 but not its deacetylase activity (8Imai S.I. Armstrong C.M. Kaeberlein M. Guarente L. Nature. 2000; 403: 795-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (2788) Google Scholar). To avoid the confounding issue of clonal variation, we established 20 individual control clones expressing G418 resistance alone (Neo) and compared them to a similar number of clones transfected with a vector encoding both G418 resistance and an epitope-tagged wild type SIRT1 construct (n = 23). As demonstrated in Fig. 1B, increased SIRT1 expression led to a roughly 25% reduction in oxygen consumption (p < 0.001). In contrast, cell lines expressing the mutant in the ADP-ribosyltransferase domain had oxygen consumption that was ∼10% higher than control cells (p < 0.01). Treatment of control or SIRT1-overexpressing clonal cell lines with the electron transport inhibitor antimycin A demonstrated that >90% of the measured oxygen consumption derived from mitochondrial metabolism (Fig. 1C). One simple explanation for the decrease in oxygen consumption following increased wild type SIRT1 expression is that these cells contain less mitochondria. Consistent with this hypothesis, levels of subunit II of the mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome oxidase (COX II) were reduced in cell lines that overexpressed SIRT1 (Fig. 1D). Analysis of several random control and SIRT1-overexpressing cell lines demonstrated that relative COX II expression was reduced ∼45% in SIRT1-expressing cells (n = 4 random wild type and control clones; p < 0.05). Recent evidence suggests that mitochondrial biogenesis is regulated by the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α (17Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 78-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar). We therefore next tested whether SIRT1 might regulate PGC-1α activity. To assess the intrinsic transcriptional activity of PGC-1α we employed a previously described fusion construct of full-length PGC-1α fused to the DNA binding domain of GAL4 (18Vega R.B. Huss J.M. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1868-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). This construct was transfected into PC12 cells along with a luciferase reporter construct under the control of tandem GAL4 DNA binding elements. As noted in Fig. 2, expression of wild type SIRT1 but not the SIRT1G261A mutant reduced the transcriptional activity of a GAL4-PGC-1α fusion protein. Based on these observations, we next sought to determine whether both PGC-1α and SIRT1 were capable of direct interaction. We transiently expressed epitope-tagged forms of wild type SIRT1 or SIRT1G261A along with PGC-1α in HeLa cells. As demonstrated in Fig. 3A, immunoprecipitation of wild type HA-tagged SIRT1 co-immunoprecipitated PGC-1α. In contrast to the association of wild type protein with PGC-1α, similar analysis of SIRT1G261A resulted in significantly reduced levels of co-immunoprecipitated PGC-1α (Fig. 3B). This disparity was also evident when the reciprocal immunoprecipitation was performed. As shown in Fig. 3C, immunoprecipitation of PGC-1α from lysates revealed an association with wild type SIRT1 but not with SIRT1G261A.Fig. 3PGC-1α and SIRT1 interact.A, detection of wild type SIRT1 and PGC-1α interaction.

Interestingly, both of these protein partners of SIRT1 have been implicated in the aging process (28Dumble M. Gatza C. Tyner S. Venkatachalam S. Donehower L.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1019: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 29Tran H. Brunet A. Griffith E.C. Greenberg M.E. Science's STKE. 2003; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2003/172/re5)PubMed Google Scholar). To date the region of SIRT1 required for these various interactions has not been defined. We therefore sought to test whether the reduced strength of interaction between PGC-1α and the SIRT1G261A mutant was also observed with other known protein partners. As shown in Fig. 4, the interaction of the SIRT1G261A mutant with both p53 (Fig. 4A) and with Foxo3a (Fig. 4B) was qualitatively very similar to wild type SIRT1. These results suggest the SIRT1/PGC-1α interaction differs structurally from the interaction with either the tumor suppressor p53 or with the transcription factor Foxo3a. Given that SIRT1 has been shown to deacetylate numerous transcriptional regulators, including p53 (21Luo J. Nikolaev A.Y. Imai S. Chen D. Su F. Shiloh A. Guarente L. Gu W.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2369-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (2198) Google Scholar), we next wondered whether PGC-1α might also be a deacetylase target of SIRT1. Using an antibody that recognized acetyl-lysine, we were able to detect low levels of acetylated PGC-1α in cells (Fig. 5A). Treatment with nicotinamide, a known inhibitor of sirtuins (13Anderson R.M. Bitterman K.J. Wood J.G. Medvedik O. Sinclair D.A. Nature. 2003; 423: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 31Bitterman K.J. Anderson R.M. Cohen H.Y. Latorre-Esteves M. Sinclair D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45099-45107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar), resulted in a substantial increase in PGC-1α acetylation. Previous studies have demonstrated that the transcriptional coactivator p300 can directly bind PGC-1α a (32Puigserver P. Adelmant G. Wu Z. Fan M. Xu J. O'Malley B. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1999; 286: 1368-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). The interaction of PGC-1α and p300 has been documented to result in a conformational change in PGC-1α that increases transcriptional activity (32Puigserver P. Adelmant G. Wu Z. Fan M. Xu J. O'Malley B. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1999; 286: 1368-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Given that p300 also possesses histone acetyltransferase activity, we wondered whether co-expression with PGC-1α would alter acetylation. As noted in Fig. 5B, the expression of p300 dramatically increased PGC-1α acetylation. Indeed, the level of PGC-1α acetylation showed a mark correlation to the amount of transfected p300 (Fig. 5C). To assess whether PGC-1α could be deacetylated by SIRT1 in vitro, we immunoprecipitated PGC-1α from lysates of cells co-transfected with both a PGC-1α and p300 expression vector. To these immunoprecipitates we added purified recombinant SIRT1. As demonstrated in Fig. 6, recombinant SIRT1 in the presence of NAD but not nicotinamide deacetylated PGC-1α. Addition of NAD did not reduce PGC-1α acetylation in the absence of SIRT1 (data not shown). Finally, we asked whether SIRT1 could stimulate similar deacetylation in vivo. Cells were therefore transfected with PGC-1α and p300 along with either wild type or SIRT1G261A expression vectors. As noted in Fig. 7A, expression of wild type SIRT1 dramatically reduced the steady-state level of acetylated PGC-1α. The expression of SIRT1G261A also reduced PGC-1α acetylation, albeit slightly less efficiently than wild type SIRT1. In contrast to the effects of SIRT1, expression of the related SIRT3 had no effect on PGC-1α acetylation (Fig. 7B). Our results demonstrate that SIRT1 and PGC-1α physically interact and that SIRT1 can regulate PGC-1α acetylation both in vitro and in vivo. In the context of a GAL4 fusion protein, SIRT1 appears to inhibit the transcriptional activity of PGC-1α. Similarly, the effect of stable overexpression of SIRT1 is to reduce the level of oxygen consumption. Given that oxygen consumption is linked to the generation of reactive oxygen species and reactive oxygen species levels correlate with lifespan (1Finkel T. Holbrook N.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 239-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (7348) Google Scholar), these results may have important implications for how sirtuins regulate aging. Our original impetus for these experiments was based on an observation derived from mitochondrial proteomics analysis that demonstrated a coordinate regulation of SIRT1 and mitochondrial gene expression (33Mootha V.K. Bunkenborg J. Olsen J.V. Hjerrild M. Wisniewski J.R. Stahl E. Bolouri M.S. Ray H.N. Sihag S. Kamal M. Patterson N. Lander E.S. Mann M. Cell. 2003; 115: 629-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Given that PGC-1α plays such a central role in mitochondrial gene expression, we hypothesized that PGC-1α and SIRT1 might physically or functionally interact. Our results support this conjecture. It should be noted however that recent evidence suggests that SIRT1 and p300 can also interact (24Motta M.C. Divecha N. Lemieux M. Kamel C. Chen D. Gu W. Bultsma Y. McBurney M. Guarente L.

Chem. 2005; (January 4, 10.1074/jbc.M408748200)Google Scholar). In addition, as previously mentioned, PGC-1α and p300 also bind to each other (32Puigserver P. Adelmant G. Wu Z. Fan M. Xu J. O'Malley B. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1999; 286: 1368-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). This situation is analogous to the interactions described between SIRT1 and other protein targets. For instance, SIRT1 had been shown to separately bind to both p53 and Foxo3a (21Luo J. Nikolaev A.Y.

In addition, evidence suggests that p53 and Foxo3a can bind to each other (20Nemoto S. Fergusson M.M. Finkel T. Science. 2004; 306: 2105-2108Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 25Brunet A.

Science. 2004; 303: 2011-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (2644) Google Scholar). Thus as described above, SIRT1 may be an important aspect for a number of distinct transcriptional complexes potentially acting as a scaffold to tether various members of the complex together. In addition, given that NAD regulates the activity of SIRT1, it is possible that SIRT1 functions as bridge coordinating metabolic status with transcription of key target genes. We cannot at this point determine whether SIRT1 deacetylation of PGC-1α is the sole means by which SIRT1 overexpression regulates oxygen consumption in cells. Clearly, as described above, SIRT1 has numerous cellular targets, including other potential regulators of metabolism such as the Forkhead family of transcription factors. In addition, two other observations suggest that the relationship between SIRT1 and oxygen consumption is complex. First, although SIRT1G261A is not as efficient in deacetylating PGC-1α as wild type SIRT1, the mutant still appears relatively robust in this activity (see Fig. 7A). As such, one might have expected that if the level of PGC-1α acetylation was the only factor regulating oxygen consumption, than the increased expression of SIRT1G261A would also lower respiration. As noted in Fig. 1 this does not appear to be the case. These results suggest that there is not a perfect concordance between PGC-1α acetylation status and measured oxygen consumption. It should be noted that some of the observed differences between Fig. 1B and 7A might relate to specific experimental variables such as the presence or absence of coexpressed p300 or the difference between stable and transient expression of SIRT1. Alternatively, these results perhaps suggest that a stable SIRT1-PGC-1α interaction may have important cellular effects that are independent of the deacetylation reaction. The second caveat concerning the effects of SIRT1 and oxygen consumption is that our preliminary results suggest that knockdown of SIRT1 by siRNA also leads to a reduction of oxygen consumption. 2S. Nemoto, M. M. Fergusson, and T. Finkel, unpublished observations. These results suggest that the relationship between SIRT1 expression and oxygen consumption may be more bell-shaped than linear. The role of PGC-1α in oxygen consumption is undoubtedly complex. Part of this complexity may result from the realization that cellular respiration integrates the number of mitochondria, the degree of mitochondrial coupling, and the level and type of metabolic supply. Interestingly, PGC-1α can regulate each of these parameters (17Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 78-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar). Although forced overexpression of PGC-1α in cells and organs has been shown to increase mitochondrial content, there is a pronounced tissue-specific component to the subsequent changes in cellular respiration. For instance, in liver PGC-1α stimulates an increase in uncoupled respiration (35Wu Z. Puigserver P. Andersson U. Zhang C. Adelmant G. Mootha V. Troy A. Cinti S. Lowell B. Scarpulla R.C. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3192) Google Scholar), whereas in heart the respirations are largely coupled (36Lehman J.J. Barger P.M. Kovacs A. Saffitz J.E. Medeiros D.M. Kelly D.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). The results obtained from the recently described PGC-1α knock-out mouse are even less straightforward. For instance, total respiration of the PGC-1α -/- mouse is elevated compared with wild type littermates, whereas isolated hepatocytes demonstrated a decrease in mitochondrial respiration (37Lin J. Wu P.H. Tarr P.T. Lindenberg K.S. St-Pierre J. Zhang C.Y. Mootha V.K. Jager S. Vianna C.R. Reznick R.M. Cui L. Manieri M. Donovan M.X. Wu Z. Cooper M.P. Fan M.C. Rohas L.M. Zavacki A.M. Cinti S. Shulman G.I. Lowell B.B. Krainc D. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 2004; 119: 121-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). The authors speculated that this discordance might relate to a central hyperactivity observed in the PGC-1α -/- animals, although it also remains possible that tissue-specific effects account for these differences. In summary, our results suggest that SIRT1 and PGC-1α form a stable complex and that SIRT1 regulates the activity and acetylation status of PGC-1α. Given that overexpression of Sir2 can extend life in both yeast and worms (2Kaeberlein M. McVey M. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2570-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (1765) Google Scholar, 3Tissenbaum H.A. Guarente L. Nature. 2001; 410: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar), our observations that SIRT1 overexpression reduces oxygen consumption in PC12 cells suggests a potential new mechanism for the anti-aging effects of the sirtuins. Similarly, given the diverse role for PGC-1α in regulating metabolism, the physical interaction of this coactivator with an NAD-dependent enzyme suggests a way of coordinating metabolic decisions with metabolic status. Further elucidation of this interaction in different tissue types and in the context of a whole organism should therefore provide significant insight into cellular energetics, metabolism, and organismal aging.

https://openalex.org/W2115928938,"Endurance training induces a partial fast-to-slow muscle phenotype transformation and mitochondrial biogenesis but no growth. In contrast, resistance training mainly stimulates muscle protein synthesis resulting in hypertrophy. The aim of this study was to identify signaling events that may mediate the specific adaptations to these types of exercise. Isolated rat muscles were electrically stimulated with either high frequency (HFS; 6x10 repetitions of 3 s-bursts at 100 Hz to mimic resistance training) or low frequency (LFS; 3 h at 10 Hz to mimic endurance training). HFS significantly increased myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic protein synthesis 3 h after stimulation 5.3- and 2.7-fold, respectively. LFS had no significant effect on protein synthesis 3 h after stimulation but increased UCP3 mRNA 11.7-fold, whereas HFS had no significant effect on UCP3 mRNA. Only LFS increased AMPK phosphorylation significantly at Thr172 by approximately 2-fold and increased PGC-1alpha protein to 1.3 times of control. LFS had no effect on PKB phosphorylation but reduced TSC2 phosphorylation at Thr1462 and deactivated translational regulators. In contrast, HFS acutely increased phosphorylation of PKB at Ser473 5.3-fold and the phosphorylation of TSC2, mTOR, GSK-3beta at PKB-sensitive sites. HFS also caused a prolonged activation of the translational regulators p70 S6k, 4E-BP1, eIF-2B, and eEF2. These data suggest that a specific signaling response to LFS is a specific activation of the AMPK-PGC-1alpha signaling pathway which may explain some endurance training adaptations. HFS selectively activates the PKB-TSC2-mTOR cascade causing a prolonged activation of translational regulators, which is consistent with increased protein synthesis and muscle growth. We term this behavior the ""AMPK-PKB switch."" We hypothesize that the AMPK-PKB switch is a mechanism that partially mediates specific adaptations to endurance and resistance training, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W2058021348,"F1-ATPase is the smallest known rotary motor, and it rotates in an anticlockwise direction as it hydrolyses ATP. Single-molecule experiments point towards three catalytic events per turn, in agreement with the molecular structure of the complex. The physiological function of F1 is ATP synthesis. In the ubiquitous F0F1 complex, this energetically uphill reaction is driven by F0, the partner motor of F1, which forces the backward (clockwise) rotation of F1, leading to ATP synthesis. Here, we have devised an experiment combining single-molecule manipulation and microfabrication techniques to measure the yield of this mechanochemical transformation. Single F1 molecules were enclosed in femtolitre-sized hermetic chambers and rotated in a clockwise direction using magnetic tweezers. When the magnetic field was switched off, the F1 molecule underwent anticlockwise rotation at a speed proportional to the amount of synthesized ATP. At 10 Hz, the mechanochemical coupling efficiency was low for the alpha3beta3gamma subcomplex (F1-epsilon)), but reached up to 77% after reconstitution with the epsilon-subunit (F1+epsilon)). We provide here direct evidence that F1 is designed to tightly couple its catalytic reactions with the mechanical rotation. Our results suggest that the epsilon-subunit has an essential function during ATP synthesis."

Visible wavelength images are combined with ultraviolet images of the south polar region. The strong brightening of the aurora on 28 January corresponded with a large disturbance in the solar wind. These images were obtained during a campaign by the Cassini spacecraft to measure the solar wind approaching Saturn and the Saturn kilometric emissions, and the combined results are presented in three letters in this issue. Saturn's aurorae differ in shape and form from those seen on Earth and on Jupiter, and they also differ in their response to the solar wind. Saturn's strongest radio emissions appear to be closely tied to the polar aurora. It has often been stated that Saturn's magnetosphere and aurorae are intermediate between those of Earth, where the dominant processes are solar wind driven1, and those of Jupiter, where processes are driven by a large source of internal plasma2,3,4. But this view is based on information about Saturn that is far inferior to what is now available. Here we report ultraviolet images of Saturn, which, when combined with simultaneous Cassini measurements of the solar wind5 and Saturn kilometric radio emission6, demonstrate that its aurorae differ morphologically from those of both Earth and Jupiter. Saturn's auroral emissions vary slowly; some features appear in partial corotation whereas others are fixed to the solar wind direction; the auroral oval shifts quickly in latitude; and the aurora is often not centred on the magnetic pole nor closed on itself. In response to a large increase in solar wind dynamic pressure5 Saturn's aurora brightened dramatically, the brightest auroral emissions moved to higher latitudes, and the dawn side polar regions were filled with intense emissions. The brightening is reminiscent of terrestrial aurorae, but the other two variations are not. Rather than being intermediate between the Earth and Jupiter, Saturn's auroral emissions behave fundamentally differently from those at the other planets."

Human kallikrein genes encode for secreted serine proteases, translated as inactive preproenzymes. The signal peptide is removed upon entrance into the secretory pathway, and the additional cleavage of the inhibitory prosegment is required for the enzymes to become enzymatically active (1Khan A.R. James M.N. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 815-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). For activation, 14 of the 15 kallikreins (except hK4) require cleavage after lysine (hK6, hK7, hK8, hK12, hK13, hK14, and hK15) or arginine (hK1, hK2, hK3, hK5, hK9, hK10, and hK11).

Using an hK5-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method, we have recently shown that hK5 is a potential biomarker of ovarian and breast cancer (24Yousef G.M. Polymeris M.E. Grass L.

In addition, the involvement of hK5 in skin desquamation (18Brattsand M. Egelrud T. J. Biol.

To gain insights into the physiology and pathobiology of this serine protease, we produced recombinant hK5 and determined its substrate specificity and interactions with plasma inhibitors. Furthermore, we examined its ability to cleave different plasma and extracellular matrix components. Materials—7-Amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) was purchased from Sigma. The following synthetic AMC substrates were purchased from Bachem Bioscience (King of Prussia, PA): Boc-Phe-Ser-Arg-AMC (FSR-AMC), Boc-Val-Pro-Arg-AMC (VPR-AMC), H-Pro-Phe-Arg-AMC (PFR-AMC), Z-Gly-Gly-Arg-AMC (GGR-AMC), Boc-Leu-Gly-Arg-AMC (LGR-AMC), Boc-Leu-Lys-Arg-AMC (LKR-AMC), Boc-Leu-Arg-Arg-AMC (LRR-AMC), Boc-Gln-Arg-Arg-AMC (QRR-AMC), Boc-Gln-Ala-Arg-AMC (QAR-AMC), Boc-Gln-Gly-Arg-AMC (QGR-AMC), Tos-Gly-Pro-Arg-AMC (GPR-AMC), Tos-Gly-Pro-Lys-AMC (GPK-AMC), Boc-Glu-Lys-Lys-AMC (EKK-AMC), Boc-Val-Leu-Lys-AMC (VLK-AMC), and Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-AMC (AAPF-AMC). The substrate Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC (LLVY-AMC) was purchased from the Peptide Institute Inc. (Osaka, Japan). All substrates were diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) at a final concentration of 80 mm and stored at –20 °C. The protease inhibitors, α1-antitrypsin (AAT), α1-antichymotrypsin (ACT), antithrombin (AT), α2-antiplasmin, and α2-magroclobulin (α2M) were purchased from Calbiochem and their purity was ≥95% as verified by SDS-PAGE. All inhibitors were diluted in water at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml and stored at –20 °C. Fluorescent conjugates of bovine skin collagen type I, human placenta collagen type IV, and human plasma fibrinogen were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The substrates mouse sarcoma collagen type I, chicken sternal cartilage collagen type II, calf skin collagen type III, human placenta collagen type IV, human foreskin fibroblast fibronectin, human plasma vitronectin, laminin, low molecular weight kininogen and plasminogen were purchased from Sigma. Cloning and Expression of the Pro-form of hK5 in Pichia pastoris— The cDNA encoding pro-hK5 was cloned by the OneStep™ reverse transcriptase-PCR kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) using total RNA isolated from the 70N normal breast cell strain. The primers used for PCR amplification were: GGCTCGAGAAAAGAGCCCGGTCGGATGAC (forward) and GTGCGGCCGCCTGGGATGACTGAGGAGTTGGCC (reverse). Restriction sites (underlined) for the endonucleases XhoI and NotI were used for cloning. The PCR product was cloned into the P. pastoris expression vector pPIC9 (Invitrogen) between the 5′ promoter and the 3′ terminator of the AOX1 gene in-frame with the yeast α-mating factor. The P. pastoris strain KM71 was stably transformed with the expression construct using the Pichia Expression Kit (Invitrogen). Expression of the recombinant protein was induced by methanol, at 30 °C, and monitored with SDS-PAGE analysis of the cell culture supernatant. Purification of Recombinant hK5—Purification of hK5 was achieved with cation-exchange fast performance liquid chromatography followed by reversed-phase high perfrmance liquid chromatography. Concentrated yeast culture supernatant (×10) diluted 1:2 with running buffer (10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.3) was loaded onto a 5-ml CM FF-Sepharose cation exchange column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was eluted with 10 mm sodium acetate and 1 m NaCl, pH 5.3, with a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl. Fractions were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and those containing hK5 were pooled, supplemented with 1% trifluoroacetic acid, and loaded onto a 1-ml Vydac C4 reverse phase column by using deionized H2O, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Elution was performed with acetonitrile (AcCN), 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid with a linear gradient of 0–100% AcCN. The concentration of the purified recombinant hK5 was determined by using an hK5-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a total protein assay. The purity of the protein was verified by SDS-PAGE. Mass Spectrometry and NH2-terminal Sequencing—Mass spectrometric analysis for positive identification of hK5 was performed as previously described (28Luo L.Y. Grass L. Howarth D.J. Thibault P. Ong H. Diamandis E.P. Clin. Chem. 2001; 47: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). NH2-terminal sequencing was performed with the Edman degradation method. Proteins were transferred by electroblotting to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and visualized with Coomassie Blue stain. The bands were excised and applied to the sequencer. Glycosylation Analysis—hK5 deglycosylation was performed as described previously (29Borgono C.A. Grass L. Soosaipillai A. Yousef G.M. Petraki C.D. Howarth D.H. Fracchioli S. Katsaros D. Diamandis E.P. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 9032-9041PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, denatured hK5 in 5% SDS, 10% mercaptoethanol, was incubated with peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) in 0.5 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 10% Nonidet P-40 surfactant. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Deglycosylated hK5, as well as horseradish peroxidase and soybean trypsin inhibitor (controls), were subjected to SDS-PAGE in two separate gels. One gel was stained with SimplyBlue Safe-Stain (Invitrogen) and the other with GelCode® Glycoprotein staining kit (Pierce). Zymography—Gelatin (Novex® 10% Zymogram, Gelatin, Invitrogen) and casein (Novex 12% Zymogram, Casein, Invitrogen) zymography were performed as described previously (30Ghosh M.C. Grass L. Soosaipillai A. Sotiropoulou G. Diamandis E.P. Tumor Biol. 2004; 25: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, hK5 was mixed with Tris glycine SDS sample buffer and run for 90 min at 125 V at 4 °C. After electrophoresis, the gels were incubated in renaturing buffer for 30 min at room temperature, followed with incubation in developing buffer at 37 °C overnight. Gels were stained with SimplyBlue Safe-Stain (Invitrogen). Areas of protease activity appeared as clear bands against a dark blue background. Enzymatic Activity Assays and Kinetic Constant Determination— hK5 (12 nm) was incubated at 37 °C, in a microtiter plate, with assay buffer (100 mm phosphate, 0.01% Tween 20, pH 8.0) and varying concentrations (0.06–3 mm) of fluorescent substrates in a final volume of 100 μl. The initial rate of AMC release was measured on a Wallac Victor fluorometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) set at 355 nm for excitation and 460 nm for emission. Enzyme-free reactions were used as negative controls. All experiments were done in triplicate. A standard curve with known concentrations of AMC was used to calculate the rate of product formation. The Michaelis-Menten constants were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis using the Enzyme Kinetics Module 1.1 (Sigma Plot, SSPS, Chicago, IL). Inhibition Assays—The reactions for the calculation of the secondrate constants of hK5 activity inhibition by serpins were performed under pseudo-first order conditions, as previously described (31Kitz R. Wilson I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3245-3249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Schapira M. Scott C.F. Colman R.W.

Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, hK5 was incubated in microtiter wells with various concentrations of the serpins AAT, ACT, AT, and α2-antiplasmin, at room temperature with gentle agitation for different time points. Ten microliters of the above mixture were added in 240 μl of 0.1 mm VPR-AMC in assay buffer. The reaction was performed in a microtiter plate at 37 °C and the initial rate of AMC release was measured as described above. To monitor the hK5-serpin complex formation, the enzyme was incubated at 1:1, 1:5, and 1:10 molar ratios with the different inhibitors at 37 °C for 30 min, run on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and stained with Coomassie Blue. The inhibition of hK5 by the high molecular weight inhibitor α2M was monitored by using a fluorescent conjugate of fibrinogen. hK5 (12 nm) was incubated with α2M (12 to 1200 nm) in a microtiter plate for 30 min at 37 °C at a final volume of 100 μl, with gentle agitation. After incubation, 2.5 μl of conjugated fibrinogen (1.5 mg/ml) was applied and fluorescence was measured every 10 min for 2 h on a Wallac Victor fluorometer set at 492 nm for excitation and 535 nm for emission. Enzyme-free reactions were used as negative controls. All experiments were done in triplicate. Biotinylation of ECM Components (Collagen Type I, II, III, IV, Laminin and Fibronectin)—Each component was diluted in 0.5 m phosphate buffer, pH 9.2, at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml and dialyzed overnight in 4 liters of the same buffer at 4 °C. Each component was mixed with 100 μl of biotin (stock solution, 1 mg/ml in Me2SO) in 1.5-ml tubes and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The mixture was then dialyzed again for 3 days in 4 liters of phosphate buffer at 4 °C with changes of buffer twice a day. Digestion of Biotinylated ECM and Plasma Components—Five micrograms of collagen types I, II, III, and IV were incubated in assay buffer (final volume 25 μl) for various time points (0.25 to 8 h) with 150 ng of hK5 at room temperature. Similarly, the substrates fibronectin (5 μg), laminin (5 μg), plasminogen (5 μg), fibrinogen (0.5 μg), vitronectin (0.5 μg), and kininogen (0.5 μg) were incubated with 100 ng of hK5 at 37 °C. The reactions were terminated by freezing in liquid nitrogen. Enzyme-free reactions were used as negative controls and incubated for 8 h at room temperature. Silver staining (Invitrogen) was then performed for the substrates plasminogen, kininogen, fibrinogen, and vitronectin, whereas Western blotting was performed for the biotinylated substrates as described previously (34Kapadia C. Ghosh M.C. Grass L. Diamandis E.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 1084-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Digestion of the Conjugates of Collagen I and IV, and Fibrinogen— One microgram of hK5 was incubated in microtiter wells with 2.5 μl of the conjugates of collagen types I and IV (1 mg/ml) and fibrinogen (1.5 mg/ml), in assay buffer (final volume 200 μl) at room temperature. Fluorescence was measured every 10 min for 2 h on the Victor fluorometer set at 492 nm for excitation and 535 nm for emission. Enzyme-free reactions were used as negative controls and background fluorescence was subtracted from each value. All experiments were done in triplicate. Molecular Cloning, Purification, and Glycosylation Analysis of Recombinant Human Pro-hK5—The full-length cDNA encoding pro-hK5 was amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR using total RNA isolated from the 70N normal breast cell strain, cloned into the pPIC9 vector in-frame with the yeast α-mating factor, and successfully transformed into KM71 strain of the yeast, P. pastoris. The secretion of hK5 into the yeast culture supernatant was monitored with SDS-PAGE; highest levels were seen after 4 days induction with methanol (data not shown). After a two-step purification procedure, we obtained recombinant hK5, with purity ≥95%, as verified by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A). The yield of recombinant protein was 1.5 mg of purified protein per liter of yeast culture, as measured with both an hK5-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and total protein assay. The identity of hK5 was verified by tandem mass spectrometry. Pre-pro-hK5 consists of 293 amino acids and contains a predicted signal peptide of 29 amino acids (Met1–Ala29) and an activation peptide of 37 amino acids (Ala30–Arg66) (17Yousef G.M. Diamandis E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37511-37516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mass of pro-hK5 inferred from the primary sequence is about 26 kDa, after purification we obtained four bands corresponding to molecular masses of ∼44, ∼40, ∼35, and ∼30 kDa (Fig. 1A). The NH2-terminal sequence of all four bands was found to be Ile-Ile-Asn-Gly-Ser-Asp, which corresponds to the NH2-terminal sequence of the active, mature form of hK5. This pointed to the possibility that hK5 may be able to autoactivate. However, enzymatically active yeast recombinant hK5 was unable to cleave the propeptide and activate mammalian recombinant pro-hK5 produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells (data not shown). It is thus likely that hK5 is activated in the supernatant by a yeast protease. After subjecting the four forms of recombinant hK5 to in vitro deglycosylation by PNGase F and staining with Coomassie Blue, we observed that the four bands co-migrated as a smaller molecular mass band of ∼26 kDa (Fig. 1B, lane 2), indicating that recombinant hK5 is differentially glycosylated. A duplicate of the aforementioned gel, including horseradish peroxidase glycoprotein as a positive control (Fig. 1C, lane 4) and the non-glycosylated protein soybean trypsin inhibitor as a negative control (Fig. 1C, lane 5), was subjected to glycoprotein staining. In vitro deglycosylation abolished staining of glycosylated forms of hK5 with acidic fuchsin sulfite (Fig. 1C, lane 2). Zymography—To determine whether the four bands corresponding to differentially glycosylated forms of hK5 represented active forms of the enzyme, both gelatin and casein zymograms were performed. The results showed that all bands were active and able to digest efficiently both casein (Fig. 2A) and gelatin (Fig. 2B). pH Optimum for the Enzymatic Action of hK5—The pH dependence of the hK5 enzymatic activity was checked in two buffer systems, i.e. 100 mm phosphate and 50 mm Tris buffer with 100 mm NaCl. The pH of 8.0 was optimal for both systems, although hK5 was 2.5 times more active in phosphate buffer. Similarly, hK5 showed 1.25 times higher activity when we used 0.01% Tween 20 instead of 0.2% bovine serum albumin as carrier in the reaction mixture. Therefore, we used the following assay buffer for further kinetic studies: 100 mm phosphate, 0.01% Tween 20, pH 8.0. Determination of Substrate Specificity and Steady-state Kinetic Constants—Fluorogenic tripeptide substrates with the AMC leaving group were used to characterize the enzymatic activity of recombinant hK5 and determine its steady-state kinetic constants. We used 16 substrates, of which 14 were candidate substrates for trypsin-like enzymes (11 with Arg and 3 with Lys at P1 position), and two for chymotrypsin-like enzymes, with Tyr and Phe at P1 position. Results are presented in Table I. As predicted by the presence of Asp239, close to Ser245 of the catalytic triad, hK5 was confirmed to have trypsin-like, but not chymotrypsin-like activity, because no reaction was observed for the two substrates (Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-AMC, Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC) specific for chymotrypsin-like enzymes. Comparison of the kcat/Km for substrates Tos-Gly-Pro-Arg-AMC and Tos-Gly-Pro-Lys-AMC (Table I) indicates that hK5 exhibits a much higher preference for Arg at position P1 relative to Lys (according to the notation of Schechter and Berger (35Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4755) Google Scholar)). However, cleavage of the substrate Boc-Val-Leu-Lys-AMC, indicates that hK5 could cleave after Lys but to a much lesser extent. Comparison of the kcat/Km ratio for the substrates that have the same amino acids in positions P1 and P3 (Boc-Gln-Ala-Arg-AMC, Boc-Gln-Gly-Arg-AMC, Boc-Gln-Arg-Arg-AMC and Boc-Leu-Lys-Arg-AMC, Boc-Leu-Arg-Arg-AMC, Boc-Leu-Gly-Arg-AMC) revealed that hK5 prefers Ala and Lys in the P2 position relative to Arg and Gly. Similarly, comparison of the kcat/Km for the substrates that have the same amino acids in positions P1 and P2 (Boc-Leu-Gly-Arg-AMC, Boc-Gln-Gly-Arg-AMC, Z-Gly-Gly-Arg-AMC and Boc-Leu-Arg-Arg-AMC, Boc-Gln-Arg-Arg-AMC, and Boc-Val-Pro-Arg-AMC, Tos-Gly-Pro-Arg-AMC) indicates that hK5 prefers Leu > Gln > Gly and Val > Gly in the P3 position. The best substrates for hK5 were found to be the Boc-Val-Pro-Arg-AMC, also a substrate for α-thrombin, and Boc-Phe-Ser-Arg-AMC, also a substrate for trypsin.Table ISteady-state kinetic analysis of hK5 with fluorogenic substratesSubstrateKmkcatkcat/KmActivitymmmin-1mm-1 min-1%Boc-Val-Pro-Arg-AMC0.20 ± 0.01196.76946.45100Boc-Phe-Ser-Arg-AMC0.19 ± 0.01169.50877.3792.7H-Pro-Phe-Arg-AMC1.77 ± 0.5728.1715.891.6Z-Gly-Gly-Arg-AMC0.31 ± 0.072.297.380.8Boc-Leu-Gly-Arg-AMC0.15 ± 0.015.1833.003.5Boc-Leu-Lys-Arg-AMC1.01 ± 0.1049.3848.895.2Boc-Leu-Arg-Arg-AMC0.48 ± 0.0518.6738.284.0Boc-Gln-Arg-Arg-AMC1.41 ± 0.1624.4017.211.8Boc-Gln-Ala-Arg-AMC0.61 ± 0.03106.97175.3318.5Boc-Gln-Gly-Arg-AMC0.57 ± 0.0510.8919.102.0Tos-Gly-Pro-Arg-AMC1.69 ± 0.3220.7712.221.3Tos-Gly-Pro-Lys-AMCNRaNR; no reaction.Boc-Glu-Lys-Lys-AMCNRaNR; no reaction.Boc-Val-Leu-Lys-AMC0.64 ± 0.174.567.070.75Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-AMCNRaNR; no reaction.Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMCNRaNR; no reaction.a NR; no reaction.

https://openalex.org/W2051292546,"The cover shows Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images of Saturn and its polar auroral emissions on 24, 26 and 28 January 2004. Visible wavelength images are combined with ultraviolet images of the south polar region. The strong brightening of the aurora on 28 January corresponded with a large disturbance in the solar wind. These images were obtained during a campaign by the Cassini spacecraft to measure the solar wind approaching Saturn and the Saturn kilometric emissions, and the combined results are presented in three letters in this issue. Saturn's aurorae differ in shape and form from those seen on Earth and on Jupiter, and they also differ in their response to the solar wind. Saturn's strongest radio emissions appear to be closely tied to the polar aurora. The interaction of the solar wind with Earth's magnetosphere gives rise to the bright polar aurorae and to geomagnetic storms1, but the relation between the solar wind and the dynamics of the outer planets' magnetospheres is poorly understood. Jupiter's magnetospheric dynamics and aurorae are dominated by processes internal to the jovian system2, whereas Saturn's magnetosphere has generally been considered to have both internal and solar-wind-driven processes. This hypothesis, however, is tentative because of limited simultaneous solar wind and magnetospheric measurements. Here we report solar wind measurements, immediately upstream of Saturn, over a one-month period. When combined with simultaneous ultraviolet imaging3 we find that, unlike Jupiter, Saturn's aurorae respond strongly to solar wind conditions. But in contrast to Earth, the main controlling factor appears to be solar wind dynamic pressure and electric field, with the orientation of the interplanetary magnetic field playing a much more limited role. Saturn's magnetosphere is, therefore, strongly driven by the solar wind, but the solar wind conditions that drive it differ from those that drive the Earth's magnetosphere."
https://openalex.org/W1995310127,"NGFI-B is a ligand-independent orphan nuclear receptor of the NR4A subfamily that displays important functional differences with its homolog Nurr1. In particular, the NGFI-B ligand-binding domain (LBD) exhibits only modest activity in cell lines in which the Nurr1 LBD strongly activates transcription. To gain insight into the structural basis for the distinct activation potentials, we determined the crystal structure of the NGFI-B LBD at 2.4-Å resolution. Superimposition with the Nurr1 LBD revealed a significant shift of the position of helix 12, potentially caused by conservative amino acids exchanges in helix 3 or helix 12. Replacement of the helix 11–12 region of Nurr1 with that of NGFI-B dramatically reduces the transcriptional activity of the Nurr1 LBD. Similarly, mutation of Met414 in helix 3 to leucine or of Leu591 in helix 12 to isoleucine (the corresponding residues found in NGFI-B) significantly affects Nurr1 transactivation. In comparison, swapping the helix 11–12 region of Nurr1 into NGFI-B results in a modest increase of activity. These observations reveal a high sensitivity of LBD activity to changes that influence helix 12 positioning. Furthermore, mutation of hydrophobic surface residues in the helix 11–12 region (outside the canonical co-activator surface constituted by helices 3, 4, and 12) severely affects Nurr1 transactivation. Together, our data suggest that a novel co-regulator surface that includes helix 11 and a specifically positioned helix 12 determine the cell type-dependent activities of the NGFI-B and the Nurr1 LBD.

NGFI-B is expressed in various tissues, notably the brain, and plays a role in multiple cellular events such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (13Liu Z.G. Smith S.W.

Nurr1 is almost exclusively expressed in brain, is essential for the development of midbrain dopaminergic neurons, and accordingly is also linked to Parkinson disease (17Zetterstrom R.H. Solomin L.

NRs typically contain two activation functions, one located in the N-terminal domain, termed AF1, and the other found in the ligand-binding domain (LBD), termed AF2. For the NR4A subfamily, the AF1 appears to play the predominant role in transcriptional activation and co-factor recruitment, and its activity can be regulated by phosphorylation (21Pekarsky Y. Hallas C. Palamarchuk A. Koval A. Bullrich F. Hirata Y. Bichi R. Letofsky J. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3690-3694Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 22Sohn Y.C.

Recent results show that the AF1 directly recruits co-activators such as members of the SRC family, p300, pCAF, and DRIP205 (25Wansa K.D. Harris J.M. Muscat G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33001-33011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 26Maira M. Martens C. Batsche E. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 763-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In comparison, the AF2 of NR4A receptors appears to be cell type-dependent, and significant differences have been observed for the transactivation efficiencies of Nurr1, NGFI-B, and NOR-1 (12Castro D.S. Arvidsson M. Bondesson Bolin M. Perlmann T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37483-37490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Importantly, the AF2 does not directly interact with SRCs, p300, pCAF, or DRIP205, and little is known about the regulation of its activity (12Castro D.S. Arvidsson M. Bondesson Bolin M. Perlmann T.

However, the co-repressor SMRT, the atypical orphan receptor DAX-1, and the SUMO ubiquitin ligase PIASγ have been reported to interact with the LBD of either NGFI-B or Nurr1, and play a role in AF2 regulation (22Sohn Y.C.

Lee K. Choi H.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1929-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Structural studies have shown that the LBD of NRs adopts a canonical fold mainly composed of 12 α-helices (H1–H12) (31Greschik H. Moras D. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2003; 3: 1573-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In the case of the classical NRs, the LBD undergoes significant conformational changes upon the binding of an agonist ligand, which leads to a repositioning of the “activation helix” (H12). These changes generate a hydrophobic co-activator binding cleft constituted by H3, H4, and H12, to which LXXLL-containing co-activators, such as SRCs, p300, or DRIP205, bind. The LXXLL region adopts an α-helical conformation with the leucine residues forming critical contacts with the hydrophobic LBD surface. The co-activator helix is further positioned by a “charge clamp” interaction with a lysine in H3 and a glutamic acid in H12, conserved in most NR LBDs (32Darimont B.D. Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W.

The NR4A subfamily is significantly different to the classical NRs described above. First, structure determination of the LBDs of Nurr1 and DHR38 revealed a class of ligand-independent NRs, whose putative ligand-binding pocket is filled with bulky aromatic and hydrophobic residues (27Wang Z. Benoit G. Liu J. Prasad S. Aarnisalo P. Liu X. Xu H. Walker N.P. Perlmann T. Nature. 2003; 423: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 28Baker K.D. Shewchuk L.M. Kozlova T. Makishima M.

Cell. 2003; 113: 731-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Next, in members of the NR4A subfamily, the conserved lysine in H3 is replaced by a glutamic acid, whereas the glutamic acid in H12 is replaced by a lysine residue (with the exception of an asparagine in H12 of DHR38) (12Castro D.S. Arvidsson M. Bondesson Bolin M. Perlmann T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37483-37490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Finally, in addition to this “inversed” charge clamp, the canonical co-activator cleft constituted by H3, H4, and H12 has a hydrophilic rather than hydrophobic topology, explaining the lack of binding of known LXXLL-containing co-activators (25Wansa K.D. Harris J.M. Muscat G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33001-33011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 27Wang Z. Benoit G. Liu J. Prasad S. Aarnisalo P. Liu X. Xu H. Walker N.P. Perlmann T. Nature. 2003; 423: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, mutagenesis studies provided evidence that H12 is essential for the cell type-dependent AF2 activity of NR4A receptors (11Murphy E.P. Dobson A.D. Keller C. Conneely O.M. Gene Expr. 1996; 5: 169-179PubMed Google Scholar, 12Castro D.S. Arvidsson M. Bondesson Bolin M. Perlmann T. J. Biol.

Gene Expr. 1998; 7: 1-12PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies also showed that the putative co-activator cleft constituted by H3, H4, and H12 does not play a role in co-activator recruitment and suggested that Nurr1 activity is correlated with regulated, ligand-independent stabilization of the Nurr1 LBD (27Wang Z. Benoit G. Liu J. Prasad S. Aarnisalo P. Liu X. Xu H. Walker N.P. Perlmann T. Nature. 2003; 423: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). However, from these results, the question about a direct involvement of H12 in transactivation and the location of the co-regulator surface remained elusive. Here we report the crystal structure of the rat NGFI-B LBD at 2.4-Å resolution. The NGFI-B LBD adopts an active conformation, and the putative ligand-binding pocket is filled with bulky aromatic and hydrophobic side chains as observed for the LBD crystal structures of Nurr1 and DHR38 (27Wang Z. Benoit G. Liu J. Prasad S. Aarnisalo P. Liu X. Xu H. Walker N.P. Perlmann T. Nature. 2003; 423: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 28Baker K.D. Shewchuk L.M. Kozlova T. Makishima M. Hassell A. Wisely B. Caravella J.A. Lambert M.H. Reinking J.L. Krause H. Thummel C.S. Willson T.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Cell. 2003; 113: 731-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Overall, the LBDs of NGFI-B and Nurr1 superimpose well with the exception of a significantly shifted H12 (about 2.8 Å). Structure comparison suggests that conserved amino acid exchanges in H3 or H12 partly account for the distinct H12 positions. Swapping the entire H11-H12 region of NGFI-B into Nurr1 reduces the AF2 activity of Nurr1 to NGFI-B levels, whereas the reverse swap results in a modest increase in activity of the NGFI-B LBD. Mutation of individual residues in H3 or H12 of Nurr1 to the corresponding residues of NGFI-B (mutant M414L or L591I, respectively) significantly reduces the cell type-dependent activity of the Nurr1 LBD. Finally, mutation of hydrophobic surface residues in the H11-H12 region severely affects Nurr1 transactivation. Together, these data provide evidence that a specific H12 position and a novel co-regulator surface determine the cell type-dependent AF2 activities of NGFI-B and Nurr1. Recombinant Plasmids—The cDNAs encoding the LBDs of human Nurr1 (Swiss-Prot accession number P43354) and rat NGFI-B (Swiss-Prot accession number P22829) cloned in pET-15b (Novagen) are gifts from Hiroshi Ichinose. Wild-type or mutant cDNA fragments encoding the Nurr1 LBD (residues 362–598) or NGFI-B LBD (residues 354–597) were generated by PCR and cloned into the eukaryotic expression plasmid pCMX-Gal4. From pCMX-Gal4, the respective cDNA is expressed in fusion with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (residues 1–147). Details of the cloning of these plasmids are available upon request. The plasmids pCMX-RXRα and pCMX-VP16-RXRα (resulting in expression of full-length human RXRα in fusion with the VP16 activation domain) were gifts from Roland Schüle. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—COS-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and gentamycin. Transient transfection assays were carried out using the standard calcium phosphate co-precipitation technique in 24-well plates (Greiner) with 0.5 × 105 cells/well. Cells were transfected with 250 ng of Gal4(3×)-TK-LUC reporter plasmid (containing three Gal4 binding sites in front of the thymidine kinase promoter and the firefly luciferase reporter), 100 ng of pCH110 encoding β-galactosidase (Amersham Biosciences), and 25 ng or 100 ng of wild-type or mutant pCMX-Gal4-NGFI-B or pCMX-Gal4-Nurr1 expression plasmid per well. The empty plasmid pCMX-Gal4 served as control. Co-transfection experiments involving RXRα expression plasmids were carried out with 25 ng of wild-type or mutant pCMX-Gal4-Nurr1 and 75 or 150 ng of pCMX-RXRα (in the absence or presence of 10-8m RXR agonist BMS649) or pCMX-VP16-RXRα per well. Cells were lysed with passive lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured in a Luminometer MicroLumat LB96P (EG&G Berthold) according to the manufacturer's instructions and normalized to β-galactosidase activity according to a standard protocol. All experiments were repeated at least three times. Protein Production and Purification—The hexahistidine-tagged rat NGFI-B LBD (residues 354–597; 29,227 Da including tag) was produced from pET-15b (Novagen) in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. After sonication of the bacterial pellet and ultracentrifugation, the recombinant protein was first purified by nickel affinity chromatography using a HiTrap chelating column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole) on a BioLogic work station (Bio-Rad) at 4 °C. After three wash steps of the resin with buffer A, the protein was eluted by increasing the imidazole concentration to 200 mm and then further purified by gel filtration using a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences). The NGFI-B LBD monomer eluted in buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol) from the gel filtration column at the expected position as a single peak. The fractions containing purified protein (estimated purity from silver-stained SDS gels >95%) were pooled and concentrated to about 6 mg/ml. The correct mass was confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry under denaturing conditions. Protein Crystallization, Data Collection, and Processing—Crystallization of the NGFI-B LBD (concentrated to about 6 mg/ml in buffer B) was carried out with the sitting drop vapor diffusion method in 96-well CrystalQuick™ plates (Greiner) (1.5 μl of protein solution plus 1.5 μlof reservoir against 150 μl of reservoir) using a Tecan Work station 150. Diffraction quality crystals were found using the Index™ screen (Hampton Research). Refinement of crystallization conditions was attempted but did not yield better quality crystals with respect to the initial condition. Crystals grew within a few days in sitting drops at 17 °C with a reservoir containing 3.0 m NaCl and 0.1 m BisTris (pH 5.5) and were cryoprotected in dried paraffin oil. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the Swiss Light Source (Villigen, Switzerland). The data were integrated and scaled using the XDS program package (35Kabsch W. J. Appl.

Structure Determination, Refinement, and Comparison—The crystal structure of the NGFI-B LBD was solved by molecular replacement with AMoRe (36Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and comprises residues 362–541 and 549–594. Data collection and structure refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. For structure comparison the Cα traces of the NGFI-B, Nurr1 (Protein Data Bank code 1OVL), and DHR38 models were superimposed either completely or partially from the beginning of H1 to the end of H11 (residues 362–578 in NGFI-B, 363–579 in Nurr1, and 321–532 in DHR38) using the lsq commands of O and default parameters. Partial superimpositions were chosen to exclude the significantly shifted H12 from the calculation of the root mean square deviation. The figures were generated with Pymol (44DeLano W.L.

As expected from sequence homology with Nurr1 and DHR38 (27Wang Z. Benoit G. Liu J. Prasad S. Aarnisalo P. Liu X. Xu H. Walker N.P. Perlmann T.

Instead, the space is filled with bulky aromatic or hydrophobic residues (Phe405 (H3), Leu409 (H3), Leu443 (H5), Phe446 (H5), Phe478 (loop H6-H7), and Trp481 (H7)) conserved within the NR4A subfamily (Fig. 1B). The LBDs of NGFI-B and its Drosophila ortholog DHR38 superimpose well in most parts with a root mean square deviation of 1.16 Å over 215 atoms (1.14 Å over 199 atoms for superimposition from H1 to H11). We note a certain degree of positional deviation for the β-sheet, H7, and H10 and an approximately 1.5-Å shift of H12 relative to DHR38. Furthermore, the loop between H1 and H3, which is five amino acids longer in NGFI-B, adopts a conformation distinct from that in DHR38. NGFI-B and Nurr1 Differ Significantly in the H11-H12 Region—Superimposition of the LBDs of NGFI-B and Nurr1 results in a root mean square deviation of 1.24 Å over 211 atoms (1.12 Å over 201 atoms for superimposition from H1 to H11). Both structures superimpose well in most parts of the LBD including loop regions, with the exception of H10, H11, and H12 (Fig. 2, A and B). Most interestingly, the Cα traces diverge increasingly from H11 to the C terminus of the LBD, such that H12 of NGFI-B is shifted by about 2.8 Å relative to H12 of Nurr1. The H12 shift is accompanied by a slight rotation along the helical axis. Further comparisons show that all three crystallized members of the subfamily (NGFI-B, Nurr1, and DHR38) diverge in the H12 region, although the H12 shift is most prominent for NGFI-B and Nurr1 (Fig. 2D and data not shown). These significant differences are unexpected given the high sequence conservation in the H11-H12 region of the three proteins (Fig. 2E). A detailed inspection of the crystal structures suggested that Met414 in H3 of Nurr1 (Leu413 in NGFI-B) may in part account for the H12 shift, since it is in contact with Ile587 in H12 (corresponding to Ile586 in NGFI-B) (Fig. 2, A and B). Alternatively, the methionine-to-leucine exchange in H3 may be secondary to other amino acid differences in the H11-H12 region, such as A586P or L591I (Nurr1 numbering). However, the H11-H12 region of NGFI-B is involved in a crystal contact, which theoretically could also influence H12 positioning (Fig. 2C). The crystal contact covers a hydrophobic patch on the NGFI-B surface that is localized around Phe573 (H11) and Phe591 (H12). Strikingly, the H11-H12 regions of DHR38 and Nurr1 (three of six molecules present in the asymmetric unit (AU)) form a very similar crystal contact (Fig. 2D). H12 of the other three Nurr1 molecules in the AU is involved in a different crystal contact (data not shown). Superimposition of all six Nurr1 molecules reveals that the largest deviation between Cα atoms of H12 is around 1 Å (data not shown), suggesting that the crystal contacts have only a minor influence on the position of H12.

Recently, the gene encoding the catalytic subunit of VKOR was identified as a 163-amino acid integral membrane protein. In this study we report the experimentally derived membrane topology of VKOR. Our results show that four hydrophobic regions predicted as the potential transmembrane domains in VKOR can individually insert across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane in vitro. However, in the intact enzyme there are only three transmembrane domains, residues 10–29, 101–123, and 127–149, and membrane-integration of residues 75–97 appears to be suppressed by the surrounding sequence. Results of N-linked glycosylation-tagged full-length VKOR shows that the N terminus of VKOR is located in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen, and the C terminus is located in the cytoplasm. Further evidence for this topological model of VKOR was obtained with freshly prepared intact microsomes from insect cells expressing HPC4-tagged full-length VKOR. In these experiments an HPC4 tag at the N terminus was protected from proteinase K digestion, whereas an HPC4 tag at the C terminus was susceptible. Altogether, our results suggest that VKOR is a type III membrane protein with three transmembrane domains, which agrees well with the prediction by the topology prediction program TMHMM.

The K vitamins, phylloquinone (K1), menaquinones (K2), and menadione (K3), are a family of structurally similar, fatsoluble, 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinones. The main function of vitamin K is to act as a co-factor for the γ-glutamyl carboxylase that catalyzes the post-translational carboxylation of specific glutamic acid to γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) 1The abbreviations used are: Gla, γ-carboxyglutamic acid; VKOR, vitamin K epoxide reductase; VKORC1, vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1; TM, transmembrane; HPC4, peptide epitope comprising residues; EDQVDPRLIDGK, ER endoplasmic reticulum; RM, canine rough microsomes; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid, hemisodium salt; CHAPS, (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)di-methylammonio]-1-propane sulfonate); Endo H, endoglycosidase H; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride. of variety of vitamin K-dependent proteins (1Presnell S.R. Stafford D.W. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2002; 87: 937-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Members of the vitamin K-dependent protein family include coagulation factors (factor II, VII, IX, X) as well as several other proteins that function in bone metabolism (2Price P.A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1988; 8: 565-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and signal transduction (3Manfioletti G. Brancolini C. Avanzi G. Schneider C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4976-4985Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Concomitant with γ-glutamyl carboxylation, the reduced form of vitamin K (vitamin K hydroquinone) is converted to vitamin K 2,3-epoxide, which must be converted back to vitamin K hydroquinone for the reaction to continue because of limited vitamin K amounts in vivo (4Furie B. Bouchard B.A. Furie B.C. Blood. 1999; 93: 1798-1808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This cyclic conversion of vitamin K establishes a redox cycle known as the vitamin K cycle (5Saxena S.P. Israels E.D. Israels L.G. Apoptosis. 2001; 6: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). VKOR is responsible for the conversion of vitamin K 2,3-epoxide into vitamin K and is highly sensitive to inhibition by coumarin drugs, such as R,S-warfarin (4-hydroxy-3-(3-oxo-1-phenylbutyl-coumarin)), the most commonly prescribed oral anticoagulant. Warfarin inhibition of VKOR reduces the availability of reduced vitamin K, which reduces the rate of carboxylation and leads to partially carboxylated, inactive vitamin K-dependent proteins. Since its discovery in 1970 (6Bell R.G. Matschiner J.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1970; 141: 473-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), numerous futile attempts to purify the enzyme were reported (7Mukharji I. Silverman R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Attempts to understand the mechanism underlying warfarin-sensitive vitamin K epoxide reduction have been somewhat more successful (8Lee J.J. Principe L.M. Fasco M.J.

FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2542-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Recently, the gene encoding VKOR was identified independently by our laboratory (16Li T. Chang C.Y. Jin D.Y. Lin P.J. Khvorova A. Stafford D.W. Nature. 2004; 427: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) and that of Johannes Oldenburg (17Rost S. Fregin A. Ivaskevicius V. Conzelmann E. Hortnagel K. Pelz H.J. Lappegard K. Seifried E. Scharrer I. Tuddenham E.G. Muller C.R. Strom T.M. Oldenburg J. Nature. 2004; 427: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). The enzyme was designated VKOR by us and VKORC1 by Oldenburg and co-workers, who assume that there is another sub-unit still to be identified (either view may be correct). VKOR is a 163-amino acid integral membrane protein with a mass of 18.2 kDa. To understand the structure/function relationships that define VKOR activity, it is necessary to understand its membrane topology, i.e. its specific number of TM segments and their location relative to the cytoplasm or endoplasmic reticulum. Several computer programs to predict the topology of membrane proteins are available (18Moller S. Croning M.D. Apweiler R. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 646-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar, 19Nilsson J. Persson B. von Heijne G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 20Melen K.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3698-3700Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). If the location of one of the termini is known, the best current program correctly predicts the topology of 65–70% of those membrane proteins with known crystal structure (20Melen K. Krogh A. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The reliability of a given topology prediction is increased if the predictions from a number of different programs agree (19Nilsson J. Persson B. von Heijne G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 20Melen K. Krogh A. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Moreover, using C-terminal reporter fusions, experimental examination of the topology is reliable (22Kim H. Melen K. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10208-10213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In this study, we report an experimental determination of the membrane topology of VKOR. We first determined the topology of VKOR using multiple prediction programs. These predictions were then tested by in vitro translation/cotranslocation of a series of VKOR truncations containing an N-linked glycosylation reporter tag. Our results suggest that VKOR is a type III membrane protein with three transmembrane domains. The N terminus of VKOR resides in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, and the C terminus resides in the cytoplasm. The N-terminal domain of VKOR, like many type III membrane proteins, is relatively short, which facilitates its transfer into the lumen (23Goder V. Spiess M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 504: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The main features of our in vitro experiments were confirmed by experiments with microsomes derived from insect cells expressing full-length VKOR. Materials—All oligonucleotide primers, the NuPAGE pre-cast gel, and the insect cell expression vector pVL1392 were from Invitrogen. The in vitro translation vector pSPUTK was obtained from Stratagene (San Diego, CA). The SP6 mMESSAGE mMACHINE capped mRNA transcription kit and MEGAClear RNA purification kit were obtained from Ambion (Austin, TX). Rabbit reticulocyte lysate, amino acid master mixture, proteinase K, and ribonuclease inhibitor were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). [35S]Methionine, [35S]cysteine, and the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection reagents were from Amersham Biosciences. MES, HEPES, CHAPS, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were from Sigma. BacVector-3000 DNA kit was from Novagen (Madison, WI). Taq polymerase and Endo H were from Roche Applied Science. Trans-Blot transfer medium PVDF membrane (0.2 μm) and biotinylated protein size markers were from Bio-Rad. All the restriction endonucleases and T4 DNA ligase were from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was from Jackson Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Dog pancreatic microsomal membranes were prepared as described (24Walter P. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Construction of Full-length VKOR Fusions with the NST Reporter Tag at the N or C Terminus—The gene encoding VKOR was amplified by PCR using pVL1392-VKOR (16Li T. Chang C.Y. Jin D.Y. Lin P.J. Khvorova A. Stafford D.W. Nature. 2004; 427: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) as the template. A 5′-NcoI site and 3′-PstI site was introduced into the PCR fragment, and the PCR product was cloned into the in vitro translation vector pSPUTK by NcoI/PstI to yield pSPUTK-VKOR. The N-terminal glycosylation acceptor tag with the amino acid sequence of MGGNSTGGSGGSGGSG was obtained by annealing the oligonucleotides 5′-CATGGGTGGGAACAGCACCGGTGGGAGCGGGGGCAGCGGGGGCAGCGG-3′ and 5′-CATGCCGCTGCCCCCGCTGCCCCCGCTCCCACCGGTGCTGTTCCCACC-3′ followed by ligation to NcoI-digested pSPUTK-VKOR. Joining the vector and the insert by ligation destroys the NcoI site at the 3′ end of the insert. This plasmid was named pSPUTK-NST-VKOR. A C-terminal glycosylation acceptor tag with the amino acid sequence of SGGSGGSNSTGGSG was obtained by annealing the oligonucleotides 5′-AAGCGGGGGCAGCGGTGGGAGCAACAGCACCGGGGGTAGCGGTCTGCA-3′ and 5′-GACCGCTACCCCCGGTGCTGTTGCTCCCACCGCTGCCCCCGCTTTGCA-3′ followed by ligation to PstI-digested pSPUTK-VKOR. In this case ligation of the PstI-cleaved pSPUTK-VKOR to the insert results in the destruction of the PstI site at the 5′ end of the insert. This plasmid is named pSPUTK-VKOR-NST. A dimer C-terminal glycosylation tag was engineered by first ligating the insert itself and then ligating the product to PstI-digested pSPUTK-VKOR plasmid to yield pSPUTK-VKOR-NST2. Construction of VKOR Truncations with NST Reporter Tag at the N Terminus—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to remove the endogenous BamHI site (without affecting the amino acid sequence) at 365 nucleotides of the VKOR cDNA from pSPUTK-NST-VKOR. The resulting plasmid was used as the PCR template to generate various C-terminal truncations of VKOR. A sense oligonucleotide comprising a NcoI site and part of the NST tag-coding sequence was used as 5′ primer for all the PCR reactions. Oligonucleotides containing a BamHI site and various antisense sequences corresponding to the C terminus of the predicted TM domains were used as 3′ primers for the PCR reaction. PCR-amplified fragments containing each of the predicted TM domains and the N-terminal glycosylation reporter tag were cloned into the NcoI/BamHI-cleaved pSPUTK vector. Construction of VKOR Truncations with NST Reporter Tag at the C Terminus—The C-terminal glycosylation acceptor tag with the sequence of SGGSGGSNSTGGSG was amplified by PCR using the above pSPUTK-VKOR-NST plasmid as template. A 5′-BamHI site and a 3′-EcoRI site were introduced into the PCR fragment, and the resulting PCR product was cloned to pSPUTK by BamHI/EcoRI to yield pSPUTK-NST. Various VKOR truncations (containing each of the predicted TM segments) were then amplified by PCR from the pSPUKT-NST-VKOR plasmid with the deleted endogenous BamHI site. The 5′ primer encoding the start sequence of VKOR includes a NcoI site. All the 3′ primers were the same as above. PCR products were cloned into NcoI/BamHI-cleaved pSPUTK-NST to yield different VKOR truncations with the glycosylation reporter tag at the C terminus. The 3′-BamHI (GGATCC) site introduced two amino acid residues (glycine and serine) between the VKOR truncations and the NST tag. Construct 1–74/98–130-NST was obtained by connecting the PCR fragment of 1–74 and 98–130. Fragment 1–74 was amplified by using the above 5′ primer and a 3′ primer containing part of the antisense sequence of VKOR ending at amino acid residue 74 with a XbaI site. Fragment 98–130 was amplified by a 5′ primer containing a XbaI site with part of the sense coding sequence of VKOR starting from residue 98 and the above 3′ primer used for VKOR truncation 1–130. The two obtained PCR fragments were ligated simultaneously with NcoI/BamHI-cleaved pSPUTK-NST vector to yield the construct of pSPUTK-NST-1–74/98–130. A C-terminal glycosylation tag with a sequence of NSTGGGS, which does not contain the flexible extension linker, was fused to the VKOR truncation of 1–130 by PCR to yield pSPUTK-1–130-NST′. The 5′ primer used is the same as above, and the 3′ primer contains part of the C-terminal antisense sequence of 1–130 VKOR truncation and the antisense sequence of the tag with a BamHI site. The PCR product was cloned to pSPUTK by NcoI/BamHI. All the constructs used for in vitro transcription/translation are shown in Fig. 2. Construction of the Full-length VKOR Fusions with HPC4 Tag at the N or C Terminus in Insect Cell Expression Vector—A 12-amino acid peptide (EDQVDPRLIDGK) of HPC4 epitope (25Stearns D.J. Kurosawa S. Sims P.J. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 826-832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was introduced to either the N or C terminus of full-length VKOR. The HPC4-tagged VKOR cDNA was subcloned into the EcoRI site of the insect cell expression vector of pVL1392. The nucleotide sequences of all the constructs were confirmed by the DNA sequencing facility at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In Vitro Transcription and Translation/Cotranslocation—Before in vitro transcription the recombinant pSPUTK vectors were linearized at the BamHI site immediately 3′ to the C terminus of all the N-terminal NST-tagged VKOR truncation fusions or at the EcoRI site immediately 3′ to the C terminus of all the C-terminal NST-tagged VKOR truncation fusions. Capped mRNA was synthesized by SP6 RNA polymerase and purified by MEGAClear RNA purification kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The transcription reaction was incubated at 37 °C for at least 5 h to increase the yield of mRNA. In vitro translations using rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and cotranslocations using RM were performed as described previously (26Tie J. Wu S.M. Jin D. Nicchitta C.V. Stafford D.W. Blood. 2000; 96: 973-978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reactions were performed at 25 °C for 30 min in a final volume of 20 μl containing 10 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate, 0.5 μl of ribonuclease inhibitor (40 units/μl), 0.4 μl of a 1 mmol/liter amino acid mixture without methionine and cysteine, 1.6 μl of [35S]methionine (3.7 × 1013 Bq (1000 Ci/mmol)) at 370 MBq (10 mCi/ml), 1.6 μl of [35S]cysteine (3.7 × 1013 Bq (1000 Ci/mmol)) at 370 MBq (10 mCi/ml), and 1 μg of capped mRNA with or without 1 eq of RM. The translation products were chilled on ice and mixed with 30 μl of buffer A containing 110 mmol/liter potassium acetate, 2.5 mmol/liter magnesium acetate, and 25 mmol/liter potassium-HEPES (pH 7.4). For deglycosylation, 1 μl of Endo H (1 milliunits/μl) and 1 μl of 5% CHAPS were added to a 10-μl aliquot of the diluted translation products and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Before being subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis, the samples were precipitated with 2 volumes of saturated (NH4)2SO4, washed with 5% trichloroacetic acid, and redissolved in 10 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Expression of HPC4-tagged VKOR in Insect Cells and Protease Digestion of VKOR Microsomes—Full-length VKOR molecules with a HPC4 tag at either the N or C termini were expressed in insect cells. Microsomes from cells expressing HPC4-VKOR or VKOR-HPC4 were prepared as described (27Mutucumarana V.P. Stafford D.W. Stanley T.B. Jin D.Y. Solera J. Brenner B. Azerad R. Wu S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32572-32577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Microsome protein concentrations were adjusted to 10 mg/ml. For protease digestion 2 μl of proteinase K (1 mg/ml) was added to a 10-μl aliquot of freshly prepared microsome in the presence or absence of 0.5% CHAPS as the final concentration. The reactions were carried out on ice for 2 h and terminated by adding phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to a final concentration of 3 mmol/liter. After protease digestion, the microsomes were washed 3 times with buffer A containing 3 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the pellets were dissolved in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. NuPAGE and Western Blot Analysis—NuPAGE analysis was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions under reducing conditions using 1× MES running buffer (50 mm MES, 50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% SDS (pH 7.3). Samples from the in vitro translation were subjected to 4–12% gradient NuPAGE. After electrophoresis the proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane (0.2 μm), and autoradiography was performed (Amersham Biosciences Storm 840 PhosphorImager). Samples of recombinant HPC4-taged VKOR microsome and protease-digested microsome were subjected to 12% Nu-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane as above. Protein bands were probed with anti-HPC4 monoclonal antibody followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and the protein bands were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blot reagents. Prediction of the Membrane Topology of VKOR by Different Computer-prediction Algorithms—The membrane topology of VKOR was predicted using seven different topology prediction programs (us.expasy.org/tools/#ptm) with the default parameters. The results are listed in Table I. As can be seen, five of the seven programs predict three TM domains in VKOR, PHD predicts two, and MEMSAT predicts four TM domains. The five programs that predict the location of the C terminus all agree that the C terminus of VKOR is located in the cytoplasm. All programs except PHD predict that the first TM domain comprises residues 10 through 29. The remaining TM domain predictions are somewhat variable for the different prediction programs. The combined candidate TM domains in VKOR predicted by all the programs used are 10–29, 75–97, 101–123, and 127–149. It has been reported that the reliability of topology predictions is greatly increased if different topology prediction methods give the same prediction (19Nilsson J. Persson B. von Heijne G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 20Melen K. Krogh A. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that VKOR has three TM domains with the C terminus located in the cytoplasm and N terminus located in the ER lumen. Fig. 1 shows the membrane topology prediction and the probability profile of VKOR by the most commonly used prediction program TMHMM. It predicts that VKOR has 3 TM domains, 10–29, 101–123, and 127–149, with the orientation of Nexoplasmic/Ccytoplasmic. One candidate TM domain (75–97), predicted by other programs but not by TMHMM, is indicated in Fig. 1.Table IPrediction of membrane topology of VKOR by different membrane topology prediction programs Membrane topology of VKOR was predicted by different predication programs using the default parameters.

J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used in this study to experimentally determine the membrane topology of VKOR. A conserved N-linked glycosylation acceptor site (NST) was introduced at either the N or C termini of the full-length VKOR or various VKOR truncations. According to the predicted membrane topology of VKOR, only nine amino acid residues precede the first candidate TM domain. Moreover, if the last predicted TM domain ends at residue149, as predicted by TMHMM and MEMSAT, only 13 C-terminal amino acid residues protrude from the membrane. It has been reported that half-maximal glycosylation occurs when the acceptor Asn is 10∼14 residues away from the membrane (28Nilsson I.M. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Nilsson I. Saaf A. Whitley P. Gafvelin G. Waller C. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1165-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Therefore, we added flexible amino acid linkers to extend the Asn glycosylation acceptor site away from the membrane. The amino acid sequence of the N-terminal NST tag is MGGNSTGGSGGSGGSG, and the C-terminal NST tag sequence is SGGSGGSNSTGGSG. The above extended NST tags were joined to the N or C terminus of full-length VKOR and to all of the VKOR truncations except when otherwise stated. In addition, we fused a dimer C-terminal NST tag at the C terminus of full-length VKOR (VKOR-NST2). To examine whether the predicted TM region of 75–97 or 101–123 is the authentic TM domain, we deleted the predicted TM region of 75–97 in the fusion of 1–130-NST (1–75/98–130-NST). In addition, we fused a NST glycosylation tag without the flexible linker (NST-GGGS) immediately to the C terminus of VKOR truncation 1–130. All the constructs used are shown in Fig. 2. In Vitro Translation/Cotranslocation of the NST-tagged Fulllength VKOR Fusions—Fig. 3 shows the autoradiograph of the in vitro translation of the full-length VKOR and NST-tagged full-length VKOR in the presence and absence of RM. As can be seen, N-terminal tagged VKOR, NST-VKOR, is glycosylated in the presence of RM, and the glycosylation product is sensitive to Endo H treatment, which specifically cleaves N-linked core sugars. This result indicates that the N terminus of VKOR is located in the ER lumen. In contrast, neither C-terminal tagged VKOR (VKOR-NST or VKOR-NST2) is glycosylated (Fig. 3), suggesting that the C terminus of VKOR is located in the cytoplasm. These results together suggest that VKOR is a type III membrane protein with the orientation of Nexoplasmic/Ccytoplasmic, and it has an odd number of TM domains. This agrees with the topology model predicted by five of the seven topology prediction programs listed in Table I. In addition, neither of the two natural potential glycosylation sites in the VKOR sequence, Asn-77 and Asn-142, is glycosylated; this is consistent with the prediction of TMHMM, which indicates that Asn-77 is located on the cytoplasm side of the membrane, and Asn-142 is located within the membrane. Determination of the Signal-anchor Potential of the Predicted TM Domain by in Vitro Translation/Cotranslocation—According to the computer-generated predictions, there are four potential TM segments in VKOR sequence. Therefore, C-terminal truncations of VKOR were made after each of the predicted potential TM segments. The N-linked glycosylation reporter tag was fused to either the N terminus or the C terminus of these truncations (Fig. 2). Fig. 4 shows the in vitro translation/cotranslocation results obtained from these NST-tagged VKOR truncations in the presence and absence of RM and the proposed topological orientation. As can be seen, NST-1–40 was glycosylated, but 1–40-NST was not, indicating that the first predicted TM segment, 10–29, can function as a reverse signalanchor sequence, characteristic of type III membrane protein. Both fusions of NST-1–100 and 1–100-NST were glycosylated, indicating that both the N and C termini are located in the ER lumen with the hairpin structure. Together with the result of fusion 1–40, this result suggests that the second predicted TM domain, 75–97, can function as a signal-anchor sequence. However, both fusions of NST-1–130 and 1–130-NST, which has one more predicted TM domain than fusion 1–100, are also glycosylated, indicating that they have the same topological orientation as fusion 1–100. This result raises the question of whether the additional predicted TM domain of 101–123 in the fusion of 1–130 functions as the signal anchor sequence. Predicted TM Region of 101–123 Functions as a Genuine TM Domain—To examine whether the predicted TM region of 101–123 functions as a genuine TM domain, we deleted the potential TM region of 75–97 in the fusion of 1–130-NST (1–75/98–130-NST) (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 5A, the C-terminal glycosylation tag can be glycosylated in the presence of RM, indicating that the C terminus is located in the lumen of ER. Together with the result of fusion 1–40, this result suggests that the predicted TM region of 101–123 functions as a genuine TM domain in the fusion 1–75/98–130-NST. In a further attempt to determine which of the potential TM domains, 75–97 or 101–123, functions as the genuine TM domain in the VKOR truncation 1–130, a glycosylation reporter tag with the sequence of NSTGGGS was fused to the C terminus of VKOR-1–130 (1–130-NST′). This places the Asn glycosylation acceptor site immediately after the predicted TM segment 101–123. According to the “minimum glycosylation distance” rule (28Nilsson I.M. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Nilsson I. Saaf A. Whitley P. Gafvelin G. Waller C. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1165-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), this tag should not be glycosylated if 101–123 functions as the stop-transfer sequence in this construct. On the other hand, if 75–97 serves as a TM domain, this tag should be glycosylated since there is enough extension sequence between the Asn acceptor site and the TM segment. As shown in Fig. 5B, no glycosylated product was detected in the presence of RM. This result suggests that the predicted TM segment 101–123 is the functional TM domain in the VKOR truncation 1–130, but 75–97 does not. Independent Determination of the Topological Orientation of N and C Termini of VKOR in Vivo—To determine the topological orientation of the N and C termini of VKOR in vivo, we constructed two full-length recombinant VKOR molecules tagged with a HPC4 epitope at either end, HPC4-VKOR and VKOR-HPC4. Both VKOR constructs expressed in insect (Sf9) cells displayed kinetic parameters characteristic of the nontagged VKOR, indicating correct folding of the recombinanttagged enzymes (data not shown).

https://openalex.org/W2578973551,"Some parasitic wasps can locate their insect hosts by intercepting their chemical communications. An intriguing refinement of this technique has now been discovered. The tiny wasp Trichogramma brassicae intercepts an anti-aphrodisiac passed from male to female large white butterflies during mating, to make them less attractive to rival males. A wasp detecting the odour of a mated female butterfly first hitches a ride, then parasitizes the new-laid eggs. This strategy, if widespread, could severely limit the evolution of sexual communication between hosts. To locate their hosts, parasitic wasps can ‘eavesdrop’ on the intraspecific chemical communications of their insect hosts1,2,3. Here we describe an example in which the information exploited by the parasitic wasp Trichogramma brassicae is a butterfly anti-aphrodisiac that is passed from male to female Pieris brassicae butterflies during mating, to render them less attractive to conspecific males4,5,6. When the tiny wasp detects the odour of a mated female butterfly, it rides on her (Fig. 1) to her egg-laying sites and then parasitizes the freshly laid eggs. If this fascinating strategy is widespread in nature, it could severely constrain the evolution of sexual communication between hosts."

Their circadian rhythms consist of the localization, interaction, and accumulation of various proteins, including KaiA, KaiB, KaiC, and SasA. We have determined the 1.9-Å resolution crystallographic structure of the cyanobacterial KaiB clock protein from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. This homotetrameric structure reveals a novel KaiB interface for protein-protein interaction; the protruding hydrophobic helix-turn-helix motif of one subunit fits into a groove between two β-strands of the adjacent subunit. A cyanobacterial mutant, in which the Asp-Lys salt bridge mediating this tetramer-forming interaction is disrupted by mutation of Asp to Gly, exhibits severely impaired rhythmicity (a short free-running period; ∼19 h). The KaiB tetramer forms an open square, with positively charged residues around the perimeter. KaiB is localized on the phospholipid-rich membrane and translocates to the cytosol to interact with the other Kai components, KaiA and KaiC. KaiB antagonizes the action of KaiA on KaiC, and shares a sequence-homologous domain with the SasA kinase. Based on our structure, we discuss functional roles for KaiB in the circadian clock.

In cells, proteins involved in the circadian clock interact with other clock components, sometimes self-assemble, and take part in a complex protein network with the right timing, placement, and organization to create and maintain a robust rhythm. Meanwhile, the clock core is adjusted by exogenous factors, e.g. light. In any organism, biological phenomena defined as a circadian clock have three characteristic features: a free running periodicity of about 24 h, phase resetting by environmental cues, and temperature compensation of the period. The proper associations among individual clock proteins are essential, but their interplay with each other can be subtle and difficult to decipher. Cyanobacteria, the evolutionary predecessors of chloroplasts, are both the simplest photosynthetic cells and the most primitive organisms that maintain a circadian clock. The circadian clock gene cluster, kaiABC, was originally discovered and cloned from the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 (6Ishiura M. Kutsuna S. Aoki S. Iwasaki H. Andersson C.R. Tanabe A. Golden S.S. Johnson C.H. Kondo T. Science. 1998; 281: 1519-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Interestingly, kaiB and kaiC homologues of unknown function have been discovered in Archaea and Proteobacteria, but the three kai genes have very different evolutionary histories (7Dvornyk V. Vinogradova O. Nevo E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2495-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In S. elongatus PCC7942, however, inactivation of any single kai gene abolishes the circadian rhythms (6Ishiura M. Kutsuna S. Aoki S. Iwasaki H. Andersson C.R. Tanabe A. Golden S.S. Johnson C.H. Kondo T. Science. 1998; 281: 1519-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). The KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC proteins can associate in all possible combinations, including self-assembly in vitro and in vivo (8Iwasaki H. Taniguchi Y. Ishiura M. Kondo T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1137-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Crystal and solution structures of cyanobacterial KaiA domains reveal a dimer with tight interactions (9Williams S.B.

In the structure of the full-length KaiA dimer, the two independently folded domains are connected by a canonical linker with domain swapping (11Ye S. Vakonakis I. Ioerger T.R. LiWang A.C. Sacchettini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20511-20518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The two domains of the KaiC protein, which belongs to the family of ATPase/GTPase homologues, stack into a dumbbell shape and assemble into a symmetric double-layered hexameric ring in an ATP-dependent manner (13Vakonakis I.

Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 375-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The histidine kinase designated SasA closely associates with the cyanobacterial clock machinery, and is necessary for maintaining robust circadian rhythms, although the SasA gene lies outside the kaiABC cluster (16Iwasaki H. Williams S.B. Kitayama Y. Ishiura M. Golden S.S. Kondo T. Cell. 2000; 101: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Interestingly, SasA contains a KaiB-like sensory domain that mediates binding of SasA to KaiC. The Kai and SasA proteins dynamically associate into heteromultimeric protein complexes in a circadian fashion (19Kageyama H. Kondo T. Iwasaki H. J. Bio. Chem. 2003; 278: 2388-2395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). KaiA enhances KaiC phosphorylation and KaiB attenuates KaiA-enhanced KaiC autokinase activity (17Kitayama Y. Iwasaki H. Nishiwaki T. Kondo T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2127-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 18Xu Y. Mori T. Johnson C.H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2117-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The KaiB function as an attenuator of KaiC phosphorylation requires the presence of KaiA, suggesting that a heteromultimeric KaiABC protein complex would be formed following the KaiA-KaiC interaction. In in vitro studies, the KaiA dimer interaction with the KaiC hexamer was suggested to vary from 1:1 (two molecules of KaiA against six molecules of KaiC) to up to 2:1, depending on ATP hydrolysis by KaiC. It is still unknown how KaiB stoichiometrically interacts with the KaiA-KaiC complex. Recently, a crystal structure of the Anabaena KaiB homologue was determined, showing that the KaiB homologue is a dimer in the crystal as are the KaiA structures (12Garces R.G. Wu N. Gillon W. Pai E.F. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1688-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it was shown in vivo that the KaiC-based complex changes in size in response to day and night, accompanied by the night-specific interaction with KaiA and KaiB (19Kageyama H. Kondo T. Iwasaki H. J. Bio. Chem. 2003; 278: 2388-2395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In the cyanobacterial cell, although the amount of KaiA is constant, KaiB and KaiC exhibit robust circadian rhythms, being the most abundant at the early circadian night phase (circadian time 15–16). The amount of KaiB and KaiC changes rhythmically with the KaiB:KaiC ratio up to 2:1 (17Kitayama Y. Iwasaki H. Nishiwaki T. Kondo T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2127-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), even though these two genes form an operon (6Ishiura M. Kutsuna S. Aoki S. Iwasaki H. Andersson C.R. Tanabe A. Golden S.S. Johnson C.H. Kondo T. Science. 1998; 281: 1519-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Kitayama et al. (17Kitayama Y. Iwasaki H. Nishiwaki T. Kondo T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2127-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) showed that KaiB protein is localized in both the cytosol and the membrane, suggesting that a KaiB regulatory link between subcellular localization and protein-protein interactions is important in the cyanobacterial clock system. The KaiB protein is essential to the circadian rhythm of cyanobacteria: rhythmicity disappearing in the kaiB null mutant (6Ishiura M. Kutsuna S. Aoki S. Iwasaki H. Andersson C.R. Tanabe A. Golden S.S. Johnson C.H. Kondo T. Science. 1998; 281: 1519-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Because most kaiB mutants showed a short period phenotype (6Ishiura M. Kutsuna S. Aoki S. Iwasaki H. Andersson C.R. Tanabe A. Golden S.S. Johnson C.H. Kondo T. Science. 1998; 281: 1519-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar), hypomorph mutations are likely to shorten the period. Although genetic evidence shows a key role for KaiB in pacemaking, the biochemistry of KaiB function is poorly understood. Here we report the crystallographic structure of the KaiB tetramer from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, identify interesting structural features, including the (i) positively charged perimeter, (ii) negatively charged center, and (iii) zipper of aromatic rings, and discuss their implications for KaiB function. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a mutation at the tetrameric interface affects the clock, suggesting that the inability to form this newly identified tetrameric complex may cause abnormality in the circadian rhythm. Expression and Purification of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 KaiB— The Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 kaiB gene was introduced into a pET11a (Novagen) vector. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed by this plasmid were grown at 30 °C and protein expression was induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The cells were disrupted by sonication, and the supernatant was applied to anion exchange (Poros 20 HQ), cation exchange (Poros HS), and gel filtration (S-200 26/60) columns. The anion and cation exchange columns did not bind the cyanobacterial protein, whereas the other E. coli-derived proteins were efficiently removed. The protein yield was 30 mg/liter. Purified KaiB protein was concentrated by Amicon Centriprep (Millipore) to 10 mm in a solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm EDTA, and stored at -80 °C. Dynamic Light Scattering—Dynamic light scattering studies were performed at 20 °C by using a DynaPro 99 instrument (Protein Solutions, Inc.). Scattering of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 KaiB was analyzed at 10 mm in the storage buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm EDTA). The DynaPro 99 instrument measures fluctuations in the intensity of scattered laser light caused by the Brownian motion of molecules in solution. Reported scattering values are the averages of 30 scans, each including measurements at 20 different time points between 3 and 3000 μs. Data were analyzed with DYNAMICS version 5.5.56.38 software (Protein Solutions, Inc.). The scattering data are fitted with an exponential autocorrelation function, which is used to determine the molecular translational diffusion coefficient, DT, and to assess the polydispersity of the sample (Table I). The radius of hydration, RH, is then calculated by using the equation DT = kT/6πηRH, where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is temperature in Kelvin, and η is the solvent viscosity. RH is defined as the radius of a hypothetical hard sphere that diffuses with the same speed as the particle under examination. But macromolecules are non-spherical and solvated. Therefore, the molecular weight (Mr) of a macromolecule is estimated by using Mrversus RH calibration curves developed from standards of known molecular weight and size. Thus, the Mr estimate of a given particle is subject to error if it deviates from the shape and solvation of the molecules used as standards. The molecular weight for protein macromolecules is estimated from a curve that fits the following Mr = [1.6800·RH]2.3398, as implemented in the software.

The 2-microliter drop, containing a 1:1 ratio (v/v) of protein (10 mm in storage buffer) to reservoir solution (below) was equilibrated against 500 ml of a reservoir solution containing 60–80% saturated betaine and 100 mm imidazole/malate buffer (pH 6.0). Crystals grown at 4 °C diffracted to higher resolution than those grown at room temperature, giving diffraction data to 1.9-Å resolution data at SSRL Beam Line 7-1.

NUC42 and NUC43 were used as wild type and ΔkaiABC deletion strains, respectively. The S. elongatus PCC7942 kaiB8 (D90G) mutant was originally isolated from a PCR-based random mutagenesis library at the kaiB locus. 1T. Oyama, Y. Nakahira, S. Takeuchi, and T.

Overall Tetrameric KaiB Structure—We obtained our best diffraction quality crystals of Synechocystis KaiB by using trimethylglycine, also known as betaine, as a precipitant. Synechocystis KaiB also crystallized as thin plates from PEG 400 under conditions resembling those used for crystallization of Anabaena KaiB (12Garces R.G. Wu N. Gillon W. Pai E.F. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1688-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), but these crystals diffracted poorly. The KaiB crystals grown from betaine belong to space group P212121 with unit cell dimensions a = 52.8 Å, b = 66.0 Å, c = 114.8 Å, and four 105-residue KaiB polypeptide chains per asymmetric unit, giving a 41% solvent content (Table II). The four subunits (two dimers) in each asymmetric unit of the crystal compose half of two tetramers. Dynamic light scattering experiments (Fig. 1 and Table I) also indicated that Synechocystis KaiB (11.9 kDa) in aqueous solution is predominantly (∼90%) in a single assembly state (polydispersion ∼10%), corresponding to a tetramer (hydrodynamic radius of 3.25, apparent molecular weight of 53.2). In the crystal, pairs of KaiB dimers related by non-crystallographic symmetry interact to form a flattened tetramer (dimensions of 48 × 67 × 28 Å) (Fig. 2, A and B). Pairs of anti-parallel α-helices form each of the four sides of a square box, which resembles the Japanese character “Kai,” meaning cycle. This box is filled with four β-sheets and the top and bottom are each half-covered by two pairs of α-helices.Fig. 2Overall structure of tetrameric Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 KaiB. A, Synechocystis KaiB, shown as a ribbon diagram, forms flattened (side view) and Kai-like (top view) structure: α-helices, green; β-strands, yellow; coil, pink. B, tetrameric Synechocystis KaiB assembles from two symmetric homodimers. We define the dimer interface as Interface I, and the interface between dimers as Interface II. C, electrostatic potential surface for tetrameric KaiB complex reveals characteristic features: a positively charged rim (side view) and a negatively charged cluster at the center of one Kai face (top and bottom views). Electrostatic potential color code is from red, -2.0 kT/e, to blue, +2.0 kT/e.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The electrostatic potential surface of tetrameric KaiB reveals a pattern of positive charges with functional implications (Fig. 2C). Positively charged residues are located around the perimeter of the box: Lys6, Arg23, Lys26, Lys29, Lys49, Arg74, Lys75, Arg83, and Lys85. Eight glutamates, Glu55, Glu56, Asp95, and Glu96 of two facing molecules, make a negatively charged cluster at the center of the tetramer. Along the diagonal, four aromatic residues, Tyr8, Phe36, Tyr40, and Tyr94, line the interface between dimers (Fig. 3, A and B). At the end of these aromatic zipper residues, Tyr94 packs against a cluster of three consecutive prolines (Pro70–Pro71–Pro72), forming additional hydrophobic interactions that connect the tetramer (see Fig. 5B).Fig. 5Synechocystis KaiB assembly interfaces. A, the dimer interface (Interface I) is meditated by main chain hydrogen bonds joining symmetry related Ile59 residues to form a anti-parallel β sheet from β3 of each subunit: molecule 3 main chain, pale yellow; molecule 3 side chains, green; molecule 4 main chain, purple; molecule 4, side chains, yellow. B, Interface II, between dimers within the tetramer, is made by fitting a helix-turn-helix motif into the groove between β3 and β4 of the adjacent subunit: molecule 1 main chain, red; molecule 1 side chains, green; molecule 4 main chain, purple; molecule 4 side chains, yellow. C and D, comparison between Synechocystis KaiB (red) and Anabaena KaiB (yellow) in the tetrameric structure complex.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also found five trimethylglycine (betaine) molecules bound to the KaiB tetramer, primarily through interactions of the trimethyl moiety with electronegative groups on the protein. Pairs of betaine molecules bind in hydrophilic environments at the interface between KaiB dimers near Gln34–Glu35–(Phe36)–Gln37 at diagonally opposed corners of the box-shaped KaiB tetramer (Fig. 3C). One trimethylglycine was uniquely bound at the end of the aromatic zipper in a negatively charged pocket between two KaiB dimers (Fig. 3, D and E). This negative pocket is surrounded with positive residues. KaiB Subunit Fold in the Tetramer—Each Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 KaiB subunit in the tetramer consists of three α helices and four β strands in the shape of a wedge (Fig. 4). The three longest β strands form a mixed β-sheet with N-terminal β1 in the center. β2 is parallel to β1, and β4 is anti-parallel to β1 and β2 (Fig. 4A). The two longest α helices (α1 and α3), which precede and are anti-parallel to β2 and β4, respectively, shield one side of this β-sheet. The shortest β strand (β3) hydrogen bonds with its symmetry mate across the dimer interface to form a small anti-parallel β-sheet, roughly perpendicular to the larger three-stranded β-sheet (Fig. 5A). Except for the five N-terminal and 10 C-terminal amino acids, the Synechocystis KaiB subunit is structurally well conserved with Anabaena KaiB (root mean square deviation of 1.27 Å for Cα) (Fig. 4B). This suggests that the core domain of KaiB homologues is structurally conserved throughout cyanobacteria (7Dvornyk V. Vinogradova O. Nevo E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2495-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In the Synechocystis KaiB tetrameric structure, the N termini have predominantly well ordered electron density (Fig. 4C). Based upon their location within the box-like tetramer (Fig. 2, A and B), the N termini are classified into two groups: inner and outer (Fig. 4D). The inner N termini protrude from the center of the Kai box (Fig. 2A), whereas the outer N termini hold the adjacent dimer, strengthening the tetrameric structure (Fig. 2B). KaiB Oligomeric Interfaces—The tetrameric KaiB structure (Fig. 2B) reveals two different interfaces for KaiB (Fig. 5). Interface I exhibits non-crystallographic 2-fold symmetry (Fig. 5A) and is closely related to the dimer interface in the Anabaena KaiB dimer structure (12Garces R.G. Wu N. Gillon W. Pai E.F. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1688-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the Synechocystis complex structure, this dimer interface is centered on the main chain, antiparallel, β-strand hydrogen bonds between Ile59 residues of β3 in each subunit, and is mediated by a loop from Leu48 to Ala61, encompassing β3. The Gln52 side chain makes a hydrogen bond with the backbone oxygen of Leu87. The backbone nitrogen of Leu53 makes a hydrogen bond with the Ile88 backbone oxygen. The carbonyl oxygen atoms of Glu55 and Asp57 are linked through a water molecule to the nitrogen of Ala61. In addition to these hydrophilic interactions, several hydrophobic interactions occur between Leu53 and Ile88, Leu53, and Ile59, and Ile59 and Ile59. Overall each subunit of the dimer buries almost 800 Å2 of surface area in Interface I. To assemble dimers into the KaiB tetramer, the helix-turn-helix motif between α2 and α3 (Thr62–Asp82) fits into a cleft between β3 and β4 (Interface II, Fig. 5B). Pro70 and Pro72 are in van der Waals contact with Phe36 and Tyr94, respectively. The Lys67 and Glu55 side chains form a salt bridge, and the Ile68 backbone oxygen interacts with Nζ of Lys58. Adding to these interactions between dimers, the Tyr40 hydroxyl forms hydrogen bonds with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Leu92 and Nζ of Lys58 through a water molecule. Residues Phe36, Tyr40, Tyr8, and Tyr94 from all four subunits form a zipper of aromatic residues across this tetramer interface (Fig. 3, A and B). At the edges of Interface II, the “outer” N termini stabilize the assembly of two KaiB dimers into the tetramer. The N terminus extends toward the outside of the Kai box and hooks to the adjacent dimer (Fig. 2, A and B). The Tyr8 hydroxyl makes a hydrogen bond with Glu35, and in one tetramer the Ser2 backbone oxygen and nitrogen make hydrogen bonds with the side chain of Gln34 (Fig. 5B). Overall, each dimer buries more than 1900 Å2 of surface area in Interface II to form the tetramer. Mutation at the Tetrameric Interface Disrupts the Circadian Clock—We identified an interesting kaiB mutant, with a substitution in the tetramer interface. This Asp → Gly mutant (position 90 in Synechococcus equivalent to position 91 in Synechocystis) exhibits arrhythmicity. 2T. Oyama, Y. Nakahira, S. Takeuchi, and T. Kondo, unpublished data. In the tetrameric Synechocystis structure, a salt bridge between Asp91 and Lys58 orients Lys to form hydrogen bonds across dimer-dimer Interface II to Tyr40 and the backbone oxygen of Ile68. By precluding this salt bridge and leaving an unsatisfied positive charge, the D90G substitution likely weakens or disrupts KaiB tetrameric assembly. To test the resultant phenotypic effect on circadian rhythm, we used the bioluminescence rhythm assay to monitor the mutant S. elongatus cells (Fig. 6). The parental wild type strain, which carries a luciferase reporter gene under control of the kaiBC promoter, exhibits normal circadian rhythmicity (Fig. 6A), whereas the kaiABC deletion mutant of this strain was arrhythmic (Fig. 6B, Ref. 5Johnson C.H. Nature. 2004; 430: 23-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Reintroduction of the wild type kaiABC locus restored normal rhythmicity (Fig. 6C), whereas introduction of the kaiABC locus carrying the D90G mutation in kaiB showed a severely impaired rhythmicity (a short free-running period; 19 h), which damped to arrythmicity in 3 days under continuous light conditions (Fig. 6D). These results suggest that disruption of the KaiB tetramer severely diminishes the molecular function of KaiB. Structural Analysis of the KaiB Monomer—The structures of KaiABC proteins provide the basis for mutational mapping to help decipher protein function and protein-protein interactions (9Williams S.B.

During inflammation, differentiation, or oncogenic transformation, the life span of monocytes is prolonged by preventing the activation of the apoptotic program. Here we showed that caspase-3, a cysteine protease required for monocyte apoptosis, is a phosphoprotein. We identified protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ) as a member of the protein kinase C family that associates with and phosphorylates caspase-3. The PKCδ-dependent phosphorylation of caspase-3 resulted in an increase in the activity of caspase-3. This effect of PKCδ is specific to caspase-3, as evidenced by the absence of similar effects on caspase-9. The activity of PKCδ precedes the activation of caspase-3 during spontaneous monocyte apoptosis and in monocyte-induced apoptosis. We found that the overexpression of PKCδ resulted in an increase of apoptosis, whereas its inhibition blocked caspase-3 activity and decreased apoptosis. Our results provided evidence that the PKCδ-dependent phosphorylation of caspase-3 provided a novel pro-apoptotic mechanism involved in the regulation of monocyte life span.

Apoptosis plays an essential role in the daily maintenance and development of the immune system by regulating the number of the cells. Monocytes, key components of innate immunity, circulate in the bloodstream for 24–48 h and, in the absence of an appropriate stimulus, die spontaneously (1Cline M.J. Lehrer R.I. Territo C. Golde D.W. Ann. Intern. Med. 1978; 88: 78-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Spontaneous monocyte apoptosis requires the activation of the apoptotic protease machinery (2Fahy R.J. Doseff A.I. Wewers M.D. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1755-1762PubMed Google Scholar). During inflammation, differentiation or malignant transformation and inflammatory and differentiation factors, including lipopolysaccharide and macrophage colony-stimulating factor, prolong monocyte survival (3Mangan D.F.

Monocyte apoptosis requires the activation of caspase-3, a member of the evolutionarily conserved cysteine-aspartate-specific protease family (2Fahy R.J. Doseff A.I. Wewers M.D. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1755-1762PubMed Google Scholar, 8Steller H. Science. 1995; 267: 1445-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (2419) Google Scholar). The caspases are constitutively expressed as inactive precursors. In response to an apoptotic stimulus, the precursors are converted into active caspases by proteolytic processing (9Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4084) Google Scholar). Caspase-3 is an “effector” caspase that requires two proteolytic cleavages to mature into an active enzyme (10Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3768) Google Scholar). The first proteolytic step is dependent upon the activity of “initiator” caspases, such as caspase-8 or -9 that cleave caspase-3 between the long (p17) and the carboxyl-terminal (p12) domains (11Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2417) Google Scholar, 12Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6112) Google Scholar). Generation of the active caspase-3 also requires a second cleavage, occurring between the prodomain and the p17 domain, a cleavage that has been suggested to be autocatalytic (13Roy S. Bayly C.I. Gareau Y. Houtzager V.M. Kargman S. Keen S.L. Rowland K. Seiden I.M. Thornberry N.A. Nicholson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6132-6137Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Given the central importance of caspases in the regulation of cell fate in the immune system, the activation of caspases is controlled by several mechanisms, including protein-protein interactions and post-translational modifications (14Doseff A.I. Stem Cells Dev. 2004; 13: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For example, caspase-3 activity is blocked by S-nitrosylation in human monocytes (15Zeigler M.M. Doseff A.I. Galloway M.F. Opalek J.M. Nowicki P.T. Zweier J.L. Sen C.K. Marsh C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12894-12902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and the denitrosylation of caspase-3 results in caspase-3 activation in B and T cell lines upon Fas-induced apoptosis (16Mannick J.B.

Phosphorylation is another well recognized mechanism of protein regulation that has been extensively implicated in apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 17Cross T.G. Scheel T.D. Henriquez N.V. Deacon E. Salmon M. Lord J.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). However, the involvement of kinases as direct modulators of caspases is just starting to be recognized. For example, the activation of caspase-9 is inhibited by phosphorylation by the serine-threonine kinase protein kinase B/Akt or by the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (18Cardone M.H. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Franke T.F. Stanbridge E. Frisch S. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (2704) Google Scholar, 19Allan L.A. Morrice N. Brady S. Magee G. Pathak S. Clarke P.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). In this context, macrophage colony-stimulating factor promotes monocyte survival through the inhibition of caspase-9 activation due to phosphorylation by Akt in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent manner (6Kelley T.W.

Although the role of signal transduction cascades in the regulation of apoptosis and cell fate establishment in myeloid cells is broadly accepted, the specific signaling events that regulate monocyte apoptosis remain unknown. Protein kinase C (PKC) constitutes a large family of serine/threonine protein kinases consisting of at least 10 different isoforms classified into three subgroups based on their cofactor requirements as follows: classical, novel, and atypical (21Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). The involvement of PKC in the regulation of apoptosis is well documented, functioning either as activators or inhibitors of apoptosis, depending on the particular cell type and the specific apoptotic stimulus (22Dempsey E.C.

J. 2003; 376: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). PKCδ, a member of the novel subclass, is abundantly expressed in human monocytes (24Monick M.M. Carter A.B. Gudmundsson G. Geist L.J. Hunnighake G.W. Biochem. J. 1998; 275: L389-L397Google Scholar) and one of the first substrates of caspase-3 to be identified (25Ghayur T. Hugunin M. Talanian R.V. Ratnofsky S. Quinlan C.

Activation of PKCδ during apoptosis was observed in several cell types in response to a variety of stimuli, and PKCδ promotes the apoptosis of neutrophils, myocytes, and etoposide-induced salivary gland acinar cells (26Khwaja A.

We demonstrate that caspase-3 associates with and is phosphorylated in vitro by PKCδ. We found that activation of PKCδ precedes caspase-3 activity during spontaneous and induced monocyte apoptosis, and the phosphorylation enhances caspase-3 activity. In addition, we show that overexpression of PKCδ increases apoptosis, whereas down-regulation of PKCδ expression prolongs monocyte survival, inhibits caspase-3 activation, and decreases caspase-3 phosphorylation. Taken together, these studies suggest that the PKCδ-dependent phosphorylation of caspase-3 provides a novel pro-apoptotic mechanism involved in the regulation of the monocyte life span. Cell Culture and Monocyte Purification—Human monocytes were purified by clumping, as described previously (2Fahy R.J. Doseff A.I. Wewers M.D. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1755-1762PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, fresh human monocytes were obtained from normal donors and diluted 1:1 with sterile saline solution. The solution was subsequently centrifuged through a Histopaque-1077 gradient column (Sigma) at 600 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The mononuclear layer was removed, washed, and spun twice in RPMI 1640 (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD), and the cells were counted. The cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640, 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) at a concentration of 5 × 107 cells/ml. Cells were rotated at 70 rpm on a horizontal rotor for 1 h at 4 °C to induce clumping and then sedimented by gravity for 20 min through 100% fetal bovine serum at 4 °C. The sedimented cells were subsequently washed twice in RPMI 1640 and resuspended in RPMI at a final concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml. The population of monocytes obtained was on average 70–80% pure as estimated by flow cytometry using an anti-CD14 marker (BD Biosciences). In all experiments monocytes were incubated at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml in serum-free RPMI 1640 at 37 °C in 5% CO2. THP-1 premonocytic cells and HeLa cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum in the presence of 50 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For the in vivo labeling experiments, cells were washed once with PBS and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in RPMI 5% serum in the absence of sodium phosphate. 107 cells/ml were labeled with inorganic phosphate (1 mCi/ml, specific activity 9120 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 4 h in RPMI 1640 containing phosphate at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Extract Preparation and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were pelleted and washed once with KPM buffer (50 mm KCl, 50 mm PIPES, 10 mm EGTA, 1.92 mm MgCl2, pH 7, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml cytochalasin B, and 2 μg/ml each of the protease inhibitors chymostatin, pepstatin, leupeptin, and antipain). Extracts were prepared by lysing the cells for 10 min on ice with Nonidet P-40 kinase extraction buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8, 10 mm sodium glycerophosphate, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm DTT, 100 μm PMSF, 2 μg/ml protease inhibitors). Extracts were then centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 × g in a microcentrifuge. Supernatants were aliquoted and kept at –70 °C for future use. Immunoprecipitations were carried out by rocking extracts with 10 μl (50% slurry) of monoclonal antibodies coupled to protein A-Sepharose™ (Amersham Biosciences) for 3 h at 4 °C. In vivo labeled cell lysates, obtained as described above, were immunoprecipitated in the presence of 0.1% SDS after a 15-min incubation at 55 °C. Monocyte cell extract equivalent to 2 × 108 cells was used per each immunoprecipitation reaction for the caspase-3 and PKCδ coimmunoprecipitation experiments. For PKCδ immunoprecipitation followed by in vitro kinase reaction shown in Fig. 3B, less than 2 × 106 THP-1 cells were used in each reaction. Antibodies or IgG isotype control were cross-linked to protein A beads as follows: 225 μl of antibodies were rocked with 1 ml of wet protein A beads for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were washed with 30 ml of 0.1 m triethanolamine (Sigma), pH 8.3, and then incubated for 4 h at room temperature with 50 mm dimethylpimelimidate (Pierce). The beads were spun down and incubated for 2 h with 0.1 m ethanolamine (Sigma). The beads were washed in a column with 150 ml of PBS followed by 150 ml of KPM buffer. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with RIPA kinase extraction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, 100 μm PMSF, 2 μg/ml of protease inhibitors). Beads were then washed two times with the kinase assay buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT). In Vitro Kinase Assays—After immunoprecipitation, kinase assays were performed by incubating the beads for 1 h at 37 °Cinthe presence of 20 μl of kinase assay buffer containing 0.75 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 0.5 mm ATP. To each reaction, 5 μg of histone H2B as exogenous substrate (Roche Applied Science) was added as exogenous substrate. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 10 μl of 5× Laemmli buffer. Samples were boiled for 5 min and loaded onto an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The kinase inhibitors utilized were genistein, AG126, UO126, bisindolylmaleimide I, Ro 31-8425, LY294002, PD98059, H-89 (Calbiochem), and staurosporine (Sigma). CKI-7 (CKI-7, N-(2-aminoethyl)-5-chloroisoquinoline-8-sulfonamide) was from Seikagaku America, Inc. (Falmouth, MA), and IC261 was from ICOS Corp. (Bothell, WA). Phosphorylation of human recombinant caspase-3 (rCasp-3) was achieved by using purified human PKCδ (Panvera, Invitrogen) as the kinase source. 250 ng of rCasp-3 expressed in Escherichia coli was added to 20 μl of kinase reaction mixture containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 500 nm ATP and 5 μCi of [γ-32P] ATP in the presence of 10 ng of human PKCδ. A mixture of phosphatidylserine (200 μg/ml final concentration) and diacylglycerol (20 μg/ml final concentration) was also added to the reaction as cofactors of PKCδ. The control reaction for Fig. 4 consists of the exactly same reaction set up except that PKCδ was boiled for 10 min before its addition onto the reaction mixture. Boiled PKCδ was unable to phosphorylate H2B or rCasp-3 in in vitro kinase assays (data not shown). The phosphorylation reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 1 h and was followed by SDS-PAGE. For the caspase-3 activation reaction to determine the effect of phosphorylation, first the phosphorylation was carried out as described above. Then the caspase-3 activation reaction was followed by addition of an equal volume of 2× caspase-3 activation buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 20% sucrose, 20 mm DTT and 2 mm PMSF) with 4 units/μl of recombinant caspase-9 (rCasp-9, Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA). In order to achieve an apparent stop of the kinase activity, the radioactive [γ32P]ATP present in the kinase reaction was quenched by adding 500 μm cold ATP at the onset of the activation reaction. The activation reaction was allowed to proceed at 37 °C and was stopped by adding 5× Laemmli buffer at a desired time point. Reactions of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated rCasp-3 were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and both the kinase activity and the caspase-3 activation kinetics were visualized by autoradiography and by Western blot analysis, respectively, after transferring the gel to a membrane. Preparation of Lysates and Detection of Caspase Activity—The presence of active caspase-3 was determined by using the 7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin assay (AFC) linked to the tetrapeptide DEVD as described previously (2Fahy R.J. Doseff A.I. Wewers M.D. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1755-1762PubMed Google Scholar). 250 ng of purified rCasp-3 were incubated with DEVD-AFC in a cyto-buffer (10% glycerol, 50 mm Pipes, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT) containing 20 μm DEVD-AFC. Activity of active rCasp-9 was determined by using 80 units per reaction (488 ng) by the cleavage of LEHD-AFC in a buffer containing 100 mm MES, pH 6.5, 10% PEG (Mr 3350), 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mm DTT. DEVD and LEHD-AFC were obtained from Enzyme Systems Products (Livermore, CA). Release of free AFC was determined by using a Cytofluor 4000 fluorometer (Perceptive Co., Framingham, MA; filters: excitation, 400 nm; emission, 505 nm). Immunoblots and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Monoclonal antibodies (clone 3-11) that recognize and immunoprecipitate caspase-3 have been described previously (31Kirsch D.G. Doseff A.I. Chau B.N. Lim D-S. de Souza-Pinto N.C. Hansford R. Kastan M.B. Lazebnik Y.A. Warkwick J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21155-21161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). For Western blots, anti-caspase-3 antibody (clone 4-18) was used as described previously (2Fahy R.J. Doseff A.I. Wewers M.D. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1755-1762PubMed Google Scholar). PKCδ and PKCα polyclonal antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). rCasp-3 carrying His6 tag at the amino terminus was generated by cloning full-length human caspase-3 into the expression vector pQE31 (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Cultures were induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at A550 0.5. After induction for 1 h at 20 °C, cells were lysed by sanitation in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1% Tween 20, and protease inhibitors (2 μg/ml chymostatin, pepstatin, leupeptin, antipain, and 1 mm PMSF). Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 17,000 × g, and the supernatant was allowed to bind to the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) in the presence of RNase (5 μg/ml) for 2 h at 4 °C. After binding, the beads were washed with 16 ml of the buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Tween 20, and 1 mm PMSF. The purification was made by batch elution with 1-ml aliquots of the step gradient imidazole dissolved in the wash buffer. Elution fractions containing rCasp-3 were identified by SDS-PAGE and further confirmed by caspase-3 activity assay and by Western blot analysis after dialysis against 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 10% sucrose, 5 mm DTT. Transient Transfection and siRNA—THP-1 cells were washed once in PBS and resuspended in the specified electroporation buffer (Amaxa, Cologne, Germany) to a final concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml. 0.5 μgof empty vector (pcDNA3-HA), vector containing wild type full-length PKCδ (pcDNA3-PKCδ-wt-HA), PKCδ, or a dominant negative mutant pcDNA3-PKCδ-DN-HA (32Page K.

After transfection, the cells were immediately transferred into 3 ml of RPMI medium and cultured for 1 day. Twenty four hours after transfection, the cells were treated with 1 μm etoposide (Sigma) for 8 h to induce apoptosis. For silencing experiments, HeLa or THP-1 cells were transfected with 150 nm siRNA-PKCδ (the siRNA sequences for targeting PKCδ were sense, 5′-GGCUGAGUUCUGGCUGGACTT-3′ on PKCδ (33Yoshida Y. Miki Y. Kufe R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48372-48378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) (Qiagen)), and the same duplex siRNA-PKCδ labeled with rhodamine (siRNA-PKCδ-R) or a random rhodamine-labeled-negative control (sense, 5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT-3′, Qiagen) was utilized. Forty hours after transfection, cells were treated with etoposide to induce apoptosis for 8 h as described above. Cells were then rinsed with PBS and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) for 5 min at room temperature and treated with 0.2% Triton X-100 (Bio-Rad) followed by rinse with PBS. Cells were stained with 0.5 μg/ml DAPI (Sigma) for 15 min at 4 °C. Percentage of apoptosis was determined by nuclear fragmentation of cells. Nuclear morphology of 200 cells in each experiment was visualized using Olympus fluorescence microscope and Image ProPlus software (excitation at 300 nm; emission at 461 nm). In silencing experiments only red cells were counted to determine their apoptotic status. Flow Cytometry—For flow cytometry studies, monocytes were purified by a CD14-positive selection and cultured for 16 h as described previously (20Doseff A.I. Baker J.H. Bourgeois T.A. Wewers M.D. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2003; 29: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). CD14-positive monocytes were washed with PBS and stained for annexin V-FITC and propidium iodine using the annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit following the manufacturer's specification (Pharmingen). Flow cytometry analysis was performed using BD Biosciences FACSCalibur using Cellquest version 3.3 software. Statistical Analysis—Results were expressed as means ± S.E. Data were analyzed using Student t test for Figs. 4, 6C, and 7B and by analysis of variance in Fig. 5C using the JMP-SAS statistical program.Fig. 7Silencing of PKCδ inhibits monocyte apoptosis.A, immunoblots using anti-PKCδ, anti-PKCα, or anti-β-tubulin antibodies from lysates of HeLa cells (mock, lane 1) or cells transfected with siRNA-Control-R (lane 2), siRNA-PKCδ (lane 3), and siRNA-PKCδ-R (lane 4). B, THP-1 cells transfected (red) with siRNA-Control-R (a, b, e, and f) or siRNA-PKCδ-R (c, d, g, and h) were left untreated (a, b, e, and f) or induced to undergo apoptosis for 8 h with 1 μm etoposide (c, d, g, and h) were stained with DAPI.

The kinase reaction products were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a membrane, and phosphorylated H2B was visualized by autoradiography. The kinase activity shown at the top was measured by PhosphorImager, and absolute quantitation is shown at the bottom. The same membrane was immunoblotted with anti-PKCδ antibody to ensure equal loading of the samples (lower panel). B, caspase-3 activity from monocytes extracts cultured as in A was measured by DEVD-AFC assay. C, freshly isolated human monocytes were cultured for 16 h in the presence of varying concentrations of staurosporine or 10 μm PD098059, and caspase-3 activity in the extracts was measured by the DEVD-AFC assay.

Biol. 2002; 26: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To assess whether caspase-3 is regulated by phosphorylation, we determined the phosphorylation status of endogenous caspase-3. For this purpose, 32P metabolically labeled THP-1 whole-cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-caspase-3 antibodies (Fig. 1). Two bands, one of 35 kDa and a second of 80 kDa (p35 and p80, Fig. 1A), were specifically visualized by autoradiography in the immunoprecipitates with the anti-caspase-3 antibodies (Fig. 1A, Casp-3) and were absent in the isotype control immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1A, Control). When the same blot was probed with the anti-caspase-3 monoclonal antibody, only one band co-migrating with p35 was observed (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that caspase-3 interacts with phosphorylated proteins in vivo. Because the p35 protein of 35 kDa corresponds to the size of the unprocessed precursor caspase-3 (34Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30761-30764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is specifically recognized in the immunoprecipitation and the subsequent Western blot, these results also suggest that caspase-3 is phosphorylated in vivo in monocytes. Caspase-3 Associates with a Kinase Activity—To investigate whether caspase-3 associates with a kinase activity, the endogenous caspase-3 from freshly isolated monocytes or THP-1 cells was immunoprecipitated with the anti-caspase-3 antibody and subjected to in vitro kinase assays in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, using H2B as a substrate. Endogenous caspase-3 from monocytes coprecipitated with a kinase activity capable of phosphorylating H2B (Fig. 2A, lane 2). In addition to the phosphorylated H2B, a 35-kDa phosphoprotein was recognized in the caspase-3 immunoprecipitated extracts (Fig. 2A, lane 2). This kinase activity was absent in immunoprecipitates performed with the isotype control (Fig. 2A, lane 1). When the same membrane was re-prob"
https://openalex.org/W2087968683,"The winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus) produces short, monomeric α-helical antifreeze proteins (type I AFP), which adsorb to and inhibit the growth of ice crystals. These proteins alone are not sufficiently active to protect this fish against freezing at –1.9 °C, the freezing point of seawater. We have recently isolated a hyperactive antifreeze protein from the plasma of the flounder with activity 10–100-fold higher than type I AFP. It is comparable in activity to the AFPs produced by insects, and is capable of conferring freeze resistance to the flounder. This novel AFP has a molecular mass of 16,683 Da and a remarkable amino acid composition that is >60% alanine. CD spectra indicate that the protein is almost entirely α-helical at 4 °C but partially denatures at 20 °C, resulting in a species with a moderately reduced helix content that is stable at up to 50 °C. This transformation correlates with irreversible loss of activity. Analytical ultracentrifugation (sedimentation velocity and equilibrium) indicates that the predominant species in solution is dimeric (molecular weight, 32,275). Size-exclusion chromatography reveals a 2-fold higher apparent molecular weight suggesting that this molecule has an unusually large Stokes radius. The axial ratio of the dimer calculated from the sedimentation velocity data is 18:1, confirming that this protein has an extraordinarily long, rod-like structure, consistent with a novel dimeric α-helical arrangement. The structural model that best fits these data is one in which the ∼195 amino acids of each monomer form one ∼290-Å long α-helix and associate via a unique dimerization motif that is distinct from that of the leucine zipper and any other coiled-coil.

The winter flounder is adapted to the harsh environment of the inshore North Atlantic, where it can live in ice-laden water at temperatures that potentially go as low as –1.9 °C, the freezing point of seawater. The flounder body fluids, which have an equilibrium freezing point of only –0.8 °C (1Scott G.K. Davies P.L. Kao M.H. Fletcher G.L. J. Mol. Evol. 1988; 27: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), resist freezing, and this has been attributed to the presence of antifreeze proteins (AFPs) 1The abbreviations used are: AFP, antifreeze protein; AFGP, antifreeze protein glycoproteins; AUC, analytical ultracentrifugation; CD, circular dichroism; DEAE, diethylaminoethyl; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; IAP, ice affinity purification; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight; TFE, trifluoroethanol; TH, thermal hysteresis. (reviewed in Ref. 2Fletcher G.L. Hew C.L. Davies P.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 359-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). An AFP (later named type I, Ref. 3Davies P.L. Hew C.L. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2460-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) was discovered in winter flounder 30 years ago (4Duman J.G. DeVries A.L. Nature. 1974; 274: 237-238Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and has been extensively studied. Type I AFPs are small alanine-rich proteins of 37–48 residues that form a single amphipathic α-helix (5Sicheri F. Yang D.S. Nature. 1995; 375: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), with an underlying 11-amino acid repeat (6Devries A.L. Lin Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 495: 388-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The 11-amino acid periodicity within the α-helix forms an alanine-rich face with intimate surface/surface complementarity to a pyramidal plane {20–21} of the ice lattice, which mediates ice binding (7Baardsnes J. Kondejewski L.H. Hodges R.S. Chao H. Kay C. Davies P.L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 8Davies P.L. Baardsnes J. Kuiper M.J. Walker V.K. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 2002; 357: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Like other AFPs, type I AFP is thought to prevent ice growth by an adsorption-inhibition mechanism (9Raymond J.A. DeVries A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2589-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar): when AFPs are bound to the surface of an ice crystal, the addition of water molecules to the ice lattice is restricted to the exposed surfaces between protein molecules. This forces the ice to grow in less thermodynamically favored curved surfaces, thus lowering the non-equilibrium freezing point. Interaction of the AFP with the {20–21} and equivalent pyramidal planes results in the formation of hexagonal bipyramidal ice crystals that remain stable indefinitely at temperatures between the equilibrium melting point and the lowered freezing point (10Knight C.A. Cheng C.C. DeVries A.L. Biophys. J. 1991; 59: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). However, when the latter temperature is exceeded, the supercooled crystal grows very rapidly. The difference between this depressed freezing point and the unaffected equilibrium melting point is termed the thermal hysteresis (TH) activity of an AFP solution. The type I AFP isoforms that are comprised of three 11-amino acid repeats (HPLC 6 and 8) produce a maximum TH activity of less than 1 Celsius degree at concentrations above 20 mg/ml, and are present in the flounder plasma at a concentration of ∼10–15 mg/ml, which produces a TH of ∼0.7 Celsius degree (1Scott G.K. Davies P.L. Kao M.H. Fletcher G.L. J. Mol. Evol. 1988; 27: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The four-repeat isoform (AFP-9) has higher specific TH activity, but is present at a much lower concentration, and therefore makes only a moderate contribution to the TH activity of the plasma (11Chao H. Hodges R.S. Kay C.M. Gauthier S.Y. Davies P.L. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1150-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The colligative freezing point depression produced by plasma solutes and the TH produced by AFPs are directly additive. However, even when these factors are combined, type I AFP is not sufficiently active to protect the flounder at temperatures as low as –1.9 °C. This implicates the presence of other antifreeze factors in the blood plasma of this fish that might explain its survival. Surprisingly, TH activity of freshly collected plasma is more than 2 Celsius degrees in fish caught in Newfoundland waters in the winter months (12Marshall C.B. Fletcher G.L. Davies P.L. Nature. 2004; 429: 153Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The ice crystals that formed in this plasma were more complex than the bipyramids produced by type I AFP and ranged from lemon shapes to elongated spindles (12Marshall C.B. Fletcher G.L. Davies P.L. Nature. 2004; 429: 153Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, if the plasma was warmed to room temperature and then assayed again, a substantial fraction of the TH activity was lost along with the unique lemon-shaped ice crystal morphology. This indicated that in addition to type I AFP, the plasma contained an unknown, highly active, thermolabile antifreeze factor. Here we describe the purification and characterization of this novel antifreeze protein. Purification of the 17-kDa AFP—Blood plasma was collected from winter flounder caught in Newfoundland waters at ambient winter temperatures, pooled, and immediately frozen. This sample was thawed at 4 °C and centrifuged to remove precipitate. On the basis of the observed thermolability of the newly discovered AFP, all purification steps were performed at 4 °C or below. Thawed winter flounder plasma (50 ml) was loaded onto a 1.8-liter (5.0 × 100 cm) Sephadex G-75 size-exclusion column and eluted with 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 7.9) at a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min and collected in 10-ml fractions. Fractions were assayed for TH using a Clifton nanoliter osmometer as described below. A large peak of TH activity eluting just after the void volume was associated with spindle-shaped ice crystals. The fractions from this region were pooled (total volume of 200 ml), and the AFP(s) they contained were further purified by three successive rounds of ice affinity purification (IAP) using a temperature gradient of –1 to –5 °C over 30 h (13Kuiper M.J. Lankin C. Gauthier S.Y. Walker V.K. Davies P.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 14Marshall C.B. Tomczak M.M. Gauthier S.Y. Kuiper M.J. Lankin C. Walker V.K. Davies P.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In this technique, a hemisphere of ice is slowly grown in a protein solution. The growing ice excludes solutes including most proteins, but AFPs adsorb to the surface of the ice, become overgrown, and are incorporated into the ice. Highly enriched AFPs can be recovered by melting the hemisphere. Because each ice fraction is of very low ionic strength because of the exclusion of salts, 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate was added to the melted ice fractions before proceeding with the subsequent round of IAP. The few contaminating proteins still present after IAP were removed by DEAE ion-exchange resin. The final ice fraction was made up to 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate (adjusted to pH 7.0 with HCl immediately prior to this purification step) and stirred with the resin at 4 °C. Contaminating proteins bound to the resin and were removed by centrifugation leaving the 17-kDa AFP in solution. Preparation of Type I AFP—The two peaks of activity that eluted later from the Sephadex G-75 size-exclusion column and were associated with hexagonal bipyramidal ice crystals (12Marshall C.B. Fletcher G.L. Davies P.L. Nature. 2004; 429: 153Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) were used as a source of type I AFP. The fractions associated with these peaks were pooled and loaded on an HPLC reversed-phase C18 column. The proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of Buffer B (80% acetonitrile, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) from 20 to 50%, and the mass of eluted proteins was measured by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Micromass Proteome Works System). Thermal Hysteresis (TH) Measurements—TH activity was assayed using a Clifton nanoliter osmometer as described previously (15Chakrabartty A. Hew C.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 1057-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Briefly, a small drop of solution was suspended in immersion oil and snap frozen by a rapid deep cooling cycle. The resulting multicrystalline ice was warmed slowly and melted until only one small ice crystal remained, at which point the equilibrium melting temperature was noted. The temperature was then lowered continuously at a rate of ∼40 mOsm per min (1 Osm = 1.86 Celsius degree) until the depressed freezing temperature was reached, at which point the crystal grew suddenly and rapidly. Images of a growing ice crystal in a 0.05 mg/ml AFP solution were captured with a Nikon CoolPix 4500 digital camera at a rate of 15 frames per second. TH values were measured in duplicate or triplicate. TH activity of the novel AFP was measured at six concentrations between 0 and 0.4 mg/ml. The protein was concentrated using a Centricon centrifugal concentrating device (3,000 MWCO) to produce the highest concentration assayed, and serial dilutions were made from this sample. The protein concentration of the master sample was determined by amino acid analysis (Advanced Protein Technology Centre, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON). Determination of N-terminal Sequence and Amino Acid Composition—After three rounds of IAP, the partially purified AFP was electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The band of apparent molecular weight 17,000 was cut out and used for N-terminal sequencing by Edman degradation (Advanced Protein Technology Centre, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON). Following the final purification step involving removal of impurities to DEAE-cellulose, an aliquot of the AFP solution was dried in a rotary vacuum concentrator for amino acid analysis and to determine the protein concentration. Size-exclusion Chromatography—To estimate the apparent molecular weight of the novel AFP in solution, purified protein was chromatographed on a Sephacryl S-300 column (Amersham Biosciences, 320 ml, 26 mm × 60 cm) that had been calibrated with the standard proteins thyroglobulin (bovine type I, 660,000), bovine serum albumin (66,000), and cytochrome c (bovine heart, 12,400) as well as blue dextran (2,000,000) (all from Sigma). The column was run with 150 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.9, at 1.0 ml/min at 4 °C using an AKTA Explorer FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). Fractions were assayed for absorbance at 230 nm and thermal hysteresis activity to determine the elution volume of the AFP. Because activity is lost at room temperature, a second sample was preincubated at room temperature for 1 h and run on the same column at 24 °C to determine how the apparent molecular weight is affected by the structural alterations underlying activity loss. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation experiments were performed at 4 °C on a Beckman XLI Analytical Ultracentrifuge using an AN50-Ti rotor. The sedimentation equilibrium runs using six-channel charcoal-Epon cells were performed for 48 h before equilibrium absorbance measurements were taken at 230 nm. A protein concentration of 0.07 mg/ml in 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) was centrifuged at seven speeds (26,000 rpm, 30,000 rpm, 34,000 rpm, 37,000 rpm, 40,000 rpm, 44,000 rpm, and 47,000 rpm). Molecular weight determinations involved global analysis of sedimentation data at different speeds. Molecular weights were calculated using Beckman XLI data analysis software in which absorbance versus radial position data were fitted to the sedimentation equilibrium equation using nonlinear least-squares techniques. The partial specific volume and density of the sample were calculated using the program SEDNTERP (16Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding A.J.R. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 90-125Google Scholar) from the amino acid sequence and buffer composition, respectively. It should be noted that sedimentation equilibrium measurements of molecular weight are unaffected by the shape of the molecule. Sedimentation velocity measurements using double sector charcoal-Epon cells equipped with quartz windows were performed at 4 °C on samples 0.07 mg/ml in 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) centrifuged at 37,000 rpm, and concentration distributions were determined using absorbance optics. Sedimentation coefficient distributions were determined using the program SEDFIT, which fits the sedimentation velocity data directly to the Lamm equation and uses mathematical methods to obtain a numerical solution to this equation (17Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3087) Google Scholar). SEDNTERP was used to calculate the hydration (0.4012 g/g of protein) and the partial specific volume (0.7392 ml/g). Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy (Secondary Structure)—CD Spectra were measured on an Olis Rapid Scanning monochromator with a DSM (digital subtractive method) CD module (Olis, Bogart, GA) using a quartz cuvette of 1-mm pathlength (Hellma 121-QS). The temperature of the cuvette was maintained by a circulating water bath (Julabo) controlled by a temperature sensor located in the cuvette holder. The protein sample was dialyzed extensively against 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) at 4 °C, and this dialysis buffer was scanned repeatedly to establish an average baseline circular dichroism, which was subtracted from subsequent scans of the protein solutions. Wave scans were performed by sampling data at 0.69-nm intervals between 260 and 180 nm. The scanning rate (nm/min) was automatically selected by the Olis software as a function of the signal intensity to optimize data collection. The results were expressed as mean residue molar ellipticity (deg·cm2/dmol) at each wavelength. The protein concentration was determined by amino acid analysis. The composition of the secondary structure elements of the protein was deconvoluted from the CD spectrum (180–260 nm) using the neural network-based software CDNN version 2.1 (18Bohm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Predictions were made by CDNN networks that had been trained on both a simple set of 13 proteins and a complex set of 33 proteins. Thermal Stability—The 17-kDa AFP irreversibly loses activity at room temperature. We investigated the effect of increasing temperature on the secondary structure of the protein using CD. A sample was warmed slowly from 4 to 18 °C, and several spectra were collected and averaged at each temperature (4, 11, 15, and 18 °C). The first appreciable changes in the spectrum occurred at 18 °C. The sample was then warmed to 20 °C, and individual spectrum were collected by scanning from 260 to 180 nm over a period of 6 min. These scans were continued until the spectrum ceased to change. At this time, the temperature was increased in increments up to 60 °C, and several scans were collected at various temperatures (22, 25, 30, 38, 50, 54, 60 °C). The protein sample was diluted with an equal volume of trifluoroethanol (TFE), adjusted to 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), and scanned over a range of temperatures to determine the effect of 50% TFE on the structure and stability of the protein. In a separate experiment, a melting curve was derived. A protein sample of concentration 4.8 μm, also in 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), was warmed slowly whereas CD spectra were continuously collected from 225 to 185 nm at 1-nm intervals. The rate of temperature increase was varied to collect more data at the temperatures at which transitions occurred. The sample was warmed from 4 to 18 °C over ∼2 h and then warmed more slowly from 18 to 21 °C over a period of 1 h. The temperature was then increased from 21 to 50 °C in 1.5 h, from 50 to 55 °C over about 1 h, and from 55 to 80 °C in 0.5 h. Afterward, the heated sample was centrifuged, and amino acid analysis was used to determine whether the protein remained soluble. To investigate the degree to which the low temperature transition at 20 °C is reversible, a second sample was warmed from 15 to 25 °C over 0.5 h, then cooled to 8 °C over a period of 1 h. Meanwhile, CD spectra were collected between 225 and 185 nm at 1-nm intervals. The sample was then stored at 4 °C overnight and scanned again. Purification of the 17-kDa AFP—The traditional first step in purification of type I AFP from winter flounder plasma, Sephadex G-75 size-exclusion chromatography (11Chao H. Hodges R.S. Kay C.M. Gauthier S.Y. Davies P.L. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1150-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), was used here to remove these small contaminating AFPs from the 17-kDa AFP. Their separation was 100% effective (12Marshall C.B. Fletcher G.L. Davies P.L. Nature. 2004; 429: 153Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The type I AFP eluted late in the column profile as two overlapping peaks. To complete their identification, the trailing peak was further fractionated by reversed-phase HPLC (not shown). It contained type I isoforms HPLC-6 and -8 as confirmed by their elution profiles (28 and 30% acetonitrile, respectively) and masses (3,329.98 Da and 3,226.01 Da, respectively) determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The leading peak contained a species of mass 4,282.24 Da, consistent with the type I isoform AFP-9 (11Chao H. Hodges R.S. Kay C.M. Gauthier S.Y. Davies P.L. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1150-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The main peak of TH activity eluted shortly after the void volume containing the bulk of the plasma proteins. The latter were largely removed by three cycles of ice affinity purification (13Kuiper M.J. Lankin C. Gauthier S.Y. Walker V.K. Davies P.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The third and final purification step made use of the high pI value for the 17-kDa AFP to batch adsorb the remaining contaminants to DEAE-cellulose. SDS-PAGE analysis of the unbound protein showed a single band of apparent molecular weight 17,000 (Fig. 1, panel a). By MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry this protein had a monomeric mass of 16,683.04 Da. TH Activity and Ice Crystal Morphology—The (equilibrium) melting points and (depressed) freezing points of solutions of the purified AFP were assayed (Table I) and used to produce a standard curve of TH activity versus protein concentration (mg/ml) (Fig. 1, panel b). Between the concentrations of 0.05 mg/ml and 0.4 mg/ml, the shape of this curve resembled that of other AFPs, showing a dependence of activity on concentration that appears roughly hyperbolic. However, this protein was highly active, producing more than 2 Celsius degrees of TH activity at a protein concentration of 0.4 mg/ml. In comparison with the flounder type I AFP and the AFPs from other fish, the activity of this protein is exceptional. Compared with other fish AFPs at equivalent concentrations, its TH activity is >10-fold higher, whereas a comparison of the concentration required to achieve a given TH value reveals that the novel AFP produces TH activity equivalent to that of other fish AFPs at concentrations as much as 100-fold lower. This level of TH activity is similar to that of the hyperactive AFPs produced by the insects Tenebrio molitor and Choristoneura fumiferana (19Tyshenko M.G. Doucet D. Davies P.L. Walker V.K. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 887-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 20Marshall C.B. Daley M.E. Sykes B.D. Davies P.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11637-11646Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). At low concentration (0–0.05 mg/ml), the TH activity curve of this AFP differs from most AFPs in that the activity drops off rapidly as the protein concentration is decreased below 0.02 mg/ml. This produces an inflection point in the curve and gives a sigmoidal appearance to the low concentration region of the graph.Table IMelting and freezing points and thermal hysteresis activity of 17-kDa AFP solutionsAFP concentrationMelting pointFreezing pointThermal hysteresismg/ml°C°CCelsius degrees0.40-0.74 ± 0.01-2.95 ± 0.272.21 ± 0.270.20-0.67 ± 0.01-2.24 ± 0.301.57 ± 0.300.10-0.76 ± 0.02-1.98 ± 0.211.22 ± 0.210.050-0.60 ± 0.01-1.51 ± 0.270.91 ± 0.270.025-0.63 ± 0.03-1.34 ± 0.220.71 ± 0.180.013-0.61 ± 0.05-0.72 ± 0.060.11 ± 0.050-0.71 ± 0.01-0.71 ± 0.010 Open table in a new tab As noted previously (12Marshall C.B. Fletcher G.L. Davies P.L. Nature. 2004; 429: 153Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), the morphology of the ice crystals resembled lemons or spindles (Fig. 2, panel a). We have since observed that the aspect ratio of these crystals varies with the TH activity of the solution and the cooling rate; high TH and slow cooling rates favor compressed crystals with a short c-axis dimension, whereas low TH activity or rapid cooling rates allow the crystal to elongate along the c-axis, producing an extended spindle. When these ice crystals become supercooled beyond the TH gap, ice growth begins from a point between a tip and the equator of the spindle and propagates perpendicular to the c-axis (Fig. 2, panels b–d). Ice growth normally originates from one weakly protected point and does not occur simultaneously from the other equivalent surfaces of the crystal. N-terminal Sequence and Amino Acid Analysis—N-terminal sequencing of the 17,000 band excised from the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane produced a unique sequence, XIDPAARAAAAA, where X could be Asn, Thr, or Ala. This sequence is similar to that at the N terminus of the predicted 5a gene product (IDPAAKAAAAA) (21Davies P.L. Gauthier S.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 112: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), but differs in the presence of an additional residue and the conservative replacement of the basic residue. Amino acid analysis of the sample that had been purified to homogeneity using DEAE-cellulose revealed an exceptionally alanine-rich composition (>60 mol %) that was also abundant in threonine (13 mol %) but contained much lower quantities of the other amino acids, including leucine and phenylalanine that are typically associated with a hydrophobic core. The amino acid composition of this sample was similar to (but distinct from) the composition of the hypothetical product of the 5a gene (Table II).Table IIAmino acid composition of 17-kDa AFP and hypothetical translation of 5a geneResidue17 kDa AFP5a gene translationAmountaAmount in pmol of each residue from amino acid analysis of the purified 17-kDa protein.Mol %Estimated numberbEstimated number of each residue present in the 17-kDa protein based on the amino acid analysis and observed molecular mass.Mol % of estimateNumber encodedcNumber of each residue present in the hypothetical mature protein product of the 5a gene (after removal of the predicted signal sequence).Mol %pmolAsx5,5846.62136.6784.10Glx1,4211.6931.5431.54Ser3,7194.4194.6231.54Gly4130.4910.5121.03His620.0700.0000.00Arg6730.8010.5100.00Thr7,8509.31189.232613.33Ala51,08760.5912061.5412664.62Pro1,4821.7631.5431.54Tyr5120.6110.5100.00Val3,5144.1784.1094.62Met3890.4610.5100.00Ile3,4684.1184.1073.59Leu1,0611.2621.0310.51Phe5750.6810.5100.00Lys2,5002.9763.0873.59Total84,310100195100195100Protein massObserved: 16,683.0dProtein mass observed by MALDI-TOF for the AFP.Predicted: 16,669.4eProtein mass predicted for the estimated amino acid makeup.Predicted: 16,267.2fProtein mass predicted for the mature 5a transcript.a Amount in pmol of each residue from amino acid analysis of the purified 17-kDa protein.b Estimated number of each residue present in the 17-kDa protein based on the amino acid analysis and observed molecular mass.c Number of each residue present in the hypothetical mature protein product of the 5a gene (after removal of the predicted signal sequence).d Protein mass observed by MALDI-TOF for the AFP.e Protein mass predicted for the estimated amino acid makeup.f Protein mass predicted for the mature 5a transcript. Open table in a new tab Circular Dichroism Data Indicate the AFP Is Entirely α-Helical—To analyze the secondary structure of this protein, CD spectra were collected. The CD spectrum of a sample of concentration 7.7 μm collected at 4 °C between 260 and 180 nm resembled the archetypical α-helical spectrum with a maximum at short wavelength followed by two minima at longer wavelengths. However, this CD spectrum deviated from the classic spectrum of a helix (22Yang J.T. Wu C.S. Martinez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar) in that it was of higher amplitude, and the magnitudes of the two minima were far from equal (Fig. 3, panel a). The spectrum exhibited a maximum mean residue ellipticity value of 131,925 deg·cm2/dmol at 189.7 nm and two minima of –49,684 and –61,758 deg·cm2/dmol at 209.7 and 221.4 nm, respectively. The ratio of the two minima ([θ]221.4/[θ]209.7) was 1.243, and the more commonly reported [θ]222/[θ]208 ratio was almost identical (1.242). This [θ]222/[θ]208 ratio is anomalously high compared with that of most helices, which produce a ratio of ∼1, but is a general feature of helical proteins that are rich in alanine (23Wallimann P. Kennedy R.J. Miller J.S. Shalongo W. Kemp D.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1203-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) due in part to the intense ellipticity at 222 nm produced by these helices. The mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm for a long, completely helical, alanine-rich peptide with [θ]222/[θ]208 > 1.2 is –60,000 ± 1,000 deg·cm2/dmol (24Job G.E. Heitmann B. Kennedy R.J. Walker S.M. Kemp D.S. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2004; 43: 5649-5651Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Thus the [θ]221.4 value of –61,758 deg·cm2/dmol indicates that this alanine-rich AFP is completely helical. The secondary structure was also assessed using neural network-based CD de"

A growing number of failures of this drug in the treatment of malaria have been genetically linked to point mutations in the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. To better understand the molecular basis of atovaquone resistance in malaria, we introduced five of these mutations, including the most prevalent variant found in Plasmodium falciparum (Y268S), into the cytochrome b gene of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and thus obtained cytochrome bc1 complexes resistant to inhibition by atovaquone. By modeling the variations in cytochrome b structure and atovaquone binding with the mutated bc1 complexes, we obtained the first quantitative explanation for the molecular basis of atovaquone resistance in malaria parasites.

Up to one-half billion people in the world suffer from malaria with various degrees of severity. The disease kills more than 2.7 million people a year, most of them children under 5 years old in sub-Saharan Africa (1Breman J.G. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2001; 64: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Over the past three decades, the parasite that causes malaria, Plasmodium falciparum, has developed resistance to almost every commonly available anti-malarial drug, including chloroquine, pyrimethamine, cycloguanil, and sulfadoxine. Because some of these drugs are now almost useless in many parts of the world, the rapid spread of resistant parasites is a serious global health problem in endemic countries. In the 1990s, the urgent need for new anti-malarial drugs for treatment and chemoprophylaxis led to the development of atovaquone (2-[trans-4-(4′-chlorophenyl)cyclohexyl]-3-hydroxy-1,4-hydroxynaphthoquinone). This recently introduced anti-malarial compound, which has broad spectrum activity against apicomplexan parasites (2Fry M. Pudney M. Biochem.

This allowed us to biochemically confirm the linkage of atovaquone resistance to the cytochrome b mutations and to explain at the molecular level the mechanism by which malaria parasites counter the therapeutic cytotoxicity of this new drug. Materials—Yeast extract and peptone were from Difco. Nitrogen base without amino acids but with ammonium sulfate was from U. S. Biological. Dodecylmaltoside was obtained from Roche Applied Science. DEAE-Biogel A was obtained from Bio-Rad. Decyl ubiquinone, diisopropylfluorophosphate, and dithionite were purchased from Sigma. Stigmatellin was purchased from Fluka Biochemica. Atovaquone was a gift from GlaxoSmithKline. Purification of Cytochrome bc1 Complexes—The cytochrome b mutations were introduced into the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene by biolistic transformation as described elsewhere (19Hill P. Kessl J.

Wild-type and mutated yeast strains were grown in yeast extract/peptone/dextrose medium and harvested by centrifugation. Cytochrome bc1 complexes were then isolated from mitochondria as described previously (21Snyder C.H. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol.

Measurement of Oxygen Consumption and Ubiquinol-Cytochrome c Reductase Activity—Rates of oxygen uptake by intact yeast cells were measured at 25 °C with a Gilson oxygraph and a polarographic oxygen electrode (Gilson Medical Electronics, Middleton, WI) as described previously (23Atlante A.

Cytochrome c reductase activities of the cytochrome bc1 complexes were assayed in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 250 mm sucrose, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaN3, 2.5 mm KCN, 0.01% Tween 20, and 40 μm cytochrome c at 23 °C. The cytochrome bc1 complex was diluted to 2.5 nm in the assay buffer, and the reaction was started by adding 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl 6-decyl-1,4-benzoquinol, an analogue of ubiquinol. The reduction of cytochrome c was monitored in an Aminco DW-2a spectrophotometer at 550 versus 539 nm in dual wavelength mode. Data were collected and analyzed using an Online Instrument Systems Inc. computer interface and software. Molecular Modeling—Molecular modeling was carried out on a Silicon Graphics O2 work station using the commercially available Insight II® software package (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA). The starting structure was the energy-minimized atovaquone-bound yeast cytochrome bc1 complex (6Kessl J.J. Lange B.B. Merbitz-Zahradnick T. Zwicker K. Hill P. Meunier B. Palsdottir H. Hunte C.

Each cytochrome b mutation, Y279S, Y279C, I269M, L282V, and F278I, was built separately into the atovaquone-bound center P site using the lowest energy manual rotamer selected by the Biopolymer® module. For each structure, a flexible subset of adjacent residues within 2.0 Å of the mutation was selected. A surrounding 9.5-Å shell of residues, including atovaquone, was kept fixed. Residues beyond this shell were excluded from calculations in the interest of speed. The atom-based cut-off for non-bonding interactions was set at 9.5 Å, and the dielectric constant was set at 2.0. The CFF91 force field, which uses a 6–9 Lennard-Jones potential to calculate van der Waals interactions, was used for all modeling. A five-step simulated annealing run, from 800 to 298 K, was performed on each mutated structure using the Discover 3® module in Insight II®. At each of the five temperatures, the Nosé temperature control method was used for a simulation time of 10,000 fs/step, with a 0.5 fs/iteration time step. The final structure was minimized to a final convergence of 0.001 using Cauchy's steepest descent, conjugate gradient, and Newton methods consecutively. Five simulated annealing runs were carried out for each mutant structure to obtain an average final energy. To estimate the energy cost of binding atovaquone, we calculated the energy of each mutant structure with the bound atovaquone and compared it with the energy of the wild-type enzyme with bound atovaquone. To compare non-bonding interaction energies (van der Waals and electrostatic) and internal conformation energies of mutant and wild-type structures, a common subset (20Kessl J.J. Hill P. Lange B.B.

Location of the Cytochrome b Mutations Conferring Atovaquone Resistance to Plasmodium—The molecular target of atovaquone is now known to be the ubiquinol oxidation pocket at the center P site of the cytochrome bc1 complex (6Kessl J.J.

An energy-minimized structure of atovaquone in the ubiquinol oxidation pocket obtained by molecular modeling indicated that the hydroxyl group of the hydroxy-naphthoquinone bound via a hydrogen bond to the nitrogen of His-181 of the Rieske iron-sulfur protein. This hydrogen bonding accounts for the effects of atovaquone on the midpoint potential of the Rieske protein (6Kessl J.J. Lange B.B. Merbitz-Zahradnick T. Zwicker K. Hill P. Meunier B. Palsdottir H.

On the opposite side of the ring system, the carbonyl group at position 4 of the quinone ring of atovaquone formed a water-mediated hydrogen bond with Glu-272 of cytochrome b. The remainder of the molecular interactions between atovaquone and cytochrome b were essentially hydrophobic with a network of aromatic and aliphatic side chains surrounding the inhibitor. This binding pattern is similar to the one recently found in the crystal structure of the yeast bc1 complex with undecyl hydroxy benzoxythiazol, a hydroxyquinone, bound to the ubiquinol oxidation pocket (24Palsdottir H.

Because there is a high degree of sequence identity (about 68%) between S. cerevisiae and Plasmodium cytochrome b within the atovaquone-binding pocket (Fig. 1), we chose the yeast for studying how mutations can affect the drug efficacy. All atovaquone-resistant mutations in the cytochrome b sequence found in Plasmodium were localized around this binding site (9Srivastava I.K. Morrisey J.M. Darrouzet E. Daldal F. Vaidya A.B. Mol.

Trumpower B.L. Meunier B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 2725-2731Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The modeled structure of the yeast ubiquinol oxidation pocket at the center P site with bound atovaquone and the location of the amino acids residues affected in the atovaquone-resistant cytochrome b mutants are shown in Fig. 2. These five mutations are I258M, F267I, Y268C, Y268S, and L271V in Plasmodium numbering, equivalent to I269M, F278I, Y279C, Y279S, and L282V in the yeast numbering system (we will use S. cerevisiae numbering of cytochrome b hereafter). Except for I269M, which is located in the EF loop, all of the mutations affect residues of the EF helix of cytochrome b. Loss of Fitness Associated with the Cytochrome b Mutations—Growth of the five mutated strains was monitored in a non-fermentable medium to study the impact of the mutations on the respiration of the yeast cells. The growth curves (Fig. 3A) reveal that, in contrast to a doubling time of 6 (± 0.5) h observed for the wild-type strain and also for the I269M and F278I mutants, the Y279C mutated strain had a doubling time of 9 (± 0.5) h. In addition, both the Y279S and L282V mutants show even more severe growth defects, with doubling times of 13 (± 0.5) h. Measurements of oxygen consumption of the yeast cells in mid-log growth phase (Fig. 3B) confirmed a decrease of >60% of the respiratory function for the Y279C, Y279S, and L282V mutated strains. To further investigate this effect, the cytochrome bc1 complex was purified from the mitochondria of each strain to assess the kinetic parameters of the enzymes (Table I). Again, the bc1 complexes from the three mutants Y279C, Y279S, and L282V that showed significant defects in growth rates and oxygen consumption also showed activity losses of >90% compared with the wild-type strain. These activities were too low to permit accurate determination of Km and Vm values. The activity of the bc1 complex from the I269M mutant was also low, although the growth rates and rates of oxygen consumption by this yeast mutant were similar to and only slightly less than those of the wild-type strain. This suggested that the bc1 complex from the I269M mutant suffered some loss of activity during isolation.Table IKinetic parameters of purified cytochrome bc1 complexes from wild-type and atovaquone-resistant yeast mutantsYeast strainskcatKMs-1μmWild type220131269M308F278I22013Y279C10NDaND, not determined.Y279S20NDL282V15NDa ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Western blots indicated no loss of iron-sulfur protein, and optical spectra indicated no assembly defects in cytochromes b or c1 that could account for these decreases of respiratory function. Thus the results clearly suggest that these three cytochrome b mutations associated with atovaquone resistance in Plasmodium impair the ubiquinol-binding properties of the yeast bc1 complex. Possible implications of this effect for the growth of the parasite are discussed below. Effect of Cytochrome b Mutations on Inhibition of the bc1 Cytochrome Complex by Atovaquone—Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activities of the purified bc1 complexes from the wild-type and mutated yeast strains were measured in the presence of increasing concentrations of atovaquone to test whether sensitivity of the enzymes to the drug was altered by the cytochrome b mutations. We have shown previously that the bc1 complex of wild-type yeast is sensitive to atovaquone with an inhibitor concentration of ∼25 nm required for 50% inhibition of the activity of the purified enzyme (6Kessl J.J. Lange B.B. Merbitz-Zahradnick T. Zwicker K. Hill P. Meunier B. Palsdottir H. Hunte C. Meshnick S. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31312-31318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, all of the cytochrome b mutations that confer atovaquone resistance to the Plasmodium also altered the IC50 for inhibition of the yeast bc1 complex and by various amounts. The I269M and F278I mutations had the smallest effect, but even these conferred a 5–10-fold increase in resistance, with IC50 values between 150–250 nm. The Y279C, Y279S, and L282V were the three cytochrome b mutations showing the highest level of resistance to the atovaquone, with IC50 values between 1 and 2 μm. This corresponded to a 40–80-fold increase over the concentration required to inhibit the wild-type enzyme. Structural Changes in Cytochrome b Caused by Mutations Conferring Resistance to Atovaquone—The five cytochrome b mutations responsible for atovaquone resistance in Plasmodium were built into the previously modeled atovaquone-bound ubiquinol oxidation pocket at the center P site of the yeast bc1 complex (6Kessl J.J. Lange B.B. Merbitz-Zahradnick T. Zwicker K. Hill P. Meunier B. Palsdottir H. Hunte C. Meshnick S. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31312-31318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and the structural changes resulting from the mutations were modeled in silico. The isoleucine at position 269, located in a hydrophobic region of the binding pocket, interacted directly with the naphthoquinone ring of atovaquone. Modeling of the I269M mutation (Fig. 5A) showed a decrease of the volume available in this hydrophobic pocket, which interfered with binding of the inhibitor. The phenylalanine at position 278 interacted directly with the chlorophenyl substituent of atovaquone. Examination of this region revealed the presence of an aromatic cluster composed of Phe-121, Phe-278, Tyr-359 and the chlorophenyl group of the atovaquone (Fig. 5B). The F278I mutation removed the central aromatic element of this cluster, destabilized this area of the pocket, and thus interfered with binding of the drug. Tyrosine 279 is also contained in a stable aromatic cluster composed of His-181 of the Rieske protein and the naphthoquinone group of the ligand. The modeling results in Fig. 5D clearly show how the Y279C or Y279S mutations, which replace an aromatic group by strong nucleophilic side chains, decreased the hydrophobic interactions between the binding pocket and the atovaquone. In the L282V mutant, two changes taking place simultaneously explain the decrease of atovaquone binding as shown in Fig. 5C. First, Leu-282 interacted slightly with His-181 of the Rieske protein subunit, and the L282V mutation modified this interaction and influenced the degree of freedom of His-181. Secondly, the reduction in size of the aliphatic side chain created an empty space that the modeling compensated for by adjusting the backbone geometry of residues 280–285. Examination of this region showed that this adjustment suppressed a hydrogen bond between Arg-283 and Tyr-279 (Fig. 5C), which caused a change in the orientation of Tyr-279 toward the binding pocket. Consequently, displacement of the Tyr-279 residue caused an atovaquone-binding defect similar to the ones observed for the Tyr-279 mutants and contributed to the effect of the His-181 positioning. Calculation of Changes in Atovaquone-binding Energy Resulting from Mutations in Cytochrome b—The energy required for binding atovaquone was calculated with each of the modeled structures. The calculated changes in binding energy were then compared with the experimentally measured changes in IC50 values. The changes in atovaquone-binding energy with the bc1 complexes from the mutants relative to the binding energy obtained for the wild-type enzyme and the changes in IC50 values for the mutant enzymes compared with the wild-type enzyme are shown in Fig. 6. The relative increase in calculated binding energy correlated well with the relative increase in IC50 values for the bc1 complexes for each mutation, with the exception of L282V. This mutation, which displayed the largest change among the IC50 values, did not yield a comparably large increase in calculated binding energy. Possible reasons for this difference are discussed below. Only a decade after the introduction of the anti-malarial drug atovaquone, new strains of P. falciparum that are resistant to the therapy have emerged worldwide. In this work, we used the budding yeast S. cerevisiae as a surrogate to recapitulate and understand the molecular basis of the atovaquone resistance found in the malaria parasites. It is well known that atovaquone suppresses the respiratory function of the parasite by inhibiting the cytochrome bc1 complex (26Hudson A.T. Parasitol. Today. 1993; 9: 66-68Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The drug is also a potent inhibitor of the yeast bc1 complex (6Kessl J.J. Lange B.B. Merbitz-Zahradnick T. Zwicker K. Hill P. Meunier B. Palsdottir H. Hunte C. Meshnick S. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31312-31318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and the binding sites of the enzyme in the two microorganisms show a high degree of identity. We have previously elucidated the mechanism of atovaquone inhibition of the bc1 complex and developed a molecular model of atovaquone interaction with the ubiquinol oxidation pocket of the enzyme that accounts for the effects of the drug on the isolated enzyme (6Kessl J.J. Lange B.B. Merbitz-Zahradnick T. Zwicker K. Hill P. Meunier B. Palsdottir H. Hunte C. Meshnick S. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31312-31318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The strong and highly specific binding between the bc1 complex and atovaquone results from a combination of aromatic interactions and several hydrogen bonds, some of which mimic the binding determinants of the natural substrate, ubiquinol. Atovaquone is thus a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme. Most of the atovaquone-resistant malaria strains contain point mutations in the mitochondria-encoded cytochrome b gene. We were able to transfer these mutations into the yeast mitochondrial genome using a biolistic transformation procedure. Some of the resulting mutants were unable to grow on non-fermentable carbon sources, and thus it was not possible to demonstrate atovaquone resistance in vivo. However, the bc1 complexes purified from the mutated strains exhibited large decreases in sensitivity toward atovaquone. We were thus able to biochemically confer the genetic evidence that linked these mutations to atovaquone resistance. A previous study done on Plasmodium (9Srivastava I.K. Morrisey J.M. Darrouzet E. Daldal F. Vaidya A.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 704-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) demonstrates that these mutations can be ranked by the effects of atovaquone on the collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential of the parasite. This ranking resulted in moderate atovaquone resistance for I269M and F278I and greater resistance for Y279C and L282V. Notably, these mutations transferred into S. cerevisiae produced the same ranking order, demonstrating that the yeast bc1 complex is a valuable model for atovaquone resistance. In a recent study of mutations conferring atovaquone resistance in pathogenic Pneumocystis fungi, we show that one-half of the mutations are distal from the drug-binding pocket, and these are able to remotely modify the drug-binding properties of the bc1 complex (20Kessl J.J. Hill P. Lange B.B. Meshnick S.R. Meunier B. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2817-2824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Interestingly, all of the Plasmodium mutations that we duplicated in yeast in the present study affected residues located in the binding pocket and interacting directly with the atovaquone. The molecular modeling simulations were able to describe the effects of each point mutation on the geometry of the atovaquone-binding pocket at the molecular level. The molecular modeling revealed that the I269M mutation, which includes the insertion of a bulkier residue, is a typical example of resistance acquired by increasing steric constraints on the inhibitor. Several atovaquone-resistant mutations (I147V, L150F, and L275F) found in Pneumocystis have been shown to have analogous steric effects (20Kessl J.J. Hill P. Lange B.B. Meshnick S.R. Meunier B. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2817-2824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The three mutations F278I, Y279S, and Y279C removed an aromatic residue localized near the atovaquone and suppressed important interactions between the drug and the binding pocket. Likewise, molecular modeling of the L282V mutation showed that the mutation caused the rotation of Tyr-279 and, consequently, a variation of aromatic interaction with the atovaquone. Tight binding to the same locus using a very similar aromatic network has been described for the fungicide famoxadone, another inhibitor of the bc1 complex (27Gao X. Wen X. Yu C.A. Esser L. Tsao S. Quinn B. Zhang L. Yu L. Xia D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11692-11702Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Plasmodium, Saccharomyces, and Pneumocystis, which have atovaquone-sensitive bc1 complexes, all have a phenylalanine in position 278 of cytochrome b, whereas the bovine and human cytochrome bc1 complexes, which are relatively insensitive to atovaquone, have an alanine at the equivalent cytochrome b position. The 278 locus thus appears to be important for the differential efficacy of the drug, similar to the position 275 (6Kessl J.J. Lange B.B. Merbitz-Zahradnick T. Zwicker K. Hill P. Meunier B. Palsdottir H. Hunte C. Meshnick S. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31312-31318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The importance of Tyr-279 in cytochrome b for bc1 activity is supported by its conservation among species. It has been postulated that the aromatic side chain of this tyrosine participates in the positioning of ubiquinol, the natural substrate of the enzyme (24Palsdottir H. Lojero C.G. Trumpower B.L. Hunte C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31303-31311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In Rhodobacter sphaeroides (28Crofts A.R. Guergova K. Kuras R. Ugulava N. Li J. Hong S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 456-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), mutation of the homologous tyrosine has no effect on the activity when replaced by phenylalanine, a small effect (3-fold decrease) when replaced by leucine, and a dramatic effect (20-fold decrease) when replaced with a glycine. In yeast (29Fisher N. Castleden K. Bourges I. Brasseur G. Dujardin G. Meunier B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12951-12958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), mutation of the same tyrosine into alanine causes an ∼5-fold decrease in bc1 complex activity. Therefore, the 279 position appears to require an aromatic side chain, or at least a large hydrophobic residue, to maintain a functional bc1 complex. Furthermore, when this position is occupied by a nucleophilic residue such as cysteine (Y279C) or serine (Y279S), the activity is severely compromised. The sulfur atom of the cysteine being less electronegative than the oxygen atom of the serine would account for the differences between the two mutations. The Y279C mutation has also been observed clinically in a human bc1 complex, in which case the mutation was associated with severe exercise intolerance, deafness, and mental retardation (29Fisher N. Castleden K. Bourges I. Brasseur G. Dujardin G. Meunier B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12951-12958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 30Wibrand F. Ravn K. Schwartz M. Rosenberg T. Horn N. Vissing J. Ann. Neurol. 2001; 50: 540-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The comparison of experimentally measured changes in IC50 values for inhibition by atovaquone and theoretically calculated changes in binding energies provides a useful check on the validity of the molecular modeling. With one exception, there was generally good agreement between these two parameters. The one outlier, the L282V mutation, exhibited a relatively greater change in IC50 than would be predicted from the calculated change in binding energy. This may reflect the fact that IC50 is a free energy (ΔG) term, which includes an entropic parameter, whereas the calculated binding energy is solely enthalpic (ΔH). Alternatively, the divergence for this mutation may be because of a failure of the molecular mechanics algorithms to accurately evaluate the energy variation associated with the rotation of an element of a stable aromatic cluster. It is extremely challenging and costly to establish malaria cultures from patient blood (and probably impossible to do so in third world country facilities), so it is difficult to prove that a specific novel mutation of the cytochrome b gene is responsible for a specific patient failing treatment with Malarone®. The yeast model makes it possible to demonstrate and quantify which mutations confer atovaquone resistance and which are just coincidental allele variations. Two of the mutations, Y279S and L282V, severely impaired the ability of the yeast strains to grow on a non-fermentable carbon source. It has been observed that some atovaquone-resistant mutations cause changes in cytochrome b, leading to a loss of fitness in the malaria parasite (31Peters J.M. Chen N. Gatton M. Korsinczky M. Fowler E.V. Manzetti S. Saul A. Cheng Q. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 2435-2441Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This is frequently observed in mutations that confer drug resistance to microorganisms by alteration of structurally important regions of the target molecules (32Billington O.J. McHugh T.D. Gillespie S.H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1866-1869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Devereux H.L. Emery H.L. Johnson M.A. Loveday C. J. Med. Virol. 2001; 65: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In the case of atovaquone, this loss of fitness results from mutations close to the active site that reduce the binding of the ubiquinol substrate by the enzyme. There is no report that the widespread Y279S mutation causes a loss of fitness in P. falciparum, but our yeast model strongly predicts it. The implication of this prediction is important for the future development and use of the drug Malarone®, because it suggests that the geographic spreading of a single locus change such as the Y279S mutation will be stopped by the removal of the drug. As the resistant strain has to compete against a more fit, wild-type parasite, the reversal of atovaquone resistance will happen spontaneously."

Fat-specific PPARγ knock-out mice have lipodystrophy (hypocellularity and hypertrophy), elevated plasma FFAs and triglycerides (TGs) and decreased plasma leptin and adiponectin.

Diabetes. 2003; 52: 910-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). These clinical manifestations include many features of the metabolic syndrome and are thought to result from a combination of loss of function and the dominant negative effects of the mutant PPARγ receptors. In this study, we created a knock-in mouse model containing a PPARγ L466A mutation, shown previously to inhibit wild-type PPARγ action in vitro (22Park Y. Freedman B.D. Lee E.J. Park S. Jameson J.L. Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 365-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The potent dominant negative activity of the L466A mutation, located in the transactivation domain of PPARγ, is because of preserved DNA binding activity in combination with loss of coactivator binding but preserved corepressor recruitment (22Park Y. Freedman B.D. Lee E.J. Park S. Jameson J.L. Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 365-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Homozygous PPARγ L466A knock-in mice die in utero, but heterozygous PPARγ L466A knock-in (PPARKI) mice are viable and manifest many of the features seen in patients with dominant negative PPARγ mutations. Generation of Mice—An exon 6 fragment of PPARγ was used to screen a 129Sv/J mouse genomic library, resulting in the isolation of a 16-kb fragment of the PPARγ gene. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to mutate the leucine residue at codon 466 to alanine (L466A). Three nucleotides were modified (CCT to AGC) to generate a novel Eco47III enzyme restriction site. A targeting vector was constructed that contained most of the 16-kb clone, modified to include the L466A mutation, along with loxP-flanked neomycin and thymidine kinase cassettes in reverse orientation (Fig. 1A). The vector was linearized by KpnI digestion, electroporated into 129Sv/J R1 ES cells (23Nagy A. Rossant J. Nagy R. Abramow-Newerly W. Roder J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8424-8428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar), and subjected to selection with G418 and gancyclovir. PCR and Southern blot analysis were used to identify homologous recombination at the PPARγ locus. Two clones identified as carrying the L466A mutation were injected into murine blastocysts and implanted into pseudo-pregnant mice. Male chimeric mice were mated with female 129Sv/J mice, and germ line transmission was confirmed by PCR screening and direct sequencing. Mice were bred to CMV-Cre transgenic mice (129Sv/J background) to excise the neomycin cassette and were maintained on a 129Sv/J background. The 3-bp difference between the L466A mutated allele (CCT) and the wild-type PPARγ allele (AGC) was used to confirm genotype (Fig. 1B). Phenotypic Evaluation of Mice—Mice were housed in a pathogen-free barrier facility, maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle, and had ad libitum access to chow (Harlan Teklad Laboratory, Madison, WI) that contained 8 kcal % from fat unless otherwise specified. All animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine or Vanderbilt Medical School in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines. In some experiments, mice were fed a high fat diet that contained 30 kcal % from fat (Harlan Teklad) or 45 kcal % from fat (Research Diets Inc., New Brunswick, New Jersey). In these experiments, other mice were fed standard control diets, 10 kcal % from fat, provided by the same suppliers. Animals were weighed on a weekly basis. When the animals were fasted for glucose and insulin tolerance tests, the fast lasted 6–8 h and was typically performed between 8 a.m. and 2 p.m. Blood Collection and Serum Measurements—Blood samples were obtained by either the tail-cut method for small samples (<50 μl) or by retro-orbital bleeding under light anesthesia (halothane). Serum was stored at –80 °C. Fasting (6–8 h) and fed blood glucose levels were measured using a glucometer (FreeStyle™, TheraSense, Alameda, CA). Serum FFA measurements were performed using a diagnostic kit (Roche Diagnostics). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits were used to measure serum insulin (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO), adiponectin (Linco), and TNFα (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA). Tissue Histology, Morphology, Immunohistochemistry, and Cell Counting—Tissues were fixed in either Bouin's buffer (white adipose tissue) or 10% neutral buffered formalin (brown adipose tissue, liver) and paraffin-embedded. 5-μm sections were stained by hematoxylin/eosin. Immunohistochemical staining for adipophilin (guinea pig polyclonal, Research Diagnostics, Inc.), immunofluorescent staining for proliferating cellular nuclear antigen (PCNA; mouse monoclonal, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated UTP end labeling (TUNEL, Roche Applied Science) were performed. Alternatively, tissues were directly embedded in Tissue-Tek® O.C.T. Compound (Sakura Finetek, Inc., Torrance, CA), and 8-μm frozen sections were stained by Oil red O. Digital images were obtained using a Zeiss Axioskop optical microscope (Carl Zeiss International) and an Optronics Magnafire SP digital camera (Goleta, CA). The measurements feature of the Image-Pro Express software program (Media Cybernetics, Inc., Silver Spring, MD) was used to count the number of cells and to determine cell surface area in the digital images. Lipid Extraction and Triglyceride Measurement—Mouse liver was homogenized in 1 m NaCl. Liver tissue homogenate (100 mg/500 μl) was extracted with 3 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1) and 0.5 ml of 1 m NaCl. The organic phase was collected, dried, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of Triton X-100/methanol (2:1). Muscle triglycerides were extracted as described previously (24Frayn K.N. Maycock P.F. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 139-144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Triglycerides were measured using the GPOTrinder kit (Sigma). RNA Isolation and Real-time RT-PCR—RNA from epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen). The isolated RNA was subjected to DNase treatment and reverse-transcribed, and 100 ng of cDNA was used as template in a 25-μl real-time PCR reaction using an ICycler iQ System (Bio-Rad). Primers and 5′-FAM labeled probes for real-time detection were designed using the Primer Express software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Primer/probe sets (Table I) were designed for aP2, Acrp30, CD36, FAS, GLUT4, LPL, PPARγ, RPL19, SREBP1c, and TNFα (GenBank™ accession numbers K02109, AF304466, L23108, AF127033, AB008453, BC003305, U10374, M62952, AF374266, and M38296, respectively). Amplification of the ribosomal housekeeping gene RPL19 was used as a control, and cycle thresholds were corrected relative to RPL19 expression.Table IPrimer and probe sequences used for real-time RT-PCRGenePrimersProbeaP25′-CACCATCCGGTCAGAGAGTACTTT-3′5′-CACCGAGATTTCCTTCAAACTGGGCG-3′5′-GCCATCTAGGGTTATGATGCTCTT-3′Acrp305′-GCAAGCTCTCCTGTTCCTCTTAAT-3′5′-CTCCTGCTTTGGTCCCTCCACCCA-3′5′-CCATCCAACCTGCACAAGTTC-3′CD365′-GCCAAGCTATTGCGACATGAT-3′5′-CACAGACGCAGCCTCCTTTCCACCT-3′5′-TCAGATCCGAACACAGCGTAGAT-3′FAS5′-AGGTATCCATTCTGGGTTCTAGCC-3′5′-CCTACCCGTGTGACCGCCATCTATATCG-3′5′-GCTCGTTGTCACATCAGCCA-3′GLUT45′-CTGCTTCTGGCTCTCACAGTACTC-3′5′-ATTCTGCTGCCCTTCTGTCCTGAGAGC-3′5′-AGGTTCCGGATGATGTAGAGGTAT-3′LPL5′-GATGCCCTACAAAGTGTTCCATTA-3′5′-CAAGCAACACAACCAGGCCTTCGAA-3′5′-CCACTGTGCCGTACAGAGAAAT-3′PPARγ5′-CTGCTCAAGTATGGTGTCCATGAG-3′5′-CATCTACACGATGCTGGCCTCCCTGA-3′5′-GAGGAACTCCCTGGTCATGAATC-3′RPL195′-CAACTCCCGTCAGCAGATCAG-3′5′-TGACTGTCCATTCCCGGGCTCG-3′5′-TACCCTTCCTCTTCCCTATGCC-3′SREBP1c5′-AAGGCCATCGACTACATCCG-3′5′-CAGCACAGCAACCAGAAGCTCAAGCA-3′5′-GCTTTTGTGTGCACTTCGTAGG-3′TNFα5′-AGCCGATGGGTTGTACCTTGT-3′5′-CGTCAGCCGATTTGCTATCTCATACCAGG-3′5′-CGGCAGAGAGGAGGTTGACTT-3′ Open table in a new tab Protein Isolation and Western Blotting—Whole cell extracts were prepared from adipose tissue that had been removed from mice and immediately frozen in liquid N2. The adipose tissue was pulverized and homogenized in lysis buffer, and the protein concentration was determined by the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). The extracts were separated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Immunodetection was carried out using the following antibodies in 5% milk/Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20: rabbit SREBP-1 polyclonal (1:200) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit PPARγ polyclonal (1:2000) (Abcam, Inc., Cambridge, MA), and goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG (1:10,000) (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). Proteins were visualized with an ECL Plus detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Indirect Calorimetry—Oxygen consumption (VO2) and the respiratory exchange ratio were measured by an Oxymax indirect calorimeter (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH) with an air flow of 0.75 liters/min as described previously (25Ma L.J. Mao S.L. Taylor K.L. Kanjanabuch T. Guan Y. Zhang Y. Brown N.J. Swift L.L. McGuinness O.P. Wasserman D.H. Vaughan D.E. Fogo A.B. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 336-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). VO2 is expressed as the volume of O2 consumed per kilogram of body weight per h. After 1 h, to allow for adaptation to the metabolic chamber, VO2 was measured, starting at 10:00 in individual mice for 1 min at 15-min intervals for a total of 22 h under a consistent environmental temperature (22 °C). The respiratory exchange ratio is the ratio of the volume of CO2 produced to the volume of O2 consumed. Tail Cuff Blood Pressure Measurements—Systolic blood pressure was determined with the use of the Visitech Systems BP-2000 blood pressure monitoring system, an automated device for measuring systolic blood pressure by tail cuff, as described previously (26Krege J.H. Hodgin J.B. Hagaman J.R. Smithies O. Hypertension. 1995; 25: 1111-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Eleven-month-old male and female mice were subjected to tail cuff blood pressure measurements prior to catheterization for clamp studies. Mice were trained for 3 consecutive days; base line systolic pressure was measured and averaged over 5 days. Hyperinsulinemic-Euglycemic Clamp and 2-Deoxyglucose Uptake Measurements—Clamp studies were performed in chronically catheterized conscious mice in the Mouse Metabolic Phenotyping Center at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Male mice, 10–11 months of age, had two catheters surgically implanted into the right jugular vein and left carotid artery as described previously (27Halseth A.E. Bracy D.P. Wasserman D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E70-E77PubMed Google Scholar). Five days post-surgery, animals were fasted for 6 h, and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp experiments with [3H]deoxyglucose (2-DG) tracer were performed as described previously (27Halseth A.E. Bracy D.P. Wasserman D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E70-E77PubMed Google Scholar). After basal sampling at time 0, insulin was continuously infused at 4 milliunits kg–1 min–1 for the duration of the 2-h study. Blood glucose levels were measured from 8 μl of blood every 5–10 min using a HemoCue glucose analyzer (Lake Forest, CA). Glucose was infused at a variable rate to maintain clamped blood glucose levels at 120–130 mg/dl. Tracer was added at t = 120 min and continued until t = 145 min, at which time the animals were anesthetized with an intravenous infusion of pentobarbital sodium. Tissues (soleus, gastrocnemius, superficial vastus lateralis, adipose tissue, liver, diaphragm, and brain) were excised and rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent glucose uptake analysis. 2-[3H]DG removal from the blood and uptake by various tissues was determined as described previously (27Halseth A.E. Bracy D.P. Wasserman D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E70-E77PubMed Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as means ± S.E. Comparisons between two experimental groups were performed using the twotailed, unpaired Student's t test; analysis of variance was used for multivariate comparisons. Heterozygous PPARKI mice were viable and fertile. RT-PCR of mRNA from adipose tissue was used to verify equivalent expression of both PPARγ alleles. Routine breeding of heterozygotes failed to produce pups homozygous for the L466A allele. Timed matings of heterozygotes demonstrated that PPARγ L466A homozygotes die in utero by embryonic day 10.5 (Fig. 1C). The PPARγ L466A mutant has no inherent transcriptional activity (22Park Y. Freedman B.D. Lee E.J. Park S. Jameson J.L. Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 365-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The lack of homozygote viability is consistent with the embryonic death seen in homozygous PPARγ null animals (9Barak Y. Nelson M.C. Ong E.S. Jones Y.Z. Ruiz-Lozano P. Chien K.R. Koder A. Evans R.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 585-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). Histological analysis of PPARKI eWAT and brown adipose tissue revealed altered adipocyte morphology (Fig. 2A). PPARKI eWAT contains a heterogeneous population of adipocytes with a predominance of small and medium sized cells, whereas eWAT in wild-type (WT) mice is composed of a nearly homogenous population of larger adipocytes. PPARKI brown adipocytes contain large multiloculated fat vacuoles that were not present in WT mice (Fig. 2A). The number of PPARKI eWAT adipocytes per high powered field (×400) is ∼2-fold greater than that of WT mice (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the decreased size of the adipocytes is the cause of an overall reduction in fat mass. To investigate whether there is altered cellular proliferation or apoptosis in PPARKI eWAT, immunofluorescent staining for PCNA and TUNEL was performed. PCNA positivity (5.3 ± 4.8 and 4.0 ± 1.8) and TUNEL staining (1.5 ± 1.2 and 2.8 ± 1.6; number of nuclei per 100 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-labeled nuclei) were not different between PPARKI and WT eWAT, respectively. Real-time RT-PCR analysis was performed to investigate whether there is altered expression of adipocyte-specific genes in eWAT. The expression of adiponectin (Acrp30), aP2, CD36, GLUT4, and SREBP-1c mRNAs in PPARKI mice was 25–50% of that measured in WT mice (Fig. 2C). Western blot analysis showed that the amount of 125-kDa nuclear envelope-bound SREBP-1 was greater in PPARKI eWAT relative to WT eWAT (Fig. 2D). In contrast, the transcriptionally active 68-kDa protein was the predominant form of SREBP-1 expressed in WT eWAT (Fig. 2D). This finding suggests decreased activation of SREBP-1 in PPARKI adipose tissue. The levels of PPARγ protein expression did not differ between PPARKI and WT. We also performed Western blot analysis of insulin-signaling proteins in adipose tissue 10 min after an intraperitoneal insulin injection. No difference in the protein levels of IRβ, IRS-1, IRS-2, Akt, or phospho-Akt was found between PPARKI and WT mice (data not shown). PPARKI mice had normal birth weights. Weight gain was similar for PPARKI and WT littermates for the first 3 months. However, from 3 months of age, PPARKI mice gained less weight on either a standard (10 kcal % from fat) or high fat (HF) diet (45 kcal % from fat) than WT mice (Fig. 3A). These mice had reduced eWAT depots, directly correlating with total body weight. To investigate the cause of abrogated weight gain in PPARKI mice, food intake and oxygen consumption were evaluated. No significant changes in food intake (Fig. 3B) or oxygen consumption were detected (Fig. 3C). In the fed state, PPARKI mice had higher serum FFA levels on a standard diet than WT mice. Serum FFAs were elevated in WT mice on a HF diet, but no further elevation was observed in PPARKI mice (Fig. 3D). An intraperitoneal injection of insulin (0.75 units/kg) lowered serum FFAs in fasting male mice (7–8 months old) by ∼30% in both WT (preinjection: 0.77 ± 0.12 mm, postinjection: 0.54 ± 0.21 mm) and PPARKI (preinjection: 0.96 ± 0.16 mm, postinjection: 0.64 ± 0.28 mm) mice. Serum adiponectin levels in PPARKI mice were significantly lower (p < 0.001) than those in WT mice on either a standard or HF diet (Fig. 3E). No difference in serum TNFα was detected (Fig. 3F), although mRNA expression for TNFα was decreased in PPARKI eWAT. Fasting (for 6 h) and fed blood glucose levels were not significantly different between PPARKI (96 ± 18 and 102 ± 12 mg/dl) and WT (98 ± 22 and 94 ± 9 mg/dl) mice (7–8-month-old males) on a standard diet. Histological examination of the livers of 5-month-old male PPARKI mice showed macrovesicular fatty changes in mid-zonal and centrilobular locations, indicating hepatic steatosis. Hepatic steatosis becomes apparent as early as 4 months of age. With a HF diet (for 3 months), macrovesicular lipid accumulation was observed in both genotypes. Additional microvesicular fatty changes were seen around the central vein in PPARKI livers (Fig. 4A). The lipid accumulation was confirmed by Oil red O staining and adipophilin immunohistochemistry (data not shown). Inflammatory infiltrates were also detected in some PPARKI livers (not shown). The hepatic TG content (22.1 ± 5.2 mg/g liver) of PPARKI mice was 1.8-fold greater than that (12.3 ± 4.9) of WT mice (Fig. 4B). Although the hepatic steatosis appeared to be exacerbated by a HF diet in PPARKI livers, the hepatic TG content (24.9 ± 6.8) increased by only 13% when compared with a standard diet. WT mice exhibited a 39% increase in hepatic TG content (17.1 ± 4.6) on a HF diet. Muscle TG content was also measured, but there was no difference between PPARKI and WT mice (data not shown). Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies and 2-[3H]DG tracer studies were used to further investigate insulin action in PPARKI mice. Four groups of male mice were studied at 11 months of age, having been subjected to a standard diet (10 kcal % from fat) or a high fat diet (30 kcal % from fat) for 8 months. Basal glucose and insulin levels were comparable in PPARKI and WT mice on a standard diet (Fig. 5A). PPARKI mice on a standard diet exhibited no apparent impairment in 2-DG uptake and no insulin resistance compared with WT (Fig. 5). HF diet-fed PPARKI mice exhibited basal hyperinsulinemia (Fig. 5A). In clamp studies, glucose infusion rates were significantly lower (p < 0.05) in PPARKI mice on a HF diet, indicating insulin resistance (Fig. 5B). 2-DG uptake into skeletal muscle was also severely impaired (p < 0.05) (Fig. 5C). These results indicate that PPARKI mice have insulin resistance when exposed to a HF diet. Tail cuff blood pressure (B.P.) measurements on 11-month-old mice demonstrate that female PPARKI mice are overtly hypertensive on either a standard or HF diet (Fig. 6A). However, male PPARKI did not have hypertension (Fig. 6B). In this study, we created a knock-in mouse model (PPARKI) containing a dominant negative PPARγ L466A mutation, shown previously to inhibit wild-type PPARγ action in vitro. The compromised PPARγ function in PPARKI mice leads to a lipodystrophy with decreased expression of adipogenic genes, resulting in high circulating FFAs, low circulating adiponectin, hepatic steatosis, and HF diet-induced insulin resistance. The PPARKI mouse model confirms the importance of PPARγ in adipose tissue maintenance and insulin-resistant states (28Kahn B.B. Flier J.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (2488) Google Scholar). The heterogeneity and predominance of smaller sized adipocytes may reflect a combination of loss of function and the dominant negative activity of the PPARγ L466A allele. Smaller adipocytes were also described in the heterozygous PPARγ-deficient mouse model, and these smaller adipocytes were associated with enhanced insulin sensitivity (10Kubota N. Terauchi Y. Miki H.

In terms of mass, the bulk of the structure (∼90%) is provided by the α and β subunits, which form an (αβ)3 hexamer with adenine nucleotide binding sites at the α/β interfaces. We report here ultrastructural and immunocytochemical analyses of yeast mutants that are unable to form the α3β3 oligomer, either because the α or the β subunit is missing or because the cells are deficient for proteins that mediate F assembly (e.g. Atp11p, Atp12p, or Fmc1p). The F1 α1 and β subunits of such mutant strains are detected within large electron-dense particles in the mitochondrial matrix. The composition of the aggregated species is principally full-length F1 α and/or β subunit protein that has been processed to remove the amino-terminal targeting peptide. To our knowledge this is the first demonstration of mitochondrial inclusion bodies that are formed largely of one particular protein species. We also show that yeast mutants lacking the α3β3 oligomer are devoid of mitochondrial cristae and are severely deficient for respiratory complexes III and IV. These observations are in accord with other studies in the literature that have pointed to a central role for the ATP synthase in biogenesis of the mitochondrial inner membrane.

These observations are in accord with other studies in the literature that have pointed to a central role for the ATP synthase in biogenesis of the mitochondrial inner membrane. The mitochondrial inner membrane contains the ATP synthase, which utilizes a transmembrane proton gradient to catalyze ATP synthesis from inorganic phosphate and ADP. The ATP synthase has two major structural domains, an F0 component that forms a proton-permeable pore through the membrane and a peripheral, matrix-localized, F1 component where ATP is synthesized (1Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar). The catalytic unit of the enzyme (F1) is composed of five different types of subunits in the stoichiometric ratio α3β3γδϵ. The three-dimensional structures of F1 from bovine heart (2Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar), rat liver (3Bianchet M.A. Hullihen J. Pedersen P.L. Amzel L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1999; 286: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar) show that the α and β subunits alternate in position within a hexamer that surrounds the amino and carboxyl termini of the γ subunit. The interfaces between α and β subunits mark the locations of three catalytic and three non-catalytic adenine nucleotide binding sites in the enzyme (1Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar, 3Bianchet M.A. Hullihen J. Pedersen P.L. Amzel L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, all five F1 subunits are encoded by nuclear genes (5Takeda M. Vassarotti A. Douglas M.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 35285-35288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Like other nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins, the F1 subunits are imported to the matrix compartment as unfolded polypeptide chains. After the mitochondrial targeting signal (if present) has been removed, their folding is facilitated by the Hsp60 and Hsp10 proteins (11Hendrick J.P. Hartl F.U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). The final steps in the formation of functional F1 require two proteins called Atp11p and Atp12p (reviewed in Ref. 12Ackerman S.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1555: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Both F1 α and β subunits were found as aggregated proteins in sedimentation profiles of mitochondrial extracts of yeast mutants that are deficient for either Atp11p or Atp12p (13Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Yeast two-hybrid screens and affinity tag precipitation experiments have shown that Atp11p binds selectively to the β subunit of F1 (14Wang Z.G. Ackerman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5767-5772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and that Atp12p binds selectively to the α subunit of F1 (15Wang Z.G. Sheluho D. Gatti D.L. Ackerman S.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1486-1493Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The binding determinants for Atp11p in the β subunit, and those for Atp12p in the α subunit, are in the adenine nucleotide binding domains of the F1 proteins (14Wang Z.G. Ackerman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5767-5772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 15Wang Z.G. Sheluho D. Gatti D.L. Ackerman S.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1486-1493Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and are predicted to be located specifically at the hydrophobic regions of these domains that will ultimately be sequestered at the α/β subunit interfaces in the assembled F1 oligomer. Under this point of view, Atp11p and Atp12p are proposed to serve as molecular chaperones and to protect the two F1 proteins from non-productive interactions by masking their hydrophobic surfaces until incorporation of α and β monomers into α3β3 oligomers. Atp11p and Atp12p are present in the mitochondria at a concentration that is at least 100-fold lower than the steady state level of F1 proteins (16White M. Ackerman S.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 15Wang Z.G. Sheluho D. Gatti D.L. Ackerman S.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1486-1493Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is reasonable in view of the fact that the F1 subunits are assembled into the oligomer as soon as they are imported from the cytoplasm. In other words, there are no pools of unassembled α and β subunits in the mitochondrial matrix (17Burns D.J. Lewin A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12066-12073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This may explain why when either Atp11p or Atp12 is absent, both F1 subunits aggregate. Indeed, when one subunit aggregates as a direct consequence of the lack of its chaperone protein, the steady state level of the “partner” subunit builds up and eventually far exceeds the level of the remaining chaperone. Consistent with this interpretation, the α subunit aggregates in strains lacking the β subunit gene, and the β subunit aggregates when the α subunit is not expressed (13Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In contrast, the solubility of the α and β subunits is not modified in strains lacking one of the other F1 subunits, δ (8Giraud M-F. Velours J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 851-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 18Duvezin-Caubet S. Caron M. Giraud M-F Velours J. di Rago J.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13235-13240Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), γ (9Paul M.F. Ackerman S. Yue J. Arselin G. Velours J. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26158-26164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or ϵ (19Guélin E. Chevallier J. Rigoulet M. Guérin B. Velours J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 161-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, in the absence of the γ subunit, there is evidence to suggest αβ oligomers may exist (9Paul M.F. Ackerman S. Yue J. Arselin G. Velours J. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26158-26164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that aggregation of F1 α and β subunits occurs under conditions in which formation of α β heterodimers is not possible, either because the α or the β subunit is missing or because a protein (i.e. Atp11p or Atp12p) that specifically protects the α and β subunits from non-productive interactions is not present. Fmc1p is a protein of yeast mitochondria that is required for the formation of the F1 unit in cells cultured at 37 °C (20Lefebvre-Legendre L. Vaillier J. Ben Habdelhak H. Velours J. Slonimski P.P. di Rago J.-P J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6789-6796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In mitochondria of Δfmc1 cells grown at the restrictive temperature, the F1 α and β subunits sediment in sucrose gradient as large protein aggregates. Fmc1p seems to be necessary for Atp12p stability and/or activity at elevated temperature as suggested by the fact that Δfmc1 cells grown at 37 °C show a marked reduction in Atp12p content and recover the capacity to form the F1 unit by overexpression of Atp12p (20Lefebvre-Legendre L.

In this study we have performed an ultrastructural and immunocytochemical analysis of yeast mutants that are unable to assemble the F1 α3β3 oligomer. Electron micrographs of Δatp1, Δatp2, Δatp11, Δatp12, and Δfmc1 yeast cells all show the presence of large, electron-dense particles in the mitochondrial matrix. The inclusion bodies are immunodecorated in situ with antibodies against the F1 α and/or β subunits (as appropriate) and, following purification via sucrose gradients, are shown by silver-stained gels to be composed almost exclusively of F1 protein. Furthermore, there is evidence that mitochondrial biogenesis is grossly defective in these mutant strains as indicated microscopically by the absence of cristae and by spectral analysis, which shows a marked reduction in cytochromes c1, b, and aa3 relative to wild type yeast. Strains and Media—Rich galactose medium (2% galactose, 1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone, 40 mg/liter of adenine) was used for growing yeast. The genotypes of the Δfmc1 mutant (MC6) and its parental wild type strain (MC1) are given in Ref. 20Lefebvre-Legendre L. Vaillier J. Ben Habdelhak H. Velours J. Slonimski P.P. di Rago J.-P J. Biol.

U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar. The Δatp1 and Δatp2 strains were from the Euroscarf collection. Biochemical Methods—Mitochondria were prepared as described in Ref. 21Guérin B. Labbe P. Somlo M. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar. Ultrasonic irradiation of mitochondria was performed at 4 °C for 10 s using a 75TS Annemasse sonicator at 120 V with a 5-mm diameter tip. Sucrose gradient sedimentation of sonicated mitochondria was done using previously described conditions (13Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). SDS/PAGE was according to Ref. 22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar. Western blot analyses were performed as described (23Arselin G. Vaillier J. Graves P.V. Velours J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20284-20290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) using the ECL detection kit from Amersham Biosciences. Acrylamide gels were silver stained as in Ref. 24Ansorge W. Stathakos D. Electrophoresis. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1983: 235-242Google Scholar. Antibodies against F1 α and F1 β subunits were used at a 1/100,000 dilution. Freezing and Freeze Substitution for Ultrastructural Studies—The yeast pellets were placed on the surface of a copper electron microscopy grid (400 mesh) coated with formvar. Each loop was very quickly submersed in precooled liquid propane and held at -180 °C by liquid nitrogen. The loops were then transferred to a precooled solution of 4% osmium tetroxide in dry acetone in a 1.8-ml polypropylene vial at -82 °C for 48 h (substitution fixation), warmed gradually to room temperature, and washed three times in dry acetone. Specimens were stained for 1 h with 1% uranyl acetate in acetone at 4 °C in a black room. Following another rinse in dry acetone, the loops were infiltrated progressively with araldite (epoxy resin; Fluka). Ultrathin sections were contrasted with lead citrate. Immunogold Electron Microscopy—Yeast were cryofixed as described for ultrastructural studies and freeze substituted with acetone plus 0.1% glutaraldehyde or methanol plus 0.5% uranyl acetate for 3 days at -82 °C. Samples were rinsed with acetone or methanol at -20 °C, embedded progressively at -20 °C in LR Gold resin (EMS). Resin polymerization was carried out at -20 °C for 3 days under UV illumination. Ultrathin LR Gold sections were collected on nickel grids coated with formvar. Sections were first incubated for 5 min with 1 mg/ml glycine and then 5 min with fetal calf serum (1:20). The grids were incubated for 45 min at room temperature with antibodies against α-F1 subunit (1:2000), β-F1 subunit (1:3500), or porin (1:2000) and then incubated for 45 min at room temperature with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG, respectively, conjugated to 10 nm gold particles (BioCell). The sections were rinsed with distilled water and contrasted 5 min with 2% uranyl acetate in water, followed by 1% lead citrate for 1 min. Specimens were observed with a Philips CM10 (80 kV) or Tecnai Biotwin (120 kV) electron microscope (SERCOMI, University Victor Segalen Bordeaux 2). Cytochrome Spectral Analysis—Spectra were recorded for whole cells frozen at liquid nitrogen temperature with a Cary 128 spectrophotometer after reduction of the cytochromes by dithionite as previously described (25Claisse M.L. Pajot P.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 49: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Ultrastructural and Immunocytochemical Analyses of the Δfmc1 Mutant—Yeast cells were embedded in araldite resin and examined for ultrastructure by transmission electron microscopy. Morphometric analysis is optimized through the use of araldite resin, which although not amenable to immunolabeling proteins enables the use of osmium tetroxide during the fixation process. This provides for excellent membrane contrast. Electron micrographs of Δfmc1 cells grown at 37 °C revealed the presence, in 70% of the cell sections examined (Table I), of abnormal electron-dense particles that were located exclusively in the mitochondrial matrix (Fig. 1, A-C). The particles are noted to be largely globular in shape, with rather circular or oval contour, and range in size from 50 to 500 nm. There were no such electron-dense particles observed in electron micrographs of Δfmc1 grown at 28 °C nor were there any seen in cells of the wild type parental strain cultured at 28 or 37 °C (Table I).Table IFrequency of inclusion bodies in yeast cellsStrainsGrowth temperaturePercent cell sections with IBaIB, inclusion bodies.Percent mitochondrial profiles with IBaIB, inclusion bodies.°CWild type280.0 (n = 50)0.0 (n = 243)Wild type370.0 (n = 50)0.0 (n = 234)Δfmc1280.0 (n = 20)0.0 (n = 101)Δfmc13770.0 (n = 40)33.0 (n = 109)Δatp112844.0 (n = 25)23.5 (n = 81)Δatp122840.0 (n = 35)18.4 (n = 103)Δatp12816.0 (n = 25)9.3 (n = 43)Δatp22820.0 (n = 25)9.4 (n = 64)a IB, inclusion bodies. Open table in a new tab Immunogold electron microscopy of Δfmc1 cells grown at 37 °C provided insight into the nature of the inclusion bodies that accumulate in this strain at elevated temperature. First, the membranes surrounding the inclusion bodies were shown to be labeled with antibodies against porin, a marker protein for the mitochondrial outer membrane (Fig. 1D). This result provides evidence that the inclusion bodies are intramitochondrial. The use of antibodies against the F1 α subunit or the F1 β subunit (Fig. 1, E and F, respectively) resulted in a heavy and uniform labeling of all the inclusion bodies (Table II), showing the presence and co-existence within them of both F1 subunits. Outside of the inclusion bodies, the Δfmc1 mitochondrial sections gave a rather weak immunogold response (gold particles/μm2) in comparison to wild type cells (62 ± 25 versus 378 ± 72 with antibodies against subunit α; 29 ± 17 versus 225 ± 40 with antibodies against subunit β), and no significant extra-mitochondrial labeling (<10) was detected for either strain (Table II). There was virtually no immunogold labeling observed under conditions in which primary antibody was omitted from the experiment (Fig. 1G).Table IIDistribution of immunogold particles in yeast cellsSubcellular compartmentStrainsIBMitochondria minus IBExtramitochondrialAnti-F1αAnti-F1βAnti-F1αAnti-F1βAnti-F1αAnti-F1βΔfmc1721 ± 771044 ± 11462 ± 2529 ± 176 ± 14 ± 1Δatp111028 ± 2051016 ± 17242 ± 199 ± 310 ± 24 ± 3Δatp130 ± 271339 ± 36034 ± 1530 ± 105 ± 13 ± 1Δatp21099 ± 10125 ± 1587 ± 337 ± 57 ± 24 ± 1Wild type378 ± 72225 ± 406 ± 22 ± 1 Open table in a new tab Ultrastructural and Immunocytochemical Analyses of Δatp11, Δatp12, Δatp1, and Δatp2 Mutants—Electron micrographs of araldite thin cell sections showed the presence of abnormal electron-dense particles in the mitochondrial matrix of Δatp11, Δatp12, Δatp1, and Δatp2 mutants grown at 28 °C (data shown for Δatp11 and Δatp12, Fig. 2, A-C), in ∼20-40% of the cell sections examined (Table I). Those in Δatp11 and Δatp12 mutants were all heavily and uniformly stained with antibodies against the F1 α or F1 β subunit (data shown for Δatp11 immunogold labeling, Fig. 2, D and E). These results indicate that the two F1 subunits co-localize within the same inclusion bodies of Δatp11 and Δatp12 in a manner similar to what is observed in Δfmc1 cells cultured at 37 °C. Inclusion bodies of the Δatp1 mutant reacted strongly to antibodies against the β subunit (Fig. 2G) but not to those against the α subunit (panel F), which is expected because the α subunit is not made in this mutant. Conversely, the inclusion bodies in the Δatp2 mutant, which are devoid of the β subunit, were stained only with antibodies against the α subunit (panel H) and not with those against the β subunit (panel I). There was essentially no immune response to F1 protein outside of the inclusion bodies in Δatp11, Δatp12, Δatp1, and Δatp2 mutants (Table II) cell sections, which suggests that these structures contain most if not all of the α and/or β subunits present in the cells. Purification and Protein Composition Analysis of the Inclusion Bodies—To determine whether the inclusion bodies contain other proteins in addition to the F1 α and β subunits, sonically disrupted samples of Δfmc1 mitochondria were fractionated on a discontinuous (20-80%) sucrose gradient using centrifugation conditions shown previously (13Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) to separate high molecular weight protein aggregates from bulk membrane and soluble proteins. The profile for Δfmc1 proteins in the fractions collected from a discontinuous sucrose gradient was analyzed in a silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 3A, left side). Following the premise that some soluble proteins may be inadvertently trapped with the aggregated material, fractions of high sucrose percentage (fractions 8 and 9) were diluted out, the insoluble material was collected by centrifugation, and proteins were visualized on a silver-stained SDS gel (Fig. 3A, middle). The superscript “c” in the lane headings indicates that the samples applied to this gel were 9-fold more concentrated relative to samples 8 and 9 of the adjacent gel described above. Western analysis of fraction 8 (designated by superscript “w”) shows the α and β subunits of F1 among the proteins observed at the margin of 60:80% sucrose. By comparison with a sample of purified F1FO, it is noteworthy that the α and β subunit proteins in the aggregate are fully processed to the mature size and show no evidence of proteolytic breakdown. Similar results were obtained with Δatp11 mitochondria (not shown). The nature of the material trapped at the 60:80% sucrose interface was analyzed further (data shown for Δatp11, Fig. 3B). The left and middle lanes show silver-stained gels for fraction 8 collected from a discontinuous sucrose gradient pre-loaded with Δatp11 disrupted mitochondria. This fraction corresponds to the 60:80% sucrose interface (see panel A). Comparable amounts of sample were loaded in the lanes marked “8” and “8Tx”, the difference being that the latter sample shows the profile for detergent-insoluble particulate material that is recovered from fraction 8 following extraction of the sample with Triton X-100 (details for this experiment are given in the legend to Fig. 3). Notably, with the exception of two bands, a comparison of lane 8Tx with lane 8 shows that most of the proteins observed in the original sample are removed by the detergent, which suggests that the 60:80% sucrose region of the gradient is contaminated with membrane material. The identification of the prominent aggregated proteins as the α and β subunits of F1 is confirmed by the Western blot (lane 8w) shown at the right of panel B. Although the F1 α and β subunits are clearly the predominant species in the aggregated fraction, there is evidence of a minor amount of other proteins as well. None of these proteins reacted, in Western blot analyses, with antibodies against subunits γ and 4 of the F1F0 ATP synthase (data not shown). We did not test any other ATP synthase subunit as they fail to accumulate in the Δatp11 mutant. In addition, we did not detect any immunological signal for Fmc1p or Atp12p (data not shown). Efforts were also made to determine whether Atp11p accumulates with F1 β or if Atp12p accumulates with F1 α, in the aggregated mitochondrial protein fraction from Δatp1 or Δatp2, respectively. To detect the chaperone proteins by Western blot analysis in these experiments we used transformed Δatp1 and Δatp2 strains that express ATP11 or ATP12 from a multicopy plasmid. In a control experiment, we found that even in an otherwise wild type background, a subpopulation of the over-produced Atp11p and Atp12p protein is insoluble and migrates to a high density position in sucrose gradients (data not shown). As such, even though there is also a minor peak for Atp11p or for Atp12p at the 60:80% sucrose region in gradients run with mitochondria from Δα or Δβ yeast (data not shown), these results may be due exclusively to an artifact of overproducing the chaperone proteins and are not considered to be informative on aspects related to Atp11p and Atp12p action in F1 assembly. The Loss of the F1 Unit Coincides with the Absence of the Cristal Membrane—The inner membrane system of mitochondria is known to consist of two contiguous but distinct membranes, one that opposes the outer membrane (the inner boundary membrane) and one that forms tubules or lamellae in the interior (the cristal membrane) (26Frey T.G. Renken C.W. Perkins G.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1555: 196-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Cristae organization allows greater amounts of membrane-bound energy-transducing enzymes to be packed in the interior of the organelle. An illustration of this has been the demonstration that more than 90% of respiratory complexes III and V of bovine heart mitochondria reside in the cristal membrane rather than at the organelle periphery (27Gilkerson R.W. Selker J.M. Capaldi R.A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows mitochondrial cristae morphology in a respiratory-competent yeast wild type strain (panel A) and the distribution along this membrane of F1 subunits α (panel B) and β (panel C). An interesting observation in this study was the absence of any apparent cristal membrane in mutants where F1 synthesis is virtually abolished (Δfmc1, Δatp1, Δatp2, Δatp11, and Δatp12; shown for Δatp1 in Fig. 4D). This finding is consistent with previous work that has provided evidence that complex V plays a key role in the formation of this membrane (see “Discussion”). As a consequence, the mutants with F1 assembly defects were expected to show a decreased content in respiratory complexes III (bc1 cytochromes) and IV (aa3 cytochromes), which are residents of the inner membrane. This was investigated with the Δfmc1 mutant by spectral analysis of whole cells. A strong deficit in cytochromes b, c1, and aa3 was indeed seen in this mutant when the cells were grown at 37 °C, whereas no difference was observed between mutant and wild type cultivated at 28 °C (Fig. 5). As reported previously (13Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), Δatp11 and Δatp12 mutants are also grossly deficient for cytochromes of the bc1 and cytochrome c oxidase respiratory proteins. It must be stressed here that Δatp11, Δatp12, and Δfmc137 °C cultures do not produce high levels of cytoplasmic petites, which are cells that bear large deletions in mitochondrial DNA (ρ-) or lack completely the mitochondrial genome (ρ0). The petite population is only 1-2% in Δatp11 and Δatp12 cell cultures and 15-20% in Δfmc1 cells cultured at 37 °C. Therefore, the observed spectral deficiency in these mutants is not caused by a lack of mitochondrial DNA, which codes for apocytochromes b, a, and a3. Rather, the spectra likely reflect a deficit in respiratory proteins that results from an underdevelopment of the inner membrane. Notably, cytochrome c, a soluble cytochrome of the intermembrane space, was not decreased in the Δfmc1 cells but instead was found to be present in significantly higher amounts relative to the wild type control cells (Fig. 5). This is similar to what is observed for wild type ρ-/ρ° cells, which also lack cristal membranes (28Yotsuyagani Y. J. Ultrastruc. Res. 1962; 7: 141-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 29Stevens B. Strathern J.N. Jones E.W. Broach J.R.

Pasteur. 1949; 77: 47-63Google Scholar). We show that the α and β subunits of mitochondrial ATP synthase are sequestered as inclusion bodies in the mitochondrial matrix when they cannot be incorporated into α3β3 oligomers. This phenotype is associated with two types of yeast mutants, those that lack either the α or the β subunit (Δatp1 and Δatp2 strains) and those that are deleted for a molecular chaperone function associated with assembly of α β oligomers (Δatp11, Δatp12, and Δfmc1 strains). Unassembled F1 α and β subunits were shown to be present together within the same inclusion bodies in Δatp11 and Δfmc1 mutants (Figs. 1 and 2) and to be the principal protein species of these structures (Fig. 3). This observation does not necessarily imply a co-aggregation phenomenon, because Δatp1 and Δatp2 strains show inclusion bodies of pure β or α subunits, respectively (Fig. 2). To our knowledge this is the first demonstration of mitochondrial inclusion bodies that are formed largely of a particular protein species. The accumulation of unassembled α and β subunits in mitochondria of F1 assembly-defective mutants is a curious phenomenon. The turnover of mitochondrial energy-transducing complex subunits is considered necessary to prevent the accumulation of single subunits and subcomplexes in the inner membrane, which may disturb assembly processes or change the properties of this membrane (for reviews see Refs. 31Rep M.

https://openalex.org/W1601461124,"Recently, we reported the identification of a novel mitochondrial apoptotic pathway for granzyme B (GrB) (Han, J., Goldstein, L. A., Gastman, B. R., Froelich, C. J., Yin, X. M., and Rabinowich, H. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 22020–22029). The newly identified GrB-mediated mitochondrial cascade was initiated by the cleavage and subsequent degradation of Mcl-1, resulting in the release of mitochondrial Bim from Mcl-1 sequestration. To investigate the biological significance of Mcl-1 cleavage by GrB, we mapped the major GrB cleavage sites and evaluated the apoptotic potential of the cleavage products. GrB cleaves Mcl-1 after aspartic acid residues 117, 127, and 157, generating C-terminal fragments that all contain BH-1, BH-2, BH-3, and transmembrane domains. These fragments accumulate at an early apoptotic phase but are eliminated by further degradation during the apoptotic process. The major Mcl-1 C-terminal fragment generated by GrB (residues 118–350) was unable to induce or enhance apoptosis when transfected into tumor cells. Instead, this Mcl-1 C-terminal fragment maintained a partial protective capability against GrB-mediated apoptosis via its lower affinity to Bim. In comparison with ectopically expressed full-length Mcl-1, the stably transfected C-terminal fragments of Mcl-1 were less efficiently localized to the mitochondria. Knockdown of Mcl-1, as achieved by transfection with Mcl-1-specific short interfering RNA, resulted in a significant level of apoptosis in the absence of external apoptotic stimulation and, in addition, enhanced the susceptibility of breast carcinoma cells to GrB cytotoxicity. The significance of Bim in this GrB apoptotic cascade was indicated by the marked protection against GrB-mediated apoptosis endowed on these cells through Bim knockdown. Our studies suggest that the disruption of the Mcl-1·Bim complex by GrB initiates a major Bim-mediated cellular cytotoxic mechanism that requires the elimination of Mcl-1 following its initial cleavage. Recently, we reported the identification of a novel mitochondrial apoptotic pathway for granzyme B (GrB) (Han, J., Goldstein, L. A., Gastman, B. R., Froelich, C. J., Yin, X. M., and Rabinowich, H.

Mcl-1 was originally identified as an “early induction” gene during myeloblastic leukemic cell differentiation (1Kozopas K.M. Yang T. Buchan H.L. Zhou P. Craig R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3516-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). It has since been established as an essential protein in development (2Rinkenberger J.L. Horning S. Klocke B. Roth K.

Nature. 2003; 426: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Mcl-1 is an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member with three putative Bcl-2 homology domains (BH1–3) (1Kozopas K.M. Yang T.

Leukemia. 2002; 16: 444-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Other pro-survival Bcl-2 family members, including Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Bcl-w, also posses a BH4 domain, which is absent in Mcl-1 and A1/Bfl-1 (6Droin N.M. Green D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1644: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Because the BH4 domain is required for molecular interactions with other proteins (7Sorenson C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11368-11374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 8Denis G.V. Yu Q. Ma P. Deeds L. Faller D.V. Chen C.Y. J. Biol.

We and others (5Opferman J.T. Letai A. Beard C. Sorcinelli M.D. Ong C.C. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 2003; 426: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 10Han J. Goldstein L.A. Gastman B.R.

By contrast, Bcl-2 displayed comparable binding to Bim and Bad (5Opferman J.T. Letai A. Beard C. Sorcinelli M.D. Ong C.C. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 2003; 426: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the anti-apoptotic activity of different Bcl-2 family members depends on their selective interactions with other proteins, including various pro-death Bcl-2 members. Mcl-1 has a C-terminal hydrophobic domain that mediates its localization to membranous organelles (11Yang T. Kozopas K.M. Craig R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 12Akgul C. Moulding D.A. White M.R. Edwards S.W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Because both Mcl-1 and Bim are mainly localized at the mitochondrial membrane (13Zhu Y. Swanson B.J. Wang M. Hildeman D.A. Schaefer B.C. Liu X. Suzuki H. Mihara K. Kappler J. Marrack P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7681-7686Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), sequestration of Bim by Mcl-1 is expected to block the Bim-mediated mitochondrial apoptotic cascade (10Han J.

Mcl-1 has a fast turnover rate and the shortest half-life among anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members (4Craig R.W. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 444-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). This rapid turnover may serve the apoptotic process, particularly in light of the finding that early elimination of Mcl-1 is required for a UV-mediated mitochondrial cascade in HeLa cells (14Nijhawan D. Fang M. Traer E. Zhong Q. Gao W. Du F. Wang X. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1475-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Mcl-1 expression is highly regulated at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Its expression is dependent on environmental survival stimuli, mediated by various growth factors, such as IL-2, 1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; GrB, granzyme B; siRNA, short interfering RNA; Ab, antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; FMK, fluoromethyl ketone; MIB, mitochondrial buffer; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; WT, wild-type; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RNAi, RNA interference; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; AIF, apoptosis-inducing factor; Ad, adenovirus. 1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; GrB, granzyme B; siRNA, short interfering RNA; Ab, antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; FMK, fluoromethyl ketone; MIB, mitochondrial buffer; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; WT, wild-type; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RNAi, RNA interference; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; AIF, apoptosis-inducing factor; Ad, adenovirus.

Several post-transcriptional mechanisms have been implicated in its down-regulation, including decreased protein synthesis and various proteolytic activities that are mediated by proteasomes or caspases (5Opferman J.T.

Haematol. 2004; 125: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We reported that Mcl-1 is a direct substrate for GrB (10Han J. Goldstein L.A. Gastman B.R. Froelich C.J. Yin X.M.

Based on this observation and the identification of the high affinity of Mcl-1 for Bim, we proposed that the GrB-mediated degradation of Mcl-1 may free sequestered Bim and therefore allows for the execution of a potent Bim-mediated mitochondrial apoptotic cascade. However, other Mcl-1-related pro-survival Bcl-2 members, Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, are converted into pro-apoptotic effectors upon their cleavage by caspase activity (21Cheng E.H. Kirsch D.G. Clem R.J.

In the current study, we investigated the apoptotic nature of GrB-cleaved Mcl-1 products, as well as the significance of a complex between Bim and Mcl-1 or its GrB-generated C-terminal cleavage products for cellular survival. Reagents—Anti-human Mcl-1 Abs were from Oncogene (Boston, MA; mouse clone RC13 generated against recombinant Mcl-1, Ab-2) and from Santa Cruz Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA; mAb generated against recombinant Mcl-1, Ab-1), and a polyclonal Ab generated against a 20 amino acid residue synthetic peptide of human Mcl-1, Ab-3). Anti-β-actin mAb (clone AC-15) was purchased from Sigma; anti-Cox IV mAb was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR); rabbit anti-Bim Ab was from ProSci (Poway, CA); Bim-specific rat mAb was from Apoptech (San Diego, CA; Clone 14A8); Abs to AIF, Lamin A/C, Bcl-2, and Bcl-XL were from SantaCruz; Z-VAD-FMK, and purified GrB were from ICN (Aurora, OH). [35S]Methionine, protein A-Sepharose beads, and protein G-Sepharose beads were from Amersham Biosciences. Cell Lines, Cell Lysates, and Cell Extracts—Jurkat T leukemic cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 20 mm HEPES, 2 mml-glutamine, and 100 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin. HeLa, breast carcinoma CAMA-1, and colon cancer Hct116 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 15% fetal calf serum, 20 mml-glutamine, and 100 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin. The cell lysates were prepared with 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. To prepare cell extracts for GrB or caspase-3 reactions, cultured cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in ice-cold buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium EDTA, 1 mm sodium EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm sucrose, and protease inhibitors). After incubation on ice for 20 min, the cells (2.5 × 106/0.5 ml) were disrupted by Dounce homogenization. The nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 650 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cellular extracts were obtained as the supernatants resulting from centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. Cellular Fractionation and Mitochondria Purification—To obtain an enriched mitochondrial fraction, Jurkat or HeLa cells were suspended in mitochondrial buffer (MIB) composed of 0.3 m sucrose, 10 mm MOPS, 1 mm EDTA, and 4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4, and lysed by Dounce homogenization as described previously (10Han J.

Briefly, the nuclei and debris were removed by a 10-min centrifugation at 650 × g, and a pellet containing mitochondria was obtained by two successive spins at 10,000 × g for 12 min. To obtain the S-100 fraction, the postnuclear supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. To obtain the enriched mitochondrial fraction, the mitochondria containing pellet was resuspended in MIB and layered on a Percoll gradient consisting of four layers of 10, 18, 30, and 70% Percoll in MIB. After centrifugation for 30 min at 15,000 × g, the mitochondrial fraction was collected at the 30/70 interface. Mitochondria were diluted in MIB containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (at least a 10-fold dilution required to remove Percoll). The mitochondrial pellet was obtained by a 40-min spin at 20,000 × g and used immediately. Purity was assessed by electron microscopy and by enzyme marker analysis (23Matsko C.M. Hunter O.C. Rabinowich H. Lotze M.T. Amoscato A.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 1112-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For enzyme analysis, the following enzymes were assayed: aryl sulfatase (lysosomes/granules); N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase, α-l-fucosidase, and β-glucoronidase (lysosome); lactate dehydrogenase (cytosol); cytochrome oxidase or monoamine oxidase (mitochondria); thiamine pyrophosphatase (Golgi); NADH oxidase (endoplasmic reticulum); and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (plasma membrane). The purity was assessed at 95%, with ∼5% or less contamination from the microsomal fraction. Generation of Mcl-1 Mutant Clones—All single substitution Asp to Ala mutant cDNA clones (D72A, D88A, D117A, D127A, and D157A) were produced from a wild-type (WT) Mcl-1 cDNA clone by overlap extension using PCR (10Han J.

Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6810) Google Scholar). The double mutant clone (D127A/D157A) was produced from the single mutant D157A. Single point mutations (GAC → GCC) were introduced by mutated forward and reverse primers that overlap the specific Asp residue that was changed to Ala. The primer pairs (forward and reverse) used were: D72A, 5′-CTCACGCCAGCCTCCCGGAGGGTCGCGCGGCCG-3′ and 5′-CCTCCGGGAGGCTGGCGTGAGGGTGGACGGGGG-3′; D88A, 5′-GAGGTCCCCGCCGTCACCGCGACCCCCGCGAGG-3′ and 5′-CGCGGTGACGGCGGGGACCTCGGCGCCAATGGG-3′; D117A, 5′-CCGGCCGCTGCCGCCATCATGTCGCCCGAAGAG-3′ and 5′-CATGATGGCGGCAGCGGCCGGGGCTTCCATCTC-3′; D127A, 5′-GAGGAGCTGGCCGGGTACGAGCCGGAGCCTCTC-3′ and 5′-CTCGTACCCGGCCAGCTCCTCTTCGGGCGACAT-3′; and D157A, 5′-ACCAGTACGGCCGGGTCACTACCCTCGACGCCG-3′ and 5′-TAGTGACCCGGCCGTACTGGTGTTATTACCAGATTC-3′. PCR was carried out using the Expand Long Template PCR System kit (Roche Applied Science). Mutated PCR amplicons were gel-purified and subcloned into the vector pCR3.1 (Invitrogen) as described previously (10Han J. Goldstein L.A. Gastman B.R. Froelich C.J. Yin X.M. Rabinowich H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22020-22029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). All Asp to Ala conversions were confirmed by automated DNA sequence analysis (University of Pittsburgh DNA Sequencing Core Facility) of randomly selected clones. Molecular Cloning of Recombinant Plasmids Encoding the Mcl-1 GrB and Caspase-3 C-terminal Fragments—cDNA clones that encode the C-terminal fragments of Mcl-1 generated by GrB cleavage at Asp117, Mcl-1Δ2–117, and by caspase-3 digestion at Asp127, Mcl-1Δ2–127, will be referred to as Mcl-1ΔN117 and Mcl-1ΔN127, respectively. Both were produced by PCR (see above) of a WT Mcl-1 cDNA clone with the primer pairs (forward and reverse): GrB, 5′-CGCGGATCCCTGGCAATGGCCATCATGTCGCCCGAA-3′ (corresponds to Mcl-1 amino acid residues Ala118 through Glu123) and 5′-ACGCGTCGACTACAGCTTGGAGTCCAACTGC-3′ (complementary to nucleotides 1779–1799 in the 3′-untranslated region; caspase-3, 5′-CGCGGATCCCTGGCAATGGGGTACGAGCCGGAGCCT-3′ (corresponds to Mcl-1 amino acid residues Gly128 through Pro133); the reverse primer is the same as for GrB. GrB and caspase-3 Mcl-1 amplicons were purified and subcloned as described previously (10Han J. Goldstein L.A. Gastman B.R. Froelich C.J. Yin X.M. Rabinowich H. J. Biol.

Sequence analysis (as above) of randomly picked GrB and caspase-3 clones confirmed their sequence integrity. Molecular Cloning of Human BimEL—Production of human BimEL cDNA clones was as described previously (10Han J. Goldstein L.A. Gastman B.R. Froelich C.J. Yin X.M. Rabinowich H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22020-22029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Transfection—Hct116 cells were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in electroporation buffer (Amaxa) at a final concentration of 3 × 107 cells/ml. Five μg of linearized plasmid DNA were mixed with 0.1 ml of cell suspension, transferred to a 2.0-mm electroporation cuvette, and nucleofected with an Amaxa Nucleofector apparatus (Amaxa, www.amaxa.com) utilizing program T20, according to the manufacturer's directions. CAMA-1 cells were transfected by the GenePorter Transfection Reagent (Gene Therapy Systems Inc., San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's directions. Geneticin-resistant cell lines were grown in the presence of G418 (1500 μg/ml). Geneticin-resistant clonal cell lines were generated by dakocytomation (1 cell/well) utilizing a MOFLO high speed cell sorter and Summit Software. Transient transfection of CAMA-1 cells was carried out with Mcl-1 recombinant plasmids (see above) and the EGFP control plasmid pEGFP-C2 (BD Biosciences) using GenePorter transfection reagent following the manufacturer's protocol. Production of Mcl-1, GrB, and Caspase-3 Mcl-1 C-terminal Fragment Clones Encoding GST-Mcl-1 Fusion Proteins—Construction of recombinant cDNA clones capable of expressing WT Mcl-1 and Mcl-1 C-terminal fragments generated by GrB, Mcl-1Δ1–117, and caspase-3, Mcl-1Δ1–127 (that will be referred to as GST-Mcl-1ΔN117 and GST-Mcl-1ΔN127, respectively) as GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coli was carried out using the following primer pairs (forward and reverse) in PCR (see above) of WT Mcl-1 cDNA: Mcl-1, 5′-CGCGGATCCATGTTTGGCCTCAAAAGAAAC-3′ (corresponds to Mcl-1 residues Met1–Asn7) and 5′-ACGCGTCGACTACAGCTTGGAGTCCAACTGC-3′ (complementary to nucleotides 1779–1799 in the 3′-untranslated region of Mcl-1); GrB, 5′-CGCGGATCCGCCATCATGTCGCCCGAA-3′ (corresponds to Mcl-1 amino acid residues Ala118–Glu123) and the same reverse primer as WT Mcl-1; and caspase-3, 5′-CGCGGATCCGGGTACGAGCCGGAGCCT-3′ (corresponds to Mcl-1 amino acid residues Gly128–Pro133) and the same reverse primer as WT Mcl-1. PCR amplicons were gel-purified as described previously (10Han J. Goldstein L.A. Gastman B.R. Froelich C.J. Yin X.M. Rabinowich H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22020-22029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), digested with the restriction enzymes BamHI and SalI, and subsequently ligated into the BamHI and SalI sites of the vector pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). Sequence integrity of recombinant pGEX-4T-1 clones was determined as above. Production of GST-Mcl-1 Fusion Proteins—E. coli BL21 cells (Novagen) were transformed with recombinant pGEX-4T-1 Mcl-1 plasmids and plated out on LB agar-ampicillin plates as directed by the manufacturer. Four colonies were randomly picked for each Mcl-1 transformant, and each colony was grown overnight in 3 ml of LB-ampicillin medium. Three ml of 2×YT-ampicillin medium (×4) was inoculated with 45 μl of overnight culture for each colony and cells were grown at 37 °C to A600 = 0.6–0.8 (∼2.5 h). Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the cultures were incubated for an additional 3–4 h at 37 °C. Bacterial pellets (2200 × g for 30 min at 4 °C) were extracted, and GST-Mcl-1 fusion proteins were isolated following the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences) for MicroSpin GST purification modules except that 16 units of Benzonase (Sigma) and 3 μl of Protease Inhibitor Mixture Set III (Novagen) were added to the pellet extraction buffer. GST-Mcl-1 fusion proteins eluted from the microspin columns were concentrated and underwent buffer exchange using YM-10 Microcon centrifugal filter devices (Millipore). RNAi Using Mcl-1, Bim, and Lamin siRNAs—Short interfering RNAs were obtained as duplexes in purified and desalted form (Option C) from Dharmacon. The three siRNAs had the following sense strand sequences: Mcl-1, 5′-GAAACGCGGUAAUCGGACUdTdT-3′; Bim, 5′-GACCGAGAAGGUAGACAAUUGdTdT-3′; and Lamin, 5′-CUGGACUUCCAGAAGAACAdTdT-3′. CAMA-1 cells (2.5 × 105) were plated in a 6-well plate and following 24 h (at ∼30% confluency) were transfected with 200 nm siRNA in Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) without fetal calf serum using Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's transfection protocol. After 4 h, fetal calf serum was added to a final concentration of 10%. At 40 h, the medium over the cells was adjusted to 1 ml before the addition of an apoptotic agent. Release of Mitochondrial Apoptogenic Proteins—Purified mitochondria (50 μg of protein) were incubated with various doses of recombinant Mcl-1 (GST-Mcl-1), caspase-3-cleaved C-terminal fragment of Mcl-1 (GST-Mcl-1ΔN127), and the GrB-cleaved C-terminal fragment of Mcl-1 (GST-Mcl-1ΔN117) in 25 μl of MIB at room temperature for 10 min. His-BimL was then added for a co-incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. Mitochondria were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The resulting supernatants or mitochondria were mixed with SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting for the presence of mitochondrial apoptogenic proteins, cytochrome c, and AIF. In Vitro Transcription-Translation—Mcl-1, Mcl-1ΔN127, Mcl-1ΔN117, and BimEL cDNAs were expressed in the TnT T7 transcription-translation reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Each coupled transcription-translation reaction contained 1 μg of plasmid DNA in a final volume of 50 μl in a methionine-free reticulocyte lysate reaction mixture supplemented with 35S-labeled methionine according to the manufacturer's instructions. After incubation at 30 °C for 90 min, the reaction products were immediately used or stored at -70 °C. In Vitro Cleavage Reaction with Caspase-3 or GrB—In vitro cleavage reactions were performed in total volume of 20 μl. The reaction buffer consisted of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Each reaction also contained 1 μl of reticulocyte lysate containing 35S-labeled Mcl-1, or BimEL, and also reticulocyte lysate minus plasmid in the presence or the absence of recombinant caspase-3 (5–100 nm) or GrB (33–330 nm) for 20 min at 37 °C. The reactions were terminated by addition of SDS loading buffer and boiling for 5 min. Immunoprecipitation—For Mcl-1 and Bim immunoprecipitation experiments, the cells (5–10 × 106) and mitochondria (200 μg of protein) were lysed in 1% CHAPS buffer (20 mm HEPES, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% CHAPS). The lysates were precleared with protein A- or G-Sepharose beads, and incubated with anti-Mcl-1 or anti-Bim Abs at 4 °C for 4 h. The immune complexes were then precipitated with protein A- or G-Sepharose beads at 4 °C overnight. The pellets were washed four times with the appropriate lysis buffer and boiled for 5 min in SDS sample buffer. Western Blot Analysis—Proteins in cell lysates, cell extracts, mitochondria, or S-100 were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, as described previously (25Johnson D.E. Gastman B.R. Wieckowski E. Wang G.Q. Amoscato A. Delach S.M. Rabinowich H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1818-1823PubMed Google Scholar). Following probing with a specific primary Ab and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary Ab, the protein bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Flow Cytometry—Cytofluorometric analyses of apoptosis were performed by co-staining with propidium iodide and fluorescein isothiocyanate-annexin V conjugates (Becton-Dickenson). The staining was performed according to the manufacturer's procedures, assessed by a Beckman Coulter Epics XL-MCL, and analyzed with the EXPO32 software. Elimination of Mcl-1 during Caspase-3 and GrB-mediated Apoptosis—We recently reported the identification of a novel mitochondrial cascade for GrB-mediated apoptosis that encompasses the release of Bim from sequestration by mitochondrial Mcl-1 (10Han J.

Our reported studies suggest that the disruption of the Mcl-1·Bim complex is mediated by cleavage of Mcl-1 by GrB or caspase-3. Examples for the observed down-regulation in Mcl-1 expression are depicted in Fig. 1. Thus, in breast carcinoma CAMA-1 cells that serve as targets for cytotoxicity mediated by treatment with purified GrB and Ad, expression of Mcl-1 is significantly reduced as early as 6 h following treatment (Fig. 1A). In this cytotoxicity system, Ad substitutes for perforin as an endosomolytic agent that following the cellular internalization of GrB, facilitates its release into the cytoplasm (26Froelich C.J. Orth K. Turbov J. Seth P. Gottlieb R. Babior B. Shah G.M. Bleackley R.C. Dixit V.M. Hanna W. J. Biol.

Reduction in the level of Mcl-1 expression has also been observed in VP-16-treated cells, where the activity of caspases is stimulated. However, in etoposide-treated cells, the down-regulation in Mcl-1 expression is not efficiently blocked by a potent caspase inhibitor (Fig. 1B), suggesting that other proteolytic activities may also be involved in the observed elimination of Mcl-1 (14Nijhawan D. Fang M. Traer E. Zhong Q. Gao W. Du F. Wang X. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1475-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 28Zhang B. Gojo I. Fenton R.G. Blood. 2002; 99: 1885-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). When added directly into cell extracts, recombinant caspase-3 or purified GrB efficiently reduces the expression level of Mcl-1 (Fig. 1C). To further investigate the apoptotic mechanisms involved in GrB-mediated cytotoxicity, we investigated the biological significance of the GrB-generated Mcl-1 cleavage products. Mapping GrB and Caspase-3 Cleavage Sites in Mcl-1—To map the cleavage sites mediated by GrB or caspase-3, we generated mutant Mcl-1 cDNAs that involved Asp (GAC) to Ala (GCC) conversions for amino acid residue positions 72, 8"
https://openalex.org/W2077994677,"The ATM protein kinase regulates the response of the cell to DNA damage by associating with and then phosphorylating proteins involved in cell cycle checkpoints and DNA repair. Here, we report on deletion studies designed to identify protein domains required for ATM to phosphorylate target proteins and to control cell survival following exposure to ionizing radiation. Deletion studies demonstrated that amino acids 1–150 of ATM were required for the ATM protein to regulate cellular radiosensitivity. Additional deletions and point mutations indicated that this domain extended from amino acids 81–106 of ATM, with amino acid substitutions located between amino acids 91 and 97 inactivating the functional activity of ATM. When ATM with mutations in this region (termed ATM90) was expressed in AT cells, it was unable to restore normal radiosensitivity to the cells. However, ATM90 retained normal kinase activity and was autophosphorylated on serine 1981 following exposure to DNA damage. Furthermore, wild-type ATM displayed DNA-damage induced association with p53, brca1, and LKB1 in vivo, whereas ATM90 failed to form productive complexes with these target proteins either in vivo or in vitro. Furthermore, ATM90 did not phosphorylate p53 in vivo and did not form nuclear foci in response to ionizing radiation. We propose that amino acids 91–97 of ATM contain a protein interaction domain required for the DNA damage-induced association between ATM and its target proteins, including the brca1, p53, and LKB1 proteins. Furthermore, this domain of ATM is required for ATM to form nuclear foci following exposure to ionizing radiation."
https://openalex.org/W2012599763,"Ubiquitin conjugation and in particular two distinct HECT ubiquitin ligases, Rsp5p and Tom1p, have been shown to participate in the regulation of mRNA export in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The identification of the ubiquitin ligase substrates represents a major challenge in understanding how this modification may modulate mRNA export. Here, we identified Hpr1p, a member of the THO/TREX (transcription/export) complex that couples mRNA transcription to nuclear export as a target of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Hpr1p degradation is enhanced at high temperature and appears linked to on-going RNA-polymeraseII-mediated transcription. Interestingly, the stability of the other THO complex components is not affected under these conditions indicating that Hpr1p turnover could control the formation of the THO/TREX complex and consequently mRNA export. Using in vivo and in vitro approaches we demonstrate that Rsp5p is responsible for the ubiquitylation of Hpr1p that also involves the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc4p. Thus, Hpr1p represents the first nuclear export factor regulated by ubiquitylation, strongly suggesting that this post-translational modification participates in the coordination of transcription and mRNA export processes.

In eukaryotic cells, intracellular transport pathways are modulated as a function of differentiation, development, and cell cycle in response to a variety of stimuli. However, the molecular mechanisms ensuring this plasticity remain poorly characterized and probably affect both transport machineries and cargoes. Obviously, post-translational modifications and in particular ubiquitylation play a key role in control and regulation of intracellular transport. Indeed, the initial interest of ubiquitylation was focused on the role of polyubiquitin chains in targeting proteins to degradation by the 26 S proteasome. More recently, elucidating the role of mono-ubiquitylation as a sorting signal and regulator of endocytosis and endocytic trafficking led to the notion and subsequent demonstration that both mono- and polyubiquitination regulate a much wider array of cell processes, including cell cycle control, stress response, DNA repair, signaling, transcription, and gene silencing (reviewed in Ref. 1.Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3304) Google Scholar).Ubiquitin conjugation is accomplished via a thioester cascade in which ubiquitin is first activated by a unique E1. 1The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin-protein ligase; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; IPTG, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CTD, C-terminal domain; RNP, ribonucleoprotein; hnRNP, heterogenous RNP; mRNP, messenger RNP. 1The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin-protein ligase; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; IPTG, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CTD, C-terminal domain; RNP, ribonucleoprotein; hnRNP, heterogenous RNP; mRNP, messenger RNP. In a trans-esterification reaction ubiquitin is transferred from the ubiquitin activating enzyme to an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, which may in turn transfer the ubiquitin molecule to an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase. Specificity of the ubiquitylation system derives from the high fidelity protein-protein interactions between E3 and the substrate (reviewed in Ref. 2.Pickart C.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 499-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Previous studies using a yeast temperature-sensitive mutant of the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) indicated that the ubiquitin pathway is involved in both poly(A)+ RNA export from the nucleus and in nuclear protein import (3.Azad A.K. Tani T. Shiki N. Tsuneyoshi S. Urushiyama S. Ohshima Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 825-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). More recently, Tom1p and Rsp5p, two ubiquitin ligases (E3s) from the HECT family, have been shown to play a role in nuclear export of poly(A)+ RNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (4.Utsugi T. Hirata A.

EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1156-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The ubiquitin ligase activity of both E3s is required for its function in mRNA export, suggesting that ubiquitylation of some mRNA nuclear transport factors contribute to the regulation of this transport pathway. The identification of the ubiquitin ligase substrates represents a major challenge to understand how this modification may modulate mRNA export.mRNA export requires that newly synthesized precursor mRNAs undergo several processing steps, which include 5′ capping, splicing, 3′-end cleavage, and polyadenylation. The different steps leading to mRNP formation are linked to each other and often mediated by interactions with the RNA polymerase II transcription machinery (8.Maniatis T. Reed R. Nature. 2002; 416: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). All these functional couplings may be part of quality control mechanisms ensuring that only fully mature transcripts reach the cytoplasm (9.Rodriguez M.S. Dargemont C. Stutz F. Biol. Cell. 2004; 96: 639-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). A considerable number of proteins have been implicated in the export of mRNA, including Mex67p (TAP in metazoan). Mex67p (TAP) acts as a transporter that interacts with export competent mRNPs and mediates its docking and translocation through the nuclear pore complexes. As Mex67p exhibits low affinity for RNA, its interaction with mRNAs is mediated by adaptor proteins like Yra1p, an essential hnRNP-like protein of the REF family (10.Katahira J. Strasser K.

Recruitment of Yra1p and its partner Sub2p, an ATPase/RNA helicase essential for mRNA export, occurs co-transcriptionally and is splicing-independent (15.Lei E.P. Krebber H. Silver P.A. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1771-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 16.Jensen T.H. Boulay J. Rosbash M. Libri D. Curr.

Recent findings established a more direct link between Yra1p, Sub2p, and the transcription machinery, since both proteins are intimately associated to components of the THO complex, which has been implicated in transcription elongation, transcription-dependent recombination, and mRNA export (18.Zenklusen D.

Genomic deletion of genes encoding THO complex components (HPR1, THO2, MFT1, THP2) is viable at 23 °C but leads to poly(A)+ RNA export defect and cell death at 37 °C indicating that this complex is dispensable at 23 °C but essential at higher temperature (20.Strasser K.

THO, Sub2p, and Yra1p are recruited coincidentally to an active gene during transcription elongation. Sub2p can be recruited to the nascent transcript by virtue of a direct interaction with Hpr1p and may in turn facilitate the binding of Yra1p to the mRNA (18.Zenklusen D. Vinciguerra P. Wyss J.C. Stutz F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8241-8253Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the binding of Mex67p to Yra1p at a later step displaces Sub2p from Yra1p prior mRNA export through the NPC (17.Strasser K. Hurt E. Nature. 2001; 413: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 21.Reed R. Hurt E. Cell. 2002; 108: 523-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In addition, it should be emphasized that the mRNA export function is not accomplished through a unique pathway and can involve additional adaptors (9.Rodriguez M.S. Dargemont C. Stutz F. Biol. Cell. 2004; 96: 639-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar).To identify specific targets for the ubiquitin ligase Rsp5p whose ubiquitylation could regulate nuclear export of mRNA, we took advantage on two previously described properties of this enzyme. First, Rsp5p activity is dispensable for mRNA transport at 23 °C but essential at 30 or 37 °C. Second, besides its catalytic domain, the role of Rsp5p on nuclear transport is mediated by its second and third WW repeats (6.Rodriguez M.S. Gwizdek C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Dargemont C.

Anti-HA and anti-GFP monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Babco and Roche Applied Science, respectively. Anti-Mft1p and anti-GST antibodies were gift from Drs. T. Lithgow and T. Galli, respectively.Pulse-Chase Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—Yeast cells were cultured in YNB medium with glucose to A600 of 0.8, concentrated to A600 of 5, then labeled at 23 °C for 25 min (pulse) with 150 μCi of Tran35S-label (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) per ml, prior to chase at 23 or 37 °C with 10 mm unlabeled methionine plus cysteine. Samples (0.3 ml) were withdrawn at different times of chase, total protein extracts were prepared by the NaOH-TCA lysis method, and proteins were processed for immunoprecipitation using anti-HA monoclonal antibodies as described previously (37.Moreau V. Galan J.M. Devilliers G. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Winsor B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1361-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and radioactivity was detected by fluorography.Ubiquitylation Assay—Standard ubiquitylation reactions contained 3 μlof5× assay buffer (250 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 25 mm MgOAc, 2.5 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, 500 mm NaCl, and 50% glycerol), 1 μgof ubiquitin, 0.16 μg of E1, 3.8 μg of Ubc4 E2, 1.2 μg of Rsp5 E3, 8 pmol of GST-tagged substrate, and 3.3 mm ATP when indicated. Reactions were allowed to proceed for 4 h at room temperature and stopped by boiling in 5 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 3 m urea.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONHpr1p Degradation Is Temperature-dependent—It has been clearly shown that Rsp5p- and Tom1-dependent ubiquitylation, but also expression of the THO complex components, are dispensable for mRNA export at 23 °C but essential at 37 °C (6.Rodriguez M.S. Gwizdek C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Dargemont C. Traffic. 2003; 4: 566-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 7.Neumann S. Petfalski E. Brugger B. Grosshans H. Wieland F. Tollervey D. Hurt E.

Hurt E. Nature. 2002; 417: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). To determine whether the THO complex, or at least one of its components, could be a substrate for the Rsp5p or Tom1p ubiquitin ligases resulting in the regulatory function of these enzymes in mRNA export, stability of the THO complex proteins was first analyzed in different conditions. The stability of THO components was measured at both 23 °C and 37 °C by cell treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (+CX) and analysis of expression by Western blotting using specific antibodies (Fig. 1A). Using this approach, genomically HA-tagged Hpr1p (Hpr1-HA) or untagged Hpr1p (data not shown) exhibited a half-life of about 30 min at 23 °C that was dramatically reduced to below 15 min at 37 °C (Fig. 1A). Hpr1p synthesis did not appear to fully compensate for this accelerated degradation, as indicated by the progressive decrease in the cellular content of Hpr1p upon a shift to 37 °C (–CX). Increased instability of Hpr1-HA at 37 °C was confirmed by pulse-chase experiment followed by immunoprecipitation of Hpr1-HA (Fig. 1B). In contrast to Hpr1p, the THO components Mft1p and genomically HA-tagged Thp2p, as well as the export receptor Mex67p, were rather stable at both 23 and 37 °C indicating that this highly active metabolism specifically concerns Hpr1p (Fig. 1A). Because of its low abundance (10-fold less than Mft1p), the stability of Tho2p was not analyzed in this study. Interestingly, deletion of the C-terminal 88 amino-acids that preserved the Hpr1p nuclear localization signal prevented degradation of Hpr1Δ88 at 23 °C and clearly slowed down its turnover at 37 °C (Fig. 1, A and B) indicating that the C-terminal domain of Hpr1p likely contains the target amino acid residues for accelerated degradation. Deletion of this region does not strongly affect viability at 37 °C suggesting that this truncation does not prevent formation of the THO complex.Degradation of Hpr1p Depends on Active RNA Polymerase II-mediated Transcription—Proteins of the THO complex copurify with the DEAD-box RNA helicase Sub2p and the mRNA export adaptor Yra1p in a complex called TREX, proposed to couple transcription and nuclear export (20.Strasser K. Masuda S. Mason P. Pfannstiel J. Oppizzi M. Rodriguez-Navarro S. Rondon A.G. Aguilera A. Struhl K. Reed R. Hurt E. Nature. 2002; 417: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Studies on the THO components of TREX indicate that the recruitment of Hpr1p occurs during transcription elongation (18.Zenklusen D. Vinciguerra P. Wyss J.C. Stutz F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8241-8253Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 20.Strasser K. Masuda S. Mason P. Pfannstiel J. Oppizzi M. Rodriguez-Navarro S. Rondon A.G. Aguilera A. Struhl K. Reed R. Hurt E. Nature. 2002; 417: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 38.Kim M. Ahn S.H. Krogan N.J. Greenblatt J.F. Buratowski S. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 354-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). We thus analyzed the requirement of the transcription process in the ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation of Hpr1p. For this purpose, cells were treated with the transcription inhibitor thiolutin for 15 min prior to shifting the cells to 37 °C. As shown on Fig. 1C, thiolutin led to a clear stabilization of Hpr1p at 37 °C. To confirm this result, Hpr1p expression was also analyzed in cells containing a thermosentitive mutatioon for Rpb1, the large RNA polymerase II subunit. We found that degradation of Hpr1p was mostly prevented in these cells at 37 °C (which also corresponds to the restrictive temperature), whereas the level of Mex67p remained stable (Fig. 1C). These results illustrate that on-going transcription is required for Hpr1p turnover.Ubiquitin- and Proteasome-dependent Degradation of the THO Complex Factor Hpr1p—To determine whether degradation of Hpr1p was dependent on the proteasome activity, the sensitivity of Hpr1p expression to proteasome inhibitor was analyzed in Δerg cells, which enable the uptake of peptide inhibitors (29.Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). Results shown in Fig. 2A clearly indicated that degradation of Hpr1p at 37 °C was prevented in cells treated with a 20 μm concentration of the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Consistent with these data, Hpr1p levels were stabilized at 37 °C in cim3.1 thermosensitive mutants, impaired in proteasome activity (28.Ghislain M. Udvardy A. Mann C. Nature. 1993; 366: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), compared with the corresponding wild-type CIM3 strain (Fig. 2B). Since recognition and degradation by the 26 S proteasome requires polyubiquitination of the substrate, modification of Hpr1p was analyzed in wild-type and cim3.1 cells overexpressing His-tagged versions of ubiquitin from a copper-inducible vector. Cells were maintained at 23 °C or shifted to 37 °C for 4 h. His6-ubiquitin-conjugated proteins from the cell lysates were purified on nickel columns and analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-Hpr1p antibody. With this approach, polyubiquitin-conjugated species of Hpr1p could be detected in extracts of cim3.1 cells expressing His6-tagged ubiquitin and grown at the restrictive temperature. In contrast, wild-type cells and mutant cells grown at the permissive temperature or transformed with a control vector presented a weak or no detection of ubiquitylated Hpr1p (Fig. 2C). Altogether, these results clearly indicate that Hpr1p is polyubiquitylated and actively metabolized by the proteasome-mediated degradation pathway.Fig. 2Ubiquitin- and proteasome-dependent degradation of Hpr1p. A, Hpr1p expression was analyzed in Δerg cells maintained at 23 °C or shifted to 37 °C during 1 h in the absence or presence of 20 μm MG132. B, Hpr1-HA expression was similarly analyzed in wild-type and cim3.1 cells maintained at 23 °C or shifted to 37 °C during the indicated periods of time (minutes). C, nickel columns were used to purify His6-ubiquitin conjugated forms of Hpr1p from cim3.1 cells maintained at 23 °C or shifted to 37 °C during 4 h. Cell extracts or purified material was examined by Western blot with an anti-Hpr1p antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Hpr1p Is a Substrate for the Rsp5p Ubiquitin Ligase—The catalytic activity of the ubiquitin ligases Rsp5p and Tom1p has been shown to regulate efficiency of mRNA nuclear export (5.Duncan K.

EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1156-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To determine whether one of these ligases was responsible for Hpr1p ubiquitylation, Hpr1p degradation was analyzed in rsp5Δ or tom1Δ strains. Although disruption of the RSP5 gene is lethal, cell viability at 23 °C, but not at 37 °C, can be rescued by adding oleic acid to the growth medium (27.Hoppe T. Matuschewski K. Rape M. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. Cell. 2000; 102: 577-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Indeed the processing-mediated activation of the transcription factor Spt23p by Rsp5p is required for the synthesis of Ole1p, an endoplasmic reticulum-bound enzyme essential for lipid and membrane synthesis which catalyzes the desaturation of C16 and C18 fatty acids and formation of palmitoleic and oleic acids. Disruption of TOM1 or RSP5 did not affect the steadystate expression of Hpr1p at 23 °C. In contrast, Hpr1p degradation was completely abolished at 37 °C in a rsp5Δ strain and not in a tom1Δ strain (Fig. 3A), suggesting that ubiquitylation of Hpr1p is likely to be mediated by the Rsp5p ubiquitin ligase. To further investigate whether Hpr1p specifically interacts with Rsp5p, we generated a GST fusion protein expressing the WW2/WW3 domains (amino acids 281–429) of this E3 ligase, a region previously implicated in the nuclear export of poly (A)+ RNA (6.Rodriguez M.S. Gwizdek C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Dargemont C. Traffic. 2003; 4: 566-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A lysate from cells expressing an HA-tagged version of the Rsp5p partner Bul1p was used to test the functionality of recombinant GST-WW2/WW3 in a GST pull-down assay. Using the same binding conditions we observed a specific and strong interaction of Bul1p and Hpr1p to the GST-WW2/WW3 column but not to the GST control (Fig. 3B). A similar binding of Hpr1p to the WW2/WW3 domains has been observed in mft1Δ cells indicating that interaction between Rsp5p and Hpr1p can occur in the absence of a functional THO complex (data not shown). In contrast Thp2p and Mft1p poorly bound to the GST-WW2/WW3 column and Mex67p displayed no significant interaction with this fusion protein (Fig. 3B). We conclude that the WW2/WW3 domains of Rsp5p are responsible for Hpr1p recognition.Fig. 3Ubiquitylation of Hpr1p is mediated by the ubiquitinprotein ligase Rsp5p and the ubiquitin conjugation enzyme Ubc4p. A, Δrsp5 and Δtom1 as well as the corresponding wild-type cells were grown at 23 °C or shifted to 37 °C during the indicated periods of time (minutes). B, GST or GST-WW2/WW3 Rsp5 recombinant proteins on glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with extracts from cells expressing HA-tagged versions of Bul1, Hpr1p, or Thp2p or GFP-tagged Mft1p. Untagged Mft1p and Mex67p were analyzed from cells expressing Hpr1-HA. Beads were washed, and bound material was analyzed by Western blotting. 0.5% of the input was loaded in lane 1 (extracts). C, indicated cell strains were grown at 23 °C or shifted to 37 °C. D, ubiquitylation of indicated amount of GST-Hpr1 or GST-CTD was realized in the presence of recombinant E1, Ubc4, and Rsp5. ATP was either omitted or added last to minimize auto-catalytic ubiquitylation reactions by the ubiquitylation enzymes.

In embryos, in situ hybridization detected pHCl in the neural cord and the hindgut. Functional expression of the three different splice variants of pHCl in oocytes of Xenopus laevis and Sf9 cells induces a chloride current with a linear current-voltage relationship that is inhibited by extracellular protons and activated by avermectins in a pH-dependent manner. Further, currents through pHCl channels were induced by a raise in temperature.

A universal feature of the type of “Cys-loop” class of LGIC is a common topology of four membrane-spanning segments (M1–M4) and a huge N-terminal extracellular domain with a hyperconservated cysteinebridge motive (1Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1231-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). In vertebrates this “Cys-bridge” family of phylogenetically related genes codes for cation channels activated by acetylcholine and serotonin or for anion channels activated by GABA and glycine (1Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1231-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). In addition, glutamate- and serotonin-gated anion channel genes are known in invertebrates (2Cully D.F. Vassilatis D.K. Liu K.K. Paress P.S. Van der Ploeg L.H. Schaeffer J.M. Arena J.P.

The molecular basis of further channel types like acetylcholine-gated chloride channels in invertebrates is, however, still unknown (8Kehoe J. McIntosh J.M. J.

Information from the Drosophila melanogaster genome sequencing project allows identifying all members of the superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels occurring in this species by bioinformatic analysis of new homologous genes. The summarized data obtained from several published bioinformatic analyses (5Zheng Y. Hirschberg B. Yuan J. Wang A.P. Hunt D.C. Ludmerer S.W. Schmatz D.M. Cully D.F. J. Biol.

Four members of this group cannot be directly assigned to the GABA, glutamate, or histamine branches and thus code for putative new types of ligand-gated chloride channels with yet unknown function. In a systematic expression approach of these predicted novel types of ion channels in Xenopus oocytes, it was found that none of the typical neurotransmitters activated these novel types of channels (6Gisselmann G. Pusch H. Hovemann B.T. Hatt H. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 11-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Therefore, we extended the molecular biological analysis of the mRNA and found that the gene CG6112 encodes for transcripts that undergo extensive splicing. The functional expressions of these splice variants in Xenopus oocytes and Sf9 cells revealed a unique combination of pharmacological and biophysical properties. Computer Analysis—The pHCl clones were sequenced using the LI-COR 4200 laser fluorescent sequencing system (MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany), Fluorescence Labeled Cycle Sequencing Kit (Amersham Biosciences), and infrared fluorescence-labeled primers (MWG) as described before (11Saeger B.

Detection of pHCl Splice Variants in Different Drosophila Stages by RT-PCR—Total RNA of D. melanogaster imagos, pupae, larvae III, and eggs was isolated by the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol for animal tissues. DNA was removed by on-column digestion during RNA purification with the Qiagen RNase-Free DNase Set, whereas the RNA was bound to the silica-gel membrane. The OneStep RT-PCR System (Qiagen) was used to transcribe 1 μg of total RNA at 30 min, 50 °C and 15 min, 95 °C; subsequently, PCR amplification was performed for 35 cycles of 1 min, 94 °C; 1 min, 60 °C; and 2 min, 72 °C with final extension at 72 °C for 10 min employing splice variant-specific primer pairs (0.6 μm). As a negative control RT-PCR and PCR amplification was performed without template, and as a second control 1 μg of total RNA was used in a PCR amplification with gene-specific primers but without prior RT-PCR step. Detection of variants A–C were as follows: variant A, a 296-bp fragment with HT-F1 plus HT-R2 or 550 bp with HT-F2 plus HT-R2, variant B: 499 bp with HT-F2 plus HT-R2, variant C: 620 bp with HT-F1 plus HT-R2. (The locations of the primers are in Fig. 1A: ▸, HT-F1 and HT-F2; ◂, HT-R1 and HT-R2).

Preparation of Plasmid DNA for Xenopus laevis Oocyte Microinjection—The plasmids pCT19189A–C, which contain PCR products of the different pHCl splice variants generated with the primer pair AATTTGATGAGTCCAGTTCGGATAAGG and GCTTAATTTTACGAAAATCC, originated from the systematic expression screening approach described previously (6Gisselmann G. Pusch H. Hovemann B.T. Hatt H. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 11-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The cDNAs were cloned into the blunt-ended XbaI site of the expression vector pSMyc (19Wellerdieck C. Oles M. Pott L. Korsching S. Gisselmann G. Hatt H. Chem. Senses. 1997; 22: 467-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This vector construct facilitates expression of a fusion protein consisting of the N-terminal membrane import sequence of the guinea pig serotonin receptor (20Lankiewicz S. Lobitz N. Wetzel C.H.R. Rupprecht R. Gisselmann G. Hatt H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 202-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) followed by a myc tag and then by the pHCl channel beginning at amino acid 39. Such constructs have been proven useful for the functional expression of ligand gated ion channels in heterologous systems and can substitute for the missing endogenous membrane import sequence (21Gisselmann G. Galler A. Friedrich F. Hatt H. Bormann J. Eur.J. Neurosci. 2002; 16: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA used for microinjection was prepared using an endotoxin-free Qiagen Maxiprep kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) dissolved in water to yield 1 μg/μl and frozen in aliquots until use for injection. Whole Mount in Situ Hybridization with D. melanogaster Embryos— Antisense and sense RNA probes were labeled with digoxigenin-UTP (DIG-RNA-labeling kit SP6/T7, Roche Applied Science) by in vitro transcription using SP6 or T7 RNA-polymerase. The vector pCR BluntII TOPO (Invitrogen) containing the complete ORF of pHCl-A was linearized with HindIII (antisense) or EcoRV (sense) and served as the template. RNA probes were hydrolyzed at 60 °C under alkaline conditions (0.2 m sodium carbonate, pH 10.2) to yield probes with a length under 500 nucleotides. In situ hybridization on embryos was performed according to the method of Tautz and Pfeifle (22Tautz D. Pfeifle C. Chromosoma. 1989; 98: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2088) Google Scholar). Briefly, embryos were collected 9–12 h old. The embryos were then dechorionated for 3 min with 50% sodium hypochloride bleach (Sigma) and washed several times with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with a solution containing equal parts F-phosphate-buffered saline (4% formaldehyde in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, filtered), and heptane for 20 min with frequent shaking. Embryos were devitelinized with equal parts heptane and methanol for 2 min with vigorous shaking and allowing embryos to settle, followed by three times washing with 100% methanol and storage in 100% methanol at 4 °C. After rehydration for several times with 1× PBT (pH 7.4, 130 mm NaCl, 7 mm Na2HPO4, 3 mm NaH2PO4, 0.1% Tween 20 (v/v)) and first fixation with 1× F-PBT (4% paraformaldehyde in 1× PBT) for 20 min while shaking embryos were washed and shaken 3 × 5 min in 1× PBT. First fixation was followed by digestion with proteinase K (25 μg/ml in 1× PBT) for 1 min. Reaction was stopped by inactivating proteinase K (ICN Biomedicals) with 2 mg/ml glycine in 1× PBT for 3 min at RT while shaking. After several washings (1 × 30 s, 2 × 5 min with 1× PBT) embryos were fixed for a second time (refixation) with 1× F-PBT for 20 min and followed by thorough washings while shaking (5 × 5 min with 1× PBT, 1 × 20 min with 1:1 PBT: prehybridization buffer). Embryos were incubated thereafter for 1 h at 50 °C in prehybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5× SSC, 50 μg/ml heparin, 0.1% Tween 20) without shaking and then overnight incubation at 50 °C in hybridization buffer containing the linearized and freshly denaturized digoxigenin-labeled probe (50, 100, and 200 ng/ml). The embryos were washed several times: 5 × 15 min in prehybridization buffer at 50 °C without shaking, 1 × 20 min while shaking at room temperature with prehybridization buffer, 1 × 20 min while shaking at room temperature with 1:1 PBT:prehybridization buffer, 2 × 10 min while shaking at room temperature with 1× PBT. The embryos were treated for 1 h with 1% blocking solution (Roche Applied Science) in 1× PBT while rocking followed by incubation for 1–2 h with anti-digoxigenin-AP Fab fragments (1:2000, Roche Applied Science). Following eight 10-min washes in 1× PBT while shaking and two 10-min rinses in AP buffer (50 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris, pH 9.5, 1 mm levamisole, 0.1% Tween 20), the nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate color substrates (Roche Applied Science) were used to detect the hybridized probes. Reaction was stopped by several washes with 1× PBT while shaking. Embryos can be stored in 1× PBT buffer at 4 °C or be dehydrated step by step (1 × 5 min 40%, 70%, and 96% ethanol) while shaking and embedded in Canada balsam (Roth) or 100% glycerin (previous incubation in 70% glycerin in H2O for 24 h). Injection of cDNA into Xenopus Oocytes—Ovarian tissue was taken from anesthetized female Xenopus laevis (Nasco, Fort Atkinson, WI), and oocytes were released from the follicle tissue with collagenase (Sigma, 2 mg/ml). Stage V oocytes were selected by hand and plated individually into the conical wells of a 96-microtiter plate (Greiner, Frickenhausen, Germany) filled with modified Barth's medium containing (in mm): NaCl 88, NaHCO3 2.4, KCl 1, Ca(NO3)2 0.33, CaCl2 0.41, MgSO4 0.82, Tris/HCl 5 (pH 7.4, 200 mosmol/kg) (23Gurdon J.B. Wickens M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 370-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Oocytes were seeded with their animal (brown) pole facing up so that the nucleus is located just underneath the cell membrane (24Dumont J.N. J. Morphol. 1972; 136: 153-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar). This facilitated intranuclear injection of cDNA that has been described before (25Ballivet M. Nef P. Couturier S. Rungger D. Bader C.R. Bertrand D. Cooper E. Neuron. 1988; 1: 847-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We used a semi-automated system, the Roboocyte (Multi Channel Systems, Reutlingen, Germany) whose features have been described elsewhere (26Schnizler K. Kuster M. Methfessel C. Fejtl M. Receptors Channels. 2003; 9: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Varying concentrations of cDNA between 40 and 100 ng/μl gave rise to reproducible expression levels and channel properties. After injection, cells were then incubated for 2–5 days at 19 °C in Barth's medium with gentamicin (50 μg/ml), and functionally expressing cells were identified with the Roboocyte. Two-electrode Voltage Clamp Experiments—Electrophysiological experiments on oocytes were carried out using the two-electrode voltage clamp method (27Stuhmer W. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 319-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The standard extracellular superfusion solution was normal frog Ringer's solution containing (in mm): NaCl 115, KCl 2.5, CaCl2 1.8, HEPES 10 (pH 7.2, 240 mosmol/kg). Where stated the pH of the solutions was altered by addition of either NaOH or HCl and routinely checked before and during experiments. Functionally expressing oocytes were identified with the Roboocyte by clamping the oocytes to –80 mV and superfusion with a frog Ringer's solution of pH 9. Further electrophysiological and pharmacological experiments were carried out on a manual set up. Cells were penetrated with two microelectrodes filled with 3 m KCl, usually clamped to –80 mV with a voltage clamp amplifier (TEC01/02, npi, Tamm, Germany), and the membrane currents were recorded. If not stated differently, recordings were performed at a holding potential of –80 mV and a sampling rate of 20 Hz. Substances were delivered from two reservoirs reaching the cell 7 s after valve opening and exchanging the solution in the recording chamber within 2 s. Data acquisition and analysis were performed with Pulse+Pulsefit software (HEKA Elektronik GmbH, Lambrecht, Germany). All measurements were carried out at room temperature (23–28 °C) except those investigating temperature-dependent effects. For those, the glass-enclosed temperature sensor of a digital thermometer (Mawitherm, Germany) was positioned near the oocyte into the flowing stream of the extracellular solution. Cell Culture and Transfection of Sf9 Cells for Patch-clamping Experiments—Sf9 cells were grown at 26 °C in Sf-900 II SFM (serum-free medium) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10 μg/ml gentamycin (Invitrogen). Semiconfluent cells were transfected in 24-well dishes (Nunc) on 12-mm glass coverslips by using the non-liposomal Fu-GENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the transfection, 1 μg per dish of plasmids pIE1–3-pHCl-A, -B, or -C was used. Therefore the pCT19189A–C inserts were cloned SacII/NruI into the multicloning site of the insect expression vector pIE1–3 (Novagen). Efficiency of transfection, typically <20%, was checked by cotransfection of 0.5 μg of pIE1–3-EGFP. For this purpose, EGFP was taken from pEGFP-N1 (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and cloned into the SacII/NotI site of pIE1–3. Electrophysiological experiments were done 24–48 h after transfection. Whole Cell Voltage Clamp Experiments on Sf9 Cells—Membrane currents of EGFP-expressing Sf9 cells cotransfected with one of the pHCl splice variants were recorded in the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique (28Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15119) Google Scholar). Application of test substances and bath solutions of various pH were applied using the U-tube-reversed-flow technique (29Fenwick E.M. Marty A. Neher E. J. Physiol. 1982; 331: 577-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar) with an application time of 1–2 s at intervals of 1 min. The perfusion chamber had a volume of ∼0.5 ml and was continuously perfused (flow rate 3 ml/min) with external bath solution driven by gravity. The standard external bath solution contained (in mm): 150 NaCl, 4 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 10 Hepes (pH 7.3 adjusted with 1 n NaOH, 320 mosmol/kg). The pipette solution contained (in mm): 150 KCl, 10 K-EGTA, 10 Hepes (pH 7.3 adjusted with 1 n KOH, 320 mosmol/kg). For pH-variation experiments, the external bath solution was adjusted to pH 6.1 with 1 n HCl. In the case of pH 8.6 Tris buffer was used instead of Hepes buffer. For chloride exchange experiments, the pipette solution contained (in mm): 120 KF, 30 KCl, 10 K-EGTA, 10 Hepes (pH 7.3 adjusted with 1 n KOH, 320 mosmol/kg). Microelectrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (external diameter 1.6 mm, Hilgenberg, Malsfeld, Germany) on a Zeitz Puller. The resistance of the fire-polished pipettes was 4–7 megohms using the internal and external solutions described above. All experiments were carried out at room temperature (22–25 °C). Currents were measured with an L/M-EPC 7 patch clamp amplifier (HEKA Elektronik GmbH, Lambrecht, Germany). After the giga-seal formation, the EPC 7 circuitry was used to minimize the fast capacitance transients. No compensation was made for the series resistance after the whole cell configuration was obtained. The holding potential was –70 mV unless otherwise stated. The analog signals were low-pass (Bessel) filtered at 3.15 kHz (whole cell measurements) and digitized at 1 kHz. For recording and analysis the PClamp software (Axon Instruments, version 6.03) was used. Drugs—Stock solution in Me2SO were diluted to various concentrations into normal Ringer's solution of the following compounds: picrotoxin (50 mm), capsaicin (100 mm), fipronil (100 and 10 mm), ivermectin (10 mm), avermectin B1a (major component of ivermectin, 1 mm), histamine (100 mm), dopamine (10 mm), octopamine (100 mm), and glycine (100 mm). 1 and 2% Me2SO did not have a significant effect on the membrane current of pHCl-injected oocytes or Sf9 cells at pH 7.2. Statistics—Data are shown as mean ± S.D. Sequence Analysis of the Putative Novel Invertebrate LGIC— The genomic region around the gene CG6112 that encodes a putative novel type of invertebrate ligand-gated ion channel was examined for coding regions and deduced transcripts homologous to known Drosophila ligand-gated ion channel subunit sequences. This analysis led to a postulated mRNA sequence that was experimentally proved to exist by RT-PCR and sequencing. The longest transcript identified experimentally in this way encompasses nearly the complete open reading frame of the postulated transcript except for a few nucleotides at the 5′ end. The originally found cDNA was named pHCl according to the later identified features of the expressed channel (pH-sensitive chloride channel) has an open reading frame of 1464 nucleotides that predicts a protein of 487 amino acids (56 kDa). The extracellular N terminus consists of 277 amino acids in toto, starts with a signal peptide of 18 amino acids (30Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. Von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4923) Google Scholar) followed by the conserved Cys-bridge (positions 195 and 209) and the four predicted transmembrane regions (M1-M4) conserved in ligand gated-chloride channels (Fig. 1A). A hydrophobicity plot detects three hydrophobic regions in the central part and one at the C-terminal part that fit to the location of M1–M4 in other LGICs (data not shown). The putative pore forming M2 region of pHCl is similar to the M2 region of other ligand-gated chloride channels, suggesting that the pHCl pore is chloride-selective also (Fig. 1B). As in other LGICs consensus sequences for putative N-glycosylation sites (positions 135, 180, 250, 263, and 336) and a protein kinase C-phosphorylation site (position 383) can also be detected (Fig. 1A). A putative orthologous gene exists in Anopheles gambiae; in addition to that, pHCl shows the greatest homology to invertebrate glutamate, teleosts, and mammalian glycine receptor subunits and exhibits a considerable amino acid identity with the D. melanogaster glutamategated (28%), the histamine-gated (23%), and the Rattus norvegicus α3-glycine-gated chloride channels (24%), respectively (Fig. 1A). However, a tree constructed of the known and postulated amino acid sequences of Drosophila LGICs shows that the pHCl protein does not fit into the GABA, glutamate, or histamine groups of LGIC and forms a sub-branch of its own (Fig. 2). Sequencing of the cloned cDNAs revealed the existence of several splice variants (pHCl-A, pHCl-B, and pHCl-C). We identified three sites of different splicing that can theoretically generate a variety of eight different splice variant combinations. In the N-terminal region (positions 68–92, Fig. 1A), a stretch of 25 amino acids is present (Variant 1, pHCl-A and pHCl-B) or lacking (pHCl-C) due to the presence or absence of an exon in the mRNA. In the region located at M1–M2, at the splicing site 2, pHCl-C differs at five positions due to the alternative use of an exon in the mRNA (Variant 2, Fig. 1A). In the cytoplasmic loop between M3 and M4, pHCl-A differs at a stretch of 17 amino at the splicing site 3. In the variants pHCl-B and pHCl-C, the stretch is absent due to the usage of different splice sites (positions 385–401, Fig. 1A). Localization and Stage-specific Expression of Splice Variants—To test if the mRNAs for these splice variants are expressed in a stage-specific expression pattern, we performed RT-PCR with splice variant-specific primer pairs (Fig. 3). In all tested developmental stages (egg, larvae, pupae, and adult fly) of Drosophila, the expression of the different variants pHCl-A, -B, and -C was detected with apparently no variations depending on the developmental stage and the type of the splice variant. To locate the expression of pHCl in different tissues qualitatively, whole mount in situ hybridization with 9- to 12-h old embryos and larvae I was performed (Fig. 4). Drosophila embryos as well as larvae I (Fig. 4, A–D) showed a strong expression of pHCl in the neural cord and a weaker expression in the hindgut (Fig. 4, B and C).Fig. 4Whole mount in situ hybridization with D. melanogaster embryos and larvae I. Antisense pHCl-A RNA probes labeled with digoxigenin-UTP detected high expression levels in the central nervous system/neural cord (A–D) together with a particular hybridization signal in the hindgut (B and C). The negative controls, sense pHCl-A RNA probes, showed no hybridization signals at all (E and F). Antisense probes: A, embryo lateral view; B, embryo dorsal; C, larvae I lateral; D, embryo ventral. Sense probes: E, embryo ventral; F, embryo lateral.

Changing the pH of the extracellular solution from pH 7.2 to 5.8 strongly reduced the membrane current, whereas changing it to a more basic pH of 9.0 evoked a non-desensitizing membrane current in pHCl-A-expressing oocytes (Fig. 5A). The splice variants pHCl-B and pHCl-C showed the same qualitative dependence of the current on the extracellular pH when expressed in oocytes (data not shown). The pHCl-A splice variant expressed most reliably in Xenopus oocytes and the electrophysiological characterization was therefore concentrated on this splice variant. All three pHCl-splice variants could also be functionally expressed in Sf9 cells, respectively, and were activated by basic and inhibited by acidic extracellular pH (Fig. 5B). The membrane current of non-transfected Sf9 cells showed no sensitivity to the pH of the extracellular solution. As Fig. 6 shows, the membrane current in pHCl-A-expressing oocytes was half-maximal at pH 7.33 ± 0.16. In normal frog Ringer's solution, the membrane current of pHCl-A-expressing oocytes was significantly higher than that of non-injected controls indicating that an additional conductance exists at pH 7.2 due to expression of pHCl-A (–777 ± –594 nA (n = 58) versus –136 ± –133 nA (n = 28)). We also observed that oocytes kept in Barth's solution of pH 6.0 remained longer viable than those kept at pH 7.2.Fig. 6Dependence of the membrane current of pHCl-A-expressing oocytes on the pH of the extracellular solution. Current amplitudes were referred to the amplitude induced by changing the pH from 7.2 (normal frog Ringer's) to pH 8 after subtraction of the current measured at pH 5.83. Data points were fitted by I/Imax = 1/(1 + (EC50/x)n) yielding a half-maximal activation at a H+ concentration of 4.71 × 10–8 ± 7.58 × 10–9 mol, which corresponds to a pH of 7.33 ± 0.16 and a Hill coefficient of 1.07 ± 0.18 (n = 3–5 per data point).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The current-voltage relationship of the additional membrane current in pHCl-A-expressing oocytes activated by enhancing the pH of the extracellular solution is slightly rectifying and has a reversal potential of –41 ± 5mV(n = 16) in normal frog Ringer's solution (Fig. 7). This is in the range of the reversal potential of –53 mV for chloride ions calculated by the Nernst equation assuming an intracellular chloride concentration of 15 mm. Reducing the extracellular chloride concentration to 36.3 and 12.1 mm shifts the reversal potential of the pH-induced current to more positive potentials (–28 ± 14 mV, n = 9 and –12 ± 17 mV, n = 9). To maintain a constant offset potential at the bath electrode we used agar bridges for measurements with low extracellular chloride concentrations.

There are four mammalian TIMPs (TIMP-1 to -4), and each TIMP has its own profile of metalloproteinase inhibition. TIMP-4 is the latest member of the TIMPs to be cloned, and it has never been reported to be active against the tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme (TACE, ADAM-17). Here we examined the inhibitory properties of the full-length and the N-terminal domain form of TIMP-4 (N-TIMP-4) with TACE and showed that N-TIMP-4 is a far superior inhibitor than its full-length counterpart. Although full-length TIMP-4 displayed negligible activity against TACE, N-TIMP-4 is a slow tight-binding inhibitor with low nanomolar binding affinity. Our findings suggested that the C-terminal subdomains of the TIMPs have a significant impact over their activities with the ADAMs. To elucidate further the molecular basis that underpins TIMP/TACE interactions, we sculpted N-TIMP-4 with the surface residues of TIMP-3, the only native TIMP inhibitor of the enzyme. Transplantation of only three residues, Pro-Phe-Gly, onto the AB-loop of N-TIMP-4 resulted in a 10-fold enhancement in binding affinity; the Ki values of the resultant mutant were almost comparable with that of TIMP-3. Further mutation at the EF-loop supported our earlier findings on the preference of TACE for leucine at this locus. Drawing together our previous experience in TACE-targeted mutagenesis by using TIMP-1 and -2 scaffolds, we have finally resolved the mystery of the selective sensitivity of TACE to TIMP-3.

Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP(s)) 1The abbreviations used are: TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase; ADAM, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase; MP, metalloproteinase (of the MMP, ADAM, and ADAM-TS families); MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; N-TIMP, N-terminal domain of TIMP; TACE, tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme; PDB, Protein Data Bank. are the endogenous regulators of the zinc-dependent metalloproteinases (MPs) of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase), and the ADAM-TS (ADAMs with thrombospondin repeats) families. There are four mammalian TIMPs identified to date (TIMP-1 to -4), and they are all small molecules of ∼24 kDa in molecular mass. The TIMPs are 40–50% identical in amino acid sequence (reviewed in Ref. 1Douglas D.A. Shi Y.E. Sang Q.A. J. Protein Chem. 1997; 16: 237-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and structural analysis reveals that the molecules are composed of two very distinct N- and C-terminal domains. The N-terminal domain (N-TIMP) encompasses nearly the first two-thirds of the polypeptide, and the domain is made up of five-stranded pleated sheets in the shape of a conical β-barrel. The tertiary configuration of the domain is typical of that of an oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding motif (2Williamson R.A. Martorell G. Carr M.D. Murphy G. Docherty A.J. Freedman R.B.

The C-terminal domain is ∼8 kDa in mass. In contrast to the N terminus, this domain is less well defined (3Gomis-Rüth F. Maskos K. Betz M. Bergner A. Huber R. Suzuki K. Yoshida N. Nagase H. Brew K.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5238-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). There are three disulfide bonds in each domain, but only the full-length and the N-terminal forms of TIMPs have been expressed so far and refolded from Escherichia coli inclusion bodies (6Williamson R.A.

TIMP inhibits the enzymatic function of an MP by inserting the wedge-shaped edge of its N-terminal domain, the so-called “MMP-binding ridge,” into the catalytic groove of the target MP to form a tight but essentially noncovalent 1:1 stoichiometric complex (3Gomis-Rüth F.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5238-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The MMP-binding ridge, by its very definition, is composed of the N terminus, the AB-loop, CD-loop, and the EF-loop of the molecule. Despite the high degree of similarity in their tertiary structures, each TIMP has its own range of metalloproteinase (MP) targets, and the profiles of MP inhibition among the TIMPs are acutely variable between the species. For instance, with the exception of several cell surface-bound membrane-type MMPs and MMP-19, all secreted MMPs are sensitive to TIMP-1 inhibition (11Stracke J.O. Hutton M. Stewart M. Pendás A.M.

Fridman R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2002; 12: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). TIMP-2, on the contrary, inhibits membrane-type MMPs as well as MMP-19 at subnanomolar affinities (11Stracke J.O. Hutton M. Stewart M. Pendás A.M. Smith B. López-Otin C. Murphy G. Knäuper V. J.

Cancer Biol. 2002; 12: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The ADAMs have slightly different sensitivity profiles in comparison to the MMPs. ADAM-10, for example, is inhibited by TIMP-1 and -3 and not TIMP-2 (13Amour A. Knight C.G. Webster A. Slocombe P.M. Stephens P.E. Knäuper V. Docherty A.J. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). TACE, in contrast, is selectively inhibited by TIMP-3 (14Amour A. Slocombe P.M. Webster A. Butler M. Knight C.G. Smith B.J. Stephens P.E. Shelley C. Hutton M. Knäuper V. Docherty A.J. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Notwithstanding the successful delineation of two co-crystal structures of TIMP·MMP complexes, namely TIMP-1/stromelysin-1 (PDB code 1UEA) and TIMP-2/MT1-MMP (PDB code 1BUV), the molecular basis that underpins TIMP/MP selectivity is still not fully understood. Unlike its counterparts TIMP-1, -2, and -3, the inhibitory characteristics of TIMP-4 with the MP have so far not been investigated in detail. Because it is the last TIMP to be isolated, our knowledge of its functions, biochemical or cellular, is admittedly still fairly limited. Our laboratory is interested in elucidating the molecular basis that governs MP/TIMP interactions, above all members of the cell surface-associated MPs that are of clinical importance, such as the tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme (TACE). TACE is unique among the MPs because of its versatility in the shedding of a broad range of membrane-bound bioactive molecules (reviewed in Ref. 15Kheradmand F. Werb Z. Bioessays. 2002; 24: 8-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is selectively inhibited by TIMP-3 and not the other TIMPs (14Amour A. Slocombe P.M. Webster A. Butler M. Knight C.G. Smith B.J. Stephens P.E. Shelley C. Hutton M. Knäuper V. Docherty A.J. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Biochemically, it is both interesting as well as challenging to unlock the molecular basis that underpins TACE/TIMP selectivity, and no TIMP is more challenging than TIMP-4. Hence, we chose TACE as the subject of our investigation in this study and TIMP-4 as the prototype for mutagenesis. In line with the design and progress of the project, the results are divided into three sections. In the first section, we compare the inhibitory characteristics of full-length and the N-terminal domain forms of TIMP-4 (N-TIMP-4) with TACE. In particular, the discrepancy between their affinities and association rates will be examined. In the second part of this paper, we describe the mutagenesis process leading to the creation of a potent, slow, and tight-binding TIMP-4 inhibitor. The relevance of the TIMP-3 AB-loop to the current project will be discussed in detail. The last section under “Results” deals specifically with residue Leu101, the pivotal amino acid on the EF-loop that is essential for TACE recognition. Combining our previous TIMP/TACE mutagenesis findings by using TIMP-1 and -2 as the scaffolds, we can now reveal the molecular basis that underpins the nature of the selective inhibition of TACE by TIMP-3.

Human TIMP-4 cDNA was given by Dr. Rob Nuttall and Dr. Dylan Edwards, University of East Anglia, Norwich, UK. Native full-length TIMP-4 was purchased from R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN. All chemicals and reagents in this study were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Vent DNA polymerase for mutagenesis and the restriction enzymes for subcloning were obtained from New England Biolabs (Hitchin, Hertfordshire, UK). The fluorescent substrate for TACE assay ((7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)-acetyl-Ser-Pro-Leu-Ala-Gln-Ala-Val-Arg-Ser-Ser-Ser-Arg-Lys-2,4-dinitrophenyl-NH2) was synthesized and purified by Dr. Graham Knight, Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, as reported in our early papers (17Lee M.H.

Construction and Site-directed Mutagenesis of Full-length and N-TIMP-4 Mutants—Full-length and the N-terminal domain forms of TIMP-4 (N-TIMP-4; corresponding to residue Cys1 to Gly128) were amplified from the human cDNA template by PCR before being subcloned into the E. coli expression plasmid pRSET-c (Invitrogen). A hexahistidine tag was added to the C termini of the TIMP-4 constructs during PCR amplification for the ease of downstream purification. Mutagenesis was achieved by either forward or reverse oligonucleotides, depending on the loci of the mutated sites. All clones have been sequenced to confirm that no unintended mutations have been introduced during the mutagenesis process. Production, Refolding, and Activity Assessment of Full-length and N-TIMP-4—The protocols for the production, refolding, and titration of full-length and N-TIMP-4 were almost identical to those of N-TIMP-2 elaborated in our previous papers with the exception that 0.6 ml-arginine was included in the refolding solution (17Lee M.H.

The concentration of active TIMPs in each preparation was determined by titration against a known amount of gelatinase-A (MMP-2) and/or collagenase-3 (MMP-13) as described before (19Lee M.H. Rapti M.

Inhibition Constant Measurement (Ki)—Inhibition (Ki) and association (kon) assays were performed at 27 °C constant temperature in fluorescence assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm CaCl2 supplemented with 0.05% Brij-35, 1% Me2SO, 0.02% NaN3) with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-50B spectrofluorimeter equipped with thermostatic cuvette holders (17Lee M.H.

TACE (0.22 nm) was preincubated at room temperature with TIMP-4 or its mutants, ranging from 0.1 to >1000 nm, for a minimum of 2 h prior to steady state (VS) measurement at 27 °C. Reactions were initiated by adding quenched fluorescent peptides to a final concentration of 1 μm. All data were fitted into competitive tight binding equations with the computer program Grafit to obtain an estimation of the Ki values with Equation 1 (20Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 201-301Google Scholar), VS=(Vo/2Et)×{(Et−It−Ki)+((Ki+It−Et)2+4EtKi)1/2}eq.1 Where Vo is the rate in the absence of inhibitor; Et is the total enzyme concentration, and It is the total inhibitor concentration. Association Rate Constant Measurement (kon)—kon measurements were performed by adding TIMP-4 or its mutants (up to 2000 nm) to 80 pm TACE. The rate of inhibition was monitored using a continuous fluorimetric assay at 27 °C until steady state was reached. The progress curve was analyzed by using Equation 2 (20Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 201-301Google Scholar), P=VSt+(Vo+VS)(1−e−kt)/keq.2 where P is the product concentration; Vo is the initial velocity; VS is the steady state velocity; and k is the apparent first-order rate constant of equilibrium between enzyme and TIMP complex. kon values were calculated by linear regression of k on TIMP concentrations. N-TIMP-4 Is a Far Superior TACE Inhibitor Than Full-length TIMP-4—TIMP-4 is the latest TIMP variant to be cloned, and our understanding of its inhibitory functions with the MMPs, the ADAMs, and the ADAM-TS proteinases in general is therefore very limited. To date, there have been several reports on the inhibitory activity of TIMP-4 with a number of MMPs and ADAM-TSs (21Stratmann B. Farr M. Tschesche H. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 987-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 22Troeberg L. Tanaka M. Wait R. Shi Y.E. Brew K. Nagase H.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), but none has so far looked at the ADAMs. As a first step toward delineating ADAM/TIMP-4 interactions, we compared the binding affinity and the association rate of full-length TIMP-4 and its N-terminal form, N-TIMP-4, with the ADAM proteinase, TACE. The results are listed in Table I. As shown, N-TIMP-4 is functionally much more active than full-length TIMP-4; its affinity (Ki 8.7 nm) was at least an order of magnitude better than that of the full-length species (Ki ∼120 nm). To rule out the caveat that the poor affinity of refolded full-length TIMP-4 is caused by misfolding in the C-terminal domain, we repeated the measurement using native TIMP-4 expressed and purified from the eukaryotic expression system (Ki >180 nm). The findings are unequivocal, i.e. full-length TIMP-4 is a much poorer inhibitor than N-TIMP-4. Further study on the association profile revealed that N-TIMP-4 is clearly a slow, tight binding inhibitor, whereas full-length TIMP-4 is not. The contrast between the two forms of TIMP-4 is best illustrated by their kon profiles, as shown in Fig. 1 (kon of N-TIMP-4 ∼6.4 × 10–3m–1 s–1; whereas no kon could be determined for full-length TIMP-4 because of its low inhibitory activity).Table IThe inhibitory constants (Ki) and association rates (kon) of full-length and N-TIMP-4 against TACEKikonkoffakoff is calculated by Ki × kon.

Open table in a new tab Strategy for Creating a Fully Active, Potent N-TIMP-4 TACE Inhibitor—In contrast to its counterparts the N-TIMP-1 (Ki 356 nm) and the N-TIMP-2 (Ki 893 nm), N-TIMP-4 is a comparatively better inhibitor in terms of TACE inhibition. On the other hand, its potency against TACE is still lagging behind that of the N-TIMP-3 (Ki 0.22 nm) (Table II). As part of our effort in the elucidation of the molecular basis that governs TACE/TIMP selectivity, we wondered if N-TIMP-4 could ever be engineered to be as potent as N-TIMP-3, and if so, which part(s) of the molecule should be targeted for engineering? The most likely candidates, in our conjecture, are the amino acids located at the MMP-binding ridge as these are the parts of the molecule that would be in direct physical contact with the target enzyme upon the formation of TACE·TIMP complex. Furthermore, we have demonstrated previously (17Lee M.H. Rapti M. Knäuper V. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17562-17569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 18Lee M.H. Rapti M. Murphy G. J. Biol.

Fig. 2 compares the primary sequences of N-TIMP-1, -2, -3, and -4. Clearly, the most conspicuous difference between the four TIMPs is the AB-loop region, and to a lesser extent residues 2 (Ser2) and 4 (Ala4) at the N terminus and residue 100 (His100) on the EF-loop. If our hypothesis on TIMP/MP selectivity is correct, these would be the residues worthy of investigation if the activity profile of N-TIMP-4 is to be tuned against TACE.Table IIThe inhibitory constants (Ki) and association rates (kon) of TACE with wild-type N-TIMP-1 to -4 and N-TIMP-4 mutants bearing mutations at the N terminus and the EF-loopsKikonkoffakoff is calculated by Ki × kon.

Open table in a new tab In this work, our strategy was to divide our mutagenesis targets into two categories. The first category consisted of mutants at the N terminus (i.e. residue Ser2 and Ala4) and the EF-loop (i.e. residue His100). The second category, on the other hand, was exclusively AB-loop-related. The residues that were deemed to be important for TACE selectivity were either retained or replaced by amino acids that are, according to our modeling prediction, capable of enhancing the affinity with TACE. The goals of the current project are 2-fold. In the short term, we intend to enhance the activity of N-TIMP-4 specifically against TACE for the purpose of finding out the part(s) of the TIMP molecule that is/are involved in TACE recognition and selectivity. If the objective can be attained, our long term goal would be to create a potent, TACE-inhibiting “N-TIMP-4 probe” to answer the many contentious issues surrounding the biological and cellular functions of TIMPs. First Category N-TIMP-4 Mutants, the N Terminus and the EF-loop—Three mutants were created in this category, namely Ser2 to threonine (S2T) mutant, Ala4 to serine (A4S) mutant, and Ala4 to methionine (A4M) mutant (Table II). S2T and A4S mutants were made because the second and the fourth residues in TIMP-3, the only native inhibitor of TACE, are threonine and serine, respectively (see Fig. 2). On the other hand, Ala4 was mutated to methionine (A4M) as our previous mutagenesis study with TIMP-3 showed that a bulky, hydrophobic side chain (such as methionine) at position 4 enhanced the affinity of N-TIMP-3 with TACE (24Lee M.H. Verma V. Maskos K. Nath D. Knäuper V. Dodds P. Amour A. Murphy G. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The findings are shown in Table II. Among the three, only S2T displayed possible signs of improvement in binding affinity (Ki, S2T of 7.7 nmversus wild-type N-TIMP-4 of 8.7 nm). The A4X mutants, regardless of the biochemical nature of the amino acid substitutes, are poorer inhibitors than the wild-type protein (Ki, A4S and A4M of 9.5–19 nm). The reason His100 was chosen for mutagenesis in this work was because of its close proximity to Leu101, a residue that, according to our hypothesis, could be of critical importance in TACE recognition (details will be elaborated below). Being adjacent to Leu101, His100 could in theory exert significant influence upon the movement of the Leu101 side chain or even the mobility of the EF-loop as a whole; hence the creation of H100T and H100G mutants to mimic the EF-loops of TIMP-1, -2, and -3, respectively (highlighted in Fig. 2). Of the two, H100G exhibited possible signs of improvement in affinity (Ki 7.6 nm), whereas H100T mutation severely compromised the activity of N-TIMP-4 with TACE (Ki ∼170 nm). Second Category N-TIMP-4 Mutants, Fine-tuning the AB-loop—None of the mutations carried out at the N terminus and the EF-loop significantly improved the affinity of N-TIMP-4 with TACE. If the affinity of N-TIMP-4 for TACE is to be enhanced to a level on a par with that of the N-TIMP-3 (Ki 0.22 nm), it is very unlikely that the mutations so far offer any realistic chance of success. In other words, the answer to the successful creation of a tight-binding N-TIMP-4 variant must lie elsewhere in the molecule. The next promising locus on the MMP-binding ridge was no doubt the AB-loop (Figs. 2 and 3). It is worth noting that the AB-loops of TIMP-2 and -4 are longer than those of the TIMP-1 and -3 by five to six residues (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the amino acid composition of the AB-loop is highly variable among the four TIMPs (Figs. 2 and 3). If the AB-loop is indeed the key that confers TACE-inhibiting activity upon TIMP-3, transplantation of the fragment onto TIMP-4 should generate a TIMP-4 inhibitor with improved affinity against the enzyme. Our modeling exercise on the TIMP-3 AB-loop suggests that the residues most likely to come into contact with TACE in a hypothetical TACE·N-TIMP-3 complex are Pro33, Phe34, and Gly35 (Fig. 3). The equivalent residues in TIMP-4 Thr38, Glu39, Lys40, respectively, as highlighted in Fig. 3 (upper panel). Could these residues be the key to TACE recognition? As the first step toward delineating the molecular significance of the loop, we created an N-TIMP-4 triple mutant with three amino acid substitutions: T38P, E39F, and K40G. Indeed, the Ki value of the resultant mutant (T38P/E39F/K40G) was an order of magnitude better than that of the wild-type N-TIMP-4 (Ki, T38P/E39F/K40G of 0.86 nmversus wild-type of 8.7 nm). Its association rate was almost 2.5-fold that of the wild-type inhibitor (T38P/E39F/K40G, kon of ∼16 × 10–3m–1 s–1versus wild-type of 6.4 × 10–3m–1 s–1) (Table III).Table IIIN-TIMP-4 mutants bearing T38P, E39F, and K40G mutationsKikonkoffakoff is calculated by Ki × kon.nm× 10-3 m-1 s-1× 105 s-1AB-loop mutant carrying triple mutationsT38P/E39F/K40GbMutants that carry the triple mutations T38P/E39F/K40G.T38P/E39F/K40G0.86 ± 0.2015.91 ± 0.021.37Mutants carrying single or double mutations at T38P/E39F/K40GcMutants with single or double mutations at the T38P/E39F/K40G site.T38P3.91 ± 0.816.47 ± 0.132.53E39F9.64 ± 2.153.51 ± 0.223.38K40G8.80 ± 1.365.84 ± 0.405.14T38P/E39F5.03 ± 0.718.44 ± 0.444.24T38P/K40G3.67 ± 0.857.39 ± 0.542.71E39F/K40G4.90 ± 0.386.74 ± 0.063.30Mutants with truncated AB-loop (ΔAB)dMutants with truncated AB-loop.ΔAB24.29 ± 2.454.17 ± 0.2110.13ΔAB + E39F60.68 ± 0.341.99 ± 0.2112.07ΔAB + E39F/K40G14.66 ± 2.843.04 ± 0.154.46ΔAB + T38P/E39F/K40G13.81 ± 0.915.18 ± 0.267.15a koff is calculated by Ki × kon.b Mutants that carry the triple mutations T38P/E39F/K40G.c Mutants with single or double mutations at the T38P/E39F/K40G site.d Mutants with truncated AB-loop. Open table in a new tab The findings, although impressive, immediately prompted two further questions. 1) Which residue(s) within the three is/are responsible for the improvement in activity? 2) Given that TIMP-4 AB-loop is five amino acids longer than that of the TIMP-3, what would the effects be for shortening the length of the AB-loop of N-TIMP-4 mutant T38P/E39F/K40G to that of the TIMP-3 AB-loop? To address the first question, we dissected the triple T38P/E39F/K40G mutation into six individual single and double mutants as follows: T38P, E39F, K40G, T38P/E39F, T38P/K40G, and E39F/K40G (Table III). Collectively, these six mutants should reveal the key residue(s) that is/are critical for TACE recognition. Among the three single mutants, only T38P demonstrated marginal signs of improvement in binding affinity (T38P, Ki of 3.91 nm versus wild-type N-TIMP-4 of 8.68 nm). The affinities of the other two were either impaired (E39F, Ki 9.86 nm) or not altered (K40G, Ki 8.80 nm). In contrast, all the double mutants displayed subtle enhancement in activities (Ki T38P/E39F, T38P/K40G, and E39F/K40G between 3.7 and 5.0 nm) (Table III). Most interestingly, the enhancement was noted even in the E39F/K40G double mutant (Ki 4.90 nm) that was made up of two single mutations (E39F and K40G) that on their own have either negligible or deteriorating effects on TACE association. To address the second question, we selected four N-TIMP-4 variants (i.e. wild-type N-TIMP-4, E39F single mutant, E39F/K40G doubl"

These proteins contain a central SPRY domain and a C-terminal SOCS box. Although some of the SOCS protein subfamilies function as adaptors for a large family of ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligases to regulate certain signaling pathways, the function of the SSB subfamily remains to be determined. In our previous studies, we have found that two SPRY domain-containing proteins, RanBP9 and RanBP10, interact with MET through the SPRY domain. In the present study, we explored the function of SSB proteins in the regulation of the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-MET signaling. Our results showed that all four SSB proteins also interacted with the MET. The MET interaction with SSB-1 was further investigated. We demonstrated that SSB-1 bound to MET tyrosine kinase domain through its SPRY domain. MET interacted with SSB-1 in both the absence and the presence of HGF, but HGF treatment resulted in the recruitment of more SSB-1 by MET. We showed that overexpression of SSB-1 but not other SSB proteins enhanced the HGF-induced serum response element (SRE)-luciferase activity. Overexpression of SSB-1 exhibited no effect on the basal level or epidermal growth factor-induced SRE-luciferase activity. SSB-1 also enhanced HGF-induced Erk phosphorylation. Suppression of SSB-1 by the RNA interference method down-regulated HGF-induced SRE-luciferase activity and decreased Elk-1 activation. These results suggest that SSB-1 may play an important role in enhancing the HGF-induced Erk-Elk-1-SRE pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrated that in response to HGF stimulation, the SSB-1 protein became phosphorylated at tyrosine residue 31. The phosphorylated SSB-1 protein bound to p120Ras-GTPase-activating protein (GAP) but did not promote the degradation of p120RasGAP, indicating that enhanced HGF-MET signaling by overexpression of SSB-1 was not dependent on p120RasGAP degradation.

The resultant GTP-Ras activates downstream signaling proteins until Ras returns to its inactive GDP-bound state by hydrolysis of the GTP through its intrinsic GTPase activity. The rate of Ras-GTP hydrolysis is strongly accelerated by the binding of Ras GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) (5Olson M.F. Marais R. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Functionally, Ras proteins lie at the center of signal transduction pathways, linking signals from cell surface receptors to the cytosol and the nucleus (5Olson M.F. Marais R. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 8Katz M.E. McCormick F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). An upstream signal stimulates the dissociation of GDP from the GDP-bound form followed by formation of the GTP-bound form, which leads to the conformational change of the downstream effector-binding region and facilitates the interaction between Ras and its downstream effectors. After binding to Ras, Raf-1 (a Ras effector) is translocated to the plasma membrane on which its serine-threonine kinase activity becomes activated. Activated Raf-1 then phosphorylates and activates mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (a dual kinase), resulting in the phosphorylation and activation of downstream serine/threonine kinases Erk1 and Erk2 (mitogen-activated protein kinases), which in turn activate Elk-1, a transcription factor involved in the ternary complex formation at serum response elements (SREs) (9Wasylyk B. Hagman J. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 213-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). There are several types of GAP of Ras in mammals, including the neurofibromatosis type 1 gene product GAP1m, as well as GAP1IP4BP, IQGAP1, and RasGAP (11Tocque B. Delumeau I. Parker F. Maurier F. Multon M.C. Schweighoffer F. Cell. Signal. 1997; 9: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). RasGAP, also called p120RasGAP according to its molecular weight, is one of the first identified and best characterized GAPs of Ras (10Vogel U.S. Dixon R.A. Schaber M.D. Diehl R.E. Marshall M.S.

The established role of p120RasGAP is its ability to stimulate the return of Ras to the inactive GDP-bound form. p120RasGAP binds preferentially to GTP-bound Ras and greatly enhances the hydrolysis of GTP from Ras (5Olson M.F.

The suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) protein family consists of more than 40 members. The SOCS box is about 50 amino acids in length and contains two blocks of well conserved amino acid residues. The C-terminal conserved region is an L/P-rich sequence of unknown function, whereas the N-terminal conserved region is a consensus BC box (13Zhang J.G. Farley A. Nicholson S.E. Willson T.A. Zugaro L.M. Simpson R.J. Moritz R.L. Cary D. Richardson R. Hausmann G. Kile B.J. Kent S.B. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. Baca M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The BC box structure is also found in elongin B and elongin C, two important proteins present in the E3 complex containing the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (15Kamura T. Sato S. Haque D. Liu L. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3872-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Based on their other domain structures, SOCS box-containing proteins can be divided into several subfamilies, including the SOCS subfamily (containing a SH2 domain), SSB subfamily (a SPRY domain), WD-40 repeat-containing SOCS box protein (WSB) subfamily (a WD-40 repeat), and ankyrin repeat-containing SOCS box protein (ASB) subfamily (an ankyrin repeat), and so forth (13Zhang J.G.

In all of these proteins, the SOCS box is located in their C termini, and other different domain structures are located in their middle or N-terminal regions (14Kile B.T. Schulman B.A. Alexander W.S. Nicola N.A. Martin H.M.E. Hilton D.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 235-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Although some of these subfamilies are components of or function as adaptors for a large family of E3 ligases to regulate certain signaling pathways (15Kamura T. Sato S. Haque D. Liu L. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3872-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), the function of certain members, such as the SSB subfamily, remains to be determined. In our previous studies, we have demonstrated that the SPRY domain of RanBP9 and RanBP10 is involved in the interaction between these two proteins and the MET tyrosine kinase domain (16Wang D. Li Z. Messing E.M. Wu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36216-36222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 17Wang D. Li Z. Schoen S.R. Messing E.M. Wu G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 313: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). RanBP9 and RanBP10 exhibit functional differences on MET signaling (16Wang D. Li Z. Messing E.M. Wu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36216-36222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 17Wang D. Li Z. Schoen S.R. Messing E.M. Wu G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 313: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the SPRY domain is a general protein-protein interaction interface mainly involved in the interaction of SPRY domain-containing proteins with receptor protein-tyrosine kinase kinase domains. Because the SPRY domains of the SSB subfamily show significant amino acid sequence similarity with RanBP9 and RanBP10, we investigated whether these SPRY domain-containing SOCS box proteins played a role in the regulation of MET signaling pathways. The SSB protein subfamily contains four members: SSB-1 (NP_079382), SSB-2 (NP_116030), SSB-3 (NP_543137), and SSB-4 (NP_543138). We demonstrated that all four SSB proteins can interact with MET. SSB-1 through its SPRY domain interacts with the MET tyrosine kinase domain, and the interaction was regulated positively by HGF. We also demonstrated that, upon HGF stimulation, SSB-1 is phosphorylated at its tyrosine residue 31 and phosphorylated SSB-1 can interact with p120RasGAP. Furthermore, SSB-1 enhances the HGF-MET-induced Erk-Elk-1-SRE pathway. These results suggest that SSB-1 is an important regulator in the HGF-MET signaling. Cell Culture, Transient Transfection, and Other Reagents—HeLa and HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing penicillin (25 units/ml), streptomycin (25 μg/ml), and 10% fetal bovine serum. Serum-starved cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfection of plasmids, except for the transfection of RNAi constructs, was performed using SuperFect (Qiagen) transfection solution according to the manufacturer's protocol. Plasmid Construction—pcDNA4C-SSB-1, pcDNA4C-SSB-2, pcDNA4C-SSB-3, and pcDNA4C-SSB-4 were constructed by inserting the corresponding PCR products into the pcDNA4C vector. The primers harboring the BamHI (forward primer) and EcoRI (reverse primer) site, respectively, were used to amplify the open reading frames of different human SSB cDNAs from a Marathone-ready kidney cDNA library (Clontech) for SSB-1 and SSB-2 and from Mammalian Gene Collection full-length cDNA clones for SSB-3 and SSB-4. pGFP-C3-SSB-1 and pcDNA4C-p120RasGAP-N were constructed with a similar strategy. pcDNA4C-p120RasGAP-N contains the N terminus of p120RasGAP, nucleotide 1–1333 of p120RasGAP open reading frame amplified from a first-strand human kidney cDNA. pKH3-SSB-1 was constructed by transferring the open reading frame of SSB-1 from pcDNA4C-SSB-1 to pKH3 through EcoRI and BamHI sites. pcDNA4C-SSB-1 (Y2P) and pKH3-SSB-1 (Y2P) were constructed based on wild-type pcDNA4C-SSB-1 by PCR-based mutagenesis. The codon for tyrosine residue 31 (Y2) of SSB-1 was mutated from TAT to TTT, corresponding to a tyrosine to phenylalanine change at the amino acid level. All inserts of the constructs involved in PCR amplification were confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. GST Pull-down Assay—This assay was performed as described previously (17Wang D. Li Z. Schoen S.R. Messing E.M. Wu G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 313: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, GST or GST fusion proteins were expressed in BL21 cells and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B MicroSpin columns (Amersham Biosciences). Equal amounts of GST or GST fusion proteins were added into glutathione-Sepharose 4B MicroSpin columns and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The in vitro expressed c-Myc-fused MET C-terminal fragment (amino acids 1102–1408) produced in the TnT system (Promega) was then added into each reaction and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. Bound proteins were eluted, and 20 μl of each eluted protein was resolved on a SDS polyacrylamide gel followed by Western blot analysis using anti-c-Myc antibody. Co-immunoprecipitation Assay—HGF (Sigma), EGF (Amersham Biosciences), antibodies including anti-His and anti-GFP monoclonal antibodies, anti-HA, anti-actin polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-MET monoclonal antibody, anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-pTyr), anti-p120RasGAP polyclonal antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology), and anti-c-Myc antibody (BD Biosciences) were purchased from commercial sources as indicated. Co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed as described previously (16Wang D. Li Z. Messing E.M. Wu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36216-36222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Cell lysates (500 μg of total proteins) were incubated with immunoprecipitation antibody and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. Thirty μl of protein A/G-agarose was then added into each mixture, which was then rotated at 4 °C for 2 h, centrifuged, washed three times, and resolved on a SDS polyacrylamide gel followed by Western blot analysis. SRE Dual Luciferase Assay—HeLa Cells were plated in 12-well dishes and transfected with different combinations of testing plasmids and the SRE-luciferase (SRE-LUC) reporter plasmid plus internal control plasmid pRL-SV40. Twelve h after transfection, cells were serumstarved for 16–18 h and then treated with or without HGF (30 ng/ml) or EGF (200 ng/ml) for 8 h. Cells were lysed, and the dual luciferase assay was performed using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter 1000 Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Mean values of luciferase activity relative to the HGF-untreated and pcDNA4C-transfected control were calculated from triplicate wells. pG5 Dual Luciferase Assay—HeLa Cells were plated in 12-well dishes and transfected with different combinations of testing plasmids and the pGal4-Elk-1 plasmid and the pG5-LUC reporter plasmid plus internal control plasmid pRL-SV40. Twelve h after transfection, cells were serum-starved for 16–18 h and then treated with or without HGF (30 ng/ml) for 8 h. Cells were lysed, and the dual luciferase assay was performed using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter 1000 Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Mean values of luciferase activity relative to the HGF-untreated and pMCV-U6-transfected control were calculated from triplicate wells. Construction and Transfection of DNA Vector-based RNA Interference Plasmids—Small interfering RNA (siRNA) target sites were selected by scanning the cDNA sequence for AA dinucleotides via siRNA target finder (Ambion), recording the 19 nucleotides that start with G or A immediately downstream of the AA, and then analyzing them by the BLAST search to eliminate any sequences with significant homology to other genes. The siRNA inserts, containing selected 19-nucleotide coding sequences followed by a 9-nucleotide spacer, an inverted repeat of the coding sequences, plus 6 threonine residues, were generated as double-stranded DNAs with ApaI and EcoRI sites with primer extension and then subcloned into plasmid pMSCV/U6 at the ApaI/EcoRI site. The corresponding oligonucleotides for generating the SSB-1-RNAi-A insert are 5′-GTTAACTCTCTTAGAGTCTTTCAAGAGAAGACTCTAAGAGAGTTAACTTTTTT-3′ (forward) and 5′-AATTAAAAAAGTTAACTCTCTTAGAGTCTTCTCTTGAAAGACTCTAAGAGAGTTAACGC C-3′ (reverse). The corresponding oligonucleotides for generating the SSB-1-RNAi-B insert are 5′-ATGTACATTACCCCCTTATTTCAAGAGAATAAGGGGGTAATGTACATTTTTT-3′ (forward) and 5′-AATTAAAAAAATGTACATTACCCCCTTATTCTCTTGAAATAAGGGGGTAATGTACATGGCC-3′ (reverse). The corresponding oligonucleotides for generating the SSB-1-RNAi-NC-C are 5′-ATAGCCTCACGTGCAATCTTTCAAGAGAAGATTGCACGTGAGGCTATTTTTTT-3′ (forward) and 5′-AATTAAAAAAATGCCTCACGTGCAATCTTCTCTTGAAAGATTGCACGTGAGGCTATGGCC-3′ (reverse). The corresponding oligonucleotides for generating the SSB-1-RNAi-Sc-B (scramble-sequenced RNAi-B) are 5′-ATTTAGTAAACCCTTCCCCTCAAGAGAGGGAAAGGGTTTACTAAATTTTTTT-3′ (forward) and 5′-AATTAAAAAAATTTAGTAAACCCTTTCCCTCTCTGAGGGGAAAGGGTTTACTAAATGGCC-3′ (reverse). These constructs were transfected into in HeLa cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) transfection solution according to the manufacturer's protocol. Thirty-six h after transfection, the cells were collected by trypsinization and reseeded in the selective medium, growth medium plus 1 μg/ml puromycin (BD Biosciences). Twenty-four h after the treatment, all nontransfected cells floating in the medium were washed away. The transfected cells were allowed to proliferate for 2 days and collected for RNA isolation and real time PCR. RNA Isolation and Real Time Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNAs were extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. One μg of RNA was subjected to reverse transcription using Superscript II (Invitrogen). The reactions were incubated at 42 °C for 50 min. The SSB-1 primers, 5′-ACGCTATCAGGGGCAAAGTCG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGCTACCAGGAAGGAGTCAGG-3′ (antisense), and the β-actin primers (as a control), 5′-GATCATTGCTCCTCCTGAGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-TGTGGACTTGGGAGAGGACT-3′ (antisense), were used in our experiments. Real time PCR was performed with 5 μl of 10-fold diluted reverse transcription product, 25 μlof2× SYBR green PCR master mix (Bio-Rad), and 1 μl of each primer (10 μm) in a total volume of 50 μl. PCR was performed on an iCycler iQ multicolor real time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad), and cycling conditions were 95 °C for 10 min followed by 50 cycles of 95 °C for 20 s, 55 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. Each sample was run in triplicate. Data were analyzed by iCycler iQ software (Bio-Rad). SSB Proteins Contains a SPRY Domain Similar to the One in RanBP9 and RanBP10 —SSB proteins contain a central SPRY domain and a C-terminal SOCS box. There are a total of four putative SSB proteins encoded in the human genome, namely SSB-1, SSB-2, SSB-3, and SSB-4. The SPRY domain is also present in a variety of other proteins including RanBP9 and RanBP10 (16Wang D. Li Z. Messing E.M. Wu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36216-36222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 17Wang D. Li Z. Schoen S.R. Messing E.M. Wu G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 313: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence alignment analysis using Vector NT I software revealed that the four SSB proteins share an overall 71.4% positive and 10.6% identity of their amino acid sequences. SSB-1 shares 50 and 75% amino acid sequence identity with SSB-2 and SSB-4, respectively. SSB-3 possesses a long N-terminal extension and shares the least amino acid sequence identity with the rest of the SSB proteins. SSB-3 only shares 16% identity with SSB-1. SSB-1 contains a tyrosine residue in the context of YXXP in its N-terminal region. However, this feature is not conserved among other SSB proteins (Fig. 1). The alignment also revealed that the SSB protein family has higher similarity in its SPRY domains and SOCS boxes (Fig. 1). Among the four SSB proteins, they share 96.2% positives and 19.1% identity in their SPRY domains and 89.4% positives and 19.1% identity in their SOCS boxes. Their SPRY domains share a high degree of similarity with the SPRY domains in RanBP9 and RanBP10 with the positive of 75.7% (Fig. 1). We have demonstrated in our previous studies that the SPRY domains in RanBP9 and RanBP10 are responsible for their interactions with the tyrosine kinase domain of MET (16Wang D. Li Z. Messing E.M. Wu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36216-36222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 17Wang D. Li Z. Schoen S.R. Messing E.M. Wu G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 313: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). As SSB proteins also contain a SPRY domain, which shares high sequence similarity with the ones in RanBP9 and RanBP10, we further tested whether these proteins could also interact with MET. SSB Proteins Interact with MET—HEK293 cells, a human embryonic kidney cell line, transfected with pcDNA4-SSB-1, -2, -3, -4 or the parental vector pcDNA4, respectively, were harvested and lysed. The lysates were then immunoprecipitated with anti-MET antibody. Immunoblotting with anti-His6 antibody and anti-MET antibody revealed that His6-tagged SSB-1, SSB-2, SSB-3, and SSB-4 were co-immunoprecipitated with MET but not with the control anti-GFP antibody (Fig. 2A), demonstrating that these SSB proteins could interact with MET. The interaction between MET and one of the SSB proteins, SSB-1, was further tested by a GST pull-down assay, in which the fusion protein of c-Myc and MET tyrosine kinase domain was able to bind to the GST·SSB-1 fusion protein but not by GST alone (Fig. 2B). This result demonstrated the direct interaction between SSB-1 and MET tyrosine kinase domain. A second set of GST pull-down assays mapped the MET-interacting region in SSB-1, not surprisingly, to its SPRY domain (Fig. 2C). These data further confirmed that the SPRY domain is involved in protein-protein interaction. As a receptor protein-tyrosine kinase, MET is phosphorylated and activated upon stimulation with its ligand, HGF. We therefore tested the interaction between SSB-1 and MET in the presence or absence of HGF stimulation by a co-immunoprecipitation assay. The experiments were conducted three times, and the data were quantified using ImageQuant software. All of the three experiments showed that in the presence of HGF more GFP·SSB-1 fusion proteins (∼4-fold increase) were co-immunoprecipitated with the anti-MET antibody, indicating that HGF stimulation has a positive effect on the interaction between SSB-1 and MET (Fig. 2D). This is consistent with our previous finding that the interaction between MET and RanBP9 through its SPRY domain can be enhanced with HGF treatment (16Wang D. Li Z. Messing E.M. Wu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36216-36222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 17Wang D. Li Z. Schoen S.R. Messing E.M. Wu G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 313: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). SSB-1 Enhances HGF-induced SRE-LUC Reporter Gene Expression and Erk Phosphorylation—Although the four SSB proteins are quite similar in terms of their amino acid sequences and their abilities to interact with MET tyrosine kinase domain, our luciferase assay showed that they differed in their effects on HGF-induced SRE-LUC expression (Fig. 3A). Our results indicated that overexpression of SSB-1 but not other SSB proteins can enhance the HGF-induced SRE-LUC expression (Fig. 3A) without affecting the basal SRE-LUC expression or the EGF-induced SRE-LUC expression (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, our Western blot analysis showed that the HGF-induced Erk phosphorylation in HEK293 cells was also enhanced ∼5-fold upon SSB-1 overexpression (Fig. 3C). The quantification was based on three independent experiments. These data demonstrated that, when overexpressed, only SSB-1 could enhance the HGF-induced Erk-SRE signaling. Suppression of SSB-1 by siRNA Represses HGF-induced SRE-LUC and pG5-LUC Expression—To further investigate the role of SSB-1 on the HGF-induced Erk-SRE signaling, we suppressed SSB-1 expression using a RNAi technique. Potential inhibitory sequences were constructed into the pMSCV/U6 vector and transfected into HeLa cells. RNAs were then extracted from these cells and used as templates in real time reverse transcription-PCR to analyze the mRNA expression of SSB-1. pMSCV/U6-RNAi-B and pMSCV/U6-RNAi-A were found to be able to inhibit SSB-1 mRNA expression by 60 and 25%, respectively. pMSCV/U6-RNAi-NC-C did not show an inhibitory effect and served as a negative control (NC). A scramble RNAi-B (pMSCV/U6-RNAi-Sc-B) was also constructed and served as another negative control (Fig. 4A). Consistent with the mRNA level, we found that SSB-1 protein expression was also suppressed by pMSCV/U6-RNAi-B and pMSCV/U6-RNAi-A. Each of these siRNA constructs was transfected into HeLa cells at a 1:1 transfection ratio with pKH3-SSB-1. pEGFP-C3 in an amount equal to 5% of the total DNA was also included in the transfection. Fifty μg of whole cell lysate proteins from each sample was used for the Western blot an"

Amino acids 29, 100, 116, 123, 129, 140-143, 141, 146, 152, 154, 155, 173, 181, 183-187, 189, 190, 191, 192, and 193 in RhoB were mutated to the corresponding RhoA residues to determine those critical for RhoB tumor-suppressive activity. Of all the mutants made, only the cysteine 192 (one of two palmitoylation sites) and cysteine 193 (the prenylation site) point mutations abolish RhoB functions. In contrast, mutation of the other palmitoylation site, cysteine 189, did not affect RhoB functions. Moving cysteine 192 to position 190 did not affect RhoB function either. Mutation of cysteine 192 to glycine, alanine, or serine blocks the ability of RhoB to suppress transforming growth factor β type II receptor, p2lwaf, and AP-1 promoter transcriptional activities. Furthermore, mutations of cysteines 192 and 193, but not 189, mislocalize RhoB and prevent RhoB from inhibiting anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent tumor growth and colony formation as well as prevent it from inducing apoptosis. The cysteine 192 RhoB mutant is farnesylated and geranylgeranylated as efficiently as wild type RhoB. A RhoA-(1-180)/RhoB-(181-196) chimera inhibited tumor cell proliferation and induced apoptosis as efficiently as RhoB. These results demonstrate that the presence of neither cysteine 193 nor cysteine 192 alone is sufficient and that both palmitoylated cysteine 192 and prenylated cysteine 193, but not palmitoylated cysteine 189, are required for RhoB tumor-suppressive and proapoptotic activities.

Rho proteins are GTP/GDP binding GTPases that belong to the Ras superfamily and are intimately involved in diverse cellular processes and diseases (1Symons M. Rusk N. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: R409-R418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). For example, Rho proteins are pivotal in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton processes such as lamellipodia, fiber, and membrane ruffle formation (2Fukata M. Nakagawa M. Kaibuchi K. Curr. Opin.

Rho proteins also regulate signal transduction proteins such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38, and stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) that are involved in the mitogen- and stress-activated kinase pathways (4Chang F. Steelman L.S. Lee J.T. Shelton J.G. Navolanic P.M. Blalock W.L. Franklin R.A. McCubrey J.A. Leukemia. 2003; 17: 1263-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Most important is the involvement of Rho GTPases as mediators of proliferation and malignant transformation. For example, RhoA and Rac1 are critical for the G1/S cell division cycle traverse (5Welsh C.F. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2004; 84: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and mediate oncogenic Ras malignant transformation (5Welsh C.F. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2004; 84: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 6Downward J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (2544) Google Scholar). In cellular and animal models Rho proteins such as RhoA, Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoC have been implicated in invasion and metastasis, and RhoC has been shown to contribute to metastasis in clinical settings (5Welsh C.F. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2004; 84: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 6Downward J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (2544) Google Scholar, 7Clark E.A. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Hynes R.O. Nature. 2000; 406: 532-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar). Although most Rho proteins are involved in promoting oncogenesis, invasion, and/or metastasis, mounting evidence points to a tumor-suppressive role for RhoB. First, in cultured cells RhoB inhibits oncogenic signaling (8Chen Z. Sun J. Pradines A. Favre G. Adnane J. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17974-17978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 9Fritz G. Kaina B. J. Biol.

Biol. 2000; 20: 6105-6113Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Second, ectopic expression of RhoB suppresses the growth of human cancer cells in nude mice (8Chen Z. Sun J. Pradines A.

Biol. 2004; 24: 5565-5576Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Third, RhoB knockout mice are more sensitive to chemically induced tumors (12Liu A.X. Rane N. Liu J.P. Prendergast G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6906-6912Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and RhoB (-/-) cells are resistant to apoptosis induced by radiation and cytotoxic agents (13Liu A. Cerniglia G.J. Bernhard E.J. Prendergast G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6192-6197Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Fourth, ectopic expression of RhoB suppresses epidermal growth factor receptor-, ErbB2-, Ras-, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-, and Akt-induced tumor survival, proliferation, invasion, and metastasis (11Jiang K. Sun J. Cheng J. Djeu J.Y. Wei S. Sebti S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5565-5576Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 14Jiang K. Delarue F.L. Sebti S.M. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1136-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Fifth, many oncogenes such as the epidermal growth factor receptor, Ras, and Akt suppress the expression of RhoB (11Jiang K. Sun J. Cheng J. Djeu J.Y. Wei S. Sebti S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5565-5576Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 14Jiang K. Delarue F.L. Sebti S.M. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1136-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Finally, in patients with head and neck, lung, and brain cancers, RhoB protein levels are drastically decreased as the tumors become more aggressive and highly invasive (15Adnane J. Muro-Cacho C. Mathews L. Sebti S.M. Munoz-Antonia T. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 2225-2232PubMed Google Scholar, 16Mazieres J. Antonia T. Daste G. Muro-Cacho C. Berchery D. Tillement V. Pradines A. Sebti S.

Metastasis. 2002; 19: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The above studies suggest that RhoB plays a critical role in suppressing malignant transformation by blocking oncogenic and tumor survival pathways and that oncogenes such as Ras and the epidermal growth factor receptors suppress RhoB expression as a step toward malignant transformation. The fact that RhoA and RhoB have opposing effects on malignant transformation is intriguing, considering that RhoA and RhoB share 86% amino acid identity. Presently, it is not understood why RhoA promotes, whereas RhoB suppresses, malignant transformation. In this manuscript we have carried out site-directed mutagenesis studies with the goal of identifying those amino acids in RhoB that are critical to its tumor-suppressive activity. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-specific mutations were generated using the ExSite™ mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Target genes were modified by introducing a silent mutation to provide a new restriction site in the construct without affecting the coding residue (18Wang D.A. Lorincz Z. Bautista D.L. Liliom K. Tigyi G. Parrill A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49213-49220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). For the chimera construct, the boldfaced sequences shown in Table I are from RhoB, and the rest of the primer sequence was matched with RhoA (Table I). All mutants were verified by complete sequencing. The corresponding primers and silent mutation of all mutants are shown in the Table I.Table IPrimers used to generate RhoB mutants All sequences listed here are from the 5′ to the 3′ direction.

Cells were transfected with 2.5 μg each of expression construct using Cytofectene (Bio-Rad Laboratories) following the manufacturer's recommendation. Metabolic Labeling—HEK293 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were transfected with 5 μg of plasmid DNA per 100-mm dish. After transfection, cells were grown in 10% FBS/DMEM, 80 μCi/ml [14C]palmitic acid, and 5 mm sodium pyruvate for 48 h (19Adamson P. Marshall C.J. Hall A. Tilbrook P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20033-20038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed with 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% sodium azide, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin. Lysates were collected and centrifuged for 10 min (12,000 × g) at 4 °C. 70 μl of supernatant of each sample was used for Western blotting. The remainder of the supernatants was incubated with anti-HA agarose conjugate (Sigma-Aldrich) at 4 °C overnight. Pelleted beads were washed five times with lysis buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. In Vitro Translation/Prenylation—1 μg of each DNA construct was mixed with 25 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) and 3 μCi of 3H-labeled farnesyl diphosphate or 3H-labeled geranylgeranyl diphosphate at 30 °C for 90 min. For determining the protein levels produced in the in vitro translation assay, 20 μCi of [35S]methionine were used instead of 3H-labeled farnesyl diphosphate or 3H-labeled geranylgeranyl diphosphate. The labeled proteins were then run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (12.5%). The gels were then dried, labeled, and fluoro-graphed with Fuji x-ray film for 7-30 days at -80 °C (20Biermann B.J.

Regulation of AP1, p21waf, and TGFβ Receptor Promoter Activities— Panc-1 cells were seeded at 3 × 105 cells per well in 6-well plates. 24 h later they were transfected with 0.5 μg of p21waf-, TGFβ type II receptor (TGFβIIR)-, or AP-1 promoter-luciferase constructs (21Adnane J.

For p21waf and TGFβ receptor promoter activity analysis, cells were harvested 48 h later and lysed in 200 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). For AP-1 activity analysis, 24 h after transfection cells were washed once with DMEM and incubated in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS during the next 16 h before harvesting and lysis. Aliquots of cell extracts were assayed for β-galactosidase and luciferase activities. Colony Formation Assay—Two days post-transfection cells were trypsinized, counted, and seeded in duplicate into 6-well plates. Cells were cultured for 3 weeks before being fixed and stained with crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich) as described previously (8Chen Z. Sun J. Pradines A. Favre G. Adnane J. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17974-17978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Localization—2 × 105 HEK293 cells were seeded onto coverslips in 6-well dishes. Two days post-transfection cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized, and blocked with 0.2% Triton X-100 and 10% FBS in PBS. Transfected cells were stained with anti-HA antibody (Roche Diagnostics). Following three washes with PBS, the cells were incubated with a 1:250 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were visualized using a fluorescence microscope (Leica Microsystems, Bannockburn, IL), and pictures were taken with a digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI). Western Blot Analysis—Two days post-transfection, cells were washed once with cold PBS and lysed in 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, and 6.4 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate. Blots were incubated with specific antibodies as indicated in the legends to Figs. 1 and 2. Antibodies were incubated in 5% milk in PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% Tween 20 either 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Western blots were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence.Fig. 2Palmitoylation and localization of RhoA, RhoB, and mutants. A, HEK293 cells were transfected with RhoB, RhoB mutants (C192G, C192S, C192A, C189S/C192S, C193S, and C189S), RhoA, or vector and labeled with [14C]palmitic acid (14C-Palm) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Aliquots of the supernatant of total cell lysates were analyzed for expression levels by Western blot with anti-HA antibody, and the rest of the supernatants were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA-agarose and then analyzed on 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels for autoradiography. B, HEK293 cells were transfected with above constructs and stained with anti-HA and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody. Cells were visualized using a fluorescence microscope. C, in vitro translation/prenylation of RhoA, RhoB, H-Ras, C192S, RhoB, and C193S RhoB mutants was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 3H-F-protein, 3H-labeled farnesyl; 3H-GG, 3H-labeled geranylgeranyl-protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Anchorage-independent Growth Assays—For soft agar growth assays, the transfected Panc-1 cells were seeded at 5000 cells per well in 6-well plates in 0.3% agar over a 0.6% agar layer as described previously (11Jiang K. Sun J. Cheng J. Djeu J.Y. Wei S. Sebti S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5565-5576Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Cultures were fed once weekly until colonies grew to a suitable size (4 weeks) for observation. Colonies were photographed after 3 h of incubation with 1 mg/ml MTT in the DMEM medium. MTT Assay—Panc-1 cells were seeded on a flat-bottomed 96-well plate at 4 × 103cells per well in 10% FBS/DMEM and transfected the next day with 0.3 μg of each construct using Cytofectene in each well. 30 h later, medium was replaced with fresh 10% FBS/DMEM. After 2 days of culture, the medium was replaced with 1 mg/ml MTT in the DMEM medium for 3 h. Me2SO was added to each well before absorbance at 540 nm was read on an automated microplate reader. In Vitro Cellular Proliferation and TUNEL Assay—Two days post-transfection, cells were harvested by trypsinization and counted via trypan blue exclusion assay to determine cellular viability. Cells (10,000-25,000) were then spun onto glass slides using a Cytospin 3 centrifuge (Thermo Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA). After fixing cells to the slides with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.5) for 1 h at room temperature, cells were labeled for apoptotic DNA strand breaks by TUNEL reaction using an in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions and then mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to counterstain DNA. Fluorescein-labeled DNA strand breaks (TUNEL-positive cells) were then visualized using a fluorescence microscope (Leica Microsystems), and pictures were taken with a digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments). TUNEL-positive nuclei were counted and compared with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-stained nuclei to determine the percentage induction of apoptosis. RhoB/RhoA Site-directed Mutagenesis Screen of 27 Mutants Identifies Cysteine 192 as a Critical Amino Acid Required for RhoB Function—RhoA and RhoB share 86% amino acid sequence identity, yet RhoA promotes whereas RhoB suppresses tumorigenesis. To identify amino acids in RhoB that are critical to its tumor-suppressive activity, we first mutagenized amino acids 29, 100, 116, 123, 129, 140-143, 141, 146, 152, 154, 155, 173, 181, 183-187, 189, 190, 191, 192, and 193 in RhoB to the corresponding residues in RhoA (Fig. 1A and Table I). A RhoA-(1-180)/RhoB-(181-196) chimera was also made (Table I). The resulting 27 mutant proteins as well as wild type RhoB and RhoA were expressed in Panc-1 cells, and their effects on TGFβIIR promoter transcriptional activity were determined. We used the TGFβIIR promoter/luciferase reporter as an initial screen for RhoB function, as we had shown previously that RhoB suppresses TGFβIIR promoter activity (22Adnane J. Seijo E. Chen Z. Bizouarn F. Leal M. Sebti S.M. Munoz-Antonia T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8500-8507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Fig. 1B shows that all HA-tagged RhoB mutants as well as wild type HA-RhoB and wild type HA-RhoA were expressed in Panc-1 cells, whereas pcDNA3 vector-transfected cells were devoid of HA-tagged proteins as expected. Fig. 1C shows that ectopic expression of wild type RhoB but not RhoA resulted in inhibition of TGFβIIR promoter transcriptional activity. Of the 27 mutant proteins generated, only those in which cysteine 192 or cysteine 193 were mutated lost their ability to suppress TGFβIIR promoter transcriptional activity (Fig. 1C). Cysteine 193, the amino acid that is prenylated (both farnesylated and geranylgeranylated), has previously been shown to be important for RhoB function, whereas cysteine 192, one of the two palmitoylation sites (189 and 192) in RhoB, has not previously been implicated in RhoB function. Furthermore, whereas cysteine 192 was critical for inhibiting TGFβIIR transcriptional activity, cysteine 189, the other palmitoylated site, was not. Mutating both cysteines 189 and 192 to serines also abolished the ability of RhoB to inhibit TGFβIIR promoter activity. Mutating cysteine 192 to either glycine (the corresponding residue in RhoA), alanine, or serine all resulted in loss of the ability of RhoB to inhibit TGFβIIR promoter activity (Fig. 1C). In contrast, point mutations converting RhoB amino acids 29, 100, 116, 123, 129, 141, 146, 149, 152, 154, 155, 173, 181, and 191 to their corresponding amino acids in RhoA did not affect the ability of RhoB to inhibit TGFβIIR promoter activity. The RhoA/RhoB chimera behaved like RhoB, not RhoA (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, replacing RTDD (amino acids 140-143) in RhoB by the corresponding KPEE residues in RhoA had no effect on RhoB activity (Fig. 1C). Similarly, replacing YGSQN (residues 183-187) in RhoB with the corresponding RGKKK residues in RhoA or with AGAAA did not affect RhoB activity. Moving palmitoylated cysteine 192 to position 190 also did not affect RhoB activity. Finally, deleting the tripeptide GCI, residues 188-190 in RhoB, which is absent in RhoA, did not affect the ability of RhoB to inhibit TGFβIIR promoter activity (Fig. 1C). Cysteine 192 Is Required for RhoB Inhibition of p21waf and AP-1 Promoter Transcriptional Activities—The results described above clearly demonstrate that the presence of cysteine 192 or cysteine 193 alone is insufficient and that they must both be present in RhoB in order for this protein to suppress TGFβIIR promoter transcriptional activity. To further confirm the importance of these two amino acids in RhoB function, we evaluated the effects of the corresponding mutant proteins on p21waf and AP-1 promoter activities. Panels D and E in Fig. 1 show that ectopic expression of either wild type RhoB or the C189S RhoB mutant resulted in inhibition of p21waf and AP-1 promoter activities. In contrast, the RhoA and RhoB point mutants C193S, C192S, C192A, C192G, and the double mutant C189S/C192S were unable to inhibit p21waf and AP-1 promoter activity. C192S and C193S Mutations Inhibit Palmitoylation and Mislocalize RhoB—We next determined the effect of cysteines 189, 192, and 193 on the palmitoylation and cellular localization of RhoB. As expected, mutating both cysteines 189 and 192 to serines resulted in a RhoB protein devoid of [14C]palmitic acid labeling (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, mutating one of these two cysteines at a time resulted in half of the [14C]palmitic acid labeling as being on wild type RhoB, which contains both cysteines. Mutating cysteine 193 to serine prevented palmitoylation, suggesting that prenylation of cysteine 193 is required for palmitoylation of cysteines 189 and 192 to occur. Finally, as expected, RhoA, which is known to lack palmitoylation sites, was not found to contain any [14C]palmitic acid label (Fig. 2A). We next determined the effects of the mutations on the cellular localization of RhoB. Fig. 2B shows that wild type RhoB showed a punctate profile consistent with the previously reported endosome localization (19Adamson P. Marshall C.J. Hall A. Tilbrook P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20033-20038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas RhoA showed a diffused profile and was predominantly cytosolic. Furthermore, C192S and C193S RhoB mutants localized to the cytosol, whereas the C189S mutant showed a punctate profile similar to that of wild type RhoB (Fig. 2B). C192S Mutation Does Not Affect Prenylation of RhoB—There are conflicting reports on the importance of cysteine 192 on the prenylation status of cysteine 193. Whereas Adamson et al. (19Adamson P. Marshall C.J. Hall A. Tilbrook P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20033-20038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the cysteine 192 RhoB mutant becomes mainly farnesylated, Armstrong et al. (24Armstrong S.A. Hannah V.C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7864-7868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) found that the cysteine 192 mutant was both farnesylated and geranylgeranylated. Using in vitro translation/prenylation assays, we demonstrated that C192S RhoB mutant was farnesylated and geranylgeranylated as efficiently as wild type RhoB (Fig. 2C). Palmitoylated Cysteine 192 Is Required for RhoB to Inhibit Anchorage-dependent and Anchorage-independent Tumor Growth—Figs. 1 and 2 demonstrated that point mutations at one palmitoylation site (cysteine 192) but not the other (cysteine 189) resulted in a RhoB protein mutant that was mislocalized and unable to carry out its signaling function, thus leading to down-regulation of the transcriptional activities of TGFβIIR, AP-1, and p21waf promoters. We next determined the effects of the point mutations on RhoB tumor-suppressive activity. Fig. 3A shows that ectopic expression of wild type RhoB as well as the RhoA/B chimera, but not RhoA, inhibited proliferation (anchorage-dependent tumor growth) of PC3 tumor cells by 40%. In contrast, ectopic expression of the point mutants C193S, C192S, C192A, and C192G, but not C189S, abolished the ability of RhoB to inhibit PC3 tumor cell proliferation. We next determined the effects of the mutations on the ability of RhoB to inhibit Panc-1 tumor cell colony formation on plastic. Fig. 3B shows that wild type RhoB (137 ± 32 colonies) and point mutant C189S (146 ± 27 colonies) inhibited Panc-1 colony formation as compared with vector control (426 ± 23). In contrast, RhoA (663 ± 84 colonies) as well as the RhoB point mutants C192S (538 ± 68 colonies) and C193S (647 ± 97 colonies) increased Panc-1 colony formation. Similarly, Fig. 3C shows that wild type RhoB (39 ± 17) and RhoB point mutant C189S (94 ± 36 colonies), but not RhoA (469 ± 62 colonies), RhoB point mutants C192S (562 ± 78 colonies), and C193S (543 ± 89 colonies), inhibited soft agar colony formation (anchorage-independent tumor growth) relative to vector control (684 ± 117 colonies). Palmitoylated Cysteine 192, but Not Palmitoylated Cysteine 189, Is Required for RhoB to Induce Apoptosis—The Fig. 3 results discussed above show that the palmitoylated site of one cysteine (192) but not the other (189), along with the prenylation site cysteine 193, are critical for RhoB tumor cell growth. Because RhoB is also known to induce programmed cell death (apoptosis), we next determined the importance of cysteines 192 and 193 on the ability of RhoB to induce apoptosis by TUNEL staining. Panels A and B of Fig. 4 show that vector-transfected cells contained 10 ± 2% apoptotic cells, whereas cells transfected with RhoB, C189S RhoB, or the RhoA/B chimera mutant contained 19 ± 2%, 14 ± 2%, and 17 ± 1% apoptotic cells, respectively. In contrast, cells transfected with RhoA and the point mutants C193S or C192S contained only 4 ± 1%, 2 ± 0.4%, or 4 ± 0.5% apoptotic cells, respectively. Therefore, C192S and C193S mutations blocked the ability of RhoB to induce apoptosis. In this work we mutated 29 amino acids in RhoB to the corresponding residues in RhoA to identify those residues critical to the ability of RhoB to inhibit malignant transformation. We found that changing cysteine 192 in RhoB to the corresponding glycine in RhoA abolished the ability of RhoB to regulate transcription and to inhibit tumor proliferation, colony formation, and soft agar growth, as well as to induce apoptosis. In contrast, point mutations converting RhoB amino acids 29, 100, 116, 123, 129, 141, 146, 149, 152, 154, 155, 173, 181, and 191 to their corresponding amino acids in RhoA did not affect RhoB function. Furthermore, replacing RTDD (amino acids 140 to 143) in RhoB with the corresponding KPEE of RhoA had no effect on RhoB activity. Similarly, replacing YGSQN (residues 183-187) in RhoB with the corresponding RGKKK of RhoA or AGAAA did not affect RhoB activity. A RhoA-(1-180)/RhoB-(181-196) chimera was as efficient as RhoB in repressing TGFβ type II receptor promoter activity and inhibiting cell proliferation as well as in inducing apoptosis. Cysteine 192 is one of the two amino acids in RhoB that are posttranslationally modified with palmitic acid, and this palmitoylation has been suggested previously to be critical for the localization of RhoB to the endosomes (19Adamson P. Marshall C.J. Hall A. Tilbrook P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20033-20038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings are our results showing that the C192S mutant inhibited palmitoylation and was mislocalized. In contrast to cysteine 192, we have shown that cysteine 189, the other palmitoylation site, is not critical for the localization or function of RhoB. Furthermore, the deletion in RhoB of the tripeptide GCI (188-190), a peptide sequence that is absent in RhoA, did not affect RhoB function. Finally, moving cysteine 192 to position 190 did not alter RhoB function either. These results indicate that palmitoylated cysteine 192 but not cysteine 189 is required for RhoB function. We also found that cysteine 193, the site of RhoB that is prenylated by either a farnesyl or a geranylgeranyl group, is also required for the ability of RhoB to suppress transcription, inhibit proliferation and transformation, and induce apoptosis. This is consistent with previous reports that showed that mutating cysteine 193 to serine 193 or deleting the last four amino acids of RhoB, CKVL (193-196), results in loss of RhoB function (8Chen Z. Sun J. Pradines A. Favre G. Adnane J. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17974-17978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 25Lebowitz P.F. Du W. Prendergast G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16093-16095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that both (but not each alone) palmitoylated cysteine 192 and prenylated cysteine 193 must be present in RhoB for its tumor-suppressive and apoptotic activities. Previous work has demonstrated that cysteine 192 is critical for the proper cellular localization of RhoB (19Adamson P. Marshall C.J. Hall A. Tilbrook P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20033-20038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, there are no reports on the importance of this amino acid for the ability of RhoB to regulate transcription, malignant transformation, and apoptosis. Furthermore, there are conflicting reports on the importance of cysteine 192 on the prenylation of cysteine 193. Adamson et al. (19Adamson P. Marshall C.J. Hall A. Tilbrook P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20033-20038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that cysteine 193, which can be either farnesylated or geranylgeranylated in wild type RhoB, becomes mainly farnesylated in a mutant RhoB when the C-terminal five amino acids CCKVL (192-196) were changed to SCKVL. One interpretation given by the authors of this study was that cysteine 192 is critical to prenylation and that the double cysteine CC (192 and 193) is an important recognition site for geranylgeranyltransferase type I to transfer the geranylgeranyl group to cysteine 193. In contrast to this study, Armstrong et al. (24Armstrong S.A. Hannah V.C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7864-7868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) found that cysteine 192 was not important to the prenylation of cysteine 193 and that the C192S RhoB mutant was as efficiently farnesylated or geranylgeranylated as wild type RhoB. Our studies confirm those of Armstrong et al. (24Armstrong S.A. Hannah V.C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7864-7868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Also, consistent with this was a report from Baron et al. (26Baron R. Fourcade E. Lajoie-Mazenc I. Allal C. Couderc B. Barbaras R. Favre G. Faye J.C. Pradines A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11626-11631Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) demonstrating that RhoB prenylation on cysteine 193 is only driven by the nature of the three carboxyl-terminal KVL (194-196) residues. It is clear from our present study as well as from previous studies that a RhoB mutant lacking palmitoylated cysteine 192, but not 189, is unable to localize properly. What is even more important is that this mutant is inactive in its ability to suppress malignant transformation and induce apoptosis even though it is still prenylated. This finding, coupled with the fact that the RhoA/RhoB chimera behaves like RhoB not like RhoA, leads us to conclude that one of the major reasons for the opposing effects of RhoA and RhoB on malignant transformation may reside, at least in part, in their different cellular localizations, from which they affect different effectors."

Most sporadic cancers inactivate Rb by preferentially targeting the pathway that regulates Rb phosphorylation, resulting in resistance to apoptosis; this contrasts with Rb inactivation by mutation, which is associated with high rates of apoptosis.

The retinoblastoma protein (Rb) 1The abbreviations used are: Rb, retinoblastoma protein; pRb, phosphorylated Rb; LP, large pocket; LRR, leucine-rich region; WT, wild-type. 1The abbreviations used are: Rb, retinoblastoma protein; pRb, phosphorylated Rb; LP, large pocket; LRR, leucine-rich region; WT, wild-type. is a nuclear phosphoprotein that regulates proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. As a tumor suppressor, Rb inhibits proliferation by repressing E2F1-mediated transcription when hypophosphorylated. Hyperphosphorylation of Rb relieves E2F1 repression and allows cell cycle progression to occur (1Nevins J.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). The importance of Rb is underscored by the fact that Rb function is disrupted in virtually all human cancers (2Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4946) Google Scholar). Paradoxically and inconsistent with its role as a tumor suppressor, hyperphosphorylated wild-type Rb inhibits apoptosis in both cell culture and animal models (3Almasan A. Yin Y. Kelly R.E. Lee E.Y.

Because Rb inactivation is pivotal for carcinogenesis, this poses the problem of how cancer cells escape apoptosis when Rb function is disrupted.Inherited cancers and cells in which Rb is inactivated by mutation have increased rates of both proliferation and apoptosis (11Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E65-E67Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Most sporadic cancers preferentially inactivate Rb by hyperphosphorylation, which may occur through mutation of cyclin D, cdk4, or p16. Such cancers are generally slow growing and resistant to apoptosis induced by chemotherapy or radiation (12Shackney S.E. Shankey T.E. Cytometry. 1999; 35: 97-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It is possible that in these cancers the tumor suppressor function of Rb is inhibited, whereas the anti-apoptotic function remains intact (13Ma D. Zhou P. Harbour J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19358-19366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Inactivation by hyperphosphorylation might promote proliferation by increasing free E2F1, as well as inhibit apoptosis by retaining the anti-apoptotic function of Rb. This is consistent with evidence suggesting that it is the hyperphosphorylated form of Rb rather than Rb per se that protects cells from apoptosis (14Berndt N. Dohadwala M. Liu C.W. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 375-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The induction of apoptosis in various cell lines is accompanied by a shift in Rb from the hyperphosphorylated to the hypophosphorylated form (15Wang R.H. Liu C.W. Avramis V.I. Berndt N. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6111-6122Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 16Morana S.J. Wolf C.M. Li J. Reynolds J.E. Brown M.K. Eastman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18263-18271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Rb dephosphorylation, which has been shown to be required for apoptosis, occurs in the early stage of apoptosis (17Dou Q.P. An B. Will P.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9019-9023Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 18Joseph L.F. Ezhevsky S. Scott D.W. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 51-57PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of Rb dephosphorylation prevents apoptosis, whereas induction of dephosphorylation leads to apoptosis (19Wang H. Grand R.J. Milner A.E. Armitage R.J. Gordon J. Gregory C.D. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 373-379PubMed Google Scholar). In DBA/2 mice, increased levels of hyperphosphorylated Rb appear to mediate apoptotic resistance (20Wallace M. Coates P.J. Wright E.G. Ball K.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3597-3608Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). An increased level of hyperphosphorylated Rb is associated with a worse clinical outcome and greater chemoresistance as compared with Rb loss or normal levels of unphosphorylated Rb in patients with anaplastic large cell lymphoma (21Rassidakis G.Z. Lai R. Herling M. Cromwell C. Schmitt-Graeff A. Medeiros L.J. Am. J. Pathol. 2004; 164: 2259-2267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These observations all point to a pivotal role for hyperphosphorylated Rb in inhibiting apoptosis.Although the exact mechanism by which Rb inhibits apoptosis is unclear, it does not always require the inhibition of E2F1-mediated transcription by Rb. The increase in apoptosis seen in Rb-null embryos is only partially reversed in Rb and E2F1 double knock-outs (22Tsai K.Y. Hu Y. Macleod K.F. Crowley D. Yamasaki L. Jacks T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 3: 293-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (318) Google Scholar). A caspase-resistant Rb mutant, Rb-MI, inhibits apoptosis in response to tumor necrosis factor α-induced apoptosis by interfering with caspase 3 activation (23Chau B.N. Borges H.L. Chen T.T. Masselli A. Hunton I.C. Wang J.Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 757-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These results led to the postulate that Rb binds to and sequesters a nuclear factor that stimulates caspase 3 activation (24Chau B.N. Wang J.Y. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 130-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Although Rb binds to >100 protein partners, the majority bind to the hypophosphorylated form (25Morris E.J. Dyson N.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 2001; 82: 1-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar); yet it is the hyperphosphorylated form that predominates in most sporadic cancers.pp32 is a member of the ANP32 family of acidic, leucine-rich, nuclear phosphoproteins found in cells capable of self-renewal and in certain long-lived neuronal populations (26Walensky L.D. Coffey D. Chen T.H. Wu T.C. Pasternack G.R. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4720-4726PubMed Google Scholar). pp32 has been implicated in a number of cellular processes, including proliferation (27Malek S.N.

Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar).At a biologic level, pp32 inhibits transformation of rat embryo fibroblasts (36Bai J. Brody J.R. Kadkol S.S. Pasternack G.R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2153-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), possibly through its pro-apoptotic activity. It accelerates caspase activation by stimulating the apoptosome, but the in vivo significance of this is unclear. In contradistinction to its pro-apoptotic and transformation inhibition functions, pp32 is highly expressed in cancer (37Brody J.R. Kadkol S.S. Hauer M.C. Rajaii F. Lee J. Pasternack G.R. Am. J. Pathol. 2004; 164: 273-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In fact, pp32 is more highly expressed in highly malignant prostatic adenocarcinomas with Gleason scores of ≥5 than in clinically indolent tumors with Gleason scores of <5 (38Kadkol S.S. Brody J.R. Epstein J.I. Kuhajda F.P. Pasternack G.R. Prostate. 1998; 34: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These data suggest that high levels of pp32 might foster increased malignancy. We report here that hyperphosphorylated Rb and pp32 associate in a specific complex. The pp32-Rb interaction inhibits the apoptotic activity of pp32 and promotes increased proliferation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of Vectors—All PCR reagents were purchased from Qiagen. pp32 truncation constructs were generated via PCR amplification of desired pp32 sequences. Primers were designed using the Stanford primer program (genome-www2.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/SGD/webprimer). All pp32 constructs utilized a common upstream primer, and all downstream primers lacked a stop codon to facilitate COOH-terminal V5 epitope tagging. Following amplification from pp32, pp32r1, or pp32r2 plasmids, products were cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3.1/V5-His Topo TA (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. pp32Δ201–360 was constructed in two stages. Bases 1–201 and 360–747 were amplified separately. The upstream primer of bases 360–747 and the downstream primer of bases 1–201 had NheI sites at their 5′-ends. Both amplicons were NheI-digested and ligated, and pp32 upstream and downstream primers were used to amplify the ligation products. The PCR products were then cloned into pcDNA3.1/V5-His Topo TA (Invitrogen). All constructs were verified by sequencing.E2F1 and pRb plasmids were kind gifts from Fikret Sahin (Johns Hopkins) and Robert Weinberg (Massachussetts Institute of Technology), respectively. The Rb large pocket constructs WT-LP and PSM2T-LP were kind gifts from Erik Knudsen (University of Cincinnati). The pE2F-TA-Luc vector was purchased from Clontech.Cell Culture and Transfections—HEK 293, HeLa, and NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were passaged 2–3 times/week. All DNA transfections were carried out using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) as described by the manufacturer.Antibodies—The antibodies used for this study were anti-pp32, anti-V5 (Invitrogen), anti-E2F (KH95, BD Biosciences), anti-Rb G3-245 (BD Biosciences), anti-Rb G99-549 (BD Biosciences), anti-Rb G99-2005 (BD Biosciences), anti-Rb C-15 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and polyclonal anti-RB 851 (gift from Erik Knudsen). The anti-phospho-Rb antibodies used were anti-S795 (Cell Signaling) and anti-T249/252, anti-T356, anti-S612, anti-S780, anti-S807/811, anti-T821, and anti-T826 (all from BIOSOURCE).Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—1 × 106 HEK 293 cells were seeded onto a T-150 flask. 24 h later, cells were transfected with 15 μg of the indicated plasmids. 48 h post-transfection, cells were harvested, washed twice with cold PBS, and lysed with an M-PER mammalian protein extraction reagent (Pierce) containing 1× HALT protease inhibitor mixture (Pierce). Lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min at 16,000 × g to remove particulate material. The supernatant was precleared for 2 h with protein A-agarose (Roche). The pre-cleared cell lysates were mixed with the indicated antibodies and protein A- or protein G-agarose (Roche Applied Science) and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The next day the reaction mixture was washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline, boiled for 3 min, and eluted in 2× SDS buffer. The eluted materials were subsequently analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies.Proteins were separated in NuPAGE 10% bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Invitrogen). The immunoblot analysis used indicated specific antibodies and enhanced chemoluminescence (ECL)-based detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Where indicated, blots were stripped with Restore Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce) per the manufacturer's instructions.Reporter Assays—For reporter assays, NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with 1 μg of E2F-TA-LUC (Clontech), 0.5 μg of E2F1, 0.5 μg of pRb, and 1 μg of pp32V5 or pp32Δ201–360V5 expression plasmids as indicated. In all of the samples, 50 ng of the reporter vector pRL-TK (Promega) was included for normalization of the transfection efficiency. Total transfected DNA was kept constant at 3 μg with pcDNA 3.1 when necessary. 24 h after transfections, cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity using the Dual luciferase kit (Promega) per the manufacturer's protocol.Statistical analysis of the reporter data was carried out by one-way analysis of variance followed by a Tukey multiple comparison post-test to compare individual pairs of data sets. The analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software, version 4.0 (www.graphpad.com).Colony Formation Assays—1.5 × 105 NIH 3T3 or HeLa cells, as indicated, were seeded in 6-well plates overnight. 24 h later they were transfected with 1 μg of DNA containing the indicated plasmids. Total transfected DNA was kept constant at 2 μg with pcDNA 3.1 when necessary. 48 h after transfection, cells were split into a 100-mm dish containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 1% penicillin/streptomycin supplemented with 1000–500 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). The cultures were fed every 3–4 days. After 2 weeks, the cells were fixed with 95% ethanol and stained with 0.5% crystal violet in 95% ethanol, the plates were photographed, and the colonies were counted.Apoptosis Assays—1.5 × 105 HeLa cells were seeded in 6-well plates overnight. 24 h later they were transfected with 1 μg of DNA containing the indicated plasmids and 1 μg of vector control plasmid where necessary for a total of 2 μg of DNA. 48 h post-transfection cells were fixed with ice cold 100% methanol at –20 °C for 15 min. After fixation, cells were stained with 10 μg ml–1 Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes) for 10 min at 37 °C. Samples were mounted with mounting medium containing Prolong anti-fade reagent (Molecular Probes). Apoptotic cells were identified and counted using a Nikon microscope equipped with an epi-illuminator and appropriate filters. The percentages of apoptotic cells were determined from 300 cells counted in each of three independent experiments.RESULTSWe hypothesized that pp32 might interact with other proteins, such as Rb, that are involved in the regulation of pathways determining cell fate. To test this hypothesis, we screened for interactions by immunoprecipitation and identified Rb as a protein interacting with pp32.When V5 epitope-tagged pp32 was expressed by transient transfection of mammalian cells, an interaction between endogenous Rb and pp32V5 was detected by Western blot analysis following immunoprecipitation with either an anti-V5 (Fig. 1A) or an anti-Rb antibody (Fig. 1B). The interaction between Rb and pp32 can also be demonstrated in untransfected mammalian cells, including HeLa cells (Fig. 1C), suggesting that it is physiologically relevant.pp32 is made up of a nuclear localization signal, an acidic region, and a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) region that contains the nuclear export signal. Suppression of transformation and INHAT activity map to amino acids 150–174, slightly N-terminal to the acidic region. LRRs generally mediate protein-protein interactions (39Ohsumi T. Ichimura T.

Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The Rb-binding region of pp32 was mapped using V5 epitope-tagged constructs lacking the acidic region, the LRR, or both (Fig. 1D). Whereas deletion of the acidic region had no effect, the deletion of nucleotides 201–360 encoding amino acids 67–120 in the LRR of pp32 abolished Rb binding (Fig. 1E). Because the expression of pp32V5–201 appeared to be low in the lysate shown in Fig. 1E, the experiment was repeated with a higher expression level (Fig. 1F), yielding the identical result.As Rb functions are regulated by phosphorylation, we next determined which form of Rb (hypophosphorylated or hyperphosphorylated) interacted with pp32. V5 epitope-tagged pp32 was transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells, and the anti-V5 antibody was used to immunoprecipitate pp32V5. pp32 co-immunoprecipitated with hyperphosphorylated Rb because the V5 immunoprecipitates did not contain any hypophosphorylated Rb (Fig. 2, A and B).Fig. 2pp32 binds preferentially to Rb phosphorylated on Thr826.A, HEK 293 cells were transfected with pp32V5 or sham-transfected. Equal amounts of transfected cell extracts were precipitated with an anti-V5 antibody or an anti-neuron-specific enolase antibody (NSE) control as indicated. Equal amounts of sham-transfected cell extracts were precipitated with total Rb (C-15) or a control (AChE) antibody as indicated. The presence of hypophosphorylated Rb (Hypo Rb) in the immunoprecipitates (IP) was analyzed by immunoblotting using an antibody specific for hypophosphorylated Rb (G99-549). B, the blot in panel A was stripped and re-probed with total Rb (G3-245) antibody. C, HEK 293 cells were transfected with pp32V5 or LacZV5 (pcDNA3.1) or sham-transfected as indicated. Equal amounts of pp32V5- and LacZV5-transfected cell extracts were precipitated with anti-V5. As a positive control, sham transfected cell extracts were precipitated with antibody to total Rb (G3-245); this control, which precipitates considerably more Rb, is designated Sham. The presence of specific phosphorylated forms of Rb in the immunoprecipitates was analyzed by immunoblotting using the indicated anti-phospho-Rb antibodies. D, HEK 293 cells were cotransfected with the pp32V5 and control, WT-LP, or PSM2T-LP as indicated. Equal amounts of cell extracts were precipitated with an anti-V5 antibody. Top, the presence of WT-LP or PSM2T-LP in immunoprecipitates (IP) was probed by Western blot analysis using an anti-Rb antibody (851). The arrow on the right indicates the position of the Rb large pocket fragment. The lower band present in all three lanes is the immunoglobulin heavy chain, which serves as a loading control. Middle, anti-V5 immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-V5 antibody to confirm pp32V5 immunoprecipitation. Bottom, cell extracts were subjected to Western blotting with an anti-Rb antibody (851) to confirm expression of WT-LP and PSM2T-LP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Although not all Rb phosphorylation sites in vivo have been identified, Rb has at least 16 predicted cyclin-dependent kinase phosphorylation sites (40Lees J.A. Buchkovich K.J. Marshak D.R. Anderson C.W. Harlow E. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4279-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Differentially phosphorylated forms of Rb appear to exist in cells (41DeCaprio J.A. Ludlow J.W. Lynch D. Furukawa Y. Griffin J. Piwnica-Worms H. Huang C.M. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1989; 58: 1085-1095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar), and there is evidence that differential phosphorylation of Rb may regulate its functions. Phosphorylation of Ser807 and Ser811 regulates binding of Rb to c-Abl, whereas phosphorylation of Thr821 and Thr826 regulate binding to LXCXE proteins (42Knudsen E.S. Wang J.Y. J J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8313-8320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). To determine the specific phosphorylated form of Rb that binds to pp32, various phospho-specific Rb antibodies were used to probe an anti-V5 immunoprecipitate of pp32V5. These immunoprecipitates specifically reacted with an anti-phosphoThr826 Rb antibody (Fig. 2C). To further confirm that Rb phosphorylation at Thr826 is necessary for pp32 binding, we used the Rb large pocket constructs WT-LP and PSM2T-LP, which have been described previously (42Knudsen E.S. Wang J.Y. J J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8313-8320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). WT-LP encodes the wild-type large pocket fragment of Rb (amino acids 379–928), and PSM2T-LP is a double T821A/T826A large pocket mutant. pp32V5 was cotransfected with either control, WT-LP, or PSM2T-LP constructs into HEK 293 cells, and the anti-V5 antibody was used to immunoprecipitate pp32V5 complexes. pp32 co-immunoprecipitated with WT-LP but not with PSM2T-LP, suggesting that pp32-Rb interaction requires Rb phosphorylation at Thr826 (Fig. 2D).Because hyperphosphorylated Rb is unable to repress E2F1-mediated transcription, we used an E2F-luciferase reporter plasmid to investigate whether pp32 could increase E2F1-mediated transcriptional activity. Overexpression of pp32 consistently resulted in 3–5-fold increased transactivation of the E2F-luciferase promoter in the presence of excess E2F1 (p < 0.001 for E2F1 plus pp32 versus control; Fig. 3). This increased transcriptional activation could be decreased by overexpression of Rb (p < 0.001 for E2F1 plus pp32 versus E2F1 plus pRB plus pp32) and completely abolished by disruption of the interaction between Rb and pp32 via the deletion of amino acids 67–120 (p < 0.001 for E2F1 plus pp32 versus E2F1 plus pp32Δ201–360). Cells transfected with the reporter plus pp32 alone, E2F1 alone, E2F1 plus Rb, E2F1 plus pRB plus pp32, E2F1 plus pp32Δ201–360, or E2F1 plus pRB plus pp32Δ201–360 did not differ significantly from the control or from one another (p > 0.05). These results suggest that pp32 is able to sequester hyperphosphorylated Rb and thereby increase free E2F1. At the doses used in these assays, pp32 did not increase E2F-luciferase transactivation in the absence of E2F1 overexpression. It is probable that because there was enough endogenous Rb to bind E2F1 and pp32, the sequestration of Rb by pp32 was only unmasked when excess E2F1 was added to the system. The fact that pp32 has an acidic domain found in transcriptional activators raised the possibility that pp32 directly interacts with E2F1 to increase E2F1-mediated transcription. pp32 was transiently overexpressed in HEK 293 cells, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with E2F1 and Rb antibodies. Although pp32 was detected in Rb immunoprecipitates, it was absent in E2F1 immunoprecipitates (data not shown). These results rule out both direct and indirect interactions between pp32 and E2F1.Fig. 3pp32 increases E2F1-mediated transcriptional activity. NIH 3T3 cells were transiently transfected with E2F-luciferase reporter vector (pE2F-TA-Luc) and, where indicated, E2F1, pRb, pp32V5, or pp32Δ201–360V5 expression vectors. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. from three independent experiments performed in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because pp32 is pro-apoptotic whereas Rb is anti-apoptotic, we investigated the effect of Rb on the apoptotic function of pp32. In mammalian cells, transient overexpression of pp32 resulted in increased apoptosis as assessed by Hoechst staining (Fig. 4A). The apoptotic effect of pp32 was abolished by the coexpression of Rb. To further evaluate the effect of Rb on the pro-apoptotic activity of pp32 in mammalian cells, we performed a colony formation assay. pp32 overexpression resulted in a decrease in colony formation compared with vector control. Cotransfection of Rb with pp32 abrogated the pp32-mediated decrease in colony formation (Fig. 4B). The pp32Δ201–360 construct yielded greatly diminished levels of apoptosis, which precluded the demonstration that it was insensitive to the addition of Rb; this experiment would have provided more direct evidence that the apoptotic effects of pp32 are inhibited by Rb rather than by another mechanism.Fig. 4Association between Rb and pp32 correlates with the inhibition of pp32 apoptotic activity.A, pp32-induced apoptosis is abrogated by Rb in mammalian cells. HeLa cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding the indicated proteins. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst stain and examined by immunofluorescence microscopy for characteristics of apoptosis (membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation, and pyknosis). Cell death was quantified in HeLa cells transfected with the indicated expression constructs. The data (mean ± S.E.) are the percentage of nuclei counted with apoptotic morphology (n equals at least three experiments). B, duplicate plates of HeLa cells were transfected with control, pp32, or pRb expression plasmids as indicated and subjected to colony formation assay. Plates were stained with methylene blue, and the total number of G418-resistant colonies was counted after 14 days of selection. A representative experiment is shown. The bar graph (mean ± S.E.) shows the percentage change in colony formation efficiency with the colony counts normalized against the vector only control (n equals at least three experiments in duplicate).

Based on the crystal structures of Pdr and Pdx, a complex between the proteins was generated using computer graphics methods. In the model, Pdx is docked above the isoalloxazine ring of FAD of Pdr with the distance between the flavin and [2Fe-2S] of 14.6 Å. This mode of interaction allows Pdx to easily adjust and optimize orientation of its cofactor relative to Pdr. The key residues of Pdx located at the center, Asp38 and Trp106, and at the edge of the protein-protein interface, Tyr33 and Arg66, were mutated to test the Pdr-Pdx computer model. The Y33F, Y33A, D38N, D38A, R66A, R66E, W106F, W106A, and Δ106 mutations did not affect assembly of the [2Fe-2S] cluster and resulted in a marginal change in the redox potential of Pdx. The electron-accepting ability of Δ106 Pdx was similar to that of the wild-type protein, whereas electron transfer rates from Pdr to other mutants were diminished to various degrees with the smallest and largest effects on the kinetic parameters of the Pdr-to-Pdx electron transfer reaction caused by the Trp106 and Tyr33/Arg66 substitutions, respectively. Compared with wild-type Pdx, the binding affinity of all studied mutants to Pdr was significantly higher. Experimental results were in agreement with theoretical predictions and suggest that: (i) Pdr-Pdx complex formation is mainly driven by steric complementarity, (ii) bulky side chains of Tyr33, Arg66, and Trp106 prevent tight binding of oxidized Pdx and facilitate dissociation of the reduced iron-sulfur protein from Pdr, and (iii) transfer of an electron from FAD to [2Fe-2S] can occur with various orientations between the cofactors through multiple electron transfer pathways that do not involve Trp106 but are likely to include Asp38 and Cys39.

Two molecules of Pdx, in turn, donate electrons to one molecule of P450cam that oxidizes d-camphor to 5-exo-hydroxycamphor using molecular oxygen (1Katagiri M. Ganguli B.N. Gunsalus I.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3543-3546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions of NADH oxidation/Pdx reduction and Pdx oxidation/camphor hydroxylation are highly coupled and proceed with turnover numbers of 16,000 and 2,000 min–1, respectively (2Sevrioukova I.F.

To provide efficient catalytic turnover of P450cam monooxygenase, Pdx must form productive transient or long lived electron transfer complexes with its redox partners.

The lack of structural information on Pdr, however, was the primary reason that the Pdr-Pdx redox couple was the least studied in this system.

Investigation of the Pdr-Pdx interaction is necessary for unraveling the mechanism of the P450cam and other homologous three component monooxygenase systems. The long range interprotein electron transfer is a fundamental process, and, thus, elucidation of specific interactions that assist and stabilize Pdr-Pdx complex and mediate FAD-to-[2Fe-2S] electron transfer is of fundamental importance.Recently determined x-ray structures of oxidized Pdr and oxidized and reduced Pdx have provided a structural base for studying electron transfer and molecular recognition in the Pdr-Pdx redox couple (16Sevrioukova I.F.

In this study, we utilized computer graphics techniques and crystal structures of the proteins to develop three-dimensional models for the Pdr-Pdx complex. To test the validity of the proposed models and to further investigate structure-function relations in Pdx, four residues of the iron-sulfur protein located at the protein-protein interface in the model complexes were mutated, and the redox properties of the Pdx mutants and their ability to accept electrons from Pdr were studied. Agreement between experimental and theoretical results and the similarity between the hypothetical Pdr-Pdx complex and crystallographic complexes of analogous redox pairs suggest that the manner of Pdr-Pdx interaction in the model and solution complexes is most likely to be similar.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The bacterial growth media were obtained from Difco. Glucose, glucose oxidase, catalase, poly-l-lysine, MOPS, and bovine serum albumin were from Sigma.

The 5′-oligonucleotide primers CCCGCCGCCAACGAGGCGGAAATCGGCATGCTG (R66A) and CCCGCCGCCAACGAGGAGGAAATCGGCATGCTG (R66E) together with the 3′-nucleotide primer corresponding to the C terminus of Pdx, and the 3′-nucleotide primers ATCACCGACAATATCGGCGATACCATTGGAGACTGC (Y33A), ATCACCGACAATATCGAAGATACCATTGGAGAC (Y33F), GGCGCTGCCGCCACAAGCACCGACAATATCGTA (D38A), GGCGCTGCCGCCACAATTACCGACAATATCGTA (D38N), GCGAATTCTCAGAATTGCCTATCGGGAACATC (W106F), GCGAATTCTCACGCTTGCCTATCGGGAACATC (W106A), and GCGAATTCTCATTGCCTATCGGGAACATC (Δ106) together with the 5′-nucleotide primer corresponding to the N terminus of Pdx were used in the first PCR amplification. The synthesized 120–150-bp fragments containing the Y33A, Y33F, D38A, D38N, R66A, and R66E mutations served as 3′- or 5′-nucleotide primers for the second PCR. The 330-bp fragments of DNA encoding the Pdx mutants were digested with NdeI and EcoRI, and ligated into unique NdeI/EcoRI sites of the pET vector, and the sequence was confirmed.Protein Expression and Purification—Wild-type and mutants of Pdx were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described elsewhere (16Sevrioukova I.F. Garsia C. Li H. Bhaskar B. Poulos T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 377-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In the final preparations of wild-type, Y33A, Y33F, D38A, D38N, R66A, and R66E Pdx the A412/A278 ratio was 0.49–0.51, whereas in the preparations of the W106A, W106F, and Δ106 mutants the corresponding ratio was 0.64. Protein concentration was measured by Lowry method (19Lowry O.H. Rosenbrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol.

The extinction coefficient of Pdx determined spectrophotometrically for the purest protein fractions was estimated to be 5.9 ± 0.3 mm–1 cm–1 at 455 nm. Expression and purification of the 6-histidine-tagged Pdr was carried out as previously described with ∈454 nm = 10.9 mm–1 cm–1 used for protein concentration calculations (2Sevrioukova I.F.

Stopped flow experiments were carried out on an SX.18MV instrument (Applied Photophysics). Solutions were made anaerobic by multiple evacuating and flushing with pre-purified argon and included an oxygen-scrubbing system consisting of 1 mm glucose, 1 unit/ml glucose oxidase, and 1 unit/ml catalase. Reduction of wild-type and mutants of Pdx by Pdr was followed at 22 °C at 507 nm, an isosbestic point for the two-electron reduced and oxidized flavoprotein, in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. Pdr (30 μm) was reduced with a slight excess of NADH before reacting with Pdx. The kinetic data were analyzed using IgorPro software (WaveMetrics, Inc.)EPR measurements of the dithionite-reduced Pdx were performed on a Brüker EPR spectrometer (Brüker BioSpin GmbH) under the following conditions: microwave power, 1 milliwatt; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; modulation amplitude, 3 G; temperature, 77 K.Electrochemical Measurements—Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out using a BAS 100 watt potentiostat (Bioanalytical Systems, West Lafayette, IN) according to a procedure developed by Avila et al. (20Avila L. Wirtz M. Bunce R.A. Rivera M. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 4: 664-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) with some modifications. A single compartment electrochemical cell (0.4 ml) contained a platinum wire counter electrode, a 3 m Ag/AgCl reference electrode in a Luggin capillary (+205 mV versus SHE), and an indium-doped tin oxide quartz plate (Quantum Coating) as the working electrode. The electrode was cleaned by a 20-min sonication in 10% alconox solution followed by a 20-min sonication in water. The sample solutions contained 80–100 μm Pdx and polylysine in a molar ratio of 1:2 in 100 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.0. For all studied proteins, the observed peak current during voltammetry increased linearly with the square root of the scan rate, indicative of diffusion-controlled electron transfer. Half-wave potentials determined by CV were close to those measured by Osteryoung square wave voltammetry (21Murphy M.M. O'Dea J.J. Osteryoung J. Anal.

The lowest energy docking positions were analyzed to determine preferred binding regions on Pdr and Pdx and to select a plausible model where the distance between the isoalloxazine ring of FAD and the [2Fe-2S] cluster was the shortest.

Nature. 1999; 402: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar). All calculations were performed using default settings. To initiate the pathway analysis, the flavin and iron-sulfur moieties were defined as electron donor and acceptor groups, respectively.The surface area of the interface in the Pdr-Pdx complex was calculated using GRASP (28Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5313) Google Scholar). The figures were prepared with MOLSCRIPT (29Kraulis J.P. J. Appl.

L. (2002) Delano Scientific, San Carlos, CAGoogle Scholar).RESULTSMolecular Properties of Pdr and Pdx—During turnover of P450cam monooxygenase, electron flow is directed from reduced Pdr to oxidized Pdx. Being able to donate two electrons, the reduced flavoprotein molecule must bind and dissociate from two molecules of Pdx during the catalytic cycle. To date, only the crystal structure of oxidized Pdr has been solved (17Sevrioukova I.F. Li H. Poulos T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 889-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Based on analogy with other NAD(P)H-dependent electron transferring flavoenzymes, where binding of reduced pyridine nucleotides and hydride transfer occur on the re-side of the isoalloxazine ring of the flavin and the surface surrounding the opposite, si-side of the flavin cofactor serves as an electron acceptor/redox partner binding site, the hydrophobic groove on the si-side of Pdr formed by the side chains of Pro46, Val302, and Trp328 was proposed to be a docking site for Pdx. These residues are closest to the flavin and have the highest electronic coupling values (Fig. 1, a and c). According to the x-ray structures of oxidized and reduced glutathione reductase (32Karplus P.A. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 701-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 33Karplus P.A. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 163-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) and the NADH-dependent ferredoxin reductase component of biphenyl dioxygenase (34Senda T. Yamada T. Sakurai N. Kubota M. Nashizaki T. Masai T. Fukuda M. Mitsui Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 397-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), structural homologues of Pdr, residues shielding the si-side of the flavin do not undergo conformational changes during redox transition. This suggests that the surface properties of the oxidized and reduced molecules of Pdr are likely to be similar. The structure of oxidized Pdr, therefore, can be used as a model of the reduced flavoprotein.The structural data on the [2Fe-2S] ferredoxins suggest that the iron atom located closer to the molecular surface accepts and donates electrons during redox cycling (35Dugad L.B. La Mar G.N. Banci L. Bertini I. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2263-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In Pdx, amino acid residues comprising the solvent accessible Asp38–Thr47 metal cluster binding loop have the highest electronic coupling values and are most likely to be involved in interprotein electron transfer (Fig. 1, c and d). Taken together, analysis of the surface properties of Pdr and Pdx gives a clear indication on what parts of the molecules might interact in solution.Models of the Pdr-Pdx Complex—To identify contact regions and generate the starting model for the Pdr-Pdx electron transfer complex, the x-ray structures of the proteins (PDB codes 1Q1R and 1XLP, Refs. 17Sevrioukova I.F. Li H. Poulos T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 889-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar and 18Sevrioukova I.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 347: 607-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) were used as input to the program GRAMM (22Vakser I.A. Aflalo C. Proteins. 1994; 20: 320-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The resulting docking positions between Pdr and Pdx were analyzed to select models where the distance between the isoalloxazine ring of FAD and the [2Fe-2S] cluster were less than 15–20 Å, which many consider to be the maximum possible distance for electron transfer to occur at physiologically relevant rates (27Page C.C. Moser C.C. Chen X. Dutton P.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar). Among the lowest energy docking positions there was a complex, designated as Model 1, where the edge-to-edge distance between the flavin and iron-sulfur cofactors was ∼15 Å (Fig. 2, a–c). In this model, the 1,378-Å2 protein-protein interface includes 2 salt bridges, 4 hydrogen bonds, and multiple van der Waals contacts (Table I). The aromatic ring of the C-terminal Trp106 of Pdx is positioned at the center of the groove close to Trp330 of Pdr, whereas Tyr- and Arg66 flank the protein-protein interface (Fig. 2b). The best route for electron flow from FAD to [2Fe-2S] is predicted to pass through Lys50 and Ala51 of Pdr and Asp38 and Cys39 of Pdx (Fig. 2c and Table II). For this particular pathway, the direct distance analysis predicts a maximum electron transfer rate of 6.3 × 102 s–1, an average atomic packing density of 0.55, and a corresponding β-decay factor of 1.76 Å–1.Fig. 2Computer-generated models of the complex between Pdr (pink) and Pdx (light blue).a–c, model with the highest surface structure complementarity predicted by GRAMM (22Vakser I.A.

Open table in a new tab Notably, bulky Tyr33 and Arg66 of Pdx form van der Waals contacts with Thr66–Arg65 and a salt bridge with Glu335 of Pdr, respectively, at the edge of the complex interface. In the model complex, Pdx can reorient without disrupting these interactions and change the angle and the distance between the [2Fe-2S] cluster and FAD by making seesaw-like movements. One of these possible orientations of Pdx with the edge-to-edge distance between the flavin and iron-sulfur cofactors of 12.3 Å is shown in Fig. 2, d–f. Specific Pdr-Pdx interactions formed in this hypothetical complex, designated as Model 2, are listed in Table I. Trp106 of Pdx shifts toward the side of the interface and its carboxyl group is in position to form a salt bridge with Arg310 of Pdr. The best electron transfer route from FAD to the [2Fe-2S] cluster is predicted to proceed through Trp330 of Pdr and Asp38 and Cys39 of Pdx with the estimated maximum electron transfer rate being two orders of magnitude higher than that predicted for Model 1 (Table II). The optimal orientation for the Pdr-Pdx docking, therefore, is not optimal for electron transfer.Rationale for the Mutation of Specific Amino Acids of Pdx—In order to test whether the model Pdr-Pdx complexes resemble that formed in solution, four residues of Pdx were selected for mutation. Tryptophan 106 was chosen because it has substantial conformational freedom in Pdx (16Sevrioukova I.F. Garsia C. Li H. Bhaskar B. Poulos T.L. J. Mol.

The possible functional implication based on the structure are discussed. Inorganic phosphate (Pi) uptake is of fundamental importance in the cell physiology of bacteria because Pi is required as a nutrient. Escherichia coli has developed a Pi acquisition system that allows the assimilation of Pi via a variety of systems. Two distinct systems for the uptake of Pi have been described: the low affinity phosphate inorganic transporter and the high affinity phosphate-specific transporter (PstSCAB) (1Rosenberg H. Gerdes R.G. Chegwidden K. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 131: 505-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Willsky G.R. Malamy M.H. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 144: 356-365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When the preferred Pi source is in excess, it is taken up by the phosphate inorganic transporter. When the extracellular Pi concentration is less than ∼4 μm, the synthesis of the high affinity transporter is induced, and Pi is taken up by PstSCAB. The PstSCAB transporter belongs to the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette transporters and is encoded by the pst operon (3Surin B.P. Rosenberg H. Cox G.B. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 189-198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Rao N.N. Torriani A. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1083-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This operon contains five genes that are transcribed counterclockwise in the following order: pstS, pstC, pstA, pstB, and phoU. PstS is a periplasmic Pi-binding protein, and PstC and PstA are integral membrane proteins that mediate the translocation of Pi through the inner membrane. PstB is an ATPase that energizes the transport. The Pst operon is part of the phosphate (PHO) 1The abbreviations used are: PHO, phosphate; Se-Met, seleno-l-methionine; BME, β-mercaptoethanol; ICP-MS, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; r.m.s., root mean square. 1The abbreviations used are: PHO, phosphate; Se-Met, seleno-l-methionine; BME, β-mercaptoethanol; ICP-MS, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; r.m.s., root mean square. regulon that consists of 31 genes arranged in eight different operons in E. coli (5Wanner B.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 51: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 6Wanner B.L. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss R. II I Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.F. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 1357-1381Google Scholar). The genes and operons of the PHO regulon are co-regulated by a two-component system composed of the regulatory proteins PhoB and PhoR. When the concentration of Pi in the medium falls below ∼4 μm, the sensor protein PhoR phosphorylates PhoB, and the phosphorylated PhoB binds to the PHO boxes in the control region of Pst, recruiting the σ70 subunit of the RNA polymerase and initiating transcription. When the Pi concentration in the medium is in excess, the PHO regulon is repressed. Repression of the PHO regulon requires not only an excess concentration of extracellular Pi but also the intact PstSCAB transporter and the PhoU protein. The PhoU gene encodes a polypeptide of molecular mass ∼27,000 Da. Although it is located in the pst operon, the encoded PhoU protein does not seem to participate in Pi transport (4Rao N.N. Torriani A. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1083-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Besides its role as a repressor of the PHO regulon, PhoU was also reported to be involved in intracellular Pi metabolism (presumably related to the synthesis of ATP) (7Steed P.M. Wanner B.L. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6797-6809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Currently, there is a total of 44 entries of annotated PhoU protein homology sequences in the Protein Information Resource data base (www.pir.georgetown.edu). Only the E. coli PhoU protein was reported to be purified as a protein aggregate, and no structures for this protein family are available (8Surin B.P. Dixon N.E. Rosenberg H. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 631-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two PhoU homologues have been identified in Thermotoga maritima, and they are Tm1260 and Tm1734 (www.tigr.org). The Tm1260 gene is located in a gene cluster similar to the PhoU gene in E. coli, and Tm1734 is located in a gene cluster containing several hypothetical genes. The detailed molecular function for both PhoU homologues in T. maritima is unknown. However, these two PhoU homologues are highly sequence-related (25% identity and 54% homology). As part of the Berkeley Structural Genomics Project (www.strgen.org), we purified and solved the crystal structure of one of the two PhoU homologues (Tm1734) from T. maritima (Tm_PhoU2) at 2.0 Å resolution. This structure reveals a new class of metalloproteins containing multinuclear iron clusters. Cloning, Protein Expression, and Purification—The Tm_PhoU2 (gi number 4982311) gene was amplified by PCR using T. maritima genomic DNA template and primers designed for ligation-independent cloning (9Aslanidis C. de Jong P.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 20: 6069-6074Crossref Scopus (928) Google Scholar). The amplified PCR product was prepared for vector insertion by purification, quantitation, and treatment with T4 DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) in the presence of 1 mm dTTP. The prepared insert was annealed into the ligation-independent cloning expression vector pB3, a derivative of pET21a (Novagen, Madison, WI) that expresses the cloned gene with an N-terminal His6-tagged tobacco etch virus cleavage sequence, and transformed into chemical competent DH5α to obtain fusion clones. The seleno-l-methionine (Se-Met) isoform of Tm_PhoU2 protein was expressed in E. coli B834 (DE3). Cell paste was prepared with Studier's autoinduction method. 2Dr. William Studier, Brookhaven National Laboratory, personal communication. For protein purification, cell paste was resuspended in buffer A containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, supplemented with Roche protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Cells were opened with a Microfluidizer (Microfluidics, Newton, MA). After centrifugation, the cleared cell lysate was loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap MC column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was first washed with 10 column volumes of buffer A with 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol (BME) followed by 10 column volumes of buffer B containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, and 10 mm BME. The target protein was eluted with buffer C containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm BME using an imidazole gradient from 40 to 300 mm in 20 column volumes. Target protein was eluted at ∼200 mm imidazole concentration. The peak fractions were pooled together and diluted 10-fold with buffer A. The diluted protein solution was then loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrapQ anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences), and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient from 0 to 0.5 m NaCl in 20 column volumes. Protein came off at ∼200 mm NaCl concentration. The peak fractions were then concentrated to 10 mg/ml in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm BME for crystallization. Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS)—Purified Tm_PhoU2 protein sample was sent for ICP-MS experiments for trace metal analysis. The ICP-MS experiment was conducted at the University of Georgia (www.cal.uga.edu) using a Thermo Jarrell-Ash Enviro 36 inductively coupled argon plasm. Prior to analysis, the purified protein was placed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol. The control buffer contained no protein but 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol. The ICP-MS results showed that the iron and nickel concentration in Tm_PhoU2 protein is 7.1- and 11.3-fold higher than in the control buffer, respectively. Crystallization and Structure Determination—Screening for crystallization conditions was done by the sparse matrix screening method (10Jancarik J. Kim S.H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 409-411Crossref Scopus (2077) Google Scholar). Optimum conditions were obtained by mixing 1 μl of protein solution (10 mg/ml in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm BME) with 1 μl of reservoir solution (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mm CaCl2, and 25% polyethylene glycol 400) and equilibrating over 1 ml of reservoir solution. Large crystals were obtained within 2–3 days at room temperature. For data collection, crystals of Tm_PhoU2 were transferred to the reservoir solution containing protein buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm BME) plus 10% glycerol before they were directly frozen in liquid nitrogen. The multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion data for Tm_PhoU2 Se-Met crystals were collected at Advanced Light Source Beamline 5.0.2 (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA) at 100 K with a Quantum 315 charge-coupled device detector and processed with HKL 2000 (11Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38440) Google Scholar). The crystals belong to the space group P3121 or P3221 with approximate unit cell dimensions of a = b = 90.677 Å, c = 45.255 Å. The crystals contain one monomer/asymmetric unit corresponding to a solvent content of 44.7%. Data statistics are summarized in Table I.

D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16947) Google Scholar). The resultant electron density map was readily interpretable. The initial model was built with program O (14Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar). The initial model building confirmed that the 14 sites found by HySS include 11 ordered selenium sites and three strong metal sites. Further experiments revealed that the three metal sites belong to two multinuclear iron clusters. Model refinement was carried out with the REFMAC5 program (15Collaborative Computational Project No 4. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19729) Google Scholar). The TLS method was utilized for structural refinement. At the final stage of refinement, iron clusters were built into the structural model, and water molecules were added. The final model of the Tm_PhoU2 protein was refined to Rfree = 25.5% and R-factor = 21.7% at 2.0 Å resolution and contained residues 2–226, seven iron ions, one nickel ion, one calcium ion, two acetate ions, and 78 water molecules. The final refinement statistics are given in Table I. The crystal structure of Tm_PhoU2 was determined by multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion using Se-Met protein. The protein crystallized in space group P3121 and contained one monomer in the asymmetric unit. The final model of the Tm_PhoU2 protein was refined to Rfree = 25.5% and R-factor = 21.7% at 2.0 Å resolution and contained residues 2–226, seven iron ions, one nickel ion, one calcium ion, two acetate ions, and 78 water molecules. The N-terminal methionine and nine C-terminal residues were not included in this model because of poor electron density. PROCHECK was used to assess the stereochemistry of this model (16Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). It shows 95.7% of the residues in the most favored regions of the ϕ-ψ plot, and no outliers were present. The r.m.s. deviations of bond lengths and bond angles from the standard geometry were 0.012Å and 1.17°, respectively (Table I). Overall Structure—The Tm_PhoU2 monomer is mainly an α-helical structure with 81.7% of the amino acids in α-helical conformations, 19.6% of the amino acids in turns, and 3.65% of the amino acids in β-strand conformations (Fig. 1A). The overall structure of Tm_PhoU2 is composed of a six-helix bundle and a short two-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet attached at the C terminus. The six-helix bundle is composed of two three-helix bundles connected by a 10-residue loop. The N-terminal three-helix bundle is composed of H1A, H2A, and H3A, and the C-terminal three-helix bundle is composed of H1B, H2B, and H3B. The interface between these two three-helix bundles is mediated through H1A-H1B and H3A-H3B and contains mainly hydrophobic residues. The two three-helix bundles are structural repeats. The superposition of the two structural repeats of the three-helix bundle results in an r.m.s. deviation of 1.45 Å over 79 equivalent Cα atoms (Fig. 1B). The major difference between these two repeats is that H1A is 12 amino acids longer than H1B. The other two α-helices in the structural repeats can be well superimposed. The superposition of these two repeats also revealed that the protein sequences in these two repeats are related. In fact, the two iron clusters identified in this structure are found at the equivalent positions of these two structural repeats and coordinated by the same E(D)XXXD motif repeats (discussed below). Tm_PhoU2 Structure Represents a New Structural Fold— The DALI program was used for a structural homology search (17Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3556) Google Scholar). No match was found for the complete model of the Tm_PhoU2 protein. A search with the whole model led to structural homologues to the first or second repeat. Not surprisingly, a search with the two structural repeats of the three-helix bundle led to many similar structural homologues. The structures with the highest Z-scores are the STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) protein fragment (Protein Database accession number 1UUR, Z-score 11.0, r.m.s. deviation 2.8 Å over 103 Cα atoms with 7% sequence identity), the α-spectrin fragment mutant (Protein Database accession code 1CUN, Z-score 10.8, r.m.s. deviation 2.2 Å over 105 Cα atoms with 10% sequence identity), and the heat shock cognate 71-kDa fragment (hsc70) bag-family (Protein Database accession code 1HX1, Z-score 10.7, r.m.s. deviation 2.2 Å over 97 Cα atoms with 11% sequence identity). These proteins have very different sequences and molecular functions. They do not appear to be remotely related to the PhoU protein family. To the best of our knowledge, the structural fold composed of two repeats of a three-helix bundle for Tm_PhoU2 is unique and represents a novel structural fold in the protein data bank. Two Multinuclear Metal Clusters—Metal binding of the Tm_PhoU2 protein was first suggested by the Se-Met phased |Fobs – Fcalc| difference density map and subsequently verified by ICP-MS results (see the “Experimental Procedures”). ICP-MS results showed that Tm_PhoU2 protein contains significant amounts of iron and nickel ions. Two diffraction data sets were collected subsequently at the iron peak wavelength (1.7433 Å) and the nickel peak wavelength (1.4879 Å) with the Se-Met crystals (Table I). Calculating the anomalous difference Fourier maps revealed two multinuclear metal clusters bound to the protein surface: a tetranuclear iron cluster, which contains three iron ions and one nickel ion bound to the N-terminal structural repeat, and a trinuclear iron cluster containing three iron ions bound to the C-terminal structural repeat (Fig. 1A). Both clusters are bound on the same side of the protein surface defined by highly acidic surface patches (Fig. 1C). Superposition of the N- and C-terminal structural repeats bound with multinuclear metal clusters revealed that the two iron clusters are bound at the same position of the two structural repeats (Fig. 1B). Because no iron ions were included in the purification and crystallization steps, these metal clusters had to be obtained during cell growth. The assignment of iron or nickel in these two metal clusters was based on the anomalous difference Fourier maps calculated using 2.5 Å resolution data collected at 1.7433 Å (iron peak wavelength) and 1.4879 Å (nickel peak wavelength) (Fig. 2, A and B). Iron is a strong anomalous scatterer at both wavelengths (f″ ∼3.99 at 1.7433 Å and ∼2.99 at 1. 4879 Å). The contribution of nickel is weak at 1.7433 Å (f″ ∼0.64) but strong for the wavelength of 1.4879 Å (f″ ∼3.92). The identification of nickel ion at the N-terminal iron cluster is based on the stronger anomalous difference peak at 1.4879 Å rather than that at 1.7433 Å, when both maps are contoured at the same level (Fig. 2B). Trinuclear Iron Cluster—The trinuclear iron cluster is bound on the protein surface of the C-terminal repeat, coordinated by residues from H2B and H3B (Figs. 1C and 2C). All three iron ions (Fe-6, -5, and -7) in this cluster are well ordered and form a nearly isosceles triangle with a distance between Fe-5 and -6, Fe-5 and -7, and Fe-6 and -7 of 3.82 Å, 3.69 Å, and 6.68 Å, respectively. In the trinuclear cluster, Fe-5 can be described as a core ion and is partially buried inside the protein surface between H3B and H2B, coordinated by the terminal carboxylates of four conserved acidic residues: Asp152 and Asp156 from H2B and Glu191 and Asp195 from H3B. Fe-6 and -7 can be described as adjacent ions with Fe-6 bound on top of H3B, coordinated to Glu191 and Asp195, and Fe-7 bound on top of H2B, coordinated to Asp152 and Asp156. Toward the solvent region, the trinuclear iron cluster is internally capped by a modeled acetate ion with two oxygens coordinated by all three iron ions. The acetate ion was tentatively modeled based on the |Fobs – Fcalc| difference density map and the geometry of the trinuclear iron cluster. Although this difference density was modeled as an acetate ion, no acetate ion was used during purification and crystallization steps, and we are not sure about the actual identity of this difference density. A similar example for this modeling is the crystal structure of a ribonucleotide reductase R2 protein complexed with an oxo-centered trinuclear iron cluster, in which an acetate ion was found to coordinate two of the irons in the oxo-centered trinuclear iron cluster (18Hogbom M. Nordlund P. FEBS Lett. 2004; 567: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Besides the modeled acetate group and protein residues, seven water molecules were also found to be involved in the coordination of the trinuclear iron cluster, with one water binding to Fe-5 and three waters each binding to Fe-6 and -7. The overall chemical environment around the trinuclear iron cluster is nearly symmetric. Fe-5 has a pentagonal bipyramidal coordination to seven oxygens. There are five equatorial oxygens: one from a well ordered internal water, two from the acetate oxygens, and two from the carboxyl oxygens of Asp152 and Glu191. The two axial oxygens for Fe-5 are from the carboxylates of Asp156 and Asp195. Among the five equatorial oxygens, four (except the internal water) are bridging oxygens between core iron Fe-5 and the two adjacent ions Fe-6 and -7. Fe-6 also has a pentagonal bipyramidal coordination to seven oxygens, in which the five equatorial oxygens are two water molecules, two bridging oxygens to Fe-5 (one from the acetate oxygen, another from the carboxyl oxygen of Glu191), and another carboxyl oxygen from Glu191. The two axial oxygens are one water molecule and one carboxyl oxygen of Asp195. Fe-7 has a slightly distorted octahedral coordination to six oxygens, which are three water molecules, two bridging oxygens to Fe-5 (one from acetate oxygen, and another from the carboxyl oxygen of Asp152), and one carboxyl oxygen from Asp156. Unlike Glu191, where both carboxyl oxygens are coordinated to Fe-6, Asp152 has only one carboxyl oxygen coordinating to Fe-7. The other carboxyl oxygen of Asp152 forms a hydrogen bond with the internal water that coordinates Fe-5, possibly stabilizing the internal water. Tretranuclear Metal Cluster—The tetranuclear iron cluster is bound on the protein surface of the N-terminal repeat coordinated by residues from H2A and H3A (Figs. 1C and 2D). The tetranuclear cluster includes four metal ions: nickel, Fe-2, -3, and -4, in which nickel and Fe-2 and -3 form a similar triangle as the Fe-6 –5-7 trinuclear cluster. Here, Fe-2 represents the core ion, whereas nickel and Fe-3 represent the adjacent ions similar to Fe-7 and -6, respectively. An acetate ion was also modeled into a similar position as that of the C-terminal cluster. This acetate ion is less well defined, indicated by its high B factors (average ∼70 Å–2). Again, we are not sure about the actual identity of the difference density, which we modeled as an acetate ion. The nickel ion has a higher B factor compared with other iron ions (68 versus 30–47 Å–2 for iron ions), indicating that this metal ion is more mobile than other iron ions. Furthermore, it is possible that the nickel ion in this structure could be a result of an ion exchange between nickel and iron during protein purification because a nickel affinity column was used for purification. The coordination for this tetranuclear iron cluster involves seven water molecules and eight protein residues including Glu49, Glu50, Asp53, and Glu56 from H2A and Glu88, Glu91, Asn92, and Asp95 from H3A. Fe-2 is partially buried inside the protein surface and is coordinated by four conserved residues: Glu49 and Asp53 from H2A and Glu91 and Asp95 from H3A (Figs. 1C and 2D). Overall, Fe-2 has an octahedral coordination to six oxygens: one from an internal water molecule, one from the acetate oxygen, and four from the carboxyl oxygens of Glu49, Asp53, Glu91, and Asp95. Here, Glu49 and Glu91 provide the bridging oxygens. Fe-3 has a distorted pentagonal bipyramidal coordination to seven oxygens: two from water molecules, one from the acetate oxygen, and four others from the terminal oxygens of Glu91, Asp95, and Asn92. Nickel has coordination to six oxygens: two from water molecules, two from carboxylates of Glu49, and two others from carboxylates of Asp53 and Glu50. Because the nickel has a higher B factor, this coordination of the nickel ion shown is tentative. The extended iron ion, Fe-4, is coordinated by both H2A and H3A. Fe-4 has a slightly distorted octahedral coordination to six oxygens, three of which are from water molecules and three others from the carboxyl oxygens of Glu56, Glu88, and Glu91. Here, one water molecule and another carboxyl oxygen of Glu91 act as bridging oxygens between Fe-3 and -4. E(D)XXXD Motif—A conserved motif was identified in the PhoU family by identifying the protein residues that coordinate the N- and C-terminal iron clusters in the Tm_PhoU2 structure. A total of four repeats of the E(D)XXXD motif can be identified in the PhoU family (Fig. 3). For the first N-terminal repeat, this motif can be extended to EXXXDXXE(D). For the second and the fourth repeat, the motif is restricted to EXXXD, and for the third repeat, the motif is restricted to DXXXD. The four motif repeats can be grouped into two motif pairs. The two N-terminal motif repeats form the N-terminal motif pair and constitute the N-terminal tetranuclear iron cluster binding site, whereas the two C-terminal motif repeats form the C-terminal motif pair and constitute the C-terminal trinuclear iron cluster binding site. Both sites are located at the equivalent position of the two structural repeats, and conserved carboxyl residues from each motif pair form a highly acidic surface patch. In the coordination between each of the two E(D)XXXD motif pairs and their bound multinuclear iron cluster, all four conserved carboxyl residues in each motif pair are involved in coordination to the core iron ion. The two N-terminal conserved residues (Glu or Asp) provide the bridging oxygens and symmetrically bind to the core iron, whereas the two conserved C-terminal residues (Asp) provide each of its carboxyl oxygens coordinating the core iron ion and an adjacent iron. Dimeric Structure—It is not clear whether the Tm_PhoU2 protein functions as a monomer or as an oligomer. Gel-filtration chromatography indicates a protein size between a dimer and a monomer (∼40 kDa). In the crystal, two Tm_PhoU2 monomers form a dimer through the crystallographic dyad, resulting in a 12-helix bundle (Fig. 4A). The four helices bound with clusters in one monomer (H2A, H3A, H2B, and H3B) are parallel with their counterparts in another monomer and form the dimer interface. There are a total of 64 interactions between the two monomers, including 30 hydrophobic interactions. A total of 5995 Å2 surface area is buried between these two monomers, corresponding to 46% of the overall surface of the monomer. A crystal structure of the apo-PhoU protein from Aquifex aeolicus, recently solved in our laboratory in two different crystal forms, also shows a very similar dimer interface. 3V. Oganesyan, N. Oganesyan, P. D. Adams, J. Jancarik, H. A. Yokota, R. Kim, and S.-H. Kim, unpublished results. The striking feature about the Tm_PhoU2 dimer is that a central pore is observed at the dimer interface (Fig. 4B). At both ends of this pore, a tetranuclear iron cluster from one monomer and a trinuclear iron cluster from another monomer are close to each other and bind to the open acidic protein surface formed by conserved residues that may be functionally important. The crystal structure of the Tm_PhoU2 protein revealed unexpected results. The Se-Met phased |Fobs – Fcalc | difference density map indicates that Tm_PhoU2 binds two metal clusters on the protein surface. The metal content was subsequently confirmed by the ICP-MS results and the anomalous difference density. The octahedral or pentagonal bipyramidal coordination for each individual iron ion in the two clusters is consistent with previously defined coordination geometry for the iron ion (18Hogbom M. Nordlund P. FEBS Lett. 2004; 567: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 19Zhu H. Alexeev D. Hunter D.J. Campopiano D.J. Sadler P.J. Biochem.

Biol. 2003; 10: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The fact that a multinuclear iron cluster is coordinated by an EXXXD motif pair has never been described previously. However, an oxo-centered trinuclear iron cluster coordinated by protein-derived carboxylates has been structurally characterized in the ribonucleotide reductase R2 protein, although these carboxyl residues are not conserved (18Hogbom M. Nordlund P. FEBS Lett. 2004; 567: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In ferritins, the formation of an iron core is crucial for iron storage, detoxification, and mobilization throughout all three kingdoms. All ferritins contain several conserved carboxylate residues that are clustered in a patch on the inside surface of the ferritin sphere. Mutation studies have been performed on some of these residues and resulted in diminished core formation. The carboxylates are thus believed to make up nucleation sites for the mineral core (21Chasteen N.D. Harrison P.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 126: 182-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 22Lawson D.M. Artymiuk P.J. Yewdall S.J. Smith J.M.A. Livingstone J.C. Treffry A. Luzzago A. Levi S. Arosio P. Cesareni G.

Although we cannot completely rule out the possibility that the iron ion could be another metal, the evidence presented here strongly supports that the two multinuclear metal clusters in Tm_PhoU2 protein are multinuclear iron clusters. The nickel ion is likely to be the result of an ion exchange between iron and nickel during protein purification. So far, structures reported for a trinuclear iron cluster or multinuclear iron cluster-binding proteins are only for proteins involved in iron transport and iron metabolism. This includes ferric ion-binding protein, a protein involved in iron uptake from the transferrin superfamily, which binds trinuclear oxo-iron clusters in an open cleft with a conserved dityrosyl iron-binding motif (19Zhu H. Alexeev D. Hunter D.J. Campopiano D.J. Sadler P.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 35-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Alexeev D. Zhu H. Guo M. Zhong W. Hunter D.J. Yang W. Campopiano D.J. Sadler P.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and the DpsA protein (Dps, DNA-protecting protein during starvation), a Dps-like ferritin family protein, which binds to iron clusters in a manner similar to that found in diiron-carboxyl oxygen-activating proteins (26Zeth K. Offermann S. Essen L.O. Oesterhelt D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 101: 13780-13785Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The Tm_PhoU2 structure defines a new class of metalloproteins that bind multinuclear iron clusters by its conserved E(D)XXXD motif pair in a manner not observed previously. An intriguing feature about the Tm_PhoU2 structure is the highly symmetric nature in the protein sequence motifs, the structural fold, and the coordination between the protein and the multinuclear iron clusters. Such a symmetric coordination environment is only observed in small organic structures and is rarely found in protein structures. The Tm_PhoU2 structure bound by two multinuclear iron clusters gives the first example of how a protein uses its structural fold and conserved motifs to create a nearly symmetric coordination environment for multinuclear iron clusters. The biological function of these carboxylate-coordinated multinuclear iron clusters bound to the Tm_PhoU2 protein is unknown. However, the structure of the Tm_PhoU2 protein suggests that the iron cluster binding for PhoU protein is likely to be conserved and functionally related. We speculate that the PhoU protein might use its conserved E(D)XXXD motif pair to recruit iron clusters, which may in turn act as a cofactor involved in unknown PhoU protein-related functions, such as Pi metabolism (7Steed P.M.

Lyme disease is a serious disease of the skin, joints, nervous system, and heart caused by the spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi (1Barbour A.G. Fish D. Science. 1993; 260: 1610-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). In the Eastern United States, the disease is transmitted to humans by the bite of the deer tick, Ixodes scapularis. Related spirochetes also cause Lyme disease, including Borrelia garinii and Borrelia afzelii in Europe and in Asia.Outer surface proteins A and B (Osp 1The abbreviations used are: Osp, outer surface protein; CT, C terminus; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PEG, polyethylene glycol; PEG550MME, polyethylene glycol 550 monomethyl ether; r.m.s., root mean square; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; PDB, Protein Data Bank; Bicine, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine. 1The abbreviations used are: Osp, outer surface protein; CT, C terminus; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PEG, polyethylene glycol; PEG550MME, polyethylene glycol 550 monomethyl ether; r.m.s., root mean square; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; PDB, Protein Data Bank; Bicine, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine.A and OspB) are basic lipoproteins encoded by a single operon located on a 54-kb linear plasmid of the B. burgdorferi genome (2Howe T.R.

OspB (31 kDa, apparent size 34 kDa by SDS-PAGE) has 53% sequence identity to OspA (28 kDa, apparent size 31 kDa by SDS-PAGE). The N termini of both proteins are lipidated following signal peptide cleavage (4Brandt M.E. Riley B.S. Radolf J.D. Norgard M.V. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 983-991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of a recombinant, nonlipidated OspA has been determined in complexes with antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) of two different murine monoclonal antibodies (5Li H. Lawson C.L. J. Struct.

Both OspA and OspB are expressed by B. burgdorferi in infected unfed ticks, but are down-regulated during tick feeding (8Schwan T.G. Piesman J. Golde W.T. Dolan M.C. Rosa P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Immun. 1999; 67: 173-181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Within each Borrelia species, OspA is largely invariant in amino acid sequence and antigenic reactivity, but OspB varies significantly (13Barbour A.G.

Primary isolates of B. burgdorferi vary widely in reactivity of full-length OspB with specific anti-OspB monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (13Barbour A.G. Tessier S.L. Hayes S.F. Infect. Immun. 1984; 45: 94-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), and C-terminally truncated forms of OspB (apparent molecular mass, 18–21.5 kDa) are common (22Fikrig E. Tao H. Kantor F.S.

Antibody-mediated bacterial lysis normally involves recruitment of the complement cascade through the constant (Fc) portion of multiple antibody molecules bound to the bacterial surface (28Taylor P.W. Exp. Clin. Immunogenet. 1992; 9: 48-56PubMed Google Scholar). However, antibodies directed against OspA or OspB do not always require complement to kill B. burgdorferi (29Ma J. Gingrich-Baker C. Franchi P.M. Bulger P. Coughlin R.T. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 2221-2227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, two independently characterized protective IgG class mAbs directed to the OspB C terminus, H6831 and CB2, have been shown to kill spirochetes in the absence of phagocytes and without complement (30Sadziene A. Jonsson M. Bergstrom S. Bright R.K. Kennedy R.C. Barbour A.G. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 2037-2045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Escudero R. Halluska M.L. Backenson P.B. Coleman J.L. Benach J.L.

For these mAbs, monovalent antigen binding fragments (Fabs) produced by proteolytic cleavage of whole IgG will also cause lysis (30Sadziene A. Jonsson M. Bergstrom S. Bright R.K. Kennedy R.C. Barbour A.G. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 2037-2045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Escudero R. Halluska M.L. Backenson P.B. Coleman J.L. Benach J.L. Infect.

This unusual phenomenon has also been observed for mAbs against several other spirochete surface proteins (29Ma J. Gingrich-Baker C. Franchi P.M. Bulger P. Coughlin R.T. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 2221-2227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Sadziene A. Jonsson M. Bergstrom S. Bright R.K. Kennedy R.C. Barbour A.G. Infect.

Immunol. 2004; 172: 1191-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).The mechanism of complement-independent killing by these antibodies is not known. To examine whether bactericidal action could involve distinctive features of the antibody or defined structural changes in the target antigen, we set out to investigate the structure of OspB in the presence and absence of a bactericidal Fab. Because full-length recombinant, unlipidated OspB (B. burgdorferi strain B31) is vulnerable to proteolytic degradation, 2B. D. Lade and J. J. Dunn, unpublished results. 2B. D. Lade and J. J. Dunn, unpublished results. we generated a 16.5-kDa C-terminal domain fragment containing the bactericidal Fab-binding epitope (OspB-CT), beginning approximately in the predicted center of the central β-sheet domain (residues 152–296). Crystals of OspB-CT alone and in complex with H6831 Fab were obtained, and their structures were determined. In the H6831-bound structure, four β-strands corresponding to the central β-sheet are either disordered or removed by proteolysis, and additional minor conformational changes are observed. The structural changes appear to result only indirectly from addition of Fab. We discuss the implications of the structural results on OspB fold, stability, and the unusual bactericidal effect.MATERIALS AND METHODSGene Construction, Expression, Purification, and Sequencing—A gene construct encoding the C-terminal fragment of OspB was produced by PCR amplification of B. burgdorferi DNA using the following two primers: 5′-CCGGGATCCATATGGCTAATAAATTAGACTCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCGATATCGGATCCTTATTTTAAGGCGTTTTTAAGC-3′ (reverse).Regions that overlap the ospB gene sequence beginning at amino acid residue 152 and ending at the TAA stop codon after residue 296 are underlined. These primers incorporate NdeI and BamHI restriction sites (bold), permitting cloning into the corresponding sites of the T7-based pET9c expression vector (68Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5987) Google Scholar). This construction was cloned into Escherichia coli DH5α. DNA sequencing revealed that no unwanted mutations were introduced during amplification and cloning. The construct was then transferred to E. coli BL21(DE3)/pLysS for T7-RNA polymerase-based protein expression. Cells (500 ml) were grown to mid-logarithmic phase at 310 K in M9TBYG medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin, then were induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and cultured for an additional 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (15,000 × g at 277 K for 10 min) and then suspended in 25 ml of 20 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm sodium chloride, pH 7.7 (buffer A). After addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to 0.5 mm, leupeptin to 0.4 mm and bacitracin to 0.1 μg/ml, the cells were lysed with three cycles of freezing and thawing. DNase (5 μg/ml of lysate) and magnesium chloride (2.5 mm) were added. The lysate was allowed to remain on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 20 min at 277 K. The supernatant was passed through a 5-ml Econo-Pac® High Q cartridge (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with buffer A. OspB-CT was recovered in the flow-through and then dialyzed overnight against 500 ml of 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0 (buffer B) containing 5 mm sodium chloride at 277 K. The dialyzed sample was clarified by brief centrifugation and then applied to a 5-ml Econo-Pac® High S cartridge equilibrated with buffer B. OspB-CT was eluted with application of a gradient of sodium chloride from 0–100 mm. Peak fractions eluting at 60 mm sodium chloride were pooled and concentrated by pressure filtration using a 10-kDa membrane (Amicon) to ∼15 mg/ml. The final yield was ∼75 mg.H6831 was purified from the hybridoma supernatant, and Fabs were produced using commercial kits (Pierce) as described (30Sadziene A. Jonsson M. Bergstrom S. Bright R.K. Kennedy R.C. Barbour A.G. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 2037-2045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and stored at 253 K. The OspB-CT·H6831 complex was formed by incubating freshly prepared OspB-CT with H6831 Fab for about 1 h at 277 K, with OspB-CT in a slight molar excess. The mixture was concentrated in a 20-kDa cutoff Centricon unit (Amicon). This procedure also removed excess OspB-CT. The final concentration was ∼6 mg/ml.Amino acid sequences for the complete light chain and the heavy chain variable domain of mAb H6831 (murine IgG2A, kappa) were determined by using reverse transcriptase to produce cDNAs, followed by PCR to amplify the cDNAs. The amplified cDNAs were then cloned, and the inserts were sequenced using custom primers. The constant region IgG2A heavy chain sequence was taken from Kabat entry 013570.Crystallization and X-ray Diffraction—Crystallization was by the hanging-drop vapor-phase diffusion method, using Linbro plates. Initial screens were performed with Hampton Research crystallization kits Crystal Screen I and II at 277 and 295 K. Systematic variation of initial screen recipes yielded the three crystal forms reported here. pH values were determined after mixing of the crystallization solutions, prior to mixing with protein. PEG550MME was obtained from Fluka; PEG 3350 was from J. T. Baker; propionamide was from Aldrich. Cryocooling was not attempted, as the OspB-CT crystal form proved very stable in the beam and as crystals of the complex were rare and took a long time to grow.The OspB-CT crystal form was obtained by mixing 4 μl of freshly purified protein with 4 μl of 25% PEG550MME, 0.1 m Bicine, 0.1 m sodium bromide, 0.03 m sodium citrate, pH 9.5, and equilibrating at 295 K against 1 ml of the same crystallization solution. Long needles reached sizes of up to 1.2 mm × 0.4 mm × 0.1 mm in about 2 weeks. X-ray diffraction data were collected from a single crystal mounted in a 0.7-mm diameter glass capillary and cooled to 283 K at beamline X12-B of the NSLS. Diffraction was observed to at least 1.6-Å resolution, and complete data were collected to a 2.0-Å resolution limit (Table I).Table ICrystal data and x-ray diffraction statisticsCrystal formOspB-CTOspB-CT+H6831 FabSpace groupC2221C2Unit cell dimensionsa = 30.8 Åa = 186.3 Åb = 51.7 Åb = 37.3 Åc = 158.8 Åc = 87.9 Åβ = 90.7°Asymmetric unit1 OspB-CT fragment1 OspB-CT/Fab complexVM (Å3/Da) solvent content2.032.06 (see text)39.4%52.4%Data collection temperature (K)283288No. of crystals13Wavelength (Å)0.979, 1.0730.98Resolution range (last shell) (Å)50-2.00 (2.03-2.00)50-2.60 (2.64-2.60)No. reflections measured213,479139,832No. unique reflections9,01219,155〈I/σ〉34.1 (12.6)14.6 (4.8)Completeness (%)90.2 (77.9)94.3 (87.6)Rmerge (%)6.3 (20.5)7.8 (15.7) Open table in a new tab Crystals of the OspB-CT + H6831 Fab complex were obtained by mixing 4 μl of complex with 4 μl of either: (a) 25% PEG 3350, 0.2 m sodium citrate, pH 5.6, (b) 25% PEG 3350, 5% isopropyl alcohol, 0.2 m sodium citrate, pH 5.6, or (c) 25% PEG 3350, 5% propionamide, 0.1 m MOPS, 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, pH 7.5, and then equilibrated against a 1-ml reservoir of the same solution. Crystals were rare and slow to form, appearing after several months of incubation at 277 K, with dimensions of up to 0.4 mm × 0.3 mm × 0.1 mm. Crystals were mounted in thin-walled glass capillaries, and native diffraction data were collected with cooling to 288 K. Diffraction data (Table I) could be merged satisfactorily from three crystals, one each from conditions (a), (b), and (c).Diffraction data were collected on beamlines X12B and X12C of the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS). All data were processed using Denzo and Scalepack (69Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter C.W. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology. 276. Academic Press, San Diego1997: 307-326Google Scholar).Structure Determination and Analysis—The structure of OspB-CT was determined by molecular replacement, using the C-terminal-half of OspA as a search model (PDB ID 1OSP, Ref. 6Li H.

The rotation function was performed with AMORE (70Navaza J. Acta. Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar). Patterson correlation refinement of the rotation solution was performed with CNS (71Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M.

Sect. D. 1995; 51: 853-855Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The model was refined with CNS using simulated annealing and conjugate-gradient minimization against the maximum likelihood function. Model adjustments were performed with Turbo-Frodo, guided by composite omit maps and sigma-weighted 2Fo-Fc maps. Refmac (73Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol.

Final model statistics are shown in Table II. PROCHECK (74Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.S. J. Appl.

The density for Asp-251, which is in a generously allowed region, is well defined. The remaining residues in the generously allowed and disallowed regions (Glu-217, Lys-218, and Lys-221) are part of a loop with poorly defined electron density.Table IIModel statisticsCrystal formOspB-CTOspB-CT + H6831 FabRwork0.2110.191Rfree0.2600.235Average B (Å2), all atoms32.339.2aAverage B (Å2), all atoms, Fab alone is 34.7; average B (Å2), all atoms, OspB-CT (res. 202-296) is 58.3.R.m.s. bonds (Å)0.0150.006R.m.s. angles (°)1.61.7No. protein residues140533No. waters118144PDB ID1P4P1RJLa Average B (Å2), all atoms, Fab alone is 34.7; average B (Å2), all atoms, OspB-CT (res. 202-296) is 58.3. Open table in a new tab The structure of the complex was determined by molecular replacement with AMORE. The location of the Fab was readily determined using the structure of anti-OspA Fab 184.1 (PDB ID 1OSP) (6Li H. Dunn J.J. Luft B.J. Lawson C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3584-3589Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) as the search model, with non-conserved residues truncated to alanine, but a satisfactory molecular replacement solution for OspB-CT was not obtained. The partial phases provided by the Fab solution yielded a difference electron density for the OspB-CT molecule in the position of the antigen recognition site. The three OspB-CT loops contacted by the Fab were identified using a ridgeline representation of the difference map. It was then possible to fit OspB-CT residues 202–296 into the remaining difference density. An additional 5-residue poly(Ala) strand that passes through a crystallographic 2-fold symmetry axis was modeled at 50% occupancy (see “Results”). Refinement was performed with CNS. No cutoff in F was used in the refinement. The final model statistics are shown in Table II. PROCHECK yields 84.4, 14.5, 1.1, and 0.0% in most favored, allowed, generously allowed, and disallowed regions of a Ramachandran plot, respectively. Residues Cys-135 and Asp-137 of the Fab H-chain and Lys-218 of OspB-CT in the complex are in generously allowed regions; in each case electron density is poorly defined. Electron density for Thr-262 of OspB-CT is also poorly defined.Accessible surface calculations were performed with CNS. Cavity calculations were performed using GRASP (36Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5313) Google Scholar). Molecular graphics images were prepared with Setor (75Evans S.V. J. Mol. Graph. 1993; 11: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar) and Pymol (www.pymol.org).RESULTSCrystal Structure of OspB-CT—The structure of OspB-CT was determined to a resolution of 2.0 Å. The model extends from Ser-157 to Lys-296; N-terminal residues 152–156 were not visible in electron density. As expected from sequence similarity, OspB-CT adopts the same fold as is observed for the C-terminal-half of OspA (compare Fig. 1a with Fig. 2a). The OspB-CT structure consists of twelve anti-parallel β-strands followed by a single α-helix. OspB-CT β-strands 1–4 form a free-standing sheet at the artificial N terminus that is equivalent to the C-terminal four strands of the OspA eight-stranded central sheet (OspA β-strands 10–13). OspB-CT β-strands 5–12 form two additional sheets that together with the C-terminal α-helix fold into a barrel-like domain. Superposition of 138 equivalent main chain Cα atoms of OspB-CT onto OspA yields an r.m.s. deviation of only 1.65 Å.Fig. 2a, ribbon diagram of OspA (PDB ID 1OSP, chain A, Ref. 6Li H. Dunn J.J.

(6Li H. Dunn J.J. Luft B.J. Lawson C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3584-3589Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) identified a potential binding site for an unknown ligand consisting of three charged residues contributed by three separate β-strands: Arg-139, Glu-160, and Lys-189. These residues are partially buried at the base of a prominent cleft about 5-Å wide, 24-Å long, and 8-Å deep. The side chain of Lys-189 forms a lid on a hydrophobic cavity of about 34 Å3. A similar charge triad is formed in OspB-CT by the residues Arg-162, Glu-184, and Arg-214 (Fig. 1b), and is situated at the base of an analogous prominent cleft. The side chain of Arg-214 forms the lid on an analogous cavity of about 35 Å3. No density is observed within the cavity of either OspA or OspB-CT.In the crystal, OspB-CT dimerizes with perfect 2-fold symmetry through anti-parallel association of N-terminal OspB-CT strands (Fig. 2b). The same symmetric dimer is also present in a second crystal form of OspB-CT (data not shown). The intermolecular 8-stranded “free-standing” β-sheet possessed by the OspB-CT dimer is analogous to the intramolecular free-standing β-sheet found in OspA (compare Fig. 2, a and b). Two lysine residues are brought into close proximity at the dimer interface. The relatively high pH of crystallization (9.5) probably mitigates unfavorable charge interactions between these residues. In addition, each lysine appears to be stabilized by charge-polar or charge-charge interactions with glutamates on adjacent strands.Crystal Structure of an OspB-CT·Bactericidal Fab Complex—The structure of the OspB-CT·H6831Fab complex was determined to 2.6-Å resolution. The final refined model includes OspB-CT residues 202–296 plus Fab heavy and light chains; OspB-CT residues 157–201 were not visible in electron density. The structure reveals that three adjacent surface-exposed loops of OspB-CT are contacted by the Fab (Fig. 3a). The H6831 epitope of OspB is topologically equivalent to the LA-2 epitope of OspA (7Ding W. Huang X. Yang X. Dunn J.J. Luft B.J. Koide S. Lawson C.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 1153-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3b). A striking feature of the OspB-CT·H6831 interaction is the prevalence of aromatic residues contributed by the Fab (Fig. 3c), a feature common to antigen-antibody complexes (37Davies D.R. Cohen G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The majority of electrostatic and hydrogen-bonded interactions are between loop 2 (residues 250–254) and the Fab heavy chain; these include one ion pair, three direct hydrogen bonds, and one water-mediated hydrogen bond. There are two hydrogen bonds between loop 1 (residues 231–233) and the Fab heavy chain, and two hydrogen bonds between loop 3 (residues 272–276) and the Fab light chain. Three waters form well defined hydrogen-bonded bridges between the heavy and light chains of the Fab across the antigen-combining site. There are only small conformational differences in the epitope loops in the complex compared with free OspB-CT (more details given below). The buried surface area at the interface of the OspB-CT·H6831 complex (1095 Å2) is smaller than that buried at the interface of the OspA·LA2 complex (1599 Å2). In the case of the OspA·LA-2 complex, loop 1 has the most extensive interactions with the Fab, whereas in the case of OspB-CT·H6831 complex, loop 1 has the fewest interactions with the Fab (Fig. 4a, bar graph).Fig. 3a, ribbon diagram of the OspB-CT·H6831 complex. The Fab light chain is in green; the heavy chain is in yellow. b, ribbon diagram of the OspA·LA-2 complex, with OspA in approximately the same orientation as OspB-CT (PDB ID 2OSP, Ref. 7Ding W.

https://openalex.org/W2022922351,"We are interested in the mechanism of cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) regulation in colon cancer cells because this knowledge could provide insight into colon carcinogenesis and suggest ways to suppress Cox-2 expression in colon tumors. Studying the HT-29 colon cancer cell line as a model, we found that Cox-2 mRNA and protein levels were activated over 10-fold by the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Moreover, we found that the histone deacetylase inhibitors butyrate and trichostatin A could block Cox-2 activation in a gene-specific manner. TNF-α and butyrate did not significantly affect Cox-2 promoter activity, mRNA stability, or negative regulation by the Cox-2 3′-untranslated RNA region. A nuclear run-on assay showed that TNF-α increased Cox-2 transcription, whereas butyrate was suppressive. Because butyrate has been reported to suppress polymerase elongation on the c-myc gene, we employed the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to determine the influence of butyrate and trichostatin A on polymerase distribution on the Cox-2 gene. These data indicated that butyrate restricted polymerase elongation from exon 1 to 2 on both the c-myc and Cox-2 genes. We propose that histone deacetylases regulate a transcriptional block on the Cox-2 and c-myc genes and that this block may be a potential target for pharmacological intervention. We are interested in the mechanism of cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) regulation in colon cancer cells because this knowledge could provide insight into colon carcinogenesis and suggest ways to suppress Cox-2 expression in colon tumors. Studying the HT-29 colon cancer cell line as a model, we found that Cox-2 mRNA and protein levels were activated over 10-fold by the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Moreover, we found that the histone deacetylase inhibitors butyrate and trichostatin A could block Cox-2 activation in a gene-specific manner. TNF-α and butyrate did not significantly affect Cox-2 promoter activity, mRNA stability, or negative regulation by the Cox-2 3′-untranslated RNA region. A nuclear run-on assay showed that TNF-α increased Cox-2 transcription, whereas butyrate was suppressive. Because butyrate has been reported to suppress polymerase elongation on the c-myc gene, we employed the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to determine the influence of butyrate and trichostatin A on polymerase distribution on the Cox-2 gene. These data indicated that butyrate restricted polymerase elongation from exon 1 to 2 on both the c-myc and Cox-2 genes. We propose that histone deacetylases regulate a transcriptional block on the Cox-2 and c-myc genes and that this block may be a potential target for pharmacological intervention.

Cancer. 2001; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). A number of cytokines, physiological stresses, oncogenes, and mitogens have been identified to be potent inducers of Cox-2 expression in various types of cells and tissues (3Herschman H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). Cox-2-specific inhibitors have been developed to treat inflammation and cancer (4Warner T.D. Mitchell J.A. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 790-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). In addition to the pharmacological inhibition of Cox-2 activity, a number of anti-inflammatory and antineoplastic compounds, including dexamethasone, resveratrol, and flavonoids, have been shown to suppress Cox-2 gene expression (4Warner T.D.

A better mechanistic understanding of Cox-2 regulation could illuminate important cellular changes that accompany inflammation and cancer and may also lead to the development of novel approaches to suppress Cox-2 expression. Short chain fatty acids are present in the colonic lumen at millimolar concentrations (10Cummings J.H. Pomare E.W. Branch W.J. Naylor C.P. Macfarlane G.T. Gut. 1987; 28: 1221-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2023) Google Scholar, 11Fredstrom S.B. Lampe J.W. Jung H.J. Slavin J.L. J. Parenter. Enteral Nutr. 1994; 18: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These microbial metabolites of dietary fiber have been shown to have a profound impact on colonocyte growth, differentiation, and turnover. Among the lumenal short chain fatty acids, butyrate possesses the most potent cellular effects and has been under intensive study for more than a decade for its anti-inflammatory and antineoplastic activities (12Heerdt B.G. Houston M.A. Augenlicht L.H. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3288-3293PubMed Google Scholar, 13Singh B. Halestrap A.P. Paraskeva C. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 1265-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The potential benefit of butyrate for tissue health and function has prompted research on the influence of butyrate on cellular gene expression and signaling pathways. Of particular interest is the influence of butyrate on the expression of genes involved in cellular growth regulation and the inflammatory response. When applied to cells at concentrations that approximate those found in the colon, cells undergo a number of dramatic alterations such as a reduced cell proliferation rate (14Hodin R.A. Meng S. Archer S. Tang R. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 647-653PubMed Google Scholar), an increased expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p21 (15Scheinman R.I. Gualberto A. Jewell C.M. Cidlowski J.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 943-953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hinnebusch B.F. Meng S. Wu J.T. Archer S.Y. Hodin R.A. J.

Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 495-501PubMed Google Scholar). Accompanying these changes in cell physiology is a dramatic alteration in the cellular response to inflammatory stimuli. Specifically, nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation by stimuli such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α is dramatically down-regulated in cells that have undergone butyrate-induced growth arrest and differentiation (19Inan M.S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 44641-44646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Butyrate influences a number of cellular processes, but the one most closely associated with gene regulation is the ability of butyrate to inhibit histone deacetylases (HDACs) (23Davie J.R. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: 2485S-2493SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cancer cell growth arrest by butyrate has been attributed to increased expression of the p21 cell cycle inhibitor (17Archer S.Y. Meng S. Shei A. Hodin R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6791-6796Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar), which results from the inhibition of HDACs that stably associate with the p21 promoter (24Nakano K. Mizuno T. Sowa Y. Orita T. Yoshino T. Okuyama Y. Fujita T. Ohtani-Fujita N. Matsukawa Y. Tokino T. Yamagishi H. Oka T. Nomura H. Sakai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22199-22206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). This inhibition leads to the acetylation of promoter-associated histones and the opening of the chromatin structure for pre-initiation complex formation. However, HDAC inhibitors can also trigger the down-regulation of genes that promote cancer cell proliferation. Examples of genes down-regulated by HDAC inhibitors include c-myc and c-Src (25Souleimani A. Asselin C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 26Kostyniuk C.L. Dehm S.M. Batten D. Bonham K. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6340-6347Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 27Dehm S.M. Hilton T.L. Wang E.H. Bonham K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2296-2307Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The c-Src gene has a promoter element that mediates the repression by HDAC inhibitors (26Kostyniuk C.L. Dehm S.M. Batten D. Bonham K. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6340-6347Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). HDAC inhibitors suppress c-myc expression by inducing an elongational arrest and/or premature termination event between exons 1 and 2 of the c-myc gene (28Heruth D.P. Zirnstein G.W. Bradley J.F. Rothberg P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20466-20472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Exactly how HDAC inhibitors down-regulate these genes is not well understood, but this down-regulation could involve the acetylation of gene-regulatory proteins other than histones. We previously reported that the HDAC inhibitors butyrate and trichostatin A (TSA) each reduce Cox-2 activation in the HT-29 colon cancer cell line (29Tong X. Yin L. Giardina C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 317: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Understanding how Cox-2 and other genes are down-regulated by HDAC inhibitors could provide new information on basic mechanisms of gene regulation and may also help to elucidate the role of HDACs in maintaining a transformed cell phenotype. In this study, we describe evidence that HDAC inhibitors influence Cox-2 expression in a manner similar to that by which they exert their effect on the c-myc gene: by a selective suppression of RNA polymerase II elongation. Cell Culture and Treatment—Human colon cancer cell line HT-29 was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The cell line was propagated in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, nonessential amino acids, streptomycin (50 μg/ml), and penicillin (50 units/ml). The MHS cell line was a generous gift from Dr. David Knecht. All media components were purchased from Invitrogen. TNF-α was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) and used at a final concentration of 100 ng/ml. Actinomycin D, sodium butyrate, and TSA were purchased from Sigma and used at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml, 4 mm, and 1 μm, respectively. Cell Fractionation for Western Blot—Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline buffer and incubated in lysis buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 15 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with proteinase inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and 1 mm dithiothreitol for 8 min on ice. After centrifugation for 5 min at maximum speed in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge, the supernatant was collected and frozen in a –70 °C freezer before analysis. Plasmid Constructs—Cox-2 pLuc3′±UTR constructs were generous gifts from Dr. Stephen Prescott (University of Utah). The –1431 to +89 promoter region of the Cox-2 gene, which includes binding sites for TCF4, NF-κB, c-myb, and cAMP-response element-binding protein, was obtained by PCR amplification with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using restriction enzyme-tailed primers. The amplified product was cloned into the pGL3 basic promoter (Promega, Madison, WI). The proximal 123-nucleotide Cox-2 3′-UTR containing multiple AU-rich elements (AREs) was PCR-amplified using primers with XbaI restriction sites and ligated into the Cox-2 promoter vector, downstream of the luciferase coding region, using a BD in-fusion cloning kit (Clontech). The subsequent vector was named the Cox-2 promoter 3′-UTR luciferase construct. The pcDNA/LacZ plasmid (Invitrogen) was used as an internal control for transfection efficiency to normalize luciferase activity. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Activity Assays—Transient transfection of luciferase reporter plasmids was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer for a 24-well plate format. Luciferase assays were performed using the Promega luciferase assay system. After cell treatments, cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 75 μl of cell culture lysis reagent (Promega). Five μl of the resulting supernatant was mixed with 50 μl of luciferase assay solution, and luminescence was determined with a Turner Design Luminometer. All experiments were performed in triplicate and normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared as described in a previously reported protocol (19Inan M.S. Rasoulpour R.J. Yin L. Hubbard A.K. Rosenberg D.W. Giardina C. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 724-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). For the DNA binding assays, double-stranded Cox-2 NF-κB binding probe GGGAGGGGGGATTCCCTGCGCC was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The DNA-protein complexes were resolved in a 4% native acrylamide gel and exposed to x-ray film. The protein composition was confirmed by supershift with specific antibodies against NF-κB subunits, whereas specificity was validated by cold probe competition assay. Immunoblotting—For immunoblotting studies, 20 μg of protein sample was denatured under reducing conditions, separated on 10% SDS polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose by voltage gradient transfer. The resulting blots were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk, and specific proteins were detected with the following primary antibodies: anti-Cox-2 (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) and anti-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). A chemiluminescence detection system was employed for the detection of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies on the immunoblots (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was prepared from cultured cells using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Five μg of total RNA from each sample was reverse transcribed into cDNA by Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The resulting cDNA was treated with 1 unit of RNase H at 37 °C for 20 min. A “no RT” control reaction with all the components except reverse transcriptase was used to confirm the absence of genomic DNA contamination. One μl of each reverse transcription reaction was used for semiquantitative PCR amplification as reported previously (29Tong X. Yin L. Giardina C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 317: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). RNase Protection Assay (RPA)—In brief, in vitro transcription was used to synthesize radioactive cRNA probe using T7 RNA polymerase and 1 μg of a custom-made linearized template (BD PharMingen). After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, the template DNA was digested with DNase I. After extraction with phenol-chloroform, the labeled RNA was ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in 50 μl of hybridization buffer. About 1 × 106 cpm of cRNA probe was hybridized to 10 μg of total RNA for 12 h at 56 °C. After this incubation, the reaction was digested with an RNase mixture, followed by a proteinase K digestion. The reaction was extracted with phenol-chloroform and ethanol-precipitated. The products were analyzed in a 7% polyacrylamide-urea gel. The housekeeping genes L32 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were used to normalize RNA loading differences. Nuclear Run-on with Biotin Labeling—Nuclear run-on reactions were performed as described by Patrone et al. (30Patrone G. Puppo F. Cusano R. Scaranari M. Ceccherini I. Puliti A. Ravazzolo R. BioTechniques. 2000; 29 (1016–1017): 1012-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), with minor modification. Nuclei were prepared from 40 × 106 HT-29 cells by resuspension in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 150 mm sucrose, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) followed by Dounce homogenization (10 strokes, pestle B). Nuclei were isolated by centrifugation, and the pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of glycerol buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, 40% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm EDTA). One hundred μl of transcription buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8; 200 mm KCl; 5 mm MgCl2; 4 mm dithiothreitol; 4 mm each of ATP, GTP, and CTP; 200 mm sucrose; and 20% glycerol) was added to the nuclei along with 10 μl of biotin-16-UTP (Roche Diagnostics). After incubation at 29 °C for 30 min, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 6 μl of 250 mm CaCl2 and 6 μl of RNase-free DNase I and incubation for 10 min at 29 °C. To purify RNA, 100 μl of SDS/Tris buffer and 10 μl of proteinase K were added to the samples, which were incubated at 42 °C for 30 min. A TRIzol extraction, phenol-chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation were then performed. A small aliquot was saved as “total nuclear RNA” for each treatment. Dynabeads M-280 streptavidin (Dynal Biotech, Oslo, Norway) were mixed with an equal volume of the isolated RNA samples for 20 min at 42 °C and 2 h at room temperature. After washing with 15% formamide and 2× SSC, the beads were resuspended in 20 μl of nuclease-free water and used in BD Powerscript RT reaction (Clontech). Six μl of this RT reaction was used for PCR cycling with primers amplifying Cox-2 (40 cycles) or actin (34 cycles). Cox-2 exon 5 primers were used for this analysis. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP was carried out using the Upstate kit. Cells were plated onto 100-mm dishes and treated with TNF-α for 2 h in the presence or absence of butyrate or TSA. Protein-DNA cross-links were formed by incubation of cells in 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min (following a brief phosphate-buffered saline wash). Adding glycine at a final concentration of 0.125 m stopped the cross-linking. After sonication for 20 s to generate 400-bp fragments on average, the lysate was pre-cleared with a protein A bead slurry and then incubated with 10 μg of specific antibodies against RNA polymerase II (Covance, Berkeley, CA). One hundred μg of the clear lysate was saved as an “input” control. An immunoprecipitation reaction with mouse IgG was set up to check for antibody specificity. Sixty μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose was added to each tube, and the beads were pelleted and washed. After phenol-chloroform extraction, the protein-chromatin cross-linking was reversed. The following primers for various regions of the Cox-2 gene or c-myc were synthesized for PCR: Cox-2 exon 1, ACGACTTGCAGTGAGCGTCA (forward) and GCGCCAGGTACTCACCTGTA (reverse); Cox-2 exon 2, ATTTATTTGCTGTCCTTTAATTGCAG (forward) and AATGAGGCAAACCAAAGGACAAACTTAC (reverse); Cox-2 exon 3, CCTCCCTTTCTTCGTCTTCTTGCAG (forward) and CTTAGAAAGACACTTGTACTTAC (reverse); Cox-2 exon 4, AACATTTTTTTCTTTGAAAATTTCAG (forward) and ATCTCTAATGGATTCTTCTTACTCAC (reverse); Cox-2 exon 5, GTAAAAAGCAGCTTCCTGA (forward) and CCCATGGCCCAGCCCGTTGG (reverse); c-myc exon 1, ATTCCAGTGAGAGGCAGAGG (forward) and GCTGCTATGGGCAAAGTTTC (reverse); and c-myc exon 2, AGAGAAGCTGGCCTCCTACC (forward) and CGTCGAGGAGAGCAGAGAAT (reverse). The resulting products, ranging from 180 to 230 bp, were resolved in a 1% agarose gel. Statistical Analysis—Group data from experiments are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical analyses were performed using either Student's t test for two paired data or ANOVA for three or more sets of data. p values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Butyrate Suppresses Cox-2 Activation in HT-29 Cells—In a previous report, we showed that the HDAC inhibitors butyrate and TSA suppressed Cox-2 gene activation in the HT-29 cells (29Tong X. Yin L. Giardina C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 317: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To determine the specificity of this inhibition, we determined the influence of butyrate on the expression of a panel of oncogenes and inflammatory response genes using an RPA. In this experiment, HT-29 cells were treated with TNF-α for 2 h in the presence or absence of butyrate (with butyrate exposure initiated 30 min prior to TNF-α stimulation). As shown in Fig. 1A, TNF-α activated TNF-α, IL-8, Cox-2, and c-Myc mRNA expression. Interestingly, butyrate suppressed Cox-2 and c-Myc mRNA synthesis. IL-8 expression showed less of an inhibition, whereas cyclin D1, Fas, and TNF-α were not affected. These data indicate that Cox-2 gene activation is particularly sensitive to butyrate. Fig. 1B shows that the butyrate suppression of Cox-2 mRNA expression corresponds to a drop in Cox-2 protein levels. The effect of butyrate on Cox-2 activation does not appear to be common to all cell types. As shown in Fig. 1C, Cox-2 activation by lipopolysaccharide in a macrophage cell line (MHS) was not inhibited by butyrate. TNF-α activation of Cox-2 was not observed in MHS cells (Fig. 1C). To determine whether another HDAC inhibitor could also suppress Cox-2 gene activation, we tested the ability of TSA to block the TNF-α-induced activation of Cox-2. Fig. 2 shows that TSA also down-regulated both Cox-2 and c-myc expression. This finding supports the role of HDACs in regulating Cox-2 and c-myc expression. Butyrate Does Not Affect Cox-2 Promoter Activity or NF-κB Activation—Cox-2 expression can be regulated at multiple steps, including transcriptional and post-transcriptional steps (31Ramsay R.G. Ciznadija D. Vanevski M. Mantamadiotis T. Int. J. Immunopathol. Pharmacol. 2003; 16: 59-67PubMed Google Scholar). The Cox-2 5′-promoter region contains a canonical TATA box and binding sites for a number of transcriptional activators, including TCF4, SP-1, NF-κB, and NF-IL-6 (32Appleby S.B. Ristimaki A. Neilson K. Narko K. Hla T. Biochem. J. 1994; 302 (Pt 3): 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). To determine whether butyrate affects Cox-2 promoter activity, HT-29 cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid regulated by a 1.6-kb fragment of the Cox-2 promoter. This promoter construct includes binding sites for TCF4, NF-κB, and NF-IL-6. As shown in Fig. 3A, no activation of the reporter gene was observed after TNF-α stimulation. Moreover, neither butyrate nor TSA treatment significantly affected Cox-2 promoter activity (p > 0.05). We also considered the possibility that butyrate might be inhibiting NF-κB activation because NF-κB has been reported to contribute to Cox-2 expression (33Inoue H. Tanabe T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 34Kojima M. Morisaki T. Izuhara K. Uchiyama A. Matsunari Y. Katano M. Tanaka M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1225-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This possibility seemed particularly appealing, given the fact that butyrate suppresses NF-κB activation in HT-29 cells (19Inan M.S. Rasoulpour R.J. Yin L. Hubbard A.K. Rosenberg D.W. Giardina C. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 724-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). However, we did not observe any inhibition of NF-κB binding to the Cox-2 promoter region when the butyrate exposure was initiated just 30 min prior to TNF-α stimulation (following the protocol described above; Fig. 3B). Instead, NF-κB inhibition required an 18-h pre-incubation with butyrate, in agreement with previous reports (19Inan M.S. Rasoulpour R.J. Yin L. Hubbard A.K. Rosenberg D.W. Giardina C. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 724-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 22Yin L. Laevsky G. Giardina C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44641-44646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). These results, combined with the luciferase reporter data, indicate that Cox-2 promoter activity is not the likely target of the HDAC inhibitors. Butyrate Does Not Alter Cox-2 mRNA Stability in HT-29 Cells—Another layer of regulation of Cox-2 activation is achieved at the post-transcriptional level (31Ramsay R.G. Ciznadija D. Vanevski M. Mantamadiotis T. Int. J. Immunopathol. Pharmacol. 2003; 16: 59-67PubMed Google Scholar, 35Dixon D.A. Kaplan C.D. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11750-11757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Cox-2 mRNA stability is primarily regulated by 23 copies of the Shaw-Kamen ARE in the 3′-UTR (36Caput D. Beutler B. Hartog K. Thayer R. Brown-Shimer S. Cerami A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1670-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar, 37Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3124) Google Scholar, 38Xu N. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4611-4621Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 39Sengupta S. Jang B.C. Wu M.T. Paik J.H. Furneaux H. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25227-25233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar): in response to exogenous signals, the ARE-directed decay is temporarily suppressed to allow for rapid mRNA accumulation. The ARE is also involved in regulating Cox-2 mRNA translation (40Mukhopadhyay D. Houchen C.W. Kennedy S. Dieckgraefe B.K. Anant S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 113-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). To test the possibility that butyrate impacts the Cox-2 ARE, cytomegalovirus promoter-driven luciferase constructs with or without the Cox-2 3′-UTR region were transfected into HT-29 cells and tested for their response to TNF-α or TNF-α + butyrate. As shown in Fig. 4A, the presence of the Cox-2 3′-UTR resulted in a significant drop in luciferase activity (p < 0.01), consistent with its destabilizing activity. Although TNF-α modestly activated the reporter genes (irrespective of the Cox-2 UTR; p < 0.05), butyrate did not reduce the reporter activity. To determine whether the influence of butyrate required an interaction between the Cox-2 promoter and the UTR, the essential conserved region 1 (CR1) element of the Cox-2 3′-UTR was fused downstream of the luciferase coding region in a Cox-2 promoter-luciferase reporter construct (41Gou Q. Liu C.H. Ben-Av P. Hla T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 508-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Again, insertion of the CR1 region caused a significant drop in reporter gene activity, indicating that this element functions as expected (p < 0.01; Fig. 4B). However, the presence of butyrate did not cause any significant decline in luciferase expression (p > 0.05). Results from Fig. 4 provide evidence that the butyrate effect is not likely to be mediated through the Cox-2 3′-UTR region. We also performed an actinomycin D chase experiment to determine whether butyrate was influencing Cox-2 mRNA turnover. As shown in Fig. 5A, we observed that the TNF-α-induced Cox-2 mRNA levels remained relatively stable after actinomycin D halted transcription. This finding is in contrast to the rapid decay of the unstable TNF-α and c-Myc mRNAs (Fig. 5A). However, the level of Cox-2 mRNA in cells treated with butyrate was too low to be detected by an RPA. A more sensitive RT-PCR assay was employed to monitor Cox-2 mRNA degradation in the presence of actinomycin D. As shown in Fig. 5B, there was no noticeable increase of Cox-2 degradation in butyrate-treated cells. The results in Fig. 5 indicate that Cox-2 mRNA stability is not likely to be involved in the repressive activity of butyrate. Nuclear Run-on Shows That Butyrate Suppresses Cox-2 Transcription—Because the above-mentioned experiments demonstrated that neither butyrate nor TSA alters the Cox-2 promoter activity or mRNA stability, we considered the possibility that butyrate or TSA might affect transcriptional events downstream of initiation. To determine the effect of butyrate on the Cox-2 transcription rate, we performed a nuclear run-on assay. Specifically, we determined the ability of nuclei isolated from butyrate-treated cells to incorporate biotinylated uracil into Cox-2 RNA. Fig. 6 shows that the level of biotinylated Cox-2 RNA generated in nuclei from TNF-α-stimulated cells was greater than that obtained from untreated cells or from cells treated with TNF-α and butyrate (a run-on reaction performed in the absence of biotinylated UTP showed no band, confirming that run-on RNA was being analyzed). Actin transcription was found to be even across the panel (except when biotinylated UTP was omitted from the run-on reaction). Fig. 6 also shows the levels of Cox-2 a"
https://openalex.org/W2096569729,"tmRNA (transfer messenger RNA) is a unique molecule used by all bacteria to rescue stalled ribosomes and to mark unfinished peptides with a specific degradation signal. tmRNA is recruited by arrested ribosomes in which it facilitates the translational switch from cellular mRNA to the mRNA part of tmRNA. Small protein B (SmpB) is a key partner for the trans-translation activity of tmRNA both in vivo and in vitro. It was shown that SmpB acts at the initiation step of the trans-translation process by facilitating tmRNA aminoacylation and binding to the ribosome. Little is known about the subsequent steps of trans-translation. Here we demonstrated the first example of an investigation of tmRNA·ribosome complexes at different stages of trans-translation. Our results show that the structural element at the position of tmRNA pseudoknot 3 remains intact during the translation of the mRNA module of tmRNA and that it is localized on the surface of the ribosome. At least one SmpB molecule remains bound to a ribosome·tmRNA complex isolated from the cell when translation is blocked at different positions within the mRNA part of tmRNA. tmRNA (transfer messenger RNA) is a unique molecule used by all bacteria to rescue stalled ribosomes and to mark unfinished peptides with a specific degradation signal. tmRNA is recruited by arrested ribosomes in which it facilitates the translational switch from cellular mRNA to the mRNA part of tmRNA.

(SsrA RNA or 10 S RNA (1Lee S.Y. Bailey S.C. Apirion D. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 133: 1015-1023Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) is a small stable RNA that is found in all eubacteria as well as in some chloroplasts and mitochondria (2Zwieb C. Wower I. Wower J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2063-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 3Keiler K.C. Shapiro L. Williams K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7778-7783Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Its 3′- and 5′-ends are folded into a tRNA-like structure with an amino acid acceptor stem that possesses identity elements of tRNAAla and enables specific aminoacylation of the tmRNA by alanyl-tRNA synthetase (4Komine Y.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3392-3396Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). tmRNA has a short open reading frame in the middle of the molecule surrounded by pseudoknots (the mRNA module) that encodes a degradation signal (tag peptide) (6Tu G.F.

Chem. 1995; 270: 9322-9326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) for certain cellular proteases (ClpXP, ClpAP) (7Gottesman S. Roche E. Zhou Y.N. Sauer R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1338-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). The combination of properties for both tRNA and mRNA results in an unusual translational mechanism for this molecule known as “trans-translation,” switching translation from cellular mRNA lacking stop codon to the coding part of tmRNA, thus adding the tag peptide to the truncated polypeptide chain (8Keiler K.C. Waller P.R. Sauer R.T. Science. 1996; 271: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). Several proteins were shown to function during the initiation of tmRNA-mediated trans-translation. Elongation factor Tu is important for initial tmRNA binding to the ribosome (9Rudinger-Thirion J. Giege R. Felden B. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and may also facilitate the structural rearrangement of the tmRNA molecule (10Zvereva M.I. Ivanov P.V. Teraoka Y. Topilina N.I.

Ribosomal protein S1 may bind to the mRNA part of tmRNA (11Wower I.K. Zwieb C.W. Guven S.A. Wower J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6612-6621Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) in a manner similar to that of cellular mRNA (12Odom O.W. Deng H-Y. Subramanian A.R. Hardesty B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 230: 178-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Small protein B (SmpB) is the only key protein known to be essential and specific for trans-translation. Both in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that trans-translation does not take place in the absence of SmpB (13Karzai A.W. Susskind M.M. Sauer R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3793-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 14Hanawa-Suetsugu K. Takagi M. Inokuchi H. Himeno H. Muto A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1620-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This protein also facilitates tmRNA aminoacylation (15Barends S. Karzai A.W. Sauer R.T. Wower J. Kraal B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that all SmpB molecules are bound to ribosomes within the cell. Moreover, one ribosome can bind two protein molecules that remain bound to the ribosome even after the transfer of undersynthesized peptide to tmRNA (16Hallier M. Ivanova N. Rametti A. Pavlov M. Ehrenberg M. Felden B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25978-25985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). SmpB was also found to be the partner of tmRNA on entering the ribosome during the pre-accommodation stage (17Valle M. Gillet R. Kaur S. Henne A. Ramakrishnan V. Frank J. Science. 2003; 300: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Comparison of the x-ray crystal structure of a ribonucleoprotein complex that includes a tmRNA fragment and SmpB (18Gutmann S. Haebel P.W. Metzinger L. Sutter M. Felden B. Ban N. Nature. 2003; 424: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) with cryo-electron microscopic (cryo-EM) data for tmRNA·SmpB complex entering the ribosome (17Valle M. Gillet R. Kaur S. Henne A. Ramakrishnan V. Frank J. Science. 2003; 300: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) shows that SmpB protein may change its position within the tmRNA. The interaction of tmRNA with the ribosome was studied by cryo-EM only at the pre-accommodation stage (17Valle M. Gillet R. Kaur S. Henne A. Ramakrishnan V. Frank J. Science. 2003; 300: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Little is known about such interactions at later stages of trans-translation. Recently we proposed a hypothetical model describing how tmRNA may first enter and than pass through the ribosome (19Ivanov P.V. Zvereva M.I. Shpanchenko O.V. Dontsova O.A. Bogdanov A.A. Aglyamova G.V. Lim V.I. Teraoka Y. Nierhaus K.H. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The predicted conformation of tmRNA at the initial stage of its interaction with the ribosome was confirmed by cryo-EM (17Valle M. Gillet R. Kaur S. Henne A. Ramakrishnan V. Frank J. Science. 2003; 300: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). According to our model, several structural elements of tmRNA should remain intact during the passage of tmRNA through the ribosome, and they should be located on the surface of ribosome (19Ivanov P.V. Zvereva M.I. Shpanchenko O.V. Dontsova O.A. Bogdanov A.A. Aglyamova G.V. Lim V.I. Teraoka Y. Nierhaus K.H. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Here, we have presented the first example of trans-translation study at different stages of the passage of tmRNA through ribosome based on the isolation and investigation of tmRNA·ribosome complexes in which ribosomes stopped at the 4th or 11th codon of the coding part of tmRNA. Strains—The XL-1 strain of Escherichia coli was used for all of the genetic manipulations. X91 strain (ΔssrA) (20Williams K.P. Martindale K.A. Bartel D.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5423-5433Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) was a kind gift of Dr. K. Williams. The SKZ-1 strain of E. coli with disrupted tmRNA gene and thermosensitive RF2 was made and used for the isolation of tmRNA·ribosome complex as follows. The chromosomal prfB+ gene of E. coli X91 (20Williams K.P. Martindale K.A. Bartel D.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5423-5433Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) was replaced with the prfB2 allele by co-transduction with the nearby zgc21::Tn10 marker that gave tetracycline resistance, using phage P1 and UY2687 as a donor strain (21Bjornsson A. Isaksson L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1753-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The transduction was performed according to a standard procedure (22Platt T. Mueller-Hill B. Miller J.H. Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar). To do that, a P1 stock was made in UY2687 cells. Strain X91 was than used as a recipient, and selection was made for tetracycline resistance. Co-transduction of the prfB2 allele was determined by screening for decreased ability to grow on low salt LB at 42 °C. The absence of ssrA gene in the resulting strain SKZ-1 was confirmed by PCR as described previously (20Williams K.P. Martindale K.A. Bartel D.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5423-5433Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Plasmids—To remove the sequence corresponding to pseudoknot 3 (pk3) and to introduce the KpnI and SmaI sites for the subsequent cloning of streptavidin-binding aptamer, two fragments of tmDNA were amplified by PCR from the plasmid pGEM-ssrA (19Ivanov P.V. Zvereva M.I. Shpanchenko O.V. Dontsova O.A. Bogdanov A.A. Aglyamova G.V. Lim V.I. Teraoka Y. Nierhaus K.H. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) in the presence of DNA primers 5′-GAG ATC GCG TGG AAG CCC GGT ACC CCC GGG TAC TCA GGC TAG TTT GTT AGT GGC-3′ and 5′-GGC AAG CTT ACT TCG CGG GAC AAA TTG-3′ (Pri2), and 5′-GCC ACT AAC AAA CTA GCC TGA GTA CCC GGG GGT ACC GGG CTT CCA CGC GAT CTC-5′ and 5′-GCG GGA TCC TAA CGA TAA CGC CAT TGA G-3′ (Pri1), respectively. After annealing, the recessed DNA 3′-ends were filled by Klenow fragment, and tmDNA was amplified by PCR in the presence of Pri1 and Pri2 oligonucleotides. This DNA was digested with BamHI and HindIII and cloned into BamHI-HindIII-digested pGEM-ssrA resulting in the pGEM-500 plasmid. pGEM-500, cut with KpnI and SmaI, was ligated with annealed oligonucleotides coding for streptavidin-binding aptamer (23Srisawat C. Engelke D.R. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 632-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) carrying the KpnI and SmaI sites in the ends. The resulting plasmid was named pGEM-stra. pGEM-stra-11 and pGEM-stra-4 coding for tmRNA-11 and tmRNA-4, respectively, with mutated termination signals (stop codons in position 4 and 11 of the tag sequence) as well as pGEM-tmRNA-His6 coding for tag peptide containing 6 His residues were constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutant sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. In Vivo Functional Assays—The activities of the mutant tmRNA-4 and tmRNA-11 were tested as described in the Williams system (20Williams K.P. Martindale K.A. Bartel D.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5423-5433Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) with some modifications. The plasmid pACYC184 was digested by NcoI and PvuII to delete the chloramphenicol-acetyltransferase gene. The functional domain represented by fragment coding the kanamycin resistance gene and the phage P22 Arc repressor gene lacking the stop codon and controlled by a tac promoter was subcloned from plasmid p6A (kindly provided by Dr. K. Williams) into plasmid pACYC184 with deleted chloramphenicol-acetyltransferase gene using standard techniques. The resulting plasmid p6B was transformed together with the plasmid encoding tmRNA into E. coli strain X91 (ΔssrA). The activity of mutant tmRNA molecules in vivo was tested using standard selective plates containing LB agar with 50 μg/ml ampicillin, 100 μg/ml kanamycin, 25 μg/ml tetracycline, and 1 mm IPTG and compared with wild-type tmRNA (plasmid pGEM-ssrA) (Fig. 2A). To test the trans-translation activity, the SKZ1 strain was transformed with pGEM-tmRNA-6His. In control experiments the X91 strain was transformed with the same plasmid. The cells with or without the plasmid were grown at 37 °C to 0.6 A600 units/ml, and protein content was analyzed by standard gel electrophoresis followed by Western blot using anti-(His6) antibodies. Complex Preparation and Affinity Purification—For complex isolation, SKZ-1 cells carrying the appropriate plasmids were grown in low salt LB medium (1 g of NaCl/liter) at 37 °C to 0.3 A600 units/ml. The temperature was increased to 42 °C, and after 2 h the cells were quickly cooled and harvested by centrifugation. Cell lysates were obtained as described (24Rheinberger H-J. Geigenmuller U. Wedde M. Nierhaus K.H. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 164: 658-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and the ribosomal fraction was purified via centrifugation through a sucrose cushion using 10/30% sucrose in buffer A, containing 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 100 mm NH4Cl, and 4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, for 18 h at 4 °C and 35,000 rpm in Ti70 rotor (Beckman). The ribosomal pellet was rinsed with buffer A and resuspended under continuous gentle stirring for about 2 h. We call these ribosomes the “initial ribosomal fraction.” Approximately 10 nmol of this initial ribosomal fraction was incubated with 500 μl of streptavidin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for about 12 h at 4 °C in a 2-ml tube. The resin was washed several times with buffer A until the release of the ribosomes into the wash solution became negligible; this was determined by monitoring its absorption at 260 nm. The elution was carried out for 4 h using 0.5 ml of biotin-saturated buffer A (∼220 μg/ml). The stability of the isolated complex was tested by sucrose gradient centrifugation. The complex sedimented as a single 70 S peak. No tmRNA appeared in the top fraction of the gradient as confirmed by gel electrophoretic analysis (data not shown). RNA Content of the Complex—The RNA fraction of the complex was analyzed by electrophoresis following phenol extraction (25Nowotny P. Nowotny V. Voss H. Nierhaus K.H. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 164: 131-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) using a 5% polyacrylamide 7 m urea denaturing gel (19:1 (w/w) monomer to bisacrylamide). The RNAs were stained with methylene blue. The semi-dry method was applied to transfer RNA onto a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences) for subsequent Northern hybridization. RNA was visualized using digoxigenin (DIG) reagents for nonradioactive nucleic acid labeling and detection system (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The DIG-labeled DNA probes used were a 404-bp-long fragment complementary to tmRNA, carrying an aptamer with high affinity for streptavidin, and a 75-bp-long fragment complementary to tRNAPro. The probes were prepared by PCR using DIG-dUTP (Roche Applied Science) and pGEM-stra or E. coli genomic DNA as a template for the synthesis of the 404-bp-long fragment and the 75-bp-long fragment, respectively. Protein Content of the Complex—After trichloroacetic acid precipitation proteins were separated in 17.5% Tricine-SDS-PAGE (26Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar) and stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. For quantitative analysis of SmpB content the purified SmpB-His6 protein (kindly provided by Y. Teraoka) was used. Certain amounts of SmpB and TP70 as well as the proteins from the complex were separated in the same gel. The intensities of the bands corresponding to SmpB and ribosomal protein L2 were determined by scanning with the Gel Explorer 1.0 program. The ratio of intensities of L2 to SmpB was estimated as 2.9 ± 0.3. This coefficient was used to normalize the experimental ratio of L2 to SmpB intensities in the case of each complex to determine the molar ratio of L2/SmpB. Mass Spectrometric (MS) Analyses—A protein band at approximately 18-19 kDa (Fig. 4, A and B) cut from the protein gel was subjected to reduction, alkylation, trypsin digestion, and peptide purification as described previously (27Krutchinsky A.N. Kalkum M. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 5066-5077Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Desalted peptides were transferred onto a MALDI-MS sample plate, mixed with the MALDI matrix 4-hydroxy-α-cyanocinnamic acid, and allowed to dry. Mass measurements were performed on an orthogonal MALDI-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer, a prOTOF2000 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences/Sciex), within the m/z range from 500 to 10,000. External calibration on the monoisotopic masses of bradykinin fragment 2-9 (m/z 904.4681, Bachem) and pyro-E-neurotensin (m/z 1672.9175, Bachem) resulted in an average mass accuracy below 6.0 ppm for signals of the peptide ions observed. Peptide mass fingerprints were analyzed using Xproteo (www.xproteo.com). Multistage MS analysis (MS/MS and MS3) were performed subsequently on the same samples using a self-built MALDI-ion trap that consists of an LCQ DECA ion trap (ThermoElectron) with a customized ion source, essentially as described previously for an LCQ version (27Krutchinsky A.N. Kalkum M. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 5066-5077Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The machine was further improved by adding the capability to accommodate the sample plates from the prOTOF2000 and to operate at a higher source pressure (170 millitorr), which allowed us to perform measurements with 4-hydroxy-α-cyanocinnamic acid matrix. The fragmentation spectrum of the tryptic SmpB peptide ion at m/z 1250.67 (Fig. 5) was utilized as a characteristic signature to detect SmpB in hypothesis-driven multistage MS experiments in a fashion similar to that described for the detection of low-abundant peptides (28Kalkum M. Lyon G.J. Chait B.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2795-2800Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These experiments were necessary to test for the presence of SmpB in cases in which peptide mass fingerprints alone did not permit a conclusive identification. tmRNA Mutants—An aptamer affinity tag was inserted into the tmRNA molecule to allow the isolation of tmRNA·ribosome complexes by affinity chromatography. Earlier we demonstrated that the aptamer to streptavidin was very efficient for the isolation of ribosomes when inserted into 23S rRNA (29Leonov A.A. Sergiev P.V. Bogdanov A.A. Brimacombe R. Dontsova O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25664-25670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It is known that pk3 is absent in the tmRNAs from some eubacteria (2Zwieb C. Wower I. Wower J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2063-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and that substitution of this pseudoknot in E. coli tmRNA with a single-stranded structure element does not significantly affect the activity of tmRNA (30Nameki N. Tadaki T. Himeno H. Muto A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We substituted pk3 with the aptamer to streptavidin (Fig. 1). According to our model describing the passage of tmRNA through the ribosome (19Ivanov P.V. Zvereva M.I. Shpanchenko O.V. Dontsova O.A. Bogdanov A.A. Aglyamova G.V. Lim V.I. Teraoka Y. Nierhaus K.H. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) pk3 should be located on the surface of the ribosome. Insertion of the aptamer into the pk3 position made the resultant mutant tmRNA 41 nucleotides longer than the wild type. We used the resulting plasmid pGEM-stra to express mutant tmRNA-stra (a tmRNA containing a streptavidin tag and a wild-type mRNA module) under control of its native promoter and terminator. Mutant tmRNA remained active in the test system (20Williams K.P. Martindale K.A. Bartel D.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5423-5433Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The aptamer-tagged tmRNA mutants were designed in a way to block the translation of the coding region of tmRNA at specific positions during the termination of the trans-translation process. It is possible to block termination in the UGA stop codon recognized by RF2 if this release factor is inactive. The E. coli strain used in this study harbors a temperature-sensitive RF2 mutant that is active at 37 °C and significantly reduces activity at 42 °C (see “Experimental Procedures”). Wild-type tmRNA contains two UAA stop codons recognized by both release factors (RF1 and RF2). We mutated the first UAA stop codon to UGA in tmRNA-stra and changed the sequence around the stop codon (Fig. 1) to one known to be the “weakest termination signal” (31Bjornsson A. Mottagui-Tabar S. Isaksson L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1696-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To catch the complex at earlier stages of the passage of tmRNA through the ribosome we moved the UGA stop codon together with the weakest termination signal to the position of the fourth codon (pGEM-stra-4 expressing the mutant tmRNA-4) (Fig. 1, tmRNA-4). The presence of the UGA stop codon within the weakest termination context together with thermosensitive RF2 dramatically increased the probability of isolating the ribosome complexes containing mutant tmRNAs with the streptavidin tag affinity method. Confirming the System—As designed, the system contains two altered elements: 1) mutant tmRNA with streptavidin aptamer instead of pk3 and a UGA stop codon recognized by RF2 and 2) a thermosensitive RF2 to impair termination at UGA. In the first series of experiments we tested the activity of mutant tmRNAs to determine whether they could tag proteins for subsequent proteolysis. To test the activity of tmRNA mutants we applied the Williams system (20Williams K.P. Martindale K.A. Bartel D.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5423-5433Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), in which cells became resistant against kanamycin only in the presence of a functioning tmRNA upon IPTG induction of kanamycin resistance gene repressor. Fig. 2A, left panel, shows that all of the cells grew in the absence of IPTG and both mutants, tmRNA-4 and tmRNA-11, as well as without any tmRNA or the presence of wild-type tmRNA. However, only the cells lacking tmRNA were not viable in the presence of IPTG; the cells harboring wild-type or mutant tmRNA were alive (Fig. 2A, right panel). The results clearly show that the mutants tmRNA-4 and -11 retain the tagging function that provides the degradation, although in the case of tmRNA-4 the degradation is lower because of the reduced sequence of the tag peptide (32Flynn J.M. Levchenko I. Seidel M. Wickner S.H. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10584-10589Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In the second control experiment, we analyzed whether the SKZ1 strain producing temperature-sensitive RF2 supports the tmRNA tagging function. To this end we used a tmRNA with a streptavidin tag and an mRNA module that codes for His6 residues instead of the last six amino acids. The latter feature reduces degradation of the tagged proteins (33Roche E.D. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28509-28515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and thus allows identification of tagged proteins by commercially available anti-(His6) antibodies. This construct was introduced into cells lacking a functional tmRNA gene and containing either the wild-type RF2 (strain X91) or the thermosensitive RF2 (strain SKZ1). Fig. 2B demonstrates that the tagging pattern was very similar in both of the strains indicating normal activity of tmRNA in the SKZ1 strain. In the absence of any tmRNA, both strains showed the same background bands (34Mukherjee S. Shukla A. Guptasarma P. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 2003; 2: 183-186Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar) that cross-reacted with the anti-(His6) antibody. The RNA Content of tmRNA·Ribosome Complexes—RNA molecules were extracted from the isolated tmRNA·ribosome complexes and analyzed by gel electrophoresis as shown in Fig. 3A. The complex with tmRNA-4 blocked in the forth codon was obtained in good yield and found to contain tmRNA, 16 S, 23 S, and 5 S ribosomal RNAs (Fig. 3A, lane 3). Comparison of the 5 S rRNA, tmRNA, and tRNA bands densities from Fig. 3A, lane 3, indicated a molar ratio of ribosome to tmRNA of about 1:0.8 and that of tmRNA to tRNA of about 1:1. However, when tmRNA contained the affinity tag but a wild-type mRNA module (tmRNA-stra), almost no RNA could be observed (see the weak rRNA signals, Fig. 3A, lane 6). This indicates that the tmRNA-4-containing ribosomes are efficiently stalled with the stop codon in the A site and a tRNAPro in the P site (see Fig. 1). Similarly, ribosomes containing wild-type tmRNA could not be isolated because of the efficient mRNA module translation and termination in the natural stop codon (compare Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 6). Other controls including tmRNA-4 affinity isolated from the S30 (Fig. 3A, lane 2) and the initial fraction (after ribosome purification) and the flow-through (Fig. 3A, lanes 4 and 5, respectively) contain very small amounts of tmRNA, indicating the efficient enrichment of tmRNA·ribosome complex by the applied streptavidin tag method. A potential tmRNA·ribosome complex stalled in the initiation stage unable to translate the mRNA module should be the same in the presence of both tmRNA-4 and tmRNA-stra. The fact that we do not observe a tmRNA band in lane 6 (Fig. 3A) indicates that such a potential complex is negligible in the isolated tmRNA·ribosome complex. Scanning the tmRNA bands of Fig. 3A, lanes 2, 4, and 3 (total tmRNA-4 in the S 30 cell-free extract, the tmRNA complexed with the ribosome in the initial ribosomal fraction, and tmRNA in the isolated complex, respectively) and considering the fraction volume applied to the gel revealed that at least 80% of tmRNA from the initial ribosomal fraction or 4% from total (S30 fraction) was bound to the ribosome in the isolated complex. According to the nucleotide sequence of mutant tmRNAs (tmRNA-11 and tmRNA-4 in Fig. 1) the UGA stop codon should occupy the A site, and the CCA Pro codon should be in the P site. Therefore the tRNA bound to the P site of the ribosome should correspond to tRNAPro. To test this we probed the tRNA in the ribosome·tmRNA complex using Northern blot analysis with DIG-labeled DNA specific to tRNAPro. The results of the Northern blot for tRNA from the complexes blocked at either the 4th or the 11th codon are shown in Fig. 3B. The signal clearly demonstrates the presence of tRNAPro in the complex. Rough estimation of the tRNAPro amount was done by comparing the dot-blot signal intensities for tRNAPro from the tmRNA-4 complex with known amounts of T7 tRNAPro transcript (Fig. 3C). This approach did not allow us to make a quantitative estimation but indicated that most of tRNA in that complex was tRNAPro. Analysis of the Protein Content of tmRNA·Ribosome Complexes—The proteins in the purified complexes containing tmRNA-4 and tmRNA-11 were separated by gel electrophoresis as shown in Fig. 4, A, lane 3, and B, lane 3, respectively). Ribosomal proteins of the 30 S (Fig. 4A, lane TP30) and 50 S subunits (Fig. 4B, lane TP50) served as markers. We used the following controls: (i) proteins from the initial ribosomal fractions of the complexes with tmRNA-4 and tmRNA-11 (lanes 1 in Fig. 4, A and B, respectively) and (ii) proteins derived from flow-through fractions (lanes 2 in Fig. 4, A and B). In the case of wild-type tmRNA no ribosomes were bound to the resin with the exception of at least three proteins from cell extract that were bound to the streptavidin resin. The corresponding bands are marked with asterisks at lanes 3 in Fig. 4, A-C. Lanes 3 in Fig. 4, A-C, represent the analysis of protein content of the isolated complexes. The protein spectra in Fig. 4, A and B, show that complexes purified via tmRNA-4 and tmRNA-11 contain ribosomal proteins. The bands with the mobility corresponding to elongation factors G, Tu, and Ts (marked by arrows in lane 1 of Fig. 4, A and B) disappear from the blocked complexes (lane 3 in both panels). An additional protein band (18-19 kDa) appears in Fig. 4, A and B, lane 3, for the blocked complexes (best seen in B, used for MALDI analysis as described below) that could not be seen in the lanes for the other ribosomal fractions. The mobility of the new band corresponds to SmpB. In contrast, almost no ribosomal protein can be seen in the corresponding lane 3 in Fig. 4C, indicating that no tmRNA·ribosome complex can be isolated from the cell in the case of tmRNA-stra with a wild-type termination signal. The protein band with the mobility of SmpB (Fig. 4, A and B, lanes 3) was cut out and subjecte"
https://openalex.org/W2079456519,"Considering all small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) enriched in the nucleolus, we generated a specialized cDNA library of small nuclear RNAs from Schizosaccharomyces pombe and isolated, for the first time, 20 novel box H/ACA snoRNAs. Thirteen of these were characterized as novel guides that were predicted to direct 19 pseudouridylations in 18 S and 25 S rRNAs. The remaining seven snoRNAs were considered as orphan guides that lack sequence complementarity to either rRNAs or snRNAs. We have experimentally demonstrated the function of the 10 novel snoRNAs by gene deletion in the fission yeast. The snoRNAs were shown to be dispensable for the viability of S. pombe, although an impact of snR94 depletion on yeast growth, especially at 23 °C, was revealed. A total of 30 pseudouridylation sites were precisely mapped in the S. pombe rRNAs, showing a distinctive pseudouridylation pattern in the budding yeast. Interestingly, the absence of pseudouridylation on U2347 in S. pombe 25 S rRNA pointed out a critical role for Ψ2345 in conferring a growth advantage for yeast. In contrast to the intron-encoded box C/D sno-RNAs in yeast, all box H/ACA snoRNAs appeared to be transcribed independently from intergenic regions between two protein-coding genes, except for snR35, which was nested in an open reading frame encoding for a hypothetical protein, although expressed from the opposite strand. Remarkably, snR90 was cotranscribed with an intron-encoded box C/D snoRNA, and this is the first demonstration of a non-coding RNA gene that encodes two different types of snoRNAs by its exon and intron. A detailed comparison of the S. pombe snoRNAs, with their functional homologues in diverse organisms, suggests a mechanism by which the snoRNAs have evolved in coordination with rRNAs to preserve the post-transcriptional modification sites among distant eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W2083974890,"CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT) is a multi-domain enzyme that regulates phosphatidylcholine synthesis. It converts to an active form upon binding cell membranes, and interdomain dissociations have been hypothesized to accompany this process. To identify these interdomain and membrane interactions, the tertiary structures of three forms of CCTα were probed by monitoring accessibility to proteases. Time-limited digestion with chymotrypsin or arginine C of soluble CCTα (CCTsol), phospholipid vesicle-bound CCT (CCTmem), and a soluble constitutively active CCT truncated at amino acid 236 generated complex mixtures of peptides that were resolved and identified by gel electrophoresis/immunoblotting and by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry, with or without coupling to capillary liquid chromatography. Identification of cleavage sites enabled assembly of peptide bond accessibility maps for each CCT form. Our results reveal a ∼80-residue core within the catalytic domain (domain C) as the most inaccessible region in all three forms and the C-terminal phosphorylation domain as the most accessible. Membrane binding has little effect on the protease accessibility of these domains. To map the protease sites onto the catalytic domain, its three-dimensional structure was modeled from the atomic coordinates of glycerol-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (Protein Data Bank code 1COZ). The protease inaccessibility of most sites in domain C could be explained by burial or location within secondary structural elements. The accessibility of the N-terminal domain (domain N) was enhanced upon membrane binding. Residues Phe234-Leu303 were inaccessible in CCTmem, suggesting burial in the membrane. Surprisingly, residues Leu274-Leu303 of this domain were also inaccessible in CCTsol. We propose that this region is buried by interdomain contacts with domain N in CCTsol. Membrane binding and burial of domain M in the lipid bilayer may disrupt this interaction, leading to increased exposure of sites in domain N."
https://openalex.org/W2096968356,"Linker histone H1 is the major factor that stabilizes higher order chromatin structure and modulates the action of chromatin-remodeling enzymes. We have previously shown that parathymosin, an acidic, nuclear protein binds to histone H1 in vitro and in vivo. Confocal laser scanning microscopy reveals a nuclear punctuate staining of the endogenous protein in interphase cells, which is excluded from dense heterochromatic regions. Using an in vitro chromatin reconstitution system under physiological conditions, we show here that parathymosin (ParaT) inhibits the binding of H1 to chromatin in a dose-dependent manner. Consistent with these findings, H1-containing chromatin assembled in the presence of ParaT has reduced nucleosome spacing. These observations suggest that interaction of the two proteins might result in a conformational change of H1. Fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism-based measurements on mixtures of H1 and ParaT confirm this hypothesis. Human sperm nuclei challenged with ParaT become highly decondensed, whereas overexpression of green fluorescent protein- or FLAG-tagged protein in HeLa cells induces global chromatin decondensation and increases the accessibility of chromatin to micrococcal nuclease digestion. Our data suggest a role of parathymosin in the remodeling of higher order chromatin structure through modulation of H1 interaction with nucleosomes and point to its involvement in chromatin-dependent functions.

Eukaryotic DNA is packaged into chromatin (1van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer Verlag, New York1988Google Scholar), a structural framework that plays a key role in the regulation of the transcriptional status of genes and genetic loci (2Fedor M.J. Curr. Opin.

Science. 2000; 289: 2290-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The basic level of chromatin organization is the nucleosome that consists of DNA wrapped around an octamer of histones (5Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6795) Google Scholar). Linker histones (e.g. H1 and H5) seal the entry/exit of DNA and stabilize the folding of 10-nm nucleosomal arrays into higher order chromatin structures (6van Holde K. Zlatanova J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10548-10555Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 7Carruthers L.M. Bednar J. Woodcock C.L. Hansen J.C.

Biol. 1995; 252: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), restricts their mobility (9Pennings S. Meersseman G. Bradbury E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10275-10279Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and reduces the transient exposure of DNA on the nucleosome surface (10Juan L.J. Utley R.T. Vignali M. Bohm L. Workman J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3635-3640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Consistent with its structural role as a major determinant of chromatin folding, histone H1 was found to inhibit the action of enzymes that enhance the accessibility of DNA, such as histone acetyltransferases and ATP-dependent remodeling complexes. For example, changes in linker histone stoichiometry modulate the levels of core histone acetylation (11Gunjan A. Sittman D.B. Brown D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3635-3640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and regulate the activity of all classes of ATP-dependent remodeling enzymes (12Hill D.A. Imbalzano A.N.

Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Collectively, these findings support the notion that H1 “locks down” chromatin regions and acts as a general inhibitor of transcription (14Thomas J.O. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 312-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 15Zlatanova J. Caiafa P. Van Holde K. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1697-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, genetic studies have shown that, rather than being global repressors of transcription, linker histones affect the expression of specific genes (16Shen X. Gorovsky M.A. Cell. 1996; 86: 475-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Multiple isoforms of linker histone H1 exist in mammalian somatic cells (17Doenecke D. Albig W. Bode C. Drabent B. Franke K. Gavenis K. Witt O. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 107: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and play differential roles in gene expression (18Alami R. Fan Y. Pack S. Sonbuchner T.M. Besse A. Lin Q. Greally J.M. Skoultchi A.I. Bouhassira E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5920-5925Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Recently, two independent studies highlight the important role of H1 subtypes in development and apoptosis. H1b, a specific subtype of H1, which is expressed in undifferentiated cells, specifically represses the expression of MyoD gene, and thus restricts muscle development (19Lee H. Habas R. Abate-Shen C. Science. 2004; 304: 1675-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in response to DNA double-strand breaks, only H1.2 (H1c) translocates from the nucleus into the cytoplasm and triggers the onset of apoptosis through the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (20Konishi A. Shimizu S. Hirota J. Takao T. Fan Y. Matsuoka Y. Zhang L. Yoneda Y. Fujii Y. Skoultchi A.I. Tsujimoto Y. Cell. 2003; 114: 673-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar).Collectively, the properties of linker histone H1 suggest that local H1 displacement and/or rearrangement must occur for efficient re-organization of chromatin during several DNA-dependent processes. Therefore, the roles of specific H1-protein interactions appear to be important for H1 function and chromatin structure. We have previously reported a specific in vitro and in vivo interaction between parathymosin (ParaT) 1The abbreviations used are: ParaT, parathymosin; CMV, cytomegalovirus; GFP, green fluorescent protein; TAF, template-activating factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TRITC, tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate; CD, circular dichroism; NRL, nucleosome repeat length. 1The abbreviations used are: ParaT, parathymosin; CMV, cytomegalovirus; GFP, green fluorescent protein; TAF, template-activating factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TRITC, tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate; CD, circular dichroism; NRL, nucleosome repeat length. and histone H1 (21Kondili K. Tsolas O. Papamarcaki T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). ParaT is expressed in all cell types (22Clinton M. Frangou-Lazaridis M. Panneerselvam C. Horecker B.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 269: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and is widely distributed in mammalian tissues with the highest concentrations found in liver, heart, and kidney (23Frangou-Lazaridis M. Clinton M. Goodall G.J. Horecker B.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 263: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It contains a functionally active bipartite nuclear localization signal and is actively translocated into the nuclei of undifferentiated cells (24Trompeter H.I. Blankenburg G. Brugger B. Menne J. Schiermeyer A. Scholz M. Soling H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1187-1193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Inspection of the amino acid sequence of ParaT (101 amino acids, pI 4.15) reveals that it is predominantly composed of hydrophilic amino acids, typically found on protein surfaces. Aromatic, sulfur, histidine, isoleucine, and leucine amino acids are totally absent, whereas the central region of the protein contains runs of aspartic and glutamic acid residues, occasionally interspersed with glycine, alanine, threonine, and asparagine (25Clinton M. Frangou-Lazaridis M. Panneerselvam C. Horecker B.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 158: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This unusual sequence shares significant similarity with the amino acid composition of prothymosin α, a histone H1-binding protein associated with cell proliferation, chromatin remodeling, and gene transcription (26Karetsou Z.

Early studies have identified ParaT as a zinc-binding protein, which interacts with several enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism (30Brand I.A. Heinickel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20984-20989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Trompeter H.I. Brand I.A. Soling H.D. FEBS Lett. 1989; 253: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Recently, ParaT was found to inhibit the binding of the activated glucocorticoid receptor to nuclei, suggesting its involvement in the regulation of glucocorticoid steroids action (32Okamoto K. Isohashi F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).In the present study we analyzed the effect of ParaT on the interaction of histone H1 with chromatin using an in vitro chromatin reconstitution system on plasmid and bead-immobilized DNA. We also monitored the binding of H1 and ParaT by circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy to detect potential changes of H1 conformation in the presence of ParaT. Furthermore, we studied the potential involvement of this acidic polypeptide in chromatin decondensation. Our results indicate that ParaT modulates the interaction of histone H1 with chromatin and induces global chromatin decondensation.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmids—To generate pCMVParaT the coding region of the rat ParaT cDNA (23Frangou-Lazaridis M. Clinton M. Goodall G.J. Horecker B.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 263: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) was amplified and subcloned into the EcoRI-XhoI sites of a CMV expression cassette p163/7, where the H2 promoter was exchanged with the CMV promoter. For pFLAG-ParaT, the coding region of ParaT was amplified and subcloned into the EcoRI-SalI sites of pFLAG-CMV2 vector (Eastman Kodak Co.). To generate pGST-ParaT, the coding region of the protein was removed from pFLAG-ParaT and cloned into the EcoRI-SmaI sites of pGEX-6P3 (Amersham Biosciences). GFP-ParaT was made by inserting ParaT gene into EcoRI-SmaI cleavage sites of pEGFP-C1 expression vector (Clontech). pFLAG-TAF-Iβ was a gift from Dr. D. C. Tkachuk (VA Puget Sound Health Care System, Seattle, WA). To generate pGFP-TAF-Iβ, the TAF-Iβ gene was cloned into the EcoRI-SalI sites of pEFGP-C3 vector (Clontech). All constructs have been verified by sequencing.Proteins—ParaT was purified from goat liver by a new method; freshly excised tissue was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. Frozen tissue, 60 g, was pulverized in liquid nitrogen and immediately added to 300 ml of boiling water. The suspension was cooled, homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 25 min. The supernatant was adjusted to pH 5.0 with 1.0 m of acetic acid and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 25 min. The new supernatant was concentrated to 12 ml and dialyzed over buffer A (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA). The sample was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with DE-52 beads (Whatman) pre-equilibrated with the same buffer and poured into a column. The column was washed with 0.1 m NaCl, and bound proteins were eluted with a linear salt gradient of 0.1–0.7 m NaCl in buffer A. The fractions were checked by SDS-PAGE, and those containing ParaT were pooled, dialyzed over buffer B (20 mm histidine, pH 5.9, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA), and applied over a Q-Sepharose column previously equilibrated with buffer B. The column was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1.0 m NaCl in buffer B. ParaT fractions were pooled and filtered through a Sep-Pak cartridge (Waters Associates Inc.). The filter was washed three times with ddH2O, and ParaT was eluted with 20% isopropanol in ddH2O. The purity of the ParaT fractions was checked by 15% SDS-PAGE. ParaT concentration was determined by bicinchoninic acid protein determination kit (Pierce). This method yields ∼10 μg of pure ParaT/g tissue.Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-ParaT was expressed in BL21 cells and purified from lysates according to standard procedures (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The binding of recombinant ParaT to H1 was checked by GST-pull-down assays at 500 mm salt concentration. To remove the GST moiety, GST-ParaT was immobilized on glutathione beads and digested with the PreScission Protease (Amersham Biosciences), 2 units of enzyme/100 μg of bound GST-ParaT in 20 μl of cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) at 4 °C for 12 h.Peptide P1 (residues 5–30) was synthesized at Hoffmann-La Roche, Nutley, NJ, according to the published sequence of rat ParaT (34Haritos A.A. Salvin S.B. Blacher R. Stein S. Horecker B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1050-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and used as an antigen for antibody production. Histone H1 from calf thymus (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was phosphorylated with protein kinase C in the presence of 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 50 μm ATP, 0.2% BSA, 1% phospholipids, for 30 min at 37 °C.Chromatin Reconstitution—Chromatin assembly extract was prepared from Drosophila early embryos (35Becker P.B. Tsukiyama T. Wu C. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 44: 207-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Plasmid immobilization on paramagnetic beads and chromatin assembly reactions were performed as described previously (36Sandaltzopoulos R. Blank T. Becker P.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To incorporate H1 into chromatin, 2 units of H1 was mixed with assembly extract prior to the addition of DNA beads. Chromatin was assembled for 6 h at 25 °C, and beads were concentrated in a magnetic field. Immobilized chromatin was washed with 650 mm NaCl to strip bound H1, then three times with 100 mm NaCl, and finally equilibrated in the binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.02% BSA, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.4). Then, histone H1-containing traces of 32P-labeled H1 were added to the binding buffer (15-μl total volume) in the presence or absence of ParaT and incubated with the chromatin beads for 30 min at 25 °C. One unit of H1 is defined as the amount needed to increase the repeat length of chromatin from 170 to 190 bp (36Sandaltzopoulos R. Blank T. Becker P.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).Cell Culture and Transient Transfections—HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. For transient transfections, HeLa cells were grown in 10-cm dishes to 50–60% confluency and transfected with 15–20 μg of DNA using the calcium phosphate method. pFLAG or pFLAG-ParaT-transfected cells were detected through cotransfection of 2–3 μg of pGFP vector. For micrococcal nuclease experiments the calcium method was modified as follows: Cells were transfected with 16 μg of DNA containing 1.5 μg of pPUR (Clontech), a plasmid that confers resistance to puromycin. After 6 h the medium was changed and cells were grown for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.25 μg/ml puromycin. The transfection efficiency ranged from 75 to 90%.Indirect Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—A polyclonal antibody recognizing the NH2 terminus of ParaT (peptide P1, residues 5–30) was raised in rabbits (Davids Biotechnology, Germany), and the serum was purified over P1-agarose affinity column. HeLa cells grown on coverslips were fixed with methanol at –20 °C for 5 min, followed by incubation in 3.8% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature and quenched in 50 mm ammonium chloride for 15 min. Nonspecific sites were blocked with 10% fetal calf serum in PBS, and antibody incubations were carried out for 1 h in a humidified chamber. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in 10% fetal calf serum. Fluorescein isothiocyanate- or TRITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies were purchased from Dianova and used at 1:200 dilution. Coverslips were mounted in Mowiol containing 100 mg/ml 1,4-diazabicylo[2.2.2]octane (Sigma) and viewed using a Leica TCS-SP scanning confocal microscope, equipped with an argon/krypton laser and Leica TCS software. The 488 and 568 nm wavelengths were used to excite fluorescein isothiocyanate and TRITC, respectively. Images were exported to Adobe Photoshop.Chromatin Fractionation—Isolation of S1, S2, and P chromatin fractions from HeLa nuclei was performed according to the method of Rose and Garrard (37Rose S.M. Garrard W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8534-8544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, HeLa cells were transfected with GFP vector or GFP-ParaT and incubated in hypotonic buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP) on ice for 15 min. After incubation, cell lysates were centrifuged at 3000 × g. The nuclear fraction was resuspended in 200 μl of buffer B (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 0.3 mm sucrose, 2 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl), and DNA content was determined in 2 m NaCl. Nuclei suspension (100 μl) containing 100 μg of DNA was incubated with 8 units of micrococcal nuclease for 10 min at 15 °C and cooled on ice for 10 min. The mixture was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 5 min and 10 μl of 10× stop buffer (20 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 5% SDS) were added to the supernatant (S1 fraction). The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of 8 mm EDTA for 15 min at 4 °C and centrifuged as above. The supernatant and the pellet were designated as S2 and P fractions, respectively. For DNA analysis, S1, S2, and P fractions were treated with 1 μg/μl RNase for 10 min at 25 °C and deproteinized with 1 μg/μl proteinase K for 2 h at 37 °C. DNA was phenol-chloroform purified, ethanol-precipitated, and analyzed on 1.3% agarose gels and ethidium bromide staining.Sperm Chromatin Decondensation Assays—Human semen was obtained from a healthy fertile donor and was provided by the Reproduction Unit of the University Hospital of Ioannina. Sperm was kept frozen at –80 °C until use. Demembraned human sperm nuclei were prepared as described (38Matsumoto K. Nagata K. Miyaji-Yamaguchi M. Kikuchi A. Tsujimoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6940-6952Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and incubated with 6 μg of protein at room temperature in 10 μl of reaction mixture containing 8 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 8 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 200 mm sucrose, and an ATP-regeneration system. After the incubation, 1 μl of the reaction mixture was added to 1 μl of PBS containing 50% glycerol, 7.4% formaldehyde, and 5 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 on a glass slide. The DNA stained with the dye was visualized under a fluorescence microscope, and the surface area of the nuclei was measured with the AutoCAD 2000 software.Measurement of Nuclear Surface—Sperm or HeLa cell nuclei were stained with 2.5 ng/ml Hoechst and observed under a fluorescence microscope. Immunofluorescence images were imported as TIFF files to the AutoCAD software. The perimeter of the nuclei and the surface area were measured using the spline command of the program. Spline fits a smooth curve to sequence of points within a specified tolerance. AutoCAD uses NURBS (nonuniform rational B-splines) mathematics, which stores and defines a class of curve and surface data.Fluorescence Spectroscopy Binding Assays—H1-ParaT binding was followed by monitoring the intensity of the fluorescence emitted by the single tyrosine residue of H1. A Hitachi F-2500 fluorescence spectrophotometer, fitted with a thermostatically controlled jacketed cell holder and interfaced with a Neslab RTE-111 water-bath was used. Fluorescence emission spectra in the range 280–360 nm were recorded with an excitation wavelength of 276 nm. Purified H1 from calf thymus at an initial concentration of 15 μm was titrated with increasing amounts of a 270 μm recombinant ParaT stock solution in PBS buffer. All measurements were performed at 25 °C. After each ligand addition, the samples were left to equilibrate for 5 min before the equilibrium fluorescence readings were recorded (H1 fluorescence is quenched upon ParaT binding). The dissociation constant (Kd) for the complex was estimated by non-linear regression analysis (KaleidaGraph, Synergy Software) relating the change in H1 fluorescence intensity at 306 nm (corrected for buffer contribution and for dilution) to the total added ParaT concentration through Equation 1, F=(F0+Fmax[L]/Kd)/(1+[L]/Kd)eq.1 where F, Fo, and Fmax are the fluorescence intensities measured at each titration point, at zero ligand concentration and at saturation, respectively, and [L] is the concentration of free ligand calculated by solving the quadratic equation, [L]2+[L]([P]0−[L]0+Kd)−Kd[L]0=0eq.2 where [P]o and [L]o are the protein and total ligand concentrations added, respectively. The titration was repeated twice, and the R2 values were above 0.987.Circular Dichroism Binding Assays—Circular dichroism spectra in the Far UV range were recorded on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter interfaced with a Peltier element for temperature control. The instrument was calibrated with a 0.1% aqueous solution of d-10-camphor sulfonic acid. Solutions of the proteins used in the fluorescence experiment were in PBS buffer, and their concentration ranged from 6 to 25 μm. Far-UV CD spectra were recorded at 25 °C, with 0.2 nm resolution, averaged over five scans, and the baseline was corrected by subtraction of the buffer spectrum at the same temperature. Quartz single-chamber cells with path lengths of 0.1 or 0.2 cm and a double-chamber cuvette with a path length of 0.4375 cm for each chamber were used (Hellma). In the latter case, a 6 μm solution of H1 in PBS was placed in one chamber and an equimolar solution of ParaT in the second, and far-UV CD spectra were recorded, corresponding to the sum of spectra of the two components. Subsequently, the contents of the two chambers were mixed and another CD spectrum was recorded. This spectrum corresponds to the mixture of the two proteins.RESULTSParaT Is Localized in Distinct Nuclear Foci—Previous work has shown that ParaT is a nuclear protein associated with early replication domains, suggesting a role of this acidic polypeptide in active chromatin (39Vareli K. Frangou-Lazaridis M. van der Kraan I. Tsolas O. van Driel R. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 257: 152-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Confocal laser scanning microscopy using affinity-purified antibodies against the NH2-terminal region of ParaT revealed a nuclear punctuate staining of the endogenous protein in interphase cells (Fig. 1B, panel a). Interestingly, judging from the overlay of ParaT staining with propidium iodide (PI) that mainly decorates heterochromatin, ParaT foci were found to be scattered throughout the nucleoplasm and totally excluded from dense heterochromatic regions (panel a, merge). During prophase, where extended interphase chromatin slowly condenses into well defined chromosomes, ParaT was detected in distinct foci mainly localized in the vicinity of chromosomes (Fig. 1B, panel b). In late mitotic phases ParaT speckles were concentrated around the condensed chromosomes (Fig. 1B, panel c). These data suggest that ParaT is mainly associated with euchromatic nucleosomal sites rather than with condensed heterochromatic regions.ParaT Modulates the Binding of H1 to Chromatin—Our previous work has shown a specific interaction between ParaT and linker histone H1 (21Kondili K. Tsolas O. Papamarcaki T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). More specifically, in vitro binding assays under native conditions detected contacts between ParaT and the globular domain of H1 (21Kondili K. Tsolas O. Papamarcaki T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), a central folded region of H1 that binds four-way junction DNA (40Varga-Weisz P. Zlatanova J. Leuba S.H. Schroth G.P. van Holde K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3525-3529Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and protects an additional 20 bp from micrococcal nuclease digestion (6van Holde K. Zlatanova J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1998; 95: 3396-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Taking into account these results, we hypothesized that ParaT might modulate the binding of H1 to chromatin. Previous studies have shown a relationship between nucleosome spacing and H1 binding to nucleosomes (8Blank T.A. Becker P.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Based on this, we first studied the effect of ParaT on the interaction of H1 with chromatin by visualizing the changes in nucleosome repeat length (NRL). Our analysis was based on a chromatin reconstitution system using extracts derived from Drosophila early embryos (35Becker P.B. Tsukiyama T. Wu C. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 44: 207-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Incorporation of H1 into nucleosomes in the absence of ParaT increased the NRL from 170 to 205 bp (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2), as expected (8Blank T.A. Becker P.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, when ParaT was added in the assembly reaction with H1, the NRL increased only to 195 bp (lane 3). These data support the conclusion that the H1 on the template is altered and/or bound by ParaT, such that the repeat length is changed.Fig. 2The effect of ParaT on the interaction of histone H1 with chromatin.A, NRL changes. Plasmid DNA was assembled into chromatin with Drosophila extracts without H1 (lane 1) or with 2 units of histone H1 (lanes 2 and 3) in the absence (lane 2) or presence of 6 μg of ParaT (lane 3). Reconstituted chromatin was digested with micrococcal nuclease for 30 s or 1 min. Purified DNA was analyzed on a 1.3% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. White circles mark the pentanucleosome-derived DNA, visualizing the change in NRL. M, 123-bp ladder (Invitrogen). B, ParaT inhibits the binding of H1 to chromatin. Chromatin with free H1 binding sites was reconstituted on immobilized DNA and then incubated with 4 units of calf histone H1 and traces of 32P-phosphorylated H1, in the absence (C) or in the presence of ParaT (H1/ParaT ratios 1:2, 1:5 w/w). Supernatants were removed, and the beads were washed three times with the binding buffer. Supernatant (S), the last wash (W), and the beads (B) were analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with silver. Numbers on the left indicate the molecular masses in kDa. C, quantitation of the ParaT effect on H1 binding to chromatin. The autoradiography of the gel shown in B was subjected to densitometry to quantitate the incorporation of H1 to nucleosomes in the presence of ParaT.

A central mediator controlling PAI-1 is transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), which induces its expression and promotes fibrosis. We have found that a unique member of the Smad family of signal transduction molecules, Smad6s, modulates the expression of PAI-1. Overexpression of Smad6s in endothelial cells increases promoter activity and PAI-1 secretion, and an antisense to Smad6s suppresses the induction of PAI-1 by TGF-β. The effect of Smad6s on the PAI-1 promoter appeared to be the result of increase binding of the forkhead winged helix factor FoxD1 to a TGF-β-responsive element. Furthermore, the effect of Smad6s on PAI-1 up-regulation and on FoxD1 binding was found to result from up-regulation of TGF-β and could be inhibited by the blocking TGF-β signaling with Smad7. The ability of Smad6s to regulate the TGF-β promoter and subsequent PAI-1 induction was suppressed by a selective protein kinase C-β (PKC-β) inhibitor. Consistent with the in vitro data, we found that increased Smad6s in diseased vessels correlated with increased TGF-β and PAI-1 levels. Overall, our results demonstrate that the level of Smad6s can alter the level of TGF-β and the subsequent induction of PAI-1 via a FoxD1 transcription site. Furthermore, our data suggest that this process, which is up-regulated in diseased vessels, can be modulated by the inhibition of PKC-β.

Vascular injury plays a major role in the pathogenesis of multiple acute and chronic disorders. The response to initial injury triggers activation of coagulation, inflammatory and repair processes aimed at maintaining vascular integrity; however, an imbalance in this process can ultimately lead to aberrant fibrosis, structural dysfunction, and ultimately chronic disease. While many factors play a role in the continuum from acute injury to chronic dysfunctional vasculature, the serpin plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), 1The abbreviations used are: PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; BMP, bone morphogenic protein; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PKC, protein kinase C.1The abbreviations used are: PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; BMP, bone morphogenic protein; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PKC, protein kinase C. has been shown to play a key role in the pathogenesis of both acute and chronic disorders, including cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, and pulmonary (reviewed in Refs. 1Fay W.P.

As the physiologic inhibitor of tissue-type plasminogen activator, PAI-1 regulates the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin and thus plays a critical role in regulating the balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis. In general, the plasminogen activator/plasmin pathway has been implicated in a wide variety of physiologic and pathologic processes that require tissue remodeling and cell motility (5Allan E.H. Martin T.J. Clin. Orthop. Relat. Res. 1995; 313: 54-63PubMed Google Scholar). As such, PAI-1 influences a number of cellular processes (including wound repair, cell migration, angiogenesis, neointima formation, and matrix-dependent cell attachment) largely via interactions with urokinase plasminogen activator receptor, vitronectin, and indirectly through plasmin activation of extracellular matrix proteases and latent growth factors (reviewed in Ref. 6Loskutoff D.J. Circulation. 1997; 96: 2772-2774PubMed Google Scholar). While an important component in response to injury, chronically elevated plasma PAI-1 has been shown in increase risk for thrombosis, cancer metastasis, vascular complications of diabetes, and the development of septic shock (7Margaglione M.

Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 1563-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), a major factor controlling PAI-1 synthesis is transforming growth factor-β (TFG-β). Both TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 have been shown to up-regulate PAI-1 in cultured human endothelial cells at the promoter level (11Lux A. Attisano L. Marchuk D.A. J. Biol.

Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. J. Heart Lung Transplant. 2002; 21: 999-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) have shown that endothelial PAI-1 up-regulation in human aortic allografts is mediated mainly by the TGF-β pathway. TGF-β family signaling is positively modulated by various members of the Smad family of signal transduction proteins (reviewed in Refs. 16Attisano L. Wrana J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar and 17Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), however, two Smads (Smad6 and 7) inhibit TGF-β signal transduction. The Smad7 protein has been extensively studied and shown to prevent phosphorylation of receptor-activated Smads, thereby inhibiting TGF-β-induced signaling responses (18Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y.

However, an endothelial splice variant of Smad6, designated Smad6s, recently has been shown to have differential activity relative to the inhibitory Smad6 and Smad7 in a Xenopus model, being an antagonist of the BMP pathway but an agonist of the activin pathways (23Krishnan P. King M.W. Neff A.W. Sandusky G.E. Bierman K.L. Grinnell B.W. Smith R.C. Dev. Growth Differ. 2001; 43: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and showing enhanced modulation of TGF-β signaling in human endothelial cells (24Sandusky G. Berg D.T.

In this study, we have explored the role of TGF-β signaling in controlling the expression of PAI-1 in human endothelial cells, focusing on the role of the endothelial Smad6s. Using overexpression and antisense modulation, we show that Smad6s stimulates the expression and secretion of PAI-1 by enhancing the binding of nuclear factor FoxD1 to a previously identified TGF-β-responsive element in the promoter. Moreover, we demonstrate the up-regulation of PAI-1 synthesis by Smad6s depends on an induction of TGF-β itself and that this process can be effectively modulated by a selective PKC-β inhibitor. Furthermore, we show that in human diseased vessels overexpressing Smad6s, both TGF-β1 and PAI-1 are overexpressed, consistent with the up-regulation observed in vitro. Reagents and Cell Culture—TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 were purchased from R&D Systems. SVHA-1 cells, an SV40-transformed human aortic endothelial cell line, were described previously (24Sandusky G. Berg D.T.

Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were obtained from Clonetics (San Diego, CA). The ECV304 cell line was obtained from the (ATCC CRL-1998) and grown as described previously (25Richardson M.A. Berg D.T. Calnek D.S. Ciaccia A.V. Joyce D.E. Grinnell B.W.

Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (3:1), a medium comprised of a 3:1 v/v mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's nutrient mixture F-12. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (3:1) and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Invitrogen. The basal medium was supplemented with 10 nm selenium, 50 μm, 2 aminoethanol, 20 mm HEPES, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, and 5% fetal bovine serum. The PKC inhibitor LY379196 was from Eli Lilly and Co. All other reagents were of the highest quality available. DNA Transfection, Chloramphenicol Acetyltransferace (CAT) ELISA, Luciferase, and PAI-1 Assays—The vector pOCAT2336 containing the PAI-I promoter and the Smad6s and Smad7 expression vectors were described previously (23Krishnan P.

The TGF-β-responsive artificial PAI-1 reporter plasmid p3TP-lux was originally cloned by Dr. J. Massague's laboratory (26Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). Endothelial cells were seeded in 6-well plates to 80% confluence. DNA was transfected at a concentration of 1 μg for pOCAT2336 and p3TP-lux and 5 μg for the Smad vectors with Invitrogen's Lipofectin reagent used accordingly to manufacturer's instructions. Expressed CAT protein was measured using a CAT ELISA kit from Roche Applied Science and performed according to manufacturer's protocol. The plates were read kinetically and data expressed in millioptical density units/min. The activity of firefly luciferase was measured by a Dynax microtiter plate luminometer. PAI-1 antigen concentration in the conditioned medium was measured by a TintElise kit (Biopool International) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Antisense Oligodeoxynucleotides—The oligonucleotides used in antisense experiments were synthesized with phosphorothioates and C-5 propyne pyrimidines following standard protocols (27Wagner R.W. Matteucci M.D. Lewis J.G. Gutierrez A.J. Moulds C. Froehler B.C. Science. 1993; 260: 1510-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (oligos) were designed to hybridize to the region of the Smad6s mRNA encompassing the initial ATG. The sequence of the antisense oligodeoxynucleotide for Smad6s was 5′-GGTTTGCCCATTCTGGACAT-3′, and the sense strand control was 5′-ATGTCCAGAATGGGCAAACC-3′. Oligos were introduced to cells following the procedure as outlined by Sandusky et al. (24Sandusky G. Berg D.T. Richardson M.A. Myers L. Grinnell B.W. J. Biol.

After 4 days each experimental condition was treated with or without TGF-β at a concentration of 1 ng/ml in the maintenance medium. The antisense was shown to inhibit the Smad protein levels by Western blot analysis. TFG-β Promoter Activation and Secretion—TGF-β3 (28Lafyatis R. Lechleider R. Kim S.J. Jakowlew S. Roberts A.B.

Lysates were normalized using a BCA assay measuring total protein concentration. In some experiments, either 1 nm staurosporin or 100 nm LY379196 was added to the culture 24 h post-transfection. DNA Binding Assay—Bioinformatic analysis of the promoter region of PAI-1 was performed using MatInspector release 6.2.1. The gene locus for human PAI-1 was HSPAI11, GenBank™ accession number X13323. The match to FoxD1 was 1.0 to the core sequence with an re-value of less than 0.01 matches per 1000 bp. Confirmation of the binding was performed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays as follows. The probe was γ-32P-labeled (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (30Grinnell B.W. Berg D.T. Walls J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3596-3605Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Reactions containing Buffer D, poly(dI-dC), nuclear extract, and labeled oligonucleotide were incubated 15–45 min as described previously (31Reifel-Miller A.E. Berg D.T. Grinnell B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13873-13882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were run 90 min at 110 V, 2.0 A in 1/2× TBE running buffer (TBE: 0.1 m Tris (pH 7.2), 0.09 m boric acid, 0.001 m EDTA). Gels were dried on DE81 paper and developed overnight on Kodak film (Eastman Kodak Co.), and quantification was done using a scanning phosphoimager. In some experiments, detection was done using fluorescent-labeled oligonucleotides obtained from LI-COR Biosciences (Lincoln, NE) 5′-end-labeled with IRDye 800 phosphoramidite. Unlabeled single-stranded synthetic oligos used for competition studies were obtained from Operon Biotechnologies, Inc. Binding reaction conditions were 5 fmol/μl labeled oligonucleotide, 4 units/μl poly(dI-dC), and 0.3 μg/μl nuclear extract, and gels were scanned with the Li-Cor Odyssey imaging system. Competition reactions contained from 1× to 100× molar excess unlabeled oligonuleotides. The oligonucleotide containing the FoxD1 sequence was 5′-CAAGGTTGTTGACACAAGAGAGCCCTCAGG-3′. A mutant oligonucleotide containing changes to the core FoxD1 binding sequence was 5′-CAAGGTTGGGGACACAAGAGAGCCCTCAGG-3′. Immunohistochemistry—Tissue specimens were retrieved from the tissue bank of Lilly Research Laboratories. These tissues were obtained from the Cooperative Human Tissue Network using an institutional review board-approved protocol. All human samples were derived from surgical specimens obtained during the period extending from 1996 to 1999. Tissues were fixed overnight in zinc-buffered formalin and then transferred to 70% ethanol prior to processing through paraffin. The sectioning and staining with antibodies against Smad6, TGF-β, and PAI-1 were as described previously (24Sandusky G. Berg D.T. Richardson M.A. Myers L. Grinnell B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49815-49819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A biotinylated secondary antibody plus streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase kit (Dako LSAB2) was then utilized along with a DAB chromagen and peroxide substrate to detect the bound antibody complexes. The slides were briefly counter-stained with hematoxylin and reviewed by two investigators (G. E. Sandusky and M. Donovan) using light microscopy to evaluate the intensity and localization of the staining. TGF-β Enhances PAI-1 Expression from Human Endothelial Cells—As shown in Fig. 1A, the level of PAI-1 secreted from human SVHA-1 endothelial line was increased following treatments with TGF-β1 (and TGF-β3; data not shown). In both endothelial SVHA-1 cells and in the ECV304 line, the effect was dose-dependent with a half-maximal response of ∼25 pm. Moreover, using both the basal PAI-1 promoter- and TGF-β-sensitive 3TP-lux plasmid (Fig. 1B), we observed significant up-regulation of the promoter level by both TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 (data not shown) in these cell lines. As indicated above, endothelial Smad6s has been shown to differentially regulate TGF-β family signaling, and we sought to determine the role of this regulator on PAI expression. As shown in Fig. 1C, an antisense that blocked Smad6s, but not a sense control, significantly reduced the secretion of PAI-1 by TGF-β. Smad6s Enhances TGF-β Activation of PAI-1 and Nuclear Factor FoxD1—The antisense data suggested that PAI-1 up-regulation was influenced by the presence of endogenous Smad6s. We confirmed this by overexpressing Smad6s and examining its affect on PAI-1 secretion and promoter activity. As shown in Fig. 2A, the overexpression of Smad6s resulted in an increase in both endogenous PAI-1 mRNA and in the secretion of PAI-1. Using both the basal promoter- and TGF-β-sensitive 3TP-lux indicator plasmid in co-transfection experiments, overexpression of Smad6s resulted in an increase in PAI-1 promoter activity (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the effect on endogenous secretion and mRNA was the result of promoter activation. The p3TP-lux promoter contains nucleotides –740 to –636 of the PAI-1 promoter region, and previous studies have suggested several regions important for TGF-β regulation, including the region from –726 to –704 (32Sandler M.A. Zhang J.N. Westerhausen Jr., D.R. Billadello J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21500-21504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we have identified nuclear binding to a site in this region for the forkhead winged helix factor FoxD1 (Fig. 3A). The binding was specific and could be competed with cold binding site, and a mutation in the core FoxD1 sequence resulted in poor binding. Moreover, the overexpression of Smad6s was able to enhance the binding of FoxD1 to this region of the PAI-1 promoter, which corresponded with an increase in PAI-1 secretion from the treated cells (Fig. 3B). In addition, the binding of FoxD1 to the promoter region of PAI-1 could be increased by TGF-β alone (Fig. 3C). Smad6s Induction of TGF-β and Suppression by PCK-β Inhibition—As shown above, the overexpression of Smad6s induces PAI-1 and the binding of FoxD1 to the previously identified TGF-responsive site in the PAI-1 promoter, i.e. Smad6s appears to mimic the TGF-β response at the PAI-1 promoter. If the effect of Smad6s on increasing FoxD1 binding were dependent on TGF-β signaling, then we would expect inhibition of TGF-β receptor signaling by Smad7 to inhibit binding. As shown in Fig. 4A, both the increase in FoxD1 binding and the subsequent increase in PAI-1 secretion were inhibited by the overexpression of inhibitory Smad7. In addition, we examined the effect of overexpressing Smad6s on TGF-β levels secreted into the culture medium. As shown, Smad6s overexpression was capable of increasing the amount of TGF-β1 secreted from the cell (Fig. 4B). Moreover, the effect on TGF-β appeared to be the result of increased expression as indicated by the ability of Smad6s to induce both the TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 promoters. Previous studies have suggested that TGF-β mRNA induction can be sensitive to PKC inhibition (33Koya D. Jirousek M.R. Lin Y.W. Ishii H. Kuboki K. King G.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 34Koya D. Haneda M. Nakagawa H. Isshiki K. Sato H. Maeda S. Sugimoto T. Yasuda H. Kashiwagi A. Ways D.K. King G.L. Kikkawa R. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). To determine whether the Smad6s regulation was kinase-dependent, we treated cells with staurosporin at concentrations known to inhibit PKC and found complete inhibition of the Smad6s regulation of TGF-β (Fig. 4B). Moreover, using the PKC-β-selective inhibitor LY379196 the effect of Smad6s also could be completely eliminated. Differential Regulation of Smad6s, PAI-1, and TGF-β in Vascular Disease—The data above suggested that the level of Smad6s in endothelial cells could alter the level of TGF-β and the subsequent induction of PAI-1. To determine whether this relationship was observed in endothelial cells in vivo, we examined normal and atherosclerotic human cardiovascular tissues with Smad6s-, TGF-β1-, and PAI-1-specific antibodies, as studies have previously linked high PAI-1 levels to fibrotic vascular disease and also have demonstrated TGF-β overexpression in fibroproliferative vascular lesions (35McCaffrey T. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and lipid-rich aortic intimal lesions (36Bobik A. Agrotis A. Kanellakis P. Dilley R. Krushinsky A. Smirnov V. Tararak E. Condron M. Kostolias G. Circulation. 1999; 99: 2883-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In an analysis of 35 CD34-positive vascular samples, Smad6s levels were very low to undetectable in normal vessels but overexpressed in the endothelium over the plaque, as well as in the plaque vasculature (Fig. 5). Whereas little if any staining could be observed in non-diseased vessels with the TGF-β1- and PAI-1-specific antibodies, high levels of expression were observed in the Smad6s-positive vessels. These data support the in vitro observations in cultured cells and are consistent with Smad6s playing a role in regulating TFG-β and PAI-1 in vivo. Under normal circumstances, the vascular endothelium displays a number of regulatory mechanisms that modulate coagulation, inflammation, and vascular function to maintain homeostatic balance in the local environment (37Rosenberg R. Aird W. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 1555-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 38Vervloet M. Thijs L. Hack C. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1998; 24: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). As this balance is disturbed by either acute or chronic insult, pathological processes ensue that alter vascular function and ultimately organ function. Both PAI-1 and TGF-β play important roles in modulating the response to vascular and tissue injury, but factors that enhance or chronically elevate levels of TGF-β and consequently PAI-1 compromise vascular function and promote pathologic processes. As such, understanding the coordinate regulation of TGF-β and PAI-1 may provide the basis for improved targets for developing therapeutic intervention. In this paper we provide new mechanistic understanding for the control of vascular PAI-1 and TGF-β through the regulatory factor Smad6s and further demonstrate that the coordinate regulation of PAI-1 by Smad6s induction of TGF-β can be modulated by isozyme-specific inhibition of PKC-β. As reviewed above, the endothelial splice variant Smad6s has been shown to differentially regulate TGF-β family factors in Xenopus (23Krishnan P. King M.W. Neff A.W. Sandusky G.E. Bierman K.L. Grinnell B.W. Smith R.C. Dev. Growth Differ. 2001; 43: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and to positively modulate TGF-β suppression of endothelial thrombomodulin (24Sandusky G. Berg D.T. Richardson M.A. Myers L. Grinnell B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49815-49819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, Smad6s functions to increase the expression and subsequent secretion of TGF-β. Interestingly, Smad6 mRNA itself has been reported to be induced by TGF-β1 and BMP-7 (39Takase M. Imamura T. Sampath T. Takeda K. Ichijo H. Miyazono K. Kawabata M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 26-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 40Afrakhte M. Moren A. Jossan S. Itoh S. Sampath K. Westermark B. Heldin C. Heldin N. ten Dijke P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), and BMP-7 has been shown to regulate the expression of PAI-1. While further studies will be required to define these relationships, these observations along with the data presented here suggest that the control of TGF-β/Smad6-related functions form an intricate feedback loop regulating TGF-β levels and the induction of PAI-1. Several studies have identified the regions in the 5′-flanking region of human PAI-1 gene from –799 and –82 as mediating up-regulation of reporter gene expression by TGF-β1 in endothelial cells, both in vitro and in vivo (41Dong G. Schulick A.H. DeYoung M.B. Dichek D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29969-29977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). More specifically the region –791 to –546 upstream of the PAI-1 gene cap site (42Westerhausen Jr., D.R. Hopkins W.E. Billadello J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1092-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and from –740 to –636 (43Keeton M.R. Curriden S.A. van Zonneveld A.J. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23048-23052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have been shown to confer response to TFG-β. Most notable, a major TGF-β-responsive element was identified by DNA footprinting to bind a factor in the region –726 to –703 (32Sandler M.A. Zhang J.N. Westerhausen Jr., D.R. Billadello J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21500-21504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although at the time this region did not contain consensus sequences for any known transcription factors. Studies by Kutz et al. (44Kutz S.M. Providence K.M. Higgins P.J. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2001; 48: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) recently identified this same general region, from nucleotides –740 and –703, as required for serum response. Our data showed that Smad6s overexpression increased nuclear factor binding to a FoxD1 site centered at –720. The forkhead transcription factor FoxD1, also called FREAC-4 (45Ernstsson S. Pierrou S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 21094-21099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) or murine BF-2, appears to play a role in developmental patterning and in kidney morphogeneis/nephrogenesis (46Cederberg A.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1467-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). While this study is the first to define a role for FoxD1 in TGF-β response, the xenopus homolog XBF2 has been shown to modulate signaling of another TGF-β family member BMP-4 (49Gomez-Skarmeta J.L. de la Calle-Mustienes E. Modolell J. Mayor R. Mech. Dev. 1999; 80: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Of interest, the FoxD1 site is adjacent to a Smad3/Smad4 CAGA box/AGAC site (50Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar, 51Song C.Z. Siok T.E. Gelehrter T.D. J. Biol.

Hou et al. (52Hou B. Eren M. Painter C. Covington J. Dixon J. Schoenhard J. Vaughan D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18127-18136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) recently showed that the upstream regulatory region of PAI-1 is extended up to 15 kb, suggesting that future analysis of PAI-1 regulation will need to extend beyond the proximal promoter. Several studies have shown that both PAI-1 and TGF-β can be regulated by modulating PKC. Using cells deficient in PKC-β, previous studies have shown that PAI synthesis is dependent on PKC-β (53Lopez S. Peiretti F. Morange P. Laouar A. Fossat C. Bonardo B. Huberman E. Juhan-Vague I. Nalbone G. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 81: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and that the activation of PKC-β may mediate the production of PAI-1 in endothelial cells (54Ren S. Shatadal S. Shen G.X. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: E656-E662PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the PKC-β-specific inhibitor LY379196 effectively prevented low density lipoprotein-induced PAI-1 production (54Ren S. Shatadal S. Shen G.X. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: E656-E662PubMed Google Scholar) as well as PAI-1 mRNA induction via αVβ3 (55Khatib A.M. Nip J. Fallavollita L. Lehmann M. Jensen G. Brodt P. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 91: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In models of diabetes, studies have shown that TGF-β mRNA expression can be modulated by a PKC-β specific inhibitor (33Koya D.

Our data now supply a possible link to these observations of PKC-β dependence via modulation of Smad6s. Overall, our data provide new mechanistic understanding for the control of PAI-1 by TGF-β. The results presented here suggest that Smad6s plays a prominent role in controlling the TGF-β-dependent expression of PAI-1 and that targeting this Smad signal may provide new opportunities for therapeutic intervention in treating and preventing vascular dysfunction. Specifically, our data give a direct link to previous observations on PKC-β modulation and provide support for this kinase as a target for modulating vascular function where dysregulation of both TGF-β and PAI-1 is important to the pathophysiology of the disorder. While our data give new mechanistic understanding for TGF-β regulation, further studies will be needed to determine the relationship of these findings to other important mediators (57Brown N.

https://openalex.org/W2051738088,"Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. medellin is known to produce the Cry11Bb protein of 94 kDa, which is toxic for mosquito larvae due to permeabilization of the plasma membrane of midgut epithelial cells. Earlier we found that a 2.8-kDa novel peptide BTM-P1, which was artificially synthesized taking into account the primary structure of Cry11Bb endotoxin, is active against several species of bacteria. In this work we show that BTM-P1 induces cyclosporin A-insensitive swelling of rat liver mitochondria in various salt solutions but not in the sucrose medium. Inorganic phosphate and Ca2+ significantly increased this effect of the peptide. The uncoupling action of BTM-P1 on oxidative phosphorylation was stronger in the potassium-containing media and correlated with a decrease of the inner membrane potential of mitochondria. In isotonic KNO3, KCl, or NH4NO3 media, a complete drop of the inner membrane potential was observed at 1–2 μg/ml of the peptide. The peptide-induced swelling was increased by energization of mitochondria in the potassium-containing media, but it was inhibited in the NaNO3, NH4NO3, and Tris-NO3 media. All mitochondrial effects of the peptide were completely prevented by adding a single N-terminal tryptophan residue to the peptide sequence. We suggest a mechanism of membrane permeabilization that includes a transmembrane- and surface potential-dependent insertion of the polycation peptide into the lipid bilayer and its oligomerization leading to formation of ion channels and also to the mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening in a cyclosporin A-insensitive manner.

Mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel and its interaction with other proteins seem to be directly related to the metabolic specificity and permeabilization resistance of mitochondria in tumor cells. It has been reported that oncogenic C-Raf kinase inhibits cytochrome c release from mitochondria in growth factor-starved cells, and it has been hypothesized that the voltage-dependent anion channel mediates the switch to aerobic glycolysis (29Le Mellay V. Troppmair J. Benz R. Rapp U.R. BMC Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 14Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is consistent with theoretical models predicting a higher probability of the Crabtree effect in the case of decreased permeability of the mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel and a high amount of hexokinase II attached to the outer mitochondrial membrane (30Lemeshko V.V.

In this sense some synthetic polycation peptides are also able to inhibit the mitochondrial permeability transition (35Rigobello M.P. Barzon E. Marin O. Bindoli A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Understanding the mechanisms of action of some types of proteins and peptides on the structural and functional state of mitochondria seems to be important for the development of apoptosis-regulating technologies, particularly of the anticancer therapy, and for the design of new classes of antibiotics, taking into account a certain similarity between mitochondria and bacteria. Among the positively charged peptides, mastoparan, a 14-amino acid amphipathic peptide from wasp venom, has been found to cause mitochondrial permeabilization (36Pfeiffer D.R. Gudz T.I. Novgorodov S.A. Erdahl W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4923-4932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Mastoparan has been shown to take the α-helical conformation upon binding with phospholipid membrane (37Higashijima T. Wakamatsu K. Takemitsu M. Fujino M. Nakajima T. Miyazawa T. FEBS Lett. 1983; 152: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and to cause liposome permeabilization in a transmembrane potential-dependent manner (36Pfeiffer D.R. Gudz T.I. Novgorodov S.A. Erdahl W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4923-4932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) that seems to be the mechanism for mitochondria as well (38Sokolove P.M. Kinnally K.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 336: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that the liposome permeation ability of eumenine mastoparan, a novel natural tetradecapeptide with a broad-spectrum inhibitory activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, is correlated with the amount of helical conformation in the membrane (39dos Santos Cabrera M.P. de Souza B.M.

Most of the signal sequences of mitochondrial proteins with a net positive charge have been shown to induce potential-dependent swelling of mitochondria and to activate the mitochondrial multiple conductance channel (38Sokolove P.M.

Campo M.L. Kinnally K.W. Sokolove P.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 366: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Many membrane-active peptides have been reported to function as a defense system against bacteria in plants and animals (41Westerhoff H.V. Juretic D. Hendler R.W. Zasloff M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Among them, the positively charged peptides magainins, secreted by the skin of the amphibia Xenopus laevis, uncouple oxidative phosphorylation and significantly inhibit respiration of rat liver mitochondria and display antimicrobial (41Westerhoff H.V. Juretic D. Hendler R.W. Zasloff M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6597-6601Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) and anticancer activity (21Ohsaki Y. Gazdar A.F. Chen H.C.

Not only plants and animals but some bacteria also produce toxic peptides and protoxins against neighboring organisms. Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. medellin, for instance, produce crystal proteins, particularly Cry11Bb, that is toxic for mosquito larvae (44Orduz S. Rojas W. Correa M.M. Montoya A.E. de Barjac H. J. Invertebr. Pathol. 1992; 59: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). At least some types of Cry family proteins are activated by the midgut proteases to yield a membrane-active polypeptide(s) (45Rausell C. Munoz-Garay C. Miranda-CassoLuengo R. Gomez I.

A non-insecticidal and non-hemolytic B. thuringiensis crystal protein selectively kills human cancer cells in culture by non-apoptotic and apoptotic mechanisms (46Ito A. Sasaguri Y. Kitada S.

Here we demonstrate various effects of a new polycation peptide (BTM-P1) 1The abbreviations used are: BTM-P1, the peptide VAPIAKYLATALAKWALKQGFAKLKS; BTM-WP1, the peptide WVAPIAKYLATAL AKWALKQGFAKLKS; FCCP, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone; DNP, 2,4-dinitrophenol. on structural and functional state of rat liver mitochondria. The peptide is composed of 26 amino acid residues and derived from the primary structure of Cry11Bb protein of B. thuringiensis subsp. medellin. Its antibacterial activity has been recently demonstrated and related to the membrane ionic permeabilization. 2V. V. Lemeshko, S. Orduz, C. Segura, F. Guzman, and M. E. Patarroyo (January 7, 2004) U. S. Patent Application 10,751,984. In the present work we show that BTM-P1 in low concentrations uncouples respiration and oxidative phosphorylation of rat liver mitochondria, causes the drop of the inner membrane potential, and induces mitochondrial swelling in various salt media. The permeabilization effect of the peptide is potential-dependent, increases with an increase in potassium concentration, and in general depends on the ionic strength and ionic composition of incubation medium. Permeabilizing activity of the peptide can be completely prevented by an additional N-terminal tryptophan residue (the peptide BTM-WP1 of 27 amino acid residues) that allows the suggestion of a possible mechanism of the potential-dependent permeabilization of biomembranes by BTM-P1 and other similar peptides. Materials—Sucrose, d-mannitol, Hepes, Trizma base (Tris base), bovine serum albumin (free of fatty acids, fraction V), cyclosporin A, rotenone, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP), phosphoric and succinic acids, ADP, KCl, and other salts were purchased from Sigma. All chemicals were of analytical grade. The peptides BTM-P1 and BTM-WP1 were synthesized by Fundación Instituto de Inmunología de Colombia (Bogota, Colombia) by the method of solid phase synthesis, according to the amino acid sequences proposed by some of the authors of this work. The peptides were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography, analyzed by mass spectrometry (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight), lyophilized, and kept in powder at 4 °C until its use. 2V. V. Lemeshko, S. Orduz, C. Segura, F. Guzman, and M. E. Patarroyo (January 7, 2004) U. S. Patent Application 10,751,984. Isolation of Mitochondria—White male rats of 200–250 g starved for 12–14 h were used for isolation of liver mitochondria by the standard procedure as described earlier (48Lemeshko V.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 388: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Mitochondria were finally suspended in the medium composed of 210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 20 μm EGTA, 10 mm Hepes-Tris, pH 7.2, with 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (free of fatty acids). Mitochondrial protein concentration was evaluated by the fast volumetric test (48Lemeshko V.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 388: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and finally determined by the biuret method after finishing all experiments. Respiration and Oxidative Phosphorylation—Respiration and oxidative phosphorylation of mitochondria were measured polarographically using the modified Cole-Parmer oxygen electrode (49Lemeshko V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17751-17757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and the Cole-Parmer oxygen meter connected to the Linseis L250-E recorder. Mitochondria were added at concentration of 1 mg of protein/ml to the incubation medium containing 150 mm sucrose, 50 mm KCl, 50 μm EGTA, 10 mm Hepes-Tris buffer, pH 7.2 (sucrose-KCl medium), or to the medium containing 250 mm sucrose, 50 μm EGTA, 10 mm Hepes-Tris buffer, pH 7.2 (sucrose medium), both supplemented with 5 mm succinate-Tris and 5 mm phosphate-Tris, pH 7.2. After the addition of 2.5 μm rotenone and registration of respiration in the metabolic state 4, 270 μm ADP was added to initiate oxidative phosphorylation. The initial concentration of oxygen in the media has been considered to be equal to 200 nmol/ml, according to the atmospheric pressure in Medellín. The respiratory control ratio, calculated as the ratio of the oxygen consumption rates after and before ADP addition, was higher than six. Mitochondrial Swelling—Mitochondrial swelling was monitored by apparent light absorbance at 540 nm, A540, using a SP-850 Turner spectrophotometer equipped additionally with a magnetic stirrer and a thermostatic chamber. The apparent absorbance curve was recorded with the Linseis L250-E recorder connected to the spectrophotometer. Mitochondria (0.5 mg of protein/ml), 2.5 μm rotenone, and where indicated 0.5 μm cyclosporin A were added to the following incubation media, all containing 10 mm Hepes-Tris buffer, pH 7.2, and 50 μm EGTA in addition to 250 mm sucrose (sucrose medium), 150 mm sucrose and 50 mm KCl (sucrose-KCl medium), 125 mm KCl (KCl medium), 125 mm KNO3 (KNO3 medium), 125 mm NH4NO3 (NH4NO3 medium), 125 mm NaNO3 (NaNO3 medium), or 125 mm Tris-NO3 (Tris-NO3 medium) with or without 5 mm succinate-Tris, pH 7.2. Peptides were added as aqueous solutions. Membrane Potential—The inner membrane electrical potential of mitochondria was monitored with the potential-sensitive fluorescent probe safranin O (520 nm excitation, 580 nm fluorescence) at a concentration of 10 μm, as described in Wieckowski and Wojtczak (50Wieckowski M.R. Wojtczak L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), using the sucrose, sucrose-KCl, KCl, NH4NO3, and KNO3 media (see above) supplemented with 5 mm succinate-Tris, pH 7.2, with or without 5 mm phosphate-Tris, pH 7.2. In the case of energization of mitochondria with 1 mm ATP, the sucrose-KCl and KCl media (see above) were used without the addition of succinate and phosphate. Mitochondria were added at a concentration of 0.5 mg protein/ml together with 2.5 μm rotenone. All samples were constantly stirred with a magnetic stirrer and maintained at 30 °C. Typical curves of at least three independent experiments are presented in figures. The obtained data show that BTM-P1, at a concentration of 4 μg/ml in the sucrose-KCl medium, increased the state 4 respiration of rat liver mitochondria almost up to the rate observed for the metabolic state 3 respiration (Fig. 1, a–c). Uncoupling activity of the peptide (Fig. 1c) was slightly less than that observed for 0.1 mm DNP (Fig. 1d). In the range of 1–4 μg/ml, the peptide stimulated mitochondrial respiration in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1b). Higher concentrations, 5 μg/ml or above, caused some inhibitory effect (data not shown). The uncoupling activity of the peptide was significantly lower in the sucrose medium (Fig. 1, e and f) in comparison with that in the sucrose-KCl medium (Fig. 1, b and c). It was possible to observe ATP synthesis with ADP/O = 1.44 (1.87 in the control) even in the presence of the peptide at a concentration of 2 μg/ml in the sucrose medium (Fig. 1e), although the respiratory control ratio was significantly decreased (3.2 in comparison to 6.9 in the control). In the presence of 4 μg/ml BTM-P1 in the sucrose medium, i.e. at 4 μg per 1 mg of mitochondrial protein, the respiration rate may be further stimulated by 0.1 mm DNP (Fig. 1f) up to the value observed in the presence of DNP without the peptide (Fig. 1g). The effect of BTM-P1 on the inner membrane potential increased with an increase of concentration of KCl in isotonic incubation media (Fig. 2, A–C). Only a slight decrease of the inner membrane potential was caused by 1 μg/ml BTM-P1 (2 μg per 1 mg of mitochondrial protein) in the sucrose medium with or without inorganic phosphate (Fig. 2A), but almost complete deenergization occurred in the KCl medium (Fig. 2C). A higher effect of the peptide was observed in the presence of inorganic phosphate in the KCl medium, where even 1 μg/ml of BTM-P1 caused biphasic and a complete drop of the inner membrane potential (Fig. 2C, b). In the sucrose medium the effect of BTM-P1 was also higher in the presence than in the absence of inorganic phosphate, but only after a third addition of the peptide, up to final concentration of 3 μg/ml (Fig. 2A, b). Mitochondria were characterized by a higher value of the inner membrane potential in the presence of 5 mm inorganic phosphate in all used media (Fig. 2, A–D). As shown in Fig. 2B (curve b), the addition of inorganic phosphate to the energized mitochondria in the sucrose-KCl medium caused a further increase of the inner membrane potential that resulted from a decrease of the transmembrane ΔpH caused by ΔpH-dependent phosphate transport with subsequent recovery of the proton electrochemical gradient by the respiratory chain function, mainly due to an increase in the transmembrane electrical potential. Without inorganic phosphate, the effect of 1 μg/ml BTM-P1 on the inner membrane potential of mitochondria in the sucrose-KCl medium was only slightly less than in the KCl-medium (Fig. 2, B, a, and C, a, respectively). Significantly different, biphasic kinetics of the potential drop were observed in these media with inorganic phosphate after the addition of the peptide; the first phase of depolarization of the inner mitochondrial membrane in the KCl medium was followed by a second phase of further autocatalytically increased membrane permeabilization (Fig. 2C, b). In the sucrose-KCl medium, in contrast, the first phase of depolarization was changed by a repolarization process (Fig. 2B, b) that looks like an excitable membrane behavior after under-threshold stimulus. A depolarization-repolarization process was also observed in the NH4NO3 medium with inorganic phosphate; a small decrease of the inner membrane potential was observed just after the addition of 1 μg/ml BTM-P1, but very soon its value was almost completely recovered (Fig. 2D, b). A higher depolarization effect, with a subsequent tendency to recover the inner membrane potential, occurred in the medium without phosphate (Fig. 2D, a). Although partial (Fig. 2B, b) or complete recovery (Fig. 2D, b) of the inner membrane potential was observed after the first addition of 1 μg/ml of BTM-P1, the second addition of 1 μg/ml of the peptide (i.e. to the final concentration of 4 μg per 1 mg of mitochondrial protein) caused fast and complete depolarization of the membrane. The inner membrane potential generated by ATP hydrolysis was also altered by the peptide, with almost complete depolarization after the second addition of 1 μg/ml BTM-P1. A somewhat higher sensitivity of mitochondria to the peptide was observed in the KCl medium (Fig. 2E, c) than in the sucrose-KCl medium (Fig. 2E, d). To evaluate the character and the extent of permeabilization effect of BTM-P1 on the inner membrane of mitochondria, the mitochondrial swelling was studied in the media composed of sucrose or various salts buffered with 10 mm Hepes-Tris, pH 7.2, and supplemented with 50 μm EGTA to decrease a probability of calcium- and phosphate-induced permeability transition. The obtained data show that 4 μg/ml of BTM-P1 had no appreciable induction of the swelling of energized or non-energized mitochondria in the sucrose medium (Fig. 3, Sucrose, curves b and a, respectively). A small induction, higher in the case of energized mitochondria, was observed in the sucrose-KCl medium (Fig. 3, Sucrose-KCl). A significant effect of the peptide was observed in the KCl medium, and the swelling of high amplitude occurred in the KNO3 medium, with the rate of swelling significantly higher for energized than non-energized mitochondria (Fig. 3, KCl and KNO3, curves b and a, respectively). The difference in the rate and the extent of the swelling in the KCl and KNO3 media may be related to the known higher permeability of the inner membrane to NO–3 than to Cl– ions (1Nicholls D.G. Ferguson S.J. Bioenergetics 3. Academic Press Inc., New York2002Google Scholar). Cyclosporin A did not influence mitochondrial swelling induced by BTM-P1 in the potassium containing media, as shown in Fig. 3 for the KNO3 medium. An opposite effect of the inner membrane energization on mitochondrial swelling, induced by BTM-P1, was obtained using NH4NO3, NaNO3, and Tris-NO3 incubation media (Fig. 3). Fast swelling of high amplitude was induced by the peptide in the case of non-energized but not energized mitochondria in the NH4NO3 medium (Fig. 3, NH4NO3, a and b, respectively). The effect of the peptide was significantly higher than that caused by a completely uncoupling concentration of FCCP under the same conditions (Fig. 3, NH4NO3, c). Cyclosporin A diminished but not prevented the swelling of non-energized mitochondria in the NH4NO3 medium under the influence of BTM-P1 (Fig. 3, NH4NO3, +CsA). High amplitude swelling of non-energized mitochondria induced by the peptide was also observed in the NaNO3 medium (Fig. 3, NaNO3, a), and a minor effect was registered in the Tris-NO3 medium (Fig. 3, Tris-NO3, a). BTM-P1 did not induce swelling of energized mitochondria in the NH4NO3 medium (Fig. 3, NH4NO3, b) at least during 4–5 min of incubation without or with cyclosporin A, except an initial swelling of low amplitude. The peptide induced a fast semi-maximal swelling of energized mitochondria in the NaNO3 medium (Fig. 3, NaNO3, b) as well as less profound biphasic swelling in the Tris-NO3 medium (Fig. 3, Tris-NO3, b). The data in Fig. 4A show that Ca2+ induces mitochondrial swelling in the sucrose (curve a) or sucrose-KCl (curve d) media with inorganic phosphate. BTM-P1, which was added before Ca2+, after phosphate (Fig. 4A, b), or before both Ca2+ and phosphate (Fig. 4A, c) in the sucrose medium or after phosphate and Ca2+ in the sucrose-KCl medium (Fig. 4 A, e) significantly accelerated swelling of energized mitochondria. At a concentration of 2 μg/ml in the sucrose-KCl medium with inorganic phosphate, BTM-P1 induced swelling of energized (Fig. 4A, g) but not deenergized mitochondria (Fig. 4A, f). Note, in the sucrose-KCl medium without phosphate, the peptide, even at a concentration of 4 μg/ml did not cause a significant swelling of energized or non-energized mitochondria (Fig. 3, Sucrose-KCl). The swelling of energized mitochondria may be also initiated by inorganic phosphate added after Ca2+ (Fig. 4B, a). FCCP, added to mitochondria before Ca2+ and phosphate, completely prevented not only Ca2+- and phosphate-dependent swelling but also the swelling of high amplitude induced by the subsequent addition of 4 μg/ml BTM-P1 (Fig. 4B, c). In contrast to FCCP, BTM-P1, added at 2 μg/ml before Ca2+ and phosphate, significantly accelerated the Ca2+- and phosphate-induced swelling (Fig. 4B, b), in comparison to the control without the peptide (Fig. 4B, a). FCCP, added together with mitochondria in the BTM-P1-containing medium, was able to completely prevent this type of accelerated swelling (Fig. 4B, d). The presence of phosphate in the KNO3 incubation medium increased the sensitivity of mitochondria to a small concentration of BTM-P1, 0.5 μg/ml (0.18 μm), resulting in a biphasic mitochondrial swelling (Fig. 4B, f) in comparison to the control without phosphate (Fig. 4B, e). The first phase of swelling seems to be due to direct permeabilization of the inner mitochondrial membrane to potassium; meanwhile, the second phase seems to be related to the permeability transition pore opening (Fig. 4B, f). To directly form channels in biological membranes, the peptide"
https://openalex.org/W2116583464,"We have studied translational control in the model of 48 h of fasting in the rat. Our initial observations showed a paradoxical increase in ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) phosphorylation and a decrease in eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) phosphorylation. These effects, which would favor an increase in protein synthesis, could be attributed to increased circulating concentrations of branched-chain amino acids in fasting. To determine what mechanisms might account for decreased hepatic translation in fasting, we examined the cap binding complex. eIF4E-bound 4E-BP1 did not increase. However, eIF4E-bound eIF4G and total cellular eIF4G were profoundly decreased in fasted liver. eIF4G mRNA levels were not lower after fasting. Based on the hypothesis that decreased eIF4G translation might account for the reduced eIF4G content, we fractionated ribosomes by sucrose density centrifugation. Immunoblotting for rpS6 showed modest polysomal disaggregation upon fasting. PCR analysis of polysome profiles revealed that a spectrum of mRNAs undergo different translational regulation in the fasted state. In particular, eIF4G was minimally affected by fasting. This indicated that reduced eIF4G abundance in fasting may be a function of its stability, whereas its recovery upon refeeding is necessarily independent of its own involvement in the cap binding complex. Western immunoblotting of polysome fractions showed that phosphorylated rpS6 was disproportionately present in translating polysomes in fed and fasted animals, consistent with a role in translational control. However, the translation of rpS8, an mRNA with a 5′-oligopyrimidine tract, did not coincide with rpS6 phosphorylation, thus dissociating rpS6 phosphorylation from the translational control of this subset of mRNAs.

Cap binding complex formation, eIF2α activity state, and rpS6 phosphorylation are all regulated by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). mTOR is a nutrient-sensing kinase (18Schmelzle T. Hall M.N. Cell. 2000; 103: 253-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). It is well established that its activity is under the influence of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA). However, mTOR is also regulated by receptor tyrosine kinases, including those for insulin, insulin-like growth factor I, and a panoply of peptide growth factors (19Fingar D.C. Blenis J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3151-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). It is generally accepted that the mechanism by which mTOR regulates mRNA translation involves activation of the translation initiation factor eIF4E via phosphorylation of the eIF4E inhibitory binding protein, 4E-BP1 (9Dever T.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 545-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 results in its dissociation from eIF4E, which permits eIF4E to interact with the scaffold protein eIF4G. eIF4G, in turn, recruits the RNA helicase eIF4A, which unwinds the 5′-untranslated region of the mRNA, the Poly(A)-binding protein, which circularizes the mRNA for translation, and eIF3, which links the mRNA to the 40 S subunit of the ribosome (20Raught B. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.D. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 245-293Google Scholar). This multiprotein complex forms at the 5′-cap of eukaryotic mRNAs and results in translational initiation. Activation of mTOR also results in the activation of the rpS6 kinases S6K1 and S6K2 (21Park I.H. Bachmann R. Shirazi H. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31423-31429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 22Fumagalli S. Thomas G. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.D. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 695-717Google Scholar). More recently, mTOR signaling has been shown to be involved in controlling the phosphorylation of eIF2α by its cognate kinase, GCN2. GCN2-dependent phosphorylation of eIF2α, which inhibits the ability of this initiation factor to participate in the activation of translation (9Dever T.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 545-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar), is rapamycin-sensitive in yeast, indicating a role for mTOR in this phosphorylation event (23Kubota H. Obata T. Ota K. Sasaki T. Ito T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20457-20460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 24Cherkasova V.A. Hinnebusch A.G. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 859-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). For the present studies, we have focused on the model of fasting in the adult rat to examine several aspects of translation control in the absence of cellular proliferation. Our rationale for doing so was based on long-standing observations that circulating BCAA concentrations increase in the fasted state (25Adibi S.A. Metabolism. 1976; 25: 1287-1302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 26Hutson S.M. Harper A.E. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1981; 34: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This leads to the conundrum that fasting might be associated with mTOR activation rather than inhibition. This, in turn, led to the following questions. Can a decrease in rpS6 phosphorylation in the fasted state account for a reduction in 5′-TOP mRNA translation? Is phosphorylated rpS6 preferentially found in ribosomes that are translating (i.e. in polysomes), thereby supporting a role for rpS6 phosphorylation in regulation of translation? Are 4E-BP1-dependent control of eIF4E and regulation of eIF2α the predominant mechanisms for control of translational initiation in this model? Materials—Primaria Falcon tissue culture plates were from BD Biosciences Labware (Franklin Lakes, NJ). Type I collagenase was purchased from Worthington. S6K substrate peptide (RRRLSSLRA) was purchased from Upstate, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Antibodies to rpS6 (mono- and polyclonal), phosphorylated S6 (Ser-235/236 and Ser-240/244), phosphorylated eIF2α (Ser-51), and eIF4E were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Antibodies to 4E-BP1, eIF4G, eIF2α, S6K1, and S6K2, as well as protein kinase A and protein kinase C inhibitors were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B, protein G-Sepharose 4FF and 7-methyl (7m) GTP-Sepharose 4B were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. TRI reagent was purchased from Molecular Research Center, Inc. (Cincinnati, OH). All primers for RT-PCR were purchased from Invitrogen except for β-actin primers, which were purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Animals—Male Sprague-Dawley rats age 4-5 weeks (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were used for all studies. Animals were fed standard laboratory chow ad libitum (control). Fasted animals had food withdrawn for 48 h. Where noted, animals were refed by replacing the laboratory chow in their cage cover and allowing them to eat ad libitum for 1 h. Rats were sacrificed under pentobarbital sodium anesthesia (50 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection). Liver tissue was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen before storage at -70 °C. All animals were treated humanely as per guidelines adhered to by the Rhode Island Hospital Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Hepatocyte Isolation and Primary Culture-In vitro studies were done using fetal rat hepatocytes because of their high basal level of translation in vitro (as opposed to adult hepatocytes, which would require acute stimulation with insulin plus epidermal growth factor to activate translation). Fetal hepatocytes were isolated from liver obtained on embryonic day 19 by collagenase digestion (27Curran T.R.J. Bahner R.I.J. Oh W. Gruppuso P.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 209: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemical analyses have shown that these preparations consist of ∼90% hepatocytes, with the remainder consisting of a mixture of non-parenchymal cell types. In vitro amino acid restriction was accomplished as described previously (28Gruppuso P.A. Boylan J.M. Anand P. Bienieki T.C. Pediatr. Res. 2005; 57: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Preparation of Liver Homogenates and Cell Extracts—Rat liver homogenates were prepared for S6K assays using a 15 ml/g volume of S6K homogenization buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm NaF, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 200 μm NaVO3, 1 μm microcystin, and 10% glycerol) containing protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 34.4 μg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride). For the 7mGTP cap-binding studies, samples were prepared in 15 ml/g liver volume of a buffer containing 50 mm Tris (HCl), pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 μm microcystin with protease inhibitors. Following homogenization, Triton X-100 was added to S6K lysis buffer and Nonidet P-40 to the 7mGTP buffer to final concentrations of 1% and 0.5%, respectively. The samples were then incubated on ice for 30 min. The detergent-extracted homogenates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 15 min. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The final supernatant was stored at -70 °C pending analyses. Cell extracts were prepared by lysing 2 × 106 fetal hepatocytes/100-mm plate with 400 μl of an ice-cold buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μm microcystin, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 with protease inhibitors (as above). The mixture was sonicated then incubated on ice for 30 min. The resulting lysate was centrifuged for 20 min at 10,000 × g, and the supernatant was frozen at -70 °C until use. Protein determinations were made using the bicinchoninic acid method (BCA, Pierce). Protein assays used bovine serum albumin as the standard. RNA Isolation—RNA was extracted from liver using TRI reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. To obtain total RNA from polysome pools, fractions were extracted twice using acid phenol:chloroform, pH 4.5 (Ambion, Austin, TX). The RNA was precipitated with ethanol overnight at -20 °C and recovered by centrifugation at 4 °C. The resulting RNA pellet was air-dried, dissolved in RNA storage solution (Ambion), and quantified by spectral absorption. Protein Analyses—S6K1 and S6K2 activities were measured by immunoprecipitation kinase assay (14Boylan J.M. Anand P. Gruppuso P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44457-44463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Western immunoblotting was accomplished using standard electrophoresis and transfer methods with chemiluminescent detection (29Anand P. Boylan J.M. Ou Y. Gruppuso P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E844-E852Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The association of 4E-BP1 and eIF4G with eIF4E was evaluated as their ability to bind to 7mGTP-Sepharose beads via the interaction with eIF4E. Sample preparation, 7mGTP-Sepharose affinity purification, and Western immunoblotting were carried out as described previously (29Anand P. Boylan J.M. Ou Y. Gruppuso P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E844-E852Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). PESTfind analysis of eIF4G used the European Molecular Biology Network-Austria site (emb1.bcc.univie.ac.at/embnet/tools/bio/PESTfind/). Polysome Analyses—For the preparation of polysomes, a small piece of liver (50-100 mg) was thawed on ice in 5 volumes of polysome buffer (25 mm Tris (HCl), pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 25 mm NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.14 m sucrose) containing 100 μg/ml heparin. Initial attempts to exclude the heparin resulted in polysomal disaggregation. The sample was first homogenized using a 1-ml Dounce homogenizer (Wheaton, IL) with a loose-fitting pestle. After the addition of 0.9 volume of buffer containing 10% Triton X-100 and 10% deoxycholate, the sample was re-homogenized on ice with a tight-fitting pestle. Nuclei and mitochondria were pelleted by microcentrifugation at 4 °C for 2.5 min. The resulting cytosol preparation was diluted with an equal volume of polysome buffer containing 500 μg/ml heparin. A 0.3-ml aliquot of this mixture was layered over a 0-45% sucrose gradient made in 25 mm Tris (HCl), pH 7.4, 25 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2. Ultracentrifugation was carried out at 4 °C and 40,000 rpm in a SW40 Ti Beckman rotor. Tube piercing was accomplished using a Brandel apparatus that allowed collection starting with the densest portion of the gradient at the bottom of the tube. Absorbance at 254 nm was monitored directly using a flow-cell attached to a spectrophotometer. Twelve 1-ml fractions were collected, and pooled as follows: Fractions 1-4, long polysomes; fractions 5-8, intermediate polysomes; fractions 9-12, short polysome/monosome pool. A small aliquot from each pool was prepared for Western immunoblotting. The remainder of the polysome pools was used for RNA extraction. Because heparin was present in the gradient, and because it potently inhibits PCR, the contaminating heparin was digested with heparinase. This was accomplished by incubating 1 μg of RNA from pooled gradient fractions with 3 units of heparinase in a buffer containing 5 mm Tris (HCl), pH 8.0, 1 mm CaCl2, and 40 units of RNasin (Promega, Madison, WI) per sample. This mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 2 h prior to analysis by RT-PCR. Reverse Transcription and Polymerase Chain Reaction—cDNA was generated using 3 μg of total RNA from liver or 1 μg from polysome pools using SuperScript™ First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). Rat-derived sequence data were used for primer design except when not available (eIF4G), in which case the human sequence was used. PCR primers were designed using the MIT Primer3 design program (www.genome.wi.mit.edu//cgi-bin/primer/primer3.cgi). Ribosomal protein S8 (rpS8) primer sequences were provided by Dr. Scot Kimball (Pennsylvania State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA). RT-PCR was performed in a semi-quantitative manner, as described previously (30Awad M.M. Gruppuso P.A. Cell Growth Differ. 2000; 11: 325-334PubMed Google Scholar, 31Awad M.M. Sanders J.A.

At the end of this period of starvation, liver mass was decreased as indicated by a 23% fall in liver:body mass ratio (control, 0.047 ± 0.005 (mean ± 1 S.D.); fasted, 0.036 ± 0.002; p < 0.002). Liver protein content declined by 39% (control, 841 ± 7.61 mg; fasted, 512 ± 73 mg; p < 0.002). To determine if the decrease in mass and protein could be accounted for by a reduction in cell size, cryosections were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to detect nuclei and subjected to morphometric analysis. Results demonstrated a 49% increase in nuclei per unit surface area (control, 109 ± 17 nuclei per high powered field; fasted, 162 ± 10 nuclei per high powered field; p < 0.001), consistent with a marked decrease in hepatocyte size in the fasted animals. Hepatic rpS6 and eIF2α Phosphorylation in 48-h Fasted Rats—Our initial studies were aimed at examining the phosphorylation state of rpS6, an indicator of the activation state of the mTOR pathway. The results we obtained (Fig. 1) were unexpected and counterintuitive. There was an increase in the amount of phosphorylated rpS6 in liver from fasted rats. In cultured cells, nutrient deprivation causes a precipitous drop in rpS6 phosphorylation (35Kimball S.R. Shantz L.M. Horetsky R.L. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11647-11652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 36Shigemitsu K. Tsujishita Y. Miyake H. Hidayat S. Tanaka N. Hara K. Yonezawa K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Therefore, we concluded that nutrient deprivation in vivo differs from starvation of cells in culture. To confirm that this increase could not be attributed to hormone-mediated signaling downstream from phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, we examined the activation state of Akt (Fig. 1). As would be expected, hepatic Akt phosphorylation was decreased in the fasted animals and restored with refeeding. Analysis for the activities of the rpS6 kinases S6K1 and S6K2 were consistent with the rpS6 phosphorylation results. S6K activities are high in cells involved in growth and proliferation and low in cells that are quiescent (22Fumagalli S. Thomas G. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.D. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 695-717Google Scholar). It was therefore unexpected to find that S6K1 and S6K2 activities (Fig. 2) were 30-40% higher in fasted compared with control rat livers. These results were interpreted as indicating that under conditions of fasting hepatic mTOR signaling may increase rather than decrease. Loss of eIF2 nucleotide exchange activity due to increased eIF2α phosphorylation is a mechanism that cells employ to shut down translational initiation (9Dever T.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 545-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Based on prior observations that hepatocyte protein synthesis is inhibited during starvation, we predicted higher levels of eIF2α phosphorylation in fasted animals. We performed Western immunoblots for phosphorylated and total eIF2α in liver homogenates prepared from fed and fasted rats. Again, results we obtained (Fig. 3) were unexpected. eIF2α was relatively hypophosphorylated in livers of fasted animals. As noted above, the regulation of translation is responsive not only to hormone and growth factor signals, but also to nutrient availability. Furthermore, fasting is associated with increased circulating concentrations of some amino acids, most notably BCAAs (25Adibi S.A. Metabolism. 1976; 25: 1287-1302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 26Hutson S.M. Harper A.E. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1981; 34: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that the changes in hepatic rpS6 and eIF2α phosphorylation could be accounted for by a response to elevated BCAA availability, we studied rat hepatocytes in primary culture. Cells were cultured overnight in the presence of 0.4 mm (high) or 0.04 mm (low) leucine. Results (Fig. 4) showed a direct association between leucine concentration and rpS6 phosphorylation, whereas the relationship between leucine concentration and eIF2α phosphorylation was an inverse association. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that changes in leucine availability could significantly contribute to the changes in these phosphorylation events that we observed in liver from the fasting rats. eIF4E·eIF4G Complex Formation in Livers of Animals Fasted for 48 h—Having not identified the mechanism of hepatic translational inhibition in fasting, we used 7mGTP-Sepharose beads to affinity purify eIF4E and its binding partners 4E-BP1 and eIF4G. eIF4E binds to eIF4G and 4E-BP1 in a mutually exclusive manner; eIF4E has a single binding site that is shared by eIF4G and 4E-BP1 (37Sachs A.B. Varani G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 356Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Based on published data, we predicted that fasting would result in a marked decrease in 4E-BP1 phosphorylation with a resultant increase in 4E-BP1-eIF4E binding and a reciprocal decrease in eIF4G-eIF4E binding. Contrary to this expectation, fasting was associated with a decrease in the amount of 4E-BP1 that co-purified with eIF4E (Fig. 5A). However, we also saw a profound decrease in the amount of eIF4G bound to the 7mGTP beads (Fig. 5A). The explanation for this observation was apparent when we performed Western immunoblots on total liver homogenates for eIF4E, eIF4G, and 4E-BP1 (Fig. 5B). Although we found that the abundance of all the three proteins decreased in the fasted state, the decrease in eIF4G was disproportionately high. This raised the possibility that regulation of eIF4G abundance, not 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, may be responsible for translational inhibition of liver in vivo. To determine if there is down-regulation of eIF4G secondary to a decrease in steady-state mRNA levels in fasted liver, we performed semi-quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 6). eIF4G expression relative to β-actin was unaffected by fasting, indicating that translational and/or post-translational events account for the change in eIF4G abundance between livers of control and fasted rats. Polysome Fractionation and RT-PCR of Control, Fasted, and Refed Rats—Post-nuclear supernatants of liver homogenates from control, 48-h fasted, and 1-h refed animals were fractionated on a sucrose gradient. The absorbance profile was used to confirm the fractions containing long polysomes, intermediate polysomes, and short polysomes/monosomes. We found that a duration of centrifugation of 105 min maximized the resolution of the fractionation. In an initial experiment (Fig. 7A), we analyzed 12 fractions across the entire polysome profile for rpS6 content. The results indicated that fasting was associated with a subtle shift from the fractions containing long polysomes to those containing intermediate polysomes. Under all conditions, a significant proport"
