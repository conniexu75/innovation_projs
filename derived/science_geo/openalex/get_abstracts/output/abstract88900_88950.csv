https://openalex.org/W1984505687,cDNA clones of human complement components C4A and C4B alleles were prepared from mRNA obtained from the liver of a donor heterozygous at both loci. cDNA from one C4A allele was sequenced to give the derived complete amino acid sequence of 1722 amino acid residues of the C4 single chain precursor molecule and the estimated sequences of the three peptide chains of secreted C4. Comparison with partial sequences of a second C4A allele and a C4B allele has led to the tentative identification of some class differences in nucleotide sequences between C4A and C4B and of allelic differences between C4A alleles in this highly polymorphic system.

SF 86-327, the most effective of these compounds so far, is highly active in vitro against a wide range of fungi and exceeds clinical standards in the oral and topical treatment of guinea pig dermatophytoses. SF 86-327 is a powerful specific inhibitor of fungal squalene epoxidase, a key enzyme in sterol biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1976110788,"More than 90 percent of enucleated one-cell mouse embryos receiving pronuclei from other one-cell embryos successfully develop to the blastocyst stage in vitro. In this investigation, nuclei from successive preimplantation cleavage stages were introduced into enucleated one-cell embryos and the embryos were tested for development in vitro. Although two-cell nuclei supported development to the morula or blastocyst stage, four-cell, eight-cell, and inner cell mass cell nuclei did not. The inability of cell nuclei from these stages to support development reflects rapid loss of totipotency of the transferred nucleus and is not the result of simultaneous transfer of membrane or cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W1967565278,"Exogenous cholecystokinin selectively antagonizes opiate analgesia, which suggests that endogenous cholecystokinin may act physiologically as an opiate antagonist and may play a role in opiate tolerance. The use of the selective cholecystokinin antagonist proglumide provided a test of these hypotheses in rats that were either inexperienced with or tolerant to opiates. Proglumide potentiated analgesia produced by morphine and endogenous opiates and seemed to reverse tolerance. These results suggest that endogenous cholecystokinin systems oppose the action of opiates."

https://openalex.org/W2156981649,"Two stable fluorescent derivatives of molybdopterin have been structurally characterized. Form A is an oxidized pterin with a 6-alkyl substituent. Results of chemical, mass spectral, and NMR studies are consistent with the side chain formulation -C identical to C--CH-OHCH2OPO2-3. Similar studies on the Form B derivative indicate that it is the phosphorylated analog of urothione but lacks the 3-methylthio function. Form B (dephospho) can be synthesized from urothione by desulfuration with Raney nickel and oxidation with SeO2. Chicken liver sulfite oxidase (sulfite:ferricytochrome c oxidoreductase, EC 1.8.2.1) contains one phosphate residue (as molybdopterin) per subunit. The phosphate is noncovalently bound but is not released by trichloroacetic acid at 4 degrees C. The yield of Form A and Form B from sulfite oxidase is 0.50 and 0.27/subunit, respectively. The phosphate ester bond in isolated molybdopterin (Form B) is partially hydrolyzed by 1 N HCl at 100 degrees C (33% in 1 h). The release of inorganic phosphate from sulfite oxidase was more rapid (35% in 10 min) due to the presence of molybdate in the denatured enzyme mixture but slower than expected from a high energy phosphate bond. The presence of molybdopterin in a wide variety of molybdenum- and tungsten-containing enzymes has been demonstrated. Glucose oxidase and the iron and manganese superoxide dismutases are devoid of molybdopterin."

https://openalex.org/W1986309977,"Mouse and human atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) genes have been cloned and their nucleotide sequences determined. Each ANF gene consists of three coding blocks separated by two intervening sequences. The 5' flanking sequences and those encoding proANF are highly conserved between the two species, while the intervening sequences and 3' untranslated regions are not. The conserved sequences 5' of the gene may play an important role in the regulation of ANF gene expression."

https://openalex.org/W1539006225,"The effect of glucocorticoids on pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) gene transcription in the rat pituitary has been investigated by an in vitro nuclear runoff transcription assay. Both dexamethasone and corticosterone had rapid inhibitory effects on POMC transcription in the anterior lobe but not in the intermediate lobe of the pituitary. These effects were maximal during the first hour after injection of the steroid. Bilateral adrenalectomy had a time-dependent stimulatory effect on anterior lobe POMC transcription, presumably because of the removal of endogenous glucocorticoids. This study shows that the well documented inhibitory effects of glucocorticoids on POMC mRNA in the pituitary anterior lobe are due at least in part to an inhibition in POMC mRNA synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W43441705,"The phosphorylation of the calmodulin-dependent enzyme myosin light chain kinase, purified from bovine tracheal smooth muscle and human blood platelets, by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and by cGMP-dependent protein kinase was investigated. When myosin light chain kinase which has calmodulin bound is phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, 1 mol of phosphate is incorporated per mol of tracheal myosin light chain kinase or platelet myosin light chain kinase, with no effect on the catalytic activity. Phosphorylation when calmodulin is not bound results in the incorporation of 2 mol of phosphate and significantly decreases the activity. The decrease in myosin light chain kinase activity is due to a 5 to 7-fold increase in the amount of calmodulin required for half-maximal activation of both tracheal and platelet myosin light chain kinase. In contrast to the results with the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, cGMP-dependent protein kinase cannot phosphorylate tracheal myosin light chain kinase in the presence of bound calmodulin. When calmodulin is not bound to tracheal myosin light chain kinase, cGMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylates only one site, and this phosphorylation has no effect on myosin light chain kinase activity. On the other hand, cGMP-dependent protein kinase incorporates phosphate into two sites in platelet myosin light chain kinase when calmodulin is not bound. The sites phosphorylated by the two cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases were compared by two-dimensional peptide mapping following extensive tryptic digestion of the phosphorylated myosin light chain kinases. With respect to the tracheal myosin light chain kinase, the single site phosphorylated by cGMP-dependent protein kinase when calmodulin is not bound appears to be the same site phosphorylated in the tracheal enzyme by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase when calmodulin is bound. With respect to the platelet myosin light chain kinase, the additional site that was phosphorylated by cGMP-dependent protein kinase when calmodulin was not bound was different from that phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase."

To examine the functional role of peptides found within suprachiasmatic neurons, avian pancreatic polypeptide and vasopressin were microinjected into the suprachiasmatic region. Avian pancreatic polypeptide, but not vasopressin, shifted the phase of the wheelrunning rhythm as a function of the time of its injection within the circadian cycle. Avian pancreatic polypeptide or a similar peptide may be one component of the neurochemical processes underlying entrainment to the light-dark cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1522956324,"Resealed ghosts of human erythrocytes are sensitive to oxidative damage induced by xanthine oxidase acting on xanthine in the presence of iron. Damage was assessed in terms of lipid peroxidation and increased permeation of trapped markers, Na+ and glucose-6-P. Key findings are as follows. (a) Marker efflux from xanthine/xanthine oxidase/iron-treated ghosts accelerated after a lag, Na+ emerging far ahead of glucose-6-P. (b) Both effluxes and lipid peroxidation were stimulated by Fe(III) in a dose-dependent fashion and inhibited by chelating agents. (c) The antioxidant butylated hydroxytoluene effectively halted lipid peroxidation and net glucose-6-P efflux, but slowed Na+ efflux only partially. (d) Lipid peroxidation and marker release could be completely inhibited by superoxide dismutase or catalase, indicating that O2- and H2O2 are both required, possibly as precursors of OH. via the iron-catalyzed Haber-Weiss reaction (O2- + H2O2 leads to OH- + OH. + O2). (e) OH. scavengers, e.g. ethanol, mannitol, choline, had no protective effect against marker efflux and lipid peroxidation. Yet these agents did intercept OH. in the bulk medium, since they inhibited the degradation of 2-deoxyribose added as an extramembranous OH. probe. It is proposed that OH. produced on the membrane at iron binding sites reacts so rapidly with target molecules that scavengers cannot compete. (f) Desferrioxamine abolished all effects, including net egress of Na+. EDTA, while totally inhibitory toward lipid peroxidation and glucose-6-P release, diminished Na+ release partially, changing it to first order, approximately 3-fold faster than background. The latter response was totally inhibited by catalase, but only marginally by superoxide dismutase. This and other evidence suggests that different forms of membrane damage are responsible for enhanced permeation of the two markers; although glucose-6-P depends on lipid peroxidation, Na+ does not, certainly when EDTA is present."
https://openalex.org/W1677666740,"The entire amino acid sequence of complement factor B has been established combining both protein and DNA sequencing strategies. The zymogen consists of 739 amino acids, has four asparagine-linked carbohydrate sites, and has independently disulfide-bonded NH2- and COOH-terminal regions. The catalytic subunit, Bb, is a unique serine protease containing 259 amino acids that are not integral to any of the classical serine proteases. It is proposed that this region of the Bb fragment functions as a cofactor-binding domain for C3b. The Ba fragment was found to contain three regions of internal sequence homology which were unrelated to the kringle regions of prothrombin and plasminogen and which suggest an independent evolution for the B genome. Sequence alignment of the active site of B to the serine proteases was made using the three-dimensional structures of chymotrypsin and trypsin as molecular models. Three stretches within the hypothetical model for B contrast markedly with all known serine proteases in both amino acid sequences and predicted configuration. It is suggested that these altered regions contribute at least in part to the formation of the catalytic region of the C3 convertase."
https://openalex.org/W1493797388,"Evidence obtained by 13C NMR spectroscopy indicates that tetrahydromethanopterin (H4MPT) serves as a carbon carrier for C1 units at the methine, methylene, and methyl levels of oxidation. All three derivatives of H4MPT served as substrates for methanogenesis by cell extracts under a hydrogen atmosphere; in each instance, methane evolved at a rate comparable to that obtained when 2-(methylthio)ethanesulfonic acid was used as the substrate. Each C1 derivative of H4MPT stimulated the reduction of CO2 as efficiently as 2-(methylthio)ethanesulfonic acid. High resolution fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry indicated that the product of the spontaneous reaction of formaldehyde with H4MPT was methylene-H4MPT, with the molecular formula C31H45N6O16P. 13C NMR spectroscopy of hexamethylenetetramine, a model compound, suggested that the methylene group in methylene-H4MPT was bound to two nitrogen atoms. Molecular formulas of C31H44N6O16P and C31H47N6O16P were assigned to methenyl-H4MPT+, and methyl-H4MPT, by high resolution fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. 1H NMR spectroscopy of methyl-H4MPT indicated that the methyl group was bound to a nitrogen atom. Sensitivity of each derivative to oxygen was noted. Apparent extinction coefficients of H4MPT and its derivatives were recorded. Evidence for the enzymatic synthesis of methylene-H4MPT from methenyl-H4MPT+ is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1669085278,"The complete nucleotide sequence of rabbit muscle aldolase mRNA has been determined from recombinant cDNA clones and from a primer-extended cDNA synthesis on the mRNA template. The sequence is composed of 1375 nucleotides, exclusive of the poly(A) tails. The 5'-untranslated region contains 62 bases including a potential ribosome-binding site. The 3'-untranslated region is 221 bases long. The remaining 1092 nucleotides are in an open reading frame coding for 364 amino acids. There is a single methionine residue preceding the NH2-terminal proline. The deduced amino acid sequence corrects a number of discrepancies between published structures as well as assignments previously missed. The sequences of the cloned cDNAs suggests there may be microheterogeneity in the messenger RNA population."

The clones were detected by hybridization with a mixed probe consisting of 96 different oligonucleotides 17 bases long, complementary to the mRNA coding for amino acids 66 to 71 of apolipoprotein CII. The largest cDNA insert is 439 nucleotides long and contains the complete sequence for the mature protein, the 3' untranslated sequence, and sequence coding for 17 amino acids of a signal peptide. The cDNA clone was used to detect apolipoprotein CII mRNA approximately 500 bases long in human liver and intestine RNA."

The enzyme has a molecular weight of 40,000 to 42,000 and yields a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme was purified in 10 percent yield by a combination of protamine sulfate and ammonium sulfate precipitations, gel filtration, and ion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography. The purified enzyme can be stabilized with sucrose and stored at -20 degrees C for several weeks without any loss in activity."
https://openalex.org/W1668795089,"Ferritin, an iron-storage protein found in all life forms examined, is composed of varying proportions of two subunits of different molecular weight, heavy (H) and light (L). Using cDNA clones, we have determined the nucleotide sequence corresponding to the mRNA of the L-subunit of rat liver ferritin. The coding region of 546 nucleotides (182 amino acids) is flanked by 5‘- and 3‘ -untranslated regions of approximately 130 and 150 nucleotides, respectively. The rat liver L-subunit amino acid sequence derived from the reading frame of the cDNA showed 88% and 82% homology, respectively, with the amino acid sequences of horse spleen ferritin (Heusterspreute, M., and Crichton, R. R. (1981) FEBS Lett. 129, 322-327), and human spleen ferritin (Wustefeld, C., and Crichton, R. R. (1982) FEBS Lett. 150, 43-48), thus demonstrating evolutionary conservation of the L-subunit sequence. However, a major difference between the rat and the horse and human sequences is the insertion of an octopeptide near the COOH-terminus of the rat protein resulting in a slightly longer peptide chain in this species. The reading frame and parts of the derived amino acid sequence including the octopeptide sequence were confirmed by direct amino acid sequencing of cyanogen bromide peptides from rat liver ferritin. Minor fragments of rat liver ferritin, presumably derived from the H-subunit, were also isolated after cyanogen bromide treatment. On sequencing, these H-peptides showed limited homology with regions of the L-sequence but extensive homology with published H-sequences from human liver and spleen. The H-subunit sequence did not contain the octopeptide found as part of the L-subunit sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1494303065,"Phospholipids of plant membranes isolated from homogenates of dark-grown hypocotyls of soybean (Glycine max L.) undergo rapid and specific degradative changes. The degradation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) in such membranes is enhanced in the presence of the synthetic auxin, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), measured as the hydrolysis of PI or by an enhancement of [3H]inositol incorporation into membrane-associated PI stimulated by Mn2+, but not dependent upon added CTP, Mg2+, or diglyceride. The response is rapid and enhanced by auxin throughout the physiological range of growth-promoting concentrations (optimum at about 7 X 10(-7) M). The growth-inactive 2,4-D analogue, 2,3-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,3-D), is without effect. These findings suggest a cell-free response of isolated membranes to the hormone mediated by a definable enzymatic reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1522648964,"A cDNA clone for mouse apolipoprotein E has been identified from a mouse liver cDNA library by a combination of differential colony hybridization and hybrid selection-translation. The identity of the clone was unambiguously established by partial sequencing and comparison with human apolipoprotein E nucleotide and amino acid sequences. In conjunction with an in vitro translation assay for apolipoprotein E, the clone has been used to examine the relative levels of apolipoprotein E mRNA in various tissues of the mouse and the regulation of apolipoprotein E synthesis in response to a diet rich in saturated fat and cholesterol. In the tissues examined, the clone was found to hybridize to a polyadenylated RNA species of approximately 1400 nucleotides. Of the tissues involved in lipoprotein synthesis, liver is very rich (about 1% of total) in apolipoprotein E mRNA while intestine contains only trace amounts. Appreciable levels of active apolipoprotein E mRNA (up to 10% of that in liver) are also detected in peripheral tissues not associated with lipoprotein synthesis, including lung, kidney, spleen, and heart. Thus, extrahepatic apolipoprotein E synthesis may contribute significantly to the levels present in plasma, and a possible function in reverse cholesterol transport is considered. When mice were placed on a high lipid diet there was no discernible change in the level of apolipoprotein E mRNA in liver or intestine, although the level of the circulating protein increased about 3-fold. We conclude that in mice the effect of diet on apolipoprotein E levels in blood does not result from induction of mRNA in these tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1521119887,"S-Adenosyl-L-homocysteine was used to inhibit the methylation of carboxylic acid residues of membrane proteins in intact human erythrocytes. Incubation of erythrocytes for 24 h with 5 mM each of adenosine and L-homocysteine resulted in the intracellular accumulation of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine and substantially inhibited membrane protein carboxyl methylation. From the degree of inhibition and from the observed turnover of methylated proteins, we estimate that the number of protein methyl esters in cells incubated with adenosine and L-homocysteine for 20 h is less than 20% that of cells incubated without these inhibitors. No significant differences in the physical deformability properties of the membrane of these hypomethylated cells were detected. However, there was a small but significant (p less than 0.001) increase in the amount of membrane protein D-aspartyl residues in these cells compared to control cells. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that methylation of membrane proteins at D-aspartyl residues may result in the selective removal or repair of these uncommon residues."
https://openalex.org/W1660518293,"The number of carbohydrate-binding sites of the GalNAc-specific lectin is four per tetramer. The binding parameters of N-acetyl-D-galactosamine and methyl-N-acetyl-alpha-D- galactosaminide , were determined by titrating the perturbation in the absorption spectrum of the protein. For D-galactosides, it was necessary to use p-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-beta-D- galactosaminide as an indicator in substitution titrations. The association constants K were determined at several temperatures yielding 2.4 X 10(4) M-1 at 25 degrees C with delta H degree' = -45 kJ mol-1 and delta S degree' = -67 J X K-1 mol-1 for methyl-N-acetyl-alpha-D- galactosaminide and 1.0 X 10(3) M-1 at 25 degrees C, delta H degree' = -38 kJ mol-1 and delta S degree' = -69 J X K-1 mol-1 for methyl-alpha-D-galactoside. The increase in K by a factor of 25 caused by the acetamido group is largely enthalpic . Whenever different methods were used to determine the association constant of a given compound, the agreement was excellent. The observed changes in absorption or fluorescence of all chromophoric carbohydrate derivatives used are specific for the binding of carbohydrates. For large aromatic beta- aglycons such as p-nitrophenyl or 4-methylumbelliferyl groups, the increase in K of the N-acetyl-D- galactosaminide moiety is by a factor of 2 or less, but for a large N-5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl (dansyl) group this factor is about 20 as compared with the acetyl group. The concomitant 10-fold increase in dansyl fluorescence, also observed with four other GalNAc-binding lectins together with a favorable and large delta S degree' = +60 J X K-1 mol-1 strongly point at the presence of a hydrophobic region in the vicinity of the carbohydrate-binding site. The results of stopped flow kinetics with 4-methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl-beta-D- galactosaminide and the lectin are consistent with a simple mechanism for which k+ = 1.1 X 10(4) M-1 S-1 and k- = 0.4 S-1 at 25 degrees C. This k- is slower than for any monosaccharide-lectin complex reported so far."

https://openalex.org/W1513268968,"Ornithine aminotransferase, a mitochondrial matrix enzyme, is expressed constitutively in many mammalian tissues and is subject to complex hormonal and dietary regulation in rat liver and kidney. The kidney enzyme is induced by estrogen and thyroid hormone (3,3',5-triiodo-L-thyronine, T3). We demonstrated previously that the hormonal induction in kidney is the result of an increase in ornithine aminotransferase mRNA levels (Mueckler, M. M., and Pitot, H. C. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 1781-1784). In order to define further the level at which the enzyme is induced in the kidney, the transcriptional activity of the ornithine aminotransferase gene was measured after hormonal induction. This was accomplished by incubating purified kidney nuclei in an in vitro transcription reaction in the presence of [32P] UTP and hybridizing the nascent, 32P-labeled, nuclear RNA to cloned ornithine aminotransferase cDNA immobilized on nitrocellulose filters. Administration of estrogen resulted in an increase in the rate of ornithine aminotransferase gene transcription by 1 h, and the rate remained elevated until at least 20 h after administration. The activity of the gene was elevated 12 h after T3 administration. A lag time of at least 4 h was observed for the effect of T3 on ornithine aminotransferase gene transcription. When administered in combination, estrogen and T3 exerted a synergistic effect on the activity of the gene. The administration of estrogen or both estrogen and T3 also resulted in the increased steady state level of two putative ornithine aminotransferase nuclear precursor RNAs, 3190 and 4260 nucleotides in length."
https://openalex.org/W1631528711,"Liver L-type pyruvate kinase and aldolase B mRNAs are the two species whose translational activity increases the most after feeding starved rats a high carbohydrate diet (Simon, M. P., Besmond, C., Cottreau, D., Weber, A., Chaumet-Riffaud, P., Dreyfus, J. C., Sala Trepat, J., Marie, J., and Kahn, A. (1984) J. Biol. Chem., in press). We therefore compared the pattern of this induction in three tissues synthesizing these enzymes, e.g. the liver, small intestine, and kidney. Influence of high lipid and protein diets on liver L-type pyruvate kinase and aldolase B mRNAs was also investigated. In the starved rat livers, L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA was practically undetectable. Carbohydrate diet induced an increase of both mRNA concentrations, with a maximum at the 12-18th h; at this time, mRNA concentration was increased about 4-8 times for aldolase B and 40-100 times for L-type pyruvate kinase, translational activities representing about 1% of the total mRNA activity for both enzymes. After the 24th h of carbohydrate diet, mRNA concentrations decreased slightly, then remained in plateau. In animals refed the high carbohydrate diet, starvation as well as high lipid and protein diets provoked a rapid decrease of both mRNA concentrations and translational activities. In the kidney, aldolase B mRNA synthesis was high in starved rats and was only slightly stimulated by carbohydrates (1.5-2.5 times). L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA concentration was increased 6-15-fold after feeding a high carbohydrate diet. In the small intestine, in contrast, the extent of aldolase B mRNA induction by a carbohydrate diet was similar to that in the liver, while L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA concentration was practically similar in starved and refed rats (about 1:10 of the concentration observed in refed rat liver). These results seem to indicate that the mechanisms responsible for carbohydrate induction of L-type pyruvate kinase and aldolase B are different. In addition, dietary control of each enzyme is also different in the various tissues which synthesize them."
https://openalex.org/W1584116325,"The optical and fluorescence characteristics of lumazine (2, 4-dihydroxypteridine) and violapterin (2,4,6-trihydroxypteridine) are described. The reduction of xanthine oxidase by excess lumazine is markedly biphasic. The initial rapid phase is about 100-fold more rapid than Vmax and reflects the reaction of the enzyme with the first equivalent of lumazine; it is accompanied by the appearance of long wavelength absorbance of the Mo(IV) violapterin charge transfer species together with partial reduction in absorbance at 450 nm, reflecting a partial transfer of electrons from the Mo to the flavin and iron-sulfur center. A loss of substrate fluorescence and a burst of fluorescence due to enzyme bound product also occur during this phase. The second phase is rate-controlled by the dissociation of violapterin from the reduced enzyme. It is accompanied by a variable loss of the charge-transfer band, further reduction of the flavin and iron-sulfur chromophores and of substrate fluorescence, and the appearance of fluorescence of unbound product. This phase correlates well with the steady state parameters. The variation in kinetic behavior with pH is qualitatively explained by a marked decrease in the affinity of the enzyme as the pH is raised; Vmax is almost unaffected by pH. The temporal sequence of kinetic events reveals at least three steps in the reaction of xanthine oxidase with the first equivalent of lumazine."
https://openalex.org/W1585020895,"Pteroylpolyglutamate hydrolase was isolated from rat intestinal mucosa and purified with the aid of affinity chromatography. The affinity ligand was poly-gamma-glutamic acid (Mr approximately 12,000) derived from Bacillus subtilis. The specific enzymatic activity was increased 2,000-fold over the 100,000 X g supernatant of the mucosal homogenate with a yield of 20%. Sephadex G-200 gel filtration yielded an estimated molecular mass of 80,000 daltons. The isoelectric point was pH 8.2. The pH optimum in acetate buffer containing 1 mM zinc was 4.5. The KM values for pteroylheptaglutamate and pteroyltriglutamate were 0.21 and 0.67 microM, respectively. Polyanionic compounds, poly-gamma-glutamic acid, dextran sulfate, and heparin were noncompetitive inhibitors. Studies of the time course of hydrolysis of synthetic [3H]pteroylheptaglutamate by three separate techniques demonstrated the appearance of [3H]pteroylmonoglutamate, synchronous with substrate cleavage. Intermediate pteroyloligoglutamates were not detected. An endopeptidase-like mode of hydrolysis was further established by identification of a hexaglutamyl peptide as the other reaction product."
https://openalex.org/W1586143189,"Three straight chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenases were purified to apparent homogeneity from bovine liver using 40-70% (NH4)2SO4 precipitation, gel filtration, DEAE-cellulose column chromatography, and preparative electrophoresis. Separation of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenases by these procedures has been efficiently monitored by two newly developed analytical methods: (i) native staining of acyl-CoA dehydrogenases following separation by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels and (ii) determination of general acyl-CoA dehydrogenase by means of a specific substrate, 4-cis-decenoyl-CoA. The three acyl-CoA dehydrogenases were classified into short chain, general, and long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenases on the basis of their chain length specificities according to the nomenclature proposed by Hall and Kamin (Hall, C. L., and Kamin, H. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 3470-3486). The enzymes gave single protein bands in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing and nondenaturing conditions, and their subunit and native molecular weights were estimated to be 40,300 and 188,000 for short chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, 43,300 and 205,000 for general acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and 45,200 and 172,000 for long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. Long chain and general acyl-CoA dehydrogenases markedly differed in their substrate specificities toward unsaturated acyl-CoA esters with a double bond at position 4. The former oxidized 4-cis-decenoyl-CoA at a rate of only 2.7% of that obtained with decanoyl-CoA as substrate, while for the latter enzyme 4-cis-decenoyl-CoA was even a slightly better substrate than decanoyl-CoA. 2-trans,4-cis-Decenoyl-CoA was identified as the product of this reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1590174281,"Mouse liver mRNA that was enriched in sequences coding for ATP-citrate lyase by polysome immunoadsorption was used as a template for cDNA synthesis. Double-stranded cDNA sequences were inserted into the plasmid pBR322 and cloned in Escherichia coli RR1. Twenty-seven plasmids containing putative cDNA sequences for ATP-citrate lyase were identified by differential hybridization with single-stranded 32P-cDNAs synthesized from immunopurified mRNA, sucrose gradient-purified ATP-citrate lyase mRNA, and mRNA isolated from the livers of mice that were nutritionally induced or de-induced for ATP-citrate lyase biosynthesis. A subgroup of five recombinant plasmids was characterized further in hybridization-selection experiments. Each of these plasmids positively selected ATP-citrate lyase mRNA as determined by in vitro translation and specific immunoprecipitation. The length of ATP-citrate lyase mRNA was estimated to be 4900 bases in a Northern blot analysis. A 32P-cDNA probe derived from a 1500-base pair insert was used to investigate the basis for the 20-30-fold induction of ATP-citrate lyase that occurs when starved animals are fed a high carbohydrate/low fat diet. Dot-blot hybridization analysis disclosed that the relative content of liver ATP-citrate lyase mRNA increased 25-fold after 15 h of refeeding, indicating that the synthesis of the lipogenic enzyme is controlled at a pretranslational level in the nutritional paradigm."

When poly(A+) mRNA derived from the immunoselected polysomes was translated in vitro, full length malic enzyme (subunit Mr = 58,000) accounted for a significant fraction (approximately 20%) of the polypeptides synthesized. Double-stranded cDNA, synthesized using partially purified malic enzyme mRNA as a template, was inserted into pBR 322 and cloned. Twenty-five candidate malic enzyme cDNA clones were identified by differential hybridization. Four clones were studied further and each of these was shown to have malic enzyme cDNA sequences by hybrid-selected translation and specific immunoprecipitation. Plasmid pME1, which contains a 1400-base pair insert, hybridized to two mouse liver malic enzyme mRNAs with lengths of 2300 and 3500 bases. Similar analyses were performed on liver mRNAs isolated from MOD-1 mutant mice which lack cytosolic malic enzyme activity. These Northern blots disclosed a pair of aberrantly large malic enzyme mRNAs with lengths of 2800 and 4000 bases. Furthermore, anti-malic enzyme antibodies exclusively precipitated a polypeptide translation product with a Mr of 77,000 when MOD-1 mRNA was used to direct in vitro protein synthesis. Thus, it is possible that MOD-1 malic enzyme mRNA contains an additional polypeptide coding sequence. The translation of such a sequence might disrupt enzyme function and/or markedly decrease enzyme stability. The malic enzyme cDNA probe was also employed to demonstrate that the induction of malic enzyme in the livers of previously starved mice that were fed a high carbohydrate, fat-free diet was controlled pretranslationally by a parallel modulation of the malic enzyme mRNA concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1602853750,"The eye lens contains a structural protein (alpha-crystallin) composed of two homologous primary gene products, alpha A2 and alpha B2. In certain rodents, there is another alpha-crystallin polypeptide, alpha Ains which is identical with alpha A2 except that it contains an additional peptide between residues 63 and 64 of the alpha A2 chain. The alpha A-crystallin gene encodes the alpha Ains peptide in a separate 69-base pair exon, suggesting that the alpha A2 and alpha Ains mRNAs are derived by alternative RNA splicing. In the present study, we report the isolation of a cloned cDNA (pM alpha AinsCr1) from a cDNA library constructed in the bacterial plasmid pBR322. The nucleotide sequence of pM alpha AinsCr1 in the region of the insert peptide provides compelling evidence that the alpha Ains mRNA is derived from the same gene as the alpha A2 mRNA. S1 nuclease protection experiments, using a DNA fragment from pM alpha AinsCr1, showed that the alternative splicing gives 5 to 10 times more alpha A2 than alpha Ains mRNA. This ratio is comparable to that of the respective polypeptides in the lens. We did not detect an age-related or a differentiation-related difference in the ratio of the alpha A2 to the alpha Ains mRNA or their polypeptides. These results indicate that when the alpha A-crystallin gene is expressed in the lens, it splices the RNA sequences from the insert exon into functional mRNA 10 to 20% of the time."
https://openalex.org/W1668918370,"A cDNA clone complementary to mRNA encoding the precursor (Mr = 165,000) to the rat liver mitochondrial matrix enzyme carbamyl phosphate synthetase I (Mr = 160,000) was employed to compare relative amounts of the messenger in adult and fetal liver and in Morris hepatoma 5123D and 3924A cells. Northern blot analysis gave a size estimate for the messenger of 6,500-6,700 nucleotides. Carbamyl phosphate synthetase mRNA levels in 15-day-old fetal liver were less than 10% of adult levels; 5123D cells expressed the messenger at levels about 2-fold higher than normal adult liver, but the messenger was undetectable in 3924A cells. Albumin mRNA was also expressed in the former but not in the latter. Maintaining rats for 5 days on a diet containing 60% casein augmented the relative amount of carbamyl phosphate synthetase mRNA by about 2-fold, while a protein-free diet resulted in reduced levels of the mRNA (about 50% compared to animals on a normal diet). Finally, the pattern of hybridization of carbamyl phosphate synthetase cDNA to HindIII-digested genomic DNA showed no differences between normal liver and its corresponding hepatoma; however, a HindIII site polymorphism was observed between Buffalo and ACI rats."
https://openalex.org/W1546760200,"The levels of UMP synthase protein and mRNA are increased in rat hepatoma cells that have acquired resistance to pyrazofurin, a potent inhibitor of pyrimidine biosynthesis. A cDNA plasmid library was prepared from partially purified poly(A)+ mRNA isolated from the resistant cell line. Recombinant plasmids with inserts complementary to UMP synthase mRNA were selected by differential hybridization with cDNA prepared from wild type and resistant cell mRNA and analysis of hybrid-selected mRNA by in vitro translation reactions. One plasmid, pUMPS-2, contains a 850-base pair insert and was used to analyze UMP synthase gene sequences in the wild type and resistant cell lines. Blot hybridization of restricted genomic DNA demonstrated amplification of the UMP synthase gene in the resistant cells. The number of UMP synthase genes is increased 15-fold as determined by a modified dot hybridization procedure. Previous studies have shown that the resistant cells have a 16-fold increase in UMP synthase mRNA but a 40-fold increase in synthase activity (Suttle, D.P. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 7707-7713). To further investigate this discrepancy between the amount of increase in DNA and mRNA versus the increase in enzyme activity, we have determined the relative rate of synthesis and degradation of UMP synthase. The rate of synthesis was 13-fold faster in the resistant cells. The degradation rate was not significantly different between the two cell lines. These data indicate that gene amplification is the major factor contributing to the enzyme overproduction in the pyrazofurin-resistant cells."
https://openalex.org/W1564176782,"Functionalization of the beta-carbon of phenethylamines has been shown to produce a new class of substrate/inhibitor of dopamine beta-monooxygenase. Whereas both beta-hydroxy- and beta- chlorophenethylamine are converted to alpha-aminoacetophenone at comparable rates, only the latter conversion is accompanied by concomitant enzyme inactivation ( Klinman , J. P., and Krueger , M. (1982) Biochemistry 21, 67-75). In the present study, the nature of the reactive intermediates leading to dopamine beta-monooxygenase inactivation by beta- chlorophenethylamine has been investigated employing kinetic deuterium isotope effects and oxygen- 18 labeling as tools. Mechanistically significant findings presented herein include: 1) an analysis of primary deuterium isotope effects on turnover, indicating major differences in rate-determining steps for beta-chloro- and beta- hydroxyphenethylamine hydroxylation, Dkcat = 6.1 and 1.0, respectively; 2) evidence that dehydration of the gem-diol derived from oxygen- 18-labeled beta- hydroxyphenethylamine hydroxylation occurs in a random manner, attributed to dissociation of enzyme-bound gem-diol prior to alpha-aminoacetophenone formation; 3) the observation of a deuterium isotope effect for beta- chlorophenethylamine inactivation, Dkinact = 3.7, implicating C--H bond cleavage in the inactivation process; and 4) the demonstration that alpha-aminoacetophenone can replace ascorbic acid as exogenous reductant in the hydroxylation of tyramine. As discussed, these findings support the intermediacy of enzyme-bound alpha-aminoacetophenone in beta- chlorophenethylamine inactivation, and lead us to propose an intramolecular redox reaction to generate a ketone-derived radical cation as the dopamine beta-monooxygenase-inactivating species."

https://openalex.org/W1556100528,"In acidic media, the 5,6-double bond of uridine is rapidly hydrated to give a small amount of 6-hydroxy-5,6-dihydrouridine (Urd-H2O), the mechanism of which is known from studies of the acid-catalyzed dehydration of Urd-H2O (Prior, J. J., Maley, J., and Santi, D. V. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 2422-2428). In addition to dehydration, Urd-H2O also undergoes direct hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond in acidic solution. The kinetics of the above reaction demonstrates that Urd-H2O, or an intermediate in the pathway leading from Urd to Urd-H2O, is kinetically competent to account for the hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond of Urd. The hydrolysis of (1‘-2H)Urd proceeds with an alpha-secondary deuterium isotope effect of kH/kD of 1.11 at 25 degrees C. This isotope effect is sufficiently large to implicate carbonium ion character at the 1‘-carbon during hydrolysis but, since it is not the maximal value expected, suggests that N-glycoside cleavage is rate-determining with a transition state intermediate between reactant and products. Importantly, the hydrolysis of [6-3H]Urd proceeds with a substantial inverse secondary isotope effect of kT/kH = 1.15 at 25 degrees C which indicates some degree of sp2 to sp3 rehybridization of C-6 of the pyrimidine moiety during hydrolysis. From the data available, it appears that an important pathway in the hydrolysis of the N-glycoside bond of Urd involves either spontaneous cleavage of Urd which is protonated at the 5-carbon or a protonated species of Urd-H2O. The studies described here, together with the known susceptibility of the 6-position of pyrimidine heterocycles toward nucleophiles, permits the proposal of chemically reasonable mechanisms for enzyme-catalyzed cleavage of N-glycosidic bonds of pyrimidines."

https://openalex.org/W1573642011,"The time course of calcium-binding protein induction by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 was examined in embryonic chick duodena by single-label autoradiography. Duodena were excised from 19-day-old embryos, cultured for 24 h in defined medium, and exposed to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 at 1/2, 1, 1 1/2, 2, 2 1/2, 4, 6, and 20 h before the end of the culture period. Control duodena were identically handled but were not exposed to the hormone. All duodena were pulsed with [14C]leucine during the final 30 min of incubation. Cytosolic proteins, extracted from each radiolabeled tissue, were resolved by two-dimensional electrophoresis and autoradiographs were prepared from the resulting gels. Calcium-binding protein was detectable by autoradiography in duodena cultured with hormone for 1 h or more but not in the control duodena. The autoradiographs were converted to digital images by a scanning densitometer and entered into the Man-computer Interactive Data Access System. The total radioactivity incorporated into calcium-binding protein during the 30-min pulse was determined by computer analysis of the digitized autoradiographs, and the rate of calcium-binding protein biosynthesis was calculated. Duodena cultured with hormone for 1-20 h synthesized calcium-binding protein at rates of 129 +/- 17 to 8800 +/- 110 pg/mg of cytosolic protein/30 min. These rates demonstrate that calcium-binding protein is induced within the first hour of exposure to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, but in amounts too small to be detected by commonly used immunoassays."

The products have been characterized by mass spectrometry as the respective 2-X-3-hydroxy-3-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-1- propenes . The relative kcat values for these compounds at pH 5.5, 0.25 mM O2 are 49 min-1 (2-H), 8.6 min-1 (2-Cl), and 7.0 min-1 (2-Br). All three compounds have the characteristics of mechanism-based inhibitors of dopamine beta-hydroxylase since incubation of enzyme with these compounds under turnover conditions leads to a time-dependent loss of activity. The kinact values at pH 5.5, 0.25 mM O2 are 0.08, 0.20, and 0.51 min-1, respectively, for the 2-Br-, 2-Cl-, and 2-H-substituted analogs. No reactivation was observed after exhaustive dialysis of enzyme inactivated by 2-Br-3-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-1-propene, suggesting irreversible inactivation of dopamine beta-hydroxylase."
https://openalex.org/W1990830559,"Interferon-beta 1 (IFN-beta 1) complementary DNA was used as a hybridization probe to isolate human genomic DNA clones lambda B3 and lambda B4 from a human genomic DNA library. Blot-hybridization procedures and partial nucleotide sequencing revealed that lambda B3 is related to IFN-beta 1 (and more distantly to IFN-alpha 1). Analyses of DNA obtained from a panel of human-rodent somatic cell hybrids that were probed with DNA derived from lambda B3 showed that lambda B3 is on human chromosome 2. Similar experiments indicated that lambda B4 is not on human chromosomes 2, 5, or 9. The finding that DNA related to the IFN-beta 1 gene (and IFN-alpha 1 gene) is dispersed in the human genome raises new questions about the origins of the interferon genes."
https://openalex.org/W1516145881,"Abstract The interaction of metal ions with prothrombin fragment 1 has been shown by other investigators to result in conformational change(s). Previous studies based on hydrodynamic measurements from other laboratories have suggested that prothrombin fragment 1 will, in addition to undergoing conformational change, self-associate in the presence of metal ions but there is a question regarding the specificity and of metal ions in this process. The present study has made use of a covalent cross-linking agent, dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate), to study the self-association of prothrombin fragment 1 and has focused on factors influencing the covalent dimerization of bovine prothrombin fragment 1 during reaction with this reagent. Optimal dimerization of bovine prothrombin fragment 1 required the involvement of cations in two separable processes. The first role is probably a reflection of a slow conformational change in the bovine prothrombin fragment 1 representing isomerization of a proline-containing peptide bond (Marsh, H. C., Scott, M. E., Hiskey, R. G., and Koehler, K. A. (1979) Biochem. J. 183, 513-517). The role most likely reflects ion bridging with another prothrombin fragment 1 molecule. The ion specificities of these two roles are clearly different. Ions stabilizing the proper conformation (first role) are Ca2+, Sr2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, with Ba2+ having less capability in filling this role. Ions which have activity in the second (ion bridge formation) are Ca2+, Sr2+, and Ba2+. Mn2+ and Mg2+ cannot fulfill the requirements of this second and actually inhibit the function of Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1591173562,"Ethanolamine ammonia-lyase is an adenosylcobalamin-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the rearrangement of ethanolamine and other vicinal amino alcohols to oxo-compounds and ammonia. Treatment of this enzyme with the sulfhydryl group-blocking reagent methyl methanethiosulfonate produces a species with diminished catalytic activity. When methyl methanethiosulfonate -treated ethanolamine ammonia-lyase was incubated with a carboxyl-blocking reagent consisting of glycine ethyl ester plus a water-soluble carbodiimide, the enzyme lost more than 80% of its residual activity, while at the same time glycine ethyl ester was incorporated into it at a stoichiometry of 6 mol/mol of enzyme. Both the loss of activity and the incorporation of glycine ethyl ester were prevented if ethanolamine was included in the glycine ethyl ester-containing incubation mixture. These results suggest that an active site carboxyl group plays a role in the mechanism of catalysis by ethanolamine ammonia-lyase, and that this carboxyl group is amidated when the enzyme is incubated with glycine ethyl ester plus carbodiimide."

The deprotected, purified product was chemically identical to N epsilon- acetimidoglucagon and equipotent to N epsilon- acetimidoglucagon and native glucagon in its ability to activate adenylate cyclase and displace [125I] iodoglucagon from rat liver plasma membranes. Semisynthetic [ Phe1 ]-, [ Ala1 ]-, and [des- His1 ] glucagons prepared similarly achieved 85, 55, and 35% of the maximal activity and 22, 2, and 6% of the binding potency of N epsilon- acetimidoglucagon . The biological assays indicate that the amino group is involved to a greater extent in transduction than in binding, but the aromatic nature and hydrogen bonding capability of the imidazole ring of histidine-1 are important for both binding and transduction. In circular dichroism studies, all derivatives exhibited increased helicity in 2-chloroethanol. The [ Phe1 ] analogue although less soluble behaved similarly to native glucagon, while the [ Ala1 ] and [des- His1 ] derivatives exhibited an increased helical content in 0.01 N HCl as a result of an increased propensity of these derivatives to self-associate in the absence of 2-chloroethanol. The unexpected conformational changes throughout the molecule may have relevance for the functional activity."

The compounds were characterized by 31P and 1H NMR, high performance liquid chromatography, IR, and TLC. The compounds were examined kinetically and observed to be linear mixed inhibitors for the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase of Escherichia coli (EC 2.7.7.6); Ki values for the 3'-azido, x-dATP and 3'-azido, x-dGTP compounds are 33 and 0.95 microM, respectively. Neither compound functions as an alternate substrate or as a chain terminator during the normal kinetic time course. The 3'-azido, x-dGTP does exhibit a slow time-dependent irreversible inhibition and may therefore function as an alternate substrate and chain terminator with prolonged incubation. Both compounds (3'-azido, x-dATP and 3'-azido, x-dGTP) are photolabile and will derivatize lysine in a coupled photolytic reaction."
