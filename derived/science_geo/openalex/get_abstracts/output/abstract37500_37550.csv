https://openalex.org/W1972400761,"Coenzyme B12 serves as a cofactor in various enzymatic reactions in which a hydrogen atom is interchanged with a substituent on an adjacent carbon atom. Measurement of the dissociation energy of the coenzyme's cobalt-carbon bond and studies of the rearrangement of model free radicals related to those derived from methylmalonyl-coenzyme A suggest that these enzymatic reactions occur through homolytic dissociation of the coenzyme's cobalt-carbon bond, abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the substrate by the coenzyme-derived 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical, and rearrangement of the resulting substrate radical. The only role thus far identified for coenzyme B12 in these reactions--namely, that of a free radical precursor--reflects the weakness, and facile dissociation, of the cobalt-carbon bond."

Pharmacological stimulation of rat hippocampal neurons by systemic or intraventricular administration of the excitatory amino acids kainate or N-methyl-d-aspartate induces selective loss of brain spectrin and the microtubule-associated protein MAP2, as determined by quantitative immunoblotting, but not of actin, the high molecular weight neurofilament polypeptide, or glial fibrillary acidic protein. The spectrin decrease occurs primarily by enhanced proteolysis, as levels of the major breakdown products of the a-subunit increase more than 7-fold. This proteolysis may occur from activation of the calcium-dependent neutral protease calpain I. The immunopeptide maps produced by Î±-spectrin degradation, selective loss of spectrin and MAP2, and decrease in calpain I levels are all consistent with calpain I activation accompanied by autoproteolysis. We propose that calcium influx and calpain 1 activation provide a mechanism by which neuronal activity regulates the degradation of specific neuronal structural proteins and may thereby modify neuronal morphology."
https://openalex.org/W2092577288,"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) comprises a variety of clinically similar diseases of viral etiology that are endemic to and sporadically epidemic throughout the Eurasian continent and Japan. Although HFRS has not been reported in North America, viruses that are antigenically similar to HFRS agents were recently isolated from rodents in the United States. Examination and comparison of eight representative isolates from endemic disease areas and from regions with no known associated HFRS indicate that these viruses represent a new and unique group that constitutes a separate genus in the Bunyaviridae family of animal viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2052792277,"Antisera to atriopeptin III and to a cyanogen bromide fragment of the precursor molecule atriopeptigen were prepared and used to examine the distribution of atriopeptin-like immunoreactive material in the heart and brain of the rat. Granules of this material were seen in myocytes throughout the right and left atria and were densest in the perinuclear region. The distribution of atriopeptin-like immunoreactive material in the heart is consistent with previous reports of atrial secretory granules. In the brain neurons containing the material were observed in the hypothalamus and the pontine tegmentum. Atriopeptin in the brain may serve as a neurotransmitter in neural systems controlling blood volume and composition, the same physiological functions regulated by blood-borne atriopeptin."
https://openalex.org/W1497289365,"Abstract H+-translocating, Mg2+-ATPase was solubilized from vacuolar membranes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the zwitterionic detergent N-tetradecyl-N,N-dimethyl-3-ammonio-1-propanesulfonate and purified by glycerol density gradient centrifugation. Partially purified vacuolar membrane H+-ATPase, which had a specific activity of 18 units/mg of protein, was separated almost completely from acid phosphatase and alkaline phosphatase. The purified enzyme required phospholipids for maximal activity and hydrolyzed ATP, GTP, UTP, and CTP, with this order of preference. Its Km value for Mg2+-ATP was determined to be 0.21 mM and its optimal pH was 6.9. ADP inhibited the enzyme activity competitively, with a Ki value of 0.31 mM. The activity of purified ATPase was strongly inhibited by N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide, tributyltin, 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzoxazole, diethylstilbestrol, and quercetin, but was not affected by oligomycin, sodium azide, sodium vanadate, or miconazole. It was not inhibited at all by antiserum against mitochondrial F1-ATPase or mitochondrial F1-ATPase inhibitor protein. These results indicated that vacuolar membrane H+-ATPase is different from either yeast plasma membrane H+-ATPase or mitochondrial F1-ATPase. The vacuolar membrane H+-ATPase was found to be composed of two major polypeptides a and b of Mr = 89,000 and 64,000, respectively, and a N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide binding polypeptide c of Mr = 19,500, whose polypeptide composition was also different from those of either plasma membrane H+-ATPase or mitochondrial F1-ATPase of S. cerevisiae."
https://openalex.org/W1600728970,"Four intracellular proteases partially purified from liver preferentially degraded the oxidatively modified (catalytically inactive) form of glutamine synthetase. One of the proteases was cathepsin D which is of lysosomal origin; the other three proteases were present in the cytosol. Two of these were calcium-dependent proteases with different calcium requirements. The low-calcium-requiring type (calpain I) accounted for most of the calcium-dependent activity of both mouse and rat liver. The calcium-independent cytosolic protease, referred to as the alkaline protease, has a molecular weight of 300,000 determined by gel filtration. Native glutamine synthetase was not significantly degraded by the cytosolic proteases at physiological pH, but oxidative modification of the enzyme caused a dramatic increase in its susceptibility to attack by these proteases. In contrast, trypsin and papain did degrade the native enzyme and the degradation of modified glutamine synthetase was only 2- to 4-fold more rapid. Adenylylation of glutamine synthetase had little effect on its susceptibility to proteolysis. Although major structural modifications such as dissociation, relaxation, and denaturation also increased the rate of degradation, the oxidative modification is a specific type of covalent modification which could occur in vivo. Oxidative modification can be catalyzed by a variety of mixed function oxidase systems present within cells and causes inactivation of a number of enzymes. Moreover, the presence of cytosolic proteases which recognize the oxidized form of glutamine synthetase suggests that oxidative modification may be involved in intracellular protein turnover."

https://openalex.org/W1527015272,"Addition of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) to S49 lymphoma cells (wild type and a cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase-lacking clone) has little effect alone but doubles accumulation of cyclic AMP in response to isoproterenol. The effect is immediate and has an apparent affinity and order of potency characteristic of the activation of protein kinase C by phorbol esters. Enhancement does not reflect an altered time course of the beta-adrenergic response, enhanced affinity of the cellular beta-receptor for agonist, or decreased degradation and export of cellular cyclic AMP. Reduction of the beta-adrenergic response by somatostatin does not remove the effect of TPA nor does TPA abolish the effect of somatostatin. Phorbol ester enhances cyclic AMP accumulation in response to cholera toxin in wild type and UNC clones but not in H21a or cyc-. TPA also enhances cAMP accumulation in response to forskolin in wild type cells. The effect of TPA is stable to rapid preparation of membranes. In adenylate cyclase assays on membranes from cells treated with TPA, the activation by guanosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imino)triphosphate is enhanced by 40% with no change in lag time; the effect of beta-agonist plus Gpp(NH)p is similarly enhanced; activation by Mn2+ is unchanged. We conclude that phorbol ester facilitates the productive interaction of the alpha subunit of the transducer protein Gs with the catalytic unit of adenylate cyclase, hypothetically via an action of protein kinase C."

https://openalex.org/W2058003632,"N. gonorrhoeae undergoes pilus phase and antigenic variation. During phase variation, the pilin gene is turned on and off at high frequencies. Two loci on the gonococcal chromosome from strain MS11 function as expression sites for the pilin gene (pilE1 and pilE2); many other sites apparently contain silent variant pilin sequences. We reported previously that during pilus phase variation, when cells switch from the pilus expressing state (P+) to the nonexpressing state (P-), genome rearrangement occurs. We have examined phase variation in more detail, and we report that in most P+ to P- switches a deletion of pilin gene information occurs in one or both expression sites. This deletion is due to either a simple or a multiple-step recombination event involving directly repeated sequences in the expression loci. The deletion explains the state of some P- cells, but not all. In the latter cells pilin expression is probably controlled by an undefined regulator."
https://openalex.org/W1517703297,"Abstract The human pro-alpha 1(I) collagen gene is 18 kilobases long, and its coding information is subdivided in 51 exons. We have recently reported a detailed analysis of this elaborate structure. Here we describe the exact termini of the gene as well as its 5' flanking sequences (promoter region). Sequence comparison between the human and mouse pro-alpha 1(I) gene showed an unusual highly conserved region 5' to the initiation site of transcription, which may be important for pro-alpha 1(I) collagen expression. Sequence comparison between the pro-alpha 1(I) and other collagen genes revealed the presence of a conserved secondary structure possibly implicated in the regulation of collagen mRNA translation and/or collagen secretion. Two short repetitive sequences closely associated with the pro-alpha 1(I) gene have been identified to be different members of the AluI family of repeats. Like the independently co-expressed pro-alpha 2(I) collagen gene, the analysis of the last exon has revealed that the pro-alpha 1(I) gene transcribes two different mRNAs in cultured fibroblasts. The colinearity and exact location of the termini of these transcripts, as well as their monogenic nature, have been conclusively determined."
https://openalex.org/W1679600852,"Regulatory mechanisms of cytoplasmic pH in Streptococcus faecalis with no respiratory chain were investigated. In a mutant defective in cytoplasmic alkalization conducted by a proton-translocating ATPase (H+-ATPase), the cytoplasmic pH is approximately 0.4 to 0.5 pH units lower than the medium pH, at pH 5.5 to 9.0. The cytoplasmic pH of the wild-type strain was always higher than that of the mutant at a pH below 8 and was the same as that of the mutant at an alkaline pH over 8. Thus, the cytoplasmic pH is regulated only by the cytoplasmic alkalization, and there is no regulation at alkaline pH in S. faecalis. A generation of the protonmotive force conducted by the H+-ATPase depended on the cytoplasmic pH rather than the medium pH, and the generation decreased rapidly when the cytoplasmic pH was increased over 7.7. The decrease at alkaline pH was not caused by increases in the rate of proton influx. These results suggest that cytoplasmic alkalization is diminished when alkaline pH of the cytoplasm is over 7.7, because of a low activity of proton extrusion by the H+-ATPase, and consequently, the cytoplasmic pH is regulated at about 7.7. The cytoplasmic pH was regulated at a high level in cells that had a high level of H+-ATPase. I conclude that in S. faecalis, the cytoplasmic pH is regulated by H+-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W2113545773,"Duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) is a DNA virus that replicates by reverse transcription. We have examined transcripts of DHBV to elucidate mechanisms of gene expression and replication. Three major transcripts were characterized and related to the expression of the genes for the core antigen (DHBcAg), the surface antigen (DHBsAg), and the pre-S/DHBs protein, respectively. They are unspliced and overlap partially since they start at different promoter sites, but they terminate near a common polyadenylation signal. The messenger RNA related to DHBcAg expression is the only major transcript of more than genome length and therefore also represents the putative template for reverse transcription (pregenome). Its structure predicts a strategy of replication of hepatitis B viruses different from that of retroviruses."
https://openalex.org/W1561753405,"Protein kinase C catalyzes phosphorylation of purified rat brain guanylate cyclase. The phosphorylation is marked by concomitant increase in guanylate cyclase activity. TPA further enhances both phosphorylation and activity of guanylate cyclase. Data seem to provide clues to the molecular mechanism of one of the transformation-like responses mimicked by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, i.e. the elevation of cyclic GMP. It is envisaged that protein kinase C may have a central role in the understanding of molecular events triggering carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1727796232,"We recently demonstrated that heterologous desensitization of adenylate cyclase in turkey erythrocytes is highly correlated with phosphorylation of the beta-adrenergic receptor. In contrast, little is known of the biochemical mechanisms underlying the homologous form of beta-adrenergic receptor desensitization, which is agonist-specific and not cAMP-mediated. Accordingly, the present studies were undertaken to examine if phosphorylation of the beta-adrenergic receptor is also associated with this form of desensitization in a well studied model system, the frog erythrocyte. Preincubation of these cells with the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol leads to a 45% decline in isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity without significant changes in basal, prostaglandin E1-, NaF-, guanyl-5'-yl-imidodiphosphate-, forskolin-, or MnCl2-stimulated enzyme activities. There is also a 48% decline in [125I]iodocyanopindolol membrane binding sites. Conversely, preincubation of the cells with prostaglandin E1 attenuates only the prostaglandin E1-stimulated enzyme activity and does not affect [125I]iodocyanopindolol binding. Phosphorylation of the beta-adrenergic receptor was assessed by preincubating the cells with 32Pi and desensitizing them, and subsequently purifying the receptors by affinity chromatography. Under basal conditions there is about 0.62 mol of phosphate/mol of receptor whereas after desensitization with isoproterenol this increases to 1.9 mol/mol. This isoproterenol-induced receptor phosphorylation exhibits stereospecificity and is blocked by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol. In addition, preincubation with prostaglandin E1 does not promote beta-adrenergic receptor phosphorylation. These data suggest that receptor phosphorylation is involved in homologous as well as heterologous forms of desensitization and may provide a unifying mechanism for desensitization of adenylate cyclase-coupled hormone receptors."

Here we describe the isolation and chemical characterization of lipid-linked precursors of these saccharides, and these have the following new features. Rather than the bacterial undecaprenol, a C60-dolichol is the carrier lipid. The oligosaccharide is bound to this lipid via a monophosphate, rather than a pyrophosphate bridge. Sulfation of the saccharides is completed while they are linked to lipid and does not occur after transfer of the saccharides to protein."
https://openalex.org/W1588129438,"Although the mechanism by which nicotinic receptors on adrenal chromaffin cells regulate catecholamine secretion is reasonably well understood, that of the muscarinic receptors remains obscure. The effects of both acetylcholine and specific muscarinic agonists on cytosolic free calcium in isolated bovine adrenal chromaffin cells have been measured using the fluorescent probe Quin-2. Acetylcholine (0.1 mM) evokes a large increase in cytosolic free calcium from resting levels near 100 nM into the microM range, most of which is blocked by hexamethonium (0.5 mM) or removal of extracellular calcium. A small component of the acetylcholine-evoked rise in cytosolic free calcium (approximately 50-100 nM) is independent of extracellular calcium and is unaffected by 0.5 mM hexamethonium, but is totally blocked by 0.5 microM atropine. The muscarinic nature of this component is further confirmed by the fact that the muscarinic agonists, muscarine (0.1 mM) and methacholine (0.3 mM), stimulate a 50-100 nM rise in chromaffin cell cytosolic calcium which is blocked by 0.5 microM atropine and is largely independent of extracellular calcium. These results suggest that muscarinic receptors regulate cytosolic calcium in chromaffin cells by a new mechanism different from that of nicotinic receptors, a mechanism utilizing an intracellular calcium source. The small size of the muscarinic-induced rise in cytosolic calcium in the bovine chromaffin cell would explain why no secretion is evoked by muscarinic agonists in this species."

https://openalex.org/W1550214875,"Plasma fibronectin is covalently incorporated into alpha-chains of fibrin gels in the presence of Factor XIII activated by thrombin (FXIIIaT) but not by Factor XIII activated by the snake venom enzyme batroxobin (FXIIIaB). FXIIIaB catalyzes introduction of gamma-gamma cross-links in fibrin but cross-linked alpha-chains are not formed. In the presence of FXIIIaT, fibrin gels formed by batroxobin incorporated fibronectin and the alpha-chains are cross-linked indicating that FXIIIaB has a different substrate specificity from FXIIIaT. In the presence of FXIIIaT the incorporation of fibronectin approaches 1 mol/340 kDa unit weight of fibrin. Fibronectin when present in a fibrinogen thrombin mixture containing FXIII does not influence the clotting time of the system nor the release of fibrinopeptides. Incorporation of fibronectin is not appreciable before the gel point. This indicates that the polymerization and gelation of fibrinogen is essentially not perturbed by the presence of fibronectin and that fibrin in the gel matrix rather than the fibrin polymers formed prior to gel point is the preferred structure for fibronectin incorporation. Incorporation of fibronectin into fibrin gels during formation leads to an increase in turbidity and a small decrease in Ks (permeability coefficient). This suggests that the width of the strands in the gel increases as a result of fibronectin incorporation. Fibronectin is also incorporated into preformed gels having completely cross-linked gamma- and alpha-chains perhaps indicating that the sites in fibrin involved in fibronectin incorporation are different from those involved in fibrin cross-linking. FXIIIaT appeared to be adsorbed to fibrin gel matrix in the presence but not in the absence of calcium ions."
https://openalex.org/W1479702206,"The rate of oxidative phosphorylation was studied in rat liver mitochondria incubated with free Ca2+ concentrations that range from 10(-9) to 5 X 10(-6) M. The highest rate was observed between 0.5-1.0 microM Ca2+. ATP synthesis was measured by polarographic and spectrophotometric techniques and by uptake of radioactive inorganic phosphate. The concentration of Ca2+ at which maximal rates of ATP synthesis take place is modified by Mg2+ and phosphate. The dependence of oxidative phosphorylation on Ca2+ was observed with alpha-ketoglutarate, glutamate + malate, and succinate, but not with beta-hydroxybutyrate. At 10(-9) M Ca2+ there is a continuous exit of endogenous Ca2+, while with 10(-6) M Ca2+, intramitochondrial Ca2+ levels remained constant throughout time. Apparently the control of the level of internal Ca2+ by external Ca2+ modulates the rate of oxidative phosphorylation. Uncoupler-stimulated respiration also depends on Ca2+ concentration, even though at 10(-9) to 10(-6) M Ca2+ the rate of oxidative phosphorylation is lower than the rate of uncoupled respiration. The contribution of the ADP/ATP carrier and the ATP synthase to the kinetic regulation of ATP synthesis at 10(-9) and 10(-6) M Ca2+ was evaluated by titrations with carboxyatractyloside and oligomycin, respectively. The contribution of the carrier and the synthase to the regulation of the final rate of ATP synthesis was different at the two concentrations of Ca2+; therefore, the concentration of extramitochondrial Ca2+ influences the overall kinetics of oxidative phosphorylation."

https://openalex.org/W1489623767,"We describe the characterization of KtrII, a novel potassium transport system of Streptococcus faecalis, first discovered by H. Kobayashi [1982) J. Bacteriol. 150, 506-511). KtrII requires sodium ions and mediates the stoichiometric exchange of internal Na+ for external K+. Potassium accumulation is not energized by the electrochemical potentials of either H+ or Na+; the energy source is probably ATP. Two lines of evidence indicate that KtrII is a manifestation of the sodium-stimulated ATPase reported earlier (Heefner, D. L., and Harold, F. M. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 79, 2798-2802). (i) Mutants that lack the ATPase also lack KtrII, and revertants recover both in parallel. (ii) KtrII and the Na+-ATPase are induced in parallel when cells are grown on media rich in sodium, particularly under conditions that limit the generation of a proton potential. KtrII is not induced in response to K+ deprivation. We propose that the Na+-ATPase exchanges Na+ for K+ ions."

Rat and mouse complementary DNA and genomic clones encoding the thy-1 molecule have been isolated and sequenced. These studies have enabled us to determine the intron-exon organization of the thy-1 gene. Furthermore, they have revealed the existence of a sequence which would encode an extra segment (31 amino acids) at the carboxyl terminus of the thy-1 molecule. These extra amino acids include a 20-amino acid hydrophobic segment which may be responsible for integration of thy-1 within the plasma membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1595378465,"Transport of GSH was studied in isolated rat kidney cortical brush-border membrane vesicles in which gamma-glutamyltransferase had been inactivated by a specific affinity labeling reagent, L-(alpha S,5S)-alpha-amino-3-chloro-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazoleacetic acid (AT-125). Transport of intact 2-3H-glycine-labeled GSH occurred into an osmotically active intravesicular space of AT-125-treated membranes. The initial rate of transport followed saturation kinetics with respect to GSH concentrations; an apparent Km of 0.21 mM and Vmax of 0.23 nmol/mg protein X 20 were calculated at 25 degrees C with a 0.1 M NaCl gradient (vesicle inside less than vesicle outside). Sodium chloride in the transport medium could be replaced with KCl without affecting transport activity. The rate of GSH uptake was enhanced by replacing KCl in the transport medium with K2SO4, providing a less permeant anion, and was reduced by replacing KCl with KSCN, providing a more permeant anion. The rate of GSH transport markedly decreased in the absence of a K+ gradient across the vesicular membranes and was enhanced by a valinomycin-induced K+ diffusion potential (vesicle-inside-positive). These results indicate that GSH transport is dependent on membrane potential and involves the transfer of negative charge. The rate of GSH transport was inhibited by S-benzyl glutathione but not by glycine, glutamic acid, and gamma-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide. When incubated with [2-3H]glycine-labeled GSH, intact untreated vesicles also accumulated radioactivity; the rate of uptake was significantly higher in a Na+ gradient than in a K+ gradient. Sodium-dependent transport, but not sodium-independent uptake, was almost completely inhibited by a high concentration of unlabeled glycine. At equilibrium, most of the radioactivity which accumulated in the intravesicular space was accounted for by free glycine. These results suggest that GSH which is secreted into the tubular lumen by a specific translocase in the lumenal membranes or filtered by the glomerulus may be degraded in situ by membranous gamma-glutamyltransferase and peptidase activities which hydrolyze peptide bonds of cysteinylglycine and its derivatives. The resulting free amino acids can be reabsorbed into tubule cells by sodium-dependent transport systems in renal cortical brush-border membranes."

https://openalex.org/W1551789762,"Tyrosine 3-monooxygenase activity of the crude extract from rat striatum had a sharp pH optimum at pH 5.4 and showed almost no activity at or above pH 7. When the crude extract was partially purified by pH precipitation and chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, the enzyme showed a high activity in the pH range of 5.8 to 7.4. Incubation of the partially purified enzyme with catecholamines such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine resulted in a remarkable decrease in the enzyme activity, as assayed at a neutral pH. This suppression of the enzyme activity by catecholamines differed from the well-known feedback inhibition which is competitive with respect to the pterin cofactor; the former occurred at a very much lower concentration of catecholamines even in the presence of a near-saturating concentration of a pterin cofactor, and the former was a time-dependent reaction. The enzyme, the activity of which had been suppressed by the incubation with dopamine, was remarkably activated by the incubation with the catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase in the presence of an ATP-generating system. These results suggest that the activity of tyrosine 3-monooxygenase may be suppressed by its end products in a normal state and it may be stimulated by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase as occasion demands."
https://openalex.org/W2104614778,"Clostridium kluyveri incorporates selenium as selenomethionine into its acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase when grown in media containing normal sulfur-to-selenium ratios. Antibodies raised against the purified enzyme permitted quantitative immunoprecipitation of thiolase from crude cell extracts and thus facilitated the systematic analysis of the effects of wide variation in sulfur-to-selenium ratios on selenium incorporation into the enzyme. The extent of incorporation of selenium into thiolase was found to be dependent on the form of selenium supplied. When [75Se]selenomethionine was the source of selenium, the incorporation of selenium into thiolase was inversely proportional to the level of added methionine. However, similar levels of methionine failed to decrease the incorporation of selenium from selenite. To study the location of selenomethionine and methionine residues in the polypeptide chain of the enzyme, thiolase was prepared from cells cultured in the presence of H2 35SO4 or Na2 75SeO3. The 35S- or 75Se-labeled protein was treated with trypsin and the resulting peptides were isolated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. The peptide maps of the enzyme indicated that selenium was distributed throughout the primary structure in a manner that paralleled methionine. From these studies, it is concluded that selenium occurs in thiolase adventitiously and is not required for any biological function."

Over the entire pH range, 2 eq are required per mol of FAD in D-amino acid oxidase for reduction to the anion dihydroquinone. The red anion semiquinone is thermodynamically stable as indicated by the separation of the electron potentials and the quantitative formation of the semiquinone species. The first electron potential is pH-independent at -0.098 +/- 0.004 V versus SHE while the second electron potential is pH-dependent exhibiting a 0.060 mV/pH unit slope. The redox behavior of D-amino acid oxidase is consistent with that observed for other oxidase enzymes. On the other hand, the behavior of the benzoate-bound enzyme under the same conditions is in marked contrast to the thermodynamics of free D-amino acid oxidase. Spectroelectrochemical experiments performed on inhibitor-bound (benzoate) D-amino acid oxidase show that benzoate binding regulates the redox properties of the enzyme, causing the energy levels of the benzoate-bound enzyme to be consistent with the two-electron transfer catalytic function of the enzyme. Our data are consistent with benzoate binding at the enzyme active site destroying the inductive effect of the positively charged arginine residue. Others have postulated that this positively charged group near the N(1)C(2) = O position of the flavin controls the enzyme properties. The data presented here are the clearest examples yet of enzyme regulation by substrate which may be a general characteristic of all flavoprotein oxidases."

Poly(A+) mRNA is rapidly lost from these polysomes, and 80 S monomers are left attached to the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum. Binding studies and measurements of intracellular colchicine concentrations indicate that the drug is acting via depolymerization of cytoplasmic microtubules. The vinca alkaloids, vincristine and vinblastine, have the same effect on polyribosomes, whereas lumicolchicine is ineffective. Furthermore, cordycepin and actinomycin D are without effect on polyribosomes indicating that colchicine is not simply inhibiting the production or transport of new mRNA. It appears that disruption of the cytoplasmic microtubule network prevents membrane-associated ribosomes from reinitiating protein synthesis resulting in the rapid loss of mRNA."

Transcription of aroF and aroG is repressed by the tyrR gene product complexed to tyrosine or phenylalanine, respectively. Constitutive aroF mutants with lesions linked to aroF were isolated. The nucleotide sequences in the regulatory regions of aroF from six such mutants and from the parental wild type strain were determined. The mutations were found in two 18-base pair imperfect palindromes, called aroFo1 and aroFo2, which are located upstream of the aroF transcription start by 61 and 113 base pairs, respectively. Nuclease S1 mapping and analysis of in vitro run-off transcripts identified the 5'-end of the aroF transcript 51 base pairs upstream of the aroF translation start. The -35 region of the aroF promoter overlaps aroFo1. The aroFo1 and aroFo2 sequences are homologous to a single 18-base pair DNA segment preceding the coding sequence of aroG."

Three additional non-interacting Mn2+-binding sites were found with a Kd of 46.7 +/- 2.3 microM. Chemical modification with naphthylglyoxal of 1 arginyl residue/chloroplast coupling factor 1, which inhibited ATPase activity, inhibited the cooperativity among the sites but did not prevent Mn2+ binding to the enzyme. It is suggested that the cooperative interaction among the Mn2+-binding sites is an expression of the interaction among the active sites of the enzyme which is required for catalysis."

https://openalex.org/W1489258399,"The effect of thiol oxidants on the light-activated H+-ATPase has been studied in freshly broken and intact chloroplasts. The following observations were made: (i) in chloroplasts which are osmotically shocked after light activation, ferricyanide stimulates the deactivation of the enzyme in the dark, but has little effect in the light; (ii) similarly, o-iodosobenzoate is a most efficient deactivator of the ATPase in intact chloroplasts in the dark but not in the light; (iii) the activated ATPase becomes sensitive to oxidants in the light upon the addition of an uncoupler; (iv) the oxidant-induced deactivation in the dark dominates the stabilizing effect of pyrophosphate or ADP plus Mg2+; (v) full deactivation of the ATPase by dark adaptation or by oxidants does not affect the rate of photophosphorylation under saturating conditions. A model is suggested in which two kinds of conformational changes are involved in the regulation of the ATPase: those induced by the trans-membrane-proton gradient and those by oxidation-reduction of the enzyme. These changes result in the preferential interaction with thiol reductants in the light but with thiol oxidants in the dark."
https://openalex.org/W1496408191,"Abstract A method has been developed for the effective inactivation of bovine heart mitochondrial F1-ATPase (MF1) by partially dissociating its subunits with 3 M LiCl at 0 degree C and for the subsequent partial restoration of its ATPase activity by making the subunits reassociate upon the removal of LiCl by centrifugal gel filtration at room temperature through Sephadex G-25-80 which has been pre-equilibrated with buffer containing 3 mM ATP. When covalently labeled MF1 with approximately one 7-[4-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole] label/MF1 was subjected to this type of partial dissociation-reassociation treatment, its ATPase activity could be increased from 1.48 to 18.0 mumol of ATP min-1 mg-1 without losing the covalent label. The experimental results are incompatible with models for F1-ATPase with either 3 or 2 equivalent alternating catalytic sites, but are consistent with the model with 1 active catalytic site and 2 interacting regulatory sites."
https://openalex.org/W1574492501,"We have developed a technique in which transglutaminase is used to measure the penetration of terminal complement proteins across the erythrocyte membrane into the cytoplasmic space. Penetration of a given terminal complement protein into the cytoplasmic space was assessed by labeling the protein of interest with radioactive iodine, forming the complement channel using the labeled protein, adding transglutaminase to only one side of the membrane, and allowing the enzyme to cross-link the susceptible proteins on that side of the membrane. Cross-linking was assessed by measuring the increase in molecular weight of the appropriate molecule on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels under reducing conditions. The results of these experiments indicate that C8 and C9 are rapidly cross-linked to high molecular weight from either the interior or the exterior of the membrane. In order to determine whether the cross-linking mediated by enzyme on the interior was occurring from within the ghosts and not via enzyme that had leaked into the extracellular medium, experiments were performed with dimethylcasein in the extracellular medium. In the presence of this protein, cross-linking of C8 and C9 from outside was negligible. Hence, if cross-linking occurs when transglutaminase is trapped inside the ghosts, it cannot be due to leakage of enzyme, but must be attributable to cross-linking from the inside. The results show that C9 definitely penetrated across the membrane into the intracellular space. With respect to C8, statistical evaluation indicates that C8 probably penetrated into the intracellular space."
https://openalex.org/W1527494548,"The steady-state distribution of inorganic phosphate and malate between the intra- and extramitochondrial spaces was measured in suspensions of nonrespiring and respiring rat liver mitochondria in which the transmembrane pH difference was incrementally varied. In respiration-inhibited mitochondria, the slope of log [Pi]in/[Pi]out (ordinate) versus delta pH approached 2 by either chemical or isotopic determination of [Pi], and the slope of log [malate]in/[malate]out versus delta pH was 2.0 with an extrapolated log [Pi]in/[Pi]out value of 0.3 at delta pH = 0. We conclude that the distribution of Pi and malate for nonrespiring mitochondria were quantitatively consistent with those predicted by exchange of Pi- for OH- (or cotransport with H+) and of malate 2- for Pi2-. In respiring mitochondria using glutamate + malate as substrate, there was very little pH dependence of Pi or malate accumulation (the slopes were less than 0.5) unless n-butylmalonate (inhibitor of Pi-dicarboxylate exchange) was added before the glutamate and malate, in which case the distribution patterns at delta pH less than 0.4 were similar to those in nonrespiring mitochondria. In either case, however, after reaching a maximal value of 1.1, log [Pi]in/[Pi]out did not further increase with increasing delta pH. Thus, in normally metabolizing mitochondria, the distributions of Pi and malate are not directly correlated with the difference in pH across the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1608762696,"Urinary acidification by the turtle bladder is mediated by a proton ATPase located in the apical membrane. The present study describes a proton ATPase in the plasma membrane of a cell line of turtle bladder epithelial cells. In the presence of ouabain to inhibit Na+,K+-ATPase and in the absence of Ca2+ to inhibit Ca2+-ATPase, we measured ATPase activity of the plasma membranes of the cultured cells. This ATPase was resistant to oligomycin but sensitive to dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, N-ethylmaleimide, and vanadate. In the presence of ATP, the ATPase was capable of acidification as assessed by quenching of acridine orange. Acidification could not be elicited by other nucleotides (GTP, UTP). Acidification was inhibited by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, N-ethylmaleimide, and vanadate but was not affected by replacement of Na+ by K+. The acidification response was dependent on the presence of chloride, abolished in the presence of gluconate, and inhibited partially by nitrate. Experiments utilizing the voltage-sensitive dye 3,3'-dipropylthiodicarbocyanine iodide showed that the proton ATPase was electrogenic and capable of responding to a favorable electric gradient. In summary, the turtle bladder epithelial cell line has a plasma membrane proton ATPase which is similar to the proton ATPase of turtle bladder epithelium and thus should allow purification and characterization of this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1573335877,"The short-term regulation of rat liver acetyl-CoA carboxylase by glucagon has been studied in hepatocytes from rats that had been fasted and refed a fat-free diet. Glucagon inhibition of the activity of this enzyme can be accounted for by a direct correlation between phosphorylation, polymer-protomer ratio, and activity. Glucagon rapidly inactivates acetyl-CoA carboxylase with an accompanying 4-fold increase in the phosphorylation of the enzyme and 3-fold increase in the protomer-polymer ratio of enzyme protein. Citrate, an allosteric activator of acetyl-CoA carboxylase required for enzyme activity, has no effect on these phenomena, indicating a mechanism that is independent of citrate concentration within the cell. The observation of these effects of glucagon on acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity is absolutely dependent upon the minimization of proteolytic degradation of the enzyme after cell lysis. Therefore, for the first time, an interrelationship has been demonstrated between phosphorylation, protomer-polymer ratio, and citrate for the inactivation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase by glucagon."

https://openalex.org/W1595782647,"A glutamic acid residue at the active site of bovine lung angiotensin I-converting enzyme, a zinc-metallo peptidyl dipeptidase, was esterified with p-[N,N-bis(chloroethyl)amino]phenylbutyryl-L-[U-14C]proline (chlorambucyl-L-[U-14C]-L-proline), an affinity label for this enzyme (Harris, R.B., and Wilson, I.B. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 1357-1362). The radiolabeled enzyme was digested with BrCN and only 1 of the 30 cleavage peptides resolved by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) contained the bound radiolabel. This active-site peptide (Mr = 16,000) was digested with trypsin and the labeled peptide formed (T-2) was further degraded with thermolysin. The thermolytic peptides were resolved by reverse-phase HPLC. Only 1 of the 5 peptides obtained (Th-1, Mr = 1290) contained the bound radiolabel. Th-1 (12 residues) was subjected to manual Edman degradation and the following partial sequence was determined: H2N-Phe-Thr-Glu-Leu-Ala-Asp-Ser-Glu... The radiolabel was released at cycle 3 and the amount recovered was equivalent to the amount of phenylthiohydantoin-Glu detected on HPLC. Thus, glutamic acid is esterified with chlorambucyl-L-[U-14C]proline in confirmation of our earlier findings. The sequence determined is homologous in 5 residues with the corresponding sequences of bovine carboxypeptidase A and B, two other mammalian zinc proteases. There is little sequence homology with thermolysin, a bacterial zinc protease that also contains an essential active-site glutamic acid residue."
