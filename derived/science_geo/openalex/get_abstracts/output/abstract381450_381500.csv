https://openalex.org/W2082294379,"Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect In addition to the Hall effect, which appears as a voltage change in conductors in response to an external magnetic field, ferromagnets exhibit the anomalous Hall effect, which is often proportional to their magnetization and independent of the presence of the magnetic field. This effect, first observed more than a century ago, has not been realized in its quantized form. Yu et al. (p. 61 , published online 3 June) propose a realization of a quantum anomalous Hall system by magnetically doping thin films of three-dimensional topological insulators and calculate the effects of various dopants and film thicknesses. The resulting insulators are predicted to have long-range ferromagnetic order, potentially joining dilute magnetic semiconductors as candidates for spintronic applications."

So far, its large-scale use has not been required, but, despite this, resistance has emerged in seasonal strains mediated by a single point mutation of histidine to tyrosine in the 274 residue (H274Y) of neuraminidase. When the resistant virus was first discovered in 1998, it grew poorly, but by 2008 the virus was reinvigorated and the mutation had spread worldwide in seasonal influenza. So what happened that improved viral fitness so radically? Bloom et al. (p. 1272 ; see the Perspective by Holmes ) show that the H274Y mutation hinders the folding of the neuraminidase enzyme. In the more vigorous recent oseltamivir-resistant isolates, other mutations compensate for the deleterious effect of H274Y and restore fitness to the virus."

AT deficiency is the most common genetic cause of liver disease in childhood and can also lead to cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma in adulthood. Carbamazepine is a drug known to be well tolerated in humans that enhances the intracellular degradation process known as autophagy. Now, Hidvegi et al. (p. 229 , published online June 3; see the Perspective by Sifers ) show that carbamazepine can reduce the severity of liver disease in a mouse model of AT deficiency by enhancing the degradation of misfolded accumulated AT."
https://openalex.org/W2071580102,"The extinction of conditioned fear memories requires plasticity in the infralimbic medial prefrontal cortex (IL mPFC), but little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a key mediator of synaptic plasticity in multiple brain areas. In rats subjected to auditory fear conditioning, BDNF infused into the IL mPFC reduced conditioned fear for up to 48 hours, even in the absence of extinction training, which suggests that BDNF substituted for extinction. Similar to extinction, BDNF-induced reduction in fear required N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and did not erase the original fear memory. Rats failing to learn extinction showed reduced BDNF in hippocampal inputs to the IL mPFC, and augmenting BDNF in this pathway prevented extinction failure. Hence, boosting BDNF activity in hippocampal-infralimbic circuits may ameliorate disorders of learned fear."
https://openalex.org/W1982630991,"Selectively Spun Biaryl compounds, in which two phenyl rings are linked by a single bond, exhibit an interesting sort of chirality, termed atropisomerism. If bulky substituents block the mutual rotation of the rings about the linking bond, then two isomers can be isolated that differ only in the direction one ring has swiveled away from the plane of the other. This feature is useful in ligand design for asymmetric catalysis and also appears in a number of polycyclic natural products. However, selective synthesis of a single isomer is difficult. Gustafson et al. (p. 1251 ) now show that a simple tripeptide derivative acts as an efficient catalyst for this purpose, trapping a freely rotating precursor in one orientation through selective bromination; the large bromine substituents then inhibit further swiveling."
https://openalex.org/W1993801006,"Quantum Spin Liquid In antiferromagnets, the lowest-energy state is reached when neighboring spins on the underlying lattice point in opposite directions. Because of geometric constraints on some lattices (such as the two-dimensional triangular lattice), this magnetic ordering cannot be achieved even at temperatures close to absolute zero, and these compounds are predicted to be in a quantum spin liquid state. Yamashita et al. (p. 1246 ) measured the thermal conductivity of a recently identified candidate quantum spin liquid, the organic compound EtMe 3 Sb[Pd(dmit) 2 ] 2 , and characterized its lowest-lying excitations. Two types of excitations were observed: ballistically propagating gapless excitations and excitations associated with a finite spin gap. These results contribute to our understanding of this unusual state of matter, which is potentially relevant to other two-dimensional quantum systems."
https://openalex.org/W2095814622,"Decades of speculation about a warmer, wetter Mars climate in the planet's first billion years postulate a denser CO2-rich atmosphere than at present. Such an atmosphere should have led to the formation of outcrops rich in carbonate minerals, for which evidence has been sparse. Using the Mars Exploration Rover Spirit, we have now identified outcrops rich in magnesium-iron carbonate (16 to 34 weight percent) in the Columbia Hills of Gusev crater. Its composition approximates the average composition of the carbonate globules in martian meteorite ALH 84001. The Gusev carbonate probably precipitated from carbonate-bearing solutions under hydrothermal conditions at near-neutral pH in association with volcanic activity during the Noachian era."
https://openalex.org/W2049878511,"Reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD) may curb carbon emissions, but the consequences for fire hazard are poorly understood. By analyzing satellite-derived deforestation and fire data from the Brazilian Amazon, we show that fire occurrence has increased in 59% of the area that has experienced reduced deforestation rates. Differences in fire frequencies across two land-use gradients reveal that fire-free land-management can substantially reduce fire incidence by as much as 69%. If sustainable fire-free land-management of deforested areas is not adopted in the REDD mechanism, then the carbon savings achieved by avoiding deforestation may be partially negated by increased emissions from fires."
https://openalex.org/W1986488389,"Accelerated leukocyte telomere shortening has been previously associated to self-perceived stress and psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and mood disorders. We set out to investigate whether telomere length is affected in patients with anxiety disorders in which stress is a known risk factor. We also studied the effects of childhood and recent psychological distress on telomere length. We utilized samples from the nationally representative population-based Health 2000 Survey that was carried out between 2000-2001 in Finland to assess major public health problems and their determinants. We measured the relative telomere length of the peripheral blood cells by quantitative real-time PCR from 321 individuals with DSM-IV anxiety disorder or subthreshold diagnosis and 653 matched controls aged 30-87 years, who all had undergone the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. While telomere length did not differ significantly between cases and controls in the entire cohort, the older half of the anxiety disorder patients (48-87 years) exhibited significantly shorter telomeres than healthy controls of the same age (P = 0.013). Interestingly, shorter telomere length was also associated with a greater number of reported childhood adverse life events, among both the anxiety disorder cases and controls (P = 0.005). Childhood chronic or serious illness was the most significantly associated single event affecting telomere length at the adult age (P = 0.004). Self-reported current psychological distress did not affect telomere length. Our results suggest that childhood stress might lead to accelerated telomere shortening seen at the adult age. This finding has potentially important implications supporting the view that childhood adversities might have a considerable impact on well being later in life."
https://openalex.org/W2119980799,"A New Look at Old Data Although the full genome of Caenorhabditis elegans has been available for over 10 years, only a portion of the full-length messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and their expression through development has been analyzed. By combining multiple methods, involving a careful reannotation of existing data sets, sequencing of poly-A captured RNAs from multiple developmental stages, as well as cloning and deep sequencing of a subset of genes, Mangone et al. (p. 432 , published online 3 June) defined ∼26,000 distinct mRNA three-prime untranslated regions (3′UTRs) for ∼85% of the protein-coding genes. Most C. elegans genes have more than one 3′UTR, arising through different mechanisms including trans-splicing–coupled cleavage and polyadenylation. The work highlights the importance of the 3'UTRs in the regulation of mRNA stability and translation."

Regulation by this second messenger has been associated with virulence traits, biofilm formation, and antibiotic tolerance. Christen et al. (p. 1295 ) engineered fluorescence resonance energy transfer–based sensors that enabled the visualization of c-di-GMP fluctuations in individual bacterial cells. Using the sensor, c-di-GMP distribution was found to change during the cell cycle in Caulobacter crescentus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells."
https://openalex.org/W2092332428,"The understanding of natural and sexual selection requires both field and laboratory studies to exploit the advantages and avoid the disadvantages of each approach. However, studies have tended to be polarized among the types of organisms studied, with vertebrates studied in the field and invertebrates in the lab. We used video monitoring combined with DNA profiling of all of the members of a wild population of field crickets across two generations to capture the factors predicting the reproductive success of males and females. The factors that predict a male's success in gaining mates differ from those that predict how many offspring he has. We confirm the fundamental prediction that males vary more in their reproductive success than females, and we find that females as well as males leave more offspring when they mate with more partners."

https://openalex.org/W2140692632,"The hair follicle is a cyclic biological system that progresses through stages of growth, regression, and quiescence, which involves dynamic changes in a program of gene regulation. Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are critically important for the control of gene expression and silencing. Here, we show that global miRNA expression in the skin markedly changes during distinct stages of the hair cycle in mice. Furthermore, we show that expression of miR-31 markedly increases during anagen and decreases during catagen and telogen. Administration of antisense miR-31 inhibitor into mouse skin during the early- and midanagen phases of the hair cycle results in accelerated anagen development, and altered differentiation of hair matrix keratinocytes and hair shaft formation. Microarray, qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses revealed that miR-31 negatively regulates expression of Fgf10, the components of Wnt and BMP signaling pathways Sclerostin and BAMBI, and Dlx3 transcription factor, as well as selected keratin genes, both in vitro and in vivo. Using luciferase reporter assay, we show that Krt16, Krt17, Dlx3, and Fgf10 serve as direct miR-31 targets. Thus, by targeting a number of growth regulatory molecules and cytoskeletal proteins, miR-31 is involved in establishing an optimal balance of gene expression in the hair follicle required for its proper growth and hair fiber formation.—Mardaryev, A.

https://openalex.org/W2078652111,"The Past Looks Hazy During the first couple of billion years of Earth's history, the Sun is thought to have been 30% less luminous than today, yet the surface of the planet was warm enough to prevent glacier formation and for early life to become established. Why were temperatures so high, despite the lower flux of solar energy? Wolf and Toon (p. 1266 ; see the Perspective by Chyba ) propose that the presence of a photochemical haze with a fractal size distribution was the reason. Such a haze, unlike one composed of spherical particles assumed in previous models, could have been opaque enough to block ultraviolet radiation that would have hindered or prevented life from arising, but transparent enough in the shorter wavelengths to keep the atmosphere warm."
https://openalex.org/W2034561062,"The tumor suppressor PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) is a lipid phosphatase that converts PIP3 into PIP2 and downregulates the kinase AKT and its proliferative and anti-apoptotic activities. The FoxO transcription factors are PTEN downstream effectors whose activity is negatively regulated by AKT-mediated phosphorylation. PTEN activity is frequently lost in many types of cancer, leading to increased cell survival and cell cycle progression.Here we characterize the widely expressed miR-22 and report that miR-22 is a novel regulatory molecule in the PTEN/AKT pathway. miR-22 downregulates PTEN levels acting directly through a specific site on PTEN 3'UTR. Interestingly, miR-22 itself is upregulated by AKT, suggesting that miR-22 forms a feed-forward circuit in this pathway. Time-resolved live imaging of AKT-dependent FoxO1 phosphorylation revealed that miR-22 accelerated AKT activity upon growth factor stimulation, and attenuated its down regulation by serum withdrawal.Our results suggest that miR-22 acts to fine-tune the dynamics of PTEN/AKT/FoxO1 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2098337487,"Chronic cocaine use is associated with disrupted dopaminergic neurotransmission but how this disruption affects overall brain function (other than reward/motivation) is yet to be fully investigated. Here we test the hypothesis that cocaine addicted subjects will have disrupted functional connectivity between the midbrain (where dopamine neurons are located) and cortical and subcortical brain regions during the performance of a sustained attention task.We measured brain activation and functional connectivity with fMRI in 20 cocaine abusers and 20 matched controls. When compared to controls, cocaine abusers had lower positive functional connectivity of midbrain with thalamus, cerebellum, and rostral cingulate, and this was associated with decreased activation in thalamus and cerebellum and enhanced deactivation in rostral cingulate.These findings suggest that decreased functional connectivity of the midbrain interferes with the activation and deactivation signals associated with sustained attention in cocaine addicts."

Endothelial cells (EC) have a critical function in recruitment of immune cells, and proinflammatory cytokines drive the specific expression of several adhesion proteins. During inflammatory responses several cells produce hyaluronan matrices that promote monocyte/macrophage adhesion through interactions with the hyaluronan receptor CD44 present on inflammatory cell surfaces. In this study, we used human umbilical chord vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as a model to study the mechanism that regulates hyaluronan synthesis after treatment with proinflammatory cytokines.

Moreover, in the media and neointima, HA exerts a proatherosclerotic effect by promoting adhesion of immune cells and by recruiting monocytes/macrophages (5Vigetti D. Rizzi M. Viola M. Karousou E.

The molecular mechanism involved in the interaction of immune cells with HA depends on CD44. Interestingly, the organization of HA in the extracellular matrix has a critical role in this process, and cells subjected to various stresses (endoplasmic reticulum stress, viral stimulus, and hyperglycemia) synthesize HA cable-like structures that interact with CD44 on monocyte surfaces and mediate adhesion (6Hascall V.C. Majors A.K. De La Motte C.A. Evanko S.P. Wang A. Drazba J.A. Strong S.A. Wight T.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1673: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The organization of the HA cable structure largely is unknown and can contain additional molecules, including versican and the covalently linked heavy chains transferred from the chondroitin sulfate chain in inter-α-trypsin inhibitor to HA catalyzed by tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α)-induced protein 6 (7Selbi W. de la Motte C.A.

The recruited monocytes/macrophages are required to remove this abnormal matrix, and CD44 also is required. Mice null in CD44 do not survive a bleomycin-induced inflammation in the lung due to the continued accumulation of HA extracellular matrix and despite continued influx of monocytes/macrophages (8Jiang D.

Med. 2005; 11: 1173-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). Interestingly, dividing cells in hyperglycemia initiate HA synthesis in intracellular compartments (endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi/transport vesicles), which induces autophagy and cyclin D3 responses that initiate formation of HA cable structures after completion of cell division (9Ren J. Hascall V.C. Wang A. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 16621-16632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This suggests that HA synthases located in these intracellular compartments can be activated and utilize the UDP-sugar substrates in the cytosol during HAS transport to and/or from the plasma membrane where it is normally active (6Hascall V.C.

Such HA cables have been described both in vitro and in vivo and appear to be associated to smooth muscle cells in gut mucosa of Crohn disease patients, in the lung of asthmatic patients, and in glomeruli of kidneys in the streptozotocin diabetic rat model (6Hascall V.C.

However, immune cells that circulate in the bloodstream have to cross the endothelium to reach the inflamed sites. Therefore, the role of endothelial cells is critical to “capture” circulating inflammatory cells only at specific sites where the immune response is required through interactions with cell membrane structures. Proinflammatory mediators, including TNF-α and interleukin 1β (IL-1β), significantly alter expression of adhesion molecules on EC surfaces that determine the tethering, rolling, activation, arrest, and extravasation (diapedesis) of leukocytes from the bloodstream into the inflamed tissue. This complex set of successive events depends on many proteins (i.e. selectins and integrins) expressed on both ECs and the immune cells (12Mantovani A. Bussolino F. Dejana E. FASEB. J. 1992; 6: 2591-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 13Pober J.S. Cotran R.S. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 427-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). In addition, HA is known to have a critical role in this process (14Day A.J. de la Motte C.A. Trends Immunol. 2005; 26: 637-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Interaction of leukocyte CD44 with HA on the EC surface determines their adhesion and activation (15Johnson P. Ruffell B. Inflamm Allergy Drug Targets. 2009; 8: 208-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ECs normally synthesize very little HA, whereas its production dramatically increases after stimulation by proinflammatory cytokines (16Mohamadzadeh M. DeGrendele H. Arizpe H. Estess P. Siegelman M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). However, evidence for HA cable formation in ECs is lacking, and our data support a model in which EC synthesis of HA forms a structure bound to CD44 on the EC surface that can be recognized by CD44 on immune cells (17Ruffell B. Johnson P. Hascall V.C. Yanagishita M. Toole B.P. Science of Hyaluronan Today. 2009Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which ECs increase HA synthesis at the molecular level and identify the pathway involved in this process. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were purchased from Lonza and were grown for 2–6 passages in EGM2 culture medium (Lonza) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cultures were maintained in an atmosphere of humidified 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Six h before treatments, subconfluent HUVECs were cultured in EGM2 with 1% fetal bovine serum. The medium was then changed to EGM2 plus 10% fetal bovine serum with 5 μg/ml of IL-1β (Peprotech), or 0.1 μg/ml of TNF-α (Euroclone), or 0.3 μg/ml of TNF-β (Euroclone), or 1 μg/ml of tumor growth factor α (TGF-α Euroclone), or 0.01 μg/ml of tumor growth factor β (TGF-β, Euroclone) and incubated for 24 h. In some experiments, 2 μm (final concentration) of pyrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC, Sigma) was added to the cells. By using these cytokine concentrations, we did not measure any mortality effects detected by trypan blue staining (results not shown). HA and chondroitin sulfate released into the culture medium were quantified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of fluorophore-labeled saccharides (PAGE-FS) and by HPLC analyses as described previously (18Karousou E.G.

Briefly, proteins in the culture medium were digested with proteinase K, and the glycosaminoglycans were purified by ethanol precipitation. The specific unsaturated disaccharides of HA and chondroitin sulfate (ΔHA and ΔCS, respectively) were obtained by specific glycosidase digestions and derivatization with 2-aminoacridone. 2-Aminoacridone-labeled ΔHA and ΔCS disaccharides were separated and quantified by PAGE-FS or HPLC and normalized to the cell number.

To visualize HA, HUVECs were grown on glass coverslips and either untreated or treated with IL-1β.

After 48 h of incubation, the silencing efficiency was quantified by quantitative RT-PCR measuring the HAS2 mRNA transcript. Adhesion of U937 monocytes to HUVEC cultures was assayed as described previously (22de la Motte C.A. Hascall V.C. Drazba J. Bandyopadhyay S.K. Strong S.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 163: 121-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). 1 × 106 U937 monocytes were labeled with fluorescent green CytoTracker (Invitrogen) vital staining and plated on cytokine-treated or untreated HUVEC cultures followed by incubation at 4 °C for 30 min. After phosphate-buffered saline washing at 4 °C, the numbers of adherent cells were assessed under a fluorescent microscope (Olympus). As controls for binding to HA and CD44, HUVECs were pretreated with 2 units/μl of Streptomyces hyaluronidase (Seikagaku), or were incubated with monocytes in the presence of an antibody against CD44 (BRIC235, 5 μg/ml) that inhibits CD44/HA interaction, or were incubated with unrelated antibodies. Furthermore, monocytes were placed on HUVECs in the presence of 25 μg/ml high molecular mass HA (Healon, 4 × 106 Da) to compete with HA produced by treated cells. Statistical analysis of the data were done using analysis of variance, followed by post hoc tests (Bonferroni) using Origin 7.5 software (OriginLab). Probability values of p < 0.01 were considered statistically significant. Experiments were repeated three times each time in duplicate, and data are expressed as means ± S.E. One of the main roles of ECs in inflammation is to regulate recruitment of immune cells from the bloodstream into the inflamed site. This mechanism involves not only expression of adhesive molecules on EC surfaces but also a coordinated expression of the corresponding ligands on the circulating cells. Diffusible alerting molecules (i.e. cytokines) bind to EC receptors and drive the expression of specific adhesion proteins, selectins, and integrins. Cytokines such as IL-1β and TNF-α are among the common proinflammatory-alerting molecules that are synthesized by immune cells such as macrophages in response to infection in an early phase of the process. The pioneering works of Siegelmen’s research group clearly showed that HA is also involved in lymphocyte recruitment in vivo as well as in vitro (16Mohamadzadeh M. DeGrendele H. Arizpe H. Estess P. Siegelman M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 23DeGrendele H.C. Estess P. Picker L.J. Siegelman M.H. J. Exp.

Chem. 2000; 275: 14939-14948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Circulating leukocytes are activated by HA through CD44 interaction, whereas proinflammatory cytokines stimulate ECs to produce HA together with other well known adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. In our study, we focused on the mechanism of HA induction after IL-1β and TNF-α treatment. We used HUVECs because they are a convenient and broadly accepted artery EC model. After preliminary dose-response experiments, we found that a 24-h treatment of HUVEC cultures with 5 μg/ml of IL-1β induced a clear accumulation of HA secreted into the culture medium, which was quantitatively measured by PAGE-FS (Fig. 1A), and HA in the cell layer was qualitatively visualized by immunofluorescence (Fig. 1B). The band corresponding to HA disaccharides dramatically increased after IL-1β addition, whereas the bands corresponding to chondroitin sulfate disaccharides remained unchanged, indicating that IL-1β induces a specific alteration in the HA content without modifying chondroitin sulfate synthesis. The organization of HA in treated cells revealed a diffuse staining around HUVEC plasma membranes without showing the cable-like structures that are known to be adhesive toward monocytes in other cell models (6Hascall V.C. Majors A.K. De La Motte C.A. Evanko S.P. Wang A. Drazba J.A. Strong S.A. Wight T.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1673: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 14Day A.J. de la Motte C.A. Trends Immunol. 2005; 26: 637-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Moreover, analysis of the size of HA induced by IL-1β by agarose gel electrophoresis revealed the synthesis of a high molecular weight polymer of >2 × 106 Da (results not shown). Furthermore, we tested the responses of HUVECs to other proinflammatory cytokines (i.e. TNF-α and TNF-β) or to anti-inflammatory cytokines (i.e. TGF-α and TGF-β) (27Letterio J.J. Roberts A.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 137-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1658) Google Scholar). After preliminary dose-response experiments (data not shown), the proinflammatory TNF-α and TNF-β at plateau concentrations induced the highest HA secretion, ∼3.5-fold over control, whereas IL-1β increased HA ∼2-fold over control. In contrast, anti-inflammatory TGF-α and TGF-β treatments did not increase HA secretion over control (Fig. 2). These results suggest that macrovascular artery ECs, such as HUVECs, together with previously reported microvascular ECs (16Mohamadzadeh M. DeGrendele H. Arizpe H. Estess P. Siegelman M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), can respond to microenvironmental changes by activating HA synthesis after treatment with proinflammatory cytokines. Previous studies and our unpublished data have shown that HUVECs induce ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression after treatment with proinflammatory cytokines, whereas Mohamadzadeh et al. (16Mohamadzadeh M. DeGrendele H. Arizpe H. Estess P. Siegelman M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) reported that HUVECs did not increase HA synthesis after stimulation with 10 ng/ml of TNF-α or IL-1β for 4 h. These apparent differences in results can be explained considering the different cytokine concentrations and incubation times, as well as the different sensitivity of the HA quantification methods that we used in our experiments. Although the cytokine concentrations used in this study appear to be higher than physiological level, it was discussed elsewhere that as cytokines act locally, their concentration in vivo may be difficult to define and higher than expected (28Kaplan D. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 303-304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As the synthesis of HA depends on the activity of one or more of the three HA synthases, HAS1, -2, and -3, we measured their mRNA expression after cytokine treatments by using quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 3, A and B). As HAS protein only is present at low levels at the plasma membrane (29Rilla K. Siiskonen H. Spicer A.P. Hyttinen J.M. Tammi M.I. Tammi R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31890-31897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), quantitative assessment at the protein level remains a technical challenge and could not be performed in a reliable manner. HAS1 mRNA was not detected in HUVECs, whereas HAS2 and HAS3 mRNAs were present at similar levels. Interestingly, only HAS2 mRNA significantly increased, ∼7-fold after IL-1β treatment and ∼3-fold after TNF-α and TNF-β treatments. In contrast, HAS2 mRNA did not change after treatment with the anti-inflammatory cytokines. It should be noted that the induction of HAS2 mRNA and HA levels after the cytokine treatments did not match exactly. This could be due to an earlier expression of HAS2 that we did not detect after 24 h of incubation, whereas HA accumulates during the whole incubation time. HAS2 enzymes synthesize HA of high molecular weight in agreement with the size that we observed after IL-1β stimulation. These results indicate that increased HA in response to the proinflammatory cytokines is regulated by expression of HAS2. In addition, we measured the HA synthetic activity in purified plasma membrane vesicles (11Vigetti D. Genasetti A. Karousou E. Viola M. Clerici M. Bartolini B. Moretto P. De Luca G. Hascall V.C. Passi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 30684-30694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) isolated from control, IL-1β-, TNF-α-, and TNF-β-treated HUVEC cultures and found values of 22.4 ± 3, 91.1 ± 7, 78.9 ± 8, and 83.7 ± 5 pmol ΔHA/μg of protein/min, respectively. The cytokine treated cultures showed statistically significant increases ∼4-fold over control of HAS activity in purified plasma membranes, consistent with the increases in HA in the culture medium. Interestingly, the proinflammatory cytokine treatments induced similar HAS activities, whereas IL-1β induced a much greater HAS2 mRNA response than did TNF-α and TNF-β. Therefore, this activity increase was not related completely to HAS2 gene expression as shown in Fig. 3A, because cytokine treatments caused a different degree of HAS2 messenger accumulation. These data could suggest the existence of complex post-translational processing of HAS mRNA as has been shown for the stability of other TNF-α-induced transcripts (30Anderson P. Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 233-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Moreover, other additional factors, such as hyaluronidase activity and HA turnover could contribute to this issue. Previous data from TNF-α-treated lymph node ECs reported that increased HA synthesis did not involve a significant change in HAS gene expression (16Mohamadzadeh M. DeGrendele H. Arizpe H. Estess P. Siegelman M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). However, only HAS1 mRNA was investigated at that time as the other isoenzymes were just discovered, and their sequences were not available in public databases. A large body of evidence (31Pasparakis M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9: 778-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that many cellular responses to proinflammatory signals are mediated by NF-κB. This transcription factor normally is present in the cytoplasm in a complex with the protein IκBα that maintains NF-κB in an inactive state. IκBα phosphorylation, mediated by IκB kinase, induces a rapid degradation of IκBα via the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway, which leads to translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus and its transcriptional functions (31Pasparakis M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9: 778-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). IκB kinase activation can be induced by several stimuli including TNF receptors. Therefore, we investigated whether NF-κB is involved in the increased HAS2 transcript expression after proinflammatory cytokines treatment by using PDTC, a widely used chemical inhibitor of NF-κB (32Schreck R. Meier B. Männel D.N. Dröge W. Baeuerle P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3C, the simultaneous addition of IL-1β, or TNF-α, or TNF-β with PDTC caused a reduction of HAS2 transcription. Interestingly, in TNF-α- and TNF-β-treated cells, NF-κB inhibition inhibited HAS2 transcription to the level of control untreated cells. However, in IL-1β-treated cells, NF-κB inhibition did not lower HAS2 transcription to the level of control, which suggests a more complex mechanism of HAS2 transcription activation that could involve other factors in addition to NF-κB. In fact, in addition to NF-κB sites, the HAS2 promoter region contains putative binding sequences for other transcription factors (33Monslow J. Williams J.D. Fraser D.J. Michael D.R. Foka P. Kift-Morgan A.P. Luo D.D. Fielding C.A. Craig K.J. Topley N. Jones S.A. Ramji D.P. Bowen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18043-18050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A previous study on human synoviocytes found that PDTC inhibited HAS1 transcription after IL-1β stimulation, confirming the critical role of NF-κB in HA metabolism (34Kao J.J. Exp. Gerontol. 2006; 41: 641-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Interestingly, HA itself is able to modulate cytokine production via NF-κB, confirming its critical role in inflammation (35Campo G.M. Avenoso A. Campo S. D'Ascola A. Nastasi G. Calatroni A. Biochimie. 2010; 92: 204-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Because some of the effect of HA is to modulate adhesion of immune cells on microvascular ECs (16Mohamadzadeh M. DeGrendele H. Arizpe H. Estess P. Siegelman M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), we investigated whether monocyte adhesion to HUVECs after treatment with proinflammatory cytokines could be modulated by HA. Fig. 4A shows that IL-1β, TNF-α, and TNF-β increased the number of adherent monocytes ∼5-, ∼4-, and ∼3-fold, respectively. Furthermore, hyaluronidase treatment of HUVECs after IL-1β treatment decreased U937 monocyte binding to near control level (Fig. 4B). Moreover, the simultaneous addition of the monocytes with a pure HA preparation of high molecular weight (Healon) also inhibited binding. These data indicate the critical role of HA in monocytes adhesion in that removal of HA by hyaluronidase treatment as well as the competition with exogenous HA both reduced monocyte adhesion. This point is critical because lowering immune cell adhesion to vascular endothelium would reduce the number of inflammatory cells that reach an inflamed site, therefore reducing the inflammation. Several studies have highlighted the anti-inflammatory and protective effect of HA administered in an experimental model of restenosis (36Savani R.C. Turley E.A. Int. J. Tissue React. 1995; 17: 141-151PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in osteoarthritic joints injected with HA (37Miltner O. Schneider U. Siebert C.H. Niedhart C. Niethard F.U. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2002; 10: 680-686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism through which immune cells interact with HA is mainly mediated by CD44 (38Khan A.I. Kerfoot S.M. Heit B. Liu L. Andonegui G. Ruffell B. Johnson P. Kubes P. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 7594-7601Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To confirm CD44 involvement, we simultaneously added monocytes together with a monoclonal antibody against CD44 known to block HA/CD44 binding and found a clear reduction of monocytes adherent to IL-1β-treated HUVECs, whereas an unrelated control antibody did not modify adhesion (Fig. 4B). We also measured CD44 mRNA expression by quantitative RT-PCR. Interestingly, proinflammatory cytokine treatments induced a significant increase of CD44 mRNA in HUVEC cultures, whereas anti-inflammatory cytokines maintained control CD44 levels (Fig. 4C). This finding could support the hypothesis that CD44 on the plasma membrane of HUVECs binds HA and presents HA to CD44 on circulating immune cells that can attach and form a “sandwich” structure (17Ruffell B. Johnson P. Hascall V.C. Yanagishita M. Toole B.P. Science of Hyaluronan Today. 2009Google Scholar). Notably, in this model, HA could remain in a soluble form without forming cable structures, as we found from the immunofluorescent experiments (Fig. 1B). It is of note that a previous work using an immortalized HUVEC cell line (i.e. Ea.hy.926) found an inhibition of neutrophil-EC adhesion by HA independent of CD44 and probably involving ICAM-1 (39Alam C.A. Seed M.P. Freemantle C. Brown J. Perretti M. Carrier M. Divwedi A. West D.C. Gustafson S. Colville-Nash P.R. Willoughby D.A. Inflammopharmacology. 2005; 12: 535-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), suggesting that in vivo multiple HA-interacting proteins may modulate interactions of immune cells with endothelium. The main HAS isoform responsible for increased HA after treatment of HUVECs with proinflammatory cytokines was HAS2. Therefore, we assessed its involvement in monocyte binding by using an siRNA approach. HUVECs were transfected with commercial siRNA against HAS2 as well as with a scrambled control siRNA by using the Nucleofector apparatus to obtain a high transfection efficiency with a low mortality rate. After 24 h of incubation, nucleofected HUVECs were treated with or without IL-1β and incubated for 24 h. HUVEC cultures were then used for monocytes adhesion experiments or for RNA extraction and cDNA preparation. The effectiveness of HAS2 mRNA silencing was assessed with quantitative RT-PCR and, as shown in Fig. 5A, after IL-1β treatment, HAS2 siRNA-nucleofected cells greatly reduced HAS2 expression. Control siRNA with a random sequence did not perturb the HAS2 mRNA increase due to IL-1β treatment. In parallel cultures, siRNA of HAS2 completely inhibited U937 binding, whereas control siRNA did not alter the adhesive property of HUVECs after IL-1β treatment (Fig. 5B). Our results clearly demonstrate that HA synthesis in HUVECs is regulated strictly at the transcriptional level by proinflammatory cytokines. In vivo, this issue is of great importance, as HA can participate together with other adhesion molecules to recruitment of immune cells at inflamed sites. Although the generally accepted model foresees the formation of HA cables (6Hascall V.C. Majors A.K. De La Motte C.A. Evanko S.P. Wang A. Drazba J.A. Strong S.A. Wight T.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1673: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), we demonstrate that monocytes can bind to HA via CD44 without such filamentous structures, consistent with the recent model of Ruffell and Johnson (17Ruffell B. Johnson P. Hascall V.C. Yanagishita M. Toole B.P. Science of Hyaluronan Today. 2009Google Scholar). They proposed that HA can be maintained above the endothelium by CD44 on ECs, and leukocytes can bind to HA though their own CD44. Our findings highlight the critical role of HAS2 that could be involved to maintain the nascent HA chain tethered on EC surfaces. In vivo, this model can be modulated by other players that include other cell types, other molecules, and other microenvironmental conditions such as free radical presence, enzyme activity, and shear stress. In fact, recently it has been shown that platelets can produce hyaluronidase 2 that can fragment HA and generate bioactive oligosaccharides that can trigger many cellular responses involving all the vasculature (40de la Motte C. Nigro J. Vasanji A. Rho H. Kessler S. Bandyopadhyay S. Danese S. Fiocchi C. Stern R. Am. J. Pathol. 2009; 174: 2254-2264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In conclusion, in this work, we provide evidence at molecular and functional levels that HA synthesis can modulate immune cell adhesion on HUVECs that, in turn, could regulate inflammatory responses (Fig. 6). In fact, proinflammatory cytokines induce HA synthesis through the NF-κB mediated expression of HAS2 that modulates monocyte adhesion by CD44, which represents the first step to start an inflammatory process. The central role of NF-κB in inflammation is highlighted by the induction also of other adhesion molecules (such as CD44, ICAM-1, E-selectin, VCAM-1, and MHC class I) (41Mackay F. Loetscher H. Stueber D. Gehr G. Lesslauer W. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1277-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), which, in vivo, may orchestrate all of the inflammatory responses that include cell adhesion, rolling, extravasation, migration, and specific cellular activity. In light of this model, the clinical relevance of HA administration to ameliorate inflammation (42Ialenti A. Di Rosa M. Agents Actions. 1994; 43: 44-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) can be due to the competition with CD44 on ECs and leukocytes, thereby inhibiting the recruitment process.

https://openalex.org/W2114048115,"Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) studies from our laboratory and others described decreased natural killer cell cytotoxicity (NKCC) and elevated proportion of lymphocytes expressing the activation marker, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) also known as CD26. However, neither these assays nor other laboratory tests are widely accepted for the diagnosis or prognosis of CFS. This study sought to determine if NKCC or DPPIV/CD26 have diagnostic accuracy for CFS.Subjects included female and male CFS cases and healthy controls. NK cell function was measured with a bioassay, using K562 cells and (51)Cr release. Lymphocyte associated DPPIV/CD26 was assayed by qualitative and quantitative flow cytometry. Serum DPPIV/CD26 was measured by ELISA. Analysis by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve assessed biomarker potential. Cytotoxic function of NK cells for 176 CFS subjects was significantly lower than in the 230 controls. According to ROC analysis, NKCC was a good predictor of CFS status. There was no significant difference in NK cell counts between cases and controls. Percent CD2+ lymphocytes (T cells and NK cells) positive for DPPIV/C26 was elevated in CFS cases, but there was a decrease in the number of molecules (rMol) of DPPIV/C26 expressed on T cells and NK cells and a decrease in the soluble form of the enzyme in serum. Analyses by ROC curves indicated that all three measurements of DPPIV/CD26 demonstrated potential as biomarkers for CFS. None of the DPPIV/C26 assays were significantly correlated with NKCC.By ROC analysis, NKCC and three methods of measuring DPPIV/C26 examined in this study had potential as biomarkers for CFS. Of these, NKCC, %CD2+CD26+ lymphocytes and rMol CD26/CD2+ lymphocyte, required flow cytometry, fresh blood and access to a high complexity laboratory. Soluble DPPIV/C26 in serum is done with a standard ELISA assay, or with other soluble factors in a multiplex type of ELISA. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV on lymphocytes or in serum was not predictive of NKCC suggesting that these should be considered as non-redundant biomarkers. Abnormalities in DPPIV/CD26 and in NK cell function have particular relevance to the possible role of infection in the initiation and/or the persistence of CFS."

The agr pheromone has been thought to represent the master regulator of virulence in this pathogen, but it is not always expressed and is also found in many nonpathogenic cocci. A strictly conserved, nonribosomal peptide synthetase has now been found by Wyatt et al. (p. 294 , published online 3 June) by genome mining. The enzyme assembles valine and tyrosine into cyclic dipeptides called aureusimines that are expressed by all sequenced strains of S. aureus , including the “superbug” MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ). Microarray analysis showed a striking effect of mutation in the synthetase locus on the production of immunomodulators, hemolysins, and other exotoxins by the pathogen.

https://openalex.org/W1964718835,"Innate immune sensing of Staphylococcus aureus unravels basic mechanisms leading to either effective antibacterial immune responses or harmful inflammation. The nature and properties of S. aureus-derived pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMPs) are still not completely understood. We investigated the innate immune sensing of peptidoglycan (PGN) structures and subsequent immune consequences. Macromolecular PGN (PGNpolymer) preparations activated NF-κB through human Toll-like receptors 2 (TLR2), as shown by luciferase reporter assays, and induced murine dendritic cell (DC) maturation and cytokine production. In contrast, PGNpolymer from lgt-mutant S. aureus failed to stimulate human TLR2, demonstrating that lipoproteins within the macromolecular structures of PGNpolymer, but not PGN itself, activate TLR2. Thus, HPLC-purified monomeric PGN (PGNmonomer) structures were investigated. Strikingly, PGNmonomer completely lacked NF-κB activation, lacked TLR2 activity, and failed to functionally activate murine DCs. However, PGNmonomer in concert with various TLR ligands most effectively stimulated DCs to up-regulate IL-12p70 and IL-23 by ≥3- to 5-fold. Consequently, DCs coactivated by PGNmonomer markedly up-regulated Th1 and Th17 while suppressing Th2 cell priming. Notably, PGNmonomer failed to coactivate NOD2−/− DCs. This demonstrates that PGNmonomer is a natural ligand of NOD2, which was previously only demonstrated for synthetic compounds like muramyl dipeptide. Interestingly, murine DCs lacking TLR2 remained mute in response to the combinative immune sensing of S. aureus-derived PAMPs, including PGNmonomer, providing for the first time an explanation of why S. aureus can colonize the nasal mucosa in the absence of inflammation. This is very likely based on the lack of TLR2 expression in mucosal epithelial cells under normal conditions, which determines the unresponsiveness to S. aureus PAMPs.—Volz, T., Nega, M., Buschmann, J., Kaesler, S., Guenova, E., Peschel, A., Röcken, M., Götz, F., Biedermann, T.

https://openalex.org/W2053542749,"A role for Zn2+ in accelerating wound healing is established, yet, the signaling pathways linking Zn2+ to tissue repair are not well known. We show that in the human HaCaT keratinocytes extracellular Zn2+ induces a metabotropic Ca2+ response that is abolished by silencing the expression of the G-protein-coupled receptor GPR39, suggesting that this Zn2+-sensing receptor, ZnR, is mediating the response. Keratinocytic-ZnR signaling is highly selective for Zn2+ and can be triggered by nanomolar concentrations of this ion. Interestingly, Zn2+ was also released following cellular injury, as monitored by a specific non-permeable fluorescent Zn2+ probe, ZnAF-2. Chelation of Zn2+ and scavenging of ATP from conditioned medium, collected from injured epithelial cultures, was sufficient to eliminate the metabotropic Ca2+ signaling. The signaling triggered by Zn2+, via ZnR, or by ATP further activated MAP kinase and induced up-regulation of the sodium/proton exchanger NHE1 activity. Finally, activation of ZnR/GPR39 signaling or application of ATP enhanced keratinocytes scratch closure in an in vitro model. Thus our results indicate that extracellular Zn2+, which is either applied or released following injury, activates ZnR/GPR39 to promote signaling leading to epithelial repair.

IntroductionFollowing injury, keratinocytes are exposed to diverse extracellular stimuli such as growth factors, cytokines, and matrix components, resulting in stimulation of cellular proliferation and migration. The release of these factors at the wound site leads to renewal of the epithelial layer in the damaged area (1Jacinto A. Martinez-Arias A. Martin P. Nat.

In epidermal tissues, higher levels of zinc have been correlated with higher mitotic activity (21Rothstein J.D. Martin L. Levey A.I. Dykes-Hoberg M. Jin L. Wu D. Nash N. Kuncl R.W. Neuron. 1994; 13: 713-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1449) Google Scholar). It was further shown that application of Zn2+ accelerates the migration of keratinocytes via modulation of integrin receptors expression or interaction with metalloproteases (22Ravanti L. Kahari V.M. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2000; 6: 391-407PubMed Google Scholar, 23Pirila E. Korpi J.T. Korkiamaki T. Jahkola T. Gutierrez-Fernandez A. Lopez-Otin C. Saarialho-Kere U. Salo T. Sorsa T.

The effect of Zn2+ in enhancing cell proliferation is synergistic with intracellular Ca2+ rise, indicating that their effects are mediated through a common pathway (26Huang J.S. Mukherjee J.J. Chung T. Crilly K.S. Kiss Z. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 943-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 27Kiss Z. Crilly K.S. Tomono M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Importantly, Zn2+ affects cell proliferation rate prior to changes in its intracellular levels, suggesting that the extracellular Zn2+ pool mediates signaling leading to epithelial repair (28MacDonald R.S. Wollard-Biddle L.C. Browning J.D. Thornton Jr., W.H. O'Dell B.L. J. Nutr. 1998; 128: 1600-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).We have previously identified a Zn2+-sensing receptor (ZnR) active in keratinocytes and other epithelial cells (16Hershfinkel M. Silverman W.F. Sekler I. Mol. Med. 2007; 13: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 29Hershfinkel M. Moran A. Grossman N. Sekler I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 11749-11754Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). ZnR activity was manifested by robust increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations triggered by extracellular Zn2+ (29Hershfinkel M. Moran A. Grossman N. Sekler I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 11749-11754Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have found that in neurons ZnR activity is mediated by the G-protein-coupled receptor, GPR39 (30Besser L. Chorin E. Sekler I. Silverman W.F. Atkin S. Russell J.T. Hershfinkel M. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 2890-2901Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that a ZnR/GPR39 is activated in keratinocytes, by exogenous Zn2+ or by conditioned medium collected from injured cells, and up-regulates signaling and ion transport pathways necessary for wound healing.DISCUSSIONWe demonstrate here that extracellular Zn2+, at the concentrations found in the epidermis, acts as a signaling molecule, triggering Ca2+ release from thapsigargin-sensitive stores. The response to Zn2+ is mediated through a Gαq-coupled receptor, GPR39, which activates PLC and the IP3 pathway, similar to the ZnR-response in colonocytes and neurons (20Azriel-Tamir H. Sharir H.

Signal Transduct. Res. 2007; 27: 235-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Analysis of the Zn2+-dependent Ca2+ response, indicated that the keratinocytic-ZnR has high affinity and selectivity for Zn2+. Importantly, we show that following epithelial injury endogenous Zn2+ is released and may act as a paracrine agonist triggering ZnR signaling leading to activation of intracellular signaling pathways associated with wound healing.Our results demonstrate ZnR-dependent activation of the MAPK pathway in keratinocytic cells. Activation of this pathway triggers the majority of the early genes induced in a scratch model and is essential for wound healing (51Fitsialos G. Chassot A.A. Turchi L. Dayem M.A. LeBrigand K.

Cell Physiol. 2008; 215: 292-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a long-lasting, marked increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation was apparent following a brief exposure to Zn2+. Sustained ERK1/2 phosphorylation may be, upon certain conditions, referred to as a precursor of cell death (54Ho Y. Samarasinghe R. Knoch M.E. Lewis M. Aizenman E. DeFranco D.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 74: 1141-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 55Sarfaraz S. Afaq F. Adhami V.M. Malik A. Mukhtar H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39480-39491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, in HaCaT cells upon exposure to UVA, sustained ERK1/2 phosphorylation via activation of metalloproteinases may serve as a survival signal suppressing apoptosis (56Han W. He Y.Y. Photochem. Photobiol. 2009; 85: 997-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The enhanced migration of HaCaT cells, monitored using the in vitro scratch assay, following keratinocytic-ZnR activation suggests that ZnR-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation leads to cell growth. ZnR-dependent activation of ERK1/2 was partially mediated by PKC and the PI3K pathway, suggesting that cross-talk between these pathways may mediate the effects of Zn2+ on epithelial repair. These signaling pathways are also involved in enhanced epithelial breast cancer cell proliferation following activation of the bradykinin receptor (57Campbell M. Trimble E.R. Circ.

Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Our results show that ZnR- or ATP-dependent metabotropic Ca2+ signaling induce up-regulation of NHE1 activity and thereby enhance the recovery of intracellular pH from acid load. Moreover, inhibition of the Zn2+-induced NHE1 up-regulation by cariporide resulted in attenuated migration and scratch closure. Phosphorylation of NHE1 by ERK1/2 plays a pivotal role in the activation of the exchanger by growth factors, hormone stimulation (47Snabaitis A.K. Yokoyama H. Avkiran M. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 68Malo M.E. Li L. Fliegel L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 51804-51816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Inhibition of the MAPK pathway resulted in attenuation of the stimulatory effect of Zn2+ via the ZnR on NHE1 also in keratinocytes.In agreement with other works (69Sarangarajan R. Shumaker H. Soleimani M. Le Poole C. Boissy R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1511: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 70Hachem J.P. Behne M. Aronchik I. Demerjian M. Feingold K.R. Elias P.M. Mauro T.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2005; 125: 790-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we show that the Na+/H+ exchanger NHE1 is activated in skin cells following cellular acidification. The robust up-regulation of NHE1 activity by Zn2+ in keratinocytes suggests an important physiological role for this ion in pH regulation. The acidic surface, pH of 6.0, found in the upper layer of the skin is essential for formation of the permeability barrier (70Hachem J.P. Behne M. Aronchik I. Demerjian M. Feingold K.R. Elias P.M.

Biopharm. 2009; 72: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Zn2+ deficiency enhances the inflammatory response (72Knoell D.L. Julian M.W. Bao S. Besecker B. Macre J.E. Leikauf G.D. DiSilvestro R.A. Crouser E.D. Crit. Care Med. 2009; 37: 1380-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and a prominent role for this ion in wound healing was suggested to be an antimicrobial effect. A beneficial effect of Zn2+ may therefore require strengthening of the proton gradient and the epithelial permeability barrier that is regulated by NHE1 activity or expression (70Hachem J.P. Behne M.

Stock C. J. Physiol. 2007; 585: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that following skin injury, the release of Zn2+ or its topical application may enhance formation of the barrier, and thereby, exert an anti-inflammatory effect.Another molecule, apart from Zn2+, that is released from epithelial cultures is ATP (44Sammak P.J. Hinman L.E. Tran P.O. Sjaastad M.D. Machen T.E. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 465-475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which can trigger a metabotropic Ca2+ response mediated via the purinergic receptors (52Yang L. Cranson D. Trinkaus-Randall V. J. Cell Biochem. 2004; 91: 938-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 75Wesley U.V. Bove P.F. Hristova M. McCarthy S. van der Vliet A. J. Biol.

Sci. 2005; 46: 104-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Our results show that both Zn2+ and ATP are released following injury and can independently induce Ca2+ signaling and activation of the MAPK pathway leading to up-regulation of NHE1 activity. Interestingly, activation of the ZnR pathway in salivary gland cells induces the release of ATP (36Sharir H. Hershfinkel M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 332: 845-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), this may provide a mechanism for the release of this molecule that will further enhance the metabotropic Ca2+ signaling. The role of ATP in wound healing however is still controversial. Activation of the purinergic receptor and subsequent Ca2+ release were shown to induce EGFR transactivation and lead to enhanced wound closure (77Yin J. Xu K. Zhang J. Kumar A. Yu F.S. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 815-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 78Boucher I. Yang L. Mayo C. Klepeis V. Trinkaus-Randall V. Exp. Eye. Res. 2007; 85: 130-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Another study however, claimed that ATP inhibited serum-induced ERK1/2 and PI3K activation and attenuated cell migration (79Taboubi S. Milanini J. Delamarre E. Parat F. Garrouste F. Pommier G. Takasaki J. Hubaud J.C. Kovacic H. Lehmann M. Faseb J. 2007; 21: 4047-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Our results, as well as others (52Yang L. Cranson D. Trinkaus-Randall V. J. Cell Biochem. 2004; 91: 938-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), show that ATP activates the MAPK pathway leading for example to enhance airway epithelial cell migration (75Wesley U.V. Bove P.F. Hristova M. McCarthy S. van der Vliet A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3213-3220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Importantly, our results indicate that the downstream signaling triggered by ATP induced up-regulation of NHE1 activity and enhanced in vitro scratch closure. Our results further support a role for ATP in promoting wound healing, as chelation of Zn2+ and scavenging of ATP eliminated the Ca2+ response triggered by conditioned medium. This indicates that following injury, Zn2+ and ATP are two major mediators of the Ca2+ signaling that is essential for wound healing.The physiological significance of the keratinocytic-ZnR activity mediated by GPR39 is demonstrated by the involvement of its downstream signaling pathway in epithelial proliferation and migration. Using the highly selective probe ZnAF-2, we further show release of Zn2+ to the extracellular medium following keratinocyte injury, indicating that transient changes in the concentration of extracellular Zn2+ occur during this process. The concentration of Zn2+ released following a scratch or in the conditioned medium was sufficient to activate the high affinity ZnR-dependent Ca2+ signaling in keratinocytic cultures. Although the effects of Zn2+ on wound healing were previously described, our results provide the first mechanistic link between Zn2+ and this process via the specific ZnR/GPR39. Generation of agonists that will activate, but will not desensitize, the ZnR may in the future provide an effective approach to accelerate wound healing. IntroductionFollowing injury, keratinocytes are exposed to diverse extracellular stimuli such as growth factors, cytokines, and matrix components, resulting in stimulation of cellular proliferation and migration. The release of these factors at the wound site leads to renewal of the epithelial layer in the damaged area (1Jacinto A. Martinez-Arias A. Martin P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Zinc is found in the intracellular and extracellular matrix, in its free or protein-bound form and was shown to accumulate in skin tissues following injury (2Lansdown A.B. Mirastschijski U. Stubbs N. Scanlon E. Agren M.S. Wound Repair Regen. 2007; 15: 2-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Furthermore, topical addition of zinc, in ointments or bandages, was known for many years and is also used in modern medicine to accelerate wound healing and the re-epithelialization process (2Lansdown A.B. Mirastschijski U. Stubbs N. Scanlon E. Agren M.S. Wound Repair Regen. 2007; 15: 2-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 3Barceloux D.G. J. Toxicol. Clin.

Consistent with a key role for Zn2+ in promoting wound healing, the manifestation of dietary or genetic Zn2+ deficiency are severe skin lesions and impaired wound healing that can be reversed by Zn2+ supplementation (6Jensen S.L.

The effect of Zn2+ in enhancing cell proliferation is synergistic with intracellular Ca2+ rise, indicating that their effects are mediated through a common pathway (26Huang J.S. Mukherjee J.J.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Importantly, Zn2+ affects cell proliferation rate prior to changes in its intracellular levels, suggesting that the extracellular Zn2+ pool mediates signaling leading to epithelial repair (28MacDonald R.S.

U.S.A. 2001; 98: 11749-11754Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). ZnR activity was manifested by robust increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations triggered by extracellular Zn2+ (29Hershfinkel M. Moran A. Grossman N. Sekler I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 11749-11754Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have found that in neurons ZnR activity is mediated by the G-protein-coupled receptor, GPR39 (30Besser L.

We demonstrate here that a ZnR/GPR39 is activated in keratinocytes, by exogenous Zn2+ or by conditioned medium collected from injured cells, and up-regulates signaling and ion transport pathways necessary for wound healing. Following injury, keratinocytes are exposed to diverse extracellular stimuli such as growth factors, cytokines, and matrix components, resulting in stimulation of cellular proliferation and migration. The release of these factors at the wound site leads to renewal of the epithelial layer in the damaged area (1Jacinto A. Martinez-Arias A. Martin P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E117-123Cros"
https://openalex.org/W2167797675,"Background Predators can have profound impacts on the dynamics of their prey that depend on how predator consumption is affected by prey density (the predator's functional response). Consumption by a generalist predator is expected to depend on the densities of all its major prey species (its multispecies functional response, or MSFR), but most studies of generalists have focussed on their functional response to only one prey species. Methodology and principal findings Using Bayesian methods, we fit an MSFR to field data from an avian predator (the hen harrier Circus cyaneus) feeding on three different prey species. We use a simple graphical approach to show that ignoring the effects of alternative prey can give a misleading impression of the predator's effect on the prey of interest. For example, in our system, a “predator pit” for one prey species only occurs when the availability of other prey species is low. Conclusions and significance The Bayesian approach is effective in fitting the MSFR model to field data. It allows flexibility in modelling over-dispersion, incorporates additional biological information into the parameter priors, and generates estimates of uncertainty in the model's predictions. These features of robustness and data efficiency make our approach ideal for the study of long-lived predators, for which data may be sparse and management/conservation priorities pressing."
https://openalex.org/W2022839356,"The evolutionary appearance of p53 protein probably preceded its role in tumor suppression, suggesting that there may be unappreciated functions for this protein. Using genetic reporters as proxies to follow in vivo activation of the p53 network in Drosophila, we discovered that the process of meiotic recombination instigates programmed activation of p53 in the germ line. Specifically, double-stranded breaks in DNA generated by the topoisomerase Spo11 provoked functional p53 activity, which was prolonged in cells defective for meiotic DNA repair. This intrinsic stimulus for the p53 regulatory network is highly conserved because Spo11-dependent activation of p53 also occurs in mice. Our findings establish a physiological role for p53 in meiosis and suggest that tumor-suppressive functions may have been co-opted from primordial activities linked to recombination."
https://openalex.org/W2012264087,"Helicobacter pylori, a human pathogen associated with chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer and gastric malignancies, is generally viewed as an extracellular microorganism. Here, we show that H. pylori replicates in murine bone marrow derived-dendritic cells (BMDCs) within autophagosomes.A 10-fold increase of CFU is found between 2 h and 6 h p.i. in H. pylori-infected BMDCs. Autophagy is induced around the bacterium and participates at late time points of infection for the clearance of intracellular H. pylori. As a consequence of infection, LC3, LAMP1 and MHC class II molecules are retained within the H. pylori-containing vacuoles and export of MHC class II molecules to cell surface is blocked. However, formalin-fixed H. pylori still maintain this inhibitory activity in BMDC derived from wild type mice, but not in from either TLR4 or TLR2-deficient mice, suggesting the involvement of H. pylori-LPS in this process. TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-10 expression was also modulated upon infection showing a TLR2-specific dependent IL-10 secretion. No IL-12 was detected favoring the hypothesis of a down modulation of DC functions during H. pylori infection. Furthermore, antigen-specific T cells proliferation was also impaired upon infection.H. pylori can infect and replicate in BMDCs and thereby affects DC-mediated immune responses. The implication of this new finding is discussed for the biological life cycle of H. pylori in the host."
https://openalex.org/W2053995562,"The role of HO3 as a temporary reservoir of atmospheric OH radicals remains an open question largely because of the considerable uncertainty in the value of the dissociation energy of the HO-O2 bond (D0) or, equivalently, the standard enthalpy of formation of HO3 (Delta(f)H;{\overline{);\circ }}$$). Using a supersonic flow apparatus, we have observed by means of laser-induced fluorescence the decay of OH radicals in the presence of O2 at temperatures between 55.7 and 110.8 kelvin (K). Between 87.4 and 99.8 K, the OH concentration approached a nonzero value at long times, allowing equilibrium constants for the reaction with O2 to be calculated. Using expressions for the equilibrium constant from classical and statistical thermodynamics, and values of partition functions and standard entropies calculated from spectroscopic data, we derived values of D0 = (12.3 +/- 0.3) kilojoules per mole and Delta(f)H;{\overline{);\circ }}$$ (298 K) = (19.3 +/- 0.5) kilojoules per mole. The atmospheric implications of HO3 formation are therefore very slight."
https://openalex.org/W2133470606,"The sphingosine kinase-1/sphingosine 1-phosphate (SphK1/S1P) pathway has been associated with cancer promotion and progression and resistance to treatments in a number of cancers, including prostate adenocarcinoma. Here we provide the first evidence that dietary agents, namely, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg, IC(50)≈75 μM), resveratrol (IC(50)≈40 μM), or a mixture of polyphenols from green tea [polyphenon E (PPE), IC(50)≈70 μM] or grapevine extract (vineatrol, IC(50)≈30 μM), impede prostate cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting the SphK1/S1P pathway. We establish that SphK1 is a downstream effector of the ERK/phospholipase D (PLD) pathway, which is inhibited by green tea and wine polyphenols. Enforced expression of SphK1 impaired the ability of green tea and wine polyphenols, as well as pharmacological inhibitors of PLD and ERK activities, to induce apoptosis in PC-3 and C4-2B cells. The therapeutic efficacy of these polyphenols on tumor growth and the SphK1/S1P pathway were confirmed in animals using a heterotopic PC-3 tumor in place model. PC-3/SphK1 cells implanted in animals developed larger tumors and resistance to treatment with polyphenols. Furthermore, using an orthotopic PC-3/GFP model, the chemopreventive effect of an EGCg or PPE diet was associated with SphK1 inhibition, a decrease in primary tumor volume, and occurrence and number of metastases. These results provide the first demonstration that the prosurvival, antiapoptotic SphK1/S1P pathway represents a target of dietary green tea and wine polyphenols in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2082547139,"In addition to its primary role as a fundamental component of the SNARE complex, SNAP-25 also modulates voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) in various overexpression systems. Although these studies suggest a potential negative regulatory role of SNAP-25 on VGCC activity, the effects of endogenous SNAP-25 on native VGCC function in neurons are unclear. In the present study, we investigated the VGCC properties of cultured glutamatergic and GABAergic rat hippocampal neurons. Glutamatergic currents were dominated by P/Q-type channels, whereas GABAergic cells had a dominant L-type component. Also, glutamatergic VGCC current densities were significantly lower with enhanced inactivation rates and shifts in the voltage dependence of activation and inactivation curves compared with GABAergic cells. Silencing endogenous SNAP-25 in glutamatergic neurons did not alter P/Q-type channel expression or localization but led to increased VGCC current density without changes in the VGCC subtype proportions. Isolation of the P/Q-type component indicated that increased current in the absence of SNAP-25 was correlated with a large depolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of inactivation. Overexpressing SNAP-25 in GABAergic neurons reduced current density without affecting the VGCC subtype proportion. Accordingly, VGCC current densities in glutamatergic neurons from Snap-25(+/-) mice were significantly elevated compared with wild type glutamatergic neurons. Overall, this study demonstrates that endogenous SNAP-25 negatively regulates native VGCCs in glutamatergic neurons which could have important implications for neurological diseases associated with altered SNAP-25 expression."

The identical lower and upper triene polyketide chains are built up from 3,4-AHBA and cyclohexylcarbonyl CoA (CHC-CoA), respectively, by three steps of classical polyketide condensations.

The only reported gene product of asuD2 (hemA-asuA), a member of the 2-oxoamine synthases, was found to be involved in asukamycin biosynthesis and to catalyze the condensation of succinyl-CoA and glycine (15Petrícek M.

Protoasukamycin C1, the polyketide assembly product, is further oxygenated to give the final product asukamycin (1Sattler I. Thiericke R. Zeeck A. Nat. Prod.

The upper polyketide chain assembly of the congeners A2–A7 recruits the branched acyl CoA starters, which are predominantly used for fatty acid biosynthesis in S. nodosus subsp. asukaensis (7Hu Y.D. Floss H.G. Heterocycles. 2006; 69: 133-149Crossref Google Scholar). Alternatively, the CHC-CoA starter of asukamycin polyketide chain assembly can also be used to form ω-cyclohexyl fatty acids as a part of cellular membrane components. As the membrane fluidity and permeability are strongly determined by the fatty acid composition, the biosynthetic regulation of each fatty acid component is crucial for membrane homeostasis in bacteria (18Kaneda T. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 288-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Zhang Y.M. Rock C.O. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 222-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). The content of ω-cyclohexyl fatty acids, a byproduct generated during the peak period of asukamycin biosynthesis, is maintained to be as low as 3% (7Hu Y.D. Floss H.G. Heterocycles. 2006; 69: 133-149Crossref Google Scholar). This implies that the organism has a control mechanism to balance the metabolic flux between the production of membrane fatty acids and asukamycin. Herein, we report the cloning, mutagenic analysis, and characterization of the biosynthetic genes, which provides insight into the biosynthetic assembly of the asukamycins in S. nodosus subsp. asukaensis. Possible cross-talk between the biosynthesis of the fatty acids and the asukamycins is also discussed. S. nodosus subsp. asukaensis ATCC 29757 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Streptomyces lividans K4-114 was kindly provided by Dr. C. Khosla. Escherichia coli strains were obtained from the John Innes Center (Norwich, UK). The media and chemicals were purchased from Difco, Sigma-Aldrich, and EMD Chemicals. See supplemental text. The cosmids 2B9 and 10D6 were linearized by SpeI and EcoRI, respectively, equally mixed, and transformed into E. coli BW25113/pIJ790 competent cells by electroporation (20Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11049) Google Scholar). The cells were then added to 1 ml of SOC medium (20Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11049) Google Scholar), recovered at 37 °C for 3 h, and plated out onto LB agar with 100 μg/ml apramycin. For the negative control, the linearized 2B9 and 10D6 were transformed separately by the same procedure. The recombinant clone was confirmed by matching the anticipated EcoRI digestion pattern and named pART1361. Intergeneric conjugation of the recombinant cosmids from E. coli to S. lividans K4-114 followed the established protocol (21Kieser T. Bibb M.J. Buttner M.J. Chater K.F. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich, UK2000Google Scholar). To construct pART1391, a 1.5-kb DNA fragment from pIJ778 was PCR-amplified using primers AsuRED-4 and -6 (supplemental Table S3) to carry a spectinomycin resistance gene cassette plus two 50-bp nucleotides, designed to be identical to the boundaries of the targeted region on pART1361 (supplemental Fig. S5) (20Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11049) Google Scholar). To obtain the recombinant strain, the gel-purified PCR fragment was introduced into E. coli BW25113/pART1361/pIJ790 by electroporation, and the transformants were screened for spectinomycin resistance. The deletion in the resulting clone was confirmed by matching up to the expected EcoRI digestion pattern and verified by PCR. The pART1361E3 construction followed the same strategy as described above but using primers AsuRED-E3F and -E3R (supplemental Table S3). To insert the point mutation that modifies the TCC (Ser) codon into ACC (Thr) in the asuD2 gene, the internal fragment containing the BamHI-KpnI sites was PCR-amplified using primers S83TF and S83TR (supplemental Table S3). The BamHI-KpnI-cleaved fragment was then used to replace the corresponding region in the pALS3 plasmid. The further steps were identical with the pALS4 construction (15Petrícek M. Petrícková K. Havlícek L. Felsberg J. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 5113-5123Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). S. nodosus subsp. asukaensis, S. lividans K4-114, and the derived strains were cultivated as described (10Hu Y.D. Floss H.G. J. Am. Chem.

Feeding experiments with 3,4-AHBA (100 μg/ml) and 4-hydroxyprotoasukamycin (20 μg/ml) were conducted by adding these compounds to 1-day-old cultures and harvesting 1 day later. Fermented cultures were mixed thoroughly with an equal volume of ethyl acetate. The mixture was separated by centrifugation, and the ethyl acetate layer was collected and evaporated to near dryness. The crude extract was dissolved in an equal volume of methanol and analyzed using a P680 HPLC system (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) and an XTerra RP18 column (4.6 × 250 mm; Waters) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min at 25 °C. Twenty μl of crude extract were injected, equilibrated with 65% solvent B (acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid) in solvent A (water with 0.1% formic acid) for 5 min, developed with a gradient of 65–90% solvent B in solvent A for 20 min, and washed with 90% solvent B in solvent A for 10 min. To analyze the asuD1–D3 mutants, a gradient of 50–70% solvent B in solvent A was applied instead. The extraction and HPLC analysis of 3,4-AHBA followed the described protocol (22Suzuki H. Ohnishi Y.

High resolution MS and LC-MS analyses were carried out on a 6210-TOF LC-MS system (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA) in which the LC was performed using a XDB C18 (4.6 × 50 mm, 1.8-micron particle size) high throughput column (Agilent Technologies, Inc.) with the same elution program as the HPLC analysis mentioned above. The exact masses of the identified compounds are listed in supplemental Table S1. See supplemental text. A reliable yield of the novel intermediate 4-hydroxyprotoasukamycin D1 was obtained in S. lividans K4-114 carrying pART1361E3, which was generated from pART1361 with the λ-Red PCR strategy by replacing asuE3 with a spectinomycin resistance gene. S. lividans K4-114/pART1361E3 was inoculated into 500 ml of MS medium in 2-liter flasks with a coil and fermented on a rotary shaker at 250 rpm and 28 °C for 4–5 days. One liter of harvested culture was extracted three times with an equal volume of ethyl acetate, and the combined ethyl acetate extract was dried, concentrated, and purified on a silica gel column (100–200 mesh), eluting with dichloromethane/methanol (100:3). The compound D1 fraction was collected and further purified by semi-preparative C18 reverse phase HPLC (Dionex), eluting with 75–85% solvent C (methanol with 0.1% formic acid) in solvent A, to give 20 mg of pure compound D1. Its 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, HSQC, and HMBC spectra were recorded in Me2SO-d6 on a Varian System 700 spectrometer (supplemental Table S2). The asuC2 mutant was inoculated into 50 ml of YMG medium in 250-ml flasks with coils and fermented at 250 rpm and 28 °C for 3 days. One liter of harvested culture was extracted three times with an equal volume of ethyl acetate. The combined ethyl acetate extract was dried, concentrated, and purified on a silica gel column (100–200 mesh), eluting with dichloromethane/methanol (90:10). The compound B8 fraction was further purified by semi-preparative C18 reverse phase HPLC (Dionex), and eluting with 35–50% solvent C in solvent A, and 2 mg of pure compound B8 was obtained. 1H NMR (700 MHz, Me2SO-d6) δH 8.91 (s, 1H, NH-14), 8.88 (s, 1H, NH-0′), 7.27 (d, 1H, J = 7.8 Hz, H-3), 7.12 (dd, 1H, J = 15.0, 11.5 Hz, H-11), 6.67 (dd, 1H, J = 15.1, 10.9 Hz, H-9), 6.47 (dd, 1H, J = 15.2, 11.0 Hz, H-10), 6.43 (dd, 1H, J = 14.9, 11.5 Hz, H-8), 6.38 (d, 1H, J = 15.0 Hz, H-12), 6.12 (d, 1H, J = 15.2 Hz, H-7), 3.85 (m, 1H, H-5), 2.71 (dd, 1H, J = 16.8, 3.2 Hz, H-6ax), 2.59 (dd, 1H, J = 16.5, 6.07 Hz, H-6eq), 1.90 (s, 3H, H-2′). 13C-NMR (700 MHz, Me2SO-d6) δC 192.6 (C-1), 169.5 (C-1′), 165.0 (C-13), 140.3 (C-11), 138.8 (C-9), 138.4 (C-7), 131.5 (C-8), 130.8 (C-2), 129.6 (C-3), 129.5 (C-10), 124.5 (C-12), 73.0 (C-4), 71.3 (C-5), 40.1 (C-6), 23.9 (C-2′). To clone the asukamycin biosynthetic gene cluster, a cosmid genomic library of S. nodosus subsp. asukaensis was constructed and screened with two 32P-labeled DNA probes.

Cosmids 2B9 and 10D6 were mapped and sequenced to disclose a total combined 63,922 bp of DNA inserts (GenBankTM accession number GQ926890).

Because neither 2B9 nor 10D6 carries a full set of the predicted biosynthetic genes, we modified the conventional λ-Red recombination strategy (20Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The resulting cosmid pART1361 was introduced into S. lividans by conjugation from E. coli. Brightly yellowish metabolites were observed in the culture and were confirmed to be asukamycins A1–A7 by high resolution LC-MS. Cosmid pART1391 was further constructed from pART1361 to eliminate a 25.4-kb left-hand side insert region, in which the identified open reading frames were mainly related to primary metabolic functions in Streptomycetes. LC-MS analysis confirmed that S. lividans K4-114/pART1391 is fully capable of producing asukamycins A1–A7 (Fig. 4d). These expression results indicate that the cloned 36 asu genes in pART1391 are sufficient for asukamycin production.FIGURE 4HPLC analysis of asukamycin metabolites.a, 20 μl of crude culture extract of the asuB1 mutant. b, the asuC3C4 double mutant. c, the asuC15 mutant. d, S. lividans K4-114/pART1391. e, S. nodosus subsp. asukaensis wild type strain.

Ohnishi Y. Furusho Y. Sakuda S. Horinouchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36944-36951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Mutants disrupted in asuA1 and asuA3, respectively, were constructed to confirm their roles in 3,4-AHBA formation. Neither 3,4-AHBA nor asukamycin were detected in the cultures of these mutants, but the addition of 3,4-AHBA restored asukamycin production in both mutants (supplemental Fig. S1a). However, the new minor accumulated products E1 and E3/E4, which possess a C5N moiety amide-linked with the triene upper chains corresponding to A1 and A3/A4, respectively, were detected by LC-MS analysis (supplemental Fig. S6). Presumably, 3,4-AHBA is activated by adenylation and then tethered to a specific aroyl carrier protein for the downstream chain extensions as in the aromatic polyketide and polypeptide biosynthetic systems employing an aryl carboxylate starter (26Pfennig F. Schauwecker F. Keller U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12508-12516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 27Zhou Z. Lai J.R. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Biol. 2008; 15: 51-61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). AsuA2 is homologous to the actinomycin synthetase I, which initiates actinomycin formation in Streptomyces chrysomallus by activating 4-methyl-3-hydroxyanthranilate (4-MHA) in the presence of ATP (26Pfennig F. Schauwecker F. Keller U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12508-12516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The asuA2 mutant failed to produce any asukamycins but accumulated 3,4-AHBA, as confirmed by HPLC comparison with standard 3,4-AHBA as well as by restoring asukamycin production upon co-culturing with the 3,4-AHBA assembly-deficient asuA1 mutant (supplemental Fig. S1b). AsuC11 and AsuC12 both belong to the acyl carrier protein (ACP) family. AsuC12 is distinctly related to AcmACP, a specific aroyl carrier protein of the actinomycin pathway, which is charged by the priming molecule 4-MHA-AMP and forwards it to the peptide synthase AcmII for chain initiation (26Pfennig F. Schauwecker F. Keller U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12508-12516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The mutant in which both asuC11 and asuC12 were truncated showed a similar phenotype as the asuA2 mutant, i.e. 3,4-AHBA accumulation and no asukamycin production (supplemental Fig. S1b). AsuC13 has strong similarity to a group of type II iterative fatty acid synthase (FAS)/polyketide synthase (29Hertweck C. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2009; 48: 4688-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar, 30Sattely E.S. Fischbach M.A. Walsh C.T. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2008; 25: 757-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). AsuC13 was confirmed to be a KSI/II polyketide synthase (31Huang W. Jia J. Edwards P. Dehesh K. Schneider G. Lindqvist Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1183-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 32Olsen J.G. Kadziola A. von Wettstein-Knowles P. Siggaard-Andersen M. Lindquist Y. Larsen S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) involved in the lower polyketide chain assembly, as the asuC13 mutant failed to produce any asukamycins and accumulated 3,4-AHBA, similar to the asuA2 and asuC11C12 mutants (supplemental Fig. S1b). Notably, trace amounts of E1 and E3/E4 were also found in this mutant culture as observed in the asuA1 and asuA3 mutants. The asuC14 gene, immediately downstream of asuC13, encodes a protein homologous to AsuC13, except for a truncated N terminus and lack of the characteristic Cys-His-His catalytic triad. This unusual asuC13-asuC14 pair in which an intact polyketide synthase gene accompanies a partially truncated partner is also found in several uncharacterized gene clusters from the genomic sequencing projects of Streptomyces hygroscopicus (ZP_05513707-8) and Salinispora arenicola (YP_001535964-5 and YP_001537504-5). Mutation studies are in progress, but the AsuC14 function remains unknown for the moment. Two additional sequential reactions, a β-keto reduction and a dehydration, are expected for the lower chain assembly. AsuC7 displays high homology to several polyketide ketoreductases (33Tang Y. Lee H.Y. Tang Y. Kim C.Y. Mathews I. Khosla C. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 14085-14093Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 34Cohen-Gonsaud M. Ducasse S. Hoh F. Zerbib D. Labesse G. Quemard A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 249-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Downstream of asuC7, two putative dehydratase genes, asuC8 and asuC9, were found next to each other. AsuC9 is closely related to HadB, which forms a heterodimer with either HadA or HadC to function in mycolic acid biosynthesis in Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (35Sacco E. Covarrubias A.S. O'Hare H.M. Carroll P. Eynard N. Jones T.A. Parish T. Daffé M. Bäckbro K. Quémard A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 14628-14633Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Coincidently, AsuC8 is highly related to both HadA and HadC. As asuC7 and asuC8,C9 are the only genes in the cluster that could be involved in β-keto reduction and dehydration, we suggest that they operate in the assembly of both the lower and upper trans-triene chains. Unlike other manumycins, formation of the asukamycin upper polyketide chain starts with cyclohexylcarbonyl-CoA (11Thiericke R. Zeeck A. Nakagawa A. Omura S. Herrold R.E. Wu S.T.S. Beale J.M. Floss H.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 3979-3987Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Four clustered genes, asuB1–B4, are homologous to two gene sets, ansJKLM/chcA from the ansatrienin producer S. collinus and plmJKLM/chcA from the phoslactomycin producer Streptomyces sp. HK-803, which are involved in CHC-CoA biosynthesis (12Cropp T.A. Wilson D.J. Reynolds K.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 980-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 36Palaniappan N. Kim B.S. Sekiyama Y. Osada H. Reynolds K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35552-35557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The asuB1 mutant failed to produce asukamycin, but levels of the previously identified asukamycin congeners A2–A7 were increased 3-fold compared with the wild type strain (Fig. 4a). LC-MS analysis further identified three new compounds, A8, B8, and C8 (Fig. 1). The NMR analysis of B8 revealed a B1-like structure except that the upper polyketide chain was replaced by an acetyl group. Based on the molecular weight, compounds C8 and A8 are likely the proto-form and type I form of B8, respectively. These products probably result from the absence of CHC-CoA plus an oversupply of the 3,4-AHBA-lower chain-ACP intermediate. To initiate fatty acid or polyketide biosynthesis, acyl-CoA starters are recruited and condensed with a (methyl)-malonyl-ACP by the action of fatty acid synthase FabH or KSIII. This is distinct from the action of KSI/II, joining two ACP-bound acyl substrates in the subsequent chain extensions in many microorganisms (29Hertweck C. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2009; 48: 4688-471"
https://openalex.org/W2003953582,"Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) is a highly conserved serine/threonine protein kinase that plays important roles in a variety of physiological and developmental processes in animals. It is well known that the GSK3 kinase-catalyzed protein phosphorylation often requires a stable kinase-substrate docking interaction, which is achieved mainly by two mechanisms as follows: priming phosphorylation of a substrate by a distinct kinase to create a docking phosphate group and scaffold protein-mediated protein complex formation. Brassinosteroid-INsensitive 2 (BIN2) is an Arabidopsis GSK3-like kinase that negatively regulates brassinosteroid (BR) signaling by phosphorylating BES1 (bri1 EMS suppressor 1) and BZR1 (brassinazole-resistant 1), two highly similar transcription factors critical for bringing about characteristic BR responses. However, little is known about the biochemical mechanism by which BIN2 phosphorylates its substrates. Here, we show that BIN2 interacts directly with BZR1 through a 12-amino acid BIN2-docking motif adjacent to the C terminus of BZR1. Interestingly, this 12-amino acid motif is sufficient to allow a Drosophila GSK3 substrate Armadillo to be phosphorylated by BIN2 in vitro. Deletion of this motif inhibits the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of BZR1 in vivo, resulting in phenotypic suppression of a hypermorphic bin2 mutation and enhanced resistance to a BR biosynthesis inhibitor. We thus concluded that BIN2 utilizes a direct kinase-substrate docking mechanism to phosphorylate BZR1 and regulate its protein stability."

Upon ligand binding to receptors, receptor-associated Janus kinases become activated and phosphorylate tyrosine residues on the intracellular tail of the receptor, which function as docking sites for STAT molecules. The receptor-bound STAT proteins are subsequently phosphorylated on a single tyrosine residue, translocate into the nucleus as dimers, and bind to specific DNA sequences in promoters of their target genes for transcription regulation (2Levy D.E.

Both Stat3 and JAK2 are involved in the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells into beating embryoid bodies and cardiomyocytes (18Foshay K. Rodriguez G. Hoel B. Narayan J. Gallicano G.I.

However, it is unclear how Stat3 mediates these effects during the process of cardiac differentiation. One approach to address this issue is through analysis of Stat3 target gene regulation during cardiac differentiation. We have previously reported the utilization of a genome-wide ChIP assay to identify potential Stat3 target genes (20Snyder M. Huang X.Y. Zhang J.J. J. Biol.

Tbx5 and Nkx2.5 interact to promote cardiomyocyte differentiation through regulation of the cardiac-specific natriuretic peptide precursor type A (Nppa) gene (30Hiroi Y. Kudoh S. Monzen K. Ikeda Y. Yazaki Y. Nagai R. Komuro I. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Both Tbx5 and Nkx2.5 interact with GATA4 (31Garg V. Kathiriya I.S. Barnes R. Schluterman M.K.

Charron F. Warren R. Schwartz R.J. Nemer M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5687-5696Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Also, overexpression of Tbx5 caused P19CL6 cells to express cardiac differentiation specific genes and beat early (30Hiroi Y. Kudoh S. Monzen K. Ikeda Y. Yazaki Y. Nagai R. Komuro I. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Studies with P19CL6 cells also showed that RNAi-mediated knockdown of Nkx2.5 prevented efficient differentiation into beating cardiomyocytes (33Liu H. Harris T.M. Kim H.H. Childs G. Funct. Integr. Genomics. 2005; 5: 218-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Overexpression of GATA4 in P19 cells enhances cardiac differentiation whereas inhibition of GATA4 blocks cardiac differentiation (34Grépin C. Robitaille L. Antakly T. Nemer M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4095-4102Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 35Grépin C. Nemer G. Nemer M. Development. 1997; 124: 2387-2395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, as mouse embryonic stem cells differentiate into cardiomyocytes, there is an increase in cardiac differentiation markers including Nkx2.5, Tbx5, and GATA4; and inhibition of the Janus kinase/STAT3 pathway blocks their expression (18Foshay K. Rodriguez G. Hoel B. Narayan J. Gallicano G.I. Stem Cells. 2005; 23: 530-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, it has not been shown how activated Stat3 regulates their expression during differentiation.In this report, we set out to test the hypothesis that Stat3 directly regulates the expression of Nkx2.5, Tbx5, and GATA4 and is necessary for cardiomyocyte differentiation. We first demonstrate that Stat3 is phosphorylated in response to LIF treatment of P19CL6 cells, and activated Stat3 binds directly to the promoters of Tbx5, Nkx2.5, and GATA4 to induce their expression. Furthermore, Stat3 becomes phosphorylated when cells are cultured in differentiation medium independent of exogenous ligand treatment, and there is an increase in transcriptional expression of Tbx5, Nkx2.5, GATA4, and other cardiac differentiation markers. Using an RNAi knockdown approach in both ligand-induced and ligand-independent differentiation conditions, we show that Tbx5, Nkx2.5, and GATA4 expression is Stat3-dependent. Finally, we show that RNAi-mediated Stat3 knockdown decreases the number of beating regions when P19CL6 cells are cultured in differentiation conditions. Together, these results demonstrate that Stat3 is required for the differentiation of cardiomyocytes through direct transcriptional regulation of the expression of Tbx5, Nkx2.5, and GATA4.DISCUSSIONIt has been suggested previously that Stat3 plays an important role during differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells into beating cardiomyocytes (18Foshay K. Rodriguez G. Hoel B. Narayan J. Gallicano G.I. Stem Cells. 2005; 23: 530-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 19Rajasingh J. Bord E. Hamada H. Lambers E. Qin G. Losordo D.W. Kishore R. Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 910-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, it was not known how Stat3 is involved in the process of cardiac differentiation. In a genome-wide ChIP screen designed to identify potential direct Stat3 target genes (20Snyder M. Huang X.Y. Zhang J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 3791-3798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), we identified three cardiac differentiation markers, Nkx2.5, Tbx5, and GATA4, suggesting that Stat3 directly regulates the expression of these genes critical for cardiomyocyte differentiation. In this report, we demonstrate that Tbx5, Nkx2.5, and GATA4 are direct target genes of Stat3, and activated Stat3 increases expression of these genes (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2). Furthermore, we showed that Stat3 is required for the expression of these genes during cardiomyocyte differentiation (Fig. 3). Tbx5 and Nkx2.5 interact with each other, and they genetically and physically interact with GATA4 to activate genes necessary for cardiac differentiation (30Hiroi Y. Kudoh S. Monzen K. Ikeda Y. Yazaki Y. Nagai R. Komuro I. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 31Garg V. Kathiriya I.S. Barnes R. Schluterman M.K. King I.N. Butler C.A. Rothrock C.R.

Biol. 2009; 326: 368-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that Stat3 is at the upstream of the differentiation cascade by controlling the expression of a group of genes essential for cardiac muscle differentiation.It is interesting that our ChIP results suggest that some levels of Stat3 are bound to the Nkx2.5 and Tbx5 promoters in untreated P19CL6 cells (Fig. 1). This level of bound Stat3 increases following LIF treatment. Stat3 has been shown to shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleus regardless of tyrosine phosphorylation, and several reports showed a role for unphosphorylated Stat3 in transcription including recruitment of Stat3 to promoters through interactions with NFκB (46Yu Z. Zhang W. Kone B.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 47Hagihara K. Nishikawa T. Sugamata Y. Song J. Isobe T. Taga T. Yoshizaki K. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 1051-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 48Liu L. McBride K.M. Reich N.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 8150-8155Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 49Yang J. Stark G.R. Cell Res. 2008; 18: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has also observed Stat3 bound to promoters in the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation (20Snyder M. Huang X.Y. Zhang J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 3791-3798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Unphosphorylated Stat3 bound to these promoters could partially clear the promoter and in this case could explain the more rapid induction of Nkx2.5 transcription (Fig. 2A). In addition, Nkx2.5 has been shown to bind to the promoter of GATA4 and is partially necessary for its expression (50Riazi A.M. Takeuchi J.K. Hornberger L.K. Zaidi S.H. Amini F. Coles J. Bruneau B.G. Van Arsdell G.S. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e5698Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that Stat3 first induces the expression of Nkx2.5 and then together with Nkx2.5 induces the expression of GATA4. Hence, the expression of Nkx2.5 peaks at 1 h whereas GATA4 expression continues to increase after 4 h due to the presence of Nkx2.5 (Fig. 2). This could also explain why GATA4 expression is only partially dependent on Stat3 (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6).Stat3 becomes activated in P19CL6 cells cultured in differentiation medium without the addition of exogenous ligand (Fig. 5A). Because LIF has been suggested to contribute to cardiac differentiation (19Rajasingh J. Bord E. Hamada H. Lambers E. Qin G. Losordo D.W. Kishore R. Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 910-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we analyzed the expression of LIF in differentiation culture conditions. These experiments demonstrated that LIF expression is induced and secreted into the medium when P19CL6 cells were cultured in differentiation medium.Stat3 has been shown to function in a number of biological processes. Often, Stat3 function is associated with the processes of proliferation and oncogenesis rather than differentiation. Stat3 activation inhibits differentiation and promotes proliferation during skeletal muscle development (20Snyder M. Huang X.Y. Zhang J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 3791-3798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 51Kami K. Senba E. J. Histochem.

Rodriguez G. Hoel B. Narayan J. Gallicano G.I. Stem Cells. 2005; 23: 530-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 19Rajasingh J. Bord E. Hamada H. Lambers E. Qin G. Losordo D.W. Kishore R. Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 910-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) suggest that Stat3 promotes differentiation in cardiac cells. These observations suggest that Stat3 might be a key regulator in both cardiac and skeletal muscle development through transcriptional regulation of its target genes. It is important to note that cardiac cells continue to proliferate during differentiation. This is in contrast to skeletal muscle cells that exit the cell cycle and cease proliferation during differentiation (54Olson E.N. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 1-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown in this work that Stat3 regulates expression of GATA4, Tbx5, and Nkx2.5, three genes that function in cardiac differentiation (33Liu H. Harris T.M. Kim H.H. Childs G. Funct. Integr. Genomics. 2005; 5: 218-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Our data and others suggest a role for Stat3 during the process of cardiac differentiation (18Foshay K. Rodriguez G. Hoel B. Narayan J. Gallicano G.I. Stem Cells. 2005; 23: 530-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 19Rajasingh J. Bord E. Hamada H. Lambers E. Qin G. Losordo D.W. Kishore R. Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 910-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Although we did not observe an obvious effect of Stat3 knockdown on cell growth in differentiation conditions, we cannot rule out the possibility that Stat3 could have a separate function in cardiac cell proliferation. Further analyses of more Stat3 target genes should lead to a greater understanding of the mechanisms governing both skeletal and cardiac muscle proliferation and differentiation.

Pardoll D. Jove R. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 798-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (2983) Google Scholar, 2Levy D.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Upon ligand binding to receptors, receptor-associated Janus kinases become activated and phosphorylate tyrosine residues on the intracellular tail of the receptor, which function as docking sites for STAT molecules. The receptor-bound STAT proteins are subsequently phosphorylated on a single tyrosine residue, translocate into the nucleus as dimers, and bind to specific DNA sequences in promoters of their target genes for transcription regulation (2Levy D.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (2454) Google Scholar, 3O'Shea J.J. Gadina M. Schreiber R.D.

Stem Cells. 1999; 17: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar).Stat3 is one member of the STAT family that is activated in response to cytokines that bind the gp130 receptor chain including interleukin-6, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and oncostatin M (6Akira S. Nishio Y. Inoue M. Wang X.J. Wei S. Matsusaka T. Yoshida K. Sudo T. Naruto M. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1994; 77: 63-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar, 7Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Graeve L. Dittrich E. Kerr I. Müller-Newen G. Grötzinger J. Wollmer A. Z. Ernahrungswiss. 1998; 37: 43-49PubMed Google Scholar). In response to gp130 receptor activation, Stat3 becomes phosphorylated on Tyr-705 to form dimers that enter the nucleus to regulate transcription of Stat3 target genes (8Becker S. Corthals G.L. Aebersold R. Groner B. Müller C.W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 9Seidel H.M. Milocco L.H. Lamb P. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stein R.B. Rosen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 3041-3045Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Stat3 regulates transcription by recruiting other transcription factors and co-activators to form enhancersomes at the promoters of Stat3 target genes (10Zhang X. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Horvath C.M.

Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2564-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Stat3 is involved in many physiological and pathological processes, including embryogenesis, lymphocyte growth, postnatal survival, oncogenesis, tumor metastasis, and LIF-mediated self-renewal of murine embryonic stem cells (12Haura E.B.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2048-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar). In addition to these processes, Stat3 has been shown to play a role in cardiac cell differentiation and development. Both Stat3 and JAK2 are involved in the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells into beating embryoid bodies and cardiomyocytes (18Foshay K. Rodriguez G. Hoel B. Narayan J. Gallicano G.I. Stem Cells. 2005; 23: 530-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 19Rajasingh J. Bord E. Hamada H. Lambers E. Qin G. Losordo D.W. Kishore R. Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 910-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).These observations strongly support a role for Stat3 in cardiac differentiation and development. However, it is unclear how Stat3 mediates these effects during the process of cardiac differentiation. One approach to address this issue is through analysis of Stat3 target gene regulation during cardiac differentiation. We have previously reported the utilization of a genome-wide ChIP assay to identify potential Stat3 target genes (20Snyder M. Huang X.Y. Zhang J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 3791-3798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Among these Stat3 target genes, we identified three genes that are cardiac differentiation markers: Tbx5, Nkx2.5, and GATA4 (18Foshay K. Rodriguez G. Hoel B. Narayan J. Gallicano G.I. Stem Cells. 2005; 23: 530-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 21Olson E.N. Science. 2006; 313: 1922-1927Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar, 22Liu N. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin.

https://openalex.org/W1990042334,"Pregnant women residing in malaria endemic areas are highly susceptible to Plasmodium falciparum malaria, particularly during their first pregnancy, resulting in low birth weight babies and maternal anaemia. This susceptibility is associated with placental sequestration of parasitised red blood cells expressing pregnancy-specific variant surface antigens. Acquisition of antibodies against these variant surface antigens may protect women and their offspring. Functions of such antibodies may include prevention of placental sequestration or opsonisation of parasitised cells for phagocytic clearance.Here we report the development and optimisation of a new high-throughput flow cytometry-based phagocytosis assay using undifferentiated Thp-1 cells to quantitate the amount of opsonizing antibody in patient sera, and apply this assay to measure the impact of HIV on the levels of antibodies to a pregnancy malaria-associated parasite line in a cohort of Malawian primigravid women. The assay showed high reproducibility, with inter-experimental correlation of r(2) = 0.99. In primigravid women, concurrent malaria infection was associated with significantly increased antibodies, whereas HIV decreased the ability to acquire opsonising antibodies (Mann-Whitney ranksum: p = 0.013). This decrease was correlated with HIV-induced immunosuppression, with women with less than 350 x 10(6) CD4+ T- cells/L having less opsonising antibodies (coef: -11.95,P = 0.002). Levels of antibodies were not associated with protection from low birth weight or anaemia.This flow cytometry-based phagocytosis assay proved to be efficient and accurate for the measurement of Fc-receptor mediated phagocytosis-inducing antibodies in large cohorts. HIV was found to affect mainly the acquisition of antibodies to pregnancy-specific malaria in primigravidae. Further studies of the relationship between opsonising antibodies to malaria in pregnancy and HIV are indicated."

However, the signaling pathways influenced by MRJ(L) are largely unknown. Our observations revealed that MRJ(L) expression causes changes in cell morphology concomitant with down-regulation of several mesenchymal markers, viz. vimentin, N-cadherin, Twist, and Slug, and up-regulation of epithelial marker keratin 18. Importantly, MRJ(L) expression led to reduced levels of β-catenin, an epithelial mesenchymal transition marker, and a critical player in the Wnt pathway. We found that MRJ(L) up-regulates expression of DKK1, a well known Wnt/β-catenin signaling inhibitor, that causes degradation of β-catenin. Re-expression of DNAJB6 alters the Wnt/β-catenin signaling in cancer cells, leading to partial reversal of the mesenchymal phenotype. Thus, MRJ(L) may play a role in maintaining an epithelial phenotype, and inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway may be one of the potential mechanisms contributing to the restriction of malignant behavior by MRJ(L).

On the contrary, the role of the long variant, MRJ(L), in various pathophysiologies has still to be revealed with the exception of a potential role in the nuclear import of human immunodeficiency virus type-2 vpx (11Cheng X. Belshan M. Ratner L. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 1229-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We and others have reported loss of DNAJB6 in advanced breast cancer patients (7Mitra A. Fillmore R.A.

A detailed functional characterization of DNAJB6 performed by us revealed that MRJ(L) can act as a nuclear protein by virtue of its nuclear localization signal and can considerably reduce the expression of several secreted proteins that promote invasion, migration, and metastasis of cancer cells. Functionally, MRJ(L) was found to reduce tumorigenicity and metastasis of melanoma and breast cancer cells (7Mitra A. Fillmore R.A. Metge B.J. Rajesh M. Xi Y. King J. Ju J. Pannell L. Shevde L.A. Samant R.S. Breast Cancer Res. 2008; 10: R22Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). But the mechanistic clues to the downstream signaling regulated by MRJ(L) are still largely unknown. In the course of our studies, we observed distinct morphological changes in the cells that were restored for MRJ(L) expression. The cells were more epithelial like in appearance. In this study, we describe the role of MRJ(L) in causing partial reversal of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). 3The abbreviations used are: EMTepithelial mesenchymal transitionshRNAsmall interfering RNAsiRNAsmall interfering RNAQRTquantitative reverse transcription-PCRDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumPBSphosphate-buffered salineTRITCtetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanateHSPheat shock protein. Our studies show that MRJ(L) inhibits Wnt/β-catenin signaling by up-regulating DKK1, a secreted inhibitor of Wnt signaling, and reverts certain aspects of EMT.

MDA-MB-435 cells stably transfected with MRJ(L) and the corresponding vector control cells were cultured in DMEM/F-12 with 5% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Atlanta, GA), 1% nonessential amino acids, 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate, and 500 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). MCF10A, MCF10.DCIS.com, and MCF10CA1d.cl.1 (obtained from Karmanos Cancer Institute) were cultured in DMEM/F-12 with 5% horse serum (Invitrogen), 100 ng/ml cholera toxin (Calbiochem), 10 μg/ml insulin (Sigma), 500 ng/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma), and 25 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (Sigma). MCF7 cells were cultured in DMEM/F-12 containing 5% horse serum and insulin (10 μg/ml). MCF7 cells stably transfected with MRJ(L) were cultured in medium containing 500 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). All cells were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. The proteosome inhibitor MG132 was purchased from Sigma, and lactacystin was from Calbiochem. MDA-MB-435 has now been confirmed to be of melanoma origin (13Rae J.M. Creighton C.J. Meck J.M. Haddad B.R. Johnson M.D. Breast Cancer Res.

Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 5292-5293Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). However, the work presented here uses this cell line as a model system for signaling studies. MCF10A is a spontaneously immortalized breast epithelial cell line (17Strickland L.B. Dawson P.J. Santner S.J. Miller F.R. Breast Cancer Res.

These cell lines were obtained from the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute (Detroit, MI). SUM159 cells were cultured in Ham’s F-12 with 5% fetal bovine serum supplemented with insulin (5 mg/ml) and hydrocortisone (1 mg/ml). The cell line SUM1315 was cultured in Ham’s F-12 with 5% fetal bovine serum supplemented with insulin (5 mg/ml) and epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml). Both SUM lines were bought from Asterand plc, Detroit, MI. TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) was used to isolate total RNA from cultured cells. RNA was treated with DNase I (Promega, Madison, WI). cDNA synthesis was carried out using a cDNA synthesis kit (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA) with 1 μg of total RNA as the template and random primers. Real time quantitative RT-PCR (QRT-PCR) analysis was performed on the experimental mRNAs. The PCR primers and probes for Dickkopf1 (DKK1), DNAJB6 (MRJ(L)), c-myc, E-cadherin, and keratin 18 and normalization control gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were purchased from Applied Biosystems Inc. QRT-PCR was performed on an ABI 7500 HT instrument (Applied Biosystems). The gene expression ΔCt values of mRNAs from each sample were calculated by normalizing with normalization control, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and relative quantitation values were plotted using GraphPad Prism® (La Jolla, CA). QRT-PCR analysis was performed on the experimental mRNAs in triplicate, and the experiment was repeated once from an independent passage to confirm the findings. pDKK-707, a luciferase construct encompassing −707 to +43 bp of human DKK1 promoter was a gift from the Varmus laboratory (21Chamorro M.N. Schwartz D.R. Vonica A. Brivanlou A.H. Cho K.R. Varmus H.E. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). M50 TOPFlash luciferase construct was a generous gift from Dr. Randall Moon (22Veeman M.T. Slusarski D.C. Kaykas A. Louie S.H. Moon R.T. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 680-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Oligo Design ToolTM (Oligoengine, Seattle, WA) was used to design two shRNAs, NM_807 and NM_808, predicted to silence the expression of MRJ(L). The heteroduplexes supplied as asymmetric oligomers were annealed following the manufacturer's instructions and cloned into pSUPERIOR.neo+GFP (Oligoengine) at the BglII and HindIII sites. Recombinants were analyzed by restriction digestion using EcoRI and HindIII (Promega), and recombinant DNA was prepared using the QIA Maxiprep kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). MCF10A cells were transfected with shRNA targeting MRJ(L) (NM_808) or a control nontargeting shRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. The extent of knockdown was assessed using QRT-PCR, using RNA isolated 32 h after transfection. Cells were transiently transfected with SMARTpool® siRNA (Dharmacon, Chicago) designed to target DKK1 or nontargeting siRNA control using Dharmafect1 (Dharmacon) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Conditioned serum-free medium and lysates were collected from both control and DKK1-siRNA-treated cells 38 h post-transfection. The extent of knockdown was assessed using Western blot analysis. Cells cultured on coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature and then permeabilized in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 3% bovine serum albumin. F-actin was stained with phalloidin-TRITC (1:100, Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature and observed after mounting the coverslip in VECTASHIELD® (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Cells were viewed using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M microscope equipped with an Axiocam camera and Axiovision software (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY). Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Total protein was harvested and luciferase activity measured using a Turner 20/20 luminometer (Turner Biosystems, Sunnyvale, CA). The luciferase reading was normalized to the total protein concentration. Data are expressed as relative luciferase activity, where control is 100%. The cell monolayer was washed twice with calcium- and magnesium-free PBS and lysed with cold lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors). The lysates were kept on ice for 1 h and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was measured using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (0.2 μm). The membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk in TBST (1 m Tris, pH 7.5, 9% NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20) and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were then washed three times with TBST, incubated with respective secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, and then developed using SuperSignalTM (Pierce) following washes for 1 h with three changes of TBST. For detection of MRJ (DNAJB6(MO1) 1:5000) was used with 5% milk in PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 after blotting, as per the manufacturer’s instructions. DNAJB6 rabbit polyclonal (MO1) and SNAI2 (Slug) antibodies were purchased from Abnova Corp. (Taipei City, Taiwan). Anti-vimentin (1:500) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and horseradish peroxidase-β-actin (1:50,000) was from Sigma. β-Tubulin, KRT18, Twist1, β-catenin, antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technologies (Danvers, MA). Antibodies were used as per the manufacturer’s instructions. MDA-MB-435 cells stably expressing MRJ(L) were plated in 6-well plates and transfected with DKK1 siRNA and control siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. After 24 h of transfection, the cells were plated into three 10-cm plates in selection medium and were allowed to grow for 12 days. Crystal violet staining was used for visualization of foci. Six different fields were counted for the number of foci, and data are represented as average ± S.E. MDA-MB-435 cells (2 × 103) treated with DKK1siRNA or control siRNA suspended in 0.35% agar were plated onto a layer of 0.75% BactoAgar in DMEM/F-12 (10% fetal bovine serum) in 6-well tissue culture dishes. Visible colonies (>50 cells) were counted after 15 days with the aid of a dissecting microscope. Cells were cultured to confluence on 6-well plates, which were previously externally marked with parallel lines to use as guides for the subsequent photography. The cells were transfected with DKK1 siRNA and control siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. After 24 h of transfection, a central linear wound (perpendicular to the guide lines) was made with a 200-μl sterile pipette tip. Media were changed gently to remove any floating cells. Phase micrographs of the wound cultures were taken at 0 and 16 h (average doubling time is about 20 h). The photographs were analyzed by measuring the distance from the wound edge of the cell sheet at the end of 16 h to the original wound site. Wound healing activity was calculated as the mean distance between edges in 12 independent fields per well. Each test group was assayed in triplicate, and the results are expressed relative to vector control cell migration. Migration assays were conducted using 8-μm polyethylene terephthalate filters (BD Pharmingen), as described previously (23Shevde L.A. Samant R.S. Paik J.C. Metge B.J. Chambers A.F. Casey G. Frost A.R. Welch D.R. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 2006; 23: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Cells (treated with DKK1siRNA or control siRNA), which migrated to the lower sides of the trans-well, were stained using 0.05% crystal violet, and the cell number was counted. Each test group was assayed in triplicate. Four different fields of each insert were photographed at 10× magnification using a Zeiss Axiocam 200 M microscope (Zeiss Axiocam, Carl Zeiss Microimaging Inc.). Each field was divided into quadrants, and cells in diagonally opposite quadrants were counted. We compared the morphology of the cells that were engineered to constitutively express MRJ(L) to the corresponding vector control. As seen in Fig. 1, A and B, MRJ(L) stable transfectants of MDA-MB-435 and MCF7 cells show a well spread/pavement-like appearance and a differential actin staining when compared with the respective controls that look elongated and spindle-shaped. The discrete morphological difference is highlighted by the extended filopodia very distinctly present on the surface of MRJ(L) expressors (Fig. 1, A and B, filopodia marked with arrows). Based on the morphological changes described in the previous result, we hypothesized that MRJ(L) expression could influence the expression of characteristic EMT markers. We analyzed the total protein extract from three different stable expressors of MRJ(L) cell lines (viz. MDA-MB-435, MCF7, and MCF10CA1d.cl.1) using Western blot analysis. MRJ(L) expressors of MDA-MB-435 show loss of several mesenchymal markers, viz. CTNNB1 (β-catenin), Vim (vimentin), CDH2 (N-cadherin), Twist1, SNAI2 (Slug), and gain of expression of epithelial marker KRT18 (keratin 18). MCF7 cell line is negative for expression of Slug, Snail, and vimentin (24Mironchik Y. Winnard Jr., P.T. Vesuna F. Kato Y. Wildes F. Pathak A.P. Kominsky S. Artemov D. Bhujwalla Z. Van Diest P. Burger H. Glackin C. Raman V. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10801-10809Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 25Sarrió D. Rodriguez-Pinilla S.M. Hardisson D. Cano A. Moreno-Bueno G. Palacios J. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 989-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). MCF10CA1d.cl.1 showed no differences in Slug or Twist, however, showed a distinct loss of vimentin expression upon MRJ(L) expression. There was no change detected in E-cadherin protein level in MCF7 and MCF10CA1d.cl.1 upon MRJ(L) expression. MDA-MB-435 is negative for E-cadherin. Loss of β-catenin and gain of keratin 18 were consistent in all three cell lines (Fig. 2). Stabilized β-catenin characteristically represents activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling. MRJ(L) expressors showed distinctly reduced levels of β-catenin protein. We saw no significant change in the steady state mRNA levels for β-catenin (data not shown); hence, we tested if this reduction was due to enhanced degradation of β-catenin. As seen in Fig. 3, A and B, the reduced levels of β-catenin in 435-MRJ(L) and MCF7-MRJ(L) were restored upon treatment with proteasome inhibitors MG132 or lactacystin. One of the prominent ways that active Wnt/β-catenin signaling manifests itself is by increased activation of TCF/LEF transcription factors. M50-TOPFlash reporter measures transcription activation by TCF/LEF transcription factors, which is indicative of active Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Hence, we evaluated TOPFlash activity in 435-MRJ(L), MCF7-MRJ(L), and MCF10CA1d.cl.1 We observed greater than 85% reduction in the TOPFlash activity in all the cell lines, indicating a significant inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling (Fig. 4, A–C). DKK1 is a secreted inhibitor of Wnt/β-catenin signaling that blocks Wnt signaling by binding to the Wnt co-receptor Lrp5/6. QRT-PCR analysis of different breast cancer cell lines showed that all of them express lower levels of DKK1 mRNA as compared with nontumorigenic MCF10A cells. SUM1315, SUM159, and MCF10.DCIS.com express very low levels of DKK1, whereas MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells seem to express slightly higher levels. The levels of DKK1 in MCF10CA1d.cl.1 cells were intermediate (Fig. 5A). We have also evaluated DKK1 mRNA levels in MDA-MB-435 and found it to be very low. Hence, we examined the MRJ(L) expressors for expression of DKK1. As seen in Fig. 5B, we observed a substantial increase in the levels of secreted DKK1 in serum-free conditioned medium from 435-MRJ(L) and MCF10CA1d.cl.1-MRJ(L) cells. These results corroborate with the increased DKK1 transcript by QRT-PCR (supplemental Fig. 1). To determine whether the increase in DKK1 is at a transcriptional level, we assessed the activity of the luciferase reporter construct pDKK1–707 in MCF10CA1d.cl.1-MRJ(L), MCF7-MRJ(L), and MDA-MB-435-MRJ(L) and compared it with the corresponding vector control. As seen in Fig. 5C, we observed a 2.5-fold up-regulation of DKK1 promoter activity in MCF7-MRJ(L), a 10-fold up-regulation in MCF10CA1d.cl.1-MRJ(L), and 6-fold up-regulation in MDA-MB-435. DKK1 binding to the Lrp5/6 receptors directs β-catenin to phosphorylation and subsequent proteosome-mediated degradation. If the degradation of β-catenin in MRJ(L) expressing cells is due to the elevated DKK1 levels, silencing DKK1 expression in MRJ(L)-expressing cells should lead to increased β-catenin levels. We treated 435-MRJ(L) with DKK1 siRNA and compared their β-catenin levels with 435-MRJ(L) cells independently treated with control siRNA. We found that silencing DKK1 from MRJ(L) expressors can restore β-catenin levels (Fig. 6A). MCF10CA1d.cl.1 MRJ(L) expressors also show comparable restoration of β-catenin levels upon DKK1 silencing (Fig. 6B). For reasons not known to us, we always noticed a slight elevation of β-catenin in the control siRNA transfectants of MCF10CA1d.cl.1MRJ(L). Because most of the elevated mesenchymal markers observed by us in Fig. 2 are downstream targets of β-catenin transcription, we hypothesized that DKK1 silencing will increase the β-catenin protein levels and result in changes in the transcript levels of the mesenchymal markers. We explored the effect of DKK1 silencing, in MDA-MB-435-MRJ(L), on the EMT markers (supplemental Fig. 2). We observed that there was a noticeable up-regulation of mesenchymal markers, vimentin (3.1-fold), Slug (5.2-fold), Twist (7.5-fold), and N-cadherin (1.4-fold). As expected, there was no noticeable change in the β-catenin transcript. However, we did not observe significant up-regulation of epithelial marker, keratin 18. We had previously reported that MRJ(L) expression reduced malignant activity of cancer cell lines as measured by in vitro assays. Cells ectopically expressing MRJ(L) showed reduced invasion through MatrigelTM and reduced migration using modified Boyden chamber assay, decreased scratch motility (wound healing) assay, and less anchorage independence as measured by soft agar colony formation. If the reduced malignant behavior of MRJ(L) expressor cells was due to the inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling by the elevated DKK1 levels, silencing DKK1 expression will revert their phenotype and make them more malignant. As observed from the data in Fig. 7, silencing of DKK1 from 435-MRJ(L) increased the foci formation ability by about 3-fold (Fig. 7A), its motility (wound healing ability) by about 2-fold (Fig. 7B), and anchorage-independent growth as measured by soft agar colony formation by about 2.5-fold (Fig. 7C). MCF10A (immortalized breast epithelial line), expresses noticeably high levels of MRJ(L) as compared with breast cancer cell lines (7Mitra A. Fillmore R.A. Metge B.J. Rajesh M. Xi Y. King J. Ju J. Pannell L. Shevde L.A. Samant R.S. Breast Cancer Res. 2008; 10: R22Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Based on our observations described thus far, we hypothesized that knockdown of MRJ(L) from MCF10A would activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling. As seen in Fig. 8A, knockdown of MRJ(L) using shRNA NM_808 increases the β-catenin levels. We independently tested the activity of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the MCF10A-MRJ(L) knockdown cells using M50-TOPFlash reporter assays. We saw a significant and reproducible activation of the reporter in the MRJ(L) knockdown cells, indicative of active Wnt/β-catenin signaling (Fig. 8A). We tested the effect of MRJ(L) knockdown on invasion and motility. We saw a significant (p < 0.05) 1.5 times increase in number of cells migrated. The invasion ability of the knockdown cells was doubled. These observations indicated a shift toward a malignant phenotype. To test if the MCF10A cells, which show a mostly epithelial phenotype, will show a shift toward a mesenchymal phenotype, we evaluated the changes in transcript levels of some key epithelial markers upon MRJ(L) knockdown from MCF10A cells. As seen in Fig. 8C, we observed that the shRNA knockdown of MRJ(L) was accompanied by a concomitant reduction in DKK1 transcript and down-regulation of CDH1 (E-cadherin) transcript indicating loss of epithelial phenotype. c-Myc is a key oncogenic target of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling. We observed that MRJ(L) knockdown increased c-Myc transcript in MCF10A by 2.5-fold, suggesting activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. However, we did not see any change in the levels of KRT18 (keratin 18), an epithelial marker that gets up-regulated at protein levels upon MRJ(L) overexpression. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are a group of proteins whose expression is increased when cells are exposed to stress; however, HSPs are also present in cells under normal conditions (26Rylander M.N.

Even this moderate warming had major impacts on Earth's ecological and biological systems, especially in the Arctic where the magnitude of abiotic changes even exceeds those in temperate and tropical biomes. Therefore, understanding the biological consequences of climate change on high latitudes is of critical importance for future conservation of the species living in this habitat. The past 25,000 years can be used as a model for such changes, as they were marked by prominent climatic changes that influenced geographical distribution, demographic history and pattern of genetic variation of many extant species. We sequenced ancient and modern DNA of the collared lemming (Dicrostonyx torquatus), which is a key species of the arctic biota, from a single site (Pymva Shor, Northern Pre Urals, Russia) to see if climate warming events after the Last Glacial Maximum had detectable effects on the genetic variation of this arctic rodent species, which is strongly associated with a cold and dry climate.Using three dimensional network reconstructions we found a dramatic decline in genetic diversity following the LGM. Model-based approaches such as Approximate Bayesian Computation and Markov Chain Monte Carlo based Bayesian inference show that there is evidence for a population decline in the collared lemming following the LGM, with the population size dropping to a minimum during the Greenland Interstadial 1 (Bølling/Allerød) warming phase at 14.5 kyrs BP.Our results show that previous climate warming events had a strong influence on genetic diversity and population size of collared lemmings. Due to its already severely compromised genetic diversity a similar population reduction as a result of the predicted future climate change could completely abolish the remaining genetic diversity in this population. Local population extinctions of collared lemmings would have severe effects on the arctic ecosystem, as collared lemmings are a key species in the trophic interactions and ecosystem processes in the Arctic."
https://openalex.org/W2069962157,"Bile acid deficiency is a serious syndrome in newborns that can result in death if untreated. 5beta-Reductase deficiency is one form of bile acid deficiency and is characterized by dramatically decreased levels of physiologically active 5beta-reduced bile acids. AKR1D1 (aldo-keto reductase 1D1) is the only known human enzyme that stereo-specifically reduces the Delta(4) double bond in 3-keto steroids and sterols to yield the 5beta-hydrogenated product. Analysis of the AKR1D1 gene in five patients with 5beta-reductase deficiency revealed five different mutations resulting in an amino acid substitution in the protein. To investigate a causal role for these observed point mutations in AKR1D1 in 5beta-reductase deficiency, we characterized their effect on enzymatic properties. Attempts to purify mutant enzymes by overexpression in Escherichia coli only yielded sufficient amounts of the P133R mutant for further characterization. This enzyme displayed a highly reduced K(m) and V(max) reminiscent of uncompetitive kinetics with 4-cholesten-7alpha-ol-3-one as substrate. In addition, this mutant displayed no change in cofactor affinity but was more thermolabile in the absence of NADPH as judged by CD spectroscopy. All mutants were compared following expression in HEK 293 cells. Although these enzymes were equally expressed based on mRNA levels, protein expression and functional activity were dramatically reduced. Cycloheximide treatment also revealed that several of the expressed mutants were less stable. Our findings show that the reported mutations in AKR1D1 in patients with 5beta-reductase lead to significantly decreased levels of active enzyme and could be causal in the development of bile acid deficiency syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2147859503,"Background Natural selection can shape specific cognitive abilities and the extent to which a given species relies on various cues when learning associations between stimuli and rewards. Because the flower bat Glossophaga soricina feeds primarily on nectar, and the locations of nectar-producing flowers remain constant, G. soricina might be predisposed to learn to associate food with locations. Indeed, G. soricina has been observed to rely far more heavily on spatial cues than on shape cues when relocating food, and to learn poorly when shape alone provides a reliable cue to the presence of food. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we determined whether G. soricina would learn to use scent cues as indicators of the presence of food when such cues were also available. Nectar-producing plants fed upon by G. soricina often produce distinct, intense odors. We therefore expected G. soricina to relocate food sources using scent cues, particularly the flower-produced compound, dimethyl disulfide, which is attractive even to G. soricina with no previous experience of it. We also compared the learning of associations between cues and food sources by G. soricina with that of a related fruit-eating bat, Carollia perspicillata. We found that (1) G. soricina did not learn to associate scent cues, including dimethyl disulfide, with feeding sites when the previously rewarded spatial cues were also available, and (2) both the fruit-eating C. perspicillata and the flower-feeding G. soricina were significantly more reliant on spatial cues than associated sensory cues for relocating food. Conclusions/Significance These findings, taken together with past results, provide evidence of a powerful, experience-independent predilection of both species to rely on spatial cues when attempting to relocate food."
https://openalex.org/W2091212818,"Current theoretical models of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have proposed that impairments in the processing of social/emotional information may be linked to amygdala dysfunction. However, the extent to which amygdala functions are compromised in ASD has become a topic of debate in recent years. In a jittered functional magnetic resonance imaging study, sub-threshold presentations of anxious faces permitted an examination of amygdala recruitment in 12 high functioning adult males with ASD and 12 matched controls. We found heightened neural activation of the amygdala in both high functioning adults with ASD and matched controls. Neither the intensity nor the time-course of amygdala activation differed between the groups. However, the adults with ASD showed significantly lower levels of fusiform activation during the trials compared to controls. Our findings suggest that in ASD, the transmission of socially salient information along sub-cortical pathways is intact: and yet the signaling of this information to structures downstream may be impoverished, and the pathways that facilitate subsequent processing deficient."
https://openalex.org/W2044718587,"The family of Hox-proteins has been a major focus of research for over 30 years. Hox-proteins are crucial to the correct development of bilateral organisms, however, some uncertainty remains as to which Hox-proteins are functionally equivalent across different species. Initial classification of Hox-proteins was based on phylogenetic analysis of the 60 amino acid homeodomain. This approach was successful in classifying Hox-proteins with differing homeodomains, but the relationships of Hox-proteins with nearly identical homeodomains, yet distinct biological functions, could not be resolved. Correspondingly, these ‘problematic’ proteins were classified into one large unresolved group. Other classifications used the relative location of the Hox-protein coding genes on the chromosome (synteny) to further resolve this group. Although widely used, this synteny-based classification is inconsistent with experimental evidence from functional equivalence studies. These inconsistencies led us to re-examine and derive a new classification for the Hox-protein family using all Hox-protein sequences available in the GenBank non-redundant protein database (NCBI-nr). We compare the use of the homeodomain, the homeodomain with conserved flanking regions (the YPWM and linker region), and full length Hox-protein sequences as a basis for classification of Hox-proteins. In contrast to previous attempts, our approach is able to resolve the relationships for the ‘problematic’ as well as ABD-B-like Hox-proteins. We highlight differences to previous classifications and clarify the relationships of Hox-proteins across the five major model organisms, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Branchiostoma floridae, Mus musculus and Danio rerio. Comparative and functional analysis of Hox-proteins, two fields crucial to understanding the development of bilateral organisms, have been hampered by difficulties in predicting functionally equivalent Hox-proteins across species. Our classification scheme offers a higher-resolution classification that is in accordance with phylogenetic as well as experimental data and, thereby, provides a novel basis for experiments, such as comparative and functional analyses of Hox-proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1991477470,"Although five 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5-HT3) subunits (A-E) have been cloned, knowledge on the regulation of their assembly is limited. RIC-3 has been identified as a chaperone specific for the pentameric ligand-gated nicotinic acetylcholine and 5-HT(3) receptors. Therefore, we examined the impact of RIC-3 on differently composed 5-HT(3) receptors with the focus on 5-HT3C, -D, and -E subunits. The influence of RIC-3 on these receptor subtypes is supported by the presence of RIC3 mRNA in tissues expressing at least one of the subunits 5-HT3C, -D, and -E. Furthermore, immunocytochemical studies on transfected mammalian cells revealed co-localization in the endoplasmic reticulum and direct interaction of RIC-3 with 5-HT3A, -C, -D, and -E. Functional and pharmacological characterization was performed using HEK293 cells expressing 5-HT3A or 5-HT3A + 5-HT3B (or -C, -D, or -E) in the presence or absence of RIC-3. Ca(2+) influx analyses revealed that RIC-3 does not influence the 5-HT concentration-response relationship on 5-HT(3)A receptors but leads to differential increases of 5-HT-induced maximum response (E(max)) on cells expressing different subunits. Increases of E(max) were due to analogously enhanced B(max) values for binding of the 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist [(3)H]GR65630. The observed enhanced cell surface expression of the tested 5-HT3 subunit combinations correlated with the increased surface expression of 5-HT3A as determined by flow cytometry. In conclusion, we showed that RIC-3 can interact with 5-HT3A, -C, -D, and -E subunits and predominantly enhances the surface expression of homomeric 5-HT(3)A receptors in HEK293 cells. These data implicate a possible role of RIC-3 in determining 5-HT(3) receptor composition in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2046907644,"Transport of acetyl-CoA between intracellular compartments is mediated by carnitine acetyltransferases (Cats) that reversibly link acetyl units to the carrier molecule carnitine. The genome of the opportunistic pathogenic yeast Candida albicans encodes several (putative) Cats: the peroxisomal and mitochondrial Cat2 isoenzymes encoded by a single gene and the carnitine acetyltransferase homologs Yat1 and Yat2. To determine the contributions of the individual Cats, various carnitine acetyltransferase mutant strains were constructed and subjected to phenotypic and biochemical analyses on different carbon sources.

IntroductionCompartmentalization is one of the main characteristics of eukaryotic cells, and separation of metabolic pathways to different organelles is thought to convey an advantage over the unicompartmental system of bacteria. However, the consequence of compartmentalization is that the various pathways at the different locations must be interconnected, requiring the transport of metabolites over the organellar membranes. Acetyl-CoA is a central metabolite that is the product and substrate of many pathways that partake in carbon metabolism. When yeast cells are grown on glucose, acetyl-CoA is produced in the mitochondria, where it can directly enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle to be oxidized to CO2 and H2O. However, during growth on other carbon sources like fatty acids, ethanol, or acetate, acetyl-CoA is produced in different locations in the cell, requiring shuttling of acetyl units between compartments. Utilization of ethanol or acetate as sole carbon source results in the cytosolic production of acetyl-CoA, whereas during growth on fatty acids, acetyl-CoA is produced in peroxisomes, the sole site of β-oxidation of fatty acids in most yeasts (1Kunau W.H. Dommes V. Schulz H. Prog. Lipid. Res. 1995; 34: 267-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Acetyl-CoA cannot cross the organellar membranes without the aid of the carrier molecule carnitine (2van Roermund C.W. Elgersma Y. Singh N. Wanders R.J. Tabak H.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3480-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Acetyl units are reversibly bound to carnitine by carnitine acetyltransferases (Cats), 4The abbreviations used are: Catcarnitine acetyltransferaseMTSmitochondrial targeting signalYNByeast nitrogen baseMCSmultiple cloning siteMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidHAhemagglutinin. forming acetylcarnitine, which can be transported over the membrane. In the target organelle, the reverse reaction also catalyzed by Cat takes place, converting acetylcarnitine to acetyl-CoA and carnitine.We and others have shown previously that in the opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans, acetyl unit transport is strictly dependent on the carrier molecule carnitine, which is synthesized endogenously (3Strijbis K. van Roermund C.W. Hardy G.P. van den Burg J. Bloem K. de Haan J. van Vlies N. Wanders R.J. Vaz F.M. Distel B. FASEB J. 2009; 23: 2349-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and the activity of the major carnitine acetyltransferase (Cat2) while growing on oleic acid, ethanol, or acetate (4Zhou H.

In both C. albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the products of the CAT2 gene are dually localized to peroxisomes and mitochondria (5Strijbis K. van Roermund C.W. Visser W.F. Mol E.C. van den Burg J. MacCallum D.M. Odds F.C. Paramonova E. Krom B.P. Distel B. Eukaryot. Cell. 2008; 7: 610-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 6Elgersma Y. van Roermund C.W. Wanders R.J. Tabak H.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3472-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The mechanism of dual localization of Cat2 has been extensively studied in S. cerevisiae, and it was shown that CAT2 has two in-frame start codons that are regulated by carbon source-dependent transcription initiation (6Elgersma Y. van Roermund C.W. Wanders R.J. Tabak H.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3472-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The longer transcript codes for a protein containing a mitochondrial targeting signal (MTS), and thus its translation product is targeted to mitochondria. The protein encoded by the shorter transcript lacks the MTS and is targeted to peroxisomes via its C-terminal peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS1). The presence of both a MTS and PTS1 in C. albicans Cat2 suggests that a similar mechanism may cause the dual localization in this organism.It is thought that peroxisomal Cat2 is involved in export of acetyl-CoA produced in the peroxisomes during β-oxidation when cells are grown on fatty acids. The main function of the mitochondrial Cat2 is presumably to release acetyl-CoA from acetylcarnitine in the mitochondria. Growth on fatty acids, ethanol, or acetate as the sole carbon source requires the activity of the microorganism-specific glyoxylate cycle. The most important feature of the glyoxylate cycle is that it bypasses the decarboxylation steps of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, thereby enabling the synthesis of malate (C4) from acetyl-CoA (C2) and glyoxylate (C2) for gluconeogenesis. This key reaction of the glyoxylate cycle is catalyzed by malate synthase (Mls1). Both the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the glyoxylate cycle are, therefore, dependent on acetyl-CoA supply. Because Mls1 and the other key enzyme of the glyoxylate cycle (i.e. isocitrate lyase (Icl1)) are peroxisomal in C. albicans (7Piekarska K. Hardy G. Mol E. van den Burg J. Strijbis K. van Roermund C. van den Berg M. Distel B. Microbiology. 2008; 154: 3061-3072Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), growth on C2 carbon sources, such as ethanol and acetate, requires import of acetyl-CoA into peroxisomes. Whether this import is carnitine-dependent is not known.Both S. cerevisiae and C. albicans encode two other (putative) Cats: Yat1 (also known as Ctn1 in C. albicans) and Yat2 (also known as Ctn3). Through phenotypic analyses of S. cerevisiae and C. albicans yat1 and yat2 null mutants, the Yats were hypothesized to function in transport of cytosolic acetyl-CoA produced during growth on ethanol and acetate to mitochondria and/or peroxisomes (4Zhou H. Lorenz M.C. Microbiology. 2008; 154: 500-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 8Prigneau O. Porta A. Maresca B. Fungal Genet.

However, whether YAT1 and YAT2 encode true Cats in both organisms remains to be established. An S. cerevisiae cat2 null mutant displays very little (<5%) residual Cat activity (5Strijbis K. van Roermund C.W. Visser W.F. Mol E.C. van den Burg J. MacCallum D.M. Odds F.C. Paramonova E.

In S. cerevisiae, unmodified Yat1 was found to be associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane (11Schmalix W. Bandlow W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27428-27439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas C-terminally tagged Yat2-GFP localized to the cytosol (12Franken J. Kroppenstedt S. Swiegers J.H. Bauer F.F. Curr. Genet. 2008; 53: 347-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The localization of Yat1 and Yat2 in C. albicans remains to be established.Although it has been firmly established that the CAT2 gene is indispensable during growth of C. albicans on non-fermentable carbon sources (4Zhou H. Lorenz M.C. Microbiology. 2008; 154: 500-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 5Strijbis K. van Roermund C.W. Visser W.F. Mol E.C. van den Burg J. MacCallum D.M. Odds F.C. Paramonova E. Krom B.P. Distel B. Eukaryot. Cell. 2008; 7: 610-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), our understanding of the flow of acetyl units between the peroxisomal, cytosolic, and mitochondrial compartments and the individual roles of mitochondrial and peroxisomal Cat2, Yat1, and Yat2 in this process is very limited. In this study, we use a variety of Cat2, Yat1, and Yat2 mutants to address the localization and function of the Cat2 isozymes and the carnitine acetyltransferase homologs Yat1 and Yat2. Based on the biochemical and phenotypic analyses of the constructed mutants, we present a model explaining the flow of acetyl units between the peroxisomal, mitochondrial, and cytosolic compartments in C. albicans and the role of each of the Cats in this process.DISCUSSIONTo unravel the mechanism of carnitine-dependent acetyl unit transport between organelles, we performed a detailed functional analysis of the three (putative) Cats of C. albicans, Cat2, Yat1, and Yat2. To dissect the individual roles of the peroxisomal and mitochondrial Cat2, we constructed mutant strains expressing only one of the two isoenzymes and strains lacking either Yat1 or Yat2 or both. We determined the localization of all proteins by HA tagging and subcellular fractionation. Based on detailed phenotypic and biochemical analyses of the various mutant strains, we present a model for carnitine-dependent transport between the peroxisomal, mitochondrial, and cytosolic compartments in C. albicans (Fig. 6).Formation of Acetylcarnitine in the Cytosol; Role of Yat1 and Yat2During growth on non-fermentable carbon sources other than fatty acids, such as acetate and ethanol, acetyl-CoA is produced in the cytosol and needs to be transported to both peroxisomes, where the key enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle, Mls1 and Icl1, are localized (7Piekarska K. Hardy G. Mol E. van den Burg J. Strijbis K. van Roermund C. van den Berg M. Distel B. Microbiology. 2008; 154: 3061-3072Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and to mitochondria to feed into the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Although both Yat1 and Yat2 are cytosolic (Fig. 2B), our data show that the enzymes do not have redundant functions because acetylcarnitine formation in the cytosol strictly depends on Yat1, whereas Yat2 does not contribute to this process (Fig. 1, B and C). Although we have been unable to directly measure Cat activity for either Yat1 or Yat2, the phenotypes of the various mutant strains strongly suggest that Yat1 is a true carnitine acetyltransferase. In the c2/y2/y1Δ/Δ + CAT2 strain, acetate oxidation is blocked, and this strain cannot grow on acetate or ethanol, whereas growth on oleate is unaffected (Fig. 4, A and B). These observations are in line with the results reported by Zhou and Lorenz (4Zhou H. Lorenz M.C. Microbiology. 2008; 154: 500-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) who showed that a yat1 null strain is unable to grow on acetate or ethanol. Intriguingly, a strain lacking the cytosolic Yats also cannot grow on citrate (Fig. 4A) (4Zhou H. Lorenz M.C. Microbiology. 2008; 154: 500-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These results indicate that during growth on citrate, acetyl-CoA is generated in the cytosol, which is subsequently linked to carnitine by Yat1/(Yat2). In support of this, we show that the mitochondrial Cat2 and, to a lesser extent, peroxisomal Cat2 are required for citrate utilization (Fig. 4A).Import of Acetyl Units into Mitochondria; Role of Mitochondrial Cat2Activity of the mitochondrial Cat2 is very likely to be associated with the (intra)mitochondrial conversion of acetylcarnitine to acetyl-CoA, which feeds into the tricarboxylic acid cycle, generating reducing equivalents that can be used for ATP synthesis. Acetyl-CoA can be produced directly in the mitochondria from cytosolic pyruvate by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Therefore, growth on glucose does not require acetyl unit transport, and likewise acetyl unit transport is not strictly required during growth on lactate. Indeed, none of the mutant stains showed a growth defect on glucose, and growth on lactate was only mildly affected in some mutants (Fig. 4A). Not surprisingly, we showed that the mitochondrial Cat2 is essential during growth on oleate, ethanol, and acetate because all of these carbon sources require import of acetyl units into the mitochondria. Accordingly, the perCAT2 strain that lacks the mitochondrial Cat2 cannot grow on or utilize these non-fermentable carbon sources (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5). The perCAT2 strain displays reduced growth on lactate, suggesting that not all pyruvate synthesized from lactate directly enters the mitochondria, but part is converted to acetyl-CoA in the cytosol via pyruvate decarboxylase (Pdc) (Fig. 6). That this pathway is operational in C. albicans has been suggested previously, based on the observation that an icl1 null mutant is unable to grow on lactate (31Piekarska K. Mol E. van den Berg M.

Visser W.F. Mol E.C. van den Burg J. MacCallum D.M. Odds F.C. Paramonova E. Krom B.P. Distel B. Eukaryot. Cell. 2008; 7: 610-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The activity of the peroxisomal Cat2 is thought to be involved in the export of acetyl units produced during β-oxidation of fatty acids. Peroxisomal Cat2 links the acetyl units to carnitine, and acetylcarnitine can cross the membrane and be transported further to the mitochondria. Our data show that although peroxisomal Cat2 is essential for growth on oleate (Fig. 4), the mitCAT2 strain is still able to oxidize fatty acids (Fig. 5). The β-oxidation assay used measures the production of labeled CO2 from 14C-labeled oleic acid in whole cells and therefore requires a functional peroxisomal β-oxidation, transport of acetyl units from peroxisomes to mitochondria, and a functional tricarboxylic acid cycle in which CO2 can be produced. The mitCAT2 strain shows a very high production of CO2 and incorporation of label in acid-soluble intermediates (Fig. 5) (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that under these conditions, acetyl units are transported from peroxisomes to mitochondria, even in the absence of peroxisomal Cat2. A possible way to export acetyl units independently of peroxisomal Cat2 is the conversion of acetyl-CoA to acetate by a peroxisomal thioesterase or a putative peroxisomal acetyl-CoA hydrolase (Fig. 6, dashed box 1). In mammals, peroxisomal thioesterases and carnitine-acyl/acetyltransferases were shown to be differentially expressed and suggested to provide complementary systems for exporting β-oxidation products from peroxisomes (33Westin M.A. Hunt M.C. Alexson S.E. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 982-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Whereas S. cerevisiae has a single peroxisomal thioesterase (Tes1) (34Leighton F. Bergseth S. Rørtveit T. Christiansen E.N. Bremer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10347-10350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the C. albicans genome encodes five putative thioesterases, of which four have a likely PTS1 (-AKLCOOH or -SRLCOOH). Thioesterases hydrolyze acyl-CoAs to the corresponding free fatty acids. Several studies have suggested, however, that peroxisomes may also contain acetyl-CoA thioesterase activity (35Wilcke M. Alexson S.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 36Osmundsen H. Neat C.E. Borrebaek B. Int. J.

Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 993-999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and an acetyl-CoA thioesterase referred to as ACOT12 has been detected in isolated peroxisomes of rats and mice (38Nakanishi Y. Okamoto K. Isohashi F. J. Biochem. 1994; 115: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 39Wiese S. Gronemeyer T. Ofman R. Kunze M. Grou C.P. Almeida J.A. Eisenacher M. Stephan C. Hayen H.

Cell Proteomics. 2007; 6: 2045-2057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). It remains to be investigated if one of the C. albicans isoenzymes is localized to peroxisomes and has acetyl-CoA thioesterase activity. Another possibility to produce acetate from acetyl-CoA is posed by the enzyme acetyl-CoA hydrolase (Ach1); however, this protein is predicted to be cytosolic in C. albicans because it lacks obvious (peroxisomal) targeting signals. The produced acetate might be able to cross the peroxisomal membrane by active transport or diffusion. Recent data show that the peroxisomal membrane contains pore-forming proteins that enable transfer of small molecules across the membrane (40Grunau S. Mindthoff S. Rottensteiner H. Sormunen R.T. Hiltunen J.K. Erdmann R. Antonenkov V.D. FEBS J. 2009; 276: 1698-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 41Rokka A. Antonenkov V.D. Soininen R. Immonen H.L. Pirilä P.L. Bergmann U. Sormunen R.T. Weckström M. Benz R. Hiltunen J.K. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e5090Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). It remains to be investigated whether these channel-forming proteins also mediate the export of acetate from the peroxisome. In plants, transport of acetate in the other direction (from cytosol to peroxisomes) was shown to be dependent on the Comatose transporter (Cts) that is also the acyl-CoA transporter in plants (42Hooks M.A. Turner J.E. Murphy E.C. Johnston K.A. Burr S. Jarosławski S. Biochem. J. 2007; 406: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Pxa1 and Pxa2 are the yeast orthologs of Cts; therefore, these transporters might also play a role in acetate transport (43Hettema E.H. van Roermund C.W. Distel B. van den Berg M. Vilela C. Rodrigues-Pousada C. Wanders R.J. Tabak H.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Upon arrival in the cytosol, acetate can be converted to acetyl-CoA by one of the cytosolic acetyl-CoA synthases (Acs1 or Asc2), linked to carnitine by a cytosolic carnitine acetyltransferase (most likely Yat1), and transported to mitochondria. The fact that oxidation of oleate by the mitCAT2 strain is dependent on cytosolic Yat1/(Yat2) supports the hypothesis that it is indeed acetate that is being transported to the cytosol. If true, it is remarkable that this carnitine-independent export of C2 units appears to be very efficient, as can be deduced form the high CO2 production measured in the β-oxidation assay (Fig. 5A). Despite the high β-oxidation activity, biomass formation from fatty acids is strongly reduced in the mitCAT2 strain both in minimal and rich oleate medium (Fig. 4, A and B, and supplemental Fig. S1A), an unexpected finding that is discussed below.Uncoupling of β-Oxidation and Glyoxylate Cycle in the mitCAT2 StrainOne of our most striking observations is that the mitCAT2 strain is still able to β-oxidize fatty acids but cannot efficiently use these fatty acids for energy conservation and biomass formation and thus for growth. Analysis of the mitCAT2 strain suggests that the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the key enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle, Icl1 and Mls1, are functional (data not shown). However, the levels of (iso)citrate were found to be strongly elevated when cells were incubated in rich oleate medium (data not shown). Because (iso)citrate produced in the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle must be transported to peroxisomes to feed into the glyoxylate cycle, the accumulation of (iso)citrate suggests a transport defect of this metabolite, either its export out of the mitochondria or its import into peroxisomes. We also found that peroxisomes in the mitCAT2 strain grown on rich oleate medium have a very irregular shape and a change in size compared with wild type cells (supplemental Fig. S1, B–F). An increase in size and a changed peroxisomal morphology have been previously connected to transport deficiencies of glyoxylate cycle intermediates in C. albicans (7Piekarska K. Hardy G. Mol E. van den Burg J. Strijbis K. van Roermund C. van den Berg M. Distel B. Microbiology. 2008; 154: 3061-3072Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and we speculate that the aberrant peroxisomal morphology of the mitCAT2 strain might cause a similar transport defect. In this scheme, (iso)citrate would not be able to enter the peroxisomal glyoxylate cycle due to changed peroxisomal morphology, resulting in a block in synthesis of C4 units for gluconeogenesis and thus growth (Fig. 6, marked 3). This hypothesis is strengthened by our observation that although the icl1 null mutant is unable to grow on fatty acids (31Piekarska K. Mol E. van den Berg M. Hardy G. van den Burg J. van Roermund C. MacCallum D. Odds F. Distel B. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 1847-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 44Lorenz M.C. Fink G.R. Nature. 2001; 412: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar), it does show wild type levels of β-oxidation activity (Fig. 5).Transport of Acetyl Units from Cytosol to PeroxisomesDuring growth of C. albicans on non-fermentable carbon sources other than fatty acids, such as ethanol and acetate, acetyl-CoA is produced in the cytosol and needs to be imported into peroxisomes where the key enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle, Mls1 and Icl1, are localized (7Piekarska K. Hardy G. Mol E. van den Burg J. Strijbis K. van Roermund C. van den Berg M. Distel B. Microbiology. 2008; 154: 3061-3072Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that under these conditions, Yat1 is involved in acetylcarnitine synthesis in the cytosol (see above), which is subsequently imported into peroxisomes where perCAT2 catalyzes the reverse reaction, generating acetyl-CoA in the peroxisomal matrix (Fig. 6, dashed box 2). However, our results suggest that under certain conditions, acetate is transported over the peroxisomal membrane and converted to acetyl-CoA in the peroxisomal matrix (Fig. 6, dashed box 1). In the presence of acetate or ethanol as a carbon source, lack of peroxisomal Cat2 leads to a growth delay that can be solved by the addition of carnitine (Fig. 4, C and D). We have shown previously that the substrate of the carnitine biosynthesis pathway, trimethyllysine, is the limiting factor during growth of C. albicans on non-fermentable carbon sources (3Strijbis K. van Roermund C.W. Hardy G.P. van den Burg J. Bloem K. de Haan J. van Vlies N. Wanders R.J. Vaz F.M. Distel B. FASEB J. 2009; 23: 2349-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The carnitine-dependent growth phenotype of the mitCAT2 strain on acetate and ethanol suggests that intracellular carnitine is most likely depleted by trapping of carnitine in acetylcarnitine in the peroxisomal compartment. The nearly wild type growth rates on acetate/ethanol of the mitCAT2 strain in the presence of sufficient carnitine suggest that transport of acetyl units from the cytosol to the mitochondria is carnitine-mediated but that transport to the peroxisomes occurs independent of carnitine and perCAT2, most likely in the form of acetate. In this model, acetate is converted to acetyl-CoA by a peroxisomal acetyl-CoA synthase and can subsequently enter the glyoxylate cycle. Whether acetyl-CoA synthase is peroxisomal in C. albicans remains to be established. Therefore, we conclude that in C. albicans, bidirectional acetate transport over the peroxisomal, but not the mitochondrial, membrane is likely to occur in addition to the carnitine-dependent transport of acetyl units between compartments. IntroductionCompartmentalization is one of the main characteristics of eukaryotic cells, and separation of metabolic pathways to different organelles is thought to convey an advantage over the unicompartmental system of bacteria. However, the consequence of compartmentalization is that the various pathways at the different locations must be interconnected, requiring the transport of metabolites over the organellar membranes. Acetyl-CoA is a central metabolite that is the product and substrate of many pathways that partake in carbon metabolism. When yeast cells are grown on glucose, acetyl-CoA is produced in the mitochondria, where it can directly enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle to be oxidized to CO2 and H2O. However, during growth on other carbon sources like fatty acids, ethanol, or acetate, acetyl-CoA is produced in different locations in the cell, requiring shuttling of acetyl units between compartments. Utilization of ethanol or acetate as sole carbon source results in the cytosolic production of acetyl-CoA, whereas during growth on fatty acids, acetyl-CoA is produced in peroxisomes, the sole site of β-oxidation of fatty acids in most yeasts (1Kunau W.H. Dommes V. Schulz H. Prog. Lipid. Res. 1995; 34: 267-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Acetyl-CoA cannot cross the organellar membranes without the aid of the carrier molecule carnitine (2van Roermund C.W. Elgersma Y. Singh N. Wanders R.J. Tabak H.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3480-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Acetyl units are reversibly bound to carnitine by carnitine acetyltransferases (Cats), 4The abbreviations used are: Catcarnitine acetyltransferaseMTSmitochondrial targeting signalYNByeast nitrogen baseMCSmultiple cloning siteMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidHAhemagglutinin. forming acetylcarnitine, which can be transported over the membrane. In the target organelle, the reverse reaction also catalyzed by Cat takes place, converting acetylcarnitine to acetyl-CoA and carnitine.We and others have shown previously that in the opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans, acetyl unit transport is strictly dependent on the carrier molecule carnitine, which is synthesized endogenously (3Strijbis K. van Roermund C.W.

Research on letter perception has mainly focussed on the visual properties of letters, showing that orthographic representations are abstract and size/shape invariant. But given that letters are, by definition, mappings between symbols and sounds, what is the role of sound in orthographic representation? We present two experiments suggesting that letters are fundamentally sound-based representations. To examine the role of sound in orthographic representation, we took advantage of the multiple scripts of Japanese. We show two types of evidence that if a Japanese word is presented in a script it never appears in, this presentation immediately activates the (“actual”) visual word form of that lexical item. First, equal amounts of masked repetition priming are observed for full repetition and when the prime appears in an atypical script. Second, visual word form frequency affects neuromagnetic measures already at 100–130 ms whether the word is presented in its conventional script or in a script it never otherwise appears in. This suggests that Japanese orthographic codes are not only shape-invariant, but also script invariant. The finding that two characters belonging to different writing systems can activate the same form representation suggests that sound identity is what determines orthographic identity: as long as two symbols express the same sound, our minds represent them as part of the same character/letter."
https://openalex.org/W2021316954,"Background Genome-wide association scans for genetic loci underlying both Mendelian and complex traits are increasingly common in canine genetics research. However, the demand for high-quality DNA for use on such platforms creates challenges for traditional blood sample ascertainment. Though the use of saliva as a means of collecting DNA is common in human studies, alternate means of DNA collection for canine research have instead been limited to buccal swabs, from which dog DNA is of insufficient quality and yield for use on most high-throughput array-based systems. We thus investigated an animal-based saliva collection method for ease of use and quality of DNA obtained and tested the performance of saliva-extracted canine DNA on genome-wide genotyping arrays. Methodology/Principal Findings Overall, we found that saliva sample collection using this method was efficient. Extractions yielded high concentrations (∼125 ng/ul) of high-quality DNA that performed equally well as blood-extracted DNA on the Illumina Infinium canine genotyping platform, with average call rates >99%. Concordance rates between genotype calls of saliva- versus blood-extracted DNA samples from the same individual were also >99%. Additionally, in silico calling of copy number variants was successfully performed and verified by PCR. Conclusions/Significance Our findings validate the use of saliva-obtained samples for genome-wide association studies in canines, highlighting an alternative means of collecting samples in a convenient and non-invasive manner."
https://openalex.org/W2051618552,"Background Ecological immunology has focused on the costs of investment in immunocompetence. However, understanding optimal resource allocation to immune defence requires also identification of its benefits, which are likely to occur only when parasites are abundant. Methodology We manipulated the abundance of parasitic hen fleas in blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) nests, and supplemented their hosts, the nestlings, with methionine (a sulphur amino acid enhancing cell-mediated immunity) during day 3–6. We found a significant interaction between these two experimental factors on the development of immune defences and growth rates. Only in parasitized nests did methionine supplementation boost immune (PHA) response, and did nestling with experimentally increased immunocompetence show a relatively faster growth rate than control nestlings between days 6–9. Hence, the allocation of resources into immune defence and its growth-benefits are apparent only in presence of parasites. The main cost of methionine-induced increased allocation to the immune system was an increase in mortality, independently of ectoparasites. Nestlings in all treatments compensated initial growth reduction and all reached equal body size at day 16 (just prior to fledging), indicating a lack of long-term benefits. In addition, methionine treatment tended (P = 0.09) to lower circulating plasma immunoglobulin levels, possibly indicating a trade-off between the cell-mediated and humoral components of the immune system. Conclusions We found no strong benefits of an increased investment in immunocompetence in a parasite-rich environment. Any deviation from the growth trajectory (due to changes in allocation induced by methionine) is largely detrimental for survival. Hence, while costs are apparent identifying the benefits of investment in immunocompetence during ontogeny is challenging."
https://openalex.org/W1981129250,"The mannitol transporter from Escherichia coli, EII(mtl), belongs to a class of membrane proteins coupling the transport of substrates with their chemical modification. EII(mtl) is functional as a homodimer, and it harbors one high affinity mannitol-binding site in the membrane-embedded C domain (IIC(mtl)). To localize this binding site, 19 single Trp-containing mutants of EII(mtl) were biosynthetically labeled with 5-fluorotryptophan (5-FTrp) and mixed with azi-mannitol, a substrate analog acting as a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) acceptor. Typically, for mutants showing FRET, only one 5-FTrp was involved, whereas the 5-FTrp from the other monomer was too distant. This proves that the mannitol-binding site is asymmetrically positioned in dimeric IIC(mtl). Combined with the available two-dimensional projection maps of IIC(mtl), it is concluded that a second resting binding site is present in this transporter. Active transport of mannitol only takes place when EII(mtl) becomes phosphorylated at Cys(384) in the cytoplasmic B domain. Stably phosphorylated EII(mtl) mutants were constructed, and FRET experiments showed that the position of mannitol in IIC(mtl) remains the same. We conclude that during the transport cycle, the phosphorylated B domain has to move to the mannitol-binding site, located in the middle of the membrane, to phosphorylate mannitol."

In this report, we provide mechanistic insight into the inhibitory complex formation of the lipid mediator sphingosylphosphorylcholine with calmodulin, the most central and ubiquitous regulator protein in calcium signaling. We applied crystallographic, thermodynamic, kinetic, and spectroscopic approaches using purified bovine calmodulin and bovine cerebral microsomal fraction to arrive at our conclusions. Here we present 1) a 1.6-Å resolution crystal structure of their complex, in which the sphingolipid occupies the conventional hydrophobic binding site on calmodulin; 2) a peculiar stoichiometry-dependent binding process: at low or high protein-to-lipid ratio calmodulin binds lipid micelles or a few lipid molecules in a compact globular conformation, respectively, and 3) evidence that the sphingolipid displaces calmodulin from its targets on cerebral microsomes. We have ascertained the specificity of the interaction using structurally related lipids as controls. Our observations reveal the structural basis of selective calmodulin inhibition by the sphingolipid. On the basis of the crystallographic and biophysical characterization of the calmodulin–sphingosylphosphorylcholine interaction, we propose a novel lipid-protein binding model, which might be applicable to other interactions as well.—Kovacs, E., Harmat, V., Tóth, J., Vértessy, B.

https://openalex.org/W2128193090,"An increase in chromosome number, or polyploidization, is associated with a variety of biological changes including breeding of cereal crops and flowers, terminal differentiation of specialized cells such as megakaryocytes, cellular stress and oncogenic transformation. Yet it remains unclear how cells tolerate the major changes in gene expression, chromatin organization and chromosome segregation that invariably accompany polyploidization. We show here that cancer cells can initiate increases in chromosome number by inhibiting cell division through activation of glycoprotein1b alpha (GpIbα), a component of the c-Myc signaling pathway. We are able to recapitulate cytokinesis failure in primary cells by overexpression of GpIbα in a p53-deficient background. GpIbα was found to localize to the cleavage furrow by microscopy analysis and, when overexpressed, to interfere with assembly of the cellular cortical contraction apparatus and normal division. These results indicate that cytokinesis failure and tetraploidy in cancer cells are directly linked to cellular hyperproliferation via c-Myc induced overexpression of GpIbα."
