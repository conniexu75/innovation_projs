https://openalex.org/W2004743282,"Deposits from mountain glaciers provide an important record of Quaternary climatic fluctuations but have proved difficult to date directly. A chronology has been obtained for glacial deposits at Bloody Canyon, California, by measurement of the accumulation of chlorine-36 produced by cosmic rays in boulders exposed on moraine crests. The accumulation of chlorine-36 indicates that episodes of glaciation occurred at about 21, 24, 65, 115, 145, and 200 ka (thousand years ago). Although the timing of the glaciations correlates well with peaks of global ice volume inferred from the marine oxygen isotope record, the relative magnitudes differ markedly. The lengths of the moraines dating from 115 ka and 65 ka show that the early glacial episodes were more extensive than those during the later Wisconsin and indicate that the transition from interglacial to full glacial conditions was rapid."

This extraordinary transformation involves the formation of six (r-bonds under the influence of three elementary reagents-potassium hydroxide, anmnonia, and acetic acid. The facility of the process adds credibility to the previous speculation that a similar process is an important step in the biosynthesis of the Daphniphyllum alkaloids."

It seems likely that the two lobes once were separate and that they collided to produce the current ""contact-binary"" configuration."

Found only at temperatures near absolute zero and in extremely strong magnetic fields, this liquid can flow without friction. The excited states of this liquid consist of peculiar particle-like objects that carry an exact fraction of an electron charge. Called quasiparticles, these excitations can themselves condense into new liquid states. Each such liquid is characterized by a fractional quantum number that is directly observable in a simple electrical measurement. This article attempts to convey the qualitative essence of this still unfolding phenomenon, known as the fractional quantum Hall effect."

This species, formed in a hydrogen plasma, has a half-life of 2.3 x 10(-8) seconds before it spontaneously dissociates to produce H(-) ions."
