Raft lipids are believed to exist in a state similar to the liquid-ordered phase. It has been proposed that proteins with a high affinity for an ordered lipid environment will preferentially partition into rafts (Melkonian, K. A., Ostermeyer, A. G., Chen, J. Z., Roth, M. G., and Brown, D. A. (1999)J. Biol. Chem. 274, 3910–3917). We investigated the possibility that lipid-lipid interactions between lipid-modified proteins and raft lipids mediate targeting of proteins to these domains. G protein monomers or trimers were reconstituted in liposomes, engineered to mimic raft domains. Assay for partitioning of G proteins into rafts was based on Triton X-100 insolubility. Myristoylation and palmitoylation of Gαi were necessary and sufficient for association with liposomes and partitioning into rafts. Strikingly, the amount of fatty-acylated Gαi in rafts was significantly reduced when myristoylated Gαi was thioacylated withcis-unsaturated fatty acids instead of saturated fatty acids such as palmitate. Prenylated βγ subunits were excluded from rafts, whether reconstituted alone or with fatty-acylated α subunits. These results suggest that the structural difference between lipids that modify proteins is one basis for the selectivity of protein targeting to rafts.

Nicolson G.L. Science. 1972; 175: 720-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (6046) Google Scholar). A large body of evidence from studies using cell biological and biophysical approaches suggests that there is selective confinement of lipids and proteins in discrete regions of the membrane (2.Brown R.E. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Anderson R.G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar, 4.Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8052) Google Scholar). These domains, named lipid rafts, are rich in sphingolipids and cholesterol, and appear to be a ubiquitous feature of mammalian cells. Lipid rafts are likely to contribute to the structure and function of caveolae, plasma membrane invaginations that are implicated in a variety of cellular processes, including signal transduction, endocytosis, transcytosis, and cholesterol trafficking. It has been proposed that the spatial concentration of specific sets of proteins increases the efficiency and specificity of signal transduction by facilitating interactions between proteins and by preventing inappropriate cross-talk between pathways. Raft lipids have been proposed to exist in a separate phase from the rest of the bilayer, in a state similar to the liquid-ordered (lo)1 phase described in model membrane (5.Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2546) Google Scholar, 6.Schroeder R. London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Acyl chains of lipids in the lo phase are tightly packed and highly ordered and extended, similar to those in the gel phase. Thus, lipid structural features (such as saturated acyl chains) that enhance formation of the gel phase can also enhance formation of the lo phase when these lipids are mixed with cholesterol. The presence of unusually long saturated acyl chains on sphingolipids promotes phase separation and formation of the lo phase in mixtures of phospholipids, sphingolipids, and cholesterol at concentrations similar to those in the plasma membrane at 37 °C (7.Ahmed S.N. Brown D.A. London E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10944-10953Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar), and is likely to do so in biological membranes as well. Cholesterol- and sphingolipid-rich detergent-resistant membrane (DRMs) can be isolated from mammalian cells (8.Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar). Because there are good correlations between onset of formation of an ordered phase and acquisition of detergent insolubility in model membranes (7.Ahmed S.N. Brown D.A. London E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10944-10953Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 9.Schroeder R.J. Ahmed S.N. Zhu Y. London E. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1150-1157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), and because DRMs isolated from cells are present in the lophase (10.Ge M. Field K.A. Aneja R. Holowka D. Baird B. Freed J. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 925-933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), DRMs are thought to be derived from rafts in living cells. In contrast, cell membranes that are in the conventional disordered phase are fully solubilized by non-ionic detergents. Based on the structural model of rafts described above, it has been postulated that proteins with a high affinity for an ordered lipid environment are selectively recruited to rafts (6.Schroeder R. London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). These might be expected to include proteins modified with saturated fatty acyl chains, which could partition favorably into lo phase domains. Indeed, the best characterized DRM targeting signals on proteins are structures that include dual saturated acyl chains. These are glycosylphosphatidylinositol membrane anchors (11.Arreaza G.

Biol. 1994; 14: 5384-5391Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) (which contain predominantly saturated fatty acids; Ref. 13.McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar), modification with tandem amide-linked myristate and thioester-linked palmitate (14.Milligan G. Parenti M. Magee A. Trends Biochem.

Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), and modification with tandem thioester-linked palmitate chains (16.Arni S. Keilbaugh S.A. Ostermeyer A.G. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28478-28485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Palmitoylation is also required for DRM association of the integral membrane proteins LAT (17.Zhang W. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar) and influenza hemagglutinin (18.Melkonian K.A. Ostermeyer A.G. Chen J.Z. Roth M.G. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3910-3917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The contribution of the lipid modification to raft recruitment is not simply the addition of a hydrophobic moiety, as prenylated proteins are not enriched in DRMs (18.Melkonian K.A. Ostermeyer A.G. Chen J.Z. Roth M.G. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3910-3917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Sphingolipid- and cholesterol-rich liposomes (SCRL), constructed to mimic the lipid composition of DRMs isolated from cells (8.Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar), contain lo phase domains (7.Ahmed S.N. Brown D.A. London E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10944-10953Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar) and yield DRMs after detergent extraction (6.Schroeder R. London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). SCRL are useful for studying association of purified proteins with DRMs in a defined model system. Purified glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins incorporated into SCRL are present in DRMs derived from the liposomes (6.Schroeder R. London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 9.Schroeder R.J. Ahmed S.N. Zhu Y. London E. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1150-1157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), supporting the model that acyl-chain interactions are important in targeting. The heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) are fatty-acylated and prenylated, and thus are a useful model for examining the role of lipid modifications in targeting proteins to rafts. All G protein α subunits are fatty-acylated with amide-linked myristate, thioester-linked palmitate, or both (19.Wedegaertner P.B. Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 503-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). G protein γ subunits are modified by farnesyl or geranylgeranyl groups (19.Wedegaertner P.B. Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 503-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, an unambiguous role for N-myristoylation and prenylation in mediating membrane association of G protein subunits has been established. Gαi family members lackingN-myristate or Gγ subunits lacking prenylation are soluble (19.Wedegaertner P.B. Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 503-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Palmitoylation of G protein α subunits does not appear to be a major determinant of membrane avidity, at least in the presence of Gβγ subunits (20.Morales J. Fishburn S. Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 21.Fishburn C.S. Herzmark P. Morales J. Bourne H.R. J. Biol.

A. 1999; 96: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), but may play a role in targeting Gα specifically to the plasma membrane (20.Morales J. Fishburn S. Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 21.Fishburn C.S. Herzmark P. Morales J. Bourne H.R. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14806-14817Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 24.Dunphy J.D. Greentree W.K. Manahan C.L. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7154-7159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and potentially in targeting proteins to subdomains (25.Song K.S. Sargiacomo M. Galbiati F. Parenti M. Lisanti M.P. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1997; 43: 293-303PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Mumby S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Palmitoylation-defective mutants of Gαz, Gαo, and Gpa1p, a G protein α subunit in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, are mislocalized to intracellular membranes (20.Morales J. Fishburn S. Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 22.Huang C. Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. Mumby S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 23.Song J. Dohlman H.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14806-14817Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, it is not possible to discern whether mislocalization is attributable to the lack of palmitate or mutation of the palmitoylated cysteine residue. Biochemical and morphological evidence points to the organization of G protein pathways in subdomains of the plasma membrane. All of the components of the hormone-sensitive adenylyl cyclase system appear to be enriched in preparations of low density plasma membrane fragments (27.Huang C. Hepler J.R. Chen L.T. Gilman A.G. Andersone R.G.W. Mumby S.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2365-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Gαi and Gβ subunits have a punctate appearance in plasma membrane fragments when detected by immunofluorescence. This punctate distribution of Gαi is corroborated by its clustered appearance when decorated with gold particles in electron micrographs of plasma membrane (22.Huang C. Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. Mumby S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Gα subunits are enriched in DRM isolated from cells, but there is disagreement as to the extent of enrichment of Gβγ subunits in these preparations (18.Melkonian K.A. Ostermeyer A.G. Chen J.Z. Roth M.G. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3910-3917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 28.Chang W. Ying Y. Rothberg K. Hooper N. Turner A. Gambliel H. DeGunzburg J. Mumby S. Gilman A. Anderson R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 29.Rehm A. Pleogh H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 305-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Two nonexclusive mechanisms have been proposed for the targeting of Gα subunits to lipid rafts; fatty acylation (25.Song K.S. Sargiacomo M. Galbiati F. Parenti M. Lisanti M.P. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1997; 43: 293-303PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Galbiati F. Volonte D. Meani D. Milligan G. Lublin D.M. Lisanti M.P. Parenti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5843-5850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), or interactions with caveolin, a coat protein of caveolae that may function as a scaffolding molecule (31.Li S. Couet J. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29182-29190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 32.Couet J. Li S. Okamoto T. Ikezu T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6525-6533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). Most Gαi family members contain the DRM-targeting signal, Met-Gly-Cys, that directsN-myristoylation at Gly-2 and palmitoylation at Cys-3 (19.Wedegaertner P.B. Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 503-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). As with similarly modified nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, mutation of either site in Gαi1 reduces association with DRM isolated from transfected cells (25.Song K.S. Sargiacomo M. Galbiati F. Parenti M. Lisanti M.P. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1997; 43: 293-303PubMed Google Scholar). It is assumed that the failure of the mutant proteins to cofractionate with DRM is due to the loss of the lipid modification. However, this has not been directly demonstrated. A direct protein-protein interaction between Gαi subunits and caveolin has also been proposed as a mechanism for targeting proteins to lipid rafts (33.Li S. Okamoto T. Chun M. Sargiacomo M. Casanova J. Hansen S. Nishimoto I. Lisanti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15693-15701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Caveolin is reported to bind to an amino acid motif in Gαi2, fXfXXXf (where f represents aromatic amino acids Trp, Phe, or Tyr) (32.Couet J. Li S. Okamoto T. Ikezu T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6525-6533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar), and also to interact either directly or indirectly with the amino terminus of Gαi1 (30.Galbiati F. Volonte D. Meani D. Milligan G. Lublin D.M. Lisanti M.P. Parenti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5843-5850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The direct binding interaction between purified Gαi and caveolin was not reproduced with purified components (27.Huang C. Hepler J.R. Chen L.T. Gilman A.G. Andersone R.G.W. Mumby S.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2365-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), raising questions about the nature of the interaction of caveolin with the fXfXXXf motif. Co-immunoprecipitation of Gαi2 with caveolin from transfected cells requires only the NH2-terminal domain of Gαi2, is independent of the fXfXXXf motif, and is dependent upon an intact palmitoylation site (30.Galbiati F. Volonte D. Meani D. Milligan G. Lublin D.M. Lisanti M.P. Parenti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5843-5850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The studies published to date do not discriminate whether targeting of proteins to rafts by the Met-Gly-Cys motif is mediated by interactions of the protein's fatty acyl chains with membrane lipids, with other proteins present in domains, or through a mechanism that is dependent upon the primary amino acid sequence of the protein rather than the lipid modification. In this paper, we address the question of whether interactions between the lipid modifications present on G proteins and raft lipids account for their distribution in rafts in cells. The affinity of differentially lipid-modified G proteins for rafts was examined by reconstituting purified subunits into liposomes engineered to mimic rafts. Membrane partitioning was evaluated using susceptibility of the protein to Triton X-100 extraction. We present evidence that the selectivity of protein targeting to rafts relies on the lipid structure that modifies the protein. Phosphatidylcholine (liver), phosphatidylethanolamine (liver), cerebrosides (brain), sphingomyelin (brain), cholesterol (wool grease), and (16:0–18:0 (6–7Dibr)-phosphatidylcholine were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. [2-palmitoyl-9,10-3H]Phosphatidylcholine and [3H]palmitate were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. The myristoyl-CoA, palmitoyl-CoA, palmitoleoyl-CoA, stearoyl-CoA, and linoleoyl-CoA lipid derivatives were purchased from Sigma. The detergent Triton X-100 was purchased as an aqueous solution (10%) from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, CHAPS from Calbiochem, and polyoxyethylene 10-lauryl ether from Sigma. The nucleotides guanosine 5′-diphosphate and guanosine 5′-triphosphate were obtained from Sigma. GTPγS was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Recombinant nonlipidated Gαi1(Gαi) was expressed and purified from Escherichia coli (34.Linder M.E. Ewald D.A. Miller R.J. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8243-8251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain myristoylated Gαi1(MGαi), the S. cerevisiae N-myristoyltransferase was expressed together with Gαi in bacteria and MGαipurified as described (35.Mumby S.M. Linder M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 237: 254-268Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Activity of the different purified Gαi preparations was evaluated by quantification of bound GTPγS (34.Linder M.E. Ewald D.A. Miller R.J. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8243-8251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant Gβ1 and hexahistidine-tagged Gγ2 subunits (Gβγ) were produced in Sf9 cells and purified by sequential chromatography with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) and Mono Q (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (36.Kozasa T. Gilman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1734-1741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). To evaluate the purity of the preparation, the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with silver nitrate. The procedure was adapted from the protocol of Duncan and Gilman (37.Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23594-23600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant MGαi (4 μm) was incubated in Buffer A (20 mm NaHepes (pH 8.0), 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA) containing 7.5 mm CHAPS and 80 μmmyristoyl-CoA (C14:0), palmitoyl-CoA (C16:0), palmitoleoyl-CoA (C16:1), stearoyl-CoA (C18:0) or linoleoyl-CoA (C18:2). For Gαimonomer, MGαi was preincubated for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence of GDP (10 μm) and NaF (10 mm), or GTPγS (10 μm). For experiments with trimeric G proteins, heterotrimer was formed by incubatingMGαi (4 μm) with Gβγ (4 μm) in the presence of GDP (10 μm) for 30 min at 30 °C. The acylation reaction was started with the additions of a mix of the other reagents. The solution was then further incubated for 90 min. All concentrations shown are the final concentrations in the autoacylation reaction. To monitor the efficiency of palmitoylation, GTPγS-boundMGαi (1 μm) was incubated with [3H]palmitoyl-CoA (20 μm, 3300 dpm/pmol) in Buffer A containing 7.5 mm CHAPS. [3H]Palmitoyl-CoA was prepared as detailed by Dunphyet al. (24.Dunphy J.D. Greentree W.K. Manahan C.L. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7154-7159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the reaction (10 μl) were removed at different time points and mixed with 30 μl of a solution containing 1% SDS and 2 mg/ml aldolase. Samples were then precipitated at room temperature by the addition of 500 μl of 15% trichloroacetic acid, 2% SDS. Following a 45-min incubation, the samples were filtered on BA85 nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell) using a 10-place filter manifold (Hoefer). Each tube was rinsed twice with 4 ml of 6% trichloroacetic acid, 2% SDS. The filters were washed twice with 2 × 2 ml of 6% trichloroacetic acid, 2% SDS, followed by 2 × 2 ml of 6% trichloroacetic acid. The filters were dried, placed in 4 ml of scintillation fluid, and counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. To monitor the acylation ofMGαi when using acyl-CoAs other than palmitoyl-CoA, an indirect method of labeling was used.MGαi (1 μm) was acylated with 20 μm acyl-CoA (C14:0, C16:0, C16:1, C18:0, C18:2) as described above. The solution was then spiked with [3H]palmitoyl-CoA (20 μm, 6000 dpm/pmol) and the incubation continued for 90 min. The reaction was stopped and quantitated as above. Sequential acylation reactions allowed us to estimate the level of acylation in the first reaction by measuring the inhibition of incorporation of radioactive palmitate. Lipids (6 mg) for making phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol (PC:Chol, 7:1 mol:mol) liposomes or phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, sphingomyelin, cerebrosides, and cholesterol (SCRL, 1:1:1:1:2) (6.Schroeder R. London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar) were mixed in a glass screw cap vial, dried under nitrogen gas, lyophilized for 1 h, and stored under argon gas at −20 °C. For the sucrose gradient sedimentation assay, the liposomes were brominated (bromoPC:Chol, bromoSCRL) in order to create a heavier liposome, by replacing half of the phosphatidylcholine with brominated phosphatidylcholine (16:0–18:0(6–7Dibr)-PC). To make [3H]phosphatidylcholine labeled PC:Chol or SCRL, 16 nCi/mg lipids of [2-palmitoyl-9,10-3H]phosphatidylcholine was incorporated in the lipid mixture prior to lyophilization. To prepare liposomes, a vial of dried lipids was first brought to room temperature and lyophilized for 30 min. The lipids were suspended in buffer B (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaHepes (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA) at 2 mg/ml, transferred to a Corning glass screw cap tube, and the tube filled with argon gas. All the buffers used for liposome experiments were bubbled with nitrogen gas for a few minutes to reduce solubilized oxygen. The lipid suspension was sonicated in a bath ultrasonicator (Laboratory Supplies, Inc.) until the solution became partially clear (between 5 and 20 min). The suspension was then frozen and thawed three times by alternative immersion of the tube in baths of methanol/dry ice and water at 30 °C. The liposomes were recovered in the pellet by ultracentrifugation for 30 min at 200,000 × g and suspended in buffer B at 20 mg/ml. Liposomes were discarded after 36 h. Freshly acylated G proteins (40 pmol of M/PGαi orM/PGαiβγ), or mock-acylated Gαi, MGαi, Gβγ, andMGαiβγ were mixed with CHAPS (375 nmol) in a total volume of 12 μl. The protein solution was then mixed with 500 μg of PC:Chol or SCRL, and incubated for 45 min at room temperature. Under those conditions, the molar ratio of CHAPS:phospholipids is 0.72 and only partial solubilization of the liposomes occurs (38.Cladera J. Rigaud J.-L. Villaverde J. Dunach M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 798-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The mixture was then diluted stepwise at room temperature with buffer B containing either 10 μm GDP in the presence or the absence of 10 mm NaF or 10 μm GTPγS, until the CHAPS concentration reached 2 mm. Equal volumes of buffer were added to the partially solubilized liposomes every 2 min and the solution gently vortexed. To recover the liposomes, the sample was fractionated by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and the pellet suspended in nucleotide-supplemented buffer B at 2.2 mg of lipids/ml. A sample of the dilution prior to the fractionation, input (I), and the resulting supernatant (S) and suspended pellet (P) were kept to evaluate the efficiency of G protein incorporation into the liposomes. Quantification of G proteins in the fractions was determined either by GTPγS binding for Gαi-containing samples and/or by image analysis (NIH Image) of the gels resulting from protein resolution by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. Recoveries of the protein in the supernatant (S) and the suspended pellet (P) following the fractionation averaged more than 90% of the starting material (I), (S+P)/I. The reconstitution efficiencies of G protein was expressed as the percentage of protein associated with the liposome pellet over the total amount of protein recovered, P/(S+P). Sucrose gradients were prepared by freezing (−80 °C) a 15% sucrose solution in buffer B supplemented with 10 μm amounts of the appropriate nucleotide in ultracentrifugation tubes (Beckman), and thereafter allowing the solution to slowly thaw at room temperature. This method gives rise to a linear gradient from ∼5% to 20% sucrose, as determined by the sucrose refractive index measured in the fractions recovered. A sample of reconstituted protein in bromoPC:Chol andbromoSCRL or protein alone in buffer B containing 7.5 mm CHAPS was applied to the top of the gradient and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 8 h at 4 °C. Fractions were collected and analyzed for total lipid and protein content. Lipids were isolated by chloroform extraction (1:1). Following vigorous mixing, the solution was centrifuged in a tabletop centrifuge and the organic phase was recovered and evaporated under nitrogen gas to ∼10 μl. The concentrated lipid extracts were spotted side by side on a HPTLC plate (Whatman) and allowed to dry. Lipids were revealed by charring (39.Macala L.J., Yu, R.K. Ando S. J. Lipid Res. 1983; 24: 1243-1250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were detected by immunoblot and visualized by chemiluminescence (Pierce). Reconstituted G proteins were chilled on ice for 10 min. Cold Triton X-100 was added to the suspension at a final concentration of 1% and the preparation incubated on ice for 25 min. The solution was then fractionated by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 30 min. An equivalent sample from the resulting supernatant and the suspended detergent-resistant fraction were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were detected by Coomassie Blue staining of the gel. The gel was scanned and the intensity of the bands evaluated by densitometry using NIH Image. The amount of protein in the detergent-resistant fraction was expressed as a percentage of the protein recovered following the fractionation, P/(P+S). MGαi was palmitoylatedin vitro in the presence of GDP and NaF and reconstituted in SCRL as described above. To compare the effect of the activation state of Gαi on its membrane partitioning, NaF and MgCl2 were removed from half of the preparation to return the protein to a GDP-bound inactive state. Accordingly, the solution of reconstituted liposomes was divided, and fractionated by ultracentrifugation. The resulting pellets were washed once in a large volume of buffer B containing 5 μm GDP and 10 mm NaF or"

This compound has no apparent ability to activate the transcriptional activity of PPARγ; however, BADGE can antagonize the ability of agonist ligands such as rosiglitazone to activate the transcriptional and adipogenic action of this receptor. BADGE also specifically blocks the ability of natural adipogenic cell lines such as 3T3-L1 and 3T3-F442A cells to undergo hormone-mediated cell differentiation.

PPARγ is a major coordinator of adipocyte gene expression and differentiation (1.Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1977) Google Scholar). The expression of this receptor occurs early during the differentiation of preadipocytes, and it is expressed in a highly adipose-selective manner. PPARγ has been considered an orphan member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, because no high affinity endogenous ligand has been identified for this receptor. However, a number of synthetic compounds have been shown to bind and activate PPARγ including a relatively new class of antidiabetic drugs, the thiazolidinediones (2.Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12953-12956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3434) Google Scholar). Thiazolidinediones (TZD) can ameliorate glucose metabolism and improve whole body insulin sensitivity in many animal models of obesity and diabetes. One TZD, troglitazone (RezulinTM), is currently used in the treatment of Type II diabetes in humans, and a second, rosiglitazone (AvandiaTM), was recently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration. In addition to synthetic ligands, a number of natural ligands have been described for PPARγ that include primarily fatty acids and their metabolites (3.Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2701) Google Scholar, 4.Kliewer S.A. Lenhard J.M. Willson T.M. Patel I. Morris D.C. Lehmann J.M.

These ligands, however, have relatively low affinities withK d ≈ 2–50 μm, and hence it is possible that, analogous to other nuclear hormone receptors, a higher affinity ligand for PPARγ might exist. The evidence supporting a key role for PPARγ in adipogenesis is strong, but it is entirely based on “gain of function” experiments. For example, it has been shown that the ectopic expression and activation of PPARγ in undetermined fibroblasts are sufficient to induce an adipogenic response that includes morphological changes, lipid accumulation, and expression of most of the genes characteristic of this cell type (6.Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3075) Google Scholar). However, until now no experiments have addressed whether PPARγ function is required for adipocyte differentiation. During a screen for endogenous ligands of PPARγ we purified and characterized a compound that exhibited PPARγ binding activity. High pressure liquid and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS and GC/MS, respectively)-based analyses identified this active component as bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE), a synthetic substance used in the production of polycarbonate and industrial plastics. Competition radioligand binding studies showed this compound to be a ligand for PPARγ with micromolar affinity. Functional studies indicate that BADGE is a pure antagonist for this receptor. 3T3-L1 and 3T3-F442A preadipocytes were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% serum under non-differentiating and differentiating conditions as described previously (7.Cook K.S. Hunt C.R. Spiegelman B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 514-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (Fluka, Milwaukee, WI) or vehicle (EtOH) was added 24 h prior to induction of differentiation. Medium was replenished with ligands every 2 days. Adipogenesis was determined by staining of lipids with Oil Red O and by the expression of adipocyte-specific RNA markers (8.Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). RNA was isolated using TrizolTM reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). 3T3-L1 and 3T3-F442A cells were lysed in a hypotonic solution containing 1 mmNaHCO3, 2 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm MgCl2. Nuclei were isolated by centrifugation through a 30% sucrose cushion. The nuclear fractions were pooled, resuspended in water, and acidified to a pH value of 3.5 for solid phase extraction. Sep-Pak C18 solid phase extraction cartridges (Waters, Milford, MA) were activated by passing methanol (20 ml) and then water (20 ml) through the stationary phase. Following sample loading, the cartridges were washed with water (20 ml) and then hexane (10 ml), methyl formate (10 ml), and methanol (10 ml) were used to elute the cartridge (9.Serhan C.N. Sheppard K.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 772-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The extracted fractions were taken to dryness under a gentle stream of nitrogen for radioligand binding analysis. The methyl formate fraction, which carried PPARγ binding activity, was further purified by HPLC for GC/MS and LC/MS/MS analyses. LC/MS/MS data were acquired with an LCQ (Finnigan, San Jose, CA) quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer system equipped with an electrospray atmospheric pressure ionization probe. Samples were suspended in mobile phase for injection into the HPLC component, which consisted of a SpectraSYSTEM P4000 (Thermo Separation Products, San Jose, CA) quaternary gradient pump, a Prodigy octadecylsilane-3 (250 × 2 mm, 5 μm) column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) or a LUNA C18–2 (150 × 2 mm, 5 μm) column, and a rapid spectra-scanning SpectraSYSTEM UV2000 (Thermo Separation Products, San Jose, CA) UV-visible absorbance detector. The column was eluted at 0.2 ml/min either isocratically only with methanol/water/acetic acid (69.99:30:0.01, v/v/v) or isocratically for 20 min followed by a linear gradient to 99.99:0.01 methanol/acetic acid (v/v) over 20 min. MS data were collected in the positive ion mode, with the spray voltage set to 5 kV and the capillary to −11 V and 250 °C. The scan cycle consisted of a full scan spectrum (MS) acquired with 3 microscans and a 200-ms maximum ion time followed by a product ion mass spectrum (MS/MS) of the most intense full scan MS ion, using a collision energy setting of 30 and with 5 microscans. GC/MS data were acquired with an HP 5890 gas chromatographer (Hewlett Packard, Wilmington, DE) equipped with a DB-1 column (0.25 mm × 30 m, 0.25 μm) (J&W Scientific, Folsum, CA) and an HP 5972 mass spectrometer. GC parameters were as follows: injector, 5 μL, splitless, 300 °C; column temperature, initial 100 °C, ramp 6 °C/min, final 280 °C at 40 min. GC/MS spectra were searched utilizing the Wiley Registry of Mass Spectral Data (Palisade Corporation, Newfield, NY). Ligand binding assays were performed as described previously (4.Kliewer S.A. Lenhard J.M. Willson T.M. Patel I. Morris D.C. Lehmann J.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 813-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar) with some modification. Briefly, His-human PPARγ ligand-binding domain protein (amino acids 176–477) was expressed in BL21(DE3)plysS bacteria and partially purified under non-denaturing conditions using Ni-NTA-agarose beads (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Competition binding assays were performed with [3H]rosiglitazone (specific activity 50 Ci/mmol, American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) and 5 μl of beads, with and without unlabeled competitor in a ligand binding buffer containing 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 50 mm KCl, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. After incubation at 4 °C for 2 h, beads were washed with buffer three times to remove unbound ligand. Radioactivity was quantitated by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. NIH-3T3 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) grown in 24-well cell culture plates were transfected with pSV-Sport plasmids (500 ng each) encoding PPARγ, RXRα, DR-1 luciferase, and β-galactosidase utilizing SuperfectTM transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). A fusion protein containing the yeast GAL4 DNA-binding domain linked to the ligand-binding domains of PPARγ, PPARα, PPARδ, and RXRα was also used in transfection experiments with a reporter construct (thymidine kinase-luciferase) containing four copies of a GAL4 upstream activating sequence. Cells were also transfected with a pCMX plasmid encoding full-length human glucocorticoid receptor (GR) α and the aP2 promoter linked to luciferase. Cells were exposed to ligands for 24 h, lysed, and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity using a 96-well luminometer and a spectrophotometer. Transfections were performed in triplicate. During the characterization of PPARγ ligands derived from cultured adipocytes, we identified BADGE (CAS 1675–54-3), a synthetic compound with industrial applications, namely as a component of epoxy resins (10.Ben-Jonathan N. Steinmetz R. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 9: 124-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). BADGE was isolated from nuclear extracts of both 3T3-L1 and 3T3-F442A preadipocytes that were given a differentiation-inducing stimulus. Purification of the compound was first achieved via solid phase extraction of nuclear extracts, followed by reverse phase HPLC. We then performed LC/MS/MS and GC/MS separation of fractions that exhibited activity in a radioligand binding assay, utilizing the bacterially expressed ligand-binding domain of PPARγ. The identification of BADGE was accomplished using both LC/MS/MS (data not shown) and GC/MS-based analyses. Fig.1 A shows the GC/MS profile comparing an active PPARγ binding fraction purified by HPLC from 3T3-L1 cells (upper panel) with that of BADGE (lower panel). Clearly, the GC/MS analysis of the activity purified from the nuclear extract showed a similar MS profile to that of BADGE, with each denoting a base peak of 340, which is the molecular weight of BADGE. It remains to be determined how BADGE accumulated in the differentiating cells; a likely possibility is that it leached from the plastic culture dishes and accumulated in the lipids of the differentiating cells. BADGE is a ligand for PPARγ, as can be seen in a radioligand displacement assay utilizing a commercially available preparation (Fig.2 A). 50% displacement of rosiglitazone was achieved at approximately 100 μm BADGE. Further displacement could not be achieved, probably because of the fact that this represents the solubility limit of this compound in aqueous solution. Nevertheless, the binding of BADGE was selective in that structurally related compounds such as the xenoestrogens bisphenol A and diethylstilbestrol could not displace rosiglitazone (Fig.2 B). We next examined the effect of BADGE on the transcriptional activity of PPARγ utilizing a transcription reporter assay. NIH-3T3 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding full-length PPARγ, RXRα, β-galactosidase, and a DR-1 luciferase reporter. BADGE treatment failed to activate the PPARγ/RXRα heterodimer in concentrations as high as 100 μm, the highest concentration that was fully soluble (Fig. 3 A). Because BADGE is a ligand for PPARγ, we examined the possibility that this compound could serve as a receptor antagonist. NIH-3T3 cells were transfected with PPARγ/RXRα as above and then treated with 100 nm rosiglitazone in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of BADGE. In this instance, BADGE showed a dose-dependent attenuation of rosiglitazone-induced transactivation (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that BADGE is an antagonist for this receptor. To determine whether such BADGE inhibition could be working on a site outside the ligand-binding domain, NIH-3T3 cells were transfected with a fusion protein between the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and the ligand-binding domain of PPARγ. As can be seen in Fig. 3 C, an antagonistic effect of BADGE on rosiglitazone-stimulated activation was also observed with this construct, suggesting that the ligand-binding domain is the site of BADGE action. Lastly, we wished to determine whether the inhibition of PPARγ by BADGE was selective for this receptor. NIH-3T3 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and the ligand-binding domain of PPARα, PPARδ, or RXRα or a plasmid encoding the full-length human glucocorticoid receptor and treated with their respective ligands in the presence or absence of BADGE. As shown in Fig. 3, C-E, BADGE showed selectivity among PPAR family members. The inhibition of PPARγ by BADGE in this experiment was ≈ 70%, whereas PPARδ was inhibited by ≈ 23% and PPARα was not inhibited. Furthermore, BADGE was ineffective in attenuating GR-mediated transcriptional activation (Fig. 3 G); however, an inhibitory effect of BADGE (≈ 30%) on ligand-induced activation of RXRα was observed (Fig. 3 F). Utilizing BADGE as an antagonist, we next addressed the key biological question of whether PPARγ function is required for adipocyte differentiation. First, we examined the effect of BADGE on PPARγ ligand-induced differentiation, because this type of differentiation is clearly driven by PPARγ. 3T3-F442A cells were induced to differentiate for 4 days with 25 nmrosiglitazone in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of BADGE. The cells were then stained with Oil Red O, which is a marker for neutral lipids. As shown in Fig.4 A, treatment with BADGE resulted in reduced lipid accumulation as observed by Oil Red O. Because BADGE acts as an antagonist for PPARγ, we next investigated whether BADGE could affect cell differentiation where endogenous mediators are promoting adipogenesis; this experiment would address whether PPARγ function is required for hormone-mediated adipose cell differentiation. We utilized 3T3-L1 cells, a well characterized model of adipogenesis. For this experiment, cells were pretreated with different concentrations of BADGE or vehicle and then induced to differentiate with medium containing dexamethasone, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and insulin (Dex/IBMX/Ins). As was seen with TZD-induced differentiation, BADGE was able to significantly reduce the amount of lipids in Dex/IBMX/Ins-induced 3T3-L1 cells (Fig.4 B). The effect of BADGE was specific in that bisphenol A was ineffective in attenuating differentiation (data not shown). Of course, there is a concern that this inhibition could be due to a toxic effect of BADGE. This did not appear to be the case, because simultaneous treatment of the cells with a saturating dose of rosiglitazone completely reversed the inhibitory effect of a maximal concentration of BADGE (Fig. 4 B). The anti-adipogenic effect of BADGE was also evident on the expression of different adipocyte-specific RNA markers. There was a decrease in the expression of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, glucose transporter type 4, and adipsin with no significant alteration in the expression of adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (aP2) (Fig. 4 C). It is likely that the inability of BADGE to inhibit aP2 expression is caused by the difficulty in obtaining complete antagonism for PPARγ. Rosiglitazone administration with BADGE reversed most of the inhibitory effects. The effect of rosiglitazone on the BADGE inhibited expression of adipsin was not readily assessable because this mRNA is susceptible to down-regulation by TZDs. These results together indicate that PPARγ activity is required for most morphological and molecular events of adipocyte differentiation. This study characterizes a synthetic antagonist for PPARγ and demonstrates that loss of PPARγ function can inhibit adipocyte differentiation. This conclusion is based on our findings that BADGE is a ligand for PPARγ and that this compound can antagonize the ability of a TZD agonist ligand, rosiglitazone, to stimulate the transcriptional activity of PPARγ. Furthermore, whereas it was difficult to achieve complete blockage of this receptor because of the relative low affinity and solubility of BADGE, doses could be achieved that interfered with both TZD and hormonally induced adipocyte differentiation. These results are the first pharmacological data to show that PPARγ function is required for hormonally induced adipocyte differentiation, because evidence supporting a key role for PPARγ in adipogenesis has been based on gain of function experiments with this receptor. While these studies were being prepared for publication, another group (11.Oberfield J.L. Collins J.L. Holmes C.P. Goreham D.M. Cooper J.P. Cobb J.E. Lenhard J.M. Hull-Ryde E.A. Mohr C.P. Blanchard S.G. Parks D.J. Moore L.B. Lehmann J.M. Plunket K. Miller A.B. Milburn M.V. Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6102-6106Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) described a high affinity synthetic ligand for PPARγ (GW0072) that could block TZD-induced adipogenesis in C3H10T1/2 cells. However, this compound was found to be a partial agonist for PPARγ and thus did not facilitate experiments to determine whether PPARγ is required in hormone-mediated differentiation. In addition to regulating adipocyte differentiation, PPARγ is important in insulin signaling; agonists for PPARγ are useful in the treatment of patients with Type II diabetes. An antagonist for this receptor could be helpful in investigating the signal transduction pathways involved in PPARγ-mediated insulin sensitization, especially in different models of obesity and diabetes. It is also important to note that PPARγ is expressed in tissues other than fat, such as muscle, colon, and brain. The role of PPARγ in the development and differentiation of these tissues has not been clearly defined. Thus, it would be of interest to characterize what effect a PPARγ antagonist would have in non-adipose tissue and even in the whole animal. For instance, it would be interesting to investigate whether a PPARγ antagonist would be effective in alleviating diet-induced obesity and if so whether such blockage would lead to other deleterious effects such as a reduction in insulin sensitivity. Whereas BADGE itself may not be an appropriate molecule for these studies because of its low affinity, it is possible that higher affinity antagonists can be derived based on this structure. Another important finding of this study is the identification of BADGE itself as an antagonist of PPARγ. BADGE and its chemical precursor, bisphenol A, are used commercially in the manufacturing of polycarbonate plastics and have been found in a number of consumer products. For instance, BADGE has been found to migrate into foods from the plastic lining of cans (12.Summerfield W. Goodson A. Cooper I. Food Addit. Contam. 1998; 15: 818-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and in susceptors used in microwave cooking (13.Sharman M. Honeybone C.A. Jickells S.M. Castle L. Food Addit. Contam. 1995; 12: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). BADGE is also present in sealants used in dentistry (14.Olea N. Pulgar R. Perez P. Olea-Serrano F. Rivas A. Novillo-Fertrell A. Pedraza V. Soto A.M. Sonnenschein C. Environ. Health Perspect. 1996; 104: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). Because bisphenol A is a known xenoestrogen (15.Steinmetz R. Mitchner N. Grant A. Allen D. Bigsby R. Ben-Jonathan N. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2741-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) and endocrine disrupter, it will therefore be important to monitor the possible environmental implications (16.Limbird L.E. Taylor P. Cell. 1998; 93: 157-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) of BADGE exposure in light of its new function as a PPARγ antagonist.

https://openalex.org/W2033162659,"Cadmium-mediated toxicity of cultured proximal tubule (PT) cells is associated with increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis. We found that cadmium-dependent apoptosis (Hoechst 33342 and annexin V assays) decreased with prolonged CdCl(2) (10 microM) application (controls: 2.4 +/- 1.6%; 5 h: +5.1 +/- 2.3%, 20 h: +5.7 +/- 2.5%, 48 h: +3.3 +/- 1.0% and 72 h: +2.1 +/- 0.4% above controls), while cell proliferation was not affected. Reduction of apoptosis correlated with a time-dependent up-regulation of the drug efflux pump multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein (mdr1) in cadmium-treated cells ( approximately 4-fold after 72 h), as determined by immunoblotting with the monoclonal antibody C219 and measurement of intracellular accumulation of the fluorescent probe calcein +/- the mdr1 inhibitor PSC833 (0.5 microM). When mdr1 inhibitors (PSC833, cyclosporine A, verapamil) were transiently added to cells with mdr1 up-regulation by pretreatment for 72 h with cadmium, cadmium-induced apoptosis increased significantly and to a percentage similar to that obtained in cells with no mdr1 up-regulation (72-h cadmium: 5.2 +/- 0.9% versus 72-h cadmium + 1-h PSC833: 7.2 +/- 1.4%; p < or = 0.001). Cadmium-induced apoptosis and mdr1 up-regulation depended on ROS, since co-incubation with the ROS scavengers N-acetylcysteine (15 mM) or pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (0.1 mM) abolished both responses. Moreover, cadmium- and ROS-associated mdr1 up-regulation was linked to activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB; N-acetylcysteine, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, and the IkappaB-alpha kinase inhibitor Bay 11-7082 (20 microM) prevented both, mdr1 overexpression and degradation of the inhibitory NF-kappaB subunit, IkappaB-alpha, induced by cadmium. The data show that 1) cadmium-mediated apoptosis in PT cells is associated with ROS production, 2) ROS increase mdr1 expression by a process involving NF-kappaB activation, and 3) mdr1 overexpression protects PT cells against cadmium-mediated apoptosis. These data suggest that mdr1 up-regulation, at least in part, provides anti-apoptotic protection for PT cells against cadmium-mediated stress."
https://openalex.org/W2014226393,"In this study we have explored the interaction between CD44 (the hyaluronic acid (HA)-binding receptor) and Tiam1 (a guanine nucleotide exchange factor) in metastatic breast tumor cells (SP1 cell line). Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analyses indicate that both the CD44v3 isoform and the Tiam1 protein are expressed in SP1 cells and that these two proteins are physically associated as a complex in vivo. Using an Escherichia coli-derived calmodulin-binding peptide-tagged Tiam1 fragment (i.e. the NH2-terminal pleckstrin homology (PHn) domain and an adjacent protein interaction domain designated as PHn-CC-Ex, amino acids 393–738 of Tiam1) and an in vitrobinding assay, we have detected a specific binding interaction between the Tiam1 PHn-CC-Ex domain and CD44. Scatchard plot analysis indicates that there is a single high affinity CD44 binding site in the PHn-CC-Ex domain of Tiam1 with an apparent dissociation constant (K d) of 0.2 nm, which is comparable with CD44 binding (K d = ∼0.13 nm) to intact Tiam1. These findings suggest that the PHn-CC-Ex domain is the primary Tiam1-binding region for CD44. Most importantly, the binding of HA to CD44v3 of SP1 cells stimulates Tiam1-catalyzed Rac1 signaling and cytoskeleton-mediated tumor cell migration. Transfection of SP1 cells with Tiam1cDNA promotes Tiam1 association with CD44v3 and up-regulates Rac1 signaling as well as HA/CD44v3-mediated breast tumor cell migration. Co-transfection of SP1 cells with PHn-CC-Ex cDNA and Tiam1 cDNA effectively inhibits Tiam1 association with CD44 and efficiently blocks tumor behaviors. Taken together, we believe that the linkage between CD44v3 isoform and the PHn-CC-EX domain of Tiam1 is required for HA stimulated Rac1 signaling and cytoskeleton-mediated tumor cell migration during breast cancer progression. In this study we have explored the interaction between CD44 (the hyaluronic acid (HA)-binding receptor) and Tiam1 (a guanine nucleotide exchange factor) in metastatic breast tumor cells (SP1 cell line). Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analyses indicate that both the CD44v3 isoform and the Tiam1 protein are expressed in SP1 cells and that these two proteins are physically associated as a complex in vivo. Using an Escherichia coli-derived calmodulin-binding peptide-tagged Tiam1 fragment (i.e. the NH2-terminal pleckstrin homology (PHn) domain and an adjacent protein interaction domain designated as PHn-CC-Ex, amino acids 393–738 of Tiam1) and an in vitrobinding assay, we have detected a specific binding interaction between the Tiam1 PHn-CC-Ex domain and CD44. Scatchard plot analysis indicates that there is a single high affinity CD44 binding site in the PHn-CC-Ex domain of Tiam1 with an apparent dissociation constant (K d) of 0.2 nm, which is comparable with CD44 binding (K d = ∼0.13 nm) to intact Tiam1. These findings suggest that the PHn-CC-Ex domain is the primary Tiam1-binding region for CD44. Most importantly, the binding of HA to CD44v3 of SP1 cells stimulates Tiam1-catalyzed Rac1 signaling and cytoskeleton-mediated tumor cell migration. Transfection of SP1 cells with Tiam1cDNA promotes Tiam1 association with CD44v3 and up-regulates Rac1 signaling as well as HA/CD44v3-mediated breast tumor cell migration. Co-transfection of SP1 cells with PHn-CC-Ex cDNA and Tiam1 cDNA effectively inhibits Tiam1 association with CD44 and efficiently blocks tumor behaviors.

Because of their widespread occurrence and their role in signal transduction, CD44 isoforms have been implicated in the regulation of cell growth and activation as well as cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions (1.Lesley J.

One of the distinct features of CD44 isoforms is the enormous heterogeneity in the molecular masses of these proteins. It is now known that all CD44 isoforms are encoded by a single gene that contains 19 exons (8.Screaton G.R. Bell M.V. Jackson D.G. Cornelis F.B. Gerth U. Bell J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12160-12164Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). Of the 19 exons, 12 exons can be alternatively spliced (8.Screaton G.R. Bell M.V. Jackson D.G. Cornelis F.B. Gerth U. Bell J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12160-12164Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). Most often, the alternative splicing occurs between exons 5 and 15, leading to an insertion in tandem of one or more variant exons (v1–v10 (exon 6-exon 14) in human cells) within the membrane-proximal region of the extracellular domain (8.Screaton G.R. Bell M.V. Jackson D.G. Cornelis F.B. Gerth U. Bell J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12160-12164Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). The variable primary amino acid sequence of different CD44 isoforms is further modified by extensive N- and O-glycosylations and glycosaminoglycan additions (9.Bennett K.L. Jackson D.G. Simon J.C.

In particular, CD44v3-containing isoforms have a heparin sulfate addition at the membrane-proximal extracellular domain of the molecule that confers the ability to bind heparin sulfate-binding growth factors (9.Bennett K.L. Jackson D.G. Simon J.C. Tanczos E. Peach R. Modrell B. Stamenkivic I. Plowman G. Aruffo A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 687-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 10.Jackson D.G. Bell J.I. Dickinson R. Timans J. Shields J. Whittle N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 673-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Cell surface expression of CD44v isoforms changes profoundly during tumor metastasis, particularly during the progression of various carcinomas including breast carcinomas (13.Dall P. Heider K.-H.

In fact, CD44v isoform expression has been used as an indicator of metastasis. It has been shown that interaction between the cytoskeletal protein, ankyrin, and the cytoplasmic domain of CD44 isoforms plays an important role in CD44 isoform-mediated oncogenic signaling (6.Bourguignon L.Y.W. Curr. Topics Membr. 1996; 43: 293-312Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 18.Bourguignon L.Y.W. Zhu D. Zhu H.B. Front.

Neuro-Oncol. 1995; 26: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Specifically, the ankyrin-binding domain (e.g.NGGNGTVEDRKPSEL between amino acids 306 and 320 in the mouse CD44 (20.Lokeshwar V.B. Fregien N. Bourguignon L.Y.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1099-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and NSGNGAVEDRKPSGL amino acids 304 and 318 in human CD44 (21.Zhu D. Bourguignon L.Y.W. Cell Motil. Cytoskelet. 1998; 39: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar)) is required for the recruitment of Src kinase and the onset of tumor cell transformation (21.Zhu D. Bourguignon L.Y.W. Cell Motil. Cytoskelet. 1998; 39: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Furthermore, HA binding to CD44 stimulates a concomitant activation of p185HER2-linked tyrosine kinase (linked to CD44s via a disulfide linkage) and results in a direct cross-talk between two different signaling pathways (e.g.proliferation versus motility/invasion) (22.Bourguignon L.Y.W. Zhu H. Chu A. Iida N. Zhang L. Hung H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27913-27918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In tumor cells, the transmembrane linkage between CD44 isoform and the cytoskeleton promotes invasive and metastatic-specific tumor phenotypes (e.g. matrix degradation (matrix metalloproteinases) activities (23.Bourguignon L.Y.W. Gunja-Smith Z. Iida N. Zhu H.B. Young L.J.T. Muller W.J. Cardiff R.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 206-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 24.Yu Q. Stamenkovic I. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 35-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar), “invadopodia” formation (membrane projections), tumor cell invasion, and migration) (23.Bourguignon L.Y.W. Gunja-Smith Z. Iida N. Zhu H.B. Young L.J.T. Muller W.J. Cardiff R.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 206-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). These findings strongly suggest that the interaction between CD44 isoform and the cytoskeleton plays a pivotal role in the onset of oncogenesis and tumor progression. The Rho family proteins (e.g. Rho, Rac, and Cdc42) are members of the Ras superfamily of GTP-binding proteins structurally related to but functionally distinct from Ras itself (25.Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3843) Google Scholar, 26.Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar). They are associated with changes in the membrane-linked cytoskeleton (26.Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar). For example, activation of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 have been shown to produce specific structural changes in the plasma membrane-cytoskeleton reorganization leading to membrane ruffling, lamellipodia, filopodia, and stress fiber formation (26.Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar). The coordinated activation of these GTPases is considered to be a possible mechanism underlying cell motility, an obvious prerequisite for metastasis (27.Dickson R.B. Lippman M.E. Mendelsohn J.

Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3291) Google Scholar). In particular, Rac1 activation is known to initiate oncogenic signaling pathways that promote cell shape changes (33.Ridley A.J. Paterson C.L. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3084) Google Scholar, 34.Nobes C.D. Hall A.

Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The question of whether Rac1 activation is also involved in CD44v3-related cytoskeleton function that results in the metastatic phenotypes (e.g. tumor cell migration) of breast tumor cells remains to be answered. Tiam1 (T lymphoma invasion andmetastasis 1) has been identified as an oncogene because of its ability to activate Rho-like GTPases during malignant transformation (38.Habets G.G.M. Scholtes E.H.M. Zuydgeest D. van der Kammen R.A. Stam J.C. Berns A. Collard J.G. Cell. 1994; 77: 537-549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 39.Habets G.G.M. van der Kammen R.A. Stam J.C. Michiels F. Collard J.G. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1371-1376PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, Tiam1 is capable of activating Rac1 in vitro as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor and inducing membrane cytoskeleton-mediated cell shape changes, cell adhesion, and cell motility (34.Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3747) Google Scholar, 40.Michiels F. Habets G.G.M. Stan J.C. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G.

Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2215-2221PubMed Google Scholar). It also acts as a Rac-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor in vivo and induces an invasive phenotypes in lymphoma cells (40.Michiels F. Habets G.G.M. Stan J.C. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 338-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). These findings have prompted several research groups to investigate the mechanisms involved in the regulation of Tiam1. For example, addition of certain serum-derived lipids (e.g. sphingosine-1-phosphate and lysophosphatidic acid) to T-lymphoma cells promotes Tiam1-mediated Rac1 and Cdc42 signaling and T-lymphoma cell invasion (43.Stam J.C. Michiels F. van der Kammen R.A. Moolenaar W.H. Collard J.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4066-4074Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Tiam1 has also been found to be phosphorylated by protein kinase C in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts stimulated by lysophosphatidic acid (44.Fleming I.N. Elliott C.M. Collard J.G. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33105-33110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and platelet-derived growth factor (45.Fleming I.N. Elliott C.M. Exton J.H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Most recently, Exton and co-workers (46.Fleming I.N. Elliott C.M. Bruchanan F.G. Downes C.P. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12753-12758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) demonstrate that phosphorylation of Tiam1 by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (but not protein kinase C) regulates Tiam1-catalyzed GDP/GTP exchange activity in vitro. These findings support the notion that posttranslational modifications of Tiam1 by certain serine/threonine kinase(s) during surface receptor-mediated activation may play an important role in Tiam1-Rac1 signaling. Tiam1 transcript has been detected in breast cancer cells (39.Habets G.G.M. van der Kammen R.A. Stam J.C. Michiels F. Collard J.G. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1371-1376PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is not known at the present time whether there is any structural and functional relationship(s) between Tiam1-Rac1 signaling and CD44v3-mediated invasive and metastatic processes of breast cancer cells. In this paper, using a variety of biochemical, molecular biological, and immunocytochemical techniques, we have found that the cell adhesion molecule, CD44v3 isoform, which binds directly to HA, is closely associated with Tiam1 (in particular, the NH2-terminal pleckstrin homology (PHn), a putative coiled coil region (CC), and an additional adjacent region (Ex), designated as PHn-CC-Ex domain of Tiam1) in SP1 breast tumor cells. Most importantly, HA binding to CD44v3 isoform stimulates Tiam1-specific GDP/GTP exchange for Rho-like GTPases such as Rac1 and promotes cytoskeleton-mediated tumor cell migration. These findings suggest that a transmembrane interaction between CD44v3 and Tiam1 plays an important role in promoting oncogenic signaling and tumor cell-specific phenotypes required for HA-mediated breast tumor cell migration. Mouse breast tumor cells (e.g. SP1 cell line) (provided by Dr. Bruce Elliott, Department of Pathology, and Biochemistry, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada) were used in this study. Specifically, SP1 cell line was derived from a spontaneous intraductal mammary adenocarcinoma that arose in a retired female CBA/J breeder in the Queen's University animal colony. These cells were capable of inducing lung metastases by sequential passage of SP1 cells into mammary gland (47.Elliott B.E. Maxwell L. Arnold M. Wei W.Z. Miller E.R. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 7237-7245PubMed Google Scholar). These cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5–7% fetal calf serum, folic acid (290 mg/liter), and sodium pyruvate (100 mg/liter). COS-7 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and grown routinely in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% glutamine, 1% penicillin, and 1% streptomycin. For the preparation of polyclonal rabbit anti-Tiam1 antibody or rabbit anti-CD44v3 antibody, specific synthetic peptides (≈15–17 amino acids unique for the COOH-terminal sequence of Tiam1 or the CD44v3 sequence) were prepared by the Peptide Laboratories of Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology using an Advanced Chemtech automatic synthesizer (model ACT350). These Tiam1-related or CD44v3-related polypeptides were conjugated to polylysine and subsequently injected into rabbits to raise the antibodies, respectively. The anti-Tiam1-specific or anti-CD44v3-specific antibody was collected from each bleed and stored at 4 °C containing 0.1% azide. The anti-Tiam1 IgG or anti-CD44v3 IgG fraction was prepared by conventional DEAE-cellulose chromatography, respectively. Mouse monoclonal anti-HA (hemagglutinin epitope) antibody (clone 12 CA5) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Mouse monoclonal anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) was purchased from PharMingen. Escherichia coli-derived GST-tagged Rac1 was kindly provided by Dr. Richard A. Cerione (Cornell University, Itheca, NY). SP1 cells suspended in PBS were surface labeled using the following biotinylation procedure. Briefly, cells (107 cells/ml) were incubated with sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)hexanoate (Pierce) (0.1 mg/ml) in labeling buffer (150 μm NaCl, 0.1 m HEPES, pH 8.0) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed with PBS to remove free biotin. Subsequently, the biotinylated cells were used for anti-CD44v3-mediated immunoprecipitation as described previously (23.Bourguignon L.Y.W. Gunja-Smith Z. Iida N. Zhu H.B. Young L.J.T. Muller W.J. Cardiff R.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 206-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). These biotinylated materials precipitated by anti-CD44v3 antibody were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to the nitrocellulose filters, and incubated with ExtrAvidin-peroxidase (Sigma). After an addition of peroxidase substrate (Pierce), the blots were developed using ECL chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. SP1 cells were solubilized in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 buffer and immunoprecipitated using rabbit anti-CD44v3 antibody or rabbit anti-Tiam1 antibody followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG, respectively. The immunoprecipitated material was solubilized in SDS sample buffer, electrophoresed, and blotted onto the nitrocellulose. After blocking nonspecific sites with 3% bovine serum albumin, the nitrocellulose filter was incubated with rabbit anti-Tiam1 antibody (5 μg/ml) or rabbit anti-CD44v3 antibody (5 μg/ml), respectively, for 1 h at room temperature followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000 dilution) at room temperature for 1 h. The blots were developed using ECL chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In some experiments, SP1 cells or COS cells (e.g.untransfected or transfected by various Tiam1 cDNAs including the full-length mouse Tiam1cDNA (FL1591) or HA-tagged NH2-terminally truncated C1199 Tiam1cDNA or GFP-tagged PHn-CC-ExcDNA or C1199Taim1cDNA plus GFP-tagged PHn-CC-ExcDNA (as co-transfection) or vector only) were immunoblotted with mouse anti-HA antibody (5 μg/ml) or anti-GFP antibody (5 μg/ml), respectively, for 1 h at room temperature followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000 dilution) at room temperature for 1 h. The blots were developed using ECL chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The procedure for preparing the fusion protein of the cytoplasmic domain of CD44 was the same as described previously (48.Bourguignon L.Y.W. Zhu H.B. Shao L. Zhu D. Chen Y.W. Cell Motil. Cytoskelet. 1999; 43: 269-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Specifically, the cytoplasmic domain of human CD44 (CD44cyt) was cloned into pFLAG-AST using the PCR-based cloning strategy. Using human CD44 cDNA as template, one PCR primer pair (left, FLAG-EcoRI; right, FLAG-XbaI) was designed to amplify complete CD44 cytoplasmic domain. The amplified DNA fragments were one-step cloned into a pCR2.1 vector and sequenced. Then the DNA fragments were cut out by double digestion withEcoRI and XbaI and subcloned intoEcoRI/XbaI double-digested pFLAG-AST (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY) to generate FLAG-pCD44cyt construct. The nucleotide sequence of FLAG/CD44cyt junction was confirmed by sequencing. The recombinant plasmids were transformed to BL21-DE3 to produce FLAG-CD44cyt fusion protein. The FLAG-CD44cyt fusion protein was further purified by anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel column (Eastman Kodak Co.). The nucleotide sequence of primers used in this cloning protocol are: FLAG-EcoRI, 5′-GAGAATTCGAACAGTCGAAGAAGGTGTCTCTTAAGC-3′, and FLAG-XbaI, 5′-AGCTCTAGATTACACCCCAATCTTCAT-3′. Both the full-length mouse Tiam1cDNA (FL1591) and the NH2-terminally truncated Tiam1cDNA (C1199) were kindly provided by Dr. John G. Collard (The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Specifically, the full-length Taim1 (FL1591) cDNA was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector, pMT2SM. The NH2-terminally truncated C1199 Tiam1 cDNA (carrying a HA epitope tag at the 3′ end) was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector, pUTSV1 (Eurogentec, Belgium). The Tiam1 fragment, PHn-CC-Ex domain was cloned into calmodulin-binding peptide (CBP)-tagged vector (pCAL-n) (Stratagen) using the PCR-based cloning strategy. Using human Tiam1 cDNA as a template, PHn-CC-Ex domain was amplified by PCR with two specific primers (left, 5′-AACTCGAGATGAGTACCACCAACAGTGAG-3′, and right, 5′-AAAAAGCTTTCAGCCATCTGGAACAGTGTCATC-3′) linked with specific enzyme digestion site (XhoI or HindIII). PCR product digested with XhoI and HindIII was purified with QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen). The PHn-CC-Ex domain cDNA fragment was cloned into pCAL-n vector digested withXhoI and HindIII. The inserted PHn-CC-Ex domain sequence was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing analyses. The recombinant plasmids were transformed to BL21-DE3 to produce CBP-tagged PHn-CC-Ex fusion protein. This fusion protein was purified from bacteria lysate by calmodulin affinity resin column (Sigma). The PHn-CC-Ex domain cDNA fragment was also cloned into pEGFPN1 vector (CLONTECH) digested with XhoI andHindIII to create GFP-tagged PHn-CC-Ex cDNA. The inserted PHn-CC-Ex domain sequence was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing analyses. This GFP-tagged PHn-CC-Ex domain cDNA was then used for transient expression in SP1 cells as described below. The molecular mass of the GFP-tagged PHn-CC-Ex is expressed as 68 kDa in SP1 or COS-7 cells by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analyses. To establish a transient expression system, SP1 cells (or COS-7 cells) were transfected with various plasmid DNAs (e.g. HA-tagged C1199 Tiam1cDNA, GFP-tagged PHn-CC-ExcDNA, or HA-tagged C1199Tiam1cDNA plus GFP-tagged PHn-CC-ExcDNA (as co-transfection) or vector alone) using electroporation methods according to those procedures described previously (74.Chu G. Hayakawa H. Berg P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 1311-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Briefly, SP1 cells were plated at a density of 2 × 106 cells/100-mm dish and transfected with 25 μg/dish plasmid cDNA using electroporation at 230 V and 960 microfaraday with a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad). Transfected cells were grown in the culture medium for at least 24–48 h. Various transfectants were then analyzed for their protein expression (e.g. Tiam1-related proteins) by immunoblot, GDP/GTP exchange reaction on Rac1, and tumor cell migration assays as described below. Aliquots (0.5–1 ng of protein) of purified FLAG-CD44cyt fusion protein bound to Anti-FLAG M2 antibody immunoaffinity beads were incubated in 0.5 ml of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mmNaCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.05% Triton X-100) containing various concentrations (10–800 ng/ml) of 125I-labeled intact Tiam1 (purified from SP1 cells) (5000 cpm/ng protein) or125I-labeled recombinant Tiam1 fragment (CBP-tagged PHn-CC-Ex) at 4 °C for 4 h. Specifically, equilibrium binding conditions were determined by performing a time course (1–10 h) of125I-labeled Tiam1 (or CBP-tagged PHn-CC-Ex) binding to CD44 at 4 °C. The binding equilibrium was found to be established when the in vitro Tiam1 (or PHn-CC-Ex)-CD44 binding assay was conducted at 4 °C after 4 h. Following binding, the immunobeads were washed extensively in binding buffer, and the bead-bound radioactivity was counted. Nonspecific binding was determined using a 50–100-fold excess of unlabeled Tiam1 (or PHn-CC-Ex) in the presence of the same concentration of125I-labeled Tiam1 or 125I-labeled CBP-tagged PHn-CC-Ex. Nonspecific binding, which was approximately 20% of the total binding, was always subtracted from the total binding. Our binding data are highly reproducible. The values expressed in Fig. 5represent an average of triplicate determinations of three to five experiments with a standard deviation less than ± 5%. In some cases, 0.1 μg of surface biotinylated CD44v3 was incubated with various Tiam1-related proteins (e.g. purified intact Tiam1, HA-tagged C1199, CBP-PHn-CC-Ex, or HA/CBP-coated beads) in the presence and absence of 100-fold excess amount of CBP-PHn-CC-Ex at room temperature in the binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.05% Triton X-100) for 1 h. After binding, biotinylated CD44v3 bound to the beads was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to the nitrocellulose filters, and incubated with ExtrAvidin-peroxidase (Sigma). After an addition of peroxidase substrate (Pierce), the blots were developed using ECL chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PurifiedE. coli-derived GST-tagged Rac1 (20pmol) was preloaded with GDP (30 μm) in 10 μl of buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4.7 mm EDTA, 0.16 mm MgCl2, and 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 7 min. To terminate preloading procedures, additional MgCl2 was then added to the solution (reaching a final concentration of 9.16 mm) as described previously (40.Michiels F. Habets G.G.M.

Here we demonstrate interactions between Itk and crucial components of TCR-dependent signaling pathways. First, the inositide-binding pocket of the Itk pleckstrin homology domain directs the constitutive association of Itk with buoyant membranes that are the primary site of TCR activation and are enriched in both Lck and LAT. This association is required for the transphosphorylation of Itk. Second, the Itk proline-rich region binds to Grb2 and LAT. Third, the Itk Src homology (SH3) 3 and SH2 domains interact cooperatively with Syk-phosphorylated SLP-76. Notably, SLP-76 contains a predicted binding motif for the Itk SH2 domain and binds to full-length Itk in vitro. Finally, we show that kinase-inactive Itk can antagonize the SLP-76-dependent activation of NF-AT. The inhibition of NF-AT activation depends on the Itk pleckstrin homology domain, proline-rich region, and SH2 domain.

Collectively, these receptors direct the antigen-specific responses of T cells, B cells, and mast cells. Although these antigen receptors do not contain intrinsic tyrosine kinases, the early events downstream of these antigen receptors are controlled by a relatively conserved series of tyrosine kinase-dependent events. In each case, Src family kinases initiate the signaling cascade by phosphorylating immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs present in the cytoplasmic tails of the signal-transducing receptor subunits. Complete immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs phosphorylation results in the recruitment of Syk/ZAP-70 family tyrosine kinases to the receptor. These kinases are subsequently activated by Src kinase-mediated transphosphorylation. The substrates of the Syk kinases include internal phosphorylation sites as well as transphosphorylation sites in LAT, SLP-76, and BLNK, a SLP-76-related adapter protein (1.Wange R.L. Samelson L.E.

However, the mechanisms that integrate the Tec kinases into antigen receptor-dependent signaling pathways are not yet well understood. Structurally, these kinases share the conserved arrangement of SH3, SH2, and kinase domains found in Src kinases, but are distinguished by the absence of amino-terminal acylations, the absence of the carboxyl-terminal regulatory tyrosine, and by the presence of a conserved amino-terminal region containing a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a Btk homology motif, and a proline-rich region (PRR). Although the functions of the protein-binding domains of Tec kinases remain unclear, the phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) binding pocket present in Tec kinase PH domains is clearly required for the cooperative activation of PLCγ isoforms by PI3K and Tec kinases (32.Scharenberg A.M. Kinet J.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The importance of the PH domain is underscored by the observation that its disruption can result in immunological disorders in both humans (XLA) and mice (Xid) (36.Sideras P. Smith C.I. Adv. Immunol. 1995; 59: 135-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This lipid-protein interaction directs the recruitment of Tec kinases to the plasma membrane and facilitates their transphosphorylation and activation by Src kinases (23.Gibson S. August A.

Although protein interaction domains have been shown to recruit kinases to specific complexes containing physiological activators and substrates, the protein-protein interactions responsible for the facilitation of calcium influxes and the activation of MAPKs by Tec family kinases have not yet been identified. Given the similarity of the phenotypes observed upon the disruption of Src kinases, Syk kinases, adapter proteins (LAT, SLP-76, and BLNK), and Tec kinases, the Tec kinases are likely to interact with these proteins in order to facilitate the formation or activation of a competent signaling complex. However, the Tec kinase ligands reported to date have not supported this hypothesis. For example, it has been suggested that Tec kinase PRRs facilitate the transphosphorylation and activation of Tec kinases by recruiting Src kinases (44.Yang W. Malek S.N. Desiderio S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20832-20840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the contributions of Tec kinase PRRs to the physiological transphosphorylation of Tec kinases and to the induction of calcium influxes by antigen receptors remain untested. Furthermore, although ligands have been reported for the SH3 domains of Tec kinases, the SH3 domain does not appear to be relevant to the induction of calcium influxes (45.Scharenberg A.M. El-Hillal O. Fruman D.A. Beitz L.O. Li Z. Lin S. Gout I. Cantley L.C. Rawlings D.J. Kinet J.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1961-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). In contrast, ligands of the SH2 domains of Tec kinases remain unknown, yet the SH2 domain is clearly involved in the induction of calcium influxes and participates in Tec kinase-mediated transformation (39.Li T. Rawlings D.J. Park H. Kato R.M. Witte O.N. Satterthwaite A.B. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1375-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 45.Scharenberg A.M. El-Hillal O. Fruman D.A. Beitz L.O. Li Z. Lin S. Gout I. Cantley L.C. Rawlings D.J. Kinet J.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1961-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Since Syk kinases act upstream of the Tec kinases but do not appear to phosphorylate the Tec kinases (46.Kurosaki T. Kurosaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15595-15598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 47.Wan Y. Bence K. Hata A. Kurosaki T. Veillette A. Huang X.Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 29323-29330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), Syk kinases may facilitate the recruitment of Tec kinases to sites at which they encounter either activators (Src kinases) or substrates (such as PLCγ) by generating docking sites for Tec kinase SH2 domains. Since the substrates of the Syk kinases include LAT, SLP-76, BLNK, and the Syk kinases themselves, interactions mediated by Tec kinase SH2 domains may recruit the Tec kinases into complexes with physiologically relevant partners. The identification of ligands for the protein-interaction domains of Tec kinases may be complicated by the ability of these proteins to adopt a closed conformation. This closed conformation depends on intramolecular interactions between adjacent PRRs and SH3 domains and severely limits the participation of these domains in intermolecular interactions (49.Andreotti A.H. Bunnell S.C. Feng S. Berg L.J. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1997; 385: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). To date, the functional consequences of this closed conformation have not been resolved. However, two lines of evidence suggest that the closed conformation limits the activity of Tec kinases. First, the deletion of the SH3 domain, which releases the Tec kinase PRR from intramolecular sequestration, potentiates both antigen receptor-dependent calcium influxes and Btk-dependent transformation (45.Scharenberg A.M. El-Hillal O. Fruman D.A. Beitz L.O. Li Z. Lin S. Gout I. Cantley L.C. Rawlings D.J. Kinet J.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1961-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 50.Li T. Tsukada S. Satterthwaite A. Havlik M.H. Park H. Takatsu K. Witte O.N. Immunity. 1995; 2: 451-460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Second, Tec kinase autophosphorylation is strongly correlated with Tec kinase activation and is likely to disrupt the closed conformation, since the primary site of autophosphorylation is a tyrosine residue in the ligand-binding pocket of the SH3 domain (51.Nisitani S.

Although the SH2 domain contributes to the stabilization of the closed conformation, the sequestration of the SH3 domain and PRR can be reversed by exposure to highly tyrosine-phosphorylated lysates (49.Andreotti A.H. Bunnell S.C. Feng S. Berg L.J. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1997; 385: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), implying that intermolecular interactions driven by the SH2 domain may also antagonize the closed conformation of Tec kinases. In this article we report the identification of ligands for the homology domains of Itk in both Jurkat T cells and in primary murine CD4+ T cells. These observations suggest a model in which multivalent interactions overcome the closed conformation in order to recruit Itk to a LAT-nucleated signaling complex and facilitate the activation of LAT-associated PLCγ1 by Itk.

Biotinylated and fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies to murine CD3ε and CD4 were purchased from Pharmingen. The native stop codon of Itk was deleted and replaced with a PCR-derived fragment encoding a short linker peptide and a carboxyl-terminal Myc epitope tag. These modifications extend Itk by 21 amino acids (AGAEFMEQKLISEEDLRKFDI). EF/Itk-myc expression vectors were generated by inserting the modified Itk cDNA into a derivative of pEF-BOS (54.Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar). EF/Itk-KR-myc includes a kinase-inactivating mutation (K390R (24.Heyeck S.D. Wilcox H.M. Bunnell S.C. Berg L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25401-25408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar)). Mutations inactivating the proline-rich region (P158A, P159A; PR*) and the binding pockets of the PH domain (R29C; Xid), SH3 domain (W208K; SH3*), and SH2 domain (R265A; SH2*) were introduced by either site-directed or PCR-directed mutagenesis. The EF/HA:SLP-76 expression vector was generated by subcloning the SLP-76 coding region into a transfer vector, and then into pEF-HA. This results in the insertion of a short linker-derived peptide (RSRTSGSPGRAA) between the triple-HA epitope tag present in pEF-HA (a kind gift of Anjana Rao) and the original start codon of SLP-76. GST fusion proteins were prepared as described previously (49.Andreotti A.H. Bunnell S.C. Feng S. Berg L.J. Schreiber S.L.

Briefly, inserts encoding the desired domains of Itk were generated by PCR and subcloned into theBamHI site of pGEX-2T. The TEC-, SH3-, and SH2–5′ primers encode Itk products beginning at amino acids 97, 171, and 231, respectively. The TEC-, SH3-, and SH2–3′ primers terminate at amino acids 174, 232, and 338, respectively. The soluble TEC fragment was prepared by thrombin cleavage of the TEC fusion protein as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The Itk SH2 domain binding motif was obtained by the method of Songyang and Cantley (56.Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C.

In contrast to previous reports, the bound phosphopeptide mixture was eluted with 30% acetic acid rather than phenyl phosphate. The relative enrichments displayed in Fig.5 A were obtained normalizing the abundance (mol %) of amino acids in the bound mixture to their abundance in the starting library. Unlike previous reports of SH2 domain binding motifs, these data were not background corrected by subtracting the amino acid abundances observed after purification over GST prior to normalization. For comparison, the selection for proline at pY+3 is exceptionally strong, and is roughly equivalent to the selection of asparagine at pY+2 by the Grb2 SH2 domain. Jurkat cells were transfected with 1 μg of pBJneo and either 10 μg of the empty pEF-HA expression vector, EF:Itk-KR-myc, EF:Itk-Xid/KR-myc, or EF:Itk-PR*/KR-myc, as described (24.Heyeck S.D. Wilcox H.M. Bunnell S.C. Berg L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25401-25408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Stable cell lines were derived by selection in 1.4 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Lines expressing Itk-myc at approximately endogenous levels were expanded for use in subsequent experiments. These lines were determined to express normal levels of CD3ε by flow cytometry (FACScan, Beckton Dickinson). The GST:Syk baculovirus was provided by Ian MacNeil (Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA) and results in the expression of a GST fusion of full-length Syk. The Lck and Itk baculoviruses have been described (24.Heyeck S.D. Wilcox H.M. Bunnell S.C. Berg L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25401-25408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The HA:SLP-76 baculovirus was derived from the EF/HA:SLP-76 expression vector in the same manner. Sf9 cells, Jurkat cells (clone E6.1), and Jurkat derivatives were maintained, stimulated, and lysed as described (24.Heyeck S.D. Wilcox H.M. Bunnell S.C. Berg L.J. J. Biol.

CD4+ T cells were purified from murine spleens by removing red blood cells with red blood cell lysis buffer and killing CD8+ T cells by incubation with anti-CD8 antibody (3.155) followed by complement (Cedarlane). Live lymphocytes were isolated and stimulated with 10 ng/ml PMA and 2 μg/ml concanavalin A. Cells were rinsed into interleukin-2-containing media at 2, 4, and 6 days after the initiation of the cultures. By day 8 the TCR+ CD4+ T cells had expanded approximately 100-fold and represented greater than 95% of the cells in culture, as assayed by FACS. These cells were rested 1 h at 37 °C in the absence of interleukin-2 prior to stimulation. The CD4+ T cells were stimulated by preincubating with biotinylated antibodies to both CD3ε and CD4 (10 μg/ml each) at 4 °C for 10 min and shifting to 37 °C upon the addition of streptavidin (25 μg/ml). After 2 min of stimulation, lysates were prepared as described. This protocol was adapted from previously described methods for the isolation of buoyant membranes (58.Bourguignon L.Y.W. Jin H.

Both unstimulated and OKT3-stimulated Jurkat cells (108) were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline with 20 mm sodium fluoride and 1 mmsodium orthovanadate and resuspended in 1.6 ml of ice-cold homogenization buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 12.5 mm KCl, 5 mm sodium fluoride, and 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, supplemented with protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin A, aprotinin, and leupeptin (Sigma)). Cells were homogenized on ice using a Dounce homogenizer. Total homogenates were adjusted to gradient buffer conditions by the addition of homogenization buffer with concentrated salts. Gradient buffer contained 50 mm KCl, 20 mm sodium fluoride, and 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, but was otherwise identical to homogenization buffer. Homogenates were adjusted to the desired density by the addition of 80% sucrose (w/v) in gradient buffer. The diluted homogenate was loaded into a SW41 ultracentrifuge tube and a gradient was created by successively overlaying 1-ml steps of the indicated sucrose solutions, also in gradient buffer. The step gradients were ultracentrifuged for 16 h at 39,000 rpm and at 4 °C. Fractions were removed in 0.5-ml aliquots and the pellet was rinsed once in 0.5 ml of gradient buffer, then resuspended by sonication in 0.5 ml of gradient buffer. 20 μl of each fraction was analyzed without concentration by Western blotting; thus each gel represents the total protein content from 20/500 (4%) of 108 cells. Optical density at 600 nm (Beckman DU-600 spectrophotometer) was used to monitor light scattering by vesicular structures (58.Bourguignon L.Y.W. Jin H. Iida N. Brandt N.R. Zhang S.H. J. Biol.

To gain a better understanding of the function and regulation of PKCθ, we have employed the yeast two-hybrid system to identify PKCθ-interacting proteins. We report the isolation and characterization of a cDNA encoding a novel 335-amino acid (37.5-kDa) PKCθ-interacting protein termed PICOT (for PKC-interactingcousin of thioredoxin). PICOT is expressed in various tissues, including in T cells, where it colocalizes with PKCθ. PICOT displays an N-terminal thioredoxin homology domain, which is required for the interaction with PKC. Comparison of the unique C-terminal region of PICOT with expressed sequence tag data bases revealed two tandem repeats of a novel domain that is highly conserved from plants to mammals. Transient overexpression of full-length PICOT (but not its N- or C-terminal fragments) in T cells inhibited the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase), and the transcription factors AP-1 or NF-κB. These findings suggest that PICOT and its evolutionary conserved homologues may interact with PKC-related kinases in multiple organisms and, second, that it plays a role in regulating the function of the thioredoxin system.

J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1467) Google Scholar, 2.Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2356) Google Scholar, 3.Jaken S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The PKC family consists of 11 known mammalian members that are expressed in a wide variety of tissues and cell types. Based on sequence similarities, domain structures, and cofactor requirements, PKC isoenzymes can be grouped into three subfamilies. 1) The Ca2+-dependent conventional enzymes, consisting of PKC-α, -βI, -βII, and -γ, contain three conserved domains, namely the diacylglycerol/phorbol ester binding C1 domain, which contains two repeats of a cysteine-rich zinc finger, the phospholipid- and calcium-binding C2 domain, and the catalytic C3 and C4 domains. 2) The Ca2+-independent enzymes (PKC-δ, -ε, -η, -θ and -μ) are termed novel PKCs. The C2-like N-terminal domain of these enzymes can bind acidic phospholipids but not Ca2+. 3) A third PKC subfamily, termed atypical PKCs, includes PKC-ζ and -ι/λ that possess a single cysteine-rich domain, lacking the ability to bind phospholipids or phorbol esters. PKC activity is regulated by defined cofactors that interact with specific regions of the regulatory domain as well as transphosphorylation by serine/threonine kinases and autophosphorylation. The activation is accompanied by a conformational change that releases the basic pseudosubstrate region from the catalytic cleft of the kinase domain. In addition, interaction with specific proteins, termed receptors for activated PKC, that function as selective scaffolds for activated PKCs at discrete subcellular compartments, play a role in activation of PKC (4.Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). In the course of isolating novel PKC isoforms that play a role in T cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling, we isolated PKCθ, a Ca2+-independent PKC isoform characterized by a unique tissue distribution, i.e. in skeletal muscle, lymphoid organs, and hematopoietic cell lines, particularly in T cells (5.Baier G. Telford D. Giampa L. Coggeshall K.M. Baier-Bitterlich G. Isakov N. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4997-5004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKCθ plays a selective role in the activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/AP-1 pathway and the interleukin-2 gene in T cells (6.Baier-Bitterlich G. Überall F. Bauer B. Fresser F. Wachter H.

Kupfer A. Nature. 1998; 395: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1964) Google Scholar). In order to a gain a better understanding of the function and regulation of PKCθ in TCR signaling, we have employed the yeast two-hybrid system to identify PKCθ-interacting proteins. Here we describe the isolation of a novel PKCθ-interacting protein having a unique domain structure, which consists of an N-terminal thioredoxin (Trx)-homologous domain followed by two tandem repeats of a novel, evolutionary conserved protein domain. We have termed this protein PICOT (for PKC-interacting cousinof thioredoxin). Transient overexpression of PICOT inhibited the activation of JNK and two transcription factorsi.e. AP-1 and NF-κB, induced by PKCθ or by combinations of T cell-activating stimuli, suggesting that this novel protein plays an important role in regulating T cell activation and the function of PKCθ. The anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) was affinity-purified from culture supernatants of the OKT3 hybridoma as described (11.Liu Y.-C. Elly C. Langdon W.Y. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 168-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). An anti-human CD28 mAb was obtained from PharMingen. The PKCθ-specific mAb and rabbit polyclonal antibody were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. The anti-c-Myc mAb (9E10) was purified from culture supernatants of the corresponding hybridoma by protein A-Sepharose chromatography, and the anti-hemagglutinin (HA) mAb (12CA5) was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Polyclonal goat anti-JNK and rabbit anti-ERK2 antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and phospho-c-Jun- or phospho-ERK2-specific antibodies were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled secondary antibodies were from Pierce. A polyclonal rabbit anti-PICOT antiserum was generated using standard protocols. In brief, a peptide comprising amino acids 90–108 of the deduced human PICOT sequence was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and injected into two rabbits. Both antisera recognized a protein band with the predicted electrophoretic mobility of PICOT (38 kDa) in immunoblots of cell lysates. For immunohistochemistry, a portion of the antiserum was affinity-purified on a Sepharose-coupled synthetic peptide column. The full-length PKCθ cDNA with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag in the pEF mammalian expression vector has been described previously (12.Meller N. Liu Y.C. Collins T.L., N., B.-B. Baier G. Isakov N.

An HA-tagged constitutively active calcineurin mutant consisting of the catalytic subunit of calcineurin (CnA), from which the calmodulin-binding and the autoinhibitory domains were deleted (CnAΔCaM-AI) was a generous gift from Dr. M. Karin (University of California, San Diego), and was described (8.Werlen G. Jacinto E. Karin M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3101-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). To construct human PICOT expression vectors, the corresponding full-length cDNA or fragments encoding the N- (residues 1–146) or C- (residues 133–335) terminal regions of PICOT were subcloned into pEF, and an N-terminal hexahistidine tag followed by a subsequent HA tag was added at the 5′ end of the cDNA. HA-tagged JNK1 and c-Myc-tagged ERK2 were cloned in pSRα and pcDNA3, respectively. The AP-1 and NF-κB luciferase reporter plasmids were obtained from M. Karin. The yeast two-hybrid system used in this study was kindly donated by E. A. Golemis (Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA), and has been described previously (14.Golemis E.A. Serebriiskii I.

For expression of recombinant proteins, cells were transfected for 48 h with appropriate amounts of plasmids (usually 3–20 μg total) by electroporation as described (11.Liu Y.-C. Elly C. Langdon W.Y. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 168-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 12.Meller N. Liu Y.C. Collins T.L., N., B.-B. Baier G. Isakov N. Altman A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5782-5791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In each experiment, cells in different groups were transfected with the same total amount of plasmid DNA by supplementing expression vector DNA with the proper amounts of the corresponding empty vector. Where indicated, the cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 and/or anti-CD28 antibodies, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA; 100 ng/ml) and/or ionomycin (1 μg/ml), or irradiated with UV (312 nm) for 1 min at room temperature using a transilluminator (FBTI-88; Fisher Scientific) and cultured for an additional h. Cells were lysed in 1× Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaPPi, 5 mm NaF, 5 mm Na3VO4) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 10 min on ice. The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The cDNAs encoding full-length human PICOT or its N-terminal or C-terminal fragments were subcloned into the bacterial GST fusion vector pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Expression and purification of the GST fusion proteins was performed as described (16.Liu Y.-C. Elly C. Yoshida H. Bonnefoy-Bérard N. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14591-14595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Cell lysates (usually from 1 × 107cells) were incubated with 10 μg of GST fusion proteins coupled to 40 μl of glutathione-agarose for 2 h at 4 °C. The binding mixtures were washed extensively in 1× Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Multi Tissue cDNA Panels (CLONTECH) were screened by RT-PCR with a pair of PICOT-specific primers according to the instructions of the manufacturer. For amplification of a 1-kilobase pair PICOT fragment, 35 cycles were used, and the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase control was amplified using 25 PCR cycles. 20 μg of total RNA from Jurkat cells was prepared using standard procedures. The PICOT plasmid isolated from the yeast two-hybrid screen or a full-length glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA were used for generation of32P-labeled probes using a commercial kit (Rediprime II, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Jurkat cells were lysed and separated into a membrane, cytosol, and detergent-insoluble fractions as described (12.Meller N. Liu Y.C. Collins T.L., N., B.-B. Baier G. Isakov N. Altman A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5782-5791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected or nontransfected Jurkat-TAg cells were left unstimulated, or stimulated with 100 ng/ml PMA for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were then spun down, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized in 0.05% saponin. Transfected cells were then stained with a polyclonal rabbit anti-PICOT antibody and an anti-PKCθ mAb. Nontransfected cells were stained with a polyclonal anti-PKCθ antibody and Alexa 488-conjugated, affinity-purified anti-PICOT antibody. Samples were then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies (Pierce) or Alexa 594 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), respectively, and were subsequently washed four times with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. After the final wash, the cells were mounted on glass slides using a drop of Aqua-Poly/mount (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA). Samples were viewed with a Plan-Apochromat 63× lens on a Nikon microscope. Images were taken using a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 laser scanning confocal imaging system. Lysates (1–2 × 107 cells) were mixed with antibodies (1–2 μg) for 2 h, followed by addition of 40 μl of protein A/G Plus-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for an additional h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with 1× Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and twice with PBS (pH 7.2). After boiling in 20 μl 2x Laemmli sample buffer, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were immunoblotted with the indicated primary antibodies, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Bands were visualized by chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). When necessary, membranes were stripped by incubation in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS for 1 h at 65 °C, washed, and then reprobed with other antibodies as indicated. In vitro kinase assays of immunoprecipitated JNK or ERK2 were conducted as described. Briefly, washed JNK1 or ERK2 immunoprecipitates were assayed using 2 μg of GST-c-Jun fusion protein or myelin basic protein as substrates, respectively, in 20 μl of JNK or ERK2 kinase buffers containing 3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (30 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Kinase reactions were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with gentle shaking, and were stopped by addition of 20 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS/13% PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and subjected to autoradiography. Substrate phosphorylation was quantified by PhosphorImager (Storm 860; Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) analysis. The nitrocellulose membranes were routinely reprobed with anti-JNK or -ERK2 antibodies to confirm equal expression levels of the immunoprecipitated kinases. Transfected Jurkat-TAg cells were harvested, washed twice with PBS, and lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer (100 mm KPO4, pH 7.8, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton X-100) for 10 min at room temperature. The lysates were then centrifuged (15,000 × g, 5 min at 4 °C). Fifty μl of the supernatant were mixed with 100 μl of assay buffer (17.5 mm glycylglycine, pH 7.8, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 0.135 mm coenzyme A, 0.235 mm luciferin), and the luciferase activity determined in a luminometer (Monolight 2010; Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, Sparks, MD). The protein content was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. The final results were expressed as arbitrary relative luciferase units per microgram of protein. To identify proteins that interact with PKCθ in vivo, we performed three independent yeast two-hybrid screens using the full-length PKCθ, its regulatory domain, or its catalytic domain as baits to screen a Jurkat T lymphoma cDNA library fused to a cDNA encoding a transcription activation domain (14.Golemis E.A. Serebriiskii I. Gyurtis J. Brent R. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Morre D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 3. Wiley Interscience, New York1997: 20.1.1-20.1.8Google Scholar). Since expression of catalytically active forms of PKCθ as LexA fusion proteins was toxic to yeast (data not shown), a point-mutated cDNA encoding a catalytically inactive PKCθ (K409R) was used for the yeast two-hybrid screening. Approximately 5 × 107independent clones were screened with each bait. No clones growing on selective medium were obtained with the isolated regulatory or catalytic domains of PKCθ, respectively (TableI). Screening with the catalytically inactive, full-length PKCθ bait resulted in 17 primary positive colonies, which grew on selective medium and were β-galactosidase-positive when tested in a filter lift assay (TableI). Thus, the observed interaction in yeast requires full-length PKCθ, but does not depend on its intact catalytic activity.Table ISpecific interactions between PKCθ and PICOT in the yeast two-hybrid systemDNA-binding domain hybrid “bait”Activation domain hybrid “prey”Growth on Ura− His−Trp−Leu−mediumColony colorPKCθ K409R−−WhitePKCθ reg. dom.

Open table in a new tab EGY48 yeast cells were cotransformed with expression vectors encoding various LexA DNA-binding domain and activation domain fusion proteins. Activation of the leu2 reporter gene was monitored by growth on leucine-deficient medium, and the activity of the lacZreporter gene was monitored using a filter assay. Ten of the positive, PKCθ-interacting clones were found to contain cDNAs that specifically interacted with the bait. Partial sequence analysis revealed that these clones encoded identical cDNAs. The two longest cDNAs (∼1,250 base pairs in length) were sequenced, and found to contain an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a putative protein of 335 amino acids (Fig.1 a). Since the putative protein product contained a Trx-homologous domain (see below), it was named PICOT (for PKC-interactingcousin of thioredoxin) (see below). Northern blot analysis using one of the yeast two-hybrid clones as a probe indicated that a hybridizing mRNA of 1.5 kilobase pairs is expressed in a preparation of total RNA from Jurkat T cells (Fig.1 b), suggesting the isolated clones contained the complete ORF. A rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR of a human thymus cDNA library failed to reveal additional upstream sequences, thus confirming that the isolated cDNAs were full-length. The isolated human PICOT cDNA sequence was used to conduct a search of the GenBank data base of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) for homologous sequences. This analysis identified an identical putative human ORF (accession no. h59799) as well as homologous mouse (accession no. aa009010) and rat (accession no. aa866363) clones. The corresponding plasmids were obtained from Genome Systems or Research Genetics, respectively, and sequenced. Using the BLAST algorithm, homologous sequences were also identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae(Swissprot ye04 yeast), Escherichia coli (Swissprot ydhd_ecoli), Haemophilus influenzae (Swissprot ydhd_haein),Caenorhabditis elegans (GenBank g3217992), andArabidopsis thaliana (GenBank g3335374) (see Fig.2). The ORF of the PICOT cDNA encodes a putative protein with a predicted molecular mass of 37.5 kDa (Fig. 1 a). The codon for the first methionine is surrounded by a consensus Kozak sequence, but is not preceded by an in-frame stop codon. To confirm the expression of the putative protein encoded by the cDNA we have isolated, rabbit antisera were generated against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 90–108 of PICOT, a hydrophilic sequence with a high surface probability. Immunoblotting of lysates from E. coliexpressing full-length PICOT as a GST fusion protein (GST-PICOT) or from untransfected Jurkat cells revealed expression of an immunoreactive ∼74-kDa protein in E. coli, and a ∼38-kDa protein in Jurkat cells, consistent with the predicted size of PICOT (data not shown). This antiserum was used in subsequent expression studies (see below). To determine the cellular localization of PICOT, we fractionated Jurkat T lymphoma cells and analyzed the cellular distribution of the protein. As shown in Fig. 1 c, PICOT was almost exclusively localized in the cytosol, with additional, very low expression in the membrane fraction, but no detectable expression in the detergent-insoluble cellular fraction. The tissue distribution of PICOT was analyzed by RT-PCR using a commercial cDNA panel derived from different human tissues. The expression of PICOT mRNA was more ubiquitous than that of PKCθ; nevertheless, it was not expressed in all tissues. It was abundant in heart, spleen, and testis, with low but detectable expression in the other tissues tested, including in the thymus and peripheral blood leukocytes; expression of the relevant mRNA in the lung, placenta, colon, and small intestine was very low (Fig. 1 d). Search of the GenBank nucleotide data base revealed a 29% amino acid identity and an additional 11% similarity between the N-terminal region of PICOT (residues 12–143) and the Trx family of proteins (Fig. 2, a and b). However, the Trx homology domain of PICOT lacks the conserved Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys motif, which is essential for catalytic activity (17.Nakamura H. Nakamura K. Yodoi J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 351-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar), and contains instead an Ala-Pro-Gln-Cys motif. The aforementioned EST data base-derived mouse and rat homologues of PICOT encode the corresponding full-length proteins. The deduced protein sequences show >99% identity to the human sequence, with the rat protein lacking residues 90–148 of human or mouse PICOT (data not shown). Analysis of the protein sequence of PICOT against sequences of putative proteins derived from genome sequencing projects revealed a highly conserved sequence motif of 84 amino acids. This motif represents a novel, previously unknown domain, which is found in all organisms searched, including nematodes, yeast, bacteria, viruses, and plants (Fig. 2 c). The human, mouse, and rat PICOT proteins display two tandem repeats of this domain (Fig. 2, a andc), whereas the homologous proteins present in lower organisms contain only a single repeat. Thus, PICOT shows a discrete domain structure, consisting of an N-terminal Trx-like domain followed by two novel PICOT homology domains (Fig. 2 a). To confirm the interaction of PICOT with PKCθ, and analyze its specificity at the level of PKC, we first ascertained whether these two proteins are associated in intact T cells. Jurkat-TAg cells were cotransfected with PKCθ plus HA epitope-tagged PICOT expression vectors. When lysates from these cells were immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA mAb, PKCθ was found to coimmunoprecipitate with PICOT (Fig.3 a). An unrelated control antibody did not precipitate either of these two proteins. This interaction was confirmed by precipitating T cell lysates with a GST-PICOT fusion protein in vitro. Incubation of the recombinant protein, but not the control GST protein, with lysates from Jurkat cells transfected with PKCθ, PKCα, or PKCζ, followed by immunoblotting with antibodies against the respective PKC isoforms, revealed that PICOT bound PKCθ and, to a lower extent, PKCζ (Fig.3 b). Under the same conditions, no interaction with PKCα was detected, suggesting that PICOT displays some selectivity with regard to its ability to associate with PKC isoforms. In order to further define the structural basis for the interaction of PICOT with PKCθ, we expressed the PICOT N-terminal region corresponding to its Trx-like domain (residues 1–146) and its C-terminal fragment representing the two tandem PICOT homology domains (residues 133–335) as GST fusion proteins, and used these recombinant proteins to precipitate cell lysates from PKCθ-transfected Jurkat cells. As shown in Fig. 3 c, the N-terminal, Trx-like domain of PICOT was sufficient for PKCθ binding, although it was less effective than the full-length protein. In contrast, the C-terminal region of PICOT did not display any detectable binding to PKCθ. In yeast, only full-length PICOT associated with PKCθ (Table I), suggesting that the affinity of the interaction is lower in yeast. This difference may reflect a favorable conformation of PICOT for this interaction in vitro (where it was expressed as a GST fusion protein) compared with yeast (where PICOT was expressed as a fusion protein with a transcription activation domain). In order to determine the relative localization of PICOT versus PKCθ in situ, transfected or untransfected Jurkat cells were stained with PICOT- and PKCθ-specific antibodies, and analyzed by confocal microscopy. In unstimulated cells, which were transfected with both PICOT and PKCθ, both proteins colocalized to a distinct cytoplasmic area under the plasma membrane (Fig. 4,a and b), and their colocalization was evident when the two individual images were overlaid (Fig. 4 c). PMA stimulation caused translocation of both PICOT and PKCθ to a more extended membrane (or submembrane) area, with colocalization of the two proteins still evident (Fig. 4, d–f). We also analyzed the localization of the relevant endogenous protein in untransfected cells. The quality of this analysis was lower due to the lower expression of the proteins and the fact that it was necessary to use a polyclonal anti-PKCθ antibody, which produces a less satisfactory staining than that obtained with the monoclonal antibody used in the transfected cells. Nevertheless, endogenous PICOT and PKCθ also appeared to colocalize in the same area of the cell, with an overall staining pattern similar to the one observed in the transfected cells (Fig. 4, g–i). As PICOT was identified on the basis of its interaction with PKCθ, we examined the effect of transient PICOT overexpression on the activation of the stress-activated protein kinase JNK, since it represents a selective target of PKCθ in the TCR/CD28 signaling pathway (7.Ghaffari-Tabrizi N.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3101-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Jurkat-TAg cells were cotransfected with different combinations of expression plasmids encoding PICOT, PKCθ and/or constitutively active calcineurin (CnAΔCaM-AI). The latter plasmid was used since calcineurin cooperates with PKCθ in the activation of JNK and the"

FAOSTAT nutrition data, food supply statistics. http://apps.fao.orgGoogle Scholar, 2.Cock J.H. Science. 1982; 218: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Its starchy tuberous roots are the major staple food for several hundred million people. The average annual per capita consumption of cassava is 347 kg in the Democratic Republic of Congo (1994-1996 numbers; Ref. 1.FAO homepages. FAOSTAT nutrition data, food supply statistics. http://apps.fao.orgGoogle Scholar). The importance of the cassava plant is increasing for a number of reasons. Cassava produces well on poor soils and can be grown with low input. It is very drought-resistant, and the tubers can be left in the soil for a couple of years. Accordingly, growth of cassava provides an important reserve carbohydrate source to prevent or relieve famine during periods of adverse climate conditions and offers the possibility to obtain a harvest from eroded and otherwise abandoned fields. The crop is propagated vegetatively from stem cuttings. In periods of food shortage, the farmer is therefore not required to save a part of the edible cassava crop for replanting of the fields to obtain next year's crop. Major deficits of cassava are the low protein content in the tuberous roots, poor storability after harvest, and the high content of cyanogenic glucosides (3.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). Cassava contains the two cyanogenic glucosides linamarin and lotaustralin in all parts of the plant (4.Nartey F. Phytochemistry. 1968; 7: 1307-1312Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Upon tissue disruption, the cyanogenic glucosides are degraded with concomitant release of hydrogen cyanide and ketones. The level of cyanide generated from the tubers differs from one variety to the other but ranges between 0.15 and 1.5 g/kg of tuber as calculated on a dry weight basis. Acyanogenic cassava plants are not known (3.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). Use of cassava products as a staple food thus requires careful processing to remove the cyanide. Inadequate processing may result in chronic cyanide intoxication and tropical ataxic neuropathy (5.Osuntokun B.O. World Rev. Nut. Diet. 1981; 26: 141-173Crossref Google Scholar). Severe cases of cyanide intoxication have been correlated to outbreaks of the paralytic disease konzo (6.Tylleskär T. Banea M. Bikangi N. Cooke R.D. Poulter N.H. Rosling H.

Typically, processing is labor intensive and time-consuming and results in a simultaneous loss of proteins, vitamins, and minerals (3.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). Attempts to increase the content of valuable nutrients (e.g.proteins) in cassava tubers by breeding will thus be in vain because the components most likely will be lost during processing. The presence of cyanogenic glucosides thus constitutes a major obstacle for food quality improvement in cassava. Attempts to eliminate the production of cyanogenic glucosides in cassava through traditional breeding have not been successful. An alternative approach would be to use antisense technology, which, however, requires knowledge of the biosynthetic pathway and the enzymes involved and identification of the relevant genes. The biosynthesis of the l-tyrosine-derived cyanogenic glucoside dhurrin has been elucidated in sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench). The pathway involves anN-hydroxyamino acid, anN,N-dihydroxyamino acid, an E- andZ-oxime, a nitrile, and a cyanohydrin as intermediates (9.McFarlane I.J. Lees E.M. Conn E.E. J. Biol.

Møller B.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). In sorghum, a multifunctional cytochrome P-450 (P-450)1 enzyme (CYP79A1) catalyzes the conversion from amino acid to Z-oxime and a second multifunctional P-450 (CYP71E1) catalyzes the conversion fromZ-oxime to cyanohydrin. Final conversion of the cyanohydrin to dhurrin is achieved by the action of a soluble uridine 5′-diphosphoglucose-glucosyl transferase (13.Jones P.R. Møller B.L. Høj P.B. J. Biol.

In the present study, we have used a range of inhibitors to document that the initial steps in cyanogenic glucoside synthesis in cassava are catalyzed by P-450. Using PCR strategies, we have cloned two P-450 genes belonging to the CYP79 family. Southern blot analyses did not reveal additional gene copies. Heterologous expression in Pichia pastoris documented that both P-450s catalyze the conversion ofl-valine as well as l-isoleucine to the corresponding oximes, i.e. the first committed steps in the biosynthesis of linamarin and lotaustralin. The enzyme was isolated from P. pastoris and characterized with respect to substrate specificity. The cloning of the two genes provides the necessary tools to construct acyanogenic cassava plants using antisense technology. Cassava (M. esculenta Crantz) was grown in a greenhouse at regimes of 14 h of light at 28 °C and 10 h of darkness at 25 °C. Microsomes were prepared from immature folded leaves and petioles of shoot tips by differential centrifugation (12.Koch B. Nielsen V.S. Halkier B.A. Olsen C.E. Møller B.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The resulting microsomal pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose, 100 mmTricine, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and stored at −80 °C. Immediately before use, microsomes were thawed on ice. Biosynthetic activity of the cassava microsomes was determined in assay mixtures (total volume, 30 μl) containing 55 μg of microsomal protein, 1 mm NADPH, 0.35 μCi of [U-14C]l-valine (246 mCi/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 3.3 mm val-oxime, and 67 mmTricine, pH 7.9. After incubation (30 min at 30 °C), each assay mixture was extracted with 60 μl of ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate phase containing the val-oxime was applied to a TLC sheet (Silica Gel 60 F254, Merck) and eluted in dichloromethane/ethyl acetate (85:15, v/v). 14C-Labeled val-oxime formed was detected and quantified using a STORM 840 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Reactions were also performed in the presence of the P-450 inhibitors ABT or tetcyclasis and in the presence of the flavoprotein inhibitor DPI. The inhibitors were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide before inclusion in the reaction mixtures. The maximum content of dimethyl sulfoxide in the reaction mixtures was 6.7% and was shown in control experiments not to inhibit the biosynthetic activity. The direct effect of DPI and tetcyclasis on purified sorghum NADPH-P-450 oxidoreductase was measured (550 nm) as the inhibition of NADPH-P-450 oxidoreductase (0.01 unit) catalyzed NADPH-dependent reduction of cytochrome c (25.Benveniste I. Gabriac B. Durst F. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The metabolism of l- and d-amino acids by cassava microsomes was determined in assay mixtures (total volume, 200 μl) containing microsomal protein (20–100 μg), 6 mmsubstrate (l-Val, d-Val, l-Ile, ord-Ile), 1.5 mm NADPH, 50 mmTricine, pH 7.9. The reaction mixtures were incubated in silicone septum-covered Eppendorf tubes for 30 min at 30 °C and stopped by injection of 40 μl of 6 m NaOH. The end product cyanide was determined colorimetrically as described previously (26.Halkier B.A. Møller B.L. Plant Physiol. 1989; 90: 1552-1559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). First round PCR amplification reactions (total volume, 20 μl) were carried out in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 9, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2 using 0.5 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) 200 μm dATP, 200 μm dCTP, 200 μm dGTP, 200 μmdTTP, 500 nm of each of the primers 5′-GCGGAATTCARGGIAAYCCIYTICT and 5′-CGCGGATCCGGDATRTCIGAYTCYTG (where R = A or G; Y = C or T; I = inosine; and D = A, G or T), and 10 ng of plasmid DNA template. The plasmid DNA template was prepared from a unidirectional plasmid cDNA library in pcDNA2.1 (Invitrogen) made from immature folded leaves and petioles of shoot tips of cassava plants. Thermal cycling parameters were 95 °C for 2 min, 3× (95 °C for 5 s, 40 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s), 32× (95 °C for 5 s, 50 °C for 5 s, and 72 °C for 45 s), and a final 72 °C for 5 min. A part of the band of the expected size (210 base pairs) was stabbed out with a Pasteur pipette and used for second round PCR amplifications in 50 μl of the same reaction mixture as above using 95 °C for 2 min, 20× (95 °C for 5 s, 50 °C for 5 s, and 72 °C for 45 s) and a final 72 °C for 5 min. The product was sequenced with the Thermo Sequenase radiolabeled terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and [α-33P]ddNTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer. The gene-specific fragment was labeled with digoxigenin-11-dUTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) by PCR amplification and used as probe to screen the cassava cDNA library using the DIG system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The probe was hybridized over night at 68 °C in 5× SSC, 0.1% N-lauroylsarcosine, 0.02% SDS, 1% blocking reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Prior to detection, filters were washed with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. Sequencing was performed using Thermo Sequenase Fluorescent-labeled Primer cycle sequencing kit (7-deaza dGTP) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and an ALF-Express sequenator (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Two full-length clones designated CYP79D1 and CYP79D2were obtained. Sequence computer analysis was performed using the programs from the GCG Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package. Genomic DNA was purified (27.Chen J. Dellaporta S. Freeling M. Walbot V. The Maize Handbook. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1994Google Scholar) from leaves of cassava cultivar MCol22. The DNA was further purified on Genomic-tip 100/G (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), digested with restriction enzymes and electrophoresed (10 μg of DNA/lane) on a 0.6% agarose gel in 1× TAE. The gel was blotted to a nylon membrane (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and hybridized at 68 °C (28.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.31-9.62Google Scholar) with the radiolabeledCYP79D1 or CYP79D2 clone. After hybridization, the membrane was washed twice in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature and twice in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 68 °C, and radiolabeled bands were visualized using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The probes for Southern hybridization were labeled with a Random Primed DNA Labeling Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using [α-32P]dCTP. The vector pPICZc (Invitrogen) containing the methanol-inducible AOX1 promoter for control of gene expression and encoding resistance against zeocin was used to achieve intracellular expression of heterologous genes in P. pastoris wild type strain X-33 (Invitrogen). E. coli strain TOP10F′ was used for transformation and propagation of recombinant plasmids. An XhoI site was introduced immediately downstream of theCYP79D1 stop codon by PCR. The PCR product was restricted with XhoI and with BsmBI. The latter enzyme cuts 18 base pairs downstream of the start ATG codon. pPICZc was restricted with BstBI and XhoI. The vector and PCR product were ligated together using an adapter made from annealed oligos: 5′-CGAAACGATGGCTATGAACGTCTCT-3′ (sense direction) and 5′-TGGTAGAGACGTTCATAGCCATCGTTT-3′. The adapter reconstructs the first 18 base pairs of CYP79D1(start codon underlined) introducing two silent mutations (double underlined) and reconstructs a short vector sequence removed by theBstBI restriction, thereby positioning theCYP79D1 start codon exactly as the start codon of the highly expressed AOX1 gene product. CYP79D2 was cloned into pPICZc in a similar manner using the same adapter because the coding sequences of CYP79D1 and CYP79D2 genes are identical for the first 24 base pairs. Transformation of P. pastoris was achieved by electroporation according to manual (EasySelect Pichiaexpression Kit Version A, Invitrogen). The presence ofCYP79D1 or CYP79D2 in zeocin-resistant colonies was confirmed by PCR on the P. pastoris colonies. Single colonies of P. pastoris were grown (28 °C, 220 rpm) for approximately 22 h in 25 ml of BMGY (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 0.1 m KPi, pH 6.0, 1.34% yeast nitrogen base, 4 × 10−5% biotin, 1% glycerol, 100 μg/ml zeocin). Cells were harvested (1500 ×g for 10 min at room temperature) and inoculated to OD 0.5 in 300 ml of inducing medium (BMGY with 1% methanol instead of glycerol) in a 2-liter baffled flask. The cultures were grown (28 °C, 300 rpm) for 28 h with addition of methanol to 0.5% after 26 h. Cells were pelleted (3000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C) and washed once in buffer A (50 mmKPi, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) before being resuspended to OD 130 in buffer A. An equal volume of acid-washed glass beads was added, and the cells were broken by vortexing (8 × 30 s at 4 °C with intermediate cooling on ice). The lysate was centrifuged (12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C) to remove cell debris, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged (165,000 × g for1 h at 4 °C) to recover a microsomal pellet. Microsomes were resuspended in buffer A, stored at −80 °C, and thawed on ice immediately before use. All steps were carried out at 4 °C unless otherwise stated. CYP79D1-containing fractions were identified by carbon monoxide difference spectroscopy, SDS-PAGE, and activity measurements. Recombinant CYP79D1 was isolated using P. pastorismicrosomes as the starting material and TX-114 phase partitioning (29.Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,30.Werck-Reichhart D. Benveniste I. Teutsch H. Durst F. Gabriac B. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 197: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) as the first purification step. The phase partitioning mixture contained microsomal protein (4 mg/ml), 50 mmKPi, pH 7.9, 1 mm DTT, 30% glycerol, and 1% TX-114. After stirring (at 4 °C for 30 min), phase separation was achieved by temperature shift and centrifugation (24500 ×g at 22 °C for 25 min with the brake off). The reddish TX-114-rich upper phase was collected, and the TX-114-poor lower phase was re-extracted with 1% TX-114. The rich phases were combined and diluted in buffer B (10 mm KPi, pH 7.9, 2 mm DTT) to a TX-114 concentration less than 0.2%. The TX-114-rich phase was applied (flow rate, 25 ml/h) to a column (2.6 × 2.8 cm) of DEAE-Sepharose FF (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) connected in series to a column (1.6 × 3 cm) of Reactive Red 120 agarose (Sigma). Both columns were equilibrated in buffer C (10 mm KPi, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 0.2% TX-114, 2 mm DTT). After sample application, the columns were washed thoroughly overnight in buffer C. CYP79D1 does not bind to the ion exchange column under these conditions and was recovered from the Reactive Red 120 agarose by gradient elution (50 ml of 0–1.5m KCl in buffer C). Fractions containing fairly pure CYP79D1 were combined, dialyzed over night against buffer C, and applied to a column (1.6 × 2.2 cm) of Reactive Yellow 3A agarose (Sigma) equilibrated in buffer C. The column was washed using buffer C and CYP79D1 obtained by gradient elution (50 ml of 0–1.5 mKCl in buffer C). The fractions containing homogenous CYP79D1 were combined and dialyzed (2 h) against buffer D (10 mmKPi, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT) to reduce the salt and detergent content. CYP79D1 was stored in aliquots at −80 °C. NADPH-P-450 oxidoreductase was purified from microsomes of etiolated sorghum (S. bicolor (L.) Moench) seedlings using DEAE and 2′,5′-ADP Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column chromatography (31.Halkier B.A. Møller B.L. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 32.Sibbesen O. Koch B. Halkier B.A. Møller B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3506-3511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). CYP79D1 was subjected to SDS-PAGE and the protein transferred to ProBlott membranes (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as described previously (33.Kahn R.A. Bak S. Olsen C.E. Svendsen I. Møller B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32944-32950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained proteins were excised from the membrane and subjected to sequencing on an Applied Biosystems model 470A sequenator equipped with an on-line model 120A phenylthiohydantoin amino acid analyzer. Asn glycosylation was detected as the lack of an Asn signal in the predicted Edman degradation cycle. Isolated, recombinant CYP79D1 was reconstituted, and its catalytic activity was determined in vitro using reaction mixtures (total volume, 30 μl) containing 2.5 pmol of CYP79D1, 0.05 unit of NADPH P-450-oxidoreductase (25.Benveniste I. Gabriac B. Durst F. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), 10.6 mml-α-dioleyl phosphatidylcholine, 0.35 μCi of U-14C-labeled l-amino acid (l-Val, -Ile, -Leu, -Tyr or -Phe; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 1 mmNADPH, 0.1 m NaCl, and 20 mm KPi, pH 7.9. In assays containing [14C]l-valine or [14C]l-isoleucine, different amounts of unlabeled l- and d-amino acids (0–6 mm) were added. After incubation (10 min at 30 °C), the products formed were extracted into ethyl acetate (60 μl) and separated on TLC sheets using n-pentane/diethyl ether (50:50, v/v) or toluene/ethyl acetate (5:1, v/v) as eluents for aliphatic compounds and aromatic compounds, respectively.14C-Labeled oximes were visualized and quantified using a STORM 840 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The activity of CYP79D1 was also measured in the presence of the inhibitors tetcyclasis, ABT and DPI, under the same conditions as described in the previous section. For in vivo activity assays, P. pastoris cells (200 μl) were pelleted and resuspended in 100 μl of 50 mm Tricine, pH 7.9, and 0.35 μCi of [U-14C]l-valine or l-isoleucine. After incubation (30 min at 30 °C), the cells were extracted with ethyl acetate, and the products formed were analyzed as above. SDS-PAGE was performed using high Tris linear 8–25% gradient gels (34.Fling S.P. Gregerson D.S. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). Total P-450 was quantified by carbon monoxide difference spectroscopy on a SLM Aminco DW-2000 TM spectrophotometer (Spectronic Instruments, Rochester, NY) using a molar extinction coefficient of 91 mm−1 cm−1 for the adduct between reduced P-450 and carbon monoxide (35.Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Substrate-binding spectra were recorded according to the method of Jefcoate (36.Jefcoate C.R. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 27: 258-279Crossref Scopus (392) Google Scholar) in 50 mmKPi, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl. Microsomes prepared from immature folded leaves and petioles of shoot tips from 3–6-month-old cassava plants convertedl-valine to val-oxime (Fig.2 A, lane 2). Microsomes prepared from mature cassava leaves showed barely detectable activity levels. The conversion of amino acids to oxime compounds has been suggested to involve three different enzyme systems: P-450s (19.Du L. Lykkesfeldt J. Olsen C.E. Halkier B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12505-12509Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar,20.Bak S. Nielsen H.L. Halkier B.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), flavin-containing monooxygenases (21.Bennett R.N. Kiddle G. Hick A.J. Dawson G.W. Wallsgrove R.M. Plant Cell Environ. 1996; 19: 801-812Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and peroxidases (22.Bennett R. Ludwig-Müller J. Kiddle G. Hilgenberg W. Wallsgrove R. Planta. 1995; 196: 239-244Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To determine which enzyme was involved in cassava, ABT and tetcyclasis were tested as inhibitors of P-450 enzymes, and DPI was tested as an inhibitor of the putative flavin-containing monooxygenase. A major argument for the involvement of a flavin-containing monooxygenase has been the observed inhibitory effect caused by the flavin protein inhibitor DPI (21.Bennett R.N. Kiddle G. Hick A.J. Dawson G.W. Wallsgrove R.M. Plant Cell Environ. 1996; 19: 801-812Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The production of val-oxime by the cassava microsomes was indeed completely inhibited by DPI (Fig. 2 A,lanes 7 and 8). However, as an inhibitor of flavin-containing enzymes DPI may also inhibit the P-450-NADPH oxidoreductase. The inhibitory effect of DPI on NADPH-P-450 oxidoreductase was measured in a cytochrome c reductase assay (25.Benveniste I. Gabriac B. Durst F. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) using NADPH-P-450 oxidoreductase purified from sorghum. The NADPH-P-450 oxidoreductase was found to be completely inhibited (data not shown), suggesting that DPI interferes with thel-valine to val-oxime conversion by inhibiting NADPH-P-450 oxidoreductase. The conversion of l-valine to val-oxime was inhibited by tetcyclasis, which strongly argues for the involvement of a P-450 enzyme (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3 and4). The NADPH-P-450 oxidoreductase was fully active in the presence of tetcyclasis (data not shown). ABT did not inhibit the reaction (Fig. 2 A, lanes 5 and 6). ABT is not a universal P-450 inhibitor (37.Xu D. Voigt J.M. Mico B.A. Kominami S. Takemori S. Colby H.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 1421-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 38.Colby H.D. Abbott B. Cachovic M. Debolt K.M. Mico B.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 49: 1057-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and the lack of inhibition is therefore not necessarily in conflict with a P-450 catalyzed reaction. The l-valine to val-oxime conversion is dependent on NADPH (Fig. 2 A, lane 1) as required for a P-450 catalyzed reaction. The overall conclusion from the inhibitor studies is that the l-valine to val-oxime conversion in cassava is a P-450-catalyzed reaction. Based on the assumption that the P-450 catalyzing conversion of l-valine to val-oxime belongs to the CYP79 family, degenerate primers were designed toward areas showing sequence conservation in CYP79A1 (sorghum) (15.Koch B.M. Sibbesen O. Halkier B.A. Svendsen I. Møller B.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), CYP79B1 (Sinapis alba) (20.Bak S. Nielsen H.L. Halkier B.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and CYP79B2 (Arabidopsis thaliana) (20.Bak S. Nielsen H.L. Halkier B.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Domains putatively involved in substrate recognition (39.Gotoh O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 83-90Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were excluded for primer designation, because none of the known CYP79s utilize valine or isoleucine as substrate. PCR was performed with the degenerate primers on plasmid DNA from a cDNA library prepared from immature folded leaves and petioles from shoot tips of cassava plants. PCR using the conserved areas shown by arrows in Fig.3 was successful and provided a cassava sequence with high sequence similarity to the CYP79 family. Using this probe, two equally abundant full-length clones were isolated from the cassava cDNA library. The clones have open reading frames encoding P-450s of 61.2 and 61.3 kDa. These P-450s have been assigned CYP79D1 and CYP79D2 as the first two members of a new CYP79D subfamily (Dr. Nelson, P-450 Nomenclature Committee; Ref. 40.Nelson D.R. Koymans L. Kamataki T.

However, the causal mechanisms remain to be clarified. We reported here that vitamin A (retinol) and its derivative (retinal) caused cellular DNA cleavage detected by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. Retinol and retinal significantly induced 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-deoxyguanosine formation in HL-60 cells but not in H2O2-resistant HP100 cells, suggesting the involvement of H2O2 in cellular DNA damage. Experiments using 32P-labeled isolated DNA demonstrated that retinol and retinal caused Cu(II)-mediated DNA damage, which was inhibited by catalase. UV-visible spectroscopic and electron spin resonance-trapping studies revealed the generation of superoxide and carbon-centered radicals, respectively. The superoxide generation during autoxidation of retinoids was significantly correlated with the formation of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-deoxyguanosine, although the yield of carbon-centered radicals was not necessarily related to the intensity of DNA damage. These findings suggest that superoxide generated by autoxidation of retinoids was dismutated to H2O2, which was responsible for DNA damage in the presence of endogenous metals. Retinol and retinal have prooxidant abilities, which might lead to carcinogenesis of the supplements of β-carotene.

After following up for several years, surprisingly, higher incidences of lung cancer were observed in the intervention groups than the placebo groups. The CARET researchers have suggested that β-carotene can function as a prooxidant under the free-radical-rich atmosphere produced by the chemicals in cigarette smoke and the resultant inflammatory response in the lung (6.Omenn G.S.

Therefore, the causal mechanisms should be elucidated to establish safe approaches in cancer chemoprevention. Every antioxidant, including vitamin antioxidants, is in fact a redox (reduction-oxidation) agent, protecting against free radicals in some circumstances and promoting free radical generation in others (12.Herbert V. J. Nutr. 1996; 126 (suppl.): 1197-1200Crossref Google Scholar). Several studies have revealed prooxidant effects of vitamin E (13.Burkitt M.J. Milne L.

Although vitamin A is a good acceptor and donor of electrons in chemical reactions, its properties appear to be very carefully protected by retinol-binding proteins and other endogenous antioxidants in vivo (24.Olson J.A. J. Nutr. 1996; 126 (suppl.): 1208-1212Crossref Google Scholar). However, pharmacological amounts of the supplements above physiological amounts may perturb key physiological processes. We report here that low concentrations of vitamin A (retinol) and its derivative (retinal; vitamin A aldehyde) caused cellular DNA cleavage. Furthermore, induction of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG)1 by retinol and retinal was investigated in HL-60 cells and its H2O2-resistant clone HP100 cells. To clarify the mechanism of DNA damage, we performed experiments using32P-labeled DNA isolated from the human p53tumor suppressor gene and c-Ha-ras-1 protooncogene. In addition, the time course of 8-oxodG formation was measured by HPLC-ECD, and the reactive species was also detected using UV-visible and ESR spectroscopies.

Ethanol, d-mannitol, and sodium formate were from Nakalai Tesque Inc. (Kyoto, Japan). Ethanol solutions of retinol and retinal were made freshly each time. HL-60 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 6% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Then the cells were washed, resuspended in 10 ml of RPMI 1640 containing 6% fetal bovine serum (1 × 106 cells/ml), and incubated with retinoid, which was dissolved in ethanol (final concentration of ethanol, 0.05%) at 37 °C for the indicated duration. Control conditions also contained 0.05% ethanol. After incubation, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. The cell suspension was solidified with agarose, followed by treatment with proteinase K according to the method described previously (25.Ito K. Yamamoto K. Kawanishi S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11606-11613Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis was performed in 0.5 × TBE buffer (45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0)) by a CHEF-Mapper pulsed field electrophoresis system (Bio-Rad) at 200 V at 14 °C. Switch time was 60 s for 15 h followed by 90 s switch time for 9 h. The DNA in the gel was visualized using ethidium bromide. HP100 cells have been derived from HL-60 cells by repeated exposure to H2O2 followed by outgrowth of viable cells and are approximately 340-fold more resistant to H2O2 than HL-60 cells (26.Kasugai I. Yamada M. Leuk. Res. 1992; 16: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 27.Tada-Oikawa S. Oikawa S. Kawanishi M. Yamada M. Kawanishi S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). HL-60 and HP100 cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated with retinoids in 5 ml of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 6% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C. After the incubation, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were suspended in 0.05 mg/ml RNase A, 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K, and 500 μl of DNA extractor and incubated for 60 min at 60 °C. After ethanol precipitation, DNA was digested to nucleosides with nuclease P1 and bacterial alkaline phosphatase and analyzed by HPLC-ECD, as described previously (28.Ito K. Inoue S. Yamamoto K. Kawanishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13221-13227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Murata M. Moriya K. Inoue S. Kawanishi S. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 851-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). DNA fragments were obtained from the humanp53 tumor suppressor gene. 2P. Chumakov, EMBL data library, accession numberX54156. Fragments from thep53 gene containing exons were prepared as described previously (31.Yamashita N. Murata M. Inoue S. Hiraku Y. Yoshinaga T. Kawanishi S. Mutat. Res. 1998; 397: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The 5′-end-labeled 470-bp fragment (HindIII* 13038-EcoRI* 13507) was obtained by dephosphorylation with calf intestine phosphatase and rephosphorylation with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (the asterisk indicates 32P-labeled). The 470-bp fragment was further digested with StyI to obtain the singly labeled 118-bp fragment (HindIII* 13038-StyI 13155), as described previously (31.Yamashita N. Murata M. Inoue S. Hiraku Y. Yoshinaga T. Kawanishi S. Mutat. Res. 1998; 397: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). A DNA fragment was also obtained from the human c-Ha-ras-1 protooncogene (32.Capon D.J. Chen E.Y. Levinson A.D. Seeburg P.H. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1983; 302: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). A DNA fragment was prepared from plasmid pbcNI, which carries a 6.6-kilobase BamHI chromosomal DNA segment containing the c-Ha-ras-1 gene, and the singly labeled 337-bp fragment (PstI 2345-AvaI* 2681) was obtained according to the method described previously (33.Yamamoto K. Kawanishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15435-15440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nucleotide numbering starts with the BamHI site (32.Capon D.J. Chen E.Y. Levinson A.D. Seeburg P.H. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1983; 302: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture (in a microtube, 1.5 ml) contained retinoid, CuCl2 (or FeCl3, FeSO4, MnCl2),32P-5′-end-labeled DNA fragments and sonicated calf thymus DNA in 200 μl of 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) containing 2.5 μm DTPA. DTPA was added to remove metal ions, which may have been contained in the phosphate buffer. After incubation at 37 °C for the indicated durations, the DNA fragments were heated at 90 °C in 1 m piperidine for 20 min where indicated. The preferred cleavage sites were determined by direct comparison of the positions of the oligonucleotides with those produced by the chemical reactions of the Maxam-Gilbert procedure (34.Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9015) Google Scholar) using a DNA-sequencing system (LKB 2010 Macrophor). The relative amounts of oligonucleotides from the treated DNA fragments were measured with a laser densitometer (LKB 2222 UltroScan XL). Calf thymus DNA fragments were incubated with retinoid in the presence of CuCl2 for the indicated duration at 37 °C. DNA fragments were denatured at 90 °C for 5 min and quickly chilled before incubation, where indicated. After ethanol precipitation, DNA was digested to the nucleosides using nuclease P1 and calf intestine phosphatase and analyzed by HPLC-ECD, as described previously (28.Ito K. Inoue S. Yamamoto K. Kawanishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13221-13227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To detect O⨪2 generation, cytochromec was added to the reaction mixture, which contained retinoid in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) containing 2.5 μm DTPA. A maximum absorption at 550 nm due to ferrocytochrome c formed by ferricytochromec reduction was measured with a UV-visible spectrophotometer after incubation at 37 °C for indicated duration. A low estimate of O⨪2 was calculated by subtracting absorbance with SOD from that without SOD at 550 nm (ε = 21.1 × 103m−1 cm−1). The generation of radicals in the reaction system of retinol or retinal was detected using a trapping agent POBN with ESR spectroscopy (JEOL model JES-TE100) in a 100-kHz field modulation at room temperature. Spectra were recorded with a microwave power of 8 mW, a modulation width of 0.1 mT, and a receiver amplitude of 200. DNA strand breakage in cultured HL-60 cells treated with retinoids was detected by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1). Both retinol and retinal induced weak DNA strand breakage to produce 1000–2000-kilobase fragments at 1 μm and apparent breakage at 2 μm and 5 μm. Formation of 200–300-kilobase fragments increased in cells treated with 5 μm retinal but not retinol. This indicates that retinal has a stronger ability to damage DNA than retinol. As shown in Fig. 2, formation of 8-oxodG in HL-60 cells treated with 2–5 μm of retinoids was significantly higher than that of the control. The content of 8-oxodG induced by retinal was significantly higher than that of retinol at 2 and 5 μm. However, no significant increase in 8-oxodG was observed in H2O2-resistant HP100 cells treated with retinoids (data not shown). These findings suggest that the generation of H2O2 plays a critical role in oxidative DNA damage by retinol and retinal. Both retinol and retinal caused DNA damage in the presence of Cu(II), although retinoids alone did not (Fig.3). The intensity of DNA damage increased depending on increasing concentrations of retinol and retinal (data not shown). Although the DNA damage also increased depending on incubation time, retinal caused DNA damage more efficiently than retinol after a 6-h incubation. Retinol and retinal did not cause DNA damage in the presence of other transition metals (Mn(II), Fe(II), or Fe(III)) (data not shown). Fig. 4 shows the effects of radical scavengers and a Cu(I)-specific chelator bathocuproine on retinol-induced DNA damage. Typical free hydroxyl radical (·OH) scavengers such as mannitol, sodium formate, and dimethyl sulfoxide showed little or no inhibitory effect on the DNA damage. However, the DNA damage was inhibited by methional, which can scavenge not only free ·OH but also other radicals like cryptohydroxyl radicals (35.Pryor W.A. Tang R.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 81: 498-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). SOD had little inhibitory effect on DNA damage. Catalase and bathocuproine completely inhibited Cu(II)-mediated DNA damage induced by retinol, suggesting that H2O2 and Cu(I) were required for the DNA damage. The similar effects of scavengers were observed in the case of retinal-induced DNA damage. To examine the DNA damage site, 32P-5′-end-labeled DNA fragments treated with retinol plus Cu(II) followed by piperidine treatment were electrophoresed. An autoradiogram was obtained and scanned with a laser densitometer to measure the relative intensity of DNA damage in the human p53 gene and the c-Ha-ras-1 protooncogene as shown in Fig. 5. Retinol and Cu(II) strongly generated piperidine-labile sites at cytosine and thymine residues, especially at the cytosine residues in CC sequences of double-stranded DNA from the p53 tumor suppressor gene (Fig.5 A). Retinol caused Cu(II)-dependent DNA cleavage at thymine residues in fragments from the c-Ha-ras-1 protooncogene (Fig. 5 B). Also, the similar patterns were obtained with retinal (data not shown). We measured the time course of 8-oxodG formation in calf thymus DNA incubated with retinoids in the presence of Cu(II) (Fig. 6). Within 2 h, the content of 8-oxodG formation by retinol was higher than that by retinal. No difference between retinol and retinal in 8-oxodG contents was observed at 3 h. After a 6-h incubation, 8-oxodG formation by retinal was higher than that by retinol. Using the cytochrome c reduction method, O⨪2 generated during the autoxidation of retinoids was detected. Within a 2-h incubation, the O⨪2 yield by retinol was higher than that by retinal. The yield of O⨪2 was very similar between retinol and retinal at 3 h. After a 6-h incubation, the O⨪2 yield by retinal was higher than that by retinol (Fig.7). ESR spectroscopic measurement with a trapping agent POBN detected retinoid-derived radicals with six-line signals (Fig.8). The hyperfine splitting constants of the radical derived were aN = 1.56 mT, aH = 0.27 mT for retinol, and aN = 1.56 mT, aH = 0.25 mT for retinal. These radicals were both assigned as carbon-centered radicals by reference to the reported hyperfine splitting constants (36.Buettner G.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1987; 3: 259-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1555) Google Scholar). Retinol-derived radicals could be detected immediately after mixture, whereas retinal-derived radicals were detected only after the longer incubation. After a 6-h incubation, the radical signals from retinol were much larger than those from retinal. Under anaerobic conditions, the POBN-trapping radicals were much less accumulated (data not shown). We report here that both retinol and retinal caused oxidative damage to cellular and isolated DNA. Retinoids significantly induced 8-oxodG formation in HL-60 cells but did not significantly increase 8-oxodG in H2O2-resistant HP100 cells. It is suggested that the generation of H2O2 plays a critical role in oxidative DNA damage by retinol and retinal. When the isolated DNA was used, the existence of Cu(II) was required for the DNA damage. Copper exists in the nucleus and is closely associated with chromosomes and DNA bases in vivo (37.Burkitt M.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 234: 66-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In cell-free systems, catalase and bathocuproine inhibited Cu(II)-mediated DNA damage, suggesting that H2O2 reacts with Cu(I) to produce active species causing DNA damage. DNA-bound Cu(II) can undergo Cu(II)/Cu(I) redox cycling; also, O2 is reduced to O⨪2, which is dismutated to H2O2,resulting in the DNA-Cu(I)-H2O2 complex (33.Yamamoto K. Kawanishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15435-15440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Typical free ·OH scavengers showed little or no inhibitory effect on the DNA damage. Therefore, it is considered that the DNA damage is caused by a reactive oxygen species such as Cu(I)OOH rather than free ·OH. Site-specific DNA cleavage supports this hypothesis, because it is known that free ·OH causes DNA damage without site specificity (38.Celander D.W. Cech T.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1355-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Thus, it is speculated that H2O2 reacts with endogenous metals to form a metal-oxygen complex causing oxidative DNA damage in vivo. ESR spectroscopic studies using a trapping agent POBN have demonstrated retinol- and retinal-derived radicals with six-line signals, assigned as carbon-centered radicals. Retinoic acid was shown to be oxidized to 5,6-epoxyretinoic acid via formation of carbon-centered radicals (aH = 0.27 mT, aN = 1.55 mT) trapped by POBN (39.Freyaldenhoven M.A. Lehman P.A. Franz T.J. Lloyd R.V. Samokyszyn V.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1998; 11: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In addition, Tesoriere et al. (40.Tesoriere L. D'Arpa D. Re R. Livrea M.A. Archv. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 343: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) suggest that retinol reacts with radical addition to the cyclohexenyl ring and was further oxidized to 5,6-epoxyretinol. These carbon-centered radicals from retinol and retinal do not appear to be the main species to react with DNA, because neither retinol nor retinal caused DNA damage even though it was detected using the ESR spin-trapping method when Cu(II) was omitted. Using the cytochrome c reduction method, generation of O⨪2 derived from the autoxidation of retinoids was detected. Within a 2-h incubation, higher generation of O⨪2from retinol was observed than that from retinal, and the yield became very similar at 3-h. After a 6-h incubation, O⨪2 from retinal was higher than that from retinol. The generation of O⨪2 was significantly correlated with 8-oxodG formation (r = 0.9824, p < 0.0001). Therefore, it is concluded that the DNA damage observed here occurs through the generation of O⨪2 rather than carbon-centered radicals, although the radicals may participate in the generation of O⨪2. Halliwell (41.Halliwell B. Mutat. Res. 1999; 443: 37-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) indicated that so-called “antioxidants” act as antioxidants in some circumstances but also act as prooxidants in other circumstances. Palozza et al. (21.Palozza P. Luberto C. Calviello G. Ricci P. Bartoli G.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 1065-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) report that β-carotene at high oxygen partial pressure lost its antioxidant activity in normal cells and exhibited a prooxidant effect in tumor cells. Caffeic acid, which has antioxidant properties and carcinogenicity, inhibited oxidative DNA damage, whereas caffeic acid by itself caused oxidative DNA damage at certain concentrations (42.Inoue S. Ito K. Yamamoto K. Kawanishi S. Carcinogenesis. 1992; 13: 1497-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Such antioxidant compounds like caffeic acid may have the dual function of carcinogenic and anticarcinogenic potentials. If antioxidants have a prooxidant property, they may have carcinogenic effects. Similarly, it was reported, using a simplified in vitro model, that an antioxidant vitamin E (α-tocopherol) can act as a potent oxidative DNA-damaging agent in the presence of Cu(II) (14.Yamashita N. Murata M. Inoue S. Burkitt M.J. Milne L. Kawanishi S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1998; 11: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Virtually all putative chemopreventive antioxidants may have potential carcinogenicity (18.Oikawa S. Yamada K. Yamashita N. Tada-Oikawa S. Kawanishi S. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 1485-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 20.Yamashita N. Tanemura H. Kawanishi S. Mutat. Res. 1999; 425: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy to find that the addition of such low doses of retinoids can induce cellular DNA damage. β-Carotene is converted to two molecules of retinal principally by central cleavage. Retinal is further oxidized to retinoic acid or reduced to retinol. We confirmed using isolated DNA that other derivatives of vitamin A such as retinoic acid and β-ionone and β-carotene itself induced slight DNA damage, including 8-oxodG in the presence of Cu(II), but not efficiently in comparison with retinol and retinal (data not shown). If excessive intake or supplements of vitamin A and β-carotene saturate binding protein, free compounds may have cytotoxicity. This has been suggested by several studies (43 44). Excess amounts of vitamin A increased chromosomal aberration in a lymphocyte culture system (43.Badr F.M. El-Habit O.H.M. Hamdy M. Hassan G.A.R. Mutat. Res. 1998; 414: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Rats treated with retinol had increased incidence of pheochromocytomas in a dose-related manner (44.Kurokawa Y. Hayashi Y. Maekawa A. Takahashi M. Kukubo T. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1985; 74: 715-723PubMed Google Scholar). The supplements of β-carotene and retinol resulted in higher incidences of lung cancer in the intervention groups (4.The α-tocopherol, β-carotene cancer prevention study groupN. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 330: 1029-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (4437) Google Scholar, 5.Omenn G.S. Goodman G.E. Thornquist M.D. Balmes J. Cullen M.R. Glass A. Keogh J.P. Meyskens F.L. Valanis B. Williams J.H. Barnhart S. Hammar S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 1150-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (3136) Google Scholar). It is known that reactive oxygen species are related to tumor-promoting potencies (45.Giri U. Iqbal M. Athar M. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 2023-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 46.Kensler T. Guyton K. Egner P. McCarthy T. Lesko S. Akman S. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1995; 391: 103-116PubMed Google Scholar). Reid and Loeb (30.Reid T.M. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3904-3907Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) indicated that oxidative stress caused tandem double CC → TT mutations. It is very interesting that retinoids strongly generated piperidine-labile sites at the CC sequences in the p53 tumor suppressor gene observed in our study with 32P-labeled DNA fragment. On the basis of the finding that excessive retinol and retinal induced oxidative DNA damage via O⨪2 generation, it is suggested that the oxidative DNA damage may be responsible for initiation and/or tumor promotion/progression in multistage carcinogenesis. Retinol and retinal, β-carotene metabolites, have a stronger ability to induce DNA damage and to generate O⨪2 than β-carotene itself. Therefore, it is suggested that both retinol and retinal play important roles in carcinogenesis in the intervention studies using excess amounts of β-carotene. Further studies will be required for evaluation of safety and efficacy before recommending use of retinoid supplements for cancer chemoprevention."

Smad4, previously identified as the tumor suppressorDPC4, is functionally distinct among the Smad family, and is required for the assembly and transcriptional activation of diverse, Smad-DNA complexes. We previously identified a 48-amino acid proline-rich regulatory element within the middle linker domain of this molecule, the Smad4 activation domain (SAD), which is essential for mediating these signaling activities. We now characterize the functional activity of the SAD. Mutants lacking the SAD are still able to form complexes with other Smad family members and associated transcription factors, but cannot activate transcription in these complexes. Furthermore, the SAD itself is able to activate transcription in heterologous reporter assays, identifying it as a proline-rich transcriptional activation domain, and indicating that the SAD is both necessary and sufficient to activate Smad-dependent transcriptional responses. We show that transcriptional activation by the SAD is p300-dependent, and demonstrate that this activity is associated with a physical interaction of the SAD with the amino terminus of p300. These data identify a novel function of the middle linker region of Smad4, and define the role of the SAD as an important locus determining the transcriptional activation of the Smad complex.

These ligands initiate cellular signals by associating with two classes of interacting transmembrane receptor serine-threonine kinases. Ligand binding to the type II receptor results in recruitment and transphosphorylation of type I receptors, which then signal downstream responses (1.Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3972) Google Scholar). Clues as to the mechanisms regulating downstream signaling responses have been provided by the discovery of Smad proteins as direct substrates of the TGF-β family of receptor kinases, and mediators of signals from the receptors to the nucleus. Receptor-activated Smads (R-Smads) interact transiently with specific, ligand-activated type I receptors and are phosphorylated on highly conserved carboxyl-terminal (COOH-terminal)-SS(V/M)S motifs. Smad2 and Smad3 are specific mediators of TGF-β and activin signaling pathways, while Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 are involved in bone morphogenetic protein responses (1.Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3972) Google Scholar). Following receptor activation, these Smad proteins translocate to the nucleus where they function as transcriptional regulators (2.Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Cell. 1998; 95: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). Smads have a domain structure consisting of highly conserved amino (NH2)- and (COOH)-terminal regions, referred to as Mad homology 1 (MH1) and MH2 domains, respectively, and an intervening middle linker, which is of variable length and sequence. The MH2 domain contains the principal receptor serine-threonine kinase phosphoacceptor sites (1.Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3972) Google Scholar, 3.Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3325) Google Scholar), and determinants of specific Smad-receptor and Smad-Smad interactions (4.Chen Y.G. Hata A. Lo R.S. Wotton D. Shi Y. Pavletich N. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2144-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), and is essential for transcriptional activation (2.Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Cell. 1998; 95: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). Effector functions of the MH2 domain are inhibited by the MH1 domain (5.Hata A. Lo R.S. Wotton D. Lagna G. Massague J. Nature. 1997; 388: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), while the MH1 and linker regions of Drosophila MAD and mammalian Smad3 are responsible for their DNA binding (2.Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Cell. 1998; 95: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). Smad4 is functionally unique among the Smads, with an amino acid sequence more closely related to the Drosophila gene product Medea than to Mad (6.Hudson J.B. Podos S.D. Keith K. Simpson S.L. Ferguson E.L. Development. 1998; 125: 1407-1420PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the R-Smads, Smad4 is not regulated by phosphorylation, but acts as a common mediator of TGF-β, activin, and bone morphogenetic protein signaling responses (7.de Caestecker M.P.

Development. 1997; 124: 4467-4480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following phosphorylation, R-Smads form hetero-oligomeric complexes with Smad4 which are then translocated to the nucleus (1.Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3972) Google Scholar, 3.Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3325) Google Scholar). Like the R-Smads, the MH2 domain of Smad4 is responsible for interaction with other Smad proteins, while autoinhibition of MH2 activity and DNA binding are mediated through its MH1 domain (5.Hata A. Lo R.S. Wotton D. Lagna G. Massague J. Nature. 1997; 388: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Smad4 is an essential component of transcriptional complexes mediating the activation of Smad-dependent target genes. The transcriptional activity of Smad4 has been ascribed to its capacity to associate with other Smad-transcription factor complexes on cis-acting elements of responsive promoters (10.Chen X.

Recent data also suggest that Smad4 plays an active role in recruiting other components of the transcriptional complex involved in target gene activation, including the transcriptional co-activator MSG1 (19.Shioda T. Lechleider R.J. Dunwoodie S.L. Li H. Yahata T. de Caestecker M.P. Fenner M.H. Roberts A.B. Isselbacher K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9785-9790Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Although several studies have suggested that the C-terminal MH2 domain is essential for mediating Smad4 transcriptional activation (11.Liu F. Pouponnot C. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 20.Liu F. Hata A. Baker J.C. Doody J. Carcamo J. Harland R.M. Massague J. Nature. 1996; 381: 620-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar), recent studies show that a Smad4 mutant lacking the whole MH2 domain retains the capacity to activate transcription (21.Stroschein S.L. Wang W. Luo K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9431-9441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we previously showed that the Smad4 MH2 domain is interchangeable with the Smad1 MH2 domain, and that a 48-amino acid segment within the middle linker called the Smad4 activation domain, or SAD, is required for the activation of Smad4-dependent signaling responses (7.de Caestecker M.P.

These data provide evidence that elements within the middle linker region of Smad4 are required for the activation of Smad-dependent transcriptional responses, but it is unknown how these regulate the function of Smad4. In this study, we show that the SAD is in fact a transcriptional activation domain which is both necessary and sufficient for the activation of transcription by Smad4. Mutants lacking the SAD are still able to form complexes with other Smad family members and associated transcription factors, but cannot activate transcription by these complexes. We show that the SAD has intrinsic, p300-dependent, transcriptional activity, and determine that this activity is associated with a physical interaction between the SAD and the NH2 terminus of p300. These findings identify a novel function for the middle linker region of Smad4, and define the role of the SAD as an important locus determining the transcriptional activation of the Smad complex. MDA-MB468, NMuMg, and COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Cells were transfected with the indicated constructs using Superfect (Qiagen) or LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies), according to the manufacturer's protocols. 3′ FLAG-tagged Smad4 mutant and deletion constructs, and 5′ double Myc-tagged Smad2 were generated by polymerase chain reaction using a proofreading polymerase and subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) or the pSG424 (22.Sadowski I. Ptashne M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) expression vectors. All polymerase chain reaction-generated products were sequenced using the dideoxynucleotide method. The 3TP-Lux reporter was used to measure TGF-β-induced gene expression, while pG5E1B-Luc, containing the Gal4 upstream activating sequence linked to a luciferase reporter, was co-transfected with the indicated Gal4-Smad fusion protein constructs in heterologous DNA binding assays. For the ARE-reporter assays, ARE-Luc containing three tandem repeats of the ARE linked to the luciferase reporter in pGL3 was co-transfected with Myc-FAST1, Myc-Smad2, and various Smad4-FLAG constructs. Transfection, TGF-β treatment and luciferase assays were performed as described previously, co-transfecting pSV-β-galactosidase to allow for normalization of transfection efficiency (7.de Caestecker M.P.

The total amount of transfected DNA was standardized by addition of pcDNA3 control vector as required, and all assays were performed in triplicate, and represented as mean (±S.E.) of three independent transfections. COS-1 and NMuMg cells were transfected with the indicated constructs, with or without, the activated TGF-β type I receptor (T204D) point mutant (23.Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massague J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). After 24 h cells were switched to 0.2% serum overnight, and lysed in 0.5 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) in the presence of phosphatase and protease inhibitors. Lysates were either directly separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore), and/or first immunoprecipitated for 1 h using epitope-specific 9E10 anti-Myc (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) monoclonal antibodies. For the p300 interaction assays, cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, and endogenous p300 immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-p300 (N15, Santa Cruz). Western blots were performed using mouse monoclonal anti-Myc, anti-FLAG M2 (Kodak), anti-HA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), rabbit anti-Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Santa Cruz), or rabbit anti-p300 (C-20, Santa Cruz), as indicated, detected using the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and visualized by chemiluminescence (Pierce). For GST affinity assays, glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins for the N (amino acids 1–596), M (744–1571), or C (1572–2370) regions of p300 were expressed in bacteria and quantitated by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining following affinity purification on glutathione beads. Equal amounts of fusion protein were incubated in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100 with protease and phosphatase inhibitors) with lysates from COS cells transiently transfected with the Gal4-SAD expression construct. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-GST antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunblotting with anti-Gal4 antibody. NMuMg cells were transiently transfected in chamber slides with the FLAG-tagged Smad4 constructs and Myc-Smad2, with or without the activated TβRI (T204D), and serum starved overnight 24 h later. Cells were then fixed and permeabilized, as described previously (24.de Caestecker M.P. Parks W.T. Frank C.J. Castagnino P. Bottaro D.P. Roberts A.B. Lechleider R.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1587-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), and FLAG epitopes detected by incubating with the anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody overnight at 4 °C. This was followed by incubation with a goat anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate secondary antibody, and mounting in medium containing 4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (Vectorshield, Vector Labs). The percentage of nuclear localization represents 100 cells counted by a trained observer (W. T. P.), blinded as to the constructs transfected. MDA-MB468 and NMuMg cells were transfected, serum starved overnight, and treated with TGF-β for 1 h. Cell lysates were prepared in hypertonic buffer containing 400 mm KCl, 0.4% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 20 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 10 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Following clarification, lysates were snap frozen and stored at −80 °C. DNA binding assays were performed using a radiolabeled ARE probe generated by polymerase chain reaction with [32P]dCTP and [32P]dATP, using two overlapping ARE oligonucleotides (5′-CCGACTAGTATCTGCTGCCCTAAAATGTGTATTCCATGGAAATG-3′ and 5′-CCGGCTAGCTAGGGAGAGAAGGGCAGACATTTCCATGGAATAC-3′), to generate a 71-base pair probe. The radiolabeled probe was added to the cell lysates for 30 min after equilibrating the freshly thawed lysates to 200 mm KCl with 20 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 10 mm EGTA, and 5 mm EDTA, and adding an equal volume of probe mixture containing 20 mm KCl, 11 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, and 200 μg/ml poly(dI-dC). For antibody supershift experiments, 200 mmKCl equilibrated cell lysates were incubated for 10 min with anti-Myc 9E10, or anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibodies in the probe mixture, prior to addition of the radiolabeled ARE probe. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Smad4 restores TGF-β responsive p3TP-Lux reporter gene activation when co-transfected into Smad4 null MDA-MB468 cells (7.de Caestecker M.P. Hemmati P. Larisch-Bloch S. Ajmera R. Roberts A.B. Lechleider R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13690-13696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Using the same functional assay, we have previously shown that deletion of the COOH-terminal portion of the middle linker region of Smad4 (amino acids 275–322), the Smad4 activation domain (SAD), results in loss of function, and that the NH2 terminus of Smad4 enhances ligand-dependent reporter gene activation in Smad1/Smad4 chimeras (7.de Caestecker M.P.

The mechanism whereby Smad4(Δ275–322) interferes with Smad-mediated signaling is unknown. To explore this further, we used a heterologous transcriptional activation assay to determine the ability of this Smad4 mutant to restore transcriptional activity of a Gal4-Smad2 fusion protein, which has previously been shown to be dependent on Smad4 expression (11.Liu F. Pouponnot C. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Co-transfection of Smad4 with Gal4-Smad2 restored ligand-dependent transcriptional activation of the Gal4 reporter gene in Smad4-null MDA-MB 468 cells, while Smad4(Δ275–322) only weakly restored transcriptional activity of the fusion protein, despite comparable levels of Gal4-Smad2 fusion protein expression (Fig.1 A). To determine if the differences in ability to activate transcription were dependent on Smad4 directly, we performed the same experiments using Gal4-Smad4 fusion constructs. Transfection of Gal4 fusion proteins containing full-length Smad4, or a truncated Smad4 encompassing amino acids 266–552, showed a ligand dependent activation of the Gal4 reporter, with a larger absolute activation by the 266–552 construct, consistent with relief of autoinhibition by the MH1 domain (5.Hata A. Lo R.S. Wotton D. Lagna G. Massague J. Nature. 1997; 388: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 20.Liu F. Hata A. Baker J.C. Doody J. Carcamo J. Harland R.M. Massague J. Nature. 1996; 381: 620-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Compatible with the above findings, deleting the SAD from these constructs caused a complete loss of signal, despite comparable expression levels (Fig. 1 B). Interactions between Smad4 and R-Smad proteins are particularly sensitive to deletion and mutation within the COOH-terminal domain of Smad4 (25.Shi Y. Hata A. Lo R.S. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1997; 388: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 26.Wu R.Y. Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Derynck R. Mol. Cell.

As the Smad4(Δ275–322) deletion is in close apposition to the MH2 domain (amino acids 323–552), we felt that a possible explanation for its lack of function was through disruption of the MH2 tertiary structure. We therefore tested the known cytoplasmic functions of the MH2 domain of Smad4, including hetero-oligomerization with R-Smads and nuclear translocation of Smad-containing complexes. Smad4(Δ275–322) formed heteromeric complexes with Smad2 (Lane 4, Fig.2 A), and, as described for the wild type molecule (11.Liu F. Pouponnot C. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 28.Souchelnytskyi S. Tamaki K. Engstrom U. Wernstedt C. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28107-28115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), underwent ligand-dependent nuclear translocation in the presence of overexpressed Smad2 (Fig.2 B). This differentiates it from COOH-terminal point mutants of Smad4, G508S and D351H, which disrupt the normal COOH-terminal structure of Smad4 and fail to form heteromeric complexes with activated Smad2 (25.Shi Y. Hata A. Lo R.S. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1997; 388: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Smad4G508S and Smad4D351H did not undergo nuclear translocation following receptor activation (Fig.2 B). This suggests that the COOH-terminal structure of Smad4 is preserved in Smad4(Δ275–322), and indicates that the principal effect of the SAD deletion is to interfere with the nuclear activities of Smad4. To determine how deletion of the SAD disrupts the nuclear functions of Smad4, we reconstituted a defined transcriptional response fromXenopus in mammalian cells. Activin and TGF-β signaling induce the formation of an activin response factor (ARF) that contains Smad2, Smad4, and FAST1, and binds to the activin response element (ARE) on the Xenopus Mix.2 promotor (10.Chen X. Weisberg E. Fridmacher V. Watanabe M. Naco G. Whitman M. Nature. 1997; 389: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 11.Liu F. Pouponnot C. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 29.Chen X. Rubock M.J. Whitman M. Nature. 1996; 383: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Smad4 is a critical component of this complex, enabling transcriptional activation of the ARE-containing reporter construct (10.Chen X. Weisberg E. Fridmacher V. Watanabe M. Naco G. Whitman M. Nature. 1997; 389: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 11.Liu F. Pouponnot C. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that wild type Smad4 forms ternary complexes with FAST1 in the presence of Smad2 (10.Chen X. Weisberg E. Fridmacher V. Watanabe M. Naco G. Whitman M. Nature. 1997; 389: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 11.Liu F. Pouponnot C. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). We reproduced these findings with wild type Smad4, and also showed that the Smad4(Δ275–322) mutant co-immunoprecipitates with FAST1 in the presence of Smad2. 2R. Lechleider, unpublished data. We sought to determine if loss of the SAD would alter the DNA binding ability of the Smad-FAST1 complex. We performed gel shift experiments using lysates from Smad4-null MDA-MB468 cells transfected with various components of the ARF and a 32P-labeled ARE probe. No TGF-β-inducible ARE binding complexes were detected in cells transfected with vector alone, FAST1, or Smad2 and FAST1. However, co-transfection with either wild type Smad4 or the Smad4(Δ275–322) SAD deletion mutant yielded TGF-β-inducible gel-shifted complexes (Lanes 9 and11, Fig. 3 A). To confirm that wild type Smad4, Smad4(Δ275–322), Smad2 and FAST1 all participated in these ARE-binding complexes, we used antibodies directed against the epitopes expressed on these constructs to supershift the complexes. TGF-β-responsive NMuMg cells were used as these gave a reproducibly high level of protein expression following transient transfection (Fig. 3 E). In these cells, ligand-dependent gel-shifted complexes are seen in the absence of exogenous Smad4 (Lane 3, Fig. 3 B), presumably as a result of binding to complexes containing endogenous Smad4. Incubation with Myc antibody reduced the mobility of the ARE-binding complex (Lanes 4, 8, and 12), confirming the presence of Myc-Smad2 and/or Myc-FAST1 in all of the complexes, while the FLAG antibody shifted a component of the complex either with transfected wild type Smad4, or the Smad4(Δ275–322) deletion mutant (Lanes 9 and 13). The FLAG antibody did not lead to any supershift in lysates from cells transfected with FAST1 and Smad2 alone (Lane 5), confirming the specificity of these findings. These data show that the Smad4(Δ275–322) deletion mutant participates in ligand-dependent DNA binding complexes. The ability of wild type Smad4 to participate in these transcriptional complexes correlates with its ability to enhance ligand-dependent transcriptional activation of the ARE-luciferase reporter both in Smad4 null cells (Fig. 3 C), and in TGF-β-responsive NMuMg cells (Fig. 3 D). The Smad4(Δ275–322) mutant only weakly enhanced ARE-luciferase activity in Smad4 null cells when compared with the Smad4-independent activation response (Fig. 3 C). Furthermore, in NMuMg cells, both basal and ligand-dependent activation of the ARE luciferase reporter were reduced in the presence of Smad4(Δ275–322) (Fig.3 D), indicating that Smad4(Δ275–322) has dominant negative effects on TGF-β signaling. In these experiments, various defined components of this transcriptional complex were expressed at comparable levels (Fig. 3 E). Taken together, these data indicate that maximal activation of Smad-dependent transcriptional responses by Smad4 requires the SAD, and that this activity is distinct from its ability to participate in these transcriptional complexes. Although we have shown that Smad4 mutants lacking the SAD only weakly activate transcription of Smad-dependent transcriptional complexes, we were unable to identify any defects in the other known biochemical functions of Smad4. Analysis of the SAD amino acid sequence (Fig. 4 A) shows that it is rich in proline residues, much like the transcriptional activation domains of other well characterized transcriptional activators including AP-2 and CTF/NF-1 (30.Kunzler M. Braus G.H. Georgiev O. Seipel K. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 31.Latchman D.S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1305-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). To test our hypothesis that the SAD acts as an intrinsic transcriptional activation domain, we performed heterologous activation assays using a Gal4-SAD fusion protein. These experiments demonstrate that the SAD is a strong, ligand-independent transcriptional activator, with levels of activation comparable to or higher than the most active Gal4-Smad4 fusion construct (Fig. 4 B). Recent studies suggest that the transcriptional activity of Smad proteins is dependent on their interaction with the paralogous bridging co-activators CBP and p300, linking the Smad-DNA binding complex to the basal transcriptional machinery (14.Feng X.H.

Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 613-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In order to determine if SAD transcriptional activity was dependent on interaction with these co-activators, we co-transfected adenoviral E1A, an inhibitor of CBP/p300 activity (33.Arany Z. Newsome D. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Nature. 1995; 374: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), along with Gal4-SAD, in the heterologous activation assay. E1A overexpression markedly reduced the level of Gal4-SAD transcriptional activity, while a mutant form of E1A lacking the CBP/p300-binding site (Δ2–36) (34.Kraus V.B. Moran E. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4391-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) had no effect on this response (Fig. 4 C). The levels of Gal4-SAD protein expression were unaffected by E1A transfection. To confirm that this effect was dependent on p300 activity, we co-transfected increasing amounts of p300 along with E1A in the Gal4-SAD reporter assay. p300 partially relieved E1A inhibition of Gal4-SAD (Fig. 4 D).

We investigated the role ofSmad4 in TGFβ-related pathways by targeted disruption of its locus in murine cell lines. TGFβ responses, including growth arrest, induction of the endogenous PAI-1 gene, and other extracellular matrix components, were normal in Smad4-deficient fibroblasts. Assembly of a TGFβ-induced DNA-binding complex on one of two regulatory regions in the human plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 promoter did not require Smad4 but was, instead, dependent on a TFE-3 binding site. In contrast, Smad4 was required for activation of the Xenopus Mix.2 promoter in response to TGFβ/activin. Smad4 was also involved in the regulation of the Msx homeobox protein family members in response to bone morphogenetic protein (BMP). Interestingly, the expression of the endogenous Msx-2 was reduced, whereas that of Msx-3 was activated in differentiating Smad4 −/− ES cells relative to wild-type cells. Moreover, reporter assays of the Msx-2promoter revealed an absolute requirement for Smad4 in fibroblasts and ES cells for activation. Our results indicate that Smad4 is dispensable for critical TGFβ-induced responses but is required for others in murine fibroblasts.

Wrana J.L. Lopez-Casillas F. Massague J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1222: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The type II receptor transphosphorylates and activates the type I receptor, which then transmits the signal to a family of intracellular signaling molecules called Smad, which are related to the Drosophila gene Mothers against dpp (Mad) (2.Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar). There are three functional categories of Smad proteins: receptor-regulated Smads, common-mediator Smads, and inhibitory Smads. The BMP-regulated Smads consist of Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8, whereas Smad2 and Smad3 are restricted to the TGFβ/activin pathway (3.Massagué J. Hata A. Liu F.

Heteromeric complexes between the various receptor-regulated Smads and Smad4 have been suggested to be a critical prerequisite for functional signaling. Activation of the TGFβ/activin pathway results in the phosphorylation of Smad2 or Smad3 by the type I receptor followed by their interaction with Smad4. A similar phosphorylation-dependent interaction of Smad1 and Smad5 with Smad4 has been observed in BMP signaling (2.Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar, 3.Massagué J. Hata A. Liu F. Trends in Cell Biology. 1997; 7: 187-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Such heteromeric complexes are translocated to the nucleus where Smad4 appears to function as a transcriptional coactivator (5.Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Cell. 1998; 95: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Furthermore, activation of the TGFβ/activin pathway leads to induction of theMix.2 and goosecoid promoters through the formation of an activin responsivefactor (ARF). The ARF is composed of Smad2, Smad4, and either FAST-1 or FAST-2, members of the forkhead transcription factor family (5.Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Cell. 1998; 95: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Smad4 in the ARF promotes transactivation by binding to DNA at a site adjacent to the FAST site (6.Labbe E. Silvestri C. Hoodless P.A. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 7.Zhou S. Zawel L. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 121-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Although Smad binding to the goosecoid promoter and severalDrosophila dpp-responsive genes is mediated via a GC-rich sequence (5.Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Cell. 1998; 95: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar), the optimal Smad binding element appears to be the sequence AGAC (8.Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar), which is present on various promoters of TGFβ-responsive genes (5.Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Cell. 1998; 95: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar), including at several sites within the human PAI-1 promoter (9.Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar, 10.Song C.Z. Siok T.E. Gelehrter T.D. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). However, experiments designed to determine the requirement for Smad4 in the activation of the promoters, such as PAI-1, relied primarily on reporter constructs with artificially modified promoters rather than activation of the endogenous gene. BMP2/4 signaling is required throughout development for cell fate determination, structural morphogenesis and apoptosis. These processes are mediated, in part, by the Msx homeobox gene family. Although the expression of Msx-3 is restricted to the neural tube and hind brain region during early mouse development (12.Wang W. Chen X. Xu H. Lufkin T. Mech. Dev. 1996; 58: 203-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 13.Shimeld S.M. McKay I.J. Sharpe P.T. Mech. Dev. 1996; 55: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), that of Msx-1 and -2, as well as BMP-4, is extended to other tissues undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (14.Zou H. Niswander L. Science. 1996; 272: 738-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 15.Graham A. Francis-West P. Brickell P. Lumsden A. Nature. 1994; 372: 684-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). It has been well establish that BMP4 can induce apoptosis in the cephalic neural crest (15.Graham A. Francis-West P. Brickell P. Lumsden A. Nature. 1994; 372: 684-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) and in the chick limb (16.Ganan Y. Macias D. Duterque-Coquillaud M. Ros M.A. Hurle J.M. Development. 1996; 122: 2349-2357PubMed Google Scholar). Circumstantial evidence has initially implicated Msx-1 and Msx-2 in this process based on the close association of their temporal-spatial expression patterns with sites undergoing program cell death (17.Davidson D. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 405-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) and on their transcriptional response to BMP4 (15.Graham A. Francis-West P. Brickell P. Lumsden A. Nature. 1994; 372: 684-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Moreover, the introduction of a dominant-negative BMP-receptor in the chick limb results in decreased inter-digital death and a specific decrease in the levels of Msx-2 transcripts (14.Zou H. Niswander L. Science. 1996; 272: 738-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Overexpression ofMsx-1 can mimics BMP-induced responses inXenopus, including ventral mesoderm formation and epidermal induction (18.Suzuki A. Ueno N. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Development. 1997; 124: 3037-3044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although these studies establish a fundamental role for the Msx genes in BMP signaling pathway, the role of Smad4 in these BMP-induced responses is not known. To address more precisely the role of Smad4 in TGFβ-related signaling, we have generated cell lines in which Smad4 was disrupted by homologous recombination (19.Sirard C. de la Pompa J.L. Elia A. Itie A. Mirtsos C. Cheung A. Hahn S. Wakeham A. Schwartz L. Kern S.E. Rossant J. Mak T.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 107-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Signaling pathways were investigated in ES cell lines and fibroblasts derived from chimeric embryos. InSmad4-deficient fibroblasts, the physiological responses induced by TGFβ/activin remained unchanged relative to wild-type as determined by growth inhibition and the induction of extracellular matrix (ECM) gene expression. Interestingly, we identified Smad4-dependent and -independent elements in the PAI-1 promoter, which might explain why Smad4 is dispensable for some TGFβ-induced responses. However, Smad4 was necessary for other TGFβ/activin-responsive genes. In Smad4-deficient ES cells, endogenous expression of the BMP-responsive gene,Msx-2, was reduced during EB differentiation compared with wild-type, and activation of the Msx-2 promoter element wasSmad4-dependent in ES cells and fibroblasts. Interestingly, endogenous expression of another Msx family member,Msx-3, was induced in the absence of Smad4. These results suggest that the Msx family member could be relevant biological targets for Smad4 and provide a mechanism by which perturbation of BMP-induced responses may contribute to the developmental defects of Smad4-deficient embryos. Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) were generated from pooled E12.5 chimeric embryos obtained by injectingSmad4 −/− ES cells (of 129/J origin) into C57BL/6 blastocysts (wild-type). MEFs were grown in the absence or presence (500 μg/ml) of G418 for 6 days, and immortalized 3T3 fibroblasts were established. Twenty μl of plasma-free blood or 10 × 105 cells were lysed in 200 μl of hypotonic buffer (1 mg/ml EDTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol) and frozen. Ten μl of thawed lysate was resolved on cellulose-acetate support, and GPI activity was detected by a standard protocol (20.Robertson E.J. Robertson E.J. Teratocarcinoma and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1987: 71-112Google Scholar). For PAI-1 induction, cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 105/35-mm dish. The next day cells were pulsed with TGF-β for 2 h and incubated for an additional 2–3 h in methionine-free medium containing TGF-β and 50 μCi/ml [35S]methionine. Cells were lysed, and the ECM attached to the surface of the dish was harvested as described elsewhere (21.Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). For fibronectin and collagen induction, cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 105/35-mm dish. TGF-β (100 pm) was added 18 h later for an additional 24 h. Proteins were labeled as described above for 2–3 h in 1 ml of methionine-free medium. The supernatants were collected and brought to a concentration of 0.3% Triton X-100. The fibronectin present in 250 μl of supernatant was purified with the equivalence of 50 μl of gelatin-Sepharose beads incubated overnight at 4 °C and processed as described elsewhere (21.Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts were stimulated with TGFβ (5 ng/ml) for 45 min. in 0.2% fetal calf serum, and cell extracts and binding assays were performed as described elsewhere (6.Labbe E. Silvestri C. Hoodless P.A. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Probes were obtained by end-labeling oligonucleotide primers with [γ-32P]ATP, and double-stranded fragments were generated by annealing with a 10-fold molar excess of the unlabeled complementary primer. Competing oligonucleotide fragments were added 10 min prior to the radiolabeled probe, and supershifting of the complex was performed by adding 1 μl of polyclonal antibody together with the probe. All transfections were performed in triplicate in 6-well dishes containing 105 cells seeded the previous day using Superfect reagent (Qiagen) for fibroblasts and LipofectAMINEplus (Life Technologies, Inc.) for ES cells as recommended by the manufacturers. Unless otherwise specified, equal amounts of DNA (totaling 1 μg) were co-transfected for all experimental constructs, and all transfections were normalized to pCMV-βgal (0.1 μg) expression. The normalized luciferase values were expressed relative to control transfections (pCMV vector alone) in the absence of stimulation. Luciferase assays (Promega) were performed 48 h post-transfection. Msx2-lux was derived by cloning a 1.7-kilobase BamHI genomic fragment approximately 3 kilobases upstream of the transcriptional start site, into pGL3-basic vector (Promega). This region was the most responsive to BMP activation. 2R. Maxson, unpublished data. All transfection analyses were conducted in two independent ES or fibroblastsSmad4 mutant clones and were repeated at least twice. Cell proliferation assays were performed in triplicate in 96-well plates containing 5 × 103cells/well and 1 μCi/well [3H]thymidine. Cells were harvested after a 16-h incubation, and [3H]thymidine incorporation was determined using a β-counter. The conditions for ES cell differentiation into embryoid bodies have been previously described (19.Sirard C. de la Pompa J.L. Elia A. Itie A. Mirtsos C. Cheung A. Hahn S. Wakeham A. Schwartz L. Kern S.E. Rossant J. Mak T.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 107-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Extracted RNA was reverse-transcribed with the Advantage RT-PCR kit (CLONTECH) and amplified for 30 cycles using the following primers (sense:antisense):Msx-1, 5′-CGCTTCACTCCTGCCCTTCA-3′:5′-ACTCCCGCTGCTCTGCTCAAA–3′;Msx-2,5′-CCGGGCCTCTCGTCAAAG-3′:5′-CGCCGTATATGGATGCTGCTT-3′; Msx-3, 5′-GCCACACAGAGCACGGACCA-3′:5′-AGCATCAGCGGCAGGCAGAAC-3′;TSC-22 ,5′-CAGAGAGTGAGCAGGGATGTG-3′:5′-TTTCTTCAGGTGTGGTTTTTG-3′. To control for the amount of RNA in different samples, expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was analyzed. The PCR products were Southern-blotted and hybridized with end-labeled primers of sequences internal to the amplified product. A ratio of 107 cells were lysed in 500 μl of CHAPS buffer (10 mm tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm benzamadine, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% CHAPS, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors) for 30 min on ice. Total protein lysate (50 μg) or immunoprecipitated proteins (500 μg) were fractionated on a 8% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with either rabbit polyclonal anti-Smad4 or anti-Smad3 antibodies diluted 1:500. The immobilized antibody was visualized using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobulin and ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To determine the role of Smad4 in TGFβ-related signaling, we generated ES cell lines in which Smad4 was disrupted by homologous recombination (19.Sirard C. de la Pompa J.L. Elia A. Itie A. Mirtsos C. Cheung A. Hahn S. Wakeham A. Schwartz L. Kern S.E. Rossant J. Mak T.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 107-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Since mice homozygous for the Smad4mutation die at E7.5 (19.Sirard C. de la Pompa J.L. Elia A. Itie A. Mirtsos C. Cheung A. Hahn S. Wakeham A. Schwartz L. Kern S.E. Rossant J. Mak T.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 107-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 22.Yang X. Li C. Xu X. Deng C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3667-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), Smad4 −/− MEFs were derived from chimeric embryos obtained by injecting mutant ES cells, containing the selectable marker neomycin, into wild-type blastocysts. The mixed population of MEFs was selected in G418 to eliminate wild-type cells, and two immortalizedSmad4-deficient 3T3 fibroblast lines (EF6-selC1 and EF7-selE) were established from independent blastocyst injections. In parallel, MEFs were cultured in the absence of selection to generate wild-type 3T3 fibroblasts (EF7). Analysis of GPI isoforms that distinguish between donor and host revealed that the two G418-resistant clones were indeed derived from mutant ES cells (Fig.1 A, lanes 10–12). Homozygosity for the disrupted Smad4 allele in these 3T3 fibroblasts was confirmed by Southern blot analysis (data not shown) and immunoblot analysis demonstrated the absence of any detectable Smad4 protein in these cells (Fig. 1 B). TGFβ signaling exerts a wide range of physiological responses, which include changes in extracellular matrix composition and growth arrest. To determine whether Smad4 is required in this pathway, the activation of extracellular matrix components in response to TGFβ was examined using [35S]methionine labelingin vivo. As expected, PAI-1 expression was induced in wild-type EF7 fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner by treatment with TGFβ ranging in concentration from 2 to 50 pm (Fig. 2 A). However, comparable induction of the endogenous PAI-1 gene was unexpectedly observed in the EF7-selE line ofSmad4-deficient fibroblasts (Fig. 2 A), implying that Smad4 is not required for this TGFβ-related response. This result prompted us to examine the response of other TGFβ-inducible genes encoding components of the ECM. Fibronectin (240 kDa) as well as several pro-collagens ranging in size from 185 to 205 kDa were induced to similar levels in wild-type and mutant fibroblasts by TGFβ treatment (Fig. 2 B). The identity of fibronectin was confirmed using specific binding to gelatin-Sepharose beads (Fig.2 B), whereas the presence of the pro-collagens was revealed by collagenase digestion of these proteins in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 2 C). A similar induction profile was observed with the secondSmad4 −/− cell line, EF6-selC1 (data not shown). These results indicate that Smad4 is not required in fibroblasts for the induction by TGFβ of the expression of endogenous extracellular matrix components and are consistent with recent studies demonstrating that Smad4-deficient human cell lines are capable of producing fibronectin in response to TGFβ (23.Hocevar B.A. Brown T.L. Howe P.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that TGFβ-induced growth arrest is lost during tumorigenesis (2.Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar, 3.Massagué J. Hata A. Liu F. Trends in Cell Biology. 1997; 7: 187-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Smad4 plays a role in this process, DNA replication was examined in fibroblasts by [3H]thymidine incorporation. In both wild-type EF7 andSmad4 −/− cells, growth inhibition was first detected at a TGFβ concentration of 2 pg/ml and reached a maximum (2-fold growth inhibition) at 1 ng/ml (Fig. 2 D). These values are comparable to those previously reported for TGFβ-responsive epithelial cells (24.Tucker R.F. Shipley G.D. Moses H.L. Holley R.W. Science. 1984; 226: 705-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). These data indicate that Smad4 is not required for TGFβ-induced growth arrest, a finding in apparent disagreement with previous work (25.Zhang Y. Feng X. We R. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar, 26.Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J.

However, these previous studies were conducted using either human Smad4-deficient cell lines derived from carcinomas known to accumulate numerous additional mutations or overexpression of a dominant negative mutation of the Smad4 protein, which could lack specificity. Because several studies implicating Smad4 in the TGFβ pathway were based on activation of the 3TP-lux reporter gene (25.Zhang Y. Feng X. We R. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar, 26.Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J.

Although transfected 3TP-lux was activated in response to TGFβ in wild-type EF7 fibroblasts, it was not activated inSmad4-deficient fibroblasts (Fig. 2 E). TGFβ-dependent activation of 3TP-lux in mutant cells could be restored to wild-type levels by co-transfection withSmad4 (Fig. 2 E). Thus, consistent with previous studies, we find that Smad4 is required for activation of the 3TP-lux reporter in our murine fibroblasts. However, because activation of the endogenous PAI-1 gene does not require Smad4 (Fig. 2 A), 3TP-lux activation may not be an accurate representation of PAI-1 activation. Rather, it may reflect TGFβ-mediated activation of the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive elements that were added to the construct to enhance TGFβ responsiveness (21.Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). In agreement with this notion, a reporter plasmid comprising only 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive elements has been shown to be as responsive to TGFβ, as the 3TP-lux reporter (31.Yingling J.M.

Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 34.Wong C. Rougier-Chapman E.M. Frederick J.P. Datto M.B. Liberati N.T. Li J.M. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell.

A. 1999; 96: 4844-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanism underlying Smad4-independent activation of TGFβ-inducible genes in fibroblasts, we examined the binding of nuclear protein complexes to the human PAI-1 promoter. Two TGFβ-dependent regulatory regions have been identified in the human PAI-1 promoter at positions −580 and −730 from the transcriptional start site. These regions are flanked by several E boxes (Fig.3 A) capable of binding the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, TFE-3, which appears to be important for TGFβ-dependent activation of PAI-1 (36.Hua X. Liu X. Ansari D.O. Lodish H.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3084-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Two Smad binding sites in the −580 regulatory region have also been implicated in PAI-1 activation (9.Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar, 36.Hua X. Liu X. Ansari D.O. Lodish H.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3084-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), one of which (AGNCAGA) is also required for activation in the −730 region (9.Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar). Interestingly, EMSA using a probe (PE2.1) specific for the −580 regulatory region (36.Hua X. Liu X. Ansari D.O. Lodish H.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3084-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) revealed that extracts from both wild-type andSmad4-deficient fibroblasts could form a DNA-binding complex in response to TGFβ stimulation (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1–5), suggesting that Smad4 is not required for DNA binding within that region. Consistent with this finding, anti-Smad4 as well as anti-Smad2 or -3 antibodies did not result in a supershift of the protein-DNA complex (Fig. 3 B, lanes 6–10). Furthermore, binding to the PE2.1 probe could be competed with as little as 3-fold excess of an oligonucleotide mutated in either of the two Smad binding sites; this was similar to the efficiency of wild-type unlabeled oligonucleotide competed with the radiolabeled PE2.1 probe (Fig.3 B, lanes 11–18 and 22–24). However, up to a 30-fold excess of mutant E box oligonucleotides could not compete for binding to the PE2.1 probe (Fig. 3 B, lanes 19–21 and22–24). These results indicate that the TGFβ-inducible DNA-binding complex associated with PAI-1 activation in fibroblasts requires an intact E box but does not depend on Smad4 or any Smad binding elements present in the −580 region. In contrast to the −580 region, analysis of the −730 PAI-1 region using the TRS probe (10.Song C.Z. Siok T.E. Gelehrter T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29287-29290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) revealed that a TGFβ-inducible DNA-binding complex could form in extracts from wild-type but notSmad4-deficient fibroblasts (Fig. 3 C, lanes 1 and 2 compared with lanes 12 and 13). Further analysis of the complex formed on the TRS site showed that binding was dependent on the Smad element, because unlabeled wild-type oligonucleotide, but not an oligonucleotide mutated in the Smad binding site (TRSm4), was able to compete for binding (Fig. 3 C,lanes 3–8). Antibodies against Smad3 and Smad4, but not Smad2, were able to supershift the protein-DNA complex (Fig. 3 C, lanes 9–11), indicating that both Smad3 and Smad4 were present in the binding complex. Together, these data indicate that formation of a TGFβ-inducible complex on the TRS is dependent on Smad4 and, in its absence, Smad3 cannot bind to the TRS sequence. Thus, the PAI-1 promoter contains two TGFβ-responsive elements that differ in their requirement for Smad4. Our results suggest that the −580 regulatory region may be the major determinant of endogenous PAI-1 induction in the absence of Smad4. Activation of the TGFβ/activin pathway leads to induction of FAST target genes through the formation of the ARF (5.Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Cell. 1998; 95: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Smad4 is required for the activation of FAST target genes, we tested the regulatio"
https://openalex.org/W1980823970,"The role of the putative fourth cytoplasmic loop of rhodopsin in the binding and catalytic activation of the heterotrimeric G protein, transducin (Gt), is not well defined. We developed a novel assay to measure the ability of Gt, or Gt-derived peptides, to inhibit the photoregeneration of rhodopsin from its active metarhodopsin II state. We show that a peptide corresponding to residues 340–350 of the α subunit of Gt, or a cysteinyl-thioetherfarnesyl peptide corresponding to residues 50–71 of the γ subunit of Gt, are able to interact with metarhodopsin II and inhibit its photoconversion to rhodopsin. Alteration of the amino acid sequence of either peptide, or removal of the farnesyl group from the γ-derived peptide, prevents inhibition. Mutation of the amino-terminal region of the fourth cytoplasmic loop of rhodopsin affects interaction with Gt (Marin, E. P., Krishna, A. G., Zvyaga T. A., Isele, J., Siebert, F., and Sakmar, T. P. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 1930–1936). Here, we provide evidence that this segment of rhodopsin interacts with the carboxyl-terminal peptide of the α subunit of Gt. We propose that the amino-terminal region of the fourth cytoplasmic loop of rhodopsin is part of the binding site for the carboxyl terminus of the α subunit of Gt and plays a role in the regulation of βγ subunit binding. The role of the putative fourth cytoplasmic loop of rhodopsin in the binding and catalytic activation of the heterotrimeric G protein, transducin (Gt), is not well defined. We developed a novel assay to measure the ability of Gt, or Gt-derived peptides, to inhibit the photoregeneration of rhodopsin from its active metarhodopsin II state. We show that a peptide corresponding to residues 340–350 of the α subunit of Gt, or a cysteinyl-thioetherfarnesyl peptide corresponding to residues 50–71 of the γ subunit of Gt, are able to interact with metarhodopsin II and inhibit its photoconversion to rhodopsin. Alteration of the amino acid sequence of either peptide, or removal of the farnesyl group from the γ-derived peptide, prevents inhibition.

Rhodopsin is one of the archetypes of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. It triggers the biochemical amplification machinery of the visual cascade in the rod photoreceptor cell, which comprises the G protein transducin (Gt)1 and the effector, a cyclic GMP-specific phosphodiesterase (3.Sakmar T.P.

Acta. 1996; 1286: 285-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The transduction of a light signal begins with the photochemicalcis-trans isomerization of the chromophore, 11-cis-retinal. Protein conformational changes are transmitted from the ligand-binding site to the cytoplasmic surface of the receptor where catalytic activation of Gt occurs. This intramolecular conversion from inactive (rhodopsin) to active (R*) states mediated by chromophore isomerization has been termed “signal transmission” (5.Hofmann K.P. Goode J. Rhodopsins and Phototransduction. Wiley, Chichester, UK1999: 158-175Google Scholar). Key structural correlates of the transition to the active state include deprotonation of the retinylidene Schiff base (6.Longstaff C. Calhoon R.D. Rando R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Movements of TM helices have been proposed to accompany the signal transmission process, with a change in the orientation of TM helices 3 and 6 relative to each other as the most prominent feature (11.Farrens D.L.

The first (C1), second (C2), and third (C3) cytoplasmic loops connect adjacent TM helices. The fourth cytoplasmic loop (C4) is bounded by TM helix 7 at its amino terminus and two palmitoyl groups inserted into the membrane bilayer at its carboxyl terminus. The palmitoyl groups are attached to Cys322 and Cys323 via thioester linkages. A schematic of the structure of rhodopsin is presented in the preceding paper (14.Marin E.P. Krishna A.G. Zvyaga T.A.

A variety of experimental approaches, including proteolysis, chemical modification, peptide competition, and site-directed mutagenesis in combination with biochemical and biophysical assays, have been employed to map the sites of rhodopsin responsible for the binding and activation of Gt. The salient results have indicated that loops C2 and C3 are involved in Gt binding and activation (15.Franke R.R. König B. Sakmar T.P. Khorana H.G. Hofmann K.P.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7931-7937Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Despite these studies and the availability of a high-resolution crystal structure for the Gt holoprotein (19.Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar), there is little information concerning: 1) the key functional intramolecular interactions on the cytoplasmic surface of rhodopsin that form and regulate the catalytic site for Gt, 2) Gt subunit specificity for binding to particular cytoplasmic regions of rhodopsin, 3) the molecular mechanism of rhodopsin-catalyzed nucleotide release by Gt.In the preceding paper (14.Marin E.P.

Chem. 2000; 275: 1930-1936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), we identified a region at the amino terminus of loop C4 of rhodopsin that most likely interacts with the α subunit of Gt, Gαt. Here, we studied the interaction of site-directed mutants of rhodopsin with Gtand peptides derived from the carboxyl-terminal sequences of Gαt and Gγt (20.Arnis S. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9333-9340Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 21.Ernst, O. P., Bieri, C., Vogel, H., and Hofmann, K. P.

A. 1999; 96: 4898-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We used a novel assay in which the all-trans-retinal in metarhodopsin II (MII) is photoconverted to the cis configuration using blue light. The flash-induced photoregeneration of rhodopsin from MII can be followed spectroscopically with millisecond time resolution (20.Arnis S. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9333-9340Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Since stabilization of R* by Gt or Gt-derived peptides inhibits the rate of photoregeneration, the assay can be used to monitor the interaction of R* with Gt (21.Ernst, O. P., Bieri, C., Vogel, H., and Hofmann, K. P. (2000) Methods Enzymol., in pressGoogle Scholar, 22.Kisselev O.G. Meyer C.K. Heck M. Ernst O.P. Hofmann K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4898-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We show that peptide α(340–350), corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal undecapeptide of Gαt, and peptide γ(50–71)-far, corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal cysteinyl-thioetherfarnesyl peptide of Gγt, stabilized R*. Alteration of the amino acid sequence of either peptide, or removal of the farnesyl group of the Gγt-derived peptide prevented stabilization of R*. Gt failed to stabilize mutant rhodopsins with alterations of the amino terminus of loop C4 near the TM helix 7 border. The Gαt-derived peptide also failed to stabilize these mutants, suggesting that loop C4 comprises part of a binding site for the carboxyl-terminal tail of Gαt.DISCUSSIONSeveral lines of evidence suggest that the conformation of the cytoplasmic surface of the active state of rhodopsin, R*, is coupled to the conformation of the chromophore-binding pocket in the membrane-embedded domain of the receptor (3.Sakmar T.P. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 4.Helmreich E.J. Hofmann K.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 285-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In analogy to G protein-coupled receptors with diffusible ligands in which G protein binding stabilizes a receptor conformation with a high affinity ligand-binding site, MII is stabilized at the expense of its tautomeric forms by the binding of Gt or Gt-derived peptides. This stabilization of MII is the basis of the “extra-MII” assay (34.Emeis D. Hofmann K.P. FEBS Lett. 1981; 136: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 35.Hamm H.E. Deretic D. Arendt A. Hargrave P.A. Koenig B. Hofmann K.P. Science. 1988; 241: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). This assay, however, can only be applied under conditions of a dynamic equilibrium between metarhodopsin I and MII, which is exquisitely sensitive to membrane environment, pH, temperature, ionic strength, etc. Therefore, an assay was developed that measures the kinetics of photoconversion of MII to rhodopsin in detergent solution (20.Arnis S. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9333-9340Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 21.Ernst, O. P., Bieri, C., Vogel, H., and Hofmann, K. P. (2000) Methods Enzymol., in pressGoogle Scholar, 22.Kisselev O.G. Meyer C.K. Heck M. Ernst O.P. Hofmann K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4898-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The assay uses the fact that photoconversion of MII (λmax = 380 nm) to rhodopsin (λmax = 500 nm) following a blue actinic flash is inhibited if the MII molecule is bound to Gt (20.Arnis S. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9333-9340Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), or certain Gt-derived peptides (21.Ernst, O. P., Bieri, C., Vogel, H., and Hofmann, K. P. (2000) Methods Enzymol., in pressGoogle Scholar, 22.Kisselev O.G. Meyer C.K. Heck M. Ernst O.P. Hofmann K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4898-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) as a result of the coupling between the conformation of the cytoplasmic surface and that of the chromophore-binding pocket.The initial step in photoregeneration, the photoisomerization of the retinal to its cis conformation, may be compared with loading a spring that subsequently drives the protein, including its cytoplasmic domain, back to the ground state conformation (20.Arnis S. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9333-9340Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The product formed in this initial step, termed “reverted meta (RM),” is characterized by a MII-like protein conformation and acis-retinal with a deprotonated Schiff base; it is spectrally indistinguishable from MII. RM rapidly converts to a rhodopsin-like species characterized by a rhodopsin-like protein conformation and a cis-retinal with a protonated Schiff base. The presence of Gt does not affect RM formation, indicating that the isomerization of the retinal itself is unaffected. However, bound Gt prevents RM from converting to rhodopsin, by stabilizing the MII-like conformation of RM. Dissociation of Gt from RM by GTPγS treatment allows RM to revert to rhodopsin quantitatively (20.Arnis S. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9333-9340Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The effects, and presumably the mechanism of action, of certain Gt-derived peptides on photoregeneration are similar to those of Gt itself (22.Kisselev O.G. Meyer C.K. Heck M. Ernst O.P. Hofmann K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4898-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).Photoregeneration Is Sensitive to Interactions with Gtand Certain Gt-derived PeptidesGtinteracts with R* to stabilize the active signaling state such that photoregeneration to rhodopsin is effectively blocked (20.Arnis S. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9333-9340Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Recently, a peptide corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of Gγt and a peptide analogue related to the carboxyl terminus of Gαt were demonstrated to mimic the effect of Gt by inhibiting photoregeneration of R* (22.Kisselev O.G. Meyer C.K. Heck M. Ernst O.P. Hofmann K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4898-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Here we showed that synthetic peptide α(340–350) could cause the same effect as Gt (Fig. 2). In addition, the effect of α(340–350) was specific to its primary structure since a mutant peptide had no effect (Fig. 3). Synthetic peptide γ(50–71)-far also inhibited photoregeneration of R* (Fig. 2). The effect was specific to its primary structure and to the presence of cysteinyl thioether farnesylation (Fig. 3). Using single peptides that represent small regions of Gt provides a powerful probe of subunit- and domain-specific interactions.The potencies of the α(340–350) and γ(50–71)-far peptides are about 20- and 100-fold less than that of Gt, respectively (Fig. 2). This finding is reasonable considering that the tertiary structure of a short peptide is less defined, so that a higher binding energy, and thus concentration, is needed for the “induced fit.” Also, the cytoplasmic surface domain of R* comprises multiple interaction sites for Gt binding, including the loops C2 and C3 (15.Franke R.R. König B. Sakmar T.P. Khorana H.G. Hofmann K.P. Science. 1990; 250: 123-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 16.Franke R.R. Sakmar T.P. Graham R.M. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14767-14774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Koenig B. Arendt A. McDowell J.H. Kahlert M. Hargrave P.A. Hofmann K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6878-6882Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Gt also has at least two, and probably more, sites that interact with the receptor during binding and activation. Peptide α(340–350) showed a clear inhibition of photoregeneration with an almost complete suppression at saturating concentrations (Fig. 2 B). The peptide γ(50–71)-far showed a lower efficacy to inhibit photoregeneration. Although the inhibitory effect saturated at high concentrations with a normal first-order binding isotherm, there was not a complete suppression of the photoregeneration effect (Fig. 2 C). The binding of γ(50–71)-far to R* is likely to be quite complex due to specificity which arises from both the farnesyl moiety and the peptide sequence (Fig. 3). The carboxyl-terminal region of Gγt was also studied using a MII difference spectroscopy assay with similar findings (30.Kisselev O.G. Ermolaeva M.V. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21399-21402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Kisselev O. Ermolaeva M. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25356-25358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).The Role of a Conserved Region at the Amino Terminus of Loop C4 of Rhodopsin in Gt BindingWe used the photoregeneration assay to probe the effects of Gt and Gt-derived peptides on expressed rhodopsin and rhodopsin mutants. The rhodopsin loop C4 mutations did not significantly affect the signal transmission path itself, as is seen from the similar kinetics of the photoregeneration signals in the absence of Gt and Gt-derived peptides (Fig. 4). The results in Figs. 2 and 3show that Gt, and peptides α(340–350) and γ(50–71)-far are specific probes of rhodopsin signaling. Therefore, inhibition of photoregeneration by Gt or Gt-derived peptides is interpreted as the specific interaction of these reagents with the intracellular surface. A lack of inhibition due to alteration of either the peptide or the C4 loop is interpreted as a disruption of interaction. An advantage of the photoregeneration assay is that only productive binding interactions that stabilize specific conformations of the protein are reported.In theory, a particular mutation might have the effect of uncoupling the conformation of the cytoplasmic surface from that of the chromophore binding pocket. For example, an E134Q mutant has been shown to assume a partially activated conformation at the cytoplasmic surface while the chromophore and surrounding structures remain in the dark, inactive conformation (12.Kim J.M. Altenbach C. Thurmond R.L. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14273-14278Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This type of mutant might give misleading results, as photoregeneration (monitored by structural rearrangements surrounding the chromophore) could proceed unhindered, even as Gt or peptides bound normally to the cytoplasmic surface. The rhodopsin loop C4 mutants showed no evidence of any uncoupling between the chromophore-binding pocket and cytoplasmic surface conformations. All of the mutants showed similar photoregeneration kinetics in the absence of peptide (Fig. 4, black traces). This suggests that the effects of the mutations are localized to the cytoplasmic surface, and do not affect the photoregeneration process itself. However, the mutant E134R/R135E photoregenerated with kinetics that were distinctly different from that of rhodopsin (data not shown), and therefore was not considered further in this study. Of course, mutants could exist that would foil all assays that rely on the detection of binding events at the intracellular surface resulting from conformational changes that are induced elsewhere in the protein. The extra-MII assay commonly used for rhodopsin, and the GTP-induced agonist affinity shift assay extensively used for other G protein-coupled receptors have the same potential limitations and are much less sensitive and specific.Taken together, the results in the preceding paper (14.Marin E.P. Krishna A.G. Zvyaga T.A. Isele J. Siebert F. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1930-1936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and the biophysical analysis of selected rhodopsin mutants herein strongly suggest that the amino terminus of C4 plays an important role in Gt binding and activation. Both Gt and α(340–350) binding are disrupted when a tripeptide in this region is replaced by a sequence from the β2-AR (Fig. 5). The most straightforward interpretation of the data is that the amino-terminal region of loop C4 directly influences or is part of a direct binding site for the carboxyl-terminal tail of Gαt.It is surprising that CTr4, in which residues 310–312 are replaced with analogous sequence from the β2-AR, binds neither α(340–350) nor γ(50–71)-far. Can the two peptides bind to overlapping sites on the receptor, each of which includes the 310–312 region? This seems unlikely, because the carboxyl termini of Gαt and Gγt are located at a significant distance apart from each other in the structure of the heterotrimer (19.Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). Two potential explanations, which are not mutually exclusive, arise: 1) the peptides bind to different sites on the receptor and the sites are allosterically coupled; 2) Gt undergoes a large conformational change on contact with R* to bring the carboxyl termini of Gαt and Gγt into close proximity with the interaction domain near residues 310–312. A conformational switch in Gt, induced by the contact with R*, is an element of the “sequential fit” model (22.Kisselev O.G. Meyer C.K. Heck M. Ernst O.P. Hofmann K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4898-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and it may be identical to the switch in Gβγt that was suggested earlier (31.Kisselev O. Ermolaeva M. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25356-25358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).Possible Role of Gγt-farnesyl in Docking of Gt to the Active ReceptorThe relevance of the data to the binding site of Gβγt is more subtle. The observation that CTr2, but not CTr4, binds γ(50–71)-far highlights the complexity of the binding interaction between γ(50–71)-far and rhodopsin. Further evidence of this complexity, as noted above, is that γ(50–71)-far fails to fully inhibit the photoregeneration reaction, even at saturating concentrations. This behavior contrasts with that of α(340–350) (Fig. 2). In addition, both the farnesyl moiety and the peptide itself are required for binding to R* (Fig. 3). Each is likely to have a distinct binding site that may be differently altered in the mutants studied. The binding of γ(50–71)-far to CTr2, but not CTr4, suggests that the structural integrity of the fourth loop is disrupted by substitution of 310–312 with β2-AR sequence, but that the substitution of the entire loop restores the structural determinants required for γ(50–71)-far binding. In this scenario, the tertiary, but not necessarily the primary structure of C4 would be critical for γ(50–71)-far binding. We have recently provided direct evidence, based on monolayer expansion measurements, that both the farnesylated carboxyl terminus of Gγt and the myristoylated amino terminus of Gαt are involved in the membrane interaction of Gt (37.Seitz H.R. Heck M. Hofmann K.P. Alt T. Pellaud J. Seelig A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7950-7960Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Gγt-far plays a role in both membrane and receptor interactions of Gt. We hypothesize that opening of the fourth loop structure could guide the farnesylated carboxyl terminus of Gγt toward the receptor, thus ensuring the docking of Gt. By definition, such a process proceeds through predominantly hydrophobic interactions and avoids the need for Gt to “jump” onto the receptor via a transiently soluble intermediate state, which would slow the catalytic interaction (38.Liebman P.A. Parker K.R. Dratz E.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1987; 49: 765-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 39.Schleicher A. Hofmann K.P. J. Membr. Biol. 1987; 95: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Assuming a fundamentally similar G protein activation mechanism for rhodopsin and the β2-AR, it is conceivable that the intact tertiary fourth loop structure in the CTr2mutant has the capability to form a docking site for the γ-peptide from Gt.In summary, we developed a novel biophysical assay to probe the Gt-binding domain of rhodopsin and expressed rhodopsin. Gt and peptides corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal regions of Gαt and Gγt specifically bind to R* and stabilize the active state of the receptor. We conclude that the amino-terminal region of loop C4 acts as part of the binding site for Gαt and modulates the Gt-binding domain of R*. Future work is underway to reconcile the various models for allosteric regulation of the Gt-binding surface of R*, especially concerning the binding of Gβγt. This work will require the use of additional rhodopsin mutants and expressed G protein subunits. G protein-coupled receptors transmit extracellular signals to the cell's interior via heterotrimeric G proteins and effector enzymes or ion channels (1.Bourne H.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 2.Wess J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Rhodopsin is one of the archetypes of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. It triggers the biochemical amplification machinery of the visual cascade in the rod photoreceptor cell, which comprises the G protein transducin (Gt)1 and the effector, a cyclic GMP-specific phosphodiesterase (3.Sakmar T.P. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 4.Helmreich E.J. Hofmann K.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 285-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The transduction of a light signal begins with the photochemicalcis-trans isomerization of the chromophore, 11-cis-retinal. Protein conformational changes are transmitted from the ligand-binding site to the cytoplasmic surface of the receptor where catalytic activation of Gt occurs. This intramolecular conversion from inactive (rhodopsin) to active (R*) states mediated by chromophore isomerization has been termed “signal transmission” (5.Hofmann K.P. Goode J. Rhodopsins and Phototransduction. Wiley, Chichester, UK1999: 158-175Google Scholar). Key structural correlates of the transition to the active state include deprotonation of the retinylidene Schiff base (6.Longstaff C. Calhoon R.D. Rando R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The first (C1), second (C2), and third (C3) cytoplasmic loops connect adjacent TM helices. The fourth cytoplasmic loop (C4) is bounded by TM helix 7 at its amino terminus and two palmitoyl groups inserted into the membrane bilayer at its carboxyl terminus.

https://openalex.org/W2087917559,"Using a plasmid-based uracil-containing DNA substrate, we found that the long patch base excision repair (BER) activity of a wild-type mouse fibroblast extract was partially inhibited by an antibody to DNA polymerase β (β-pol). This suggests that β-pol participates in long patch BER, in addition to single-nucleotide BER. In single-nucleotide BER, the deoxyribose phosphate (dRP) in the abasic site is removed by the lyase activity of β-pol. Methoxyamine (MX) can react with the aldehyde of an abasic site, making it refractory to the β-elimination step of the dRP lyase mechanism, thus blocking single-nucleotide BER. MX exposure sensitizes wild-type, but not β-pol null mouse embryonic fibroblasts, to the cytotoxic effects of methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) and methylnitrosourea. Expression of β-pol in the null cells restores the ability of MX to modulate sensitivity to MMS. The β-pol null cells are known to be hypersensitive to MMS and methylnitrosourea, and in the presence of MX (i.e. under conditions where single-nucleotide BER is blocked) the null cells are still considerably more sensitive than wild-type. The data are consistent with a role of β-pol in long patch BER, which helps protect cells against methylation damage-induced cytotoxicity.

Recent evidence has indicated that BER in mammalian cells is mediated through at least two subpathways that are differentiated by the repair patch sizes and the enzymes involved and are designated as “single-nucleotide BER” and “long patch BER” (2–10- nucleotide patch) (1.Matsumoto Y.

Res. 1998; 407: 203-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The most simple single-nucleotide BER pathway is an ordered sequential process initiated by base excision by a monofunctional glycosylase. Removal of the deoxyribose phosphate (dRP) in the abasic site is by the dRP lyase activity of DNA polymerase β (β-pol) (4.Srivastava D.K. Vande Berg B.J. Prasad R. Molina J.T. Beard W.A. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21203-21209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Single-nucleotide BER of a uracil-containing oligonucleotide substrate can be reconstituted in vitro with four purified human proteins: uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG), apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE), β-pol, and DNA ligase I (4.Srivastava D.K.

In addition, genetic evidence with β-pol- and DNA ligase I-deficient mammalian cell lines indicates that these proteins are important for the repair of alkylating agent induced lesions (6.Sobol R.W.

Broughton B.C. Mutat. Res. 1983; 107: 371-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The choice of subpathway in BER (single-nucleotide or long patch) depends on whether the dRP intermediate can be efficiently removed by the β-pol lyase activity to yield a 5′-phosphorylated DNA strand capable of serving as a substrate for DNA ligase (4.Srivastava D.K.

Price A. Lindahl T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). When such processing is not efficient, for example during repair of a reduced abasic site, long patch BER can occur (9.Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been suggested that the properties of the damage-specific DNA glycosylase (e.g., monofunctional, exhibiting only glycosylase activity, or bifunctional, having glycosylase and β-lyase activity) can determine the BER subpathway (10.Fortini P. Parlanti E. Sidorkina O.M. Laval J. Dogliotti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15230-15236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). For BER studied in vitro, the two subpathways can co-repair the same type of DNA lesion and operate in the same extract (10.Fortini P. Parlanti E. Sidorkina O.M. Laval J. Dogliotti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15230-15236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 11.Fortini P. Pascucci B. Parlanti E. Sobol R.W. Wilson S.H. Dogliotti E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3575-3580Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). It is still unclear which enzymes are involved in vivo in the various BER subpathways. Biochemical and genetic evidence indicate that, in addition to those mentioned above, 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase, XRCC1, DNA ligase III, flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1), and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase are important proteins for BER and the repair of alkylating agent-induced lesions (9.Klungland A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2644-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). For single-nucleotide repair, β-pol is the polymerase of choice for the resynthesis step (6.Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kuhn R. Gu H. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar); however, β-pol-deficient extracts are able to perform single-nucleotide BER (11.Fortini P. Pascucci B. Parlanti E. Sobol R.W. Wilson S.H. Dogliotti E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3575-3580Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). For long patch BER, repair has been shown to be stimulated by proliferating cell nuclear antigen which has led to the suggestion that DNA polymerases δ and/or ε are involved (1.Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6187-6197Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 18.Stucki M. Pascucci B. Parlanti E. Fortini P. Wilson S.H. Hubscher U. Dogliotti E. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 835-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However, the role of proliferating cell nuclear antigen may be limited to stimulation of FEN1-dependent flap cleavage (19.Gary R. Kim K. Cornelius H.L. Park M.S. Matsumoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4354-4363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen can promote β-pol-dependent long patch repair by this mechanism (9.Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). There is additional evidence pointing to a role of β-pol in long patch repair DNA synthesis. For example, β-pol antibody was found to inhibit long patch repair mediated by cell extracts (9.Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar), and β-pol-deficient extracts were unable to repair a reduced AP site on a linear DNA substrate that could be repaired by wild-type extracts (20.Biade S. Sobol R.W. Wilson S.H. Matsumoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 898-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Additionally, recent data indicate that β-pol plays an essential role in the strand displacement synthesis of long patch BER (21.Dianov G.L. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13741-13743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 22.Prasad R. Dianov G.L. Bohr V.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol.

In this paper, we describe further analysis of the role of β-pol in BER and dissect the contribution of β-pol in protecting cells against the cytotoxic effects of simple methylating agents. Using wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblast cell extracts, we find that repair of a plasmid-based uracil-containing BER substrate by long patch BER is partially blocked by an antibody to β-pol. Thus, this extract is capable of both β-pol-dependent and β-pol-independent long patch BER, in addition to the single-nucleotide BER we have described previously (6.Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kuhn R. Gu H. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). We also examined the cellular phenotype of a β-pol-dependent long patch BER deficiency in mouse fibroblast cells. First, single-nucleotide BER was chemically blocked by methoxyamine (MX), and then the effect of β-pol gene deletion on cellular sensitivity to DNA-alkylating agents was examined. The results demonstrate a role of β-pol-dependent long patch BER in protection of cells against the cytoxicity of the monofunctional DNA-alkylating agents methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) and methylnitrosourea (MNU).

Primary Xpa+/− and Xpa−/− isogenic mouse embryonic fibroblasts (28.de Vries A. van Steeg H. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1996; 7: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) were obtained from Dr. Harry van Steeg (National Institute of Public Health and Environmental Protection, Bilthoven, The Netherlands). These cells were transformed with SV40 T antigen as described for the wild-type and β-pol null fibroblasts (6.Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kuhn R. Gu H. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Transformed Xpa fibroblasts were routinely grown at 34 °C in a 10% CO2 incubator in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, minimal essential medium non-essential amino acids, and hygromycin (80 μg/ml). All cells were routinely tested and found to be free of mycoplasma contamination. For the long patch BER assay, wild-type mouse fibroblast cells were cultured in 150-mm dishes until near-confluent, washed three times with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Life Technologies, Inc.), and harvested by scraping. Approximately 5 × 107 cells were suspended in 1 ml of buffer (5 mm NaPO4, pH 7.1, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl) plus protease inhibitors, aprotinin (10 μg/ml), leupeptin (0.5 μg/ml), and Pefabloc SC (10 μg/ml) supplied by Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The suspension was subjected to five cycles of freeze/thaw and further disrupted by sequential passage through 18- and 22-gauge needles. The resulting homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fraction was removed, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay dye reagent. For the AP endonuclease assay, cell extracts were prepared from wild-type mouse fibroblasts as described previously (20.Biade S. Sobol R.W. Wilson S.H. Matsumoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 898-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). A partially duplex oligonucleotide was formed by annealing a phosphorylated 12-mer (5′-ACCGGTACUGGC-3′) containing a uracil residue at position 9 and a 20-mer (5′-ACGTGCCGGTACCGGTCTAG-3′). The 12-mer (6 nmol) and 20-mer (6 nmol) were mixed in 30 μl of buffer containing 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, heated to 98 °C for 3 min, and then slowly cooled to room temperature. The annealed oligonucleotide duplex was purified by precipitation, washed twice with 70% ethanol, and resuspended in 30 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA. An aliquot of this DNA was analyzed by 20% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to confirm that annealing had occurred. The closed circular DNA substrate containing a unique G:U base pair was constructed according to a previously described procedure (29.Sandigursky M. Freyer G.A. Franklin W.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1282-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, pUC19 plasmid (500 μg) was digested with PstI (750 units) overnight at 37 °C, and the reaction was checked for complete linearization by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. The reaction mixture was diluted with five volumes of Qiagen binding buffer, and the plasmid was purified using a Qiagen-tip 500. The purified PstI-linearized pUC19 plasmid DNA (300 pmol) was ligated to the G:U base pair-containing oligonucleotide duplex (800 pmol) in a 2-ml reaction mixture containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 2 mm ATP, 800 units of PstI, and 250 units of T4 DNA ligase at 15 °C overnight. The ligation product was purified using a Qiagen-tip 500 as described above and 5′-phosphorylated in a reaction mixture (500 μl) containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 mm ATP, 600 units ofBamHI, and 250 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase for 3 h at 37 °C. After purification by Qiagen-tip 500, the DNA was circularized at 15 °C overnight in a 5-ml reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP, 750 units of BamHI, 750 units ofBglII, and 300 units of T4 DNA ligase. The reaction product was precipitated with three volumes of ethanol, washed twice with 70% ethanol, and resuspended in 500 μl of H2O. The circular DNA substrate was separated from linear DNA by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis. A small portion (1 μl) of the sample was electrophoresed as a marker in a separate lane. This marker, but not the preparative sample, was visualized by UV light, to minimize UV/ethidium bromide-induced nicking of the DNA substrate. The closed circular DNA substrate was isolated by electroelution and purified using a Qiagen polymerase chain reaction purification kit. The product was eluted in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and DNA was quantified using Hoechst 33258 dye. BER assays were performed in a reaction mixture (11 μl) that contained 5 μg of cell extract, 1 nm closed circular DNA substrate, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm diTris-phosphocreatine, 10 units of creatine phosphokinase, 4 mm ATP, 0.5 mmNAD, 4 μm [α-32P]dCTP (specific activity 1 × 106 DPM/pmol), and 4 μm each dATP, TTP, and dGTP. Alternatively, 4 μm[α-32P]dATP (specific activity 1 × 106 DPM/pmol) was included as the labeled nucleoside triphosphate with 4 μm each of the remaining three unlabeled nucleoside triphosphates. After incubation at 37 °C for 60 min, the reactions were stopped by adding 1.5 μl of 0.5 mEDTA. The samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform, and the DNA was purified using a MicroSpin S-400 HR column and ethanol precipitation. The DNA samples were resuspended in 8 μl of H2O, and repair was assessed by digestion with eitherHaeIII alone or with SphI + NcoI (10 units each) at 37 °C overnight. Samples were then electrophoresed on a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Radiolabeled products were quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager 450 and ImageQuant software. A 49-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide containing a uracil residue at position 21 (5.Prasad R. Singhal R.K. Srivastava D.K. Molina J.T. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson S.H. J. Biol.

The radiolabeled oligodeoxynucleotide was lyophilized, resuspended in H2O, and stored at −30 °C. 32P-Labeled uracil containing duplex DNA (62.5 nm) was pretreated with 10 nm UDG for 20 min at 37 °C in 100 μl of buffer containing 70 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mm DTT. The reaction mixture was then supplemented with 10 mm MgCl2and APE, either 5 nm (for normal AP-DNA) or 100 nm (for MX-adducted DNA) and the incubation continued for an additional 20 min at 37 °C. To prepare MX-adducted substrate, the32P-labeled UDG-treated duplex oligonucleotide was mixed with 33 mm MX in buffer containing 50 mmKPO4, pH 7.1 and incubated at 37 °C. After 30 min, the DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation, lyophilized, resuspended in water, and stored at −30 °C. AP endonuclease activity was assayed in a reaction mixture (10 μl) containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, and 20 nm32P-labeled MX-adducted DNA. The reaction was initiated by adding the indicated concentrations of purified APE or cell extract, and incubation was at 37 °C. Samples were withdrawn at the indicated time periods. The reaction was terminated by transfer to 0–1 °C, and the DNA product was stabilized by addition of NaBH4 to a final concentration of 340 mm and incubating 30 min on ice. The stabilized DNA products were recovered by ethanol precipitation in the presence of 0.1 μg/ml tRNA and resuspended in 10 μl of gel loading buffer (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.02% bromphenol blue, and 0.02% xylene cyanol). Alternatively, the reactions were terminated without product stabilization by the addition of an equal volume of gel loading buffer. After incubation at 75 °C for 2 min, the reaction products were separated by electrophoresis in a 20% polyacrylamide gel containing 8m urea in 89 mm Tris-HCl, 89 mmboric acid, and 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.8, and visualized by autoradiography. To quantify the product, the gel was scanned on a PhosphorImager 450 and the data were analyzed using ImageQuant software. dRP lyase activity was performed in a reaction mixture (10 μl) containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, and 20 nm pre-incised 32P-labeled normal AP-DNA or MX-adducted DNA. The reaction was initiated by adding β-pol (0–25 nm as indicated) and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The reaction was terminated by transfer to 0–1 °C, and the DNA product was stabilized by addition of NaBH4 as described above. The stabilized DNA products were processed as described above and visualized by autoradiography. The excision reaction was reconstituted in a reaction mixture (10 μl) that contained 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm ATP, 20 μm each dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and TTP, and APE-preincised 32P-labeled duplex oligonucleotide substrate (20 nm). The reaction was initiated by adding 20 nm FEN1 and β-pol, as indicated in the figure legend. Incubation was at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by transfer to 0–1 °C, and the DNA product was stabilized by addition of NaBH4 as described above. The stabilized DNA product was recovered by ethanol precipitation, separated by electrophoresis, and visualized by autoradiography. Cytotoxicity was determined by growth inhibition assays. It has been shown previously that SV40-transformed mouse embryonic fibroblasts grow logarithmically and at similar rates under the conditions of the assay (6.Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kuhn R. Gu H. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at a density of 40,000 cells/well in six-well dishes. The following day, they were exposed for 1 h to a range of concentrations of MMS or MNU in growth medium without hygromycin. MMS was dissolved directly in the medium. A stock solution of MNU was freshly-prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide and dissolved in medium at the time of the experiment. After 1 h, the cells were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution and fresh medium was added. For UV irradiation (254 nm), cell monolayers were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution before UV exposure (0–20 J/m2) in a Stratalinker model 1800 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), followed by addition of growth medium. Dishes were incubated for 4–5 days at 34 °C in a 10% CO2 incubator until untreated control cells were approximately 80% confluent. Cells (triplicate wells for each drug concentration) were counted by a cell lysis procedure (30.Butler W.B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 141: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and results were expressed as the number of cells in drug-treated wells relative to cells in control wells (% control growth). The IC50 and IC90 values (defined as the concentration of agent required for 50% or 90% growth inhibition compared with untreated controls) were determined from concentration-percentage of growth inhibition curves. Cytotoxicity studies were also conducted in the presence of MX. A stock solution of MX (1–5 m in phosphate-buffered saline) was prepared immediately before use and NaOH added to achieve neutral pH. MX stock solution was added to the volume of medium required for the experiment, and the pH was re-adjusted to 7.2 by further addition of NaOH. Dilutions of MMS or MNU were prepared in the MX-containing medium, and cells were dosed as described above. In certain experiments, cells were further incubated in MX-medium for up to 7 h following the 1-h alkylating agent exposure. We used a plasmid-based uracil-containing DNA substrate (see “Experimental Procedures”) that allows simultaneous quantification of repair by the single-nucleotide and long patch subpathways of BER. Conditions were standardized to measure the efficiency (k cat/K m,DNA) of BER and involved using a limiting concentration of DNA and saturating or near-saturating concentrations of dNTP for both single-nucleotide and long patch BER subpathways. Restriction enzyme and electrophoretic analysis of BER products formed with [α-32P]dCTP as the labeled nucleoside triphosphate indicated that the level of dCMP incorporation by wild-type cell extract into the first nucleotide of the repair patch (SphI + NcoI fragment) was similar to dCMP incorporation into the first two nucleotides of the repair patch (HaeIII fragment; Fig.1 A). In the HaeIII fragment, the ratio of dCMP incorporation (first and second nucleotide):dAMP incorporation (third nucleotide) was approximately 10:1 (data not shown). Thus, as expected from earlier work (11.Fortini P. Pascucci B. Parlanti E. Sobol R.W. Wilson S.H. Dogliotti E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3575-3580Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), single-nucleotide BER of uracil-DNA was predominant over long patch BER in a wild-type cell extract. In the experiment shown in Fig. 1 B, it was found that the combined short and long patch BER activity of the wild-type extract (incorporation of labeled dCTP into position 1 and 2 of the repair patch) as well as long patch BER activity (incorporation of labeled dATP into position 3) were both partially inhibited by a neutralizing antibody to β-pol. Non-immune serum from the same rabbit was used in control incubations and did not inhibit single-nucleotide or long patch BER activity (data not shown). These results indicate clearly that a portion of long patch BER activity measured in the wild-type cell extract is dependent upon β-pol (≈75%). Taken together, these results indicate that in addition to a role in single-nucleotide BER, β-pol also participates in long patch BER in mouse fibroblast extracts. The primary amine of MX is capable of reacting with the aldehydic C1′ atom of the abasic site, as illustrated in Scheme FS1. The Schiff base intermediate produced after MX attack on the C1′ atom spontaneously resolves into the stably adducted sugar molecule. Therefore, MX treatment will render the abasic site refractory to the β-elimination step involved in the dRP lyase activity of β-pol. This property of the MX-adducted abasic site DNA is confirmed by the experiments illustrated in Fig. 2. Using the duplex oligonucleotide substrates shown in Fig. 2 A, the dRP lyase activity of β-pol could be detected on a APE-cleaved normal AP site, resulting in a 29-mer product (Fig. 2 B,lanes 5 and 6), but not on a pre-incised MX-adducted AP site (lanes 2 and3). We conclude that MX is capable of chemical deletion of single-nucleotide BER that depends upon elimination of the dRP moiety in the"

To identify molecular interaction partners of these trigger proteins on the cell, we combined covalent protein cross-linking with mass spectrometry based methods for peptide mapping and primary structure analysis of electrophoretically isolated protein conjugates. A specific tri-molecular complex was observed upon addition of pro-urokinase to human U937 cells. This complex included the urokinase receptor, pro-urokinase, and an unknown, high molecular weight urokinase receptor-associated protein. The tryptic peptide mixture derived from a cross-linked complex of pro-urokinase and the latter protein was analyzed by nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometric sequencing. This analysis identified the novel protein as the human homologue of a murine membrane-bound lectin with hitherto unknown function. The human cDNA was cloned and sequenced. The protein, designated uPARAP, is a member of the macrophage mannose receptor protein family and contains a putative collagen-binding (fibronectin type II) domain in addition to 8 C-type carbohydrate recognition domains. It proved capable of binding strongly to a single type of collagen, collagen V. This collagen binding reaction at the exact site of plasminogen activation on the cell may lead to adhesive functions as well as a contribution to cellular degradation of collagen matrices.

These processes take place in a number of distinct physiological events in the healthy organism, such as trophoblast invasion, mammary gland involution, and skin wound healing, but also represent a crucial step in cancer invasion and metastasis (1.Johnsen M. Lund L.R. Rømer J. Almholt K. Danø K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 667-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The plasminogen activation system has an important position among the extracellular proteases engaged in these degradation reactions (2.Danø K. Andreasen P.A. Grøndahl-Hansen J. Kristensen P. Nielsen L.S. Skriver L. Adv. Cancer Res. 1985; 44: 139-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (2289) Google Scholar). This system is organized as a proteolytic cascade with active proteases and their pro-enzymes, protease inhibitors, and cellular and extracellular binding proteins. The urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA)1 has a trigger role in the system in the ability to release the large proteolytic potential of active plasmin from the abundant pro-enzyme, plasminogen. uPA and its pro-enzyme, pro-uPA, become localized at discrete areas on specific cell types by the interaction with the urokinase receptor (uPAR). This receptor serves to concentrate proteolytic activity at areas of cell substratum contact and furthermore participates in a complicated activation-acceleration mechanism in conjunction with plasminogen-binding components on the cell. Recent reviews provide details on the molecular and functional properties of the uPA-uPAR system and its role in extracellular matrix degradation (3.Andreasen P.A. Kjøller L. Christensen L. Duffy M.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1435) Google Scholar, 4.Behrendt N. Stephens R.W. Fibrinolysis Proteolysis. 1998; 12: 191-204Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It is generally considered that the major function of the uPA-plasmin system is directed against fibrin and the noncollagen constituents of the extracellular matrix (2.Danø K. Andreasen P.A. Grøndahl-Hansen J. Kristensen P. Nielsen L.S. Skriver L. Adv. Cancer Res. 1985; 44: 139-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (2289) Google Scholar, 5.Bugge T.H. Kombrinck K.W. Flick M.J. Daugherty C.C.

Collen D. Degen J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5899-5904Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), whereas collagen degradation is undertaken mainly by the collagenase and gelatinase members of the matrix metalloprotease (MMP) family (7.Goldfarb R.H. Liotta L.A. Semin. Thromb. Hemost. 1986; 12: 294-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). On the other hand it is also clear that these proteolytic systems can cooperate in some cases, an important example being the plasmin-mediated activation of some MMP proenzymes (8.Murphy G. Atkinson S. Ward R. Gavrilovic J. Reynolds J.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 667: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and the coordinated organization of some of these activation reactions on cell surfaces where uPAR seems to play an important role (9.Mazzieri R. Masiero L. Zanetta L. Monea S. Onisto M. Garbisa S. Mignatti P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2319-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). During recent years evidence has accumulated that uPAR also takes part in other protein interactions, relevant not only to proteolysis but also to cell adhesion and signal transduction. uPAR thus binds to vitronectin (10.Wei Y. Waltz D.A. Rao N. Drummond R.J. Rosenberg S. Chapman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32380-32388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it has been proposed that this interaction takes part in a balanced attachment and release scenario, directed by the plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1, which competes with uPAR in the vitronectin binding process (11.Deng G. Curriden S.A. Wang S. Rosenberg S. Loskutoff D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). A further, indirect, role of uPAR in adhesion is provided by interactions with certain integrins, influencing the binding properties of the latter (12.Wei Y. Lukashev M. Simon D.I. Bodary S.C. Rosenberg S. Doyle M.V. Chapman H.A. Science. 1996; 273: 1551-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). In some cell types, intracellular protein tyrosine phosphorylation has been observed as a function of ligand binding to uPAR in processes that seem unrelated to proteolysis but that require interactions with unidentified, actively signal transducing membrane proteins (13.Resnati M. Guttinger M. Valcamonica S. Sidenius N. Blasi F. Fazioli F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1572-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Common to most or all of the functions of uPAR is thus the necessity of interactions with other proteins on the cell surface. This fact has focused the interest on the identification of the interaction partners of uPAR on the cell. We have previously demonstrated a uPAR-dependent interaction between pro-uPA and a specific high molecular weight protein expressed by the monocyte-like cell line, U937 (14.Behrendt N. Rønne E. Danø K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 394-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the present work we have used a novel analytical approach that combines protein cross-linking and mass spectrometry to identify the interacting molecules in this protein complex. Following this strategy we have characterized the uPAR-associated membrane protein, cloned its cDNA, and identified a strongly binding ligand in the extracellular matrix. Human pro-uPA and human vitronectin were the generous gifts of Dr. J. Henkin (Abbott Laboratories, IL) and Dr. K. T. Preissner (Kerckhoff-Klinik, Bad Nauheim, Germany), respectively. Pro-uPA was labeled with 125I as described (15.Behrendt N. Rønne E. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22885-22894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The following purified proteins were purchased from commercial sources: human collagens of types I, III, IV, and V and bacterial collagenase type III from Clostridium histolyticum (Calbiochem, Band Soden, Germany), tissue transglutaminase from guinea pig liver and artificially glycosylated albumin derivatives (Sigma). Monoclonal antibodies, mAb 5 and 6 against human uPA, mAb R2 and R3 against human uPAR, and a control mAb against trinitrophenol were from clones described previously (16.Nielsen L.S.

FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Cells of the promyeloid histiocytic cell line U937 were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, and 5% fetal calf serum. Vascular smooth muscle cells from human aorta were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (product specification CRL-1999). These cells were grown in Ham's F-12K medium supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mmTES, 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid, 10% fetal calf serum, and the following growth supplement mixtures: insulin-transferrin-selenite (Sigma product I-1884, providing final concentrations of 10 μg/ml bovine insulin, 10 μg/ml human transferrin, and 10 ng/ml sodium selenite, respectively), and endothelial cell growth factor supplement mixture (Sigma product E-9640, used at a final 100-fold dilution). Assays for binding and cross-linking of 125I-labeled pro-uPA by enzymatic or chemical methods were done as described (14.Behrendt N. Rønne E. Danø K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 394-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were suspended at a density of 5 × 106 cells/ml in binding buffer (50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), pH 7.4) and incubated at 4 °C with 1.5 nm of125I-labeled pro-uPA. After washing the cells, enzymatic cross-linking was performed by addition of tissue transglutaminase to a final concentration of 20 μg/ml and incubation for 30 min at 37 °C. For chemical cross-linking, the samples were treated with 2 mm of N,N′-disuccinimidylsuberate (DSS) for 15 min at room temperature instead of the transglutaminase incubation step. In some experiments, potential competitor proteins were included at specific reaction steps as indicated. The cells were washed again and lysed in lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline with 1% CHAPS, 10 mm EDTA). Before electrophoretic analysis, lysates were clarified by centrifugation. As a positive control for transglutaminase activity in the presence of the competitor proteins investigated, the enzyme was tested for its capability to form cross-linked vitronectin conjugates (19.Sane D.C. Moser T.L. Parker C.J. Seiffert D. Loskutoff D.J. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3543-3548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For this purpose, human vitronectin (final concentration, 400 μg/ml) was dissolved in 0.1m Tris/HCl, 6 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 20 μg/ml of tissue transglutaminase and the potential competitor proteins indicated. The reaction was stopped by addition of 20 mm of EDTA, after which the formation of covalent vitronectin conjugates was demonstrated by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. For preparative enzymatic cross-linking, U937 cells were cultivated in the presence of 1 mm of dibutyryl-cAMP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 48 h and subjected to a brief pretreatment with glycine buffer at pH 3.0 to release endogenous uPA, as described (20.Behrendt N. Ploug M. Rønne E. Høyer-Hansen G. Danø K. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 223: 207-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The transglutaminase-mediated pro-uPA cross-linking was performed as above except that unlabeled pro-uPA (20 nm) was used instead of the labeled protein and that 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonylfluoride was added to the lysis buffer. The clarified lysate of 6 × 109 cells was applied on a column with immobilized anti-uPA clone 5 (16.Nielsen L.S. Grøndahl-Hansen J. Andreasen P.A. Skriver L. Zeuthen J. Danø K. J. Immunoassay. 1986; 7: 209-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), which was subsequently washed with a series of washing buffers (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% CHAPS and NaCl concentrations of 140, 1000, and 50 mm, respectively). The column was eluted with elution buffer (0.1 m acetic acid, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.05% CHAPS, pH 2.5). Eluate fractions were immediately titrated to pH 7.4 by addition of the appropriate volume of 1 m Tris/HCl, pH 9.0. For concentration of the eluted protein, 3 ml of the neutralized eluate was mixed with 12 ml of methanol, followed by addition of 3 ml of chloroform and 9 ml of H2O to induce phase separation. After thorough mixing, the lower (chloroform) phase was collected by centrifugation. The 3-ml chloroform phase was then mixed with another 9 ml of methanol, after which the precipitated protein was pelleted by renewed centrifugation. The pellet was dried and redissolved by boiling for 2 min in 250 μl of solubilization buffer (12.5 mmTris/HCl, pH 6.8, 1% sodium dodecylsulfate, 2% glycerol, 0.005% bromphenol blue) followed by concentration of the sample to 50 μl by Speed-vac centrifugation. Prior to preparative SDS-PAGE, this sample was boiled for 3 min in the presence of 2 mm EDTA and 20 mm dithiothreitol for reduction of disulfides, followed by addition of iodoacetamide (50 mm) for sulfhydryl alkylation. SDS-PAGE was performed on a 7.5% gel that was stained with Coomassie Blue R250 after electrophoresis. For in-gel digestion, sample preparation of electrophoretically isolated protein was performed as described (21.Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7736) Google Scholar,22.Jensen O.N. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1997: 29-57Google Scholar). The protein band corresponding to the cross-linked protein conjugate was excised from the gel, washed, in-gel reduced,S-alkylated with iodoacetamide, and in-gel digested with an excess of bovine trypsin (sequencing grade, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 37 °C overnight. Peptides were extracted, dried in a vacuum centrifuge, and resolubilized in 20 μl of 5% formic acid prior to mass spectrometry analysis. Mass spectrometric peptide mapping was performed using 0.5-μl aliquots of the tryptic peptide mixture. The samples were analyzed by MALDI mass spectrometry on a Bruker REFLEX reflector time-of-flight mass spectrometer equipped with the SCOUT multiprobe inlet and a gridless delayed extraction ion source (Bruker-Franzen, Bremen, Germany) as described (23.Jensen O.N. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 10: 1371-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Monoisotopic peptide masses were assigned and used in protein sequence data base searches (24.Shevchenko A. Jensen O.N. Podtelejnikov A.V. Sagliocco F. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mortensen P. Boucherie H. Mann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14440-14445Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). Individual components of the protein conjugate were identified by iterative sequence data base searches (25.Jensen O.N. Podtelejnikov A.V. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1997; 69: 4741-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). For peptide sequencing, the desalted and concentrated peptide mixture derived from the cross-linked protein conjugate was analyzed by nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry (26.Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotsis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar). Spectral interpretation was aided by performing the tryptic digestion in buffer containing 18O labeled water or by O-methylesterification of free carboxyl group (27.Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Mann M. J. Protein Chem. 1997; 16: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Partial or complete amino acid sequences obtained this way were used to query biological sequence data bases. Peptide sequence tags (28.Mann M. Wilm M. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 4390-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar) were used for searching protein and expressed sequence tag data banks. Homology searches were performed using the BLAST algorithm (29.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68368) Google Scholar). Partial cDNA sequences encoding a human homologue of the murine mmu56734 product were identified by BLAST searches (29.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68368) Google Scholar) in GenBankTM and the GenBankTM expressed sequence tag division, using mmu56734 as the input sequence. Three such sequences identified, GenBankTM entries hsu58856, w25147, and w16810, were used to design primers to enable the RT-PCR based cloning of three overlapping human sequences (nucleotides 1–994, 77–3914, and 3775–4700, respectively, referring to the numbering of the subsequently cloned full-length cDNA, GenBankTMaccession number AF107292). RT-PCR with U937 cell RNA and cloning of PCR products were done using commercial kits and procedures recommended by the manufacturers. For preparation of RNA, U937 cells were washed twice followed by quick freezing on ethanol/dry ice. Total RNA was isolated using the “RNeasy Mini Kit” (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). 1 μg of total RNA was then used to generate each PCR fragment. For the larger (central) fragment, the initial single strand synthesis was done using oligo(dT)15 primer and the “Reverse Transciption System A3500” (Promega, Madison, WI). The resulting DNA was precipitated and employed for PCR using the “Expand Long Template PCR System” (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), buffer system number 3, and the primers, 5′-GCCTCGTCACCTGCTGCGCTGCG-3′ (upstream) and 5′-CCTCCTTGTGGCCCAGCAGCAGC-3′ (downstream), respectively. After a 2-min denaturation step at 94 °C, 10 cycles were run with denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 65 °C for 30 s, and extension at 68 °C for 4 min, followed by an additional 30 cycles with extension periods increasing 7 s in each cycle. The two smaller fragments were generated using the “Titan One Tube RT-PCR System” (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with the following primers: 5′-GTGCGCCCTCGGTCCCCGCG-3′ (5′ fragment, upstream primer), 5′-GAGGGGCGAGTTGTCCGACCAATG-3′ (5′ fragment, downstream primer), 5′-GGTTAGCAGTGGGCCCCCTCCTCC-3′ (3′ fragment, upstream primer) and 5′-CCACGGTGCACTCAGCTGGGTCTC-3′ (3′ fragment, downstream primer). The samples were incubated for reverse transcription at 45 °C for 1 h, followed by denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min. The first 10 PCR cycles were run using denaturation at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and extension at 68 °C for 3 min, after which 30 cycles were run with extension periods increasing 3 s in each cycle. A final 7-min elongation step was included. PCR products were gel purified and cloned using the TOPO TA cloning system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). For assembly of the full-length clone, the 5′ fragment was ligated to the major fragment using a unique KpnI restriction site in the overlapping region. Assembly of the resulting DNA with the 3′ fragment was done by splicing by overlap extension PCR (30.Horton R.M. Cai Z.L. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar), because no unique restriction site existed in the overlapping region in this case. The resulting clone contained the complete coding region (as verified by comparison with the mmu56734 sequence and reading frame analysis of the obtained sequence). This DNA was sequenced on both strands by custom sequencing, (Microsynth, Balgach, Switzerland), using primer walking. The open reading frame of the sequence thus obtained proved identical with a novel GenBankTM sequence entry, accession codeAB014609, except for five nucleotide positions. Four of these mismatches were due to errors introduced by our RT-PCR as shown by sequencing of new, shorter RT-PCR products, whereas the fifth mismatch was confirmed but constituted a silent substitution. SDS-PAGE (31.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) was performed on slab gels using reduced and alkylated samples. The following assays were performed as described previously: Inhibition of chemical ligand cross-linking to purified recombinant soluble uPAR (15.Behrendt N. Rønne E. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22885-22894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), immunoprecipitation (20.Behrendt N. Ploug M. Rønne E. Høyer-Hansen G. Danø K.

FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). To demonstrate various interactions of pro-uPA with proteins on the cell surface, we added the radiolabeled proenzyme to human U937 cells and subjected the samples to protein cross-linking by different methods (Fig. 1 A). Chemical cross-linking with DSS, an amino-directed homobifunctional cross-linker, led to the formation of an M r∼100,000 labeled protein conjugate (lane 1), known from several studies to represent ligand labeling of uPAR ofM r 55,000 (32.Nielsen L.S.

In contrast, enzymatic cross-linking using tissue transglutaminase led to the labeling of an unknown protein of M r ∼200,000, as reflected by the formation of an M r ∼250,000 conjugate with pro-uPA (lane 3). The latter conjugate has also been observed previously, including the following findings: (a) This product does not include uPAR in the covalent complex according to Western blotting experiments; (b) the reaction of pro-uPA with the unknown protein is nevertheless uPAR-dependent as pretreatment of the cells with specific uPAR-blocking reagents abolishes the enzymatic cross-linking reaction; and (c) there is a strong selectivity for the pro-form of uPA as little or no high molecular weight conjugate is formed when active two-chain uPA or diisopropylfluorophosphate-inactivated two-chain uPA is used instead of pro-uPA (14.Behrendt N. Rønne E. Danø K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 394-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The same cross-linking experiment was performed with human vascular smooth muscle cells instead of U937 cells. Also with this cell type, uPAR and the high molecular weight conjugate could both be demonstrated (Fig. 1 A, lanes 4 and 6, respectively). These findings suggested that, at least with these cell types, pro-uPA, uPAR and the unknown protein take part in a common noncovalent complex on the cell surface. The selectivity of the two cross-linking techniques opened the possibility to visualize any ternary complex present by combination of the two methods. Indeed, when pro-uPA cross-linking with transglutaminase was followed by a second cross-linking step with DSS on otherwise unmodified U937 cells, a labeled adduct was formed that had a higher apparentM r than that formed with transglutaminase alone (Fig. 1 B, lane 2). This product was not formed if the enzymatic cross-linking step was omitted (lane 8). The presence of uPAR in this latter conjugate was confirmed by immunoprecipitation. Thus, the product could be immunoprecipitated using a monoclonal antibody (mAb R2) against human uPAR (lane 6), whereas no labeled product was precipitated with an irrelevant antibody (lane 4). Furthermore, the conjugate formed by enzymatic cross-linking alone, consisting of pro-uPA and the unknown protein, was also immunoprecipitated with the anti-uPAR antibody (lane 5), indicating that uPAR was (noncovalently) associated with this product even in the absence of chemical cross-linking. The hypothesis of a uPAR-containing complex was further tested by addition of antibodies to intact cells on which the enzymatic pro-uPA cross-linking had been carried out. After washing and lysing the cells, the labeled complexes were then precipitated without any further addition of antibody, using protein A-Sepharose alone (Fig.1 C). The antibody R2 against human uPAR recognized a protein complex that included the high molecular weight protein and that was sufficiently stable to persist after cell lysis and protein A precipitation (panel I, lane 2). This product was still precipitated after cell lysis in the presence of an excess (400 nm) of unlabeled uPA (panel III), excluding the possibility that the complex arose from a secondary binding reaction between uPAR and pro-uPA after solubilization of the plasma membrane. In contrast, the same concentration of uPA completely blocked complex formation when added from the start of the experiment (panel II). The specificity of the precipitation experiment was tested by the inclusion of other antibodies. No labeled product was precipitated when the cells had been incubated with an irrelevant antibody (anti-trinitrophenol, lane 4) or an anti-uPAR antibody (mAb R3) that only recognizes the uncomplexed receptor (18.Rønne E. Behrendt N. Ellis V. Ploug M. Danø K. Høyer-Hansen G. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) (lane 3). Together, these experiments demonstrated the existence of a trimolecular complex on the pro-uPA-treated cells, consisting of pro-uPA itself, uPAR, and the unknown high molecular weight uPAR-associated protein that we tentatively designated uPARAP. Enzymatic cross-linking to pro-uPA was used to provide a tag for purification of uPARAP. Pilot studies indicated that, whereas cells grown under standard conditions as shown in Fig. 1 were convenient for a qualitative demonstration of the protein conjugate, a 3–4-fold increase in the yield of the cross-linked product could be achieved by stimulation of the U937 cells with cAMP for 48 h before the cross-linking assay (result not shown). Consequently, cAMP-stimulated U937 cells were incubated with 20 nm of unlabeled pro-uPA and subjected to transglutaminase-mediated cross-linking. A detergent lysate of the cells was then used for immunoaffinity chromatography on a column with immobilized antibody (mAb clone 5) against human pro-uPA. The eluate from the immunoaffinity column was concentrated and subjected to preparative SDS-PAGE (Fig.2 A, inset). A sharp band with an electrophoretic mobility identical with that noted above for the high molecular weight protein conjugate was observed, in addition to a large amount of unconjugated pro-uPA. The high molecular weight product was excised from the gel and was unambiguously identified as the cross-linked pro-uPA conjugate by two independent means: (a) the corresponding electrophoretic band was reactive with antibodies against human pro-uPA in Western blotting, even when employing an antibody (mAb clone 6) different from the one used for immunopurification (result not shown) and (b) a high accuracy MALDI mass spectrum obtained from a tryptic peptide mixture derived from the Coomassie-stained protein band displayed more than 30 peptide signals (Fig. 2 A). Nine of these signals could be assigned to human pro-uPA tryptic peptides (TableI).Table IMass spectrometry analysis of unseparated tryptic peptide mixtures derived from the electrophoretically isolated cross-linked complex consisting of pro-uPA and uPARAPMethodM measM calcΔMPositionAmino acid sequencePro-uPA M934.458934.487−0.029404–411DKPGVYTR M1153.6401153.640aPeptide masses used for internal mass calibration.0.000412–420VSHFLPWIR M1219.5721219.639−0.067"

This interaction involves the cytoplasmic surface of rhodopsin, which comprises four putative loops and the carboxyl-terminal tail. The fourth loop connects the carboxyl end of transmembrane helix 7 with Cys322 and Cys323, which are both modified by membrane-inserted palmitoyl groups. Published data on the roles of the fourth loop in the binding and activation of Gt are contradictory. Here, we attempt to reconcile these conflicts and define a role for the fourth loop in rhodopsin-Gt interactions. Fluorescence experiments demonstrated that a synthetic peptide corresponding to the fourth loop of rhodopsin inhibited the activation of Gt by rhodopsin and interacted directly with the α subunit of Gt. A series of rhodopsin mutants was prepared in which portions of the fourth loop were replaced with analogous sequences from the β2-adrenergic receptor or the m1 muscarinic receptor. Chimeric receptors in which residues 310–312 were replaced could not efficiently activate Gt. The defect in Gtinteraction in the fourth loop mutants was not affected by preventing palmitoylation of Cys322 and Cys323. We suggest that the amino terminus of the fourth loop interacts directly with Gt, particularly with Gαt, and with other regions of the intracellular surface of rhodopsin to support Gt binding.

Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 2.Helmreich E.J. Hofmann K.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 285-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Following exposure to light, rhodopsin assumes an active signaling conformation, metarhodopsin II (MII). MII can bind and catalytically activate the retinal heterotrimeric G protein, transducin (Gt). Gt is composed of a guanine-nucleotide binding α subunit (Gαt), and a functional heterodimer of β and γ subunits (Gβγt). Interaction of the trimer with MII promotes the release of GDP from Gαt, leading to the formation of a stable MII-Gαt(empty pocket) complex. The subsequent binding of GTP activates Gαt, leading to its dissociation from the receptor and from Gβγt. The activated Gαt binds and activates its effector, cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase. The molecular structure of the complex between rhodopsin and Gt, and the mechanism by which rhodopsin catalyzes nucleotide exchange, are not understood in detail. Numerous studies have localized the Gt-binding site to the cytoplasmic surface of rhodopsin. The cytoplasmic surface is composed of four loops (Fig. 1) and a carboxyl-terminal tail. The first (C1), second (C2), and third (C3) cytoplasmic loops connect adjacent transmembrane (TM) helices. The fourth cytoplasmic loop (C4) is unique in that it is bounded by a helix only at its amino terminus; its carboxyl terminus is formed by the insertion of two palmitoyl groups into the membrane bilayer (3.Moench S.J. Moreland J. Stewart D.H. Dewey T.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5791-5796Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The palmitoyl groups are attached to Cys322 and Cys323 via thioester linkages (4.Papac D.I. Thornburg K.R. Bullesbach E.E. Crouch R.K. Knapp D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16889-16894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,5.Ovchinnikov Y.A. Abdulaev N.G. Bogachuk A.S. FEBS Lett. 1988; 230: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal tail is the region distal to Cys322 and Cys323. Considerable evidence has implicated C-2 and C-3 as participating in the complex with Gt (6.Koenig B. Arendt A. McDowell J.H.

However, the literature addressing the role of C4 in interactions with Gt is contradictory. Studies have shown that peptides derived from C4 can disrupt the stabilization of MII by Gt (6.Koenig B. Arendt A. McDowell J.H. Kahlert M. Hargrave P.A. Hofmann K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6878-6882Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), interfere with rhodopsin-stimulated GTPase activity of Gt (10.Takemoto D.J. Morrison D. Davis L.C. Takemoto L.J. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and bind directly to a fluorescently labeled Gβγt and prevent Gβγt-rhodopsin interactions (11.Phillips W.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17032-17039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, truncation of rhodopsin following Asn315, in the middle of C4, does not impair Gt activation (12.Weiss E.R. Osawa S. Shi W. Dickerson C.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7587-7593Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Since truncation at the beginning of C4 precluded proper expression and/or processing of rhodopsin, a follow-up study examined a series of single and double mutations in the amino-terminal half of C4, from Asn310through Asn315. None of the mutations was found to disrupt Gt activation, leading to the conclusion that C4 is not required for productive interactions with Gt (13.Osawa S. Weiss E.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1036-1040PubMed Google Scholar). Here we have carefully re-examined and defined the role of the C4 loop in rhodopsin-Gt interactions. We used fluorescence spectroscopy to demonstrate that a synthetic peptide corresponding to C4 of bovine rhodopsin, rho(310–321), binds to Gt and free Gαt. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potent inhibition of rhodopsin-catalyzed Gt activation by rho(310–321). We also prepared and characterized a series of site-directed mutants of bovine rhodopsin with alterations of the C4 loop. These data show that when either the entire C4 loop or a tripeptide (Asn310-Lys311-Gln312) at the amino terminus of the loop is replaced with the analogous sequence of the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR), the Gt-activating function of rhodopsin is diminished. Neither replacement of the carboxyl-terminal half of the loop, nor removal of the palmitoylation sites disrupt Gt activation. We conclude that the C4 loop is involved in mediating interactions between rhodopsin and Gt. Peptides were synthesized at the Rockefeller University Protein/DNA Technology Center and HHMI Biopolymer Facility by solid phase technique using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry. All peptides were prepared with free amino termini, and were amidated at the carboxyl termini. The peptides were purified by high performance liquid chromatography and characterized by mass spectrometry. The names and amino acid sequences of the peptides used in this study are the following: rho(132–144), AIERYVVVCKPMS; rho(240–252), SATTQKAEKEVTR; rho(310–321), NKQFRNCMVTTL; rho(313–321), FRNCMVTTL; rho(310–321)scr, TLTVNMKCQNFR; rho(310–321)SPD, SPDFRNCMVTTL. Gt was prepared from frozen bovine retinas (Lawson, Inc., Lincoln, NE) using standard techniques (14.Kuhn H. Nature. 1980; 283: 587-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 15.Fung B.K. Hurley J.B. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Specific activities of Gt samples were determined by spectrofluorometric titration, as described previously (16.Fahmy K. Sakmar T.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7229-7236Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Gβγt and Gαt were isolated from holo-Gt essentially according to published methods (17.Shichi H. Yamamoto K. Somers R.L. Vision Res. 1984; 24: 1523-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) using a Hitachi LC-organizer high performance liquid chromatography system with a 1-ml Hi-Trap Blue-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The proteins were eluted from the column by applying a 0–2m NaCl gradient. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. The subunits were stored at −20 °C in a 50% glycerol buffer until use. Fluorescence measurements were done on a Spex Fluorolog 3–11 τ3 spectrofluorometer equipped with a 450 W Xenon arc lamp. All fluorescence experiments were performed in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.2) containing 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μm GDP, and 0.01% (w/v) dodecyl maltoside. Spectra were recorded at 10 °C in a 4 × 4-mm quartz cuvette. Protein fluorescence was obtained by exciting at 295 nm and monitoring emission from 315 to 450 nm. The excitation and emission slit bandpass were 1.5 and 5 nm, respectively. Titration experiments were typically performed by adding 10-μl aliquots of the peptide from a stock solution of 250 μm to a protein solution of 200 nm. Site-directed mutagenesis was achieved primarily by using restriction fragment replacement (18.Lo K.-M. Jones S.S. Hackett N.R. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 91: 2285-2289Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar) in a synthetic rhodopsin gene (19.Ferretti L. Karnik S.S. Khorana H.G. Nassal M. Oprian D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) cloned into a eukaryotic expression vector (20.Franke R.R. Sakmar T.P. Oprian D.D. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2119-2122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutants CTr1 and CTr3 were constructed by substituting theBspEI-SalI restriction fragment with a synthetic duplex containing the desired codon alterations; mutant CTr2 involved a similar substitution of the ApaI-SalI fragment. Mutants CTr4 and the Lys311 point mutations involved substitution of an ApaI-BspEI fragment. The mutant CysXV (C322S/C323S) was constructed by substituting theXhoI-BstEII fragment of the rhodopsin gene into CysXIII (C140S/C316S/C322S/C323S). CysXIII was prepared by substituting the BspEI-SalI fragment of a C140S mutant (21.Karnik S.S. Sakmar T.P. Chen H.B. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8459-8463Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) with a synthetic fragment that contained the appropriate codon alterations for C316S, C322S, and C323S. The combination mutant CTr4/CysXV was prepared by cloning theXhoI-BstEII fragment of CTr4 into aXhoI-BstEII digested CysXV vector. Cell culture, transfection, and immunoaffinity purification procedures have been described elsewhere (22.Sakmar T.P. Franke R.R. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8309-8313Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 23.Min K.C. Zvyaga T.A. Cypess A.M. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol.

Membranes from transfected cells were prepared prior to regeneration with 11-cis-retinal using sucrose density gradient centrifugation, as described previously (25.Han, M., and Sakmar, T. P. (2000) Methods Enzymol., in pressGoogle Scholar). The assay was performed essentially as described (16.Fahmy K. Sakmar T.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7229-7236Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), using 250 nmGt and 1 nm rhodopsin or mutant pigment. Peptide competition assays were performed with 200 nmGt and 1 nm purified COS cell-expressed rhodopsin from which 1D4 peptide introduced in the purification procedure was removed by gel filtration on a G-50 Nick column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The appropriate concentration of peptide was added from a 15 mm stock solution and preincubated with Gt for 30 min before the start of the assay. Opsin was metabolically labeled with [3H]palmitic acid (NEN Life Science Products Inc., Boston, MA) essentially as described previously (26.Karnik S.S. Ridge K.D. Bhattacharya S. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Briefly, 48 h post-transfection, COS cells were grown for 8 h in serum-free media. The cells were then incubated for 30 min in 1% serum, followed by 2 h in 1% serum supplemented with 100 μCi/ml [3H]palmitic acid (43 Ci/mmol). Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested, and solubilized in 0.1% (w/v) dodecyl maltoside solution. The detergent extracts were incubated overnight with resin conjugated with 1D4 monoclonal antibody as used in the standard rhodopsin purification procedure (27.Oprian D.D. Molday R.S. Kaufman R.J. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8874-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The resin was washed extensively, as monitored by the decreasing tritium counts present in successive washes. Opsin was eluted from the resin by incubation with wash buffer containing the 1D4 peptide. The relative amounts of [3H]palmitic acid incorporated into the eluted samples were analyzed by scintillation counting. Peptides derived from the C2, C3, and C4 loops of rhodopsin have been shown to disrupt the ability of Gt to stabilize MII as measured by an extra-MII assay (6.Koenig B. Arendt A. McDowell J.H. Kahlert M. Hargrave P.A. Hofmann K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6878-6882Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). We examined whether similar peptides could also disrupt the activation of Gt by catalytic amounts of solubilized rhodopsin in a fluorescence activation assay. In Fig.2, a dose-dependent decrease in the rate of Gt activation is observed in the presence of synthetic peptides derived from the amino terminus of C2 (rho(132–144)), the carboxyl terminus of C3 (rho(240–252)), and C4 (rho(310–321)). The effective concentration at 50% inhibition (IC50) for all peptides was in the 0.1–0.3 mmrange; all peptides inhibited activation completely at concentrations ≤1 mm. A C1-derived peptide, rho(61–75), only modestly inhibited transducin activation at 1 mm (not shown). In an effort to characterize the interactions of C4 with Gt, the intrinsic fluorescence emission spectra of Gαt and Gβγt were collected in the presence of increasing concentrations of rho(310–321). A significant red shift (7.8 ± 0.3 nm, n = 4) in the λmax of tryptophan emission of Gαt was observed in the presence of 45 μm peptide (Fig.3 A). The shift was accompanied by a modest (∼10%) increase in intensity. These spectral changes are indicative of a change in the molecular environment of at least one of the two tryptophans of Gαt caused by the binding of the peptide. The extent of the red shift was dependent on the concentration of peptide (Fig. 3 A, inset). In contrast, the λmax of tryptophan fluorescence emission of Gβγt was only minimally (1.0 ± 0.3 nm,n = 4) affected by the peptide (Fig. 3 B). These data suggest that the peptide does not bind to free Gβγt, but they do not rule out binding in a manner that does not alter the molecular environment of enough of its 8 intrinsic tryptophans to allow for spectroscopic detection. The emission spectrum of holo-Gt was red shifted by approximately 4 nm in the presence of the peptide (data not shown), which is consistent with peptide interaction with Gαt but not Gβγtin the context of the heterotrimer. The effects of three additional peptides on the λmax of Gαt emission were examined. The peptides, which were derivatives of rho(310–321), were: (a) rho(313–321), in which residues 310, 311, and 312 were not present; (b) rho(310–321)scr in which the order of the amino acids was scrambled; and (c) rho(310–321)SPD in which the first three positions of the peptide were changed from NKQ to SPD. The sequence of rho(310–321)SPD is derived from the rhodopsin mutant CTr4 (Fig. 4). The peptides rho(313–321) and rho(310–321)scr did not affect the λmax of Gαt emission, whereas rho(310–321)SPD caused a ∼4-nm red shift, with no change in fluorescence intensity (data not shown). As an additional control, the λmax of the emission spectrum of bovine serum albumin was shown to be insensitive to the presence of rho(310–321) (data not shown).Figure 4Amino acid sequences of the fourth loop of bovine rhodopsin, human β2-AR, human m1-MR, and fourth loop mutants of rhodopsin.

Regions that were replaced or altered in the creation of mutants are highlighted in gray.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Three rhodopsin mutants were prepared in which portions of C4 were replaced with sequences from analogous segments of the β2-AR or the m1-muscarinic receptor (m1-MR) (Fig. 4). These two receptors were chosen because they have fourth loops of similar lengths to that of rhodopsin and at least one cysteine homologous to Cys322 or Cys323 of rhodopsin. The β2-AR has been shown to be palmitoylated (28.O'Dowd B.F. Hnatowich M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7564-7569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while this modification in the m1-MR is inferred to be very likely because of the presence of a Cys residue at the required location. Furthermore, these receptors bind G protein types not related to Gt, which is a member of the Gi/o class. The m1-MR couples to Gq, and the β2 AR couples to Gs. In mutants CTr1 and CTr2, portions of C4 are replaced with sequence derived from the β2-AR (Fig. 4). CTr1 involves replacement of the carboxyl-terminal half of the loop, while the entire fourth loop is replaced in CTr2. Only a carboxyl-terminal replacement was constructed with the m1-MR (CTr3), since the amino-terminal halves of the C4 loops of rhodopsin and m1-MR are nearly identical. The chimeric C4 mutant approach offers several advantages. For example, since the replacements are relatively long, and the substituted sequence is derived from receptors that couple to Gs or Gq, the sensitivity of observing a relevant disruption in G protein coupling is high. Additionally, since the fourth loops of the β2-AR, m1-MR, and rhodopsin are of comparable length, the expression, folding, and palmitoylation of the chimeric fourth loop mutants should not be disrupted. Therefore, the confidence of attributing a loss-of-function phenotype to a specific defect in Gt coupling is high. The analysis of CTr1, CTr2, and CTr3 described below pointed toward the involvement of the amino-terminal part of C4 in Gtinteractions. To further examine this region, mutant CTr4 was constructed in which only those positions that differ between CTr1 and CTr2 (i.e. 310, 311, and 312) were replaced (Fig. 4). In addition, a series of point mutations in which Lys311 was replaced by residues with a variety of physicochemical properties were constructed: K311P, K311S, K311R, and K311W. Position 311 lies in the center of a proposed helical extension of TM7 (29.Yeagle P.L. Alderfer J.L. Albert A.D. Mol. Vis. 1996; 2: 12PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Altenbach C. Cai K. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7931-7937Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). These mutants were designed specifically to test and control for the possible role of a helix-altering proline in the 311 position in mutant CTr2. Two additional mutants were constructed to assess the role of palmitoylation in the function of C4. In CysXV (C322S/C323S) the sites of palmitoylation were removed, and in Ctr4/CysXV, the CTr4 and CysXV replacements were combined. The mutant CysXV has been previously described and characterized in a detergent-solubilized Gtactivation assay (26.Karnik S.S. Ridge K.D. Bhattacharya S. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The mutant CTr4/CysXV was used to test whether the effects of preventing palmitoylation were different in the background of a mutated C4 as compared with rhodopsin. The mutants were transiently expressed in COS cells and regenerated with 11-cis-retinal to yield pigments. The mutant pigments were either purified in dodecyl maltoside detergent or isolated in cell membrane preparations. UV-visible spectra taken on purified samples in the dark showed that each mutant pigment had a λmax value of 500 nm, identical to that of rhodopsin prepared under the same conditions (Table I). Upon illumination, mutants CTr1, CTr2, and CTr3 formed MII-like pigments with λmax values of 380 nm. Acid denaturation of the photolyzed pigments revealed that the Schiff base bonds of the mutants were at least as stable as that of rhodopsin (data not shown).Table IBiochemical characterization of rhodopsin fourth loop mutantsSampleλmax, AbsTransducin activation rateaActivation rates are normalized to that of rhodopsin and are presented as mean ± S.E.

The activation of Gt was observed as an increase in the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of Gαtupon binding of GTPγS (16.Fahmy K. Sakmar T.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7229-7236Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The initial rate of GTPγS uptake by Gt catalyzed by each mutant was normalized to that of rhodopsin (Fig. 5). Mutants CTr1 and CTr3, in which the carboxyl-terminal half of the loop was replaced, displayed similar initial rates to that of rhodopsin. However, CTr2, in which the entire loop was replaced, displayed a reduced initial rate. The CTr4 mutant, in which only a tripeptide in the amino-terminal part of the loop was replaced with β2-AR sequence, was also deficient in activating Gt. The level of activity was comparable to that of CTr2. None of the Lys311 point mutants was defective in Gt activation. The non-palmitoylated CysXV mutant exhibited similar activity to that of rhodopsin in the detergent assay. When assayed in membranes, CysXV was slightly hyperactive (data not shown). The activity of the combination mutant CTr4/CysXV was similar to that of CTr4. Efficient activation of Gαt is known to require the presence of Gβγt (31.Fung B.K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10495-10502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A previous study of a peptide derived from the C4 loop of rhodopsin suggested that this region binds to Gβγt (11.Phillips W.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17032-17039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the reduced activation of Gt by the mutant CTr2 might be a result of disruption of the Gβγt-binding site on rhodopsin. To test this hypothesis, the rate of Gt activation by solubilized, COS cell expressed rhodopsin (1 nm) or CTr2 (3 nm) was measured as a function of the concentration of Gβγt. Higher concentrations of CTr2 were necessary in this experiment due to its reduced activity. Fig.6 shows the change in fluorescence over time due to rhodopsin- or CTr2-catalyzed GTPγS uptake by Gαt in the presence of different concentrations of Gβγt. The intrinsic tryptophans of Gβγtaffected only the background level of fluorescence, which is normalized in Fig. 6. If the defect in CTr2 were solely attributable to decreased binding of Gβγt, then the concentration of Gβγt at which half-maximal activity was observed would likely be significantly higher for CTr2 than for rhodopsin. Additionally, one might expect the relative defect in activation rate of CTr2 to be reduced at high concentrations of Gβγt. The data do not reveal a significant difference between rhodopsin and CTr2 in the effect of Gβγt concentration on Gαt activation, nor does the activity of CTr2 approach that of rhodopsin even at a 2:1 (Gβγt:Gαt) stoichiometric excess (Fig.6). We investigated whether replacing portions of the fourth loop with β2-AR sequence disrupted palmitoylation of mutants CTr1, CTr2, and CTr4. The incorporation of [3H]palmitic acid present in the cell media during transfection into CTr1, CTr2, CTr4, and rhodopsin was comparable (Table I). The levels of incorporation were severalfold higher than the incorporation associated with CysXV, which has been reported not to be palmitoylated (26.Karnik S.S. Ridge K.D. Bhattacharya S. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The sequence alignments and analyses available in the G Protein-coupled Receptor Data Base (GPCRDB) were used to examine the conservation of C4 residues in GPCRs (32.Horn F. Weare J. Beukers M.W. Horsch S. Bairoch A. Chen W. Edvardsen O. Campagne F. Vriend G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Among the 86 vertebrate opsins in the data base, the residues in the amino-terminal half of C4 were found to be nearly 100% conserved (Fig. 7). In contrast, the carboxyl-terminal half of the loop is only ∼65% conserved. Significant efforts have been directed toward elucidating the regions of rhodopsin involved in binding and activating Gt(for reviews, see Ref. 2.Helmreich E.J. Hofmann K.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 285-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 33.Wess J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, and 34.Bourne H.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). A variety of experiments using peptide competition, mutagenesis, and antibody-based approaches have defined the importance of the intracellular surface, and in particular, loops C2 and C3 in mediating interactions with Gt. Published reports regarding the role of loop C4 are contradictory. Studies based on peptides derived from C4 have suggested the importance of this region (6.Koenig B. Arendt A. McDowell J.H. Kahlert M. Hargrave P.A. Hofmann K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6878-6882Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 10.Takemoto D.J. Morrison D. Davis L.C. Takemoto L.J. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), but a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and truncation of C4 appeared to rule out an important function for the region in Gt activation (12.Weiss E.R. Osawa S. Shi W. Dickerson C.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7587-7593Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 13.Osawa S. Weiss E.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1036-1040PubMed Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate and characterize the importance of the amino-terminal part of the fourth loop, and suggest the role it plays in rhodopsin-Gtinteractions. Several different experimental approaches in this report corroborate the importance of the fourth loop of rhodopsin in interactions with Gt. A peptide derived from C4, rho(310–321), can inhibit the catalysis of Gt activation by rhodopsin. Previously, an identical peptide has been reported to inhibit the binding of Gt to rhodopsin as measured by an extra-MII assay (6.Koenig B. Arendt A. McDowell J.H. Kahlert M. Hargrave P.A. Hofmann K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6878-6882Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Our results extend and confirm this observation by demonstrating that the peptide is active at similar concentrations in the fluorescence activation assay (Fig. 2). Significantly, the potency of rho(310–321) was comparable to that of peptides derived from very well characterized G protein-interacting regions, including the highly conserved Glu-Arg-Tyr sequence in the C2-derived rho(132–144) peptide. Additionally, rho(310–321) induces a red shift in the fluorescence emission spectrum of Gαt (Fig. 3), which is evidence that the peptide can bind directly to the Gαt subunit. The relevance of studies with the isolated C4-derived peptide to the function of C4 in the intact receptor is supported by the report that a rho(306–348) peptide assumed a defined structure in solution (29.Yeagle P.L. Alderfer J.L. Albert A.D. Mol. Vis. 1996; 2: 12PubMed Google Scholar). The results of the mutagenesis data strongly support and clarify the involvement of the fourth loop in Gt activation. In particular, the data localize the important region to the amino terminus of C4, as shown by the striking decrease in the rate of Gt activation by the mutants in which residues 310–312 are replaced with β2-AR sequence (Fig. 5). Osawa and Weiss (13.Osawa S. Weiss E.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1036-1040PubMed Google Scholar) argued against involvement of this region based on the wild-type phenotype of N310A, K311A, and Q312A point mutants. However, a recent report (35.Cai K. Klein-Seetharaman J. Farrens D. Zhang C. Altenbach C. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7925-7930Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) corroborates our findings by identifying a mutation in the amino terminus of C4 (N310C) that can disrupt Gtactivation. The precise role of Asn310 in Gtcoupling appears complex, and additional work is underway that focuses exclusively on this residue. Sequence analysis also supports the importance of the amino terminus of the C4 loop in receptor function. The amino terminus of C4 is nearly 100% conserved within the vertebrate opsins, whereas the carboxyl-terminal half of the loop is only ∼65% conserved (Fig. 7). Furthermore, the asparagine in position 310 is very highly conserved within the large biogenic amine family of receptors, with the exception of the non-α2-ARs, where it nearly always is a serine. This latter observation suggests that the amino-terminal part of the fourth loop may be important in GPCRs other than opsins. Indeed, mutagenesis experiments in this region of the fourth loop identified it as critical for receptor-G protein interactions in the β2-AR (36.O'Dowd B.F. Hnatowich M. Regan J.W. Leader W.M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15985-15992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Liggett S.B. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Hnatowich M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4816-4821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several reports have suggested that accessibility to regions in the fourth loop are specifically modulated by photoactivation of rhodopsin, an observation consistent with the regulated involvement of C4 in Gt activation. The cytoplasmic end of TM helix 7 has been shown to become more accessible following light activation of rhodopsin (38.Abdulaev N.G. Ridge K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12854-12859Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and spin labels attached to positions 316 (39.Resek J.F. Farahbakhsh Z.T. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12025-12032Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and 313 (30.Altenbach C. Cai K. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7931-7937Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) in the middle of C4 undergo increased mobility after photolysis. Additionally, a spin label at Cys316 was reported to move apart from a label at position 65, at the amino terminus of the TM helix 1, upon MII formation (40.Yang K. Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Farahbakhsh Z.T. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14040-14046Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We examined several factors that potentially affect the structure of C4, including the palmitoylation of Cys322 and Cys323, the integrity of a proposed helical extension of TM7, and the presence of a membrane environment. The palmitoylation of Cys322 and Cys323 does not appear to affect the function of the amino-terminal part of the loop. Both CTr4 and CTr2 are palmitoylated (Table I) despite alterations in amino acids in the vicinity of the acylation site. However, the non-palmitoylated combination mutant CTr4/CysXV is essentially indistinguishable from CTr4 in detergent assays. In membranes, CysXV is slightly more active than rhodopsin, and CTr4/CysXV is slightly more active than CTr4 (not shown). Both observations corroborate previous reports that a nonpalmitoylated mutant was similar to rhodopsin in detergent solution (26.Karnik S.S. Ridge K.D. Bhattacharya S. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and that chemical depalmitoylation increased activity of rhodopsin when assayed in rod outer segment membranes (41.Morrison D.F. O'Brien P.J. Pepperberg D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20118-20123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given that residues 310–312 are located adjacent to the membrane border of the TM helix 7, it seems plausible that their structure is unaffected by the membrane anchoring of Cys322 and Cys323. The same reasoning might explain why truncation of rhodopsin following Asn315 does not diminish Gt activation (12.Weiss E.R. Osawa S. Shi W. Dickerson C.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7587-7593Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Furthermore, C4 may form a loop in the absence of palmitoylation, as suggested by the NMR structure of a fourth loop peptide (29.Yeagle P.L. Alderfer J.L. Albert A.D. Mol. Vis. 1996; 2: 12PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of hyperactivity of non-palmitoylated rhodopsin that has been observed in membranes appears to be unrelated to the function of the amino terminus of C4. The TM helix 7 is likely to extend beyond the membrane border, based on experimental (29.Yeagle P.L. Alderfer J.L. Albert A.D. Mol. Vis. 1996; 2: 12PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Altenbach C. Cai K. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7931-7937Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and theoretical (42.Ben-Tal N. Ben-Shaul A. Nicholls A. Honig B. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1803-1812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) grounds. The TM2 (43.Farahbakhsh Z.T. Ridge K.D. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8812-8819Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), TM4, and TM5 (44.Altenbach C. Yang K. Farrens D.L. Farahbakhsh Z.T. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12470-12478Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) helices have all been reported to extend into the aqueous phase. The proline in position 311 of CTr2 and CTr4 might disrupt a helical extension of TM helix 7, leading to the observed phenotype. But the K311P point mutation does not resemble the 310–312 mutation of CTr4 in Gt activation assays, indicating that perturbation of the proposed helical extension does not impair G protein activation. We propose that the role of C4 is to modulate, in conjunction with other structures, the binding site for Gt. We favor this interpretation rather than those in which C4 serves as the sole binding site or participates mechanistically in the catalysis of nucleotide exchange because: (a) residual Gt activation was observed with the CTr2 and CTr4 mutants, (b) point mutations at the 311 position did not affect activation, (c) the amino-terminal C4 sequence of rhodopsin is highly, but not absolutely, conserved in other opsins and in certain other GPCRs (Fig. 7), and (d) the substitution of β2-AR sequence into C4 does not allow rhodopsin to activate Gs (data not shown). The modulatory functions of C4 appear to be mediated both by contacts with Gt and by allosteric interactions with other regions of the receptor. Specific interaction between C4 and Gt is indicated most directly by the rho(310–321)-Gtα interaction observed by fluorescence emission spectroscopy (Fig. 3). Direct contacts are also suggested by the inhibition of rhodopsin-catalyzed Gtactivation in the presence of rho(310–321), an observation plausibly explained by binding of the peptide to the G protein, and occupancy of a receptor contact site (Fig. 2). Which part of the heterotrimer is binding to the C4 loop? A C4-derived peptide, rho(310–324), has been reported to bind Gβγt (11.Phillips W.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17032-17039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the similarity of the activation rate versus Gβγtconcentration profiles for rhodopsin and CTr2, and the failure of high concentrations of Gβγt to fully rescue CTr2 activity (Fig. 6), argue against the fourth loop as acting solely as a Gβγt-binding site. Furthermore, the direct binding of rho(310–321) to Gαt (Fig. 3) demonstrates that C4 is involved with Gαt binding in addition to, or even instead of, Gβγt binding. Perhaps C4 binds Gαtdirectly, and allosterically regulates other regions of the receptor involved in Gβγt binding. The data in this report demonstrate a conclusive role for the amino terminus of C4 of rhodopsin in Gt interactions. We suggest that this region interacts directly with Gt, particularly with Gαt, and with other regions of the intracellular surface to support Gt binding. In the following paper, we study a subset of mutant receptors described here using a biophysical assay that detects binding of Gt or peptides derived from Gt subunit sequences (45.Ernst O.P.

Chem. 1992; 267: 15642-15649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise PDX1 binds to the A1 and A3/4 regions of the insulin promoter. The phenotypes of mice bearing disrupted alleles of BETA2, PDX1, and other potential insulin gene transcription factors Pax4, Pax6, Nkx2.2, and Nkx6.1 indicate that these proteins may play an important role in beta cell differentiation also (reviewed in Refs. 16.Edlund H.

The aim of the present study was to analyze a more physiologically relevant situation, namely the action of several of the known factors (E2A, BETA2, and PDX1) on the insulin promoter. We show that in transfected non-beta cells, combined expression of these three factors leads to dramatically elevated expression as compared with levels obtained in the presence of each factor alone. This level corresponds to ∼25% of the promoter activity observed in transfected beta cells. In turn, this represents at least a 100-fold lower specificity as compared with differential steady state insulin mRNA levels as measured by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) reaction. We have further examined the sequence requirements of the BETA2 protein for this activity and find that efficient activation requires distinct functional domains of the BETA2 molecule. Substitution with domains derived from the muscle bHLH protein MyoD cannot generate efficient activation of the insulin promoter, in part because binding to the promoter fragment is inefficient. Expression vectors encoding E2A (E47) (20.Aronheim A. Shiran R. Rosen A. Walker M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8063-8067Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and PDX1 (8.Ohlsson H. Karlsson K. Edlund T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4251-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar) were generated by insertion of the full-length protein-coding sequences to the vector pcDNA3 (Stratagene). A BETA2 (6.Naya F.J.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1009-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) expression vector was generated by insertion of the full-length protein-coding sequences to the vector pCGN-HA (21.Tanaka M. Herr W. Cell. 1990; 60: 375-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). In both vectors, expression is under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. Gal4-BETA2 hybrid constructs were generated by PCR reaction using Pwo DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The resulting BETA2 fragments were introduced into an expression vector encoding the Gal4 DNA binding domain under the control of the CMV promoter. The constructs were named according to the N- and C-terminal amino acid. DNA fragments encoding deleted and substituted BETA2 were generated by PCR and introduced into pCGN-HA. The mouse MyoD cDNA (22.Davis R.L. Weintraub H. Lassar A.B. Cell. 1987; 51: 987-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar) was used for generating hybrid proteins with BETA2. pOK1 (23.Karlsson O. Edlund T. Moss J.B. Rutter W.J.

To generate prIns-LUC, the SV40 promoter of the plasmid pGL3.promoter (Promega) was replaced by the 410 base pairs of rat insulin I gene promoter. The plasmids 5Gal4.E1b.CAT (24.Lillie J.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1989; 338: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) and pRSV-LUC (25.De Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2482) Google Scholar) have been described previously. The insulinM-CAT reporter plasmid was constructed by substituting the insulin E box motifs in pOK1 by the muscle creatine kinase (MCK) E box motifs using PCR with primers containing the MCK E box sequence 5′-AACACCTGCT-3′ (26.Davis R.L. Cheng P.F. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 60: 733-746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). The relevant regions of plasmids constructed by PCR were verified by DNA sequencing. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 unit/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). The hybrid cell lines Rin-m × L were established and cultured as described (27.Leshkowitz D. Walker M.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1547-1552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cell line HeLa (Tet-off) PDX1 was generated by stable transfection of the line HeLa Tet-off (CLONTECH) with pTet-splice-PDX1, a plasmid containing the PDX1-coding sequence under the control of TRE (tetracycline response element) in the vector pTet-splice (28.Yin D.X. Zhu L. Schimke R.T. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 235: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar); HeLa (Tet-off) cells were transfected with the plasmids pTet-splice-PDX1 (30 μg) and pSV2-HYG (1.5 μg). Clones were selected in the presence of 200 μg/ml hygromycin, 100 μg/ml G418, and 2 μg/ml tetracycline (tet). Surviving clones were tested for their ability to express PDX1 in a tet-repressible manner. Cells were grown in the absence or presence (2 μg/ml) of tet for 24–48 h, and PDX1 expression was tested by immunoblotting using a monoclonal antibody directed against PDX1. One of the clones obtained, designated HeLa (Tet-off) PDX1, showed no detectable PDX1 protein in the presence of 2 μg/ml tet but strongly inducible PDX1 in the absence of tet (data not shown); the clone also showed closely similar ability to activate the transfected insulin CAT reporter plasmid pOK1 as compared with that obtained following transient transfection of HeLa cells with a PDX1 expression vector, pcDNA3-PDX1 (data not shown). HeLa (Tet-off), HIT cells (hamster insulinoma (29.Santerre R.F. Cook R.A. Crisel R.M.D. Sharp J.D. Schmidt R.J. Williams D.C. Wilson C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4339-4343Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar)) and 293T cell lines were transfected using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation procedure (30.Wigler M. Pellicer A. Silverstein S. Axel R. Urlaub G. Chasin L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1373-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). HeLa (Tet-off) PDX1 cells were plated 16 h before transfection and cultured in the absence of tet to induce PDX1 expression. Cells were cotransfected with 5 μg of CAT reporter plasmid and the indicated amount of expression plasmids and luciferase (pRSV-LUC) internal control plasmid. CAT activity was measured by the phase extraction procedure (31.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene/Wiley-Interscience, New York1988Google Scholar) and normalized according to the luciferase activity of the cotransfected internal control plasmid. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Results shown are mean ± S.E. Nuclear extracts were prepared from transfected cells as described previously (4.Aronheim A. Ohlsson H. Park C.W. Edlund T. Walker M.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3893-3899Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Fifty μg of protein extract were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose sheets. The membrane was probed with the indicated primary antibodies followed by second antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and visualization using the enhanced chemiluminescence reaction. Double strand oligonucleotides (5 pmol) were end-labeled with [α-32P]dATP using DNA polymerase I, Klenow fragment. The activity obtained was typically 2–3 × 103cpm/fmol. The protein extract (4 μg) was incubated for 10 min on ice in binding buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 150 mmKCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol) containing 600 ng of poly(dI·dC) (Sigma) and 600 ng of poly(dA·dT) (Sigma) in a final assay volume of 14 μl. Subsequently, probe was added (1 μl, ∼20,000 cpm), and incubation was allowed to continue for an additional 20 min. Samples were subsequently resolved on 6% polyacrylamide gels (30:0.8 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) at 184 V (constant voltage) for 1 h at 4 °C. Running buffer contained 40 mm Tris, 195 mm glycine (pH 8.5). All binding and electrophoresis steps were performed at 0 °C to 4 °C. The following sequences were used: E1: 5′-GATCCGCCATCTGCCA-3′ GAL4: 5′-GATCCCGGAGTACTGTCCTCCGA-3′ Poly(A)-containing RNA isolated from Rin-m cells (rat insulinoma cells), L cells (mouse fibroblasts), and hybrid Rin-m × L cells were used to make cDNA using reverse transcriptase (RT) and oligo(dT). Yeast tRNA was added to RT reactions to ensure that at least 100 ng of RNA was present in each reaction. The PCR reaction was performed with the following oligonucleotide primers: 1. 5′-AA/GA/GCCATCAGCAAGC-3′ 2. 5′-GAGCAGATGCTGGTGCAGC-3′ The genome of rat and mouse contains two non-allelic insulin genes, denoted insulin I and insulin II; in both species, the insulin I gene contains a single intron, whereas the insulin II gene contains 2 introns (1.Steiner D.F. Chan S.J. Welsh J.M. Kwok S.C.M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1985; 19: 463-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The above primers correspond to sequences found in exons 1 and 2 (insulin I gene) or exons 1 and 3 (insulin II gene), respectively, and are complementary to sequences of rat and mouse insulin genes. The cDNA should give a PCR product of 329 to 334 base pairs depending on the species and gene (insulin gene I or II), whereas genomic DNA should give significantly larger products. PCR reaction products were fractionated by electrophoresis on 1.75% agarose gel and blotted to nylon sheets (Nytran). An oligonucleotide (MW23 5′-TAAGAAGATGTGTGGGTACAG-3′ complementary to a region of the insulin mRNA between the primers was end-labeled with [γ32P]dATP and T4 kinase (NEN Life Science Products) and used as a hybridization probe for Southern blots containing PCR products. Northern analysis revealed high levels of insulin mRNA in beta cells but undetectable levels in non-beta cell lines and insulinoma × fibroblast hybrid cell lines (27.Leshkowitz D. Walker M.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1547-1552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Besnard C. Monthioux E. Loras P. Jami J. Daegelen D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 146: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We have now used a more sensitive method, RT-PCR, capable of detecting much lower concentrations of insulin mRNA. The analysis was performed with RNA isolated from the beta cell line Rin-m, the fibroblast cell line L, and hybrid cells Rin-m × L (Fig. 1). Under the conditions of the analysis, signal intensity was dependent on the amount of input RNA in the range 50 ng–50 fg of poly(A) RNA (Fig.1, lanes 1–7). The procedure is sensitive enough to permit detection of insulin mRNA in RT-PCR reactions derived from 0.5 pg of Rin-m poly(A) RNA (band indicated by lower arrow in Fig.1, lane 6). Yet with 50 ng of poly(A) RNA from Rin-m × L cells or L cells, little or no signal was observed (a signal arising from residual genomic DNA was detected, indicated by the upper arrow in Fig. 1, lanes 8–10). Thus, insulin mRNA levels in hybrid cells and fibroblasts are at least 105-fold reduced as compared with Rin-m cells. A similar differential was obtained upon comparison of the hamster beta cell line, HIT with fibroblasts (data not shown). To evaluate the role of the proteins PDX1, E2A, and BETA2 as potential insulin gene transcription factors, we expressed these proteins in a derivative of HeLa cells, HeLa (Tet off) PDX1, and monitored the activation of a cotransfected reporter plasmid containing the natural rat insulin I gene promoter (−410 to −1). Whereas separate expression of each transcription factor led to fairly modest activity (0.3–4.9%), co-expression of all three led to a striking 160-fold synergistic increase in expression (Fig.2). Expression of BETA2 in combination with either E2A or PDX1 led to intermediate expression levels (20–60%) (Fig. 2). The activity observed with BETA2 and PDX1 was unexpectedly high, since BETA2 is thought to bind DNA inefficiently as a homodimer (6.Naya F.J. Stellrecht C.M.M. Tsai M.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1009-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), and endogenous E2A levels are apparently rate-limiting under the conditions of the transfection (since expression of BETA2 alone produces substantially lower expression than BETA2 + E2A). BETA2 seems to play a particularly important role in activation of the insulin gene promoter, since pairwise expression of these factors showed much lower activation when BETA2 was absent as compared with that observed when either E2A or PDX1 were absent (Fig. 2). We obtained essentially identical results using parental HeLa cells as compared with HeLa (tet off) PDX1 (data not shown). Insulin gene promoter activity in HeLa cells was compared with that observed in transfected beta cells (HIT). For this purpose, to correct for differences in transfection efficiency between cell types, we normalized expression to that observed with the CMV promoter, which functions efficiently in both cell types; similar results were obtained upon normalization with the Rous sarcoma virus promoter (data not shown). The maximal activity of the insulin gene promoter in HeLa cells, observed upon expression of E2A, BETA2, and PDX1 (∼160-fold activation) was ∼25% that of the insulin gene promoter activity observed in the HIT cell line (Fig.3). Because of its central importance in activation of the insulin promoter in this system, we examined the regions of the BETA2 protein required to produce high level expression. We generated plasmids encoding truncated versions of BETA2 (Fig.4 A). Truncations lacking either the C- or N-terminal portions showed significantly reduced ability to activate the insulin gene promoter (Fig. 4 B). Like the wild type BETA2 protein, they showed very low activity when expressed alone (data not shown). C-terminal truncations showed more dramatic reduction (5-fold) than N-terminal truncations (2.5-fold) (Fig. 4 B). EMSA analysis indicated that wild type and truncated BETA2 proteins were expressed at comparable levels (Fig.4 C). Thus both N- and C-terminal domains of BETA2 are necessary for efficient transcription by the insulin promoter. To determine whether the observed effects of the truncations were due to the presence of transcription activation domains, expression plasmids were generated encoding portions of the BETA2 protein fused to the DNA binding domain of the yeast transcriptional activator Gal4. Plasmids were cotransfected to 293T human epithelial cells together with a CAT reporter plasmid bearing the cognate Gal4 binding site (UASg). Gal4 fusion proteins containing portions of the C terminus showed strong activation; on the other hand, N-terminal fusions displayed no activation but rather reduced activity in this assay (Fig.5 B), EMSA analysis was performed to confirm that the various plasmids were efficiently expressed at the protein level (Fig. 5 C). This experiment was also performed with other cell types (Chinese hamster ovary cells and HIT (hamster beta cells)). The relative activities of the plasmids were similar to those observed with 293T cells, although in this case protein expression levels were below detection level of the EMSA assay (data not shown). Taken together these experiments indicate that efficient transcription requires a trans-activation domain located at the C terminus of the BETA2 protein and a domain at the N terminus, which does not possess an independent activation function. To further examine the sequence requirements for BETA2 activity, we generated additional expression plasmids based on comparison of the BETA2 protein with corresponding regions of the well studied MyoD protein. The rationale for this is that MyoD, like BETA2, is a bHLH protein that activates transcription as a heterodimeric complex with E2A and related class A bHLH proteins (13.Murre C. Bain G. Vandijk M.A. Engel I. Furnari B.A. Massari M.E. Matthews J.R. Quong M.W. Rivera R.R. Stuiver M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 33.Weintraub H. Cell. 1993; 75: 1241-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar) and in this process cooperates with other muscle-specific proteins (34.Black B.L. Molkentin J.D. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The intact MyoD protein was unable to efficiently activate the native insulin promoter (Fig. 6, A and B), most likely due to weak binding of MyoD-E2A heterodimers to the E box sequences of the insulin promoter. To test this, we generated a modified insulin promoter (insulinM) in which the two copies of the E box were replaced with sequences from the MCK promoter (Fig. 6 A). Indeed, MyoD showed strongly increased ability to activate the modified promoter as compared with the wild type promoter (Fig. 6 B). As a further test of this, we replaced the DNA binding domain of MyoD with that of BETA2 (Fig. 7 A). Unexpectedly, this construct showed sharply reduced transcriptional activity as compared with BETA2 (Fig. 7 B). The reduction was not attributable to altered expression levels (Fig. 7 C) but did correlate with impaired DNA binding activity (Fig. 7 D). Previous studies with MyoD have indicated that three key amino acids, Ala- 114, Thr-115 (located in the basic region), and Lys-124 (located in the junction between basic domain and the helix 1 of the HLH domain), play an essential role in myogenic activation (35.Davis R.L. Weintraub H. Science. 1992; 256: 1027-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We tested the significance of the corresponding junction residue Gly in BETA2 by mutating it to Lys (as found in MyoD). No significant effect on the trans-activation activity was observed (Fig. 7). Taken together, the results indicate that the ability of BETA2 to bind DNA efficiently can be significantly affected by sequences outside the canonical DNA binding domain; the sequence of BETA2 is compatible with efficient DNA binding, whereas that of MyoD is not. To examine the effect of the residues in BETA2 corresponding to Ala-114 and Thr-115 in MyoD, we generated two point-mutated variants of the BETA2 protein, substituting the amino acids Ala-105 and Asn-106 of BETA2 to Asn (as in E2A) and Thr as in MyoD, respectively (Fig.8, A and B). These two mutated BETA2 proteins bind DNA with similar efficiency as the wild type protein (Fig. 8 D). However, in contrast to MyoD, in neither case was a substantial change in promoter activity observed (Fig. 8 C). Thus it appears that the residues in BETA2 corresponding to key myogenic amino acids of MyoD are not crucial for activating insulin gene promoter activity in our system. The aim of this study was to better characterize the cell-specific expression of the insulin gene and begin to evaluate quantitatively the role of known transcription factors in the process. We used RT-PCR analysis to compare steady state mRNA levels in cell lines. The data indicate a differential of at least 105-fold. In theory, this could include a contribution of selective mRNA stability. However, since differential insulin mRNA stability in beta versus non-beta cells has not been reported, it has been assumed that transcriptional regulation contributes the majority of the difference. Most studies performed on the role of specific transcription factors on insulin gene transcription have used nonnatural promoter fragments. We have now established a system based on transfection of the natural insulin promoter and reconstitution of efficient activation in a non-beta cell line. We have been able to demonstrate that simultaneous expression of the three insulin gene transcription factors BETA2, PDX1, and E2A in HeLa cells leads to highly efficient transcription of the insulin promoter. Transcription is activated 160-fold to a level 25% that observed in transfected pancreatic beta cells. The increased activity in beta cells may be due to the presence of additional beta cell transcription factors, e.g. Pax6 and RIPE3b1 (16.Edlund H. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1817-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). By comparison, we have shown that the differential expression of insulin mRNA levels in pancreatic beta cells as compared with non-beta cells is at least 105-fold. The significantly higher specificity observed for the endogenous insulin gene as compared with a transfected gene is likely to reflect additional levels of control exerted on the natural endogenous gene, for example repression by chromatin. To begin to dissect the mechanisms involved in generating this high level of transcription, we have focused on the role of BETA2, which appears to play a dominant role in the system. In addition to the bHLH region of the protein known to be essential for dimerization and DNA binding, we observe that domains located both at the N and C terminus are required for full activation of the insulin promoter. The C-terminal domain can function as an independent activation domain, whereas the N-terminal domain cannot. Possibly the N terminus of BETA2 contains a transcription activation domain that functions only in the context of the native BETA2 molecule or may contribute to recruitment of the heterodimerization partner E2A, which itself possesses two independent activation domains (20.Aronheim A. Shiran R. Rosen A. Walker M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8063-8067Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These data confirm and extend the results of Sharma et al. (19.Sharma A. Moore M. Marcora E. Lee J.E. Qiu Y. Samaras S. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 704-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) who show activation domain activity in the C terminus of BETA2 using Gal4 fusions. To further explore the functions of BETA2, we compared its properties with those of the related muscle bHLH protein MyoD. The MyoD protein showed inefficient activation of the insulin promoter, at least in part because of its weak ability to bind the insulin promoter E box. Indeed, MyoD efficiently activated a modified insulin promoter bearing preferred MyoD binding sites, On the other hand, a hybrid MyoD-BETA2 bearing the DNA binding domain of BETA2 is unable to efficiently activate the native insulin promoter because of inefficient DNA binding. Thus domains outside the canonical DNA binding domain can have a dominant effect on BETA2 DNA binding. This is reminiscent of observations made previously for the muscle bHLH family and other transcription factors, indicating important functional effects on DNA binding by remote sequences (36.Chakraborty T. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6103-6108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Dean M. Allikments R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 57: 1254-1255PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, complementary observations have also been made for MyoD and other proteins, indicating that sequences within the DNA binding domain (Ala-105, Asn-106, and Lys-124) exert a profound effect on transcription activation in a manner apparently independent of DNA binding capacity (26.Davis R.L. Cheng P.F. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 60: 733-746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). The precise mechanism remains unclear, although it has been proposed to involve allosteric modification of protein structure induced by DNA binding and leading to “unmasking” of the activation domain (38.Huang J. Weintraub H. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5478-5484Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). By generating point mutations in BETA2, we have shown that the corresponding amino acids of BETA2 are not essential for insulin gene promoter activity in our system. Taken together, the data are consistent with a view of transcription factors as sophisticated multi-domain structures, with interdependent functions (39.Lefstin J.A. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1998; 392: 885-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 40.Ptashne M. Gann A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 812-822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms responsible for efficient activation of the insulin promoter remain to be established. Conceivably, BETA2 and PDX1 display mutually cooperative binding, possibly through direct or indirect protein-protein interactions. Recently BETA2 has been shown to interact with the transcriptional co-activator P300 (19.Sharma A. Moore M. Marcora E. Lee J.E. Qiu Y. Samaras S. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 704-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 41.Mutoh H. Naya F.J. Tsai M.J. Leiter A.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 820-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). PDX1 on the other hand has been shown to be capable of cooperative binding to DNA in the presence of the homeodomain protein PBX1 (42.Peers B. Sharma S. Johnson T. Kamps M. Montminy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7091-7097Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). A complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying cell-specific insulin gene expression will require more detailed mechanistic analysis of the interactions between these and other transcription factors together with analysis of additional, less well studied topics such as chromatin structure.

Physiological hypertrophy refers to the enlargement of the heart that results from repeated endurance exercise. This form of cardiac hypertrophy is both beneficial and reversible. In contrast, prolonged hypertrophy, usually secondary to other pathology, leads to irreversible cardiomyopathy and heart failure. In recent years, a number of transgenic mouse models of cardiomyopathy have been constructed that mimic critical aspects of human heart disease (1.Olson E.N. Molkentin J.D. Circ.

A number of these features can also be duplicated using in vitro cardiomyocyte models of cardiac hypertrophy. The most common in vitro model of hypertrophy employs primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. This valuable model system has allowed the biochemical and molecular characteristics of cardiac hypertrophy to be studied under experimentally controlled conditions (2.Sugden G.P. Circ.

Total RNA content per myocyte increases without a concomitant increase in DNA content, reflecting the absence of cell division. The hypertrophic response is characterized by the activation of immediate early gene expression followed by the transcriptional activation of certain embryonic genes such as skeletal α-actin, β-myosin heavy chain (18.Izumo S. Matsuoka R. Koren G. Schwartz K. J. Clin Invest. 1987; 79: 970-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 19.Schwartz K. De La Bastie D. Bouveret P. Oliviero P. Alonso S. Buckingham M. Circ.

The reemergence of β-myosin heavy chain in cardiac ventricles is viewed as the canonical adaptive genetic response in cardiac hypertrophy (22.Schwartz K. Lecarpentier Y. Martin J.L. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1981; 13: 1071-1075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). It is also possible to elicit hypertrophy by the use of pulsatile electrical stimulation to pace the contractions of neonatal rat cardiac myocytes (23.McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11665-11668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In response to this treatment, the myocytes display dramatic increases in cellular size and myofibrillar organization and a 5–10-fold increase in the expression of the cardiac genesAnf and Mlc-2 (23.McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11665-11668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Induction of Anfgene expression in rat neonatal cardiac myocytes is primarily dependent upon contractile calcium transients and calmodulin kinase and is independent of cAMP and protein kinase C (23.McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11665-11668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.McDonough P.M. Stella S.L. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9466-9472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Induction of theAnf promoter by electrical pacing involves the participation of c-Jun, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, serum response factor, and Sp1 acting on the Anf promoter-proximal serum response element and an Sp1-like element (25.McDonough P.M. Hanford D.S. Sprenkle A.B. Mellon N.R. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24046-24053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In electrically paced cardiac myocytes, the hypertrophic response is characterized by a pronounced increase in mitochondrial content, including the activation of nuclear genes encoding specific mitochondrial proteins (26.Xia Y. Buja L.M. McMillin J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12082-12087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 27.Xia Y. Buja L.M. Scarpulla R.C. McMillin J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Chem. 1998; 273: 12593-12598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The activation of these genes is preceded by an increase in the abundance of mRNA encoding the transcription factors c-Fos, c-Jun, Jun-B, and nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1). These results indicate that a battery of genes encoding mitochondrial components are activated in response to electrical pacing and that the transcription factors NRF-1 and AP-1 are involved in this process. Thus, electrically induced pacing of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes is a well documented in vitro model of cardiac hypertrophy (23.McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11665-11668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.McDonough P.M. Stella S.L. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol.

Recent studies have shown that a variety of physiological and pharmacological compounds illicit hypertrophic responses through calcium-mediated signaling pathways involving the activation of calcineurin. This cytoplasmic phosphatase acts to dephosphorylate the phosphorylated form of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), thereby allowing the dephosphorylated NFAT to enter the nucleus and activate genes. We wished to determine if electrical pacing also activated the calcineurin/NFAT pathway as a means of activating cardiac gene expression. As a model for these studies, we choseAdss1, the gene encoding the muscle-specific isoform of adenylosuccinate synthetase. This enzyme is believed to play a role in cardiac energy metabolism via the purine nucleotide cycle (30.Guicherit O.M. Rudolph F.B. Kellems R.E. Cooper B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22582-22587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Guicherit O.M. Cooper B.F. Rudolph F.B. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4488-4496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Lewis A.L. Guicherit O.M. Datta S.K. Hanten G.R. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22647-22656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Considerable information is available concerning the combinatorial mechanisms that regulate the cardiac specific expression of theAdss1 gene. This gene is activated early during cardiac development (by embryonic day 9.0 in the mouse) and up-regulated during the neonatal period to achieve very high levels of expression in the adult heart (33.Lewis A.L. Xia Y. Datta S.K. McMillin J. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14188-14197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Within 1.9 kb of DNA immediately upstream of theAdss1 transcription start site are genetic elements that function as a cardiac specific enhancer that confers proper developmental activation and neonatal enhancement in the cardiac lineage. The Adss1 cardiac enhancer confers copy number-dependent expression in transgenic mouse hearts (33.Lewis A.L. Xia Y. Datta S.K. McMillin J. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14188-14197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The enhancer region contains binding sites for NKX2.5, GATA4, MEF2C, E12, HAND1, and HAND2 that are essential for high level expression of a reporter gene in the hearts of transgenic mice and in transfected neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Each site is capable of sequence-specific interactions with proteins present in neonatal rat primary cardiac myocyte nuclear extracts. Thus, the cardiac regulatory elements of the murine Adss1 gene are well characterized and when driving the expression of a reporter gene serve as a sensitive and reliable reporter of cardiac specific gene expression (33.Lewis A.L. Xia Y. Datta S.K. McMillin J. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14188-14197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We show here that the expression of the Adss1 gene is considerably enhanced in cardiomyocytes when electrical pacing is used to increase myocyte contraction rates. This induction of Adss1 gene expression is mediated by NFAT dephosphorylation as a consequence of calcineurin activation. Adss1 induction acts through an NFAT binding site associated with the Adss1 gene. Electrical pacing also results in the increased synthesis of GATA4, another critical cardiac transcription factor required for Adss1gene expression. Our studies are the first to identify the calcineurin/NFAT and GATA4 pathway as a link between electrically paced myocyte contraction and changes in cardiac gene expression. Neonatal (1–3-day-old) rat cardiac myocytes were isolated and plated in six-well dishes (for RNA isolation and transient transfection) or 12-well dishes (with coverslips for fluorescent microscopy) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% Hyclone calf serum at a plating density of 5 × 105 cells/21 cm or 4 × 105 cells/16 cm as described previously (26.Xia Y. Buja L.M. McMillin J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12082-12087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). After 24 h, the serum-containing medium was removed, and the cells were washed and subsequently maintained for 24–72 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, in the absence of serum containing 1% bovine serum albumin (fraction V). The medium was exchanged with fresh serum-free medium at 2 days. The four wells containing myocytes were electrically paced for 72 h using the method of Brevet et al. (34.Brevet A. Pinto E. Peacock J. Stockdale F.E. Science. 1976; 193: 1152-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) as modified by McDonough and Glembotski (23.McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11665-11668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cardiac myocytes in the other six-well dishes were maintained under the same conditions as the stimulated cells but in the absence of electrical stimulation. During the experimental period, the medium bathing the control and paced cells was changed after 48 h to fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 1% bovine serum albumin. In some experiments, cyclosporin A (1 μm) was added to both the control and electrically paced cells at the initiation of electrical stimulation. RNA was isolated with Stat-60 (UL-traspec RNA isolation system, Biotex Laboratories, Houston, TX) at the indicated times from control or electrically paced cells. For Northern analysis, 20 μg of total RNA was fractionated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels containing 0.6% formaldehyde at 50 V for 3 h. Fractionated RNA was transferred onto a Duralon-UV nylon membrane (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) by capillary action for 24 h. After blotting, the RNA was cross-linked to the filter by UV irradiation. Following prehybridization (50% formamide, 25 mm potassium phosphate, 5× SSC, 5× Denhart's solution, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA) overnight at 42 °C, the blot was hybridized in the prehybridization solution plus 1% dextran sulfate and the labeled DNA fragment. After washing, the blots were visualized by autoradiography following storage at −70 °C for various times. To probe for additional transcripts, the blots were stripped in boiling water for 5 min. The prehybridization, hybridization, and washing procedures were repeated as described above. A hybridization probe for Adss1 mRNA was prepared from theStyI–BamHI genomic fragment spanning exon 1 of the Adss1 gene (32.Lewis A.L. Guicherit O.M. Datta S.K. Hanten G.R. Kellems R.E. J. Biol.

Cooper B.F. Rudolph F.B. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4488-4496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was also prepared using random primer labeling. Gata4 andHand1 cDNA probes were excised from pCGGATA4 (35.Sepulveda J.L. Belaguli N. Nigam V. Chen C.Y. Nemer M. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1999; 274: 14188-14197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), have been previously described. The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, NKx2.5, MEF2, and GATA site-directed mutants were generated by a polymerase chain reaction megaprimer procedure (33.Lewis A.L. Xia Y. Datta S.K. McMillin J. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14188-14197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) as described previously. The putative NFAT binding site within 1.9Adss1/CAT was disrupted using a polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis procedure (37.Chin E.R. Olson E.N. Richardson J.A. Yang Q. Humphries C. Shelton J.M. Wu H. Zhu W. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). The primers were designed to replace the NFAT consensus sequence (TGGAAAGT) in theAdss1 promoter with a KpnI cutting site as CCATGG. The primers that were used for polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis of the NFAT site are as follows (mutated nucleotides are capitalized): P1, 5′-CCATGGattgaatcctcctctgctcctgtgtccct-3′; P2, 5′-aagagacctcggggtcgatggtttct-3′. Plasmids used to express NFAT-GFP and ΔNFAT-GFP were constructed in pEGFP-1 (CLONTECH) as described (37.Chin E.R. Olson E.N. Richardson J.A. Yang Q. Humphries C. Shelton J.M. Wu H. Zhu W. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). The expression constructs pCMV-NFAT and pCMV-ΔNFAT were prepared by deletion of the GFP coding region of NFAT-GFP and ΔNFAT-GFP expression vectors, respectively (37.Chin E.R. Olson E.N. Richardson J.A. Yang Q. Humphries C. Shelton J.M. Wu H. Zhu W. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Both plasmids were digested byAgeI and NotI to release the GFP fragment. The correct size fragments of CMV-ΔNFAT and CMV-NFAT were isolated and purified from the gel, blunt-ended, and self-ligated. Primary cardiac myocytes were cultured, transfected with plasmid vectors, and assayed for CAT activity and β-galactosidase, as described (27.Xia Y. Buja L.M. Scarpulla R.C. McMillin J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11399-11404Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Cells in six-well dishes were cotransfected with an 1.9Adss1/CAT reporter plasmid (2 μg) and transcription factor expression plasmids (0.5 μg) that use the CMV promoter to drive expression of either NFAT, ΔNFAT, GATA4, or MEF2C. The pCMVlacZ plasmid (2 μg) was used as an internal control to monitor transfection efficiency. For dose-response experiments, the total input of DNA, including the promoter-reporter plasmid and pCMVlacZ, was held constant as empty vector and/or pCMV-NFAT or pCMV-ΔNFAT was varied. For NFAT localization studies, the cardiac myocytes were transfected with 0.5 μg of pNFAT-GFP. After 72 h of electrical stimulation, GFP localization was determined using fluorescence microscopy (see below). Changes in cardiac myocyte size and sarcomeric morphology were determined as described previously (38.Fabre-Suver C. Hauschka S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4646-4652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) in control and electrically paced cardiac myocytes in the absence and presence of 1 μm cyclosporin A for 72 h. Cells were stained for actin with BODIPY FL phallacidin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). The fluorescent images were viewed and photographed as described below. For cells expressing the NFAT-GFP fusion protein, cardiac myocytes were cultured on laminin-coated (10 μg) glass coverslips inserted into the multiwell dishes. After 24 h, cells were transfected with 2 μg of NFAT-GFP construct, and 6 h later they were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Half of the cells were electrically paced for 72 h, and half were maintained under the same conditions in the absence of electrical pacing. After 72 h, all cells were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells on the coverslips were viewed using an Olympus BX 60 fluorescent microscope equipped with dark field optics with a green filter and photographed using a SPOT digital camera (Diagnostics). The significance of the experimental differences reported here was determined using Student's t test for paired and nonpaired variants. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were cultured for periods of up to 72 h in the absence and presence of electrically induced pacing. To determine if pacing results in increased Adss1gene expression, we isolated total RNA from cardiomyocyte cultures at various times following the initiation of electrical stimulation.Adss1 mRNA levels were assessed by Northern blot hybridization using a murine Adss1 DNA probe (32.Lewis A.L. Guicherit O.M. Datta S.K. Hanten G.R. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22647-22656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).Adss1 mRNA was readily detected in control and paced cultures throughout the 72-h time course of the experiment (Fig.1 A). At 24 h, theAdss1 mRNA levels increased significantly in the electrically paced cultures only, reached a maximum at 48 h, and remained high at 72 h. These results indicate thatAdss1 gene expression is significantly up-regulated in response to electrical pacing. We wished to determine if the nonmuscle Adss2 gene (31.Guicherit O.M. Cooper B.F. Rudolph F.B. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4488-4496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is expressed in rat primary cardiomyocytes and if Adss2 also responds to electrical stimulation. Adss2 mRNA levels were determined by blot hybridization analysis of the RNA isolated at various times from control and electrically paced cardiomyocytes.Adss2 mRNA was present in neonatal cardiac myocytes, and its abundance abruptly declined beginning 48 h following the initiation of electrical stimulation (Fig. 1 A). Thus, electrically induced pacing results in reduced expression of theAdss2 gene (nonmuscle) and the enhanced expression of theAdss1 gene (muscle-specific) in neonatal cardiomyocytes. Previous studies have shown that the promoter and immediate 1.9 kilobase pairs of 5′-flanking sequence of the murine Adss1gene contain all of the cis-regulatory elements required to achieve proper activation and expression in the cardiac lineage (33.Lewis A.L. Xia Y. Datta S.K. McMillin J. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14188-14197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To determine if this regulatory region also contains genetic recognition signals that respond to electrically induced pacing, we measured the expression of a 1.9Adss1/CAT reporter construct following transfection in control and electrically paced rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. Expression of the 1.9Adss1/CAT reporter construct was induced approximately 7-fold in response to pacing (Fig.1 B). These results indicate that the Adss1promoter and 1.9 kilobase pairs of 5′-flanking sequence contain regulatory sequence information that responds to electrically induced pacing. We have previously shown that electrically induced pacing of rat neonatal cardiac myocytes results in a significant increase in intracellular calcium (26.Xia Y. Buja L.M. McMillin J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12082-12087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Calcium can influence cardiac gene expression and the development of cardiac hypertrophy by a Ca2+/calmodulin-mediated activation of calcineurin, an intracellular phosphatase (3.Molkentin J.D. Lu J.

Calcineurin activation and the cellular consequences of this activation, i.e. hypertrophy, are prevented by cyclosporin A. To determine if pacing regulates Adss1 gene expression through a calcineurin-dependent pathway, we examinedAdss1 gene expression in control and electrically paced cardiomyocytes in the presence and absence of cyclosporin A.Adss1 gene expression was measured by Northern blot analysis. Cyclosporin A blocked the induction of Adss1mRNA that normally occurs following 48 h of electrical pacing (Fig. 2 A). As an internal control, we also examined the abundance of β-myosin heavy chain mRNA in control and paced cultures in the presence and absence of cyclosporin A. Here also, we found that the presence of cyclosporin A blocked the induction of β-myosin heavy chain mRNA. In contrast to the effect of cyclosporin A to block induction of Adss1and β-myosin heavy chain mRNAs, the presence of cyclosporin A did not prevent the induction of c-fos, which encodes one of the immediate early proteins of the AP-1 complex. Based on these findings and the published effects of cyclosporin A, it is likely that the effects of electrical stimulation on Adss1 and β-myosin heavy chain gene expression are mediated through a calcineurin pathway, whereas the induction of c-fos is not. Gene transfection experiments were conducted to determine if the effect of cyclosporin A on Adss1 mRNA levels was mediated through transcriptional inhibition. For this purpose, the 1.9Adss1/CAT construct was introduced into control and electrically paced cardiomyocytes in the absence or presence of cyclosporin A. The level of CAT activity in cell extracts was determined 48 h following transfection. The presence of cyclosporin A had no effect on reporter gene expression in the nonstimulated cultures (Fig. 2 B). However, the presence of cyclosporin A completely blocked the activation of the 1.9Adss1/CAT reporter construct in the electrically paced cultures. These results suggest that cyclosporin A blocks the pacing-induced transcriptional activation of the Adss1gene. We also examined the effect of cyclosporin A on the hypertrophic changes in the cardiac myocytes paced by electrical stimulation. After 72 h, control and paced cardiomyocytes, without and with cyclosporin A, were fixed and examined following labeling with the actin stain, BODIPY FL phallaci"

Vav1 expression is necessary for normal T cell development and activation. We previously showed that overexpression of Vav1 in Jurkat T cells potentiates the activity of the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT). The mechanism by which Vav1 participates in TCR signaling events is not clear. Vav1 contains a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domain that has specificity for Rac and other Rho GTPases that have been recently implicated in T cell activation events. Significantly,in vitro tyrosine phosphoryation of Vav1 by Lck activates its exchange activity. This Lck-mediated phosphorylation of Vav1 has been reported to depend upon Tyr-174 in Vav1, a site implicated in Vav1 function by other studies as well. In this report, we demonstrated that Tyr-174 is not required for the TCR-induced phosphorylation of Vav1in vivo. Moreover, mutation of Tyr-174 augmented the ability of Vav1 to up-regulate NF-AT activation as well as the Vav1 GEF function leading to Rac activation. However, we also showed that the GEF activity of Vav1 was neither sufficient nor necessary for potentiation of NF-AT, and thereby we identify a GEF-independent role of Vav1 in potentiating NF-AT-driven transcription. Oncogenic Vav1 in which the amino-terminal 67 amino acids were deleted had elevated GEF activity but did not potentiate NF-AT when overexpressed in Jurkat cells. We also showed that a GEF mutant form of Vav1 that had impaired GEF function could still potentiate NF-AT. These studies reveal a previously unrecognized negative regulatory function of Tyr-174 in Vav1 and suggest that domains other than the Vav1 GEF domain contribute to TCR signals leading to NF-AT activation.

T cell receptor guanine nucleotide exchange factor cysteine-rich Src homology 3 Src homology 2 nuclear factor of activated T cells immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motif p21-activated kinase monoclonal antibody phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate Engagement of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR)1 with antigen or with cross-linking antibodies initiates a signaling cascade that leads to activation of the T cell. One of the proximal events triggered by TCR engagement is the activation of protein-tyrosine kinases, which results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of several substrates. Previous work has demonstrated that activation of the Src tyrosine kinase Lck is necessary to initiate the signaling cascade. Lck is required to phosphorylate the cytoplasmic tails of the CD3 complex (γδε) and the ζ chain of the TCR on tyrosines within motifs designated as immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs). Phosphorylation of the ITAMs provides docking sites for the Src homology-2 (SH2) domains of the Syk family protein-tyrosine kinases, ZAP-70, and Syk. Recruitment of ZAP-70 or Syk to the phosphorylated ITAMs leads to the activation of these protein-tyrosine kinases and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple intracellular substrates. One substrate that is rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to TCR engagement is the 95-kDa protooncogene Vav1. Vav1 is expressed exclusively in hematopoietic cells. However, a homologous protein, Vav2, is ubiquitously expressed. Vav1 is a multi-domain-containing protein consisting of a calponin homology domain, an acidic domain, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domain, a pleckstrin homology domain, a cysteine-rich (CR) domain, and an SH2 domain surrounded by two Src homology-3 (SH3) domains. Vav1 was initially identified as an oncogene based on its ability to transform fibroblasts in a gene transfer experiment (1.Katzav S. Martin-Zanca D. Barbacid M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2283-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). However, the expression, structure and the inducible tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav1 suggests it has an important role in antigen receptor-mediated signal transduction. The importance of Vav1 in lymphocyte development and activation was demonstrated in gene-targeted deletion experiments (2.Turner M. Mee P.J. Costello P.S. Williams O. Price A.A. Duddy L.P.

These studies revealed that mice lacking Vav1 display a profound defect in the positive selection of T cells and undergo negative selection inefficiently. Furthermore, the single positive T cells that develop have impaired calcium mobilization, decreased activation of Erk kinases, decreased activation of NFκB, a failure to form TCR caps following activation, a reduced expression of activation marker CD69, and a reduced expression of CD5 (6.Holsinger L.J.

Neither the sites of phosphorylation nor the protein-tyrosine kinases responsible for phosphorylation of specific sites have been definitively established. However, both Syk and Src family tyrosine kinases have been shown to be able to phosphorylate Vav1. Syk and ZAP-70 as well as the Src family kinase Fyn have been implicated in events leading to the phosphorylation of Vav1 in vivo (9.Michel F. Grimaud L. Tuosto L. Acuto O. J. Biol.

Weiss, unpublished observations. Moreover, Lck has been shown to directly phosphorylate Vav1 in vitro, specifically at tyrosine 174 (12.Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R.D.

Der C.J. Broeck D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1346-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In addition, at least two studies have suggested tyrosine 174 to be a good candidate for phosphorylation by Syk and ZAP-70 (10.Deckert M. Tartare-Deckert S. Couture C. Mustelin T. Altman A. Immunity. 1996; 5: 591-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 14.Brunati A.M. Donella-Deana A. Ruzzene M. Marin O. Pinna L.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 367: 149-152Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar) in vitro. The tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav1 appears to be important in regulating its GEF function. The GEF domain of Vav1 shares considerable homology with that of the oncogene Dbl and is often referred to as a Dbl homology domain. Like Dbl, Vav1 has been shown to catalyze the GDP-GTP exchange for Rho family GTPases in vitro (13.Han J. Das B. Wei W. van Aelst L. Mosteller R.D. Khosravi-Far R. Westwick J.K. Der C.J. Broeck D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1346-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 15.Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). The GEF function of Vav1 appears to exhibit some preference for the Rac GTPase. The Vav1 exchange activity in vitro can be induced by its tyrosine phosphorylation by Lck. Tyr-174 in Vav1 is required for Lck-dependent phosphorylation of Vav1 in vitro(12.Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R.D. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Thus, the exchange activity of Vav1 leading to its activation of Rac and other Rho GTPases would appear to depend upon phosphorylation of Tyr-174. The function of Rac activation in T cells is an area of active investigation. One T-cell receptor-derived signaling event required for T cell activation is induction of the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT). NF-AT plays a critical role in the regulation of many genes including lymphokine genes. NF-AT-directed transcription depends upon Vav1 expression (6.Holsinger L.J. Graef I.A. Swat W. Chi T.

Biol. 1998; 8: 554-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and can be induced by overexpression of Vav1 (16.Wu J. Katzav S. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4337-4346Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpression of Vav1 synergizes with TCR signals and depends upon proximal TCR-signaling machinery. This may reflect a requirement for Vav1 tyrosine phosphorylation. The mechanism by which Vav1 potentiates NF-AT is not understood. However, the effects of its GEF activity on Rac or Rho have been implicated based on studies of Vav1-deficient cells (6.Holsinger L.J. Graef I.A. Swat W. Chi T. Bautista D.M. Davidson L. Lewis R.S. Alt F.W. Crabtree G.R. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 563-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Costello P.S. Walters A.E. Mee P.J. Turner M. Reynolds L.F. Prisco A. Sarner N. Zamoyska R. Tybulewicz V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3035-3040Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Similarly, Rac activation has been implicated in NF-AT-mediated activation in response to FcεRI stimulation in mast cells (17.Turner H. Gomez M. McKenzie E. Kirchem A. Lennard A. Cantrell D.A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data would suggest the following model. TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav1 leads to activation of its GEF function, which in turn leads to activation of Rac. Rac activation then plays an important, yet ill-defined, role in regulating the activation of NF-AT. In this report, we test this model by expressing mutants of Vav1. We examine the importance of Tyr-174 in Vav in regulating its ability to influence inducible Vav tyrosine phosphorylation, NF-AT activation, and Rac GEF activity. Moreover, we directly test the importance of Vav GEF activation in regulating NF-AT activation in an overexpression system. Surprisingly, our results demonstrate that Tyr-174 is not required for inducible Vav phosphorylation, NF-AT activation, or GEF function. Instead, our studies suggest Tyr-174 negatively regulates Vav function. Finally, we show that the ability of Vav1 to activate Rac is neither sufficient nor necessary to stimulate NF-AT-driven transcription. The Jurkat T cell line was maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mmglutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. Cells were stimulated with C305, an anti-Jurkat TCR-β chain monoclonal antibody (mAb) (26.Weiss A. Stobo J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1284-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The anti-phosphotyrosine and the anti-Myc mAbs were derived from the 4G10 and 9E10 hybridomas, respectively. The NF-AT-luciferase reporter plasmid has been previously described (27.Shapiro V.S. Truitt K.E. Imboden J.B. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4051-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The Myc-tagged protooncogenic Vav1 and oncogenic Vav1 plasmids have been described previously (16.Wu J. Katzav S. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4337-4346Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The Y174F, Y209F, and GEF mutants were created with the Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). For transient transfections, 2 × 107 Jurkat cells in 400 μl of RPMI 1640 were electroporated at 250mV, 960 microfarads with 30 μg of DNA total. 20 μg of the various Vav1 constructs were used to obtain equal protein expression. TCR stimulation for analysis of Vav1 tyrosine phosphorylation or Rac activation involved incubating phosphate-buffered saline-washed cells (2 × 107cells/ml) at 37 °C for 15 min followed by the addition of anti-TCR mAb, C305 (1:500). Cells were incubated for 2 min, immediately pelleted, and lysed. For TCR stimulation in luciferase assays, 18 h after transfection cells were either left untreated or were incubated with anti-TCR mAb C305 (1:500) or PMA (25 ng/ml) and ionomycin (1 μm) for 6 h. Cells were then harvested, lysed, and assayed for luciferase activity (27.Shapiro V.S. Truitt K.E. Imboden J.B. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4051-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). For luciferase assays with GEFmtVav, 2 μg of a β-galactosidase reporter under the control of the β-actin promoter were co-transfected into the cells. 6 h after transfection, cells were lysed, and β-galactosidase and luciferase activities were measured. Cells were lysed at 1 × 108 cells/ml in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors). After a 15-min incubation on ice with intermittent vortexing, samples were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitations, lysates were incubated with primary antibody for 1 h on ice and then protein G-Sepharose beads with continuous mixing for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were then washed 3 times in 500 μl of lysis buffer. Samples were eluted by resuspending the beads in reducing 4% SDS sample buffer and heated to 95 °C for 5 min. For the GEF assay, lysates were incubated with 2 μg of glutathioneS-transferase-PAK70–106 and glutathione-Sepharose in a spin column for 15 min at 4 °C with continuous mixing as reported by Manser et al. (20.Manser E. Loo T.H. Koh C.G. Zhao Z.S. Chen X.Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). After incubation, lysates were spun away from the beads, and the beads were washed 3 times with 500 μl of lysis buffer and then spun away. Rac was eluted from the beads by transferring the bead-containing spin column to a fresh catch tube, resuspending the beads in reducing sample buffer, heating the column and beads to 95 °C for 5 min, and spinning the eluted samples into the catch tube. Due to the toxicity of the GEFmt form of Vav1 on the cells, the assay was altered slightly by harvesting cells only 6 h after transfection. Eluted samples from immunoprecipitations or from GEF assays were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore) for analysis by Western blotting. Membranes were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin and incubated with mAb 4G10 or blocked with 5% nonfat milk and incubated with 9E10 followed by goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Reactive proteins were subsequently visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Previous studies have suggested that Tyr-174 is required for Lck-mediated Vav1 phosphorylation in vitro (12.Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R.D. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar) and might play an important role in Syk- or ZAP-70-dependent phosphorylation of Vavin vivo (10.Deckert M. Tartare-Deckert S. Couture C. Mustelin T. Altman A. Immunity. 1996; 5: 591-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 14.Brunati A.M. Donella-Deana A. Ruzzene M. Marin O. Pinna L.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 367: 149-152Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To examine the importance of this sitein vivo, a point mutation was introduced into the acidic domain of Vav1 (Fig. 1 A), changing tyrosine 174 to phenylalanine (Y174F). Myc epitope-tagged cDNA constructs of either wild type Vav1 or Y174F Vav1 were transiently expressed in Jurkat cells. To determine whether this site is required for the tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav1, the Vav1 proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibodies using lysates prepared from unstimulated and TCR-stimulated cells. The immunoprecipitates were blotted with antiphosphotyrosine mAb (Fig. 1 B,top) or anti-Vav1 antibodies (Fig. 1 B,bottom). As illustrated in Fig. 1 B, equivalent levels of Vav1 were immunoprecipitated, yet Y174F Vav1 was still inducibly tyrosine-phosphorylated. Although the overall level of tyrosine phosphorylation of Y174F Vav1 was somewhat reduced compared with wild type Vav1, it is clear that Tyr-174 is neither the sole site of tyrosine phosphorylation within Vav1 nor is Tyr-174 tyrosine phosphorylation required for the TCR-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of other sites. Previous studies from our lab and others reveal that overexpression of Vav1 can potentiate the activation of NF-AT in unstimulated as well as in TCR-stimulated Jurkat cells (16.Wu J. Katzav S. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4337-4346Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 18.Wu J. Motto D.G. Koretzky G.A. Weiss A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 19.Holsinger L.J. Spencer D.M. Austin D.J. Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92 (9804): 9810Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Since Tyr-174 has been shown to be a requisite site for Lck-dependent Vav phosphorylationin vitro and Lck is required for the inducing effects of Vav overexpression on NF-AT activation, we investigated the effect of this mutation on the ability of Vav1 to potentiate NF-AT. Jurkat cells were transfected with a reporter construct containing three NF-AT binding sites from the IL-2 promoter fused to luciferase. The cells were cotransfected with either empty vector, wild type Vav1, or Y174F Vav1 and were left unstimulated or were stimulated with an anti-TCR mAb (Fig. 2). The maximal responsiveness of the transfected reporter was determined using a combination of the phorbol ester PMA and ionomycin, which bypasses TCR-dependent signals. As reported previously, expression of wild type Vav1 potentiates the NF-AT-driven transcription about 5-fold over the activity detected in vector-transfected cells. Surprisingly, the overexpression of the Y174F mutant further augmented NF-AT activity 2–3-fold over that seen with wild type Vav1. In contrast to the gain of function seen with Y174F, in other experiments mutation of tyrosine 209 to phenylalanine (Y209F) potentiated NF-AT to the same extent as that seen with wild type Vav1 (data not shown). These data suggest that Tyr-174 is a specific negative regulatory site of phosphorylation in Vav1. The Lck-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav1 has been implicated in activating its exchange function (13.Han J. Das B. Wei W. van Aelst L. Mosteller R.D. Khosravi-Far R. Westwick J.K. Der C.J. Broeck D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1346-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 15.Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar), and Tyr-174 was shown to be required for Lck phosphorylation of Vav1 in vitro (12.Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R.D. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of the Y174F mutation on the GEF activity of Vav1, we monitored the GTP-loading of Rac in vivo. Jurkat cells were transfected with Myc epitope-tagged Rac and co-transfected with either vector, wild type Vav1, or Y174F Vav1 (Fig. 3). Relative GTP-Rac levels were estimated using an in vitro binding assay that measures GTP-dependent absorption of Rac to the GTPase binding amino terminus of the p21-activated kinase (PAK1) (20.Manser E. Loo T.H. Koh C.G. Zhao Z.S. Chen X.Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). The results shown in Fig. 3 reveal that GTP-loading of Rac can be detected following stimulation of the TCR. This activation of Rac is enhanced by cotransfection of wild type Vav1. Surprisingly, mutation of Tyr-174 markedly increased GTP-loaded Rac levels in the basal state. Moreover, TCR stimulation did not further enhance this response. By inference, the Y174F mutation results in an enhancement of the GEF activity of Vav1 in vivo. The observation that the mutation of Tyr-174 resulted in an enhanced GEF activity as well as an increased potentiation of NF-AT activity led us to investigate whether GEF activity is involved in the activation of NF-AT when Vav1 is overexpressed in Jurkat cells. We first reexamined the effects of oncogenic Vav1, which structurally differs from protooncogenic (wild type) Vav1 by lacking the amino-terminal 67 amino acids (21.Katzav S. Cleveland J.L. Heslop H.E. Pulido D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1912-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This amino-terminal truncation of Vav1 was first identified as a result of a gene transfer assay, which revealed its transforming potential when expressed in NIH 3T3 cells (1.Katzav S. Martin-Zanca D. Barbacid M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2283-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Previous work from our lab demonstrated a difference in NF-AT potentiation between wild type Vav1 and oncogenic Vav1 (16.Wu J. Katzav S. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4337-4346Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We confirmed here (Fig.4 A) that, although the wild type Vav1 potentiated NF-AT, the oncogenic form of Vav1 did not potentiate NF-AT above the level of the vector transfected cells. Furthermore, unlike the potentiating effect of the Y174F mutation on the function of protooncogenic Vav1, the Y174F mutation in oncogenic Vav1 did not enhance NF-AT-dependent transcription. These findings indicate that inactivating the putative negative regulatory function of Tyr-174 cannot reverse the lack of function of oncogenic Vav1 in regulating NF-AT activity. To address whether GEF activity of Vav1 and potentiation of NF-AT are correlated, the GEF activity of oncogenic Vav1 was assayed. The Rac activation assay was performed, as before, using lysates of Jurkat cells transfected with Myc epitope-tagged Rac and cotransfected with either vector, wild type Vav1, Y174F Vav1, or oncogenic Vav1 (Fig.4 C). The cells expressing the oncogenic form of Vav1 demonstrated high levels of GTP-bound Rac in unstimulated Jurkat cells, equivalent to those seen in cells transfected with the Y174F form of Vav1. Oncogenic Vav exhibits much greater GEF activity than wild type Vav1 in Jurkat cells, even though this “activated” form of Vav1 failed to up-regulate NF-AT activity. Combined with the results of the NF-AT assay (Fig. 4 A), these results indicate that the GEF activity of Vav1 is not sufficient to potentiate NF-AT-driven transcription. To investigate whether the GEF activity of Vav1 is necessary for NF-AT activation, a series of mutations were introduced to the GEF domain of Vav1 to disrupt its GEF function. Mutations altering amino acids 338–344 from LLLQELV to IIIQDAA (Fig. 4 B) and referred to as GEFmt were made based on the crystal structure of the Dbl homology domain of Sos (22.Soisson S.M. Nimnual A.S. Uy M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 95: 259-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) as well as reports of the sequences essential to GEF activity of other dbl homology domain-containing proteins (23.Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 62-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Rac activation assay was performed, as before, with lysates of Jurkat cells transfected with Myc epitope-tagged Rac and co-transfected with vector, wild type Vav1, oncogenic Vav1, or the GEFmt form of Vav1 (Fig.4 C). These results confirmed that GEFmtVav1 does not retain any GEF activity for Rac. The ability of GEFmtVav1 to potentiate NF-AT-dependent transcription was then assayed. Jurkat cells were transfected with the NF-AT reporter construct and co-transfected with either vector, wild type Vav1, oncogenic Vav1, or GEFmtVav1. Due to the observed toxicity of the GEFmtVav1 when expressed in Jurkat cells, the potentiation of NF-AT had to be measured only in unstimulated cells at an earlier time following transfection, at 6 h instead of 18 h following electroporation. For the purpose of normalization, each cell was co-transfected with a reporter construct encoding the constitutively active β-actin promoter fused to β-galactosidase. The reported NF-AT activity was normalized to β-galactosidase. As was seen before, NF-AT activity is enhanced by expression of the wild type form of Vav1, whereas no potentiation of NF-AT was seen with the oncogenic form of Vav1. The GEFmt form of Vav1 potentiated NF-AT activity as well or better than the wild type protein. These results indicate the GEF activity of Vav1 is not necessary for potentiation of NF-AT in Jurkat cells. Vav1 contains 30 tyrosine residues and is inducibly tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to TCR stimulation. Recent reports have implicated the phosphorylation of Vav1 in its ability to function as a GEF for Rac. In particular, Tyr-174 has been indicated to be a site for phosphorylation by Lck or by Syk kinases, to bind the SH2 domain of Lck, and to play a role in regulating the GEF activity of Vav1 (10.Deckert M. Tartare-Deckert S. Couture C. Mustelin T. Altman A. Immunity. 1996; 5: 591-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 12.Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R.D.

Der C.J. Broeck D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1346-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Moreover, mutation of this single site eliminated the ability of Lck to phosphorylate Vav1 in vitro (12.Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R.D. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). We had also previously demonstrated that the activating effects of Vav1 depended upon the proximal TCR-regulated signaling machinery, specifically including Lck (16.Wu J. Katzav S. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4337-4346Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In light of these reports, we asked whether phosphorylation of this residue in Vav1 regulated 1) the ability of Vav1 to be tyrosine-phosphorylated following TCR stimulation; 2) the transcriptional activity of NF-AT, or 3) its GEF activity in vivo. Our data suggest that Tyr-174 is not the sole site of tyrosine phosphorylation in Vav, and phosphorylation of this site is not required for TCR-induced Vav1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Our transcriptional and Rac GEF studies suggest Tyr-174 is a negative regulatory site of phosphorylation. Quite surprisingly, further studies to examine the role of the GEF function of Vav1 demonstrate that the GEF function of Vav is neither sufficient nor necessary for its NF-AT activating function when overexpressed in the Jurkat T cell system. Phosphotyrosine blots of Vav1 immunoprecipitates revealed the Y174F mutation did not eliminate TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav1 (Fig. 1). Therefore, we can conclude that Tyr-174 is not the only site of TCR-induced Vav1 tyrosine phosphorylation. This result differs from the in vitro phosphorylation studies by Han et al. (12.Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R.D. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar) and a model proposed by Deckert et al. (10.Deckert M. Tartare-Deckert S. Couture C. Mustelin T. Altman A. Immunity. 1996; 5: 591-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Those reports examined the in vitro phosphorylation of Vav1 with Lck or Syk and Zap-70 protein-tyrosine kinases, respectively. Hanet al. (12.Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R.D. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar) report that the Y174F mutation eliminated all tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav1 when phosphorylated by Lck in vitro. Our report has analyzed the in vivophosphorylation of Vav1. Deckert et al. (10.Deckert M. Tartare-Deckert S. Couture C. Mustelin T. Altman A. Immunity. 1996; 5: 591-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) suggest that phosphorylation of Tyr-174 by a Syk protein-tyrosine kinase could allow for the recruitment of Lck via an interaction of its SH2 domain with Tyr-174. This would suggest that Tyr-174 might be a requisite initiating phosphorylation event. Our studies demonstrate that the phosphorylation of Tyr-174 is neither the sole site of Vav1 phosphorylation nor is it required for phosphorylation of other sites in response to TCR stimulation. It is likely that protein-tyrosine kinases other than those used for in vitro phosphorylation and interaction studies as well as the intracellular milieu may contribute to the tyrosine phosphorylation pattern observed. Surprisingly, overexpression of Vav1 containing the Y174F mutation resulted in an even greater NF-AT response than that seen with wild type Vav1. This was an unexpected result since others suggested this was a critical phosphorylation site for the activation of Vav GEF function (12.Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R.D. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that tyrosine 174 in Vav1 is a site of negative regulation, presumably via phosphorylation, that influences the ability of Vav1 when overexpressed to induce as well as up-regulate TCR-mediated NF-AT-driven transcription. The loss of negative regulatory function appears to be specific for Tyr-174, since a similar mutation altering tyrosine 209 to phenylalanine did not result in a gain of function (data not shown). In an attempt to identify candidate negative regulators that could associate with this site, tyrosine 174 was recognized as a potential docking site for the SH2 domains of the soluble phosphotyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 (18.Wu J. Motto D.G. Koretzky G.A. Weiss A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), a phosphatase known to down-regulate signaling. Indeed, an interaction between SHP-1 and Vav1 has been previously reported (24.Pani G. Fischer K.-D. Mlinaric-Rascan I. Siminovitch K.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 839-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), and we were able to confirm this interaction (data not shown). However, co-immunoprecipitation of SHP1 with Vav1 was maintained in immunoprecipitations of Y174F Vav1 (data not shown) and, thus, SHP1 is not considered to be the effector associating with phosphorylated Tyr-174. At present, the mechanism by which Tyr-174 negatively regulates Vav function is not clear. The mechanism used by Vav1 to potentiate NF-AT-dependent transcription is not known. Efforts to identify the mechanism by which Vav1 potentiates NF-AT have focused on Vav1 as a GEF for Rac. Previous reports, however, have only partially addressed this by examining the isolated GEF domain of Vav1 (6.Holsinger L.J. Graef I.A. Swat W. Chi T. Bautista D.M. Davidson L. Lewis R.S. Alt F.W. Crabtree G.R. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 563-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by monitoring events dependent on transcription factors other than NF-AT (25.Song J.S. Haleem-Smith H. Arudchandran R. Gomez J. Scott P.M. Mill J.F. Tan T.H. Rivera J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 802-810PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we assessed the GEF activity of full-length Vav1 by analyzing Rac-GTP levels in vivo. Our assay shows that Rac is activated in Jurkat cells by the stimulation of the TCR and that this activation is enhanced when Vav1 is overexpressed. Unexpectedly, the levels of activated Rac are further enhanced when Y174F Vav1 is expressed. This suggests that Tyr-174 is not required for Vav1 GEF function, and instead, phosphorylation of this site may negatively regulate its GEF activity. This GEF gain of function combined with the enhanced NF-AT activity resulting from the mutation of Tyr-174 suggested that Vav1 GEF function plays a role in potentiating NF-AT in cells overexpressing Vav1. Rac is one target of Vav GEF function, and it has been implicated in the activation of NF-AT in T cells yet is not enough to induce NF-AT-driven transcription (6.Holsinger L.J. Graef I.A. Swat W. Chi T. Bautista D.M. Davidson L. Lewis R.S. Alt F.W. Crabtree G.R. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 563-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been reported that GTP-bound-Rac or a mutant form of Rac that cannot hydrolyze GTP, RacV12, is sufficient to induce translocation of NF-AT from the cytoplasm to the nucleus yet is not enough to induce NF-AT-driven transcription (17.Turner H. Gomez M. McKenzie E. Kirchem A. Lennard A. Cantrell D.A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This prompted us to determine whether GEF activity of Vav1 is essential for its role in potentiating NF-AT in Jurkat cells. To address whether the GEF activity of Vav1 is sufficient to potentiate NF-AT-driven transcription, we examined the GEF activity of oncogenic Vav1. We have demonstrated here and previously that oncogenic Vav1, in which the first 67 amino acids are deleted, is not capable of potentiating NF-AT (16.Wu J. Katzav S. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4337-4346Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). However, expression of oncogenic Vav1 significantly enhances the levels of activated Rac recovered from cell lysates, indicating a robust GEF activity of the transfected oncogenic Vav1. Therefore, we conclude the GEF activity of Vav1 is not sufficient for activation of NF-AT in Jurkat cells overexpressing Vav1. These results suggest the amino-terminal 67 amino acids, possibly along with other domains, may be responsible for Vav1-mediated NF-AT potentiation. We did not address whether increased levels of nuclear NF-AT are induced by oncogenic Vav1. However, to address whether the GEF activity of Vav1 is necessary for potentiation of NF-AT, a series of point mutations were introduced in the GEF domain of Vav1 (GEFmtVav1) to abolish its GEF activity. Quite surprisingly, although GEFmtVav1 does not induce Rac activation, it still retains the ability to potentiate NF-AT driven transcription. The NF-AT potentiation of GEFmtVav1 along with the GEF activity of oncogenic Vav1 indicates the GEF activity of Vav1 is neither necessary nor sufficient for Vav1, when Vav1 is overexpressed, to potentiate NF-AT driven expression. The mechanism by which Vav1 potentiates NF-AT remains unanswered. Although it could involve increased nuclear translocation of NF-AT, as suggested by studies of Rac function in mast cell (17.Turner H. Gomez M. McKenzie E. Kirchem A. Lennard A. Cantrell D.A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), it is clear from our studies that a GEF-independent function, and presumably Rac-independent function, of Vav1 can contribute to NF-AT regulation. This is not a surprising finding given the multiple protein interaction domains, besides the GEF domain, present in Vav1. Furthermore, although we have shown here that the GEF activity of Vav1 can be dissociated from its ability to potentiate NF-AT when overexpressed in Jurkat cells, our studies cannot rule out an important role of the GEF domain for the normal function of Vav1. All of our studies were performed in the context of cells expressing endogenous wild type Vav1. Thus, Vav1 GEF function could be provided in trans by endogenous Vav1 in our experiments. Nevertheless, our studies have revealed an important negative regulatory function of Tyr-174 and the independent contribution of domains other than the GEF domain in the regulation of signaling pathways leading to NF-AT activation by Vav1. Other assay systems or studies in a Vav1 null background will be required to establish the precise function of the amino terminus, Tyr-174, and the Vav1 GEF domain. We are indebted to Louis Lim for the plasmid used for expression of glutathioneS-transferase-PAK70–106 and to members of the Weiss lab for helpful discussions."

Peptide sequences obtained from this component were used as a basis for the cloning (from human retinal cDNA) and sequencing of a novel member of the leucine-rich repeat extracellular matrix protein family that we have named opticin. Opticin mRNA was found by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in ligament and skin as well as in retina. An open reading frame containing 332 amino acids was identified, the first 19 amino acids representing a signal peptide. The deduced amino acid sequence of the mature protein encodes a 35-kDa protein with a calculated isoelectric point of 5.4. The central domain of this protein consists of six B-type leucine-rich repeats. This domain is flanked by cysteine clusters including a C-terminal two-cysteine cluster containing an additional leucine-rich repeat. The N-terminal region contains a cluster of potential O-glycosylation sites, and analysis of bovine vitreous opticin demonstrated the presence of sialylated O-linked oligosaccharides substituting the core protein. Opticin shows highest protein sequence identity to epiphycan (42%) and osteoglycin (35%) and belongs to Class III of the leucine-rich repeat extracellular matrix protein family."

Based on these experiments, structures for many intermediates have been proposed and the rates for the associated elementary steps have been determined. Some of the structures were inferred based on observed kinetic changes, and others were proposed based on spectroscopic properties. These studies led to a consensus on the structures of some of the intermediates and puzzling disagreements over others. The most controversial issues concern the identities of the so-called “peroxy” (“P”)1 and “ferryl” (“F”) intermediates. The P intermediate has an absorption maximum at ∼607 nm in the difference spectrum with respect to the oxidized enzyme and the F intermediate has a maximum at ∼580 nm in the absorption difference spectrum (37.Musser S.M. Stowell M.H. Chan S.I. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1995; 71: 79-208PubMed Google Scholar). Some investigators have identified properties attributed to a P intermediate during turnover (15.Sucheta A. Georgiadis K.E. Einarsdottir O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 554-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), but, in contrast, others have reported that such an intermediate cannot be detected under turnover conditions (14.Orii Y. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1988; 550: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).

Therefore, structures containing one versus two oxygen atoms can be distinguished, and the presence of protons as well as the effect of hydrogen bonding can be assessed (16.Ogura T. Takahashi S.

Resonance Raman scattering is thus considered as the most reliable technique to identify the intermediates. However, resonance Raman experiments were performed under different conditions in various laboratories, which in some cases has caused it to be difficult to make direct comparisons between the results because each has its own strengths and weaknesses. For example, the continuous flow method used by Kitagawa's group (16.Ogura T. Takahashi S. Hirota S. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Yoshikawa S. Appelman E.H. Kitagawa T. J. Am. Chem.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7357-7362Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 26.Varotsis C. Woodruff W.H. Babcock G.T. J. Biol.

Acta. 1995; 1231: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). However, with pulsed lasers, more accurate time delays can be measured. With the re-circulating system used by Kitagawa and co-workers, excellent signal-to-noise is obtained by use of long integration times, but it is difficult to generate a high concentration of molecular O2, so the time course of the intermediates becomes obscured. In our work, it was felt that the continuous flow method without re-circulation is a good compromise that gives sufficient signal-to-noise and time resolution to address the central issues. The flow dynamics limitations of our continuous flow method are discussed under “Materials and Methods.” As a result of the different approaches and because the spectra of the P and F states are weak and difficult to obtain, there is no consensus on the P intermediate, although there is partial agreement on the other intermediates during the single turnover reaction. In addition, the kinetics of the formation and decay of the various intermediates detected in the resonance Raman spectra require further study and the relationship between the electron transfer events and the formation of each intermediate are needed to clarify the molecular mechanism of the O2 reduction. Identification of the P and F intermediates and determination of their structures are particularly important, because it was reported that the redox coupling that enables proton translocation only occurs at two of the steps in the reduction of oxygen to water: the P to F step and the F to the hydroxy step (40.Wikstrom M. Nature. 1989; 338: 776-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). However, only one half of the charge is translocated during this oxidative phase in which the enzyme becomes fully oxidized. The remaining charge is only translocated when the oxidized enzyme is immediately re-reduced (the reductive phase) (42.Verkhovsky M.I. Jasaitis A. Verkhovskaya M.L. Morgan J.E. Wikstrom M. Nature. 1999; 400: 480-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Proper understanding of the structures and kinetics of these intermediates is thereby extremely important in order to formulate the mechanism by which the redox events are coupled to proton translocation and how the energy is stored at the end of the oxidative phase to be released during the reductive phase (42.Verkhovsky M.I. Jasaitis A. Verkhovskaya M.L. Morgan J.E. Wikstrom M. Nature. 1999; 400: 480-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 43.Rousseau D.L. Nature. 1999; 400: 412-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In this article, we report the kinetics of the resonance Raman lines that are associated with the various intermediates during turnover to establish the mechanistic pathway for oxygen reduction and we report the associated changes in the oxidation state of heme a to monitor the electron transfer events. The kinetic behavior of the Raman mode at 355 cm−1 was also measured to determine its time dependence, as there is a lack of consensus on the kinetics of its formation and decay. Cytochrome c oxidase was isolated from bovine heart muscle by the methods of Yonetani (44.Yonetani T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and of Yoshikawa et al. (45.Yoshikawa S. Choc M.G. O'Toole M.C. Caughey W.S. J Biol Chem. 1977; 252: 5498-5508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and stored under liquid nitrogen until ready for use. For the Raman measurements the enzyme was solubilized in phosphate buffer (100 mm) at pH 7.4 with 1% dodecyl β-d-maltoside. It was reduced with 20 mmascorbate and catalytic amounts of cytochrome c, and then exposed to carbon monoxide. To initiate the catalytic reaction, the CO-bound cytochromec oxidase sample was placed in one syringe of the continuous flow apparatus described previously (22.Han S. Ching Y.-c. Rousseau D.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 9445-9451Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and a buffer solution saturated with either natural abundance or isotopically substituted (18O2) oxygen (1.4 mm) was placed in the other syringe. The two solutions were mixed in a Wiskind four grid mixer and passed into the flow cell with a 0.25 × 0.25-mm cross section. One laser beam at the entrance of the cell photodissociated the CO from the enzyme, and a second laser beam was used to probe the resonance Raman spectrum. The separation between the two beams could be changed so as to give a delay time ranging from ∼15 μs (beam overlap) to ∼3 ms. The actual time evolution of the intermediates is determined not only by the separation between the photolysis and the probe beam but also by the flow dynamics of the solution in the cell. Laminar flow gives a velocity distribution perpendicular to the flow direction, and therefore a distribution in the time constants for the intermediates. On the other hand, “plug” flow gives a homogeneous velocity in the flow direction as if a plug were moving down the channel. A series of partial photolysis measurements across the cell were made to determine the variation in flow velocity, and it was found that the flow was intermediate between the plug and the laminar limits. By collecting data from only the central portion of the laser pathlength through the sample (∼80% of the width of the cell), the velocity variation was within ±25% of the average velocity. Therefore, the measured time constants have an uncertainty of this magnitude. For most of the experiments, the output from a krypton ion laser at 413.1 nm was used to both photodissociate the CO from the enzyme and probe the spectrum of the reaction products. By blocking the first beam, it was confirmed that no spontaneous replacement of the CO by oxygen was occurring under our conditions. By replacing the oxygen in the buffer by nitrogen, full photodissociation of the CO from the enzyme by the photolysis beam was observed. For the series of experiments to measure the line at 355 cm−1, the output from a frequency doubled Ti-sapphire laser (pumped by an argon ion laser) with an output at 427 nm was used for both beams. The scattered light was dispersed by a 1.25-m polychromator and detected by either a linear photodiode array or a CCD camera. The high frequency region (1000–1800 cm−1) of the resonance Raman spectrum of heme proteins contains vibrational modes that are sensitive to the coordination, spin state and oxidation state of the heme moiety. For cytochrome c oxidase, the contributions to the spectrum from hemes a anda 3 overlap. However, several modes have been identified that have been demonstrated to be characteristic of each of the hemes and can thereby be used to monitor the properties of each without interference from the other (18.Han S.H.

Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4938-4946Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In particular, we have shown that the lines in the spectrum at 1518, 1611, 1623, and 1647 cm−1 can be used as markers of the oxidation state of hemea. The lines at 1518, 1611, and 1623 cm−1originate from the reduced heme, whereas the line at 1647 cm−1 originates from the oxidized heme. The changes in the resonance Raman spectra of cytochrome coxidase in the high frequency region during the reaction of the enzyme with oxygen are shown in Fig. 1 for several different time points. A rapid decrease in the intensity of the lines at 1518, 1611, and 1623 cm−1 and a corresponding increase in the intensity of the line at 1647 cm−1 occurs during the first ∼100 μs. Subsequently, the changes are more gradual, such that the formation of the fully oxidized spectrum of hemea nears completion only at ∼3 ms. Changes in the spin state, judged by the the intensity of the low spin marker line at ∼1584 cm−1 and the high spin marker line at ∼1570 cm−1, occur on the 0.1–10-ms time scale. These data demonstrate a significant growth of the high spin population in this time range. Since heme a is always low spin, the change is attributed to heme a 3. The time dependence of the oxidation of heme a, plotted in Fig.2, obtained by monitoring the change in intensity of the line at 1518 cm−1, clearly demonstrates that heme a becomes oxidized by at least two separate processes. A rapid process occurs in which the heme is partially oxidized with an apparent rate constant of ∼40,000 s−1, and it is followed by a slower process with an apparent rate constant of ∼1,000 s−1.Figure 2Time dependence of the oxidation of hemea. The squares are the experimental data points based on the resonance Raman line at 1518 cm−1, which was used to determine the population of the reduced form of heme a. The dashed curve was obtained from the model presented in Fig. 6 using the rate constants listed in Table I.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the low frequency region (100–1000 cm−1) of the resonance Raman spectra, in addition to the modes associated with the heme macrocycles, oxygen isotope-sensitive modes associated with the reduction intermediates are also present during the reaction of cytochrome c oxidase with oxygen. However, the iron-oxygen modes are very weak, so except for the primary Fe-O2intermediate they cannot be readily identified in the spectra. By using oxygen isotope difference spectra (16O2 −18O2), the modes involving the oxygen can be located as shown in Fig. 3 in which the laser excitation wavelength was 413.1 nm. Two oxygen isotope-sensitive lines are present in these data. The stronger line at 568 cm−1 for 16O2 that shifts to 547 cm−1 for 18O2 is assigned as the Fe-O2 stretching mode, as shown previously (20.Han S.W. Ching Y.C. Rousseau D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2248-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and there is also a propensity for CD39 to undergo autophosphorylation reactions (data not shown). In addition, we have shown that cellular interactions with free fatty acids modulate ATPDase enzymatic activity in vitro and have postulated that acylation could also influence CD39 structure (10.Robson S.C.

Here we study this possibility and specifically examine palmitoylation, a reversible and potentially regulated post-translational modification, in which the 16-carbon saturated fatty acid is attached to intracytoplasmic cysteine residues via high energy thioester linkages (11.Bizzozero O.A. Tetzloff S.U. Bharadwaj M. Neurochem.

This process is associated with strengthened membrane interaction and preferential targeting of the native protein to caveolae. This observation may be pertinent to differential functions, membrane expression and regulation of the increasing number of cell-associated or soluble CD39 family members (8.Zimmermann H.

Bouvier M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 13.Dunphy J.T. Linder M.E. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1996; 271: 22315-22320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Truncated forms of CD39 lacking the N-terminal intracytoplasmic region, and the associated Cys13 residue (5.Esch J.S.A. Sévigny J. Kaczmarek E. Siegel J.B. Imai M. Koziak K. Beaudoin A.R. Robson S.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2248-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), were not subject to palmitoylation. This process of palmitoylation in the native protein appeared to be constitutive and to contribute to the integral membrane association of this ectonucleotidase. Thus, a small proportion of this N-terminal truncated CD39 protein was also found in conditioned medium of transfected cells in a soluble form (Fig. 3). The apparent targeting of CD39 to caveolae also appeared linked to this post-translational modification as the mutant lacking this potential palmitoylation site was not detected in these plasmalemmal microdomains (Fig.4 D).Because the hydrolysis of palmitic acid from CD39 could occur in an alkaline environment, it was presumed that the linkage was a thioester bond (15.Tao N.B. Wagner S.J. Lublin D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22315-22320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 27.Bach R. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4227-4231Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We found no evidence for myristoylation of CD39 (Fig.2 C), and there are no putative N-terminal glycine residues that would be accessible for amide N-acylation linkages (4.Maliszewski C.R. Delespesse G.J. Schoenborn M.A. Armitage R.J. Fanslow W.C. Nakajima T. Baker E. Sutherland G.R. Poindexter K. Birks C. Alpert A. Friend D. Gimpel S.D. Gayle III, R.B. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3574-3583PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, unlike the majority of acylated membrane proteins, palmitic acid substitution of CD39 did not require prior modification by myristoyl groups. Nor was there any potential for prenylation at the C-terminal region, given the absence of strict consensus sequences in this region (13.Dunphy J.T. Linder M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Other proteins that are only palmitoylated are generally targeted to the inner surface of the plasma membrane and include Gqα family members (12.Morello J.P. Bouvier M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 14.Degtyarev M.Y. Spiegel A.M. Jones T.L.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30898-30903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and neuronal proteins,e.g. neuromodulin and SNAP-25 (11.Bizzozero O.A. Tetzloff S.U. Bharadwaj M. Neurochem. Res. 1994; 19: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).In general, the functional significance of palmitoylation remains unclear. In part, this relates to technical limitations with respect to the generation of mutants, that preclude palmitoylation by conversion of Cys residues or by deletion mutagenesis. These changes may also influence protein structure ab initio (13.Dunphy J.T. Linder M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). However, alternative approaches are limited in that proposed inhibitors of palmitoylation, such as tunicamycin (28.Patterson S.I. Skene J.H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 521-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), would be concomitant inhibitors of CD39 glycosylation (5.Esch J.S.A. Sévigny J. Kaczmarek E. Siegel J.B. Imai M. Koziak K. Beaudoin A.R. Robson S.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2248-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Given this caveat, it remains feasible that palmitoylation could influence the association of CD39 with the cell membrane (29.Joseph M. Nagaraj R. Indian J. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 34: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) and could also facilitate interactions with other acylated proteins, such as caveolin (30.Melkonian K.A. Ostermeyer A.G. Chen J.Z. Roth M.G. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3910-3917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar).The potential multimerization of CD39 (6.Wang T.F. Ou Y. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24814-24821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) may be facilitated by acylation with intermolecular interactions within the cholesterol and sphingolipid-rich caveolar microdomains of the plasma membrane (30.Melkonian K.A. Ostermeyer A.G. Chen J.Z. Roth M.G. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3910-3917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The formation of multimers of membrane proteins has been also observed for the seven-transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptors; these undergo C-terminal palmitoylation (13.Dunphy J.T. Linder M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Proteins with N-terminal acylation, related to the GTPases, can be also potentially linked to purinergic signaling events (31.Mumby S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 32.Dubyak G.R. Elmoatassim C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C577-C606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such intrinsic protein structural changes could all be linked to the promotion of functional multimeric units that modulate biochemical activity. In this regard, we have previously shown that supplementation of endothelial cell cultures with exogenous palmitic acid may boost ATPDase activity by approximately 50%; however, whether this is a direct effect on the CD39 or operative through modulation of membrane lipids remains unclear (10.Robson S.C. Daoud S. Begin M. Cote Y.P. Siegel J.B. Bach F.H. Beaudoin A.R. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1997; 8: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 33.Stulnig T.M. Berger M. Sigmund T. Raederstorff D. Stockinger H. Waldhausl W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Moreover, membrane cholesterol is essential for caveolar function (34.Chang W.J. Rothberg K.G. Kamen B.A. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Thus, pathological changes in cholesterol homeostasis have the potential to adversely influence vascular ATPDase activity, perturb other thromboregulatory proteins localized within caveolae,e.g. eNOS (16.Shaul P.W.

Schnitzer J.E. Sessa W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Topol E.J. Atherosclerosis and Coronary Artery Disease. 1. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1996: 607-637Google Scholar).Biologically active CD39 is expressed mainly in the plasma membrane and is subject or responsive to different forms of surface stimulation (10.Robson S.C. Daoud S. Begin M. Cote Y.P. Siegel J.B. Bach F.H. Beaudoin A.R. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1997; 8: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar,22.Robson S.C. Kaczmarek E. Siegel J.B. Candinas D. Koziak K. Millan M. Hancock W.W. Bach F.H. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Although we have not yet examined this in detail, there is the possibility that CD39 may be recycled to and from cell membranes via sequential actions of palmitoyltransferases and palmitoyl-protein thioesterases (13.Dunphy J.T. Linder M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar).The biological properties of caveolae appear to bolster these speculations. These plasmalemmal microdomains have the potential to compartmentalize signaling responses and are enriched in proteins intimately associated with the regulation of calcium flux and signaling pathways (38.Schlegel A. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Galbiati F. Mehta P. Zhang X.L. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Cell. Signalling. 1998; 10: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Our data imply that both CD39 antigen and the associated ATPase activity are associated with caveolae (Figs. 4 and 5). The targeting of palmitoylated CD39 to caveolae could influence defined G protein-coupled receptors within this plasmalemmal microenvironment (17.Shaul P.W. Anderson R.G.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 19: L843-L851Google Scholar).We show that the prototype CD39 family member undergoes palmitoylation at the N-terminal intracytoplasmic domain and is also targeted to caveolae. This post-translational modification would not be anticipated in CD39L1 but may also occur in other CD39-like proteins,e.g. CD39L3 has putative palmitoylation sites within both the N- and C-intracytoplasmic regions (20.Chadwick B.P. Frischauf A.M. Genomics. 1998; 50: 357-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 39.Smith T.M. Kirley T.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1386: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Other members of the CD39 family have only a single transmembrane sequence at the N terminus that, in the case of the macrophage-associated CD39L4, undergoes cleavage to result in a soluble enzyme (21.Mulero J.J. Yeung G. Nelken S.T. Ford J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20064-20067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). How any of these modifications influence the pathophysiological function(s) of the CD39/E-NTPDase family members remains to be determined. The vascular ATP or NTP diphosphohydrolase (ATPDase or NTPDase; EC 3.6.1.5),1 now known to be CD39, is a plasma membrane-bound enzyme that plays the dominant role in the hydrolysis of extracellular tri- and/or diphosphate nucleotides in blood (1.Kaczmarek E. Koziak K. Sévigny J. Siegel J.B. Anrather J. Beaudoin A.R. Bach F.H. Robson S.C. J. Biol.

Our recent data from cd39-null mice indicate that this specific ectonucleotidase also plays a pivotal role in the regulation of an ADP-purinoreceptor P2Y1 function; absence of ATPDase activity results in desensitization of this G protein-coupled receptor with profound effects on hemostasis and thromboregulation (3.Enjoyji K.

Established topological models of CD39 suggest the presence of two transmembrane domains at both termini of the molecule and an extracellular loop containing a central hydrophobic region (1.Kaczmarek E.

Chem. 1998; 273: 24814-24821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Examination of CD39 amino acid sequences reveals a total of 11 cysteine (Cys) residues, with an unpaired Cys13 contained within the intracellular N terminus of the protein (4.Maliszewski C.R.

Hence, unlike the majority of acylated membrane proteins, palmitic acid substitution of CD39 did not require prior modification by myristoyl groups. Nor was there any potential for prenylation at the C-terminal region, given the absence of strict consensus sequences in this region (13.Dunphy J.T. Linder M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Other proteins that are only palmitoylated are generally targeted to the inner surface of the plasma membrane and include Gqα family members (12.Morello J.P. Bouvier M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 14.Degtyarev M.Y. Spiegel A.M. Jones T.L.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30898-30903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and neuronal proteins,e.g. neuromodulin and SNAP-25 (11.Bizzozero O.A. Tetzloff S.U. Bharadwaj M. Neurochem. Res. 1994; 19: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).In general, the functional significance of palmitoylation remains unclear. In part, this relates to technical limitations with respect to the generation of mutants, that preclude palmitoylation by conversion of Cys residues or by deletion mutagenesis. These changes may also influence protein structure ab initio (13.Dunphy J.T. Linder M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). However, alternative approaches are limited in that proposed inhibitors of palmitoylation, such as tunicamycin (28.Patterson S.I. Skene J.H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 521-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), would be concomitant inhibitors of CD39 glycosylation (5.Esch J.S.A. Sévigny J. Kaczmarek E. Siegel J.B. Imai M. Koziak K. Beaudoin A.R. Robson S.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2248-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Given this caveat, it remains feasible that palmitoylation could influence the association of CD39 with the cell membrane (29.Joseph M. Nagaraj R. Indian J. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 34: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) and could also facilitate interactions with other acylated proteins, such as caveolin (30.Melkonian K.A. Ostermeyer A.G. Chen J.Z. Roth M.G. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3910-3917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar).The potential multimerization of CD39 (6.Wang T.F. Ou Y. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24814-24821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) may be facilitated by acylation with intermolecular interactions within the cholesterol and sphingolipid-rich caveolar microdomains of the plasma membrane (30.Melkonian K.A. Ostermeyer A.G. Chen J.Z. Roth M.G. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3910-3917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The formation of multimers of membrane proteins has been also observed for the seven-transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptors; these undergo C-terminal palmitoylation (13.Dunphy J.T. Linder M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Proteins with N-terminal acylation, related to the GTPases, can be also potentially linked to purinergic signaling events (31.Mumby S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 32.Dubyak G.R. Elmoatassim C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C577-C606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such intrinsic protein structural changes could all be linked to the promotion of functional multimeric units that modulate biochemical activity. In this regard, we have previously shown that supplementation of endothelial cell cultures with exogenous palmitic acid may boost ATPDase activity by approximately 50%; however, whether this is a direct effect on the CD39 or operative through modulation of membrane lipids remains unclear (10.Robson S.C.

Raederstorff D. Stockinger H. Waldhausl W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Moreover, membrane cholesterol is essential for caveolar function (34.Chang W.J. Rothberg K.G. Kamen B.A. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Thus, pathological changes in cholesterol homeostasis have the potential to adversely influence vascular ATPDase activity, perturb other thromboregulatory proteins localized within caveolae,e.g. eNOS (16.Shaul P.W.

Topol E.J. Atherosclerosis and Coronary Artery Disease. 1. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1996: 607-637Google Scholar).Biologically active CD39 is expressed mainly in the plasma membrane and is subject or responsive to different forms of surface stimulation (10.Robson S.C. Daoud S. Begin M. Cote Y.P. Siegel J.B. Bach F.H. Beaudoin A.R. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1997; 8: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar,22.Robson S.C. Kaczmarek E. Siegel J.B. Candinas D. Koziak K. Millan M. Hancock W.W. Bach F.H. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Although we have not yet examined this in detail, there is the possibility that CD39 may be recycled to and from cell membranes via sequential actions of palmitoyltransferases and palmitoyl-protein thioesterases (13.Dunphy J.T. Linder M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar).The biological properties of caveolae appear to bolster these speculations. These plasmalemmal microdomains have the potential to compartmentalize signaling responses and are enriched in proteins intimately associated with the regulation of calcium flux and signaling pathways (38.Schlegel A. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Galbiati F. Mehta P. Zhang X.L. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Cell. Signalling. 1998; 10: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Our data imply that both CD39 antigen and the associated ATPase activity are associated with caveolae (Figs. 4 and 5). The targeting of palmitoylated CD39 to caveolae could influence defined G protein-coupled receptors within this plasmalemmal microenvironment (17.Shaul P.W. Anderson R.G.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 19: L843-L851Google Scholar).We show that the prototype CD39 family member undergoes palmitoylation at the N-terminal intracytoplasmic domain and is also targeted to caveolae. This post-translational modification would not be anticipated in CD39L1 but may also occur in other CD39-like proteins,e.g. CD39L3 has putative palmitoylation sites within both the N- and C-intracytoplasmic regions (20.Chadwick B.P. Frischauf A.M. Genomics. 1998; 50: 357-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 39.Smith T.M. Kirley T.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1386: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Other members of the CD39 family have only a single transmembrane sequence at the N terminus that, in the case of the macrophage-associated CD39L4, undergoes cleavage to result in a soluble enzyme (21.Mulero J.J. Yeung G. Nelken S.T. Ford J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20064-20067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). How any of these modifications influence the pathophysiological function(s) of the CD39/E-NTPDase family members remains to be determined. In this manuscript, we demonstrate that CD39 could undergo a process of S-acylation and show that labeled free palmitic acid could associate with the native protein by a thioester bond, as observed for other membrane proteins (12.Morello J.P. Bouvier M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 13.Dunphy J.T. Linder M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 15.Tao N.B. Wagner S.J. Lublin D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22315-22320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Truncated forms of CD39 lacking the N-terminal intracytoplasmic region, and the associated Cys13 residue (5.Esch J.S.A. Sévigny J. Kaczmarek E. Siegel J.B. Imai M. Koziak K. Beaudoin A.R. Robson S.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2248-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), were not subject to palmitoylation. This process of palmitoylation in the native protein appeared to be constitutive and to contribute to the integral membrane association of this ectonucleotidase. Thus, a small proportion of this N-terminal truncated CD39 protein was also found in conditioned medium of transfected cells in a soluble form (Fig. 3). The apparent targeting of CD39 to caveolae also appeared linked to this post-translational modification as the mutant lacking this potential palmitoylation site was not detected in these plasmalemmal microdomains (Fig.4 D). Because the hydrolysis of palmitic acid from CD39 could occur in an alkaline environment, it was presumed that the linkage was a thioester bond (15.Tao N.B. Wagner S.J. Lublin D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22315-22320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 27.Bach R. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4227-4231Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We found no evidence for myristoylation of CD39 (Fig.2 C), and there are no putative N-terminal glycine residues that would be accessible for amide N-acylation linkages (4.Maliszewski C.R. Delespesse G.J. Schoenborn M.A. Armitage R.J. Fanslow W.C. Nakajima T. Baker E. Sutherland G.R. Poindexter K. Birks C. Alpert A. Friend D. Gimpel S.D. Gayle III, R.B. J.

E., Arrell, D. K., Foster, D. B., Strauss, J. D., Heinonen, T. Y., Furmaniak-Kazmierczak, E., Cote, G. P., and Mak, A. S. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 23433–23439). In this study, we provide biochemical evidence implicating a role for PAK in Ca2+-independent contraction of smooth muscle via phosphorylation of caldesmon. Mass spectroscopy data show that stoichiometric phosphorylation occurs at Ser657 and Ser687 abutting the calmodulin-binding sites A and B of chicken gizzard caldesmon, respectively. Phosphorylation of Ser657 and Ser687 has an important functional impact on caldesmon. PAK-phosphorylation reduces binding of caldesmon to calmodulin by about 10-fold whereas binding of calmodulin to caldesmon partially inhibits PAK phosphorylation. Phosphorylated caldesmon displays a modest reduction in affinity for actin-tropomyosin but is significantly less effective in inhibiting actin-activated S1 ATPase activity in the presence of tropomyosin. We conclude that PAK-phosphorylation of caldesmon at the calmodulin-binding sites modulates caldesmon inhibition of actin-myosin ATPase activity and may, in concert with the actions of Rho-kinase, contribute to the regulation of Ca2+sensitivity of smooth muscle contraction.

In vitro, caldesmon-mediated inhibition of actomyosin ATPase activity can be regulated by calcium binding proteins, including calmodulin (17.Chacko S. Miyata H. Horiuchi K.Y. Prog. Clin. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11896-11901Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Our finding that PAK induces Ca2+-independent contraction in skinned smooth muscle fibers (8.Van Eyk J.E. Arrell D.K. Foster D.B. Strauss J.D. Heinonen T.Y. Furmaniak-Kazmierczak E. Cote G.P. Mak A.S. J. Biol.

Shirinsky V.P. Marston S.B. Vorotnikov A.V. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 254-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) suggest that PAK phosphorylation of caldesmon may be involved in the regulation of Ca2+ sensitivity of smooth muscle contraction. Here, we report biochemical evidence supporting a role of PAK in the Ca2+ sensitivity of smooth muscle contraction via phosphorylation of caldesmon. Specifically, we have identified the sites of phosphorylation and have studied phosphorylated caldesmon with respect to its affinity for actin-tropomyosin and calmodulin and its ability to inhibit actomyosin ATPase activity. h-Caldesmon and α β tropomyosin were purified from chicken gizzards essentially as described by Bretscher (21.Bretscher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12873-12880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Skeletal muscle actin was purified from rabbit muscle as outlined in (22.Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1982; 24: 271-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Smooth muscle myosin S1 was prepared by papain cleavage of gizzard myosin (23.Greene L.E. Sellers J.R. Eisenberg E. Adelstein R.S. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 530-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Rabbit skeletal myosin S1(A1) was prepared by cleavage with chymotrypsin as described in (24.Margossian S.S. Lowey S. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 55-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Recombinant murine PAK3, was expressed from the plasmid pGST-mPAK3 inEscherichia coli JM101 and/or JM110 cells as described before (8.Van Eyk J.E. Arrell D.K. Foster D.B. Strauss J.D. Heinonen T.Y.

Caldesmon (1–2 mg/ml) was phosphorylated by GST-mPAK3 (∼5 μg/ml), at 37 °C for 60 min, in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (1–5 × 105 cpm/nmol), 0.5 mm DTT. Quantification of phosphorylation and analysis of phosphorylated amino acids were performed as described before (25.Childs T.J. Watson M. Sanghera J. Campbell D. Pelech S. Mak A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22853-22859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 200 μg of caldesmon was dissolved in 200 μl of 100 mm NH4HCO3, pH 7.9, containing 10 μg of endoproteinase Glu-C. The digestion was carried out overnight at room temperature. The digest solutions were evaporated to dryness and redissolved in 5% acetic acid (200 μl). For nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry analysis, 20-μl aliquots of the sample solutions were desalted using ZipTipTM C18 (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Approximately 1–2 μl of the desalted solutions were used for both precursor ion scanning and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analyses. Phosphopeptides were detected by precursor ion scanning (precursors ofm/z 79) in negative ion mode on a API 3000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Perkin Elmer/SCIEX Concord, ON, Canada). Precursor ion spectra were acquired in multiple channel acquisition mode, typically over a period of 3 min (m/z400–2000, 0.5 mass units step size, 5 msec dwell time). Argon was used as the collision gas, and the collision offset voltage was 80 V. Phosphopeptide sequencing was achieved by MS/MS using a prototype quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometer (QqTOFMS, Perkin Elmer/SCIEX) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ionization source. Product ion spectra were carried out in positive ion mode using argon as the collision gas and a collision energy of 60 eV (laboratory frame of reference). MS/MS spectra were typically acquired every 2 s over a period of 3 min. Interaction between calmodulin and phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated caldesmon was studied using intrinsic Trp fluorescence as described previously (15.Graether S.P. Heinonen T.Y.K. Raharjo W.H. Jin J.-P. Mak A.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 364-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The binding buffer was 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT. The excitation wavelength was 295 nm with a slit width of 10 nm. Intensity measurement was made with a 290-nm filter at 330 nm and a slit width of 10 nm. Binding curves were fitted to a binding equation to obtain dissociation constants as described before (15.Graether S.P. Heinonen T.Y.K. Raharjo W.H. Jin J.-P. Mak A.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 364-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) except that binding stoichiometry was set to 1 mol of caldesmon per mol of calmodulin as previously determined (15.Graether S.P. Heinonen T.Y.K. Raharjo W.H. Jin J.-P. Mak A.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 364-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Two nmol of actin was mixed with 0.4 nmol of tropomyosin and 0 to 1.5 nmol of phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated caldesmon in 200 μl of binding buffer (40 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm DTT). Protein mixtures were allowed to equilibrate for 30 min prior to centrifugation at 100,000 × g in a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge. Pellets were rinsed with actin-binding buffer once and dissolved in 100 μl of 0.05% (v/v) TFA in water. Relative amounts of caldesmon, tropomyosin, and actin were determined by high performance liquid chromatography using a Zorbax SB300-C8 HPLC column (5.Van Eyk J.E. Thomas L. Tripet B. Wiesner R.J. Pearlstone J.R. Farah C.S. Reinach F.C. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10529-10537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Actin-activated myosin S1 ATPase assays in the presence and absence of tropomyosin were conducted in a 96-well ELISA plate (100 μl assay volume). Inorganic phosphate was determined colorimetrically as described in (38.Chifflet S. Torriglia A. Chiesa R. Tolosa S. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). ATPase buffer contained 40 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT. Myosin S1 ATPase activity was determined for reaction mixtures containing 0–4 μm caldesmon, 10 μm actin, and 0.5 μm S1 with or without 2 μm tropomyosin for 10 min at 37 °C. ATPase reaction was initiated with 4 mmATP and terminated by adding 100 μl of a solution containing 3% ascorbic acid, 0.5 m HCl, 4% SDS, and 0.5% (w/v) ammonium molybdate. Color was allowed to develop for 6 min prior to the addition of 2% sodium citrate and 2% sodium m-arsenite followed by 10-min incubation before absorbance at 650 nm was measured in a Molecular Dynamics E-max plate reader. Phosphate content was determined by comparison to a potassium phosphate standard curve. Less than 10% of the ATP was hydrolyzed over the course of the reaction. Phosphate release was linear within the 10-min reaction. Chicken gizzard h-caldesmon was phosphorylated in vitrousing a constitutively active murine GST-PAK3 to a maximum of 2 mol of phosphate per mol of caldesmon as shown in Fig.1. Only phosphorylated Ser was recovered from a hydrolysate of 32P-labeled caledesmon (Fig. 1,inset). To locate the phosphorylation sites, caldesmon phosphorylated by GST-PAK to 2 mol of phosphate/mol of protein was subjected to digestion by endoproteinase Glu-C, which cleaves peptide bonds on the COOH-side of Glu residues. The resulting digest was analyzed for phosphorylated peptides by precursor ion scanning as described in “Materials and Methods.” Two major doubly deprotonated ions were detected (Fig.2 A, peaks a andb) together with a number of minor peaks representing minor sites of phosphorylation. MS/MS sequence analysis determined that peaka (m/z 648.0) and peak b(m/z 754.0) correspond to two singly phosphorylated peptides, Gly651-Val-Arg-Asn-Ile-Lys-p-Ser-Met-Trp-Glu660and Thr678-Ala-Gly-Leu-Lys-Val-Gly-Val-Ser-p-Ser-Arg-Ile-Asn-Lys-Glu691, A and B, respectively (data not shown). Ser657, being the only Ser in peptide A, can be unambiguously assigned as the site of phosphorylation in this peptide. There are two adjacent Ser residues in peptide B however. MS/MS sequence analysis indicated that Ser687 is most likely the site of phosphorylation (Fig.2 C) because a b-type fragment ion atm/z 813.5 corresponding to the unphosphorylated peptide, Thr-Ala-Gly-Leu-Lys-Val-Gly-Val-Ser686, was detected (data not shown). The nonphosphorylated counterparts of peptides A and B were not detected, indicating that Ser657and Ser687 were fully phosphorylated, largely accounting for the observed stoichiometry of 2 mol of phosphate/mol of protein (Fig. 1). The precursor ion scan of the endoproteinase Glu-C digest of unphosphorylated caldesmon shows no trace of peak a(m/z 648.0) or peak b(m/z 754.0), indicating that Ser657and Ser687 are genuine PAK-target sites (Fig.2 B). Background peaks at m/z 529, 543, and 558, which amount to less than 12% of peak b, were detected in the unphosphorylated caldesmon sample but were not analyzed further. According to the model of Marston and Redwood (Ref. 26.Marston S.B. Redwood C.S. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, and Fig.2 C), Ser657 and Ser687 are located at the amino-terminal ends of calmodulin-binding sites A and B (15.Graether S.P. Heinonen T.Y.K. Raharjo W.H. Jin J.-P. Mak A.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 364-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 16.Marston S.B. Fraser I.D.C. Huber P.A.J. Pritchard K. Gusev N.B. Torok K J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8134-8139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in subdomain 4. We therefore examined whether Ser657 and Ser687 were accessible to PAK when caldesmon formed a complex with Ca2+/calmodulin. GST-PAK3-phosphorylated caldesmon-calmodulin complex at a similar initial rate but reach a stoichiometry of 1.2 mol of phosphate/mol of protein (Fig. 1). Calmodulin was not phosphorylated by PAK, and Ca2+ did not affect PAK activity under the same conditions (data not shown). This result suggests that binding of calmodulin to sites A and B of caldesmon renders Ser657 and/or Ser687 less accessible to PAK. To determine whether introduction of phosphate groups to Ser657 and Ser687 at the calmodulin-binding sites A and B can affect calmodulin-binding, we compared binding of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated caldesmon to calmodulin using intrinsic Trp fluorescence measurements (Fig.3). Phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated caldesmon have similar fluorescence spectra, each exhibiting a similar emission maximum at 350 nm, which suggests that the phosphate groups do not cause significant changes in the environments surrounding the Trp residues which are major determinants for calmodulin-binding (15.Graether S.P. Heinonen T.Y.K. Raharjo W.H. Jin J.-P. Mak A.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 364-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Binding of Ca2+-calmodulin, which contains no Trp, increased the intrinsic Trp fluorescence of caldesmon by a maximum of about 70% (Fig. 3 B) and caused a blue shift of the emission maximum from 350 to 340 nm (Fig. 3 A). On the other hand, calmodulin increases the fluorescence intensity by less than 40% at saturation accompanied by a smaller shift in emission maximum from 350 to 345 nm (Fig. 3 B). As shown in Fig. 3 B, phosphorylation reduces the affinity of caldesmon for Ca2+-calmodulin by about 10-fold and increases theK d from 0.1 to 0.9 μm. We compared the ability of caldesmon and its phosphorylated counterpart to interact with actin-tropomyosin and to inhibit actin-activated myosin ATPase activity because the calmodulin-binding site A has been shown to bind actin (27.Katsuyama H. Wang C.-L, A. Morgan K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14555-14558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and site B is in the middle of the tropomyosin-linked actin-binding and inhibitory region in subdomain 4 (28.Marston S.B. Huber P.A.J. Barany M. Biochemistry of Smooth Muscle Contraction. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996: 77-90Crossref Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, caldesmon phosphorylated to 2 mol of phosphate/mol of protein has a modest reduction in affinity for actin-tropomyosin; K d was increased by less than 2-fold from 1.0 to 1.7 μm. However, phosphorylation of caldesmon induces a significant release of inhibition of actin-S1 ATPase (Fig. 5) in the presence or absence of tropomyosin. At 0.2 mol/mol of caldesmon/actin, nonphosphorylated caldesmon inhibits actin-activated skeletal myosin S1 ATPase activity by 80% in the presence of tropomyosin, whereas about 40% inhibition was observed by the same amount of phosphorylated caldesmon (Fig. 5 B). Similar results were obtained using smooth muscle S1 (data not shown). In the absence of tropomyosin (Fig. 5 A), caldesmon is much less effective in inhibition as reported by others (28.Marston S.B. Huber P.A.J. Barany M. Biochemistry of Smooth Muscle Contraction. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996: 77-90Crossref Google Scholar, 29.Velaz L. Ingraham R.H. Chalovich J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2929-2934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); 0.4–0.5 mol/mol of nonphosphorylated caldesmon/actin is required to cause a 40% inhibition whereas similar amounts of phosphorylated caldesmon inhibit by 20%.Figure 5Inhibition of actin-activated skeletal S1-ATPase activity by caldesmon and phosphorylated caldesmon.

The strategic location of Ser657 and Ser687 in the calmodulin-binding sites A and B provides a crucial clue to our understanding of how phosphorylation of these sites may affect the function of caldesmon. The sequences around Ser657 and Ser687 are conserved in chicken, mouse, and human caldesmon, and these regions also form parts of the extended actin-binding regions in subdomain 4 (28.Marston S.B. Huber P.A.J. Barany M. Biochemistry of Smooth Muscle Contraction. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996: 77-90Crossref Google Scholar), further underscoring their importance. Ser657 and Ser687 are not recognized by MAPK (25.Childs T.J. Watson M. Sanghera J. Campbell D. Pelech S. Mak A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22853-22859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Adam L.P. Hathaway D.R.

Cell Motil. 1994; 15: 440-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), Ca2+-dependent calmodulin kinase II (32.Ikebe M. Reardon S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17607-17612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and protein kinase C (33.Tanaka T. Ohta H. Kanda K. Hidaka H. Sobue K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 188: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), all of which have been shown to phosphorylate caldesmon in vitro. The sequences surrounding Ser657 (Arg-Asn-Ile-Lys-Ser657-Met-Trp-Glu) and Ser687 (Lys-Val-Gly-Val-Ser-Ser687-Arg-Ile-Asn) in caldesmon, and Ser19(Gln-Arg-Ala-Thr-Ser19-Asn-Val-Phe) in MLC have a hydrophobic residue in the +2 position which agrees with Brzeskaet al. (39.Brzeska H. Knaus U.G. Wang Z.-Y. Bokoch G.M. Korn E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1092-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) who showed that a Tyr at the +2 position is strongly preferred by PAK1. As well, seven of the eight autophosphorylation sites in PAK1 have a hydrophobic residue in position +2 (40.Gatti A. Huang Z. Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8022-8028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, Tuazon et al. (34.Tuazon P.T. Spanos W.C. Gump E.L. Monnig C.A. Traugh J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 37: 17024-17029Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar), using a series of synthetic peptide substrates, identified the signature determinants for PAK1 phosphorylation as KRES, which bears little resemblance to the caldesmon and MLC phosphorylation sites except for the presence of a basic residue between positions −1 and −5. It appears, therefore, secondary structures and a hydrophobic amino acid at the +2 position are equally important determinants for PAK recognition. Not unexpected, we found that phosphorylation of Ser657 and Ser687 interfered with interaction between calmodulin and caldesmon. We have shown previously that although Trp659and Trp692 in sites A and B, respectively, are major determinants for caldesmon-calmodulin interaction, though amino acid residues surrounding the Trp residues also contribute to optimal binding (15.Graether S.P. Heinonen T.Y.K. Raharjo W.H. Jin J.-P. Mak A.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 364-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). NMR data showed that sites A and B in synthetic peptides simultaneously bind to the two hydrophobic regions of calmodulin affecting all eight Met residues in the “Met puddles” (35.O'Neill K.T. DeGrado W.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 59-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar) and become α-helical upon binding to calmodulin (36.Zhang M. Vogel H.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1163-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 37.Zhou N. Yuan T. Mak A.S. Vogel H.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2817-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the helix formed by site A is amphiphilic such that Ser657is located on the polar surface (36.Zhang M. Vogel H.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1163-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Introduction of phosphate groups at these sites likely interferes with the contacts between the polar surface of site A and calmodulin but should have a minor impact on hydrophobic interactions, as would be suggested by fluorescence data (Fig. 3 A), which indicate that phosphorylation of caldesmon alone does not affect the environment surrounding Trp residues in sites A and B. This is also consistent with our finding that binding of calmodulin to sites A and B attenuates subsequent phosphorylation of caldesmon by PAK, indicating that Ser657 and/or Ser687 become less accessible to PAK (Fig. 1). The actin-binding sites span an extended region in subdomain 4 of caldesmon (28.Marston S.B. Huber P.A.J. Barany M. Biochemistry of Smooth Muscle Contraction. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996: 77-90Crossref Google Scholar). Introduction of two phosphates at Ser657and Ser687 is unlikely to induce extensive disruption in the actin-binding regions, thus abrogating interaction. This may account for the modest reduction in affinity of phosphorylated caldesmon for actin-tropomyosin (Fig. 4), which might perhaps be because of a reorientation of the caldesmon molecule along the actin-tropomyosin filament toward forming a noninhibitory state. This interpretation is consistent with our finding that phosphorylation significantly reduces the ability of caldesmon to inhibit myosin S1-ATPase. A synthetic peptide spanning from Gly651 to Ser667 containing site A has been shown to bind actin and enhance contraction in saponin-treated single hyper-permeable ferret aorta smooth muscle cells (27.Katsuyama H. Wang C.-L, A. Morgan K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14555-14558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ser687 and site B are situated in the midst of a tropomyosin-dependent actin-binding region, residues 669–710, which is believed to be involved in tropomyosin-linked caldesmon inhibition of actomyosin ATPase activity (28.Marston S.B. Huber P.A.J. Barany M. Biochemistry of Smooth Muscle Contraction. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996: 77-90Crossref Google Scholar). It is conceivable that phosphorylation of Ser687 and Ser657 is responsible for altering the tropomyosin-dependent and tropomyosin-independent inhibition, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5 B, PAK-phosphorylation attenuates (∼50%), but does not abolish, caldesmon inhibition of actin-TM-activated myosin S1 ATPase activity invoking a phosphorylation mechanism by which caldesmon function can be modulated independently of Ca2+/calmodulin. It appears that caldesmon can exist in a number of states endowed with different inhibitory activities depending on its phosphorylation status and binding to Ca2+/calmodulin. One of these states, which is generated by Ca2+-independent phosphorylation of Ser657 and Ser687 with PAK, possesses intermediate inhibitory activity compared with the fully inhibitory nonphosphorylated caldesmon and the noninhibitory Ca2+/calmodulin-caldesmon complex. It is possible that introduction of phosphate groups to the calmodulin-binding region may engender a simulacrum of the Ca2+-calmodulin-bound state of caldesmon, thus accounting for the partial reversion of inhibition. Formation of a complex between phosphorylated caldesmon and calmodulin, however, appears unfavorable in view of results showing that the affinity of phosphorylated caldesmon for Ca2+/calmodulin is reduced 10-fold and that Ser657 and/or Ser687 in the caldesmon-calmodulin complex are less accessible to PAK (Fig. 3). Taken together, data from this study and others suggest that Rac1cdc42 and Rho GTPase may act in concert to target thin- and thick-filament, respectively, modulating Ca2+ sensitivity of smooth muscle contraction.

https://openalex.org/W2064288376,"Bisdioxopiperazines are a unique class of topoisomerase II inhibitors that lock topoisomerase II at a point in the enzyme reaction cycle where the enzyme forms a closed clamp around DNA. We examined cell killing by ICRF-187 and ICRF-193 in yeast cells expressing human topoisomerase II α (htop-IIα). Expression of htop-IIα in yeast cells sensitizes them to both ICRF-187 and ICRF-193, compared with cells expressing yeast topoisomerase II. ICRF-193 is still able to exert growth inhibition in the presence of genes encoding both ICRF-193-resistant and ICRF-193-sensitive htop-IIα enzymes, indicating that sensitivity to bisdioxopiperazines is dominant. Killing by ICRF-193 occurs more rapidly, than the killing in yeast cells due to a temperature-sensitive yeast topoisomerase II incubated at the non-permissive temperature. These results are reminiscent of a top-II poison such as etoposide. However, the killing caused by ICRF-193 and ICRF-187 is not enhanced by mutations in theRAD52 pathway. The levels of drug-induced DNA cleavage observed with htop-IIα in vitro is insufficient to explain the sensitivity induced by this enzyme in yeast cells. Finally, arrest of cells in G1 does not protect cells from ICRF-193 lethality, a result inconsistent with killing mechanisms due to catalytic inhibition of top-II or stabilization of a cleavable complex. We suggest that the observed pattern of cell killing is most consistent with a poisoning of htop-II by ICRF-193 by a novel mechanism. The accumulation of closed clamp conformations of htop-II induced by ICRF-193 that are trapped on DNA might interfere with transcription, or other DNA metabolic processes, resulting in cell death.

The levels of drug-induced DNA cleavage observed with htop-IIα in vitro is insufficient to explain the sensitivity induced by this enzyme in yeast cells. Finally, arrest of cells in G1 does not protect cells from ICRF-193 lethality, a result inconsistent with killing mechanisms due to catalytic inhibition of top-II or stabilization of a cleavable complex. We suggest that the observed pattern of cell killing is most consistent with a poisoning of htop-II by ICRF-193 by a novel mechanism. The accumulation of closed clamp conformations of htop-II induced by ICRF-193 that are trapped on DNA might interfere with transcription, or other DNA metabolic processes, resulting in cell death. meso-2,3-bis(3,5-dioxopiperazine-1-yl)butane (s)-(+)-1,2-bis(3,5-dioxopiperazenyl)propane topoisomerase II α human topoisomerase II α yeast topoisomerase II polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate There are two well characterized modes of action of drugs acting against eukaryotic topoisomerase II. Anti-cancer topoisomerase II poisons such as etoposide, amsacrine, and doxorubicin stabilize an intermediate in the topoisomerase II reaction in which the two topoisomerase II subunits are covalently bound to DNA via a phosphotyrosine linkage. This covalent intermediate, termed the covalent complex plays a critical role in cell killing by anti-topoisomerase II agents (reviewed in Refs. 1.Nitiss J.L. Beck W.T. Eur. J. Cancer. 1996; 32A: 958-966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 2.Froelich-Ammon S.J. Osheroff N. J. Biol.

Toxicol. 1994; 34: 191-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). The second class of agents do not stabilize the covalent intermediate of the topoisomerase II reaction, but inhibit the enzyme at other points of the reaction cycle (1.Nitiss J.L. Beck W.T. Eur. J. Cancer. 1996; 32A: 958-966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 4.Andoh T. Ishida R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 155-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Since blocking the enzyme at other points of the reaction cycle does not result in DNA damage, this second class of agents is thought to kill cells by depriving them of the essential enzyme activity of topoisomerase II. This second class of inhibitors has been termed catalytic inhibitors to distinguish them from agents that act by stabilizing covalent complexes.A major class of catalytic inhibitors of prokaryotic topoisomerase II inhibits topoisomerase activity by preventing ATP binding (5.Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 665-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). These inhibitors include novobiocin and the coumermycins. Most of these inhibitors have relatively low potency against eukaryotic topoisomerases (5.Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 665-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). Other, more potent catalytic inhibitors of eukaryotic topoisomerases have been described, these include anthracyclines such as aclarubicin that intercalate in DNA and prevent the binding of the enzyme to DNA (6.Nitiss J.L. Pourquier P. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4564-4569PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Jensen P.B. Jensen P.S. Demant E.J. Friche E. Sorensen B.S. Sehested M. Wassermann K. Vindelov L. Westergaard O.

Cell. 1992; 71: 833-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that during the course of the topoisomerase II reaction, the enzyme forms a closed clamp around DNA. ATP binding is required to generate a closed clamp with wild type topoisomerase II, and ATP hydrolysis generates a conformational change that leads to reopening of the clamp (11.Roca J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1992; 71: 833-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 12.Roca J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 156-160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Subsequently, Rocaet al. (13.Roca J. Ishida R. Berger J.M. Andoh T. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) showed that bisdioxopiperazines inhibit the re-opening of the closed clamp, and also blocks ATP hydrolysis. Therefore, bisdioxopiperazines would sequester topoisomerase II in the closed clamp conformation, and inhibit enzyme activity inside the cell.Support for this mode of action of bisdioxopiperazines in vivo has been obtained from both yeast and mammalian cells. Overexpression of topoisomerase II in yeast leads to resistance to ICRF-193,1 while reducing the activity of the enzyme leads to increased cell killing, suggesting that cell death arises from a lack of topoisomerase II activity. Studies by Andoh and colleagues have shown that ICRF-187 or ICRF-193 exposure results in a failure to complete a normal mitosis, and can generate polyploid cells (4.Andoh T. Ishida R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 155-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In vitro, bisdioxopiperazines prevent decatenation of replicated chromosomes by topoisomerase II (4.Andoh T. Ishida R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 155-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 14.Ishimi Y. Ishida R. Andoh T. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 835-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that a principal mode of cell killing by bisdioxopiperazines is by preventing topoisomerase II from decatenating replicated chromosomes at mitosis; a function that absolutely requires topoisomerase II (15.Holm C. Stearns T. Botstein D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 16.Holm C. Goto T. Wang J.C. Botstein D.

Acta. 1998; 1400: 63-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar).Expression of human topoisomerase II in yeast cells that lack topoisomerase II activity has been shown to complement the essential functions of the yeast enzyme (18.Hsiung Y. Jannatipour M. Rose A. McMahon J. Duncan D. Nitiss J.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 91-99PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Wasserman R.A. Austin C.A. Fisher L.M. Wang J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3591-3596PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we have investigated the action of bisdioxopiperazines against human topoisomerase II α (top-IIα). We have found that the human enzyme is substantially more sensitive to bisdioxopiperazines than the yeast type II topoisomerase. Unexpectedly, we have found that expression of top-IIα confers dominant sensitivity to bisdioxopiperazines, a result that is not in obvious agreement with these drugs acting as catalytic inhibitors of the enzyme. Nonetheless, we were unable to detect levels of covalent complexes that would be consistent with these drugs acting as topoisomerase poisons. We suggest that the closed clamp conformation of topoisomerase II is a novel type of topoisomerase poison, and that the closed clamp form of the enzyme trapped on DNA is sufficient to interfere with DNA metabolism and cause cell killing.DISCUSSIONPrevious studies have indicated that bisdioxopiperazines are specific inhibitors of topoisomerase II (4.Andoh T. Ishida R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 155-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 41.Ishida R. Hamatake M. Wasserman R.A. Nitiss J.L. Wang J.C. Andoh T. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2299-2303PubMed Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggested that these compounds are catalytic inhibitors of topoisomerase II rather than agents that stabilize topoisomerase II covalent complexes, including a lack of dependence on theRAD52 pathway for cell killing in yeast (41.Ishida R. Hamatake M. Wasserman R.A. Nitiss J.L. Wang J.C. Andoh T. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2299-2303PubMed Google Scholar), and phenotypes in mammalian cells that are consistent with a failure to decatenate replicated chromosomes (4.Andoh T. Ishida R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 155-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In addition, it has also been shown that bisdioxopiperazines can suppress the formation of covalent complexes by topoisomerase II poisons such as etoposide (49.Sehested M. Jensen P.B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 879-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This work demonstrates that there is an additional aspect to cell killing by bisdioxopiperazines, i.e. the potential to act as a novel type of topoisomerase II poison.Wang and colleagues (13.Roca J. Ishida R. Berger J.M. Andoh T. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) have shown that bisdioxopiperazines trap topoisomerase II at a unique intermediate form, where the enzyme has formed a closed clamp. The topological state of the enzyme is the same as when the enzyme turnover is inhibited by non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs (11.Roca J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1992; 71: 833-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 50.Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9944-9950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 51.Roca J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 609-616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Under both of these conditions, the enzyme and covalently closed circular DNA forms a catenane, with one loop comprising DNA and one loop comprising protein. We suggest that topoisomerase II in this state acts as a DNA lesion, which could inhibit DNA metabolic processes such as replication, transcription, or chromatin assembly or disassembly.The hypothesis that the closed clamp form of topoisomerase II can act as a type of DNA “lesion” is based on the demonstration in this work that bisdioxopiperazines are able to kill yeast cells even in the presence of a bisdioxopiperazine-resistant topoisomerase II. A drug that kills cells because of a lack of topoisomerase II should confer recessive drug sensitivity, i.e. a drug-resistant form of topoisomerase II should confer drug resistance regardless of whether a drug-sensitive topoisomerase is present. This is in contrast to topoisomerase poisons, agents that kill cells by stabilizing covalent complexes. Previous experiments have demonstrated that complex stabilizing drugs confer dominant drug sensitivity, i.e. a drug-sensitive topoisomerase II confers drug sensitivity regardless of whether a drug-resistant form of the enzyme is present (20.Jannatipour M. Liu Y.X. Nitiss J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18586-18592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43.Liu Y.X. Hsiung Y. Jannatipour M. Yeh Y. Nitiss J.L. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2943-2951PubMed Google Scholar).Interpretation of dominant drug sensitivity is complicated by the fact that topoisomerase II is a stable dimer (52.Tennyson R.B. Lindsley J.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6107-6114Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Co-expression of a drug-sensitive and a drug-resistant enzyme can result in heterodimers of one sensitive and one resistant subunit. Under these circumstances, the drug sensitivity could depend on the drug sensitivity of the heterodimer. However, we have shown that potential heterodimers are not relevant to the dominant drug sensitivity conferred by bisdioxopiperazines. In experiments where active human and yeast enzymes are expressed, we were unable to detect heterodimers with both yeast and human monomers. In experiments where different alleles of human top-IIα are expressed, we showed that the drug sensitivity of the heterodimer is irrelevant if bisdioxopiperazines act only by depriving cells of topoisomerase II activity. We showed that co-expression of a bisdioxopiperazine-resistant human top-IIa along with an active site tyrosine mutant still results in yeast cells that are very resistant to ICRF-193. If these two subunits can freely heterodimerize, then there will be a 50% reduction in active topoisomerase II. Expression of both the active site tyrosine mutant and the Tyr50 → Phe mutant resulted in cells that were completely resistant to ICRF-193. However, expression of wild type human top-IIα along with the Tyr50 → Phe mutant reduces cell growth below that observed with the active site mutant. The level of Tyr50 → Phe homodimers will be the same in both experiments. Nonetheless, only expression of wild type drug-sensitive topoisomerase II reduced cell growth. Therefore, the wild type:wild type homodimers and/or the wild type:Tyr50 → Phe heterodimers confer drug sensitivity, i.e. dominant drug sensitivity.The level of drug sensitivity conferred by wild type human topoisomerase II when the drug-resistant topoisomerase is a human enzyme is considerably less than what was observed when the drug-resistant enzyme is yeast topoisomerase II. We suggest that this is due to the level of drug-sensitive enzyme present in the two circumstances. Because the two forms of the human enzyme can heterodimerize, while the yeast and human forms cannot, expression of drug-resistant human top-II can reduce the level of drug-sensitive enzyme by 50%, provided that the heterodimers are fully drug-resistant. In agreement with this hypothesis, van Hille and Hill (53.van Hille B. Hill B.T. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 345-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) have shown that expression of high levels of wild type human top-IIα in yeast result in higher levels of bisdioxopiperazine sensitivity than lower levels of the human enzyme.If bisdioxopiperazines act as topoisomerase poisons, then one could hypothesize that these drugs are complex stabilizing topoisomerase II poisons. We detected a small increase in covalent complex formation with purified human topoisomerase II and ICRF-193. However, the potency of covalent complex formation is inconsistent with the cytotoxicity observed. It is probably not surprising that a small increase in covalent complexes was observed. Trapping the closed clamp form of topoisomerase II on DNA could result in an equilibrium between cleaved and uncleaved complexes. Since the local concentration of topoisomerase II bound to DNA is increased by trapping the closed clamp form of the enzyme on DNA, it would be expected that some increase in covalent complex was observed.In addition to the biochemical tests, the other experiments described above are also inconsistent with ICRF-193 acting as a complex stabilizing topoisomerase II poison. First,rad52 − cells do not show the extreme hypersensitivity to ICRF-193 seen with complex stabilizing drugs such as etoposide or amsacrine (35.Nitiss J. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7501-7505Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 36.Nitiss J.L. Wang J.C. Potmesil M. Kohn K. DNA Topoisomerases and Cancer. Oxford University Press, London1991: 77-91Google Scholar). The experiments using agents that block cell cycle progression also demonstrated a phenotype distinct from what has been previously observed with complex stabilizing topoisomerase II poisons.An alternate explanation that would be consistent with bisdioxopiperazines acting as topoisomerase II poisons is that the formation of stable covalent complexes by human Top2p (in yeast) is more cytotoxic than stabilized covalent complexes formed with yeast Top2p. One way this could happen is if Top2:DNA complexes are relatively efficient substrates for repair processes, while the human enzyme is not efficiently recognized. We do not favor this possibility, because we have previously shown that yeast cells expressing human Top2p are not more sensitive to complex-stabilizing drugs such as etoposide than cells expressing yeast Top2 (25.Hsiung Y. Jannatipour M. McMahon J. Duncan D. Nitiss J.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 91-99PubMed Google Scholar).How might bisdioxopiperazines kill cells? Although these drugs do not lead to high levels of covalent complexes between topoisomerase II and DNA, the closed clamp form of the enzyme might impede DNA metabolic events. If topoisomerase II cannot freely slide along DNA when trapped as a closed clamp, then it might block transcriptional elongation, DNA replication, repair, and other DNA metabolic events. Although we do not think that bisdioxopiperazines act as complex stabilizing topoisomerase II poisons, our results indicate that the enzyme must be able to cleave DNA in order to act as a poison. A possible interpretation is that the ability of Top2p to cleave DNA impedes the ability of the closed clamp form of the enzyme to slide along DNA. Perhaps an enzyme that cannot cleave DNA freely slides along DNA as a washer on a string, and does not impede other DNA metabolic events.The ability of ICRF-193 and other bisdioxopiperazines to kill cells by converting topoisomerase II into a “non-covalent poison” probably depends on the level of topoisomerase II that is expressed. van Hille and Hill (53.van Hille B. Hill B.T. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 345-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) showed that the level of expression of hTOP2in yeast is proportional to the degree of cell killing induced by bisdioxopiperazines. Whether mammalian cells are strongly affected may depend on the their level of expression of different topoisomerase II isoforms. In this regard, it will be important to quantitate the sensitivity of topoisomerase II β to bisdioxopiperazines, since this isoform is expressed in both proliferating cells and quiescent cells (54.Jenkins J.R. Ayton P. Jones T. Davies S.L. Simmons D.L. Harris A.L. Sheer D. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5587-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar).Finally, the results presented here suggest that caution is needed in the use of bisdioxopiperazines as probes of topoisomerase function in eukaryotic cells. It is well established that topoisomerase II poisons such as etoposide can exert effects on cells due to the generation of covalent complexes. The effect of etoposide on specific cell processes may not be due to a requirement for topoisomerase II in that process. Results presented here suggest that a trapped non-covalent complex of topoisomerase II on DNA may also produce effects on cells that are not specifically due to a normal involvement of topoisomerase II. Nonetheless, because bisdioxopiperazines are in clinical use as cardioprotectants, it will be important to understand the effects of this novel type of poisoning of topoisomerase II. There are two well characterized modes of action of drugs acting against eukaryotic topoisomerase II. Anti-cancer topoisomerase II poisons such as etoposide, amsacrine, and doxorubicin stabilize an intermediate in the topoisomerase II reaction in which the two topoisomerase II subunits are covalently bound to DNA via a phosphotyrosine linkage. This covalent intermediate, termed the covalent complex plays a critical role in cell killing by anti-topoisomerase II agents (reviewed in Refs. 1.Nitiss J.L. Beck W.T. Eur. J.

Toxicol. 1994; 34: 191-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). The second class of agents do not stabilize the covalent intermediate of the topoisomerase II reaction, but inhibit the enzyme at other points of the reaction cycle (1.Nitiss J.L. Beck W.T. Eur. J. Cancer. 1996; 32A: 958-966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 4.Andoh T. Ishida R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 155-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar).

A. 1994; 91: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) have shown that bisdioxopiperazines trap topoisomerase II at a unique intermediate form, where the enzyme has formed a closed clamp. The topological state of the enzyme is the same as when the enzyme turnover is inhibited by non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs (11.Roca J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1992; 71: 833-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 50.Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9944-9950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 51.Roca J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 609-616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Under both of these conditions, the enzyme and covalently closed circular DNA forms a catenane, with one loop comprising DNA and one loop comprising protein. We suggest that topoisomerase II in this state acts as a DNA lesion, which could inhibit DNA metabolic processes such as replication, transcription, or chromatin assembly or disassembly.The hypothesis that the closed clamp form of topoisomerase II can act as a type of DNA “lesion” is based on the demonstration in this work that bisdioxopiperazines are able to kill yeast cells even in the presence of a bisdioxopiperazine-resistant topoisomerase II. A drug that kills cells because of a lack of topoisomerase II should confer recessive drug sensitivity, i.e. a drug-resistant form of topoisomerase II should confer drug resistance regardless of whether a drug-sensitive topoisomerase is present. This is in contrast to topoisomerase poisons, agents that kill cells by stabilizing covalent complexes. Previous experiments have demonstrated that complex stabilizing drugs confer dominant drug sensitivity, i.e. a drug-sensitive topoisomerase II confers drug sensitivity regardless of whether a drug-resistant form of the enzyme is present (20.Jannatipour M. Liu Y.X. Nitiss J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18586-18592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43.Liu Y.X. Hsiung Y. Jannatipour M. Yeh Y. Nitiss J.L. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2943-2951PubMed Google Scholar).Interpretation of dominant drug sensitivity is complicated by the fact that topoisomerase II is a stable dimer (52.Tennyson R.B. Lindsley J.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6107-6114Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Co-expression of a drug-sensitive and a drug-resistant enzyme can result in heterodimers of one sensitive and one resistant subunit. Under these circumstances, the drug sensitivity could depend on the drug sensitivity of the heterodimer. However, we have shown that potential heterodimers are not relevant to the dominant drug sensitivity conferred by bisdioxopiperazines. In experiments where active human and yeast enzymes are expressed, we were unable to detect heterodimers with both yeast and human monomers. In experiments where different alleles of human top-IIα are expressed, we showed that the drug sensitivity of the heterodimer is irrelevant if bisdioxopiperazines act only by depriving cells of topoisomerase II activity. We showed that co-expression of a bisdioxopiperazine-resistant human top-IIa along with an active site tyrosine mutant still results in yeast cells that are very resistant to ICRF-193. If these two subunits can freely heterodimerize, then there will be a 50% reduction in active topoisomerase II. Expression of both the active site tyrosine mutant and the Tyr50 → Phe mutant resulted in cells that were completely resistant to ICRF-193. However, expression of wild type human top-IIα along with the Tyr50 → Phe mutant reduces cell growth below that observed with the active site mutant. The level of Tyr50 → Phe homodimers will be the same in both experiments. Nonetheless, only expression of wild type drug-sensitive topoisomerase II reduced cell growth. Therefore, the wild type:wild type homodimers and/or the wild type:Tyr50 → Phe heterodimers confer drug sensitivity, i.e. dominant drug sensitivity.The level of drug sensitivity conferred by wild type human topoisomerase II when the drug-resistant topoisomerase is a human enzyme is considerably less than what was observed when the drug-resistant enzyme is yeast topoisomerase II. We suggest that this is due to the level of drug-sensitive enzyme present in the two circumstances. Because the two forms of the human enzyme can heterodimerize, while the yeast and human forms cannot, expression of drug-resistant human top-II can reduce the level of drug-sensitive enzyme by 50%, provided that the heterodimers are fully drug-resistant. In agreement with this hypothesis, van Hille and Hill (53.van Hille B. Hill B.T. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 345-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) have shown that expression of high levels of wild type human top-IIα in yeast result in higher levels of bisdioxopiperazine sensitivity than lower levels of the human enzyme.If bisdioxopiperazines act as topoisomerase poisons, then one could hypothesize that these drugs are complex stabilizing topoisomerase II poisons. We detected a small increase in covalent complex formation with purified human topoisomerase II and ICRF-193. However, the potency of covalent complex formation is inconsistent with the cytotoxicity observed. It is probably not surprising that a small increase in covalent complexes was observed. Trapping the closed clamp form of topoisomerase II on DNA could result in an equilibrium between cleaved and uncleaved complexes. Since the local concentration of topoisomerase II bound to DNA is increased by trapping the closed clamp form of the enzyme on DNA, it would be expected that some increase in covalent complex was observed.In addition to the biochemical tests, the other experiments described above are also inconsistent with ICRF-193 acting as a complex stabilizing topoisomerase II poison. First,rad52 − cells do not show the extreme hypersensitivity to ICRF-193 seen with complex stabilizing drugs such as etoposide or amsacrine (35.Nitiss J. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7501-7505Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 36.Nitiss J.L. Wang J.C. Potmesil M. Kohn K. DNA Topoisomerases and Cancer. Oxford University Press, London1991: 77-91Google Scholar). The experiments using agents that block cell cycle progression also demonstrated a phenotype distinct from what has been previously observed with complex stabilizing topoisomerase II poisons.An alternate explanation that would be consistent with bisdioxopiperazines acting as topoisomerase II poisons is that the formation of stable covalent complexes by human Top2p (in yeast) is more cytotoxic than stabilized covalent complexes formed with yeast Top2p. One way this could happen is if Top2:DNA complexes are relatively efficient substrates for repair processes, while the human enzyme is not efficiently recognized. We do not favor this possibility, because we have previously shown that yeast cells expressing human Top2p are not more sensitive to complex-stabilizing drugs such as etoposide than cells expressing yeast Top2 (25.Hsiung Y. Jannatipour M. McMahon J. Duncan D. Nitiss J.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 91-99PubMed Google Scholar).How might bisdioxopiperazines kill cells? Although these drugs do not lead to high levels of covalent complexes between topoisomerase II and DNA, the closed clamp form of the enzyme might impede DNA metabolic events. If topoisomerase II cannot freely slide along DNA when trapped as a closed clamp, then it might block transcriptional elongation, DNA replication, repair, and other DNA metabolic events. Although we do not think that bisdioxopiperazines act as complex stabilizing topoisomerase II poisons, our results indicate that the enzyme must be able to cleave DNA in order to act as a poison. A possible interpretation is that the ability of Top2p to cleave DNA impedes the ability of the closed clamp form of the enzyme to slide along DNA. Perhaps an enzyme that cannot cleave DNA freely slides along DNA as a washer on a string, and does not impede other DNA metabolic events.The ability of ICRF-193 and other bisdioxopiperazines to kill cells by converting topoisomerase II into a “non-covalent poison” probably depends on the level of topoisomerase II that is expressed. van Hille and Hill (53.van Hille B. Hill B.T. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 345-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) showed that the level of expression of hTOP2in yeast is proportional to the degree of cell killing induced by bisdioxopiperazines. Whether mammalian cells are strongly affected may depend on the their level of expression of different topoisomerase II isoforms. In this regard, it will be important to quantitate the sensitivity of topoisomerase II β to bisdioxopiperazines, since this isoform is expressed in both proliferating cells and quiescent cells (54.Jenkins J.R. Ayton P. Jones T. Davies S.L. Simmons D.L. Harris A.L. Sheer D. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5587-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar).Finally, the results presented here suggest that caution is needed in the use of bisdioxopiperazines as probes of topoisomerase function in eukaryotic cells. It is well established that topoisomerase II poisons such as etoposide can exert effects on cells due to the generation of covalent complexes. The effect of etoposide on specific cell processes may not be due to a requirement for topoisomerase II in that process. Results presented here suggest that a trapped non-covalent complex of topoisomerase II on DNA may also produce effects on cells that are not specifically due to a normal involvement of topoisomerase II. Nonetheless, because bisdioxopiperazines are in clinical use as cardioprotectants, it will be important to understand the effects of this novel type of poisoning of topoisomerase II. Previous studies have indicated that bisdioxopiperazines are specific inhibitors of topoisomerase II (4.Andoh T. Ishida R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 155-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 41.Ishida R. Hamatake M. Wasserman R.A. Nitiss J.L. Wang J.C. Andoh T. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2299-2303PubMed Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggested that these compounds are catalytic inhibitors of topoisomerase II rather than agents that stabilize topoisomerase II covalent complexes, including a lack of dependence on theRAD52 pathway for cell killing in yeast (41.Ishida R. Hamatake M. Wasserman R.A. Nitiss J.L. Wang J.C. Andoh T. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2299-2303PubMed Google Scholar), and phenotypes in mammalian cells that are consistent with a failure to decatenate replicated chromosomes (4.Andoh T. Ishida R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 155-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In addition, it has also been shown that bisdioxopiperazines can suppress the formation of covalent complexes by topoisomerase II poisons such as etoposide (49.Sehested M. Jensen P.B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 879-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).

In each of the structures, the peptide is bound in an essentially identical extended conformation, similar to a polyproline II-helix or a twisted β strand, with the conformation apparently maintained by a large number of interactions between the peptide main chain and the MHC protein (10.Stern L.J.

Endogenous peptides isolated from class II MHC molecules expressed by antigen presenting cells generally have lengths ranging from 15 to 20 residues, with longer peptides found occasionally (13.Chicz R.M.

Class II MHC proteins generally recognize amino acid side chains embedded within a ∼9-residue stretch of a bound peptide. Within this binding frame, there are relatively strong side chain preferences at several positions and relatively weaker preferences at others. Sequences outside the binding frame have little or no effect on peptide binding specificity. This pattern of side chain preferences, called the peptide-binding motif, is consistent with the x-ray crystal structures, which reveal pockets in the peptide-binding site spaced to accommodate the peptide side chains that contribute to the motif. The pockets are labeled according to the side chain accommodated; for example, the P1 pocket binds the side chain of the residue in the +1 position. In the structures of HLA-DR alleles, pockets within the overall peptide-binding site are at P1, P4, P6, and P9, with smaller pockets or shelves in the binding site at P3 and P7 (see Fig. 1) (3.Brown J.H.

For other MHC proteins the pattern of side chain and length preferences is very similar, except that several HLA-DQ and murine I-A alleles have reduced or absent side chain preferences at the P1 position (4.Fremont D.G.

The relative contributions of peptide side chain and main chain interactions to the MHC class II binding affinity and complex stability have not been addressed in detail.Several recent studies have suggested that class II MHC proteins can adopt alternate conformations under certain experimental conditions or when peptide binding is absent or destabilized.

The first observations of conformational variation in class II MHC were the presence of an intermediate “floppy” species with reduced mobility on nondenaturing SDS-PAGE during thermal denaturation and folding (27.Dornmair, K., Rothenhausler, B., and McConnell, H. M. (1989) Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. LIV 409–416Google Scholar,28.Dornmair K. McConnell H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4134-4138Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This floppy species was the predominant species at low pH (29.Sadegh-Nasseri S. Germain R.N. Nature. 1991; 353: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Such conformational changes have been proposed to play important roles in the peptide binding process in vivo and in interactions with other proteins, such as the peptide exchange factor HLA-DM (20.Natarajan S.K.

For HLA-DR1 (DRA*0101 andDRB1*0101), a common human class II MHC protein, we have shown that peptide binding drives conversion between two defined states, a looser, more open conformation for the empty protein, and a compact conformation for the peptide-bound form (21.Zarutskie J.A. Sato A.K. Rushe M.M. Chan I.C. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Stern L.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5878-5887Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 26.Sadegh-Nasseri S. Stern L.J. Wiley D.C. Germain R.N. Nature. 1994; 370: 647-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The conversion involved a decrease of the hydrodynamic radius from ∼35 to ∼29 Å, an alteration in secondary structure, and an increase in the cooperativity of thermal denaturation. Together these results suggested a condensation or folding of the empty protein around the peptide. In this work, we investigate the minimal determinants of the peptide-MHC interaction needed to trigger the conversion to the compact form. We find that the peptide length and sequence requirements for inducing the conformational change are distinct from those for tight binding and in particular that occupancy of the P1 pocket is sufficient for transition to a compact form.DISCUSSIONIn this study we have investigated which components of the peptide-MHC interaction are important in inducing conversion to the compact form. Binding of several minimal peptides as well as a point substitution in the empty HLA-DR1 protein were shown to induce transition from an open to compact form, as measured by an 10–20% decrease in hydrodynamic radius. In each case the hydrodynamic change was accompanied by folding of a region on the β subunit corresponding to an antibody epitope and establishment of a substantial hydrophobic core exhibiting cooperative thermal denaturation. Characteristic changes in the far-UV CD spectra were observed in a subset of the compact forms. The compact conformation was stabilized by binding of peptides as short as the dipeptide YR, which binds weakly withK D > 100 μm and occupies less than half of the peptide-binding cleft. Filling only the P1 pocket was sufficient to partially stabilize the compact form, as shown by the mutation HLA-DR1Gβ86Y. Conformational changes induced by this substitution were propagated to remote parts of the peptide-binding cleft, as indicated by loss of the KL-295 epitope in the β58–69 region at the other end of the peptide-binding site, at least 20 angstroms from the P1 region.How does occupancy of the P1 pocket induce a conformational change in remote regions of the binding site? An attractive mechanism would involve organization of a number of aromatic side chains in the P1 pocket around the peptide P1 side chain (Fig. 6). Residues lining the pocket are from both α and β subunits, and rearrangements of these residues could be transmitted to the adjacent α and β subunit helical regions. These flanking regions are involved in important peptide main chain and side chain contacts with the MHC protein (7.Murthy V. Stern L.J. Structure. 1997; 5: 1385-1396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar,10.Stern L.J. Brown J.H. Jardetzky T.S. Gorga J.C. Urban R.G. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1994; 368: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar). The conformational change involves folding or rearrangement of a part of the β chain helical region that includes at least the KL-295 epitope β58–69 (Fig. 1), and other parts of the α and β chain helical regions also may be involved. It is possible that formation of a key cluster of interactions around the P1 pocket is sufficient to nucleate a conformational change that extends throughout the peptide-binding cleft.However, P1 occupancy was not required to induce conversion to the compact form. A variant of the Ha peptide, HaY308A, was able to stabilize the compact conformation despite substitution of the P1 residue by alanine. In accordance with the model described above, the peptide HaY308A could bypass the requirement for P1 occupancy by directly contacting the α and β chain helical regions and stabilizing them in the compact form. Interestingly, neither the wild-type DR1-HaY308A complex, which lacks P1 interactions, nor the empty DR1Gβ86Y protein, which lacks the other interactions, exhibited all of the features of the CD spectrum characteristic of the other peptide complexes. These proteins exhibit some of the features of a classic molten globule, i.e.compact tertiary structure but incomplete secondary structure.Binding of the peptide YR is able to induce the full spectrum of effects characteristic of peptide binding. This suggests that main chain interactions in the P(−1) to P2 region are required in addition to occupancy of the P1 pocket for the complete conformational change. Main chain interactions in this region include conserved hydrogen bonding interactions between the peptide main chain at P1 and P2 and Hisβ81 and Asnβ82 side chains of DR1 and between the peptide main chain at P(−1) and P1 and α51–55 main chain atoms of DR1. The residues Hisβ81 (51.Tan L.J. Ceman S. Chervonsky A. Rodriguez-Paris J. Steck T.L. Sant A.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1479-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and Asnβ82 (52.Griffith I.J. Nabavi N. Ghogawala Z. Chase C.G. Rodriguez M. McKean D.J. Glimcher L.H. J. Exp.

The region α51–55 forms a conserved antiparallel β structure with the peptide N-terminal region (4.Fremont D.G. Monnaie D. Nelson C.A. Hendrickson W.A. Unanue E.

Interactions between these residues and the main chain of the bound peptide may comprise the set of key nucleating interactions in the P1-P4 region.The peptide requirements for promoting conversion to the compact form of HLA-DR1 are distinct from those needed for high affinity binding. In the Ha peptide analogues, tight binding (<1 μm) requires main chain interactions in the P5–P9 region, in addition to favorable interactions in the P1–P2 pockets. In contrast, conversion to the compact form can be induced by weakly binding peptides that have P1-P2 contacts but lack P5–P9 contacts and do not contribute to the overall thermal stability of the complex. Thus Min4 and YR peptides can stabilize the final structure with its characteristic CD spectrum. HaY308A, which binds with essentially identical affinity, does not stabilize the final structure. This underscores the point that the complete set of interactions in the P1–P2 area are required for full conversion to the stable, peptide-loaded conformation, although interactions in other regions of the peptide-binding site can trigger conversion to a compact intermediate form. Thus, the interactions important for stabilizing the compact peptide-loaded conformation are different from those that stabilize the binding of the peptide, providing additional evidence that peptide binding involves rearrangement within the MHC protein and not simply creation of new MHC-peptide interactions.A naturally occurring polymorphism in I-E, the murine homologue of HLA-DR, appears to have some of the characteristics of the DR1Gβ86Y protein. The k allele (I-Ek) has Pheβ86 (Fig. 6), as do the less frequently studied alleles I-Ep, and I-Eq (53.Rammensee H.-G. MHC Ligands and Peptide Motifs. Chapman & Hall, Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX1997Crossref Google Scholar). The hydrodynamic behavior of I-Ek has not been reported, but its cooperative thermal denaturation profile and intermediate CD spectra (23.Reich Z. Altman J.D. Boniface J.J. Lyons D.S. Kozono H. Ogg G. Morgan C. Davis M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2495-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) are similar to those reported above for DR1Gβ86Y. At pH 7, I-Ek has a lower affinity than DR1 for antigenic peptides and invariant chain, binding invariant chain with K D∼0.3 μm and antigenic peptides withK D values of ∼0.1–10 μm (54.Sette A.

McConnell H.M. Nature. 1989; 337: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), as compared with nanomolar affinities for DR1 (31.Kropshofer H. Vogt A.B. Moldenhauer G. Hammer J. Blum J.S.

Miller J. Appella E. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). DR1Gβ86Y binds HaY308A, a peptide expected to be optimal for this variant, with a K D value of ∼9 μm, much weaker than for typical DR1-peptide interactions but similar to those for I-Ek.The observation that nonoverlapping sets of interactions are able to promote conversion to the compact form, as shown by the results with the HaY308A peptide and the HLA-DR1Gβ86Ymutation, underscores the large scale or global nature of the conformational change. This has important implications for the mechanisms of intracellular antigen loading and transport of class II MHC proteins. MHC molecules need to form long-lived complexes with antigenic peptide to function as effective antigen-presenting elements. Release of peptide at the cell surface from short-lived complexes could allow adventitious binding of extracellular antigens, bypassing the intracellular loading pathways and possibly triggering an inappropriate immune response Moreover, several types of antigen presenting cells are known to collect antigen in peripheral tissues and transport them to lymph nodes for presentation to T-cells (59.Banchereaur J. Steinman R.M. Nature. 1998; 392: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (12151) Google Scholar). Such cellular transport also requires long-lived MHC-peptide complexes. Experimentally, the lifetimes of MHC complexes with endogenous and antigenic peptides are quite long, on the order of hours to days (60.Lanzavecchia A. Reid P.A. Watts C. Nature. 1992; 357: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Kinetic studies suggest that the conformational change investigated here functions as a kinetic trap that stabilizes the bound peptide and prevents inappropriate peptide release. 2R. Joshi, J. A. Zarutskie, and L. J. Stern, submitted for publication. Efficient peptide loading of class II MHC molecules in vivo requires the assistance of HLA-DM, a MHC homologue (62.Fremont D.H. Crawford F.

The mechanism for this facilitated peptide exchange remains obscure despite intensive investigation. Given the results described above, one model for DM function would be that it binds the MHC-peptide complex in the open or “noncompact” conformation. If such a species is formed transiently during the peptide binding reaction, as suggested by recent kinetic studies (20.Natarajan S.K. Assadi M. Sadegh-Nasseri S. J.

The delocalization of conformational changes around the HLA-DR1 peptide-binding site facilitates such an interaction with HLA-DM and other proteins.In conclusion, we have shown that the association of HLA-DR1 with peptides as short as two to four residues, or partial occupancy of the P1 pocket by a point substitution, is sufficient to induce a conformational change that influences residues throughout the peptide-binding groove. Class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC)1 proteins bind peptide antigens and present them to CD4+ T-cells, a process crucial to T-cell selection and initiation of T-cell-mediated immune responses (1.Harding C.V.

We demonstrate here that hGH transiently phosphorylates and activates p38 MAP kinase in CHO cell lines stably transfected with rat GH receptor cDNA and that the activation of the p38 MAP kinase pathway by hGH is JAK2-dependent. Furthermore, both ATF-2 and CHOP (GADD153) are transcriptionally activated by hGH in a JAK2-dependent manner, and p38 MAP kinase is required for both cytoskeletal re-organization and cell proliferation stimulated by hGH. The p38 MAP kinase pathway is therefore an important regulator of the pleiotropic effects of GH. Recombinant human growth hormone (hGH) was a generous gift of Novo-Nordisk (Singapore).

Prior to treatment, cells were deprived of serum for 12–16 h in Ham's F-12 medium. Unless otherwise indicated, the final concentration of the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 was 30 μm, p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB205380 was 10 μm, and hGH was 50 nm.

After preincubation with inhibitors for respective time and/or incubation with hGH for the appropriate duration, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and cells were lysed at 4 °C in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton-100, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mmsodium orthovanadate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin) for 30 min with regular vortices. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 15 min, and the resulting supernatants were collected, and protein concentration was determined. Cell lysates dissolved in 1× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 1% mercaptoethanol, and bromphenol blue, boiled for 10 min, and centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 2 min were analyzed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) for 1 h at 22 °C. The blots were then treated with the primary antibody in PBST containing 1% non-fat dry milk at 4 °C overnight. After three washes with PBST, immunolabeling was detected by ECL according to the manufacturer's instructions. Membranes were then stripped by incubation for 30 min at 50 °C in a solution containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, and 0.7% mercaptoethanol. Blots were then washed for 30 min with several changes of PBST at room temperature. Efficacy of stripping was determined by re-exposure of the membranes to ECL. Thereafter, blots were reblocked and immunolabeled as described above. p38 MAP kinase assays were performed using New England Biolabs assay kit specific for p38α and p38β MAP kinase according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, CHO-GHR1–638 cells were serum-deprived for 16 h, treated with 50 nm hGH, and the cells lysed at 4 °C in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmglycerol phosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml leupeptin) per sample. The lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing 300 μg of protein per sample was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 20 μl of immobilized phospho-p38 MAP kinase (Thr-180/Tyr-182) monoclonal antibody in a final volume of 500 μl in 1× lysis buffer. The bead slurries were washed twice with 500 μl of lysis buffer containing 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and twice with 500 μl of kinase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm glycerol phosphate, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2). 3 μg of recombinant glutathioneS-transferase-ATF2 protein containing 1–109 amino-terminal amino acids of ATF-2 was added to each sample. The kinase reactions were carried out in the presence of 100 mm ATP at 30 °C for 30 min. Phosphorylation of ATF-2 at Thr-71 was determined by Western blot using phospho-ATF-2 (Thr-71) antibody (1:1000). p44/42 MAP kinase assays were also performed using New England Biolabs assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, cells were serum-deprived for 16 h, treated with 50 nm hGH, and lysed at 4 °C in 1 ml of lysis buffer (as described above) per sample. The lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing 200 μg of protein per sample was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 15 μl of immobilized phospho-specific p44/42 MAP kinase (Thr-202/Tyr-204) monoclonal antibody in a final volume of 500 μl in 1× lysis buffer. The pellets were washed twice with 500 μl of lysis buffer containing 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and washed twice with 500 μl of kinase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm glycerol phosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2). The kinase reactions were performed in the presence of 2 μg of Elk-1 fusion protein and 200 μm ATP at 30 °C for 30 min. Elk-1 phosphorylation was selectively detected by western immunoblotting using a chemiluminescent detection system and a specific phospho-Elk-1 (Ser-383) antibody (1:1000). CHO-GHR1–638 cells were cultured to 60–80% confluence for transfection experiments in 6-well plates. 1 μg of reporter plasmid pFR-Luc was transfected together with 20 ng of the respective fusion trans-activator plasmid (pFA-ATF-2, pFA-CHOP, pFA-Elk-1, or pFC2-dbd). For transient transfection of MAP kinases, either 1.5 μg of pCDNA3-p38α MAPK, dominant negative pCDNA3-p38α MAPK, or pCDNA3-p42 MAPK were transfected in each well. Control empty vector was used to normalize the amount of plasmids in each well. For each well, 4 μg of DOTAP for each μg of DNA was used as per the manufacturer's instructions. DNA and the DOTAP reagents were diluted separately in 100 μl of serum-free medium mixed and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. DNA-lipid complex was diluted to a final volume of 6 ml (for triplicate samples) with serum-free medium. Cells in each well were rinsed once with 2 ml of serum-free medium, and 2 ml of diluted DNA-lipid complex was overlaid in each well and incubated for 6 h. After incubation, complete Ham's F-12 medium containing 2% FBS was added to each well so as to incubate the cells in 0.5% serum for 12–16 h. Cells were pretreated with 10 μm SB203580 or 30 μm PD98059 or with the equivalent amount of solvent (Me2SO) as a control for 45 min prior to stimulation with hGH. 50 nm hGH was added for an additional 5–7 h. The cells were washed in PBS and lysed with 300 μl of 1× lysis buffer (25 mm Tris phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100) by a freeze-thaw cycle, and lysate was collected by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was used for the assay of luciferase and β-galactosidase activity. The luciferase activities were normalized on the basis of protein content as well as on the β-galactosidase activity of pCMVβ vector. The β-galactosidase assay was performed with 20 μl of precleared cell lysate according to a standard protocol (62.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Mean and standard deviations of at least three independent experiments are shown in the figures. Cells were fixed in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde, washed with PBS, permeabilized for 5 min with 0.1% Triton X-100, blocked in 2% bovine serum albumin, and incubated with phalloidin-TRITC (0.2 mg/ml) after the indicated treatments. Excess phalloidin-TRITC was removed by extensive washing with PBS. Labeled cells were visualized with a Carl Zeiss Axioplan microscope equipped with epifluorescence optics and a Bio-Rad MRC1024 confocal laser system. Images were converted to the tagged information file format and processed with the MacIntosh Photoshop program. Cell proliferation was assayed by measuring incorporation of [3H]thymidine during DNA synthesis (63.Coward P. Wada H.G. Falk M.S. Chan S.D. Meng F. Akil H. Conklin B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The Moco consists of a mononuclear molybdenum coordinated by the dithiolene moiety of a family of tricyclic pyranopterin structures, the simplest of which is commonly referred to as molybdopterin. In the past few years, several crystal structures of enzymes containing this cofactor have been determined (1.Chan M.K. Mukund S. Kletzin A. Adams M.W.W. Rees D.C.

These initial structures each define one of the four currently recognized families containing Moco (5.Kisker C. Schindelin H. Rees D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 233-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Moco deficiency is a severe disease in humans that usually leads to premature death in early childhood and is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. The affected patients show neurological abnormalities such as attenuated growth of the brain, untreatable seizures and often, dislocated ocular lenses. Recently, the first mutations in a number of genes encoding Moco biosynthetic proteins have been identified (6.Reiss J. Cohen N. Dorche C. Mandel H. Mendel R.R. Stallmeyer B. Zabot M.T. Dierks T.

Genes involved in Moco biosynthesis have been identified in eubacteria, archaea, and eukarya. Although some details of the biosynthetic pathway leading to Moco formation are still unclear at present, the pathway can be divided into three phases (9.Rajagopalan K.V. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.C.1996: 674-679Google Scholar, 10.Rajagopalan K.V. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). (i) In early steps, a guanosine derivative, most likely GTP, is converted into precursor Z. This reaction is different from other pterin biosynthetic pathways, since C8 of the purine is not eliminated but is incorporated into the pyran ring of the tricyclic pyranopterin (11.Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1082-1087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 12.Rieder C. Eisenreich W. O'Brien J. Richter G. Götze E. Boyle P. Blanchard S. Bacher A. Simon H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 24-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). (ii) Precursor Z is transformed into molybdopterin, generating the dithiolene group responsible for molybdenum coordination. This reaction is catalyzed by molybdopterin synthase, a two-subunit enzyme (13.Pitterle D.M. Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13506-13509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the activated form of the synthase, the C terminus of the small subunit is converted to a glycine thiocarboxylate (14.Pitterle D.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13499-13505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that appears to be a sulfur donor for the conversion of precursor Z to molybdopterin. In turn, molybdopterin synthase is resulfurated by MoeB (10.Rajagopalan K.V. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). (iii) Finally, the metal is incorporated into the apo-cofactor. Based on the observation that high concentrations of molybdate in the growth medium can partially rescue amogA mutant, MogA has been proposed to act as a molybdochelatase incorporating molybdenum into molybdopterin (15.Joshi M.S. Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Bact. 1996; 178: 4310-4312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence of tight binding of molybdopterin to a domain of the Cnx1 protein from Arabidopsis thaliana that is homologous to MogA supports this possible function of the protein (16.Schwarz G. Boxer D.H. Mendel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26811-26814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In the central nervous system, gephyrin (17.Prior P. Schmitt B. Grenningloh G. Pribilla I. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Maulet Y. Werner P. Langosch D. Kirsch J. Betz H. Neuron. 1992; 8: 1161-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) is responsible for the postsynaptic anchoring of inhibitory glycine receptors to the cytoskeleton, linking the β-subunit of the receptor and tubulin (18.Kirsch J. Langosch D. Prior P. Littauer U.Z. Schmitt B. Betz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22242-22245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,19.Kirsch J. Betz H. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4148-4156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gephyrin also appears to be involved in the postsynaptic localization of major GABAA receptor subtypes (20.Essrich C. Lorez M. Benson J.A. Fritschy J.-M. Lüscher B. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Recently, gephyrin was shown to interact with RAFT1, a DNA-activating protein kinase. Through this binding, gephyrin is also involved in rapamycin-sensitive signaling (21.Sabatini D.M. Barrow R.K. Blackshaw S. Burnett P.E. Lai M.M. Field M.E. Bahr B.A. Kirsch J. Betz H. Snyder S.H. Science. 1999; 284: 1161-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of gephyrin indicates that it originated from a fusion of two genes: one related to MogA (Fig. 1) and the other to MoeA, another protein involved in Moco biosynthesis. In gephyrin, these two entities are linked by an additional 160-residue domain. Although the different activities of gephyrin have not been mapped onto its primary sequence, direct participation of gephyrin in molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis in mammalian cells and plants has been demonstrated (22.Feng G. Tintrup H. Kirsch J. Nichol M.C. Kuhse J. Betz H. Sanes J.R. Science. 1998; 282: 1321-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar,23.Stallmeyer B. Schwarz G. Schulze J. Nerlich A. Reiss J.

We present here the purification, characterization, and high resolution crystal structure of Escherichia coli MogA. The 195-residue protein is folded into a compact molecule with α/β/α architecture and forms a trimer in both crystal forms studied. Based on the location of conserved residues, results from site-directed mutagenesis studies, and residual electron density possibly representing trace amounts of molybdopterin, we have assigned one region of the enzyme as the putative active site. The structure of MogA provides a framework for the interpretation of amino acid substitutions leading to Moco deficiency in humans and also represents a starting point for an understanding of how the multiple activities of gephyrin are organized in the context of its three-dimensional structure. The E. coli mogA gene was cloned from genomic DH5α DNA with the aid of the polymerase chain reaction. Using the published gene sequence (24.James R. Dean D.O. Debbage J. DNA Seq. 1993; 3: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), primers were designed to allow cloning into the NcoI and BamHI sites in the multiple cloning region of the pET-15b expression vector (Novagen) to yield pMWgA15. In the course of cloning, the second amino acid of the protein was changed from asparagine to alanine. For expression, 1-liter cultures of BL21(DE3) cells carrying the plasmid were induced atA 600 = 0.6 with 0.1 μmisopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside and harvested after 4 h of aerobic growth at 28 °C. The cells were suspended in 10 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA and frozen at −20 °C. All buffers used during purification contained 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, with additional components as indicated. The thawed cell suspension was passed twice through a French pressure cell. The volume of the extract was increased to 400 ml with additional suspension buffer prior to the addition of 44 ml of 20% (w/v) streptomycin sulfate. Precipitated nucleic acids were removed by centrifugation. Solid ammonium sulfate (291 g/liter) was added slowly to the resulting supernatant, which was centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min before addition of a second aliquot of 72 g/liter ammonium sulfate. After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended and dialyzed overnight against a buffer containing 25 mm NaCl. The dialyzed sample was applied to a Q-Sepharose column, and MogA was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1–0.6m NaCl. This and subsequent chromatography steps were performed using an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech FPLC system. Fractions containing MogA were dialyzed overnight. Prior to injection onto a phenyl-Sepharose column, the sample was brought to 20% saturation with ammonium sulfate and subsequently eluted from the column with a 20–0% saturated ammonium sulfate gradient. After concentration, the protein was chromatographed on a Superose 12 column equilibrated with buffer containing 50 mm NaCl. Fractions containing pure MogA were pooled and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm NaCl, and concentrated to 10–12 mg/ml. The total yield of MogA was 10–15 mg per liter of cells. The Transformer Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit fromCLONTECH was employed for the generation of the following single amino acid substitutions: S12A, D49A, T76A, R81A, D82A, S107A, and S117A. Nucleic acid sequences were verified by automated sequencing of both strands. Mutant MogA proteins were purified by the same procedure as the wild type protein with the exception that the RK5231(DE3) cell line described below was used for expression. The λ DE3 lysogenization kit from Novagen was used to integrate the gene for T7 RNA polymerase into the chromosomes of the RK5206 and RK5231mogA − strains. The resulting strains, RK5206(DE3) and RK5231(DE3), were then transformed with pWM15gA expressing either wild type or one of the seven mutant MogA proteins. The eight RK5206(DE3) expression strains were streaked onto Luria Broth plates and grown overnight at 30 °C. The presence of nitrate reductase activity in the cells was determined by an overlay assay (25.Johnson M.E. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 117-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wild type, D49A, and D82A MogA proteins were purified as described above. Aliquots of xanthine oxidase (Sigma) in 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, were denatured anaerobically for 1 min at 80 °C and then used as the source of molybdopterin. Equal volumes of MogA protein (79 μm) and molybdopterin (0.2 μm) were incubated aerobically for 5 min. Subsequently, 20-μl aliquots of this solution were mixed with 10 μl of 0.5 m sodium molybdate and 25 μl of an extract of the nit-1 mutant of Neurospora crassain a total volume of 100 μl. The remainder of the assay for nitrate reductase activity was performed as described previously (26.Pitterle D.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3373-3378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hexagonal rods (Space group P63 witha = 65.7 Å and c = 65.1 Å) containing 1 monomer per asymmetric unit were obtained by vapor diffusion against a reservoir containing 1.0–1.1 m sodium citrate in 0.1m Hepes, pH 7.5, within a few days. A second crystal form (P212121 with a = 54.9 Å, b = 74.2 Å, and c = 166.8 Å) was grown from 16–20% PEG 4000 and 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.5. These crystals were difficult to reproduce and were not used for structure solution. The hexagonal crystal form was solved by multiple isomorphous replacement using a mercury derivative (1 mmEMTS) and a platinum derivative (1 mm PIP). Initial native (NatL) and derivative data sets were collected to resolutions of 2.5 (NatL and EMTS) and 3.3 Å (PIP) at room temperature on a Rigaku RU 200 rotating anode x-ray generator equipped with double focusing mirror optics and an R-axis II imaging plate detector. Data were indexed, integrated and scaled with the HKL software (27.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter C.W. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology: Macromolecular Crystallography. 276. Academic Press, San Diego1997: 307-326Google Scholar). For subsequent calculations, the CCP4 suite was used with exceptions as indicated (28.Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. 1994; D50: 760-763Google Scholar). The EMTS derivative was solved by Patterson methods and direct methods using SHELX (29.Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. 1990; A46: 467-473Crossref Scopus (19251) Google Scholar), and the PIP derivative was solved by difference Fourier calculations. Phase refinement was performed with SHARP (30.DeLaFortelle E. Bricogne G. Carter C.W. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology: Macromolecular Crystallography. 276. Academic Press, San Diego1997: 472-494Google Scholar) to a resolution of 2.5 Å followed by solvent flattening with SOLOMON (31.Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. 1996; D52: 30-42Crossref Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). The resulting electron density map was of reasonable quality and a polyalanine model composed of two stretches with a total of 165 out of 195 residues was built with O (32.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. 1991; A47: 110-119Crossref Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). After torsion angle dynamics refinement with X-PLOR (33.Brünger A.T. Rice L.M. Carter C.W. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology: Macromolecular Crystallography. 277. Academic Press, San Diego1997: 243-269Google Scholar) at 2.5 Å resolution, model and experimental phases were combined, and the sequence was assigned using the single Trp at position 31 as a marker. Further refinement using X-PLOR yielded a preliminary model (R cryst= 0.206 and R free = 0.280) comprising residues 4–13 and 22–186. With this model, the orthorhombic crystal form was solved by molecular replacement using AMORE (34.Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. 1994; A50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar). While attempting to collect high resolution data of the hexagonal crystal form, all newly grown crystals showed merohedral twinning with twinning ratios between 0.3 and 0.5. Twinning was not present in the crystals used for structure solution. Refinement against a twinned 1.6 Å data set was attempted using SHELXL (35.Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Carter C.W. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology: Macromolecular Crystallography. 277. Academic Press, San Diego1997: 319-343Google Scholar). However, some regions in the structure that were well defined in SIGMAA weighted 2F o − F c electron density maps at 2.5 Å resolution appeared fragmented in the twinned data set. A search for new crystallization conditions led to the discovery that the hexagonal crystals could also be obtained from solutions containing 2.0–2.4 m (NH4)2SO4and 0.1 m Bicine, pH 9.0. These crystals diffract x-rays to 1.4 Å resolution at beamline X26C at the National Synchrotron Light Source. Two data sets (NatH1 and NatH2) were collected to resolutions of 1.45 and 1.6 Å, respectively, with a MAR Research imaging plate detector. Refinement against both data sets was performed using a combination of X-PLOR and REFMAC (36.Murshudov G. Vagin A. Dodson E. Acta Crystallogr. 1997; D53: 240-255Crossref Scopus (13914) Google Scholar). All data between 20 Å and the respective high resolution limits were included, and partial structure factors for the bulk solvent contribution were calculated in X-PLOR. The gene encoding MogA was cloned from genomic E. coli DNA using the polymerase chain reaction. For homologous expression, the gene was inserted into the pET15b vector, and the resulting plasmid was transferred into host cells containing an isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside-inducible chromosomal copy of the T7 RNA polymerase gene. Purification of the expressed wild type protein to greater than 98% homogeneity employed fractionated ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by ion exchange, hydrophobic interaction, and size exclusion chromatography. The crystal structure of MogA was solved by multiple isomorphous replacement using the hexagonal crystal form (TablesI and II). The structure has been refined against two different native data sets at 1.45 Å (NatH1) and 1.6 Å (NatH2) resolution to crystallographicR-factors of 0.187 (R free = 0.213) and 0.205 (R free = 0.227), respectively (TableII). The overall quality of both models is very good as judged by the low free R-factors, the low deviations from stereochemical ideality and the appearance of the Ramachandran diagram. For the two models, 95.4 and 91.0% of the residues were found in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran diagram, as defined in PROCHECK (37.Laskowski R.A. McArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Lys-125, which is well defined in SIGMAA weighted 2F o −F c electron density maps was found to be the only Ramachandran outlier in both structures. The NatH1 model contains residues 2–14 and 22–191, three sulfate molecules and 124 water molecules. The NatH2 model contains 160 water molecules, the same three sulfate molecules, and all of the above residues with the addition of residues 20 and 21. Residues 192–195 are disordered in both structures, and the N-terminal Met has been removed posttranslationally.

MogA has an α/β/α structure and is composed of a central, predominantly parallel β-sheet core containing five long strands (β1, β2, β3, β5 and β6). The β-sheet is surrounded by two α-helices on one side and four α-helices and a 310helix on the opposite side (Fig. 2,A and B). The single anti-parallel strand (β5) is located near one edge of the β-sheet. The overall dimensions of the slightly ellipsoidal molecule are 47 × 32 × 37 Å. An interesting region in the structure is located between residues 135 and 169. Residues 135–144 form α5 and residues 158–169 form α6, which after one helical turn exhibiting 310 conformation, changes to α-helical conformation. This transition is caused by Pro-163, which prevents the formation of a regular hydrogen-bonding pattern and also introduces a sharp kink. Together, α-helices 5 and 6 appear as a pseudocontinuous but strongly bent and kinked helix interrupted by residues 145–157, which form a short β-hairpin with a type I β-turn. The residues forming the β-hairpin are absent from most MogA sequences, indicating that other MogA representatives, such as gephyrin and Cnx1, could contain one continuous helix instead. In both crystal forms, the oligomeric state of MogA is a trimer (Fig. 2 C). In the hexagonal crystal form, the trimer is formed by a crystallographic 3-fold axis, whereas the trimer constitutes the content of the asymmetric unit in the orthorhombic crystal form. Analytical ultracentrifugation studies of MogA yield a molecular mass of 59,675 Da, consistent with a trimeric arrangement of a protein with a monomer molecular mass of 21,048 Da. The trimer is formed by interactions involving residues primarily located in β-strands 4 and 5, α4 and the 310 helix (residues 94–124), the loop comprising residues 77–83, and residues 156–169, including helix α6. Approximately 1400 Å2 of acessible surface area is buried upon trimerization, which corresponds to 16% of the molecular surface of each monomer. The interface between two monomers has polar interactions with a total of 7 hydrogen bonds in each monomer-monomer interface, as well as a hydrophobic core including Pro-78, Met-96, Pro-97, Phe-99, Pro-112, Ile-115, Leu-116, His-156, Tyr-164, Cys-165, Leu-168, and Leu-169. Several of these residues are type-conserved (Fig. 1), suggesting that MogA from other organisms might also form a trimer. A search for structural homologues of MogA with the program DALI (38.Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar) revealed a rather large number of related structures (102 structures with a Z-score greater than 3). The best matches were the N-terminal domain of the receptornegative regulator of the amidase operon (Protein Data Bank entry 1pea), the N-terminal domain of the leucine/isoleucine/valine-binding protein (Protein Data Bank entry 2liv), and the C-terminal domain of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (Protein Data Bank entry 1req-A). Interestingly, residues 94–124 in MogA, which include strands β4 and β5 as well as α4 and the 310 helix, have no equivalent residues in these matches. In the context of the three-dimensional structure of MogA, this part of the sequence can be viewed as an insertion, which allows MogA to trimerize (see above). Despite a significantly lower Z-score, one additional match is worth mentioning: the periplasmic molybdate transport protein ModA, which is involved in molybdate uptake. Like the receptornegative regulator of the amidase operon and the leucine/isoleucine/valine-binding protein, ModA is a two-domain protein, and MogA shares similarity with only one of the domains. An interesting aspect of the crystal structure is the presence of an unusual eletron density feature shown in Fig. 3 A near the highly conserved TXGGTG motif (residues 72–77 in E. coli MogA). This density can be explained by neither protein atoms nor water molecules. Due to its tetrahedral appearance and the presence of high sulfate concentrations in the mother liquor, this feature has been modeled as sulfate. However, there is additional density extending from one of the sulfate oxygens, which might indicate that substoichiometric amounts of molybdopterin or a related compound remained bound to the enzyme during purification. The tetrahedral density feature could thus mark the position of the terminal phosphate group of molybdopterin. Given the close structural similarity between the anions sulfate, phosphate and molybdate, the question arises whether this binding site could also accommodate molybdate. Two lines of evidence argue against this possibility. (i) Atomic absorption spectroscopy of purified MogA failed to detect the presence of molybdenum both before and after equilibrium dialysis against sodium molybdate (data not shown). (ii) Refinement against a 2.5 Å resolution data set collected from a crystal grown from citrate and 50 mm Na2MoO4 did not show bound molybdate at any of the three sulfate binding sites. Together, these results indicate that MogA does not bind free molybdate. Failure to bind molybdate has been previously described for the MogA-homologous domain of Cnx1 (16.Schwarz G. Boxer D.H. Mendel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26811-26814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A comparison of the two models derived from the 1.45 and 1.6 Å data sets reveals surprisingly large conformational changes for residues between positions 107 and 113. These residues form the C-terminal end of α4 and the N-terminal half of the 310 helix. Although the overall root mean square deviation between the main chain atoms of both models is 0.4 Å, the deviation is substantially larger (up to 3.9 Å) for the residues in this region, as shown in Fig. 3 B. In the NatH1 structure, residues 111–117 form a 310 helix, which is shortened in the NatH2 form by two residues at its N terminus. Small structural changes are also present in the β-hairpin formed by residues 145–156, which could be a consequence of its close proximity to the side chains of His-109 and Phe-110. One additional structural change involves the side chain of Asp-49, which adopts different side chain conformations in the two models. The NatH1 and NatH2 data sets were collected from crystals grown from two different MogA protein preparations under slightly different crystallization conditions. The NatH1 crystals were grown from 2.0–2.1 m(NH4)2SO4, compared with 2.3–2.4m (NH4)2SO4 for the NatH2 crystals. Either difference or a combination of both might explain the structural differences between the two models. In order to characterize the functional significance of some of the"

Exposure to recombinant P. multocida toxin (rPMT) causes phospholipase C-mediated hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids, calcium mobilization, and activation of protein kinase C via a poorly characterized mechanism involving Gq/11 family heterotrimeric G proteins. To determine whether the regulation of G protein pathways contributes to the mitogenic effects of rPMT, we have examined the mechanism whereby rPMT stimulates the Erk mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade in cultured HEK-293 cells. Treatment with rPMT resulted in a dose and time-dependent increase in Erk 1/2 phosphorylation that paralleled its stimulation of inositol phospholipid hydrolysis. Both rPMT- and α-thrombin receptor- stimulated Erk phosphorylation were selectively blocked by cellular expression of two peptide inhibitors of Gq/11 signaling, the dominant negative mutant G protein-coupled receptor kinase, GRK2(K220R), and the Gαqcarboxyl-terminal peptide, Gαq-(305–359). Like α-thrombin receptor-mediated Erk activation, the effect of rPMT was insensitive to the protein kinase C inhibitor GF109203X, but was blocked by the epidermal growth factor receptor-specific tyrphostin, AG1478 and by dominant negative mutants of mSos1 and Ha-Ras.

Adv. Vet. Sci. 1967; 11: 321-379PubMed Google Scholar). It is a significant veterinary, and occasional human, pathogen and the cause of swine atrophic rhinitis, a condition characterized by osteoclastic bone resorption and severe progressive turbinate damage. The pathogenicity of P. multocida is related to the production of a 146-kDa toxin (2.Buys W.C.E.M. Smith H.E. Camps A.M.I.E. Kamp E.M.

Both native and recombinant PMT1 are potently mitogenic for several cell types in vitro (4.Rozengurt E. Higgins T. Chanter N. Lax A.J. Staddon J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In Rat1 fibroblasts, rPMT produces anchorage-independent DNA synthesis and growth in soft agar (5.Higgins T. Murphy A.C. Staddon J.M. Lax A.J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4240-4244Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In primary osteoblastic cells in culture, rPMT induces cell proliferation and down-regulation of markers of osteoblast differentiation (6.Mullan P.B. Lax A.J. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 959-965Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms whereby rPMT exerts its mitogenic effects are poorly understood. The toxin interacts with a ganglioside-type cell surface receptor and is internalized via both coated and noncoated endocytic structures (7.Pettit R.K. Ackermann M.R. Rimler R.B. Lab. Invest. 1993; 69: 94-100PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Dudet L.I. Challier P. Dubreuil J.D. Martineau-Doize B. Infect. Immun. 1996; 66: 5636-5642Google Scholar). The mitogenic effects of rPMT require its internalization, since exposure of cells to rPMT at 4 °C or incubation with the weak base methylamine prevents the response (4.Rozengurt E. Higgins T.

Exposure to rPMT stimulates the hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids, calcium mobilization, and phosphorylation of protein kinase C (PKC) substrates, including the myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate protein (4.Rozengurt E.

In addition, rPMT has been shown to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins, including the focal adhesion kinase p125FAK and paxillin, and to promote both focal adhesion assembly and the formation of actin stress fibers (8.Dudet L.I. Challier P. Dubreuil J.D. Martineau-Doize B. Infect. Immun. 1996; 66: 5636-5642Google Scholar,10.Lacerda H.M. Lax A.J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 439-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that rPMT exerts at least some its effects by modulating the activity of Gq/11 family heterotrimeric G proteins. Treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with low doses of rPMT strongly potentiates inositol phosphate production following stimulation of Gq/11-coupled receptors, and PMT-induced phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis in permeabilized cells is blocked by guanosine 5′-O-(β-thiodiphosphate) (11.Murphy A.C. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25296-25303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). InXenopus oocytes, rPMT-induced calcium-dependent chloride currents are blocked by the injection of specific antisera against PLCβ1 or the α subunit of Gq/11 and by Gαq antisense RNA, and are dramatically enhanced by overexpression of Gαq (12.Wilson B.A. Zhu X. Ho M. Lu L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1268-1275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Recently, many heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been shown to activate the Erk mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. The mechanisms whereby these signals are transduced are characterized by significant heterogeneity. Depending upon cell type, GPCRs have been shown to mediate both Ras-independent Erk activation via stimulation of PKC isoforms, and Ras-dependent Erk activation via activation of receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine protein kinases (13.van Biesen T. Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 698-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 14.Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Since rPMT is thought to mediate many of its effect via the regulation of heterotrimeric G proteins, understanding the mechanisms of PMT-induced mitogenesis might enhance our understanding of the roles of heterotrimeric G proteins in the regulation of cell growth. In this study, we have compared the mechanism of rPMT-mediated Erk activation to that employed by endogenous GPCRs in HEK-293 cells. We find that rPMT activates the Erk cascade via the stimulation of Gq/11 family G proteins. Subsequently, both rPMT and endogenous Gq/11-coupled α-thrombin receptors induce Ras-dependent Erk activation via protein kinase C-independent “transactivation” of the EGF receptor. Thus, rPMT represents a novel bacterial strategy for inducing cell proliferation, by usurping heterotrimeric G protein-regulated mitogenic signals. Recombinant P. multocida toxin (rPMT) expressed in Escherichia coli was prepared as described previously (15.Wilson B.A. Ponferrada V.G. Vallance J.E. Ho M. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 80-87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bis-indolylmaleimide I (GF109203X), EGF, and tyrphostin AG1478 were from Calbiochem. Bordetella pertussistoxin was from List Biologicals. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) were from Sigma.myo-[2-3H]Inositol was from NEN Life Science Products. The thrombin agonist hexapeptide H3N+-serine-phenylalanine-leucine-leucine-arginine-asparagine-COOH (SFLLRN) was synthesized at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute peptide facility (Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC). Eukaryotic plasmids for the expression of the cDNAs encoding Gαq(Q209L), Gαq-(305–359), GRK2(K220R), and mSos1(1071–1336) were prepared in our laboratory. The expression plasmid encoding HA epitope-tagged Erk 1 was provided by J. Pouyssegur (16.Meloche S. Pages G. Pouyssegur J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The expression plasmid encoding Ha-Ras(N17) was provided by D. Altschuler. HEK-293 cells were from the American Type Culture Collection. HEK-293 cells were maintained in minimum essential medium with Earle's salts (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. Transient transfections were performed using a modified calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (17.Luttrell L.M. Ostrowski J. Cotecchia S. Kendall H. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1993; 259: 1453-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Monolayers of transfected cells were incubated in serum-free minimum essential medium supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and gentamicin for 16–20 h prior to stimulation. Expression of transiently expressed mutants of GRK2, Gαq, mSos1, and Ha-Ras was confirmed by protein immunoblotting of whole cell lysates. GRK2(K220R) was detected using a 1:3000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-GRK2 (18.Attramadal H. Arriza J.L. Aoki C. Dawson T.M. Codina J. Kwatra M.M. Snyder S.H. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17882-17890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mSos1(1071–1336) was detected using a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-mSos1,2 (Transduction Laboratories), and Gαq-(305–359) was detected using a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-Gαq carboxyl terminus (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), each with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Laboratories) as secondary antibody. N17Ras was detected using a 1:500 dilution of monoclonal anti-Ras (Transduction Laboratories), with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Laboratories) as secondary antibody. Proteins on nitrocellulose were visualized by enzyme-linked chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HEK-293 cells on six-well plates were labeled overnight with 2 μCi/mlmyo-[2-3H]inositol, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and placed in PBS supplemented with 10 mm LiCl and 1 mm CaCl2. Cells pretreated with rPMT were incubated for 45 min in Li+/Ca2+ PBS prior to lysis, while cells treated with agonist were preincubated for 15 min with Li+/Ca2+ followed by the addition of agonist for 30 min prior to lysis. Cells were lysed by the addition of 1.0 ml of 0.4 m perchloric acid, and a 0.8-ml aliquot of the resulting cell lysate was neutralized with 0.4 ml of 0.72 mKOH, 0.6 m KHCO3. Total inositol phosphates were determined by Dowex anion exchange chromatography as described previously (19.Hawes B.E. Luttrell L.M. Exum S.T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15776-15785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment with rPMT or receptor agonist drugs was performed at 37 °C in serum-free medium following preincubation with inhibitors, as described in the figure legends. Erk 1/2 activation was assessed by measuring the phosphorylation state of endogenously expressed Erk 1/2 or of HA epitope-tagged Erk 1 immunoprecipitated from transiently transfected cells. For determination of endogenous Erk 1/2 phosphorylation, cell monolayers on 12-well plates were washed once with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 200 μl/well Laemmli sample buffer. Approximately 15 μg of whole cell lysate protein/lane was resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Erk 1/2 phosphorylation was detected by protein immunoblotting using a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal phosphospecific MAP kinase IgG (New England Biolabs) with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as secondary antibody. Quantitation of Erk 1/2 phosphorylation was performed using scanning laser densitometry. After quantitation of Erk 1/2 phosphorylation, nitrocellulose membranes were stripped of immunoglobulin and reprobed using rabbit polyclonal anti-Erk1/2 IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to confirm equal loading of Erk2 protein. In other experiments, transiently expressed HA epitope-tagged Erk 1 was immunoprecipitated from cells coexpressing putative dominant inhibitory mutant proteins. Following stimulation, monolayers on six-well plates were washed once with PBS and lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold immunoprecipitation precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.25% w/v sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% v/v Nonidet P-40, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 μm NaVO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation and immunoprecipitation of HA-Erk1 was performed using 20 μl of HA.11 affinity matrix (Berkeley Antibody Co.) with 2 h agitation at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed twice with ice-cold immunoprecipitation precipitation buffer and once with PBS, denatured in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Quantitation of HA-Erk 1 phosphorylation was determined by protein immunoblotting using rabbit polyclonal phosphospecific MAP kinase IgG (New England Biolabs) as described. As shown in Fig.1, treatment of HEK-293 cells with rPMT resulted in a dose- and time-dependent increase in Erk 1/2 phosphorylation. Erk 1/2 phosphorylation in rPMT-treated cells reached a maximum 6–10-fold over basal increase after 24–48 h of continuous exposure (Fig. 1 A). Increasing concentrations of rPMT up to 100 ng/ml produced dose-dependent increases in Erk 1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 1 B), which approximately paralleled rPMT-induced increases in inositol phosphate hydrolysis (Fig.1 C). Several lines of evidence suggest that the stimulation of inositol phosphate hydrolysis in response to rPMT results from toxin-induced activation of heterotrimeric G proteins (11.Murphy A.C. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25296-25303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Wilson B.A. Zhu X. Ho M. Lu L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1268-1275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To examine whether heterotrimeric G proteins contributed to rPMT-induced activation of the Erk cascade, we initially determined whether rPMT-induced Erk 1/2 activation was additive with that induced by endogenous Gi-coupled and Gq/11-coupled receptors. As shown in Fig. 2, stimulation of predominantly Gq/11-coupled α-thrombin receptors in HEK-293 cells increased Erk 1/2 phosphorylation 8–10-fold. Pretreatment with rPMT for 24 h prior to stimulation failed to produce an additive response. In contrast, rPMT-mediated Erk 1/2 phosphorylation was additive with that induced by acute stimulation of the predominantly Gi-coupled LPA receptor. Interestingly, the rPMT effect was also not additive with Erk 1/2 phosphorylation induced via the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase. The lack of additivity between rPMT and α-thrombin receptor-mediated Erk 1/2 activation suggests that a common G protein pool might mediate the response to both stimuli. To determine the role of heterotrimeric G proteins in rPMT-mediated Erk 1/2 activation, we employed three selective inhibitors of G protein function: B. pertussistoxin, which ADP-ribosylates and inactivates Gi/o family G proteins, and two inhibitory polypeptides GRK2(K220R) and Gαq-(305–359). The catalytically inactive mutant of the G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) 2, GRK2(K220R), which functions as an dominant negative antagonist of GPCR desensitization (20.Diviani D.

This effect results from the direct binding and sequestration of Gαq/11 subunits by an RGS homology domain in the amino terminus of GRK2 (22.Siderovski D.P. Strockbine B. Behe C.I. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 34: 215-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). GRK2 also contains a carboxyl-terminal Gβγ subunit binding motif, which inhibits G protein signaling by sequestering free Gβγ subunits (23.Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Inglese J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6193-6197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Gαq-(305–359) peptide, derived from the carboxyl-terminal 55 amino acids of Gαq, inhibits Gq/11-coupled, but not Gi-coupled, receptor-mediated PI hydrolysis in COS-7 cells (24.Akhter S. Luttrell L.M. Rockman H.A. Iaccarino G. Lefkowitz R.J. Koch W.J. Science. 1998; 280: 574-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, pertussis toxin treatment had no effect on rPMT-stimulated Erk 1/2 phosphorylation in HEK-293 cells. Stimulation of Erk 1/2 by endogenous α-thrombin receptors was minimally affected by pertussis toxin, consistent with Erk activation mediated predominantly via Gq/11 family G proteins. In contrast, LPA-stimulated Erk 1/2 phosphorylation was significantly reduced by pertussis toxin, consistent with a predominantly Gi-mediated response. EGF-stimulated Erk 1/2 activation was pertussis toxin-insensitive. In contrast to the lack of pertussis toxin effect, cellular expression of GRK2(K220R) and Gαq-(305–359) each significantly attenuated rPMT-mediated Erk 1/2 activation. To optimize the detection of signals originating from the transfected cell pool, HEK-293 cells in these experiments were transiently cotransfected with HA epitope-tagged Erk 1 (HA-Erk 1) along with the putative inhibitory peptide, and the phosphorylation state of immunoprecipitated HA-Erk 1 determined. As shown in Fig. 4 A, expression of GRK2(K220R) significantly attenuated HA-Erk 1 phosphorylation in response to rPMT treatment, and to stimulation of α-thrombin and LPA receptors, with no effect on EGF-stimulated HA-Erk 1 activation. Phosphorylation of HA-Erk 1 resulting from cellular expression of a constitutively activated mutant of Gαq(Gαq(Q209L)) was also attenuated by GRK2(K220R) expression, consistent with direct inhibition of Gαq-dependent signals by GRK2(K220R). Thus, inhibition by GRK2(K220R) is indicative either of a role for Gq/11 proteins or for Gβγ subunits in rPMT-mediated Erk activation. To discriminate between these alternatives, we employed the Gαq-(305–359) peptide. Cellular expression of this peptide has been shown to inhibit Gq/11-dependent, but not Gi- or Gs-dependent signaling in COS-7 cells (24.Akhter S. Luttrell L.M. Rockman H.A. Iaccarino G. Lefkowitz R.J. Koch W.J. Science. 1998; 280: 574-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 B, expression of Gαq-(305–359) significantly attenuated inositol phosphate production induced either by acute stimulation of α-thrombin receptor or by expression of Gαq(Q209L), consistent with direct inhibition of Gαq-dependent signals by Gαq-(305–359). As shown in Fig. 4 C, Gαq-(305–359) expression markedly inhibited HA-Erk 1 phosphorylation in response to rPMT treatment, Gαq(Q209L) expression, and stimulation of α-thrombin receptors. LPA-stimulated HA-Erk 1 phosphorylation was less sensitive to Gαq-(305–359) expression, consistent with the greater contribution of pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins to LPA-stimulated Erk activation in these cells (Fig. 3), and EGF-stimulated HA-Erk phosphorylation was insensitive to Gαq-(305–359) expression. Collectively, these data suggest that rPMT mediates Erk activation in HEK-293 cells via Gq/11 family G proteins. The sensitivity of sustained rPMT-mediated HA-Erk 1 phosphorylation to GRK2(K220R) and Gαq-(305–359) expression parallels that of the constitutively active Gαq(Q209L) mutant. In addition, the lack of additivity observed between rPMT-mediated Erk activation and that induced by the predominantly Gq/11-coupled α-thrombin receptor suggests that the two signals converge upon a common intermediate. The mechanisms whereby GPCRs activate the Erk cascade are characterized by extensive heterogeneity (13.van Biesen T. Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 698-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 14.Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Depending upon cell type, receptors coupled to Gq/11proteins have been shown to mediate both Ras-independent Erk activation via stimulation of PKC isoforms, and Ras-dependent Erk activation via activation of receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine protein kinases. In the latter case, GPCR-induced activation of receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the EGF receptor (25.Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar, 26.Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7032-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), or of focal adhesion kinases (FAK), such as the calcium-dependent FAK kinase Pyk2 (27.Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Mussachio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar, 28.Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar), serves to initiate a tyrosine phosphorylation cascade leading to Ras activation. The absence of an additive effect of rPMT treatment on EGF-stimulated Erk 1/2 phosphorylation is consistent with a role for EGF receptors in mediating the rPMT response. In addition, rPMT is known to stimulate both inositol phosphate hydrolysis and to induce calcium- and PKC-independent tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins, including p125FAK and paxillin (10.Lacerda H.M. Lax A.J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 439-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, it is plausible that either mechanism could account for rPMT-stimulated Erk activation. To discriminate between these mechanisms, we assessed the sensitivity of rPMT-mediated Erk 1/2 activation to specific PKC and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. As shown in Fig.5 A, inhibition of classical PKC isoforms with GF109203X blocked acute phorbol ester-stimulated Erk phosphorylation, but had no effect on the rPMT, α-thrombin, and EGF receptor-mediated signals. Similar results were obtained using Ro31–8220, a chemically distinct PKC inhibitor with a similar spectrum (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 5 B, inhibition of EGF receptor activity using the EGF receptor-specific tyrphostin AG1478 profoundly reduced rPMT, α-thrombin or EGF receptor-mediated Erk phosphorylation, with no effect on the response to phorbol ester. In contrast, treatment of cells with the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-specific tyrphostin AG1295 had no inhibitory effect (data not shown). Thus, rPMT-mediated Erk activation requires EGF receptor activity, but not the activity of classical PKC isoforms. Since rPMT-stimulated Erk activation, like rPMT-stimulated inositol phosphate hydrolysis (11.Murphy A.C. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25296-25303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and calcium-dependent chloride currents (12.Wilson B.A. Zhu X. Ho M. Lu L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1268-1275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), is sensitive to inhibitors of Gq/11 proteins, these data suggest that Gq/11-mediated EGF receptor transactivation accounts for the effects of rPMT on Erk 1/2 activity. Unlike direct PKC-mediated Erk activation (29.Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Koch W.J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17148-17153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), EGF receptor-dependent Erk activation is sensitive to dominant inhibitory mutants of mSos and Ha-Ras (30.van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Luttrell D.K. Krueger K.M. Touhara K. Porfiri E. Sakaue M. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 781-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.6, expression of the two dominant negatives, Sos-PRO and N17Ras, significantly inhibited rPMT, α-thrombin, or EGF receptor-mediated Erk phosphorylation, with no effect on the phorbol ester response. Thus rPMT-mediated Erk activation involves Gq/11-dependent EGF receptor transactivation and leads to the Ras-dependent activation of the Erk cascade. As depicted schematically in Fig.7, these events are dissociated from rPMT-mediated effects on PKC, which contribute at most a minor component to rPMT-stimulated Erk activation.Figure 7Model for the proposed mechanism of Erk 1/2 regulation by rPMT. Activation of Gq/11 proteins by either rPMT or Gq-coupled GPCRs such as the thrombin receptor results in activation of Gq/11 effectors such as phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ) isoforms as well as transactivation of the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase. Subsequent activation of the Erk cascade is mediated predominantly via RTK transactivation, with no significant contribution derived from the PLCβ-dependent activation of classical PKC activation protein kinase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Despite growing evidence that many of the cellular effects of rPMT are mediated by the activation of Gq/11 family heterotrimeric G proteins, the detailed molecular mechanism of rPMT action remains poorly understood. Like other bacterial toxins with intracellular loci of action, binding to cell surface receptors and processing through endocytic vesicles appears to be the rate-limiting step for rPMT action on intact cells. A 3–4-h delay is observed between application of rPMT to intact cells and its maximal effects on inositol phospholipid hydrolysis (9.Staddon J.M. Barker C.J. Murphy A.C. Chanter N. Lax A.J. Michell R.H. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4840-4847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), yet phospholipase Cβ-mediated inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and calcium responses occur within seconds when the toxin is directly injected into Xenopus oocytes (12.Wilson B.A. Zhu X. Ho M. Lu L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1268-1275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Unlike several bacterial toxins that modulate G protein activity, rPMT toxin lacks recognizable enzymatic activity. Microinjection of antisera directed against the amino terminus, but not the carboxyl terminus, of rPMT inhibits its biological activity in Xenopus oocytes (12.Wilson B.A. Zhu X. Ho M. Lu L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1268-1275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Although the full-length protein is required for biological activity on intact cells, the amino-terminal 500 residues of the toxin are active when microinjected (15.Wilson B.A. Ponferrada V.G. Vallance J.E. Ho M. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 80-87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This region of PMT shares modest homology with the amino-terminal half of the cytotoxic necrotizing factors 1 and 2 from enteropathogenic E. coli (31.Falbo V. Pace T. Picci E. Pizzi E. Caprioli A. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 4909-4914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Oswald E. Sugai M. Labigne A. Wu H.C. Fiorentini C. Boquet P. O'Brien A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3814-3818Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), which are thought to target Rho family small GTP-binding proteins (32.Oswald E. Sugai M. Labigne A. Wu H.C. Fiorentini C. Boquet P. O'Brien A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3814-3818Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In the Xenopus system, the effect of rPMT on calcium-dependent chloride channel activation is markedly enhanced by Gαq overexpression and specifically inhibited by microinjection of antisera against Gαq (12.Wilson B.A. Zhu X. Ho M. Lu L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1268-1275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Oocytes injected with rPMT fail to respond to a second challenge, suggesting that rPMT may bind directly to Gαq subunits and induce GTP exchange. Our results, demonstrating that cellular expression of peptide inhibitors of Gq/11 signaling block rPMT action in intact cells, are consistent with this model. The activation of Gq/11 proteins by rPMT may be sufficient to account for its mitogenic effects, as well as its effects on inositol phospholipid turnover and PKC activation. Transient expression of a constitutively active mutant of Gαq mimics the effects of rPMT, producing sustained increases in phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis and Erk activation that are blocked by peptide inhibitors of Gq/11 signaling. The mechanism of rPMT-stimulated Erk activation in HEK-293 cells parallels that employed by the predominantly Gq/11-coupled α-thrombin receptor. Both signals are independent of PKC, but dependent upon the catalytic activity of endogenous EGF receptors to activate Ras-dependent pathways. Both rPMT exposure and acute stimulation of Gq/11-coupled receptors induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple substrates. In Swiss 3T3 cells, rPMT stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK and paxillin in a cytochalasin D-sensitive manner (10.Lacerda H.M. Lax A.J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 439-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Similar results have been obtained following acute stimulation of Gq/11-coupled receptors in Swiss 3T3 (33.Rodriguez-Fernandez J.L. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27895-27901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), Rat 1 (34.Luttrell L.M. Daaka Y. Della Rocca G.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31648-31656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and HEK-293 cells (35.Della Rocca G.J. Maudsley S. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13978-13984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that rPMT also mediates growth stimulatory effects via G protein-dependent activation of EGF receptors. Indeed, previous work has demonstrated that rPMT exposure promotes the loss of cell surface EGF receptors (36.Staddon J.M. Chanter N. Lax A.J. Higgins T.E. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11841-11848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an effect that may represent EGF receptor down-regulation following rPMT-induced transactivation. Gq/11-coupled receptors have been shown to mediate two, apparently distinct, calcium-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation cascades that converge on Ras and its downstream effectors. In several cell types, GPCR-stimulated Erk activation involves the ligand-independent transactivation of receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the EGF receptor (25.Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar, 26.Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7032-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). In PC12 cells, bradykinin (37.Zwick E. Daub H Aoki N. Yamaguchi-Aoki Y. Tinhofer I. Maly K. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24767-24770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and m1 muscarinic acetylcholine (38.Tsai W. Morielli A.D. Peralta E.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4597-4605Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) receptors activate EGF receptors via either calcium- or PKC-dependent mechanisms, respectively. In vascular smooth muscle, angiotensin II mediates calcium-dependent EGF receptor transactivation upstream of the Erk cascade (39.Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsunomiya H. Motley E.D. Kawakatsu H. Owada K.M. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8890-8896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Alternatively, bradykinin-dependent Erk activation has been attributed to stimulation of the calcium-dependent FAK family kinase, Pyk2 (27.Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Mussachio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar, 28.Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Pyk2-dependent signals require either calcium or PKC (27.Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Mussachio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar) and are sensitive to cytochalasin D, suggesting a requirement for intact focal adhesions (40.Li X. Hunter D. Morris J. Haskill J.S. Earp H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9361-9364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Activated Pyk2, like p125FAK, associates with c-Src and provides docking sites for Grb2-Sos complexes (28.Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Despite similarities in their mechanisms of activation (41.Eguchi S. Iwasaki H. Inagami T. Numaguchi K. Yamakawa T. Motley E.D. Owada K.M. Marumo F. Hirata Y. Hypertension. 1999; 33: 201-206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Pyk2-mediated signals appear to be independent of those mediated via EGF receptor transactivation. In PC12 cells, expression of a dominant negative mutant of Pyk2 does not inhibit bradykinin-induced transactivation of the EGF receptor, and expression of a dominant negative EGF receptor mutant has no effect on Pyk2 phosphorylation (42.Zwick E. Wallasch C. Daub H. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20989-20996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In HEK-293 cells, treatment with tyrphostin AG1478 (35.Della Rocca G.J. Maudsley S. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13978-13984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and expression of a dominant negative mutant of Pyk2 (43.Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T. Daaka Y.

Chem. 1997; 272: 19125-19132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) each cause a partial blockade of Gq/11-coupled receptor-mediated Erk activation, suggesting that both transactivated EGF receptors and Pyk2 contribute independently to Erk activation. While we find that rPMT-stimulated Erk activation is predominantly tyrphostin-sensitive, we cannot exclude a contribution from Pyk2 acting via a focal adhesion-based scaffold. Study of the mechanisms of action of bacterial toxins has led to significant insights into the roles of heterotrimeric G proteins in cellular signaling. Our data suggest that rPMT employs Gq/11 proteins in a novel strategy for mitogenic regulation by a bacterial toxin, that of utilizing G proteins to initiate a tyrosine phosphorylation cascade leading to Ras activation. Given the potent mitogenic effects achieved by rPMT, these findings serve to underscore the importance of G protein-catalyzed mitogenic signals to growth regulation. We thank R. Lefkowitz for helpful discussion and critical reading of the manuscript. We thank D. Addison and M. Holben for excellent secretarial assistance."

Sequential extractions and pulse-chase labeling of organ cultures of embryonic chick aortae revealed rapid formation of disulfide-cross-linked aggregates containing fibrillin-1. These results demonstrated that intermolecular disulfide bond formation is an initial step in the assembly process. To identify free cysteine residues available for intermolecular cross-linking, small recombinant peptides of fibrillin-1 harboring candidate cysteine residues were analyzed. Results revealed that the first four cysteine residues in the unique N terminus form intramolecular disulfide bonds. One cysteine residue (Cys204) in the first hybrid domain of fibrillin-1 was found to occur as a free thiol and is therefore a good candidate for intermolecular disulfide bonding in initial steps of the assembly process. Furthermore, evidence indicated that the comparable cysteine residue in fibrillin-2 (Cys233) also occurs as a free thiol. These free cysteine residues in fibrillins are readily available for intermolecular disulfide bond formation, as determined by reaction with Ellman's reagent. In addition to these major results, the cleavage site of the fibrillin-1 signal peptide and the N-terminal sequence of monomeric authentic fibrillin-1 from conditioned fibroblast medium were determined.

Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 29-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, microfibrils are difficult to solubilize into their molecular components, because they are heavily cross-linked. Therefore, our current understanding of how single molecules of fibrillin are organized in microfibril polymers is based primarily upon immunolocalization studies of microfibrils, using monoclonal antibodies specific for mapped regions in the fibrillin-1 molecule (4.Reinhardt D.P.

Initial investigations suggested that microfibrils are stabilized by disulfide bonds, because extraction of tissues with disulfide-bond reducing agents resulted in loss of the ultrastructural features of microfibrils (7.Ross R.

These investigations were carried out in order to obtain biochemical evidence for intermolecular disulfide bond formation by fibrillin and to determine potential free cysteine residues in the N terminus and in the first hybrid domain. Recombinant polypeptides of fibrillin utilized for these studies are depicted in Fig. 1. More than 200 individual mutations in FBN1 are known to result in the Marfan syndrome, an autosomal dominant heritable disorder of connective tissue (12.Collod-Beroud G. Beroud C. Ades L. Black C.

A dominant negative effect of the mutant fibrillin-1 on the structure or stability of microfibrils is thought to cause the skeletal, cardiovascular, and ocular symptoms of the disease. Central to these discussions are issues related to the effect of mutant fibrillin-1 molecules on assembly of microfibrils. Are mutant fibrillin-1 molecules incorporated into microfibrils, where they may destabilize the microfibrils by rendering them more susceptible to proteolytic attack (14.Reinhardt D.P. Ono R.N.

It may be that different mutant fibrillin-1 molecules may demonstrate different fates, depending upon the location and type of mutation. In order to address these issues, molecular interactions that determine how fibrillin-1 assembles into microfibrils must be understood in more detail. Serum-free medium from normal human skin fibroblasts was collected after a 48-h incubation period. After concentration by ultrafiltration (Amicon), the medium was applied to mAb1 26 antibody affinity chromatography, and fibrillin-1 was eluted from the column with 0.1 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.5. mAb 26 is specific for fibrillin-1 (17.Keene D.R. Jordan C.D. Reinhardt D.P. Ridgway C.C. Ono R.N. Corson G.M. Fairhurst M. Sussman M.D. Memoli V.A. Sakai L.Y. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 1069-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Radioactive fibrillin-1 markers were prepared as described previously (1.Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Engvall E. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). The embryos of White Leghorn chickens were subjected to 5 mg of β-aminopropionitrile in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, injected into the air sack on day 14. Embryos were sacrificed on day 17, and aortae were dissected and placed either in liquid N2 or in organ culture medium (see below). Aortae were extracted sequentially with the following reagents: (i) PBS, (ii) 1 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, (iii) 8 m urea in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (twice), and (iv) 50 mm dithioerythritol (DTE) in 8m urea/50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. All extractions were performed at 4 °C with the following protease inhibitors present: 0.001 m N-ethylmaleimide, 0.004m EDTA, and 0.001 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Tissue was dissociated in extraction buffers with a Brinkmann polytron. Then, extracts were centrifuged at 4 °C for 1 h at 14,000 rpm in a Sorvall RC-5B centrifuge, and supernatants were stored at −90 °C. Pellets were then extracted with the next buffer, using the polytron, and centrifuged. The second 8 m urea extraction went overnight at 4 °C. All chemicals were from Sigma. Aortae from batches of 50–60 embryos at a time were dissected and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, without cysteine (sometimes without methionine as well), in a shaking water bath at 37 °C. In preliminary experiments, they were radioactively labeled with medium containing 50 μCi/ml [35S]cysteine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 50 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In subsequent experiments, [14C]cysteine (NEN Life Science Products) was used at a concentration of 1–5 μCi/ml of medium. The medium was also supplemented with 0.02 m HEPES and penicillin-streptomycin (50 μg/ml and 50 units/ml, respectively) (Life Technologies, Inc.). The aortae were then chased with medium containing cysteine (and methionine) and extracted as above. The medium usually contained 64 μg/ml β-aminopropionitrile, unless otherwise specified. For each experiment, equal numbers of aortae were removed at specified time points and immediately frozen in liquid N2. For immunoaffinity purification of fibrillin present in the 8m urea extracts, the extracts were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 m NaCl and 2 m urea, at 4 °C overnight. Almost all of the material remained in solution after dialysis. Before application to mAb 201/Sepharose, the samples were diluted with cold PBS to a urea concentration of 0.5 m. After extensive washing of the column with PBS-0.05% Tween 20, the column was eluted with 0.1m glycine-HCl, pH 2.5. Fractions were collected, and radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. A recombinant fibrillin-1 expression construct rF24, coding for Met1 to Ile489 and an additional 60 bp 5′ to the proposed start codon, was prepared using expression construct rF23 (18.Reinhardt D.P.

To replace the BM-40 signal peptide in rF23 with the sequence for the putative fibrillin-1 signal peptide, a 1441-bpNheI-NotI fragment from pCEPSP-rF23H was fused with the NheI-NotI restricted pCEP4 vector (Invitrogen), which does not contain a sequence for a signal peptide. The resulting plasmid was designated pCEP-rF23H. To add the coding sequence for the putative fibrillin-1 signal peptide and 60 preceding bp, clone HFBN29 (9.Corson G.M. Chalberg S.C. Dietz H.C. Charbonneau N.L. Sakai L.Y. Genomics. 1993; 17: 476-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) was amplified using primer DR62 (5′-ATAGTTTAGCGGCCGCTAGCCGCAGACCGAGCCCCGGG-3′), which introduced aNotI and a NheI restriction site at the 5′ end, and primer N1911AS (5′-AATTTCCTCCCTGACAGAGCCC-3′). A 134-bpNotI-NcoI fragment was subcloned into theNotI-NcoI restricted pBS-HFBN23/29 (4.Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Gambee J.E. Pöschl E. Sakai L.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 104-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and the 1478-bp NheI-AgeI fragment was then ligated with the NheI-AgeI restricted pCEP-rF23H. The resulting expression plasmid was designated pCEP-rF24H. To make expression construct rF38, coding for Ser115 to Glu287, clone HFBN29 was amplified with sense primer DR90 (5′-CGTAGCTAGCATCCATACAACACTGCAATATTCG-3′), introducing aNheI restriction site at the 5′ end, and antisense primer DR91 (5′-ACCGCTCGAGCTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGTTCACATTTTTGTGACACTTC-3′), introducing the sequence for 6 histidine residues, a stop codon, and aXhoI restriction site at the 3′ end. The 547-bpNheI-XhoI fragment was then subcloned in pCEP4/γIII4 (19.Mayer U. Pöschl E. Gerecke D.R. Wagman D.W. Burgeson R.E. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid was designated pCEPSP-rF38. Transfection of 293/EBNA cells (Invitrogen) and selection of clones was performed as described previously (4.Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Gambee J.E. Pöschl E. Sakai L.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 104-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Purification of rF24 and rF38 by chelating chromatography was as described for construct rF20 (4.Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Gambee J.E. Pöschl E. Sakai L.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 104-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Alternatively, rF24 was purified by affinity chromatography with mAb 26 as described for recombinant fragment rF11 (4.Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Gambee J.E. Pöschl E. Sakai L.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 104-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Expression and purification of the fibrillin-1 recombinant fragment rF31 and the fibrillin-2 fragments rF33 and rF37 were described previously (17.Keene D.R. Jordan C.D. Reinhardt D.P. Ridgway C.C. Ono R.N. Corson G.M. Fairhurst M. Sussman M.D. Memoli V.A. Sakai L.Y. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 1069-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Analysis of the secreted fraction of recombinant rF24 compared with the fraction retained within the cells was performed by Western blot analysis. 8 ml of serum-free medium (48-h incubation time) from a confluent 100-mm cell culture dish was harvested. The cell layer was then washed two times with PBS and solubilized in 0.2 ml of SDS sample buffer. 1 ml of TCA-precipitated culture medium and 0.03 ml of the cell fraction were then analyzed under nonreducing conditions with mAb 26 (∼10 μg/ml) and goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad; 1:800 dilution). Controls included nontransfected 293/EBNA cells and conditioned medium from these cells. Electroblotted recombinant peptides were analyzed on an automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems) using Edman degradation. To determine free cysteine residues in rF24 and rF38, the polypeptides were solubilized in 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 6 m guanidine, 2 mm EDTA and derivatized with a 10-fold molar excess (over cysteine residues) of iodoacetamide under N2 at 37 °C for 30 min in the dark. The polypeptides were desalted by reverse-phase chromatography (C18, Vydac 218TP52), lyophilized, and reduced with a 10-fold molar excess (over cysteine residues) of dithiothreitol under N2 at 37 °C for 2 h in the dark. The fragments were then derivatized with a 4-fold molar excess (over dithiothreitol) of 4-vinylpyridine at 25 °C for 90 min in the dark. The reduced and alkylated peptides were then again desalted by C18 reverse-phase chromatography and either submitted directly to Edman degradation (rF24) or digested with endoproteinase Glu-C (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (rF38) in 25 mmammonium acetate, pH 4.0, at 25 °C for 24 h. Endo-Glu-C peptides of rF38 were separated by C18 reverse-phase chromatography and then analyzed by Edman degradation. N-terminal sequences of rF24 or proteolytic peptides of rF38 were determined by automated protein sequencing (Hewlett Packard G1000S). Free cysteine residues were identified as amidomethyl cysteine, and disulfide-bonded cysteine residues were identified as pyridylethyl cysteines. To determine whether free cysteines are located on the surface of molecules, recombinant polypeptides of fibrillin-1 (rF31 and rF38) and fibrillin-2 (rF33 and rF37) were derivatized with 5,5-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoate) (DTNB) (Ellman's reagent; Fluka). The reaction was carried out in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 1.875 mm DTNB in the presence or absence of 6 mguanidine-HCl at 20 °C. Recombinant polypeptides were added to freshly prepared reaction buffer at final concentrations of 10.1 (rF31), 14.5 (rF33), 12.0 (rF37), and 9.3 μm (rF38). Because the concentration of DTNB is much higher (130–200-fold) than the concentration of free cysteine residues, the reaction can be considered of pseudo-first order: protein-S− + DTNB → protein-S-D + TNB−. The absorbance (at 412 nm) was measured over time (25 min). The concentration of free cysteine residues was equivalent to the concentration of TNB−, calculated from the molar extinction coefficient of the TNB−, ε = 13,600 m (20.Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21232) Google Scholar). The following equation was used for curve fitting: [TNB−] = [protein-SH]0 × (1 −e − kt), where [TNB−] = concentration of the TNB anion, [protein-SH]0 = concentration (m) of free thiols in the protein at time 0,t = time (min), and k = rate constant of the reaction (min−1). Previous identification and characterization of native fibrillin-1 was accomplished using monoclonal antibodies specific for fibrillin-1 (1.Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Engvall E. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar, 5.Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Glanville R.W. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol.

J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 1069-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Direct evidence that immunoisolated molecules synthesized and secreted by human fibroblasts are fibrillin-1 monomers has been obtained by N-terminal sequence analysis (data not shown). The authentic fibrillin-1 N terminus (45RGGGG(H)DALKGPNVXG) begins after a furin-type cleavage site in profibrillin-1 (41RAKR), which was predicted to be utilized in studies employing recombinant fibrillin-1 polypeptides (4.Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Gambee J.E. Pöschl E. Sakai L.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 104-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In contrast to monomeric molecules, which can be obtained from the medium of cells in culture, the tissue form of fibrillin-1 is polymeric. After fibrillin-1 assembles into a microfibril, it is cross-linked and is very difficult to solubilize. In order to determine initial steps in the process by which fibrillin-1 becomes cross-linked and insoluble, pulse-chase and extraction studies were performed using radiolabeled organ cultures of aortae. 2A version of these organ culture studies was previously published as unreviewed proceedings of a meeting (21.Sakai L.Y. Tamburro A. Davidson J. Elastin: Chemical and Biological Aspects. Congedo Editore, Galatina, Italy1990: 213-227Google Scholar). Fig. 2 demonstrates that newly synthesized radiolabeled fibrillin can be extracted sequentially from the tissue, using progressively harsher denaturing conditions. A soluble pool containing fibrillin can be removed using PBS (Fig. 2,lane 2). Even after a 1 m NaCl extraction (lane 3), a pool that can only be solubilized with 8m urea remains (lane 4). After a second extraction with 8 m urea (lane 5), an insoluble pool can be selectively extracted with disulfide-bond reducing agents (lane 6). The band labeled as fibrillin (Fb) was confirmed by immunoblotting (data not shown). After exhaustive prior extraction, chick aortae contained one major [14C]cysteine-labeled band, fibrillin, which could be extracted with DTE. Pulse-chase experiments were conducted in order to determine whether the formation of intermolecular disulfide cross-links enables fibrillin to become increasingly insoluble with time. Fig.3 shows the results of one representative pulse-chase experiment. Organ cultures of aortae were pulsed for 30 min and chased for 0–19 h. Aortae from each chase time point were extracted sequentially with PBS, 1 m NaCl, 8 murea, 8 m urea, and 50 mm DTE. After 30 min of labeling (0 h chase), newly synthesized fibrillin was present in the PBS and 8 m urea extracts (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and5) but was not present in the DTE extract (lane 13). After 1 h of chase, fibrillin was found in all extracts (lanes 2, 6, and 10), including the DTE extract (lane 14). After 3 h of chase, fibrillin was decreased in the PBS (lane 3) and 8 m urea (lanes 7 and 11) extracts and increased in the DTE extract (lane 15). After 19 h, the PBS extract no longer contained appreciable amounts of fibrillin (lane 4), and 8m urea extracts contained smaller amounts of fibrillin (lanes 8 and 12) than at 1 and 3 h of chase. Most of the radioactively labeled fibrillin present at 19 h of chase was resistant to prior extractions and was solubilized by DTE (lane 16: compare this lane with lanes 4, 8, and12). Because the 1 m NaCl extracts contained very little fibrillin, they are not shown here. Electrophoresis and molecular sieve chromatography demonstrated that PBS extracts of aortae after 0–4 h of chase contained monomers, not multimers, whereas 8 m urea extracts of aortae after 4 h of chase contained multimers and small amounts of monomer (data not shown). The 8 m urea extract of pulsed (1 h) and chased (4 h) aortae was diluted with PBS and applied to an antibody affinity column. Most of the fibrillin, eluted from the column, failed to enter the stacking gel when the sample was run without reducing agent (Fig.4 a, lane 1). A small amount of fibrillin monomer was present (arrow). When the sample was reduced (Fig. 4 a, lane 2), the immunoisolated material was composed primarily of fibrillin and additional species, which might represent nonreducibly cross-linked fibrillin molecules, degradation products of microfibrils, or contaminants of the immunoprecipitation (including potential fibrillin-binding proteins). When this immunoisolated fibrillin aggregate was run on a 1.5% agarose gel and compared with mouse type IV procollagen markers, the minimum molecular mass calculated for the fibrillin aggregate was greater than 8 million Da (Fig. 4 b). Fibrillin-1 is composed of 282 cysteine residues in 47 epidermal growth factor-like repeats, 56 cysteine residues in seven 8-cysteine repeats, 17 cysteine residues in two hybrid repeats, 4 cysteine residues in the N terminus, and 2 cysteine residues in the C terminus (9.Corson G.M. Chalberg S.C. Dietz H.C. Charbonneau N.L. Sakai L.Y. Genomics. 1993; 17: 476-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Two recombinant polypeptides, rF24 and rF38 (Fig. 1), were produced in order to examine the cysteine residues present in the N terminus and in the first hybrid repeat, which contains nine cysteine residues. Sufficient quantities of a C-terminal recombinant polypeptide, rF8 (22.Lönnqvist L. Reinhardt D. Sakai L. Peltonen L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 2039-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), could not be produced for these studies. For rF24, stably transfected 293/EBNA cells and serum-free medium were analyzed by Western blotting with mAb 26, specific for fibrillin-1 (17.Keene D.R. Jordan C.D. Reinhardt D.P. Ridgway C.C. Ono R.N. Corson G.M. Fairhurst M. Sussman M.D. Memoli V.A. Sakai L.Y. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 1069-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The majority (>95%) of the 50-kDa rF24 polypeptide was secreted into the medium, demonstrating that the putative signal sequence starting at Met1 (10.Pereira L. D'Alessio M. Ramirez F. Lynch J.R. Sykes B. Pangilinan T. Bonadio J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 961-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) is functional (data not shown). Immunoblotting and affinity chromatography with mAb 26 indicated correct folding of rF24, because binding of mAb 26 to fibrillin-1 relies on proper formation of disulfide bonds (4.Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Gambee J.E. Pöschl E. Sakai L.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 104-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). rF24 was purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography on mAb 26 (Fig.5). Edman degradation of the major band resulted in two N-terminal sequences, 25ADANLEAGNVKE and45RGGGGHDALKGP, in approximately equal amounts. This demonstrates that the fibrillin-1 signal sequence is cleaved between Gly24 and Ala25 and that rF24 is also processed, like authentic fibrillin-1, after the furin-type cleavage sequence. Edman degradation of the minor band gave a single fibrillin-1 sequence, 115SIQHXNIRXMNG. This sequence begins after the first epidermal growth factor-like repeat in fibrillin-1, indicating a protease-sensitive site. rF24 was used to determine the free sulfhydryls in the unique N-terminal end. To determine free sulfhydryls in the first hybrid motif, a smaller recombinant fragment, rF38, was used. SDS-PAGE of purified rF38 demonstrated the expected molecular mass of 20 kDa and a reducible dimer of 40 kDa (Fig.6).Figure 6Characterization of purified recombinant polypeptide rF38 by SDS gel electrophoresis. Purified rF38 was analyzed either nonreduced (NR) or after reduction with 20 mm dithiothreitol (R). Note that the nonreduced material contains reducible dimers of 40 kDa. The monomer has an apparent molecular mass of 20 kDa. The positions of globular marker proteins are indicated at the left in kDa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) rF24 and rF38 were alkylated by iodoacetamide and then reduced and again alkylated with 4-vinylpyridine, resulting in amidomethyl cysteine residues for free sulfhydryl groups and pyridylethyl cysteine if the cysteine residue was originally involved in a disulfide bond. To promote accessibility to the alkylating agents, these reactions were performed in the presence of 6 m guanidine. All four cysteine residues of the unique N-terminal domain were modified with 4-vinylpyridine, demonstrating that they all were involved in disulfide bonds. Only the third cysteine (Cys204) in the first hybrid repeat was modified with iodoacetamide, whereas the other 8 cysteine residues within this motif were modified with 4-vinylpyridine. This demonstrates that Cys204, the nonconserved cysteine within this motif (Table I), occurs as a free thiol in rF38.Table I⇓FIB-1 hybrid 1:RDYRTGP CFTVISNQMCQGQLSGIVCTKTL CCATVGRAWGHP CEMCPAQPHPCRRGFIPNIRTGACQFIB-2 hybrid 1:RDYRTGP CFTQVNNQMCQGQLTGIVCTKTL CCATTGRAWGHP CEMCPAQPQPCRRGFIPNIRTGACQFIB-1 hybrid 2:ETIKGT CWQTVIDGRCEININGATLKSQ CCSSLGAAWGSP CTLCQVDPICGKGYSRIKGTQCEFIB-2 hybrid 2:DSLKGT CWLNIQDSRCEVNINGATLKSE CCATLGAAWGSP CERCELDTACPRGLARIKGVTCELTBP-1:KTQLGR CFQETIGSQCGKALPGLSKQED CCGTVGTSWGFNK CQKCPKKPSYHGYNQMMECLPGYKRVNNTFCQLTBP-2:RGLLGR CYLNTVNGQCANPLLELTTQED CCGSVGAFWGVTL CAPCPPRPASPVIENGQLECPQGYKRLNLTHCQLTBP-3:LGRF CFQDTLPKQPCGSNPLPGLTKQED CCGSIGTAWGQSK CHKCPQLQYTGVQKPVPVRGEVGADCPQGYKRLNSTHCQLTBP-4:SGFGY CFRELRGGECASPLPGLRTQEV CCRGAGLAWGVHD CQLCSERLGNSERVSAPDGPCPTGFERVNGSCE Open table in a new tab In order to determine whether the free cysteine residue is located on the surface of molecules and readily available for intermolecular disulfide bond formation, the fibrillin-1 recombinant fragments rF31 and rF38 and the fibrillin-2 recombinant fragments rF33 and rF37 were reacted with 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoate) either in a physiological buffer (TBS) or in a denaturing buffer (6 m guanidine). For rF38, virtually identical total numbers of free cysteine residues per molecule protein were observed in TBS buffer (0.93 ± 0.003 S.D.) and in guanidine buffer (0.91 ± 0.002 S.D.) (Fig.7 a), demonstrating that the free cysteine residue is exposed at the surface of the molecule. The reaction was somewhat faster in guanidine buffer (rate constant ofk = 1.34 ± 0.01 S.D.) compared with the reaction in physiological buffer (k = 0.33 ± 0.005 S.D.), indicating that the free cysteine residue is somewhat more favorably available to DTNB under denaturing conditions. Similar results were obtained for the fibrillin-2 recombinant fragment rF37. In TBS buffer, 0.81 ± 0.007 S.D. free cysteine residues per molecule were obtained, compared with 0.94 ± 0.002 S.D. in guanidine buffer (Fig. 7 b). The control polypeptides rF31 and rF33 displayed no evidence of free cysteine residues. Here, evidence is presented that indicates that intermolecular disulfide bond formation is the first step in fibrillin multimerization and microfibril assembly. In organ-cultured tissues, pulse-chase experiments demonstrate that intermolecular disulfide bond formation occurs within the first few hours after synthesis and secretion of the monomeric fibrillin molecule. Data presented here show that formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds coincides with progressive resistance of fibrillin to extraction. Selective final extraction with a reducing agent suggests that fibrillin is the only cysteine-rich high molecular weight microfibrillar component that is cross-linked and stabilized in this manner (Fig. 2). Recombinant fibrillin polypeptides were produced in order to determine the location and number of free cysteine residues that could potentially be involved in the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds. Using an approach that previously resulted in properly folded and well characterized recombinant fibrillin polypeptides (4.Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Gambee J.E. Pöschl E. Sakai L.Y. J.

Sequence analysis demonstrated that all four cysteine residues present in the fibrillin-1 N terminus were held in intrachain disulfide bonds. Because these four cysteine residues are conserved in the N-terminal region of fibrillin-2, it is likely that they also form intrachain disulfide bonds in fibrillin-2. A single cysteine residue was free in rF38 and was identified as the nonconserved cysteine residue (Cys204) present in the first hybrid domain of fibrillin-1. Evidence was presented to demonstrate that this free cysteine residue is available on the surface of the molecule for intermolecular disulfide bond formation. In addition, reaction with Ellman's reagent suggested that a large recombinant polypeptide of fibrillin-2, rF37, contained one free cysteine residue, whereas control fragments, rF31 (fibrillin-1) and rF33 (fibrillin-2), which are composed of all major types of domains present in fibrillins, did not react with DTNB. By comparison with results obtained for rF38 and with sequence homologies (Table I), it is likely that the free cysteine residue present in rF37 is the nonconserved cysteine residue present in the first hybrid domain. The family of latent transforming growth factor-β-binding proteins (LTBP-1, -2, -3, and -4) (23.Kanzaki T. Olofsson A. Moren A. Wernstedt C. Hellman U. Miyazono K. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.H.

LTBP-1 has been immunolocalized to microfibrils (27.Taipale J. Saharinen J. Hedman K. Keski-Oja J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 875-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 28.Nakajima Y.

The LTBPs are composed of the same domains present in fibrillins, including one hybrid domain. However, the single hybrid domain in LTBPs, like the second hybrid domain in fibrillins, does not contain the extra cysteine residue (Table I). Sequence analysis of rF24 allowed the determination of the fibrillin-1 signal peptide cleavage site, just before the sequence25ADANLEAGNVKE. This finding agrees with recently published results using recombinant fibrillin-1 fragments expressed in an alternative expression system (30.Ritty T.M. Broekelmann T. Tisdale C. Milewicz D.M. Mecham R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8933-8940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition, utilization of a processing site after a consensus furin-type cleavage signal was demonstrated by N-terminal sequence analysis of rF24 as well as authentic fibrillin-1 from fibroblast medium. In summary, the data presented suggest that the initial steps in the polymerization and stabilization of fibrillin-1 monomers into microfibrils involves the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds. These intermolecular disulfide bonds may cross-link fibrillin monomers to other cross-linked fibrillin molecules or to high molecular weight undetermined species (Fig. 4 a, lane 2). The nonconserved cysteine (Cys204) present in the first hybrid domain is an available site for the formation of these important intermolecular disulfide bonds. Noe L.

In the presence of ATP and magnesium, hMutSα dissociates from the mismatch by following the DNA contour in the form of a sliding clamp. This process is enabled by a conformational change of the heterodimer, which is driven by the binding of ATP and magnesium in the Walker type A and B motifs of the polypeptides, respectively. We show that a purified recombinant hMutSα variant, hMutSα 6DV, which contains an aspartate to valine substitution in the Walker type B motif of the hMSH6 subunit, fails to undergo the conformational change compatible with translocation.

ATP binding motifs have been characterized in a number of proteins of different function. Of the four conserved sequences identified (1.Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), the so-called Walker type A and B motifs, with consensus amino acid sequences (hydrophobic stretch (G/AXXXXGKS/T) and hydrophobic stretch (D(E/D)), respectively) are the most highly conserved. High resolution crystal structures of two members of this class of proteins, Ha-Ras (2.Pai E.F. Kabsch W. Krengel U. Holmes K.C. John J. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1989; 341: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar) and HisP (3.Hung L.W. Wang I.X. Nikaido K. Liu P.Q. Ames G.F. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 396: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar), revealed that the amino acid residues of the type A motif are involved in forming specific hydrogen bonds with the β- and γ-phosphates of the bound nucleotide; that is why this motif is often referred to as the phosphate-binding or P-loop. The absolutely conserved aspartate of motif B is thought to be part of the catalytic site of these enzymes. In the Ha-Ras structure (2.Pai E.F. Kabsch W. Krengel U. Holmes K.C. John J. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1989; 341: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), this amino acid was shown to be coordinated to a magnesium ion bound by the β- and the γ-phosphate groups of the triphosphate, activating thus the latter group toward attack by a water molecule. The proposal that this conserved amino acid residue plays a key role in nucleotide triphosphate catalysis is supported also by biochemical studies of the translocation ATPase SecA (4.van der Wolk J.P.

Mismatch binding polypeptides, homologues of the E. coliMutS protein, are important members of this superfamily of ATPases (7.Eisen J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4291-4300Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), but the mechanistic role of their ATP-driven motor in mismatch correction is unclear. First evidence showing that nucleotide binding could influence the function of the MutS homologues came from experiments using synthetic oligonucleotides, where the mismatch binding factors from several species could be shown to dissociate from the mismatch-containing substrates in the presence of ATP (8.Hughes M.J. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23876-23882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Iaccarino I. Palombo F. Drummond J. Totty N.F. Hsuan J.J. Modrich P. Jiricny J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 484-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This biochemical feature is shared by all the functional MutS homologues examined to date, but its proposed physiological role was, until recently, based largely on our knowledge of the mismatch repair process in E. coli, which is initiated by the binding of the homodimeric MutS protein to the mismatch (10.Su S.S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5057-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 11.Jiricny J. Su S.S. Wood S.G. Modrich P.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2707-2715Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and where ATP hydrolysis is supposed to drive the formation of the so-called α-loop, which is generated by threading the DNA bidirectionally through MutS. This process was visualized in electron microscopic studies (13.Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), where it was also noted that the MutS homodimer released the mismatch during this step such that it was located predominantly in the loop. Intriguingly, this implied that ATP binding and/or hydrolysis made the MutS homodimer lose its affinity for the bound mispair, whereas its affinity for homoduplex DNA increased. Recent studies from several laboratories showed that similar transactions take place also in eukaryotic systems (14.Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R.

Biol. 1998; 18: 7590-7601Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), where the MutS homologues function in the form of heterodimers. The most abundant mismatch binding factor in human cells is hMutSα, a heterodimer of the MutS homologues hMSH2 and hMSH6 (19.Palombo F. Gallinari P. Iaccarino I. Lettieri T. Hughes M. D'Arrigo A. Truong O. Hsuan J.J. Jiricny J. Science. 1995; 268: 1912-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 20.Drummond J.T. Li G.M. Longley M.J. Modrich P. Science. 1995; 268: 1909-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). In an earlier study, we substituted the highly conserved lysine residues in the Walker type A motifs of these two polypeptides with arginine, such that the mutant proteins were no longer able to bind the triphosphate. Examination of the ATPase and mismatch binding characteristics of the recombinant wild type and mutant hMutSα factors (15.Iaccarino I. Marra G. Palombo F. Jiricny J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2677-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) revealed that the dissociation of hMutSα from oligonucleotide heteroduplexes required solely ATP binding, not hydrolysis. This was independently confirmed by Gradia et al. (14.Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). We could further show that a hMutSα variant, in which the ATP binding sites of both hMSH2 and hMSH6 were mutated, could bind normally to mismatched substrates, but was not displaced from the G/T mismatch-containing 34-mer oligonucleotide substrate even in the presence of 10 mmATP. Unlike the wild type heterodimer, this hMutSα variant was unable to complement mismatch repair deficient extracts of cells lacking hMutSα. On the contrary, it inhibited the repair efficiency of a fully repair proficient HeLa cell extract, presumably by remaining bound at the mismatch site and denying thus access to the other components of the mismatch repair machinery. Although the above results implied that the ATP-dependent translocation of hMutSα from the mismatch is required in the mismatch repair process, they failed to provide us with a mechanistic insight into the ATP-driven molecular transactions that take place upon mismatch binding. This came later, in the form of experiments that demonstrated that following mismatch recognition, binding of ATP and magnesium induces a conformational change in hMutSα, which allows it to travel along the contour of the DNA molecule in the form of a sliding clamp (16.Blackwell L.J. Martik D. Bjornson K.P. Bjornson E.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32055-32062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 17.Gradia S. Subramanian D. Wilson T. Acharya S. Makhov A. Griffith J. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 255-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). One model suggests that the released heterodimer then form a looped structure analogous to that seen with MutS (13.Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), a process which requires the energy of ATP hydrolysis (16.Blackwell L.J. Martik D. Bjornson K.P. Bjornson E.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32055-32062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The other model presented hMutSα as a molecular switch, where mismatch recognition by the ADP-bound hMutSα induces a rapid ADP → ATP exchange. This event was proposed to bring about the conversion of the heterodimer into a sliding clamp, which then diffuses along the DNA without ATP hydrolysis. Instead, hydrolysis of the nucleotide was suggested to be required in the recycling of the mismatch binding proficient, ADP-bound form of hMutSα (17.Gradia S. Subramanian D. Wilson T. Acharya S. Makhov A. Griffith J. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 255-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Whereas the role of ATP hydrolysis in the translocation process is still open to question, both models predict that if hMutSα is to leave the mispair upon ATP binding and/or hydrolysis, it would be expected to change its conformation. Using partial proteolysis, conformational changes induced by nucleotide binding to the recombinant human (17.Gradia S. Subramanian D. Wilson T. Acharya S. Makhov A. Griffith J. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 255-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) and yeast (18.Studamire B. Quach T. Alani E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7590-7601Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) MutSα were indeed observed. We now extend these findings to show that ATP binding to the human heterodimer does indeed cause a dramatic intramolecular change of conformation, but that this change is different in the presence and in the absence of magnesium. These data explain why hMutSα variants unable to bind ATP and those incapable of coordinating magnesium are phenotypically similar, even though the underlying causes of their mismatch repair defects are mechanistically very different. A PCR1-based site-directed mutagenesis approach was used to change the conserved aspartic acid in position 1213 of hMSH6 to valine. The substitution was obtained by PCR overlap extension mutagenesis, using the following primers: X1, 5′-GGTGCTTGTGGTTGAATTAGGAAG-3′; X2, 5′-CTTCCTAATTCAACCACAAGCACC-3′; 160.27, 5′-CGGCCTCGAGTAATTCCTTAATCAAAGTC-3′; and 160.28, 5′-CTGTTGCCGGAAGATAC-3′. The PCR fragments obtained with X1/160.27 and X2/160.28 were used as templates in a second PCR step, using 160.27/160.28 primers. The final PCR product was cloned between theAccI/AvrII sites of hMSH6/BluescriptSK (15.Iaccarino I. Marra G. Palombo F. Jiricny J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2677-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). After sequencing, the hMSH6 cDNA carrying the D1213V mutation was cloned between the BamHI/XhoI sites of pFastBacI (Life Technologies, Inc.) to generate clone pFastBac/hMSH6-D1213V. The recombinant baculovirus was obtained using the Bac-To-Bac system according to the manufacturer's (Life Technologies, Inc.) instructions. The mutant hMutSα heterodimer carrying a D1213V mutation in hMSH6 (hMutSα 6DV) was purified as described previously (15.Iaccarino I. Marra G. Palombo F. Jiricny J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2677-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Briefly,Spodoptera frugiperda 9 (Sf9) cells (typically 1.2 × 108) were coinfected with a mixture of the recombinant baculoviruses hMSH6-D1213V and hMSH2, at a multiplicity of infection of 10. After 72 h, the cells were collected and total extracts were prepared as described (21.Jiricny J. Hughes M. Corman N. Rudkin B.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8860-8864Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The extracts were sedimented at 36,000 × g, and the supernatant was then diluted to a conductivity corresponding to that of 0.25 m NaCl with buffer A (25 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and loaded onto a 5-ml Hi-Trap heparin-Sepharose fast protein liquid chromatography column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The protein complex was eluted with a 45 ml linear gradient from 25 to 100% buffer B (25 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.6, 1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mmβ-mercaptoethanol). The fractions containing hMutSα heterodimer (eluting at around 40% buffer B) were pooled, diluted with buffer A to a conductivity corresponding to 15% salt, and loaded onto a 1-ml Resource Q fast protein liquid chromatography column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The fractions containing the pure hMutSα complex were pooled, dialyzed extensively against buffer A containing 0.11m NaCl, 10% sucrose, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (storage buffer), and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. The purity of the recombinant heterodimer preparations was judged by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE to be in excess of 95%. The band-shift assays were performed essentially as described (21.Jiricny J. Hughes M. Corman N. Rudkin B.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8860-8864Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar); the protein (50 ng, 192 fmol) was incubated with the labeled oligonucleotide substrates (40 fmol) in a 20-μl total volume containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. After 20-min incubation at room temperature, 5 μl of each sample were loaded on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel run in TAE buffer, pH 7.5. The biotinylated substrate Gbio/Tbio was constructed by annealing the synthetic 34-mer oligonucleotide 5′-AGCTTGGCTGCAGGTTGACGGATCCCCGGGAATT-3′ with the complementary strand 5′-AATTCCCGGGGATCCGTCGACCTGCAGCCAAGCT-3′, both 3′-biotinylated (Microsynth) and labeled at their 5′-ends with32P. In the ATP displacement experiments (Fig.2 B), 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 200, and 500 μm ATP was added to the mixtures at the beginning of the incubation time. The relative amounts of the shifted and free probes were quantified using a Storm phosphorimager. In the experiments presented in Fig. 3, the substrate Gbio/Tbio was first preincubated for 5 min in the reaction mixture with 200 ng of streptavidin (Calbiochem). Where indicated, 0.5 mm ATP and/or 2 mm MgCl2 were added at the beginning of the incubation time.Figure 3Wild type hMutSα, but not hMutSα 6DV, is an ATP and magnesium dependent sliding clamp. Incubation of the radiolabeled G/T oligonucleotide heteroduplex with the recombinant hMutSα variants yielded the shifted complexes, which dissociated in the presence of ATP without or with magnesium (lanes 1–3). Blocking one or both ends of the probe with streptavidin generated mono- and di-modified species of slower mobility (lanes 4–6). Incubation of the streptavidin-blocked probes with the hMutSα variants yielded the expected specific complexes (lanes 4; the complex of hMutSα with the mono-modified probe appears as the weak, second slowest migrating band that is not marked in the center panel). Treatment of these species with ATP in the absence of magnesium resulted in the direct dissociation of the proteins from the DNA in both cases. In contrast, whereas the wild type hMutSα remained bound on doubly streptavidinylated DNA in the presence of added magnesium and ATP, the hMutSα 6DV variant dissociated (lanes 6). The composition of the individual bands is graphically represented in the center panel. Streptavidin is represented by ovals and hMutSα variants by circles.

At selected time points, 2-μl aliquots were removed, the reaction was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of formamide dye and loaded onto a 20% sequencing gel as described previously (8.Hughes M.J. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23876-23882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the calculation of the Michaelis-Menten constants, the activities were measured in the presence of 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 10, and 20 μm ATP. The ability of the recombinant proteins to complement cytoplasmic extracts of HeLa and HCT15 cells in a mismatch repair assay was tested as described previously (15.Iaccarino I. Marra G. Palombo F. Jiricny J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2677-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 22.Thomas D.C. Roberts J.D. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3744-3751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Typically, 1 μg (3.85 pmol) of the recombinant protein was digested with 300 ng of V8/Endoproteinase Gluc-C (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 25 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 8.0, for 30 min at 25 °C. Where indicated (Fig. 4), the reactions were supplemented with either metal chlorides (2 mm), nucleotides (0.5 mm), or with a 34-mer oligonucleotide heteroduplex (10 pmol), containing a single G/T mismatch (21.Jiricny J. Hughes M. Corman N. Rudkin B.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8860-8864Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The reactions were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 6 × SDS sample dye followed by heating at 100 °C for 5 min, and aliquots were loaded on two 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After blotting on nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, the filters were stained with polyclonal antibodies against hMSH2 or hMSH6 (19.Palombo F. Gallinari P. Iaccarino I. Lettieri T. Hughes M. D'Arrigo A. Truong O. Hsuan J.J. Jiricny J. Science. 1995; 268: 1912-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) and developed using either the colorimetric or ECL methods. In our previous study, we mutated the conserved lysine 675 of hMSH2 and lysine 1140 of hMSH6 of the Walker type A motif to arginine (15.Iaccarino I. Marra G. Palombo F. Jiricny J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2677-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Although neither mutant protein, hMSH2 K675R or hMSH6 K1140R, could bind ATP, the phenotypes of the respective recombinant variants hMutSα 2KR and hMutSα 6KR containing these mutant subunits were very different. Thus, whereas hMutSα 2KR behaved similarly to wild type, the hMSH6 K1140R mutation brought about a decrease of the total ATPase activity of the hMutSα 6KR heterodimer comparable with that observed in the double mutant, hMutSα 2,6KR, where both hMSH2 and hMSH6 ATP binding sites were mutated. This implied that the ATPase activity of hMSH6 is dominant within hMutSα. Correspondingly, the hMutSα 6KR variant was severely defective in mismatch correction (15.Iaccarino I. Marra G. Palombo F. Jiricny J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2677-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This contrasted with the effect of ATP (in the absence of magnesium) on the stability of the hMutSα 2KR and hMutSα 6KR protein-DNA complexes, as both the heterodimers dissociated from mismatch containing oligonucleotide duplexes at similar ATP concentrations in band-shift assays. These differences suggested that whereas ATP binding in at least one subunit of the heterodimer is sufficient to bring about its dissociation from the oligonucleotide substrate, ATP hydrolysis is required in the repair process. To study this phenomenon further, we mutated hMutSα by changing the conserved aspartate 1213 of the hMSH6 subunit to valine (Fig.1). The rationale for selecting this particular site was the following. (i) The D1213V mutation was identified in one allele of the hMSH6 gene in a mismatch repair-deficient human lymphoblastoid cell line MT1 (23.Papadopoulos N. Nicolaides N.C. Liu B. Parsons R. Lengauer C. Palombo F. D'Arrigo A. Markowitz S. Willson J.K. Kinzler K.W. Jiricny J. Vogelstein B. Science. 1995; 268: 1915-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). (ii) The aspartate in question has been shown to be involved in coordinating the divalent metal ion in the catalytic site of GTPases with Walker A and B motifs that are highly homologous to those of hMSH2 and hMSH6 (2.Pai E.F. Kabsch W. Krengel U. Holmes K.C. John J. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1989; 341: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 3.Hung L.W. Wang I.X. Nikaido K. Liu P.Q. Ames G.F. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 396: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). (iii) The ATPase of hMSH6 contributes more to the total activity of the heterodimer (Ref. 15.Iaccarino I. Marra G. Palombo F. Jiricny J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2677-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar; see also above); and (iv) hMSH6 was shown to be the subunit contacting the mismatched substrate in UV-cross-linking studies (8.Hughes M.J. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23876-23882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Iaccarino I. Marra G. Palombo F. Jiricny J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2677-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 21.Jiricny J. Hughes M. Corman N. Rudkin B.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8860-8864Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Our expectation was that, unlike hMSH6 K1140R, the D1213V mutation should have no effect on the binding of the triphosphate. It should therefore permit us to differentiate between phenomena requiring only nucleotide binding and those requiring both binding and hydrolysis. The D1213V hMSH6/hMSH2 heterodimer was expressed in S. frugiperda Sf9 cells, following coinfection withbaculovirus vectors encoding the mutant hMSH6 and the wild type hMSH2 proteins (see “Experimental Procedures”). The purified hMutSα variant (Fig. 2 A), referred to as hMutSα 6DV in this study, displayed mismatch binding affinity and substrate specificity that were indistinguishable from the wild type heterodimer (data not shown). However, when the protein-DNA complex was challenged with ATP, hMutSα 6DV dissociated from the mismatched oligonucleotide at a nucleotide concentration 5-fold lower than the wild type hMutSα (Fig. 2 B). This behavior contrasts with that of the hMutSα 6KR variant, which dissociated from the mismatched oligonucleotide substrate at an ATP concentration significantly higher that the wild type hMutSα (15.Iaccarino I. Marra G. Palombo F. Jiricny J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2677-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The difference can be explained by the fact that the hMutSα 6KR heterodimer does not bind ATP in the hMSH6 subunit, and therefore the conformational change necessary to release the protein complex from the mismatch has to be driven entirely by hMSH2 (K m(ATP) of hMutSα 6KR is 4.7 ± 0.2 μm, compared with 0.4 ± 0.2 for the wild type hMutSα (15.Iaccarino I. Marra G. Palombo F. Jiricny J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2677-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar)). In contrast and as anticipated, the affinity of the hMutSα 6DV heterodimer for ATP was comparable with that of the wild type protein (hMutSα 6DVK mATP = 0.6 ± 0.1 μm, wild type K mATP = 0.4 ± 0.1 μm), whereas itsK cat(ATP) of 0.12 min−1 was similar to hMutSα 6KR (K cat(ATP) = 0.18 min−1) rather than to the wild type heterodimer (K cat(ATP) = 0.5 min−1). Taken together, these data indicated that the ATPase activity of the hMSH6 subunit could be effectively eliminated by mutations in both the Walker type A and B motifs. However, whereas the Lys → Arg mutation in the A motif affected ATP binding (15.Iaccarino I. Marra G. Palombo F. Jiricny J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2677-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), the Asp → Val mutation in the B motif inactivated the catalytic site of hMSH6, most likely because of the inability to coordinate magnesium and thus hydrolyze the γ-phosphate of the bound ATP. The differences between the biochemical characteristics of the ATP binding-deficient and ATP binding-proficient but hydrolysis-deficient hMutSα mutants became apparent also inin vitro mismatch repair assays. Thus, whereas both mutated factors were effectively unable to complement mismatch repair deficient extracts of cells lacking hMutSα (Fig. 2 C and Ref. 15.Iaccarino I. Marra G. Palombo F. Jiricny J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2677-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), addition of a large excess of the purified hMutSα 6DV heterodimer to extracts of mismatch repair-proficient HeLa cells had no effect on the efficiency of repair (data not shown). This contrasted with the behavior of hMutSα 2,6KR, which inhibited repair in these extracts (15.Iaccarino I. Marra G. Palombo F. Jiricny J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2677-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Thus, whereas both the mutant heterodimers are clearly proficient in mismatch binding and can therefore compete with the wild type hMutSα for the mismatch, the hMutSα 2,6KR mutant inhibits the repair process presumably by remaining bound at the mismatch site (15.Iaccarino I. Marra G. Palombo F. Jiricny J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2677-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), whereas the hMutSα 6DV heterodimer apparently dissociates from the DNA upon ATP binding and thus cannot interfere with the subsequent steps of the repair process.

Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) have reported earlier that hMutSα can dissociate from short, mismatch-containing oligonucleotide duplexes in the presence of ATP, under conditions where no hydrolysis takes place, i.e. in the absence of Mg2+. However, these experiments could not distinguish between the two alternative modes of dissociation of the heterodimer from DNA: direct dissociation or translocation along the DNA contour until the complex falls off the end of the short substrate.

Recent studies have suggested that trimming of oligosaccharide side chains also plays a role in the degradation of misfolded glycoproteins as a part of the quality control mechanism of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In this study, we examined the effect of several inhibitors of carbohydrate processing on the fate of the misfolded secretory protein α1 antitrypsin Z. Retention of this misfolded glycoprotein in the ER of liver cells in the classical form of α1 antitrypsin (α1-AT) deficiency is associated with severe liver injury and hepatocellular carcinoma and lack of its secretion is associated with destructive lung disease/emphysema.

For one, mannose-6-phosphate modification is a key determinant of sorting to the lysosome (1.Kornfeld S. Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar). Second, a number of studies have now shown that transport of secretory and membrane glycoproteins from the ER1 to their appropriate destination depends on the interaction of the innermost glucose residue of the oligosaccharide side chains with the resident ER molecular chaperones calnexin and calreticulin (2.Helenius A. Trombetta E.S. Hebert D.N. Simons J.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 193-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 3.Zapun A. Petrescu S.M. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Cell. 1997; 88: 29-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). This means that trimming of the N-glycan by glucosidases I and II and interaction with calnexin and calreticulin facilitate the proper folding and translocation of wild type glycoproteins. There is also evidence that trimming of glucose residues by glucosidases and of mannose residues by ER mannosidases is involved in the degradation of misfolded, unassembled, or mutant glycoproteins (4.Liu Y.

(11.Nichols W.C. Seligsohn U. Zivelin A. Terry V.H. Hertel C.E. Wheatley M.A. Moussalli M.J. Hauri H.-P. Ciavarella N. Kaufman R.J. Ginsburg D. Cell. 1998; 93: 61-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) have shown that ERGIC-53, a lectin which is specifically localized in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, is mutated in the combined deficiency of coagulation factors V and VIII. These results suggest that a lectin-like mechanism involving the interaction of carbohydrate side chains with ERGIC-53 is required for secretion of factors V and VIII. In the classic type of α1 antitrypsin (α1-AT) deficiency, the most common genetic cause of emphysema in adults and of liver disease in children, the mutant glycoprotein α1-ATZ is retained in the ER of liver cells rather than secreted into the extracellular fluid (12.Teckman J. Qu D. Perlmutter D.H. Hepatology. 1996; 24: 1504-1516PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant α1-ATZ molecule is characterized by a single amino acid substitution, which results in its polymerization in the ER (13.Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Finch J.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 1992; 357: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar, 14.Yu M.-H. Lee K.N. Kim J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, the mutant protein retains ∼80% of the functional activity of its wild type counterpart, inhibition of neutrophil elastase (15.Bathurst I.C. Travis J. George P.M. Carrell R.W. FEBS Lett. 1984; 177: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar,16.Ogushi F. Fells G.A. Hubbard R.C. Straus S.D. Crystal R.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 89: 1366-1374Crossref Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Because of the lack of this elastase inhibitor in the lung, deficient individuals often develop destructive lung disease/emphysema (12.Teckman J. Qu D. Perlmutter D.H. Hepatology. 1996; 24: 1504-1516PubMed Google Scholar). A subgroup of α1-AT-deficient individuals, predominantly infants and children, also develop chronic liver disease apparently because of the hepatotoxic effect of the mutant α1-ATZ molecule retained in the ER (12.Teckman J. Qu D. Perlmutter D.H. Hepatology. 1996; 24: 1504-1516PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have indicated that this subgroup is “susceptible” to liver injury by virtue of a lag in ER degradation resulting in greater accumulation of the misfolded hepatotoxic α1-ATZ molecule in liver cells (17.Wu Y. Whitman I. Molmenti E. Moore K. Hippenmeyer P. Perlmutter D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9014-9018Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). There are at least two and perhaps more pathways responsible for degradation of α1-ATZ in the ER. One pathway involves stable binding of α1-ATZ to calnexin, conjugation of ubiquitin to the cytoplasmic tail of complexed calnexin, and degradation of the α1-ATZ-polyubiquitinated calnexin complex by the proteasome (18.Qu D. Teckman J.H. Omura S. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22791-22795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). There also appears to be a ubiquitin-independent proteasomal mechanism for degradation of α1-ATZ in the ER (19.Teckman, J. H., Gilmore, R., and Perlmutter, D. H. (1999) Am. J. Physiol., in pressGoogle Scholar). In the current study, we used glucosidase and mannosidase inhibitors to examine the role of oligosaccharide side chain trimming in the fate of α1-ATZ. Previous studies have shown that glucosidase and mannosidase inhibitors inhibit secretion of wild type α1-AT (20.Gross V. Tran-Thi T.-A. Schwarz R.T. Elbein A.D. Decker K. Heinrich P.C. Biochem. J. 1986; 236: 853-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Studies of another mutant α1-AT molecule which is retained and degraded in the ER, α1-ATHONG KONG, have shown that glucosidase and mannosidase inhibitors alter ER degradation—accelerated by glucosidase inhibitors and delayed by mannosidase inhibitors (4.Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7946-7951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 5.Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5861-5867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). However, there are no previous reports of the effect of these inhibitors on mutant α1-ATZ. The results show that there are effects on ER degradation but, to our surprise, several glucosidase and mannosidase inhibitors mediated an increase in secretion of α1-ATZ. Because the mutant α1-ATZ molecule partially retains functional activity (15.Bathurst I.C. Travis J. George P.M. Carrell R.W. FEBS Lett. 1984; 177: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 16.Ogushi F. Fells G.A. Hubbard R.C. Straus S.D. Crystal R.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 89: 1366-1374Crossref Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and because clinical studies have suggested that only partial correction is needed for prevention of both liver and lung injury in α1-AT deficiency (17.Wu Y. Whitman I. Molmenti E. Moore K. Hippenmeyer P. Perlmutter D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9014-9018Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 21.Campbell E.J. Campbell M.A. Boukedes S.S. Owen C.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), the effects of this class of drugs are of therapeutic as well as pathobiologic interest. Materials—Neutrophil elastase was obtained from Athens Research and Technology, Inc. (Athens, GA). Kifunensine (KIF), castanospermine (CST), and N-methyldeoxynojirimycin (MDNJ) were obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals (Ontario, Canada).N-butyldeoxynojirimycin (BDNJ) was a generous gift from Dr. G. Jacob (Monsanto, St. Louis, MO). 1,4-Dideoxy-1,4-imino-d-mannitol hydrochloride (DIM) was obtained from Sigma. Deoxymannojirimycin (DMJ) was obtained from Calbiochem. Endoglycosidase H (Endo H) and N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The human fibroblast cell line CJZ12B engineered for stable expression of mutant α1-ATZ by transduction of amphotropic recombinant retroviral particles has been previously described (17.Wu Y. Whitman I. Molmenti E. Moore K. Hippenmeyer P. Perlmutter D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9014-9018Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). CJZ12B cells were preincubated for 1 h at 37 °C in serum-free DMEM with or without drug. Cells were then subjected to a pulse-chase protocol in the absence or presence of drug. The pulse was 1.5 h using 350–400 μCi TRAN35S label. Extracellular fluid (EC) and cell lysates (IC) were clarified, immunoprecipitated, and analyzed by 8–10% SDS-PAGE exactly as described previously (17.Wu Y. Whitman I. Molmenti E. Moore K. Hippenmeyer P. Perlmutter D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9014-9018Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Aliquots of each sample were subjected to trichloroacetic acid precipitation to ensure that there were equivalent levels of incorporation of radiolabel in the absence or presence of drug. The gels were visualized and quantitated on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). To exclude the possibility that drug altered the viability of CJZ12B cells during the pulse-chase protocol, total protein synthesis was examined at the end of a simulated pulse-chase protocol (in the absence of TRAN35S label, but in the absence or presence of drug). At the 0-, 3-, and 6-h chase time points, cells were washed to remove drug and then labeled with 200 μCi TRAN35S for 30 min. Total incorporated counts were determined by TCA precipitation. Cell viability was also assessed by trypan blue exclusion. The method of Qu et al. (18.Qu D. Teckman J.H. Omura S. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22791-22795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) was used. Purified α1-ATZ mRNA was used to program the reticulocyte lysate cell free system supplemented with canine pancreatic microsomes for translation over 60 min at 30 °C. The microsomal vesicles were then isolated by centrifugation and incubated in a proteolysis-primed lysate at 37 °C for the indicated time intervals. Aliquots were taken at the indicated time intervals, and the samples were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. Co-immunoprecipitation with anti-GRP78 antibody was done using a nondenaturing buffer of 1% CHAPS in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, with 200 mm NaCl (HBS) and apyrase 50 units/ml. Samples were immunoprecipitated with antibody to α1-AT, and the immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 20 μl of 50 mmTris, pH 6.8, 0.5% SDS, and 0.1 m β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were heated at 90–100 °C for 5 min. For Endo H digestion, the 20-μl samples were diluted with 17 μl of 0.15 mNaOAc, pH 6, and 0.5 μl of 0.1 m PMSF. Endo H was added using 3 μl of a 1 munits/μl solution. For N-glycosidase F digestion, the resuspended samples were added to 8 μl of 1m NaPO4 buffer, pH 8.3, 5 μl of 14% Nonidet P-40 detergent, 7.5 μl of 250 munits/μl N-glycosidase F, and 0.5 μl of 0.1 m PMSF. All samples were incubated overnight at 37 °C and then dissolved in sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. Cells were subjected to a pulse-chase protocol, and the EC medium was harvested after 6 h of the chase period. This medium was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with neutrophil elastase, in amounts from 1 ng to 5 μg in 0.5 ml of 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, and then subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-α1-AT for SDS-PAGE. First, we examined the effect of several glucosidase inhibitors, CST and MDNJ, on the relative electrophoretic migration of α1-ATZ (Fig. 1 A). In the absence of drug, α1-ATZ migrates at ∼ 52 kDa. Previous studies have shown that this 52-kDa polypeptide represents a biosynthetic intermediate with high-mannose-type oligosaccharide side chains (17.Wu Y. Whitman I. Molmenti E. Moore K. Hippenmeyer P. Perlmutter D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9014-9018Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In the presence of CST or MDNJ, α1-ATZ migrates slightly more slowly, reflecting inhibition of glucose removal. Next we examined the effect of CST on the fate of α1-ATZ in pulse-chase experiments (Fig.1 B). The results show that in the absence of CST, the 52-kDa α1-ATZ polypeptide is retained for 1 h but begins to disappear from IC between 2 and 4 h, with only trace amounts of the 55-kDa mature α1-AT polypeptide appearing in EC. In the presence of CST, the untrimmed α1-ATZ polypeptide also disappears from IC between 2 and 4 h of the chase period, but in this case there is a marked increase in the amount of mature 55 kDa α1-ATZ secreted into the EC medium. By 6 h into the chase period, 31 ± 2% of the newly synthesized α1-ATZ was secreted into the medium in the presence of CST as compared with 17 ± 3% in the absence of CST. The half-times for disappearance of α1-ATZ from IC were 0.92 ± 0.35 h in the absence and 0.90 ± 0.26 h in the presence of CST. These results indicate that there is increased secretion of α1-ATZ in the presence of CST. We also examined the effect of the glucosidase inhibitor MDNJ on the fate of α1-ATZ in CJZ12 cells (Fig. 1 C). The results also show that the untrimmed α1-ATZ generated in the presence of MDNJ disappears from IC more rapidly but, in contrast to CST, there was no increase in the secretion of α1-ATZ. These results indicate that the effect of CST on secretion of α1-ATZ is specific. Experiments with a third glucosidase inhibitor, BDNJ, show that it also does not increase secretion of α1-ATZ (data not shown). It is not clear at this time why CST, but not DNJ or MDNJ, mediates increased secretion. Previous studies have suggested that there may be differences in the efficiency of the glucosidase inhibition and in the number of glucose residues on the three oligosaccharide side chains of wild type α1-AT after treatment with CST, DNJ, and MDNJ (20.Gross V. Tran-Thi T.-A. Schwarz R.T. Elbein A.D. Decker K. Heinrich P.C. Biochem. J. 1986; 236: 853-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 22.Kang M.H. Liu P.S. Bernotas R.C. Harry B.S. Sunkara P.S. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Alternatively, CST may mediate the increased secretion of α1-ATZ through a secondary effect or through an effect that is unrelated to glucosidase inhibition. Next, we examined the effect of CST on ER degradation of α1-ATZ. CST is known to prevent the interaction of glycoproteins with calnexin (2.Helenius A. Trombetta E.S. Hebert D.N. Simons J.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 193-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar,3.Zapun A. Petrescu S.M. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Cell. 1997; 88: 29-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have indicated that interaction with calnexin is, at least in part, required for proteasomal degradation of α1-ATZ and that it is the α1-ATZ-calnexin complex which is targeted by the ubiquitin system and the proteasome (18.Qu D. Teckman J.H. Omura S. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22791-22795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Although careful accounting for radioactivity in the pulse-chase experiments in intact cells in Fig. 1 B suggests that there is no difference in the disappearance of α1-ATZ from IC in the presence of CST, we chose to more specifically determine the effect of CST on degradation of α1-ATZ here using the cell-free microsomal translocation system. Previous studies have indicated that α1-ATZ is specifically degraded in this cell free system by a mechanism which involves the proteasome and which closely recapitulates the degradation of α1-ATZ in intact cells (18.Qu D. Teckman J.H. Omura S. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22791-22795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In Fig. 2 A,left panel, the 52-kDa α1-ATZ polypeptide begins to disappear between 15–30 min and is completely degraded between 30–45 min of the chase period. When the reaction is preincubated with CST (center panel), the untrimmed slower migrating α1-ATZ polypeptide is degraded slightly more slowly, beginning 30 min and only completed by 45–90 min of the chase period. When the CST is only added during the chase period (right panel), a condition which does not interfere with initial trimming by glucosidase but does prevent dissociation of glycoproteins from calnexin (23.Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), the untrimmed 52-kDa α1-ATZ polypeptide is degraded at a rate which is not slowed but rather is very close to that in control with disappearance beginning between 15–30 min and completed between 30–45 min. In Fig. 2 B, microsomal vesicles from these reactions were homogenized under nondenaturing conditions and subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies to calnexin and GRP78/BiP. This protocol was designed to determine whether α1-ATZ could be co-immunoprecipitated by anticalnexin and/or anti-BiP and, if so, to determine the kinetics of α1-ATZ-calnexin and α1-ATZ-BiP association and dissociation. The results show that trimmed α1-ATZ is co-immunoprecipitated by anticalnexin early in the chase period but this complex disappears between 30–45 min of the chase period (center panel, control). The kinetics of disappearance of the α1-ATZ-calnexin complex is similar to those of α1-ATZ in reactions that have not been subjected to immunoprecipitation (left panel, control). Very little α1-ATZ is co-precipitated by anticalnexin in reactions that were preincubated with CST (center panel, CST). Although very little α1-ATZ is co-precipitated with anti-BiP under control conditions (right panel, control), some untrimmed α1-ATZ is immunoprecipitated with anti-BiP after preincubation with CST (right panel, CST). This α1-ATZ-BiP complex is detected at the beginning of the chase period and very rapidly disappears. Previous studies have shown that misfolded proteins may aggregate in association with BiP when glucose trimming is inhibited (24.Zhang J.-X. Braakman I. Matlack K.E.S. Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1943-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). This data suggests that in the presence of CST there is less, or negligible, interaction of untrimmed α1-ATZ with calnexin, that a certain proportion of the untrimmed α1-ATZ has bound to BiP, and that the untrimmed α1-ATZ-BiP complex is rapidly dissociated or degraded. Thus, when CST inhibits glucose trimming and, in turn, interaction with calnexin, α1-ATZ is degraded rapidly by an alternative degradative pathway that involves an untrimmed α1-ATZ-BiP complex. This alternative degradative pathway appears to also involve the proteasome because it is significantly abrogated by the proteasomal inhibitors MG132 in the cell free system (data not shown) as well as in CJZ12B cells (Fig. 3). This alternative degradative mechanism also probably explains the relatively modest inhibition of α1-ATZ degradation in the cell free system after preincubation with CST. Taking into consideration differences in fluorographic exposure time for the panels in Fig.2 B, we estimate that only 5–10% of total α1-ATZ is co-immunoprecipitated with anti-BiP antibody in the presence of CST. This implies that one or more additional mechanisms are involved in degradation of α1-ATZ under these conditions. Several recent studies have indicated that ER mannosidases play a role in the processing of carbohydrate side chains of some glycoproteins in the ER (4.Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7946-7951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 5.Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5861-5867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Here (Fig.4) we examined the effect of a mannosidase I inhibitor, KIF, a mannosidase II inhibitor, DIM, and an inhibitor of both mannosidases I and II, DMJ (25.Weng S. Spiro R.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 325: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The effect of these inhibitors on the relative electrophoretic mobility of α1-ATZ is shown in Fig. 4 A. There is slightly slower electrophoretic migration in the presence of KIF and DMJ but not in the presence of DIM. Next, we examined the effect of these inhibitors on the fate of α1-ATZ in pulse-chase experiments (Fig. 4,B–D). In the presence of KIF and DMJ, the untrimmed α1-ATZ polypeptide is retained IC for a longer period of time than in control, and there is a marked increase in the amount of α1-ATZ that appears EC. The α1-ATZ polypeptide that is secreted in the presence of KIF and DMJ is 52 kDa as compared with the 55-kDa polypeptide secreted in the presence of CST. In contrast, the mannosidase II inhibitor DIM has no effect on degradation or secretion of α1-ATZ (Fig. 4 D). DIM is active in these experiments as evidenced by the fact that the small amount of α1-ATZ that reaches the EC fluid has a more rapid relative electrophoretic mobility at ∼53 kDa. These data indicate that DMJ and KIF mediate a marked decrease in degradation and an increase in secretion of α1-ATZ. The effect of DMJ and KIF on secretion of α1-ATZ probably involves a different mechanism than the effect of CST because the α1-ATZ that is secreted in each of these cases has a different electrophoretic mobility. The data also implicate ER mannosidase I but not ER mannosidase II in playing an important role in the fate of the misfolded α1-ATZ molecule. To determine whether α1-ATZ secreted in the presence of CST or KIF has high mannose- or complex-type oligosaccharide side chains, we examined the effect of Endo H and PNGase F (Fig. 5 A). In HepG2 cells, the 55-kDa wild type α1-AT in the extracellular fluid was resistant to digestion with Endo H but cleaved to an ∼46-kDa polypeptide by PNGase F as expected (left panel). In CJZ12B cells treated with CST, the 55-kDa α1-ATZ polypeptide was partially resistant and partially sensitive to Endo H (center panel). A 46-kDa Endo H-sensitive polypeptide probably represents the cleavage product of α1-ATZ with high-mannose carbohydrate. The ∼48- and ∼52-kDa partially Endo H-sensitive polypeptides probably represent cleavage products of α1-ATZ with high-mannose carbohydrates on one or two of its three carbohydrate side chains. The 55-kDa Endo H-resistant polypeptide probably represents α1-ATZ with complex carbohydrates at all three of its side chains. This pattern was not because of incomplete digestion because it did not change with higher concentrations of Endo H (data not shown). An identical result has previously been observed for the 55-kDa wild type α1-AT polypeptide secreted by hepatocytes in the presence of CST (20.Gross V. Tran-Thi T.-A. Schwarz R.T. Elbein A.D. Decker K. Heinrich P.C. Biochem. J. 1986; 236: 853-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Maturation of one, two, or all three carbohydrate side chains to the complex type in the presence of CST is probably a result of the cell type-specific expression in Golgi of endo-α-d-mannosidase which can deglucosylate glycoproteins during inhibition of glucosidases (26.Karaivanova V.K. Luan P. Spiro R.G. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In CJZ12B cells treated with CST, the 55-kDa α1-ATZ polypeptide was cleaved to 46 kDa by PGNase F as expected (center panel). In CJZ12B cells treated with KIF, the 52-kDa α1-ATZ polypeptide was completely Endo H-sensitive being cleaved to 46 kDa (right panel), indicating that it is an intermediate with high-mannose carbohydrate side chains. We examined the possibility that α1-ATZ secreted in the presence of CST, KIF, or DMJ could form an SDS-stable complex with neutrophil elastase (Fig. 5 B). The results show that wild type α1-AT from HepG2 cells forms ∼66- and ∼75-kDa high molecular mass complexes with elastase (left panel). Complexes begin to form at 0.1 μg of elastase added, with complete conversion by 0.5 μg of elastase added. The ∼66-kDa band probably represents complexes that have undergone partial hydrolysis during the reaction or during processing/gel electrophoretic analysis. The ∼ 51-kDa band represents cleaved α1-ATZ. The α1-ATZ secreted from CST-treated CJZ12B cells also forms high molecular mass complexes with elastase that migrate to ∼75 kDa. Here, however, complexes start to become apparent at 0.5 μg of elastase added, and complete conversion to the complex form requires 2 μg of elastase. The α1-ATZ secreted from KIF-treated or DMJ-treated CJZ12B also forms complexes with elastase. In this case, the complex migrates at ∼70 kDa. Because α1-ATZ secreted in the presence of KIF or DMJ is ∼52 kDa, the ∼70-kDa complex probably corresponds to the ∼75 kDa complex formed with wild type α1-AT from HepG2 cells. The α1-ATZ from KIF-treated or DMJ-treated CJZ12B cells only starts to form complexes when 0.5 μg of elastase is added and only at 2 μg of elastase is it completely converted to the complex form. These data indicate that α1-ATZ secreted in the presence of CST, KIF, or DMJ is functionally active although, in each case, it is apparently slightly lower in activity than wild type α1-AT secreted by HepG2 cells. Similar results have been described for wild type human α1-AT secreted with high-mannose type carbohydrate side chains by Saccharomyces cerevisiaeand methylotrophic yeasts (27.Kang H.A. Sohn J.-H. Choi E.-S. Chung B.H., Yu, M.-H. Rhee S.-K. Yeast. 1998; 14: 371-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 28.Kwon K.-S. Yu M.-H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1335: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Taken together, the results of these studies indicate that the glucosidase inhibitor CST mediates increased secretion of α1-ATZ and that the mannosidase inhibitors KIF and DMJ mediate both decreased degradation and increased secretion of α1-ATZ. The results, therefore, suggest that there are mechanisms, at least two, by which steps in oligosaccharide side chain trimming can be circumvented and a cohort of misfolded glycoproteins permitted to traverse the secretory pathway. In one previous study, CST has been shown to increase secretion of carboxyl-terminal truncated fragments of influenza virus hemagglutinin (24.Zhang J.-X. Braakman I. Matlack K.E.S. Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1943-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), but there are no previous reports of a similar effect for KIF or DMJ. It is not clear at this time whether the alterations in the structure of the oligosaccharide side chain prevent the side chain from interacting with molecules responsible for its retention, permit the side chain to interact with molecules that can facilitate the folding of the mutant α1-ATZ protein, or result in alterations in the conformation of α1-ATZ in such a way that its folding is facilitated. In the case of α1-ATZ generated in the presence of mannosidase inhibitors KIF and DMJ, the ERGIC-53 cycling pathway is an excellent candidate for mediating increased secretion. Mousalli et al. (29.Moussalli M. Pipe S.W. Hauri H.-P. Nichols W.C. Ginsburg D. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32539-32542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) have recently shown that ERGIC-53 mediates secretion of coagulation factors V and VIII by specific recognition of fully glucose-trimmed, mannose 9 oligosaccharide side chains. Interaction with the ERGIC-53 cycling pathway would not, however, provide an explanation for the delay in degradation that also occurs in the presence of KIF and DMJ. Several previous studies have suggested the possibility that uncharacterized “carbohydrate-binding chaperones” are responsible for stabilization of untrimmed secretory and membrane proteins during treatment with mannosidase inhibitors (6.Jakob C.A. Burda P. Roth J. Aebi M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 9.Yang M. Omura S. Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. J. Exp.

The results also provide further evidence that physiologic and pharmacologic perturbations have separate and independent effects on ER degradation and secretion of the misfolded α1-ATZ molecule. Glycerol and 4-phenylbutyric acid (PBA) mediate increases in secretion of α1-ATZ without affecting its degradation (30.Burrows, J. A. J., Willis, L. K., and Perlmutter, D. H. (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., in pressGoogle Scholar). Lactacystin, cycloheximide, and lowering of temperature to 27 °C are associated with a decrease in degradation of α1-ATZ without any change in secretion (30.Burrows, J. A. J., Willis, L. K., and Perlmutter, D. H. (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., in pressGoogle Scholar). KIF, DMJ (Fig. 4), and elevation of temperature to 42 °C are associated with decreased degradation and increased secretion (30.Burrows, J. A. J., Willis, L. K., and Perlmutter, D. H. (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., in pressGoogle Scholar). Because the mutant α1-ATZ retains functional activity and because clinical studies have suggested that only partial correction of the secretory defect is needed for prevention of both liver and lung disease in α1-AT deficiency, any drug which enhances secretion is a candidate for chemoprophylaxis in patients with this deficiency. Our recent studies have shown that a chemical chaperone PBA is an excellent candidate (30.Burrows, J. A. J., Willis, L. K., and Perlmutter, D. H. (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., in pressGoogle Scholar). The current study suggests that CST may be another potential chemoprophylactic agent. Indeed, a compound based on CST, 6-O-butanoyl CST is currently in clinical trials as an adjuvant treatment for HIV infection (31.Jacob G.S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The mannosidase inhibitors KIF and DMJ are also less attractive drugs for chemoprophylaxis because they delay degradation of α1-ATZ as well as increase its secretion. Thus, drugs based on these compounds have the potential to prevent lung injury but to increase the likelihood of liver injury in α1-AT-deficient patients.

Slade H.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1980; 44: 331-384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, these polysaccharides might have significance in the development of tartar, plaque, and possibly dental carries (2.Ginsburg I. Braude A.I. Microbiology. W. B. Saunders Co., London1982: 292Google Scholar). Mutan is a major component of exopolysaccharides produced by tooth colonizing streptococci such as Streptococcus mutans (3.Guggenheim B. Helv. Odont. Acta. 1970; 14: 89-108PubMed Google Scholar). Mutan is composed of α1,3-glucan with some α1,6-glucan (dextran) side chains. Mutanase (α1,3-glucanase, EC 3.2.1.59) and dextranase (α1,6-glucanase, EC 3.2.1.11) enzymes could be beneficial additives to dentifrice preparations as it has been shown that these enzymes are capable of removing biofilms created by oral bacteria in vitro (4.Tsuchiya R. Fuglsang C.C. Johansen C. Aaslyng D. J. Dent. Res. 1998; 77: 2713Google Scholar) and reducing plaque formation in vivo (5.Guggenheim B. Regolati B. Schmid R. Mühlemann H.R.

Mutanase activity from the filamentous fungus Trichoderma harzianum was first described by Guggenheim and Haller (7.Guggenheim B. Haller R. J. Dent. Res. 1972; 51: 394-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, only a limited number of reports are available on the characterization of fungal mutanases. Here we describe the cloning, expression, and subsequent characterization of two fungal mutanases representing a new family of fungal endoglucanases with their unique mutan-binding domains. T. harzianum strain CBS 243.71 and Penicillium purpurogenum CBS 238.95 were used as the sources of genomic DNA. Aspergillus oryzae JaL142 and JaL125 (obtained from J. Lehmbeck, Novo Nordisk A/S), were alkaline protease-deficient strains used for heterologous expression of cloned mutanases. The A. oryzae strains show no detectable level of background mutanase activity in the assay described. 100 g of SP234 (Novo-Nordisk A/S, batch number PPM 3897) were dissolved in 1 liter 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2. Contaminant proteins were removed by batch adsorption on DEAE-Sephadex, then by batch adsorption on S-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After concentration on a Filtron concentrator equipped with a 10-kDa cut-off membrane, the unbound material was applied to a S-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (180 ml, 2.6 × 33 cm) equilibrated with 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.7. The mutanase was eluted with a 0–20 mm linear gradient of NaCl in the same buffer (3 column volumes). The residual protein was eluted with the same buffer containing 1 mNaCl. Fractions with high mutanase activity were pooled and concentrated. After the procedure was repeated 12 times, the pooled fractions were concentrated and placed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The mutanase was further purified on a HiLoad Q-Sepharose column (50 ml, 2.6 × 10 cm) equilibrated with 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, and eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 50 mm NaCl in 12 column volumes. Fractions with high mutanase activity were pooled and concentrated in an Amicon cell equipped with a 10-kDa cut-off membrane. Finally, the mutanase preparation was dialyzed extensively against 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. SDS-PAGE1 gave one single band at 75 kDa (data not shown). Carbohydrate composition analysis was performed on lyophilized samples which were hydrolyzed in vacuo in sealed glass tubes using 100 μl of 2 m trifluoroacetic acid for 1 h and 4 h at 100 °C. Monosaccharides were separated by high performance anion exchange chromatography using a Dionex Carbopac PA1 column eluted with 16 mm NaOH and detected by pulsed amperometric detection. The mutanase mass was measured using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) (VG Analytical). Typically 2 μl of sample were mixed with 2 μl of saturated matrix solution (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid:acetonitrile (70:30)) and 2 μl of the mixture were deposited on the target plate. After evaporation of the solvent, the samples were introduced in the spectrometer. They were desorbed and ionized by 4-ns laser pulses (337 nm) and subjected to an accelerating voltage of 25 kV. Ions were detected by a microchannel plate set at 1850 V. T. harzianum was cultivated as described (8.Draborg H. Kauppinen S. Dalbøge H. Christgau S. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1995; 36: 781-791PubMed Google Scholar). A 2-liter sample was taken after 4 days of growth at 30 °C, and the mycelium was collected, frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of T. harzianum poly(A)+RNA as described earlier (9.Siggaard-Andersen M. Kauppinen S. von Wettstein-Knowles P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4114-4118Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A 387-bp fragment of the T. harzianum mutanase cDNA (10.Aizo, M., Otoko, S., Miki, T., Soichiro, M., Junichi, M., and Minoru, O. (1992) Japanese Patent Application JP1992058889-A1Google Scholar) was amplified using two mutanase-specific primers (100 pmol each): forward (5′-ACTAAGCTTTATGTTCAAAATGAGCA-3′) and reverse (5′-ACACTCTAGAACATATGGGTTGAAGTTGT-3′), a DNA thermal cycler (Landgraf, Germany) and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer Cetus). Initially, two cycles of PCR were done using a cycle profile of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 45 °C for 2 min, and extension at 72 °C for 3 min, then the annealing temperature was increased to 55 °C and 30 additional cycles were performed. The PCR fragment of interest was subcloned into pUC18 vector and sequenced as described previously (9.Siggaard-Andersen M. Kauppinen S. von Wettstein-Knowles P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The poly(A)+ RNA was isolated by oligo(dT)-cellulose affinity chromatography (12.Aviv H. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 1408-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (5183) Google Scholar). Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of T. harzianumpoly(A)+ RNA as described earlier (13.Kofod L.V. Kauppinen S. Christgau S. Andersen L.N. Heldt-Hansen H.P. Dörreich K. Dalbøge H. J.

Schneider P. Golightly E.J. Brown S.H. Madden M. Brown K.M. Halkier T. Mondorf K. Xu F. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 3151-3157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and used for construction of genomic DNA libraries in the bacteriophage λ-ZipLox cloning system (Life Technologies Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) (17.Berka R.M. Rey M.W. Brown K.M. Byun T. Klotz A.V. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 4423-4427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 45,000 plaques from the library were screened by plaque hybridization (18.Davis R.W. Botstein D. Roth J.R. Advanced Bacterial Genetics, a Manual for Genetic Engineering. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1980Google Scholar) with a radiolabeled T. harzianum mutanase probe fragment using moderate stringency conditions (5 × SSPE, 35% formamide (v/v), 0.3% SDS, 200 μg/ml denatured and sheared salmon testes DNA; hybridization temperature 45 °C. Membranes were washed once in 0.2 × SSPE with 0.1% SDS at 45 °C followed by two washes in 0.2 × SSPE (no SDS) at the same temperature.) Plaques which gave hybridization signals were purified twice on Escherichia coli Y1090ZL cells, and the mutanase clones were subsequently excised from the λ-ZipLox vector as pZL1-derivatives (19.D'Alessio J.M. Bebee R. Hartley J.L. Noon M.C. Polayes D. (Life Technologies Inc.)Focus®. 1992; 14: 76Google Scholar). One such clone, designated pZL-Pp6A, was selected for further study. DNA sequencing was done with an Applied Biosystems Model 373A Automated DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA) using a combination of shotgun DNA sequencing (20.Messing J. Crea R. Seeburg P.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1557) Google Scholar) and the primer walking technique with dye-terminator chemistry (21.Giesecke H. Obermaier B. Domedy H. Neubert W.J. J. Virol. Methods. 1992; 38: 47-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). TheT. harzianum mutanase cDNA fragment was inserted in a two-step cloning procedure into an A. oryzae expression vector, pMHan37 (kindly provided by I. G. Clausen, Novo Nordisk A/S), which contains the A. nidulans amdS gene as a selectable marker, pUC plasmid sequences for replication in E. coli, an α-amylase gene promoter from A. oryzae, and the A. niger glucoamylase (glaA) terminator (22.Boel E. Hjort I. Svennson B. Norris F. Norris K.E. Fiil N.P. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1097-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In the first step, pMHan37 was linearizd with the restriction enzymesEcoRI and XhoI. This fragment was ligated with the following three segments: 1) a 618-nt fragment of the α-amylase promoter sequence bordered by an EcoRI site at the 5′ end and a BamHI site at the 3′ end; 2) linker number 1 listed below which has a BamHI site at the 5′ end and aNarI site at the 3′ end. This linker includes the Met start codon and 12 amino acids of the mutanase signal sequence; and 3) a 68-nt NarI/XhoI fragment from the mutanase cDNA clone containing amino acids 12 to 34 of the mutanase gene. The resulting plasmid pJW99 contains the α-amylase promoter immediately upstream from the first 34 amino acids of the mutanase gene, followed by the A. niger glucoamylase terminator. To complete the expression vector the mutanase cDNA fragment was cleaved with XhoI and SphI giving a 1790-nt fragment encoding amino acids 35–598. This fragment was ligated with pJW99 that had been linearized with XhoI plusXbaI and linker number 2, yielding the vector pMT1802, which contains the entire mutanase coding region under the transcriptional control of the A. oryzae α-amylase promoter and A. niger glucoamylase terminator. Plasmid pMT1796 is identical to pMT1802 except that Glu-35 of the mutanase protein has been changed to Lys-35 by replacing the XhoI/KpnI fragment of pMT1802 with a PCR-amplified fragment containing this mutation. This PCR fragment was created in a two-step procedure as reported in Ref. 23.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholarusing the following primers: Primer 1 (nt 2761, 5′-CAGCGTCCACATCACGAGC, nt 2779) and Primer 2 (nt 3306, 5′-CAAGAAGCACGTTTCTCAGAGACCG, nt 3281); Primer 3 (nt 3281 5′-CGGTCTCTGAGAAACGTGCTTCTTC, nt 3306) and Primer 4 (nt 4276, 5′-GCCACTTCCGTTATTAGCC, nt 4257); nucleotide numbers refer to the pMT1802 plasmid. The A. oryzae host strain JaL125 was transformed using a polyethylene glycol-mediated protocol (24.Christensen T. Wöldike H. Boel E. Mortensen S.B. Hjortshøj K. Thim L. Hansen M.T. Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 1419-1422Crossref Scopus (270) Google Scholar) and a DNA mixture containing 0.5 μg of a plasmid encoding the gene that confers resistance to the herbicide Basta (25.Straubinger B. Straubinger E. Wirsel S. Turgeon G. Yoder O. Fungal Genet. Newslett. 1992; 39: 82-83Google Scholar) and 8.0 μg of the expression vector pMT1796. Transformants were selected on minimal plates containing 0.5% Basta and 50 mm urea as a nitrogen source. Each transformant was purified twice on selection media and conidia were harvested. Universal containers (20 ml, Nunc, catalog number 364211) containing 10 ml of YPM (2% maltose, 1% bactopeptone bactopeptone, and 0.5% yeast extract) were inoculated with spores from the transformants and incubated 5 days with shaking at 30 °C. Culture supernatants were harvested after 5 days growth and assayed for the recombinant mutanase. Two synthetic oligonucleotide primers were designed to amplify the P. purpurogenum mutanase gene from plasmid pZL-Pp6A, 5′-cccatttaaatATGAAAGTCTCCAGTGCCTTC and 5′-cccttaattaaTTAGCTCTCTACTTGACAAGC (capital letters correspond to the sequence present in the mutanase coding region). One hundred picomoles of each primer was used in a PCR reaction containing 52 ng of plasmid DNA, 1× Pwo polymerase buffer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN), 1 mm each dATP, dTTP, dGTP, dCTP, and 2.5 units of Pwo polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The PCR conditions were 95 °C 3 min, 25× (95 °C 1 min, 60 °C 1 min, 72 °C 1.5 min), 72 °C 5 min. The amplified 2.2-kilobase DNA fragment was purified by gel electrophoresis and cut with restriction endonucleases SwaI and PacI (using conditions specified by the manufacturers). The fragment was cloned into plasmid pBANe6 (26.Brody, H., Hansen, K., Lamsa, M. H., and Yaver, D. S. (1998) World Patent Application WO9811203Google Scholar) that had been previously cut withSwaI and PacI and the resultant expression plasmid was named pJeRS35. This vector was introduced into A. oryzae host strain JaL142 using a standard protoplast transformation procedure (24.Christensen T. Wöldike H. Boel E. Mortensen S.B. Hjortshøj K. Thim L. Hansen M.T. Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 1419-1422Crossref Scopus (270) Google Scholar) and 40 transformants were selected by their ability to grow on COVE medium using acetamide as sole nitrogen source. The transformants were grown in 20 ml of MY50N media (MY50N in g/liter: Nutriose (Roquette), 62; MgSO4·7H2O, 2.0; KH2PO4, 2.0; citric acid, 4.0; yeast extract, 8.0; urea, 2.0; trace metals, 0.5 ml; pH 6.0, and then add CaCl2, 0.1) in shaker flasks for 3 days at 34 °C with agitation. Mutan assay plates were prepared by blending a suspension of 1% (v/w) mutan, 1% agarose in 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, for 20 min at 4 °C. The agarose was melted by heating and 150-mm Petri plates were poured. After solidification, small wells (about 40 μl equivalent volume) were punched in the plates. To screen the transformants for ability to secrete mutanase, 35 μl of centrifuged culture broth from each transformant (and one untransformed control) were pipetted into the wells and the plates were incubated at 37 °C. Mutanase activity in the broth samples caused formation of clearing zones around the wells. Mutan was prepared by growing S. mutans CBS 350.71 at 37 °C, pH 6.5 (kept constant at a stirring rate of 75 rpm in a medium comprised of the following components: NZ-Case, 6.5 g/liter; yeast extract, 6 g/liter; (NH4)2SO4, 20 g/liter; K3PO4, 3 g/liter; glucose, 50 g/liter; pluronic PE6100, 0.1%). After 35 h, sucrose was added to a final concentration of 60 g/liter to induce glucosyltransferase. The total fermentation time was 75 h. The supernatant from this fermentation was centrifuged and filtered (sterile). Sucrose was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 5% (pH was adjusted to pH 7.0 with acetic acid) and the solution was stirred overnight at 37 °C. The solution was filtered and the insoluble mutan harvested on a Propex 23 filter (Scapa Filtration) and washed with deionized water containing 1% sodium benzoate, pH 5 (adjusted with acetic acid). Finally, the insoluble mutan was lyophilized and ground. The production of soluble reducing sugars released from mutan was employed as a measure of enzyme activity. First, 0.1 ml of 5% mutan in 50 mm sodium acetate (allowed to swell at least for 1 h), pH 5.5, was added to 0.3 ml of enzyme sample (diluted in water) in a round-bottomed Eppendorf vial to ensure sufficient agitation and incubated for 15 min at 40 °C while shaking vigorously. The reaction was terminated by adding 0.1 ml of 0.4m NaOH and the samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 × g and filtered through 0.45-μm HV-filters (Millipore). To each filtrate (100 μl) in Eppendorf vials 750 μl of ferricyanide reagent (0.4 g/liter K3Fe(CN)6, 20 g/liter Na2CO3) was added and incubated 15 min at 85 °C. After allowing the samples to cool, the decrease in absorbance at 420 nm was measured. A dilution series of glucose was included as a standard. Proper controls (substrate and enzyme blanks) were always included. One mutanase unit (MU) was defined as the amount of enzyme releasing 1 μmol of reducing sugar per minute at pH 5.5 and 40 °C. Temperature profiles were obtained by incubating the assay mixture (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5) at various temperatures. The pH profiles were obtained by suspending the mutan in 50 mm buffer at various pH (glycine-HCl, pH 3–3.5; sodium acetate, pH 4–5.5; and sodium phosphate, pH 6–7.5). The fermentation broth (700 ml) containing 15.4 MU/ml was filtered using GF/A (Whatmann) and HV 0.45-μm (Millipore) filters and concentrated on a Filtron concentrator equipped with a 10 kDa cut-off membrane. The pH was adjusted to 4.7 (conductivity approximately 300 microsiemens/cm), and the broth was loaded onto an S-Sepharose column (XK 50/22, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.7. The mutanase was eluted in a linear NaCl gradient. Fractions containing mutanase activity were pooled and concentrated on an Amicon Cell (YM10) and loaded onto a HiLoad Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (approximately 600 μS/cm), in three rounds. The mutanase was eluted in a linear gradient of NaCl. Pooled fractions (according to activity/purity) were concentrated and further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 (16/60) column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 6.0. The fermentation broth (780 ml) containing 2.2 MU/ml was filtered (0.45 μm; HV Millipore) and mixed with 15.6 g of mutan, washed in 0.1m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, to provide a 2% solution. The pH was adjusted to 5.5 and the suspension was allowed to stand at 4 °C for 1 h while stirring. The suspension was then filtered on a sintered glass filter funnel and the mutan was washed four times with 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5 (total volume: 1110 ml), and then six times with Milli Q-filtered deionized water (total volume, 1250 ml); after each washing step the suspension was filtered. The mutanase eluted during the washing with water. These filtrates were pooled, filtered (0.7 μm, Whatman), concentrated on a Filtron concentrator equipped with a 10 kDa cut-off membrane, and further concentrated to 25 ml on an Amicon cell (YM10 membrane). Equilibrium binding was ascertained with 10 mg/ml mutan incubated at 4 °C with 0.5 MU mutanase in 10 mm Britton-Robinson buffer, pH 7. At various time points, samples were taken and filtered (0.45-μm HV, Millipore) prior to measuring the activity. Binding isotherms were obtained by incubating various concentrations of purified mutanase in a 0.2% suspension of mutan in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7, for 1 h at 4 °C while stirring. The mutan was rinsed in buffer prior to use. Samples were then centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 × g and the amount of enzyme left in the supernatant determined by fluorescence spectrometry (Perkin-Elmer LS50) with excitation at 280 nm and emission at 345 nm. A fluorescence standard curve of the enzyme diluted in buffer was always included. Alternatively, the activity was measured in the supernatant and compared with the control. The data was fitted using the simple Langmuir theory for adsorption to a surface: A = (A max ×E free)/(K D +E free), where A is the adsorbed protein, A max is the maximum amount of protein which can be adsorbed to the surface, E free is the free protein and K D the equilibrium constant forES ↔ E + S (27.Bothwell M.K. Walker L.P. Bioresour. Technol. 1995; 53: 21-29Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was done with 4–20 or 8–16% gradient gels (Novex) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples for DSC were desalted into the appropriate buffer using NAP-5 columns from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Final enzyme concentrations were in the range from 2 to 3 mg/ml. Samples were scanned from 20 to 90 °C using a scan rate of 90°/h at the MC-2 (MicroCal). NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing was done using an Applied Biosystems 473A protein sequencer according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mutanase was incubated for 2.5 h at 30 °C with chymotrypsin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in a ratio of 100:1 (mutanase:chymotrypsin, w/w) in 50 mmNH4HCO3. The digest was investigated on SDS-PAGE and the 41-kDa band observed was electroblotted from SDS-PAGE onto a Millipore Immobilin PSQ polyvinylidene difluoride membrane in 10 mm CAPS, 6% methanol at 175 mA for 3 h and subjected to NH2 -terminal amino acid sequencing, revealing a sequence of SLTIGL- corresponding to proteolytic cleavage after amino acid residue Phe-473. A 50-μl sample of the digest was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 50 μl of 2.5% mutan suspension. The sample was centrifuged for 2 min at 15,000 × g. A 30-μl volume of supernatant was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Novex 4–20%). Controls without mutan were included. Purified wild-type T. harzianum mutanase displayed a molecular mass of 75 kDa both in SDS-PAGE and MALDI-MS. Carbohydrate composition analysis revealed only glucose and mannose but no N-acetylglucosamine, indicatingO-glycosylation. The amount of glucose and mannose (18 and 32 mol/mol enzyme, respectively) accounts for over 8 kDa which, added to the theoretical mass (63.8 kDa), gives a molecular mass of about 72 kDa in close agreement with the 75 kDa measured by MALDI-MS and SDS-PAGE. To obtain a cDNA probe for theT. harzianum mutanase, two oligonucleotides based on a genomic mutanase clone from T. harzianum (10.Aizo, M., Otoko, S., Miki, T., Soichiro, M., Junichi, M., and Minoru, O. (1992) Japanese Patent Application JP1992058889-A1Google Scholar) were designed. These primers were used to amplify a mutanase cDNA fragment fromT. harzianum first-strand cDNA employing the PCR technique (28.Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4341) Google Scholar). Sequencing of the subcloned PCR fragment revealed a 387-bp cDNA with an open reading frame of 129 amino acids. In addition to the primer-encoded residues, the ORF was identical to the corresponding region in the T. harzianum mutanase amino acid sequence (10.Aizo, M., Otoko, S., Miki, T., Soichiro, M., Junichi, M., and Minoru, O. (1992) Japanese Patent Application JP1992058889-A1Google Scholar), confirming that the PCR had specifically amplified the desired cDNA species. Approximately 10,000 colonies from a T. harzianum cDNA library in E. coli were screened using the mutanase-specific PCR product as a probe. This yielded 12 positive clones with inserts ranging from 0.8 to 2.0 kilobase. These were further analyzed by sequencing the ends of the cDNAs with forward and reverse pYES polylinker primers, and determining the nucleotide sequence of the longest cDNA from both strands with synthetic oligonucleotide primers. The nucleotide sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence of the mutanase cDNA from T. harzianum are presented in Fig. 1. The 2062-bp cDNA clone contains a 1905-bp open reading frame initiating with an ATG codon at nucleotide position 29 and terminating with a TAG stop codon at nucleotide position 1931, thus predicting a 634-residue polypeptide. The open reading frame is preceded by a 28-bp 5′-noncoding region and followed by a 119-bp 3′-noncoding region and a poly(A) tail. Southern blotting experiments indicated that the T. harzianum mutanase cDNA could be used as a probe to identify mutanase gene-specific fragments in P. purpurogenum genomic DNA (data not shown). Consequently, a genomic library was constructed from P. purpurogenum cellular DNA using the bacteriophage vector λ- ZipLox. Approximately 45,000 plaques from this library were screened by hybridization using a segment of the T. harzianum mutanase cDNA as the probe. Eighteen positive clones which hybridized strongly to the probe were picked and 10 were plaque-purified (18.Davis R.W. Botstein D. Roth J.R. Advanced Bacterial Genetics, a Manual for Genetic Engineering. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1980Google Scholar) and excised from the λ cloning vector using thein vivo excision protocol (19.D'Alessio J.M. Bebee R. Hartley J.L. Noon M.C. Polayes D. (Life Technologies Inc.)Focus®. 1992; 14: 76Google Scholar). Preliminary restriction mapping on one of the pZL1-mutanase clones (designated pZL-Pp6A) revealed that the region which hybridized to the T. harzianum mutanase cDNA was localized near one end of a 3.6-kilobase genomic DNA insert (not shown). DNA sequencing of a portion of this segment showed an open reading frame with clear homology to the T. harzianum mutanase cDNA and its deduced amino acid sequence (Fig. 2). The positions of introns and exons within the P. purpurogenummutanase gene were assigned based on alignments of the deduced amino acid sequences to the corresponding T. harzianum mutanase gene product. On the basis of this comparison, the P. purpurogenum mutanase gene is composed of five exons (126, 532, 226, 461, and 548 bp) which are punctuated by four small introns (63, 81, 58, and 78 bp). These appear to be typical fungal introns with respect to size and composition in that all contain consensus splice donor and acceptor sequences as well as the consensus lariat sequence (PuCTPuAC) near the 3′ end of each intervening sequence (29.Gurr S.J. Unkles S.E. Kinghorn J.R. Kinghorn J.R. Gene Structure in Eukaryotic Microbes. IRL Press, O"
https://openalex.org/W2079392615,"The role of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathways in the interleukin-6 (IL-6)-induced morphological differentiation of PC12-E2 cells was assessed using wild type and dominant negative mutants of Stat1 and Stat3, containing Tyr → Phe (YF), Ser → Ala (SA), and the double mutations (DM), respectively. FS3-YF or FS3-DM markedly inhibited the IL-6-induced response, but overexpression of FS3-SA caused only a modest inhibition. Expression of all Stat3 mutants had no effect on NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. Overexpression of wild type Stat1 protein inhibited IL-6 activated DNA binding complexes containing Stat3 homodimers, which may explain the partial negative effect of Stat1 on IL-6-induced neurite outgrowth. Specificity of these STAT constructs was confirmed using luciferase reporter gene assays, which showed that IL-6-activated transcription was blocked by expression of FS3-YF and FS3-DM and that FS1 enhanced the interferon γ-activated transcription. Thus, in PC12-E2 cells, Stat3 homodimers are preferentially activated by IL-6, indicating a role for Stat3 in the regulation of cellular differentiation. Furthermore, IL-6 induced robust neurite outgrowth in PC12-E2 cells expressing dominant negative forms of RAS or SHC or in cells pretreated with the mitogen-activated protein kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor, PD98059. Thus, activation of the Stat3 signaling pathway, but not RAS/ERK dependent pathways, is essential for differentiation of PC12-E2 cells by IL-6.

Most cytokines activate Jak/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1signaling pathways, which are indispensable in the regulation of various cellular programs (1.Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3330) Google Scholar, 2.Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Jaks are cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase effectors that are activated by ligand-receptor interactions, leading to the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the cytoplasmic transcription factors, STATs, which then translocate to the nucleus and act on target gene transcription. To date, genes for four kinases of the Jak family and seven mammalian STATs have been identified, which may be activated individually or in combination (5.Leonard W.J. O'Shea John J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 293-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar). However, STAT pathways are not found exclusively in cytokine signal transduction and thus are also important for several growth factor-activated tyrosine kinase receptor-mediated mechanisms. Recent studies using Jak- or STAT-deficient mice have assigned specific cellular functions to most of these signaling components (6.Chen E.H. Gadina M. Galon J. Chen M. O'Shea John J. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 338-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). For example, Jak1 has been shown to be essential for signaling by gp130-containing cytokine receptors (7.Rodig S.J. Meraz M.A. White J.M. Lampe P.A. Riley J.K. Arthur C.D. King K.L. Sheehan K.C.

Blood. 1997; 90: 3996-4003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the STATs also have specific roles in cell regulation. Stat1 is essential for interferon signaling and innate response to viral and bacterial infection (11.Durbin J.E. Hackenmiller R. Simon M.C. Levy D.E. Cell. 1996; 84: 443-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar), while Stat5a is associated with the mammary gland development (6.Chen E.H. Gadina M. Galon J. Chen M. O'Shea John J. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 338-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In contrast, Stat3 is critical for embryonic development; Stat3-deficient mice die before gastrulation (12.Takeda K. Noguchi K. Shi W. Tanaka T. Matsumoto M. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3801-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). Interleukin-6 (IL-6) belongs to a cytokine subfamily, whose members include ciliary neurotrophic factor, leukemia inhibitory factor, interleukin-11, oncostatin M, and cardiotrophin-1 and which share a common signal transducing molecule, gp130, in their respective receptor complexes (13.Hirano T. Int. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 249-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Unlike tyrosine kinase receptors, IL-6 receptor α subunit (IL-6Rα) does not possess intrinsic tyrosine kinase activities. Rather, binding of IL-6 to IL-6Rα triggers the association and dimerization of the signal-transducing component gp130. As with most cytokines capable of inducing multiple cellular functions, accumulating evidence suggests that this subfamily of cytokines signaling through gp130 is involved in neuronal regulation in addition to its well established functions in hematopoiesis, immune, and inflammatory responses. Ciliary neurotrophic factor and leukemia inhibitory factor are involved in the neuronal differentiation and regeneration as well as cell fate determination (14.Patterson P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7833-7835Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 15.Ip N.Y. Boulton T.G. Li Y. Verdi J.M. Birren S.J. Anderson D.J. Yancopoulos G.D.

Although not as well established, IL-6 has also been implicated as a potential regulatory agent in the nervous system (18.Zhong J. Dietzel I.D. Wahle P. Kopf M. Heumann R. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4305-4313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Murphy P.G. Borthwick L.S. Johnston R.S. Kuchel G. Richardson P.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 3791-3800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both IL-6 and its ligand binding subunit IL-6Rα are expressed and localized in discrete areas of the central nervous system (20.Hopkins S.J. Rothwell N.J. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 83-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). In addition, they are synthesized and secreted in both central and peripheral nervous tissues in response to inflammatory stimuli or other environmental insults (21.Marz P. Gadient R.A. Otten U.

Moreover, it has been shown that IL-6 prevents cell death and promotes survival in some cerebral neurons as well as cultured sympathetic neurons (21.Marz P. Gadient R.A. Otten U.

IL-6 may also play a potential role in neuronal cell differentiation or regeneration (18.Zhong J. Dietzel I.D. Wahle P. Kopf M. Heumann R. J.

We have reported that it is capable of inducing morphological differentiation in PC12 variant E2 cells or in PC12 cells previously exposed to nerve growth factor (NGF) or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (primed) but not native PC12 cells. Furthermore, a synergistic induction of neurite proliferation and neuronal specific genes was observed by treatment of either wild type or variant cells with combinations of subthreshold concentrations of IL-6 and NGF or epidermal growth factor (EGF) (33.Wu Y.Y. Bradshaw R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13033-13039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Recent reports by others also suggest an involvement of IL-6 in morphological differentiation by different PC12 variants under various treatment conditions (34.Ihara S. Iwamatsu A. Fujiyoshi T. Komi A. Yamori T. Fukui Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 865-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 35.Ihara S. Nakajima K. Fukada T. Hibi M. Nagata S. Hirano T. Fukui Y.

In previous studies, the differentiative response of PC12-E2 or primed PC12 cells to IL-6 was shown to be largely independent of the activation of the RAS/ERK pathway (32.Wu Y.Y. Bradshaw R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13023-13032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), which is required for the same response to NGF and bFGF (39.Traverse S. Gomez N. Paterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 40.Kaplan D.R. Prog. Brain Res. 1998; 117: 35-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Instead, it was observed that IL-6 predominantly activates Stat3 and to a lesser extent the Stat1 signaling pathway. IL-6 did induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK, but the activation was found to be transient and very weak compared with that produced by NGF, bFGF, or even EGF. In contrast, Iharaet al. (35.Ihara S. Nakajima K. Fukada T. Hibi M. Nagata S. Hirano T. Fukui Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5345-5352Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) have reported that the Stat3 stimulated by IL-6 in PC12 cells pretreated with NGF (1–2 h) is actually inhibitory of differentiation and that the positive responses observed are via gp130-mediated activation of ERKs. To resolve these conflicting mechanisms and to further evaluate the contributions of these intracellular signaling pathways to IL-6-induced morphological differentiation of PC12-E2 cells, PC12-E2 cells overexpressing dominant negative variants of Stat1, Stat3, and p21 ras proteins were examined. The results clearly demonstrate that activation of the Stat3, and not the RAS/ERK, pathway is involved in the neurite proliferative response to IL-6. Thus, these signaling pathways act in a substantially similar way and are positive stimulators of PC12 cell differentiation. Stable PC12 variant E2 cells characterized by more rapid responses to NGF and bFGF and markedly more robust responses to IL-6 were isolated from the parental PC12 line as described previously (41.Wu Y.Y. Bradshaw R.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 164: 522-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained as monolayer cultures in 162-cm2 tissue culture flasks (Costar, Cambridge, MA) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated horse serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 5% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (complete medium) in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Cells were subcultured once a week by shaking the flask and replating in a 1:4 to 1:6 ratio. The medium was changed every 3 days. The human kidney 293 cells expressing the adenovirus large T antigen (293T) (42.Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Cells were subcultured once a week by trypsinization and replating in a 1:3 ratio. A FLAG epitope tag was introduced at the 5′ end of the full-length rat Stat1 and Stat3 cDNAs (43.Ripperger J.A. Fritz S. Richter K. Hocke G.M. Lottspeich F. Fey G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29998-30006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. G. H. Fey, University of Erlangen-Nurnberg, Federal Republic of Germany) by polymerase chain reaction. FLAG-rSTAT1 (FS1) or FLAG-rSTAT3 (FS3) cloned into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of the pCMV-1 expression vector was used as template for oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (44.Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides used for the relevant mutations were as follows: FLAG-rStat3-S727A (FS1-SA), 5′-TGCGGGGGGCCATGGCAG-3′; FLAG-rStat3-Y705F (FS1-YF), 5′-GTCTTCAGGAAAGGGGCAG-3′; FLAG-rStat1-S727A (FS1-SA), 5′-CCTCTGGAGCCATGGGAAG-3′; FLAG-rStat1-Y701F (FS1-YF), 5′-GTCTTGATGAATCCAGTTC-3′, respectively. The double mutants (FS3-DM and FS1-DM) contained both Tyr → Phe and Ser → Ala mutations. Each mutation generated within FS1 and FS3 was verified by double-stranded DNA sequencing using Sequenase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with gene-specific primers. To serve as a control construct for the immunocytochemistry experiment, protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) (45.Edman J.C. Ellis L. Blacher R.W. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Nature. 1985; 317: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar) was tagged at the 5′ end with FLAG epitope (FPDI) and cloned into theEcoRI and BamHI sites of pCMV-1 vector. To verify the expression and the specificity of the wild type and mutant STAT proteins, 10 μg each of the STAT cDNA construct and the rat IL-6Rα (ATCC 63082, PRIL6RC.6; cloned into pCMV1) were transiently transfected into 293T cells grown on 100-mm dishes using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method (46.Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). A preliminary immunoblotting experiment suggested that 293T cells do not express a detectable level of IL-6Rα. Cells were incubated with the precipitates for 12 h and continued in culture in fresh complete medium overnight. Cells were then stimulated with human recombinant IL-6 (20 ng/ml; a generous gift from Amgen, Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA) for 15 min. Preparation of 293T cell lysates, immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged proteins with M5 monoclonal antibodies, and immunoblot analyses were performed essentially as described previously (32.Wu Y.Y. Bradshaw R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13023-13032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of expression of dominant negative RAS on protein tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK, cells were grown in complete medium for 1 day and changed to low serum media overnight before stimulation with NGF (100 ng/ml) for 5 min or IL-6 (30 ng/ml) for 15 min. For the effect of MAPKK inhibitor on protein tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK, PC12-E2 cells were pretreated with PD98059 (a gift from Parke-Davis, Ann Arbor, MI) for 1 h before stimulation with NGF or IL-6 as described above. The following antibodies were used in this study: mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (M5; Eastman Kodak Co.); mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY); anti-pan-ERK monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY); rabbit polyclonal anti-GST antibody and anti-Stat3 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); Anti-active MAPKTMpolyclonal antibody (Promega, Madison, WI); rabbit polyclonal anti-Phospho-Stat3(Ser727) antibody (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA); and rat monoclonal anti-p21 ras (259) antibody (Oncogene Science, Cambridge, MA). PC12-E2 cells were grown on rat tail collagen-coated glass coverslips in six-well plates and transfected with 6 μg of DNA using Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After incubation for 5 h in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies), cells were allowed to recover for 24 h in complete medium and then treated with IL-6 (30 ng/ml) or NGF (100 ng/ml) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% horse serum (low serum medium) for 40 h. Immunostaining of PC12-E2 cells following growth factor stimulation was performed essentially as described previously (47.Thomas D. Bradshaw R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22293-22299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For cells transfected with FLAG-tagged constructs, cells were incubated with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M5) overnight at 4 °C followed by rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) for 2 h and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated (FITC) goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 2 h at room temperature. Immunostained cells were identified under an epifluorescence-equipped microscope, and responsive cells were scored as cells extending neurites at least two cell bodies in length. Preparation of crude nuclear extracts and EMSA were performed as described previously (32.Wu Y.Y. Bradshaw R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13023-13032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The Stat1 reporter gene construct, pTAL-LucGAS, was constructed by inserting four copies of an annealed oligonucleotide corresponding to the GAS element from the murine LY-6E gene (48.Khan K.D. Shuai K. Lindwall G. Maher S.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Bothwell A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6806-6810Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) into the KpnI andXmaI sites upstream of the thymidine kinase minimal promoter of the luciferase reporter vector pTAL-Luc (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The Stat3 reporter gene construct pLucTKS3, containing seven copies of the human C-reactive protein gene acute-phase responsive element, was a generous gift from Dr. Jove (H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa Bay, Florida) (49.Turkson J. Bowman T. Garcia R. Caldenhoven E. De Groot R.P. Jove R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2545-2552Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). PC12-E2 cells were grown on rat tail collagen-coated six-well plates and transfected with a mixture of plasmids containing STAT reporter constructs (4 μg), pRL-null, aRenilla luciferase expression plasmid (1 μg; Promega), and dominant negative STAT constructs (Stat3 constructs, 4 μg; Stat1 constructs, 2 μg) using Lipofectin reagent as described above. After 48 h, cells were stimulated with or without IL-6 (30 ng/ml) or rat interferon γ (10 ng/ml; Life Technologies) for 6 h, lysed, and assayed for luciferase activities using the Dual Luciferase Reporter (DLRTM) Assay System according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Luciferase activities were normalized to the internal control Renilla luciferase activity. Dominant negative ras cDNA (v-Ha-ras-Asn17) was subcloned into pCMV-Hygro expression vector (kindly provided by Dr. Eric Stanbridge, University of California, Irvine) and used to transfect PC12-E2 cells using Lipofectin reagent to generate stable cell lines. One day following transfection, hygromycin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added to the culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% horse serum), and selection was carried out for 3 weeks until individual colonies could be selected and screened for p21 ras expression. Using immunoblotting analysis, two clones (DN-RAS12 and DN-RAS27) with high expression level and one clone with mock transfection (Hygro-CMV) were selected for further studies. The neurite outgrowth assay was performed as described previously (32.Wu Y.Y. Bradshaw R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13023-13032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). For the induction of neurite outgrowth in cells expressing dominant negative RAS proteins, cells were grown in complete medium for 6 h and changed to low serum medium with the addition of IL-6 (30 ng/ml) or NGF (100 ng/ml) for 1–4 days. For the effect of MAPKK inhibitor PD98059 on neurite outgrowth, PC12-E2 cells were grown in complete medium for 16 h, changed to low serum medium, and pretreated with PD98059 (0 to 30 μm) for 1 h before the addition of IL-6, NGF, or no factors (control) for 24 h. The percentage of responsive cells was scored. Results from previous studies have suggested that IL-6 stimulates neurite proliferation in PC12-E2 cells by a mechanism that is substantially independent of RAS/ERK and that the response is most likely mediated by activation of Jak/STAT pathways (32.Wu Y.Y. Bradshaw R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13023-13032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, Iharaet al. (35.Ihara S. Nakajima K. Fukada T. Hibi M. Nagata S. Hirano T. Fukui Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5345-5352Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) found STAT activation to be inhibitory of PC12 cell differentiation. To better resolve the role of Jak/STAT pathways in IL-6-induced neurite proliferation, various dominant negative mutants of Stat1 and Stat3 proteins were introduced into PC12-E2 cells, and their effects were tested. The properties and effectiveness of several dominant negative forms of Stat1 and Stat3 have been previously characterized (50.Kim H. Baumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14571-14579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 51.Minami M. Inoue M. Wei S. Takeda K. Matsumoto M. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the present study, these inhibitors were prepared by mutating a single tyrosine residue to phenylalanine (YF), a single serine residue to alanine (SA), or a combination of both (DM), using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. The cDNA constructs generated, including wild type rat Stat3 (FS3) and rat Stat1 (FS1) and dominant negative forms (FS3-YF, FS3-SA, FS3-DM, FS1-YF, FS1-SA, and FS1-DM), were tagged at the 5′ end with a FLAG epitope. Expression and integrity of the wild type and mutated STATs were first verified by transiently transfecting each construct into human embryonic kidney 293T cells co-expressing rat IL-6Rα (Fig.1). Anti-Stat3 and anti-Stat1 immunoblots of anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates from 293T cell lysates suggest that all constructs were expressed robustly and at a similar level in 293T cells. Anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-phospho-Stat3(Ser727) blots show that stimulation with IL-6 results in tyrosine phosphorylation of FS3 and an increased serine phosphorylation (Fig.1 A). It is also noted that serine phosphorylation of Stat3 proteins results in a reduced mobility of FS3 as compared with FS3-SA shown on the phosphotyrosine blot. When FS3 protein, in which Tyr705 is replaced by phenylalanine (FS3-YF or FS3-DM) was expressed, no tyrosine phosphorylation was detected after IL-6 stimulation. When Ser727 on FS3 protein was replaced by an alanine residue (FS3-SA or FS3-DM), no serine phosphorylation was detected in the presence or absence of IL-6 stimulation. Similarly, FS1 was phosphorylated on tyrosine after IL-6 stimulation (Fig.1 B). However, no tyrosine phosphorylation was detected in FS1 containing a phenylalanine at position 701 (FS1-YF or FS1-DM). Mutation of Ser727 to alanine was confirmed by double-stranded DNA sequencing. To determine if neurite outgrowth induced by IL-6 is mediated by activation of the Jak/STAT pathway, dominant negative STAT constructs were transiently introduced into PC12-E2 cells. Cells expressing recombinant proteins were identified by immunostaining with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody, rabbit anti-mouse IgG, and FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody and examined under an epifluorescent microscope (Fig. 2). IL-6 and NGF induced 72.2 ± 1.1 and 78.6 ± 2.2% responsive cells in neurite outgrowth assay, respectively, in PC12-E2 cells transfected with the control construct, FPDI (Fig.3). Overexpressing wild type FS3 does not significantly affect neurite outgrowth induced by either NGF or IL-6. In contrast, neurite outgrowth induced by IL-6 is greatly inhibited in cells overexpressing FS3-YF, but there is no effect on NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. The FS3-SA mutant can be phosphorylated on Tyr705, forming homodimers or dimers with endogenous STATs, and translocated to the nucleus. Although they may bind DNA, the transcriptional efficiency is apparently less than the homodimers of the wild type Stat3. Expression of FS3-SA produces a weak inhibitory effect on IL-6-induced neurite formation (reduced by about 30%), but, as with FS3-YF, NGF-induced neurite outgrowth is not affected. Expression of FS3-DM produces complete inhibition of the IL-6-induced neurite proliferation. Responsive cells were reduced to control level. Again, NGF-induced neurite outgrowth was not affected by the expression of FS3-DM. These results clearly suggest that the activation of Stat3 pathway is essential for IL-6 to induce morphological differentiation of PC12-E2 cells.Figure 3The effect"
https://openalex.org/W2035881741,"In lower eukaryotic organisms, the loss of serine/threonine protein phosphatase type 1 (PP1) results in growth arrest after the onset of mitosis. In humans, four highly homologous isoforms of PP1 (PP1α, PP1δ, PP1γ1, and PP1γ2) have been identified. Determining the roles of these phosphatases, however, has proven difficult due to the lack of subtype-specific inhibitors. In this study, we developed chimeric antisense 2′-O-(2-methoxy)ethylphosphothioate oligonucleotides targeting human PP1γ1 that specifically inhibit PP1γ1 gene expression. Two potent antisense oligonucleotides (ISIS 14435 and 14439; IC50 ∼ 50 nm) were then employed to elucidate the cellular functions of PP1γ1 during cell cycle progression. In A549 cells, the inhibition of PP1γ1 expression resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of cellular proliferation, with growth arrest occurring after ∼36–48 h, when PP1γ1 mRNA expression was inhibited by >85%. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis revealed that ISIS 14435/14439-induced growth arrest was associated with an increase in the number of cells containing 4N DNA. Immunostaining of treated cells revealed that the inhibition of PP1γ1 expression had no apparent effect on the formation of mitotic spindles. However, decreased expression was associated with the failure of cell division in a late stage of cytokinesis and the formation of dikaryons.

Based on a comparison of their primary amino acid sequences, these mammalian PPases can be placed into five distinct subfamilies termed PP1, PP2A (which includes PP4 and PP6), PP2B, PP5, and PP7 (6.Cohen P.T.W.

The PP1, PP2A, and PP5 families of PPases are all sensitive to inhibition by okadaic acid, while PP2B, PP2C, and PP7 are resistant to inhibition (1.Cohen P. Holmes C.F.B. Tsukitani Y. Trends Biochem.

In Schizosaccharomyces pombe,Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Aspergillus nidulans, mutations in the genes encoding PPases homologous to mammalian PP1 result in abnormalities during mitosis or the completion of anaphase (27.Ohkura H. Kinoshita N. Miyatani S. Toda T. Yanagida M. Cell. 1989; 57: 997-1007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 28.Ohkura H. Yanagida M.S.

Thus, PP1 is believed to play an essential role in the progression through mitosis, possibly contributing to the regulation of a mitotic/spindle checkpoint control mechanism. This theory is supported by genetic experiments in Drosophila, studies of microtubule dynamics during the transitions into and out of mitosis in Xenopus egg extracts, and studies with PP1-neutralizing antibodies in rat embryo fibroblasts, which all indicate that PP1 activity is necessary for the completion of mitosis (32.Axton J.M Dombradi V. Cohen P.T. Glover D.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 33-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 33.Fernandez A. Brautigan D.L. Lamb N.J. J.

J. 1997; 16: 5537-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar).In mammals, there are four highly homologous isoforms of PP1 (PP1α, PP1δ, PP1γ1, and PP1γ2). These isoforms share >89% identity and are encoded by three distinct genes, with PP1γ1 and PP1γ2 produced from the alternative splicing of the same primary transcript (6.Cohen P.T.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 245-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 35.Sasaki K. Shima H. Kitagawa Y. Irino S. Sugimura T. Nagao M. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1990; 81: 1272-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). PP1γ2 is highly enriched in testis, while PP1α, PP1δ, and PP1γ1 are expressed in most, if not all, tissues. The functions of the individual isoforms are unknown, and no type-selective inhibitors of PP1 have been identified to date. Furthermore, due to the high degree of homology, it is impossible to draw conclusions about the roles of mammalian PP1 isoforms from comparative studies in lower eukaryotes. To study the role of individual PP1 isoforms in the regulation of cell cycle progression, in the present study we developed antisense oligonucleotides targeting PP1γ1 that specifically inhibit PP1γ1 gene expression in human cells. Using these antisense oligonucleotides, we demonstrate that the expression of PP1γ1 is necessary for A549 cell proliferation and that the inhibition of PP1γ1 expression leads to the formation of dikaryons following the failure of cytokinesis.DISCUSSIONIn eukaryotic organisms, cell cycle progression is regulated to a large extent by the reversible phosphorylation of proteins. Therefore, deciphering the complex mechanisms controlling the activity of the cellular kinases and phosphatases that participate in the control of cell cycle progression is a major challenge for understanding both normal and aberrant cellular proliferation. Determining the roles of individual PPases in human cells, however, has proven difficult due to the lack of truly specific inhibitors. To overcome this difficulty, in the present study we developed antisense oligonucleotides (ISIS 14435 and ISIS 14439) that potently inhibit the expression of human PP1γ1 without having an affect on the expression of other structurally related PPases (i.e. PP1α, PP1δ, PP2A, PP4, or PP5). These antisense oligonucleotides provided us with the ability to study the roles of a single PP1 isoform in human cells.In mammals, there are four isoforms of PP1 (PP1α, PP1δ, PP1γ1, and PP1γ2), whereas in lower eukaryotes, PP1 homologues are apparently encoded by fewer genes. Studies in yeast indicate that PP1 plays an essential role in the normal progression through mitosis. In fission yeast, S. pombe, two genes (sds21 anddis2 + /bws1 +) encode PPases homologous to the catalytic subunit of mammalian PP1 (27.Ohkura H. Kinoshita N. Miyatani S. Toda T. Yanagida M. Cell. 1989; 57: 997-1007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 28.Ohkura H. Yanagida M.S.

Mutants containing the semidominant dis2–11 allele of the major PP1 isoform enter, but fail to exit, mitosis (27.Ohkura H. Kinoshita N. Miyatani S. Toda T. Yanagida M. Cell. 1989; 57: 997-1007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Loss-of-function mutations in both of these genes arrest cell growth in mitosis at the restrictive temperature, with the cells having condensed, unseparated chromosomes and short mitotic spindles (28.Ohkura H. Yanagida M.S. Cell. 1991; 64: 149-157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 42.Sassoon I. Severin F.F. Andrews P.D. Taba M.R. Kaplan K.B. Ashford A.J. Stark M.J.R. Sorger P.K. Hyman A.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, a single essential gene (GLC7) encodes the catalytic subunit of PP1 (30.Kinoshita N. Ohkura H. Yanagida M. Cell. 1990; 63: 405-415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 43.Hisamoto N. Sugimoto K. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3158-3165Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Glc7p mutants are capable of DNA replication; however, growth arrest occurs before the onset of anaphase, with Glcp7 mutants containing short mitotic spindles (30.Kinoshita N. Ohkura H. Yanagida M. Cell. 1990; 63: 405-415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 43.Hisamoto N. Sugimoto K. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3158-3165Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Recent studies into the reasons for mitotic arrest produced by the absence of functional PP1 revealed thatglc7–10-induced mitotic arrest is abolished in spindle checkpoint mutants (44.Ishii K. Kumada K. Toda T. Yanagida M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6629-6640Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The glc7–10 mutants exhibit low kinetocore-microtubule binding activity and hyperphosphorylated Ndc10p, suggesting that defects in kinetocore-microtubule interactions caused by the hyperphosphorylation of kineticore proteins activate a spindle checkpoint (44.Ishii K. Kumada K. Toda T. Yanagida M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6629-6640Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Studies with temperature-sensitive mutant strains ofA. nidulans indicate that PP1 (the bimG gene product) is also required for normal mitotic spindle formation and the completion of anaphase in filamentous fungi (31.Doonan J.H. Morris N.R. Cell. 1989; 57 (1989): 987-996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Similarly, genetic experiments suggest that one of the of PP1 isoforms inDrosophila is essential for mitosis (32.Axton J.M Dombradi V. Cohen P.T. Glover D.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 33-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Results from studies of microtubule dynamics during the transitions into and out of mitosis in Xenopus egg extracts and studies with PP1-neutralizing antibodies in rat embryo fibroblasts also indicate that PP1 activity is necessary for the completion of mitosis in higher eukaryotes (33.Fernandez A. Brautigan D.L. Lamb N.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1421-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 34.Tournebize R. Andersen S.S. Verde F. Doree M. Karsenti E. Hyman A.A. EMBO. J. 1997; 16: 5537-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar).To characterize the cellular roles of individual human PP1 isoforms and to determine if PP1γ1 is necessary for the completion of mitosis in human cells, we treated A549 cells with ISIS 14435 and 14439 at concentrations that inhibited the expression of PP1γ1. These studies indicated that the inhibition of PP1γ1 expression inhibits cell proliferation. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of the treated cells revealed an increase in the number of cells containing 4N DNA. However, immunostaining to detect microtubules revealed no apparent abnormalities in the formation of mitotic spindles. In addition, there was no indication of growth arrest in mitosis or prior to the completion of anaphase. Therefore, it is likely that an isoform other then PP1γ1 is necessary for the transition into or out of mitosis. Nonetheless, in A549 cells, when PP1γ1 expression is suppressed cell division often fails. This failure is characterized by a delay in cytokinesis after the formation of the contractile ring and a deep cleavage furrow. Analysis of >1000 cells in which PP1γ1 expression was inhibited by >85% revealed that ∼41% of the growth-arrested cells then progress to become dikaryons, which preliminary studies suggest occurs when the contractile ring “relaxes” and two apparently normal nuclei reform. Therefore, although additional studies are needed to clarify the role of PP1γ1 in human cells, it appears that PP1γ1 has an essential function that is necessary for the completion of cytokinesis.Although the molecular mechanisms regulating cytokinesis are poorly understood, other studies also suggest that the aberrant phosphorylation of proteins can impede the completion of cytokinesis. In NIH3T3 cells, the overexpression of p70 S6 kinase (p70s6k) produces a similar phenotype (i.e.incomplete cytokinesis leading to the formation of dikaryons cells (45.Sugiyama H. Papst P. Fujita M. Gelfand E.W. Terada N. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar)). Similarly, in Chinese hamster ovary cells, the overexpression of protein kinase Cδ, but not protein kinase Cα, protein kinase CβII, or protein kinase Cζ, produces cells with two nuclei following the inhibition of cell division in telophase (46.Watanabe T. Ono Y. Taniyama Y. Hazama K Igarashi K. Ogita K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10159-10163Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). When the activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) is maintained through the introduction of a mutant form of cyclin B that is not degraded, cytokinesis is also inhibited (47.Wheatley S.P. Hinchcliffe E.H. Glotzer M. Hyman A.A. Sluder G. Wang Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Although the inhibition of cytokinesis induced by prolonged CDK1 activity may be due to the inhibition of midzone microtubule formation or the phosphorylation of myosin II regulatory light chain (48), the precise reason(s) that aberrant or maintained activation of protein kinase Cδ or p70s6k inhibits cytokinesis are unclear. The mechanism(s) by which the inhibition of the PP1γ1 expression is translated to a failure in cytokinesis is also not clear. All of the above mentioned kinases are serine/threonine kinases, and the phosphorylation of microtubule-associated proteins and myosin that occurs during cytokinesis is dynamic and highly regulated. Therefore, the activity of PP1γ1 may be needed for the dephosphorylation of kinases involved in the phosphorylation of cytoskeletal components necessary for the completion of cytokinesis. Alternatively, PP1γ1 activity may be required at a more distal site, such as the ubiquitin degradation pathway that mediates cyclin B degradation. Clearly, additional studies will be required to determine the substrates utilized by PP1γ1 and how the regulation of PP1γ1 activity is coordinated with that of cellular proteins that regulate the onset and progression of cytokinesis. In eukaryotic cells, the reversible phosphorylation of proteins determines the biological activity of many protein complexes and is recognized as a major mechanism controlling cell cycle progression. Therefore, the protein kinases that mediate progression through the cell cycle have been extensively investigated. Because many of the protein kinases that play key roles in the regulation of cell cycle progression are Ser/Thr kinases, it seems logical that the regulation of serine/threonine protein phosphatase (PPase)1 activity will also contribute to growth control processes.

Based on a comparison of their primary amino acid sequences, these mammalian PPases can be placed into five distinct subfamilies termed PP1, PP2A (which includes PP4 and PP6), PP2B, PP5, and PP7 (6.Cohen P.T.W.

Studies designed to determine the roles of individual PPases in the control of cell cycle progression have been most successful in lower eukaryotes. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe,Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Aspergillus nidulans, mutations in the genes encoding PPases homologous to mammalian PP1 result in abnormalities during mitosis or the completion of anaphase (27.Ohkura H. Kinoshita N. Miyatani S. Toda T. Yanagida M. Cell. 1989; 57: 997-1007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 28.Ohkura H. Yanagida M.S.

Thus, PP1 is believed to play an essential role in the progression through mitosis, possibly contributing to the regulation of a mitotic/spindle checkpoint control mechanism. This theory is supported by genetic experiments in Drosophila, studies of microtubule dynamics during the transitions into and out of mitosis in Xenopus egg extracts, and studies with PP1-neutralizing antibodies in rat embryo fibroblasts, which all indicate that PP1 activity is necessary for the completion of mitosis (32.Axton J.M Dombradi V. Cohen P.T. Glover D.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 33-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 33.Fernandez A. Brautigan D.L. Lamb N.J. J.

J. 1997; 16: 5537-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In mammals, there are four highly homologous isoforms of PP1 (PP1α, PP1δ, PP1γ1, and PP1γ2). These isoforms share >89% identity and are encoded by three distinct genes, with PP1γ1 and PP1γ2 produced from the alternative splicing of the same primary transcript (6.Cohen P.T.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 245-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 35.Sasaki K. Shima H. Kitagawa Y. Irino S. Sugimura T. Nagao M. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1990; 81: 1272-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). PP1γ2 is highly enriched in testis, while PP1α, PP1δ, and PP1γ1 are expressed in most, if not all, tissues. The functions of the individual isoforms are unknown, and no type-selective inhibitors of PP1 have been identified to date. Furthermore, due to the high degree of homology, it is impossible to draw conclusions about the roles of mammalian PP1 isoforms from comparative studies in lower eukaryotes. To study the role of individual PP1 isoforms in the regulation of cell cycle progression, in the present study we developed antisense oligonucleotides targeting PP1γ1 that specifically inhibit PP1γ1 gene expression in human cells. Using these antisense oligonucleotides, we demonstrate that the expression of PP1γ1 is necessary for A549 cell proliferation and that the inhibition of PP1γ1 expression leads to the formation of dikaryons following the failure of cytokinesis. DISCUSSIONIn eukaryotic organisms, cell cycle progression is regulated to a large extent by the reversible phosphorylation of proteins. Therefore, deciphering the complex mechanisms controlling the activity of the cellular kinases and phosphatases that participate in the control of cell cycle progression is a major challenge for understanding both normal and aberrant cellular proliferation. Determining the roles of individual PPases in human cells, however, has proven difficult due to the lack of truly specific inhibitors. To overcome this difficulty, in the present study we developed antisense oligonucleotides (ISIS 14435 and ISIS 14439) that potently inhibit the expression of human PP1γ1 without having an affect on the expression of other structurally related PPases (i.e. PP1α, PP1δ, PP2A, PP4, or PP5). These antisense oligonucleotides provided us with the ability to study the roles of a single PP1 isoform in human cells.In mammals, there are four isoforms of PP1 (PP1α, PP1δ, PP1γ1, and PP1γ2), whereas in lower eukaryotes, PP1 homologues are apparently encoded by fewer genes. Studies in yeast indicate that PP1 plays an essential role in the normal progression through mitosis. In fission yeast, S. pombe, two genes (sds21 anddis2 + /bws1 +) encode PPases homologous to the catalytic subunit of mammalian PP1 (27.Ohkura H. Kinoshita N. Miyatani S. Toda T. Yanagida M. Cell. 1989; 57: 997-1007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 28.Ohkura H. Yanagida M.S.

Mutants containing the semidominant dis2–11 allele of the major PP1 isoform enter, but fail to exit, mitosis (27.Ohkura H. Kinoshita N. Miyatani S. Toda T. Yanagida M. Cell. 1989; 57: 997-1007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Loss-of-function mutations in both of these genes arrest cell growth in mitosis at the restrictive temperature, with the cells having condensed, unseparated chromosomes and short mitotic spindles (28.Ohkura H. Yanagida M.S. Cell. 1991; 64: 149-157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 42.Sassoon I. Severin F.F. Andrews P.D. Taba M.R. Kaplan K.B. Ashford A.J. Stark M.J.R. Sorger P.K. Hyman A.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, a single essential gene (GLC7) encodes the catalytic subunit of PP1 (30.Kinoshita N. Ohkura H.

Biol. 1994; 14: 3158-3165Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Glc7p mutants are capable of DNA replication; however, growth arrest occurs before the onset of anaphase, with Glcp7 mutants containing short mitotic spindles (30.Kinoshita N. Ohkura H. Yanagida M. Cell. 1990; 63: 405-415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 43.Hisamoto N. Sugimoto K. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3158-3165Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Recent studies into the reasons for mitotic arrest produced by the absence of functional PP1 revealed thatglc7–10-induced mitotic arrest is abolished in spindle checkpoint mutants (44.Ishii K. Kumada K. Toda T. Yanagida M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6629-6640Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The glc7–10 mutants exhibit low kinetocore-microtubule binding activity and hyperphosphorylated Ndc10p, suggesting that defects in kinetocore-microtubule interactions caused by the hyperphosphorylation of kineticore proteins activate a spindle checkpoint (44.Ishii K. Kumada K. Toda T. Yanagida M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6629-6640Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Studies with temperature-sensitive mutant strains ofA. nidulans indicate that PP1 (the bimG gene product) is also required for normal mitotic spindle formation and the completion of anaphase in filamentous fungi (31.Doonan J.H. Morris N.R. Cell. 1989; 57 (1989): 987-996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Similarly, genetic experiments suggest that one of the of PP1 isoforms inDrosophila is essential for mitosis (32.Axton J.M Dombradi V. Cohen P.T. Glover D.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 33-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Results from studies of microtubule dynamics during the transitions into and out of mitosis in Xenopus egg extracts and studies with PP1-neutralizing antibodies in rat embryo fibroblasts also indicate that PP1 activity is necessary for the completion of mitosis in higher eukaryotes (33.Fernandez A. Brautigan D.L. Lamb N.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1421-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 34.Tournebize R. Andersen S.S. Verde F. Doree M. Karsenti E. Hyman A.A. EMBO. J. 1997; 16: 5537-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar).To characterize the cellular roles of individual human PP1 isoforms and to determine if PP1γ1 is necessary for the completion of mitosis in human cells, we treated A549 cells with ISIS 14435 and 14439 at concentrations that inhibited the expression of PP1γ1. These studies indicated that the inhibition of PP1γ1 expression inhibits cell proliferation. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of the treated cells revealed an increase in the number of cells containing 4N DNA. However, immunostaining to detect microtubules revealed no apparent abnormalities in the formation of mitotic spindles. In addition, there was no indication of growth arrest in mitosis or prior to the completion of anaphase. Therefore, it is likely that an isoform other then PP1γ1 is necessary for the transition into or out of mitosis. Nonetheless, in A549 cells, when PP1γ1 expression is suppressed cell division often fails. This failure is characterized by a delay in cytokinesis after the formation of the contractile ring and a deep cleavage furrow. Analysis of >1000 cells in which PP1γ1 expression was inhibited by >85% revealed that ∼41% of the growth-arrested cells then progress to become dikaryons, which preliminary studies suggest occurs when the contractile ring “relaxes” and two apparently normal nuclei reform. Therefore, although additional studies are needed to clarify the role of PP1γ1 in human cells, it appears that PP1γ1 has an essential function that is necessary for the completion of cytokinesis.Although the molecular mechanisms regulating cytokinesis are poorly understood, other studies also suggest that the aberrant phosphorylation of proteins can impede the completion of cytokinesis. In NIH3T3 cells, the overexpression of p70 S6 kinase (p70s6k) produces a similar phenotype (i.e.incomplete cytokinesis leading to the formation of dikaryons cells (45.Sugiyama H. Papst P. Fujita M. Gelfand E.W. Terada N. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar)). Similarly, in Chinese hamster ovary cells, the overexpression of protein kinase Cδ, but not protein kinase Cα, protein kinase CβII, or protein kinase Cζ, produces cells with two nuclei following the inhibition of cell division in telophase (46.Watanabe T. Ono Y. Taniyama Y. Hazama K Igarashi K. Ogita K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10159-10163Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). When the activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) is maintained through the introduction of a mutant form of cyclin B that is not degraded, cytokinesis is also inhibited (47.Wheatley S.P. Hinchcliffe E.H. Glotzer M. Hyman A.A. Sluder G. Wang Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Although the inhibition of cytokinesis induced by prolonged CDK1 activity may be due to the inhibition of midzone microtubule formation or the phosphorylation of myosin II regulatory light chain (48), the precise reason(s) that aberrant or maintained activation of protein kinase Cδ or p70s6k inhibits cytokinesis are unclear. The mechanism(s) by which the inhibition of the PP1γ1 expression is translated to a failure in cytokinesis is also not clear. All of the above mentioned kinases are serine/threonine kinases, and the phosphorylation of microtubule-associated proteins and myosin that occurs during cytokinesis is dynamic and highly regulated. Therefore, the activity of PP1γ1 may be needed for the dephosphorylation of kinases involved in the phosphorylation of cytoskeletal components necessary for the completion of cytokinesis. Alternatively, PP1γ1 activity may be required at a more distal site, such as the ubiquitin degradation pathway that mediates cyclin B degradation. Clearly, additional studies will be required to determine the substrates utilized by PP1γ1 and how the regulation of PP1γ1 activity is coordinated with that of cellular proteins that regulate the onset and progression of cytokinesis. In eukaryotic organisms, cell cycle progression is regulated to a large extent by the reversible phosphorylation of proteins. Therefore, deciphering the complex mechanisms controlling the activity of the cellular kinases and phosphatases that participate in the control of cell cycle progression is a major challenge for understanding both normal and aberrant cellular proliferation.

The formation of secondary structures by the TRS on the newly synthesized lagging strand and the template of the lagging strand mediates the expansions and deletions, respectively, of these tracts in E. coli (6.Kang S. Jaworski A. Ohshima K. Wells R.D. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that expansions and deletions of the CGG·CCG, CTG·CAG, and GAA·TTC repeats can also be mediated by hairpin formation during continuous leading strand synthesis in vivo (9.Iyer R.R. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3865-3877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Repair-resistant hairpin structures were proposed to be formed in vivo by TRS in yeast (28.Moore H. Greenwell P.W. Liu C. Arnheim N. Petes T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1504-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The fidelity of DNA replication in E. coli is ∼10−10 errors/replicated base (29.Drake J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7160-7164Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 30.Schaaper R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23762-23765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This high fidelity of base incorporation is achieved in three steps, namely base selection by the DNA polymerase, the 3′ to 5′ exonucleolytic proofreading of the inserted bases, and postreplicative MMR. The contribution of proofreading to the overall fidelity is ∼10−2 (30.Schaaper R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23762-23765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proofreading function in E. coli is performed by the 3′ to 5′ exonucleolytic ε-subunit of DNA polymerase III, which is encoded by the dnaQ gene. Several alleles of the dnaQ gene includingdnaQ49 ts and mutD5 have been identified and studied (30.Schaaper R.M. J. Biol.

Strains containing thednaQ49 ts mutation are strong mutators. ThednaQ49 ts is a temperature-sensitive mutation that affects the physical interaction between the ε-subunit and the polymerizing α-subunit of DNA polymerase III, thereby destabilizing2 the replication fork (31.Takano K. Nakabeppu Y. Maki H. Horiuchi T. Sekiguchi M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 205: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 36.Jonczyk P. Nowicka A. Fijalkowska I. Schaaper R.M. Ciesla Z. J.

In addition, dnaQ49 ts strains have a defective exonucleolytic proofreading activity (38.Echols H. Lu C. Burgers P.M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2189-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). On the other hand,mutD5 impairs the exonuclease activity of the ε-subunit, also rendering it a strong mutator (32.Schaaper R.M. Genetics. 1989; 121: 205-212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Fijalkowska I.J. Schaaper R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2856-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Previous studies (39.Saveson C.J. Lovett S.T. Genetics. 1997; 146: 457-470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Bzymek M. Saveson C.J. Feschenko V.V. Lovett S.T. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 477-482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the dnaQ49 ts and themutD5 mutations enhance deletions between tandemly repeated DNA sequences in vivo in E. coli. Therefore, these mutants were used to analyze the effect of DNA polymerase III proofreading on TRS instabilities in vivo. Herein, we show that the instabilities of the long CGG·CCG and the CTG·CAG tracts are significantly enhanced by mutations that inactivate the proofreading system in E. coli. Substantial deletions of the TRS tracts are found on temperature inactivation of the proofreading exonuclease in the dnaQ49 tsstrain. Frequent expansions of the CTG·CAG repeats are observed in strains containing the mutD5 mutation. Thus, the functional proofreading exonuclease in E. coli probably removes slipped structures in the TRS tracts during replication, thereby significantly reducing the frequency of deletions and expansions. Fig. 1 lists the TRS-containing plasmids used in the study. pRW3320 (7.Shimizu M. Gellibolian R. Oostra B.A. Wells R.D. J. Mol.

Tracts containing 17, 98, and 175 CTG·CAG repeats were isolated by digesting pRW3244, pRW3246, and pRW3248 (6.Kang S. Jaworski A. Ohshima K. Wells R.D. Nat.

The inserts were ligated into the polylinker of the gene targeting vector pGS100 (41.Sargent R.G. Merrihew R.V. Nairn R. Adair G. Meuth M. Wilson J.H.

Clones containing the CTG·CAG repeats in orientations I and II were obtained (Fig. 1) and characterized by restriction mapping and sequencing.

Schaaper (NIEHS, National Institutes of Health, Research Triangle Park, NC). Plasmids containing undeleted TRS tracts were prepared as described previously (10.Bowater R.P. Rosche W.A. Jaworski A. Sinden R.R. Wells R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 82-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and transformed into the appropriate E. coli strain, which had been rendered competent. The transformation mixture was inoculated into 10-ml LB tubes containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at a cell density of 103 cells/ml. The cultures were grown at 25, 30, or 37 °C as appropriate with shaking at 250 rpm. At late log phase (A 600 ∼ 1.0 units), an aliquot of the culture was inoculated into a fresh tube containing 10 ml of LB (with ampicillin as before) at a final dilution of 10−7. Due to the variable rates of cell growth, the time periods required to achieve late log phase varied between the temperatures. The original culture was harvested, and the plasmid DNA was isolated by the standard alkaline lysis method (42.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Thus, the cells were propagated in log phase by repeated recultivation (shown in Figs.

Labeled NotI restriction fragments containing the triplet repeat tracts were separated on 5% polyacrylamide gels, which were dried and exposed to x-ray film and to a PhosphorImager screen for quantitation. Lanes 1–3 contain DNA isolated from cultures after 1–3 recultivations, respectively. The arrow indicates the band that contains the full-length triplet repeat. The deletion products migrate in the region encompassed by the open box. All of the (CGG·CCG)n-containing restriction fragments also carry 72 base pairs of nonrepetitive flanking sequence.A shows the analysis of the (CGG·CCG)81 tract in pRW3320 maintained in log phase for three recultivations in thednaQ49 ts and the CD4 (wild type) strains at 25, 30, and 37 °C. B, the extents of the instabilities of the (CGG·CCG)81 tracts were determined by scanning the PhosphorImager screen that had been exposed to the dried polyacrylamide gels shown in A. The percentage of the full-length TRS remaining in the sample was determined by measuring the signal intensity of the band representing the full-length TRS tract as a percentage of the total signal intensity in the lane.

After sterilization, the medium was supplemented with 1% dextrose, 10 μg/ml thiamine, and 100 μg/ml proline. pRW3320 and pRW3506 (Fig. 1) that contained undeleted TRS tracts were transformed into E. coli KA796 and NR9458 competent cells and inoculated into 10 ml of MM containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at a density of 103 transformed cells/ml. The cultures were propagated in MM by repeated recultivation and harvested as described above. The instabilities of the triplet repeat tracts were determined by measuring the relative amount of full-length triplet repeat insert in the plasmids after growth in the respective E. coli strains at the appropriate temperatures. The plasmids were digested with NotI to excise the triplet repeat containing insert, labeled with [α-32P]dGTP by end-filling with the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I (U. S.

The mutagenicity of thednaQ49 ts strain is low at 25 °C, intermediate at 30 °C, and high at 37 °C due to temperature inactivation of the proofreading apparatus. At the nonpermissive temperatures, thednaQ49 ts results in the destabilization of the physical interactions between the exonucleolytic ε-subunit and the polymerizing α-subunit of DNA polymerase III (36.Jonczyk P. Nowicka A. Fijalkowska I. Schaaper R.M. Ciesla Z. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1563-1566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 52.Maruyama M. Horiuchi T. Maki H. Sekiguchi M. J. Mol.

Therefore, recultivation assays of CGG·CCG repeat-containing plasmids were carried out in the wild type and mutant strains at 25, 30, and 37 °C. pRW3320 (Fig. 1), which contains (CGG·CCG)81 cloned into the polylinker of pUC19NotI in orientation I was propagated by repeated recultivation in log phase in E. coli strains NR9807 (dnaQ49 ts) and CD4 (wild type) at 25, 30, and 37 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After each recultivation, the cultures were harvested, and the plasmid DNAs were isolated and digested with NotI to excise the triplet repeat tract. The digested DNA was labeled and electrophoresed through 5% polyacrylamide gels. Fig. 2 Ashows the gel analyses of the CGG·CCG repeat tracts excised from pRW3320 grown in NR9807 (dnaQ49 ts) and CD4 (wild type) at the three temperatures. Quantitation of the deletion products (Fig. 2 B) revealed a substantial temperature-dependent destabilization of the CGG·CCG repeat tract in the dnaQ49 ts strain. Whereas at 25 °C the full-length TRS tract constituted 75, 45, and 22% after the first, second, and third recultivations, respectively, less than 5% of the full-length tract remained after three recultivations at 30 and 37 °C. In contrast, the CGG·CCG repeats maintained in the wild type strain showed similar extents of instabilities at all the three temperatures, and ∼50% of the full-length tract remained even after three recultivations. Even at 25 °C, the CGG·CCG repeat tracts are more unstable in the dnaQ49 ts than in the wild type strain. This is consistent with the observations of Fijalkowskaet al. (53.Fijalkowska I.J. Dunn R.L. Schaaper R.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7435-7445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that the dnaQ49 ts is a strong mutator at 25 °C. These experiments clearly show that the stability of the (CGG·CCG)81 tract is inversely proportional to the temperature in the dnaQ49 ts strain. Since the instabilities of the repeat tract in the wild type strain are similar at 25, 30, and 37 °C, the possibility of a direct effect of temperature on the instabilities can be conclusively ruled out. Thus, the destabilization of the (CGG·CCG)81 tract in pRW3320 in E. coli NR9807 (dnaQ49 ts) is due to the impairment of DNA polymerase III proofreading apparatus at the elevated temperatures. The instability of the CGG·CCG repeat tract depends on its length in fragile-X syndrome patients (54.Imbert G. Feng Y. Nelson D.L. Warren S.T. Mandel J.L. Wells R.D. Warren S.T. Genetic Instabilities and Hereditary Neurological Diseases. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1998: 27-53Google Scholar). Length-dependent instabilities of plasmid-borne CGG·CCG repeat tracts were also shown previously in E. coli (7.Shimizu M. Gellibolian R. Oostra B.A. Wells R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 6"

After maturation and hormone formation, TG is endocytosed and delivered to lysosomes. Quality control mechanisms may occur during this bidirectional traffic since 1) several molecular chaperones are cosecreted with TG in vivo, and 2) lysosomal targeting of immature TG is thought to be prevented via the interaction, in acidic conditions, between the Ser789–Met1172 TG hormonogenic domain (BD) and an unidentified membrane receptor. We investigated the secretion and cell surface expression of PDI and other chaperones in the FRTL5 thyroid cell line, and then studied the characteristics of the interaction between TG and PDI. We demonstrated that PDI, but also other chaperones such as calnexin and KDEL-containing proteins are exposed at the cell surface. We observed on living cells or membrane preparations that PDI specifically binds TG in acidic conditions, and that only BD is involved in binding. Surface plasmon resonance analysis of TG/PDI interactions indicated: 1) that PDI bound TG but only in acidic conditions, and that it preferentially recognized immature molecules, and 2) BD is involved in binding even if cysteine-rich modules are deleted. The notion that PDI acts as an “escort” for immature TG in acidic post-endoplasmic reticulum compartments is discussed.

The thyroid prohormone, thyroglobulin (TG),1 is synthesized by thyrocytes and then secreted into the follicular lumen in which the thyroid hormones themselves are synthesized. Hormonal secretion requires the endocytosis of mature TG (i.e. TG bearing hormone residues), its targeting to lysosomes, and the subsequent release of hormones. Each step of this bidirectional trafficking of TG is subject to regulation, in some cases mediated by molecular chaperones (1.Van Herle A.J. Vassart G. Dumont J.E. New Engl. J.

Glycosylation and chaperone-assisted folding of TG monomers (M r 330,000) take place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and involve several chaperones including calnexin, BiP, ERp72, grp94, and grp170 (5.Kim P.

The dimerization of monomers, a process thought to abolish the interactions between secreted molecules and chaperones, probably determines the sorting and targeting post-ER of glycoproteins (10.Doms R.W. Lamb R.A. Rose J.K. Helenius A. Virology. 1993; 193: 545-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The transit through the Golgi apparatus of newly synthesized TG leads to the modification of some high mannose type N-glycans intoN-acetyllactosamine chains. Secreted glycoproteins have an almost unique property, mediated by an unknown regulatory mechanism, in that some of these lactosamine chains of TG are incompletely processed and have accessible GlcNAc moieties (11.Consiglio E.

Fenouillet E. Thibault V. Miquelis R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4204-4209Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). TG molecules are then targeted to small secretory vesicles and released via the regulated secretory pathway of thyrocytes (13.Ericson L.E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1981; 22: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 14.Arvan P. Lee J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the follicular lumen, the prohormone undergoes several posttranslational modifications to produce thyroid hormones. These modifications include the iodination of tyrosyl residues, and the oxidative coupling of some of these residues to form triiodothyronine (T3) and tetraiodothyronine (thyroxine or T4) (1.Van Herle A.J. Vassart G. Dumont J.E. New Engl. J. Med. 1979; 301: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 2.Bjorkman U. Ekholm R. Greer M.A. Biochemistry of Thyroid Hormone Formation and Secretion. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1980: 88-125Google Scholar). They also include the de novo formation of disulfide bridges, the multimerization of some TG molecules (15.Edelhoch H. Eggo M.C. Burrow G.N. Thyroglobulin: The Prothyroid Hormone. Raven Press, New York1985: 1-12Google Scholar), and the progressive completion of their incompletely processed lactosamineN-glycans by the addition of galactose and sialic acid sugar moieties (12.Bastiani P. Papandreou M.J. Blanck O. Fenouillet E. Thibault V. Miquelis R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4204-4209Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). As TG molecules in the follicular lumen are very heterogeneous in terms of iodine and hormone content, it has been assumed that there is a mechanism that either preferentially targets iodine-rich molecules to lysosomes or prevents the catabolism of iodine-poor molecules. It has recently been reported that megalin, a 330-kDa glycoprotein associated with the cell surface, participates, at least partly, in TG internalization in some some thyroid cell preparations (16.Zheng G. Marino M. Zhao J. McCluskey R.T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1462-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 17.Marino M. Zheng G. McCluskey R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12898-12904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, further studies are required to determine whether this process is selective for a given TG subpopulation, and no receptor specific for mature thyroglobulin has yet been shown to be responsible for the selective internalization of TG. The notion of an intrafollicular retention process for immature molecules arose from three main findings: 1) there exists, in vivo in the rat, a major recycling pathway from internalized TG back to the lumen (18.Bastiani P. Simon C. Penel C. Acta Endocrinol. 1980; 94: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar); 2) during TG maturation, galactose and sialic acid are incorporated into some glycans (12.Bastiani P. Papandreou M.J. Blanck O. Fenouillet E. Thibault V. Miquelis R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4204-4209Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), by a process known to occur in the transcompartments of the Golgi complex and the trans-Golgi network (19.Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3779) Google Scholar), and 3) immature TG preferentially binds a membrane receptor in acidic conditions, suggesting that there may be a means of recycling TG after endocytosis, in acidic compartments such as the endosomes and prelysosomes (20.Miquelis R. Alquier C. Monsigny M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15291-15298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Mziaut H. Bastiani P. Balivet T. Papandreou M.J. Fert V. Errgragui K. Blanck O. Miquelis R. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1370-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The receptor involved in binding has not yet identified, but the receptor-binding domain of TG has been located within the hormonogenic domain (Ser789–Met1178) of TG, which includes tyrosine residues involved in hormone formation and a cysteine-rich type 1 module (22.Mezghrani H.

Recent reports have established that in secretory cells some chaperones are secreted or cell surface-associated. For example, calnexin as well as many other “ER resident proteins” are present at the surface of thymocytes (23.Wiest D.L. Bhandoola A. Punt J. Kreibich G. McKean D. Singer A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1884-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and grp94 is secreted by pancreatic cells (24.Bruneau N. Lombardo D. J. Biol.

The best documented example is the protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI). PDI (M r 57,000) is an abundant soluble cellular protein of the secretory pathway (0.4% of total liver protein, Refs.26.Noiva R.

It remains fully active and may be involved in structural modification of (glyco)proteins in the extracellular medium. Indeed, PDI catalyzes thiol-disulfide interchanges that may result in the rearrangement of protein-disulfide bonds. This is why cell-surface PDI is involved in the reduction of the disulfide-linked diphtheria toxin heterodimer (36.Mandel R. Ryser H.J.-P. Ghani F. Peak D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 91: 4559-4563Google Scholar), cell surface events triggering the entry of the human immunodeficiency virus into lymphoid cells (37.Ryser H.J.-P. Levy E. Mandel R. DiSciullo G.J. Proc. Natl.

Fitzgerald M. Grant C.M. Hogg P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2416-2423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). PDI, and some other chaperones such as BiP and grp94, are secreted with TG in in vivo conditions into the follicular lumen (41.Berndorfer U. Wilms H. Herzog V. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 1918-1926PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Delom F. Lejeune P.J. Vinet L. Carayon P. Mallet B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), suggesting that these chaperones may be involved in the structural modification of the prohormone in hormone biogenesis. We investigated the secretion and cell surface expression of PDI and other chaperones in the FRTL5 (thyroid) cell line, and then studied the characteristics of the interaction between TG or derived fusion proteins and PDI in FRTL5 cells. We report two key observations: 1) PDI is secreted and associated with membranes, which implies that it may be present in vivo in post-ER compartments; and 2) PDI interacts with the membrane-binding domain of TG in acidic compartments. The potential implications of these observations are discussed. Amplify, [35S]methionine/cysteine, Na125I, protein A-Sepharose, and PD10 columns were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; IODOGEN, bovine protein-disulfide isomerase, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), Sulfo-SHPP, and chemiluminescence kits and reagents (SuperSignal and SuperSignal Ultra) from Pierce. Porcine TG and TG-agarose were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Human TG (containing 1% iodine) was obtained from Scipac (Sittingbourne, United Kingdom). Human TG with a low iodine content from a patient with a single colloid goiter (2.8 iodine atoms/mol; traces of T3, 10 mmol T4/mol), previously characterized in binding studies (22.Mezghrani H.

Mallet (Faculty of Medicine, Marseille, France). The following antibodies were used: anti-PDI (polyclonal SPA-890 (StressGen) and monoclonals clone 1D3 (StressGen) or clone RL90 (ABR, Inc.)), anti-KDEL (monoclonal clone 10C3, SPA-827 (StressGen)), anti-BiP (polyclonal SPA-826, and monoclonal SPP-765 (StressGen)), anti-calnexin (polyclonal SPA-865 and monoclonal SPA-866 (StressGen)), anti-grp94 (monoclonal SPA-850 (StressGen)), and anti-β-galactosidase (monoclonal clone GAL-13 (Sigma)). FRTL5 cells (ATCC RL8305) were cultured in Coon's modified Ham's F-12 medium, pH 7.5, containing bicarbonate (2.67 g/liter) and 5% decomplemented calf serum. A mixture of nonessential amino acids (1 mm) was added, along with six hormones: TSH (10 milliunits/ml), transferrin (5 μg/ml), insulin (10 μg/ml), somatostatin (10 ng/ml), glycyl-1-histidyl-1-lysine (10 ng/ml), and hydrocortisone (3.7 ng/ml). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane using a semidry blotter and 180 mA applied for 30 min. The blot was incubated for 1 h with Tris-buffered saline, 10 mm Tris, 0. 15 m NaCl, pH 7.5, containing 5% milk powder, and 0. 5% Tween 20 and was then washed twice with Tris-buffered saline containing 0. 5% Tween 20 (TBST). The blot was incubated with TBST containing 2% skim milk powder and primary antibodies (1/1000 dilution). The blot was washed four times with TBST, then incubated in 5 ml of TBST containing 2% skim milk powder and the secondary antibody (1/20,000 dilution). The blot was washed five times with TBST and incubated with a chemiluminescence substrate, according to the manufacturer's instructions. It was then placed against x-ray film for detection of the bound primary antibody. The blot was stripped by incubation with Immunopure elution buffer (Pierce) for 2 h at room temperature. The blot was washed, incubated with SuperSignal working solution (Pierce), and placed against x-ray film, to check that the probes had been adequately removed. The stripped blot was then washed four times and incubated with blocking reagent before reprobing. Cells were washed with 20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.15m NaCl, pH 7.4 (PBS), and incubated in cysteine- and methionine-free labeling mixture containing 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum, in the presence of [35S]methionine/cysteine (200 μCi/ml, Expre35S35S labeling mix; NEN Life Science Products). The labeling medium was removed and replaced with Coon's modified Ham's F-12 medium, and the cells were incubated for various lengths of time (the chase period). The media were removed after the chase period, and, protease inhibitors were added (1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each leupeptin and pepstatin) and the mixture centrifuged (1 h at 100,000 × g). For treatment of the cells with colchicine or brefeldin A, cells were incubated in Coon's medium containing either 40 μm colchicine or 20 μm brefeldin A for 30 min before labeling and the chase period in medium containing the same concentrations of these drugs. The cells were washed four times with ice-cold PBS and harvested by scraping. They were then centrifuged at 1,500 revolutions/min for 10 min, suspended in 10 ml of ice-cold PBS and recentrifuged. The resulting cell pellets were suspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40). The cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × gfor 10 min to remove cell debris. The resulting supernatants were cleared by incubation with 20 μl of non-immune serum and 20 μl of a 50% suspension of Protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. The suspension was centrifuged to remove the Protein A-Sepharose, and the cleared cell lysates and media were incubated with 5 μl of anti-PDI monoclonal antibody (RL90) and 12 μl of anti-BiP polyclonal antibody or 12 μl of anti-TG antiserum. Immune complexes were recovered by addition of 30 μl of a 50% suspension of Protein A-Sepharose and incubation for 1 h at 4 °C. The suspension was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 3 min, the supernatant discarded, and the pellet washed four times with lysis buffer and once with PBS. The immunoprecipitate was suspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 2% SDS with or without 1% β-mercaptoethanol and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried by conventional methods, and radiolabeled bands were detected by phosphoimaging (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). The leakage of proteins from injured cells was assayed by determining lactate dehydrogenase activity. FRTL5 cells were grown in Lab Tek I chambers, washed briefly in PBS, and fixed in 2% formaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min. The cells were then washed twice in PBS and incubated with blocking buffer (PBS containing 10% BSA) for 10 min at room temperature in a humidified chamber. The cells were mixed directly, without washing, with the primary antibody in 0.1% BSA in PBS, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h. The cells were then washed five times with 0.1% BSA in PBS, and were incubated for 1 h with the fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibody in 0.1% BSA in PBS. The cells were thoroughly washed in PBS, mounted on slides in Mowiol, and viewed with a confocal microscope (Leitz DMIR BE, Leica TSC 4D, Heidelberg, Germany). We determined the level of PDI secretion, by subjecting serially diluted (standardized based on protein content) samples of culture medium to slot blot analysis on nitrocellulose membranes. The signal obtained was compared with that given by known amounts of purified PDI. Blots were probed with anti-PDI antibody, treated for chemiluminescence, scanned, and analyzed with a PhosphorImager and the ImageQuant software package (Molecular Dynamics). Sulfo-SHPP was iodinated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1 mCi of 125I-Na was added to 10 μl of a freshly prepared solution of sulfo-SHPP in dimethyl sulfoxide (0.1 mg/ml). The following were then added sequentially: 10 μl of chloramine T (5 mg/ml), 100 μl of hydoxyphenyl acetic acid (1 mg/ml), and 10 μl of sodium metabisulfite (12 mg/ml).125I-Labeled sulfo-SHPP (200 μCi) was incubated in 25-cm2 flasks with confluent FRTL5 cells, previously washed three times with ice-cold PBS, for 1 h each at 2–4 °C. The labeling medium was removed, and the cells were washed with PBS at 4 °C and recovered by scraping into ice-cold PBS. The cells were washed, and cell lysates were obtained for immunoprecipitation of PDI as described above. PDI (10 μg) was iodinated by incubation with IODOGEN and125I-Na in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, for 15 min at 4 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml of 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm KI. Iodinated molecules were isolated by gel filtration through PD10 columns and extensive dialysis. The same protocol was used for TG iodination, except that gel filtration was performed through Sephadex-200 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total RNA was extracted from the thyroid tissues of patients with Graves' disease, as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (43.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Briefly, tissue (10 mg) was crushed in 3 ml of RNABlue solution (Eurobio). Chloroform (300 μl) was added, and the mixture was vigorously vortexed and centrifuged at 15,000 × gfor 30 min. The aqueous phase was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube containing an equal volume of isopropanol. RNA was recovered by precipitation overnight at −20 °C and centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min. The pellet was washed with 75% ethanol and suspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. The first strand cDNA was synthesized by incubation of 1–3 μg of total RNA with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (5 units, Life Technologies, Inc.) for 1 h at 42 °C, in a volume of 30 μl. The resulting first strand cDNA was then used for PCR amplification. The membrane receptor binding domain of TG (Ser789-Met1178) was amplified using the following primers: the forward primer was 5′-GGGATCCGCTGAGCAGGTCTTCGAGTTG-3′ (2374–2394) and the reverse primer, 5′-CTCTAGAGAGCACATTTCAGAGGCTTGG-3′ (3494–3474). The cysteine-rich repeat unit 9 (RU9, according to Ref. 44.Malthiéry Y. Lissitzsky S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 165: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) that forms part of the binding domain, was amplified using the primers 5′-GGGATCCCTGCAGATTCCACAGGGCCCG-3′ (3241–3261; forward) and 5′-CTCTAGAGAGCACATTTCAGAGGCTTGG-3′ (3494–3474; reverse). Each of these primers contained a unique restriction site, BamHI for the forward primers and XbaI for the reverse primers. The expected protein sequences of the TG-derived fusion proteins included Pro759–Leu1163 for the membrane-binding domain of TG and Leu1080–Leu1163 for the RU9 cysteine-rich motif. The reaction mixture for PCR (50 μl) contained 10 mmamounts of each dNTP, 100 ng of each primer, the buffer supplied by the manufacturer, and 1 unit of Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs). PCR amplification involved denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, primer annealing at 55.5 °C (PCR 2) for 90 s, and extension for 90 s, with optimum results obtained using 34 cycles. PCR fragments were purified from agarose gel and cut with BamHI andXbaI endonucleases. They were then ligated into theBamHI/XbaI-cleaved PMal-CR1 expression vector (Biolabs) and used to transform Escherichia coli TB1. The TG fragment inserts of the plasmids of positive clones were checked by sequencing. The DNA was sequenced using M13 (−47) and reverse M13 (−48) primers (New England Biolabs). We used the cycle sequencing method and the dRhodamine Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems/Perkin-Elmer). Sequences were determined with an ABI Prism 310 and were aligned with the Tg cDNA sequence using AutoAssembler software (Applied Biosystems/Perkin-Elmer). RT-PCR generated two cDNA fragments, one with the expected sequence, based on the wild-type mRNA (43.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar, 44.Malthiéry Y. Lissitzsky S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 165: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), and the other with exons 13, 14 and 15 deleted. Exons 14 and 15 encode the cysteine-rich RU9 motif (His1025–Cys1160, Ref. 45.Parma J. Christophe D. Pohl V. Vassart G. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This finding is novel, and we therefore tried to determine the incidence of this deletion in various physiopathological conditions. The results of this investigation will be published elsewhere. 2A. Mezghrani, J. Courageot, J. C. Mani, M. Pugniere, P. Bastiani, and R. Miquelis, manuscript in preparation. Three clones derived from the TG cDNAs were selected and prepared. One encoded the full-length binding domain (BD), the second, the alternatively spliced binding site (BDΔRU9), and the third, RU9 (RU9). Bacterial clones containing the various constructs were cultured overnight in 50 ml of LB medium at 37 °C with shaking. An aliquot (50 ml) of the overnight culture was used to inoculate 1 liter of LB, which was then incubated at 37 °C until the optical density at 600 nm of the culture reached 0.4 (i.e. 2 × 108 cells/ml). Synthesis of the fusion proteins was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.1 mm and incubating at 32 °C for 90–120 min. The culture was then centrifuged at 1500 ×g for 10 min. The bacterial pellet was suspended in 50 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 30 mm NaCl, 0.25% Tween 20, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA) and placed in a freezer at −20 °C overnight. The lysate was thawed at 4 °C, in the presence of 1 mmPMSF and subjected to sonication with 1-min pulses for 20 min. NaCl (final concentration 0.5 m) was added and the mixture centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The fusion proteins were purified on amylose resin, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The protein-containing fractions were dialyzed and concentrated (1 mg/ml final concentration) against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in a MicroProdicon apparatus (BioMolecular Dynamics). The level of purification of these fusion proteins was checked by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-maltose-binding protein (MBP) and anti-TG antibodies. FRTL5 plasma membranes were prepared as described previously (5.Kim P. Bole D. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 6.Kuznetsov G. Chen L.B.

Solid-phase assays of TG and fusion peptide binding to FRTL5 membranes were performed according to established methods (21.Mziaut H. Bastiani P. Balivet T. Papandreou M.J. Fert V. Errgragui K.

Membranes were added (20 μg of total protein in 40 μl of PBS buffer) to the flat-bottomed wells of a microtiter plate (Falcon 3911, Becton Dickinson, Oxnard, CA) and were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and then overnight at 4 °C. The wells were washed three times with 150 μl of PBS and once with 200 μl of PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin. Thyroglobulin (5 × 105 to 106cpm in a binding buffer consisting of 25 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% BSA) was added and incubated alone or in the presence of competitors at 4 °C for 90 min. The wells were washed four times with the binding buffer, and radioactivity was counted. The results are means of at least three separate experiments performed in duplicate or triplicate.

In addition, the structural changes related to heterotrimeric complex formation or FAD binding were transmitted to the iron-sulfur protein and could be monitored by EPR.

Frunzke K. Mörsdorf G. Murrell J.C. Kelly D.P. Microbial Growth on C1 Compounds. Intercept Scientific Publication, Andover, United Kingdom1993: 433-459Google Scholar, 2.Meyer O. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1333-1341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In its membrane-associated state, CO dehydrogenase is involved in energy transduction. The electrons formed through CO oxidation are channeled via cytochromeb 561 into a CO-insensitive respiratory chain that generates a proton motive force (1.Meyer O. Frunzke K. Mörsdorf G. Murrell J.C. Kelly D.P. Microbial Growth on C1 Compounds. Intercept Scientific Publication, Andover, United Kingdom1993: 433-459Google Scholar, 3.Cypionka H. Meyer O. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 156: 1178-1187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In its soluble state, CO dehydrogenase transfers the electrons to O2, thereby producing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide (O⨪2). With Streptomyces thermoautotrophicus, the O⨪2 produced by CO dehydrogenase serves as the electron donor in a superoxide-dependent nitrogenase reaction (4.Ribbe M. Gadkari D. Meyer O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26627-26633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). CO dehydrogenase is a prototype of the molybdenum hydroxylase sequence family, which includes the aldehyde oxidoreductase (Mop) fromDesulfovibrio gigas as well as enzymes, oxidizing aromaticN-heterocyclic compounds such as xanthine dehydrogenases/oxidases from different procaryotic and eucaryotic sources, quinoline 2-oxidoreductase from Pseudomonas putida, and nicotine dehydrogenase from Arthrobacter nicotinovorans(5.Schübel U. Kraut M. Mörsdorf G. Meyer O. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2197-2203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Hille R. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2757-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of CO dehydrogenase from O. carboxidovorans has been solved at a 2.2-Å resolution (7.Dobbek H. Gremer L. Meyer O. Huber R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8884-8889Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and shows a dimer of heterotrimers (see Fig. 1). Each heterotrimer is composed of a 88.7-kDa molybdoprotein (L), a 30.2-kDa flavoprotein (M), and a 17.8-kDa iron-sulfur protein (S). The molybdoprotein of CO dehydrogenase carries the molybdopterin cytosine dinucleotide (MCD)1-type of molybdenum cofactor and the unique active-site loop Gly383-Val-Ala-Tyr-Arg-Cys-Ser-Phe-Arg391, which positions the catalytically essentialS-selanylcysteine 388 in a distance of 3.7 Å to the molybdenum ion. The iron-sulfur protein carries the two 2Fe:2S centers of CO dehydrogenase. One center is located in the N-terminal domain, and the other is located in the C-terminal domain of the iron-sulfur protein (see Fig. 1). The N-terminal 2Fe:2S center is positioned at the interface between the iron-sulfur protein, and the flavoprotein and is exposed to the solvent. It lies 8.7 Å apart from the FAD in the flavoprotein (Fig. 1). The flavoprotein binds the FAD as a prosthetic group in a fold formed by its N-terminal and middle domains. Binding of FAD involves strong interactions of two vanillyl alcohol oxidase-like double glycine motifs on each of the two domains, mainly with the pyrophosphate moiety of the FAD. On the N-terminal domain a loop between the sheet β2 and the helix α2 of a βαβ unit (P-loop) containing the motif Ala32-Gly33-Gly34-His35-Ser36is involved, and on the middle domain a small α-helix (α7) containing the major part of the motif Thr111-Ile112-Gly113-Gly114-Asn115is involved. The C-terminal domain of the flavoprotein carries a Tyr193 residue, which shields the central part of the isoalloxazine ring from the solvent (7.Dobbek H. Gremer L. Meyer O. Huber R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8884-8889Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). This paper presents a structural and functional analysis of FAD binding in CO dehydrogenase employing a CO dehydrogenase species in which the native flavoprotein has been replaced by a recombinant one. The FAD binding site on the free flavoprotein is not able to bind FAD. However, in the heterotrimeric complex of the flavoprotein with the iron-sulfur protein and the molybdoprotein, the flavin binding site is capable to integrate FAD. O. carboxidovorans (DSM 1227) (formerlyPseudomonas carboxydovorans OM5 (8.Meyer O. Stackebrandt E. Auling G. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1993; 16: 390-395Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar)) was mass-cultivated in 50-liter fermentors under chemolithoautotrophic conditions with CO as a sole source of carbon and energy (9.Kiessling M. Meyer O. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1982; 13: 333-338Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Escherichia coliDH5α (10.Jessee J. Focus 8/4. Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD1986: 9-10Google Scholar) and E. coli BL21(DE3) (11.Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4834) Google Scholar) were grown in LB medium (12.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) supplemented with ampicillin (200 μg ml−1) and kanamycin (100 μg ml−1). The plasmids pREP4 (Qiagen), pBluescript I KS+ (13.Short J.M. Fernandez J.M. Sorge J.A. Huse W.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7583-7600Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar), and pET11a (Novagen) were used for heterologous expression, and pBluescript I KS+ and pET16b (Novagen) were used for sequence analysis. A 0.95-kilobase BamHI-HincII fragment of pCDH1 containing the CO dehydrogenase structural gene coxM (5.Schübel U. Kraut M. Mörsdorf G. Meyer O. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2197-2203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was cloned into the vector pBluescript I KS+, yielding the plasmid pSK7. This plasmid was used as a template for polymerase chain reaction to amplify the first 244 nucleotides of coxM, using the following primers. The 34-mer 5′-TGTAGAGCTCCATATGATCCCTGGTTCATTTGAT-3′ was used to generate a NdeI site by replacing the start codon GTG by ATG and to alter the second codon for isoleucin from ATA to ATC, resulting in a suitable codon usage for expression in E. coli (14.Grosjean H. Fiers W. Gene. 1982; 18: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). The 25-mer 5′-ATTATCGCATGCTGAGTGGTCATCG-3′ contained aSphI site to cleave the amplified polymerase chain reaction product for cloning. The fragment amplified by polymerase chain reaction was cloned into the vector pET16b together with theSphI-XhoI fragment from pSK7, which contained the remaining part of coxM, yielding pETSK1. TheNdeI-BamHI fragment from pETSK1 was cloned into pET11a, yielding pETSK2, which was then transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)/pREP4 (11.Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4834) Google Scholar) yielding E. coliBL21(DE3)/pREP4/pETSK2. Overexpression of CoxM was induced with 2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside in LB medium at 20 °C and at an A 600 of 0.7. The oxidation of CO or H2 by CO dehydrogenase was coupled to the reduction of 50 μm methylene blue (2.Meyer O. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1333-1341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 100 μm1-phenyl-2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium chloride (INT), 20 μm 1-methoxyphenazine methosulfate (MPMS) (15.Kraut M. Hugendieck I. Herwig S. Meyer O. Arch. Microbiol. 1989; 152: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), or 100 μm 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol in 50 mm NaH2PO4-NaOH (pH 7.2) and followed spectrophotometrically at 30 °C employing ε615 of 37.11 mm−1cm−1 (methylene blue), ε496 of 17.98 mm−1 cm−1 (INT/MPMS), and ε600 of 16.10 mm−1cm−1 (2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol). Assays of 1-ml total volume were flushed with pure CO or H2 in screw-capped cuvettes provided with a rubber septum. Reactions were initiated by injection of 20 μl of enzyme. All purification steps were carried out below 4 °C. For purification of CO dehydrogenase cell paste of CO-grown O. carboxidovorans(about 100 g wet mass) was suspended in 200 ml of 50 mm Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.2) (buffer A) containing 1 mm Na2EDTA, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, and 5 mg of DNase I, disrupted in a high pressure homogenizer (Rannie AS), and subjected to low spin centrifugation, yielding crude extracts. Cytoplasmic fractions were prepared from crude extracts by ultracentrifugation for 2 h at 100,000 × g. Anion exchange chromatography was on Source 30 Q (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer A. Cytoplasmic fractions (210 ml) were applied to the column (dimensions 15 cm by 5 cm) and eluted with 640 ml of buffer A followed by 1440 ml of a linear gradient of 0 to 1 m NaCl in buffer A. Fractions with CO dehydrogenase activity were pooled, supplemented with 1.3 m ammonium sulfate and 1 mmNa2EDTA, and gently stirred for 60 min. Precipitated protein was removed by low spin centrifugation, and the supernatant (220 ml) was loaded onto a hydrophobic interaction chromatography column (butyl-Sepharose 4 fast flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (dimensions 6.5 cm by 5 cm) that has been equilibrated with 0.85m ammonium sulfate in buffer A containing 1 mmNa2EDTA. Proteins were desorbed with 360 ml of equilibration buffer followed by 840 ml of a linear gradient combining decreasing ammonium sulfate concentrations (0.85 to 0 m) with increasing 2-propanol concentrations (0 to 20%, vol/vol) in buffer A. Fractions with CO dehydrogenase activity were pooled, desalted by gel filtration in buffer A, and concentrated by ultrafiltration. The purified enzyme was frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at −80 °C until use. For the preparation of enzyme species devoid of the flavoprotein, typically 200 mg of CO dehydrogenase in 75 ml of buffer A containing 1% (mass/vol) SDS were incubated for 45 min at 30 °C followed by gel filtration on Sephadex G-75 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, column dimensions 35 cm by 5 cm). Excluded CO dehydrogenase species were pooled, loaded onto Source 30 Q (column dimensions 12.5 cm by 2.6 cm), and eluted with 540 ml of a linear gradient of 0 to 1 mNaCl in buffer A. Purified CO dehydrogenase species with the subunit compositions (LMS)2, M(LS)2, and (LS)2 proteins were pooled separately, concentrated, desalted, and stored as described above. Recombinant apoflavoprotein was purified from E. coliBL21(DE3)/pREP4/pETSK2 as follows. 12 g of cell paste suspended in 40 ml of buffer B (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.7) containing 2 mg of DNase I were ultrasonicated (model Labsonic U, probe tip 40 T, Braun Biotech), subjected to ultracentrifugation (2 h at 100,000 ×g), loaded onto a Source 30 Q column (dimensions 12.5 cm by 2.6 cm), eluted with 180 ml of buffer B followed by 750 ml of a linear gradient of 0 to 0.5 m NaCl in buffer B, and gel filtered on Sephadex G-75 in buffer B containing 150 mm NaCl. Fractions were analyzed for the recombinant apoflavoprotein by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, pooled, and stored on ice for less than 2 days until use. For a typical reconstitution, 4 ml of the CO dehydrogenase species (LS)2(10 mg ml−1) or 6.8 ml of M(LS)2 (10 mg ml−1) were mixed with 42 ml of the recombinant apoflavoprotein (0.4 mg ml−1) in buffer B supplemented with 150 mm NaCl and kept on ice for 60 min. Excess apoflavoprotein was removed by chromatography on Source 30 Q (for conditions, refer to purification of recombinant apoflavoprotein). Reconstituted CO dehydrogenase species were pooled, concentrated, desalted in buffer A and stored at −80 °C. For reconstitution with FAD, typically 2 ml of reconstituted deflavo (LMS)2 (3 mg ml−1) in buffer A were mixed with 0.22 ml of 5 mm FAD in the same buffer and kept on ice for 60 min. Excess FAD was removed by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25. Association constants for FAD with deflavo (LMS)2 were determined from fluorescence quenching data at equilibrium binding (16.Nishikimi M. Kyogoku Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1973; 73: 1233-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 17.Zanetti G. Cidaria D. Curti B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 126: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Association rate constants were determined assuming the simple model, A+F ⇌k−1k+1 HEquation 1 where A is a deflavo LMS monomer (apoenzyme), F the FAD, and H is the flavo LMS monomer (holoenzyme). The equation −d(Fl)/dt =k +1[A][F] −k −1[H] describes the decrease of fluorescence (Fl). Since the concentrations of F and A exceeded the assumed K d by 3 orders of magnitude, the term of complex dissociation is negligible. For a reaction with second-order kinetics and initial concentrations of c o = [F] = [A], the rate constant k +1 is determined by the equation [H]/(c o(c o − [H])) =k +1 t. Association experiments were carried out at concentrations of 6.47, 3.24, and 1.61 μmof F and A in buffer B containing 150 mm NaCl at 8 °C, respectively. Oxidation of MCD to form A with I2/KI followed published procedures (18.Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6856-6860Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Mononucleotides were released from MCD or FAD by treatment of CO dehydrogenase species with sulfuric acid followed by HPLC analysis (19.Gremer L. Meyer O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 862-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Flavins were analyzed spectrophotometrically in supernatants of trichloroacetic acid precipitates (2.Meyer O. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1333-1341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For estimation of flavin or nucleotide binding to reconstituted deflavo (LMS)2, CO dehydrogenase was incubated for 300 min in buffer A containing a 50-fold molar excess of the indicated compounds, followed by gel filtration. Bound nucleotides were released by boiling the proteins for 90 s with SDS (2%, mass/vol) in buffer A, followed by ultrafiltration (Microcon-3, Millipore) and analysis by isocratic anion exchange HPLC (ET 250/8/4 Nucleosil 100–10 SB, Macherey and Nagel) employing 0.5 mNaH2PO4 (pH 4.2) as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 ml min−1. Protein estimation employed conventional methods (20.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar, 21.Beisenherz G. Bolze H.G. Bücher T. Czok R. Garbade K.H. Meyer-Arendt E. Pfleiderer G. Z. Naturforsch. 1953; 8B: 555-557Crossref Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Homogeneous CO dehydrogenase species were also quantitated from their absorbance at 550 nm (ε550 = 23.5 mm−1cm−1). Analytical PAGE was carried out according to Laemmli (22.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). For SDS-PAGE, 7.5% (mass/vol) acrylamide-stacking gels and 12% (mass/vol) acrylamide-running gels were used. For nondenaturing PAGE, 7.5% (mass/vol) acrylamide-running gels were used. Protein staining was performed with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250. Protein transfer from acrylamide gels to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and N-terminal amino acid sequencing were carried out as described (19.Gremer L. Meyer O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 862-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis was done with rabbit polyclonal IgG antibodies directed against the M subunit of O. carboxidovorans CO dehydrogenase. Primary IgG antibody binding was detected using goat anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma). Isoelectric focussing was performed on IsoGel agarose plates (FMC, Bio-products) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Selenium contents were estimated by neutron activation analysis (native CO dehydrogenase) or by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (CO dehydrogenase species M(LS)2 and (LS)2). Iron, molybdenum, and acid-labile sulfur were estimated spectrophotometrically as described (23.Fish W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 158: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 24.Cardenas J. Mortenson L.E. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 60: 372-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 25.Fogo J.K. Popowsky M. Anal. Chem. 1949; 21: 732-734Crossref Scopus (364) Google Scholar). CD spectra were recorded on a spectropolarimeter (J-600, Jasco). Contents of secondary structural elements were calculated as described (26.Manavalan P. Johnson Jr., W.C. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 167: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). X-band EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker EMX spectrometer operated with a helium cryostat. The experimental conditions and determinations of g values were essentially as described before (27.Bray R.C. George G.N. Lange R. Meyer O. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 687-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 28.Hänzelmann P. Meyer O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 755-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 29.Hänzelmann P. Hofmann B. Meisen S. Meyer O. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 176: 139-145Crossref Google Scholar). Reconstituted flavo (LMS)2 species were crystallized under the same conditions effective for native CO dehydrogenase (7.Dobbek H. Gremer L. Meyer O. Huber R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8884-8889Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Molecular replacement methods with data sets obtained from native CO dehydrogenase were used for structure determination. Gases were purchased from Linde. All other chemicals employed were obtained from the usual commercial sources. The medium (M) subunit of CO dehydrogenase was heterologously overexpressed. After induction ofE. coli BL21(DE3)/pREP4/pETSK2 with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for at least 6 h, the recombinant protein comprised 30 to 40% of the total cell protein and comigrated with the authentic M subunit (Fig.2). Induction at 20 °C and a pH of 8.7 of the sonication buffer were essential to obtain maximum yields of the soluble recombinant M subunit (25% soluble and 75% aggregated). The recombinant M subunit was purified 8-fold by ultracentrifugation, anion exchange chromatography, and gel filtration with an electrophoretic purity of 86% and a yield of 25% (Fig. 2 B,lane 4). The protein turned out to be fragile and remained soluble only at concentrations below 1 mg ml−1 and temperatures below 8 °C. The identity of the recombinant M subunit is apparent from comigration with the authentic M subunit upon SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 B, lanes 4 and 7) and an N terminus of MIPGSFDYHRPKSIADAVALLTKL, which is identical to that of the wild-type flavoprotein (5.Schübel U. Kraut M. Mörsdorf G. Meyer O. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2197-2203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The apparent molecular masses of the recombinant M subunit determined from SDS-PAGE (30 kDa, Fig.2 B, lane 4) or by gel filtration (41 kDa) indicate a monomeric subunit structure. The recombinant M subunit revealed a far-UV CD spectrum with a maximum at 190 nm and a trough extending from 210 to 225 nm, which is typical of α-helix/β-sheet proteins and indicates that it was folded. The recombinant M subunit revealed the following percentages of secondary structural elements: α-helices (24 ± 1), antiparallel β-sheets (20 ± 1), parallel β-sheets (4 ± 1), β-turns (22 ± 1), and other elements (30 ± 1). Its isoelectric point was 7.4. The recombinant M subunit was deflavo on the basis of its UV-visible absorption spectrum (protein concentration of 0.8 mg/ml, ε277 = 19.6 mm−1 cm−1) or the spectrum of trichloroacetic acid supernatants. When recombinant M protein was incubated for 18 h at 4 °C with a 50-fold molar excess of FAD or FMN and subjected to gel filtration, and the protein fraction was analyzed spectrophotometrically, no flavins were identified. These data indicate that the recombinant M subunit is devoid of flavins and has no affinity for FAD or FMN. The anionic detergent SDS was found to remove specifically one or both M subunits from CO dehydrogenase, resulting in the formation of proteins of different mobility, designated band I to IV (Fig.3 A). The formation of the band I to IV proteins was paralleled by a time-dependent, gradual loss of CO dehydrogenase activity (Fig. 3 B). The 277-kDa band (Fig. 3, band I) represented catalytically competent CO dehydrogenase. It was converted into an inactive 217-kDa protein (Fig. 3, band III) with the intermediate formation of a partially active 247-kDa protein (band II). The data indicate a sequential release of the two 30-kDa M subunits (Fig. 3,band IV) from native (LMS)2-structured CO dehydrogenase, resulting in the formation of an intermediate M(LS)2 species (band II) and a final (LS)2 species (band III). Band IV(Fig. 3) was identified as the M subunit on the basis of its correct N terminus of MIPGSFDY (5.Schübel U. Kraut M. Mörsdorf G. Meyer O. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2197-2203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and migration as a 30-kDa polypeptide upon SDS-PAGE (data not shown). The low mobility of the M subunit (Fig. 3,band IV) indicates that it became partially or fully unfolded under the experimental conditions applied. The purified band I protein (Fig. 2 C, lane 1) had a (LMS)2 subunit structure on the basis of 89-, 30-, and 18-kDa polypeptides appearing at a 1:0.8:0.8 molar ratio upon SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 B, lane 1) and represents native CO dehydrogenase. The purified band II protein (Fig. 2 C,lane 2) had an M(LS)2 subunit structure on the basis of 89-, 30-, and 18-kDa polypeptides appearing at a 1:0.5:0.9 molar ratio (Fig. 2 B, lane 2). The purified band III protein (Fig. 2 C, lane 3) had a (LS)2 subunit structure on the basis of 89- and 18-kDa polypeptides appearing at a 1:0.9 molar ratio (Fig. 2 B,lane 3). From now on we are referring to the homogeneous proteins of band II and III as M(LS)2 and (LS)2, respectively. Native CO dehydrogenase and the M(LS)2 and (LS)2 species eluted from the anion exchanger (Source 30 Q) at 0.29, 0.33, or 0.35 m NaCl, respectively, referring to an increase in the net overall negative charges. Analyses of native CO dehydrogenase, M(LS)2, and (LS)2 by the trichloroacetic acid precipitation revealed a 1:1 molar correlation between the M subunits and FAD (TableI). The contents of molybdenum, 5′-CMP, and form A indicate a 1:1 mononuclear complex of molybdenum and MCD in each of the three proteins (Table I). The contents of iron and acid-labile sulfur agree with the presence of both 2Fe:2S centers in each of the three proteins (Table I).Table IActivities and cofactor contents of different CO dehydrogenase speciesSpecies of CO dehydrogenaseNativeM(LS)2(LS)2Flavo (LMS)2Specific activities CO → INT/MPMS4026 ± 1151464 ± 73<1<1 CO → DCPIP528 ± 18204 ± 11<1<1 H2 → methylene blue197 ± 1277 ± 8<1<1Contents FAD1.97 ± 0.090.84 ± 0.07<0.022.10 ± 0.06 Iron7.71 ± 0.377.70 ± 0.278.34 ± 0.517.91 ± 0.34 Acid-labile sulfur7.79 ± 0.278.10 ± 0.148.07 ± 0.477.96 ± 0.22 Molybdenum1.74 ± 0.111.38 ± 0.091.23 ± 0.051.21 ± 0.08 Selenium0.43 ± 0.010.290.270.26 5′-CMP1.65 ± 0.061.46 ± 0.041.22 ± 0.101.24 ± 0.12 Form A100 ± 1892 ± 1179 ± 974 ± 7Specific activities are given in milliunits mg−1, corresponding to 1 nmol of CO or H2 reduced min−1mg−1 of protein.

DCPIP, 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol. The spectrum of the (LS)2 species is characterized by a complete loss of the FAD absorption maxima at 387 and 449 nm (Fig.4 A, spectrum c) and is very similar to that of the Mop protein from D. gigas(30.Moura J.J.G. Barata B.A.S Methods Enzymol. 1993; 243: 24-42Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar), which resembles (LS)2 in containing a 1:1 mononuclear complex of molybdenum and MCD, the 2Fe:2S centers, and no FAD (31.Romão M.J.

The shoulder at 387 nm in the spectrum of native CO dehydrogenase originates from the short wavelength absorption maximum of FAD (Fig.4 A, spectrum a). The extended iron-sulfur absorption that centers around 550 nm was the same in the spectra of native CO dehydrogenase, M(LS)2, and (LS)2(Fig. 4 A, spectra a to c). The spectrum of the flavoprotein of CO dehydrogenase, i.e. the M subunit with the bound FAD, can be obtained from the difference spectra of native CO dehydrogenase minus (LS)2 (Fig. 4 A, spectrum d) or native CO dehydrogenase minus M(LS)2 (Fig. 4 A, spectrum e). The shoulder at 478 nm in the flavoprotein spectrum (Fig. 4 A, spectra d and e) is not apparent with free FAD in solution and, thus, originates from cofactor-protein interactions. We have shown that controlled dissociation of CO dehydrogenase with SDS produces a rather rigid deflavo (LS)2 substructure from which both M subunits have been removed (Figs. 2 and 4). The noncovalent interactions of the individual L and S subunits and of two LS monomers are apparently rather tight and are contrasted by only weak binding of the M subunits to (LS)2. The existence of a discrete M(LS)2 species containing FAD at a 1:1 molar ratio (Figs. 2 and 4) and exhibiting about 50% full enzymic activity (TableI) indicates that each LMS heterotrimer in CO dehydrogenase represents an independent catalytic unit as concluded before from a molybdenum to molybdenum distance of 53 Å (7.Dobbek H. Gremer L. Meyer O. Huber R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8884-8889Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar).

Cytol. 1991; 124: 103-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It was shown to be involved in the activity of the elongation factors in bacteria (3.Kisha K. Möller W. Stöffler G. Nature. 1971; 233: 62-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) as well as in eukaryotes (4.Sanchez-Madrid F. Reyes R. Conde P. Ballesta J.P.G. Eur. J.

Commun. 1980; 92: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and a direct interaction with EF-Tu and EF-G has recently been confirmed by electron microscopy (6.Stark H. Rodnina M.V. Rinke A.J. Brimacombe R. Wintermeyer W. van Heel M. Nature. 1997; 389: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 7.Agrawal R.K. Penzek P. Grassucci R.A. Frank J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6134-6138Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Moreover, the stalk may also have a regulatory role for the activity of the eukaryotic ribosome (8.Ballesta J.P.G. Remacha M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 55: 157-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The bacterial stalk is formed by a pentamer made of two dimers of protein L7/L12 and protein L10, that interacts with one of the most highly conserved regions of the large rRNA, the so-called GTPase center (9.Beauclerk A.A. Cundliffe E. Dijk J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6559-6563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Egebjerg J. Douthwaite S.D. Liljas A. Garrett R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 275-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The similar eukaryotic pentameric complex is made of four 12-kDa acidic proteins and the 34-kDa protein P0, which are equivalents to L7/L12 and L10, respectively. In eukaryotes having two types of acidic proteins, called P1 and P2, they seem to be present as dimers in the stalk (11.Uchiumi T. Wahba A.J. Traut R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5580-5584Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The acidic proteins interact through their NH2-terminal domain (12.Payo J.M. Santana-Roman H. Remacha M. Ballesta J.P.G. Zinker S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7941-7948Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) with P0 in a region close to the carboxyl end (13.Santos C. Ballesta J.P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20608-20614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The whole protein complex binds to the rRNA GTPase center through the NH2-terminal domain of protein P0 (13.Santos C. Ballesta J.P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20608-20614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar,14.Uchiumi T. Kominami R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3302-3308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal end of the proteins is exposed to the medium and interacts with the elongation factors (6.Stark H. Rodnina M.V. Rinke A.J. Brimacombe R. Wintermeyer W. van Heel M. Nature. 1997; 389: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 7.Agrawal R.K. Penzek P. Grassucci R.A. Frank J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6134-6138Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). In quite a few eukaryotic species there are more than one protein of the P1 and P2 types. A third protein type, P3, has even been reported in plants (15.Szick K. Springer M. Bailey-Serres J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2378-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae there are two P1 proteins, P1α and P1β, and two P2 proteins, P2α and P2β. The four yeast stalk proteins share the same COOH-terminal peptide, EESDDDMGFGLFD, which is also present in protein P0, but show substantial differences in the rest of the amino acid sequence. Thus, the overall sequence similarity in the two proteins of the same type is only close to 80% and their function is not totally equivalent (8.Ballesta J.P.G. Remacha M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 55: 157-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As an average, there are about four 12-kDa acidic proteins per yeast ribosome (16.Saenz-Robles M.T. Remacha M. Vilella M.D. Zinker S. Ballesta J.P.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1050: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Therefore, if the yeast acidic proteins are present as dimers there cannot be two copies of each protein per particle, and, consequently, the ribosome population should be heterogeneous regarding the stalk composition. There is, nevertheless, evidence suggesting that, contrary to mammals, the acidic proteins can be as monomers in the yeast ribosome (17.Ballesta J.P.G. Guarinos E. Zurdo J. Parada P. Nusspaumer G. Lalioti V.S. Perez-Fernandez J. Remacha M. Garrett R. Douthwaite S. Matheson A. Liljas A. Moore P.B. Noller H.F. The Ribosome: Structure, Function, Antibiotics and Cellular Interactions. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2000Google Scholar). However, further experimental data are required to totally resolve this question. In any case, independently of the copy number, the presence of at least one protein of the P1 type and one of the P2 type is required to form a complex with protein P0. Thus, in S. cerevisiae D67, a mutant in which the two genes encoding the P1α/P1β proteins have been disrupted, the P2α/P2β proteins accumulate in the cytoplasm but are not found bound to the ribosome (18.Remacha M. Santos C. Bermejo B. Naranda T. Ballesta J.P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12061-12067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the bacterial and eukaryotic stalk proteins seem to play a similar role with respect to their basic function in the ribosome, they have substantial structural differences (19.Shimmin L.C. Ramirez G. Matheson A.T. Dennis P.P. J. Mol. Evol. 1989; 29: 448-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 20.Santos C. Ballesta J.P.G. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9625-9635Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Protein P0 shows a higher degree of structural and functional complexity than the bacterial protein L10 (20.Santos C. Ballesta J.P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15689-15696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Santos C. Ballesta J.P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20608-20614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The eukaryotic protein has a carboxyl end extension of around 100 amino acids that resembles the amino acid sequence of proteins P1 and P2 (19.Shimmin L.C. Ramirez G. Matheson A.T. Dennis P.P. J. Mol. Evol. 1989; 29: 448-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This extension plays an important role in the interaction with the P1 and P2 proteins and, therefore, in the formation of the pentameric complex (13.Santos C. Ballesta J.P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20608-20614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, it is able to perform the functions of the complete stalk in the absence of the other components (22.Remacha M. Jimenez-Diaz A. Bermejo B. Rodriguez-Gabriel M.A. Guarinos E. Ballesta J.P.G. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 4754-4762Google Scholar). Protein P0 by itself constitutes the minimal stalk sufficient to support accurate protein synthesis although at a lower rate than the complete stalk (23.Remacha M. Jimenez-Diaz A. Santos C. Zambrano R. Briones E. Rodriguez Gabriel M.A. Guarinos E. Ballesta J.P.G. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 959-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The binding of P1 and P2 proteins, which are present also in an exchangeable cytoplasmic pool, increases the efficiency of the ribosome. This evolutionary peculiarity of the eukaryotic P0 protein seems to have provided the eukaryotic ribosome a way to regulate the translation process that is missing in the prokaryotic organisms (see Ref. 8.Ballesta J.P.G. Remacha M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 55: 157-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, for review). Protein P0 also binds to the GTPase site in the eukaryotic large rRNA. This highly conserved region in the RNA molecule has been shown to be interchangeable between bacteria and eukaryotes (24.Musters W. Gonzalves P.M. Boon K. Raué H.A. van Heerikhuizen H. Planta R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1469-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 25.Thompson J. Muster W. Cundliffe E. Dahlberg A.E. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1499-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, the bacterial and the eukaryotic proteins differ in respect to the RNA binding since, while protein L10 is easily removed from the ribosome by washing with ammonium-ethanol buffers (26.Highland J.H. Howard G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 831-834Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), the eukaryotic polypeptide resists this treatment and remains tightly bound to the ribosome (27.Towbin G. Ramjoue H.-P. Kyster H. Liverani D. Gordon J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12709-12715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two additional functional domains can be clearly defined in the P0 protein in addition to the RNA-binding one, the region involved in the formation of the pentameric complex with P1 and P2, and the region connected to the interaction with the elongation factors, both probably located in the COOH-terminal part. Data on the capacity of P0 protein from different organisms to complement the different functions of the endogenous protein inS. cerevisiae, together with a comparative analysis of the respective amino acid sequences can provide information relative to the functional role of the conserved and non-conserved regions and can help to define more precisely the protein active domains. This type of study has been carried out expressing the RPP0 gene from five different species in a conditional P0 null mutant of S. cerevisiae that carries the genomic RPP0 gene under the control of the inducible GAL1 promoter. S. cerevisiae W303dGP0 (MAT α, leu2-3, 112, ura3-1, trp1-1, his3-11, 15, ade2-1, can1-100, RPP0::URA3-GAL1-RPP0) and S. cerevisiaeD67dGP0 (MAT α, leu2-3, 112, ura3-1, trp1-1, his3-11, 15, ade2-1, can1-100, rpY1α::LEU2, rpYP1β::TRP1, RPP0::URA3-GAL1-RPP0) were derived from S. cerevisiae W303 and D67, respectively, by integration through homologous recombination in the RPP0locus of a construction carrying the P0 coding region fused to the GAL1 promoter (13.Santos C. Ballesta J.P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20608-20614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Yeasts were grown in either YEP medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone) or minimal YNB medium, supplemented with the necessary nutritional requirements. In both cases, the carbon source was either 2% glucose or 2% galactose as indicated. Stock cultures of all yeast strains were maintained in galactose medium. When required, cells were shifted to glucose medium and allowed to grow for at least 20 generations to reach steady state growth conditions. Escherichia coli DH5α was used as a host for the routine maintenance and preparation of plasmids and was grown in LB medium. Restriction endonucleases were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, MBI Fermentas, New England Biolabs, and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and were used as recommended by the suppliers. T4 DNA ligase, calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, and the DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. DNA manipulations were done basically as described in Ref. 28.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar. PCR1 was carried out using PFU DNA polymerase from Perkin Elmer and custom made oligonucleotides from Isogen, following the recommendations of Dieffenbach and Dveksler (29.Dieffenbach C.W. Dveksler G.S. PCR Primer: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995Google Scholar). pFL37 was derived from pFL38 (30.Bonneaud N. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Li G. Labouesse M. Minvielle-Sebastia L. Lacroute F. Yeast. 1991; 7: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) by removing theURA3 marker with BglII and introducing in the same position a BamHI fragment carrying the HIS3marker. BSP0 was obtained by inserting a 2.8-kilobase pairEcoRI-AvaII fragment containing the yeastRPP0 gene in the MCS of Bluescript (13.Santos C. Ballesta J.P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20608-20614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). BSP0Sc(NdeI) was derived from BSP0 by introducing aNdeI restriction site (CATATG) at the initiator ATG in theRPP0 gene by heteroduplex mutagenesis (31.Morinaga Y. Franceschini T. Inouye S. Inouye M. Bio/Technology. 1984; 2: 636-639Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar). pUC-P0Dd resulted from the insertion into the MCS of pUC19 of a 1-kilobase pairEcoRI cDNA fragment from a positive λ phage, containing 10 bases of the 5′-UTR, the coding region and 42 bases of the 3′-UTR of the Dictyostelium discoideum RPP0gene. The positive phage was cloned from an expression library using antibodies specific to the D. discoideum protein (32.Prieto J. Candel E. Coloma A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). A SmaI-XhoI fragment, containing the 5′-UTR, the coding region and the 3′-UTR of S. cerevisiae RPP0 gene from plasmid BSP0, was inserted in the corresponding sites of the pFL37 vector. The D. discoideum RPP0gene as a Klenow-filled 1 -kilobase pair EcoRI fragment from a pUC-P0Dd (32.Prieto J. Candel E. Coloma A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), was subcloned in the blunt-endedNdeI-EcoRI sites of pBSP0Sc(NdeI), substituting the coding region of the S. cerevisiae gene and yielding the plasmid BSP0Dd. When inserted in the correct orientation, the D. discoideum gene in BSP0Dd was under the control of the yeast RPP0 promoter. Afterward, theSmaI-XhoI fragment from BSP0Dd was introduced in the corresponding sites of pFL37. In the four cases a similar strategy was followed. Using appropriate oligonucleotides, the coding region of the P0 protein gene obtained by PCR from either a cDNA library (Aumigatus fumigatus) or previously prepared cDNA clones (Homo sapiens,Rattus norvegicus, and Leishmania infantum). The oligonucleotides were designed to introduce a NdeI site at the initiation end and either an EcoRI site (R. norvegicus and L. infantum) or a NehI site (A. fumigatus and H. sapiens) at the termination end of the coding region. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and eitherEcoRI or NehI and introduced in the corresponding sites of BSP0Sc(NdeI), obtaining plasmids with the heterologous gene under the control of the yeast P0 promoter. The fragment containing the hybrid gene was subcloned in pFL37. Using a conserved EcoRV restriction site present at an equivalent position in both S. cerevisiaeand H. sapiens RPP0 genes, plasmids pFL37-P0Sc and pFL37-P0Hs were treated with EcoRV and EcoRI and the fragment 0.7-kilobase pair fragment derived from the yeast gene, containing the COOH-terminal region of the protein, was subcloned into the restricted pFL37-P0Hs. The resulting pFL37-P0HHY plasmid contains a chimera that encodes a 314-amino acid long protein composed by the first 205 amino acids and the last 109 amino acids from the human and the yeast polypeptide, respectively. This plasmid was prepared taking advantage of a 30-nucleotide long stretch starting around position 400 that is identical in the H. sapiens and S. cerevisiaegenes. Using complementary oligonucleotides to both strands of this region as well as the universal primers at the other end, two PCR fragments were obtained from plasmids BSP0Hs and BSP0Sc. The fragments comprising the 5′ and 3′ regions were derived from the human and yeast genes, respectively. These two fragments together with the universal primers were used for an overlap extension PCR (33.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar) to obtain a chimeric P0HYY gene, which was subcloned as aXhoI-EcoRI fragment into the pFL37 vector. The plasmid was checked by restriction analysis and by DNA sequencing. The protein encoded by the P0HYY gene contains the first 138 amino acids from H. sapiens and the last 176 amino acids from S. cerevisiae. Bacterial transformations were performed according to the procedure of Hanahan (34.Hanahan D. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1985: 109-136Google Scholar). Yeasts were transformed using the lithium acetate method as described (35.Hill H. Donald I.G. Griffiths D.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5791Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Yeasts were grown exponentially in rich YEP medium up toA 600 = 1 and cells were collected by centrifugation and washed with buffer 1 (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm KCl, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Cells in buffer 1 were supplemented with protease inhibitors (0.5 μmol of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.25 μg of leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin per gram of cells), and broken with glass beads. The extract was centrifuged in a Beckman SS-34 rotor (12,000 rpm, 15 min, 4 °C), yielding the supernatant 30 fraction which was afterward submitted to high speed centrifugation at 90,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C in a Beckman TL100.3 rotor. The supernatant S100 fraction was stored at −80 °C and the crude ribosome pellet was resuspended in buffer 2 (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mmAcNH4, 100 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and centrifuged through a discontinuous sucrose gradient (20/40%) in buffer 2 at 90,000 rpm for 120 min at 4 °C in a TL100.3 rotor. The pellet of washed ribosomes was dissolved in buffer 1 and stored at −20 °C. Ribosomal proteins were analyzed either by 15% SDS-PAGE or isoelectrofocusing. Isoelectrofocusing was carried out as described previously (36.Zambrano R. Briones E. Remacha M. Ballesta J.P.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14439-14446Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Particles were pretreated with RNase A (10 μg/mg ribosomes) on ice for 30–45 min. After lyophilization, the samples containing 0.5 mg of ribosomes were resuspended in loading buffer (6% ampholytes, 8 m urea) and directly loaded into a standard vertical gel (5% acrylamide, 0.2% bis-acrylamide, 6 murea, 6% pH 2.5–5.0 ampholytes). As cathode and anode solutions 30 mm NaOH and 180 mmH2SO4 were used at the upper and bottom part of the gel, respectively. Isoelectrofocusing was run in the cold room at 6 mA constant current until the voltage reached 600 V and then at 250 V for 16 h. Proteins were usually detected by standard silver staining. Alternatively, gels were stained in a solution containing 0.25% Coomassie Blue R-250 (Sigma) dissolved in 45% ethanol, 10% acetic acid. After 30 min, gel was destained using the same solution but without Coomassie Blue. Scanning of the bands in the gels was performed using a Molecular Dynamics computing densitometer model 300A. Protein sequencing was performed by Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems 447 automatic peptide sequenator at the Centro de Biologı́a Molecular “Severo Ochoa” Protein Sequencing Service. Proteins in gels were transferred to membranes by electrophoresis in a semi-dry system using Novablot LKB buffer. The membranes were treated with 5% non-fat milk dissolved in TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl) for 30 min and afterward they were incubated for 1 h with the antibody diluted in the same buffer. Subsequently, the membranes were washed 15 min in TBS containing 5% non-fat milk and 0.1% Tween 20. Then, the second antibody (RαM/PO or GαR/PO), diluted in the former buffer, was added and the membranes were incubated for 30 min. Finally, they were washed 15 min with 0.1% Tween 20 in TBS. Bound antibodies were located by detecting peroxidase activity using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and then exposed to film. The reaction was performed in 50-μl samples containing 10 pmol of 80 S ribosomes, 5 μl of S-100, 0.5 mg/ml tRNA, 0.3 mg/ml polyuridylic acid, 40 μm[3H]phenylalanine (120 cpm/pmol), 0.5 mm GTP, 1 mm ATP, 2 mm phosphocreatine, and 40 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 15 mm MgCl2, 90 mm KCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, samples were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, boiled for 10 min, and filtered through glass fiber filters. Radioactivity incorporated in blanks lacking ribosomes was subtracted from all samples. S100 fraction was prepared from S. cerevisiaeD4567, a strain defective in the 12-kDa acidic protein genes (22.Remacha M. Jimenez-Diaz A. Bermejo B. Rodriguez-Gabriel M.A. Guarinos E. Ballesta J.P.G. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 4754-4762Google Scholar). Peptide bond formation was estimated by the “fragment reaction” (37.Monro R. Vazquez D. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 28: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) using N-acetyl-tRNA as substrate. The reaction mixture, in 150 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 270 mmNH4Cl, and 13 mm MgCl2, contained 1 mg/ml ribosomes, 2 mm puromycin, and 1 pmol ofN-[acetyl-3H]tRNA (2500 cpm/pmol). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 1 volume of methanol (33% final concentration), kept at 0 °C for 30 min, and then stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 0.3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, saturated with MgSO4. The samples were extracted with 1.5 ml of ethyl acetate, and 1 ml of the organic phase was checked for radioactivity. Samples lacking ribosomes were used as blanks and subtracted. Binding of N-[acetyl-3H]tRNA to the P site. The assay was performed using 10 pmol of 80 S ribosomes, 0.3 mg/ml polyuridylic acid, and 20 pmol ofN-[acetyl-3H]tRNA (2500 cpm/pmol) in the conditions described previously by Triana et al.(38.Triana-Alonso F.J. Chakraburtty K. Nierhaus K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20473-20478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Blanks without ribosomes were used for background estimation. After incubation for 20 min at 30 °C the samples were filtered using nitrocellulose membranes. S. cerevisiae W303dGP0 carries the essentialRPP0 gene under the control of the GAL1 promoter and it is viable only when grown in galactose as a carbon source (20.Santos C. Ballesta J.P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15689-15696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This strain has been transformed with the plasmids pFL37-P0Af, pFL37-P0Dd, pFL37-P0Rn, and pFL37-P0Li which, respectively, carry the coding sequence of the RPP0 genes from A. fumigatus,D. discoideum, R. norvegicus, and L. infantum under the control of the 5′ regulatory region of the yeast RPP0 gene to assure the same level of expression for all of them. As a positive control, the strain was also transformed with the plasmid pFL37-P0Sc, carrying the S. cerevisiae RPP0 gene. The capacity of the transformed strains to grow in glucose media will define the ability of the heterologous P0 proteins to functionally substitute for the endogenous polypeptide. Due to the existence of a large pool of active ribosomes carrying the yeast P0 protein, the transformants growing in galactose are able to grow in glucose for some time, and usually they have to be transferred to a second glucose plate to clearly detect the effect of the heterologous protein expression. In addition to the strain transformed with the homologous RPP0 gene, cells transformed with pFL37-P0Af, pFL37-P0Dd, and pFL37-P0Rn were able to continuously grow at 30 °C on glucose plates. On the contrary, plasmid pFL37-P0Li did not support the growth of the transformed strain in glucose (Fig.1 A). To test the complementation capacity of the heterologous P0 proteins in the absence of the P1/P2 proteins in the stalk, the S. cerevisiae D67dGP0 strain was used. This strain, like W303dGP0, carries the genomic RPP0 gene under the control of the GAL1 promoter but, as commented in the Introduction, its ribosomes are deprived of acidic P1/P2 proteins (18.Remacha M. Santos C. Bermejo B. Naranda T. Ballesta J.P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12061-12067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Santos C. Ballesta J.P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20608-20614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). None of the S. cerevisiae D67dGP0 transformed strains, except the control expressing the homologous P0, was able to grow in glucose (Fig.1 B). It seems, therefore, that the complementing effect of the P0 proteins from A. fumigatus, D. discoideum, andR. norvegicus requires the presence of the 12-kDa P1/P2 proteins in the ribosome. To test alterations in the stalk composition by the presence of the rat, A. fumigatus, and D. discoideum proteins, washed ribosomes from transformed S. cerevisiae W303dGP0 strains growing in glucose for more than 20 generations were fractionated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and the P0 proteins detected by Western using monoclonal antibody 3BH5, specific to the carboxyl end of the yeast P0 (Fig. 2 A). The intensity of the yeast and rat P0 protein was similar. The ribosomes carrying theA. fumigatus yielded the same results (not shown). The D. discoideum P0 protein was not recognized by the monoclonal 3BH5 antibody since no band is detected in the corresponding sample (Fig. 2 A). These results confirm differences in the sequence of the COOH-terminal peptide of D. discoideum P proteins (32.Prieto J. Candel E. Coloma A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and, in addition, clearly indicate that the endogenous yeast P0 protein from the galactose culture is not present in the glucose-grown cells. The heterologous P0 was detected in this case using a rabbit antiserum raised against the slime mold protein (32.Prieto J. Candel E. Coloma A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The rabbit antiserum, which does not cross-react with the yeast and rat proteins, shows that the D. discoideum P0 is present in the corresponding ribosomes in a similar proportion than in"
https://openalex.org/W1986361344,"Eukaryotic organisms use a similar Rel/NF-κB signaling cascade for the induction of innate immune genes. InDrosophila, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) signal-induced activation of the Rel/NF-κB family transcription factors is an essential step in the transcriptional activation of inducible antimicrobial peptide genes. However, the mechanism by which the LPS-induced signaling pathway proceeds remains largely unknown. Here we have cloned a novel Drosophila LPS-activated kinase (DLAK) that is structurally related to mammalian IκB kinases. DLAK is expressed and transiently activated in LPS-responsiveDrosophila cells following LPS stimulation. Furthermore, DLAK can interact with Cactus, a Drosophila IκB and phosphorylate recombinant Cactus, in vitro. Overexpression of dominant-negative mutant DLAK (DLAKK50A) blocks LPS-induced Cactus degradation. DLAK-bound Cactus can be degraded in a LPS signal-dependent fashion, whereas the DLAKK50A mutant-bound Cactus is completely resistant to degradation in the presence of LPS. The DLAKK50A mutant also inhibits nuclear κB binding activity and κB-dependent diptericin reporter gene activity in a dose-dependent manner, but the κB-dependent diptericin reporter gene activity can be rescued by overexpression of wild type DLAK. Moreover, mRNA analysis of various κB-dependent antimicrobial peptide genes shows that LPS inducibility of these genes is greatly impaired in cells overexpressing DLAKK50A. These results establish that DLAK is a novel LPS-activated kinase, which is an essential signaling component for the induction of antimicrobial peptide genes following LPS treatment in Drosophilacells."
https://openalex.org/W1995831169,"Pantophysin, a protein related to the neuroendocrine-specific synaptophysin, recently has been identified in non-neuronal tissues. In the present study, Northern blots showed that pantophysin mRNA was abundant in adipose tissue and increased during adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells. Immunoblot analysis of subcellular fractions showed pantophysin present exclusively in membrane fractions and relatively evenly distributed in the plasma membrane and internal membrane fractions. Sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation demonstrated that pantophysin and GLUT4 exhibited overlapping distribution profiles. Furthermore, immunopurified GLUT4 vesicles contained pantophysin, and both GLUT4 and pantophysin were depleted from this vesicle population following treatment with insulin.

Homozygous deletion of the synaptophysin gene in mice caused no identifiable phenotype; synaptic vesicles appeared to traffic normally in these animals (27.Eshkind L.G. Leube R.E. Cell Tissue Res. 1995; 282: 423-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 28.McMahon H.T. Bolshakov V.Y. Janz R. Hammer R.E. Siegelbaum S.A. Sudhof T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4760-4764Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), suggesting that related proteins may function in the place of the deleted synaptophysin. Indeed, synaptophysin-related molecules have been described (29.Bixby J. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 13: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 30.Zhong C. Hayzer D.J. Runge M.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1129: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 31.Leube R.E. Differentiation. 1994; 56: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 32.Takeshima H. Shimuta M. Komazaki S. Ohmi K. Iino M. Miyata A. Kangawa K. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Recently, the cDNA for pantophysin, a protein with sequence similarity to synaptophysin, was cloned from non-neuroendocrine cells (31.Leube R.E. Differentiation. 1994; 56: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 33.Haass N.K. Kartenbeck J. Leube R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 731-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Pantophysin displays only a 43% overall amino acid sequence identity to synaptophysin. The primary structure of pantophysin features four putative transmembrane domains similar to those of synaptophysin; however, pantophysin differs from synaptophysin in the cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal domains. Pantophysin mRNA and protein have been shown to be expressed in a variety of tissues and cell lines. Immunofluorescent microscopy of cultured cells showed co-localization of endogenous pantophysin with secretory carrier membrane proteins and the v-SNARE cellubrevin (33.Haass N.K. Kartenbeck J. Leube R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 731-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Based on these studies, pantophysin is proposed to be associated with small cytoplasmic transport vesicles; however, very little is known about the function of pantophysin in vesicle trafficking and fusion events. The aim of the present investigation was to characterize pantophysin in adipocytes and to explore the possibility that pantophysin may be used as a marker and potential tool for analysis of transport vesicles in adipocytes. As a model of SNARE complex regulation in GLUT4 translocation emerges, the relation of endogenous pantophysin to GLUT4-containing vesicles and the involvement of pantophysin in the trafficking of GLUT4 is of interest. Moreover, the relation of pantophysin to the transport of other vesicles in adipocytes is of importance to the characterization of regulated vesicle trafficking processes in these cells. All tissue culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. with the exception of calf serum, which was purchased from HyClone (Logan, UT). Human insulin was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Protogel acrylamide/bis-acrylamide solution was from National Diagnostics (Atlanta, GA), bovine serum albumin was from Intergen Company (Purchase, NY), and all other chemicals were from Sigma or Fisher unless otherwise noted. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were maintained in DMEM containing 10% calf serum (34.Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1974; 1: 113-116Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (746) Google Scholar). Following growth to confluence, adipogenesis was induced with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, dexamethasone, isobutylmethylxanthine, and insulin as described (35.de Herreros A.G. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9885-9890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For differentiation samples, cells were harvested at 2-day intervals throughout adipogenesis and were lysed in PBS, 2% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 mm PMSF. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford analysis (Bio-Rad). Human and rat synaptophysin and rat synaptoporin protein sequences as well as the translation product of the synaptophysin-related h-Sp1 (GenBankTMAccession number S72481) were aligned using the Jotun Hein algorithm in the DNASTAR MegAlign program. Degenerate oligonucleotide primers were designed based on peptides in two of the four highly conserved transmembrane regions of synaptophysin. The primer PAN5, 5′-GGI TT(C/T) (G/A)TI AA(A/G) GTI (C/T)TI (C/G)A(A/G) TGG-3′ (bases in parenthesis represent degenerate bases; I, inosine), encodes the peptide GF(V/I)KVL(Q/E)W located in the first transmembrane domain. The primer PAN3, 5′-(G/A)(T/A)A IAC (G/A)AA CCA I(A/G)I (G/A)TT ICC I(C/A)C CCA-3′ encodes the peptide W(V/G)GN(L/A)WFV(F/Y) located in the fourth transmembrane domain. These primers were used in RT-PCR with mRNA isolated from differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes as described below. The reverse transcription was performed using superscript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to manufacturer's instructions. The PCR cycling profile was: 94 °C for 3 min, 45 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min followed by 29 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 45 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. The 600-bp product of RT-PCR was subcloned into pCRII (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions for dideoxy chain termination sequence determination using T7 polymerase (Sequenase version 2.0, United States Biochemical, Cleveland, OH) (36.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52771) Google Scholar). This 600-bp fragment was used as a hybridization probe to isolate full-length clones from a cDNA library made from differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes (17.Baldini G. Hohl T. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5049-5052Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Five independent clones were isolated, and their sequence was determined. To obtain a complete cDNA, 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends was performed using the CLONTECH 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends kit according to manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Poly(A)+mRNA was isolated from 3T3-L1 cells during differentiation to adipocytes at Day 0 (fibroblast stage) and Day 8 (fully differentiated adipocytes) and from murine tissues as described (17.Baldini G. Hohl T. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5049-5052Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). RNA (1 μg) was separated by electrophoresis in 1.0% formaldehyde-agarose denaturing gels and transferred to Biotrans nylon membranes (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Costa Mesa, CA). The 600-bp fragment of the pantophysin cDNA obtained by RT-PCR or the mSec23 cDNA (37.Wadhwa R. Kaul S.C. Komatsu Y. Ikawa Y. Sarai A. Sugimoto Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) (kind gift of Dr. David Shaywitz) was 32P-labeled by random priming and used at 2 × 106 cpm/ml in hybridizations overnight at 42 °C in 50% formamide; 5× SSC (1× = 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate, pH 7); 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0; 10× Denhardt's solution; 5 mm EDTA; 1% SDS; 0.1 mg/ml poly(A). Membranes were washed in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS and in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C prior to autoradiography. Triton-soluble lysates and subcellular membrane fractions were adjusted to equal protein concentrations by dilution with HES (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4; 250 mm sucrose; 1 mm EDTA; 10 μg/ml aprotinin; 1 μg/ml leupeptin; 2 mm PMSF) and solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE, electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell), blocked in Tris-buffered saline, 0.5% Tween-20, 3% BSA and analyzed by immunoblotting with α-GLUT4, α-pantophysin, α-VAMP2, or α-insulin-responsive aminopeptidase (IRAP). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised (Covance, Denver, PA) against synthetic peptides corresponding to the 12 C-terminal amino acids of human GLUT4, the 16 N-terminal amino acids of murine VAMP2, or the 14 N-terminal amino acids of VAMP3 and against GST fusion proteins coding for either the 26 C-terminal amino acids of murine pantophysin or the 80 N-terminal amino acids of murine IRAP. These antisera were used at 1:100 to 1:200 dilution and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. Membranes were washed in Tris-buffered saline, 0.5% Tween-20, and immunoreactive protein was detected by incubation with125I-labeled protein A (NEN Life Science Products) followed by autoradiography (BioMax MR, Eastman Kodak Co.) for 18–48 h at −80 °C with an intensifying screen. Intensities of bands on autoradiographs were measured using a Molecular Dynamics densitometer. Fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were starved overnight in DMEM, 0.1% BSA and incubated in the absence or presence of 100 nm insulin for 10 min. Cells were washed with PBS and lysed in harvest buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4; 1% Triton X-100; 150 mm NaCl; 10 μg/ml aprotinin; 1 μg/ml leupeptin; 2 mm PMSF). Triton-soluble material was incubated with α-pantophysin overnight followed by the addition of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with harvest buffer, solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were starved overnight in DMEM, 0.1% BSA and incubated in the absence or presence of 100 nm insulin for 10 min. Cells were washed with PBS and harvested in HES buffer and homogenized using 26 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. Following the removal of the fat layer, the supernatant from a 10-min 16,000 × gcentrifugation was centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 30 min to obtain a high density microsomal (HDM) pellet, which was resuspended in HES buffer. The 48,000 × g supernatant was centrifuged at 210,000 × g for 50 min to obtain a low density microsomal (LDM) pellet, which was resuspended in HES buffer. The 16,000 × g pellet was washed with HES buffer, resuspended in HES buffer, layered over a 1.12 msucrose cushion, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The PM at the interface was removed, collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in HES buffer. Whole cell lysates or membrane protein samples were boiled in 0.5% SDS for 3 min. Samples were diluted and incubated overnight at 37 °C in glycosidase buffer (PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2 mm PMSF) containing two units ofN-glycosidase F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by immunoblotting with α-pantophysin. Sucrose velocity and equilibrium density gradient centrifugations were carried out essentially as described (38.Kandror K.V. Coderre L. Pushkin A.V. Pilch P.F. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were homogenized, and LDM was prepared from control or insulin-treated cells as described above for subcellular fractionation. The LDM pellet was resuspended in buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4; 1 mm EDTA; 5% sucrose. For velocity gradient centrifugation, the resuspended LDM was layered on top of a 10–30% continuous sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 4 °C for 55 min at 150,000 ×g. For equilibrium density centrifugation, the resuspended LDM was layered onto a 10–50% continuous sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 4 °C for 16 h at 150,000 × g. Fractions were collected from the bottom of the gradients and subjected to protein determination, SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting. Fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were starved overnight in DMEM, 0.1% BSA and incubated in the absence or presence of 100 nm insulin for 15 min prior to harvesting. Cells were washed with PBS, harvested in HES buffer, and homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer. Supernatants of a 10 min 16,000 × g centrifugation were centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 30 min. The fat cake was removed and the supernatant, containing LDMs, was adjusted to 150 mmNaCl. Following preclearing of the LDM fraction with protein A-Trisacryl beads (Pierce), samples were incubated with antibodies (non-immune sera, α-GLUT4, or α-pantophysin) pre-coupled to protein A-Trisacryl beads. Samples were washed extensively with PBS and solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Following separation by SDS-PAGE, samples were analyzed by immunoblotting with α-GLUT4, α-pantophysin, or α-IRAP. Fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were starved overnight in DMEM, 0.1% BSA. The cells were then incubated in phosphate-free DMEM containing 0.1 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 2 h followed by incubation for 10 min in the absence or presence of 100 nm insulin. The cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and harvested in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4; 1% Nonidet P-40; 1 μg/ml leupeptin; 1 μg/ml aprotinin; 2 mm PMSF; 2 mm sodium orthovanadate; 100 mm NaF; 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate. The lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g, and immunoprecipitates with non-immune serum or α-pantophysin were prepared as described above. Samples were solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. Synaptophysin contains four membrane-spanning regions and cytoplasmic N and C termini (39.Johnston P.A. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1268-1273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human and rat synaptophysin, rat synaptoporin, and a synaptophysin-like protein h-Sp1 were aligned, and DNA sequences encoding the highly conserved transmembrane domains were chosen as targets for degenerate oligonucleotide primers in RT-PCR using mRNA isolated from fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes as template. The upstream primer encoded eight amino acids (GF(V/I)KVL(Q/E)W) located in the first transmembrane domain and the downstream primer encoded the peptide W(V/G)GN(L/A)WFV(F/Y) located in the fourth transmembrane domain. After RT-PCR, a fragment of the predicted size (600 bp) was obtained and was used as a hybridization probe to isolate a full-length clone from a cDNA library made from differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes (17.Baldini G. Hohl T. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5049-5052Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Five independent clones were isolated; their sequences were determined and shown to correspond to the previously identified protein pantophysin (31.Leube R.E. Differentiation. 1994; 56: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 33.Haass N.K. Kartenbeck J. Leube R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 731-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In all clones isolated, the sequence at the 5′-end of the clone began with a methionine codon. To determine whether this methionine codon corresponded to the start of translation, the 5′-end of the clone was completed using 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The additional 5′-sequence (42 nucleotides) was analyzed and confirmed the methionine identified in the original clone as the translational start site. The sequence coding for the amino acids “MASKANMVRQRFSRLSQR” previously reported for the mouse pantophysin protein was not obtained (31.Leube R.E. Differentiation. 1994; 56: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This difference may reflect a tissue-specific alternate transcriptional start site; however, the possibility cannot be excluded that the mRNA coding for these additional N-terminal amino acids is expressed at low levels in adipocytes. To begin to characterize the distribution and function of pantophysin in adipocytes, differentiation-dependent expression of pantophysin mRNA was examined. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from 3T3-L1 cells at Day 0 (fibroblast stage) and Day 8 (fully-differentiated adipocytes) during differentiation, and Northern blot analysis was performed using the 32P-labeled 600-bp fragment obtained by RT-PCR as probe. As indicated in Fig.1 A, the steady-state level of the 2.1-kilobase pantophysin mRNA increased 1.7-fold (± 0.3) between Day 0 and Day 8 during differentiation from fibroblasts to adipocytes. In addition, Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+RNA prepared from various murine tissues indicated that pantophysin mRNA was abundantly expressed in adipose compared with the other tissues examined (Fig. 1 B). To assess the expression of pantophysin protein throughout differentiation, Triton-soluble protein lysates were immunoblotted with a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against the C-terminal 26 amino acids of murine pantophysin. The α-pantophysin recognized a broad band that exhibited a differentiation-dependent alteration in electrophoretic mobility (predicted MW = 28,000) (Fig.2 A). The diffuse pattern of migration is consistent with N-linked glycosylation and variable processing. A similar observation has been made for synaptophysin, and both proteins contain a potentialN-glycosylation site in the first intravesicular loop (33.Haass N.K. Kartenbeck J. Leube R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 731-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To verify glycosylation of pantophysin, protein samples were treated with N-glycosidase F, which cleaves asparagine-linked glycans (40.Tarentino A.L. Gomez C.M. Plummer T. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4665-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis revealed that treatment withN-glycosidase F resulted in collapse of the broad pantophysin band to a single immunoreactive species migrating at the predicted molecular weight and that steady-state protein levels remained relatively constant throughout adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells (Fig. 2 B). To determine the subcellular distribution of pantophysin in adipocytes and whether this distribution was altered by insulin, PM, HDM, and LDM fractions were prepared by differential centrifugation of control or insulin-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. For precise measurement of pantophysin, each subcellular membrane fraction was treated with N-glycosidase F to produce the single migrating species of pantophysin. Immunoblots of these fractions using α-pantophysin showed that in the basal state pantophysin was localized to the PM, LDM, and HDM fractions. Pantophysin was not observed in the cytosolic fraction (data not shown). As shown in Fig.3, insulin stimulated the redistribution of pantophysin from internal membrane fractions to the PM by a modest but significant 1.4-fold (p < 0.05, determined by Student's t test comparing control versusinsulin-treated samples), much less than the insulin-stimulated recruitment of GLUT4 to the PM (3–5-fold). Similar results for the insulin-stimulated redistribution of pantophysin were obtained from experiments using freshly isolated rat epididymal adipocytes (data not shown). To further characterize pantophysin-containing vesicles, the LDM fraction of 3T3-L1 adipocytes was analyzed by velocity and equilibrium density gradient ultracentrifugation. For separation of the vesicles based on their relative size, LDM pellets from 3T3-L1 adipocytes were resuspended and separated on a continuous 10–30% sucrose velocity gradient as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fractions from the velocity gradient were taken from the bottom to the top and subjected to protein determination and analyzed by immunoblotting for pantophysin and GLUT4. Pantophysin exhibited a broad distribution profile indicative of variably sized vesicles; GLUT4 showed a more distinct peak; however, considerable overlap between the two vesicle populations was observed (Fig.4 A). Further analysis of these vesicle populations by equilibrium density ultracentrifugation showed nearly identical distribution profiles for pantophysin and GLUT4, suggesting that pantophysin- and GLUT4-containing vesicles within the LDM are of similar buoyant densities (Fig. 4 B). The effect of insulin on the distribution of pantophysin- and GLUT4-containing vesicles was examined using equilibrium density centrifugation of the LDM fractions isolated from control or insulin-treated cells. This analysis indicated that insulin stimulated the redistribution of GLUT4 out of the LDM compartment as expected (Fig. 5 A). In addition, insulin stimulated a redistribution of pantophysin out of the LDM (Fig.5 B). This is in agreement with the immunoblot analysis of subcellular fractions from 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 3); however, a more pronounced insulin effect on"

Nucleotide sequence analysis of a cDNA clone encoding full-length AAG showed an open reading frame with 1641 base pairs, corresponding to a 547-amino acid residue preproprotein containing a signal peptide and a linker region (two amino acid residues) between the AAG-A and AAG-B subunits. AAG had high homology to ABRa (77.8%). The 13 amino acid residues involved in catalytic function, which are highly conserved among abrins and ricins, were also conserved within AAG-A. The protein synthesis inhibitory activity of AAG-A (IC50 = 3.5 nm) was weaker than that of ABRa-A (0.05 nm). Molecular modeling followed by site-directed mutagenesis showed that Pro199 of AAG-A, located in amphiphilic helix H and corresponding to Asn200of ABRa-A, can induce bending of helix H. This bending would presumably affect the binding of AAG-A to its target sequence, GpApGpAp, in the tetraloop structure of the 28 S rRNA subunit and could be one of the major factors contributing to the relatively weak protein synthesis inhibitory activity and toxicity of AAG.

RIPs can cleave a synthetic RNA structure with a short double-helical stem and a loop containing a centered GpApGpAp sequence, the first A being the cleavage site (3.Endo Y. Gluck A. Wool I.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The depurination blocks the ability of ribosomes to bind to elongation factor-2 (4.Jimenez A. Vazquez D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1985; 39: 649-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), thereby inhibiting protein synthesis.There are two categories of RIP, type I (single chain) and type II (two chains) (5.Barbieri L. Stripe F. Cancer Surv. 1982; 1: 489-520Google Scholar). Type II RIPs contain two types of subunit: the B chain, a lectin with two d-galactose moiety-binding sites (6.Nicolson G.L. Blaustein J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 266: 543-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar); and the A chain, which inhibits protein synthesis (7.Olsnes S. Phil A. Cuatrecasas P. Receptors and Recognition Series: The Specificity and Action of Animal, Bacterial and Plant Toxins. 31. Chapman and Hall Ltd., London1982: 131Google Scholar). The B chain facilitates translocation of type II RIPs into cells. Type I RIPs, such as trichosanthin and momorcharin (8.Ma X.Q. Wang Y.P. Wang J.H. Sci. Sin. Ser. B. 1987; 30: 692-697Google Scholar, 9.Huang Q. Liu S. Tang Y. Jin S. Wang Y. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), carry the toxophoric A chain only. Because they lack the B chain and therefore cannot be easily translocated into cells, they are less toxic than type II RIPs (10.Stripe F. Barbieri L. Battelli M.G. Soria M. Lappi D.A. Bio/Technology. 1992; 10: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar).Two kinds of type II RIP have been isolated from jequirity bean, the plant Abrus precatorius (5.Barbieri L. Stripe F.

One kind, abrin (ABR), is extremely toxic to eukaryotic cells; the other kind, Abrusagglutinin (AAG), is of low toxicity. ABRs are heterodimeric glycoproteins, whereas AAG is a heterotetrameric glycoprotein. Both of these type II RIPs inhibit the growth of tumors in experimental animals (7.Olsnes S. Phil A. Cuatrecasas P. Receptors and Recognition Series: The Specificity and Action of Animal, Bacterial and Plant Toxins. 31. Chapman and Hall Ltd., London1982: 131Google Scholar, 12.Lin J.Y. Li J.S. Tung T.C. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1981; 66: 523-528PubMed Google Scholar); ABR is 10–100 times more toxic to some transformed cell lines than to normal cells (13.Nicolson G.L. Lacorbiere M. Hunter T.R. Cancer Res. 1972; 35: 144-155Google Scholar).Many attempts have been made to study the structure and function of these toxic proteins; this interest has been stimulated in part by the use of the A chain in the preparation of immunotoxins for cancer chemotherapy (14.Oeltmann T.N. Frankel A.E. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2334-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 15.Brinkmann U. Pai L.H. FitzGerald D.J. Willingham M. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cancer Inst. 1981; 66: 523-528PubMed Google Scholar). However, ABRa is extremely toxic, with an LD50 of 20 μg/kg of body weight; the LD50 of the relatively nontoxic AAG, on the other hand, is 5 mg/kg of body weight (10.Stripe F. Barbieri L. Battelli M.G. Soria M. Lappi D.A. Bio/Technology. 1992; 10: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The remarkable disparity prompted us to examine the causes for this difference in the toxicity of ABRa and AAG at the molecular level.In this paper, we report the determination of the amino acid sequence of AAG by protein techniques and the molecular cloning of the cDNA encoding AAG. Using molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis, we found that Asn200 of ABRa-A and Pro199 of AAG-A are involved in the differences in the protein synthesis inhibition and toxicity of these two type II RIPs.DISCUSSIONThe results of this study show that AAG is composed of 547 amino acid residues: 258 residues in AAG-A and 267 residues in AAG-B plus a 2-residue linker and a 20-residue signal peptide. Alignment of the amino acid sequence of AAG with those of ABRa, ABRb, and ABRd (32.Hung C.H. Lee M.C. Lee T.C. Lin J.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) shows considerable similarity among these four type II RIPs, with 347 invariant amino acid residues (66.1%) (Fig. 3); there are 382, 368, and 380 invariant residues between AAG and ABRa, ABRb, and ABRd, respectively.The phylogenic tree constructed from the sequence similarity suggests that the three isoabrins are more closely related to each other than to AAG (33.Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gison T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55203) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the isoabrins have been classified into two subtypes according to their N-terminal sequence; the N-terminal amino acid sequence of type A-1 (ABRa) is Glu-Asp-Arg-Pro-Ile-Lys-Phe, whereas that of type A-2 (ABRb and ABRd) is Gln-Asp-Gln-Val-Ile-Lys-Phe (32.Hung C.H. Lee M.C. Lee T.C. Lin J.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Comparison of the amino acid sequence of AAG-A with those of ABRs indicated that the isoabrins were derived from AAG (Fig.3).Analysis of the primary structure of AAG revealed the presence of three putative consensus sequences (Asn-Xan-(Ser/Thr)) for Asn-linked oligosaccharide chain attachment; AAG-B contains glycosylation sites at Asn110 and Asn140, which are also present in ABRa-B, whereas AAG-A contains a new N-glycosylation site at Asn250, which is not present in ABRa-A. Steric hindrance by the oligosaccharide at this putative glycosylation site, Asn250-Ala251-Thr252, could render AAG-A resistant to proteolytic digestion at Asn250-Ala251 during post-translational processing. The AAG-A cDNA was cloned and expressed in E. coli, and purified reAAG-A was found to be as biologically active as native AAG-A, with an IC50 of 3.5 nm. This suggests that glycosylation at Asn250 of AAG-A is not indispensable for its biologic activity.The putative endopeptidase cleavage sites of the AAG precursor are Ile258-Arg259, at the N terminus of the linker dipeptide, and Ser260-Val261, at the C terminus of the linker peptide (Fig. 6). Thus, whereas the internal linker of the ABRa precursor is cleaved as a decapeptide (34.Hung C.H. Lee M.C. Lin J.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 1524-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the AAG proprotein is cleaved at Ile258-Arg259, releasing the internal linker dipeptide Arg-Ser. Several plant lectins and trypsin inhibitors have been reported to share similar post-translational processing. The C-terminal cleavage site of the AAG proprotein is the same as those of ABRa-A and Acacia confusa trypsin inhibitor, whereas the N-terminal cleavage site differs from those of ABRa-A and A. confusa trypsin inhibitor (34.Hung C.H. Lee M.C. Lin J.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 1524-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The cleavage sites of AAG and the ABRs are also quite different from those of ricin (35.Lamb F.I. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 148: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), Ricinus communis agglutinin (36.Roberts L.M. Lamb F.I. Pappin D.J. Lord J.M. J. Biol.

Sci. 1984; 304: 287-296Crossref Google Scholar).The cDNAs of the A chains of three ABRs have been cloned and expressed in E. coli (25.Hung C.H. Lee M.C. Chen J.K. Lin J.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 32.Hung C.H. Lee M.C. Lee T.C. Lin J.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallographic analysis of type II RIPs has been carried out (27.Tahirov T.H. Lu T.H. Liaw Y.C. Chen Y.-L. Lin J.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 354-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 39.Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins Struct. Funct.

Genet. 1991; 10: 260-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The invariant amino acid residues clustered together around the ABRa putative active site are Tyr74, Tyr113, Glu164, Arg167, and Trp198. Site-directed mutagenesis studies of these residues showed that Glu164 and Arg167 are directly involved in catalysis, whereas Tyr74, Tyr113, and Trp198 are involved in substrate binding (25.Hung C.H. Lee M.C. Chen J.K. Lin J.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 26.Chen J.K. Hung C.H. Liaw Y.C. Lin J.Y. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 827-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).The invariant amino acid residues conserved among most RIPs are also conserved in AAG-A. However, AAG-A has only a very weak inhibitory activity (IC50 = 3.5 nm) compared with ABRa-A (IC50 = 0.05 nm) despite the structural similarity of the two. Comparison of the structures of these two proteins revealed that Asn200 of ABRa-A, corresponding to Arg213 of the ricin A chain, is required for the binding of substrate to the GpApGpAp sequence in the tetraloop located at the 3′-terminal region of 28 S rRNA (43.Monzingo A.F. Robertus J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 1136-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 44.Kitaoka Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, in AAG-A, this residue is replaced by Pro199. This substitution could cause bending of amphiphilic helix H of AAG-A, thus hindering the interactions between AAG-A and its substrate at the centered GpApGpAp sequence. A similar situation has been reported previously (45.Terwilliger T.C. Eisenberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6016-6022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in which Pro14 of melittin caused 120° bending between segments 1–10 and 14–26 of the α-helix. Replacement of Asn200 of ABRa-A with Pro by site-directed mutagenesis remarkably increased the IC50, whereas substitution of Pro199 with Asn markedly decreased the IC50 of AAG-A. This suggests that Asn200 of ABRa-A is important for its inhibitory activity.ABRa and AAG have similar therapeutic indexes for the treatment of experimental mice with tumors (12.Lin J.Y. Li J.S. Tung T.C. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1981; 66: 523-528PubMed Google Scholar), but AAG has much lower toxicity (LD50 = 5 mg/kg of body weight) compared with ABRa (LD50 = 20 μg/kg of body weight). In our recent studies, AAG and ABRa were found to cause apoptosis; the antitumor activity is significantly correlated with apoptosis. 2S.-F. Shih, Y.-H. Wu, C.-H. Hung, C.-L. Liu, C.-C. Tsai, S.-C. Lin, L.-I. Wang, C.-I. Hsu, M.-J. Hwang, and J.-Y. Lin, unpublished data. Further investigations are needed to study the apoptosis induced by AAG and ABRa with the goal of developing immunotoxins for cancer chemotherapy. Ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs)1 compose a family ofN-glycosidases that cleave a specific adenine residue from the α-sarcin-ricin loop of the 28 S rRNA. In rats, for example, RIPs were found to hydrolyze the C–N glycosidic bond of the adenosine residue at position 4324 of the 28 S rRNA subunit (1.Endo Y. Tsurugi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8128-8130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Endo Y. Misui K. Motizuki K. Tsurugi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5908-5912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RIPs can cleave a synthetic RNA structure with a short double-helical stem and a loop containing a centered GpApGpAp sequence, the first A being the cleavage site (3.Endo Y. Gluck A. Wool I.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The depurination blocks the ability of ribosomes to bind to elongation factor-2 (4.Jimenez A. Vazquez D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1985; 39: 649-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), thereby inhibiting protein synthesis. There are two categories of RIP, type I (single chain) and type II (two chains) (5.Barbieri L. Stripe F. Cancer Surv. 1982; 1: 489-520Google Scholar). Type II RIPs contain two types of subunit: the B chain, a lectin with two d-galactose moiety-binding sites (6.Nicolson G.L. Blaustein J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 266: 543-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar); and the A chain, which inhibits protein synthesis (7.Olsnes S. Phil A. Cuatrecasas P. Receptors and Recognition Series: The Specificity and Action of Animal, Bacterial and Plant Toxins. 31. Chapman and Hall Ltd., London1982: 131Google Scholar). The B chain facilitates translocation of type II RIPs into cells. Type I RIPs, such as trichosanthin and momorcharin (8.Ma X.Q. Wang Y.P. Wang J.H. Sci. Sin. Ser. B. 1987; 30: 692-697Google Scholar, 9.Huang Q. Liu S. Tang Y. Jin S. Wang Y. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), carry the toxophoric A chain only. Because they lack the B chain and therefore cannot be easily translocated into cells, they are less toxic than type II RIPs (10.Stripe F. Barbieri L. Battelli M.G. Soria M. Lappi D.A. Bio/Technology. 1992; 10: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Two kinds of type II RIP have been isolated from jequirity bean, the plant Abrus precatorius (5.Barbieri L. Stripe F. Cancer Surv. 1982; 1: 489-520Google Scholar, 11.Lin J.Y. Lee T.C. Hu S.T. Tung T.C. Toxicon. 1981; 19: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). One kind, abrin (ABR), is extremely toxic to eukaryotic cells; the other kind, Abrusagglutinin (AAG), is of low toxicity. ABRs are heterodimeric glycoproteins, whereas AAG is a heterotetrameric glycoprotein. Both of these type II RIPs inhibit the growth of tumors in experimental animals (7.Olsnes S. Phil A. Cuatrecasas P. Receptors and Recognition Series: The Specificity and Action of Animal, Bacterial and Plant Toxins. 31. Chapman and Hall Ltd., London1982: 131Google Scholar, 12.Lin J.Y. Li J.S. Tung T.C. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1981; 66: 523-528PubMed Google Scholar); ABR is 10–100 times more toxic to some transformed cell lines than to normal cells (13.Nicolson G.L. Lacorbiere M. Hunter T.R. Cancer Res. 1972; 35: 144-155Google Scholar). Many attempts have been made to study the structure and function of these toxic proteins; this interest has been stimulated in part by the use of the A chain in the preparation of immunotoxins for cancer chemotherapy (14.Oeltmann T.N. Frankel A.E. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2334-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 15.Brinkmann U. Pai L.H. FitzGerald D.J. Willingham M. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8616-8620Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The therapeutic indexes of AAG and ABRa are similar (12.Lin J.Y. Li J.S. Tung T.C. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1981; 66: 523-528PubMed Google Scholar). However, ABRa is extremely toxic, with an LD50 of 20 μg/kg of body weight; the LD50 of the relatively nontoxic AAG, on the other hand, is 5 mg/kg of body weight (10.Stripe F. Barbieri L.

Several plant lectins and trypsin inhibitors have been reported to share similar post-translational processing. The C-terminal cleavage site of the AAG proprotein is the same as those of ABRa-A and Acacia confusa trypsin inhibitor, whereas the N-terminal cleavage site differs from those of ABRa-A and A. confusa trypsin inhibitor (34.Hung C.H. Lee M.C. Lin J.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 1524-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The cleavage sites of AAG and the ABRs are also quite different from those of ricin (35.Lamb F.I. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 148: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), Ricinus communis agglutinin (36.Roberts L.M. Lamb F.I. Pappin D.J. Lord J.M. J. Biol.

The cDNAs of the A chains of three ABRs have been cloned and expressed in E. coli (25.Hung C.H. Lee M.C. Chen J.K. Lin J.Y. Eur. J.

Genet. 1991; 10: 260-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The invariant amino acid residues clustered together around the ABRa putative active site are Tyr74, Tyr113, Glu164, Arg167, and Trp198. Site-directed mutagenesis studies of these residues showed that Glu164 and Arg167 are directly involved in catalysis, whereas Tyr74, Tyr113, and Trp198 are involved in substrate binding (25.Hung C.H. Lee M.C. Chen J.K. Lin J.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 26.Chen J.K. Hung C.H. Liaw Y.C. Lin J.Y. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 827-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The invariant amino acid residues conserved among most RIPs are also conserved in AAG-A. However, AAG-A has only a very weak inhibitory activity (IC50 = 3.5 nm) compared with ABRa-A (IC50 = 0.05 nm) despite the structural similarity of the two. Comparison of the structures of these two proteins revealed that Asn200 of ABRa-A, corresponding to Arg213 of the ricin A chain, is required for the binding of substrate to the GpApGpAp sequence in the tetraloop located at the 3′-terminal region of 28 S rRNA (43.Monzingo A.F. Robertus J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 1136-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 44.Kitaoka Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, in AAG-A, this residue is replaced by Pro199. This substitution could cause bending of amphiphilic helix H of AAG-A, thus hindering the interactions between AAG-A and its substrate at the centered GpApGpAp sequence. A similar situation has been reported previously (45.Terwilliger T.C. Eisenberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6016-6022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in which Pro14 of melittin caused 120° bending between segments 1–10 and 14–26 of the α-helix. Replacement of Asn200 of ABRa-A with Pro by site-directed mutagenesis remarkably increased the IC50, whereas substitution of Pro199 with Asn markedly decreased the IC50 of AAG-A. This suggests that Asn200 of ABRa-A is important for its inhibitory activity. ABRa and AAG have similar therapeutic indexes for the treatment of experimental mice with tumors (12.Lin J.Y. Li J.S. Tung T.C. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1981; 66: 523-528PubMed Google Scholar), but AAG has much lower toxicity (LD50 = 5 mg/kg of body weight) compared with ABRa (LD50 = 20 μg/kg of body weight). In our recent studies, AAG and ABRa were found to cause apoptosis; the antitumor activity is significantly correlated with apoptosis. 2S.-F. Shih, Y.-H. Wu, C.-H. Hung, C.-L. Liu, C.-C. Tsai, S.-C.

https://openalex.org/W2008958781,"DNA methylation is important for mammalian development and the control of gene expression. Recent data suggest that DNA methylation causes chromatin closure and gene silencing. During development, tissue specifically expressed gene loci become selectively demethylated in the appropriate cell types by poorly understood processes. Locus control regions (LCRs), which are cis-acting elements providing stable, tissue-specific expression to linked transgenes in chromatin, may play a role in tissue-specific DNA demethylation. We studied the methylation status of the LCR for the mouse T-cell receptor α/δ locus using a novel assay for scanning large distances of DNA for methylation sites. Tissue-specific functions of this LCR depend largely on two DNase I-hypersensitive site clusters (HS), HS1 (T-cell receptor α enhancer) and HS1′. We report that these HS induce lymphoid organ-specific DNA demethylation in a region located 3.8 kilobases away with little effect on intervening, methylated DNA. This demethylation is impaired in mice with a germline deletion of the HS1/HS1′ clusters. Using 5′-deletion mutants of a transgenic LCR reporter gene construct, we show that HS1′ can act in the absence of HS1 to direct this tissue-specific DNA demethylation event. Thus, elements of an LCR can control tissue-specific DNA methylation patterns both in transgenes and inside its native locus.

Studies of mice deficient in the DNA methylation machinery have shown that this process is required for successful mouse development (1.Li E. Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 915-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3183) Google Scholar). Mammalian DNA methyltransferase (2.Bestor T. Laudano A. Mattaliano R. Ingram V. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 971-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar) catalyzes the addition of a methyl group at the 5 position of the cytosine ring in the CpG dinucleotide. The recently identified DNA demethylase catalyzes the reversal of this process (3.Bhattacharya S.K. Ramchandani S. Cervoni N. Szyf M. Nature. 1999; 397: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Differential methylation of genomic loci is implicated in cancerous transformation, genome stability, and tissue-specific gene expression. The effect of DNA hypermethylation has been implicated in the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes (4.Gonzalez-Zulueta M. Bender C.M. Yang A.S. Nguyen T. Beart R.W. Tornout J.M.V. Jones P.A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4531-4535PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Foster S.A. Wong D.J. Barrett M.T. Galloway D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1793-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 6.Herman J.G.

Biol. 1998; 18: 6457-6473Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), and DNA undermethylation has been shown to lead to elevated mutation rates (8.Chen R.Z. Pettersson U. Beard C. Jackson-Grusby L. Jaenisch R. Nature. 1998; 395: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). During embryogenesis, a post-fertilization period of DNA demethylation removes the methyl groups from these C residues in the genome, thus erasing the germ cell DNA methylation patterns. Between uterine implantation and gastrulation, methyl groups are added back to the genome. This resets the overall methylation pattern to one that is characteristic of most somatic cells (9.Kafri T. Ariel M. Brandeis M. Shemer R. Urven L. McCarrey J. Cedar H. Razin A. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 705-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 10.Jaenisch R. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 323-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Later in development, DNA demethylation mechanisms remove the methyl groups at specific loci, creating tissue-specific DNA methylation patterns which are proposed to affect gene expression (10.Jaenisch R. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 323-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 11.Eden S. Cedar H. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar).DNA methylation is thought to regulate gene expression by three possible mechanisms. The first is direct interference with the binding of transcription factors by alteration of C nucleotides in their recognition sequences (12.Bednarik D.P. Duckett C. Kim S.U. Perez V.L. Griffis K. Guenthner P.C. Folks T.M. New Biol. 1991; 3: 969-976PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Comb M. Goodman H.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3975-3982Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 14.Watt F. Molloy P.L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1136-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The second mechanism involves the binding of specific factors to methylated DNA which then block the binding of other factors required for gene induction (15.Kudo S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5492-5499Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 16.Boyes J. Bird A. Cell. 1991; 64: 1123-1134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 17.Antequera F. Macleod D. Bird A.P. Cell. 1989; 58: 509-517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The third mechanism proposes that DNA methylation indirectly regulates gene expression via alteration of chromatin structure (11.Eden S. Cedar H. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 18.Razin A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4905-4908Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Recent studies have indicated that the process of histone deacetylation may link the latter two mechanisms. Factors that specifically bind to methylated DNA have been reported to recruit histone deacetylases which act to close chromatin structure, rendering genes inaccessible to transcriptional machinery (19.Nan X. Ng H.-H. Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D. Turner B.M. Eisenman R.N. Bird A. Nature. 1998; 393: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar, 20.Jones P.L. Veenstra G.J.C. Wade P.A. Vermaak D. Kass S.U. Landsberger N. Strouboulis J. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar). Thus, the processes late in development that allow the appropriate cell type-specific demethylation of tissue specifically expressed gene loci are important for preventing these genes from being silenced by global repression mechanisms (18.Razin A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4905-4908Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar,21.Siegfried Z. Cedar H. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R305-R307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, only a small handful of tissue-specific demethylation phenomena have been studied (22.Paroush Z. Keshet I. Yisraeli J. Cedar H. Cell. 1990; 63: 1229-1237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 23.Lichtenstein M. Keini G. Cedar H. Bergman Y. Cell. 1994; 76: 913-923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Although this process is still poorly understood, evidence from these studies indicates that it may depend on the action of tissue-specific transcriptional control elements. We hypothesized that the action of the locus control region (LCR),1 which is thought to regulate chromatin structure (24.Grosveld F. van Assendelft G.B. Greaves D.R. Kollias G. Cell. 1987; 51: 975-985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1430) Google Scholar, 25.Fraser P. Grosveld F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 26.Kioussis D. Festenstein R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), may be involved in establishing tissue-specific DNA methylation patterns. An LCR forms a tissue-specific open chromatin domain for a linked gene regardless of its position in the genome. These LCR induced chromatin changes could aid in directing DNA methylation and demethylation enzyme complexes to specific locations at specific stages in development.We have studied the LCR for the T cell receptor (TCR) α/δ locus. This locus contains the multiple gene segments that are rearranged by the V-D-J recombinase complex to create functional TCRα and TCRδ genes and proteins. These proteins are subunits of the receptors that the αβ and γδ T-cells, respectively, use to recognize foreign antigens (27.Janeway C.A. Travers P. Immunobiology: The Immune System in Health and Disease. Current Biology Ltd./Garland Publishing Inc., London1994Google Scholar). The rearrangement and expression of these genes are limited to T cells, which reside mainly in lymphoid organs such as thymus and spleen. Just downstream of these genes is theDad1 gene, which in contrast to the TCR genes, is ubiquitously expressed (28.Hong N.A. Cado D. Mitchell J. Ortiz B.D. Hsieh S.N. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2151-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, strict regulation of the accessibility of this locus in chromatin must be maintained to achieve the differential expression of these juxtaposed genes. The TCRα LCR is located downstream of the TCRα gene and is 3 kilobases (kb) upstream of the Dad1 exons (Fig. 1 A). It contains nine DNase I-hypersensitive sites (HS) (29.Diaz P. Cado D. Winoto A. Immunity. 1994; 1: 207-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 30.Ortiz B.D. Cado D. Chen V. Diaz P.W. Winoto A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5037-5045Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). HS1 maps to the TCRα transcriptional enhancer (31.Winoto A. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). HS1′ (located less than 1 kb 3′ of HS1) is an important element involved in tissue-specific functions of the LCR (32.Ortiz B.D. Cado D. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1901-1909Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HS2–6 are downstream of HS1′ while HS7 and 8 lie 5′ of HS1. This LCR has been found to confer high-level, position-independent, copy number-dependent, and T-cell specific expression to linked transgenes in mice (29.Diaz P. Cado D. Winoto A. Immunity. 1994; 1: 207-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 30.Ortiz B.D. Cado D. Chen V. Diaz P.W. Winoto A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5037-5045Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Furthermore, functional subdomains of this LCR have been identified which control its tissue specificity and chromatin opening functions (30.Ortiz B.D. Cado D. Chen V. Diaz P.W. Winoto A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5037-5045Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The major tissue-specific functions of this LCR have been mapped to HS1 and HS1′ (32.Ortiz B.D. Cado D. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1901-1909Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).We have investigated the DNA methylation status of this LCR using a novel method for scanning large regions of DNA to directly detect methylated CpG dinucleotides. Here we report the identification of a lymphoid organ-specific demethylation event in a localized region of the TCRα LCR. Studies in structural gene knockout animals indicate that this demethylation mechanism operates independently of TCR cell surface expression or gene rearrangement. In contrast, germline deletion of the HS1/HS1′ region of the LCR disrupts this demethylation event which occurs at a site 3.8 kb downstream of HS1′. The HS1′ element of the LCR has previously been shown to have a chromatin based (i.e. non-classical enhancer) activity affecting the tissue distribution of transgene expression (32.Ortiz B.D. Cado D. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1901-1909Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments using transgenic mice containing various 5′ deletion mutants of an LCR reporter construct showed that HS1′ can act in the absence of HS1 to direct this novel demethylation mechanism. Thus, elements of an LCR can play a role in establishing tissue-specific DNA methylation patterns.RESULTSIn addition to the study of the endogenous TCRα LCR, we use a transgenic model for TCRα LCR activity which has been previously described (30.Ortiz B.D. Cado D. Chen V. Diaz P.W. Winoto A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5037-5045Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 32.Ortiz B.D. Cado D. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1901-1909Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this system, a human β-globin genomic fragment (24.Grosveld F. van Assendelft G.B. Greaves D.R. Kollias G. Cell. 1987; 51: 975-985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1430) Google Scholar, 36.Chada K. Magram J. Raphael K. Radice G. Lacy E. Costantini F.

EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1715-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 38.Greaves D.R. Wilson F.D. Lang G. Kioussis D. Cell. 1989; 56: 979-986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) is linked as a reporter gene to the full-length (all 9 HS) LCR to generate the β:1–8 transgene (Fig.1 B). This LCR dominates over the endogenous β-globin control elements resulting in position-independent, high-level T cell-specific expression of the β-globin gene (30.Ortiz B.D. Cado D. Chen V. Diaz P.W. Winoto A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5037-5045Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The chromatin structure of the LCR sequences in this transgene (as defined by the DNase I hypersensitivity assay (39.Wu C. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 269-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar)) is similar to that seen in the endogenous locus. Therefore this system is a good physiological model for LCR study. Three deletion mutants of this construct were previously described and are also used later in our study (32.Ortiz B.D. Cado D. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1901-1909Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Tissue Differential Methylation Patterns Exist in TCRα LCR DNAWe initially wanted to determine the general DNA methylation patterns over the length of this LCR in organs that differentially express the genes of the locus. The enzyme McrBC was used in a novel titration assay similar to the DNase I hypersensitivity assay (39.Wu C. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 269-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). McrBC is a methylation-dependent restriction enzyme that recognizes a pair of methylated cytosine residues in the sequence 5′-PumC (N40–2000) PumC-3′, and cleaves within 30 bp from one of the methylated residues. Titration of this enzyme onto genomic DNA allows the scanning of large regions of DNA without regard to the presence of particular restriction enzyme recognition sites. The relatively loose sequence specificity allows, in principle, the detection of up to 50% of the CpG dinucleotides occurring in a given DNA sequence. McrBC treatment of isolated genomic DNA generates different fragment sizes depending on the location of methylated residues in the LCR fragment. These cleavage products can be detected by indirect end labeling of a parent restriction fragment of interest by Southern blot. Their positions can also be mapped relative to the fragment end recognized by the labeled probe. We analyzed the TCRα LCR in both endogenous and β:1–8 transgene contexts. For our transgenic analysis, high-copy transgenic lines were used. Short exposure of Southern blots to film allows selective detection of the strong signals from transgene cleavage products when compared with the low signals from the endogenous locus. First, parent fragments were generated by restriction enzyme digestion of thymus and kidney genomic DNA from C57BL/6 wild-type mice and full-length LCR reporter construct (β:1–8) transgenic mice. Fig.2 A shows the analysis of the transgenic LCR sequences. As increasing amounts of McrBC were added, the parent fragments became less evident, and smaller fragments progressively appeared (marked A-F). The detected McrBC cleavage indicated a high degree of DNA methylation in the TCRα LCR sequences. The cleavage patterns were roughly similar from kidney and thymus (sites A-C and E-F). The only major difference was the stark appearance of a 1.5-kb fragment in the kidney sample (site D). This indicated an area of hypermethylated CpG dinucleotides in kidney DNA which mapped close to the region of HS4 (Fig. 2 B). This area appeared selectively unmethylated in thymus DNA. McrBC analysis of spleen and heart DNA from the same animals showed that the HS4 region was hypermethylated in heart DNA, but not in spleen DNA (data not shown). The results obtained from analysis of the endogenous TCRα LCR in the four organs were similar to those seen in the transgenic model (data not shown).Figure 2McrBC titration assay. Isolated genomic DNA was prepared from the indicated organs of a β:1–8 transgenic mouse (23 copies). A, Southern blot ofMfeI-digested genomic DNA, subsequently treated with McrBC enzyme.

We utilized restriction enzymes whose cleavage activities were differentially sensitive to DNA methylation. An HS4 region-specific probe was used to detect enzyme cleavage by Southern blot analysis. MspI andHpaII restriction enzymes recognize the same sequence 5′-CCGG-3′. MspI cuts DNA regardless of its methylation status, but HpaII only cuts the sequence if the internal cytosine residue is unmethylated. We also used HhaI, which recognizes the sequence 5′-GCGC-3′ and only cuts unmethylated DNA. C57BL/6 genomic DNA from thymus, spleen, kidney, and heart were digested with the MseI restriction enzyme to generate a 1.2-kb parent fragment spanning the HS4 region, and then further digested with MspI, HpaII, or HhaI to assess DNA methylation in the region (Fig.3 A). As expected, treatment with MspI resulted in cleavage of the parent fragment in DNA from all organs (Fig. 3 B, top). Treatment withHpaII or HhaI resulted in extensive parent band cleavage in thymus and spleen but not in kidney or heart. The signals present in the parent fragment and enzyme cleavage subfragments (in theHhaI cleavage samples) were quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. After subtracting the lane background signal, the percent demethylation (subfragment signal divided by the sum of the subfragment and parent signals) was calculated and graphed (Fig. 3 C). A high percentage indicates relative demethylation in the region, while a low percentage implies methylated DNA. Such PhosphorImager analysis of the C57BL/6 DNA Southern blot showed nearly 100% demethylation in the thymus and spleen and below 30% demethylation in kidney and heart. These same results were reproduced in β:1–8 transgenic genomic DNA subjected to the same restriction enzyme treatment (data not shown). Since HpaII and HhaI only cleave unmethylated DNA, this result confirmed that the HS4 region of the TCRα LCR was hypermethylated in non-lymphoid organs, and undermethylated in lymphoid organs.Figure 3Demethylation of the HS4 region is impaired by the Eα−/− mutation.

Bardon C.G. Ferrini R. Davidson L. Alt F.W. Immunity. 1997; 7: 505-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). To assess the DNA methylation status of this impaired TCRα locus, we obtained the TCRα enhancer knock-out mice and performed the restriction enzyme cleavage assay. Fig. 3 B(middle) shows that this mutation resulted in the disruption of the lymphoid organ-specific DNA demethylation mechanism operating on the HS4 region of the endogenous locus. This is evidenced by the persistence of some HS4 region parent fragment equivalently in all organs upon treatment with HpaII and significantly reduced parent fragment cleavage by HhaI. This indicates equivalent partial DNA methylation of this region in all organs rather than the clear tissue-specific patterns seen in the wild-type locus. PhosphorImager analysis confirmed this result (Fig. 3 C). These HS1/HS1′ knockout mice also have a defect in thymic development due to the absence of cell surface TCR (34.Mombaerts P. Clarke A.R. Rudnicki M.A. Iacomini J. Itohara S. Lafaille J.J. Wang L. Ichikawa Y. Jaenisch R. Hooper M.L. Tonegawa S. Nature. 1992; 360: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). To determine if the DNA demethylation defect was secondary to impaired thymic maturation, the TCRα constant region knock-out mice were also analyzed. These mice have the identical block in thymic development present in the regulatory region mutant, but have an intact HS1/HS1′ region. The lymphoid organ-specific DNA demethylation activity in these mice was similar to that of the wild type counterpart (Fig. 3, B, bottom, and C). This indicated that the mutation of the HS1/HS1′ region was indeed directly involved in the lymphoid organ-specific demethylation of HS4 DNA.HS4 Region Demethylation Is Local and Occurs Independently of VDJ RecombinationThe results from the above studies of mice with mutant TCRα loci raised the possibility that demethylation of the HS4 region DNA may precede the onset of VDJ recombination or gene expression. To confirm this, recombinase-activating geneRag1 deficient mice were analyzed to determine the requirement of VDJ recombination for the lymphoid organ-specific demethylation activity. The Rag1 gene product is required early in T cell development for TCR gene rearrangement. Thymocytes in these mutant mice are arrested at a very early stage of development (33.Mombaerts P. Iacomini J. Johnson R.S. Herrup K. Tonegawa S. Papaioannou V.E. Cell. 1992; 68: 869-877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2308) Google Scholar). Using the same methylation sensitive restriction enzymes used previously, we found that HS4 demethylation occurs normally in these mice (Fig. 3 C). PhosphorImager analysis of Southern blots (HhaI samples) of Rag1−/−, in comparison to those experiments shown in Fig. 3 B, confirmed thatRag1−/− and wild-type DNA are similar with respect to the methylation status of the HS4 region of the LCR. The only mutation that affects the wild-type DNA demethylation pattern is the Eα−/− deletion. This shows that unrearranged TCRα alleles can undergo demethylation in the lymphoid system. This also suggests that the demethylation mechanism acts early in thymocyte development prior to gene rearrangement.The results of the McrBC assay strongly suggested that the DNA demethylation event was strictly localized to the HS4 region of the LCR. To confirm this, we analyzed intervening regions of the LCR in wild-type and mutant mice, with MspI, HpaII, andHhaI enzymes (Fig. 4). We found that the HS2 region is heavily methylated in lymphoid organ DNA despite the demethylated state of the neighboring HS4 region. In non-lymphoid organs, HS2 region DNA appears to be partially methylated. In contrast to the strong effect of the Eα−/− mutation on the tissue-specific methylation status of HS4 region DNA, this mutation has only a very minor effect on the wild-type HS2 DNA methylation pattern in these organs (Fig. 4, B and C). DNA derived from lymphoid organs is still heavily methylated and non-lymphoid organ DNA remains partially methylated.Figure 4The tissue-specific methylation status of the HS2 region is not significantly altered by the Eα−/− mutation.

We employed our transgenic model to determine the contribution of each HS cluster to the control of HS4 region DNA demethylation in lymphoid organs (Fig.5 A). Genomic DNA from mice transgenic for the β:1–6, β:1′–6, and β:2–6 constructs were analyzed. As mentioned before, these constructs are the previously described deletion mutants of the parent β:1–8 transgene (Fig.1 A) (30.Ortiz B.D. Cado D. Chen V. Diaz P.W. Winoto A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5037-5045Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 32.Ortiz B.D. Cado D. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1901-1909Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once again, we used the methylation sensitive restriction enzymes to determine DNA methylation status of the transgenes. As shown in Fig. 5 B, the cleavage pattern of the β:1–6 and β:1′–6 transgenes were generally similar to those of the β:1–8 transgene (data not shown) and the endogenous LCR (Fig.3 B, top). These data show that HS7, HS8, and HS1 were not critical for lymphoid organ-specific HS4 demethylation. In contrast, analysis of β:2–6 transgenic mice showed that the HS4 region parent fragment of this construct was resistant to cleavage by HhaI and HpaII in all four organs analyzed. This indicated that the ability to demethylate this DNA segment in lymphoid organs is lost upon deletion of the HS1′ region. This result was confirmed in other independent lines transgenic for the β:1′–6 and β:2–6 constructs (data not shown). Therefore, the difference in DNA methylation status between these two transgenes is not due to the position of transgene integration. PhosphorImager analysis confirmed these results (Fig.5c).Figure 5HS4 region demethylation depends on the presence of the HS1′ region in a transgenic model system.

Pausing of DNA polymerases at hairpin or tetraplex structures of d(CGG)n was observed both in vitro(25.Kang S. Ohshima K. Shimizu M. Amirhaeri S. Wells R.D. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab DNA oligomers were purified by electrophoresis through a denaturing 8.0 m urea, 15% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 19:1) as we described previously (36.Fry M. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12797-12802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Purified single-stranded DNA oligomers were 5′-end-labeled with32P in a T4 polynucleotide kinase-catalyzed reaction (41.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 10.59Google Scholar). A 20-/46-mer partial DNA duplex was prepared by annealing terminally labeled 20-mer to unlabeled 46-mer as described (36.Fry M. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12797-12802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Double-stranded 32P-5′-labeled 3′,5′-tail d(CGG)7·3′,5′-tail d(CCG)7, or TeR3 anti-TeR3 were prepared by similarly annealing a mixture of 4 μmeach complementary oligomer. To form bimolecular quadruplex structures of 32P-5′-labeled d(CGG)7, 3′-tail d(CGG)7, 3′,5′-tail d(CGG)7, or mixtures thereof, solutions of 30–60 μm oligomers were incubated at 4 °C for 12–20 h in 10 μl of TE buffer (10 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) that contained 300 mm LiCl, KCl, or NaCl. Bimolecular tetraplex structures of 32P-5′-labeled TeR2 or 3′,5′-tail TeR2 were similarly prepared except that the oligomers were incubated at 37 °C for 12–20 h in a solution that contained 1 m KCl in TE buffer. To form tetramolecular quadruplex structures of oligomers Q or 5′-tail Q, a solution of 50–80 μm32P-5′-labeled oligomer in TE buffer, 300 mm NaCl was incubated at 50 °C for 12–20 h. Generated DNA tetraplexes and residual single strands were precipitated by ethanol and resuspended and stored at 4 °C in TE buffer that contained 100 mm of the respective salt. In some experiments the tetraplex DNA structures were enriched by gel purification as described (36.Fry M. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12797-12802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Enrichment of the tetraplexes did not affect their properties or the extent of their protein-mediated destabilization. Concentrations of labeled quadruplex structures of the various oligomers were assessed by measuring the specific radioactivity of source oligomers and determining the radioactivity of the formed tetraplexes. The circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of G′2 tetraplex 3′,5′-tail d(CGG)7 was recorded in a Jasco J-500C spectropolarimeter. Samples were prepared by heating at 95 °C for 5 min a solution of 1.25 μm 3′,5′-tail d(CGG)7 in TE buffer containing 500 mm KCl. Following incubation of the DNA solution at 4 °C for 48 h, its CD spectrum was recorded at 12–15 °C. Stored solutions of 32P-5′-labeled tetraplex or double-stranded DNA were diluted 100-fold in buffer D (25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol) that lacked or contained salt as specified under “Results.” The diluted DNA tetraplexes were added to DNA destabilization reaction mixtures that contained in a final volume of 10 μl of buffer D, with or without salt, 2 ng of end-labeled tetraplex or duplex DNA substrate and qTBP42 or uqTBP25. Following incubation at 37 °C for times specified under “Results,” the DNA destabilization reactions were terminated by rapid cooling of the samples and the addition of 10% SDS to a final concentration of 0.25%. Displaced DNA single strands were resolved from remaining tetraplex or double-stranded DNA by electrophoresis at 4 °C under 80–120 V through a nondenaturing 8–12% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE buffer (1.2 mm EDTA in 0.54 mTris borate buffer, pH 8.3) that contained 10 mm of a specified salt. The resolved DNA bands were visualized by exposing to autoradiographic film gels that were dried on Whatman 3 filter paper. Amounts of tetraplex or double-stranded DNA and of displaced single strands were quantified by exposing gels dried on Whatman DE81 filter paper to phosphorimager plate (Fuji). Trinucleotide repeat sequences d(CGG)n readily fold into hairpin structures (14.Gacy A.M. Goellner G. Juranic N. Macura S. McMurray C.T.

As shown in Fig.1 A, incubation of32P-5′-labeled d(CGG)7 or 3′-tail d(CGG)7 at 4 °C in the presence of 300 mmNaCl resulted in the generation of electrophoretically retarded forms specific for each oligomer. Similar incubation of an equimolar mixture of the two oligomers yielded the two slowly migrating forms of each oligomer and a third hybrid species with intermediate slowed mobility. All the retarded DNA structures were accumulated with a second order kinetics, indicating their multimolecular nature (data not shown). The formation of three electrophoretically retarded bands in a mixture of d(CGG)7 and 3′-tail d(CGG)7 indicated a bimolecular stoichiometry of the complexes (36.Fry M. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12797-12802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). That these bimolecular structures represented antiparallel tetraplex structures was confirmed by their characteristic CD spectrum. An electrophoretically retarded form of 3′,5′-tail d(CGG)7 that was generated in the presence of 500 mm KCl, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” displayed a strong CD-positive peak at 290–295 nm and a negative peak at 260 nm. The presence of the CD-positive signal at ∼290 nm indicated that the slowly migrating form of 3′,5′-tail d(CGG)7 represented a folded, antiparallel dimeric hairpin G′2 tetraplex structure (43.Shafer R.H. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 59: 55-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The tetrahelical nature of similarly generated forms of d(CGG)n oligomers was also previously demonstrated by their stabilization through guanine·guanine non-Watson-Crick hydrogen bonds and the requirement for alkali ions for their formation and stability (20.Fry M. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4950-5954Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 36.Fry M. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12797-12802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Generation of similar G′2 bimolecular tetraplex complexes was observed when mixtures of d(CGG)7 and 3′-tail d(CGG)7 were incubated in the presence of 300–500 mm LiCl or KCl (data not shown). Schematic representation of the G′2 bimolecular tetraplex structures of d(CGG)7 or 3′-tail d(CGG)7 and of their hybrid is shown in Fig. 1 B. To study the interaction of qTBP42 or uqTBP25 with G′2 tetraplex forms of d(CGG) trinucleotide repeat sequences, we first assessed the inherent stability of these DNA structures. Although Li+, K+, and Na+ ions all enabled the formation of G′2 (CGG)n(Ref. 20.Fry M. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4950-5954Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar and results not shown), data summarized in Fig. 1,C and D, indicated that G′2 3′-tail d(CGG)7 that was generated and heated in the presence of different ions had different stability. As shown in Fig. 1 C, G′2 3′-tail d(CGG)7 that was generated in the presence of 300 mm LiCl, KCl, or NaCl and was subsequently heated in 50 mm of the respective salt had T m values of 42, 48.5, or 52.5 °C, respectively. By raising the concentration of LiCl from 0 to 100 mm the melting temperature of G′2 3′-tail d(CGG)7 increased only slightly from 40.3 to 42 °C, respectively (Fig. 1 D). Increasing concentrations of K+ contributed more significantly to the stability of the tetraplex structure, elevating its T m values from 41.3 to 46 °C at 0–100 mm KCl, respectively. Sodium ions conferred on G′2 3′-tail d(CGG)7 the highest heat stability as demonstrated by its increased T mvalues of 42–54.3 °C at 0–100 mm NaCl, respectively (Fig. 1 D). The hnRNP-related proteins qTBP42 and uqTBP25 tightly bind and stabilize single-stranded and tetraplex telomeric sequences (37.Sarig G. Weisman-Shomer P. Erlitzki R. Fry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4474-4482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 39.Erlitzki R. Fry M. J. Biol.

However, a survey of the interaction of qTBP42 and uqTBP25 with tetraplex structures of different DNA sequences revealed that neither protein detectably bound d(CGG)n tetrahelices. Moreover, in clear contrast to their stabilizing effect on tetraplex telomeric DNA, both proteins destabilized bimolecular tetraplex structures of d(CGG)n. As seen in Fig. 2,A and B, neither qTBP42 nor uqTBP25 formed detectable complexes with either G′2 d(CGG)7 or G′2 3′-tail d(CGG)7. By contrast, both proteins formed under the same conditions complexes with single-stranded and tetraplex G′2 3′,5′ TeR2 DNA (Fig. 2 C). Incubation of G′2 forms of d(CGG)7 or 3′"

The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein mediates the early binding and entry steps in viral infection.

Biol. 1998; 5: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 27.Hughson F.M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R565-R569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). According to this theory, the helical-bundle molecule, a protein, is required to break the energy barrier for fusion of two membranes, which is energetically unfavorable. This model implies that the helical structure interacts with lipid membranes. This notion is supported by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopic experiments that indicate that the coiled-coil region adjacent to the fusion peptide region of HA interacts with lipid bilayers only in the fusion-active state (28.Yu Y.G. King D.S. Shin Y.-K. Science. 1994; 266: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Again, using electron paramagnetic resonance, a peptide corresponding to the N-terminal heptad-repeat region within the gp41 ectodomain of HIV-1 shows membrane binding (29.Rabenstein M. Shin Y.K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13390-13397Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These lipid-binding phenomena are postulated to facilitate membrane fusion (28.Yu Y.G. King D.S. Shin Y.-K. Science. 1994; 266: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The surface of the gp41 core is highly grooved and possesses distinct hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions, features that may be essential for the binding of lipid membranes. Here we show that the N34(L6)C28 model of the gp41 core is stabilized by interaction with the anionic detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) or the nonionic detergentn-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (βOG). The x-ray structures of N34(L6)C28 crystals grown from these detergent micellar media at resolutions of 2.7 (SDS) and 1.45 Å (βOG) reveal a six-helix bundle conformation that is very similar to that of the molecule in water. Moreover, N34(L6)C28 folds into a fully helical conformation in lipid vesicles. Our results suggest that the six-helix bundle structure can interact with lipid bilayers. This membrane binding may play a role in facilitating both the gp41 conformational change during fusion activation and local apposition of the viral and cellular membranes for fusion. The recombinant N34(L6)C28 model was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)/pLysS using the T7 expression system (30.Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5998) Google Scholar) and purified to homogeneity by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as described previously (17.Lu M. Kim P.S. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1997; 15: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Protein identity was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Protein concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm in 6m guanidinium hydrochloride, with an extinction coefficient calculated based on tryptophan and tyrosine (31.Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2999) Google Scholar). CD spectra were acquired in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 150 mmsodium chloride (PBS) with an Aviv 62 DS spectrometer as described previously (32.Shu W. Ji H. Lu M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5378-5385Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The same buffer was also used to prepare micellar solutions of βOG and SDS. The wavelength dependence of molar ellipticity, [θ], was monitored at 20 °C as the average of five scans, using a five-second integration time at 1.0-nm wavelength increments. Spectra were baseline-corrected against the cuvette with buffer alone. Helix content was estimated from the CD signal by dividing the mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm by the value expected for 100% helix formation by helices of comparable size, −33,000 degrees cm2 dmol−1 (33.Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Chau K.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1958) Google Scholar). Thermal stability was determined by monitoring the change in CD signal at 222 nm as a function of temperature, and thermal melts were performed in 2-degree intervals with a 2-min equilibration at the desired temperature and an integration time of 30 s. The thermal melts were not reversible, and the protein precipitated after thermal denaturation. The midpoint of the thermal unfolding transition (apparent melting temperature,T m) was determined from the maximum of the first derivative, with respect to the reciprocal of the temperature, of the [θ]222 values (34.Cantor C. Schimmel P. Biophysical Chemistry, Part III. W. H. Freeman Co., New York1980: 1131-1132Google Scholar). The error in estimation ofT m is ± 1 °C. Sedimentation equilibrium analysis was performed on a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge as described previously (32.Shu W. Ji H. Lu M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5378-5385Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Protein solutions were dialyzed overnight against PBS containing SDS or βOG, loaded at initial concentrations of 10, 40, and 150 μm, and analyzed at rotor speeds of 22 and 25 krpm at 20 °C. Data sets were fitted to a single-species model. Protein partial specific volume and solvent density were calculated with constants from Laue et al. (35.Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, United Kingdom1992: 90-125Google Scholar). Molecular weights were all within 10% of those calculated for an ideal trimer, with no systematic deviation of the residuals. Small unilamellar vesicles of dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol (DMPG) (Sigma) and 1-palmitoyl, 1,2-oleyl phosphatidylcholine (POPE) (Avanti Polar Lipids, Birmingham, AL) were prepared by nitrogen stream evaporation of a 5 mg/ml chloroform solution of the lipid followed by redispersion in PBS (pH 7.0) and sonication in a bath sonicator at 4 °C for 45 min. N34(L6)C28 was crystallized at room temperature by vapor diffusion. A stock of HPLC-purified N34(L6)C28 was dissolved in water, and its final protein concentration was adjusted to 10 mg/ml. Initial crystallization conditions were found by using the hanging-droplet method with sparse matrix crystallization kits (Crystal Screen I and II, Hampton Research, Riverside, CA) and then optimized. Centered cubic crystals with the symmetry of space group I213 were obtained from 0.1m sodium HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.8 m potassium sodium tartrate, and 10 mm SDS. Data to 2.7 Å resolution on the cubic crystals were collected at room temperature at the X-ray Crystallography Facility at the Weill Medical College of Cornell University using an R-axis IV image plate detector mounted on a Rigaku RU200 rotating anode x-ray generator. Primitive rhombohedral crystals with the symmetry of space group R3 were obtained from 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.6, 1.0 mammonium dihydrogen phosphate, and 35 mm βOG. The crystals were transferred to a cryoprotectant solution containing 25% (v/v) glycerol in the corresponding mother liquor. Cryoprotected crystals were frozen in propane before data collection. Data to 1.45 Å resolution were collected at 95 K using a Mar research 300 image plate scanner at the X12B beamline of the National Synchrotron Light Source. All diffraction intensities were integrated and scaled with the HKL suite (36.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38445) Google Scholar). The structures of N34(L6)C28 crystallized in the presence of detergent were determined by molecular replacement by using the program AMoRe (37.Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar). The 2.4 Å structure of N34(L6)C28 (Protein Data Bank code 1STZ) was used in a combined rotation-translation search (using 8.0–3.5 Å data) to yield a solution for N34(L6)C28/SDS (correlation coefficient, 60.9%;R-factor, 45.1%). Density interpretation and model building were done with the program O (38.Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar). Crystallographic refinement of the structure was done with the program X-PLOR (39.Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). Prior to refinement, 5% of the diffraction data were set aside for cross-validation (freeR-factor calculation). Noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were not used in the final refinement. Despite the relatively high mean B-factor 42 Å2, the model is generally well defined in the electron density (see Fig.5 A). The final refined model (R cryst= 18.3%; R free = 31.5%) includes 162 of 204 residues in the N34(L6)C28 trimer. No ordered density was observed for SDS. The following regions do not have clear electron density and are presumed to be disordered: residues 546–550 and 653–655 of gp41 and the linker region. All φ and ψ angles are in allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. Cross-rotation and cross-translation functions (using 10.0–3.0 Å data) by using the 2.4 Å structure of N34(L6)C28 as a search model yielded a solution for N34(L6)C28/βOG (correlation coefficient, 58.2%; R-factor, 43.8%). The model was subjected to rigid body refinement (8.0–2.5 Å) of the whole molecule by using the program X-PLOR (39.Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). This procedure was followed by least squares minimization of the atomic positions with the program O (38.Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar). The resulting map was subjected to rounds of automatic tracing and model building by using the program Arp-Warp 5.0 (40.Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1993; 49: 129-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the program REFMAC from the CCP4 program suite (41.CCP4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19730) Google Scholar). The refinement was monitored by using the free R-factor. At this stage, the model yielded higher quality of the 2F o − F c andF o − F c electron density maps compared with the starting maps. Noncrystallograhic symmetry restraints were not used in the refinement. Crystallographic refinement of the structure was done with the program X-PLOR (39.Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). The final refined model (R cryst = 20.0%;R free = 24.5%) contains residues 548–578 and 628–651 of gp41, Gly-5 and Gly-6 of the linker, and 90 water molecules. No ordered density was observed for βOG. Residues 546, 547, 579, and 652–655 of gp41 and Ser-1, Gly-2, Gly-3, and Arg-4 of the linker are not seen in the electron density, and the side chains of Gln-550 and Glu-647, as well as Met-629, are disordered and were thus modeled as serine and alanine, respectively. All φ and ψ angles are within allowed regions. The atomic coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (codes 1DF4 and 1DF5). We have previously shown that the recombinant N34(L6)C28 model of the HIV-1 gp41 core forms a six-helix-bundle structure in solution and in crystals and shows a cooperative thermal unfolding transition (18.Lu M. Ji H. Shen S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4433-4438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Tan K. Liu J. Wang J. Shen S. Lu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12303-12308Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). To analyze the conformation of N34(L6)C28 in the hydrophobic environment of the lipid bilayer, we first characterized the physicochemical properties of N34(L6)C28 in the presence of the ionic detergent SDS. SDS micellar system (the critical micellar concentration is 8.2 mm) has been widely used to study peptide-lipid and protein-lipid interactions (42.van de Ven F.J.M. van Os J.W. Wymenga S.S.

On the basis of CD measurements at a 10 μm protein concentration in PBS at 20 °C in the presence of 2 and 10 mm SDS, N34(L6)C28 displays a ∼75% α-helical structure, with characteristic double minima in CD spectra at 222 and 208 nm (Fig. 2 A). Under these conditions, N34(L6)C28 exhibits a cooperative melt with an apparent melting temperature (T m) of 88 °C in 2 mm SDS, in contrast to that of 70 °C in aqueous buffer (Fig. 2 B; Table I). Remarkably, N34(L6)C28 has a thermal stability that exceeds 100 °C in 10 mm SDS micelles (Fig. 2 B). Because N34(L6)C28 denatures irreversibly with temperature in all cases,T m values measured by CD spectroscopy are useful as only a qualitative guide to stability. Moreover, sedimentation equilibrium measurements indicate that N34(L6)C28 sediments as a clean trimer in 10 mm SDS micelles (Fig. 2 C; TableI).Table ISummary of circular dichroism and sedimentation equilibrium data for N34(L6)C28 in aqueous and membrane-mimetic mediaMediumConcentration−[θ]222aAll scans and melts were performed at a 10 μm protein concentration.TmaAll scans and melts were performed at a 10 μm protein concentration.Molecular massmmdeg cm 2 dmol −1°CkDaPBS29,6007024.4SDS223,4008826.5SDS1022,800>10025.9βOG3528,600>10023.6DMPG433,800POPE439,100a All scans and melts were performed at a 10 μm protein concentration. Open table in a new tab Taken together, these results indicate that N34(L6)C28 can form a highly stable six-helix bundle in SDS micelles. The lower helicity of N34(L6)C28 in the presence of SDS compared with PBS may be due to the partially unfolded region in the molecule (see below). It is extremely unusual for a small protein motif, in SDS solution that is in excess of its critical micellar concentration, to fold into a stable structure that is similar to that found under native conditions. By extension, the six-helix bundle of the gp41 core likely interacts preferentially with SDS micelles. To determine the general feature of the gp41 core-detergent interaction, we analyzed the conformation of N34(L6)C28 in βOG micelles. βOG is a nonionic detergent with a critical micellar concentration of 25.3 mm. In PBS at a 10 μmprotein concentration in the presence of 35 mm βOG, CD experiments indicate that the folded N34(L6)C28 molecule appears to be ∼90% helical at 20 °C and ∼45% helical at 90 °C (Fig.3 A; Table I). In addition, sedimentation equilibrium experiments indicate that N34(L6)C28 is trimeric in 35 mm βOG micelles (Fig. 3 B; TableI). Thus, N34(L6)C28 folds into a stable six-helix bundle structure in βOG micelles. These results strongly suggest that the fusion-active gp41 core displays substantial affinity for detergents. To further investigate the gp41 core-membrane interaction, we examined the conformation of N34(L6)C28 in DMPG and POPE bilayer vesicles, systems that imitate more closely the structural features of physiologically relevant bilayer membranes (e.g. 49, 50). CD measurements at 10 μm protein and 4 mm lipid concentrations in PBS (pH 7.0) at 20 °C indicate that N34(L6)C28 folds into α-helical structures in both DMPG and POPE vesicles (Fig.4). Because up to 2-fold reductions in ellipticity have been observed in the spectra of membrane-bound proteins (51.Glaeser R.M. Jap B.K. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6398-6401Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 52.Mao D. Wallace B.A. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 142: 317-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), it is striking that N34(L6)C28 appears to be more helical in lipid environments than that in aqueous solution; the ellipticities of N34(L6)C28 at 222 nm are 30,000, 34,000, and 39,000 degrees cm2/dmol in water, DMPG, and POPE, respectively (Fig. 4). In the light of recent evidence that helix formation for amino acids in lipid micelles/vesicles is qualitatively different from that in water and that hydrophobic interactions between the side chain and lipid govern helix formation in membranes (47.Li S.C. Deber C.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), the hydrophobic residues on the surface of the six-helix bundle appear to contribute to the net extent of helix formation in lipid environments. In addition, the CD spectra of N34(L6)C28 obtained in the DMPG and POPE vesicles differ slightly from that in aqueous solution, probably due to the stronger light-scattering effect of the phospholipid samples, which produce higher noise levels during CD measurements. To evaluate the high resolution structural features of the gp41 core in detergent micelles, we determined the x-ray structure of a new centered cubic crystal form of N34(L6)C28 grown in the presence of 10 mm SDS at 2.7 Å resolution (see under “Experimental Procedures”). This crystal structure, designated N34(L6)C28/SDS, was refined to a conventional R-factor of 18.3% with a freeR-factor of 31.5% and root mean square deviations from ideal bond lengths and bond angles of 0.004 Å and 0.763°, respectively (Table II). Moreover, we determined the 1.45 Å resolution x-ray structure of primitive rhombohedral crystals of N34(L6)C28 grown in 35 mm βOG micelles (see under “Experimental Procedures”). The rhombohedral crystals are isomorphous with those crystallized from aqueous solution. The N34(L6)C28/βOG structure was refined to a conventionalR-factor of 20.0% with a free R-factor of 24.5% and root mean square deviations from ideal bond lengths and bond angles of 0.017 Å and 2.0°, respectively (Table II).

https://openalex.org/W2077142000,"Based on the following observations we propose that the cytoplasmic loop between trans-membrane segments M6 and M7 (L6/7) of the α subunit of Na+,K+-ATPase acts as an entrance port for Na+ and K+ ions. 1) In defined conditions chymotrypsin specifically cleaves L6/7 in the M5/M6 fragment of 19-kDa membranes, produced by extensive proteolysis of Na+,K+-ATPase, and in parallel inactivates Rb+ occlusion. 2) Dissociation of the M5/M6 fragment from 19-kDa membranes is prevented either by occluded cations or by competitive antagonists such as Ca2+, Mg2+, La3+, p-xylylene bisguanidinium and m-xylylene bisguanidinium, or 1-bromo-2,4,6-tris(methylisothiouronium)benzene and 1,3-dibromo-2,4,6-tris (methylisothiouronium)benzene (Br2-TITU3+). 3) Ca2+ ions raise electrophoretic mobility of the M5/M6 fragment but not that of the other fragments of the α subunit. It appears that negatively charged residues in L6/7 recognize either Na+ or K+ions or the competitive cation antagonists. Na+ and K+ ions are then occluded within trans-membrane segments and can be transported, whereas the cation antagonists are not occluded and block transport at the entrance port.

The most detailed structures available are those of Ca2+-ATPase and H+-ATPase at 8-Å resolution, based on cryoelectron microscopy of two-dimensional crystals. These studies reveal the overall shape of these proteins and presence of 10 trans-membrane α-helical rods most of which are tilted at an angle to the membrane (1.Zhang P. Toyashima C. Yonekura K.

Thus, the trans-membrane helices are packed so as to create the cation occlusion “cage.”A biochemical approach for study of cation sites and the organization of trans-membrane segments utilizes renal Na+,K+-ATPase extensively digested with trypsin in the presence of Rb+ ions (and absence of Ca2+ ions) (5.Karlish S.J.D.

Chem. 1992; 267: 1150-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The digestion produces a preparation, referred to as 19-kDa membranes, that consists of well defined fragments of the α subunit, containing trans-membrane segments M7–M10 (apparent molecular mass ≈19 kDa) and the pairs M1/M2, M3/M4, and M5/M6 (apparent molecular mass 8–11.7 kDa), the β subunit partially split into a 16-kDa N-terminal and ≈50-kDa C-terminal fragments, and intact γ subunit. Cation occlusion and ouabain binding are fully maintained, but ATP binding is destroyed (5.Karlish S.J.D. Goldshleger R. Stein W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4566-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 6.Capasso J.M. Hoving S. Tal D.M. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol.

These features indicate that cation occlusion sites are located within trans-membrane segments and communicate with ATP sites in the large cytoplasmic loop via the stalks of the membrane-embedded fragments. An advantage of 19-kDa membranes is their simplicity, and they have now been exploited in several ways. For example, strong protection by Rb+ ions against further tryptic digestion of the 19-kDa and other fragments suggests that all fragments interact as a complex in which several trans-membrane segments cooperate to occlude the cations (12.Shainskaya A. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10780-10789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently we have obtained direct evidence for the complex of fragments, containing occluded Rb+ ions and bound ouabain, by solubilizing 19-kDa membranes with the non-ionic detergent C12E10 (13.Or E. Goldshleger R. Tal D.M. Karlish S.J.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6853-6864Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Both the membrane-bound and detergent-solubilized complex of fragments have now also been used for covalent cross-linking, in order to define proximities of fragments and trans-membrane segments, leading to an approximate model of the helix packing arrangement (4.Or E. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2802-2809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 14.Or E. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8197-8207Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).When 19-kDa membranes are incubated at 37 °C, their capacity to occlude Rb+ ions or bind ouabain is rapidly lost (15.Or E.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7311-7319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The presence of occluded cations or ouabain protects strongly against this thermal inactivation of Rb+ occlusion. Thermal inactivation has now been analyzed in detail and shown to be caused by disorganization of the interacting fragments (16.Shainskaya A. Nesaty V. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7311-7319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Following thermal disorganization the fragments become accessible to proteases in the medium and are digested to the limit membrane-embedded peptides (5.Karlish S.J.D. Goldshleger R. Stein W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4566-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar,12.Shainskaya A. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol.

A. 1995; 92: 7936-7940Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) reported the striking observation that incubation of 19-kDa membranes at 37 °C causes release into the medium of the fragment containing M5 and M6 (“the M5/M6 fragment”), associated with partial inactivation of Rb+ occlusion. The presence of Rb+ ions or ouabain protected against release of the fragment. The finding implies an important role for the M5/M6 fragment in occlusion of cations and also that it is stabilized by interactions with other fragments, such as the M7/M10 fragment as suggested by chemical labeling experiments (17.Lutsenko S. Anderko R. Kaplan J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7936-7940Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 18.Lutsenko S. Daoud S. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5249-5255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). More recently, using an antibody raised against the peptide Leu815-Gln828 within the M5/M6 fragment, we have found that only about 50% of the fragment is released and dissociation of the fragment follows inactivation of Rb+occlusion which is complete (16.Shainskaya A. Nesaty V. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7311-7319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The conclusion is that dissociation of the M5/M6 fragment is a consequence of thermal disorganization of the complex of fragments which is the direct cause of inactivation of Rb+ occlusion. Both the indirect and now direct cross-linking evidence (14.Or E. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8197-8207Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) demonstrate interactions between the M5/M6 and M7/M10 fragments in native 19-kDa membranes and their disruption upon thermal inactivation of occlusion. Thus, whereas the importance of the M5 and M6 trans-membrane segments in cation occlusion and transport is clear, the mechanism of the process is still unknown.The β subunit is an important component of both Na+,K+-ATPase and H+,K+-ATPase. The β subunit stabilizes the α subunit and is required for functional expression of the pump at the plasma membrane (19.Geering K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 20.Chow D.-C. Forte J.D. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The β subunit interacts with the α subunit strongly in the extracellular loop L7/8 particularly in the sequence SYGQ (21.Fambrough D.M. Lemas M.V. Kamrick M. Emerick M. Renaud K.J. Inman E.M.

Two points of interaction on the ectodomain of β subunit have now been identified, before the first S–S bridge and between the second and third S–S bridges, respectively (23.Bar Shimon M.

Functional interactions occur particularly via the extracellular subunit interaction in L7/8, whereas functional cytoplasmic α-β interactions remain to be established. An additional use of 19-kDa membranes has been for chymotryptic digestion of the β subunit. Incubation of 19-kDa membranes with α-chymotrypsin at 37 °C in a Rb+-containing medium leads to selective truncation of the N-terminal 16-kDa fragment of the β subunit and eventually to inactivation of Rb+ occlusion (27.Shainskaya A. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10309-10316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Selective cleavage occurs in two steps, first truncation of the 16-kDa fragment (N terminus Ala5) to a 15-kDa fragment (N terminus Ile15) followed by further digestion to a 14-kDa fragment (N terminus Leu24). After the second truncation the Rb+ occlusion becomes thermally inactivated, and finally, all the fragments are digested to the limit membrane-embedded peptides. The experiments indicate that the cytoplasmic domain of the β subunit affects access of Rb+ ions to the occlusion sites, presumably via an interaction with the α subunit, although the nature of that interaction remains unknown.In a quite different approach for studying cations sites, we have developed high affinity organic analogues of alkali metal cations, with the object of producing reactive derivatives for labeling and mapping the sites. This led us to synthesize and characterize aryl bis-guanidinium derivatives (mXBG2+1 and pXBG2+) (33.David P. Mayan H. Cohen H. Tal D.M. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1141-1149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and more recently tris-isothiouronium derivatives (Br-TITU3+ and Br2-TITU3+) (34.Hoving S. Bar-Shimon M. Tijmes J.J. Goldshleger R. Tal D.M. Karlish S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29788-29793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). mXBG2+, pXBG2+, Br-TITU3+, and Br2-TITU3+ competitively inhibit Na+ or Rb+ occlusion, stabilize theE 1 conformation of the enzyme, and block Na+,K+-ATPase activity. Thus they are competitive Na+-like antagonists. They compete with either Na+ or K+ ions for transport sites at the cytoplasmic surface (35.Or E. Goldshleger G. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2470-2477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The intrinsic dissociation constantK D for pXBG2+ or mXBG2+ is 5–10 μm, whereas K D values of Br-TITU3+ and Br2-TITU3+ are much lower, about 0.5 and 0.2 μm, respectively. A detailed functional analysis indicates that, unlike Na+ and K+ ions, the competitive Na+-like antagonists are not occluded. The findings led to a model for cation occlusion with two steps, an initial recognition site which is common for both transported cations and their antagonists, followed by occlusion only of transported cations (15.Or E. David P. Shainskaya A. Tal D.M. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16929-16937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus the antagonists block cation transport and Na+,K+-ATPase activity at the entry port for the cations. Despite the utility of these antagonists for dissecting stages of cation transport, suitable reactive derivatives have not yet been made, and thus the site of interaction with the protein has not been identified.This paper brings together a number of novel observations based on the two biochemical approaches described above. The conclusion is that the cytoplasmic loop between M6 and M7 of the α subunit serves as the entrance port to cation occlusion sites and point of interaction of both transported cations and the competitive Na+-like antagonists. Furthermore, the N-terminal domain of the β subunit participates or is in close proximity with the entrance to the cation sites.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESNa+/K+-ATPase was prepared from fresh pig kidney red outer medulla by the rapid procedure described by Jørgensen (36.Jørgensen P.L.

Before use, the enzyme was dialyzed at 4 °C against 1000 volumes of a solution containing 25 mm histidine, pH 7.0, and 1 mm EDTA (Tris).

This produces the preparation known as chymotryptic intermediate (see text). Other conditions for chymotryptic digestion are given in legends to figures. After digestion, 0.2 mm TPCK, 1 mm PMSF, and 150 mm KCl were added sequentially, and the membranes were incubated at room temperature for 10 min upon each addition. The membranes were diluted 15-fold with a solution of the standard medium containing also 150 mm KCl, 1 mm PMSF, 0.2 mm TPCK, centrifuged at 250,000 × g for 1 h, and the pellet was resuspended in standard medium and incubated again with TPCK and PMSF for 10 min at room temperature. The suspension was centrifuged again and then washed and suspended in standard medium. These procedures completely inactivate chymotrypsin and remove traces of chymotrypsin adsorbed to the membranes.Thermal Inactivation of 19-kDa Membranes (See Ref.16.Shainskaya A. Nesaty V.

https://openalex.org/W2069730836,"Activation of α1-adrenergic receptors influences both the contractile activity and the growth potential of cardiac myocytes. However, the signaling pathways linking activation of specific α1-adrenergic receptor (AR) subtypes to these physiological responses remain controversial. In the present study, a molecular approach was used to identify conclusively the signaling pathways activated in response to the individual α1A- and α1B-AR subtypes in cardiac myocytes. For this purpose, a mutant α1a-AR subtype (α1a-S290/293-AR) was constructed based on analogy to the previously described constitutively active mutant α1b-AR subtype (α1b-S288–294-AR). The mutant α1a-S290/293-AR subtype displayed constitutive activity based on four criteria. To introduce the constitutively active α1-AR subtypes into cardiac myocytes, recombinant Sindbis viruses encoding either the α1a-S290/293-AR or α1b-S288–294-AR subtype were used to infect the whole cell population with >90% efficiency, thereby allowing the biochemical activities of the various signaling pathways to be measured. When expressed at comparable levels, the α1a-S290/293-AR subtype exhibited a significantly elevated basal level as well as agonist-stimulated level of inositol phosphate accumulation, coincident with activation of atrial natriuretic factor-luciferase gene expression. By contrast, the α1b-S288–294-AR subtype displayed a markedly increased serum response element-luciferase gene expression but no activation of atrial natriuretic factor-luciferase gene expression. Taken together, this study provides the first molecular evidence for coupling of the α1a-AR and the α1b-AR subtypes to different signaling pathways in cardiac myocytes. Activation of α1-adrenergic receptors influences both the contractile activity and the growth potential of cardiac myocytes. However, the signaling pathways linking activation of specific α1-adrenergic receptor (AR) subtypes to these physiological responses remain controversial. In the present study, a molecular approach was used to identify conclusively the signaling pathways activated in response to the individual α1A- and α1B-AR subtypes in cardiac myocytes. For this purpose, a mutant α1a-AR subtype (α1a-S290/293-AR) was constructed based on analogy to the previously described constitutively active mutant α1b-AR subtype (α1b-S288–294-AR). The mutant α1a-S290/293-AR subtype displayed constitutive activity based on four criteria. To introduce the constitutively active α1-AR subtypes into cardiac myocytes, recombinant Sindbis viruses encoding either the α1a-S290/293-AR or α1b-S288–294-AR subtype were used to infect the whole cell population with >90% efficiency, thereby allowing the biochemical activities of the various signaling pathways to be measured. When expressed at comparable levels, the α1a-S290/293-AR subtype exhibited a significantly elevated basal level as well as agonist-stimulated level of inositol phosphate accumulation, coincident with activation of atrial natriuretic factor-luciferase gene expression. By contrast, the α1b-S288–294-AR subtype displayed a markedly increased serum response element-luciferase gene expression but no activation of atrial natriuretic factor-luciferase gene expression.

However, despite intense investigation, the signaling pathways linking activation of specific α1-AR subtypes to these particular physiological responses remain controversial (1.Post G.R. Brown J.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The situation is complicated by the diversity of α1-AR subtypes. Three distinct α1-AR subtypes have been identified by molecular cloning (2.Schwinn D.A. Lomasney J.W. Lorenz W. Szklut P.J. Fremeau R.T. Yang-Feng T.L. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8183-8189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Cotecchia S. Schwinn D.A. Randall R.R. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Kobilka B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7159-7163Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 4.Perez D.M. Piascik M.T. Graham R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 876-883PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the relationships between the cloned and native α1-AR subtypes have been established by comparison of their affinity constants for a wide variety of α1-AR subtype-selective antagonists (5.Laz T.M. Forray C. Smith K.E. Bard J.A. Vaysse P.J. Branchek T.A. Weinshank R.L Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 414-422PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Michel M.C. Insel P.A. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1994; 350: 136-142PubMed Google Scholar). From this comparison, it has been suggested that the cloned α1b-AR represents the native α1B-AR subtype; the cloned α1a/c-AR 2Nomenclature used for the α1-ARs is that recommended by the International Union of Pharmacology (Hieble, J. P., Bylund, D. B., Clarke, D. E., Eikenburg, D. C., Langer, S. Z., Lefkowitz, R. J., Minneman, K. P., and Ruffolo, R. R. (1995) Pharmacol. Rev. 47, 267–270) where native α1-AR subtypes are denoted by uppercase subscripts (e.g. α1A) and cloned α1-AR subtypes are denoted by lowercase subscripts (e.g. α1a). Also, in accordance with these recommendations, the recombinant α1c-AR subtype is renamed α1a-AR subtype, which is believed to represent the native α1A-AR subtype. corresponds to the native α1A-AR subtype; and the cloned α1d-AR is considered to represent a novel α1D-AR subtype. With the recognition that multiple α1-AR subtypes exist, the roles of the individual α1-AR subtypes in mediating specific physiological effects need to be investigated further. The assignment of particular physiological responses and signaling pathways first requires the elucidation of the specific α1-ARs subtypes present in cardiac myocytes. In a previous study, we showed that all three α1-AR subtypes are expressed at the mRNA level, but only the α1A- and α1B-AR subtypes are detectable at the protein level in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes (7.Wenham D. Rahmatullah R.J. Rahmatullah M. Hansen C.A. Robishaw J.D. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 339: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Based on a wide range of subtype-selective receptor antagonists, this study suggested that the α1A-AR subtype appeared to be largely responsible for the stimulation of the phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis pathway in response to agonist treatment of these cells, whereas activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway appeared to occur through a subtype whose pharmacological profile most closely resembled that of the α1B-AR subtype. Although intriguing, the limited selectivities of the currently available α1-AR antagonists do not allow the definitive assignments of functional responses and signaling pathways to be made. Thus, for a given α1-AR antagonist, the binding constants for inhibition of signaling responses show a range of differences among published reports that is almost as great as the range of putative differences among the cloned α1-AR subtypes (8.Hieble J.P. Bylund D.B. Clarke D.E. Eikenburg D.C. Langer S.Z. Lefkowitz R.J. Minneman K.P. Ruffolo R.R. Pharmacol. Rev. 1995; 47: 267-270PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to circumvent the limitations of a pharmacologic approach, we sought to develop a molecular approach that could be used to identify conclusively which signaling pathways, and ultimately which functional responses, are activated in response to the individual α1A- and α1B-AR subtypes in cardiac myocytes. To this end, we constructed a constitutively active mutant of the α1a-AR subtype by analogy to a previously described constitutively active mutant of the α1b-AR subtype (9.Cotecchia S. Exum S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2896-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Such constitutively active receptors have the advantage that their signaling properties can be examined in the absence of agonist. Following introduction of the individual constitutively active α1-AR subtypes into the normal cellular context of cardiac myocytes in which the wild type receptor subtypes are expressed, we determined which signaling pathways are activated in response to each mutant receptor subtype in the absence of agonist. Materials were obtained from the following sources: BMY 7378, prazosin, 5-methylurapidil, oxymetazoline, and WB-4101 (Research Biochemicals International); phenylephrine, propranolol, and phentolamine (Sigma); [3H]prazosin, [125I]HEAT (NEN Life Science Products);myo-[3H]inositol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech); AG1-X8 resin (Bio-Rad); and pREP4 and pREP8 expression vectors and Sindbis Virus Expression Kit (Invitrogen). The α1a-S290/293-AR cDNA was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis of the bovine α1a-AR cDNA, which was generously provided by Dr. Jon Lomasney, Northwestern University Medical School. The oligonucleotides 5′-CGCGAGCATAAAGCGCTCAAAACGCTG-3′ and 5′-CGTTTTGAGCGCTTTATGCTCGCGGGA-3′ were used to generate the appropriate mutations at Lys290→ His and Ala293 → Leu. The mutant α1a-S290/293-AR cDNA was verified by DNA sequencing. For expression studies in COS-m6 cells, the cDNA encoding the mutant α1a-S290/293-AR subtype was subcloned into the BamHI site of the pBC12B1 expression vector. The cDNA encoding the mutant α1b-S288–294-AR subtype in the pBC12B1 expression vector was kindly provided by Dr. Susanna Cotecchia, Lausanne, Switzerland. The α1b-S288–294-AR should be phenotypically identical to the α1a-S290/293-AR, since only substitutions at Lys290 → His and Ala293 → Leu were shown to be responsible for constitutive activity (9.Cotecchia S. Exum S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2896-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The cDNAs encoding the wild type α1a-AR and α1b-AR subtypes in the pREP4 and pREP8 expression vectors, respectively, were generously provided by Dr. Kenneth Minneman (Emory University Medical School). For expression studies in cardiac myocytes, the cDNA fragments encoding the mutant α1a-S290/293-AR and α1b-S288–294-AR subtypes were subcloned into the pSinRep5 vector (Invitrogen). The 1.5-kb cDNA fragment encoding the mutant α1a-S290/293-AR was released from the pBC12B1 vector by digestion with BamHI. After filling in the sticky ends with dNTPs and Klenow polymerase, this cDNA fragment was ligated into the StuI site of the pSinRep5 vector. Similarly, the 2-kb cDNA fragment encoding the mutant α1b-S288–294-AR was released from the pBC12BI vector by digestion with EcoRI and Pml1. The 2-kb cDNA fragment was isolated and further digested withApaLI to generate a 1.9-kb cDNA fragment. After filling in the sticky ends with dNTPs and Klenow polymerase, this cDNA fragment was ligated into the StuI site of the pSinRep5 vector. Expression of the wild type and mutant receptors in COS-m6 cells was carried out by the DEAE-dextran transfection procedure (10.Cullen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 684-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). On day 0, COS-m6 cells were plated at a density of 2 × 106 cells/100-mm dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. On day 1, cells were transfected with varying concentrations of plasmid DNA and DEAE-dextran. The cells were harvested 48 h later for measurement of total or cell surface receptor binding. For total receptor binding, the cells were lysed with a Polytron homogenizer in ice-cold buffer containing 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 5 mmEDTA, and the cell lysates were centrifuged at 50,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. The resulting membrane pellets were resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EDTA at a protein concentration of 1–3 mg/ml. Receptor expression was monitored by selective displacement of the α1-AR antagonist, [3H]prazosin, from these membranes. Briefly, 0.03 mg of membrane protein was incubated in a total volume of 90 μl of assay buffer consisting of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1% bovine serum albumin, and [3H]prazosin for 45 min at room temperature. In the competition binding experiments, membranes were incubated with 1 nm of the [3H]prazosin in the presence or absence of varying concentrations of competing ligands. In the saturation binding experiments, membranes were incubated with 0.2–15 nm [3H]prazosin in the presence or absence of 10 μm phentolamine to determine nonspecific and total binding, respectively. The incubation was terminated by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold assay buffer, followed by rapid filtration over Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters. After washing the tubes and filters three times with 1 ml of ice-cold assay buffer, membrane-bound [3H]prazosin retained on the filters was counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. For cell surface receptor binding, the cells were washed 8 times with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline to remove antagonists that were present in the growth media (see “Results” for details) and then gently released from the dishes by incubation in 1 ml of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% trypsin and 0.5 mm EDTA for 2 min at 37 °C. The cell suspensions were treated with 5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% serum to inactivate the trypsin and centrifuged at 1,500 × rpm. The cell pellets were resuspended in assay buffer to give approximately 2.5 × 106 cells/ml. The binding of the α1-AR antagonist, [3H]prazosin, to the resuspended cells was performed as described above in a final volume of 500 μl containing approximately 1 × 106 cells. An aliquot of cells was counted by trypan blue staining to ensure the intactness of the cells. Cardiac myocytes were prepared from hearts of 1–2-day-old Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats. Briefly, the ventricles were removed, digested with a mixture of trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase in a Celstir apparatus at 37 °C, and subjected to Percoll step gradients to obtain an enriched fraction of greater than 94% myocytes, as described previously (11.Hansen C.A. Joseph S.K. Robishaw J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Myocytes were suspended in modified Eagle's medium (MEM) containing 5% newborn calf serum, 100 μm 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin and plated at a density of 5 × 105/18-mm well, 1 × 106/35-mm well, and 2 × 106/60-mm dish. Following overnight incubation, the serum-containing medium was removed and replaced with a defined serum-free medium, as detailed previously (11.Hansen C.A. Joseph S.K. Robishaw J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Myocytes were maintained in the defined serum-free medium for 24 h before being used for viral infection. By standard gene transfer methods, cardiac myocytes are not easily transfected. Therefore, it was necessary to develop a viral infection procedure in order to be able to measure activation of signaling pathways in response to the introduction of a specific mutant receptor subtype in the whole cell population. In another study, we demonstrated the ability of a recombinant Sindbis virus to infect greater than 90% of the cardiac myocytes, as measured by positive β-galactosidase staining. 3C. A. Hansen, V. Kalman, J. Asundi, W. Reinheimer, T. Smink, and J. D. Robishaw, manuscript in preparation. Therefore, in the present study, recombinant Sindbis viruses encoding the mutant α1a-S290/293-AR and α1b-S288–294-AR subtypes were used to infect cardiac myocytes. For construction of recombinant Sindbis viruses, the pSinRep5 vector containing the cDNA for either the mutant α1a-S290/293-AR or mutant α1b-S288–294-AR was linearized withNotI. The pSinRep5 vector containing the cDNA for the LacZ was linearized with XhoI. The capped RNA transcripts were generated by in vitro transcription of the pSinRep cDNAs as well as the DH-BB helper virus DNA, as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). The recombinant Sindbis viruses were harvested from the medium of baby hamster kidney cells that had been electroporated 28 h earlier with the capped RNA transcripts. For measurement of receptor expression, neonatal cardiac myocytes growing on 60-mm dishes were infected with recombinant Sindbis virus encoding either LacZ, mutant α1a-S290/293-AR, or mutant α1b-S288–294-AR. The appropriate dilutions of recombinant Sindbis virus were determined empirically to yield comparable levels of mutant α1a-S290/293-AR and mutant α1b-S288–294-AR expression. After the initial 1-h infection period, the medium was supplemented with the α1-AR antagonist, WB-4101, to a final concentration of 1 μm. The inclusion of WB-4101 in the medium was found to increase significantly the number of mutant receptors expressed on the cell surface. At 48 h post-infection, the cardiac myocytes were lysed in homogenization buffer consisting of 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm AEBSF, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A by 12 passages through a 25-gauge needle. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 265,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to pellet the membrane fractions. The membrane pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mmEDTA, assayed for protein concentration, and used for measurement of receptor expression. Briefly, 0.01 mg of membranes were incubated with a saturating concentration of [125I]HEAT (4 nm) in a total volume of 90 μl of incubation buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mmEDTA, and 1% bovine serum albumin for 45 min at 25 °C (7.Wenham D. Rahmatullah R.J. Rahmatullah M. Hansen C.A. Robishaw J.D. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 339: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The reactions were stopped by addition of 1 ml of ice-cold incubation buffer and rapid filtration of the mixture over Whatman GF/C filters. The tubes and filters were washed three times with ice-cold incubation buffer, and the filters were counted in a Beckman gamma counter. Nonspecific binding was determined by the inclusion of 1 μm prazosin. In the studies employing COS-m6 cells, cells growing on 18-mm wells were transfected and then labeled for 24 h with medium containingmyo-[3H]inositol (2 μCi/ml). After 24 h labeling, the medium was replaced with medium containing 20 mm LiCl followed by addition of agonist or vehicle for another 45 min. The cells were stopped by the addition of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (final concentration of 6%). The precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation, solubilized in 0.25m NaOH, 0.2% SDS, and protein concentrations were determined. The supernatants were extracted three times with 3 volumes of water-saturated diethyl ether and incubated at 55 °C for 60 min, and the neutralized aqueous extracts were applied to 1-ml columns of Dowex AG-1-X8, formate form. Total inositol phosphates were eluted using a standard procedure (13.Berridge M.J. Dawson R.M. Downes C.P. Heslop J.P. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1541) Google Scholar) and counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. For the neonatal cardiac myocyte studies, cells growing on 18-mm wells were infected with the various recombinant Sindbis viruses. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were labeled with media supplemented withmyo-[3H]inositol (2 μCi/ml). At 48 h post-Sindbis virus infection, the cells were treated with 10 mm LiCl in the presence or absence of 100 μmphenylephrine and 1 μm propranolol for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were stopped by two rapid 1-ml washes of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline followed by the addition of 1 ml of 6% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid. After scraping, the cells were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min to remove the precipitated proteins. The supernatants were extracted three times with diethyl ether, and the extracts were applied to 0.5-ml columns of Dowex AG-1-X8, formate form. Inositol phosphates were eluted by a standard procedure (13.Berridge M.J. Dawson R.M. Downes C.P. Heslop J.P. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1541) Google Scholar) and counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Neonatal rat cardiac myocytes growing on 35-mm wells were treated in the presence or absence of 100 μm phenylephrine in the presence of 1 μm propranolol for 5 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by two washes with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline followed by addition of 75 μl of MAPK extraction buffer, consisting of 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm vanadate, 1 mm DTT, 10 mmbenzamidine, 1 mm AEBSF, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin A. After scraping, the cell extracts were incubated on ice for 15 min and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fractions were assayed for protein concentration using the Coomassie Plus Protein Assay (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein were electrophoresed on 11% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). MAPK activation was determined by immunoblotting with a polyclonal antisera that recognizes only the doubly phosphorylated forms of ERK1 and ERK2 (Anti-active MAPK, Promega, 1:10,000), which is the form of MAPK that possesses myelin basic protein phosphorylating activity. Western blots stripped and reprobed with a monoclonal pan-ERK1/ERK2 antibody (Promega) showed equivalent amounts of ERK1/ERK2 protein across the lanes. The amounts of active and total ERK1 and ERK2 were visualized by incubating the immunoblot with a goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:5000) followed by enhanced chemiluminescent detection using the SuperSignal Chemiluminescent Substrate Kit (Pierce). Cultured cardiac myocytes were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA using either the SRE-luciferase reporter plasmid (Stratagene, Inc.) or the ANF promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid, which was the generous gift of Dr. J. H. Brown. An aliquot of 1 μg of luciferase reporter plasmids (SRE or ANF) was mixed with 7 μl of the “Plus” component of LipofectAmine Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 100 μl of Opti-MEM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. In a separate tube, 7 μl of the lipid component of LipofectAMINE Plus reagent was added to 100 μl of Opti-MEM medium and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The contents of the two tubes were then mixed together and incubated an additional 30 min at room temperature. The cardiac myocyte tissue culture plates (60 mm) were washed with Opti-MEM medium and then 1 ml of fresh Opti-MEM medium without antibiotics was added to each cell plate. The contents of the DNA/LipofectAMINE Plus mixture was then added to each dish of myocytes. After 5 h, the transfection media were removed and the myocytes maintained in Opti-MEM medium without antibiotics. For luciferase gene expression assays, the cardiac myocytes were lysed in 0.5 ml of 1× lysis buffer (Promega Corp.). The cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were transferred to a new tube. Approximately 50 μl of the supernatant was assayed in duplicate for SRE- and/or ANF-luciferase gene expression using a Luciferase Assay System with Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega Corp.). Relative light units were measured utilizing a Lumat LB9507 EG&G Berthold luminometer with myocyte cell lysates. Following luciferase assays, β-galactosidase enzyme assays were performed in duplicate samples. The luciferase relative light unit numbers were divided by the β-galactosidase enzyme assay numbers to correct for the transfection efficiency in the myocytes. The cardiac cell lysate from the luciferase assays was assayed spectrophotometrically for the β-galactosidase enzyme activity in cardiac myocytes using the β-Galactosidase Enzyme Assay System with Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega). Values represent the mean ± S.E. Saturation binding and competition binding curves were analyzed using the nonlinear, least squares regression analysis program GraphPad Prizm (GraphPad Software). Estimates of ligand binding affinity (K D) and receptor density (B max) were obtained from saturation isotherms by fitting the data to a rectangular hyperbola. IC50 values from competition binding experiments were converted toK i values using the Cheng and Prusoff equation (14.Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12328) Google Scholar):K i = IC50/(1 + [A]/K D) (14.Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12328) Google Scholar), where [A] is the concentration of ligand used and K D was determined from the saturation binding studies. To address whether constitutively active mutants of the α1a-AR and the α1b-AR subtypes could be used to probe their subtype-specific coupling to signaling pathways, a constitutively active mutant of the α1a-AR needed to be constructed. A constitutively active mutant α1b-AR subtype has already been constructed and characterized by Dr. Cotecchia (9.Cotecchia S. Exum S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2896-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the α1a-AR subtype was mutated at Lys290 and Ala293 (α1a-S290/293–AR) to mirror the substitutions previously found to result in maximal constitutive activation of the mutant α1b-AR subtype (9.Cotecchia S. Exum S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2896-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Properties that have been shown to be characteristic of constitutive activation include the following: 1) an increased affinity of a receptor for agonist but not for antagonist; 2) an elevated basal level of signaling; and 3) an increased agonist-stimulated level of signaling. To determine whether the mutant α1a-S290/293-AR subtype exhibited any or all of these properties, the mutant α1a-S290/293-AR subtype was expressed and then characterized in COS-m6 cells. Since COS-m6 cells do not express wild type α1-ARs, these cells provide a convenient background in which to study the properties of the mutant α1a-S290/293-AR subtype. COS-m6 cells transfected with either the wild type α1a-AR or the mutant α1a-S290/293-AR were characterized in terms of their affinity for various agonists and antagonists by monitoring the displacement of [3H]prazosin through agonist or antagonist competition binding assays. Phenylephrine and norepinephrine, both full α1-AR agonists (15.Minneman K.P. Theroux T.L. Hollinger S. Han C. Esbenshade T.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 929-936PubMed Google Scholar), displaced [3H]prazosin from membranes expressing the α1a-S290/293 mutant with approximately 40-fold higher affinities than those expressing the wild type receptor (Fig. 1; TableI). The partial imidazoline agonist, oxymetazoline (15.Minneman K.P. Theroux T.L. Hollinger S. Han C. Esbenshade T.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 929-936PubMed Google Scholar), also demonstrated a higher affinity for the α1a-S290/293-AR (Fig. 1), although the difference in affinity, in this case, was only 6-fold (Table I). The antagonist, 5-methylurapidil, demonstrated similar affinity for both the wild type and mutant receptors (Fig. 1; Table I). The agonist and antagonist competition curves fitted best to a single-site model, where Hill coefficients were between 0.7 and 1.0. These data demonstrate that the mutant α1a-S290/293-AR showed an increase in binding affinity for agonist but not for antagonist compared with its wild type counterpart. These data provide the first confirmation that the mutant α1a-S290/293-AR possesses properties reminiscent of other constitutively active receptors (9.Cotecchia S. Exum S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2896-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these data suggest that the difference in agonist binding affinity observed between the wild type and mutant α1a-ARs may be related to the intrinsic activity of the agonist (i.e. a larger difference is observed for the full agonist, phenylephrine, compared with the partial agonist, oxymetazoline), and this observation is in agreement with that previously described for a constitutively active mutant of the β2-AR (16.Samama P.

https://openalex.org/W1973579207,"The Rev protein of human immunodeficiency virus is a nuclear shuttling protein that promotes nuclear export of mRNAs that encode the viral structural proteins Gag, Pol, and Env. Rev binds to a highly structured RNA motif, the Rev-responsive element (RRE), that is present in all Rev-responsive viral transcripts and facilitates their entry into a nuclear export pathway by recruiting cellular export factors. In mammalian and yeast cells, the principal export receptor engaged by Rev has been identified as the importin/transportin family member CRM1/exportin 1. CRM1 binds directly to a leucine-rich nuclear export sequence (NES) present in Rev, and similar motifs have been identified in a variety of cellular nuclear shuttling proteins. We and our colleagues previously demonstrated that, in transfected <i>Drosophila</i> cells, HIV-1 Rev is fully functional and promotes expression of the viral envelope glycoprotein. We now demonstrate that the fundamental mechanism of Rev action in insect cells is identical to that observed in the mammalian systems. In particular, we show that <i>Drosophila</i> cells express a leptomycin B-sensitive homologue of human CRM1 that supports Rev-dependent gene expression and is required for nuclear export of NES-containing proteins in insect cells."

We show here that the latter can, however, stimulate the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions in epithelial-like HeLa cells. Transient expression of β<sub>1</sub> with γ<sub>2</sub>, γ<sub>5</sub>, γ<sub>7</sub>, and γ<sub>12</sub> in quiescent HeLa cells induced stress fiber formation and focal adhesion assembly as did expression of the constitutively active Gα<sub>12</sub>. Co-expression of βγ with Gα<sub>i2</sub> and the C-terminal fragment of the β-adrenergic receptor kinase, both of which are known to bind and sequester free βγ, blocked βγ-induced stress fiber and focal adhesion formation. Inhibition was also noted with co-expression of a dominant negative mutant of Rho. Botulinum C3 exoenzyme, which ADP-ribosylates and inactivates Rho, and a Rho-associated protein kinase inhibitor, Y-27632, similarly inhibited βγ-induced stress fiber and focal adhesion assembly. These results indicate that G protein βγ subunits regulate Rho-dependent actin polymerization in HeLa cells."
https://openalex.org/W2059637408,"We report the identification and cloning of a unique chick myosin heavy chain (CMHC1) that is expressed exclusively in the heart during embryogenesis.

Sequence analysis indicated that CMHC1 was a novel member of the myosin heavy chain family.

Whereas great progress has been recently made in understanding the process of heart morphogenesis, the precise molecular mechanisms, which specify early cells to a cardiogenic phenotype, have remained elusive. Examination of regulatory sequences of genes that are expressed in these early cardiogenic cells has provided a wealth of information into the regulatory mechanisms of cardiac differentiation. The sarcomeric structure of striated muscle is composed of a large array of proteins that are arranged into a contractile apparatus. The major component of this sarcomeric structure is myosin that is composed of two heavy chains (MHC)1and four light chains. MHC isoforms are encoded by a large gene family within vertebrates and serve as an excellent marker for differentiated cardiac and skeletal muscle. The myosin heavy chain gene family appears to have arisen from multiple duplications of a common ancestral MHC gene (1.Weiss A. Leiwand L.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Whereas the MHC isoforms are highly conserved to one another and cross-species, the number of isoforms that have been isolated varies between different species. In rats and humans, 12 genes in the MHC family have been isolated, whereas greater than 30 distinct isoforms have been isolated in chicken and Xenopus (2.Robbins J. Horan T. Gulick J. Kropp K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6606-6612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Radice G.P. Malacinski G.M. Dev. Biol. 1989; 133: 562-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The functional significance of species variation of MHC gene expression is not clear. In mammals, α-MHC and β-MHC are the two major isoforms of myosin heavy chain that are expressed in the myocardium. Whereas these two genes are arranged in tandem in the mammalian genome, α-MHC and β-MHC expression is developmentally and hormonally regulated independently from one another (4.Saez L.J. Gianola K.M. McNally E.M. Feghali R. Eddy R. Shows T.B. Leinwand L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5443-5459Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). During murine embryonic development, α-MHC is the predominant MHC isoform expressed in the atria with the β-MHC isoform localized to the ventricles (5.Rushbrook J.I. Weiss C. Ko K. Feuerman M.H. Carleton S. Ing A. Jacoby J. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1994; 15: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Following birth, an isoform switch occurs in the ventricles with a down-regulation of β-MHC and a subsequent induction of α-MHC expression (6.Lyons G.E. Schiaffino S. Sassoon D. Barton P. Buckingham M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2427-2436Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 7.Ng W.A. Grupp I.L. Subramaniam A. Robbins J. Circ. Res. 1991; 68: 1742-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In addition to expression in cardiac muscle, α-MHC and β-MHC expression is also detected in skeletal muscle fibers and cell lines (8.Lyons G.E. Ontell M. Cox R. Sassoon D. Buckingham M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1465-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 9.Molkentin J.D. Jabe S.M. Markham B.E. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1996; 28: 1211-1225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Proper expression of these cardiac MHCs is critical for heart formation and for the survival of the species. Gene ablation experiments of α-MHC in the mouse cause embryonic lethality at approximately 11 days post coitum of severe cardiac defects. In addition, α-MHC+/− heterozygotes produce hearts with impaired contractility and alterations in sarcomeric structure (10.Jones W.D. Grupp I.L. Doetschman T. Grupp G. Osinska H. Hewett T.E. Boivin G. Gulick J. Ng W.A. Robbins J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1906-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Mutations in the β-MHC locus have been genetically implicated in familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathies (11.Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Mol. Biol. Med. 1991; 8: 159-166PubMed Google Scholar). Using a variety of monoclonal antibodies, Evans et al. (12.Evans D. Miller J.B. Stockdale F.E. Dev. Biol. 1988; 127: 376-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) detected at least three distinct, independently regulated MHC isoforms in the developing chicken heart, suggesting a complex regulation of MHC expression occurs during avian cardiac morphogenesis. To date, two isoforms of myosin heavy chain, AMHC1 and VMHC1, have been molecularly cloned in the chicken heart. Expression of AMHC1 is localized exclusively to the atria and atrial progenitor cells of the early heart field, with no expression detected in the ventricles or in skeletal muscle or skeletal muscle precursor cells (13.Yutzey K.E. Rhee J.T. Bader D. Dev. Biol. 1994; 120: 871-883Google Scholar). The atrial-specific expression of AMHC1 is unique even among other avian species. AMHC1 expression differs from slow myosin heavy chain 3 gene, a quail homologue that is highly homologous to AMHC1 coding sequences. The quail slow myosin heavy chain 3 gene is expressed throughout the heart until embryonic day 7 when ventricular expression is repressed. Expression of quail slow MHC 3 is also detected in embryonic slow skeletal muscles (14.Nikovits Jr., W. Wang G.F. Feldman J.L. Miller J.B. Wade R. Nelson L. Stockdale F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17047-17056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 15.Wang G.F. Nikovits Jr., W. Schleinitz M. Stockdale F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19836-19845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). VMHC1 expression is detected throughout the developing chick heart until day 5 of development when its cardiac expression is restricted to the ventricle. Expression of VMHC1 is also transiently detected in all embryonic skeletal muscle (16.Bisaha J.G. Bader D. Dev. Biol. 1991; 148: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Whereas great strides have been made in understanding the molecular regulation of cardiac differentiation, progress has been hindered by the identification of few genes that are expressed in a strictly cardiac-specific manner from the earliest stages of cardiac differentiation to the formation of a fully functional, multichambered heart. In this report, we describe a third and unique member of myosin heavy chain family that is expressed in the developing chick heart. CMHC1, isolated from embryonic day 10 chick hearts, is a member of the myosin heavy chain gene family, which is expressed exclusively in cardiac muscle. Expression of CMHC1 is first detected in stage 6 embryos with high levels of expression throughout the myocardium in all stages of embryonic development. Northern blot, in situhybridization, and RT-PCR analysis failed to detect the presence of CMHC1 mRNA expression in any skeletal muscle tissues or skeletal muscle precursor cells. Genomic cloning of CMHC1 indicates 2.2 kb of 5′-flanking sequence from the CMHC1 transcription start site is sufficient to induce high levels of reporter gene expression in cardiomyocytes. Taken together, these results indicate that CMHC1 is one of a very limited number of genes expressed exclusively in the heart during cardiac morphogenesis. CMHC1 was isolated from cDNA produced from embryonic day 14 chicken hearts. Primers were used, which were specific to homologous regions of previously isolated chicken striated myosin heavy chain cDNAs. Two forward primers (F17, 5′-TTC AAC AGC TTT GAG CAG CTC TG-3′; F19, 5′-TTT TGG CAT GGA CCT CCA GG-3′) were used with one reverse primer (B20, 5′-TTA CCA AGA GTG CAT CCC GGC G-3′). The F17 primer was designed to lie approximately 100 bp further 5′ to the F19 primer. RT-PCR using 100 ng of RNA was performed in a Perkin-Elmer-2400 thermocycler using a Access RT-PCR System (Promega) with the following PCR conditions: 50 °C for 30 min; 94 °C for 2 min; 94 °C for 30 s, 52 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 45 s X 25 cycles; and 68 °C for 7 min. PCR reactions were run on a 1% agarose gel. The 900-bp product from the F19-B20 primer pairs and the 100-bp product of the F17-B20 primer pairs were excised from the gel and directly cloned into the pGem T-Easy PCR cloning vector (Promega). Positive clones were sequenced using Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing (Perkin-Elmer). The overlapping 900 bp of the F17 and F19 PCR products were 100% identical indicating both clones were CMHC1. Nucleotide homology between CMHC1 and other MHCs was analyzed using BLAST searches. The F19 PCR product was used to screen a day 3 chicken embryonic heart cDNA library. 500,000 plaques were hybridized using Rapid-Hyb hybridization solution (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 65 °C. Filters were washed with four successive 30 min washes using 0.1X SSC, 0.1% SDS. Three positive overlapping clones were isolated with the largest clone containing 2.5 kb of a cDNA sequence spanning into the putative translational start site into the 5′-untranslated region. The 5′-end of the CMHC1 cDNA was obtained using 1 μg of Poly(A)+ RNA from embryonic day 8 chicken hearts using a Marathon cDNA Amplification Kit (CLONTECH). Gene-specific primers were as follows: CMHC1 R1, 5′-GGA GTT GTC ATT TCT CAG GGT TTT GGC C-3′; CMHC1 R2, 5′-CGT GGT ATG CGT TAT CAG CAA TGG-3′. PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 30 s; 94 °C for 5 s and 68 °C for 3 min X 30 cycles; 68 °C for 7 min. Amplified PCR products were sequenced using Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing (Perkin-Elmer). To begin to understand the basic molecular regulatory mechanisms that control the cardiac-specific expression of CMHC1, chicken genomic libraries were screened to identify 5′-genomic flanking regions of CMHC1. Five independent genomic clones were isolated from a chicken genomic pWE15 library using a 800-bp probe corresponding to nucleotides 385–1185 of the CMHC1 cDNA sequence. Interestingly, all five clones began at the same site within the second intron of CMHC1. To obtain sequences further 5′ to this site, chicken genomic genewalker libraries (CLONTECH)and PCR reactions were performed using primers specific to genomic sequences contained within the second intron. A 1.5-kb fragment (S13) was isolated from the ScaI library and sequenced. The S13 fragment extended the genomic sequence of CMHC1 into the first intron. Within the S13 sequence was located aBamHI restriction site at the point in the genomic sequence where the pWE15 clones ended. A final genomic screen was performed using a 800-bp probe at the 5′-end of the S13 fragment to screen a λEMBL3 chicken genomic library (CLONTECH). Three isolated clones were positive for CMHC1 genomic sequences. Following aBamHI digestion, the S13 probe reacted to a 6.8-kb fragment from the isolated genomic clones. Total RNA was obtained from day 17 and 19 chicken embryos as described previously (17.Croissant J.D. Kim J-H. Eichele G. Goering L. Lough J. Prywes R. Schwartz R.J. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 250-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Total RNA (15 μg) was electrophoresed on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred onto GeneScreen membranes. Blots were hybridized at 65 °C and probed overnight with the F19 fragment described above. Blots were washed under high stringency conditions (0.1X SSC, 0.1% SDS). Fertilized White Leghorn chicken eggs were obtained from Truslow Farms and incubated at 37 °C. Embryos were collected and staged according to Hamburger and Hamilton (18.Hamburger V. Hamilton H. J. Morphol. 1951; 88: 49-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (10047) Google Scholar). In situ hybridizations were performed as described in Yutzey et al. (13.Yutzey K.E. Rhee J.T. Bader D. Dev. Biol. 1994; 120: 871-883Google Scholar) with the following exceptions. Stages 10 and 12 embryos were treated with 30 μg/ml proteinase K for 7.5 min, and stage 20 embryos were treated for 15 min. The F19 PCR fragment ligated into the pGEM T-Easy vector was used for the CMHC1 probe. The antisense CMHC1 probe was created from 1 μg ofNcoI-linearized F19 vector using SP6 RNA polymerase. Following ethanol precipitation the resulting digoxygenin-labeled RNA probe was resuspended with 200 μl of hybridization solution. 50 μl of probe was then added to each in situ reaction. Following the reactions, embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and photographed on a 1% agarose plate using a Nikon SMZ-U dissecting microscope. RT-PCR reactions for detection of CMHC1 in tissues and embryonic development were performed using the reaction conditions described previously. Primers to CMHC1, which were utilized in this experiment, were unique to CMHC1 and are not found in other myosin heavy chain sequences as confirmed by BLAST sequence searches. Primers for CMHC1 were 5′-TGA CCA GGG TGG AGA AAA G-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTG TCC TCT GGG ATT GCA CCT G-3′ (reverse), which produced a 312-bp product. Primers for chicken GAPDH were 5′-ACG CCA TCA CTA TCT TCC AG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAG CCT TCA CTA CCC TCT TG-3′, which produced a 578-bp product. Following the RT-PCR reaction, samples were run on a 1% agarose gel, transferred to GeneScreen hybridization membrane, and probed with a random primed probe to F19 described above. A 6.8-kb BamHI fragment of genomic CMHC1 DNA from the λEMBL3 clone was cloned into theBglII site of the pGL-3 Basic (Promega) luciferase reporter gene (-5205CMHCluc). Deletions constructs were generated fromKpnI-SacI digestions of -5205CMHCluc using an Erase-A-Base system (Promega). Resulting constructs were sequenced to determine the starting location of the plasmid. Primary cardiomyocytes were isolated from hearts of embryonic day 11 White Leghorn chickens (Truslow Farms) as described previously (15.Wang G.F. Nikovits Jr., W. Schleinitz M. Stockdale F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19836-19845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells were obtained from ATCC and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 20% fetal bovine serum. All cells were transfected on 35-mm plates with 2 μg of DNA (1.75 μg of reporter plasmid and 0.25 μg of CMV-βGAL) and 4 μl of FuGene3 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to manufacturer's specifications. Cell extracts were collected 48 h after transfection and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity. Luciferase results were normalized for β-galactosidase activity. Experiments were performed in triplicate using three independent isolated cardiac cell cultures. To analyze the molecular mechanisms that regulate the expression of early cardiac-specific genes, attempts were made to isolate novel myosin genes that are expressed exclusively in the heart and cardiac progenitor cells. Using primers specific to known myosin heavy chains, RT-PCR was used to isolate a 1.2-kb cDNA fragment from embryonic day 10 chicken heart RNA (CMHC1). The resulting CMHC1 PCR product was sequenced and used to screen an embryonic chicken heart cDNA library. A 2.5-kb clone was isolated, which hybridized to CMHC1 sequences. This cDNA clone of CMHC1 represented a partial clone, which contained 60-bp of 5′-untranslated sequences and a deduced continuous open reading frame consisting of 884 amino acids (Fig.1). Whereas its nucleotide sequence in the coding region and 5′-untranslated region was unique to all currently known myosin heavy chain isoforms, CMHC1 showed a high degree of sequence identity to other myosin heavy chain transcripts that are expressed in striated muscle. CMHC1 was 72–75% identical to embryonic and pectoralis myosin heavy chain isoforms found in the chicken, as well as α- and β-cardiac myosin heavy chain isoforms found in mouse and human. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of CMHC1 showed 100% identity to the amino acid sequence of the S-1 region of a cardiac myosin heavy chain protein isolated from adult chicken heart (19.Nakayama S. Tanaka H. Yajima E. Maita T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 909-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The highest region of amino acid similarity between CMHC1 and other myosin heavy chain isoforms is in the highly conserved S-1 region of the molecule required for ATPase activity. The CMHC1 isoform contains the GESGAGKT sequence that is conserved among all myosins (20.Kendrew J. The Encyclopedia of Molecular Biology. Blackwell Science, Oxford1994: 700Google Scholar). The region between residues 118 and 191 is 84% identical to chicken embryonic myosin heavy chain and 87% identical to the α- and β-cardiac myosin heavy chain isoforms of mouse and human. These data demonstrate the high conservation of CMHC1 with other MHC family members in both avian and mammalian species. To map the transcriptional start site of the CMHC1 message, two antisense primers specific to the CMHC1 message were designed to perform a 5′-RACE assay. The two antisense gene-specific primers, underlined in Fig. 1, were designed 782 bp and 543 bp downstream of the 5′-end of the CMHC1 cDNA clone described earlier. Using Poly(A)+ RNA isolated from ED 8 chicken hearts, these primers produced 5′-RACE products containing 782 bp and 543 bp respective to the 5′-CMHC1 sequence (Fig. 2). Similarly sized PCR products were obtained using these primers to amplify CMHC1 transcripts out of a chicken embryonic heart cDNA library (data not shown). Sequencing of both of the resulting PCR products showed no discrepancies between the two products or the initial cDNA sequence isolated from the heart cDNA library described earlier. These results suggest the CMHC1 gene contains 60 bp of an untranslated sequence upstream of the presumptive translational start site. As CMHC1 appeared to be a novel mRNA, its expression was examined in striated muscle types; RNA was collected from striated muscle-containing tissues of day 17 and day 19 chicken embryos and analyzed by Northern blot analysis using a probe corresponding to the 2.5-kb cDNA clone described previously. Expression of CMHC1 was detected only in the heart with no detectable expression in fast twitch skeletal muscle of the leg or slow twitch skeletal muscle isolated from the pectoralis muscle (Fig. 3). The cDNA probe to CMHC1 hybridized to a transcript of approximately 6 kb, which is common to the transcript size of other known myosin heavy chain genes found in striated muscle. The intriguing cardiac-specific gene expression of CMHC1 as detected by Northern blot analysis was further tested by using the highly sensitive RT-PCR assay to detect CMHC1 transcripts in striated muscle tissue. RNA isolated from heart and skeletal muscle of day 5, 7, and 11 chicken embryos were subjected to RT-PCR, run on a 1.5% agarose gel, and probed with CMHC1. Amplified CMHC1 transcripts were detected using a random-primed CMHC1 probe, which overlaps the amplified sequences. Using this method, amplification of CMHC1 transcripts was only detected in cardiac muscle of the heart with no expression observed in skeletal muscle isolated from leg or pectoralis muscle (Fig.4). Moreover, RT-PCR analysis failed to detect CMHC1 transcripts in smooth muscle of the gizzard or in an embryonic carcass with the heart removed. 2J. D. Croissant, S. Carpenter, and D. Bader, unpublished observations. These results suggest that CMHC1 is a novel member of the myosin heavy chain family, which is expressed exclusively in the heart during the development of the chicken embryo. Previous Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses indicated CMHC1 expression was restricted to the heart in the developing chick embryo. To determine the spatial and temporal expression pattern of CMHC1 during the earliest stages of avian cardiogenesis, whole mount in situ hybridizations were performed on early chick embryos. Hybridizations using a sense control riboprobe showed no reactivity to any embryo at any stage of avian development. By in situ hybridization, CMHC1 mRNA expression was first detected in Hamburger-Hamilton stage 8 chick embryos in the cardiac progenitor cells of the splanchnic mesoderm of the cardiac crescent (data not shown). The timing of CMHC1 expression corresponds to the induction of VMHC1 in the paired heart primordia (13.Yutzey K.E. Rhee J.T. Bader D. Dev. Biol. 1994; 120: 871-883Google Scholar). By stage 10, the fusing myocardium showed robust expression of CMHC1 in the anterior segments of the heart tube (Fig.5 A). High levels of CMHC1 expression continued in the developing heart of stage 12 embryos (Fig.5 B), and continued expression was detected throughout the looping heart of stage 20 embryos (Fig. 5, C andD). Comparison of the embryonic localization between CMHC1 and VMHC1 transcripts indicates the unique cardiac-specific gene expression of CMHC1 that is not observed in other cardiac myosin heavy chains. Although both CMHC1 and VMHC1 are highly expressed in the myocardium of stage 15 embryos, VMHC1 transcripts are also readily detectable in the developing somites (Fig. 5, E and F). These results suggest that although VMHC1, CMHC1, and AMHC1 are highly expressed during cardiac morphogenesis, these three MHC genes are expressed in a distinct subset of cardiac and skeletal muscle cells during chick embryogenesis. Unlike most of the other known cardiac-specific structural genes such as VMHC1, CMHC1 expression was never detected in the skeletal muscle precursor cells of the somites (stage 8–12) or in the developing limb buds (stage 20). RT-PCR analysis was utilized as a sensitive assay to examine the initial stages of detectable CMHC1 expression. RNA was isolated from chicken embryos of stages 4–11. Primers of chick GAPDH was utilized to ensure the integrity of the RNA used in this experiment. Low levels of CMHC1 were first detected in stage 5 embryos (Fig.6). It is at this stage of avian development when expression of Nkx-2.5, SRF, and GATA4, three transcription factors implicated in the induction of cardiac-specific gene expression, are first detected (17.Croissant J.D.

Chem. 1994; 269: 23177-23184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of CMHC1 was readily detectable at stage 7, corresponding with the induction of other cardiac structural genes such as cardiac troponin I and VMHC1 (16.Bisaha J.G. Bader D. Dev. Biol. 1991; 148: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 23.Hastings K.E.M. Koppe R.I. Marmor E. Bader D. Shimada Y. Toyota N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19659-19665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By stage 11, when the heart begins to beat and a full array of cardiac structural genes are expressed, CMHC1 transcripts remain highly expressed as detected by in situ hybridization and RT-PCR analysis. These results suggest that CMHC1 expression marks one of the earliest cardiac-specific cell markers in the developing avian embryo. Genomic sequences containing 5′-flanking regions of the CMHC1 gene were isolated from chicken genomic libraries (see “Experimental Procedures”). Analysis of the CMHC1 genomic structure by comparison of isolated genomic and cDNA sequences indicates the first exon is composed of 149 bp containing 60 bp of the 5′-untranslated region and the translational start site. Intron/exon boundaries of the isolated genomic clones match perfectly with cDNA sequences and all contain consensus donor/acceptor splice sites. Whereas the CMHC1 gene does not contain consensus TATA box sequences, two A/T-rich motifs, typical of many promoters, were found within the −100/+1 region (Fig. 7). Sequence analysis of the CMHC1 gene revealed the presence of consensus binding sites for factors that have been shown to regulate cardiac gene expression. Within the −1900/+1 region of the CMHC1 gene, multiple consensus binding sites for GATA factors and Nkx-2.5 were observed. In addition, this region of the CMHC1 gene contained several A/T-rich motifs that may serve as putative binding sites for MEF-2 factors and SRF. Finally, a thyroid response element, previously shown to regulate cardiac MHC expression in response to thyroid hormone, was located at −324 to −319. Sequences between −5200 and −1900 contained a limited number of potential cardiac regulatory domains. Because of its early cardiac-restricted expression during chicken embryogenesis, the CMHC1 promoter may be used as a model system to examine sequences that direct heart-specific gene expression. To ascertain whether the isolated CMHC1 5′-flanking region can induce high levels of expression in cardiac muscle, reporter constructs were created from isolated CMHC1 genomic clones and transfected into primary chicken cardiomyocytes. A 6800-bp fragment of the CMHC1 gene, spanning 5200 bp upstream of the transcription start site through portions of the second intron (−5205 to +260), was cloned immediately upstream of luciferase reporter gene (-5205CMHCluc). The -5205 construct was cotransfected with CMV-βGal as a transfection control into primary chicken cardiomyocytes and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and assayed for levels of luciferase activity. The -5205CMHCluc plasmid induced a modest increase in luciferase expression over vector alone when transfected into primary chicken cardiomyocytes and a greater induction of luciferase activity over NIH 3T3 fibroblasts transfected with -5205CMHCluc (Fig. 8). To begin to delineate potential cardiac enhancer regions of the CMHC1 gene, a series of deletion constructs were generated from the -5205CMHCluc plasmid. Primary cardiomyocytes and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were transfected with the deletion constructs and assayed for luciferase activity. Progressive deletion of 3000 bp from the 5′-end of -5205 CMHCluc (-2273CMHCluc) resulted in a 6.7-fold induction of luciferase activity over vector alone in cardiomyocytes and a 21.6-fold induction over -2273CMHCluc in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (Fig. 8). An additional deletion of 900 bp (-1372CMHCluc) reduced luciferase activity to background levels in both cardiomyocytes and NIH 3T3 cells, suggesting a strong cardiac enhancer is located within the −2273 to −1372 region of the CMHC1 gene. Further deletions restored high levels of luciferase expression in cardiomyocytes (-711CMHCluc and -168CMHCluc). Similar to the other deletion constructs, luciferase activity in NIH 3T3 cells remained at background levels in cells transfected with -711CMHCluc and -168CMHCluc. These results suggest the presence of negative-acting regulatory sequences in the −1372 to −711 region of the CMHC1 gene, as well as additional cardiac regulatory elements located within 168 bp of the transcriptional start site. In order to ascertain the fundamental molecular principles underlying cardiac morphogenesis, we have now isolated three isoforms of myosin heavy chain that show distinct expression patterns within the developing chicken heart. VMHC1 expression is observed ubiquitously in early striated muscle cell types before being restricted to the ventricular chamber (16.Bisaha J.G. Bader D. Dev. Biol. 1991; 148: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 24.Stewart A.F. Camoretti-Mercado B. Perlman D. Gupta M. Jakovcic S. Zak R. J. Mol. Evol. 1991; 33: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). AMHC1 expression is confined to a subset of cardiomyocytes that form the atrium (13.Yutzey K.E. Rhee J.T. Bader D. Dev. Biol. 1994; 120: 871-883Google Scholar). Finally, in this report, we describe the isolation and expression of CMHC1, a novel member of the myosin heavy chain gene family that is restricted to the developing myocardium, with no expression detected in the somites or differentiated skeletal muscle tissue. The induction of CMHC1 expression in Hamburger Hamilton stage 6 chick embryos suggests it is one of the earliest structural markers of a cardiogenic cellular phenotype. Analysis of the molecular regulation of these three myosin heavy chain genes along with other cardiac-restricted genes such as cardiac troponin I will provide an excellent model system for analyzing the precise cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive cardiac-specific gene expression and chamber diversification. The coordinated expression of cardiac structural genes in the atria and ventricles is required for proper sarcomeric formation and cardiac morphogenesis. Many cardiac structural genes in mammalian and avian species are initially expressed throughout the fusing myocardial heart tube before being confined to a specific compartment of the developing multichambered heart. The α-MHC and β-MHC isoforms in the mouse are expressed in all myocardial precursor cells before compartmentalization into the atrium and ventricles, respectively. Similarly, VMHC1 expression is localized early in all striated muscle cells and then restricted to the ventricle by day 5 of development. The functional significance on cardiac morphogenesis of these isoform switches in mouse and chicken is currently unclear. Functional differences between the three chicken MHC isoforms expressed in the heart may lie in their contractility and ATPase activities. The ATPase activity of α-MHC is 10–20-fold higher than β-MHC resulting in a greater contractile velocity in cardiac muscle strips containing α-MHC versusβ-MHC (25.Schiaffino S. Reggiani C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 371-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). The ATPase activity and contractile velocities of the chicken cardiac MHCs are not currently known; however, expression of these isoforms in specific regions of the developing chicken heart may contribute to the physiological differences between the developing atrial and ventricular chambers. Isolation of genomic CMHC1 sequences provides the first step in identifying minimal regulatory regions that confer developmental cardiac-specific gene expression. The addition of the −5205 to +260 region of the CMHC1 gene was sufficient to induce reporter gene expression in primary cardiomyocytes. This promoter region also induced reporter gene expression when transfected into primary skeletal myoblast cultures.2 Similar results were observed with the mouse cardiac troponin I (cTNI) gene. Whereas endogenous cTNI gene expression was restricted to cardiac muscle in vivo, reporter plasmids containing the cTNI promoter conferred high levels of gene expression in both cultured skeletal myoblasts and cardiomyocytes (26.Ausoni S. Campione M. Picard A. Moretti P. Vitadello M. De Nardi C. Schiaffino S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 339-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion analysis of the CMHC1 gene suggests the presence of two cardiac enhancer domains located at −2273 to −1372 and −711 to +263 and an inhibitory domain between −1372 and −711. Within the two positive-acting domains are located numerous DNA recognition sites associated with the expression of other cardiac genes. These include binding sites for GATA and MEF-2 factors, Nkx-2.5, and SRF. Cooperative combinatorial interactions between GATA-4, Nkx-2.5, and SRF have been shown to activate the transcription of the cardiac α-actin promoter in CV-1 fibroblasts (27.Sepulvada J.L. Belaguli N. Nigam V. Chen C.Y. Nemer M. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3405-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). This concentration of putative regulatory binding sites suggests the cardiac-restricted expression of CMHC1 during chicken embryogenesis may be controlled by clusters of sequences located within close proximity to the transcriptional start site. cTNI and CMHC1 are two of the few genes isolated to date that are expressed exclusively in cardiac muscle throughout embryonic development. Positive and negative regulatory regions of these two genes are remarkably similar. Like CMHC1, deletion analysis of 4.0 kb of upstream regulatory sequences of the mouse cTNI gene on cardiomyocytes identified two positive regulatory domains separated by a negative regulatory domain (26.Ausoni S. Campione M. Picard A. Moretti P. Vitadello M. De Nardi C. Schiaffino S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 339-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transgenic mice harboring sequences of the proximal regulatory domain (−230 to +126) of cTNI linked toLacZ conferred reporter gene expression to embryonic and adult hearts. Within this proximal sequence, MEF-2/Oct1, Sp1, and GATA regulatory sequences were all required for full expression in cultured cardiomyocytes (28.Di Lisi R. Millino C. Calabria E. Altruda F. Schiaffino S. Ausoni S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25371-25380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Whether CMHC1 and cTNI share conserved minimal sequences that are required for cardiac-specific gene expression during the initial stages of cardiac morphogenesis is not clear. Identification and isolation of the CMHC1 gene provides a potential new model system to study the molecular regulation of the initial stages of cardiac morphogenesis. In addition, cross-species experiments introducing the minimal CMHC1 promoter in transgenic mice may prove to be an effective method for cardiac-specific gene delivery. The promoters of various avian genes have recently been shown to direct reporter gene expression to specific regions of the developing mouse heart. One region of the chick GATA-6 promoter directed gene expression exclusively to the atrioventricular canal, whereas a larger fragment induced expression in the ventricle, outflow tract, and atrioventricular canal (29.He C-Z. Burch J.B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28550-28556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Transgene expression was detected solely in the developing atria of transgenic mice containing a reporter construct controlled by a region of the quail slow MHC3 containing a vitamin D response element (30.Xavier-Neto J. Neville C.M. Shapiro M.D. Houghton L. Wang G.F. Nikovits W. Stockdale F.E. Rosenthal N. Development. 1999; 126: 2677-2687PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, because of its early and cardiac restricted expression during chick development, the CMHC1 promoter may be an ideal candidate for directing high levels of transgene expression throughout the developing murine heart tube. Initial isolated genomic clones of CMHC1 have revealed a genomic structure that is unique to the myosin heavy chain gene family. Intron-exon boundaries of many cardiac MHC genes are conserved cross-species. However, initial genomic clones indicate the presence of unique intronic sequences in the CMHC1 gene. An exon in the CMHC1 gene, which is homologous to exon 15 of the human (31.Epp T.A. Dixon I.M. Wang H.Y. Sole M.J. Liew C.C. Genomics. 1993; 18: 505-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and hamster (32.Wang R. Sole M.J. Cukerman E. Liew C.C. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1994; 26: 1155-1165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) α-MHC genes and exon 16 of the chicken embryonic MHC gene, is interrupted by intronic sequences in the CMHC1 gene (data not shown). Furthermore, no other MHC genes isolated to date contain intronic insertions into this exon. The functional significance of this additional intron is unclear. However, additional variation of the CMHC1 gene organization, especially in the promoter region, may provide insight into the regulation of the highly restricted cardiac-specific gene expression of CMHC1."

Following solubilization of rough microsomes (RM) with digitonin, ribosomes co-sedimented in complexes containing the translocon proteins Sec61α, ribophorin I, and TRAPα, and endoplasmic reticulum phospholipids. Complexes of similar composition were identified in digitonin extracts of ribosome-free membranes, indicating that the ribosome does not define the composition of the digitonin-soluble translocon. Whereas in digitonin solution a highly electrostatic ribosome-translocon junction is observed, no stable interactions between ribosomes and Sec61α, ribophorin I, or TRAPα were observed following solubilization of RM with lipid-derived detergents at physiological salt concentrations. Sec61α was found to exist in at least two conformational states, as defined by mild proteolysis. A protease-resistant form was observed in RM and detergent-solubilized RM. Removal of peripheral proteins and ribosomes markedly enhanced the sensitivity of Sec61α to proteolysis, yet the readdition of inactive ribosomes to salt-washed membranes yielded only modest reductions in protease sensitivity. Addition of sublytic concentrations of detergents to salt-washed RM markedly decreased the protease sensitivity of Sec61α, indicating that a protease-resistant conformation of Sec61α can be conferred in a ribosome-independent manner.

A. 1966; 56: 608-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), an understanding of the mechanism of ribosome binding to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 membrane has been considered essential to the elucidation of the molecular mechanism of protein translocation. A theme consistent through the past decades of research into protein translocation has been the hypothesis that the membrane-bound ribosome performs regulatory functions that govern the structural and functional state of the translocon, the site of protein translocation in the ER (4.Blobel G.

Cell. 1997; 90: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In these models, the ribosome is thought to interact with protein components of the ER membrane and thereby initiate the assembly of a protein-conducting channel through which translocation proceeds (5.Blobel G.

Blobel G. Cell. 1991; 65: 371-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). In addition to a role in the regulation of channel assembly, the ribosome is also thought to regulate the structural state of the protein-conducting channel during the translocation event itself and in this manner assist the assembly of proteins of complex topologies, such as apolipoprotein B-100, the prion protein, and polytopic membrane proteins (9.Liao S. Lin J. Do H. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 12.Chuck S.L. Yao Z. Blackhart B.D. McCarthy B.J. Lingappa V.R.

Pruisner S.B. Myers R.M. Lingappa V.R. Science. 1990; 248: 226-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Diverse experimental approaches have provided evidence indicating a role for the ribosome in the regulation of translocon assembly. For example, following solubilization of rough microsomes (RM) with digitonin, ribosomes co-fractionate with Sec61α, the core component of the protein-conducting channel (6.Görlich D. Prehn S. Hartmann E. Kalies K.-U. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 489-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 15.Görlich D. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 615-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Furthermore, inactive ribosomes elicit Sec61p oligomerization in proteoliposomes comprising lipids and the purified Sec61p complex (7.Hanein D. Matlack K.E.S. Jungnickel B. Plath K. Kalies K.-U. Miller K.R. Rapoport T.A. Akey C.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 721-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In agreement with these observations, a direct physical interaction between inactive yeast ribosomes and yeast Sec61p was recently identified by cryo-electron microscopy (8.Beckmann R. Bubeck D. Grassucci R. Penczek P. Verschoor A. Blobel G. Frank J. Science. 1997; 278: 2123-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). It remains uncertain, however, whether the Sec61p-ribosome interactions identified in these studies are identical to the ribosome-membrane junction as characterized in vitro(8.Beckmann R. Bubeck D.

Current experimental evidence supports the identification of Sec61α as the ribosome receptor, although substantial literature exists regarding the identification of ribosome receptor proteins other than Sec61α (20.Borgese N.

Surprisingly, although significant disagreement regarding the identification and characterization of ribosome receptor proteins persists, there is near unanimity in the choice of assay system used for their discovery. In this assay, radiolabeled biosynthetically inactive ribosomes are incubated with ribosome-stripped microsomal vesicles and the bound and free fractions are separated by flotation centrifugation (20.Borgese N. Mok W. Kreibich G. Sabatini D.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 88: 559-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This assay identifies saturable and high affinity ribosome binding, although at physiological salt concentrations the observed ribosome binding stoichiometries are approximately 10% of those found in native membranes (20.Borgese N. Mok W. Kreibich G. Sabatini D.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 88: 559-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 28.Kalies K.U. Gorlich D. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 925-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). For this reason, it is uncertain whether the ribosome binding activity observed in this assay is identical to that present during ribosome/nascent chain targeting and translocation. In fact, the hypothesis that ER membrane components other than Sec61α contribute to ribosome binding was presented in a recent study demonstrating the binding of ribosomes bearing nascent secretory chains to sites on the ER membrane other than Sec61α (30.Murphy E.C.I. Zheng T. Nicchitta C.V. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1213-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We report that solubilization of RM with digitonin yields macromolecular complexes comprising ribosomes, a diverse population of integral membrane proteins, and phospholipids. Such complexes were also observed following solubilization of ribosome-free membranes, indicating that the ribosome is not required for complex stability in detergent solution. In contrast to the results seen with digitonin, solubilization of RM with lysophosphatidylcholine or 1,2-diheptanoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DHPC) yields monodisperse solutions of RM proteins that did not reside in stable association with ribosomes. In studies designed to assess the role of Sec61α in the regulation of ribosome interactions with the ER membrane, Sec61α was observed to exist in two conformational states. In native RM and detergent extracts of native RM, Sec61α assumed a protease-resistant conformation. Removal of bound ribosomes and peripheral proteins yielded a dramatic increase in the sensitivity of Sec61α to proteolysis; readdition of inactive ribosomes did not efficiently restore the protease-resistant conformation. However, the addition of sublytic concentrations of detergents to ribosome-depleted membranes markedly enhanced the resistance of Sec61α to proteolysis, indicating that Sec61α conformation can be regulated in a ribosome-independent manner. Digitonin was obtained from Wako Chemicals USA (Richmond, VA). DHPC was from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Puromycin and BigCHAP were obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). 5-(N-2,3-Dihydroxypropylacetamido)-2,4,6-triiodo-N,N′-bis(2,3-di- hydroxypropyl)-isophthalamide (Nycodenz), phosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, and dinitrophenol were obtained from Sigma. Chymotrypsin was from Worthington. Rabbit reticulocyte lysate was from Promega (Madison, WI). [35S]Pro-Mix ([35S]methionine/cysteine) was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Canine rough microsomes (RM), prepared as in Ref.31.Walter P. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, were stripped of ribosomes by treatment with EDTA and KOAc (EKRM), as described previously (30.Murphy E.C.I. Zheng T. Nicchitta C.V. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1213-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Alternatively, microsomes were stripped of ribosomes by treatment with puromycin and KOAc (PKRM) as described previously (6.Görlich D. Prehn S. Hartmann E. Kalies K.-U. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 489-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). To prepare ribosomes, rabbit reticulocyte lysate (200 μl) was centrifuged for 30 min at 80,000 rpm in a TLA100 rotor (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA) at 4 °C. The ribosomal pellet was resuspended in 130 μl of ribosome buffer (25 mmK-HEPES (pH 7.2), 50 mm KOAc, 5 mmMg(OAc)2, 1 mm DTT), loaded onto a 70-μl 0.5m sucrose cushion of similar ionic composition, and centrifuged as described above. Ribosomes were resuspended in ribosome buffer, and concentrations determined by UV spectrometry (1A 260 unit = 21.4 pmol of 80 S ribosomes; Ref. 32.Martin T.F. Rolleston F.S. Low R.B. Wool I.G. J.

Samples were incubated on ice 30 min, and ribosomes were pelleted by centrifugation for 30 min at 80,000 rpm in a TLA100 rotor at 4 °C (247,000 ×g at r av; k factor = 10). Supernatant fractions were precipitated by addition of trichloroacetic acid to 10%, incubation on ice for 20 min, and centrifugation for 15 min at 15,000 rpm in a refrigerated microcentrifuge. Pellets and precipitated supernatants were then processed for SDS-PAGE. SDS-PAGE gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a semidry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad) and a transfer buffer consisting of 50 mm CAPS (pH 11.0), 20% methanol, and 0.075% SDS. Immunoblots were visualized using SuperSignal detection reagents (Pierce), and images were quantified using NIH Image software. Velocity sedimentation studies of ribosome-associated membrane proteins were performed by the following procedure; 30 eq of RM were suspended in buffer containing 20 mm detergent, 25 mmK-HEPES (pH 7.2), 150 mm KOAc, 5 mmMg(OAc)2, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm PMSF in a final volume of 600 μl. Samples were incubated on ice for 30 min, and then loaded onto 10-ml 10–30% sucrose gradients containing 25 mm K-HEPES (pH 7.2), 150 mm KOAc, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1% detergent. Gradients were centrifuged for 2 h at 40,000 rpm in an SW40 rotor (Beckman) at 4 °C. Gradients were manually fractionated by puncturing the tube bottoms, and fractions were precipitated by addition of trichloroacetic acid to 10%. Samples were then processed for immunoblot analysis as described above. To study interactions between detergent-solubilized membrane proteins, the following modifications were made; following solubilization of RM or ribosome-stripped membranes, samples were centrifuged at 80,000 rpm for 30 min in a TLA100.2 rotor at 4 °C (228,000 × g atr av; k factor = 18). Supernatants were then loaded onto 10-ml 5–20% sucrose cushions containing 25 mm K-HEPES (pH 7.2), 150 mm KOAc, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1% detergent. Gradients were centrifuged for 24 h at 40,000 rpm in an SW40 rotor at 4 °C and processed as described above. To study the association of bulk ER lipids with ribosomes, samples were solubilized and fractionated through 10–30% sucrose gradients as described above. The ribosome-enriched fractions were pooled and diluted 4-fold with 25 mm K-HEPES (pH 7.2), 150 mm KOAc, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, and 1 mm DTT. Ribosomes were pelleted by centrifugation for 4.5 h at 45,000 rpm in a Ti50.2 rotor (Beckman) at 4 °C. Ribosomes were then resuspended in ribosome buffer, and ribosome-associated lipids were extracted and analyzed as described below. 1000 eq of RM were pelleted and resuspended in 3 ml of 25 mm K-HEPES (pH 7.2), 150 mm KOAc, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 10% glycerol, and DHPC yielding a detergent:RM ratio of approximately 400:1 (nanomoles of detergent:eq of RM). Samples were incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged for 30 min at 80,000 rpm in the TLA100.2 rotor at 4 °C. Supernatant samples were adjusted to 600 mm KOAc and mixed with SM-2 Biobeads (Bio-Rad) that had been pre-equilibrated with 25 mm K-HEPES (pH 7.2), 600 mm KOAc, and 10% glycerol. Samples were incubated with shaking overnight at 4 °C. The fluid phase was then removed from the beads, and the reconstituted vesicles were pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 60,000 rpm in a TLA100.2 rotor at 4 °C. Vesicles were resuspended in 0.25 m sucrose, 25 mm K-HEPES (pH 7.2), 50 mm KOAc, and 1 mm DTT and stored at −80 °C. The amounts of membrane proteins present in the vesicles, relative to RM, were determined by immunoblotting of serial dilutions of reconstituted vesicles and RM. To analyze the binding of ribosomes to reconstituted vesicles, 2 pmol of purified ribosomes were combined with increasing quantities of vesicles in 50 μl of buffer consisting of 25 mm K-HEPES (pH 7.2), 150 mm KOAc, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm PMSF. Samples were incubated on ice for 30 min, and Nycodenz was then added to a final concentration of 45%, to yield a final volume of 1 ml while maintaining constant ionic conditions. The 45% Nycodenz-ribosome binding reaction was overlaid with 600 μl of 37.5% Nycodenz, 400 μl of 30% Nycodenz and 100 μl of 0% Nycodenz, all in 25 mm K-HEPES (pH 7.2), 150 mmKOAc, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2. Samples were centrifuged for 3 h at 55,000 rpm in an SW55 rotor (Beckman) at 4 °C. The upper 600 μl of the step gradients, which contained the floated vesicles, was collected and precipitated by addition of trichloroacetic acid to 10%. Samples were processed for SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis as described above. Membranes were left untreated or solubilized with digitonin or DHPC as described above, and chymotrypsin was added to the concentrations indicated in the figures. Digestions were performed for 30 min on ice, after which time trichloroacetic acid was added to 10%. Samples were collected by centrifugation and processed for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. When SDS was used to solubilize membranes, the above procedures were carried out at 37 °C to avoid precipitation of the SDS. In experiments involving ribosome binding to membranes prior to proteolysis, 10 pmol of ribosomes were incubated with 2 eq of PKRM for 30 min at 4 °C in buffer containing 150 mm KOAc, 25 mm K-HEPES (pH 7.2), 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, and 1 mm DTT. 2 pmol of ribosomes, derived from either reticulocyte lysate or RM solubilized with 20 mm DHPC, were added to 8 μl of a rabbit reticulocyte lysate post-ribosomal supernatant supplemented with 500 ng preprolactin mRNA, 16 μCi of [35S]Pro-Mix, 0.05 unit/ml RNasin, 1 mm DTT, and 20 μm amino acid mix (minus methionine) in a total volume of 20 μl. Following incubation for the indicated time periods at 25 °C, 5 μl of the translation reaction was spotted onto filter paper and protein synthesis levels were measured as described previously (33.Mans R.J. Novelli G.D. Arch. Bioch. Biophys. 1961; 94: 48-53Crossref Scopus (1515) Google Scholar). Samples were mixed with 4 volumes of a mixture of methanol/chloroform/HCl (100:50:1). After extraction at room temperature for 20 min, phase separation was induced by addition of 1.3 volumes each of chloroform and 2 m KCl. Samples were centrifuged for 2 min at 13,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge. The upper aqueous phase was removed, and the lower organic phase was washed twice with a mixture of methanol/water/HCl (50:50:1). The organic phase was reduced to dryness by vacuum centrifugation and resuspended in chloroform/methanol (2:1). Bulk ER lipids were resolved on silica thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates using a solvent system of chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (100:30:35:3) and were visualized by staining with iodine vapor. Anti-peptide rabbit polyclonal antisera against Sec61α and β, TRAPα and β, ribophorin I, and signal peptidase, as well as chicken antisera (IgY) directed against ribosomal proteins L3/L4, were used at 1:1500 dilution, as described previously (30.Murphy E.C.I. Zheng T. Nicchitta C.V. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1213-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Following transfer to nitrocellulose, membranes were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat milk and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. Primary incubations were performed for 1 h at room temperature in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% nonfat milk and 0.1% Tween 20, and secondary incubations performed for 30 min in the identical buffer using the appropriate secondary antibodies at 1:3000 dilution. To investigate the role of membrane-bound ribosomes in the regulation of translocon composition, native RM were solubilized with either digitonin or DHPC, and ribosome-associated membrane components were resolved by sedimentation of the detergent-soluble fraction on sucrose gradients. The selection of detergents was based on published studies identifying either ribosome-membrane protein complexes (digitonin; Ref. 6.Görlich D. Prehn S. Hartmann E. Kalies K.-U. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 489-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) or high recovery of native protein structure and activity (DHPC; Ref. 34.Kessi J. Poiree J.-C. Wehrli E. Bachofen R. Semenza G. Hauser H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10825-10836Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). As depicted in Fig.1 (A and C), when RM were solubilized with digitonin, the ribosome fraction sediments as a heterogeneous fraction containing Sec61α, ribophorin I, TRAPα, and ER phospholipids. Quantitation of the ribosome-associated lipid fraction by chemical phosphate analysis indicated that phospholipids were present at approximately a 50-fold molar excess to ribosomes (data not shown). When RM were solubilized with DHPC, none of the assayed membrane components (Sec61α, ribophorin I, TRAPα, TRAM, or signal peptidase complex) co-sedimented with ribosomes (Fig. 1 B). In addition, although phospholipids could be identified with the DHPC-solubilized ribosomes (Fig. 1 C), the quantities of ribosome-associated phospholipids were approximately 2% of that seen with digitonin-soluble ribosomes. The data presented in Fig. 1 indicated that, when RM were solubilized with digitonin, membrane-bound ribosomes sedimented in association with a large, heterogeneous complex of integral membrane proteins and phospholipids. When RM were solubilized with DHPC, however, stable ribosome-membrane protein interactions were not detected. To further investigate these differences, RM were stripped of bound ribosomes in puromycin/high salt buffers (6.Görlich D. Prehn S. Hartmann E. Kalies K.-U. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 489-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) and experiments similar to those depicted in Fig. 1 were performed (Fig.2). In the absence of bound ribosomes, the digitonin-soluble membrane proteins would be predicted to sediment with a considerably smaller sedimentation coefficient than that depicted in Fig. 1. Thus, to adequately resolve the detergent-soluble protein fraction derived from ribosome-free membranes, the detergent extracts were centrifuged on sucrose gradients for extended time periods. As shown in Fig. 2 A, when ribosome-free membranes were solubilized with digitonin, Sec61α, ribophorin I, and TRAPα were again observed to migrate as a complex. Analysis of the total protein composition of these fractions indicated that the digitonin-soluble translocon complex was heterogeneous and consisted of at least 20 silver stain-reactive polypeptides (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, when RM were solubilized with DHPC, Sec61α, ribophorin I, and TRAPα exhibited overlapping, but non-identical sedimentation profiles (Fig. 2 C). From these experiments, it can be concluded that the isolation of digitonin-soluble translocon complexes does not require bound ribosomes. Furthermore, when RM were solubilized with DHPC, the integral membrane protein components of the ER behaved in a monodisperse manner and no stable membrane protein-ribosome interactions were observed. In current views, ribosome binding to the ER membrane is maintained primarily through interactions with Sec61α (7.Hanein D. Matlack K.E.S. Jungnickel B. Plath K. Kalies K.-U. Miller K.R. Rapoport T.A. Akey C.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 721-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 28.Kalies K.U. Gorlich D. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 925-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The data depicted in Figs. 1 and 2 support this view, although the molecular heterogeneity of the digitonin-soluble translocon complexes, as seen in both the presence and absence of bound ribosomes, prevents unequivocal identification of Sec61α as the ribosome receptor. Alternatively, the results obtained with DHPC can be interpreted to indicate that neither Sec61α, ribophorin I, nor TRAPα alone constitute the primary site of ribosome-membrane interaction. To reconcile these conflicting interpretations, additional experiments were performed to critically assess the significance of the DHPC data and to further evaluate ribosome-Sec61α interactions. DHPC is well documented to solubilize a diverse array of integral membrane proteins while maintaining both native structure and enzymatic activity (34.Kessi J. Poiree J.-C. Wehrli E. Bachofen R. Semenza G. Hauser H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10825-10836Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 35.Shivanna B.D. Rowe E.S. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 533-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the inability to detect stable translocon protein-ribosome interactions in DHPC solution could result from DHPC-induced disruptions in the structural integrity of ER oligomeric protein complexes, inactivation of ribosome binding activity, and/or DHPC-induced structural perturbations in the ribosome itself. To determine whether the inability to detect ribosome-membrane protein interactions in DHPC solution was a consequence of general disruptions in oligomeric protein integrity, the DHPC-soluble fraction from RM was fractionated by velocity sedimentation and the oligomeric structure of the Sec61, TRAP, and signal peptidase complexes determined. As shown in Fig.3, the α and β subunits of Sec61 undergo partial dissociation in DHPC solution, whereas other membrane protein complexes, such as the TRAP and signal peptidase complexes, remain wholly intact. From these data, it can be concluded that DHPC does not elicit a general disruption of oligomeric membrane protein complexes. Furthermore, because it has been demonstrated that the α and β subunits of Sec61 readily dissociate in detergent solution and that the β subunit of Sec61 is not required for ribosome binding (36.Kalies K.U. Rapoport T.A. Hartmann E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), the partial dissociation of the α and β subunits of Sec61 observed in DHPC solution does not provide a convincing explanation for the lack of stable membrane protein-ribosome interactions in DHPC-solubilized membranes. The ribosome-Sec61α interaction, as assayed in digitonin solution, is highly electrostatic and is stable at salt concentrations approaching 1m (6.Görlich D. Prehn S. Hartmann E. Kalies K.-U. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 489-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, when native RM were solubilized in digitonin at 0.5 m salt and centrifuged, Sec61α was recovered in the ribosom"

Both APP isoforms differ in regard to functional properties like post-translational modification, APP secretion, and proteolytic production of Aβ peptide from APP molecules. Since Aβ generation is an important factor in the development of Alzheimer's disease, one could anticipate that these major APP isoforms might contribute differentially to the mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we established an APP minigene system in a murine cell system to identifycis-acting elements controlling exon 15 recognition. A 12.5-kilobase pair genomic fragment of the murine APP gene contained all cis-regulatory elements to reproduce the splicing pattern of the endogenous APP transcripts. By using this approach, two intronic cis-elements flanking exon 15 were identified that block the inclusion of exon 15 in APP transcripts of non-neuronal cells. Point mutation analysis of these intronic regions indicated that pyrimidine-rich sequences are involved in the splice repressor function.

These amyloid deposits are mainly composed of a short, highly hydrophobic peptide (40–42 amino acid residues) termed Aβ (1.Glenner G.G. Wong C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Aβ is derived by proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP),1 which is expressed abundantly in almost every cell type including neurons (3.Dyrks T. Weidemann A. Multhaup G.

Chem. 1992; 267: 10804-10809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) generating eight different isoforms of a type I transmembrane glycoprotein ranging in length from 677 to 770 amino acids. Alternative splicing of APP exon 15 was first discovered in peripheral mononuclear leukocytes and activated microglial cells (10.König G. Monning U. Czech C. Prior R. Banati R. Schreiter-Gasser U. Bauer J. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10804-10809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, isoforms lacking exon 15 were denoted as leukocyte-derived APP (L-APP). Detailed expression studies revealed a ubiquitous distribution of L-APP transcripts in rat tissues (11.Sandbrink R. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1510-1517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In peripheral tissues L-APP mRNA molecules constitute between 25 and 72% of total APP transcripts. In contrast, the expression levels of L-APP in the central nervous system, including hippocampus, cerebellum, and cerebral cortex, is low (<10%), and no significant L-APP amounts were detected in cultured primary rat neurons. These findings suggested that exon 15 is recognized by a cell type-specific mechanism in rat. Exclusion of 18 amino acids encoded by exon 15 has important consequences for the functional properties of the corresponding APP isoforms. Fusion of exon 14 with exon 16 creates a new post-translational modification motif ENEGSG. This motif is recognized by xylosyltransferase that attaches a chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan chain via xylose to the serine residue of the ENEGSG sequence. Chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan chain-modified L-APP is denoted as appican (12.Pangalos M.N. Efthimiopoulos S. Shioi J. Robakis N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10388-10391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 13.Pangalos M.N. Shioi J. Robakis N.K. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 762-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The biological function of appican is not known, but it may be similar to the function of other chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans in biological processes as wound healing, cell adhesion, neurite outgrowth, and axon guidance (14.Okamoto M. Mori S. Endo H. Brain Res. 1994; 637: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 15.Brittis P.A. Canning D.R. Silver J.

Evidence for appican function in mediating cell adhesion came from expression studies on appican in rat C6 glioma cells. Appican-expressing cells attach more avidly to substrate surface than untransfected cells (17.Wu A. Pangalos M.N. Efthimiopoulos S. Shioi J. Robakis N.K. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4987-4993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In former cells appican is enriched in the extracellular matrix and displays adhesion-promoting properties for neuronal cells (17.Wu A. Pangalos M.N. Efthimiopoulos S. Shioi J. Robakis N.K. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4987-4993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, alternative splicing of exon 15 regulates the basolateral and apical secretion of APP and L-APP isoforms in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney II cells by either creating a new apical or destroying a basolateral sorting signal in L-APP molecules, respectively (18.Hartmann T. Bergsdorf C. Sandbrink R. Tienari P.J. Multhaup G. Ida N. Bieger S. Dyrks T. Weidemann A. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13208-13214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In context of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis it is relevant that exclusion of the region encoded by exon 15 from the mature APP also affects its processing to the Aβ peptide by decreasing the relative amount of generated Aβ (18.Hartmann T. Bergsdorf C. Sandbrink R. Tienari P.J. Multhaup G. Ida N. Bieger S. Dyrks T. Weidemann A. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13208-13214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In order to get some insight into the splicing regulation of exon 15, in the present study we performed a molecular analysis of this splicing process. We demonstrate that the cell type-specific recognition of exon 15 in non-neuronal and neuronal cells is conserved between mouse and rat. To characterize the regulatory requirements for the cell type-specific usage of exon 15, an APP minigene expression system was established in murine cell lines NIH3T3 and P19. By using this approach we were able to identify two intronic regions flanking exon 15, which we refer to as “upstream control region” (UCR) and “downstream control region” (DCR). Finally, we present evidence that both intronic regions play a key role for the cell type-specific exclusion of exon 15 in APP mRNA molecules in non-neuronal cells. All tissues were prepared from 2- to 3-month-old female NMRI mice, provided by the animal facility of Center for Molecular Biology, Heidelberg, Germany. The animals were killed by cervical dislocation, and the tissues were immediately removed, washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. The following murine cell lines NIH3T3, P19, N2a, and AtT20 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma and Boehringer Ingelheim) as adherent monolayers on 10-cm tissue culture dishes at 37 °C under 5% CO2 atmosphere. The genomic APP clone L12 (Fig.2 A) was isolated from a Lambda Fix II 129 SVJ mouse genomic library (Stratagene) using an α-32P-labeled human APP cDNA probe encoding exons 14–17. All clones were created by using standard methods (19.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For cloning the APP minigene MG1, two DNA fragments of the genomic APP clone L12 were used (Fig. 2 A) as follows: fragment I, SacI site of exon 14 toXbaI site of intron 14 (∼5.5 kb), and fragment II,XbaI site of intron 14 to EcoRI site of exon 16 (∼6.9 kb) (Fig. 2 A). The recipient vector pSKE1416X for fragment I and II was created by inserting a mouse APP cDNA fragment (exons 14–16) that was amplified by PCR using the primer pair sE14EcoRV (5′-ACGATTGATATCATGAGCTGCTTCAGAAGGAGC-3′) and aE16XhoI (5′-AGCACCCTCGAGCAGTTTTTGATGGCGGACTTC-5′; boldface nucleotides indicate restriction sites) in the EcoRV andXhoI site of a Bluescript (SK+) plasmid. Finally, anXbaI polylinker was introduced between the SacI (exon 14) and EcoRI (exon 16) sites of the APP cDNA fragment. Fragment II was introduced into the EcoRI andXbaI site of pSKE1416X generating the pSK1516X plasmid. Afterward fragment I was inserted into SacI andXbaI site of pSK1516X producing the APP minigene pSKMG1. TheEcoRV/XhoI fragment of pSKMG1 was inserted into the ScaI/XhoI site of the mammalian expression vector pZeoSV (Invitrogen) generating the APP minigene MG1. All cloning steps were controlled by DNA sequencing. MG2 was constructed by deleting a 2.8-kb NcoI DNA fragment from pSK1516X, followed by a religation and exchanging the wild typeXbaI/XhoI fragment of MG1 against the shortened one of pSK1516X. Deletions constructs A1 to A6 and B1 to B8 were generated by PCR cloning, amplifying 5′- or 3′-truncatedPacI/AflII fragments (Figs. 4 and 5). Minigene constructs ΔUCR, ΔDCR, dUCR, dDCR, UCR1, DCR1, RCU, RCD, M2, and PM34.1 were produced by using a recombinant PCR approach. MutagenizedPacI/AflII fragments of the genomic APP region were inserted in the parental APP minigene MG2. Point mutations PM13, PM14, PM15, PM23, PM25, PM26, and PM35 were introduced in thePacI/AflII fragment of MG2 by a modified protocol of the megaprimer PCR method (20.Seraphin B. Kandels-Lewis S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3276-3277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Instead of Taq DNA polymerase we used Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene), and therefore no Klenow treatment of newly synthesized megaprimer was necessary. All introduced mutations were confirmed by sequencing. MG4 was generated by PCR using the primer pair sxE15EcoRV (5′-ACGATTGATATCGTGAATGCGTCTGTTCCA-3′), axE17XhoI (5′-AGCACCCTCGAGTCAGGGTCGTTCCTCCAG-3′; bold-face nucleotides mark restriction sites), and a human genomic DNA preparation as template. The PCR product was inserted into theScaI/XhoI sites of the pZeoSV vector. E16Δ90 was produced by deleting a 90-bp DNA fragment in exon 16 of MG4 by recombinant PCR. For creating the chimeric constructs C1 and C2, the genomic APP DNA fragments shown in Fig. 8 A were fused by recombinant PCR to construct E16Δ90. Detailed PCR strategies and oligonucleotide sequences are available on request.Figure 5Identification of the “downstream control region.” A, left panel, structure of the wild type and the truncated minigenes.

One 10-cm dish of 15% confluent cells was transfected with 10 μg of plasmid DNA. Each transfection was performed at duplication. 48 h after transfection cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested. The total RNA was isolated by using RNeasy columns (Qiagen) or High Pure total RNA Isolation columns (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In general for first-strand cDNA synthesis 2 μg of total RNA preparations were reverse-transcribed with 200 units of SuperScriptTM (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 50 pmol of oligo(dT)17 in a total reaction volume of 20 μl under the conditions provided by the manufacturer's protocol. To verify the endogenous APP mRNA splicing pattern, a PCR reaction with the primer pair sm1805 (5′-AGGAGATTCAAGATGAAGTCG-3′, last 21 nt of exon 13) and am2225 (5′-CCCACATCTTCAGCAAAGAAC-3′, first 21 nt of exon 17) was performed. To measure the level of minigene-derived mRNA isoforms, the primer pair spZEO1 (5′-AGCTATTCCAGAAGTAGTGAG-3′) and apZEO2 (5′-GACACTATAGAACAGCTGATC-3′) was used, recognizing unique sequences in the pZeoSV vector. In a standard quantitative PCR reaction one-hundredth of a cDNA preparation was amplified in a Perkin-Elmer thermocycler 9600 using the following reaction conditions: 200 nm sense primer, 50 nm33P-end-labeled and 150 nm unlabeled antisense primer, 0.2 mm dNTP, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) with the supplied PCR buffer in a final reaction volume of 50 μl. Since pilot experiments showed that the PCR amplification rates of the endogenous APP transcripts and of the minigene-derived APP transcripts were linear between the 22nd and 28th cycle, we used the following cycle parameters in our quantitative RT-PCR assay: 94 °C 10 s, 60 °C 15 s, 72 °C 40 s for 24 cycles (endogenous APPex15/L-APP) and 26 cycles (MG-APPex15/MG-L-APP) plus a final extension of 7 min at 72 °C. Since the signals for MG-L-APP PCR product were very weak in the P19 cells, one-twenty-fifth of a cDNA preparation was amplified with spZEO1 and apZEO2 (pilot experiments showed that the amount of cDNA template did not change the ratio of both PCR products). Generated PCR products were separated electrophoretically on a 6% denaturing urea-polyacrylamide gel, and the dried gels were exposed to x-ray films (Kodak X-Omat AR) at room temperature between 2 days and 2 weeks. The amount of incorporated radioactivity was determined for each band by using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and the quant modus of the computer program Mac BAS 1.0. For quantification each band was corrected by a corresponding background value, and the relative amount of both isoforms with (APPex15) and without exon 15 (L-APP) was calculated to total APP (L-APP +APPex15). A previous report on the APP expression established the ubiquitous distribution of L-APP in rat tissues with the exception of primary cultured neurons (11.Sandbrink R. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1510-1517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since in the present study we used the mouse system to identify cis-acting elements involved in the splicing regulation of exon 15, we first examined the expression pattern of exon 15-containing (APPex15) and lacking (L-APP) APP mRNA isoforms in a number of organs of three adult female mice. To assay the relative amounts of APPex15 and L-APP in these murine tissues, cDNA was prepared and served as a template in a radioactive PCR using a primer pair flanking exon 15 (Fig.1 A). After separation of the radioactively labeled PCR products by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, two major bands of 420 and 366 bp were visible in the autoradiogram (Fig. 1 B), corresponding to APPex15 and L-APP, respectively. The identity of these bands was confirmed by comparison with the mobility of DNA fragments amplified from corresponding plasmid standards and sequencing (data not shown). APPex15 and L-APP were present in all tested tissues (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1–14). A quantitative determination of the relative L-APP amounts by phosphorimaging revealed that the relative L-APP portions in the non-neuronal tissues varied between 45% (adrenal gland) and 65% (lung) with the mean value of 55% (TableI). In contrast, the relative intensities of the L-APP bands in cDNA preparations from cerebellum or cortex were markedly weaker (Fig. 1 B, lanes 13 and14; Table I) consisting of 7 or 8%, respectively, and suggesting a predominant production of APPex15 isoforms in the central nervous system. To clarify which cell types in the central nervous system contribute to L-APP production, primary cultures of embryonic mouse neurons (embryonal day 11) and primary cultures of microglial cells derived from newborn mice were cultured, and the relative APPex15 and L-APP amounts were measured by the quantitative RT-PCR assay described above. As shown in Fig.1 C, murine primary neurons do not synthesize detectable amounts of L-APP, whereas in microglial cells both APPex15and L-APP are expressed, the latter accounting for more than a half of the total APP mRNA (Table I; Fig. 1 C, comparelanes 16 and 17). Thus, L-APP is produced in murine brain exclusively by cells of non-neuronal origin, and skipping of exon 15 appears to be a very rare event during post-transcriptional processing of APP pre-mRNA transcripts in neurons. These results are consistent with the data reported by Sandbrink et al.(11.Sandbrink R. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1510-1517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for rat tissues and suggest that exon 15 splicing is regulated in a cell type-specific manner.Table IQuantification of APP ex15 and L-APP mRNA isoforms in peripheral tissues, neuronal tissues, primary cultured brain cells, and cell lines of mouseSampleL-APPAPPexp15No. of samples%Non-neuronal tissue Gullet47 ± 153 ± 13 Lung65 ± 235 ± 22 Heart61 ± 139 ± 12 Thymus57 ± 543 ± 52 Adrenal gland45 ± 1155 ± 113 Kidney50 ± 550 ± 52 Spleen64 ± 236 ± 23 Liver57 ± 543 ± 52 Stomach53 ± 347 ± 33 Small intestine50 ± 350 ± 33 Rectum53 ± 347 ± 33 Ovary51 ± 249 ± 23Neuronal tissue Cerebellum8 ± 292 ± 23 Cortex7 ± 293 ± 22Primary cultured brain cells Primary neurons<1>997 Primary microglia61 ± 739 ± 714Cell lines NIH3T357 ± 443 ± 410 AtT2014 ± 186 ± 13 N2a5 ± 295 ± 213 P191 ± 199 ± 16Radiolabeled RT-PCR products were analyzed by using a PhosphorImager. Each band was corrected by a corresponding background value. Relative amounts of both mRNA isoforms were determined in percent using the following calculations: %L-APP = (APPex15 + L-APP)/100 × L-APP; %APPex15 = (APPex15 + L-APP)/100 × APPex15.

By using our quantitative RT-PCR assays, we next searched for a murine cell culture model that mimics the in vivo non-neuronal and neuronal L-APP expression pattern. For this, we chose the following murine cell lines: NIH3T3 (fibroblastoma), AtT20 (pituitary gland), N2a (neuroblastoma), and P19 (embryonic carcinoma). Analysis of the APP splicing pattern by phosphorimaging revealed that APPex15isoforms were expressed by all cell lines tested and constituted between 43 (NIH3T3) and 99% (P19) of the total APP message (Fig.1 D, lanes 19–22; Table I). Conversely, L-APP constituted 14 or 57% in the non-neuronal cell lines AtT20 or NIH3T3, respectively, whereas only minor amounts of these APP isoforms were expressed in the two cell lines N2a (<5%) and P19 (<1%). Thus, the P19 cell line appeared to be most suitable for studying exon 15 splicing in a neuronal context since the very low or absent L-APP expression is a characteristic feature of neurons. The NIH3T3 cell line was chosen for the following experiments as representative for cells with the non-neuronal L-APP splicing pattern. To examine the regulation of the alternative splicing of APP exon 15 in more detail, a minigene construct encompassing the exons 14–16 of the murine APP gene was generated. For this, a mouse genomic library was screened with a fragment of the human APP cDNA (exons 14–17). A hybridizing λ clone termed L12 contained a genomic fragment of ∼18 kb including the exons 14–17 of the murine APP gene (Fig.2 A). Sincecis-acting elements involved in the regulation of alternative splicing are often located in intronic sequences proximal to an alternatively used exon or in regions of upstream and downstream exons of neighboring sequences (21.Lou H.

RNA (NY). 1996; 2: 682-698PubMed Google Scholar), the genomic regions adjacent to exons 14–16 were determined and compared with the corresponding regions in the human APP gene (Fig. 2 B). The sequence alignment revealed a high degree of conservation in the intronic areas upstream and downstream of exon 15 (80 or 60% similarity, respectively), suggesting the presence of functionally important regulatory cis-elements. To generate an APP minigene vector a 12.5-kb fragment spanning exons 14–16 was inserted into the multiple cloning site of the mammalian expression vector pZeoSV as described under “Materials and Methods” (Fig. 2 A). To examine whether the minigene-derived mRNA can be efficiently expressed in cells and whether the minigene-encoded exon 15 undergoes alternative splicing, the APP minigene MG1 was ectopically expressed in NIH3T3 (non-neuronal splicing system) and P19 cells (neuronal splicing system). The minigene splicing pattern was monitored by a quantitative RT-PCR assay, using vector-specific primers in a PCR reaction with 26 cycles (Fig. 2 A). Concomitantly, the endogenously produced APP transcripts were detected by using the quantitative RT-PCR assay described in Fig. 1 A. By using both primer pairs in two separate RT-PCRs, we thus were able to monitor and discriminate between the endogenously and the ectopically expressed APP isoforms. As shown in Fig.3 A, in addition to the endogenous APP mRNA fragments, two minigene-derived splice products were visible as bands of 447 and 501 bp, and these bands were not present in cDNA preparations from “mock”-transfected control cells (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1 and 4 versus 3 and 6). In analogy to the APP mRNA isoforms generated from the endogenous APP gene, we refer to the 447-bp fragment as MG-L-APP (minigene-derived APP mRNA isoforms without exon 15) and to the 501-bp fragment as MG-APPex15 (minigene-derived APP mRNA isoforms with exon 15). The identity of the bands representing MG-L-APP and MG-APPex15 was confirmed by comparison of their electrophoretical mobilities with those of corresponding bands derived by PCR amplification of a plasmid standard (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1 and 4 versus 7) and by sequencing (data not shown). A quantitative analysis of the minigene-derived PCR products demonstrated that exon 15 inclusion occurred to 41 ± 3% (n = 11) in NIH3T3 cells and to 86 ± 5% (n = 11) in P19 cells (Fig.3 B). The ectopic expression of the APP minigene did not influence the processing of the endo"
