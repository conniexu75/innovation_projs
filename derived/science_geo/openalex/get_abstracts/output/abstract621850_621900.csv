https://openalex.org/W2781725908,"Dendrites integrate inputs nonlinearly, but it is unclear how these nonlinearities contribute to the overall input-output transformation of single neurons. We developed statistically principled methods using a hierarchical cascade of linear-nonlinear subunits (hLN) to model the dynamically evolving somatic response of neurons receiving complex, in vivo-like spatiotemporal synaptic input patterns. We used the hLN to predict the somatic membrane potential of an in vivo-validated detailed biophysical model of a L2/3 pyramidal cell. Linear input integration with a single global dendritic nonlinearity achieved above 90% prediction accuracy. A novel hLN motif, input multiplexing into parallel processing channels, could improve predictions as much as conventionally used additional layers of local nonlinearities. We obtained similar results in two other cell types. This approach provides a data-driven characterization of a key component of cortical circuit computations: the input-output transformation of neurons during in vivo-like conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2899557501,"Being able to noninvasively modulate brain activity, where and when an experimenter desires, with an immediate path toward human translation is a long-standing goal for neuroscience. To enable robust perturbation of brain activity while leveraging the ability of focused ultrasound to deliver energy to any point of the brain noninvasively, we have developed biocompatible and clinically translatable nanoparticles that allow ultrasound-induced uncaging of neuromodulatory drugs. Utilizing the anesthetic propofol, together with electrophysiological and imaging assays, we show that the neuromodulatory effect of ultrasonic drug uncaging is limited spatially and temporally by the size of the ultrasound focus, the sonication timing, and the pharmacokinetics of the uncaged drug. Moreover, we see secondary effects in brain regions anatomically distinct from and functionally connected to the sonicated region, indicating that ultrasonic drug uncaging could noninvasively map the changes in functional network connectivity associated with pharmacologic action at a particular brain target."
https://openalex.org/W2900028291,"Background and aims Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) is a commonly diagnosed disorder of Eustachian tube opening and closure, which may be associated with severe symptoms and middle ear disease. Currently the diagnosis of obstructive and patulous forms of ETD is primarily based on non-specific symptoms or examination findings, rather than measurement of the underlying function of the Eustachian tube. This has proved problematic when selecting patients for treatment, and when designing trial inclusion criteria and outcomes. This study aims to determine the correlation and diagnostic value of various tests of ET opening and patient reported outcome measures (PROMs), in order to generate a recommended diagnostic pathway for ETD. Methods Index tests included two PROMs and 14 tests of ET opening (nine for obstructive, five for patulous ETD). In the absence of an accepted reference standard two methods were adopted to establish index test accuracy: expert panel diagnosis and latent class analysis. Index test results were assessed with Pearson correlation and principle component analysis, and test accuracy was determined. Logistic regression models assessed the predictive value of grouped test results. Results The expert panel diagnosis and PROMs results correlated with each other, but not with ET function measured by tests of ET opening. All index tests were found to be feasible in clinic, and acceptable to patients. PROMs had very poor specificity, and no diagnostic value. Combining the results of tests of ET function appeared beneficial. The latent class model suggested tympanometry, sonotubometry and tubomanometry have the best diagnostic performance for obstructive ETD, and these are included in a proposed diagnostic pathway. Conclusions ETD should be diagnosed on the basis of clinical assessment and tests of ET opening, as PROMs have no diagnostic value. Currently diagnostic uncertainty exists for some patients who appear to have intermittent ETD clinically, but have negative index test results."
https://openalex.org/W2900062640,"Computed tomography (CT) is the standard imaging test used for the screening and assessment of suspected lung cancer, but distinguishing malignant from benign nodules by CT is an ongoing challenge. Consequently, a large number of avoidable invasive procedures are performed on patients with benign nodules in order to exclude malignancy. Improving cancer discrimination by non-invasive imaging could reduce the need for invasive diagnostics. In this work we focus on developing a gold nanoparticle contrast agent that targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is expressed on the cell surface of most lung adenocarcinomas. Three different contrast agents were compared for their tumor targeting effectiveness: non-targeted nanoparticles, nanoparticles conjugated with full-sized anti-EGFR antibodies (cetuximab), and nanoparticles conjugated with a single-domain llama-derived anti-EGFR antibody, which is smaller than the cetuximab, but has a lower binding affinity. Nanoparticle targeting effectiveness was evaluated in vitro by EGFR-binding assays and in cell culture with A431 cells, which highly express EGFR. In vivo CT imaging performance was evaluated in both C57BL/6 mice and in nude mice with A431 subcutaneous tumors. The cetuximab nanoparticles had a significantly shorter blood residence time than either the non-targeted or the single-domain antibody nanoparticles. All of the nanoparticle contrast agents demonstrated tumor accumulation; however, the cetuximab-targeted group had significantly higher tumor gold accumulation than the other two groups, which were statistically indistinguishable from one another. In this study we found that the relative binding affinity of the targeting ligands had more of an effect on tumor accumulation than the circulation half life of the nanoparticles. This study provides useful insight into targeted nanoparticle design and demonstrates that nanoparticle contrast agents can be used to detect tumor receptor overexpression. Combining receptor status data with traditional imaging characteristics has the potential for better differentiation of malignant lung tumors from benign lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2900132127,"Thrombotic manifestations are a hallmark of many auto-immune diseases (AID), specially of warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (wAIHA), as 15 to 33% of adults with wAIHA experience venous thromboembolic events (VTE). However, beyond the presence of positive antiphospholipid antibodies and splenectomy, risk factors for developing a VTE during wAIHA have not been clearly identified. The aim of this retrospective study was to characterize VTEs during wAIHA and to identify risk factors for VTE. Forty-eight patients with wAIHA were included, among whom 26 (54%) had secondary wAIHA. Eleven (23%) patients presented at least one VTE, that occurred during an active phase of the disease for 10/11 patients (90%). The frequency of VTE was not different between primary and secondary AIHA (23.7 vs. 19.2%; p = 0.5). The Padua prediction score based on traditional risk factors was not different between patients with and without VTE. On multivariate analysis, total bilirubin ≥ 40 μmol/L [odds ratio (OR) = 7.4; p = 0.02] and leucocyte count above 7x109/L (OR = 15.7; p = 0.02) were significantly associated with a higher risk of thrombosis. Antiphospholipid antibodies were screened in 9 out the 11 patients who presented a VTE and were negative. Thus, the frequency of VTE is high (23%) during wAIHA and VTE preferentially occur within the first weeks of diagnosis. As no clinically relevant predictive factors of VTE could be identified, the systematic use of a prophylactic anticoagulation should be recommended in case of active hemolysis and its maintenance after hospital discharge should be considered. The benefit of a systematic screening for VTE and its procedure remain to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W2899608744,"Background Hospital length-of-Stay has been traditionally used as a surrogate to evaluate healthcare efficiency, as well as hospital resource utilization. Prolonged Length-of-stay (PLOS) is associated with increased mortality and other poor outcomes. Additionally, these patients represent a significant economic problem on public health systems and their families. We sought to describe and compare characteristics of patients with Normal hospital Length-of-Stay (NLOS) and PLOS to identify sociodemographic and disease-specific factors associated with PLOS in a tertiary care institution that attends adults with complicated diseases from all over Mexico. Materials and methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of hospital discharges from January 2000-December 2017 using institutional databases of medical records. We compared NLOS and PLOS using descriptive and inferential statistics. PLOS were defined as those above the 95th percentile of length of hospitalization. Results We analyzed 85,904 hospitalizations (1,069,875 bed-days), of which 4,427 (5.1%) were PLOS (247,428 bed-days, 23.1% of total bed-days). Hematological neoplasms were the most common discharge diagnosis and surgery of the small bowel was the most common type of surgery. Younger age, male gender, a lower physician-to-patient ratio, emergency and weekend admissions, surgery, the number of comorbidities, residence outside Mexico City and lower socioeconomic status were associated with PLOS. Bone marrow transplant (OR 18.39 [95% CI 12.50–27.05, p<0.001), complex infectious diseases such as systemic mycoses and parasitoses (OR 4.65 [95% CI 3.40–6.63, p<0.001), and complex abdominal diseases such as intestinal fistula (OR 2.57 [95% CI 1.98–3.32) had the greatest risk for PLOS. Risk of mortality in patients with PLOS increased more than threefold (3.7% vs 13.3%, p<0.001). Conclusions We report some key sociodemographic and disease-specific differences in patients with PLOS. These could serve to develop a specific model of directed hospital healthcare for patients identified as in risk of PLOS."
https://openalex.org/W2899606308,"Our aim was to identify serum microRNAs (miRNAs) in healthy humans which associate with future onset of both diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. We performed global profiling of 753 mature human miRNAs in serum of 12 pilot subjects followed by measurement of 47 consistently expressed miRNAs in fasting serum of 553 healthy subjects from the baseline exam (1991-1994) of the population based Malmö Diet and Cancer Study Cardiovascular Cohort (MDC-CC), of whom 140 developed diabetes, and 169 cardiovascular diseases during follow-up. We used multivariate logistic regression to test individual miRNAs for association with incident diabetes and cardiovascular disease as compared to control subjects (n = 259). After Bonferroni correction and adjustment for age and sex, each SD increment of log-transformed miR-483-5p was significantly associated with both incident diabetes (OR = 1.48; 95% CI 1.18-1.84, P = 0.001) and cardiovascular disease (OR = 1.40; 95% CI 1.15, 1.72, P = 0.001). In cross sectional analysis, miR-483-5p was correlated with BMI (r = 0.162, P = 0.0001), fasting insulin (r = 0.156, P = 0.0002), HDL (r = -0.099, P = 0.02) and triglycerides (r = 0.11, P = 0.01). Adjustment for these metabolic risk factors, as well as traditional risk factors attenuated the miR-483-5p association with incident diabetes (OR = 1.28 95% CI 1.00-1.64, P = 0.049) whereas its association with incident cardiovascular disease remained virtually unchanged (OR = 1.46 95% CI, 1.18-1.81, P = 0.0005). In conclusion, miR-483-5p associates with both diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The association with diabetes seems partly mediated by obesity and insulin resistance, whereas the association with incident cardiovascular disease is independent of these metabolic factors and traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W2900312813,"Background and aims Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer related deaths. Patients with advanced HCC are treated with sorafenib. A recent randomized controlled trial demonstrated a survival benefit for regorafenib treatment in patients with advanced HCC who had progressed on sorafenib. We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of this approach. Methods To evaluate the cost effectiveness of regorafenib, we used a Markov model that incorporates health outcomes, measured by life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Drug costs were based on 2017 discounted prices. Model robustness was validated by probabilistic sensitivity analyses using Monte Carlo simulations. Results The use of regorafenib results in a gain of 19.76 weeks of life (0.38 Life Years) as compared to placebo. When adjusted for quality of life, using regorafenib produced a gain of 0.25 quality adjusted life years (QALYs). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for regorafenib compared with best supportive care was between $201,797 and $268,506 per QALY. Conclusion The modest incremental benefit at a relatively high incremental cost of regorafenib treatment suggests that it is not cost-effective at commonly accepted willingness to pay thresholds."
https://openalex.org/W2900203005,"A centralized deposit of adiposity increases the risk of cardiometabolic diseases. Several anthropometric markers can be used to characterize fat distribution. In the case of severe obesity, several markers, such as hip and waist circumference, are prone to measurement error. Conversely, neck circumference is easy to obtain. The aim was to determine the best surrogate marker of obesity-related cardiometabolic diseases from: body mass index (BMI), waist, hip and neck circumferences and waist-to-hip ratio. Methods Data from women (n = 305, aged 43 [34; 53] years-old, BMI 44.2 [40.8; 48.2] kg/m2) included in the Severe Obesity Outcome Network (SOON) cohort were analyzed (i) to evaluate collinearity between the different anthropometric markers, (ii) to compare the association of markers with hypertension, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and other cardiometabolic risks. Results Hip, waist and neck circumferences correlated with BMI with respectively less collinearity (r = 0.70, r = 0.59 and r = 0.37, respectively, p<0.001) whereas waist-to-hip ratio was not correlated (r = 0.11, p = 0.072). Waist and neck circumferences were significantly associated with hypertension, type 2 diabetes and OSAS in univariate logistic regressions, waist-to-hip ratio with hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Hip circumference was inversely correlated with type 2 diabetes (OR 0.970 (95CI: 0.948; 0.991) p = 0.006). BMI was only linked to OSAS (OR 1.092 (95CI: 1.043; 1.143) p<0.001). Neck circumference was the only marker significantly associated with all cardiometabolic risk markers (HOMA-IR, apnea-hypopnea index, Log Triglycerides/HDL-c, alanin-aminotransferase, aspartate-aminotransferase, gammaglutamyl transpeptidase). Conclusions Neck circumference appears the most appropriate anthropometric marker to identify the fat distribution associated with high cardiometabolic risk in women with severe obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2899689023,"Due to their complex chemical and physical properties, the effects and mechanisms of action of natural sources of dietary fiber on the intestine are unclear. Pigs are commonly fed high-fiber diets to reduce production costs and non-starch polysaccharide (NSP)-degrading enzymes have been used to increase fiber digestibility. We evaluated the expression of mucin 2 (MUC2), presence of goblet cells, and ileal immune profile of pigs housed individually for 28 days and fed either a low fiber diet based on corn-soybean meal (CSB, n = 9), or two high fiber diets formulated adding 40% corn distillers’ dried grains with solubles (DDGS, n = 9) or 30% wheat middlings (WM, n = 9) to CSB-based diet. Pigs were also fed those diets supplemented with a NSP enzymes mix (E) of xylanase, β-glucanase, mannanase, and galactosidase (n = 8, 10, and 9 for CSB+E, DDGS+E and WM+E, respectively). Feeding DDGS and WM diets increased ileal MUC2 expression compared with CSB diet, and this effect was reversed by the addition of enzymes. There were no differences in abundance of goblet cells among treatments. In general, enzyme supplementation increased gene expression and concentrations of IL-1β, and reduced the concentrations of IL-4, IL-17A and IL-11. The effects of diet-induced cytokines on modulating intestinal MUC2 were assessed in vitro by treating mouse and swine enteroids with 1 ng/ml of IL-4 and IL-1β. In accordance with previous studies, treatment with Il-4 induced Muc2 and expansion of goblet cells in mouse enteroids. However, swine enteroids did not change MUC2 expression or number of goblet cells when treated with IL-4 or IL-1β. Our results suggest that mucin and immune profile are regulated by diet in the swine intestine, but by mechanisms different to mouse, emphasizing the need for using appropriate models to study responses to dietary fiber in swine."
https://openalex.org/W2899538000,"Background Vitamin D is required to maintain the integrity of the intestinal barrier and inhibits inflammatory signaling pathways. Objective Vitamin D deficiency might be involved in cirrhosis-associated systemic inflammation and risk of hepatic decompensation in patients with liver cirrhosis. Methods Outpatients of the Hepatology Unit of the University Hospital Frankfurt with advanced liver fibrosis and cirrhosis were prospectively enrolled. 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D3) serum concentrations were quantified and associated with markers of systemic inflammation / intestinal bacterial translocation and hepatic decompensation. Results A total of 338 patients with advanced liver fibrosis or cirrhosis were included. Of those, 51 patients (15%) were hospitalized due to hepatic decompensation during follow-up. Overall, 72 patients (21%) had severe vitamin D deficiency. However, patients receiving vitamin D supplements had significantly higher 25(OH)D3 serum levels compared to patients without supplements (37 ng/mL vs. 16 ng/ml, P<0.0001). Uni- and multivariate analyses revealed an independent association of severe vitamin D deficiency with the risk of hepatic decompensation during follow-up (multivariate P = 0.012; OR = 3.25, 95% CI = 1.30–8.2), together with MELD score, low hemoglobin concentration, low coffee consumption, and presence of diabetes. Of note, serum levels of C-reactive protein, IL-6 and soluble CD14 were significantly higher in patients with versus without severe vitamin D deficiency, and serum levels of soluble CD14 levels declined in patients with de novo supplementation of vitamin D (median 2.15 vs. 1.87 ng/mL, P = 0.002). Conclusions In this prospective cohort study, baseline vitamin D levels were inversely associated with liver-cirrhosis related systemic inflammation and the risk of hepatic decompensation."
https://openalex.org/W2899629521,"With less than 3200 wild tigers in 2010, the heads of 13 tiger-range countries committed to doubling the global population of wild tigers by 2022. This goal represents the highest level of ambition and commitment required to turn the tide for tigers in the wild. Yet, ensuring efficient and targeted implementation of conservation actions alongside systematic monitoring of progress towards this goal requires that we set site-specific recovery targets and timelines that are ecologically realistic. In this study, we assess the recovery potential of 18 sites identified under WWF’s Tigers Alive Initiative. We delineated recovery systems comprising a source, recovery site, and support region, which need to be managed synergistically to meet these targets. By using the best available data on tiger and prey numbers, and adapting existing species recovery frameworks, we show that these sites, which currently support 165 (118–277) tigers, have the potential to harbour 585 (454–739) individuals. This would constitute a 15% increase in the global population and represent over a three-fold increase within these specific sites, on an average. However, it may not be realistic to achieve this target by 2022, since tiger recovery in 15 of these 18 sites is contingent on the initial recovery of prey populations, which is a slow process. We conclude that while sustained conservation efforts can yield significant recoveries, it is critical that we commit our resources to achieving the biologically realistic targets for these sites even if the timelines are extended."
https://openalex.org/W2900222741,"The underlying mechanisms of neuropathic pain remain to be elucidated. Basic animal research has suggested that lysophosphatidic acids, which are bioactive lipids produced by autotaxin from lysophosphatidylcholine, may play key roles in the initiation and maintenance of neuropathic pain. Here, we investigated the clinical relevance of lysophosphatidic acids signaling on neuropathic pain in humans. Eighteen patients who had been diagnosed with neuropathic pain with varied etiologies participated in the study. Cerebrospinal fluid samples were obtained by lumbar puncture and the concentrations of 12 species of lysophosphatidic acids and lysophosphatidylcholine, autotaxin, and the phosphorylated neurofilament heavy subunit were measured. Pain symptoms were assessed using an 11-point numeric rating scale and the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory regarding intensity and descriptive dimensions of neuropathic pain. The total lysophosphatidic acids were significantly associated with both pain intensity and symptoms. 18:1 and 20:4 lysophosphatidic acids in particular demonstrated the most correlations with dimensions of pain symptoms. Autotaxin and the phosphorylated neurofilament heavy subunit showed no association with pain symptoms. In conclusions, lysophosphatidic acids were significantly associated with pain symptoms in neuropathic pain patients. These results suggest that lysophosphatidic acids signaling might be a potential therapeutic target for neuropathic pain."
https://openalex.org/W2899639912,"Background Chronic infection with hepatitis B or C virus (HBV/HCV) can progress to cirrhosis, liver cancer, and even death. In a low endemic country as the Netherlands, migrants are a key risk group and could benefit from early diagnosis and antiviral treatment. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of screening foreign-born migrants for chronic HBV and/or HCV using a societal perspective. Methods The cost-effectiveness was evaluated using a Markov model. Estimates on prevalence, screening programme costs, participation and treatment uptake, transition probabilities, healthcare costs, productivity losses and utilities were derived from the literature. The cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gained was estimated and sensitivity analyses were performed. Results For most migrant groups with an expected high number of chronically infected cases in the Netherlands combined screening is cost-effective, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) ranging from €4,962/QALY gained for migrants originating from the Former Soviet Union and Vietnam to €9,375/QALY gained for Polish migrants. HBV and HCV screening proved to be cost-effective for migrants from countries with chronic HBV or HCV prevalence of ≥0.41% and ≥0.22%, with ICERs below the Dutch cost-effectiveness reference value of €20,000/QALY gained. Sensitivity analysis showed that treatment costs influenced the ICER for both infections. Conclusions For most migrant populations in a low-endemic country offering combined HBV and HCV screening is cost-effective. Implementation of targeted HBV and HCV screening programmes to increase early diagnosis and treatment is important to reduce the burden of chronic hepatitis B and C among migrants."
https://openalex.org/W2900182328,"Anemia in pregnancy is a major public health concern worldwide, especially in developing countries. Thus, there is a need of having current information and local data on the prevalence of anemia and associated factors during pregnancy to help inform preventive programmes. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of anemia and associated factors among pregnant women attending antenatal care at Debre Markos Referral Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia.An institution based cross-sectional study was conducted at Debre Markos Referral Hospital in July and August 2016. A total of 234 randomly-selected pregnant women took part in the study. Data on sociodemographic factors, environmental and sanitation factors, reproductive factors, and nutrition related characteristics were collected using a structured questionnaire. Hemoglobin level was determined using hematological analyzer (Cell Dyn 1800) machine. The stool sample was collected to identify intestinal parasitic infections. Statistical analysis was done using logistic regression. The p value of less than 0.05 at 95% confidence interval was considered statistically significant.The overall prevalence of anemia among pregnant women was 11.5% (95% CI: 8.2%- 14.9%). The result of multivariable analysis revealed that, coffee consumption [AOR = 2.91; 95% CI (1.63, 8.78)], and hookworm infection [AOR = 2.65; 95% CI (1.48, 4.72)] were factors significantly associated with anemia among pregnant women.Anemia is of public health concern among pregnant women in the study area. All pregnant women coming to antenatal clinics should be screened and treated routinely for intestinal parasitic infection. Pregnant women should limit coffee consumption, and avoid drinking coffee with meals."
https://openalex.org/W2899915905,"The tongue is uniquely exposed to water-soluble environmental chemicals that may lead to injury or tumorigenesis. However, comparatively little research has focused on the molecular and functional organization of trigeminal ganglia (TG) afferent neurons innervating the tongue. The current study identified and characterized lingual sensory neurons based on a neuronal subtype classification previously characterized in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. We employed immunohistochemistry on transgenic reporter mouse lines as well as single-cell PCR of known markers of neuronal subtypes to characterize neuronal subtypes innervating the tongue. Markers expressed in retrogradely labeled TG neurons were evaluated for the proportion of neurons expressing each marker, intensity of expression, and overlapping genes. We found that tongue-innervating sensory neurons primarily expressed CGRP, TRPV1, TrkC, 5HT3A and Parvalbumin. These markers correspond to peptidergic and a subgroup of non-peptidergic C-nociceptors, peptidergic A nociceptors, proprioceptors and myelinated low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs). Interestingly, as reported previously, we also found several differences between TG and DRG neurons indicating the need for single-cell sequencing of neuronal types based on tissue type within all TG as well as DRG neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2900166219,"Understanding critical roles of warming and reanimation is critical to improve the survival of vitrified testicular tissue in domestic cats. The objective was to study structural and functional properties of testicular tissues from prepubertal domestic cats after standard vitrification followed by two warming protocols (directly at 37°C or with a 5-second pre-exposure to 50°C) and three reanimation time points (immediately, 24 h and 5 days post-warming). In Experiment 1, tissues were evaluated for histo-morphology and mitochondrial activity immediately or 24 h after warming protocols. In Experiment 2, cell viability, DNA fragmentation, and germ cell composition were assessed immediately, 24 h, or 5 days after optimal warming. Preservation of seminiferous tubule structure was better using warming at 50°C for five seconds, and survival of somatic as well as germinal cells was higher compared to direct warming at 37°C for one minute. Short term in vitro culture (for reanimation) also proved that cellular composition and functionality were better preserved when warmed for a short time at 50°C. Collective data showed that short warming at 50°C led to better quality of seminiferous tubule structure and cell composition after vitrification and short-term culture. In addition, data suggest clear directions to further understand and optimize testicular tissue survival after fertility preservation procedures."
https://openalex.org/W2900396273,"The influence of age on spinal muscle activation patterns and its relation to kinematics is poorly understood. We aimed at understanding age-related changes to spine and trunk muscle activity in addition to spinal and lower limb kinematics during treadmill walking under various conditions. An observational study was conducted evaluating asymptomatic young (n = 10; 3F, 7M; 26.3±2.5yrs) and older (n = 9; 3F, 6M; 67.1±4.2yrs) adults’ treadmill walking at 2km/h and 4km/h, each at 0, 1, 5, and 10% inclination. Unilateral (right side) electromyography (EMG) was recorded from deep and superficial multifidus (intramuscular) and erector spinae and abdominal obliques (surface); trunk and leg kinematics were also measured. Muscle activity was characterised by peak amplitude and duration of activity, and the time-point of peak amplitude in the gait cycle (0–100%). Peak activation in older adults was lower for the superficial multifidus (p<0.0001) and higher for the thoracolumbar (p<0.001) and lumbar erector spinae (p<0.01). The duration of activation was longer in older adults for all muscles (p<0.05) except the superficial multifidus, and longer during faster walking for all participants. The time-point of peak amplitude in the gait cycle was earlier in older participants for the external obliques (p<0.05). Walking speed appeared to influence muscle activity more than inclination. Older adults used less spine, trunk and lower limb motion, except at the ankle. Age-related differences within multifidus and between paravertebral and trunk muscles were inconsistent. Walking at 4km/h at 5–10% inclination may specifically target the lumbar paravertebral muscles."
https://openalex.org/W2900432212,"The present study extends previous cross-sectional findings by examining the predictive validity of positive and negative schizotypy in a young adult sample at a three-year follow-up. Schizotypy and schizophrenia share a comparable multidimensional structure with positive and negative dimensions being the most strongly supported factors. Previous cross-sectional and longitudinal studies employing the psychometric high-risk strategy indicated that schizotypy is a useful method for identifying risk and resilience factors for the development of schizophrenia-spectrum psychopathology. In the present study, 103 participants (77% of 134 candidate participants) were reassessed at a three-year follow-up. As hypothesized, positive schizotypy predicted psychotic-like symptoms, depression, low self-esteem, and general psychopathology. Negative schizotypy predicted emotional disturbances, schizoid personality traits, and mental health treatment during the past year. As expected, both schizotypy dimensions predicted schizotypal, paranoid, and avoidant personality traits, and impaired functioning. These longitudinal findings provide additional evidence supporting the multidimensional model of schizotypy as a valid framework for studying etiological mechanisms and trajectories of psychosis."
https://openalex.org/W2899518570,"The increasing use of proton radiotherapy during the last decade and the rising number of long-term survivors has given rise to a vital discussion on potential effects on normal tissue. So far, deviations from clinically applied generic RBE (relative biological effectiveness) of 1.1 were only obtained by in vitro studies, whereas indications from in vivo trials and clinical studies are rare. In the present work, wildtype zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio) were used to characterize the effects of plateau and mid-SOBP (spread-out Bragg peak) proton radiation relative to that induced by clinical MV photon beam reference. Based on embryonic survival data, RBE values of 1.13 ± 0.08 and of 1.20 ± 0.04 were determined four days after irradiations with 20 Gy plateau and SOBP protons relative to 6 MV photon beams. These RBE values were confirmed by relating the rates of embryos with morphological abnormalities for the respective radiation qualities and doses. Besides survival, the rate of spine bending, as one type of developmental abnormality, and of pericardial edema, as an example for acute radiation effects, were assessed. The results revealed that independent on radiation quality both rates increased with time approaching almost 100% at the 4th day post irradiation with doses higher than 15 Gy. To sum up, the applicability of the zebrafish embryo as a robust and simple alternative model for in vivo characterization of radiobiological effects in normal tissue was validated and the obtained RBE values are comparable to previous finding in animal trials."
https://openalex.org/W2899539986,"Introduction Heart failure (HF), a major cardiovascular disorder, remains a grievous clinical condition regardless of advances in medical care. Hyponatremia is classified as a serum sodium concentration of <135 mEq/L, and the prevalence, clinical impact and prognostic factor of hyponatremia in heart failure patients varies widely. The current study was conducted with the aim of assessing the prevalence of hyponatremia in patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of HF and comparing baseline clinical characteristic of HF patients based on their sodium status. Survival difference between patients with hyponatremia and normonatremia was also assessed and the clinical prognostic indicators of overall mortality in HF patients were evaluated. Method A retrospective cohort study was conducted to assess medical records of heart failure patients who were admitted to Gondar University Referral Hospital. Patients were categorized based on their sodium level status at their first admission to the internal medicine department. Each patient was assigned to either of the following groups: hyponatremia if sodium < 135 mmol/L, or normonatremia if sodium ≥ 135 mmol/L. Result Among 388 participants, the prevalence of hyponatremia in the study cohorts was 51.03%. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that there was a significant difference in survival status of HF patients among the two cohorts (Log—Rank test, P <0.0001). Hence, patients with normal sodium levels had a higher chance of survival over hyponatremic patients. Multivariate Cox regression has revealed a statistically significant association of mortality with the following variables: advanced age (AHR = 1.035 (1.012–1.058), P = 0.003), hyponatremia (AHR = 4.003 (1.778–9.009), P = 0.001), higher creatinine level (AHR = 1.929 (1.523–2.443), P = <0.0001) and, prescription of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (AHR = 0.410 (0.199–0.842), P = 0.015) and spironolactone (AHR = 0.511 (0.275–0.949), P = 0.033. Conclusion In conclusion, hyponatremia is one of the crucial factors in the clinical prognosis of heart failure patients. However, as other prognostic factors (i.e. medication, creatine level, and age) also played vital roles in overall survival, well-controlled clinical trials (complete with medication dosing, laboratory outputs and long-term prospective follow up) are required to further study the impact of hyponatremia in HF patient’s prognosis in low income nations."
https://openalex.org/W2899891108,"Alternaria panax Whetz causes one of the most commonly occurring and serious diseases in ginseng cultivation, and may cause significant production and economic losses in the ginseng industry. Rapid, early, and accurate identification of Alternaria panax Whetz is an essential prerequisite for the effective prevention and control of further infection spread. In this work, a rapid and accurate molecular diagnostic method, a single-tube nested PCR-lateral flow biosensor assay (STNPCR-LFBA), was developed for rapid identification of Alternaria panax Whetz. The STNPCR-LFBA was 100 times more sensitive than the traditional PCR-LFBA. Besides that, the PCR product was checked by a lateral flow biosensor assay, which provided a basis for the migration of the detection technology to a point-of-care test (POCT) format. STNPCR-LFBA was specific to Alternaria panax Whetz, and no cross-reactions were observed in other non-target samples; the limit of detection was up to 0.01 pg of Alternaria panax Whetz genomic DNA. STNPCR-LFBA could also be used for specific identification of Alternaria panax Whetz in real samples. STNPCR-LFBA is useful for identifying Alternaria panax Whetz due to its rapidity, accuracy, and simple manipulation."
https://openalex.org/W2900437091,"The way humans perceive and attend to visual scenes differs profoundly between individuals. This is most compellingly demonstrated for context-sensitivity, the relative attentional focus on focal objects and background elements of a scene, in cross-cultural comparisons. Differences in context-sensitivity have been reported in verbal accounts (e.g. picture descriptions) and in visual attention (e.g., eye-tracking paradigms). The present study investigates (1) if the way parents verbally guide the attention of their children in visual scenes is associated with differences in children’s context-sensitivity and (2) if verbal descriptions of scenes are related to early visual attention (i.e., gaze behavior) in 5-year-old children and their parents. Importantly, the way parents verbally described visual scenes to their children was related to children’s context-sensitivity, when describing these scenes themselves. This is, we found a correlation in the number of references made to the object versus the background as well as the number of relations made between different elements of a scene. Furthermore, verbal descriptions were closely related to visual attention in adults, but not in children. These findings support our hypotheses that context-sensitivity is socialized via a verbal route and that visual attention processes align with acquired narrative structures only later in development, after the preschool years."
https://openalex.org/W2899881225,"Background Cerebral atrophy is common in multiple sclerosis (MS) and selectively involves gray matter (GM). Several fully automated methods are available to measure whole brain and regional deep GM (DGM) atrophy from MRI. Objective To assess the sensitivity of fully automated MRI segmentation pipelines in detecting brain atrophy in patients with relapsing-remitting (RR) MS and normal controls (NC) over five years. Methods Consistent 3D T1-weighted sequences were performed on a 3T GE unit in 16 mildly disabled patients with RRMS and 16 age-matched NC at baseline and five years. All patients received disease-modifying immunotherapy on-study. Images were applied to two pipelines to assess whole brain atrophy [brain parenchymal fraction (BPF) from SPM12; percentage brain volume change (PBVC) from SIENA] and two other pipelines (FSL-FIRST; FreeSurfer) to assess DGM atrophy (thalamus, caudate, globus pallidus, putamen). MRI change was compared by two sample t-tests. Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and timed 25-foot walk (T25FW) change was compared by repeated measures proportional odds models. Results Using FreeSurfer, the MS group had a ~10-fold acceleration in on-study volume loss than NC in the caudate (mean decrease 0.51 vs. 0.05 ml, p = 0.022). In contrast, caudate atrophy was not detected by FSL-FIRST (mean decrease 0.21 vs. 0.12 ml, p = 0.53). None of the other pipelines showed any difference in volume loss between groups, for whole brain or regional DGM atrophy (all p>0.38). The MS group showed on-study stability on EDSS (p = 0.47) but slight worsening of T25FW (p = 0.054). Conclusions In this real-world cohort of mildly disabled treated patients with RRMS, we identified ongoing atrophy of the caudate nucleus over five years, despite the lack of any significant whole brain atrophy, compared to healthy controls. The detectability of caudate atrophy was dependent on the MRI segmentation pipeline employed. These findings underscore the increased sensitivity gained when assessing DGM atrophy in monitoring MS."
https://openalex.org/W2900131481,"Background Low birth weight (LBW), an important risk factor for early childhood mortality and morbidity, is a major public health concern in developing countries including Cambodia. This study examined the prevalence of LBW across provinces in Cambodia and changes over time, and identified the factors associated with such condition. Methods We used children datasets from Cambodia Demographic and Health Survey (CDHS) 2010 and 2014. There were 3,522 children and 4,991 children in both surveys. Maps illustrating provincial variation in LBW prevalence were constructed. Then, multivariate analyses were conducted to assess factors independently associated with LBW in CDHS 2014. Results LBW prevalence remained stable between 2010 and 2014, at around 7.0% 95% CI: 5.8–8.1). all institutional births, but within significant variation across provinces. Factors independently associated with LBW included mother’s no education compared with those whose mothers had secondary or higher education (AOR = 1.6, 95% CI: 1.0–2.6), babies born to mothers with < 4 antenatal care (ANC) visits during the pregnancy compared with those whose mothers had at least 4 ANC visits (AOR = 2.0, 95% CI: 1.5–2.8). Also, first-born babies were at greater risk of LBW compared with second-born babies (AOR = 1.4, 95% CI: 1.0–2.0). Conclusion The study points to key sub-populations at greater risk and regions where LBW is particularly prevalent. Programs should target provinces where LBW prevalence remains high. Illiterate women, especially those pregnant for the first time should be the program priority. The current national program policy, which recommends that pregnant women have ≥ 4 ANC visits during pregnancy should be further reinforced and implemented. Program design should consider ways to communicate the importance of making the recommended number of ANC visits among women with no formal education."
https://openalex.org/W2900225503,"We clarified in our previous study that hypoxic training promotes angiogenesis in skeletal muscle, but the mechanism of angiogenesis in skeletal muscle remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the influence of differences in hypoxia exposure on angiogenesis in skeletal muscles at differing ages and metabolic characteristics at which the production of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide may differ. Ten-week-old (young) and 20-month-old (old) mice were separated into control (N), continuous hypoxia (H), and intermittent hypoxia (IH) groups. The H group was exposed to 16% O2 hypoxia for 5 days and the IH group was exposed to 16% O2 hypoxia at one-hour intervals during the light period for 5 days. After completion of hypoxia exposure, the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles were immediately excised, and mRNA expression of angiogenesis- and satellite cell-related genes was investigated using real-time RT-PCR. In addition, muscle fiber type composition, muscle fiber area, number of satellite cells, and capillary density were measured immunohistochemically. In the young soleus muscle, the muscle fiber area was decreased in the H group, and mRNA expression of satellite cell activation-related MyoD, MHCe, and BDNF was significantly increased. On the other hand, in the old soleus muscle, nNOS and VEGF-A mRNA expression, and the capillary density were significantly increased in the H group. In the superficial portion of the gastrocnemius, mRNA expression of FGF2, an angiogenic factor secreted by satellite cells, was significantly increased in the young IH group. In addition, a positive correlation between VEGF-A mRNA expression and nNOS mRNA expression in the soleus muscle and eNOS mRNA expression in the superficial portion of the gastrocnemius was noted. These data demonstrated that age, hypoxia exposure method and muscle metabolic characteristics are related, which results in significant differences in angiogenesis."

Data from five patients with proliferative DR (PDR) (mean age 51.9 ± 10.5 years) was analyzed. The vessel diameter (D), average velocity (V), and retinal blood flow (RBF) in veins were measured using a DOCT flowmeter before and four weeks after PRP. Segmental RBF from inferotemporal (IT), superotemporal (ST), inferonasal (IN), and superonasal (SN) veins were measured, and SRBF was defined as the sum of these measurements. All data were analyzed by Wilcoxson test. After PRP, there were statistically significant decreases in the every segmental D, V, RBF (P<0.03) and SRBF (P = 0.002). The other parameters showed no statistically significant differences (P>0.05). The DOCT flowmeter has the potential to be a clinically useful tool to noninvasively evaluate the changes in retinal circulation during PRP in patients with PDR."
https://openalex.org/W2899821612,"Purpose The escalating burden of diabetes in countries tackling high burden of tuberculosis (TB) has adverse implications for co-infected individuals and National TB control efforts. We aimed to study whether there was a difference in treatment outcome among diabetic and non-diabetic pulmonary TB patients and identify the determinants of treatment outcome among the two groups. Materials and methods This prospective cohort study recruited new patients of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) aged 15 years and above who were diagnosed at and registered with Gulab Devi Chest Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan for anti-tuberculosis treatment (ATT). PTB patients were screened for diabetes using random and fasting blood glucose tests. Diabetic and non-diabetic PTB patients were followed up at second, fifth and sixth month of ATT and 6 months after ATT completion to determine treatment outcome. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess association between various factors and treatment outcome. Results Of 614 PTB patients, (n = 113 [18%]) were diabetic and (n = 501 [82%]) non-diabetic. Final model showed that diabetics were more likely to experience an unfavorable outcome as compared to non-diabetics (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.70, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] = 1.30 to 5.59). Other predictors of unfavorable outcome included rural residence (aOR = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.14 to 3.47), body mass index less than 18.50 (aOR = 1.89, 95% CI = 1.03 to 3.47) and being a smoker (aOR = 2.03, 95%CI = 1.04 to 3.94). Conclusion Our study shows unfavorable treatment outcome among diabetic PTB patients. Integrated models of care with screening/testing and management for diabetes and TB could improve TB treatment outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2900160104,"Treatments for Cocaine Use Disorder (CUD) are variably effective, and there are no FDA-approved medications. One approach to developing new treatments for CUD may be to investigate and target poor prognostic signs. One such sign is anhedonia (i.e. a loss of pleasure or interest in non-drug rewards), which predicts worse outcomes in existing CUD treatments. Inflammation is thought to underlie anhedonia in many other disorders, but the relationship between anhedonia and inflammation has not been investigated in CUD. Therefore, we assessed peripheral genome-wide gene expression in n = 48 individuals with CUD with high (n = 24) vs. low (n = 24) levels of anhedonia, defined by a median split of self-reported anhedonia. Our hypothesis was that individuals with high anhedonia would show differential gene expression in inflammatory pathways. No individual genes were significantly different between the low and high anhedonia groups when using t-tests with a stringent false discovery rate correction (FDR-corrected p < 0.05). However, an exploratory analysis identified 166 loci where t-tests suggested group differences at a nominal p < 0.05. We used DAVID, a bioinformatics tool that provides functional interpretations of complex lists of genes, to examine representation of this gene list in known pathways. It confirmed that mechanisms related to immunity were the top significant associations with anhedonia in the sample. Further, the two top differentially expressed genes in our sample, IRF1 and GBP5, both have primary inflammation and immune functions, and were significantly negatively correlated with total scores on our self-report of anhedonia across all 48 subjects. These results suggest that prioritizing development of anti-inflammatory medications for CUD may pay dividends, particularly in combination with treatment-matching strategies using either phenotypic measures of anhedonia or biomarkers of inflammatory gene expression to individualize treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2899618557,"The CXCL12-CXCR4 pathway has crucial roles in stem cell homing and maintenance, neuronal guidance, cancer progression, inflammation, remote-conditioning, cell migration and development. Recently, work in chick suggested that signalling via CXCR4 in neural crest cells (NCCs) has a role in the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS), a disorder where haploinsufficiency of the transcription factor TBX1 is responsible for the major structural defects. We tested this idea in mouse models. Our analysis of genes with altered expression in Tbx1 mutant mouse models showed down-regulation of Cxcl12 in pharyngeal surface ectoderm and rostral mesoderm, both tissues with the potential to signal to migrating NCCs. Conditional mutagenesis of Tbx1 in the pharyngeal surface ectoderm is associated with hypo/aplasia of the 4th pharyngeal arch artery (PAA) and interruption of the aortic arch type B (IAA-B), the cardiovascular defect most typical of 22q11.2DS. We therefore analysed constitutive mouse mutants of the ligand (CXCL12) and receptor (CXCR4) components of the pathway, in addition to ectodermal conditionals of Cxcl12 and NCC conditionals of Cxcr4. However, none of these typical 22q11.2DS features were detected in constitutively or conditionally mutant embryos. Instead, duplicated carotid arteries were observed, a phenotype recapitulated in Tie-2Cre (endothelial) conditional knock outs of Cxcr4. Previous studies have demonstrated genetic interaction between signalling pathways and Tbx1 haploinsufficiency e.g. FGF, WNT, SMAD-dependent. We therefore tested for possible epistasis between Tbx1 and the CXCL12 signalling axis by examining Tbx1 and Cxcl12 double heterozygotes as well as Tbx1/Cxcl12/Cxcr4 triple heterozygotes, but failed to identify any exacerbation of the Tbx1 haploinsufficient arch artery phenotype. We conclude that CXCL12 signalling via NCC/CXCR4 has no major role in the genesis of the Tbx1 loss of function phenotype. Instead, the pathway has a distinct effect on remodelling of head vessels and interventricular septation mediated via CXCL12 signalling from the pharyngeal surface ectoderm and second heart field to endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2899781211,"We investigated the performance of the handheld radial shape discrimination (hRSD) test in detecting the development of neovascular AMD (nAMD) in a prospective, longitudinal, observational study. Patients diagnosed with unilateral nAMD, with no nAMD in the other eye (the study eye, SE), completed the hRSD test on consecutive, routine clinic visits up to a maximum of 12, or until they were diagnosed with nAMD in the SE based on slit-lamp biomicroscopy and spectral-domain OCT assessment, with fluorescein angiography confirmation. Masked grading was carried out to confirm the diagnosis of nAMD, and to ensure no cases of nAMD were missed. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was used to explore the diagnostic performance of the hRSD test relative to clinical diagnosis. Data were available from 179 patients of whom 19 (10.6%; ""converters"") developed nAMD in the SE. The mean hRSD threshold at conversion was -0.47 (95% CI -0.38 to -0.55) logMAR compared to -0.53 (-0.50 to -0.57) logMAR in 160 non-converters. hRSD threshold in the converters began to decline 190 days before diagnosis of nAMD. The ROC curve demonstrated that at an hRSD cut-off of -0.60 logMAR, sensitivity was 0.79 (0.54-0.94) with a specificity of 0.54 (0.46-0.62); positive and negative predictive values were 0.16 and 0.96 respectively. We conclude that the hRSD test has moderate sensitivity for detecting the earliest stages of nAMD in the at-risk fellow eyes of patients with unilateral nAMD, compared to clinical diagnosis. Given its relative inexpensiveness, ease of use and the inherent connectivity of the platforms it can be presented on, it may have a role in early detection of nAMD in the population at large."
https://openalex.org/W2900359552,"Aphids are major pests of cotton crops in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in China, and parasitoids are considered as important natural enemies in regulating aphid populations. However, information on aphid parasitoids in the Xinjiang cotton fields is limited, which hinders the study of aphid-parasitoid interactions and the application of conservation biological control against cotton aphids. In this study, a 3-year survey was conducted in a large geographical range that included three primary cotton planting areas in southern and northern Xinjiang. The population dynamics and the parasitism levels of an assemblage of aphids in the cotton fields were investigated along with the composition of the parasitoid community associated with these aphids. Aphid parasitization varied significantly within both years and seasons, with parasitism levels ranging from 0 to 26%, indicating that there is less effective biological control of parasitoids on aphids under field conditions. Among the primary parasitoids described, Binodoxys communis (Gahan) constituted 95.19% of the parasitoid species, followed by Praon barbatum Mackauer (3.15%), Trioxys asiaticus Telenga (1.01%) and Lysiphlebus fabarum Marshall (0.65%). Significant differences were found in the composition of the primary parasitoid species between the cotton seedling period (June) and the flowering period (July-August), and two more primary aphid parasitoids were found in the seedling period. Twelve hyperparasitoid species belonging to six genera were found in our study, of which Pachyneuron aphidis (Bouché), Syrphophagus species and Dendrocerus laticeps (Hedicke) were the dominant species. The composition of the hyperparasitoid community also differed significantly between the seedling and the flowering periods. The description of this parasitoid community-associated assemblage of aphids in cotton fields will facilitate the study of aphid-parasitoid interactions and promote the development of effective cotton aphid management strategies in Xinjiang."
https://openalex.org/W2899829462,"Background In China, internal migrants constitute one-fifth of tuberculosis (TB) patients registered for treatment in web-based TB information management system (TBIMS). Though China added a specific module in the web-based TBIMS in 2009, web-based transfer-out is not specifically recommended in the national guidelines. Objective In this country wide study among all registered migrant TB patients (2014–2015) that were transferred out using web-based TBIMS in China, to determine the i) timing of transfer-out in relation to period of treatment; ii) delay and attrition during transfer interval (between transfer-out and transfer-in); and iii) extent and risk factors for ‘not evaluated’ as the treatment outcome. Methods This was a cohort study involving review of web-based TBIMS data. Modified Poisson regression was used to build a predictive model for risk factors of ‘not evaluated’ as the treatment outcome. Results Among 7 284 patients, 5 900 (81.0%) were transferred out during the first two months after initiation of treatment or before treatment initiation and 7 088 (97.3%) patients had arrived at transfer-in unit. The median transfer interval was three (interquartile range: 0–14) days. Sixteen percent (1 176/7 284) patients had ‘not evaluated’ as their treatment outcome. ‘Not evaluated’ contributed to 66% of the unfavourable outcomes. Patients transferred from referral hospitals, migrated from out of prefecture, transferred out of prefecture, with sputum smear negative pulmonary TB, with TB pleurisy and with long delay between symptom onset and treatment initiation had significantly higher risk of ‘not evaluated’ as the outcome. Conclusion Web-based transfer helped as the delay and attrition during the transfer interval was quite short and treatment outcomes of more than four-fifths of transferred out migrant TB patients were available with transfer-out BMU. Once strategies to address the independent predictors of ‘not evaluated’ treatment outcome are devised, China may consider mandatory use of web-based TBIMS for transferring out migrant TB patients."
https://openalex.org/W2899980773,"Global change processes affect seasonal dynamics of salt marshes and thereby their plant and animal communities. However, these changes have been little investigated for microarthropod communities. We studied the effect of seasonality and changes in sea level on oribatid mites in the natural salt marsh and on artificial islands in the back-barrier environment of the island Spiekeroog (Wadden Sea, Germany). Three zones of the artificial islands were filled with transplanted sods from the lower salt marsh zone and thereby exposed to three different inundation frequencies. We hypothesized that oribatid mite communities will differ along the natural salt marsh vegetation zones [upper salt marsh (USM), lower salt marsh (LSM), pioneer zone (PZ)], which are influenced by different tidal regimes. Accordingly, total oribatid mite densities declined from the USM and LSM to the PZ. Similarly, oribatid mite species compositions changed along the salt marsh transect and also responded to variations in inundation frequency in LSM on artificial islands with typical species of the USM, LSM and PZ being Multioppia neglecta (USM), Hermannia pulchella (LSM), Zachvatkinibates quadrivertex (LSM, PZ) and Ameronothrus schneideri (LSM, PZ). Oribatid mite density in the salt marsh and on the artificial islands was at a maximum in winter and spring; this was due in part to high density of juveniles, pointing to two reproductive periods. We hypothesized that oribatid mite trophic structure changes due to variations in abiotic (e.g., tidal dynamics, temperature) and biotic conditions (e.g., resource availability). Stable isotope (15N, 13C) and neutral lipid fatty acid analyses indicated that oribatid mite species have different diets with e.g., Z. quadrivertex feeding on macroalgae and fungi, A. schneideri feeding on microalgae and bacteria, and Scheloribates laevigatus and M. neglecta feeding on dead organic matter, bacteria and fungi. Overall, the results indicate that oribatid mite species in salt marshes are affected by changes in environmental factors such as inundation intensity, with the effects being most pronounced in species with narrow trophic niches and limited niche plasticity. The results also indicate that oribatid mite communities of the LSM respond little to short-term (one year) changes in inundation frequency."
https://openalex.org/W2900109701,"There is evidence that pepsin can aggravate tonsil hypertrophy. Pepstatin is a potent inhibitor of pepsin activity and could protect patients against reflux tonsil hypertrophy by inhibiting pepsin. We examined the effects of pepstatin on the development of tonsil hypertrophy to investigate pepsin's role in the pathogenesis of tonsil lesions. We investigated whether pepstatin suppresses pepsin-mediated lymphocyte proliferation in tonsil hypertrophy. Forty-nine children with tonsil hypertrophy and twenty-two adults with tonsillitis were recruited to the study prior to surgery. Tonsil tissue from each patient was harvested and assessed for changes in the number of lymphocytes and macrophages in the presence of pepsin and pepstatin. We found that the proportions of CD4- and CD14-positive cells were significantly lower (p < 0.05), but that the proportions of CD19- and CD68-positive cells were significantly higher (p < 0.05), in children than in adults. There were significantly more CD4-positive cells after pepsin treatment, but these numbers were reduced by pepstatin. The levels of both interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) increased significantly in response to pepsin, but were reduced when pepsin was inhibited by pepstatin. The level of IL-10 is reduced in pepsin-treated CD4 cells and the level is restored by pepstatin. IL-2 blocking reduced the increased CD4 cell number by pepsin. But, an additive or a synergic effect is not founded in combined with IL-2 blocking and pepstatin. Pepsin-positive cells did not co-localize with CD20 and CD45 cells, but they were found surrounding CD20- and CD45-positive hypertrophic tonsil cells. Pepsin-positive cells co-localized with CD68-positive cells. It is probable that pepsin from extraesophageal reflux aggravates tonsil hypertrophy and pepstatin exerts a protective effect by inhibiting pepsin activity."

The current study aimed to assess the correlation of clinical course and prognosis of primary and metastatic melanoma with expression of VEGF family and their receptors.A ngTMA block was made from the randomly selected paraffin tissue blocks of the patients with melanocytic nevi, primary and metastatic melanoma. Then sections cut from ngTMA-block were immunohistochemically stained with proper antibodies. Expression of these proteins was investigated using automated image analysis and compared among the study groups.We analyzed the tissue of 238 patients with following diagnoses: 101 (42.4%) with a diagnosis of nevus, 86 (36.1%) Malignant melanoma and 51 (21.4%) metastasis. Median follow-up time for the malignant lesions was 5.71 years. Among the tested antigen, VEGF-C (p = 0.016), VEGF-R2 (p<0.001) and VEGF-R3 (p = 0.002) were significantly higher expressed in the metastatic tissues. When these scores were assessed in multiple regression models, the only independent factor linked to patient's diagnosis was VEGF-R2 (p<0.001). In addition, groups of highly correlated variables (VEGF-C and VEGF-R3, VEGF-A and VEGF-R1) were found to form separate sub-clusters. On the other side, high values of VEGF-C were associated with both overall and disease-free survival with a statically significant HR of 2.76 (95% CI: 1.27, 5.98; p = 0.01) and 2.82 (95%CI: 1.62, 4.91; p<0.001), respectively.This study shows that VEGF-C and VEGF-R2 might represent new prognostic marker in MM. However, further prospective studies are warranted to test their real efficacy as a prognostic marker."
https://openalex.org/W2899742105,"Background A significant portion of patients with schizophrenia who respond to initial antipsychotic treatment acquire treatment resistance. One of the possible pathogeneses of treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) is antipsychotic-induced dopamine supersensitivity psychosis (Ai-DSP). Patients with this disease progression might share some genetic vulnerabilities, and thus determining individuals with higher risks of developing Ai-DSP could contribute to preventing iatrogenic development of TRS. Therefore, we decided to examine whether combinations of functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) known to affect dopaminergic functions are related to Ai-DSP development. Methods In this case-control study, 357 Japanese participants diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were recruited and divided into two groups, those with and without Ai-DSP. As functional SNPs, we examined rs10770141 of the tyrosine hydroxylase gene, rs4680 of the catechol-O-methyltransferase gene, and rs1799732 and rs1800497 of the DRD2 genes, which are known to possess strong directional ties to dopamine synthesis, dopamine degradation and post-synaptic DRD2 prevalence, respectively. Results Among the 357 Japanese patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, 130 were classified as Ai-DSP(+) and the other 227 as Ai-DSP(-). Significantly higher proportions of Ai-DSP(+) patients were found to have the SNP combinations of rs10770141/rs4680 (57.9%, OR2.654, 95%CI1.036–6.787, P = 0.048) and rs10770141/rs4680/ rs1800497 (64.3%, OR4.230, 95%CI1.306–13.619, P = 0.029). However, no single SNP was associated with Ai-DSP. Conclusions We preliminarily found that carrying particular combinations of functional SNPs, which are related to relatively higher dopamine synthesis and dopamine degradation and lower naïve DRD2, might indicate vulnerability to development of Ai-DSP. However, further studies are needed to validate the present results."
https://openalex.org/W2899542061,"Background Consumption of meat prepared by barbecuing is associated with risk of cancer due to formation of carcinogenic compounds including benzo[a]pyrene (BaP). Assessment of a population’s risk of disease and people’s individual probability of disease given specific consumer attributes may direct food safety strategies to where impact on public health is largest. The aim of this study was to propose a model that estimates the risk of cancer caused by exposure to BaP from barbecued meat in Denmark, and to estimate the probability of developing cancer in subgroups of the population given different barbecuing frequencies. Methods We developed probabilistic models applying two dimensional Monte Carlo simulation to take into account the variation in exposure given age and sex and in the individuals’ sensitivity to develop cancer after exposure to BaP, and the uncertainty in the dose response model. We used the Danish dietary consumption survey, monitoring data of chemical concentrations, data on consumer behavior of frequency of barbecuing, and animal dose response data. Findings We estimated an average extra lifetime risk of cancer due to BaP from barbecued meat of 6.8 × 10−5 (95% uncertainty interval 2.6 × 10−7 − 7.0 × 10−4) in the Danish population. This corresponds to approximately one to 4,074 extra cancer cases over a lifetime, reflecting wide uncertainty. The impact per barbecuing event on the risk of cancer for men and women of low body weight was higher compared to higher bodyweight. However, the difference due to sex and bodyweight between subgroups are dwarfed by the uncertainty. Interpretation This study proposes a model that can be applied to other substances and routes of exposure, and allows for deriving the change in risk following a specific change in behaviour. The presented methodology can serve as a valuable tool for risk management, allowing for the formulation of behaviour advice targeted to specific sub-groups in the population."

In-hospital mortality and length of stay (LOS) were compared between the highest and the other quintiles.In-hospital mortality rate and LOS (average±standard deviation) were higher in the fifth quintile than in the others (6.5% vs 20.3%, and 20.8±24.0 vs. 14.9±26.5 days respectively, both p<0.001). After multivariate adjustment on age, gender, principal diagnoses, stage 5 renal failure and type of management, patients in the fifth quintile had a hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] of 1.97 [1.57-2.46] for in-hospital mortality and an adjusted LOS (average±standard error) of 20.4±1.0 vs. 14.9±0.5 days for the other quintiles (p<0.001). Further stratification on the main diagnosis at discharge led to similar findings.Patients with high levels of NT-proBNP are at higher risk of in-hospital mortality and longer LOS, regardless of their clinical characteristics. NT-proBNP level can be a helpful tool for predicting in-hospital patient outcome in unselected adult patients."
https://openalex.org/W2900257618,"Distribution centers (DCs) are an important part of the modern logistics system. The selection of a location for a DC is significant for saving costs and reducing externalities caused by distribution. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid method based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and 2-tuple hybrid ordered weighted averaging (THOWA) to select the location of a DC in a megacity. First, we propose a new set of evaluation criteria integrating economic, political, social and ecological information based on the characteristics of Chinese megacities. Second, subjective criteria weights are calculated by AHP combining the evaluation of logistics experts. Third, experts from academia, enterprise and government assess the performance of alternatives. In addition, the overall evaluation values are aggregated by an improved THOWA operator to rank the alternatives. Finally, we conduct a sensitivity analysis to investigate the influence of criteria weights on the decision-making process. The proposed method is novel and addresses the uncertainty under limited quantitative information, which has the advantages of avoiding information loss and distortion problems in the integrating process and operating linguistic evaluation information effectively. The proposed method can be practically applied by municipal planning departments in deciding on the location of new DCs. A numerical application of the proposed method is provided."
https://openalex.org/W2900446103,"Objective Fructose is commonplace in Western diets and is consumed primarily through added sugars as sucrose or high fructose corn syrup. High consumption of fructose has been linked to the development of metabolic disorders, such as cardiovascular diseases. The majority of the harmful effects of fructose can be traced to its uncontrolled and rapid metabolism, primarily within the liver. It has been speculated that the formulation of fructose-containing sweeteners can have varying impacts on its adverse effects. Unfortunately, there is limited data supporting this hypothesis. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of different fructose-containing sweeteners on the intestinal, hepatic, and oral bioavailability of fructose. Methods Portal and femoral vein catheters were surgically implanted in male Wistar rats. Animals were gavaged with a 1 g/kg carbohydrate solution consisting of fructose, 45% glucose/55% fructose, sucrose, glucose, or water. Blood samples were then collected from the portal and systemic circulation. Fructose levels were measured and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. Results Compared to animals that were gavaged with 45% glucose/55% fructose or sucrose, fructose-gavaged animals had a 40% greater fructose area under the curve and a 15% greater change in maximum fructose concentration in the portal circulation. In the systemic circulation of fructose-gavaged animals, the fructose area under the curve was 17% and 24% higher and the change in the maximum fructose concentration was 15% and 30% higher than the animals that received 45% glucose/55% fructose or sucrose, respectively. After the oral administration of fructose, 45% glucose/55% fructose, and sucrose, the bioavailability of fructose was as follows: intestinal availability was 0.62, 0.53 and 0.57; hepatic availability was 0.33, 0.45 and 0.45; and oral bioavailability was 0.19, 0.23 and 0.24, respectively. Conclusions Our studies show that the co-ingestion of glucose did not enhance fructose absorption, rather, it decreased fructose metabolism in the liver. The intestinal, hepatic, and oral bioavailability of fructose was similar between 45% glucose/55% fructose and sucrose."
https://openalex.org/W2900138726,"Apico-basal polarity establishment is a seminal process in tissue morphogenesis. To function properly it is often imperative that epithelial cells limit apical membrane formation to a single domain. We previously demonstrated that signaling by the small GTPase Cdc42, together with its guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Tuba, is required to prevent the formation of multiple apical domains in polarized Ls174T:W4 cells, a single cell model for enterocyte polarization. To further chart the molecular signaling mechanisms that safeguard singularity during enterocyte polarization we generated knockout cells for the Cdc42 effector protein Par6A. Par6A loss results in the formation of multiple apical domains, similar to loss of Cdc42. In Par6A knockout cells, we find that active Cdc42 is more mobile at the apical membrane compared to control cells and that wild type Cdc42 is more diffusely localized throughout the cell, indicating that Par6A is required to restrict Cdc42 signaling. Par6A, Cdc42 and its GEF Tuba bind in a co-immunoprecipitation experiment and they partially colocalize at the apical membrane in polarized Ls174T:W4 cells, suggesting the formation of a trimeric complex. Indeed, in a rescue experiment using Par6A mutants, we show that the ability to establish this trimeric complex correlates with the ability to restore singularity in Par6A knockout cells. Together, these experiments therefore indicate that a Tuba/Cdc42/Par6A complex is required to ensure the formation of a single apical domain during enterocyte polarization."
https://openalex.org/W2900226329,"The aim of this study was to determine the proportion of patients' caregivers willing to participate in clinical research and examine the possible barriers against recruitment to clinical research in children with inflammatory bowel disease.In a cross-sectional study, caregivers and children with inflammatory bowel disease were surveyed via a questionnaire that addressed parents' willingness to participate in clinical studies and factors influencing their willingness to participate.A total of 118 caregivers to children with inflammatory bowel disease [median age 14.5, IQR: 12.0-15.8 years, 60 boys, 61 (52%) with Crohn's disease] who were followed for a median duration of 1.73 years (IQR 0.4-3.6 years) completed the survey. One hundred and four (88.2%) caregivers answered ""Definitely"" or ""Probably"" to participate in clinical research while 14 (11.8%) were ""Neutral"" or ""Probably"" unwilling to participate (P<0.001). Patients were less likely to participate in clinical research if they had longer disease duration (P = 0.019), or were in clinical relapse (P = 0.03). Parents' education, income, age of children at diagnosis, money incentive, disease relapse and medications at the time of the survey did not have any significant effect on willingness to participate.The majority of children with inflammatory bowel disease and their caregivers are willing to participate in clinical research."
https://openalex.org/W2899980572,"Falls are an important concern for individuals living with HIV (HIV+). The purpose of this study was to understand perceptions of HIV+ individuals who had fallen regarding what caused their falls, prevention strategies that they used, and the impact of falls on their lives. Qualitative Description was the approach best suited to our study. We conducted in-depth interviews with 21 HIV+ individuals aged 47 to 71 years who had fallen within the past two years and who received care in a primary care/HIV clinic. Participants identified causes of falls as intrinsic (HIV, opportunistic infections, antiretroviral therapy, substance use, polypharmacy) or extrinsic (icy sidewalks, wet floors). Among those who felt that their falls could be prevented, prevention strategies included physical therapy and avoiding extrinsic fall risk factors. Some participants, however, felt that their falls could not be prevented. While some participants responded adaptively to falls, for many, the experience of falling was connected with deep feelings of loss and suffering. For these individuals, falls were understood to be “the beginning of the end” and a source of social isolation, changing family roles, diminished sense of self, and stigma."
https://openalex.org/W2899906542,"Abortion-related mortality accounts for 8% of all global maternal deaths and 97% of the estimated 25 million unsafe abortions performed each year occur in low- and middle-income countries. Haiti has the highest rate of maternal mortality in the western hemisphere and to further understand the circumstances of induced abortion in Haiti, the current work uses data from the 2012 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) to describe the methods of induced abortion in Haiti between 2007-2012 and to identify potential factors associated with use of different abortion methods.This is a secondary analysis of nationally representative cross-sectional data from the 2012 Haitian DHS, a two-stage cluster randomized household survey. Analysis included descriptive statistics on participant demographics, methods of abortion, and location of / assistant for the abortion. Multivariate regression was conducted to determine if demographic characteristics were associated with: 1) increased or decreased odds of having an abortion; or 2) increased or decreased odds of reporting an evidence based or non-evidence based method of abortion.Among the 14,287 women of childbearing age who completed the 2012 Haiti DHS survey, 289 women reported having an induced abortion in the previous five years. Recommended methods, manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) or misoprostol alone, were used in 26.6% of the abortions (n = 77). Additionally, 13.8% (n = 40) of abortions used these recommended methods in combination with a non-evidenced based method such as injections, plants or tablets. A total of 92 women had a dilation and curettage (D&C) abortion, either alone (n = 77) or in combination with another method (n = 15) and over a quarter (n = 80) of reported abortions were conducted by non-evidence based methods (n = 80). A majority of abortions using a recommended method were assisted by a relative/friend (n = 28) or were unassisted (n = 34). Most abortions occurred in private homes (n = 174) with hospitals/clinics being the second most common location (n = 84). Women in the middle (OR = 3.3, 95% CI = 2.0-5.6) and highest (OR = 7.4, 95% CI = 4.4-12.3) wealth brackets were more likely to have had an abortion in comparison to women in the lowest wealth bracket. Women who had ever been in a marital union were more likely to have had an abortion than those who had not. The only demographic factor predictive of aborting using a recommended method was living in an urban area, with urban-dwelling women being less likely to use a recommended abortion method (OR = 0.4, 95% CI = 0.2-0.9) in comparison with women living in rural settings.In a nationally representative survey in Haiti, 2% of women of childbearing age reported having an abortion in the five years prior to the survey. A large proportion of these abortions were carried out using non-evidence based methods and over half occurred outside of the formal health care system. Understanding women's attitudes, knowledge and barriers around abortion is paramount to improving knowledge and access to evidence-based abortion care in an effort to decrease maternal morbidity and mortality in Haiti."
https://openalex.org/W2900081756,"A national subsidy policy was introduced in 2007 in Burkina Faso to improve financial accessibility to facility-based delivery. In this article, we estimated the effects of reducing user fees on institutional delivery and neonatal mortality, immediately and three years after the introduction of the policy.The study was based on a quasi-experimental design. We used data obtained from the 2010 Demographic and Health Survey, including survival information for 32,102 live-born infants born to 12,474 women. We used a multilevel Poisson regression model with robust variances to control for secular trends in outcomes between the period before the introduction of the policy (1 January, 2007) and the period after. In sensitivity analyses, we used two different models according to the different definitions of the period ""before"" and the period ""after"".Immediately following its introduction, the subsidy policy was associated with increases in institutional deliveries by 4% (RR = 1.04, 95% CI: 0.98-1.10) in urban areas and by 12% (RR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.04-1.20) in rural areas. The results showed similar patterns in sensitivity analyses. This effect was particularly marked among rural clusters with low institutional delivery rates at baseline (RR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.33-1.55). It was persistent for 42 months after the introduction of the policy but these increases were not statistically significant. At 42 months, the delivery rates had increased by 26% in rural areas (RR = 1.26; 95% CI: 0.86-1.86) and 13% (RR = 1.13; 95% CI: 0.88-1.46) in urban areas. There was no evidence of a significant decrease in neonatal mortality rates.The delivery subsidy implemented in Burkina Faso is associated with short-term increases in health facility deliveries. This policy has been particularly beneficial for rural households."
https://openalex.org/W2900144353,"Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells help protect against certain infections and are related to some autoimmune diseases. Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a relatively rare hematological autoimmune disease associated with low platelet count. We designed a cross-sectional study wherein we examined peripheral blood samples of patients with ITP for the number of MAIT cells (CD3+TCR-Vα7.2+CD161+IL-18Rα+ lymphocytes) and their CD4/8 subsets (by flow cytometry) and levels of cytokines (by multiplex assays). The study cohort included 18 patients with ITP and 20 healthy controls (HCs). We first compared the number of MAIT cells between HCs and patients with ITP and then performed subgroup analysis in patients with ITP. The number of total MAIT cells in patients with ITP was significantly lower than that in HCs (p < 0.0001), and the CD4-CD8+ subset of MAIT cells showed the same trend. Moreover, patients with ITP refractory to prednisolone exhibited a significantly lower number of total MAIT and CD4-CD8+ MAIT cells than patients sensitive to prednisolone. The number of total MAIT and CD4-CD8+ MAIT cells was not correlated with the response to thrombopoietin receptor agonist treatment or with Helicobacter pylori infection. We found no relation between cytokine levels and response to prednisolone treatment, although the levels of IP-10 and RANTES showed a correlation with the number of total MAIT and CD4-CD8+ MAIT cells. In conclusion, total MAIT and CD4-CD8+ MAIT cells in peripheral blood were decreased in patients with ITP, correlating with their response to prednisolone."
https://openalex.org/W2900165452,"It is known that when one (or both) variable is multiplicative, the choice of differencing intervals (n) (for example, differencing interval of n = 7 means a weekly datum which is the product of seven daily data) affects the Pearson correlation coefficient (ρ) between variables (often asset returns) and that ρ converges to zero as n increases. This fact can cause the resulting correlation to be arbitrary, hence unreliable. We suggest using Spearman correlation (r) and prove that as n increases Spearman correlation tends to a limit which only depends on Pearson correlation based on the original data (i.e., the value for a single period). In addition, we show, via simulation, that the relative variability (CV) of the estimator of ρ increases with n and that r does not share this disadvantage. Therefore, we suggest using Spearman when one (or both) variable is multiplicative."
https://openalex.org/W2900190900,"Slc29a1 encodes for equilibrative nucleoside transporter subtype 1 (ENT1), the primary mechanism of adenosine transfer across cell membranes. Previous studies showed that tissues isolated from Slc29a1-null mice are relatively resistant to injury caused by vascular ischemia-reperfusion. To determine if there are similar changes in the microvasculature, and investigate underlying mechanism, we examined aortas isolated from wildtype and Slc29a1-null mice. Aorta macrostructure and gene expression were examined histologically and by qPCR, respectively. Wire myography was used to assess the contractile properties of isolated thoracic aortic rings and their response to adenosine under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. In vivo haemodynamic parameters were assessed using the tail-cuff method. Slc29a1-null mice had significantly (P<0.05) increased plasma adenosine (2.75-fold) and lower blood pressure (~15% ↓) than wild-type mice. Aortas from Slc29a1-null mice were stiffer with a smaller circumference (11% ↓), and had an enhanced contractile response to KCl and receptor-mediated stimuli. Blockade of ENT1 with nitrobenzylthioinosine significantly enhanced (by ~3.5-fold) the response of aorta from wild-type mice to phenylephrine, but had minimal effect on aortas from Slc29a1-null mice. Adenosine enhanced phenylephrine-mediated constriction in the wild-type tissue under both normoxic (11.7-fold) and hypoxic (3.6-fold) conditions, but had no effect on the Slc29a1-null aortic aorta. In conclusion, aortas from Slc29a1-null mice respond to hypoxic insult in a manner comparable to wild-type tissues that have been pharmacologically preconditioned with adenosine. These data also support a role for ENT1 in the regulation of the protective effects of adenosine on contractile function in elastic conduit arteries such as thoracic aorta."
https://openalex.org/W2900155579,"DNA damage has been considered to be the universal critical lesion in cells after exposure to ionizing radiation. Measuring radiation-induced DNA damage is important to understand the mechanisms of radiation-induced toxicity and monitor DNA damage repairs. Currently the most widely used methods to measure DNA damage are pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGF) and single-cell gel electrophoresis (also known as the comet assay), both of which are technically challenging and time consuming. Long range quantitative polymerase chain reaction (LR-QPCR) has been used successfully to measure nuclear and mitochondrial DNA damage in mammalian and several model organism cells. The principle of this assay is that DNA lesions will slow down or block the progression of DNA polymerase. Therefore, the amplification efficiency of DNA with fewer lesions will be higher than DNA with more lesions under the same reaction condition. Here, we developed the LR-QPCR assay primers and reaction conditions to quantify DNA damage in Cryptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) after gamma ray exposure. Under these conditions, long DNA targets of C. neoformans H99 and S. cerevisiae BY4741 (17.6 and 16.4 kb for nuclear DNA and 15.3 and 14.6 kb for mitochondrial DNA) were quantitatively amplified using extracted DNA templates, respectively. Two short mitochondrial DNA targets of these two species (207 bp and 154 bp) were also quantitatively amplified and used to monitor the number of mitochondria. Using the LR-QPCR method, we showed that the frequency of radiation-induced mitochondrial and nuclear DNA lesions had a significant linear correlation with the radiation doses (from 500 Gy to 3000 Gy) in both species. Furthermore, the faster disappearance of DNA damage detected in C. neoformans H99S strain compared to H99 strain may help to explain the different radiation sensitivity of these two strains. In summary, we developed a simple, sensitive method to measure radiation-induced DNA damage, which can greatly facilitate the study of radiation-induced toxicity and can be widely used as a dosimetry in radiation-induced cell damage."
