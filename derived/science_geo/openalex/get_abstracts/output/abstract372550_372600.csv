https://openalex.org/W2036210716,"Michael Bamshad, Jay Shendure and colleagues report the first application of exome resequencing to identify the cause of a mendelian disorder. They sequenced the exomes of four individuals with Miller syndrome in three independent families and identify mutations in DHODH, a key enzyme in the pyrimidine de novo biosynthesis pathway, as causal for the disorder. We demonstrate the first successful application of exome sequencing to discover the gene for a rare mendelian disorder of unknown cause, Miller syndrome (MIM%263750). For four affected individuals in three independent kindreds, we captured and sequenced coding regions to a mean coverage of 40× and sufficient depth to call variants at ∼97% of each targeted exome. Filtering against public SNP databases and eight HapMap exomes for genes with two previously unknown variants in each of the four individuals identified a single candidate gene, DHODH, which encodes a key enzyme in the pyrimidine de novo biosynthesis pathway. Sanger sequencing confirmed the presence of DHODH mutations in three additional families with Miller syndrome. Exome sequencing of a small number of unrelated affected individuals is a powerful, efficient strategy for identifying the genes underlying rare mendelian disorders and will likely transform the genetic analysis of monogenic traits."
https://openalex.org/W2148641246,"Andrew Singleton, Thomas Gasser and colleagues report results of a genome-wide association study of Parkinson's disease among individuals of European ancestry. They find genome-wide significant associations at two loci, SNCA and MAPT, and provide supporting evidence for a new risk locus on 1q32. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 1,713 individuals of European ancestry with Parkinson's disease (PD) and 3,978 controls. After replication in 3,361 cases and 4,573 controls, we observed two strong association signals, one in the gene encoding α-synuclein (SNCA; rs2736990, OR = 1.23, P = 2.24 × 10−16) and another at the MAPT locus (rs393152, OR = 0.77, P = 1.95 × 10−16). We exchanged data with colleagues performing a GWAS in Japanese PD cases. Association to PD at SNCA was replicated in the Japanese GWAS1, confirming this as a major risk locus across populations. We replicated the effect of a new locus detected in the Japanese cohort (PARK16, rs823128, OR = 0.66, P = 7.29 × 10−8) and provide supporting evidence that common variation around LRRK2 modulates risk for PD (rs1491923, OR = 1.14, P = 1.55 × 10−5). These data demonstrate an unequivocal role for common genetic variants in the etiology of typical PD and suggest population-specific genetic heterogeneity in this disease."

https://openalex.org/W2105031232,"Previous work has suggested that visual attention improves behavioral performance by increasing the firing rates of individual sensory neurons. Recording from populations of neurons in monkey visual area V4, this study finds that most of the attentional improvement in the population signal results from decreases in interneuronal correlations. Visual attention can improve behavioral performance by allowing observers to focus on the important information in a complex scene. Attention also typically increases the firing rates of cortical sensory neurons. Rate increases improve the signal-to-noise ratio of individual neurons, and this improvement has been assumed to underlie attention-related improvements in behavior. We recorded dozens of neurons simultaneously in visual area V4 and found that changes in single neurons accounted for only a small fraction of the improvement in the sensitivity of the population. Instead, over 80% of the attentional improvement in the population signal was caused by decreases in the correlations between the trial-to-trial fluctuations in the responses of pairs of neurons. These results suggest that the representation of sensory information in populations of neurons and the way attention affects the sensitivity of the population may only be understood by considering the interactions between neurons."

https://openalex.org/W2102092558,"Cortical GABAergic dysfunction may underlie the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia. Here, we characterized a mouse strain in which the essential NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) was selectively eliminated in 40-50% of cortical and hippocampal interneurons in early postnatal development. Consistent with the NMDAR hypofunction theory of schizophrenia, distinct schizophrenia-related symptoms emerged after adolescence, including novelty-induced hyperlocomotion, mating and nest-building deficits, as well as anhedonia-like and anxiety-like behaviors. Many of these behaviors were exacerbated by social isolation stress. Social memory, spatial working memory and prepulse inhibition were also impaired. Reduced expression of glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 and parvalbumin was accompanied by disinhibition of cortical excitatory neurons and reduced neuronal synchrony. Postadolescent deletion of NR1 did not result in such abnormalities. These findings suggest that early postnatal inhibition of NMDAR activity in corticolimbic GABAergic interneurons contributes to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia-related disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2041464948,"Spontaneous activity plays an important role in the function of neural circuits. Although many similarities between spontaneous and sensory-evoked neocortical activity have been reported, little is known about consistent differences between them. Here, using simultaneously recorded cortical populations and morphologically identified pyramidal cells, we compare the laminar structure of spontaneous and sensory-evoked population activity in rat auditory cortex. Spontaneous and evoked patterns both exhibited sparse, spatially localized activity in layer 2/3 pyramidal cells, with densely distributed activity in larger layer 5 pyramidal cells and putative interneurons. However, the propagation of spontaneous and evoked activity differed, with spontaneous activity spreading upward from deep layers and slowly across columns, but sensory responses initiating in presumptive thalamorecipient layers, spreading rapidly across columns. The similarity of sparseness patterns for both neural events and distinct spread of activity may reflect similarity of local processing and differences in the flow of information through cortical circuits, respectively.

The six-layered structure of the neocortex is one of the most prominent features of the mammalian brain. However, the role of laminar architecture in cortical information processing is still elusive. Pyramidal cells (PCs)—the principal neurons of the neocortex—show strong heterogeneity in morphology, physiology, and gene expression patterns both between and within layers (Douglas and Martin, 2004Douglas R.J.

How do these PC populations differ in the strategies they use to encode information? And how does sensory and nonsensory information propagate through such diverse cortical circuits? Although techniques to record from large neuronal populations are now well established, development of the concepts and quantitative metrics needed to characterize the structure of spiking activity in neuronal populations is still ongoing (Averbeck et al., 2006Averbeck B.B.

In a “sparse” representation, signals are represented by the activity of a small fraction of neurons; the other end of this spectrum is a “dense” representation, in which signals are encoded by changes in the firing rates of large numbers of neurons. Recent experimental evidence favors sparse coding in several cortical regions, in multiple species, including rodents (Brecht, 2007Brecht M. Barrel cortex and whisker-mediated behaviors.Curr. Opin.

Furthermore, recordings of individual neurons suggest that the sparseness of sensory-evoked responses may vary between cortical neuronal classes, in multiple sensory cortices (Brecht, 2007Brecht M.

The activity of the cortex, however, is not strictly determined by sensory input, and neocortical populations show coordinated, spontaneous patterns of spiking activity in the absence of specific sensory stimuli or motor outputs. Spontaneous neural activity has been best characterized during slow-wave sleep and anesthesia, where it is organized around an alternation of “up states” of generalized depolarization and spiking, and “down states” of hyperpolarization and neuronal silence (Hoffman et al., 2007Hoffman K.L. Battaglia F.P. Harris K. MacLean J.N. Marshall L. Mehta M.R. The upshot of up states in the neocortex: from slow oscillations to memory formation.J.

USA. 2006; 103: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Recent studies have suggested that the structure of spontaneous population activity in many ways mimics that of sensory responses (Curto et al., 2009Curto C. Sakata S. Marguet S. Itskov V.

Internal dynamics determine the cortical response to thalamic stimulation.Neuron. 2005; 48: 811-823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). However, given the likely different roles of spontaneous and evoked activity, one might also expect consistent differences between them. One attractive candidate is their structure with respect to cortical layers. Sensory responses are driven mainly through inputs from thalamus, which terminate nonuniformly across layers, with primary thalamic afferents showing a bias in auditory cortex toward lower layer (L) 3 and L4 and the L5/6 border (Kimura et al., 2003Kimura A.

Res. 2007; 229: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). By contrast, spontaneous activity is believed to depend primarily on corticocortical connections (Sanchez-Vives and McCormick, 2000Sanchez-Vives M.V. McCormick D.A.

Brain Res. 1991; 86: 483-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). How these anatomical differences affect the laminar structure of spontaneous and evoked population activity is unclear. Here, we investigate the similarities and differences in laminar structure of evoked and spontaneous population spiking activity in primary auditory cortex of urethane-anesthetized and unanesthetized rats. Spontaneous and evoked firing patterns both exhibited sparse, spatially localized activity in L2/3 pyramidal cells (PCs), with densely distributed activity in larger L5 PCs and putative interneurons (INs). The profile of activity onset across layers, however, varied between the two types of activity, spreading from putative thalamorecipient layers in the case of auditory responses, but upward from deep layers in the case of spontaneous events. These laminar structures of population activity held under both anesthetized and unanesthetized conditions. In the first set of experiments, we combined large-scale extracellular recordings using silicon multisite electrodes (“silicon probes”) (Csicsvari et al., 2003Csicsvari J. Henze D.A. Jamieson B. Harris K.D. Sirota A. Bartho P. Wise K.D. Buzsaki G. Massively parallel recording of unit and local field potentials with silicon-based electrodes.J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 90: 1314-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) with simultaneous juxtacellular recording (Pinault, 1996Pinault D. A novel single-cell staining procedure performed in vivo under electrophysiological control: morpho-functional features of juxtacellularly labeled thalamic cells and other central neurons with biocytin or Neurobiotin.J. Neurosci. Methods. 1996; 65: 113-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar) in urethane-anesthetized rats. We analyzed responses to pure tones of varying frequency and intensity and 1 s long “click-trains” of varying click frequency (Kilgard and Merzenich, 1999Kilgard M.P. Merzenich M.M. Distributed representation of spectral and temporal information in rat primary auditory cortex.Hear. Res. 1999; 134: 16-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, Wang et al., 2008Wang X. Lu T. Bendor D. Bartlett E. Neural coding of temporal information in auditory thalamus and cortex.Neuroscience. 2008; 154: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and spontaneous activity during periods without sound presentation. Morphologically identified PCs recorded with juxtacellular electrodes (“juxtacells”) were grouped based on somatic location: L2/3 PCs (n = 10); L4 PCs (n = 10; consistent with a previous report in auditory cortex [Smith and Populin, 2001Smith P.H. Populin L.C. Fundamental differences between the thalamocortical recipient layers of the cat auditory and visual cortices.J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 436: 508-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar], PCs were the dominant cell type in L4); L5 PCs (n = 28); and L6 PCs (n = 6). L5 PCs were further divided into two classes based on apical dendrite diameter: L5 thick PCs (L5 tPCs; apical dendrite diameter >2.5 μm; n = 9) and L5 slender PCs (L5 sPCs; apical dendrite diameter <2.5 μm; n = 19). Single units recorded extracellularly with silicon probes (“extracells”) were divided into four groups based on spike waveform and estimated somatic location: out of 1379 extracells, 97 were putatively classified as superficial PCs, 655 as deep PCs, 13 as superficial INs, and 100 as deep INs (see Experimental Procedures and Figures S1–S3 for further details; note that to reduce the risk of misclassification, only a subset of extracells were assigned to groups). To investigate whether coding sparseness differs between cell classes, we first characterized the auditory tuning of individual neurons. Figures 1A and 1B illustrate the tuning of five juxtacells with responses typical of their class (see also Figure S4). In general, L2/3 PCs exhibited highly selective responses in both the spectral and temporal domains, while L5 tPCs were broadly tuned to both stimuli. L4 PCs and L5 sPCs were intermediate between two classes, with L5 sPCs showing heterogeneous response profiles. Intriguingly, L6 PCs showed strikingly different response profiles than other classes, typically without clear frequency-tuned responses (5/6 cells), but sometimes responding to tones and clicks after an ∼200 ms delay (2/6 cells; Figure 1B). While our juxtacellular recordings did not yield a large enough number of morphologically identified interneurons to perform statistical analyses (n = 4), putative INs could be identified in large-scale extracellular recordings by spike waveform (Figure S3). Figure 1C shows the spectral tuning of illustrative putative PCs and INs of superficial and deep layers (see also Figure S5). The firing rates and tuning sharpness of putative PCs did not differ significantly from those of morphologically identified PCs of the corresponding layers (Figure S6); the tuning of putative INs, however, differed from that of PCs, with superficial putative INs showing broader tuning, more similar to deep PCs than to superficial PCs. The above examples thus suggest that coding sparseness differs between cortical cell classes. We next set out to quantify this impression. Several measures of coding sparseness have been described (Olshausen and Field, 2004Olshausen B.A. Field D.J. Sparse coding of sensory inputs.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar, Willmore and Tolhurst, 2001Willmore B. Tolhurst D.J. Characterizing the sparseness of neural codes.Network. 2001; 12: 255-270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because we will later compare the sparseness of evoked responses and spontaneous events, for which standard measures are not applicable, we used a “response probability” measure, defined as the probability that a neuron would fire at least one spike in response to any given stimulus presentation (Figure 2A). For juxtacells, this analysis supported the visual impression conveyed by the example neurons, with L2/3 and L6 PCs showing sparsest activity (i.e., lowest response probabilities) and L5 tPCs the densest activity (i.e., highest response probabilities). For extracells, consistent results were observed: response probability of putative superficial PCs closely matched that of morphologically identified L2/3 PCs, and deep PCs showed response probability intermediate between identified L5 sPCs and tPCs, consistent with the extracellularly recorded population being primarily a mixture of these classes. Putative INs of both layers showed response probability similar to that of deep PCs rather than superficial PCs (Figure 2A). The dependence of response probability on cell class was similar for both tone and click train stimuli (Figure 2B; see Experimental Procedures). Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) revealed that this did not simply reflect a common effect of cell class (p < 0.0001), suggesting that sparseness was correlated between stimulus types even within neurons of a single morphological class. Similar results were obtained using several other sparseness measures (Figure S7). Sparseness measures do not fully summarize the character of a neuron's sensory tuning; for example, while the measured sparseness of L2/3 and L6 PCs was not significantly different, visual examination of their spectral tuning suggested that L6 PCs (but not L2/3 PCs) carry little information about stimuli during onset periods. To quantify this, we adopted an information-theoretic approach to estimate how well we could predict the cells' response (i.e., spike count) from the presented tones on single-trial basis (Figure 2C; see Experimental Procedures). The results of this analysis were again consistent with the examples of Figure 1B: predictability measured in bits per spike was highest in L2/3 PCs (Figure 2C), consistent with sharpest tuning in these neurons; L6 PCs typically carried little information about tone identity (Figure 2C). Thus, we found clear laminar differences in auditory responses, with sparse and more informative activity in L2/3 PCs and denser activity in larger L5 PCs and putative INs. We next asked whether the patterns of sparseness described above also apply to spontaneous activity patterns. We began by examining patterns of multiunit activity (MUA), recorded with linear multisite electrodes (Figure 3A). As previously described (Luczak et al., 2009Luczak A. Bartho P. Harris K.D. Spontaneous events outline the realm of possible sensory reponses in neocortical populations.Neuron. 2009; 62: 413-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), spontaneous activity within presumptive L5 consisted of an alternation between periods of network silence (“down states”) and generalized spiking activity (“up states,” see Figure S8 for further information; note that what we refer to as “up states” are likely to include the “bumps” described by DeWeese and Zador, 2004DeWeese M.R. Zador A.M. Shared and private variability in the auditory cortex.J. Neurophysiol. 2004; 92: 1840-1855Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, DeWeese and Zador, 2006DeWeese M.R. Zador A.M. Non-Gaussian membrane potential dynamics imply sparse, synchronous activity in auditory cortex.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 12206-12218Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Some but not all up states visible in deep layers were accompanied by activity in the immediately overlying superficial layers. Figure 3B shows a histogram of normalized MUA rate in both layers during the first 50 ms of all detected up states. For deep layer activity, the histogram had a broad distribution; for superficial layer activity, however, the histogram showed a major peak at 0, confirming that many up states did not cause measurable superficial spiking activity (see also Figure S9). To investigate the participation of different identified cell classes in up states, we again used a response probability measure, here defined as the probability a cell would fire at least one spike in any given up state. A similar pattern of sparseness was seen as for auditory responses, with L2/3 and L6 PCs showing the lowest response probability and L5 tPCs the highest (Figure 3C). Response probability was correlated on a cell-to-cell basis between spontaneous and auditory-evoked activity (Figure 3D). Again, this did not simply reflect the common effect of cell class on response probability (ANCOVA, p < 0.05 for tones and up states; p < 0.05 for click trains and up states), suggesting that consistent variations in sparseness both between and within cell classes were preserved in spontaneous and evoked activity. The above analyses showed that the pattern of sparseness across cortical cell classes was similar between evoked and spontaneous activity. However, we observed a clear difference between these two types of events in the propagation of activity between layers. Figure 4A shows examples of laminar MUA traces during successive evoked and spontaneous spiking events. At the onset of auditory responses, activity originated in the upper middle and a part of deep layers, locations that also corresponded to the locations of early sinks revealed by current source density (CSD) analysis (Figure S10). Activity at up state onset, however, was first seen in the deep layers and spread upward (Figure 4A). To quantify the difference between these patterns, we computed a “peak latency” measure, defined as median MUA spike time in a 50 ms window after event onset, as a function of putative laminar location (Figures 4B and 4C; for different measures of latency see Figure S11). This analysis confirmed a significant difference in laminar temporal profile between the onset of up states and auditory-evoked responses (Figure 4C). The observed laminar profile of auditory responses was similar across responses to clicks and multiple tone frequencies and intensities that evoked spiking responses (Figure S12), as well as between experiments (Figure S10). The results described above focused on the properties of individual neurons, and the coordination of neurons within a single cortical column, but not the organization of activity across multiple columns. For example, sparse firing of superficial PCs could reflect either spatially localized or distributed activity (Figure 5A). Because primary auditory cortex is tonotopically organized (Schreiner et al., 2000Schreiner C.E. Read H.L. Sutter M.L. Modular organization of frequency integration in primary auditory cortex.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 501-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), we expected that, for tone responses, activity should be spatially localized; however, the spatial structure of click responses and up states and the organization of trial-to-trial response variations was not obvious a priori. To address this issue, we used spike-sorted extracellular population activity recorded from multishank silicon probes (Figure 5B). Visual examination of rasters suggested spiking activity in superficial layers to be locally clustered compared with deep layers, for up states as well as responses to tones and clicks (Figure 5B). To quantify this impression, we performed a correlation analysis on spike counts in the 50 ms period following event onsets (Figure 5C). For up states, correlations between pairs of superficial cells were much stronger for local pairs recorded from the same shank (estimated spacing <∼50 μm) (Henze et al., 2000Henze D.A. Borhegyi Z. Csicsvari J. Mamiya A. Harris K.D. Buzsaki G. Intracellular features predicted by extracellular recordings in the hippocampus in vivo.J. Neurophysiol. 2000; 84: 390-400PubMed Google Scholar) than for distal pairs from separate shanks (estimated spacing >∼200 μm); in deep layers, however, there was only a subtle difference between local and distal correlations. For sensory coding, two types of correlations are typically distinguished: similarity of average tuning curves (“signal correlations”) and correlated variability between response to repetitions of a particular stimulus (“noise correlations”) (Averbeck et al., 2006Averbeck B.B.

https://openalex.org/W2058113433,"The regulated trafficking of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) to synapses is thought to underlie the enhanced transmission in long-term potentiation (LTP), a cellular model of memory. However, there is controversy regarding the nonsynaptic site, either on the surface or intracellularly, from which AMPARs move into synapses during LTP. Using recombinant surface-fluorescent receptors in organotypic rat hippocampal slices, we show that the majority of AMPARs incorporated into synapses during LTP is from lateral diffusion of spine surface receptors containing GluR1, an AMPAR subunit. Following synaptic potentiation, AMPARs in intracellular pools containing GluR1 are driven to the surface primarily on dendrites. These exocytosed receptors likely serve to replenish the local extrasynaptic pool available for subsequent bouts of plasticity. These results clarify the role of intracellular and surface AMPARs during synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2027275070,"In a mouse model of Huntington's disease, synaptic activation of NMDA receptors induces the formation of huntingtin-containing inclusions, rendering neurons more resistant to death in vivo and in vitro. In contrast, stimulation of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors increases neuronal vulnerability by preventing inclusion formation. Huntington's disease is caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the gene encoding huntingtin (HTT), resulting in loss of striatal and cortical neurons. Given that the gene product is widely expressed, it remains unclear why neurons are selectively targeted. Here we show the relationship between synaptic and extrasynaptic activity, inclusion formation of mutant huntingtin protein (mtHtt) and neuronal survival. Synaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate–type glutamate receptor (NMDAR) activity induces mtHtt inclusions via a T complex-1 (TCP-1) ring complex (TRiC)-dependent mechanism, rendering neurons more resistant to mtHtt-mediated cell death. In contrast, stimulation of extrasynaptic NMDARs increases the vulnerability of mtHtt-containing neurons to cell death by impairing the neuroprotective cyclic AMP response element–binding protein (CREB)–peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) cascade and increasing the level of the small guanine nucleotide–binding protein Rhes, which is known to sumoylate and disaggregate mtHtt. Treatment of transgenic mice expressing a yeast artificial chromosome containing 128 CAG repeats (YAC128) with low-dose memantine blocks extrasynaptic (but not synaptic) NMDARs and ameliorates neuropathological and behavioral manifestations. By contrast, high-dose memantine, which blocks both extrasynaptic and synaptic NMDAR activity, decreases neuronal inclusions and worsens these outcomes. Our findings offer a rational therapeutic approach for protecting susceptible neurons in Huntington's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2075449089,"Mechanical pain contributes to the morbidity associated with inflammation and trauma, but primary sensory neurons that convey the sensation of acute and persistent mechanical pain have not been identified. Dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons transmit sensory information to the spinal cord using the excitatory transmitter glutamate1, a process that depends on glutamate transport into synaptic vesicles for regulated exocytotic release. Here we report that a small subset of cells in the DRG expresses the low abundance vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT3 (also known as SLC17A8). In the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, these afferents project to lamina I and the innermost layer of lamina II, which has previously been implicated in persistent pain caused by injury2. Because the different VGLUT isoforms generally have a non-redundant pattern of expression3, we used Vglut3 knockout mice to assess the role of VGLUT3+ primary afferents in the behavioural response to somatosensory input. The loss of VGLUT3 specifically impairs mechanical pain sensation, and in particular the mechanical hypersensitivity to normally innocuous stimuli that accompanies inflammation, nerve injury and trauma. Direct recording from VGLUT3+ neurons in the DRG further identifies them as a poorly understood population of unmyelinated, low threshold mechanoreceptors (C-LTMRs)4,5. The analysis of Vglut3-/- mice now indicates a critical role for C-LTMRs in the mechanical hypersensitivity caused by injury."
https://openalex.org/W2007839979,"Curli are functional extracellular amyloid fibers produced by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) and other Enterobacteriaceae. Ring-fused 2-pyridones, such as FN075 and BibC6, inhibited curli biogenesis in UPEC and prevented the in vitro polymerization of the major curli subunit protein CsgA. The curlicides FN075 and BibC6 share a common chemical lineage with other ring-fused 2-pyridones termed pilicides. Pilicides inhibit the assembly of type 1 pili, which are required for pathogenesis during urinary tract infection. Notably, the curlicides retained pilicide activities and inhibited both curli-dependent and type 1-dependent biofilms. Furthermore, pretreatment of UPEC with FN075 significantly attenuated virulence in a mouse model of urinary tract infection. Curli and type 1 pili exhibited exclusive and independent roles in promoting UPEC biofilms, and curli provided a fitness advantage in vivo. Thus, the ability of FN075 to block the biogenesis of both curli and type 1 pili endows unique anti-biofilm and anti-virulence activities on these compounds."

Previous studies identified brain regions encoding such values. Here we verify that these regions can valuate various categories of objects and further test whether they still express preferences when attention is diverted to another task.

After scanning, the same pictures were presented in pairs, and subjects had to choose the one they preferred. We isolated brain regions that reflect both values (pleasantness ratings) and preferences (binary choices).

In classical economic theory (Samuelson, 1938Samuelson P.A. The numerical representation of ordered classifications and the concept of utility.Rev. Econ. Stud. 1938; 6: 65-70Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, Von Neumann and Morgenstern, 1944Von Neumann J. Morgenstern O. Theory of Games and Economic Behavior. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ1944Google Scholar), preferences revealed in binary choices are used to rank the value of different options on a common scale: choosing option A over option B means that Value(A) is greater than Value(B). This theory suggests the existence of a brain system that encodes the values underlying revealed preferences (Rangel et al., 2008Rangel A. Camerer C. Montague P.R. A framework for studying the neurobiology of value-based decision making.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 9: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). A further question is whether the brain engages in value judgment under all circumstances or only when a choice is to be made (Seymour and McClure, 2008Seymour B. McClure S.M. Anchors, scales and the relative coding of value in the brain.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2008; 18: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Neural correlates of both value judgments and choices/preferences have been largely investigated but mostly in separate studies. Interestingly, regions comprising the limbic fronto-striatal circuits have been implicated in both valuation and choice tasks (Hare et al., 2009Hare T.A. Camerer C.F. Rangel A.

These regions include the ventral striatum (VS) and its main inputs, namely the ventral prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus (Alexander et al., 1986Alexander G.E. DeLong M.R. Strick P.L.

The primate basal ganglia: parallel and integrative networks.J. Chem. Neuroanat. 2003; 26: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). More precisely, activity in these regions has been found to reflect values in a parametric manner, both when subjects were asked to rate how much they liked visual items and when they were instructed to choose a preferred item from a pair. However, it is unclear whether these value-related activations emerge naturally or if they are artificially elicited by the instructions given to subjects. In other words, the question is whether the same regions also encode values when it is not relevant for the ongoing task, i.e., when subjects are engaged in a distractive task. The aim of the present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was to identify such an automatic valuation system in the human brain. We investigated value encoding in a noneconomic context, with the hypothesis that the same regions would be involved as in economic situations, for instance when choosing whether or not to purchase a good. A requisite for a brain valuation system (BVS) is to reflect both values, as explicitly reported by subjects, and preferences, as revealed in binary choices. We imposed the constraint that value and preference encoding should be generic, in accordance to the common neural currency hypothesis, which assumes that a same brain system can appraise options associated with different categories of pleasurable experiences (Montague and Berns, 2002Montague P.R.

Various categories of visual stimuli, such as food, faces, paintings, sculptures, scenic views, or vacation projects have been explored to date (Di Dio et al., 2007Di Dio C. Macaluso E. Rizzolatti G.

The neural basis of scene preferences.Neuroreport. 2007; 18: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), but these categories have not been compared in a single experimental design. In the present study, we varied the category of the stimuli presented by including pictures of faces, houses, and paintings. The pictures were chosen so as to allow considerable intersubject variability in expressed preferences, such that the underlying valuation system would reflect personal taste and not commonalities. The pictures were displayed one by one in the MRI scanner and subjects had to rate either their pleasantness (explicit task) or their age (distractive task) on an analog scale (Figure 1). After the scanning sessions, the same pictures were presented in pairs, and subjects had to choose the one they preferred. We then searched for those brain regions that encoded both values and preferences, across subjects and regardless of task and category. These brain regions would hence constitute a valuation system that is both generic and automatic. We conducted several analyses to establish the validity of the experimental design. First, to verify that age and pleasantness are orthogonal dimensions of our stimuli, we corroborated that there was no correlation between age and pleasantness ratings (r = 0.049, p = 0.35), thus discarding the possibility that age ratings may be linked to affective values. Pleasantness ratings were neutral on average (0.56 ± 2.51) but extended over a wide range along the scale (Figure 2A). The interstimuli standard deviation (2.51) was similar to the intersubject one (2.78), indicating that, as each subject used a large range of values to rate the different stimuli, a same stimulus was variably rated by the different subjects. The variability was smaller for the age ratings (interstimuli SD: 1.32, intersubjects SD: 1.35), probably because this is a more objective dimension. Next, we verified that preferences were not shared between subjects, but revealed personal tastes. To this aim the comparisons were fixed in the choice task: all subjects were presented with the same pairs of pictures. Each picture was presented once in an easy comparison and once in a hard comparison, making a total of 180 easy and 180 hard comparisons for all 360 pictures (120 pictures per category). Easy and hard comparisons were generated from the average picture rankings obtained in a pilot study. In the easy comparisons, the pictures to be compared had an adjacent position in the ranking, whereas in the hard comparisons they were 60 positions apart (the one half mark of the ranking for a given category). The median agreement rate (proportion of subjects choosing the same picture) was 60%–65% for hard comparisons and 70%–75% for easy comparisons (Figure 2B). In other words, among the 20 subjects, 12 or 13 chose one picture and 7 or 8 chose the other in a typical hard comparison (14 or 15 and 5 or 6 for an easy comparison, respectively). Thus, preferences were not trivially driven by the stimuli, as different subjects made different choices. Last, in keeping with the hypothesis that pleasantness ratings and preferences are based on the same underlying values, we checked the relationship between the two measures. Prediction scores (proportion of cases where subjects chose A after rating A as greater than B) were 74.7% ± 1.6% for easy comparisons and 68.9% ± 1.4% for hard comparisons. For the 17 subjects who returned 1 month later to repeat the choice task, prediction scores were unchanged: 74.2% ± 1.5% (easy comparisons) and 67.2% ± 1.9% (hard comparisons). Moreover, preferences were found to be relatively stable, as 76.1% ± 1.5% of easy and 71.8% ± 1.7% of hard comparisons elicited the same choice on the immediate (just after scanning) and the delayed (1 month later) choice tasks. All prediction scores were significantly (p < 0.01) above chance level (50%) whatever the delay and comparison, establishing a link between pleasantness ratings and preferences (Figure 2C). This link was further confirmed by calculating the average difference in rating between the preferred and nonpreferred pictures (Figure 2D), which was also significant for the two delays and difficulty levels (all p < 0.001). As expected, this difference was higher for easy relative to hard comparisons (immediate session: +0.94 ± 0.17, t19 = 5.66; delayed session: +1.00 ± 0.15, t16 = 6.47, both p < 0.001). Thus, through introspection, subjects accessed explicit values that were tightly linked to their preferences, even when assessed after a 1 month delay. The link between pleasantness ratings and preferences could also be inferred from decision times. An intuitive rule is that decisions take longer if alternatives have closer values (FitzGerald et al., 2009FitzGerald T.H. Seymour B. Dolan R.J. The role of human orbitofrontal cortex in value comparison for incommensurable objects.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 8388-8395Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), as seen with conflict effects in perceptual decision-making (Gold and Shadlen, 2007Gold J.I. Shadlen M.N. The neural basis of decision making.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 30: 535-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar). We reasoned that the difference in pleasantness ratings (δV), between preferred and nonpreferred pictures (P − NP), should predict response times (RTs) in the choice task. To test this hypothesis, z-scored pleasantness ratings were ranked and divided into 10 subsets of ascending δV for each individual. Correlations with RT were calculated over these 10 data points and tested for significance across subjects. The correlation between δV and RT (Figure 2D) was significant for both the immediate and delayed sessions (immediate: R = −0.49 ± 0.09, t19 = −5.73; delayed: R = −0.41 ± 0.09, t16 = −4.57; both p < 0.001). This suggests that the uncertainty of preferences was expressed as both smaller δV and longer RT. Note that this relation did not hold when preferences contradicted pleasantness ratings (for negative δV). A prerequisite for further examination of the BVS was to verify that the different stimuli categories (face, house, and painting) and the different behavioral tasks (pleasantness and age ratings) activate different brain areas. We first contrasted each stimulus category with the two others, at the time of picture viewing. Consistent with previous studies (Grill-Spector and Malach, 2004Grill-Spector K. Malach R. The human visual cortex.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 649-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, Reddy and Kanwisher, 2006Reddy L. Kanwisher N. Coding of visual objects in the ventral stream.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2006; 16: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), we found significantly different activations in a variety of brain regions (Figure 3): in the occipital cortex (primary and associative visual areas), in the parietal cortex (precuneus and supramarginal gyrus), in the temporal cortex (fusiform, lingual, and para-hippocampal gyri), in the amygdala, and in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Thus, the different categories of stimuli matched the functional specialization of different brain regions, mostly in the ventral and dorsal visual streams. We next contrasted expression patterns for pleasantness versus age ratings, after z-scoring within each subject, task, and category. This contrast was meant to isolate regions that specifically encode subjective values, independent of processes that would be common to age estimation, such as assigning a number to a picture or moving a cursor along a scale. Significant activations (Figure 4A) were seen in a large cluster with main maxima located in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), ACC, VS, amygdala, hippocampus, posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and primary visual cortex (V1). Apart from these last two regions, the neural network encoding subjective values appeared to match the limbic fronto-striatal circuits as described in anatomical studies (Haber, 2003Haber S.N. The primate basal ganglia: parallel and integrative networks.J. Chem. Neuroanat. 2003; 26: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). The two dimensions to be rated in the different tasks (age and pleasantness) thus yielded significantly different activations. There was no activation in the reverse contrast (age versus pleasantness ratings), suggesting that the brain has no general system dedicated to age estimation, or at least not for the wide range of ages (from years to centuries) tested here. Our definition of the BVS included both parametric encoding of subjective values and prediction of preferences in choice tasks. We thus performed a formal conjunction between the above contrast (pleasantness versus age ratings) and a P − NP contrast. Whether a picture was preferred or not was derived from the individual preferences expressed during the postscan choice task that assessed easy comparisons, and was thus unique for each subject. From this conjunction the list of activated regions was restricted to the VMPFC, VS, hippocampus, PCC, and V1 (Figure 4B). Although V1 activation is an interesting example of top-down modulation of early sensory areas, we excluded V1 as probably too specific to the visual nature of our stimuli, and hence less likely to be part of a generic valuation system. The BVS that will be further characterized below therefore includes the VMPFC, VS, hippocampus, and PCC. Note that these regions correspond to the clusters activated in the simple contrast between preferred and nonpreferred pictures, which played a limiting role in the conjunction. The blood oxygen-level dependant (BOLD) signal was deconvolved by fitting a canonical hemodynamic response to every single trial, at the time of picture viewing. The response magnitudes (betas) to all pictures were extracted from spheres centered on the different BVS regions. We analyzed these response magnitudes in relation to pleasantness ratings and preferences. As seen above with RT, correlations between response magnitudes and pleasantness ratings were calculated over 10 data points and tested for significance across subjects (Figure 5). The correlation was highly significant in the VMPFC (R = 0.40 ± 0.06, t19 = 6.23, p < 0.001), VS (R = 0.24 ± 0.05, t19 = 4.89, p < 0.001) and hippocampus (R = 0.28 ± 0.04, t19 = 6.55, p < 0.001), and moderately significant in the PCC (R = 0.14 ± 0.07, t19 = 1.98, p = 0.03). The P − NP contrasts in the easy comparisons were also estimated separately for the different BVS regions (Figure 6A). The contrast was highly significant in all regions (VMPFC: +0.27 ± 0.09, t19 = 2.89, p = 0.005; VS: +0.39 ± 0.10, t19 = 3.86, p < 0.001; hippocampus: +0.30 ± 0.07, t19 = 4.11, p < 0.001; and PCC: +0.19 ± 0.03, t19 = 5.58, p < 0.001).Figure 6Preference Encoding in the Brain Valuation SystemShow full captionRegression coefficients (betas) were contrasted between preferred and nonpreferred pictures (P − NP) in the different brain valuation regions, separately for the different experimental conditions.(A) Comparison between brain regions.

Of course these last results are not surprising, since the BVS regions were selected both to encode subjective values reported as pleasantness ratings and to predict choices in easy comparisons. To get an independent estimation of how good these regions are at encoding preferences, we used the P − NP contrast in the hard comparisons (Figure 6B). Because there was no significant difference in preference encoding between regions (Figure 6B), we pooled them to form a single BVS. This BVS was significantly more activated by pictures that were later preferred in the hard comparisons (+0.17 ± 0.04, t19 = 4.75, p < 0.001). We also verified that the same contrast was still significant for preferences expressed 1 month later for both easy comparisons (+0.20 ± 0.07, t16 = 3.01, p < 0.001) and hard comparisons (+0.10 ± 0.04, t16 = 2.48, p = 0.01). We now turn to testing the hypothesized features of the BVS: personal, generic, and automatic. To assess whether the BVS encodes personal and not shared preferences, the comparisons were split into two subsets below and above the median agreement rate (Figure 6C). Then we tested the P − NP contrast separately for the two subsets. This contrast was significant for both the highly personal (+0.24 ± 0.05, t19 = 5.17, p < 0.001; agreement rate: 58.35% ± 4.98%) and highly shared (+0.21 ± 0.06, t19 = 3.73, p < 0.001; agreement rate: 81.14% ± 8.24%) preferences, with no difference between personal and shared preferences (p = 0.70). This shows that when subjects disagree, the BVS follows the individual and not the average choices. To assess whether the BVS can generically express preferences across categories, we tested the P − NP contrast separately for faces, houses, and paintings (Figure 6D). The contrast was significant for all categories (faces: +0.31 ± 0.10, t19 = 3.08, p = 0.003; houses: +0.22 ± 0.09, t19 = 2.45, p = 0.01; paintings: +0.32 ± 0.08, t19 = 4.07, p < 0.001). There was no difference between categories (faces versus houses: t19 = 0.70, p = 0.48; faces versus paintings: t19 = −0.08, p = 0.93; houses versus paintings: t19 = −0.79, p = 0.44), indicating that the BVS can encode preferences for various types of objects. To assess the automaticity of the BVS (Figure 6E), we tested the P − NP contrast separately for the explicit task (pleasantness rating) and the distractive task (age rating). The contrast was highly significant for both the explicit task (+0.29 ± 0.08, t19 = 3.74, p < 0.001) and the distractive task (+0.28 ± 0.06, t19 = 4.83, p < 0.001), with no difference between the two (t19 = 0.15, p = 0.88). Thus, BVS activation encodes preferences, even when it is recorded during a task that does not require assigning subjective values. We checked whether this effect was driven by subjects who performed the pleasantness rating first, which might have primed the BVS. There was a nonsignificant trend (t18 = 1.84, p = 0.08, nonpaired t test) for a higher effect in these subjects, but crucially, the P − NP contrast was significant in both subgroups (age rating first: +0.18 ± 0.07, t9 = 2.56, p = 0.01; pleasantness rating first: +0.38 ± 0.08, t9 = 4.54, p < 0.001). The BVS was therefore automatically engaged during the distractive task, even in subjects who were not aware that they would later have to rate the stimuli's pleasantness and state their preference. Our results provide a confirmation of previous studies that characterized limbic fronto-striatal circuits as a valuation system. These limbic circuits were indentified first by axon tracing in monkeys (Alexander et al., 1986Alexander G.E. DeLong M.R. Strick P.L.

Different functional partitions of these circuits have been proposed (Brown and Pluck, 2000Brown R.G. Pluck G.

Considerable evidence from both human and nonhuman species supports the idea that the limbic circuit is involved in reward processing (Daw and Doya, 2006Daw N.D. Doya K.

Here we found that at least three components of this limbic circuit, the hippocampus, VS, and VMPFC, reflected subjective values assigned to visual items that are not universal rewards such as food or money.

Cross-modal modulation can similarly enhance a neuronal representation, and this process can also operate at the primary cortical level. Phase reset of ongoing neuronal oscillatory activity has been shown to be an important element of the underlying modulation of local cortical excitability in both cases. We investigated the influence of attention on oscillatory phase reset in primary auditory and visual cortices of macaques performing an intermodal selective attention task. In addition to responses “driven” by preferred modality stimuli, we noted that both preferred and nonpreferred modality stimuli could “modulate” local cortical excitability by phase reset of ongoing oscillatory activity, and that this effect was linked to their being attended. These findings outline a supramodal mechanism by which attention can control neurophysiological context, thus determining the representation of specific sensory content in primary sensory cortex.

Imagine a couple dancing: one of the dancers has to lead, and set the rhythm for the other, to avoid confusion. Similar to this scenario, our hypothesis is that at any given moment there also tends to be a leading sense orchestrating the oscillatory dynamics that form the electrophysiological context of neural processing. This would enable the concerted control of excitability in cortical areas processing modality specific properties of a multisensory object, thereby resulting in low-level multisensory interactions and an efficient merging of information at higher levels of processing. Several lines of research provide the backbone of this hypothesis. It has long been known that field potentials arise from the summation of postsynaptic potentials, spontaneous neuronal membrane potential fluctuations, and spike afterpotentials in the brain (e.g., Mitzdorf, 1985Mitzdorf U.

By now, ample evidence supports the proposition which is almost as old as the electroencephalogram (EEG) itself (Bishop, 1933Bishop G. Cyclic changes in excitability of the optic pathway of the rabbit.Am. J. Physiol. 1933; 103: 213-224Google Scholar), that cortical excitability is “slave to the rhythm” of ongoing neuronal oscillations, meaning that rhythmically fluctuating cortical excitability is controlled by oscillations that are detectable in local field potentials or the EEG (Steriade et al., 1993Steriade M.

These studies support the hypothesis first proposed by Buzsáki and Chrobak, 1995Buzsáki G. Chrobak J.J. Temporal structure in spatially organized neuronal ensembles: a role for interneuronal networks.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 504-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar that background, or ongoing neuronal network oscillations constitute the “context” that affects processing of the “content” conveyed by specific sensory inputs. However, if the neurophysiological context was independent of what is happening in the world around us, it could still be considered as neatly organized noise that randomly amplifies or attenuates neuronal responses, leading to the formation of unstable sensory representations. A number of studies show that this is not the case. Rather, there is a two way interaction between the neurophysiological context and the sensory inputs that assures the most effective sampling of our environment (Lakatos et al., 2007Lakatos P. Chen C.M. O'Connell M.N. Mills A. Schroeder C.E.

Spike-phase coding boosts and stabilizes information carried by spatial and temporal spike patterns.Neuron. 2009; 61: 597-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). One side of this interaction is the effect of the context on sensory inputs, while the other is the effect of sensory inputs on the neurophysiological context. The ability of sensory inputs to modulate the context provides a link between the temporal structure (e.g., speech) or rhythmical sampling (e.g., sniffing or saccades) of sensory information and the rhythmically changing excitability of the neuronal ensembles involved in the processing of this information. This alignment of the neurophysiological context with key external events ensures the most effective processing of sensory inputs or input patterns that modulate the context (Schroeder et al., 2008Schroeder C.E.

The mechanism by which sensory inputs can interact with the context is the phase reset of ongoing neuronal oscillations (Sayers et al., 1974Sayers B.M. Beagley H.A. Henshall W.R. The mechansim of auditory evoked EEG responses.Nature. 1974; 247: 481-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, Basar, 1980Basar E.

Mining event-related brain dynamics.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2004; 8: 204-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). Results from multisensory studies demonstrate that besides preferred modality stimuli, the context can be modulated by cross-modal inputs related to nonpreferred modality stimuli already at the level of primary cortical areas (Lakatos et al., 2007Lakatos P. Chen C.M. O'Connell M.N. Mills A. Schroeder C.E. Neuronal oscillations and multisensory interaction in primary auditory cortex.Neuron. 2007; 53: 279-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, Lakatos et al., 2008Lakatos P.

Logothetis N.K. Visual modulation of neurons in auditory cortex.Cereb. Cortex. 2008; 18: 1560-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). If all sensory inputs had equal access and ability to reset ongoing neuronal oscillations, the context would be degraded to noise by stimuli that continuously bombard our senses. This means that there would be no prevalent rhythm in the EEG, and the neurophysiological context would lose its functionality. However, it is clear that the EEG retains an intricately organized oscillatory structure under a wide range of conditions (e.g., Canolty et al., 2006Canolty R.T. Edwards E. Dalal S.S. Soltani M. Nagarajan S.S. Kirsch H.E. Berger M.S. Barbaro N.M. Knight R.T. High gamma power is phase-locked to theta oscillations in human neocortex.Science. 2006; 313: 1626-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1577) Google Scholar, Lakatos et al., 2008Lakatos P. Karmos G. Mehta A.D. Ulbert I. Schroeder C.E. Entrainment of neuronal oscillations as a mechanism of attentional selection.Science. 2008; 320: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar); thus, the question is: how are inputs that influence ongoing rhythms selected? Sensory inputs must have controlled access to the context to ensure that while some can modulate it, others have no effect. Our hypothesis is that there is a leading sense in perceptual processes that sets the rhythm across ensembles of oscillating neurons, meaning that it has access to, and can shape the neurophysiological context by means of oscillatory phase reset. We propose that the modality of the leading sense is dynamically changing and is determined based on the relative salience of stimuli, as influenced by their physical properties and by attention. Given the profound effect of context on the processing of specific sensory content, control of context by one of the senses can drive facilitation (Nickerson, 1973Nickerson R.S. Intersensory facilitation of reaction time: energy summation or preparation enhancement?.Psychol. Rev. 1973; 80: 489-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), suppression (Colavita, 1974Colavita F.B. Human sensory dominance.Percept. Psychophys. 1974; 16: 409-412Crossref Scopus (314) Google Scholar), or qualitative change (McGurk and MacDonald, 1976McGurk H. MacDonald J. Hearing lips and seeing voices.Nature. 1976; 264: 746-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (3606) Google Scholar) in the perception of co-occurring events in other modalities. The hypothesis of a leading sense is strongly supported by the common finding that attended stimuli in one sensory modality can affect processing of inputs in another modality, while ignored stimuli do not result in similar cross-modal effects (Busse et al., 2005Busse L. Roberts K.C. Crist R.E. Weissman D.H. Woldorff M.G. The spread of attention across modalities and space in a multisensory object.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 18751-18756Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, Talsma et al., 2007Talsma D. Doty T.J. Woldorff M.G. Selective attention and audiovisual integration: is attending to both modalities a prerequisite for early integration?.Cereb. Cortex. 2007; 17: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). To test the specific hypothesis that ongoing oscillatory activity is differentially modulated by attended and ignored stimuli, we analyzed responses to pure tones and light flashes in primary auditory (A1) and visual (V1) cortical areas of macaques, who were performing an intermodal selection task. The monkeys were trained to either attend to a stream of sounds and identify a target while ignoring the simultaneously presented but temporally offset stream of visual stimuli or to attend to visual stimuli while ignoring tones in alternate blocks of trials. Our findings support the hypothesis that the neurophysiological context consisting of a characteristic pattern of ongoing oscillations is accessible to inputs independent of stimulus modality at even the first stage of cortical processing, and that this process is regulated by attention. In the present study we analyzed responses to auditory and visual stimuli in 19 penetrations of area A1 of the auditory cortex and 25 penetrations of area V1 of the visual cortex in three macaques. On alternate trial blocks, the monkeys were attending either to a stream of tones or to a stream of light flashes trying to identify a target, while they were ignoring the simultaneously presented temporally offset stream of stimuli in the other modality. The effect of attention on oscillatory phase reset was evaluated by comparing responses to attended and ignored standard stimuli. Intracortical field potentials and multiunit activity (MUA) profiles were recorded concurrently with linear array multielectrodes. Instead of analyzing the field potentials we calculated current source density (CSD) profiles, which allow better localization and more direct physiological interpretation of transmembrane currents underlying sub- and suprathreshold excitability changes in a neuronal ensemble. Figure 1A illustrates the characteristic difference between responses to attended preferred modality and nonpreferred modality stimuli—a 2 kHz tone and light flash, respectively—in primary auditory cortex. The upper left color-map shows the laminar CSD profile of a typical response to a best frequency or close to best frequency tone. Characteristic of this type of response is the initial sink in lamina 4, signaling the excitatory response of granular layer cells in response to specific “lemniscal” thalamic input, which is followed by later sink-source pairs above and below, signaling di- and trisynaptic activation of supragranular (S) and infragranular (I) neuron populations. This laminar pattern of activation can be regarded as a signature of “feedforward” type activation (Schroeder et al., 1998Schroeder C.E. Mehta A.D. Givre S.J. A spatiotemporal profile of visual system activation revealed by current source density analysis in the awake macaque.Cereb. Cortex. 1998; 8: 575-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, Lakatos et al., 2007Lakatos P. Chen C.M. O'Connell M.N. Mills A. Schroeder C.E. Neuronal oscillations and multisensory interaction in primary auditory cortex.Neuron. 2007; 53: 279-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). The color map below shows the laminar profile of a visual stimulus related response in A1. The high amplitude CSD activity before stimulus onset is partly the result of responses to auditory stimuli that occurred in the −250–−450 ms time frame before the visual stimulus in the mixed train of auditory-visual stimuli (see Experimental Procedures) and partly related to entrainment of neuronal oscillations to the temporal structure of the attended (in this case visual) stimulus stream (Lakatos et al., 2008Lakatos P. Karmos G. Mehta A.D. Ulbert I. Schroeder C.E. Entrainment of neuronal oscillations as a mechanism of attentional selection.Science. 2008; 320: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Despite this ongoing CSD pattern, there is a clear stimulus related response that is very different from the feedforward type activation related to tones. First of all, the amplitude of the response to the visual stimulus is much lower (note that the auditory and visual stimulus related laminar CSD profiles are on a different scale), and it is clearly weighted toward the supragranular layers. Also, the initial stimulus-related activity occurs in these layers, meaning that it is driven by inputs that target supragranular neuronal populations in contrast to specific thalamic inputs (Jones, 1998aJones E.G. Viewpoint: the core and matrix of thalamic organization.Neuroscience. 1998; 85: 331-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Another important difference between responses to preferred and nonpreferred modality stimuli is that while auditory stimuli result in a significant increase of post-stimulus firing, there is no apparent MUA change related to flashes despite the stimulus related CSD response (traces below the laminar profiles in Figure 1A). To determine whether the pattern of MUA responses apparent in Figure 1A, that is, supra- versus subthreshold response to preferred versus nonpreferred modality stimuli, was characteristic of the whole auditory data set, we statistically compared prestimulus (−50–0) and post-stimulus (10–110 ms) MUA amplitudes in our 19 A1 recordings. All A1 sites had significantly different post-stimulus MUA (dependent t test, p < 0.01). Attending to 2 kHz tones resulted in significantly increased neuronal population firing in 10 sites, while the other 9 A1 recording regions showed significantly decreased firing. In contrast, attending to visual stimuli resulted in significantly different MUA responses in only two A1 sites with increased post-stimulus firing. In these cases, rather than having a sharp post-stimulus onset, MUA had the shape of a gradually rising slope around the time when visual stimuli occurred. The fact that there is no significant change in MUA coupled with the supragranularly-weighted post-stimulus CSD pattern (Figure 1A) observed in all our recordings means that while the visual response does modulate net local neuronal excitability indexed by the CSD, in the absence of appropriate auditory input, this does not result in significant changes of neuronal ensemble firing. This is characteristic of a “modulatory” rather than a “driving” type of response. Based on earlier findings, the underlying mechanism of the modulatory response is oscillatory phase reset in the supragranular layers (Lakatos et al., 2007Lakatos P. Chen C.M. O'Connell M.N. Mills A. Schroeder C.E. Neuronal oscillations and multisensory interaction in primary auditory cortex.Neuron. 2007; 53: 279-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Therefore, a modulatory response should be characterized by an increase in phase coherence across trials (indexed by intertrial coherence—ITC), in the absence of pre- to post-stimulus increase in CSD amplitude or MUA. To examine this, we calculated laminar CSD amplitude profiles by averaging single trial analytic CSD amplitudes (Figure 1A, middle). Characteristic of an evoked type response (Makeig et al., 2004Makeig S. Debener S. Onton J. Delorme A. Mining event-related brain dynamics.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2004; 8: 204-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar, Shah et al., 2004Shah A.S. Bressler S.L. Knuth K.H. Ding M. Mehta A.D. Ulbert I. Schroeder C.E.

Neuronal oscillations and multisensory interaction in primary auditory cortex.Neuron. 2007; 53: 279-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar), there is an amplitude increase in all cortical layers in response to auditory stimuli. In contrast, visual stimuli result in no obvious CSD amplitude increase, meaning that although visual stimuli do modulate local net transmembrane current flow in a predictable way (this is why stimulus related activity is evident in the averaged CSD profiles on the left), they do not significantly increase the amplitude of membrane potential fluctuations of the local neuronal ensemble, which would result in increased net transmembrane current flow and hence increased CSD amplitude. The same pattern was observed in all A1 recording sites. When we compared visual stimulus related CSD amplitudes (averaged across all layers and in the 10–110 ms time interval) to baseline, we found no significant pre- to post-stimulus increase in CSD amplitude in any case (dependent t test, p < 0.01). The opposite was true for auditory responses: 15 out of 19 A1 sites showed a significant CSD amplitude increase in response to attended 2 kHz tones. The sites that did not were accompanied by significant MUA decreases (see above). This finding probably reflects the fact that preferred modality stimulus does not equal optimal stimulus and is a consequence of recording from A1 regions which were not tuned to the 2 kHz tone used in the intermodal attention paradigm. In this study we did not differentiate between the two types of responses, since our main results were not different for the 2 (excitatory and inhibitory) groups. Color maps to the right of CSD amplitude maps (Figure 1A) show laminar intertrial coherence (ITC) values—indexing phase similarity across trials—averaged across frequencies from 4 to 100 Hz. While the auditory evoked response is characterized by high ITC values in all cortical layers, “phase locking” of neuronal activity to visual events is only evident in the supragranular layers, which was the case in all of our A1 recordings. Traces below illustrate that the peak of the supragranular ITC is later in the case of visual stimuli, which is to be expected since visual inputs reach cortical areas ∼25 ms later than auditory inputs in macaques. There are two traditional explanations for event-related intertrial coherence or differently put for a predictable CSD pattern across trials: (1) a “stimulus-evoked” response that signals a significantly changed activation of the local neuronal ensemble and is reflected by a waveform that is added to the ongoing activity (e.g., Shah et al., 2004Shah A.S. Bressler S.L. Knuth K.H. Ding M. Mehta A.D. Ulbert I. Schroeder C.E. Neural dynamics and the fundamental mechanisms of event-related brain potentials.Cereb. Cortex. 2004; 14: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) or (2) the reorganization of ongoing neuronal activity by means of oscillatory phase reset (Sayers et al., 1974Sayers B.M. Beagley H.A. Henshall W.R. The mechansim of auditory evoked EEG responses.Nature. 1974; 247: 481-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, Basar, 1980Basar E.

Mining event-related brain dynamics.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2004; 8: 204-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). The CSD amplitude increase that appears in the same locations as the increased ITC in the case of auditory stimuli argues for the former, while the lack of amplitude change coupled with a visual stimulus related increase in ITC agrees for the latter mechanism. We will show that while attended nonpreferred modality stimuli result in pure phase reset, modality specific responses are mixed evoked/reset type. Figure 1B shows laminar CSD, CSD amplitude, and ITC profiles from a representative V1 site. As in auditory cortex, preferred modality stimuli in V1 (light flashes) result in a typical feedforward type response with earliest onset in the granular layers, and later activation of the extragranular layers. Although admittedly not optimal for stimulating visual cortical neurons, light flashes always resulted in an excitatory response in V1, signaled by significantly increased cell firing in the 10–110 ms post-stimulus time interval compared to baseline in all V1 sites analyzed (dependent t test, p < 0.01). In contrast, only 2 out of 25 sites showed significantly different MUA following auditory stimuli, possibly due to a preceding visual response, since visual stimuli could occur 200–400 ms earlier in the stimulus train (see Experimental Procedures). The CSD amplitude profiles in visual cortex (Figure 1B, middle) show a similar pattern to that observed in auditory cortex. There is an amplitude increase throughout the laminar CSD profile in response to preferred modality stimuli, while despite an apparent sink-source pattern, there is no post-stimulus CSD amplitude increase in response to the nonpreferred modality auditory stimuli. Statistical comparison of pre- to post-stimulus CSD amplitudes showed a significant increase in the case of visual stimuli in all V1 locations (dependent t test, p < 0.01), but only in 1 out of 25 sites in the case of auditory stimuli. Laminar ITC profiles (Figure 1B, right) illustrate that as in auditory cortex, preferred modality flashes result in post-stimulus ITC increase across all cortical layers while nonpreferred stimuli result in higher post-stimulus ITC values only in the supragranular layers in the attend condition; this was true for all V1 sites. To summarize, the characteristic differences in responses to preferred and nonpreferred modality stimuli in A1 and V1 are strikingly similar. Most of the time, preferred modality stimuli drive a feedforward type response. This type of response is coupled with significant changes in the amplitude of net transmembrane currents and as a consequence, the population firing rate, which is by definition an evoked type response (Makeig et al., 2004Makeig S.

Neuronal oscillations and multisensory interaction in primary auditory cortex.Neuron. 2007; 53: 279-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). In contrast to evoked type responses, those related to attended nonpreferred modality stimuli cause a predictable (similar across trials) change in neuronal ensemble excitability reflected by a change in the pattern of net transmembrane current flow without any significant associated changes in its amplitude or the ensemble firing rate. This is typical of oscillatory phase reset (Makeig et al., 2004Makeig S. Debener S. Onton J. Delorme A. Mining event-related brain dynamics.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2004; 8: 204-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar, Shah et al., 2004Shah A.S. Bressler S.L. Knuth K.H. Ding M. Mehta A.D. Ulbert I. Schroeder C.E.

Schroeder C.E. Neuronal oscillations and multisensory interaction in primary auditory cortex.Neuron. 2007; 53: 279-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). In the following we will present data showing that both preferred and nonpreferred modality stimuli reset ongoing oscillatory activity, but only if stimuli are attended. Figures 1C and 1D show the same electrophysiological variables as Figures 1A and 1B discussed above, but for ignored standard tones and flashes in areas A1 and V1. Preferred modality stimuli that are ignored evoke smaller amplitude CSD and MUA responses than attended ones, accompanied by smaller ITC in all cortical layers but especially in the supragranular layers. In the case of nonpreferred modality stimuli, there seems to be no organized post-stimulus CSD pattern (color maps on the left), which is supported by the laminar ITC profiles that show no apparent post-stimulus ITC increase in any of the cortical layers. To investigate the effect of attention on the ITC, in each A1 and V1 recording session we selected the electrode site with the largest post-stimulus (10–110 ms) ITC calculated using the pooled responses to nonpreferred modality stimuli (all attended and ignored trials). As mentioned earlier, this electrode site always corresponded to the supragranular layers. Time frequency plots in Figure 2 show pooled ITC values from these supragranular sites in A1"

https://openalex.org/W1997868457,"The use of optical forces to manipulate small particles, including living cells, is an established technique. Until now though, it has proved difficult to manipulate the optical response of photonic structures in a controllable manner; this is because such large forces are required to induce appreciable changes in the geometry of the structure. Now a team from Cornell University has fabricated a resonant photonic silicon nitride structure in which the optical response can be efficiently statically controlled using relatively weak attractive and repulsive optical forces. A static mechanical deformation of up to 12 nanometres in the structure's geometry can be induced with just one milliwatt of optical power, raising the prospect of micro-optomechanical systems with novel and distinct functionalities. Optical forces can be used to manipulate small objects; for instance, in optical tweezers. However, it is challenging to manipulate the optical response of photonic structures using optical forces because of the large forces that are required to induce appreciable changes in the geometry of the structure. Here, a resonant structure made of silicon nitride is demonstrated whose optical response can be efficiently statically controlled using relatively weak attractive and repulsive optical forces. The use of optical forces to manipulate small objects is well known. Applications include the manipulation of living cells by optical tweezers1 and optical cooling in atomic physics2. The miniaturization of optical systems (to the micro and nanoscale) has resulted in very compliant systems with masses of the order of nanograms, rendering them susceptible to optical forces3,4,5,6. Optical forces have been exploited to demonstrate chaotic quivering of microcavities7, optical cooling of mechanical modes8,9,10,11, actuation of a tapered-fibre waveguide and excitation of the mechanical modes of silicon nano-beams12,13. Despite recent progress in this field14,15,16,17, it is challenging to manipulate the optical response of photonic structures using optical forces; this is because of the large forces that are required to induce appreciable changes in the geometry of the structure. Here we implement a resonant structure whose optical response can be efficiently statically controlled using relatively weak attractive and repulsive optical forces. We demonstrate a static mechanical deformation of up to 20 nanometres in a silicon nitride structure, using three milliwatts of continuous optical power. Because of the sensitivity of the optical response to this deformation, such optically induced static displacement introduces resonance shifts spanning 80 times the intrinsic resonance linewidth."
https://openalex.org/W2089233425,"In a new report, Benjamin Alman and his colleagues find that the morphogenic pathway activated by Hedgehog signaling is a key mediator of osteoarthritis, a condition that is marked by irreversible degeneration of the joints and with no current treatment. They also found that blockade of Hedgehog signaling prevented osteoarthritis in a mouse model, suggesting this pathway as a possible target to treat this devastating disease. Osteoarthritis is associated with the irreversible degeneration of articular cartilage. Notably, in this condition, articular cartilage chondrocytes undergo phenotypic and gene expression changes that are reminiscent of their end-stage differentiation in the growth plate during skeletal development1,2. Hedgehog (Hh) signaling regulates normal chondrocyte growth and differentiation3,4,5,6,7,8; however, the role of Hh signaling in chondrocytes in osteoarthritis is unknown. Here we examine human osteoarthritic samples and mice in which osteoarthritis was surgically induced and find that Hh signaling is activated in osteoarthritis. Using several genetically modified mice, we found that higher levels of Hh signaling in chondrocytes cause a more severe osteoarthritic phenotype. Furthermore, we show in mice and in human cartilage explants that pharmacological or genetic inhibition of Hh signaling reduces the severity of osteoarthritis and that runt-related transcription factor-2 (RUNX2) potentially mediates this process by regulating a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motif-5 (ADAMTS5) expression. Together, these findings raise the possibility that Hh blockade can be used as a therapeutic approach to inhibit articular cartilage degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2039767921,"Migrating dendritic cells can adapt their adhesive properties to switch between integrin-dependent and -independent modes of migration. By modulating their actin polymerization dynamics, cells can maintain a steady migration speed through a changing environment. The leading front of a cell can either protrude as an actin-free membrane bleb that is inflated by actomyosin-driven contractile forces, or as an actin-rich pseudopodium, a site where polymerizing actin filaments push out the membrane1,2,3. Pushing filaments can only cause the membrane to protrude if the expanding actin network experiences a retrograde counter-force, which is usually provided by transmembrane receptors of the integrin family4. Here we show that chemotactic dendritic cells mechanically adapt to the adhesive properties of their substrate by switching between integrin-mediated and integrin-independent locomotion. We found that on engaging the integrin–actin clutch, actin polymerization was entirely turned into protrusion, whereas on disengagement actin underwent slippage and retrograde flow. Remarkably, accelerated retrograde flow was balanced by an increased actin polymerization rate; therefore, cell shape and protrusion velocity remained constant on alternating substrates. Due to this adaptive response in polymerization dynamics, tracks of adhesive substrate did not dictate the path of the cells. Instead, directional guidance was exclusively provided by a soluble gradient of chemoattractant, which endowed these 'amoeboid' cells with extraordinary flexibility, enabling them to traverse almost every type of tissue."

https://openalex.org/W2103244356,"Afferent activity can induce fast, feed-forward changes in synaptic efficacy that are synapse specific. Using combined electrophysiology, caged molecule photolysis, and Ca(2+) imaging, we describe a plasticity in which the recruitment of astrocytes in response to afferent activity causes a fast and feed-forward, yet distributed increase in the amplitude of quantal synaptic currents at multiple glutamate synapses on magnocellular neurosecretory cells in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus. The plasticity is largely multiplicative, consistent with a proportional increase or ""scaling"" in the strength of all synapses on the neuron. This effect requires a metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated rise in Ca(2+) in the astrocyte processes surrounding the neuron and the release of the gliotransmitter ATP, which acts on postsynaptic purinergic receptors. These data provide evidence for a form of distributed synaptic plasticity that is feed-forward, expressed quickly, and mediated by the synaptic activation of neighboring astrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2007118279,"The RME1 ATPases are implicated in endocytic recycling. C. elegans RME1 interacts with Amphiphysin to regulate endocytic recycling in vivo and the two proteins cooperate in the generation of cargo carriers in vitro. The interaction is conserved in other eukaryotes. RME-1/EHD1 (receptor mediated endocytosis/Eps15 homology-domain containing 1) family proteins are key residents of the recycling endosome, which are required for endosome-to-plasma membrane transport in Caenorhabditis elegans and mammals. Recent studies suggest similarities between the RME-1/EHD proteins and the Dynamin GTPase superfamily of mechanochemical pinchases, which promote membrane fission. Here we show that endogenous C. elegans AMPH-1, the only C. elegans member of the Amphiphysin/BIN1 family of BAR (Bin1-Amphiphysin-Rvs161p/167p)-domain-containing proteins, colocalizes with RME-1 on recycling endosomes in vivo, that amph-1-deletion mutants are defective in recycling endosome morphology and function, and that binding of AMPH-1 Asn-Pro-Phe(Asp/Glu) sequences to the RME-1 EH-domain promotes the recycling of transmembrane cargo. We also show a requirement for human BIN1 (also known as Amphiphysin 2) in EHD1-regulated endocytic recycling. In vitro, we find that purified recombinant AMPH-1–RME-1 complexes produce short, coated membrane tubules that are qualitatively distinct from those produced by either protein alone. Our results indicate that AMPH-1 and RME-1 cooperatively regulate endocytic recycling, probably through functions required for the production of cargo carriers that exit the recycling endosome for the cell surface."

Confocal and electron microscopic analysis revealed that glial precursors, rather than macrophages, were responsible for clearing most of the dead DRG neurons. Moreover, we identified Jedi-1, an engulfment receptor, and MEGF10, a purported engulfment receptor, as homologs of the invertebrate engulfment receptors Draper and CED-1 expressed in the glial precursor cells. Expression of Jedi-1 or MEGF10 in fibroblasts facilitated binding to dead neurons, and knocking down either protein in glial cells or overexpressing truncated forms lacking the intracellular domain inhibited engulfment of apoptotic neurons. Together, these results suggest a cellular and molecular mechanism by which neuronal corpses are culled during DRG development."

The exhaustive knowledge of the signaling pathways linked to activated GLP-1R within the β-cells is of major importance. In β-cells, GLP-1 activates the ERK1/2 cascade by diverse pathways dependent on either Gαs/cAMP/cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) or β-arrestin 1, a scaffold protein. Using pharmacological inhibitors, β-arrestin 1 small interfering RNA, and islets isolated from β-arrestin 1 knock-out mice, we demonstrate that GLP-1 stimulates ERK1/2 by two temporally distinct pathways. The PKA-dependent pathway mediates rapid and transient ERK1/2 phosphorylation that leads to nuclear translocation of the activated kinases. In contrast, the β-arrestin 1-dependent pathway produces a late ERK1/2 activity that is restricted to the β-cell cytoplasm. We further observe that GLP-1 phosphorylates the cytoplasmic proapoptotic protein Bad at Ser-112 but not at Ser-155. We find that the β-arrestin 1-dependent ERK1/2 activation engaged by GLP-1 mediates the Ser-112 phosphorylation of Bad, through p90RSK activation, allowing the association of Bad with the scaffold protein 14-3-3, leading to its inactivation. β-Arrestin 1 is further found to mediate the antiapoptotic effect of GLP-1 in β-cells through the ERK1/2-p90RSK-phosphorylation of Bad.

GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1), produced by post-translational processing of the proglucagon in enteroendocrine L-cells, is a potent gluco-regulatory peptide hormone.

The fine regulation of ERK1/2 activation is crucial for generating the appropriate physiological outcomes from a particular stimulus. Moreover, the duration and the intensity of the biological responses are in part controlled by the compartmentalization of ERK1/2 (21Werry T.D. Sexton P.M. Christopoulos A. Trends Endocrinol.

In β-cells, GLP-1 has been shown to activate the ERK1/2 cascade by diverse pathways dependent on influx of either calcium, Gαs/cAMP/PKA, or β-arrestin 1, a scaffold protein (17Gomez E. Pritchard C.

However, up to now, how these pathways dictate the duration, the cytoplasmic versus nuclear location, and the ultimate functions of GLP-1-stimulated ERK1/2 activation remains totally unknown. Although many nuclear substrates have been shown to be phosphorylated by ERK1/2 in β-cells, little is known about the identity of ERK1/2 cytosolic substrates. To address these issues, we examined the spatiotemporal regulation of ERK1/2 activation induced by GLP-1 and the potential requirement of ERK1/2 activity in phosphorylation of cytoplasmic targets. In this view, we studied Bad (Bcl-xL/Bcl-2-associated death promoter homolog), a well known ERK1/2 substrate in many cellular systems, localized in the β-cell cytoplasm (24Datta S.R. Ranger A.M.

Bad (Bcl-xL/Bcl-2-associated death promoter homolog, or Bcl antagonist of cell death) was the first proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family to be described, and its proapoptotic activity is regulated by phosphorylation at several sites (24Datta S.R.

Phosphorylation of Bad at Ser-112 favors binding of Bad to the scaffold protein 14-3-3 in the cytoplasm, preventing the translocation of Bad to mitochondria (28Bergmann A. Dev.

This association further induces the release of Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 proteins from Bad, preventing accumulation of apoptotic proteins, such as Bax and Bak, on the mitochondrial membrane, blocking the release of cytochrome c, and inhibiting apoptosis (30Yang E.

Oncogene. 2007; 26: 1324-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in cell survival, Bad has been recently reported to play a pivotal role in the regulation of glucose-induced insulin secretion and β-cell mass (27Danial N.N. Walensky L.D. Zhang C.Y. Choi C.S. Fisher J.K. Molina A.J. Datta S.R. Pitter K.L. Bird G.H. Wikstrom J.D. Deeney J.T. Robertson K. Morash J. Kulkarni A. Neschen S. Kim S. Greenberg M.E. Corkey B.E. Shirihai O.S. Shulman G.I. Lowell B.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). When phosphorylated at Ser-155, Bad nucleates a core complex at the mitochondrial membrane containing the glucokinase, a key component of the β-cell glucose-sensing machinery (27Danial N.N. Walensky L.D. Zhang C.Y. Choi C.S. Fisher J.K. Molina A.J. Datta S.R. Pitter K.L. Bird G.H. Wikstrom J.D. Deeney J.T. Robertson K. Morash J. Kulkarni A. Neschen S. Kim S. Greenberg M.E. Corkey B.E. Shirihai O.S. Shulman G.I. Lowell B.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Hence, it has been proposed that the phosphorylation state of Bad within the β-cells instructs Bad to assume a metabolic role by targeting glucokinase and regulating insulin secretion or alternatively a proapoptotic versus an antiapoptotic role (27Danial N.N. Walensky L.D. Zhang C.Y. Choi C.S. Fisher J.K. Molina A.J. Datta S.R. Pitter K.L. Bird G.H. Wikstrom J.D. Deeney J.T. Robertson K. Morash J. Kulkarni A. Neschen S. Kim S. Greenberg M.E. Corkey B.E. Shirihai O.S. Shulman G.I. Lowell B.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). To date, the upstream signaling events that target Bad phosphorylation and thus control its functional behavior within the β-cells are unknown. Here, we report that GLP-1 stimulates ERK1/2 by two temporally distinct pathways in β-cells. The rapid and transient first phase is mainly mediated by the Gαs/cAMP/PKA pathway and favors the nuclear translocation of the ERK1/2. The sustained and long lasting second phase of ERK1/2 activation is exclusively β-arrestin 1 dependent, is restricted to the β-cell cytoplasm, and enhances the p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (p90RSK) activity. We further report that GLP-1 significantly phosphorylates Bad at Ser-112 but not at Ser-155. The β-arrestin 1-dependent ERK1/2-p90RSK signaling network engaged by GLP-1 phosphorylates Bad at Ser-112 and regulates its binding to the scaffold protein 14-3-3, revealing a new pathway in GLP-1-mediated antiapoptotic effects in β-cells.

WT littermate controls were C57BL/6 mice (5 weeks old) purchased from Charles River (France). All mice used in this study were treated in accordance with European Community guidelines, and the local institution approved the experimentation. Pancreatic islets were isolated from WT and β-arrestin 1 KO mice weighing 30–35 g on the day of killing using collagenase digestion followed by hand picking as described (33Longuet C. Broca C.

Islets were washed and further incubated in groups of 100 islets for various times at 37 °C in KRB buffer supplemented with effectors. Islets were then rapidly centrifuged, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, frozen in N2 liquid, and harvested in cold lysis buffer (1 μl/islet) (33Longuet C. Broca C. Costes S. Hani E.H.

Samples were normalized for protein content by a Bradford protein assay. Equal amounts of lysate proteins were analyzed. For insulin secretion experiments, islets were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C in KRB buffer supplemented with 1.4 mm glucose. Islets were further incubated in 1.4 or 16.7 mm glucose for 20 min. At the end of the stimulation, islets were pelleted by centrifugation and lysed in acid-ethanol for assessment of insulin content. Insulin secretion was quantified using an insulin radioimmunoassay kit purchased from Millipore (Billerica, MA). MIN6 cells (passages 18–28) were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in DMEM containing 25 mm glucose, 15% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin sulfate, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol as described (35Dalle S.

For insulin secretion experiments, MIN6 cells were plated in 24-well plates at a density of 1 × 106 cells/well for 3–5 days. The culture medium was changed 18 h before the experiments. Insulin secretion from MIN6 cells was performed in KRB buffer. The day of the experiment, cells were preincubated for 1 h in KRB buffer at 37 °C. MIN6 cells were then incubated for 2 h in KRB buffer containing various glucose concentrations with or without GLP-1. Insulin in supernatants was measured by a radioimmunoassay using 125I-labeled insulin, rat insulin standard, and anti-insulin porcine antiserum as described (35Dalle S. Smith P. Blache P.

MIN6 cells were grown in 24-well plates for 3–5 days under the same conditions as for insulin release. The medium was changed 1 day before the experiments. On the day of the experiment, cells were incubated in DMEM supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine as an inhibitor of cAMP phosphodiesterase and the test agents. After a 15-min incubation at room temperature, cells were extracted using 60% perchloric acid, the samples were neutralized with 9 n KOH succinylated to increase the sensitivity of the assay (37Delaage M.A. Roux D. Cailla H.L. Folco G. Paoletti R. Molecular Biology and Pharmacology of Cyclic Nucleotides.

The day of the experiment, cells were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C in KRB buffer. The preincubation solution was then replaced by KRB buffer containing 8 μCi/ml 45CaCl2 (5–50 mCi/mg calcium; Amersham Biosciences) and test agents. The reaction was stopped by aspiration of the medium. Cells were rapidly washed with ice-cold buffer (135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm lanthanium chloride, 10 mm HEPES). The cells were then solubilized in KRB buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature. An aliquot of the solution was then assayed for 45Ca2+ content in a β-counter after the addition of a liquid scintillation medium (Amersham Biosciences). β-Arrestin 1 expression was silenced in MIN6 cells using mouse 20–25-nt Stealth siRNA duplexes. The day before transfection, MIN6 cells were seeded in 12-well plates in regular growth medium without antibiotics and grown overnight to reach 30–40% confluence. The day of the experiment, LipofectamineTM2000-siRNA complexes were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. The final concentrations of siRNA tested in MIN6 cells were 25 (0.12 μg), 50 (0.24 μg), or 100 nm (0.48 μg) in each well. Cells were transfected with β-arrestin 1 siRNA or control siRNA (which corresponds to a non-targeting 20–25-nucleotide siRNA designed as a negative control) for 6 h before switching to fresh growth medium, including antibiotics. 72 h after transfection, cells were preincubated for 2 h at 37 °C in KRB buffer and then stimulated with pharmacological agents. After a 2-h stabilization period at 37 °C in KRB buffer, 6-well plates of MIN6 cells (70% confluence) were incubated in KRB buffer containing GLP-1 and test agents for various times. MIN6 cells were then lysed in a cold lysis buffer (36Dalle S. Longuet C. Costes S. Broca C. Faruque O. Fontés G. Hani E.H. Bataille D. J. Biol.

Supernatants were denatured by boiling for 5 min in Laemmli's sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Samples were normalized for protein content by a Bradford protein assay, and equal amounts of lysate proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked, probed with the specific antibodies, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody followed by chemiluminescence detection. After a 2-h stabilization period at 37 °C in KRB buffer, 10-cm dishes of MIN6 cells (70% confluence) were incubated in KRB buffer containing GLP-1 for various times as indicated. MIN6 cells were then lysed in a cold lysis buffer. Supernatants (250–800 μg of total proteins) were incubated with primary antibody for 4 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were then precipitated from supernatant with protein A/G-Plus-agarose, washed three times with ice-cold cell lysis buffer, boiled for 5 min in Laemmli's sample buffer, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Samples were normalized for protein content by a Bradford protein assay, and equal amounts of lysate proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. After a 2-h stabilization in KRB, 10-cm dishes seeded with MIN6 cells (70% confluence) were stimulated with GLP-1 for 5 or 20 min. Cells were then washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped in 1.2 ml of hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mg/ml pepstatin). After a 15-min incubation, cells were Dounce homogenized 40 times on ice and centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 × g at 4 °C. Supernatants containing cytosol and membranes were collected and preserved for protein content determination and Western blotting. Pellets containing nuclei were Dounce homogenized 30 times in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 300 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8), 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mg/ml pepstatin; centrifuged 5 min at 2500 × g at 4 °C; and rinsed twice. Pellets containing pure nuclei were then dissolved in Tris-buffered saline-sucrose/EDTA buffer for protein determination before Western blotting analysis. Apoptosis was evaluated by determination of histone-complexed DNA fragments (mono- and oligonucleosomes) with the cell death detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. for n independent experiments. Statistical differences between groups were evaluated by Student's t test for single comparisons or by analysis of variance, followed by the Newman-Keuls test in the case of multiple comparisons. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05 (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001).

It is largely unknown how amyloid β-peptide (Aβ), a principal agent in Alzheimer disease, affects synapses in brain neurons. In this study, we found that similar to other pore-forming neurotoxins, Aβ induced a rapid increase in intracellular calcium and miniature currents, indicating an enhancement in vesicular transmitter release. Significantly, blockade of these effects by low extracellular calcium and a peptide known to act as an inhibitor of the Aβ-induced pore prevented the delayed failure, indicating that Aβ blocks neurotransmission by causing vesicular depletion.

https://openalex.org/W2170443224,"In Drosophila, the connections between olfactory receptor neurons and projection neurons are highly specific. Here, the authors report that two leucine-rich repeat transmembrane proteins (Capricious and Tartan) serve as a mechanism for projection neuron dendrite targeting in the olfactory map. Olfactory systems utilize discrete neural pathways to process and integrate odorant information. In Drosophila, axons of first-order olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) and dendrites of second-order projection neurons (PNs) form class-specific synaptic connections at ∼50 glomeruli. The mechanisms underlying PN dendrite targeting to distinct glomeruli in a three-dimensional discrete neural map are unclear. We found that the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) transmembrane protein Capricious (Caps) was differentially expressed in different classes of PNs. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies indicated that Caps instructs the segregation of Caps-positive and Caps-negative PN dendrites to discrete glomerular targets. Moreover, Caps-mediated PN dendrite targeting was independent of presynaptic ORNs and did not involve homophilic interactions. The closely related protein Tartan was partially redundant with Caps. These LRR proteins are probably part of a combinatorial cell-surface code that instructs discrete olfactory map formation."
https://openalex.org/W2071937059,"Metastasis is a sequential process that allows cells to move from the primary tumor and grow elsewhere. Because of their ability to cleave a variety of extracellular signaling and adhesion molecules, metalloproteases have been long considered key components of the metastatic program. However, the function of certain metalloproteases, such as ADAMTS1, is not clear and seems to depend on the cellular environment and/or the stage of tumor progression. To characterize the function of ADAMTS1, we performed two alternative proteomic approaches, difference gel electrophoresis and stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture, to identify novel substrates of the metalloprotease. Both techniques showed that overexpression of ADAMTS1 leads to the release of semaphorin 3C from the extracellular matrix. Although semaphorins are well known regulators of axon guidance, accumulating evidence shows that they may also participate in tumor progression. Here, we show that the cleavage of semaphorin 3C induced by ADAMTS1 promotes the migration of breast cancer cells, indicating that the co-expression of these molecules in tumors may contribute to the metastatic program.

Metastasis, the leading cause of death in cancer patients, is a multistep process that allows selected cells to move from the primary tumor and establish secondary tumors in different organs. Metastatic cells are endowed with specific abilities in order to escape from the initial tumor, survive in circulation, arrest in a distant capillary, extravasate, and grow in a remote site. Increased cell migration is required to fulfill several steps of the metastatic program (1Kedrin D. van Rheenen J. Hernandez L. Condeelis J. Segall J.E. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2007; 12: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The initial characterization of cell surface and extracellular zinc endopeptidases showed that they can degrade components of the extracellular matrix (2Basbaum C.B. Werb Z. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). This finding along with the fact that, to invade neighboring tissue, migrating malignant cells induce the degradation of the extracellular matrix, led to an intuitive but simplistic hypothesis. Metalloproteases would contribute to tumor progression through the degradation of extracellular structural components. Following up on this view, the therapeutic value of several nonspecific metalloprotease inhibitors was assayed in clinical trials on cancer patients. Unfortunately, these trials failed, showing that the degradation of the extracellular matrix does not explain the role of zinc-dependent metalloproteases in human tumors (3Coussens L.M. Fingleton B. Matrisian L.M. Science. 2002; 295: 2387-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (2390) Google Scholar). Extracellular metalloproteases are classified in large families including the matrix metalloproteases, the ADAMs (proteins containing a disintegrin and a metalloprotease domain), and the ADAMTS (ADAMs with thrombospondin motifs) (4Stöcker W. Bode W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Contradicting the initial hypothesis, it has become recently clear that individual matrix metalloproteases as well as ADAMs and ADAMTSs fulfill far more sophisticated roles. They show restricted specificity, and their function depends on the substrates they cleave. Whereas some metalloproteases are pro-tumorigenic, others act as tumor suppressors (5López-Otín C. Matrisian L.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 800-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). For example, ADAM17 contributes to tumor growth through its ability to cleave and, thus, activate ligands for the epidermal growth factor receptor, a tyrosine kinase causally involved in the progression of many tumors (6Blobel C.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). In contrast, by cleaving plasminogen and generating angiostatin (7Dong Z. Kumar R. Yang X. Fidler I.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 801-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), matrix metalloprotease-12 exerts the opposite action. It inhibits tumor growth by halting angiogenesis (8Gorrin-Rivas M.J. Arii S. Furutani M. Mizumoto M. Mori A. Hanaki K. Maeda M. Furuyama H. Kondo Y. Imamura M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 1647-1654PubMed Google Scholar). The function of a third category of metalloproteases depends on the cellular environment and/or the stage of tumor progression. This is best exemplified by ADAMTS1; some experimental models clearly show that its expression impairs angiogenesis, tumor growth, and metastasis through different mechanisms (9Kuno K. Bannai K. Hakozaki M. Matsushima K. Hirose K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 319: 1327-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 10Lee N.V. Sato M. Annis D.S. Loo J.A. Wu L. Mosher D.F.

However, it is acutely up-regulated in highly metastatic breast cancer cells (13Kang Y. Siegel P.M. Shu W. Drobnjak M. Kakonen S.M. Cordón-Cardo C. Guise T.A. Massagué J. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 537-549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar) and seems to favor local invasion and lymph node metastasis of pancreatic cancer (14Masui T.

It has been recently shown that ADAMTS1 induces a stromal reaction in vivo through the recruitment of fibroblastic cells (20Rocks N. Paulissen G. Quesada-Calvo F. Munaut C. Gonzalez M.L. Gueders M. Hacha J. Gilles C. Foidart J.M. Noel A. Cataldo D.D. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 9541-9550Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Clearly the identification of novel substrates may shed light on the role of ADAMTS1 and, hence, on its contribution to tumor spreading. In search for novel substrates of ADAMTS1, we have analyzed the population of gene products that are secreted (i.e. the secretome (21Antelmann H. Tjalsma H. Voigt B. Ohlmeier S. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Hecker M. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1484-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar)) from cells overexpressing the metalloprotease. This proteomic approach identified semaphorin 3C as a putative novel substrate of ADAMTS1. Semaphorins are a large family of secreted and membrane-bound proteins. Although initially semaphorins were identified as regulators of axon guidance during the development of the nervous system, it is nowadays clear that they also contribute positively or negatively to the regulation of different aspects of tumor progression and metastasis, particularly cell migration (22Neufeld G. Kessler O. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 632-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 23Capparuccia L. Tamagnone L. J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 1723-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Semaphorins are classified into eight classes on the basis of their structural elements. Class 3 semaphorins are the only secreted vertebrate semaphorins and are distinguished by a conserved positively charged domain at the carboxyl terminus that serves as an anchor to negatively charged components of the extracellular matrix (24Luo Y. Raible D. Raper J.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 217-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). All class 3 semaphorins analyzed to date (i.e. semaphorins 3A, 3B, 3D, 3E, 3F, and 3G) inhibit cell migration and seem to be endowed with anti-tumor properties (23Capparuccia L. Tamagnone L. J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 1723-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). For example, semaphorin 3A inhibits the migration of breast cancer cells (25Bachelder R.E. Lipscomb E.A. Lin X. Wendt M.A. Chadborn N.H. Eickholt B.J. Mercurio A.M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5230-5233PubMed Google Scholar) and blocks the tumor growth in vivo (26Kigel B. Varshavsky A. Kessler O. Neufeld G. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e3287Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In contrast to other class 3 semaphorins, semaphorin 3C has been poorly characterized. The results presented here show that, in contrast to other class 3 semaphorins, semaphorin 3C promotes cell migration and that ADAMTS1 regulates its activity through its release from the extracellular matrix. Thus, these results show that both molecules, acting coordinately, increase cell migration and in this way may favor tumor invasion and metastasis. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) 4The abbreviations used are: DMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumshRNAshort hairpin RNAMSmass spectroscopyHheavyLlightDIGEdifference gel electrophoresisSILACstable isotopes labeling by amino acids in cell cultureFBSfetal bovine serumHUVEChuman umbilical vein endothelial cell(s). /F-12 (1:1) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm l-glutamine. Transient and stable transfections were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics). For ADAMTS1 overexpression, MCF7TetOff neo cells (Clontech) were transformed with the pUHD10.3 hyg vector, containing ADAMTS1 cDNA. A monoclonal cell line responding optimally to doxycycline was selected by Western blot and grown in larger quantities for use in the proteomic screenings and subsequent Western blot analysis for potential substrates.

Stable shRNA-mediated knockdown clones were obtained using the MISSION® shADAMTS1 lentiviral plasmid vectors (Sigma). Briefly, for lentivirus production, 293T cells were co-transfected with lentivirus envelope elements (pVSV-G and pRSV-Rev), lentivirus gag-pol elements (pMDL RRE, kindly provided by Dr. Juan A. Recio), and the lentiviral plasmid vectors MISSION® shADAMTS1 or MISSION® non-target shRNA control vector. Transfection was performed with FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Lentiviral particles were collected at 24 and 48 h post-transfection. Viruses were used to infect EW-7 cells (kindly provided by Dr. Arjan W. Griffioen) in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene. Different shADAMTS1 clones were selected with 0.5 μg/ml puromycin. Mouse anti-ADAMTS1 (5D4E11B5) has been described elsewhere (12Luque A. Carpizo D.R. Iruela-Arispe M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23656-23665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-SEMA3C was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Anti-semaphorin 3A and semaphorin 3B were from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Additional chemicals were from Sigma. ADAMTS1 MCF7 cells from a single clone were grown in 15-cm dishes in the presence or absence of doxycycline and allowed to attach and reach 90% confluence. Then DMEM/F-12 + 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) was replaced with serum-free medium, again with or without doxycycline, and the medium was allowed to accumulate shed proteins for 48 h. The media were collected and further processed as described in Bech-Serra et al. (27Bech-Serra J.J. Santiago-Josefat B. Esselens C. Saftig P. Baselga J. Arribas J. Canals F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 5086-5095Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded in SILAC DMEM medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with dialyzed serum (amino acid-free) and the appropriate normal or isotopically labeled amino acids (see also Ref. 28Esselens C.W. Malapeira J. Colome N. Moss M. Canals F. Arribas J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 389: 1075-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cell culture conditions were first optimized for maximal isotopic incorporation and for minimizing arginine to proline conversion by the cell metabolism. We chose [12C,14N]lysine and [12C,14N]arginine “light” (L) amino acids in combination with ADAMTS1 overexpression (no doxycycline) and [13C6,14N]Lys and [13C6,15N4]Arg “heavy” (H) amino acids for the normal condition (doxycycline added). Cells were incubated with heavy or light amino acids in the presence or absence of doxycycline for a total of 7 days, corresponding to ∼6 cell doublings. In the final 48-h serum was left out to reduce serum protein background and to accumulate shed proteins. In addition, to maximize protein yields, the cells were seeded so they reached confluency on day 7. Cells were counted, and the amount of medium was compared with this. Big differences (>5%) in cell counts between treated and untreated situations, possibly due to toxic or proliferative effects of ADAMTS1 overexpression, were not observed. After this, the supernatant of control and overexpressing cells was pooled, and further technical bias, therefore, had equal effects on both heavy and light protein pools, leaving the H/L ratio unaffected. Conditioned media were incubated overnight at 4 °C with wheat germ agglutinin-agarose beads (1 μl of stirred suspension/ml of conditioned medium). Glycoproteins were eluted by rotating for 2 h at 4 °C with 4 ml of 0.5 m n-acetylglucosamine in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.15 m NaCl buffer. The glycoprotein solutions were then concentrated 40-fold by ultrafiltration (Amicon Ultra-4, 5-kDa cutoff; Millipore, Carrigtwohill, Ireland). Urea was then added to the concentrated protein solution to a final 8 m concentration, and pH was adjusted to 8.5. Proteins were reduced by the addition of 50 mm dithiothreitol and incubation for 30 min at room temperature and then carbamidomethylated with 125 mm iodoacetamide for 1 h at room temperature. The protein mixture was then purified by a modified acetone-trichloroacetic acid precipitation (2D-CleanUp kit; GE Healthcare). The resulting protein pellet was resuspended in 40 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer and subjected to one-dimensional electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide-SDS gel. The SDS-PAGE gel was cut into 20 horizontal slices, and individual slices were digested using modified porcine trypsin (Promega). Digests were analyzed on an Esquire HCT IT mass spectrometer (Bruker, Bremen, Germany) coupled to a nano-high performance liquid chromatography system (Ultimate, LC Packings, The Netherlands). Peptide mixtures were initially concentrated on a 300-μm id, 1-mm PepMap nanotrapping column and subsequently loaded onto a 75-μm inner diameter, 15-cm PepMap nanoseparation column (LC Packings). An acetonitrile gradient (0–60% B in 150 min, where B is 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid in water; flow rate ∼300 nl/min) was used to elute the peptides through a PicoTip emitter nanospray needle (NewObjective, Woburn, MA) onto the nanospray ionization source of the IT mass spectrometer. MS/MS fragmentation (1.9 s, 100–2800 m/z) of two of the most intense ions was carried out, as detected from a 1.2-s MS survey scan (310–1500 m/z) using a dynamic exclusion time of 1.2 min for precursor selection and excluding single-charged ions. An automated optimization of MS/MS fragmentation amplitude beginning at 0.60 V was used. Data processing for protein identification and quantification was performed using WARP-LC 1.1 (Bruker), a software platform integrating liquid chromatography-MS run data processing, protein identification through a data base search of MS/MS spectra and protein quantification based on the integration of the chromatographic peaks of MS-extracted ion chromatograms for each precursor. Proteins were identified using Mascot (Matrix Science, London, UK) to search the International Protein Index Human 3.26 data base (67,665 sequences, 2,846,2007 residues) (29Kersey P.J. Duarte J. Williams A. Karavidopoulou Y. Birney E. Apweiler R. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 1985-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). MS/MS spectra were searched with a precursor mass tolerance of 1.5 Da, fragment tolerance of 0.5 Da, trypsin specificity with a maximum of 1 missed cleavage, cysteine carbamidomethylation set as fixed modification and methionine oxidation, and the corresponding Lys and Arg SILAC labels as variable modifications. Positive identification criterion was set as an individual Mascot score for each peptide MS/MS spectrum higher than the corresponding homology threshold score. For protein quantification, H/L ratios were calculated averaging the measured H/L ratios for the observed peptides after discarding outliers. For selected proteins, quantification data obtained from the automated WARP-LC analysis was manually reviewed. Wild-type S3C cDNA was a gift from Dr. A Tufro (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York); based on this we generated our S3C constructs. Deletion constructs were generated using standard techniques. Semaphorin S3A and S3B constructs were a gift from Dr. G. Neufeld (Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Haifa, Israel) and Dr. S. Naylor (University of Texas). Cells were plated in 60-mm dishes in DMEM/F-12 + 10% FBS. After 24 h cells were incubated with serum-free DMEM (identical to SILAC conditions) and treated in the presence or absence of doxycycline for 48 h. After that the cells were lysed for 30 min in ice-cold 1% Triton X-100 and kept on ice in further steps to avoid unwanted proteolytic activity. Total protein in the lysates was quantified, and equal amounts of protein from cell lysates were concentrated with wheat germ agglutinin-agarose beads (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) rotating for 2 h at 4 °C. Proteins were eluted directly in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer (Laemmli buffer). Protein loading of conditioned medium samples for Western blot analysis was adjusted according to the total protein in cell lysates and checked by Ponceau red staining of the blotted nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). Finally, when analyzing the matrix, cells were detached non-enzymatically using 10 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline, and after washing with phosphate-buffered saline the remaining extracellular matrix was scraped from the plates in sample buffer and loaded onto an SDS-PAGE gel. Detection was performed using the corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and the SuperSignal chemiluminescence kit from Pierce. Cells were treated with 5 mm BB94 (a specific metalloprotease inhibitor, British Biotech), for the indicated times, and the processing of S3C was analyzed as described above. Chemorepulsion of different semaphorin fragments was analyzed by co-culturing semaphorin expressing HEK293 cells on a HUVEC cell monolayer (gift from Dr. J. Seoane, Vall d'Hebron Institut de Recerca). HEK293 cells were plated and transfected with different semaphorin fragments using FuGENE, and after 12 h they were trypsinized and plated on a HUVEC cell layer (2000 cells/plate). HUVEC cells were used between passages 2 and 8. Endothelial cell medium (ECM-2, Cambrex Bio Science Walkersville, MD) was used to culture HUVEC with the addition of hydrocortisone, human fibroblast growth factor-B, R3-insulin-like growth factor-1, ascorbic acid, FBS (2%), human epidermal growth factor, and GA-1000. Heparin was left out because it causes the release of S3C and ADAMTS1 from the matrix. Some forms of vascular endothelial growth factor are known to compete with semaphorins for their receptors and were, therefore, also omitted from the culture media. The omission of these factors had no observable effect on HUVEC cells during the time of the assay (data not shown). Cell repulsion was assessed after 48 h of co-culture. Chemotaxis toward different semaphorin fragments was analyzed using a 8.0 μm polycarbonate membrane Transwell permeable support (Corning). In the lower compartment, HEK293 cells were plated and transfected using FuGENE with different constructs. In the upper compartment, the membrane was pretreated with DMEM/F-12 + 10% FBS, and subsequently MDA231 or MCF7 cells were plated on the membrane (20,000 cells/well). After 4 h of attachment, these membranes were placed in the wells with mock-transfected or semaphorin-producing HEK293 cells to start the migration assay. After 12 h membranes were removed, the cells were fixed for 30 min in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, non-migrated cells on the upper part of the membrane were removed with a cotton swab, and the membranes were subsequently mounted in Vectashield mounting medium containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories). Finally the 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-stained nuclei were counted under the UV microscope (Nikon). A positive (DMEM/F-12, 10% FBS + mock- transfected cells) and a negative (DMEM- F-12, serum-free + mock-transfected cells) control for chemoattraction were included in each experiment. ADAMTS1 is a modular protein composed of signal peptide, propeptide, metalloproteinase, disintegrin, thrombospondin type I-like (TSP-1), and cysteine-rich (Cys-rich) domains (30Kuno K. Kanada N.

Although ADAMTS1 seems to be down-regulated in samples from primary breast cancers (32Porter S. Scott S.D. Sassoon E.M. Williams M.R. Jones J.L. Girling A.C. Ball R.Y. Edwards D.R. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 2429-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), it has been shown that ADAMTS1 is one of the most up-regulated genes in highly metastatic breast cancer cells (13Kang Y. Siegel P.M. Shu W. Drobnjak M. Kakonen S.M. Cordón-Cardo C. Guise T.A. Massagué J. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 537-549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar), indicating that it may contribute to tumor spreading. As a means to identify novel substrates of ADAMTS1, we generated cell lines expressing the metalloprotease in a repressible manner. Analysis of the media conditioned by MCF7 Tet-Off cells permanently transfected with ADAMTS1 and cultured in the absence of doxycycline showed the expected array of ADAMTS1 isoforms (Fig. 1B, right lane). Previous characterization of these isoforms showed that p110 corresponds to the inactive proADAMTS1 precursor, p87 is the product of the processing of p110 by furin-like convertases, and p65 is the product of the subsequent processing of p87 by metalloproteases (Ref. 33Rodriguez-Manzaneque J.C. Milchanowski A.B. Dufour E.K. Leduc R. Iruela-Arispe M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33471-33479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar and Fig. 1A). Doxycycline is a nonspecific metalloprotease inhibitor that could interfere with the identification of ADAMTS1 substrates. For example, collagenases can be inhibited by concentrations of doxycycline of 30 μm (34Smith Jr., G.N. Mickler E.A. Hasty K.A. Brandt K.D. Arthritis Rheum. 1999; 42: 1140-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). To avoid the interference of doxycycline in our assays, we used the minimal concentration that effectively blocks the expression of ADAMTS1, i.e. 2.1 nm (1 ng/ml) (Fig. 1B). This concentration is not expected to affect the activity of metalloproteases known to be inhibited by doxycycline (34Smith Jr., G.N. Mickler E.A. Hasty K.A. Brandt K.D. Arthritis Rheum. 1999; 42: 1140-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Secreted ADAMTS1 has been shown to bind to components of the extracellular matrix via its thrombospondin domains (35Kuno K. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13912-13917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the 87-kDa isoform of ADAMTS1 was predominantly found in the protein fraction corresponding to the extracellular matrix (Fig. 1C). These results show that the MCF7 Tet-Off/ADAMTS1 cell line is a useful system to functionally characterize the metalloprotease and that the concentration of doxycycline required to effectively repress the expression of ADAMTS1 is not expected to inhibit its metalloprotease activity. To identify novel substrates of ADAMTS1, we compared the secretome of MCF7 Tet-Off/ADAMTS1 cells cultured in the presence or absence of doxycycline using two complementary proteomic techniques: DIGE and SILAC. DIGE is a robust quantitative proteomic technique in which two samples are labeled with different fluorochromes and loaded onto a single two-dimensional gel (36Van den Bergh G. Arckens L. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2004; 15: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), thereby overcoming the lack of reproducibility inherent to different two-dimensional gels. To apply this technology, we purified glycoproteins from the media conditioned by MCF7 Tet-Off/ADAMTS1 cells treated without or with doxycycline and labeled them with the cyanine dyes Cy3 or Cy5, respectively; the labeled glycoproteins were separated in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1D). To visualize the protein spots, the gel was scanned with fluorophore-specific excitation and emission wavelengths, and two independent images were acquired (Fig. 2A), each corresponding to an individual Cy-labeled probe. Image analysis and determination of significant alterations in spot abundances were performed automatically with the DeCyder software (Fig. 2, B and C). Only those protein spots exhibiting a change in volume ratio exceeding 1.5-fold were selected (Fig. 2, B and C), excised, and subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin. The resulting peptides were then subjected to peptide mass fingerprinting analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. In a search of the International Protein Index human data base, peptide mass information identified 28 of the 83 protein spots analyzed, assigning them to 5 proteins (Table 1). As expected, several spots corresponded to the ADAMTS1 (Table 1). In addition we identified thrombospondin-1 (Fig. 2D, left), a known substrate of ADAMTS1 (10Lee N.V. Sato M. Annis D.S. Loo J.A.

https://openalex.org/W2143958500,"Safely eradicating prions, amyloids and preamyloid oligomers may ameliorate several fatal neurodegenerative disorders. Yet whether small-molecule drugs can directly antagonize the entire spectrum of distinct amyloid structures or 'strains' that underlie distinct disease states is unclear. Here, we investigated this issue using the yeast prion protein Sup35. We have established how epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) blocks synthetic Sup35 prionogenesis, eliminates preformed Sup35 prions and disrupts inter- and intramolecular prion contacts. Unexpectedly, these direct activities were strain selective, altered the repertoire of accessible infectious forms and facilitated emergence of a new prion strain that configured original, EGCG-resistant intermolecular contacts. In vivo, EGCG cured and prevented induction of susceptible, but not resistant strains, and elicited switching from susceptible to resistant forms. Importantly, 4,5-bis-(4-methoxyanilino)phthalimide directly antagonized EGCG-resistant prions and synergized with EGCG to eliminate diverse Sup35 prion strains. Thus, synergistic small-molecule combinations that directly eradicate complete strain repertoires likely hold considerable therapeutic potential."
https://openalex.org/W2099775353,"Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) is activated in the inflammatory response to interferons. The MUC1 oncoprotein is overexpressed in human breast cancers. Analysis of genes differentially expressed in MUC1-transformed cells has identified a network linking MUC1 and STAT1 that is associated with cellular growth and inflammation. The results further show that the MUC1-C subunit associates with STAT1 in cells and the MUC1-C cytoplasmic domain binds directly to the STAT1 DNA-binding domain. The interaction between MUC1-C and STAT1 is inducible by IFNγ in non-malignant epithelial cells and constitutive in breast cancer cells. Moreover, the MUC1–STAT1 interaction contributes to the activation of STAT1 target genes, including MUC1 itself. Analysis of two independent databases showed that MUC1 and STAT1 are coexpressed in about 15% of primary human breast tumors. Coexpression of MUC1 and the STAT1 pathway was found to be significantly associated with decreased recurrence-free and overall survival. These findings indicate that (i) MUC1 and STAT1 function in an auto-inductive loop, and (ii) activation of both MUC1 and the STAT1 pathway in breast tumors confers a poor prognosis for patients."
https://openalex.org/W2145793083,"Biodiversity, or the relative abundance of species, measures the persistence of an ecosystem. To better understand its modulation, we analyzed the spatial and temporal dynamics of a synthetic, chemical-mediated ecosystem that consisted of two engineered Escherichia coli populations. Depending on the specific experimental conditions implemented, the dominant interaction between the two populations could be competition for nutrients or predation due to engineered communication. While the two types of interactions resulted in different spatial patterns, they demonstrated a common trend in terms of the modulation of biodiversity. Specifically, biodiversity decreased with increasing cellular motility if the segregation distance between the two populations was comparable to the length scale of the chemical-mediated interaction. Otherwise, biodiversity was insensitive to cellular motility. Our results suggested a simple criterion for predicting the modulation of biodiversity by habitat partitioning and cellular motility in chemical-mediated ecosystems."

We have examined whether these separate signaling pathways have a convergent mechanism that leads to GLUT4 mobilization and to changes in GLUT4 recycling. HA antibody uptake on GLUT4 in the basal steady state reached a final equilibrium level that was only 81% of the insulin-stimulated level. AMPK activators (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxyamide ribonucleoside (AICAR) and A-769662) led to a similar level of antibody uptake to that found in insulin-stimulated cells. However, the combined responses to insulin stimulation and AMPK activation led to an antibody uptake level of ∼20% above the insulin level. Increases in antibody uptake due to insulin, but not AICAR or A-769662, treatment were reduced by both wortmannin and Akt inhibitor. The GLUT4 internalization rate constant in the basal steady state was very rapid (0.43 min−1) and was decreased during the steady-state responses to insulin (0.18 min−1), AICAR (0.16 min−1), and A-769662 (0.24 min−1).

https://openalex.org/W2068894022,"Burkholderia cepacia AC1100 completely degrades 2,4,5-trichlorophenol, in which an FADH(2)-dependent monooxygenase (TftD) and an NADH:FAD oxidoreductase (TftC) catalyze the initial steps. TftD oxidizes 2,4,5-trichlorophenol (2,4,5-TCP) to 2,5-dichloro-p-benzoquinone, which is chemically reduced to 2,5-dichloro-p-hydroquinone (2,5-DiCHQ). Then, TftD oxidizes the latter to 5-chloro-2-hydroxy-p-benzoquinone. In those processes, TftC provides all the required FADH(2). We have determined the crystal structures of dimeric TftC and tetrameric TftD at 2.0 and 2.5 A resolution, respectively. The structure of TftC was similar to those of related flavin reductases. The stacked nicotinamide:isoalloxazine rings in TftC and sequential reaction kinetics suggest that the reduced FAD leaves TftC after NADH oxidation. The structure of TftD was also similar to the known structures of FADH(2)-dependent monooxygenases. Its His-289 residue in the re-side of the isoalloxazine ring is within hydrogen bonding distance with a hydroxyl group of 2,5-DiCHQ. An H289A mutation resulted in the complete loss of activity toward 2,5-DiCHQ and a significant decrease in catalytic efficiency toward 2,4,5-TCP. Thus, His-289 plays different roles in the catalysis of 2,4,5-TCP and 2,5-DiCHQ. The results support that free FADH(2) is generated by TftC, and TftD uses FADH(2) to separately transform 2,4,5-TCP and 2,5-DiCHQ. Additional experimental data also support the diffusion of FADH(2) between TftC and TftD without direct physical interaction between the two enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2084789302,"Yeast mating-type switching requires ubiquitylation of the transcriptional repressor α2. This results in removal of α2 from its DNA targets by the ubiquitin-selective AAA-ATPase Cdc48, thus revealing a nuclear function of Cdc48 and an ubiquitin-dependent extraction pathway for dismantling transcription factor—DNA complexes. Switches between different phenotypes and their underlying states of gene transcription occur as cells respond to intrinsic developmental cues or adapt to changing environmental conditions. Post-translational modification of the master regulatory transcription factors that define the initial phenotype is a common strategy to direct such transitions. Emerging evidence indicates that the modification of key transcription factors by the small polypeptide ubiquitin has a central role in many of these transitions1,2. However, the molecular mechanisms by which ubiquitylation regulates the switching of promoters between active and inactive states are largely unknown. Ubiquitylation of the yeast transcriptional repressor α2 is necessary to evoke the transition between mating-types3, and here we dissect the impact of this modification on α2 dynamics at its target promoters. Ubiquitylation of α2 does not alter DNA occupancy by depleting the existing pool of the transcription factor, despite its well-characterized function in directing repressor turnover. Rather, α2 ubiquitylation has a direct role in the rapid removal of the repressor from its DNA targets. This disassembly of α2 from DNA depends on the ubiquitin-selective AAA-ATPase Cdc48. Our findings expand the functional targets of Cdc48 to include active transcriptional regulatory complexes in the nucleus. These data reveal an ubiquitin-dependent extraction pathway for dismantling transcription factor–DNA complexes and provide an archetype for the regulation of transcriptional switching events by ubiquitylation."
https://openalex.org/W2114437179,"Unlike most other organisms, the essential five-step coenzyme A biosynthetic pathway has not been fully resolved in yeast. Specifically, the genes encoding the phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase (PPCDC) activity still remain unidentified. Sequence homology analyses suggest three candidates-Ykl088w, Hal3 and Vhs3-as putative PPCDC enzymes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Notably, Hal3 and Vhs3 have been characterized as negative regulatory subunits of the Ppz1 protein phosphatase. Here we show that YKL088w does not encode a third Ppz1 regulatory subunit, and that the essential roles of Ykl088w and the Hal3 and Vhs3 pair are complementary, cannot be interchanged and can be attributed to PPCDC-related functions. We demonstrate that while known eukaryotic PPCDCs are homotrimers, the active yeast enzyme is a heterotrimer that consists of Ykl088w and Hal3/Vhs3 monomers that separately provides two essential catalytic residues. Our results unveil Hal3 and Vhs3 as moonlighting proteins involved in both CoA biosynthesis and protein phosphatase regulation."

Our results show that sgp130Fc-dNG is inherently unstable and degrades rapidly under conditions that do not harm wild-type sgp130Fc.

https://openalex.org/W2067536563,"The value of biodiversity must be accounted for, says Pavan Sukhdev. It is time for governments to invest to secure the flow of nature's 'public goods'. This week's Nature is the third of three special issues (previously 20 November 2008 and 12 February 2009) marking the Darwin bicentenary. The theme is biodiversity and how to preserve it. Though still endangered, the golden lion tamarin is a conservation success story in an area where successes are rare: with re-introductions and efforts to preserve its Brazilian forest habitat, the population of the primate has been stabilized. The ecosystem services approach exemplified by the 1997 Nature review by Robert Costanza and colleagues, which puts a value on everything including biodiversity, is seen by many as a key to encouraging conservation: Gretchen Daily, a leading proponent, is optimistic. In an Opinion piece, Pavan Sukhdev puts the case for governmental investment in environmental services, with biodiversity properly costed as part of the broader picture. Taxonomists use part of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase gene as a 'DNA bar code': more controversially, Dan Mishmar and colleagues propose that the bar code is not just a useful handle on the relatedness of species but a driver of diversity. With the Copenhagen conference looming, Will Turner, Michael Oppenheimer and David Wilcove explain how natural ecosystems and biodiversity can mitigate climate change. Robert Smith and colleagues stress the importance of local agencies — as opposed to NGOs and incomers — in setting biodiversity goals. The best biodiversity data set we have is provided by palaeontologists: Douglas Erwin thinks they could do more with it though, by adopting the techniques used by physicists.

https://openalex.org/W2118667931,"The involvement of tRNA structural elements beyond the anticodon in aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) selection by the ribosome has revealed that substrate recognition is considerably more complex than originally envisioned in the adaptor hypothesis. By combining recent breakthroughs in aa-tRNA synthesis and mechanistic and structural studies of protein synthesis, we have investigated whether aa-tRNA recognition further extends to the amino acid, which would explain various translation disorders exhibited by misacylated tRNAs. Contrary to expectation, we find that natural amino acids misacylated onto natural but non-native tRNAs are selected with efficiencies very similar to those of their correctly acylated counterparts. Despite this, small but reproducible differences in selection indeed demonstrate that the translational machinery is sensitive to the amino acid–tRNA pairing. These results suggest either that the ribosome is an exquisite sensor of natural versus unnatural amino acid–tRNA pairings and/or that aa-tRNA selection is not the primary step governing the amino acid specificity of the ribosome."
https://openalex.org/W2037001104,"Heparan sulfate is a ubiquitous glycosaminoglycan in the extracellular matrix of most animals. It interacts with various molecules and exhibits important biological functions. K5 antigen produced by Escherichia coli strain K5 is a linear polysaccharide N-acetylheparosan consisting of GlcUA beta1-4 and GlcNAc alpha1-4 repeating disaccharide, which forms the backbone of heparan sulfate. Region 2, located in the center of the K5-specific gene cluster, encodes four proteins, KfiA, KfiB, KfiC, and KfiD, for the biosynthesis of the K5 polysaccharide. Here, we expressed and purified the recombinant KfiA and KfiC proteins and then characterized these enzymes. Whereas the recombinant KfiC alone exhibited no GlcUA transferase activity, it did exhibit GlcUA transferase and polymerization activities in the presence of KfiA. In contrast, KfiA had GlcNAc transferase activity itself, which was unaffected by the presence of KfiC. The GlcNAc and GlcUA transferase activities were analyzed with various truncated and point mutants of KfiA and KfiC. The point mutants replacing aspartic acid of a DXD motif and lysine and glutamic acid of an ionic amino acid cluster, and the truncated mutants deleting the C-terminal and N-terminal sites, revealed the essential regions for GlcNAc and GlcUA transferase activity of KfiC and KfiA, respectively. The interaction of KfiC with KfiA is necessary for the GlcUA transferase activity of KfiC but not for the enzyme activity of KfiA. Together, these results indicate that the complex of KfiA and KfiC has polymerase activity to synthesize N-acetylheparosan, providing a useful tool toward bioengineering of defined heparan sulfate chains."
https://openalex.org/W2094583293,"The early growth response gene product Egr-1 has been shown to have great impact on growth, proliferation, and differentiation in a wide variety of cells, including T cells. In this study, we show that Egr-1 is rapidly induced upon T cell stimulation and is expressed predominantly in T helper type 2 (Th2) compared with type 1 (Th1) cells. We further investigate the role of Egr-1 in regulation of the Th2 cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4) expression. IL-4 is a key Th2 cytokine that regulates humoral immunity and also causes allergic inflammation. Regulation of IL-4 gene transcription in Th2 cells has been shown to be controlled by multiple T cell receptor (TCR)-induced transcription factors. However, only a few transcription factors were shown to be selectively induced in differentiated Th2 cells in response to TCR stimulation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrates that Egr-1 binds to the IL-4 promoter in vivo upon T cell stimulation. Ectopic expression of Egr-1 enhances endogenous IL-4 mRNA expression and elevates IL-4 promoter activity. We also show that Egr-1, nuclear factor of activated T cell, and NF-κB cooperatively bind to an NFAT/NF-κB-overlapping IL-4 enhancer element and activate the IL-4 promoter synergistically. Furthermore, we show that antisense oligonucleotides that knock down Egr-1 expression attenuate IL-4 transcription. Our study provides the first evidence that Egr-1 protein is differentially expressed in Th1 and Th2 cells and is involved in the acute phase of the IL-4 transcription in response to TCR stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W1964428785,"Protealysin (PLN) belongs to the M4 family of peptidases that are commonly known as thermolysin-like proteases (TLPs). All TLPs are synthesized as precursors containing N-terminal propeptides. According to the primary structure of the N-terminal propeptides, the family is divided into two distinct groups. Representatives of the first group including thermolysin and all TLPs with known three-dimensional structures have long prosequences ( approximately 200 amino acids). Enzymes of the second group, whose prototype is protealysin, have short ( approximately 50 amino acids) propeptides. Here, we present the 1.8 A crystal structure of PLN precursor (proPLN), which is the first three-dimensional structure of a TLP precursor. Whereas the structure of the catalytic domain of proPLN is similar overall to previously reported structures of mature TLPs, it has specific features, including the absence of calcium-binding sites, and different structures of the N-terminal region and substrate-binding site. PLN propeptide forms a separate domain in the precursor and likely acts as an inhibitor that blocks the substrate-binding site and fixes the ""open"" conformation of the active site, which is unfavorable for catalysis. Furthermore the conserved PPL motif identified in our previous studies directly interacts with the S' subsites of the active center being a critical element of the propeptide-catalytic domain interface. Comparison of the primary structures of TLPs with short propeptides suggests that the specific features revealed in the proPLN crystal structure are typical for all protealysin-like enzymes. Thus, such proteins can be considered as a separate subfamily of TLPs."
https://openalex.org/W1985159230,"Treatment of mice with the carcinogen azoxymethane (AOM) induces a number of lesions in the colon, including hyperplastic lesions, as well adenomas and carcinomas in situ. Inbred strains of mice show different responses to AOM-induced carcinogenesis. A/J mice are highly susceptible and develop a greater number of hyperplastic lesions and tumors (15-70 tumors per mouse) than resistant C57BL/6J mice (0-6 tumors per mouse). Susceptibility to AOM-induced tumors segregates as a co-dominant trait in (A x B6)F1 hybrids. Using a set of 23 AcB and BcA recombinant congenic mouse strains derived from A/J (susceptible) and B6 (resistant) parents, we observed that the number of hyperplastic lesions and tumors induced by AOM was under different genetic controls in AcB/BcA strains. The multiplicity of AOM-induced tumors is controlled by a major locus that we have mapped on the distal portion of chromosome 3, to which we have given the temporary designation colon cancer susceptibility locus 3 (Ccs3). B6 and A/J alleles at Ccs3 are associated with resistance and susceptibility, respectively. Haplotype analysis in key informative AcB/BcA strains restricts the size of the Ccs3 locus to a 14 Mb segment that contains 94 annotated genes. The expression level of all these genes in normal colon has been established by transcript profiling with microarrays, and has led to the identification of a subset of positional candidates that are expressed at high levels in this tissue. The 4q and 1p human chromosomal segments sharing syntenic homology with the mouse Ccs3 segment are known to be associated with inflammatory bowel diseases and colorectal tumors in humans, suggesting that the study of the mouse Ccs3 locus may help further the pathogenesis of these human conditions."

Although the TKD-EGFR confers tumorigenicity, little is known about the molecular underpinnings of receptor dysregulation. Therefore, we transfected B82L mouse fibroblast cells devoid of endogenous EGFR to determine the molecular mechanisms of receptor activation when expressed in cells as well as the contribution of each duplicated kinase domain to receptor phosphorylation. The TKD-EGFR displayed chronically elevated basal autophosphorylation at five known phosphotyrosine sites. The chronically phosphorylated TKD-EGFR was also resistant to competitive inhibition of ligand-binding compared with wild-type EGFR (WT-EGFR) and showed undetectable levels of basal dimerization, suggesting the TKD-EGFR escapes known mechanisms of receptor downregulation. Immunofluorescence analyses revealed a substantial portion of the TKD-EGFR resides in the cytosol in an activated state, although surface-localized subsets of the receptor retain ligand responsiveness. Kinase activity-deficient knockouts of the N-terminal or the C-terminal kinase domains generated TKD-EGFRs that recapitulate the autophosphorylation/localization patterns of a constitutively activated receptor versus a WT-like EGFR, respectively. Investigation of the molecular activity of the TKD-EGFR yields evidence for a unique mechanism of constitutive activity and dual kinase domain activation."
