https://openalex.org/W2111570305,"Abstract : The reduced nicotinamide dinucleotide dehydrogenase of the respiratory chain has been further purified by gradient centrifugations at pH 10. The best preparations obtained are approximately 70% pure by sedimentation analysis and show a single flavoprotein component. The molecular weight is estimated to be of the order of 550,000, and the turnover number 800,000 per minute at 30 degrees. Provisional data are given for the NADH dehydrogenase content of heart mitochondria, Keilin-Hartree preparations, and electron transport particles. It is shown that NADH dehydrogenase contributes to the acid-extractable flavin of these preparations only to a very minor extent. (Author)"

The mechanism, however, governing the renal elimination of the bile pigment is not clear, and, specifically, the relative roles of glomeruli and tubules are in question2–4."

This agent can release histamine and serotonin from rabbit platelets1, but is not effective in guinea pigs as is anaphylatoxin from rat or guinea pig serum. But the mode of formation of both these agents is quite similar. Since the involvement of complement, especially C′3, in anaphylatoxin formation is still under discussion2,3, we compared the formation of the anaphylatoxin-like substance in plasma from rabbits with hereditary C′3 defect with that in normal plasma. The C′3 defect rabbit blood was kindly supplied by Drs. K. and U. Rother4. C′3 defect rabbit sera show the same activity in the haemolytic system as do normal rabbit sera treated with zymosan."
