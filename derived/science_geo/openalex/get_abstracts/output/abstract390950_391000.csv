https://openalex.org/W2157735441,"In Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), dystrophin mutation leads to progressive lethal skeletal muscle degeneration. For unknown reasons, dystrophin deficiency does not recapitulate DMD in mice (mdx), which have mild skeletal muscle defects and potent regenerative capacity. We postulated that human DMD progression is a consequence of loss of functional muscle stem cells (MuSC), and the mild mouse mdx phenotype results from greater MuSC reserve fueled by longer telomeres. We report that mdx mice lacking the RNA component of telomerase (mdx/mTR) have shortened telomeres in muscle cells and severe muscular dystrophy that progressively worsens with age. Muscle wasting severity parallels a decline in MuSC regenerative capacity and is ameliorated histologically by transplantation of wild-type MuSC. These data show that DMD progression results, in part, from a cell-autonomous failure of MuSC to maintain the damage-repair cycle initiated by dystrophin deficiency. The essential role of MuSC function has therapeutic implications for DMD."
https://openalex.org/W2165761157,"In this study, the principles of surface sensing of translation (SUnSET) were used to develop a nonradioactive method for ex vivo and in vivo measurements of protein synthesis (PS). Compared with controls, we first demonstrate excellent agreement between SUnSET and a [(3)H]phenylalanine method when detecting synergist ablation-induced increases in skeletal muscle PS ex vivo. We then show that SUnSET can detect the same synergist ablation-induced increase in PS when used in vivo (IV-SUnSET). In addition, IV-SUnSET detected food deprivation-induced decreases in PS in the heart, kidney, and skeletal muscles, with similar changes being visualized with an immunohistochemical version of IV-SUnSET (IV-IHC-SUnSET). By combining IV-IHC-SUnSET with in vivo transfection, we demonstrate that constitutively active PKB induces a robust increase in skeletal muscle PS. Furthermore, transfection with Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb) revealed that a PKB-independent activation of mammalian target of rapamycin is also sufficient to induce an increase in skeletal muscle PS. Finally, IV-IHC-SUnSET exposed the existence of fiber type-dependent differences in skeletal muscle PS, with PS in type 2B and 2X fibers being significantly lower than that in type 2A fibers within the same muscle. Thus, our nonradioactive method allowed us to accurately visualize and quantify PS under various ex vivo and in vivo conditions and revealed novel insights into the regulation of PS in skeletal muscle."

Here, we report comprehensive maps of global polyadenylation events in human and yeast generated using refinements to the Direct RNA Sequencing technology. This direct approach provides a quantitative view of genome-wide polyadenylation states in a strand-specific manner and requires only attomole RNA quantities. The polyadenylation profiles revealed an abundance of unannotated polyadenylation sites, alternative polyadenylation patterns, and regulatory element-associated poly(A)(+) RNAs. We observed differences in sequence composition surrounding canonical and noncanonical human polyadenylation sites, suggesting novel noncoding RNA-specific polyadenylation mechanisms in humans. Furthermore, we observed the correlation level between sense and antisense transcripts to depend on gene expression levels, supporting the view that overlapping transcription from opposite strands may play a regulatory role. Our data provide a comprehensive view of the polyadenylation state and overlapping transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2135036759,"A Fermi gas of atoms with resonant interactions is predicted to obey universal hydrodynamics, where the shear viscosity and other transport coefficients are universal functions of the density and temperature. At low temperatures, the viscosity has a universal quantum scale $\hbar n$ where $n$ is the density, while at high temperatures the natural scale is $p_T^3/\hbar^2$ where $p_T$ is the thermal momentum. We employ breathing mode damping to measure the shear viscosity at low temperature. At high temperature $T$, we employ anisotropic expansion of the cloud to find the viscosity, which exhibits precise $T^{3/2}$ scaling. In both experiments, universal hydrodynamic equations including friction and heating are used to extract the viscosity. We estimate the ratio of the shear viscosity to the entropy density and compare to that of a perfect fluid."
https://openalex.org/W2033498063,"The ability of transcription factors to directly reprogram the identity of cell types is usually restricted and is defined by cellular context. Through the ectopic expression of single Caenorhabditis elegans transcription factors, we found that the identity of mitotic germ cells can be directly converted into that of specific neuron types: glutamatergic, cholinergic, or GABAergic. This reprogramming event requires the removal of the histone chaperone LIN-53 (RbAp46/48 in humans), a component of several histone remodeling and modifying complexes, and this removal can be mimicked by chemical inhibition of histone deacetylases. Our findings illustrate the ability of germ cells to be directly converted into individual, terminally differentiated neuron types and demonstrate that a specific chromatin factor provides a barrier for cellular reprogramming."

It is widely believed that an important initiating factor is the accumulation of the amyloid β peptide (Aβ) within the brain (1Yankner B.A. Lu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 4755-4759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 2Walsh D.M. Selkoe D.J. J. Neurochem. 2007; 101: 1172-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (1644) Google Scholar). Aβ is generated by the proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein, and the behaviors of the resulting peptide isoforms, largely Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42, are determined in large part by differences in their C-terminal residues. In the case of Aβ1–40, the peptide is 40 amino acids long and does not contain the final two hydrophobic residues that are present in the more aggregation-prone Aβ1–42. In some families, mutations in the APP gene result in amino acid substitutions within the Aβ peptide; a particular example of this is the Arctic mutation (E22G) that is linked to early onset autosomal dominant AD (3Nilsberth C. Westlind-Danielsson A. Eckman C.B. Condron M.M. Axelman K. Forsell C. Stenh C. Luthman J. Teplow D.B. Younkin S.G. Näslund J. Lannfelt L. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 887-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). In both sporadic and familial AD, however, it is the aggregation-prone Aβ peptide that comprises the amyloid plaques that are seen in the brain of individuals with AD (4Hardy J.A. Higgins G.A. Science. 1992; 256: 184-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (4906) Google Scholar). However, the mature amyloid fibrils that constitute these plaques are not thought to be the prime cytotoxic agent; rather there is strong evidence both in vitro and in vivo that the most toxic Aβ aggregates are small, soluble species that precede, but may also accompany, the appearance of mature fibrils (5Lambert M.P. Barlow A.K. Chromy B.A. Edwards C. Freed R. Liosatos M. Morgan T.E. Rozovsky I. Trommer B. Viola K.L. Wals P. Zhang C. Finch C.E. Krafft G.A. Klein W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The consequent phenotypes correlate well with the propensity of a range of Aβ variants to form soluble aggregates (7Luheshi L.M. Tartaglia G.G. Brorsson A.C. Pawar A.P. Watson I.E. Chiti F.

Accordingly, we have shown that ferritin heavy chain can reduce oxidative damage in our model system; remarkably, ferritin is able to exert these beneficial effects despite a concomitant increase, sometimes more than 2-fold, in the accumulation of Aβ in the brains of flies (8Rival T. Page R.M. Chandraratna D.S. Sendall T.J. Ryder E. Liu B. Lewis H. Rosahl T. Hider R. Camargo L.M. Shearman M.S. Crowther D.C. Lomas D.A. Eur. J.

However, the role of iron in the aggregation of Aβ has been questioned because of the biophysical evidence that there is no high affinity interaction between the two (16Wan L. Nie G. Zhang J. Luo Y. Zhang P. Zhang Z. Zhao B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2010; (in press)Google Scholar). In this work, we employ fly, cell culture, and in vitro model systems to investigate how iron chelation renders Aβ aggregates non-toxic.DISCUSSIONMetal ions are strongly implicated as cofactors in the pathogenesis of AD. Indeed, many investigators have shown that copper, zinc, and iron can exacerbate the oxidative damage that accompanies Aβ peptide aggregation (26Garzon-Rodriguez W. Yatsimirsky A.K. Glabe C.G. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1999; 9: 2243-2248Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 27Huang X. Moir R.D. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. Rogers J.T. Ann. N.Y. Acad.

Furthermore, iron and other metals are present in high concentrations in amyloid plaques in the brains of individuals with AD (29Bush A.I. Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 207-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). The importance of iron was highlighted by our genetic screen in a Drosophila model system that faithfully reports the toxicity of soluble aggregates of Aβ (7Luheshi L.M. Tartaglia G.G. Brorsson A.C. Pawar A.P. Watson I.E. Chiti F. Vendruscolo M. Lomas D.A. Dobson C.M. Crowther D.C. PLoS. Biol. 2007; 5: e290Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 17Brorsson A.C. Bolognesi B. Tartaglia G.G.

J. 2010; 98: 1677-1684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In that study, we generated fly lines that exhibited altered sensitivity to Aβ toxicity, and remarkably, the most powerful phenotypic rescue was seen in flies where subunits of the iron-binding protein ferritin were co-overexpressed with Aβ. We showed that this rescue was accompanied by a reduction in the oxidative damage in the brain, and furthermore, our genetic dissection pointed to the generation of the hydroxyl radical, by the iron-catalyzed Fenton reaction, as the most important pathological step (8Rival T. Page R.M. Chandraratna D.S. Sendall T.J. Ryder E. Liu B. Lewis H. Rosahl T. Hider R. Camargo L.M. Shearman M.S. Crowther D.C. Lomas D.A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 1335-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, our previous study left unexplained the observation that flies expressing both the heavy and the light chains of ferritin showed phenotypic rescues despite accumulating more Aβ in their brains. Under such conditions, the Aβ deposits are more stable and less toxic. These findings support a dual role for iron in generating toxicity, firstly by acting as a cofactor in the generation of reactive oxygen species via the Fenton reaction, a mechanism that requires the presence of Fe(II) ion. In this regard, we previously found that overexpression of FerHCH was most effective at suppressing toxicity presumably because, in addition to the chelating role it shares with FerLCH, the heavy chain subunit is also able to oxidize Fe(II) to the less redox-active Fe(III). The second role for iron is likely to be as a modulator of Aβ aggregation. The goals of the current study were to confirm the interaction between iron binding and Aβ toxicity in our in vivo model and then to look at the effects that iron had on aggregation and consequent toxicity.Our first experiments confirmed the importance of iron metabolism in Aβ toxicity by treating flies with the iron-selective chelating agent YM-F24. Previous data showing that the broad spectrum metal chelator clioquinol could rescue Aβ toxicity did not permit a dissection of the relative significance of copper, zinc, or iron. The finding that YM-F24 can significantly prolong the lifespan of flies expressing the aggregation-prone Aβ1–42 and Arctic Aβ1–42 peptides indicates that iron does indeed have an important role in mediating toxicity. We also probed the endogenous iron binding capacity of the fly by observing the effect of RNAi knockdown of endogenous Drosophila ferritin. We found the interaction between Aβ expression and ferritin RNAi to be remarkably strong, with high levels of synthetic lethality, particularly in flies expressing Aβ1–42 and Arctic Aβ1–42 in their brains. For this reason, we could not perform longevity assays, and instead, we quantified the developmental lethality. When we controlled for the lethality associated with ferritin RNAi in control flies not expressing Aβ, we found that the interaction between the two was particularly apparent for Aβ1–42 and Arctic Aβ1–42. For both these peptides, the co-expression of FerHCH and FerLCH RNAi constructs increased the lethality (h.e. = 44–69% for Aβ flies with the RNAi versus 92–100% for controls with the RNAi). For flies expressing the normally non-toxic Aβ1–40, we found that co-expression of FerHCH, but not FerLCH, RNAi constructs caused a large reduction in hatching efficiency (h.e. = 57% for Aβ1–40 versus 109% for controls). It is interesting to note that although FerLCH RNAi is increasingly lethal in combination with Aβ isoforms of increasing aggregation propensity, the same is not true for FerHCH RNAi. We speculate that this may reflect the differing biological properties of the ferritin subunits, in particular the presence of ferroxidase activity in the heavy chain that is not present in the light chain. However, the precise reason for these differences has not been established.The protection afforded by the iron-selective chelator YM-F24 and the link between ferritin RNAi and reduced hatching efficiency in the presence of Aβ confirmed iron as a cofactor in the generation of Aβ toxicity. This is concordant with our previous finding that in the presence of ferritin overexpression, Aβ can accumulate to high levels and yet fails to induce toxicity. To understand how the specific toxicity of the Aβ aggregates might be reduced in the absence of iron, we studied the effect of iron on the aggregation properties of Aβ1–42 using a number of biophysical techniques. Specifically, x-ray fiber diffraction demonstrated that the presence of iron during the aggregation of Aβ1–42 resulted in fibrils that were less ordered than control reactions performed in the absence of iron (Fig. 2). The regular and elongated morphology of the iron-free fibrils would predictably favor their ordered alignment within the x-ray diffraction sample and probably accounts for the high definition images that were obtained in such conditions (Fig. 3a). The principal x-ray diffraction findings were characteristic cross-β reflections at 4.6 Å on the meridian and at 9.6 Å on the equator. There were also novel reflections present indicating longer range repeats in fibril structure of 14.4 and 24.5 Å. The fibrils formed in the presence of iron also showed characteristic 4.6 and 9.6 Å reflections; however, the quality of the images was poor, most likely because of irregular fibril alignment, although increased disorder within the fibrils themselves is also possible. It is notable that there are no intense iron spots in Fig. 3b, indicating that iron is not stably bound to the peptides in the fibrils (30Dong J. Atwood C.S. Anderson V.E. Siedlak S.L. Smith M.A. Perry G. Carey P.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2768-2773Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar).Thus iron can alter the structure of Aβ amyloid by favoring the generation of less ordered fibrils. To investigate the kinetics of this effect, we used CD spectroscopy to determine how iron affected the generation of secondary structure. Both in the presence and in the absence of iron, there was a progressive increase in β-sheet structure with time (Fig. 4, a versus b, and 4c); however, iron was seen to impede this structural progression. Iron was able to delay the formation of a mature amyloid population by increasing the lifespan of smaller, soluble species that are thought to be most toxic in vivo. The kinetics of aggregation were also studied using thioflavin T fluorescence in the presence of increasing concentrations of iron. In these experiments, there is a remarkable reduction in the fluorescence signal as the iron concentration is increased (Fig. 5a) despite the formation of amyloid fibrils as determined by electron microscopy. This loss of signal is not due to competition between iron and thioflavin T for access to the fibrils because fibrils that were formed in the absence of iron but then spiked with iron generated a normal fluorescence signal when thioflavin T was subsequently added (Fig. 5b). Remarkably, we were able to show that there is a strain-like difference between fibrils generated in the presence or absence of iron. Specifically, we have demonstrated that fibrils generated in the presence of iron are not able to seed the generation of Aβ amyloid when iron is no longer present.These data strongly suggest that although the aggregates formed by Aβ in the presence and absence of iron share some cross-β structure, they differ in two important ways. Firstly, the final structure in the presence of iron is distinctly less ordered and does not interact with thioflavin T. Secondly, the kinetics of Aβ aggregation are slowed, and intermediate conformers are stabilized.Next we assessed whether these differences in aggregate conformation were mirrored by differential cytotoxicity. We found that neither 10 μm freshly prepared Aβ nor iron alone (in the form of the hydroxide) was toxic when added to SH-SY5Y cells. Likewise Aβ did not acquire toxicity when it was allowed to aggregate in the absence of iron and then spiked with iron. In contrast, the presence of iron during the Aβ aggregation reaction caused robust toxicity, resulting in a greater than 20% reduction in the live/dead ratio as compared with the other conditions (Fig. 6c). Measurement of the surface expression of annexin V using flow cytometry showed that this marker of apoptosis is greatly increased when iron is present during the Aβ aggregation reaction as compared with control reactions that were spiked after aggregation (supplemental Fig. S1).These observations help us to understand how iron can have profound effects on the toxicity of the Aβ peptide despite the absence of any observable high affinity interaction in vivo (30Dong J. Atwood C.S. Anderson V.E. Siedlak S.L. Smith M.A. Perry G. Carey P.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2768-2773Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Although recent in vitro studies have shown that iron can interact with soluble Aβ (31Nair N.G. Perry G. Smith M.A. Reddy V.P. J. Alzheimers Dis. 2010; 20: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we find that iron is not incorporated into amyloid, but rather it delays the formation of mature, well ordered, fibrillar aggregates. This iron-mediated stabilization of soluble intermediate Aβ species, probably by modifying the kinetics of aggregation through low affinity interactions, explains much, if not all, of the toxicity observed in our experimental models. These findings further justify the search for potent iron-chelating agents such as YM-F24 that may have therapeutic value in Alzheimer disease (32Molina-Holgado F. Hider R.C. Gaeta A. Williams R. Francis P. Biometals. 2007; 20: 639-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) by favoring the non-toxic deposition of Aβ.

Accordingly, we have shown that ferritin heavy chain can reduce oxidative damage in our model system; remarkably, ferritin is able to exert these beneficial effects despite a concomitant increase, sometimes more than 2-fold, in the accumulation of Aβ in the brains of flies (8Rival T.

However, the role of iron in the aggregation of Aβ has been questioned because of the biophysical evidence that there is no high affinity interaction between the two (16Wan L. Nie G. Zhang J. Luo Y.

It is widely believed that an important initiating factor is the accumulation of the amyloid β peptide (Aβ) within the brain (1Yankner B.A. Lu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 4755-4759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 2Walsh D.M. Selkoe D.J. J. Neurochem. 2007; 101: 1172-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (1644) Google Scholar). Aβ is generated by the proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein, and the behaviors of the resulting peptide isoforms, largely Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42, are determined in large part by differences in their C-terminal residues. In the case of Aβ1–40, the peptide is 40 amino acids long and does not contain the final two hydrophobic residues that are present in the more aggregation-prone Aβ1–42. In some families, mutations in the APP gene result in amino acid substitutions within the Aβ peptide; a particular example of this is the Arctic mutation (E22G) that is linked to early onset autosomal dominant AD (3Nilsberth C. Westlind-Danielsson A. Eckman C.B. Condron M.M. Axelman K. Forsell C. Stenh C. Luthman J. Teplow D.B. Younkin S.G. Näslund J. Lannfelt L. Nat.

In both sporadic and familial AD, however, it is the aggregation-prone Aβ peptide that comprises the amyloid plaques that are seen in the brain of individuals with AD (4Hardy J.A. Higgins G.A. Science. 1992; 256: 184-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (4906) Google Scholar). However, the mature amyloid fibrils that constitute these plaques are not thought to be the prime cytotoxic agent; rather there is strong evidence both in vitro and in vivo that the most toxic Aβ aggregates are small, soluble species that precede, but may also accompany, the appearance of mature fibrils (5Lambert M.P. Barlow A.K. Chromy B.A. Edwards C. Freed R. Liosatos M. Morgan T.E. Rozovsky I. Trommer B. Viola K.L. Wals P. Zhang C. Finch C.E. Krafft G.A. Klein W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

https://openalex.org/W2014100153,"Members of the perilipin family of lipid droplet scaffold proteins are thought to play important roles in tissue-specific regulation of triglyceride metabolism, but the mechanisms involved are not fully understood. Present results indicate that adipose triglyceride lipase (Atgl) interacts with perilipin-5 (Plin5) but not perilipin-1 (Plin1). Protein interaction assays in live cells and in situ binding experiments showed that Atgl and its protein activator, α-β-hydrolase domain-containing 5 (Abhd5), each bind Plin5. Surprisingly, competition experiments indicated that individual Plin5 molecules bind Atgl or Abhd5 but not both simultaneously. Thus, the ability of Plin5 to concentrate these proteins at droplet surfaces involves binding to different Plin5 molecules, possibly in an oligomeric complex. The association of Plin5-Abhd5 complexes on lipid droplet surfaces was more stable than Plin5-Atgl complexes, and oleic acid treatment selectively promoted the interaction of Plin5 and Abhd5. Analysis of chimeric and mutant perilipin proteins demonstrated that amino acids 200-463 are necessary and sufficient to bind both Atgl and Abhd5 and that the C-terminal 64 amino acids of Plin5 are critical for the differential binding of Atgl to Plin5 and Plin1. Mutant Plin5 that binds Abhd5 but not Atgl was defective in preventing neutral lipid accumulation compared with wild type Plin5, indicating that the ability of Plin5 to concentrate these proteins on lipid droplets is critical to functional Atgl activity in cells."

Under high boron conditions, the Arabidopsis thaliana borate transporter BOR1 is trafficked from the plasma membrane (PM) to the vacuole via the endocytic pathway for degradation to avoid excess boron transport. Here, we show that boron-induced ubiquitination is required for vacuolar sorting of BOR1. We found that a substitution of lysine 590 with alanine (K590A) in BOR1 blocked degradation. BOR1 was mono- or diubiquitinated within several minutes after applying a high concentration of boron, whereas the K590A mutant was not. The K590A mutation abolished vacuolar transport of BOR1 but did not apparently affect polar localization to the inner PM domains. Furthermore, brefeldin A and wortmannin treatment suggested that Lys-590 is required for BOR1 translocation from an early endosomal compartment to multivesicular bodies. Our results show that boron-induced ubiquitination of BOR1 is not required for endocytosis from the PM but is crucial for the sorting of internalized BOR1 to multivesicular bodies for subsequent degradation in vacuoles."

Here, we identify the KA1 domain (kinase associated-1 domain), found at the C terminus of yeast septin-associated kinases (Kcc4p, Gin4p, and Hsl1p) and human MARK/PAR1 kinases, as a membrane association domain that binds acidic phospholipids. Membrane localization of isolated KA1 domains depends on phosphatidylserine. Using X-ray crystallography, we identified a structurally conserved binding site for anionic phospholipids in KA1 domains from Kcc4p and MARK1. Mutating this site impairs membrane association of both KA1 domains and intact proteins and reveals the importance of phosphatidylserine for bud neck localization of yeast Kcc4p. Our data suggest that KA1 domains contribute to “coincidence detection,” allowing kinases to bind other regulators (such as septins) only at the membrane surface. These findings have important implications for understanding MARK/PAR1 kinases, which are implicated in Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and autism.PaperClip/cms/asset/530be5b9-a6bf-4edc-b437-7c0106e2a9f7/mmc2.mp3Loading ...(mp3, 3.57 MB) Download audio"

Crystal structure of dengue virus MTase with a bound SAH derivative revealed that its N6-substituent bound in this cavity and induced conformation changes in residues lining the pocket.

Although the amino acid sequences of human P450s 1B1 and 1A2 have diverged significantly, both enzymes exhibit narrow active site cavities, which underlie similarities in their substrate profiles. Helix I residues adopt a relatively flat conformation in both enzymes, and a characteristic distortion of helix F places Phe(231) in 1B1 and Phe(226) in 1A2 in similar positions for π-π stacking with ANF. ANF binds in a distinctly different orientation in P450 1B1 from that observed for 1A2. This reflects, in part, divergent conformations of the helix B'-C loop that are stabilized by different hydrogen-bonding interactions in the two enzymes. Additionally, differences between the two enzymes for other amino acids that line the edges of the cavity contribute to distinct orientations of ANF in the two active sites. Thus, the narrow cavity is conserved in both P450 subfamily 1A and P450 subfamily 1B with sequence divergence around the edges of the cavity that modify substrate and inhibitor binding. The conservation of these P450 1B1 active site amino acid residues across vertebrate species suggests that these structural features are conserved."
https://openalex.org/W2094108957,"The proprotein convertase PCSK9 plays a key role in cholesterol homeostasis by binding the LDL receptor and targeting it toward degradation. PCSK9 is strongly expressed in the liver and is found in human and mouse plasma as mature (∼ 62 kDa) and inactivated (∼ 55 kDa) forms. Ex vivo data showed that human PCSK9 is inactivated by cleavage at Arg(218)↓ by the overexpressed convertases furin and PC5/6A. Analysis of the plasma of human heterozygotes for R218S and F216L mutations revealed a ∼ 50% reduction in the levels of the ∼ 55-kDa form. To identify the convertase(s) responsible for cleavage at Arg(218) in vivo, we inactivated the genes of furin and/or PC5/6 specifically in hepatocytes. The PCSK9-inactivated form was strongly reduced in mice lacking furin in hepatocytes (Fur-hKO) and only slightly reduced in PC5/6-hKO plasma. In agreement with a key role of furin in regulating PCSK9 activity in vivo, we observed an overall 26% drop in the LDL receptor protein levels of Fur-hKO livers, likely due to the compound effects of a 35% increase in PCSK9 mRNA levels and the loss of PCSK9 cleavage, suggesting a higher activity of PCSK9 in these mice. Overexpression of PCSK9 in primary hepatocytes obtained from these mice revealed that only full-length, membrane-bound, but not soluble, furin is the cognate convertase. We conclude that in hepatocytes furin regulates PCSK9 mRNA levels and is the key in vivo-inactivating protease of circulating PCSK9."

https://openalex.org/W2112441403,"To understand relationships between phosphorylation-based signaling pathways, we analyzed 150 deletion mutants of protein kinases and phosphatases in S. cerevisiae using DNA microarrays. Downstream changes in gene expression were treated as a phenotypic readout. Double mutants with synthetic genetic interactions were included to investigate genetic buffering relationships such as redundancy. Three types of genetic buffering relationships are identified: mixed epistasis, complete redundancy, and quantitative redundancy. In mixed epistasis, the most common buffering relationship, different gene sets respond in different epistatic ways. Mixed epistasis arises from pairs of regulators that have only partial overlap in function and that are coupled by additional regulatory links such as repression of one by the other. Such regulatory modules confer the ability to control different combinations of processes depending on condition or context. These properties likely contribute to the evolutionary maintenance of paralogs and indicate a way in which signaling pathways connect for multiprocess control."

Signaling in stem cell niches: lessons from the Drosophila germline.J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The asymmetric division of GSCs takes place within a niche made up of a small number of stromal cells (terminal filament, cap cells, and inner sheath cells) at the tip of the germarium (Figures 1A and 1C ) to produce two daughter cells along the anterior-posterior axis of the ovary. The anterior daughter cell retains contact with the stromal cap cells and becomes a stem cell, whereas the posterior daughter cell dissociates from the cap cells but associates with inner sheath cells and becomes a cystoblast (CB), which divides four times to produce a cyst of 16 interconnected cells that can sustain oogenesis. The stromal cells form the niche by secreting signaling ligands that direct the fate of GSCs and their immediate daughter cells (King et al., 2001King F.J. Szakmary A. Cox D.N. Lin H.

Given that bam expression is essential for differentiation of CBs, cells with active BMP signaling cannot differentiate but remain GSCs by default. Thus, bam silencing is the hallmark of asymmetry in the Drosophila ovarian germline stem cell niche, and its range is restricted to one cell diameter at the most anterior end of the germarium (Chen and McKearin, 2003bChen D. McKearin D.M.

How is this very steep gradient of BMP response formed? One possible explanation is that Dpp/Gbb ligands are secreted only from one point source, such as cap cells. Previous studies, however, have suggested that the Dpp ligands are present in both cap cells and inner sheath cells (Casanueva and Ferguson, 2004Casanueva M.O. Ferguson E.L.

An alternative possibility (Figure 1B) is that CBs develop a cell-autonomous mechanism to antagonize BMP/Dpp activity and derepress bam transcription to promote their differentiation. The transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) and BMP signals play important roles in controlling diverse normal developmental processes as well as tissue homeostasis (Feng and Derynck, 2005Feng X.H.

Dysregulation of TGFβ/BMP signals results in numerous developmental abnormalities and has been linked to many human diseases, including cancer and degenerative diseases. Therefore the precise activity of TGFβ/BMP must be tightly controlled. TGFβ/BMP signaling has been proposed to be balanced through the regulation of Smads and/or their receptors to trigger distinct target gene expression in a spatiotemporal manner (Itoh and ten Dijke, 2007Itoh S. ten Dijke P.

In Drosophila ovary, it has been shown that BMP signaling maintains GSCs, whereas diminished signaling, such as that produced by the action of Drosophila smurf, promotes CB differentiation (Casanueva and Ferguson, 2004Casanueva M.O. Ferguson E.L. Germline stem cell number in the Drosophila ovary is regulated by redundant mechanisms that control Dpp signaling.Development. 2004; 131: 1881-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the Smurf-mediated regulation of BMP in Drosophila germline cells remain elusive. In this study, we have identified a mechanism involving Fused (Fu), a serine/threonine kinase, which regulates Hedgehog (Hh) signaling as a core component of Hh-signaling complexes, functions in concert with Smurf to promote the proper turnover of Thickveins (Tkv), and generates a steep gradient of BMP activity between GSCs and CBs. In addition, we find that the roles of Fu in regulating the BMP/TGFβ signaling pathway are conserved in zebrafish during embryonic development and in human cell cultures. To understand the mechanism underlying the formation of a steep gradient of BMP response between GSCs and differentiated CBs, we used a transgene that expressed the constitutively active Dpp receptor, Tkv(ca) (Wieser et al., 1995Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. GS domain mutations that constitutively activate T beta R-I, the downstream signaling component in the TGF-beta receptor complex.EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar), to explore the sensitivity of CBs to BMP signaling. It has been shown that driving Tkv(ca) expression in pole cells, primordial germ cells, and adult germ cells with a nanos promoter (Van Doren et al., 1998Van Doren M. Williamson A.L. Lehmann R. Regulation of zygotic gene expression in Drosophila primordial germ cells.Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 243-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) blocked bam transcription, prevented GSC differentiation, and caused germ cell hyperplasia (Casanueva and Ferguson, 2004Casanueva M.O. Ferguson E.L. Germline stem cell number in the Drosophila ovary is regulated by redundant mechanisms that control Dpp signaling.Development. 2004; 131: 1881-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar; Figure 1D). We were surprised, however, to find that controlling expression of Tkv(ca) with a bam promoter (Chen and McKearin, 2003bChen D. McKearin D.M. A discrete transcriptional silencer in the bam gene determines asymmetric division of the Drosophila germline stem cell.Development. 2003; 130: 1159-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) permitted normal germline development (Figure 1E). To exclude the possibility that transcriptional delays accounted for the failure of Tkv(ca) to block bam expression due to the bipartite strategy, we attempted to transcribe the Tkv(ca) transgene P{bamP-gal4:vp16}; P{uasp-tkv(ca)}. We therefore repeated the experiment with the new transgenes, P{bamP-tkv(ca)} or P{bamP-tkv(ca):gfp}, in which either tkv(ca) or tkv(ca):gfp was placed directly under the control of the bam promoter. These transgenes produced normal oogenesis and wild-type expression patterns of Bam and Hts proteins in ovaries (Figures 1F–1J). Whereas females carrying either the P{bamP-tkv(ca)} or P{bamP-tkv(ca):gfp} transgene were fertile, transgenic males were sterile, and their testes filled with many undifferentiated germ cells lacking Bam expression (Figure S1 available online), indicating that these transgenes were indeed active. Thus, our results suggested that, in contrast to GSCs, CBs become insensitive to BMP signaling. To investigate the mechanism underlying the potential antagonism of BMP signaling in CBs, we examined Tkv(ca):GFP expression driven by the bam promoter at both the transcriptional and protein levels. As shown in a quantitative RT-PCR analysis, there was similar gfp expression in P{bamP-gfp}ovaries and tkv:gfp (a wild-type form of tkv tagged with gfp) expression in P{bamP-tkv:gfp}ovaries, with tkv(ca):gfp expression present at normal levels in P{bamP-tkv(ca):gfp} ovaries (Figure 1N). Consistent with this observation, no difference in the endogenous bam expression was detected in ovaries of these transgene flies (Figure 1O), suggesting that the bam promoter had normal transcriptional activity in P{bamP-tkv(ca):gfp} ovaries. We then performed analysis by both immunostaining and western blot to examine the expression of Tkv(ca):GFP in P{bamP-tkv(ca):gfp} ovaries. As shown in Figures 1K–1M and 1P, GFP and Tkv:GFP were easily detected in control ovaries from P{bamP-gfp} and P{bamP-tkv:gfp} transgene flies, respectively. However, no apparent expression of Tkv(ca):GFP was observed in P{bamP-tkv(ca):gfp} ovaries, revealing the existence of a mechanism that negatively regulates the activated form of Tkv at the protein level in CBs. To explore how Tkv is regulated, we performed immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry to search for Tkv-interacting factor(s). Mass spectrometry analysis of Flag-Tkv complexes from S2 cells, which were treated with MG132, revealed that Fused (Fu), which has been demonstrated as a positive regulator in Hh signaling, was present in the Tkv complex (Figure 2A ). Reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiments showed that Fu and Tkv could be coimmunoprecipitated with each other in transfected S2 cells (Figures 2B and 2C), indicating that Fu and Tkv could form a complex together. Domain mapping of Tkv showed that the fragment lacking extracellular and transmembrane regions exhibited the strongest binding activity to Fu (Figure 2F), although all of the truncation mutants of Tkv (Figure 2D) interacted with Fu. Domain mapping of Fu showed that both the N and C terminus of Fu could associate with Tkv (Figures 2E and 2G). Further detailed domain mapping analysis revealed that the STYKc domain is essential for Tkv interaction with the N terminus of Fu (Figures S2A–S2D).Figure S2The STYKc Domain in Tkv Interacts with FuN, and Ectopic Expression of Src:Fu Downregulates Tkv(ca):GFP in Drosophila Early Embryos, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A and B) Schematic drawings of Tkv and Fu and their truncated forms of mutants correspond to C and D.(C and D) S2 cells were transfected with different combinations of DNA constructs as indicated.

These findings suggest that Fu negatively regulates Tkv stability in the Drosophila early embryo. Scale bar represents 20 μm. To test whether Fu acts in balancing BMP/Dpp signal activity by regulating Tkv to control the fate of GSCs and CBs, we examined the behavior of fuA mutant germ cells at an early stage by measuring the number of germ cells carrying spectrosomes in ovaries using a previously described method (Cox et al., 2000Cox D.N. Chao A. Lin H. piwi encodes a nucleoplasmic factor whose activity modulates the number and division rate of germline stem cells.Development. 2000; 127: 503-514PubMed Google Scholar). We observed that, in contrast to the wild-type control, the fuA mutant contained multiple types of germaria, with each type carrying different numbers of the spectrosome-containing germ cells. Approximately 10% of germaria (n = 113) contained a normal number of the spectrosome-containing germ cells per germarium (Figure 2H), nearly 60% of germaria (n = 113) contained 5–10 GSC-like cells, and 30% of germaria (n = 113) were tumorous (Figures 2H–2J and 2L), suggesting that loss of fu blocks or delays GSC/CB differentiation. Because the defects of GSC/CB differentiation associated with the fu mutant can be rescued by the transgene P{fuP-fu} (Figures 2K and L), we concluded that fu is required for the proper differentiation of GSCs/CBs. To determine whether fu has a cell-autonomous role in promoting germ cell differentiation, we specifically knocked down fu in CBs by constructing P{uasp-shmiR-fu}; P{bamP-gal4:vp16} flies according to a method described previously (Haley et al., 2008Haley B. Hendrix D. Trang V. Levine M. A simplified miRNA-based gene silencing method for Drosophila melanogaster.Dev. Biol. 2008; 321: 482-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As shown in Figures S3A–S3E, knockdown of fu by the bam promoter increased the number of GSC-like cells to nearly seven per germarium (n = 72) (Figure S3B). Similarly, in P{uasp-shmiR-fu}; P{nosP-gal4:vp16} ovaries, ∼90% of germaria (n = 111) contained 5–10 GSC-like cells (Figure S3C), and nearly 5% of germaria were tumorous (Figure S3C′). Thus, fu has a cell-autonomous role in promoting germ cell differentiation. We then asked whether the kinase activity was essential for the function of Fu in germ cells by generating a transgene line, P{fuP-fuKD}, which expresses a kinase dead form of Fu, FuKD, by the fu promoter. As shown in Figures S3F and S3G, in contrast to P{fuP-fu}, P{fuP-fuKD} completely failed to rescue germ cell defects in fu mutant, revealing that fu acts in a kinase-dependent manner for germ cell differentiation. Previous studies have shown that CB differentiation was controlled by either the bam-dependent or bam-independent pathway (Chen and McKearin, 2005Chen D. McKearin D. Gene circuitry controlling a stem cell niche.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 179-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, Szakmary et al., 2005Szakmary A. Cox D.N. Wang Z. Lin H.

Biol. 2005; 15: 171-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To define the pathway through which fu acts, we overexpressed bam on a fu mutant background using the transgene P{hs-bam} (Ohlstein and McKearin, 1997Ohlstein B. McKearin D. Ectopic expression of the Drosophila Bam protein eliminates oogenic germline stem cells.Development. 1997; 124: 3651-3662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Figures S3H and S3I, ectopic expression of bam completely drove fu mutant germ cell differentiation, suggesting that fu acts mainly in a bam-dependent manner for the differentiation of GSCs and CBs, raising the possibility that fu acts as a negative component of the Dpp pathway. We then tested whether the ectopic GSC-like cells in fu mutants respond to Dpp signaling by introducing the Dpp-responsive reporters, bamP-gfp and dad-lacZ, into the fu mutant background. In agreement with previous findings (Narbonne-Reveau et al., 2006Narbonne-Reveau K. Besse F. Lamour-Isnard C. Busson D. Pret A.M. fused regulates germline cyst mitosis and differentiation during Drosophila oogenesis.Mech. Dev. 2006; 123: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), we found that many of the fu-inducing GSC-like cells behaved as GSCs rather than CBs, given that gfp was negative and lacZ was positive in these cells (Figures 3D–3G ). To test whether the induction of GSC-like cells through the loss of fu depends on the activity of the dpp signal, we employed the transgene P{uasp-dad} (Jiang et al., 2008Jiang X. Xia L. Chen D. Yang Y. Huang H. Yang L. Zhao Q. Shen L. Wang J. Chen D. Otefin, a nuclear membrane protein, determines the fate of germline stem cells in Drosophila via interaction with Smad complexes.Dev. Cell. 2008; 14: 494-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) to overexpress Dad (the Drosophila Smad6/7 homolog), a BMP/Dpp inhibitor. As shown in Figures S3J–S3L, ectopic expression of Dad also completely drove fu mutant germ cell differentiation, suggesting that induction of GSC-like cells through the loss of fu depends on Dpp signaling. Taken together, our findings strongly argue that fu is intrinsically required for GSC and CB differentiation by antagonizing Dpp signaling. Given that Fu forms a complex with Tkv, we then asked whether fu has a direct role in affecting Dpp signaling through regulating the expression of Tkv and established a bam transcription-dependent luciferase reporter assay in S2 cells. As shown in Figure 3A, the bam transcription reporter was silenced by the expression of Tkv(ca) in a dose-dependent manner, which mimics the response of the bam promoter to Dpp signaling in the in vivo GSC system. Of interest, we found that knockdown of fu in S2 cells increased stability of the Tkv protein (Figure 3C) and accordingly enhanced Tkv-mediated bam transcriptional silencing (Figure 3B), indicating that knockdown of fu influences the Dpp signal by stabilizing the Tkv protein. To confirm this finding, we performed a genetic assay by constructing the strain fu; P{bamP-tkv(ca):gfp}/+. As shown in Figures 3M–3O, constitutive dpp signaling from the transgene P{bamP-tkv(ca):gfp} resulted in a stronger tumorous germarium phenotype in the fu mutant background than that in fu mutant alone. Consistently, overexpression of an activated form of Fu, in which the Fu protein was tagged with an SRC domain at its N terminus (Jia et al., 2003Jia J. Tong C. Jiang J.

Biol. 2007; 17: 1326-1333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), partially suppressed the overexpression of Tkv(ca) driven by the nanos promoter, as indicated by the presence of branched fusomes and ectopic Bam expression, as well as 30% of ovarioles (n = 50) carrying normal egg chambers, in P{uasp-tkv(ca)}; P{nosP-gal4:vp16}/P{uasp-SRC-fu} ovaries (Figures 3H–3L). Taken together, we argue that Fu negatively regulates Tkv stability to determine the fate of GSCs and CBs. We noted that the phenotype of the GSC-like cells in the fu mutant ovary resembled that in the Drosophila smurf mutant. It has been shown that smurf antagonizes BMP signaling by targeting phosphorylated Mad for degradation in Drosophila somatic cells (Liang et al., 2003Liang Y.Y. Lin X. Liang M. Brunicardi F.C. ten Dijke P. Chen Z. Choi K.W. Feng X.H. dSmurf selectively degrades decapentaplegic-activated MAD, and its overexpression disrupts imaginal disc development.J. Biol.

The DSmurf ubiquitin-protein ligase restricts BMP signaling spatially and temporally during Drosophila embryogenesis.Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 567-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In ovaries, smurf transcript is ubiquitously present in the germarium (Figures S4E and S4F ), and loss of smurf delays the differentiation of CBs (Casanueva and Ferguson, 2004Casanueva M.O. Ferguson E.L. Germline stem cell number in the Drosophila ovary is regulated by redundant mechanisms that control Dpp signaling.Development. 2004; 131: 1881-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism underlying the action of smurf in CBs remains unknown. To test whether smurf is involved in regulating Tkv, we performed coimmunoprecipitation and reporter assays as well as ubiquitination analysis of Tkv in S2 cells. As shown in Figures S4A and S4B, Smurf and Tkv coimmunoprecipitated with each other. Knockdown of smurf reduced the ubiquitination of Tkv (Figure 5F) and accordingly enhanced Tkv-mediated bam reporter silencing (Figure 4I ). To determine the biological importance of this interaction in vivo, we examined the genetic relationship between smurf and tkv in the ovary. As shown in Figures S4C and S4D, overexpression of Tkv(ca) driven by the bam promoter in the smurf mutant strongly blocked CB differentiation. Nearly 38% of the ovarioles (n = 84) was composed of a tumorous germarium, and 62% of the ovarioles (n = 84) contained tumorous germaria that were attached to one or several egg chambers, suggesting that, like in the fu mutant background, smurf mutant germ cells were also much more sensitive to Dpp signaling than were smurf+ cells.Figure 4Fu Physically and Genetically Interacts with SmurfShow full caption(A and B) S2 cells were transfected with combinations of DNA constructs as indicated.

This is commonly due to overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Mcl-1, which bind to the BH3 α-helical domain of pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax, Bak, Bad, and Bim, and inhibit their function. We designed a BH3 α-helical mimetic BH3-M6 that binds to Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 and prevents their binding to fluorescently labeled Bak- or Bim-BH3 peptides in vitro. Using several approaches, we demonstrate that BH3-M6 is a pan-Bcl-2 antagonist that inhibits the binding of Bcl-XL, Bcl-2, and Mcl-1 to multi-domain Bax or Bak, or BH3-only Bim or Bad in cell-free systems and in intact human cancer cells, freeing up pro-apoptotic proteins to induce apoptosis. BH3-M6 disruption of these protein-protein interactions is associated with cytochrome c release from mitochondria, caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage. Using caspase inhibitors and Bax and Bak siRNAs, we demonstrate that BH3-M6-induced apoptosis is caspase- and Bax-, but not Bak-dependent. Furthermore, BH3-M6 disrupts Bcl-XL/Bim, Bcl-2/Bim, and Mcl-1/Bim protein-protein interactions and frees up Bim to induce apoptosis in human cancer cells that depend for tumor survival on the neutralization of Bim with Bcl-XL, Bcl-2, or Mcl-1. Finally, BH3-M6 sensitizes cells to apoptosis induced by the proteasome inhibitor CEP-1612."

During this processive elongation, formins are predicted to rotate along the axis of the double helical F-actin structure (referred to here as helical rotation), although this has not yet been definitively shown. We demonstrated helical rotation of the formin mDia1 by single-molecule fluorescence polarization (FL(P)). FL(P) of labeled F-actin, both elongating and depolymerizing from immobilized mDia1, oscillated with a periodicity corresponding to that of the F-actin long-pitch helix, and this was not altered by actin-bound nucleotides or the actin-binding protein profilin. Thus, helical rotation is an intrinsic property of formins. To harness pushing forces from growing F-actin, formins must be anchored flexibly to cell structures."
https://openalex.org/W2072603086,"Elevated homocysteine (Hcys) serum levels represent a risk factor for several chronic pathologies, including cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, and chronic renal failure, and affect bone development, quality, and homeostasis. Hcys influences the formation of a stable bone matrix directly through the inhibition of the collagen cross-linking enzyme lysyl oxidase (Lox) and, as we have shown recently, by repressing its mRNA expression. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms involved in this process. Through evaluation of gene arrays, quantitative RT-PCR, immunoblots, and ELISA, we identified a Hcys-dependent stimulation of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and genes involved in IL-6/Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)-dependent signal transduction pathways in pre-osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. Moreover, up-regulation of genes essential for epigenetic DNA methylation (DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferases and helicase lymphoid-specific (Hells) was observed. Further investigations demonstrated that Hcys increased via IL-6/JAK2 the expression of Fli1 (Friend leukemia virus integration 1), a transcription factor, which we found essential for IL-6-dependent Dnmt1 stimulation. CpG methylation analysis of CpG-rich Lox proximal promoter revealed an increased CpG methylation status after treatment of the cells with Hcys indicating an epigenetic origin for Hcys-dependent Lox repression. Inhibition of the IL-6/JAK2 pathway or of CpG methylation reversed the repressive effect of Hcys on Lox expression. In conclusion, we demonstrate that Hcys stimulates IL-6 synthesis in osteoblasts, which is known to affect bone metabolism via osteoclasts. Furthermore, IL-6 stimulation results via JAK2, Fli1, and Dnmt1 in down-regulation of Lox expression by epigenetic CpG methylation revealing a new mechanism negatively affecting bone matrix formation."

Young (3 mo) and old (31 mo) FBNF1 rats were assigned into sedentary and exercise groups, with ET group rats training on a treadmill 45 min/d, 5 d/wk for 12 wk. Nonlinear optical microscopy (NLOM), histology, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and Western blot analyses were performed on the left ventricle and septum. NLOM, IHC, and histological imaging revealed that ET reduced age-associated elevation of collagen type I fibers. Active MMP-1, active MMP-2, and MMP-14 in the ECM fraction of the left ventricle were reduced by aging, an effect abrogated by ET.

IntroductionInteraction of inflammatory stimuli, such as cytokines and microbial products, with their cognate receptors induces ubiquitination and phosphorylation cascades that alter the transcriptional profile of the cell to produce factors including antimicrobials, chemokines (e.g. IL-8), and cytokines (e.g. TNFα; see Refs. 1O'Dea E.

A critical player in this process is the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NFκB), 3The abbreviations used are: NFκBnuclear factor κBIκBinhibitor of NFκBIKKIκB kinaseeGFPenhanced GFPEPECenteropathogenic E. coli. which forms homo- or heterodimers composed of p65 (RelA), RelB, c-Rel, p50, and p52 proteins, with the p65/p50 dimer being the most abundant and associated with the canonical NFκB pathway. The p65/p50 dimer is retained within the cytoplasm bound to the inhibitor of κB (IκB) until receptor-mediated activation of the inhibitor of κB kinase (IKK) phosphorylates IκB, thereby triggering its proteasomal degradation to release NFκB for import into the nucleus. Signaling by many receptors converges at the IKK complex, composed of IKKα, IKKβ, and the NFκB essential modulator (IKKγ), but often involves distinct or overlapping upstream adaptors including TRAF and MyD88 and serine/threonine kinases such as IRAK, TGF-β-activated kinase 1, and RIP1 (1O'Dea E.

In this study, we describe that the EPEC gene nleC encodes a protein which targets p65, p50, and IκBα proteins for degradation by a proteasome-independent mechanism. The findings suggest that NleC is a zinc metalloprotease that recruits NFκB complexes for degradation.DISCUSSIONHere, it is demonstrated that the nleC gene of enteropathogenic E. coli encodes a protein whose expression as an eGFP-fusion protein within HeLa cells potently inhibits the basal- and TNFα-stimulated activity of the NFκB transcription factor. This finding has applications for understanding and controlling the function of this critical component of mammalian inflammatory, immune modulation, and anti-apoptotic responses as its dysfunction is linked to inflammatory diseases and some cancers (10Sethi G. Sung B. Aggarwal B.B. Exp. Biol. Med. 2008; 233: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 11Kumar A. Takada Y. Boriek A.M. Aggarwal B.B. J. Mol. Med. 2004; 82: 434-448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although a variety of proteins delivered into host cells by bacterial pathogens have been described to inhibit NFκB activity (12Sansonetti P.J. Di Santo J.P. Immunity. 2007; 26: 149-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 13Bhavsar A.P. Guttman J.A. Finlay B.B. Nature. 2007; 449: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), this study reveals that NleC represents a novel mechanism. Thus, ectopic expression of NleC is shown to lead to a dramatic decrease in the cellular levels of both p65 (RelA) and p50 that comprise the most abundant form of the dimeric transcription factor in the canonical NFκB signaling pathway (3Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Cell. 2008; 132: 344-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3440) Google Scholar). Although most pathogen-encoded proteins target upstream kinases, ubiquitinases, and adaptor molecules (12Sansonetti P.J. Di Santo J.P. Immunity. 2007; 26: 149-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 13Bhavsar A.P. Guttman J.A. Finlay B.B. Nature. 2007; 449: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), some target NFκB components as illustrated by chlamydia infection leading to p65 processing, whereas another EPEC effector, NleH, binds RPS3 to inhibit transcription of genes under the control of a NFκB-RPS3 complex (21Gao X. Wan F. Mateo K. Callegari E. Wang D. Deng W. Puente J. Li F. Chaussee M.S. Finlay B.B. Lenardo M.J. Hardwidge P.R. PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000708Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 31Lad S.P. Li J. da Silva Correia J. Pan Q. Gadwal S. Ulevitch R.J. Li E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 2933-2938Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). By contrast, ectopic NleC expression induced the rapid proteasomal-independent loss of p65 without evidence of processing intermediates. Interestingly, the proteasomal inhibitor augmented NleC-mediated inhibition of NFκB activity to suggest that the effector may be subjected to proteasomal degradation. Importantly, NleC expression also induced the cellular loss of p50 and IκBα, but not the upstream pathway components IKKα or IKKβ, thereby demonstrating degradation specificity. IκB acts to retain NFκB within the cytoplasm until IKKα/β-induced phosphorylation triggers its proteasomal-dependent degradation and release of NFκB for nuclear import (2Vallabhapurapu S. Karin M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 693-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (1998) Google Scholar). This suggests that NleC targets NFκB-IκBα complexes. Proteasome-independent, not dependent, degradation of NFκB components represents a novel inhibitory mechanism.Fluorescent microscopy studies revealed a pool of eGFP-NleC within the nucleus, unlike the similarly sized eGFP-NleH protein that accumulates at the cell periphery (21Gao X. Wan F. Mateo K. Callegari E. Wang D. Deng W. Puente J. Li F. Chaussee M.S. Finlay B.B. Lenardo M.J. Hardwidge P.R. PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000708Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) (data not shown). As NleC is significantly larger than the cut-off size for free nuclear entry (<50 kDa), this suggests that it may carry a novel nuclear translocation signal (not evident by bioinformatic analysis; data not shown) or enters by associating with nuclear-targeted protein(s). Of interest, the EPEC EspF effector protein enters the nucleus by a process dependent on a domain with no recognizable signal sequence (32Dean P. Scott J.A. Knox A.A. Quitard S. Watkins N.J. Kenny B. PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1000961Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Given that NleC is normally delivered into the cytoplasm and degrades p65, p50, and IκBα, it is likely that its target relates to the cytoplasmic NFκB-IκBα complex. Given the multifunctional nature of EPEC effectors (26Dean P. Kenny B. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2009; 12: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), it is possible that nuclear import represents a distinct function or perhaps relates to targeting NFκB-IκBα complexes being shuttled to the cytoplasm. Time course studies (epifluorescent microscopy and Western blot analysis) have failed to resolve whether NleC has a preference for cytoplasmic or nuclear pools of NFκB (data not shown). The mechanism and role of nuclear NleC import in the NFκB inhibitory process deserves further investigation.Interestingly, ectopic NleC expression inhibited the basal NFκB activity in immortalized HeLa cells to a greater extent than the NFκB activation inhibitor from Calbiochem (product no. 481406). This suggests that this basal activity involves additional non-canonical pathways, of which some may be sensitive to NleC. It is likely that such pathways relate to other NFκB subunits composed of RelB, c-Rel, and/or p52 proteins. Moreover, as NleC expression depletes cellular p50, this implies that it would also alter the expression of genes regulated by p50 homodimers (33Schmitz M.L. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3805-3817Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Studies are underway to define whether NleC degrades specific isoforms of NFκB (p65, RelB, c-Rel, p105/p50, p100/p52), IκB (e.g. IκBβ, IκBγ, IκBϵ, Bcl3), NFκB-associated cofactors (e.g. RPS3, CBP/p300) and/or co-functional transcription factors (e.g. AP-1, STAT).The idea, that NleC employs a novel mechanism for inhibiting NFκB function was evidenced by the finding that loss of transcription activity not only involves proteasome-independent degradation of p65, p50, and IkBα in the absence of p65 processing intermediates but was linked to NleC being a metalloprotease. The metalloprotease premise was supported by multiple lines of evidence. First, the NFκB inhibitory activity of NleC was dramatically reduced by pretreating cells with metalloprotease inhibitors (EDTA or GM6001) unlike chemicals that interfere with caspase, calpain, or autophagosome-related proteases. Moreover, NleC carries a consensus zinc metalloprotease motif spanning residues 183–187 whose disruption had a similar affect as adding metalloprotease inhibitors. A minor inhibitory activity for metalloprotease-treated NleC and the NleC metalloprotease motif-disrupted variant probably relates to the recruitment of NFκB, directly or indirectly, interfering with its transcription activity. Indeed, p65 and p50 could only be isolated with full-length NleC when it lacked its protease function. Importantly, residues within the first 66 residues of NleC were shown to be sufficient and essential to recruit p65 and p50. Interestingly, the first 32 residues were dispensable for the inhibitory process thereby suggesting that features residing between residues 33–66, directly or indirectly, recruit canonical NFκB components. Further studies are necessary to define the residues and mechanism (direct or indirect) by which p65, p50 and IκBα are recruited to NleC for degradation. The requirement for residues 237–266 (upstream of the zinc metalloprotease motif) but not residues 267–330 in the inhibitory process presumably reflects an indirect deleterious consequence on a NleC protein structure needed for its protease activity. Collectively, the data is consistent with a model (see Fig. 7) whereby NleC, directly or indirectly, interacts with NFκB-IκBα complexes via features residing between residues 33 and 64 for degradation though its function as a zinc metalloprotease.Little is known about the role of NleC in the context of pathogenesis, as deleting the nleC gene does not impact on virulence, at least in interrogated strains and models (34Marchés O. Wiles S. Dziva F. La Ragione R.M. Schüller S. Best A. Phillips A.D. Hartland E.L. Woodward M.J. Stevens M.P. Frankel G.

Infect Immun. 2006; 74: 2328-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Studies using a disease-relevant small intestinal model suggest that NFκB cellular levels remain relatively unchanged following EPEC infections where NFκB function has been inhibited (25Ruchaud-Sparagano M.H. Maresca M. Kenny B. Cell Microbiol. 2007; 9: 1909-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Recent work suggests that such inhibition is due to the activity of the NleB and NleE effectors predicted to act at the level of IKK or the upstream kinase TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (19Newton H.J. Pearson J.S. Badea L. Kelly M. Lucas M. Holloway G. Wagstaff K.M. Dunstone M.A. Sloan J. Whisstock J.C. Kaper J.B. Robins-Browne R.M. Jans D.A. Frankel G. Phillips A.D. Coulson B.S. Hartland E.L.

PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1000743Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, these studies are consistent with contributions for other effectors, a premise illustrated by the documented role for NleH (21Gao X. Wan F. Mateo K. Callegari E. Wang D. Deng W. Puente J. Li F. Chaussee M.S. Finlay B.B. Lenardo M.J. Hardwidge P.R. PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000708Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Although EPEC can deliver plasmid-expressed NleC into host cells, an interrogated EPEC strain displayed little evidence of native nleC gene transcription or NleC production under the examined conditions (36Roe A.J. Tysall L. Dransfield T. Wang D. Fraser-Pitt D. Mahajan A. Constandinou C. Inglis N. Downing A. Talbot R. Smith D.G. Gally D.L. Microbiology. 2007; 153: 1350-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Preliminary studies support EPEC delivery of plasmid-expressed NleC in host cells where it decreases cellular levels of p65 and p50 (data not shown). Why EPEC have evolved mechanisms to limit the level of NleC within host cells and/or the ability of the effectors to degrade NFκB remains to be defined. Despite the apparent subtle role for NleC in inhibiting NFκB function within the context of an infection, the protein has a potent NFκB-specific degradation activity that may be useful for inhibiting the function of this transcriptional factor whose dysfunction is linked to inflammatory diseases and some cancers (10Sethi G. Sung B. Aggarwal B.B. Exp. Biol. Med. 2008; 233: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 11Kumar A. Takada Y. Boriek A.M. Aggarwal B.B. J. Mol. Med. 2004; 82: 434-448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the novel NFκB-specific protease property of NleC has interesting applications. Firstly, as proteins (such as the >120-kDa functionally active β-galactosidase) can be delivered into cells in culture and whole animal models (37Orange J.S. May M.J. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 3564-3591Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), NleC may be useful not only as a NFκB research tool but also in validating NFκB as a therapeutic target in disease samples or, indeed, as a therapeutic reagent. IntroductionInteraction of inflammatory stimuli, such as cytokines and microbial products, with their cognate receptors induces ubiquitination and phosphorylation cascades that alter the transcriptional profile of the cell to produce factors including antimicrobials, chemokines (e.g. IL-8), and cytokines (e.g. TNFα; see Refs. 1O'Dea E. Hoffmann A. Wiley Interdiscip Rev. Syst. Biol. Med. 2009; 1: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 2Vallabhapurapu S. Karin M. Annu. Rev.

Nguyen T.L. Arguello M. Nakhaei P. Paz S. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6844-6867Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). A critical player in this process is the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NFκB), 3The abbreviations used are: NFκBnuclear factor κBIκBinhibitor of NFκBIKKIκB kinaseeGFPenhanced GFPEPECenteropathogenic E. coli. which forms homo- or heterodimers composed of p65 (RelA), RelB, c-Rel, p50, and p52 proteins, with the p65/p50 dimer being the most abundant and associated with the canonical NFκB pathway. The p65/p50 dimer is retained within the cytoplasm bound to the inhibitor of κB (IκB) until receptor-mediated activation of the inhibitor of κB kinase (IKK) phosphorylates IκB, thereby triggering its proteasomal degradation to release NFκB for import into the nucleus. Signaling by many receptors converges at the IKK complex, composed of IKKα, IKKβ, and the NFκB essential modulator (IKKγ), but often involves distinct or overlapping upstream adaptors including TRAF and MyD88 and serine/threonine kinases such as IRAK, TGF-β-activated kinase 1, and RIP1 (1O'Dea E.

The classic mechanism to terminate NFκB transcriptional activity involves the NFκB-dependent transactivation of IκB, which shuttles the transcription factor back into the cytoplasm (5Chiao P.J.

Animals were pair-fed either a 6 or 24% casein-based diet for 7–10 days. At the end of the dietary period, a microarray analysis of the liver was performed, followed by validation of the genes of interest. The rates of appearance of phenylalanine, methionine, serine, and glucose and the contribution of pyruvate to serine and glucose were quantified using tracer methods. Plasma and tissue amino acid levels, enzyme activities, and metabolic intermediates were measured. Protein restriction resulted in significant differential expression of a number of genes involved in cell cycle, cell differentiation, transport, transcription, and metabolic processes. RT-PCR showed that the expression of genes involved in serine biosynthesis and fatty acid oxidation was higher, and those involved in fatty acid synthesis and urea synthesis were lower in the liver of protein-restricted animals. Free serine and glycine levels were higher and taurine levels lower in all tissues examined. Tracer isotope studies showed an ∼50% increase in serine de novo synthesis. Pyruvate was the primary (∼90%) source of serine in both groups. Transmethylation of methionine was significantly higher in the protein-restricted group. This was associated with a higher S-adenosylmethionine/S-adenosylhomocysteine ratio and lower cystathione β-synthase and cystathionine γ-lyase activity. Dietary isocaloric protein restriction results in profound changes in hepatic one-carbon metabolism within a short period. These may be related to high methylation demands placed on the organism and caused by possible changes in cellular osmolarity as a result of the efflux of the intracellular taurine. We have examined hepatic, genomic, and metabolic responses to dietary protein restriction in the non-pregnant Sprague-Dawley rat. Animals were pair-fed either a 6 or 24% casein-based diet for 7–10 days. At the end of the dietary period, a microarray analysis of the liver was performed, followed by validation of the genes of interest. The rates of appearance of phenylalanine, methionine, serine, and glucose and the contribution of pyruvate to serine and glucose were quantified using tracer methods. Plasma and tissue amino acid levels, enzyme activities, and metabolic intermediates were measured. Protein restriction resulted in significant differential expression of a number of genes involved in cell cycle, cell differentiation, transport, transcription, and metabolic processes. RT-PCR showed that the expression of genes involved in serine biosynthesis and fatty acid oxidation was higher, and those involved in fatty acid synthesis and urea synthesis were lower in the liver of protein-restricted animals.

These may be related to high methylation demands placed on the organism and caused by possible changes in cellular osmolarity as a result of the efflux of the intracellular taurine. The metabolic and biochemical impact of qualitative and quantitative changes in dietary protein intake continues to be of interest because of their implications for public health and because of a number of studies showing a strong relationship between protein intake during pregnancy with cardiovascular function, hypertension, and glucose intolerance in the offspring (1Bateson P.

Studies in humans, primarily focused on whole body protein, nitrogen metabolism, and protein accretion, show that both high and low protein intake can impact these processes (4Afolabi P.R. Jahoor F.

In the context of pregnancy, both high protein intake (in humans) and protein restriction in rodents have been shown to cause fetal metabolic programming and consequently altered physiological response in the offspring in adulthood (8Reynolds R.M.

In the rodent, dietary protein restriction during pregnancy results in growth retardation, impaired beta cell function and mass, impaired insulin sensitivity, hypertension, and other pathological responses in the offspring (1Bateson P. Barker D. Clutton-Brock T. Deb D. D'Udine B. Foley R.A. Gluckman P. Godfrey K. Kirkwood T. Lahr M.M. McNamara J. Metcalfe N.B. Monaghan P. Spencer H.G. Sultan S.E.

These have been associated with a change in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, changes in the renin-angiotensin system, and alterations in the concentration of the catecholamine and adrenoreceptors (reviewed in Ref. 2Warner M.J. Ozanne S.E. Biochem. J. 2010; 427: 333-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). These observations have been attributed to metabolic programming or imprinting, although the mechanism of such imprinting (of the fetus) has not been identified (1Bateson P. Barker D. Clutton-Brock T. Deb D. D'Udine B. Foley R.A. Gluckman P. Godfrey K. Kirkwood T. Lahr M.M. McNamara J. Metcalfe N.B. Monaghan P. Spencer H.G. Sultan S.E. Nature. 2004; 430: 419-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). The effect of total protein deprivation or total and specific amino acid starvation has been examined in isolated cell systems and in vivo (12Kilberg M.S. Pan Y.X. Chen H. Leung-Pineda V. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2005; 25: 59-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). These data may not be comparable with the in vivo physiological situation where such total deprivations are not observed. Other studies have examined the consequence of protein restriction or individual amino acid deprivation on specific biochemical pathways (13Courtney-Martin G. Rafii M. Wykes L.J. Ball R.O. Pencharz P.B. J. Nutr. 2008; 138: 2172-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 14Stipanuk M.H. Dominy Jr., J.E. Lee J.I. Coloso R.M. J. Nutr. 2006; 136: 1652S-1659SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, a comprehensive metabolic and biochemical evaluation of an organ system in vivo has not been done. Such studies are important to explore the specific biochemical cues that trigger a particular phenotype. In this study, we have examined the hepatic genomic and metabolic responses to dietary protein restriction for 7–10 days. Using the gene array approach, we identified the pathways of interest and have quantified the changes in the specific metabolic pathway by measuring the metabolic intermediates and the activity of enzymes involved and by quantifying the substrate flux using tracer isotopic methods. Our data show dietary protein restriction in the rat resulted in differential expression of genes involved in various cell cycle and metabolic processes and resulted in profound changes in methionine and serine metabolism. Non-pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from Zivic-Miller Laboratories Inc. (Zelienople, PA). All studies were conducted at the animal care facility of Case Western Reserve University, MetroHealth Medical Center, Cleveland, OH. The protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. American Association for the Accreditation of Laboratory Care Guidelines were followed for all the studies. The animal care facility was maintained under an ambient temperature (22 ± 1 °C) and light (on at 0600 h, off at 1800 h) conditions. After acclimatization for 3 days, the animals were placed on either protein-restricted (6%, LP) 2The abbreviations used are: LPlow proteinNPnormal proteinAdoMetS-adenosylmethionineAdoHcyS-adenosylhomocysteinePEPCKphosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase3PDGH3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase. or normal protein (24%, NP) diet for 7–10 days. The control group was pair-fed. The pair-feeding was performed by offering the amount of food taken by the experimental animal pair (LP) on the previous day to the NP pair. The source of protein was casein. The composition of the diet is displayed in supplemental Table 1 (24% protein (TD90017), 6% protein (TD90016); Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI). The carbohydrate content (nitrogen-free extract) in the LP diet was increased to make it isoenergetic. The amount of water and food ingested was measured daily. The animals were weighed every 3 days during the study. At the end of the study period, the animals were anesthetized using intraperitoneal pentobarbital (100 mg per kg body weight). All isotopic tracers studies and blood and tissue samples were obtained from fasted (12 h) animals. Blood and tissue samples were collected rapidly. Tissue samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The biological samples were stored at −80 °C for future analysis. low protein normal protein S-adenosylmethionine S-adenosylhomocysteine phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250–300 g with indwelling carotid artery and jugular vein catheters were obtained form Zivic-Miller Laboratories. The indwelling PE50 catheters were placed 3–4 days prior to transfer of the animals to our institution. The surgical procedures were performed under anesthesia and sterile conditions. The catheters were tunneled subcutaneously, and the distal end of each catheter was sutured to the dorsum of the neck. The catheters were filled with an anticoagulant solution, capped, and secured on the top of the neck. Postoperatively, the animals were given analgesic for pain (0.2 ml of Ketosen®, 10 mg/ml) and were placed on ad libitum rat chow and water. Following recovery from surgery (3–4 days), the animals were placed on the dietary regimens described above. Tracer studies were performed during fasting that started at 8 a.m. Food was removed at 6 p.m. the evening before the study; water was provided ad libitum. Isotopic tracers were administered as prime-constant rate infusion. The respective rate of infusion of the various tracers were as follows: [2H5]phenylalanine, 0.4 μmol·100 g−1·h−1; [13C,15N]serine, 1 μmol·100 g−1·h−1; [13C,2H3]methionine, 0.8 μmol·100 g−1·h−1; [1-14C]methionine, 0.4 μCi·100 g−1·h−1. The priming dose corresponding to ∼30 min of infusion (0.25 ml) was administered over 10–15 min. The sampling line (carotid artery) was kept patent by infusing isotonic saline at 0.5 ml/h. The animals were unrestrained, awake, and moved freely in the cage during the experiment. Blood samples (0.5 ml) were obtained in heparinized syringes at 240, 270, 300, and 330 min. Respiratory calorimetry measurements were done using an open canopy system as described previously (15Parimi P.S. Cripe-Mamie C. Kalhan S.C. Pediatr. Res. 2004; 56: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The specific activity of expired CO2 was measured as follows. The animal in the cage was placed under a canopy. The air in the canopy was suctioned using the wall suction. A part of the outflow stream was slowly bubbled through 2 ml of CO2 trapping solution (0.006 g of thymolphthaline, 100 g of absolute alcohol, 100 ml of 1 m methylbenzethonium hydroxide) until colorless, representing absorption of 1 mmol of CO2 (16Glamour T.S. McCullough A.J. Sauer P.J. Kalhan S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: E789-E796PubMed Google Scholar). Scintillation mixture (10 ml) was added to the colorless solution, and the radioactivity was measured on a beta counter. The rate of production of glucose was measured in a separate group of animals using [6,6-2H2]glucose tracer as described previously (17Kalhan S.C. Parimi P. Van Beek R. Gilfillan C. Saker F. Gruca L. Sauer P.J.J. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 281: E991-E997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gluconeogenesis from pyruvate was quantified by measuring the incorporation of 2H in C-6 of glucose following the 2H labeling of the total body water (18Landau B.R. Wahren J. Chandramouli V. Schumann W.C. Ekberg K. Kalhan S.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 172-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Similarly, the contribution of pyruvate to serine was measured by the incorporation of 2H of water in plasma serine. The isotopic enrichment of phenylalanine (m5), methionine (m4), serine (m2 and m3), and glycine (m2) in the plasma was measured following preparatory separation by ion exchange chromatography on a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer as described from our laboratory (19Dasarathy J. Gruca L.L. Bennett C. Parimi P.S. Duenas C. Marczewski S. Fierro J.L. Kalhan S.C. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2010; 91: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 20Kalhan S.C. Gruca L.L. Parimi P.S. O'Brien A. Dierker L. Burkett E. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 284: E733-E740Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).The 2H enrichment of C-6 of glucose was measured using the hexamethylene tetramine derivative method (21Kalhan S.C. Trivedi R. Singh S. Chandramouli V. Schumann W.C. Landau B.R. J. Mass Spectrom. 1995; 30: 1588-1592Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The specific activity of [1-14C]methionine in plasma was estimated as follows. The concentration of methionine in the plasma was measured by HPLC (15Parimi P.S. Cripe-Mamie C. Kalhan S.C. Pediatr. Res. 2004; 56: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). An aliquot of plasma was treated with perchloric acid to remove [14C]O2. The radioactivity in the supernatant was measured using a beta counter. It is assumed that all the radioactivity in the supernatant represents methionine. The contribution of other labeled products of methionine metabolism is likely to be small. Total RNA was extracted from the livers of five rats on the NP diet and four on the LP diet. The RNA was prepared according to the vendor's protocol (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). All samples were tested using the Rat Expression Array 230 version 2.0 whole genome oligonucleotide arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Signals were generated from the scanned image files using Affymetrix proprietary software, GeneChip Operating Software (GCOS), and Affymetrix standard operating procedures. Microarray Suite 5 (MAS 5) algorithms were used to convert gel files into spreadsheets of data. Array-wide data for individual samples were uniformly scaled to 500 and exported to MS Excel. Data were imported into BAMarray (Bayesian Analysis of Microarray data) software. Data were analyzed for significant changes in expression. There were 483 genes called significantly increased and a further 541 genes called decreased. BAM does not comment on magnitude of the fold changes, and so we cross-referenced the significantly changed genes with the ratio between group signal averages on a per gene basis. We set the cutoff ratio to +1.5 and −1.5 for the increases and decreases, respectively. This second screening gave us a set of 232 gene transcripts that were increased and 318 that were decreased (supplemental Tables 4, A and B) The list of increased and decreased gene transcripts were imported separately into PathwayStudio 6.2 (Ariadne, Rockville, MD) and screened for the enrichment of biological processes. In this step, PathwayStudio 6.2 compared the number of genes in a particular Gene Ontology category in its data base with the number of observed genes from the same category in the imported set of genes using Fisher's exact test and displayed the results with a p value to indicate whether the imported list was enriched with members from this category. In this way, we generated two lists of enriched biological groups as follows: one represented increases and the other represented decreases. These lists were subjected to three screening steps in the following sequence. 1) All biological processes with assigned p values greater than 0.05 were expunged from the list. 2) The remaining list of components was sorted in descending order on the number of gene identities in common between the Gene Ontology category in the imported gene list and that of the Pathway Studio data base list. All biological categories in which the common genes numbered only 1 were excluded. 3) The remaining biological processes were screened subjectively. Groups that were perceived as pertinent to the study were kept; others from many and diverse areas of biology were removed. Quantification of RNA was done using real time PCR using the protocol described (22Dasarathy S. Muc S. Hisamuddin K. Edmison J.M. Dodig M. McCullough A.J. Kalhan S.C. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2007; 292: G1105-G1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Rat tissue samples were homogenized using a Brinkmann tissue homogenizer, and RNA was extracted using 5 ml of TRI Reagent as per the manufacturer's protocol. Debris was removed by centrifugation, and RNA was collected and resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. The concentration of RNA was estimated by measuring absorption at 260 and 280 nm. Quality verification of the RNA sample was performed by separating 10 μg of total RNA on a 1.25% formaldehyde agarose gel. BD Clontech kit protocol was followed to synthesize first strand cDNA from 1 μg of total RNA. Oligonucleotide primers used for the various genes are shown in supplemental Table 2 (primer list). Real time PCR was performed using protocols previously described (22Dasarathy S. Muc S. Hisamuddin K. Edmison J.M. Dodig M. McCullough A.J. Kalhan S.C. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2007; 292: G1105-G1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Real time PCR for quantification of mRNA was performed on a Stratagene Mx3000P (Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA) using a SYBR® protocol on the fluorescence temperature cycler. Results were expressed as fold change in expression of each gene in the low protein diet-fed rats compared with the control normal protein diet-fed animals using a relative quantification method (23Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25424) Google Scholar). The relative expression of the gene of interest in the LP diet rats was quantified compared with its expression in the NP diet-fed controls. All real time PCR products were then separated on a 1.5% Tris/acetic acid-agarose electrophoresis to confirm product presence and size. Amino acid concentration in the plasma and tissues were measured following pre-column o-phthaldehyde derivatization and using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorometric detection (20Kalhan S.C. Gruca L.L. Parimi P.S. O'Brien A. Dierker L. Burkett E. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 284: E733-E740Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Rat tissues (liver, skeletal muscle, and kidney) were homogenized in 3% sulfosalicylic acid (1:4 dilution). The homogenate was centrifuged and the supernatant used for analysis. AdoMet and AdoHcy concentrations were measured as described by Merali et al. (24Merali S. Vargas D. Franklin M. Clarkson Jr., A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14958-14963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Plasma concentrations of cysteine, homocysteine, and glutathione were measured as described by Garcia and Apitz-Castro (25Garcia A.J. Apitz-Castro R. J. Chromatogr. B. 2002; 779: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cystathionine γ-lyase activity in the liver homogenate, 25 μl, was measured as described by Stipanuk (26Stipanuk M.H. J. Nutr. 1979; 109: 2126-2139Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 ml of the reaction mixture contained 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 4.0 mm l-cystathionine, 0.125 mm pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, 0.32 mm NADH, 1.5 units of lactate dehydrogenase. The rate of production of pyruvate was measured by the decrease in the absorbance at 340 min using a spectrophotometer. Maximal velocity was calculated from the linear portion of the reaction. Glycine N-methyltransferase activity was measured as described by Rowling et al. (27Rowling M.J. McMullen M.H. Chipman D.C. Schalinske K.L. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 2545-2550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glycine N-methyltransferase activity assay was initiated by the addition of 250 μg of protein from the liver homogenate to a reaction mixture containing 200 mm Tris, pH 9.0, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm glycine, and 0.2 mm S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine and incubated at 37 °C for 30 and 60 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 μl of 10% TCA to the reaction mixture. Unreacted AdoMet was removed by the addition of activated charcoal, and an aliquot of the subsequent supernatant was removed for scintillation counting. The assay was linear with respect to time and protein concentration. The activity was expressed as nanomoles of sarcosine formed per mg protein per min. Methionine synthase activity in liver homogenate was measured by the formation of methionine in the presence of homocysteine and [6-14C]methyl tetrahydrofolate (28Frasca V. Banerjee R.V. Dunham W.R. Sands R.H. Matthews R.G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8458-8465Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). 100 μl of tissue homogenate was incubated with 100 μl of reaction mixture. The concentration of the reagents were 14.5 mm homocysteine, 2.5 mm S-adenosyl-l-methionine, 0.05 mm cyanocobalamin, 15 mm dithiothreitol in 85 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. The methionine produced was separated by ion exchange chromatography and radioactivity counted in a Packard scintillation counter. Cystathionine γ-lyase activity was also measured, as described by Heinonen (29Heinonen K. Biochem. J. 1973; 136: 1011-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), by quantifying the rate of production of cysteine from cystathionine in the presence of pyridoxal phosphate. The amount of cysteine in the reaction mixture was measured by HPLC (25Garcia A.J. Apitz-Castro R. J. Chromatogr. B. 2002; 779: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cystathionine β-synthase activity was measured using the method of Mudd et al. (30Mudd S.H. Finkelstein J.D. Irreverre F. Laster L. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 4382-4392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of synthesis of [14C]cystathionine from [14C]serine and -homocysteine was quantified in the presence of pyridoxal phosphate. Phosphoenolpyruvate mRNA and protein were measured as described previously (31Parimi P.S. Croniger C.M. Leahy P. Hanson R.W. Kalhan S.C. Pediatr. Res. 2003; 53: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity in the liver of the rats was measured by the method Ballard and Hanson (32Ballard F.J. Hanson R.W. Biochem. J. 1967; 102: 952-958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of appearance of each amino acid was calculated using tracer dilution method during isotopic steady state as shown in Equation 1, Ra=((100/Ep)−1)×Iμ mol⋅100 g−1⋅h−1(eq.1) where Ra = rate of appearance (μmol·100 g−1·h−1); Ep is the enrichment of respective tracer in the plasma, and I is the rate of infusion of isotopic tracer. The contribution of [1-14C]methionine to expired CO2, a measure of the rate of trans-sulfuration of methionine, was calculated from the specific activity of expired CO2 and plasma methionine-specific activity using the precursor-product relationship (33Kalhan S.C. Rossi K.Q. Gruca L.L. Super D.M. Savin S.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E423-E431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The contribution of pyruvate to glucose (gluconeogenesis) and to serine was calculated from their respective tracer enrichments and the precursor-product relationship. Because there were three labeled hydrogens on the serine molecule, the enrichment of serine was divided by 3. All data are reported as means ± S.E. Student's t test was used to examine statistically significant (p < 0.05) differences among the groups. Dietary protein restriction caused differential regulation of a number of genes involved in several biological processes in the liver. Some of these processes and the respective number of genes that were significantly changed by dietary intervention are displayed in FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2. As shown, significant down-regulation was observed among genes involved in cell cycling, differentiation, and apoptosis, and significant up-regulation was observed among those involved in the response to oxidative stress and cellular redox homeostasis. Some genes of particular interest involved in specific metabolic processes are listed in supplemental Table 3, A and B.FIGURE 2Biological processes with significantly up-regulated genes (numbers) in the liver of the protein-restricted animals.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As anticipated, the regulation of metabolic processes involved both up-regulated and down-regulated genes. The expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation was increased, and those involved in fatty acid synthesis were decreased. In addition, the expression of genes for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphogluconate dehydrogenase was markedly lower in response to dietary protein restriction. Among the genes involved in amino acid metabolism, a significant increase was observed for those involved in serine biosynthesis via the phosphorylated intermediate pathway (3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, phosphoserine aminotransferase). Also of interest was the increased expression of histidine decarboxylase, cysteinesulfinic acid decarboxylase, and asparagine synthetase. We confirmed by RT-PCR the changes in expression of the genes of interest in hepatic metabolism of serine, urea, and fatty acids. As shown in Fig. 3, in protein-restricted animals, there was an increase in the mRNA for 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.95), phosphoserine aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.52), cysteinesulfinic acid decarboxylase (EC 4.1.129), and glutamate-cysteine ligase (EC 6.3.2.2). In contrast, the genes for the enzymes involved in urea synthesis, aspartate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.1), argininosuccinate lyase (EC 4.3.2.1), and argininosuccinate synthase (EC 6.3.4.5) were repressed. The changes in genes involved in fatty acid synthesis (fatty-acid synthase (EC 2.3.1.85) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (EC 1.14.19.1)) were down-regulated, although the genes for those involved in fatty acid oxidation (carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase 2 (EC 2.3.1.21), acyl-CoA oxidase (EC 1.3.3.6), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α) were up-regulated, suggesting higher expression of enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation in protein-restricted animals. Finally, CYP4A1 was down-regulated in the LP group. The hepatic gene array data suggest an attempt at nitrogen conservation (lower urea synthesis), higher serine biosynthesis, lower fatty acid synthesis, and higher fatty acid oxidation, probably related to high energy demands in the liver. The total amino nitrogen concentration in the plasma was higher in the protein-restricted group (LP, 4.93 ± 55.9; NP, 3.93 ± 43.9 mm·liter−1, mean ± S.E.); however, the difference was not statistically significant. As shown in Fig. 4, the plasma concentration of several amino acids was changed as a result of dietary protein restriction; most notable were serine and glycine, which were markedly higher in the LP group (serine, LP 526.9 ± 45.9; NP 224.8 ± 33.5 μmol/liter, p = 0.001; glycine, LP 568.5 ± 60.9; NP 291.8 ± 7.57 μmol/liter, p = 0.007). In addition, plasma concentrations of citrulline and ornithine were also higher in the LP group (p = 0.06). The plasma concentration of taurine was not different among the two groups.

Homo- and hetero-oligomeric proteolytic complexes exist, which are composed of homologous subunits harboring an ATPase domain of the AAA family and an H41 metallopeptidase domain. Mutations in subunits of mitochondrial m-AAA proteases have been associated with different neurodegenerative disorders in human, raising questions on the functional differences between homo- and hetero-oligomeric AAA proteases. Here, we have analyzed the hetero-oligomeric yeast m-AAA protease composed of homologous Yta10 and Yta12 subunits. We combined genetic and structural approaches to define the molecular determinants for oligomer assembly and to assess functional similarities between Yta10 and Yta12. We demonstrate that replacement of only two amino acid residues within the metallopeptidase domain of Yta12 allows its assembly into homo-oligomeric complexes. To provide a molecular explanation, we determined the 12 Å resolution structure of the intact yeast m-AAA protease with its transmembrane domains by electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) and atomic structure fitting. The full-length m-AAA protease has a bipartite structure and is a hexamer in solution. We found that residues in Yta12, which facilitate homo-oligomerization when mutated, are located at the interface between neighboring protomers in the hexamer ring. Notably, the transmembrane and intermembrane space domains are separated from the main body, creating a passage on the matrix side, which is wide enough to accommodate unfolded but not folded polypeptides. These results suggest a mechanism regarding how proteins are recognized and degraded by m-AAA proteases."

Whereas the mechanisms leading to the production of ROS are rather well delineated, the mechanisms underlying tissue susceptibility or tolerance to oxidant stress remain elusive. Through an experimental selection over many generations, we have previously generated Drosophila melanogaster flies that tolerate tremendous oxidant stress and have shown that the family of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) is over-represented in these tolerant flies. Furthermore, we have also demonstrated that overexpression of even one AMP at a time (e.g. Diptericin) allows wild-type flies to survive much better in hyperoxia. In this study, we used a number of experimental approaches to investigate the potential mechanisms underlying hyperoxia tolerance in flies with AMP overexpression. We demonstrate that flies with Diptericin overexpression resist oxidative stress by increasing antioxidant enzyme activities and preventing an increase in ROS levels after hyperoxia. Depleting the GSH pool using buthionine sulfoximine limits fly survival, thus confirming that enhanced survival observed in these flies is related to improved redox homeostasis. We conclude that 1) AMPs play an important role in tolerance to oxidant stress, 2) overexpression of Diptericin changes the cellular redox balance between oxidant and antioxidant, and 3) this change in redox balance plays an important role in survival in hyperoxia.

In the past, through an experimental selection design over many generations, we have successfully generated D. melanogaster flies that tolerate tremendously high O2-induced oxidative stress. Microarray analysis has revealed that the family of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) is over-represented among the up-regulated genes in these tolerant flies. We have further demonstrated that overexpression of even one AMP gene at a time (e.g. Diptericin (Dpt)) allows wild-type flies to survive much better in hyperoxia (15Zhao H.W. Zhou D. Nizet V. Haddad G.G. PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e11701Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that Dpt has a protective role against oxidative stress. In this study, we used a number of experimental approaches to investigate the potential mechanisms of hyperoxia tolerance and to understand how Dpt overexpression protects flies from oxidative injury. We demonstrate that flies with Dpt overexpression resist oxidative stress by increasing antioxidant enzyme activities, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and GST, and by preventing an increase in ROS level under hyperoxia. By feeding buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), a chemical that depletes the GSH pool and inhibits antioxidant enzyme activities, we further confirm that enhanced survival observed in these flies is related to improved redox homeostasis. da-Gal4 was obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center. UAS-AMP flies (w; imd, UAS-AMP; spzrm7, UAS-AMP/TM6C) were generously provided by Dr. Bruno Lemaitre (Global Health Institute, Lausanne, Switzerland). All stocks were maintained on standard cornmeal-agar medium. Experimental chambers (26 × 16 × 16 cm) were specially designed and supplied with 90% O2 balanced with N2. Humidity was maintained by passing the gas through water prior to entry into the chambers. The flow speed was monitored with a 565 glass tube flow meter (Concoa, Virginia Beach, VA), and the O2 level within the chamber was periodically tested with a Diamond General 733 Clark-style electrode (Diamond General Development Corp., Ann Arbor, MI). Embryos were cultured in normoxia for 48 h and then transferred to the 90% O2 chamber. After ∼3 weeks in culture, the percent eclosion (adult emergence) was determined by calculating the ratio of the number of empty pupae to the number of total pupae in each culture vial. Experiments were repeated at least three times for each line. The 3–5-day-old adult flies were exposed to 90% O2, and the survival rate was scored every day. At least 200 flies in each group were used. Total RNA was extracted as described previously (15Zhao H.W. Zhou D. Nizet V. Haddad G.G. PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e11701Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Affymetrix Drosophila Genome 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) were used, and probe labeling, array hybridization, and image scanning were performed following the standard protocol according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting data files from the Affymetrix scanner were background-subtracted and normalized using Robust Multi-array Average software. All comparisons of mRNA expression levels between the groups were performed using VAMPIRE (variance-modeled posterior inference with regional exponentials). Genes were identified as differentially expressed if they showed a fold-change of at least 1.5 with a p value < 0.05. The list of differently expressed genes was subjected to a subsequent post-analysis task such as MAPPFinder2 and STRING 8.3 software to find the main biologic processes associated with the experimental system and potential network interactions among genes. The data of the microarray have been deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus and are accessible through GEO series accession number GSE23902. Total RNA was treated with DNase I (Ambion, Austin, TX). cDNA synthesis from 1 μg of total RNA was performed using the SuperScript first-strand synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). Real-time RT-PCR was performed using the ABI Prism 7900 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) following a standard protocol recommended by the manufacturers. Primers used in this study were shown in supplemental Table S2. Relative gene expression was calculated after normalization to β-actin 5C. Adult flies were homogenized, and protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. The level of ROS was determined using 5(6)-chloromethyl-2′, 7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate acetyl ester (Invitrogen) as described previously (16Liu L. Zhang X. Qian B. Min X. Gao X. Li C. Cheng Y. Huang J. Eur. J. Heart Fail. 2007; 9: 762-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 17Neretti N. Wang P.Y. Brodsky A.S. Nyguyen H.H. White K.P. Rogina B. Helfand S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 2277-2282Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In brief, 5 μm 5(6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate acetyl ester (in dimethyl sulfoxide) was incubated with 100 μl of total fly homogenate, and fluorescence was measured using a microplate reader at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 535 nm. All assays were repeated at least three times. SOD, catalase, and GST activities were determined using an SOD determination kit (Sigma), Amplex Red catalase assay kit (Invitrogen), and GST assay kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI), respectively, following standard protocols as recommended by the manufacturers. GSH and GSSG were measured using a glutathione assay kit (Cayman Chemical) following a protocol provided by the manufacturer. All assays were repeated at least three times. BSO was obtained from Sigma. Administration of BSO was performed as described previously (18Abraham S.K. Singh S.P. Kesavan P.C. Mutat. Res. 1993; 301: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. In brief, BSO (1 and 6 mm) solutions were prepared immediately prior to use. Dry food powder (Carolina Biological Supply Co.) was mixed at 23.5 g/100 ml of H2O (control food) or with BSO solution (experimental food), respectively. Second-instar larvae were collected and randomly separated into control vials or experimental vials and then transferred to the 90% O2 chamber. The eclosion rate was determined after 3 weeks by averaging six individual vials per group. The 3–5-day-old adult flies were fed 6 mm BSO for 72 h and then transferred to the 90% O2 chamber; survival rate was determined as described above. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to compare life span between groups; all other data were analyzed using Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance and graphed using GraphPad Prism 4.02 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). Results are expressed as the group mean ± S.E. Differences in means were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05, unless stated otherwise. Through experimental selection over many generations, our laboratory has previously successfully generated a Drosophila strain that can tolerate extremely high oxygen environments (i.e. 90% O2). We have also shown that this level of hyperoxia is lethal to naive nonexposed flies. Microarray analysis has shown us additionally that the AMP family of genes (e.g. Dpt) is significantly up-regulated in these flies and that this up-regulation is not due to the presence of microbes (15Zhao H.W. Zhou D. Nizet V. Haddad G.G. PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e11701Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Here, using a UAS/Gal4 system, we overexpressed Dpt by crossing da-Gal4 with UAS-Dpt flies and then exposed the progeny to hyperoxia with 90% O2. The percent eclosion rate was determined after 3 weeks in the hyperoxia chamber. As shown in Fig. 1A, we found that ∼50% of the pupae of the da-Gal4 × UAS-Dpt progeny (da-Gal4>UAS-Dpt) were able to eclose in 90% O2, which was significantly higher than the da-Gal4 (no survival) and UAS-Dpt (26%, p < 0.05) control flies, suggesting that overexpression of Dpt plays a critical role in the survival of hyperoxia. Furthermore, our previous data have shown that flies with decreased Dpt expression using RNA interference cannot eclose in 90% O2 compared with an eclosion rate of ∼10% in control flies (15Zhao H.W. Zhou D. Nizet V. Haddad G.G. PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e11701Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), again supporting the idea that overexpression of Dpt contributes to the survival in hyperoxia. The life span of adult flies in hyperoxia was also determined. The da-Gal4>UAS-Dpt flies had an increase of ∼25% in median and maximal life span over UAS-Dpt and da-Gal4 control flies (p < 0.01) (Fig. 1B). To investigate the potential mechanisms of enhanced survival in hyperoxia observed in the da-Gal4>UAS-Dpt flies, we used Affymetrix microarrays to compare the gene expression profiles between da-Gal4>UAS-Dpt and UAS-Dpt flies, with the da-Gal4 flies included as an additional control in other assays. Remarkably, we identified 794 genes that were significantly altered in da-Gal4>UAS-Dpt flies, of which 235 genes were up-regulated and 559 genes were down-regulated (Fig. 2A and supplemental Table S1). Using MAPPFinder in conjunction with GenMAPP, we found that genes with several biological processes, including peroxidase activity, α-glycosidase activity, scavenger receptor activity, and MAPK scaffold activity, were significantly altered in flies with Dpt overexpression compared with the UAS-Dpt flies alone. The biological process-based categorization of significantly altered genes is summarized in Fig. 2B. To determine which gene changes played a crucial role in hyperoxia tolerance and might contribute to survival in 90% O2, we focused on all genes that were associated with significantly altered biological processes and investigated their potential network connections to Dpt using the STRING Database. The STRING Database, which contains known and predicted physical and functional protein-protein interactions (19Jensen L.J. Kuhn M. Stark M. Chaffron S. Creevey C. Muller J. Doerks T. Julien P. Roth A. Simonovic M. Bork P. von Mering C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D412-D416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1919) Google Scholar), predicted that Dpt has interactions with several other genes, including relish (rel), PGRP-LC, hemipterous (hep), basket (bsk), sunday driver (syd), spire (spir), tamou (pyd), glutathione S-transferase D3 (GstD3), GstE1, and GstE5 (Fig. 2C). Alterations of gene expression in this network was validated using real-time PCR; the results were consistent with those determined by the microarrays (Fig. 2D). In this network, Gst genes were particularly interesting because GSTs are a superfamily of multifunctional enzymes that have been implicated in a range of physiological roles such as signal transduction, cell differentiation, and apoptosis (20Ketterer B. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2001; 138: 27-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), as well as in the detoxification of various hydrophobic endogenous and xenobiotic compounds (21Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 445-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (3254) Google Scholar). Under conditions of oxidative stress, GSTs have glutathione peroxidase activity and protect against electrophiles and oxidative stress by altering cellular glutathione levels (21Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 445-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (3254) Google Scholar). Because of a lack of functional glutathione peroxidase enzymes in Drosophila, flies rely instead on the activity of the more general detoxification enzymes, GSTs, to carry out a peroxidase function (22Parkes T.L. Hilliker A.J. Phillips J.P. Genome. 1993; 36: 1007-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 23Sohal R.S. Arnold L. Orr W.C. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1990; 56: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The up-regulation of genes encoding these antioxidant enzymes (i.e. GstD3 and GstE1, as well as thioredoxin, CG15116, and peroxiredoxin 2540) observed in our microarray analysis led us to hypothesize that flies with Dpt overexpression might have higher antioxidant activity and are better able to maintain redox homeostasis under hyperoxia. To test this hypothesis, we measured the enzyme activities of GST, as well as SOD and catalase. As shown in Fig. 3A, flies with Dpt overexpression had a significantly higher SOD activity than da-Gal4 control flies (p < 0.05) but a similar activity as UAS-Dpt flies. The catalase and GST activity levels were significantly increased in the da-Gal4>UAS-Dpt flies compared with those in the da-Gal4 and UAS-Dpt controls (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3, B and C), indicating that higher antioxidant activities observed in flies with Dpt overexpression may potentially contribute to the enhanced survival in hyperoxia. Hyperoxia treatment causes an increase in the mitochondrial ROS generation rate (24Turrens J.F. Freeman B.A. Crapo J.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 217: 411-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 25Turrens J.F. Freeman B.A. Levitt J.G. Crapo J.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 217: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) and accelerates the accrual of macromolecular oxidative damage to tissues (26Sohal R.S. Dubey A. Free. Radic. Biol. Med. 1994; 16: 621-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 27Agarwal S. Sohal R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 12332-12335Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). An enhanced ROS level in vivo causes oxidation of GSH into GSSG by direct interaction with ROS or by being a substrate for the enzymatic elimination of peroxides (28Schafer F.Q. Buettner G.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1191-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (3655) Google Scholar, 29Reed D.J. Pascoe G.A. Thomas C.E. Environ.

Therefore, a glutathione redox state, represented by the GSH:GSSG ratio, is widely used as a surrogate for determining the direction of the shift in the level of oxidative stress in tissues (28Schafer F.Q. Buettner G.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1191-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (3655) Google Scholar, 31de la Asuncion J.G. Millan A. Pla R. Bruseghini L. Esteras A. Pallardo F.V. Sastre J. Viña J.

Although it is not clear how flies with Dpt overexpression increase Gst gene expression and enzyme activities, our data led us to hypothesize that hyperoxia might not induce ROS accumulation or have less of an effect on redox homeostasis in these Dpt overexpression flies compared with controls. Thus, we determined the level of ROS and the GSH:GSSG ratio in these flies in normoxia and hyperoxia, respectively. Three days of hyperoxia treatment were chosen because 1) hyperoxia-induced oxidative damage such as increased protein carbonyl content and alteration of GSH and GSSG can be clearly observed in flies after 2.5 or 3 days in 100% O2 (33Mockett R.J. Sohal R.S. Orr W.C. FASEB. J. 1999; 13: 1733-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 34Rebrin I. Sohal R.S. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2006; 127: 869-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and 2) after 3 days of hyperoxia, flies start to die rapidly. The level of ROS was measured using 5(6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate acetyl ester, a fluorescence indicator that measures ROS, including hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical, peroxyl radical, and peroxynitrite anion (35Jakubowski W. Bartosz G. Cell Biol. Int. 2000; 24: 757-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Our data show that the level of ROS was significantly increased in UAS-Dpt flies after hyperoxia (p < 0.01) (Fig. 4A), and a trend toward an increase in the level of ROS was also observed in da-Gal4 flies. However, an increased ROS level was not observed in da-Gal4>UAS-Dpt flies (p > 0.05) (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, the concentrations of GSH and GSSG were determined in whole-body homogenates. In normoxia, the GSH:GSSG ratio was similar among groups (p > 0.05) (Fig. 4B). However, the GSH:GSSG ratio was significantly decreased in the UAS-Dpt and da-Gal4 flies following hyperoxia treatment (p < 0.05) (Fig. 4B), but no significant difference was observed in the da-Gal4>UAS-Dpt flies before or after hyperoxia (p > 0.05) (Fig. 4B). These data demonstrate that the glutathione redox homeostasis is maintained more efficiently in the flies with Dpt overexpression. To further confirm whether the well maintained redox homeostasis plays an important role in hyperoxia survival, we fed flies with BSO to alter cellular glutathione levels and examined their survival in hyperoxia. BSO is a specific γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase inhibitor that blocks the rate-limiting step of GSH biosynthesis and depletes the intracellular GSH pool in both cultured cells and whole animals (18Abraham S.K. Singh S.P. Kesavan P.C. Mutat. Res. 1993; 301: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 36Anderson C.P. Tsai J.M. Meek W.E. Liu R.M. Tang Y. Forman H.J. Reynolds C.P. Exp.

Physiol. 2007; 103: 1921-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We consistently observed that 6 mm BSO significantly reduced the GSH level and the GSH:GSSG ratio by 90 and 60%, respectively, compared with the control level (p < 0.001) (Fig. 5A). In addition, administration of BSO has been shown to decrease the activities of SOD, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase (38Thanislass J. Raveendran M. Devaraj H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and to increase ROS formation and trigger apoptosis (39Marengo B. De Ciucis C. Verzola D. Pistoia V. Raffaghello L. Patriarca S. Balbis E. Traverso N. Cottalasso D. Pronzato M.A. Marinari U.M. Domenicotti C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2008; 44: 474-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Here, after 6 mm BSO treatment, we found that 65% of pupae from da-Gal4>UAS-Dpt vials were able to eclose in 90% O2 in contrast to 46 and 35% of those fed 1 mm BSO (p = 0.07) and 6 mm BSO (p < 0.05), respectively (Fig. 5B). The life span was also significantly decreased in adult flies after feeding 6 mm BSO (p < 0.01) (Fig. 5C). In this study, we demonstrated that flies with Dpt overexpression resist hyperoxia-induced oxidative stress by increasing antioxidant enzyme activities and preventing an increase in ROS levels following hyperoxia treatment. We have further confirmed that enhanced survival observed in these flies is related to redox homeostasis with the use of BSO, a chemical that depletes the GSH pool and inhibits antioxidant enzyme activities. It is commonly accepted that microbial infections induce a rapid and transient synthesis of AMPs in Drosophila and that overexpression of a single AMP restores wild-type resistance to infection in immunodeficient Drosophila mutants (40Tzou P. Reichhart J.M. Lemaitre B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 2152-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In this study, we report that flies with Dpt overexpression survive much better than control flies, as evidenced by a significantly higher eclosion rate and longer life span in 90% O2. These results were interesting but not surprising because many recent studies have demonstrated that, besides their antimicrobial function, AMPs have multiple roles, including inflammation, proliferation, wound healing, chemotaxis, and antiapoptosis (41Bals R.

For instance, cecropin A and B, other AMP genes in Drosophila, have been shown 1) to significantly inhibit tumor cell proliferation and DNA synthesis while sparing benign fibroblast cells (46Suttmann H.

Life Sci. 2005; 62: 784-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) also proposed that AMPs, which are positively charged molecules, may “recognize” negatively charged targets such as cancer cells and bacteria. Therefore, we can raise the possibility here that cationic AMPs such as Dpt may trap or “scavenge” free radical anions and attenuate oxygen toxicity because of their surface charge (49Wartha F. Beiter K. Normark S. Henriques-Normark B. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2007; 10: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 50Wartha F. Henriques-Normark B. Sci. Signal. 2008; 1: pe25Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In addition, PR-39, a cathelicidin with antimicrobial properties, attenuates the apoptotic response of apoptosis-inducing drugs such as etoposide, bleomycin, tert-butylhydroperoxide, and 2-deoxy-d-ribose (51Ross C.R. Ricevuti G. Scovassi A.I. Chem. Biol. Drug Des. 2007; 70: 154-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), suggesting that AMPs might act by limiting cell death and promoting cell survival under certain pathological conditions. Through a microarray analysis, we have shown that many genes were significantly altered in the flies with Dpt overexpression compared with the control flies. The STRING Database analysis revealed that Gst genes were potentially linked to Dpt through several other genes or pathways. The gene changes within this network were consistent with data published previously (52Park J.M. Brady H. Ruocco M.G. Sun H. Williams D. Lee S.J. Kato Jr., T. Richards N. Chan K. Mercurio F. Karin M. Wasserman S.A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 584-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 53Udomsinprasert R. Bogoyevitch M.A. Ketterman A.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 383: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For instance, relish activation has been linked to proteasomal degradation of TAK1, which leads to rapid termination of JNK signaling (52Park J.M. Brady H. Ruocco M.G. Sun H. Williams D. Lee S.J. Kato Jr., T. Richards N. Chan K. Mercurio F. Karin M. Wasserman S.A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 584-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). hep and bsk have been shown to reciprocally inhibit GstD3 activity by 50–80% in vitro (53Udomsinprasert R. Bogoyevitch M.A. Ketterman A.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 383: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Consistent with this scenario, we observed decreased JNK signaling and increased GST activity in the flies with Dpt overexpression and confirmed these changes by real-time PCR and enzyme activity assays, respectively. GST has been shown to play a role in antioxidant defense and has glutathione reductase activity in Drosophila (20Ketterer B. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2001; 138: 27-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 22Parkes T.L. Hilliker A.J. Phillips J.P. Genome. 1993; 36: 1007-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 54Sawicki R. Singh S.P. Mondal A.K. Benes H. Zimniak P. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In particular, GstD3, which was up-regulated in the flies with Dpt overexpression, has also been shown to respond to dietary H2O2, and both GstD3 and GstE1 can metabolize 4-hydroxynonenal, a highly toxic aldehyde produced by lipid peroxidation in cells in response to oxidative stress (54Sawicki R.

Overexpression of classical antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione reductase, manganous SOD, catalase, and GST have been shown to increase the resistance to hyperoxia-induced oxidative stress (33Mockett R.J.

As shown in this study, we have provided evidence that up-regulated antioxidant enzyme activities indeed contribute to the survival under oxidative stress. Interestingly, we noticed that UAS-Dpt flies have a slightly higher SOD and GST activity but a lower catalase activity than da-Gal4 flies; thus, we speculated that the difference in antioxidant enzyme activities between da-Gal4 and UAS-Dpt might explain the difference in hyperoxia survival. Previous studies have shown that hyperoxia induces excessive ROS production, an increase in protein carbonyl accumulation and lipid peroxidation, a decrease in antioxidant enzyme activities, and a disruption of glutathione redox homeostasis (10Gruenewald C.

Santos Valenca S. Exp. Lung Res. 2009; 35: 713-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For instance, Nagato et al. (63Nagato A. Silva F.L. Silva A.R. Bezerra F.S. Oliveira M.L. Belló-Klein A. Cristovao Porto L. Santos Valenca S. Exp. Lung Res. 2009; 35: 713-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) found that hyperoxia (100% O2 for 90 min) induced a decrease in antioxidant enzyme activities, including catalase, SOD, and glutathione peroxidase; a decrease in GSH; an increase in GSSG; and a decrease in the GSH:GSSG ratio in Wistar rats. Here, we have observed that hyperoxia induced an increase in ROS levels and a decrease in the GSH:GSSG ratio in UAS-Dpt flies but not in flies with Dpt overexpression, indicating that Dpt directly or indirectly (through its effect on gene expression) plays an important role in survival in hyperoxia. BSO induces oxidative stress by irreversibly inhibiting γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, an essential enzyme for the synthesis of glutathione, and causing a rapid loss of intercellular GSH (64Reliene R. Schiestl R.H. Carcinogenesis. 2006; 27: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Administration of BSO has been shown 1) to reduce the level of GSH and GST by 20 or 50% in Drosophila after feeding with 1 or 6 mm BSO, respectively, compared with the corresponding controls (18Abraham S.K. Singh S.P. Kesavan P.C. Mutat. Res. 1993; 301: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and 2) to decrease the activities of SOD, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase (38Thanislass J. Raveendran M. Devaraj H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and to increase the sensitivity to γ-radiation and hyperoxia-induced oxidative stress (18Abraham S.K. Singh S.P. Kesavan P.C. Mutat. Res. 1993; 301: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 65Taglialatela G. Perez-Polo J.R. Rassin D.K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 936-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The idea behind the use of BSO is that if redox homoeostasis in da-Gal4>UAS-Dpt flies played a critical role in the survival to hyperoxia, depletion of the glutathione level and a decrease in antioxidant defense by BSO would decrease their survival in hyperoxia. A significantly decreased eclosion rate and life span were observed in flies after feeding 6 mm BSO, suggesting that balanced antioxidant defense is a key factor in determining survival under hyperoxia. Although we have shown that 6 mm BSO reduced the GSH level by 90% and the GSH:GSSG ratio by 60%, the survival of da-Gal4>UAS-Dpt flies in hyperoxia was not abolished, suggesting that additional mechanisms must contribute to the survival in hyperoxia. Although we have demonstrated that maintained redox homeostasis is critical in hyperoxia tolerance, we do not exclude other possible mechanisms that may contribute to the survival in the flies with Dpt overexpression. For instance, several JNK pathway-related genes such as hep and bsk were significantly altered in these flies. Decreased JNK signaling has been shown to attenuate hyperoxia-induced oxidative injury. For example, by suppressing JNK signal pathways, neuropeptide substance P can promote type II alveolar epithelial cell proliferation, inhibit apoptosis after hyperoxia exposure, and attenuate hyperoxia-induced oxidative stress damage (66Huang B. Fu H. Yang M. Fang F. Kuang F. Xu F. Lung. 2009; 187: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Carnesecchi et al. (67Carnesecchi S. Deffert C. Pagano A. Garrido-Urbani S. Métrailler-Ruchonnet I. Schäppi M. Donati Y. Matthay M.A. Krause K.H. Barazzone Argiroffo C. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2009; 180: 972-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) reported that hyperoxia led to phosphorylation of JNK and ERK, two MAPKs involved in cell death signaling. In contrast, hyperoxia-induced lung injury was significantly prevented in NOX1-deficient mice, in which JNK phosphorylation was blunted and ERK phosphorylation was decreased. In summary, we have shown that flies with Dpt overexpression had a significantly higher eclosion rate in hyperoxia compared with control flies. The enhanced survival observed in these flies was the result, at least in part, of increasing antioxidant enzyme activities, preventing an increase in the ROS level, and maintaining GSH redox homeostasis after hyperoxia. By feeding BSO to impair antioxidant defense, we further confirmed an important role of redox homeostasis in hyperoxia-induced oxidative stresses. Download .zip (.05 MB) Help with zip files"

LR11 interacts with the amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) and regulates APP traffic and processing to amyloid-β peptide (Aβ). The functional domains of LR11 suggest that it can act as a cell surface receptor and as an intracellular sorting receptor for trans-Golgi network to endosome traffic. We show that LR11 over-expressed in HEK293 cells is radiolabeled following incubation of cells with [32Pi]orthophosphate. Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to discover putative LR11 interacting kinases. Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK) 2 was identified as a binding partner and a candidate kinase acting on LR11. LR11 and ROCK2 co-immunoprecipitate from post-mortem human brain tissue and drug inhibition of ROCK activity reduces LR11 phosphorylation in vivo. Targeted knockdown of ROCK2 with siRNA decreased LR11 ectodomain shedding while simultaneously increasing intracellular LR11 protein level. Site-directed mutagenesis of serine 2206 in the LR11 cytoplasmic tail reduced LR11 shedding, decreased LR11 phosphorylation in vitro, and abrogated LR11 mediated Aβ reduction. These findings provide direct evidence that LR11 is phosphorylated in vivo and indicate that ROCK2 phosphorylation of LR11 may enhance LR11 mediated processing of APP and amyloid production.

Aizawa T. Haga S. Nakamura S. Namba Y. Ikeda K. Brain Res. 1999; 833: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). All members of the LDLR family (including LR11) bind apolipoprotein E (ApoE). Structural elements in LR11 also place it in the vacuolar protein sorting 10 protein (VPS10p) homology domain family of intracellular sorting receptors (2Jacobsen L. Madsen P. Moestrup S.K. Lund A.H.

We first identified this receptor as a transcript that was found to be down-regulated in microarray studies examining gene expression in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD), and we subsequently demonstrated preferential neuronal loss of LR11 protein in brain regions vulnerable to AD pathology (3Scherzer C.R.

LR11 interacts directly with APP and co-localization between these proteins has been shown in endosomal and Golgi compartments in a variety of cell types, including primary neurons (4Offe K.

Based on the established interactions between the lumenal domains of LR11 and APP, we hypothesize that LR11 acts as an endosomal chaperone to increase APP traffic in a non-amyloidogenic pathway.To define the mechanisms by which LR11 modulates APP processing, it is important to analyze the functional motifs in the cytoplasmic tail of LR11 and study proteins that regulate the intracellular traffic of LR11. The domain structure of LR11 suggests that it can act as an endocytic cell surface receptor and as a sorting receptor for trans-Golgi network (TGN) to endosome traffic (2Jacobsen L. Madsen P. Moestrup S.K. Lund A.H. Tommerup N. Nykjaer A. Sottrup-Jensen L. Gliemann J. Petersen C.M. J. Biol.

The cytoplasmic tail possesses a Golgi-localizing, gamma-adaptin ear homology domain, ADP-ribosylation factor (GGA)-binding domain found on proteins, such as sortilin and mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs), that shuttle between the TGN and endosomes. In addition, LR11 harbors a putative internalization sequence, analogous to the NPXY motif for coated pit-mediated endocytosis (14Jacobsen L. Madsen P. Nielsen M.S. Geraerts W.P. Gliemann J.

LR11's NPXY-like motif (FANSHY) does not appear to be an essential internalization signal, but an acidic cluster in the cytoplasmic tail is required for AP-2 complex-dependent endocytosis (19Nielsen M.S. Gustafsen C. Madsen P. Nyengaard J.R. Hermey G. Bakke O. Mari M. Schu P. Pohlmann R. Dennes A. Petersen C.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 6842-6851Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of VPS10p family members, including sortilin and LR11, as well as MPRs is suggested to regulate protein-protein interactions with GGA adaptors to facilitate receptor traffic from Golgi to endosomes; however, direct demonstration of LR11 phosphorylation is lacking (20.Cramer, J. F., Gustafsen, C., Behrens, M. A., Oliveira, C. L., Pedersen, J. S., Madsen, P., Petersen, C. M., Thirup, S. S., Traffic 11, 259–273Google Scholar). To verify that LR11 is indeed phosphorylated in vivo, LR11 was expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and incubated with [32Pi]orthophosphate. Using LC-MS/MS we identified Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK) 2 as a putative LR11-interacting kinase. LR11 interaction with ROCK2 was validated in post-mortem human frontal cortex brain tissue. Further, we show drug inhibition of ROCK2 reduces LR11 phosphorylation in vivo, and targeted knockdown with siRNA reveals a ROCK2 associated mechanism of LR11 ectodomain shedding. Site-directed mutagenesis of potential ROCK2 phosphorylation sites in the LR11 cytoplasmic tail indicate that serine 2206 is necessary for LR11 shedding as well as LR11-mediated Aβ reduction.DISCUSSIONLR11 is a multifunctional low-density lipoprotein receptor that influences AD susceptibility. While LR11 has multiple cell biological activities that may be relevant to AD pathogenesis, we hypothesize that LR11 is an endosomal chaperone that increases APP traffic in a non-amyloidogenic pathway and helps retard amyloid accumulation (3Scherzer C.R.

Therefore, it is important to better understand the functional motifs of LR11 and the proteins that regulate LR11 activity. This study provides direct demonstration that LR11 is phosphorylated in vivo and presents compelling evidence that LR11 interacts with the serine/threonine kinase, ROCK2, in human brain. Moreover, we observed a reduction in LR11 phosphorylation in vivo following drug inhibition of ROCK2, suggesting that LR11 is a substrate of ROCK2. Targeted knockdown of ROCK2 with siRNA resulted in decreased LR11 ectodomain shedding, thus implicating ROCK2 in the mechanism(s) that promote shedding of LR11. Site-directed mutagenesis of potential ROCK2 phosphorylation sites in the LR11 cytoplasmic tail revealed that Ser-2206 is necessary for LR11 shedding as well as LR11 mediated Aβ reduction. Based on these observations, we conclude that phosphorylation of LR11 by ROCK2 exerts physiologically relevant influences on LR11 regulation of APP processing.The current study suggests that ROCK2 is stably complexed with and phosphorylates LR11. ROCK2 is a cytosolic serine/threonine kinase that translocates to membranes following stimulation of RhoA (37Leung T. Manser E. Tan L. Lim L. J. Biol.

If ROCK2 binds directly to LR11, the most plausible site of interaction and phosphorylation is LR11's cytoplasmic tail. Investigation of the 54 amino acid long intracellular tail of LR11 reveals 12 potential phosphorylation sites, including 9 serine, 2 threonine, and 1 tyrosine residues, however it is also possible that the LR11 ectodomain, like APP, harbors sites of phosphorylation (39Hung A.Y.

Notably, several Rho kinase substrates are phosphorylated at non-consensus motifs, including Calponin, Tau, and the ERM family (ezrin/radixin/moesin) (40Amano M. Kaneko T. Maeda A. Nakayama M. Ito M.

J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar).How does ROCK2 modulate LR11 shedding? Ectodomain shedding is influenced by intracellular protein-protein interactions between the substrate and signaling molecules (reviewed in Ref. 53.Hayashida, K., Bartlett, A. H., Chen, Y., Park, P. W., Anat. Rec. 293, 925–937Google Scholar), and it is hypothesized that kinases induce conformational change in the substrate to facilitate cleavage. Furthermore, metalloproteases, like TACE (TNFα-converting enzyme/ADAM 17), are activated by phosphorylation of their intracellular tail (54Díaz-Rodríguez E. Montero J.C. Esparís-Ogando A. Yuste L. Pandiella A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2031-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Therefore, ROCK2 may promote LR11 shedding by phosphorylation of LR11 cytoplasmic tail, possibly at Ser-2206, and/or by activating the sheddase(s) responsible for LR11 cleavage. The extracellular portion of LR11 includes a cluster of LDL receptor type A repeats, which binds ApoE with high affinity (55Taira K. Bujo H. Hirayama S. Yamazaki H. Kanaki T. Takahashi K. Ishii I. Miida T. Schneider W.J. Saito Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1501-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and the VPS10p homology domain that binds known ligands, including the neuropeptide head activator (HA) (23Hampe W. Riedel I.B. Lintzel J. Bader C.O. Franke I. Schaller H.C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4475-4485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phorbol esters and HA stimulate release of the LR11 ectodomain possibly mediated by TACE, but the functional implications of LR11 shedding are unclear (23Hampe W. Riedel I.B. Lintzel J. Bader C.O. Franke I. Schaller H.C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4475-4485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is hypothesized that shed LR11 ectodomain may complex with ligands to facilitate the availability of extracellular signaling factors. Following ectodomain release, the remaining intracellular tail of LR11 undergoes intramembranous cleavage by the γ-secretase complex (56Nyborg A.C. Ladd T.B. Zwizinski C.W. Lah J.J. Golde T.E. Mol. Neurodegener. 2006; 1: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), allowing nuclear translocation of the LR11 intracellular domain, where it may activate gene transcription (57Böhm C. Seibel N.M. Henkel B. Steiner H. Haass C. Hampe W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14547-14553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).Previous reports have described a link between ROCK and APP processing. Drug inhibition of ROCK with Y-27632 lowered brain levels of pathogenic Aβ in a transgenic mouse model of AD and reduced levels of Aβ in neuronal cell lines (58Zhou Y. Su Y. Li B. Liu F. Ryder J.W. Wu X. Gonzalez-DeWhitt P.A. Gelfanova V. Hale J.E. May P.C. Paul S.M. Ni B. Science. 2003; 302: 1215-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Although Y-27632 is selective for ROCKs, it does not distinguish between ROCK1 and ROCK2. In cell models, overexpression of a constitutively active ROCK1 mutant reduced α-secretase cleavage of APP, whereas a dominant-negative ROCK1 mutant elevated levels of secreted APPα (59Pedrini S. Carter T.L. Prendergast G. Petanceska S. Ehrlich M.E. Gandy S. PLoS Med. 2005; 2: e18Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We observed no affect on endogenous secreted APPα following targeted knockdown of ROCK2 with siRNA (Fig. 5A), but experiments directly testing effects of ROCK2 on amyloidogenic processing of APP have not been reported. Although the precise molecular mechanisms underlying ROCK regulation of Aβ production are not fully understood, this pathway remains an exciting avenue for rational design of AD therapeutics.Interestingly, ROCK2 depletion by siRNA reduces LR11 shedding and simultaneously increases the level of cellular LR11. The latter finding is of considerable therapeutic interest given that increasing expression of LR11 results in a reduction in Aβ (4Offe K. Dodson S.E. Shoemaker J.T. Fritz J.J. Gearing M. Levey A.I. Lah J.J. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 1596-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 11Andersen O.M. Reiche J. Schmidt V. Gotthardt M. Spoelgen R. Behlke J. von Arnim C.A. Breiderhoff T. Jansen P.

U.S.A. 2005; 102: 13461-13466Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Greater protein stability or half-life of LR11 within the cell could allow for enhanced chaperoning of APP to non-amyloidogenic compartments. Depleting cells of ROCK2 would potentially increase endocytosis of full-length LR11 or possibly redirect traffic of LR11 to an alternative intracellular compartment. Either scenario could increase LR11 traffic to endosomes, where we hypothesize LR11 exerts its effects on APP processing. Although the contribution of LR11 shedding to amyloidogenic processing of APP is unknown, mutagenesis of LR11 Ser-2206 decreased shedding of LR11 ectodomain and attenuated LR11-mediated Aβ reduction. These results suggest an association between LR11 shedding and its modulation of APP processing. Future studies using site-specific LR11 mutants that ablate interaction with ROCK2 should allow us to directly test models of LR11-ROCK2 interactions and their impact on LR11 phosphorylation, shedding, and APP processing.

Aizawa T. Haga S. Nakamura S. Namba Y. Ikeda K. Brain Res. 1999; 833: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). All members of the LDLR family (including LR11) bind apolipoprotein E (ApoE). Structural elements in LR11 also place it in the vacuolar protein sorting 10 protein (VPS10p) homology domain family of intracellular sorting receptors (2Jacobsen L. Madsen P. Moestrup S.K. Lund A.H.

We first identified this receptor as a transcript that was found to be down-regulated in microarray studies examining gene expression in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD), and we subsequently demonstrated preferential neuronal loss of LR11 protein in brain regions vulnerable to AD pathology (3Scherzer C.R. Offe K. Gearing M. Rees H.D. Fang G. Heilman C.J. Schaller C. Bujo H. Levey A.I. Lah J.J. Arch. Neurol. 2004; 61: 1200-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 4Offe K. Dodson S.E.

More recent studies suggest early loss of neuronal LR11 in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a condition which often represents prodromal AD (5Sager K.L. Wuu J. Leurgans S.E.

Additionally, genetic evidence directly links variants in the LR11 gene, SORL1, to AD risk (6Rogaeva E. Meng Y. Lee J.H. Gu Y. Kawarai T. Zou F. Katayama T. Baldwin C.T. Cheng R. Hasegawa H. Chen F.

Cell biological studies indicate that APP processing is determined by its intracellular traffic and exposure to secretase enzymes, and that Aβ is produced in the endosomal compartment as well as the early secretory pathway (7Sisodia S.S.

LR11 overexpression results in a highly consistent, dose-dependent, reduction in APP processing to Aβ (4Offe K. Dodson S.E. Shoemaker J.T. Fritz J.J. Gearing M. Levey A.I. Lah J.J. J.

Conversely, loss of LR11 expression, as occurs in sporadic AD brain, increases Aβ levels in cultured cells and accelerates amyloid pathology in a transgenic mouse model of AD (6Rogaeva E. Meng Y.

LR11 interacts directly with APP and co-localization between these proteins has been shown in endosomal and Golgi compartments in a variety of cell types, including primary neurons (4Offe K.

Based on the established interactions between the lumenal domains of LR11 and APP, we hypothesize that LR11 acts as an endosomal chaperone to increase APP traffic in a non-amyloidogenic pathway.To define the mechanisms by which LR11 modulates APP processing, it is important to analyze the functional motifs in the cytoplasmic tail of LR11 and study proteins that regulate the intracellular traffic of LR11. The domain structure of LR11 suggests that it can act as an endocytic cell surface receptor and as a sorting receptor for trans-Golgi network (TGN) to endosome traffic (2Jacobsen L. Madsen P. Moestrup S.K. Lund A.H. Tommerup N. Nykjaer A. Sottrup-Jensen L. Gliemann J. Petersen C.M. J. Biol.

The cytoplasmic tail possesses a Golgi-localizing, gamma-adaptin ear homology domain, ADP-ribosylation factor (GGA)-binding domain found on proteins, such as sortilin and mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs), that shuttle between the TGN and endosomes. In addition, LR11 harbors a putative internalization sequence, analogous to the NPXY motif for coated pit-mediated endocytosis (14Jacobsen L. Madsen P. Nielsen M.S. Geraerts W.P. Gliemann J.

LR11's NPXY-like motif (FANSHY) does not appear to be an essential internalization signal, but an acidic cluster in the cytoplasmic tail is required for AP-2 complex-dependent endocytosis (19Nielsen M.S.

Phosphorylation of VPS10p family members, including sortilin and LR11, as well as MPRs is suggested to regulate protein-protein interactions with GGA adaptors to facilitate receptor traffic from Golgi to endosomes; however, direct demonstration of LR11 phosphorylation is lacking (20.Cramer, J.

To verify that LR11 is indeed phosphorylated in vivo, LR11 was expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and incubated with [32Pi]orthophosphate. Using LC-MS/MS we identified Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK) 2 as a putative LR11-interacting kinase. LR11 interaction with ROCK2 was validated in post-mortem human frontal cortex brain tissue. Further, we show drug inhibition of ROCK2 reduces LR11 phosphorylation in vivo, and targeted knockdown with siRNA reveals a ROCK2 associated mechanism of LR11 ectodomain shedding. Site-directed mutagenesis of potential ROCK2 phosphorylation sites in the LR11 cytoplasmic tail indicate that serine 2206 is necessary for LR11 shedding as well as LR11-mediated Aβ reduction."

However, the presence and role of 2-Cys Prxs in the nucleus have not been studied. This study demonstrates that the PrxII located in the nucleus protects cancer cells from DNA damage-induced cell death. Although the two cytosolic 2-Cys Prxs, PrxI and PrxII, were found in the nucleus, only PrxII knockdown selectively and markedly increased cell death in the cancer cells treated with DNA-damaging agents. The increased death was completely reverted by the nuclearly targeted expression of PrxII in an activity-independent manner. Furthermore, the antioxidant butylated hydroxyanisole did not influence the etoposide-induced cell death. Mechanistically, the knockdown of Prx II expression impaired the DNA repair process by reducing the activation of the JNK/c-Jun pathway. These results suggest that PrxII is likely to be attributed to a tumor survival factor positively regulating JNK-dependent DNA repair with its inhibition possibly sensitizing cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents.

These results suggest that PrxII is likely to be attributed to a tumor survival factor positively regulating JNK-dependent DNA repair with its inhibition possibly sensitizing cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents."
https://openalex.org/W2144462703,"The extracellular matrix protein Reelin is an essential regulator of neuronal migration and lamination in the developing and mature brain. Lack of Reelin causes severe disturbances in cerebral layering, such as the reeler phenotype and granule cell dispersion in temporal lobe epilepsy. Reelin is synthesized and secreted by Cajal-Retzius cells and GABAergic interneurons, and its function depends on proteolytic cleavage after secretion. The mechanisms regulating these processes are largely unknown. Here, we used rat hip-pocampal slice cultures to investigate the effect of neuronal activation and hyperexcitation on Reelin synthesis, secretion, and proteolytic processing. We show that enhanced neuronal activity does not modulate Reelin synthesis or secretion. Moreover, we found that intracellular Reelin resides predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum before it is constitutively secreted via the early secretory pathway. Epileptiform activity, however, impairs the proteolytic processing of Reelin and leads to accumulation of Reelin in the extracellular matrix. We found that both conditions, epileptiform activity and impaired proteolytic cleavage of Reelin, cause granule cell dispersion via inhibition of metalloproteinases. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that secretion of Reelin is activity-independent and that proteolytic processing of Reelin is required for the maintenance of granule cell lamination in the dentate gyrus.—Tinnes, S., Schafer, M. K. E., Flubacher, A., Münzner, G., Frotscher, M., Haas, C. A. Epileptiform activity interferes with proteolytic processing of Reelin required for dentate granule cell positioning.

https://openalex.org/W1995445589,"LPS is an efficient sensitizer of the neutrophil exocytic response to a second stimulus. Although neutrophil exocytosis in response to pathogen-derived molecules plays an important role in the innate immune response to infections, the molecular mechanism underlying LPS-dependent regulation of neutrophil exocytosis is currently unknown. The small GTPase Rab27a and its effector Munc13-4 regulate exocytosis in hematopoietic cells. Whether Rab27a and Munc13-4 modulate discrete steps or the same steps during exocytosis also remains unknown. Here, using Munc13-4- and Rab27a-deficient neutrophils, we analyzed the mechanism of lipopolysaccharide-dependent vesicular priming to amplify exocytosis of azurophilic granules. We found that both Munc13-4 and Rab27a are necessary to mediate LPS-dependent priming of exocytosis. However, we show that LPS-induced mobilization of a small population of readily releasable vesicles is a Munc13-4-dependent but Rab27a-independent process. LPS-induced priming regulation could not be fully explained by secretory organelle maturation as the redistribution of the secretory proteins Rab27a or Munc13-4 in response to LPS treatment was minimal. Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and a novel mouse model expressing EGFP-Rab27a under the endogenous Rab27a promoter but lacking Munc13-4, we demonstrate that Munc13-4 is essential for the mechanism of LPS-dependent exocytosis in neutrophils and unraveled a novel mechanism of vesicular dynamics in which Munc13-4 restricts motility of Rab27a-expressing vesicles to facilitate lipopolysaccharide-induced priming of exocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1970095537,"Cytochrome P450 (P450) 7A1 is well known as the cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, the first enzyme involved in bile acid synthesis from cholesterol. The human enzyme has been reported to have the highest catalytic activity of any mammalian P450. Analyses of individual steps of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylation reaction revealed several characteristics of this reaction: (i) two-step binding of cholesterol to ferric P450, with an apparent Kd of 0.51 μm, (ii) a rapid reduction rate in the presence of cholesterol (∼10 s−1 for the fast phase), (iii) rapid formation of a ferrous P450-cholesterol-O2 complex (29 s−1), (iv) the lack of a non-competitive kinetic deuterium isotope effect, (v) the lack of a kinetic burst, and (vi) the lack of a deuterium isotope effect when the reaction was initiated with the ferrous P450-cholesterol complex. A minimum kinetic model was developed and is consistent with all of the observed phenomena and the rates of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylation and H2O and H2O2 formation. The results indicate that the first electron transfer step, although rapid, becomes rate-limiting in the overall P450 7A1 reaction. This is a different phenomenon compared with other P450s that have much lower rates of catalysis, attributed to the much more efficient substrate oxidation steps in this reaction.

In mammals, P450 enzymes play important roles in the metabolism of both endogenous substrates (e.g. fatty acids, steroids, eicosanoids) and exogenous substrates (e.g. drugs, carcinogens, pesticides). Most mammalian P450 enzymes, especially the “drug-metabolizing” P450 enzymes (e.g. P450s 1A2, 2C9, 2D6), show relatively low catalytic activity (kcat < 10 min−1, often ∼1 min−1) (3Guengerich F.P.

On the other hand, a few mammalian P450 enzymes, e.g. rat P450 2B1 and 4A1, rabbit P450 4A7, and human P450 7A1, have been reported to have higher catalytic activities (kcat ≥ 50 min−1) (6Loughran P.A.

Among these latter mammalian P450s, P450 7A1 has been reported to have quite high catalytic activity toward the substrate cholesterol (as high as 5.8 s−1) (9Nakayama K. Puchkaev A. Pikuleva I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31459-31465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This enzyme is well known as the cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the classic pathway of bile acid synthesis, with a daily elimination of 400–600 mg of cholesterol in humans (10Pikuleva I.A.

A kcat/Km value reported for recombinant P450 7A1 was 4 × 105 m−1 s−1, although the cholesterol 7α-hydroxylation activity in human liver microsomes has been reported to be <0.13 pmol/s/mg of microsomal protein (kcat ∼ 0.06 s−1) (12Einarsson K.

This efficiency (kcat/Km) of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylation by recombinant P450 7A1 is ∼10-fold higher than that of testosterone 6β-hydroxylation by P450 3A4, which is one of the faster reactions catalyzed by the drug-metabolizing P450 enzymes (15Krauser J.A. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19496-19506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, to our knowledge no detailed kinetic studies on cholesterol 7α-hydroxylation activity by P450 7A1 are available, and why P450 7A1 shows such high catalytic activity is unknown. We have been interested in the reaction cycles of several mammalian P450s with low catalytic efficiencies, including the rate-limiting steps in reactions (15Krauser J.A. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol.

Our previous reports on the reactions of P450s 1A2, 2A6, 2D6, and 3A4 show that the C-H bond-breaking step of each reaction is mainly or partially rate-limiting, as judged by kinetic deuterium isotope effects. Kinetic analysis on P450 7A1, with its high catalytic efficiency, was done for comparison with low efficiency P450 reactions to better understand differences between them and to define why P450 rates vary so much. In the present study we analyzed individual reaction steps and developed a detailed kinetic model of P450 7A1 reaction cycle with individual rate constants. The substrate binding, C-H bond-breaking, and product release steps are not rate-limiting. The results indicate that the first electron transfer step, although as rapid as observed with other mammalian P450s, becomes rate-limiting in the P450 7A1 reaction. Cholesterol, 17α-ethynylestradiol, dansyl chloride, 4,4-dimethylaminopyridine, protocatechuate, protocatechuate dioxygenase, HPβCD, and Tween 20 were purchased from Sigma. 7α-OH cholesterol was purchased from Steraloids (Newport, RI). HPLC grade solvents were purchased from Fisher. 5-Deazaflavin was a gift of the late V. Massey (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). An expression plasmid including the cDNA of truncated (Δ2–24) P450 7A1, with a C-terminal His6 tag in pTrc 99a, was kindly provided by I. A. Pikuleva (Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH) (9Nakayama K. Puchkaev A. Pikuleva I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31459-31465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli GC5-competent cells (Genesee Scientific Corp., San Diego, CA) with pGro7 (Takara, Shiga, Japan) and expressed as follows. An overnight culture was diluted 1:100 (v/v) into Terrific Broth medium (BD Diagnostics, Sparks, MD) containing ampicillin (0.3 mm) and chloramphenicol (0.5 mm) and grown at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm in an incubator (ATR Multitron, Laurel, MD) until the OD600 reached 0.6. Isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm), δ-aminolevulinic acid (0.5 mm), and l-arabinose (27 mm) were added, and the cultures were incubated at 26 °C for 42 h (190 rpm). All steps were performed at 4 °C. Cells were lysed, and a cytosolic fraction was obtained using modifications of a procedure reported previously (9Nakayama K. Puchkaev A. Pikuleva I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31459-31465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). After dilution with Buffer A (400 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 1 m KCl, 20% glycerol (v/v), 0.5% CHAPS (w/v), and 1 mm imidazole) to a concentration of 2 mg/ml total protein (as determined by a bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA, Pierce)), the cytosolic material was loaded onto a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin column (2.5 × 6 cm, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) equilibrated with Buffer A. The column was washed with 20 column volumes of Buffer B (400 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 1 m NaCl, 20% glycerol (v/v), 0.5% CHAPS (w/v), and 20 mm imidazole). P450 7A1 was then eluted with Buffer C (400 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 1 m NaCl, 20% glycerol (v/v), 0.5% CHAPS (w/v), and 300 mm imidazole). The fractions showing absorbance at 417 nm were pooled, dialyzed overnight against 100 sample volumes of Buffer D (10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 20% glycerol (v/v) and 0.3% CHAPS (w/v)), and applied to a hydroxylapatite column (2.5 × 5 cm) equilibrated with Buffer D. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of Buffer D, and P450 7A1 was eluted with 400 ml of an increasing linear gradient of 10–400 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2, including 20% glycerol (v/v) and 0.3% CHAPS (w/v)). After two dialyzes (12 h) against 100 sample volumes of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) including 20% glycerol (v/v) and 1 mm EDTA, the purified P450 7A1 was stored at −70 °C. The expression level of P450 7A1 was ∼ 600 nmol/liter. Purified P450 7A1 (final yield ∼250 nmol from 1 liter of bacteria) showed a single major band when analyzed for electrophoretic purity as well as typical P450 spectral properties (supplemental Figs. S1 and S2). Rat NADPH-P450 reductase was expressed in E. coli and purified as described elsewhere (19Hanna I.H. Teiber J.F. Kokones K.L. Hollenberg P.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker 500-MHz spectrometer in the Vanderbilt facility (Bruker, Billerica, MA). Mass spectra of synthesized compounds were acquired in the Vanderbilt facility using a Thermo LTQ instrument (ThermoFinnigan, Sunnydale, CA) equipped with a Waters Acquity UPLC system (Waters, Milford, MA). A Thermo-Finnigan TSQ Quantum mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan) connected to a Waters Acuity UPLC system was used for quantitation of dansylated compounds. UV-visible spectra were recorded with either an Aminco DW2/OLIS or a Cary14/OLIS spectrophotometer (On-Line Instrument Systems, Bogart, GA). Stopped-flow UV-visible absorbance experiments were performed using an OLIS RSM-1000 instrument (On-Line Instrument Systems) as described previously (16Guengerich F.P. Krauser J.A. Johnson W.W. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10775-10788Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 17Yun C.H. Kim K.H. Calcutt M.W. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12279-12291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Stopped-flow experiments were generally reported as the averages of four individual kinetic assays. A general procedure (20Cunningham I.M. Overton K.H. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin 1. 1974; : 2458-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) was used; Al2HCl2 was prepared by stirring LiAl2H4 (Sigma, 58 mg, 1.4 mmol, > 98% D atom excess) and AlCl3 (0.73 g, 5.5 mmol) in dry (C2H5)2O (freshly opened can) for 10 min at −20 °C under dry N2. To this was added (dropwise, in (C2H5)2O) 184 mg of 7-ketocholesterol (Sigma, 0.46 mmol) over 10 min. The reaction was stirred for an additional 10 min and quenched with the careful addition of H2O. The product was extracted into (C2H5)2O three times, and the combined layers were dried with MgSO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The product was purified using isocratic reversed-phase HPLC with a Phenomenex octadecylsilane column (10 × 250 mm, 5 μm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). HPLC conditions were as follows. The solvent contained 45% CH3CN, 50% CH3OH, and 5% tert-butyl methyl ether (v/v/v), and the flow rate was 1.0 ml/min. The column temperature was maintained at 25 °C. The tR of d2-cholesterol was 32 min. LC-MS analysis indicated that the purified d2-cholesterol had >98.5% isotopic purity (supplemental Fig. S3, A and B). The disappearance of the δ 1.97 1H NMR peak and the decrease in the number of integrated 1H peaks located between δ 1.48 and 1.62 from 9 (d0-cholesterol, supplemental Fig. S3C) to 8 (d2-cholesterol, supplemental Fig. S3D) indicate that both the H-7α and H-7β atoms were substituted with deuterium (20Cunningham I.M. Overton K.H. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin 1. 1974; : 2458-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 21Wilson W.K. Sumpter R.M. Warren J.J. Rogers P.S. Ruan B. Schroepfer Jr., G.J. J.

The singlet peak for the H-6 proton (δ 5.35) of d2-cholesterol is also indicative of the incorporation of deuterium atoms at both the 7α-and 7β-positions. Steady-state enzyme assays were generally conducted in a 0.50-ml reaction volume at 37 °C for 60 s in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Enzyme reaction mixtures typically contained 0.02 μm P450 7A1, 1.0 μm NADPH-P450 reductase, 60 μm di-12:0 GPC, 3.1 mm HPβCD (0.45%, w/v)), and 0.41 mm Tween 20 (0.05%, v/v)). Incubations were initiated by the addition of an NADPH-generating system (23Guengerich F.P. Bartleson C.J. Hayes A.W. 5th Ed. Principles and Methods of Toxicology. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL2007: 1981-2048Google Scholar). Reactions were quenched with 2.0 ml of CH2Cl2 including 150 pmol of 17α-ethynylestradiol (as an internal standard) and mixed with a vortex device. After centrifugation (2000 × g, 5 min), 1.4 ml of the organic layer was transferred and taken to dryness under an N2 stream. A general method for derivatization with dansyl chloride (24Tang Z. Guengerich F.P. Anal. Chem. 2010; 82: 7706-7712Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) was used with slight modification. Briefly, the samples were dissolved in 200 μl of CH2Cl2 containing 2 mg of dansyl chloride, 0.5 mg of 4,4-dimethylaminopyridine, and 2 μl of triethylamine and incubated at 65 °C for 1 h. The samples were dried under an N2 stream and then dissolved in 100 μl of CH3CN for analysis. Dansylated products were analyzed with LC-MS using a UPLC system connected to a TSQ Quantum mass spectrometer with a Hypersil GOLD octadecylsilane column (2.1 × 150 mm, 3 μm, Thermo Scientific). LC conditions were as follows. Solvent A contained 95% H2O, 5% CH3CN, and 0.1% HCO2H (v/v/v), and solvent B contained 5% H2O, 85% CH3CN, 10% tert-butyl methyl ether, and 0.1% HCO2H (v/v/v/v). The column was maintained at the initial condition of 50% B (v/v) for 0.5 min with a flow rate of 350 μl/min followed by a linear gradient increasing to 100% B over 2.0 min. This condition was maintained for 6.5 min and then returned to the initial condition over 0.05 min and maintained until the end of a 12-min run. The column temperature was maintained at 40 °C. The injection volume (onto the column) was 15 μl. MS analyses were performed in the positive ion electrospray mode. Quantitation was done in a multiple reaction monitoring mode (dansylated 7α-OH cholesterol, m/z 636 → 367, collision energy 10 V; dansylated 17α-ethynylestradiol, m/z 530 → 171, collision energy 40 V). The following (optimized) parameters were used for the detection of the analyte and the internal standard; N2 sheath gas, 27 p.s.i.; N2 auxiliary gas, 25 p.s.i.; spray voltage, 5.0 kV; capillary temperature, 270 °C; capillary offset, 35 V; tube lens voltage, 221 V; argon collision gas, 1.5 mtorr; scan time, 50 ms Q3 scan width 1 m/z; Q1/Q3 peak widths at half-maximum, 0.7 m/z. The data were collected and quantified using ThermoFinnigan XCalibur Version 1.0 software. Kinetic deuterium isotope effects were determined using a non-competitive method. P450 7A1 was incubated with either d0-cholesterol or 7,7-d2-cholesterol, varying the concentration from 0.625 to 20 μm in the general reconstituted system. The kcat and Km values were calculated using the program Dynafit (25Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). The product formed from 7,7-d2-cholesterol by P450 7A1 was 7β-d1,7α-OH cholesterol (26Bergstrom S. Lindstredt S. Samuelson B. Corey E.J. Gregprious G.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1958; 80: 2337-2338Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar) (see below). Dansylated 7β-d1,7α-OH cholesterol was quantified in the multiple reaction monitoring method, monitoring at m/z 637 → 368, assuming that the ion intensity of dansylated 7β-d1,7α-OH cholesterol is the same as that of dansylated 7α-OH cholesterol. Pre-steady-state rapid quench kinetic experiments were conducted with a quenched-flow apparatus (model RFQ-3, KinTek Corp., Austin, TX). Enzyme reaction mixtures contained 0.5 μm P450 7A1, 7.5 μm NADPH-P450 reductase, 60 μm di-12:0 GPC, 50 μm cholesterol, 3.1 mm HPβCD, and 0.41 mm Tween 20. Incubations were initiated by the rapid addition of 500 μm NADPH and quenched by the addition of 2% ZnSO4 (w/v) after a time period varying from 20 ms to 2 s at 37 °C. After extraction, the derivatization and quantitation steps were conducted as described above. NADPH oxidation and H2O2 and H2O formation were measured as described previously (18Guengerich F.P. Miller G.P. Hanna I.H. Sato H. Martin M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33711-33719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These experiments were conducted with a reconstituted system described above using 200 μm NADPH instead of an NADPH-generating system. The basic system is as described previously (16Guengerich F.P.

Ballou D.P. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 286: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The scrubbing system was not used in the reactions of ferrous P450 7A1 with oxygen. The program Dynafit (25Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar) was used for fitting of steady-state binding and activity data and the P450 reaction model. KinTek Explorer® software (KinTek Corp., Austin, TX) (28Johnson K.A. Simpson Z.B. Blom T. Anal. Biochem. 2009; 387: 20-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) was used for pre-steady-state binding studies. GraphPad Prism (GraphPad, San Diego, CA) was employed for fitting other data. The amount of cholesterol in human liver microsomal samples was first quantified. Human liver microsomes were diluted with H2O (0.01 mg protein/ml), and 1.0 ml of each diluted sample was extracted with 2.0 ml of CH2Cl2, including 1.0 nmol of 7α-OH cholesterol (as the internal standard). After centrifugation, 1.4 ml of the organic layer was transferred, dried under an N2 stream, and dissolved in 200 μl of CH2Cl2 containing 2 mg of dansyl chloride, 0.5 mg of 4,4-dimethylaminopyridine, and 2 μl of triethylamine and incubated at 65 °C for 1 h (24Tang Z. Guengerich F.P. Anal. Chem. 2010; 82: 7706-7712Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The samples were dried under an N2 stream and then dissolved in 75 μl of CH3OH for analysis. Dansylated products were analyzed with a UPLC system connected to an Acquity fluorescence detector using an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 octadecylsilane column (2.1 × 50 mm, 1.7 μm, Waters). LC conditions were as follows. Solvent A contained 95% H2O, 5% CH3CN, and 0.1% HCO2H (v/v/v), and solvent B contained 5% H2O, 85% CH3CN, 10% tert-butyl methyl ether, and 0.1% HCO2H (v/v/v/v). The column was maintained at the initial condition of 50% B (v/v) for 0.25 min with a flow rate of 500 μl/min followed by a linear gradient increasing to 100% B over 1.0 min. This condition was maintained for 4.25 min then returned to the initial condition over 0.01 min and maintained until the end of a 7-min run. The column temperature was maintained at 40 °C. The injection volume was 7.5 μl. Fluorescence measurements were made using an excitation wavelength of 340 nm and an emission wavelength of 525 nm. The data collection and quantitative analysis were conducted with Waters MassLynx version 4.1 and QuanLinx Version 4.1 software, respectively. Aliquots of individual human liver microsomes including exactly 10 nmol of cholesterol were added to a 0.50-ml of reaction mixture contained 3.1 mm HPβCD in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The assays were conducted at 37 °C for 30 min. Incubations were initiated by the addition of an NADPH-generating system. After extraction, the derivatization and quantitation steps were conducted as described above. The proteins in individual human liver microsomes (75 μg of protein per well, in triplicate) were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7.5%, w/v) along with standard samples that included 75 μg of human liver microsomal protein and varying amounts of purified P450 7A1 (0–600 fmol) per well. The proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). A commercial primary rabbit polyclonal antibody to human P450 7A1 (ab79847, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) was used (1500-fold dilution in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4 containing 150 mm NaCl)). The secondary antibody was goat anti-rabbit IRD800CW, which emits infrared light at 800 nm (detected using an Odyssey Li-Cor instrument (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE)). The slope of the standard curve (based on the spiked samples) was used to quantify the amount of P450 7A1 in individual human liver microsomal samples. The rates of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylation activity of P450 7A1 measured in the presence of 0.41 mm Tween 20 were more than 6-fold higher than those measured in the absence of Tween 20 (Fig. 2A). This result confirmed that Tween 20 is essential for the high catalytic activity under these experimental conditions, as reported previously (29Mast N. Pikuleva I.A. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1561-1568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 30Norlin M. Andersson U. Björkhem I. Wikvall K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34046-34053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cholesterol binding to Tween 20 and HPβCD has been reported with Kd values of 2.5 and 1.5 mm, respectively (29Mast N. Pikuleva I.A. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1561-1568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), which were used here. All models used to fit the data in this report include these two equilibria (i.e. cholesterol + Tween 20 ⇄ cholesterol-Tween 20 and cholesterol + HPβCD ⇄ cholesterol-HPβCD), further assuming that kon values of cholesterol for both compounds are ∼108 m−1 s−1 (supplemental Fig. S4A). The rate of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylation was dependent on the concentration of NADPH-P450 reductase (Fig. 2B), and with 0.20 μm P450 7A1 in the assay a 15-fold greater concentration of the reductase was required for saturation (i.e. 3 μm). When the experiment was repeated with 20 nm P450 7A1, the concentration of reductase required for saturation was 1000 nm (50-fold excess) (results not shown). The estimated Kd value of the NADPH-P450 reductase-P450 7A1 complex was estimated to be 1.2 ± 0.3 μm using a Dynafit analysis of three sets of data (P450 concentrations of 20, 200, and 500 nm P450 7A1), i.e. treating the reductase as a substrate and assuming that steps after binding are not limiting (somewhat over-simplified model). The calculated kcat and Km cholesterol values (in the presence of 0.41 mm Tween 20) were 3.1 ± 0.3 s−1 and 1.3 ± 0.4 μm, respectively (Fig. 2A, supplemental Fig. S4A), yielding an estimated catalytic efficiency of 2.4 × 106 m−1 s−1. Binding of cholesterol to P450 7A1 induced a substrate-type (type I) difference spectrum (31Schenkman J.B. Remmer H. Estabrook R.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1967; 3: 113-123PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, inset). The rates of spectral changes were monitored using stopped-flow spectroscopy (Fig. 4). The traces could not be fit well to a simple one-step binding model (E + L ⇄ EL), even when including the steps of cholesterol binding to Tween 20 and HPβCD (see above) using KinTek Explorer® software, although the calculated kon value, 2.3 ± 0.2 × 106 m−1 s−1, is acceptable as a diffusion-limited rate constant for interaction of an enzyme and ligand (32Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1999: 158-159Google Scholar). Instead of a one-step model, a two-step binding model (E + L ⇄ EL ⇄ LE) was used, with a spectroscopically silent first step followed by a second conformational change step associated with the change in the spectrum of P450 7A1 (33Sohl C.D.

This two-step binding model provided a good fit to the curve, and the Kd value calculated from the rate constants was 0.51 μm (Fig. 4). This model, with the calculated rate constants, also provided a good fit to steady-state titration data, indicating that the model is reasonable for cholesterol binding to P450 7A1 (Fig. 3, supplemental Fig. S4B).FIGURE 4Pre-steady-state binding kinetics of cholesterol to P450 7A1.

One syringe contained 2.0 μm P450 7A1, 120 μm di-12:0 GPC, 40 μm cholesterol, 6.2 mm HPβCD, and 0.82 mm Tween 20 in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4, reduced with excess solid Na2S2O4 immediately before loading), and the other syringe contained CO-saturated (nominally 1000 μm CO) 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The rate of the binding of CO to P450 7A1 was estimated at 24 ± 1 s−1 using GraphPad Prism software (single exponential, data not shown). This CO binding step was incorporated into a model to estimate reduction rates of ferric P450 7A1 (see below). Ferric P450 7A1 reduction rates were measured in an anaerobic CO environment, with ferrous P450 trapped as the CO complex. The rate of reduction of ferric P450 7A1 was slow in the absence of cholesterol, with a fit to a single exponential of 0.18 ± 0.01 s−1 (Fig. 5D). In the presence o"

However, whether and how the process of embryo implantation is affected by environmental factors such as stress-induced sympathetic activation remained elusive. Here we report an unexpected, transient effect of β2-adrenoreceptor (β2-AR) activation (day 4 postcoitus) in disrupting embryo spacing at implantation, leading to substantially increased midterm pregnancy loss. The abnormal embryo spacing could be prevented by pretreatment of β2-AR antagonist or genetic ablation of β-AR. Similar β2-AR activation at day 5 postcoitus, when implantation sites have been established, did not affect embryo spacing or pregnancy outcome, indicating that the adverse effect of β2-AR activation is limited to the preimplantation period before embryo attachment. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that the transient β2-AR activation abolished normal preimplantation uterine contractility without adversely affecting blastocyst quality. The contractility inhibition is mediated by activation of the cAMP-PKA pathway and accompanied by specific down-regulation of lpa3, a gene previously found to be critical for uterine contraction and embryo spacing. These results indicated that normal uterine contraction-mediated correct intrauterine embryo distribution is crucial for successful ongoing pregnancy.

Abnormal β2-AR activation at early pregnancy provided a molecular clue in explaining how maternal stress at early stages could adversely affect the pregnancy outcome. Pregnancy loss is a common and painful condition for gestational women, accounting for 25–40% of total pregnancies worldwide (1Norwitz E.R. Schust D.J. Fisher S.J. N. Engl. J.

Although the exact etiology of miscarriage varies, it is believed that for many patients, the cause of midterm miscarriage/abnormal pregnancy has been seeded very early during the onset of embryo implantation (3van Oppenraaij R.H.

Recent animal studies and clinical investigations indicated that suboptimal embryo implantation at the wrong time and wrong place could cause adverse effects on pregnancy outcome (6Ye X. Hama K.

Med. 1999; 340: 1796-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear how and to what extent these implantation abnormalities are influenced by environmental factors such as stress-induced sympathetic activation. Epidemiological data have shown that maternal stress at early pregnancy is strongly associated with various complications during ongoing gestation (9Gold K.J. Dalton V.K. Schwenk T.L. Hayward R.A. Gen. Hosp. Psychiatry. 2007; 29: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 10Neugebauer R. Kline J. Stein Z. Shrout P. Warburton D. Susser M. Am. J.

Considering that the uterus is an organ with extensive sympathetic innervations (12Houdeau E. Rousseau A. Meusnier C. Prud'Homme M.J. Rousseau J.P. J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 399: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), it is our hypothesis that stress-induced adrenergic receptor activation may directly affect embryo-maternal interactions during implantation, resulting in pregnancy complications and miscarriage. In this study, we demonstrated that a transient β2-AR 3The abbreviations used are: β2-AR, β2-adrenoceptor; HB-EGF, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid receptor; PG, prostaglandin; pc, postcoitus. activation at preimplantation disrupted embryo spacing and caused subsequent embryo loss at midgestation due to disrupted uterine contraction before embryo attachment. Our data highlighted that the concerted uterine contraction is a crucial factor for successful implantation and ongoing pregnancy. Also, this study provided β2-AR activation as a molecular link in explaining how maternal stress at early stages could adversely affect pregnancy outcome. Adult CD1 mice (7–8 weeks old) were purchased from Vital River Laboratories Co. Ltd., and the β-AR knock-out (Adrb1/Adrb2 double knock-out) mice were imported from The Jackson Laboratory (stock number: 003810). Adult female mice in estrus were mated with fertile males of CD1 at room temperature (25 °C). The morning of finding a vaginal plug was designated as day 1 postcoitus (pc). The implantation sites on day 5 were identified by intravenous injection of 0.1 ml of 1% Chicago blue dye (Sigma) in saline. Implantation sites closely apposed or fused together were designated as “crowded sites.” To examine the midterm pregnancy status, implantation sites and embryos were isolated at day 12 of pregnancy and weighed individually after being fixed in Bouin's solution overnight. Different adrenergic drugs were administered twice (intraperitoneal injection) at 8:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m., respectively on day 4 of pregnancy. These drugs include: prazosin hydrochloride (Sigma) (100 μg/mouse), p-lodoelonidine hydrochloride (Sigma) (50 μg/mouse), yohimbine hydrochloride (Sigma) (200 μg/mouse), (S)-(−)-atenolol (Sigma) (100 μg/mouse), isoetharine mesylate salt (Sigma) (200 μg/mouse), terbutaline hemisulfate salt (Sigma) (2 mg/mouse), propranolol (Sigma) (1 mg/mouse), butoxamine (Sigma), and Salbutamol (Alfa Aesar) (2 mg/mouse). Drugs were prepared in saline. To reverse the effects induced by β2-AR agonist (Salbutamol), mice were pretreated with β2-AR antagonist (propranolol or butoxamine (1 mg/mouse)) 30 min before Salbutamol. The vehicle group mice received saline only. The dosage of each drug was referenced or modified as used previously (13Allix S. Reyes-Gomez E. Aubin-Houzelstein G. Noël D. Tiret L. Panthier J.J.

The optimal dosage and timing of β2-AR agonist (Salbutamol) administration was defined by dose- and time-dependent assay (see supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). CD1 virgin female mice were mated with vasectomized males to induce pseudopregnancy. On day 4 postcoitus, artificial decidualization with separated deciduoma was induced with a modified protocol by infusion of 1 μl of sesame oil (the previous standard protocol used 10 μl of oil (17Brandon J.M. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1990; 88: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar)) into one uterine lumen, whereas the contralateral horn without any treatment served as control. The oil-induced deciduoma were detected on day 6 by the blue dye method as described above. Total RNA was extracted from fresh tissues using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and genomic DNA was removed using the RNase-free DNase (Promega, Madison, WI). RT-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR were conducted as described previously (18Zhao P. De A. Hu Z. Li J. Mulders S.M. Sollewijn Gelpke M.D. Duan E.K. Hsueh A.J. Endocrinology. 2008; 149: 2782-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Positive control consists of a mixture of cDNAs from brain, liver, and kidney, which covers the expression of all adrenergic receptor family members, and water served as the negative control. The primers used for amplifying mouse adrenergic receptors and implantation-related genes were listed in supplemental Table S1 and supplemental Table S2. Detections of β2-AR on day 4 uteri were performed in a frozen section with standard protocols. Immunofluorescence detections of β2-AR (Abcam), HB-EGF (R&D), EGFR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and ErbB-4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) on blastocysts recovered from day 4 uteri (8:00 p.m.) were performed as described previously (19Kuang H. Chen Q. Fan X. Zhang Y. Zhang L. Peng H. Cao Y. Duan E. J. Cell. Physiol. 2009; 221: 448-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). At day 4, at 4:00 p.m., embryos were flushed from the uteri of vehicle- and β2-AR agonist (Salbutamol)-treated groups. Morphologically normal blastocysts were counted in both groups. Recovered blastocysts were used for embryo transfer into recipient females of day 4 pc pseudopregnancy. The recipient mice were kept until term pregnancy, and the number of pups sired was documented at term pregnancy. The uterine contractile activity assay was performed as described previously (13Allix S. Reyes-Gomez E. Aubin-Houzelstein G. Noël D. Tiret L. Panthier J.J. Bernex F. Biol. Reprod. 2008; 79: 510-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In brief, 5 mm of uteri were removed from wild-type and β-AR null(Adrb1/Adrb2) mice at day 4 pc and mounted in a thermostat organ bath (Chengdu Equipment Factory, China) at 37 °C with carbogen (95% O2 + 5% CO2). Each sample was mounted vertically in the organ bath, and their contractility was detected by a tension (strength) transducer (JZJ01H, Chengdu Equipment Factory) coupled to a RM6240BD multichannel amplifier (Chengdu Equipment Factory). The uteri were allowed to equilibrate for at least 1 h in the Krebs solution (118 mm NaCl, 4.5 mm KCl, 1.0 mm MgSO4, 1.0 mm KH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 6.0 mm glucose). After equilibration, the β2-AR agonist (Salbutamol), β2-AR antagonist (propranolol), and forskolin were then added to the bath. For each sample, uterine contractility was recorded for at least 1 h. Uteri from day 4 pregnant mice were incubated in an organ bath 10 min after adding β2-AR agonist Salbutamol (5 ng/ml) or forskolin (3.5 μg/ml), and the samples were flash-frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen for cAMP or PKA detection. cAMP detection was performed by using the commercially available cAMP enzyme immunoassay kit (Sigma), and PKA detection was performed by using a SignaTECT® cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) assay system (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. Uteri from day 4 pregnant mice were injected with β2-AR agonist Salbutamol (2 mg/mice) or vehicle (saline) twice as described under “Drug Treatments.” At day 4, at 4:00 p.m., mice were sacrificed, and their uteri were flash-frozen and crushed in liquid nitrogen. Specimens were used for PGE2 detection with the prostaglandin E2 affinity purification kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) and prostaglandin E2 EIA kit (Cayman Chemical). Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 11.5. The significances of embryo crowding after treatment of adrenergic drugs were analyzed by the rank sum test. Other statistical analyses were using the unpaired two-tailed t test. To examine the potential roles of adrenergic receptor signaling in embryo implantation, we first screened the expression profile of different adrenergic receptors in preimplantation uteri on day 4 pc. Among adrenergic receptor family, the β2-AR showed dominant expression, with intense myometrial localization and relatively weak expression at luminal and glandular epithelium (Fig. 1A and B), suggesting a potential role in regulating preimplantation uterine function. We further performed systemic administration of various adrenergic drugs on preimplantation mice at day 4 pc, and the implantation status was examined on day 5 pc. We found that although none of the drugs caused significant changes on the numbers of implantation, the β2-AR agonist, Salbutamol (similar results also obtained with terbutaline), severely disrupted intrauterine embryo distribution in 80% (24 of 30) of treated mice, with a substantial number (32.1%) of implantation sites severely crowded together (Fig. 1, C, D, and G). Despite the abnormal embryo spacing, both vehicle-treated and β2-AR agonist-treated groups did not adversely affect the timing of embryo implantation. As shown in Fig. 1, E and F, both groups showed distinguishable implantation sites at the predicted time (day 4 pc at 12:00 a.m.) of initial embryo attachment (Fig. 1E), and the implantation numbers of days 5 and 6 pc were also comparable (Fig. 1F). In the uterus with disrupted embryo spacing, the blue bands were sometimes so close together that it is difficult to distinguish how many implantation sites were present (Fig. 1G). Indeed, at the later stage of post-implantation, histological examination often revealed that two or more embryos shared one deciduum or one placenta (Fig. 1G and Fig. 2A). The abnormal embryo spacing caused by Salbutamol could be substantially reversed by pretreatment of β2-AR antagonist (butoxamine or propranolol) (Fig. 1, G and H). Moreover, the adverse effect of Salbutamol is totally abolished in β-AR knock-out mice (Fig. 1, G and H), indicating that the observed disturbance on embryo spacing is a specific effect of β2-AR activation. To examine the ongoing effects of abnormal embryo spacing at implantation, we next examined the pregnancy status at midterm gestation (day 12 pc) after transient β2-AR agonist treatment on day 4 pc. Although most vehicle-treated mice showed well developed implantation sites, mice after β2-AR activation showed increased embryo resorption rate, and the average implantation site weight and surviving embryo weight also significantly decreased (Fig. 2, A–D). The resorption sites and retarded embryo growth were usually found at regions with crowded embryos and were also found at the very end of the cervix pole (Fig. 2A). At the end of pregnancy, the litter size was significantly decreased in the β2-AR agonist-treated group (Fig. 2E). Again, the adverse effects could be substantially rescued by pretreatment with β2-AR antagonist (propranolol) at day 4 pc before β2-AR agonist administration (Fig. 2, A–E). To rule out the possibility that the impaired pregnancy by β2-AR agonist originated from abnormal post-implantation events rather than disrupted embryo distribution, we compared the effects of β2-AR agonist treatment before (day 4 pc) and after initiation of embryo implantation (day 5 pc). As shown in Fig. 2, A–E, the same drug treatment on day 5 pc no longer adversely affected pregnancy outcome, indicating that the observed pregnancy loss specifically originated from preimplantation events right before the initiation of embryo attachment. To exam whether the transient β2-AR activation at day 4 pc adversely influenced blastocyst quality, we checked blastocysts recovered from mice with or without β2-AR agonist treatment. As shown in Fig. 3, the expression of β2-AR itself also showed no apparent changes by immunofluorescence detection (Fig. 3A). We also found no significant changes in molecular markers (HB-EGF, EGFR, and ErbB4 (receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-4)), which are important for embryo implantation (Fig. 3, B–D) (20Hamatani T. Daikoku T. Wang H. Matsumoto H. Carter M.G. Ko M.S. Dey S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 10326-10331Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 21Wang J. Mayernik L. Schultz J.F.

Andrews G.K. Dey S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The embryo numbers and morphologies (Fig. 3, E and F) are comparable in both groups as well. More importantly, by carrying out embryo transfer experiments, we demonstrated that the transient β2-AR activation did not adversely affect the quality and developmental potential of the embryos (Fig. 3G). These experiments ruled out the possibility that the observed pregnancy loss originated from impaired embryo quality, suggesting an alternative cause by abnormal uterine function that fails to guide normal intrauterine embryo distribution. To further address that the observed aberrant intrauterine embryo distribution caused by β2-AR activation is maternally originated independent of the living embryo, we next figured out a simple in vivo method to examine the uterine function concerning distribution of intrauterine contents. By modifying a well used technique to induce early implantation responses in pseudopregnancy uterus (24Dey S.K. Lim H. Das S.K. Reese J. Paria B.C. Daikoku T. Wang H. Endocr. Rev. 2004; 25: 341-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar), we injected a small amount of oil (1 μl) into uterine lumen at day 4 pseudopregnancy to induce separated deciduoma (checked at day 6 pc) (Fig. 4A). In contrast, after β2-AR agonist administration, the same oil injection no longer induces separated but diffused deciduoma (Fig. 4A), indicating that the injected oil failed to be separated into small droplets along the uterine horn. This experiment suggested that the normal day 4 uterus has the ability to separate intrauterine contents in a similar fashion as intrauterine embryos (25Restall B.J. Bindon B.M. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1971; 24: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), which could be disrupted by abnormal β2-AR activation. These results indicated that the observed embryo spacing defects were caused by maternally originated uterine dysfunction, possibly due to aberrant uterine peristaltic movement guided by myometrial contraction (26Crane L.H. Martin L. Reprod. Fertil. Dev. 1991; 3: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 27Pusey J. Kelly W.A. Bradshaw J.M. Porter D.G. Biol. Reprod. 1980; 23: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To directly demonstrate that β2-AR activation influences uterine contractility, we carried out a well established in vitro uterine contractility assay. Although the normal day 4 uterus showed a regular contraction pattern, a very low dose (1 ng/ml) of exogenous β2-AR agonist significantly decreased the amplitude of uterine contractility, whereas a relatively higher dose (5 ng/ml) could completely abolish the uterine contraction (Fig. 4, C and D). Because cAMP-PKA elevation is the classical signaling induced by β2-AR activation, we next measured the cAMP levels and PKA activities from uterine extracts and showed that Salbutamol could induce uterine cAMP and PKA elevation to an extent similar to that by forskolin, a well used activator for cAMP-PKA signaling (Fig. 4, E and F). Indeed, forskolin could similarly inhibit uterine contraction (Fig. 4G). These results indicated that the inhibitory effect of myometrium contractility after β2-AR activation is mediated through cAMP-PKA elevation. As expected, pretreatment of β2-AR antagonist (propranolol) made the uterus resistant to the inhibitory effect of β2-AR agonist, similar to that of the β-AR knock-out uterus, while still sensitive to forskolin-induced contractility inhibition (Fig. 4, H and I). To further explore the potential molecular mechanisms of β2-AR activation on preimplantation uterus, we examined gene expression profiles relating to uterine receptivity and embryo distribution. As shown in Fig. 5A, most genes critical for uterine receptivity (lif (leukemia inhibitory factor), hb-egf, ihh (Indian hedgehog homolog), and so forth) (4Wang H. Dey S.K. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar, 24Dey S.K. Lim H. Das S.K. Reese J. Paria B.C. Daikoku T. Wang H. Endocr.

Because prostaglandin (PG) signal has been highlighted as a key pathway for normal embryo spacing (6Ye X. Hama K. Contos J.J. Anliker B. Inoue A. Skinner M.K. Suzuki H. Amano T. Kennedy G. Arai H. Aoki J. Chun J. Nature. 2005; 435: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 7Song H. Lim H. Paria B.C. Matsumoto H. Swift L.L. Morrow J. Bonventre J.V. Dey S.K.

Reprod. 1977; 16: 286-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), we further carefully examined PG signal-related enzymes (COX-1, COX-2, and cytosolic phospholipases A2α (cPLA2)) and membrane prostaglandin E receptors 1–4 (EP1–4) between β2-AR agonist- and vehicle-treated groups. However, no significant changes were found at the transcription level (Fig. 5A) of these genes as well as in uterine PGE2 contents (vehicle versus Salbutamol, 1606.60 ± 82.93 and 1604.66 ± 325.58 pg/g of tissue; p > 0.05, n = 3 for each group, mean ± S.E.), suggesting that the β2-AR activation-mediated embryo crowding is PG-independent or at the downstream of PG signaling in regulating uterine contractility. Surprisingly, after transient β2-AR activation, we detected a significant decrease in lpa3 expression (Fig. 5A), whereas in the β-AR knock-out mice, lpa3 did not show significant down-regulation after β2-AR agonist treatment (Fig. 5B), demonstrating that the observed down-regulation of lpa3 in wild-type uteri resulted from β2-AR activation. lpa3 is a gene encoding lysophosphatidic acid receptor 3, which has been previously shown to play critical roles in normal on-time and on-site implantation through COX-2-mediated PG productions (6Ye X. Hama K. Contos J.J. Anliker B. Inoue A. Skinner M.K. Suzuki H. Amano T. Kennedy G. Arai H. Aoki J. Chun J. Nature. 2005; 435: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). However, like the previously reported cPLA2-null mice, exogenous administration of PGs in Lpa3-null mice could only rescue aberrant implantation timing but not embryo spacing (6Ye X. Hama K. Contos J.J. Anliker B. Inoue A. Skinner M.K. Suzuki H. Amano T. Kennedy G. Arai H. Aoki J. Chun J. Nature. 2005; 435: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 7Song H. Lim H. Paria B.C.

Nature. 2005; 435: 34-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Recent evidence has demonstrated that LPA3 deletion-caused defects in implantation timing and embryo spacing were two independent events, and the Lpa3-null uterus indeed showed defects in stimulated muscular contraction (32Hama K. Aoki J. Inoue A. Endo T. Amano T. Motoki R. Kanai M. Ye X. Chun J. Matsuki N. Suzuki H. Shibasaki M. Arai H. Biol. Reprod. 2007; 77: 954-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), possibly linking with alternative pathway(s) (adrenergic signaling) that directly related to myometrium function. Indeed, there have been reports showing the cross-talk between LPA signaling and β2-AR function in other systems (33Shumay E. Tao J. Wang H.Y. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21529-21541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), suggesting potential interactions between these two G-protein-coupled receptor family-mediated pathways. Because LPA3 expression was reported to be primarily localized on uterine epithelium of day 4 pregnant mouse (6Ye X. Hama K. Contos J.J. Anliker B. Inoue A. Skinner M.K. Suzuki H. Amano T. Kennedy G. Arai H. Aoki J. Chun J. Nature. 2005; 435: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), it is still unclear how this molecule is linked with normal embryo spacing through muscular regulation (31Dey S.K. Nature. 2005; 435: 34-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), which might be due to potential interactions with β2-AR at the uterine epithelium. Nonetheless, the observed down-regulation of lpa3 after β2-AR activation provided functional clues for further insights into the regulation of uterine muscular function in the context of early pregnancy events. Together, the present study revealed an unexpected pathophysiological role of β2-AR activation in disrupting normal embryo spacing and its profound link to ongoing pregnancy. Previous investigations on β2-AR have been focused on the periparturition period because the administration of β2-AR agonist results in uterine relaxation, which could be utilized as an anti-parturition drug (34Berkman N.D. Thorp Jr., J.M. Lohr K.N. Carey T.S. Hartmann K.E. Gavin N.I. Hasselblad V. Idicula A.E. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 2003; 188: 1648-1659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported that β2-AR is the predominant AR subtype in murine oviducts and that disturbed β2-AR signaling resulted in aberrant oviductal embryo transport (35Wang H. Guo Y. Wang D. Kingsley P.J. Marnett L.J. Das S.K. DuBois R.N. Dey S.K. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Here we have expanded the understanding of the pathophysiological roles of β2-AR for normal intrauterine embryo distribution at preimplantation, which is regulated by classic cAMP-PKA activation and cross-talk with LPA3-mediated signaling. In murine and other polyovular species such as rabbit and pig, the intrauterine embryo distribution is characterized by an evenly spaced manner along the uterine horn (36Wimsatt W.A. Biol. Reprod. 1975; 12: 1-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), which seems to share evolutionarily conserved mechanisms. The phenomenon of regulated embryo spacing has long been the interest of reproductive scientists since its discovery (36Wimsatt W.A. Biol. Reprod. 1975; 12: 1-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, the past decades have only provided limited information regarding its underlying mechanisms, and the physiological significance of this phenomenon also remained underexplored. Recently, renewed interest of this topic has been raised from the discovery of two knock-out mice that showed disrupted embryo spacing at implantation. In the cPLA2- and Lpa3-null female, the timing of embryo implantation was shortly delayed beyond the normal implantation window, concomitantly with disrupted embryo spacing and reduced litter sizes (6Ye X. Hama K. Contos J.J. Anliker B. Inoue A. Skinner M.K. Suzuki H. Amano T. Kennedy G. Arai H. Aoki J. Chun J. Nature. 2005; 435: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 7Song H. Lim H. Paria B.C. Matsumoto H. Swift L.L. Morrow J. Bonventre J.V. Dey S.K. Development. 2002; 129: 2879-2889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The primary cause of compromised pregnancy in these knock-out mice has been attributed to aberrant timing of implantation due to the reduced level of prostaglandins in the preimplantation uteri, whereas the relative significance of intrauterine embryo distribution for pregnancy outcome has remained unsettled. In this study, our results demonstrated that without disturbing on-time implantation, the disrupted embryo spacing was enough to adversely affect embryo development and pregnancy outcome. This would raise the notion that the process of on-site intrauterine embryo distribution mediated by concerted uterine contraction, as an early preimplantation event, is critical for successful embryo implantation and ongoing pregnancy. Although the phenomenon of embryo distribution along uterine horns is unique to rodents with multiple implantation sites, the mechanism that controls embryo spacing in the rodents can also be responsible for proper embryo location within the uterus in single birth species including monkey (37Heuser C. Streeter G. Contrib. Embryo. 1941; 29: 15-55Google Scholar) and humans. In human beings, the normal embryo implantation site is largely restricted to the uterine fundus (38Bulletti C. de Ziegler D. Curr. Opin. Obstet. Gynecol. 2006; 18: 473-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Recently developed high resolution ultrasound has revealed that the preimplantation uterine activity involves well regulated kinetics such as wave-like movement from cervix to fundus, which is likely responsible for correct transportation of the embryo to the favored uterine compartment (38Bulletti C. de Ziegler D. Curr. Opin. Obstet. Gynecol. 2006; 18: 473-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Aberrant uterine movement would result in embryo implantation at unfavorable sites, which are prone to miscarriage or other pregnancy complications such as placenta previa or cornual pregnancy. Indeed, a recent finding has demonstrated that abnormal uterine peristalsis is directly linked with decreased pregnancy rates in humans (39Yoshino O. Hayashi T. Osuga Y. Orisaka M. Asada H. Okuda S. Hori M. Furuya M. Onuki H. Sadoshima Y. Hiroi H. Fujiwara T. Kotsuji F. Yoshimura Y. Nishii O. Taketani Y. Hum. Reprod. 2010; 25: 2475-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In addition, with the increasing application of in vitro fertilization pre-embryo transfer in the clinic, the vanishing twin syndrome has become an important clinical issue due to its high incidence and increased risks for postnatal abnormalities (40Pinborg A. Lidegaard O. Andersen A.N. Br. J. Hosp. Med. (Lond.). 2006; 67: 417-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). One cause of vanishing twin syndrome might be due to embryo crowding at implantation and subsequent resorption of one embryo as the result of competition for space and nutrient supply. There is growing epidemiological evidence that stress at early pregnancy serves as a risk factor for infertility and pregnancy complications, and stress can elevate concentrations of endogenous β2-AR ligands such as norepinephrine (41Ferry B. Roozendaal B. McGaugh J.L. Biol. Psychiatry. 1999; 46: 1140-1152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). It is an open but intriguing possibility that maternal stress at the time of embryo transfer and/or implantation may cause similar sympathetic activation of uterine β2-AR in humans, resulting in suboptimal embryo location and pregnancy complications. In our view, the present study raises the concept that normal uterine contraction-mediated on-site intrauterine embryo location is crucial for successful ongoing pregnancy. Our data also provided the first molecular and physiological clue as to how sympathetic activation at early pregnancy could adversely affect pregnancy outcome. Because both pharmacological silencing and genetic silencing of β2-AR are similarly efficient in controlling uterine contractility, our study provided β2-AR as a potential target in manipulating related uterine complications during early pregnancy.

Reduced inorganic sulfur compounds like hydrogen sulfide, sulfur, or thiosulfate are attractive prokaryotic energy sources, and their oxidation to sulfuric acid is one of the major reactions of the global sulfur cycle as shown for thiosulfate (Equation 1). S-SO32−+5H2O→2SO42−+8e−+10H+(Eq. 1) Oxidation of inorganic sulfur compounds to sulfate is mainly mediated by various specialized aerobic chemotrophic and anaerobic phototrophic prokaryotes, bacteria and archaea (1Frigaard N.U.

Two different modes for bacteria have been proposed recently; one as present in e.g. the anaerobic phototrophic sulfur oxidizing bacterium Allochromatium vinosum involves the reverse acting dissimilatory sulfite dehydrogenase (DsrAB) (Equation 2) which is with 13 other proteins encoded by the dsr operon (4Dahl C.

The sulfane-sulfur of the Cys-110-persulfide is the substrate for SoxCD that transfers oxygen atoms from water molecules to yield SoxY-Cys-110-S-sulfonate (Fig. 1). Finally, sulfate is hydrolyzed again by SoxB to regenerate SoxY and to complete the cycle. Besides thiosulfate, the Sox enzyme system also oxidizes hydrogen sulfide, sulfur, and sulfite. With thiosulfate the core system SoxYZ, SoxXA, and SoxB, i.e. the system without SoxCD, yields just 2 mol of electrons/mol of sulfur substrate (14Friedrich C.G. Quentmeier A. Bardischewsky F. Rother D. Kraft R. Kostka S. Prinz H. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4677-4687Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Also, the core system without SoxCD oxidizes thiosulfate at 25% the rate as compared with SoxCD. This material balance identified (i) the turnover number of the Sox system to be identical with and without SoxCD, and (ii) the molybdoprotein-cytochrome c complex SoxCD catalyzes a unique six-electron transfer reaction (Equation 2). Six electron-transfer reactions are rare in nature. The few examples are the reverse-acting sulfite reductase rDsrAB containing various [4Fe4S] centers (15Oliveira T.F. Vonrhein C. Matias P.M.

The core Sox system without SoxCD oxidizes sulfite, and this is the first example for a molybdoprotein-free sulfite oxidation (8Rother D. Henrich H.J. Quentmeier A. Bardischewsky F. Friedrich C.G. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4499-4508Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thus, SoxCD is catalytically distinct from sulfite dehydrogenases. However, the 26.5% identity with respect to the primary sequence of SoxC to the molybdoprotein SorA of the sulfite dehydrogenase SorAB of Starkeya novella (9Friedrich C.G. Rother D. Bardischewsky F. Quentmeier A. Fischer J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 2873-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) suggested a relation to sulfite dehydrogenase. Although the heme-1 domain of SoxD is conserved, the heme-2 domain is missing in some chemo- and phototrophic bacteria. Deletion of the heme-2 domain leads to a SoxCD1, which is identically active in the in vitro assay as SoxCD (7Bardischewsky F. Quentmeier A. Rother D. Hellwig P. Kostka S. Friedrich C.G.

Comparison of the SoxCD1 structure with SorAB and further related enzymes like chicken sulfite oxidase CSO (22Kisker C. Schindelin H. Pacheco A. Wehbi W.A. Garrett R.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Enemark J.H. Rees D.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) highlights structural similarities as these molybdoenzymes have in common their catalysis of hydroxylation reactions with a sulfur atom as substrate coupled with dehydrogenation. SoxCD, however, differs significantly from these enzymes as (i) SoxCD performs a six-electron transfer reaction instead of a two-electron transfer reaction, and (ii) its sulfur substrate is covalently bound to a sulfur carrier protein (SoxYZ). The structure enables further insight into the common features and determinants for the electron transfer between the molybdenum and heme prosthetic group. Because a six-electron transfer of a molybdoenzyme within one enzymatic conversion is so far unique, SoxCD will be of broader interest for enzymology and protein chemistry. SoxCD from P. pantotrophus is a complex of the molybdenum containing protein SoxC, and the di-heme c-type cytochrome protein SoxD. SoxCD1 is the construct in which the second heme-2 domain of SoxD is deleted (7Bardischewsky F. Quentmeier A. Rother D. Hellwig P. Kostka S. Friedrich C.G. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7024-7034Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The SoxCD1 complex was purified from P. pantotrophus strain GB17 as described previously (2Friedrich C.G. Bardischewsky F. Rother D. Quentmeier A. Fischer J. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 23Quentmeier A. Kraft R. Kostka S. Klockenkämper R. Friedrich C.G. Arch. Microbiol. 2000; 173: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). SoxCD1 was enriched from the cell extract by differential centrifugation and ammonium sulfate fractionation. Soluble proteins precipitated between 44 and 65% ammonium sulfate saturation were redissolved and purified to homogeneity involving anion exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose, gel filtration on Sephadex G-200, and anion exchange on Resource Q. The activity of the SoxCD1 complex was examined from the reconstituted thiosulfate-oxidizing enzyme system using horse heart cytochrome c as final electron acceptor as described before (23Quentmeier A. Kraft R. Kostka S. Klockenkämper R. Friedrich C.G. Arch. Microbiol. 2000; 173: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Crystallization experiments were carried out using the hanging-drop method at room temperature. SoxCD1 crystals were prepared by mixing equal amounts of protein- and reservoir solution (4% (w/v) MPEG 5000, 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 20 mm calcium acetate, and 10 mm Co(III)-hexamine chloride), and the drops were equilibrated against the reservoir solution. Rod-shaped crystals appeared within 5–10 days and diffracted x-rays beyond 1.5 Å resolution. The crystals belonged to a trigonal space group with cell dimensions a = 123 Å and c = 76 Å. Before data collection the crystals were cryo-protected in a solution containing 4% (w/v) MPEG 5000, 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 20 mm calcium acetate, 10 mm Co(III)-hexamine chloride, and 10% (v/v) glycerol and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. X-ray data were collected on beamline ID23-1 (24Nurizzo D. Mairs T. Guijarro M. Rey V. Meyer J. Fajardo P. Chavanne J. Biasci J.C. McSweeney S. Mitchell E. J. Synchrotron Radiat. 2006; 13: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France. To obtain experimental phases, a data set was collected at the K-edge of iron. The data set was indexed, integrated, and scaled using the XDS package (25Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. D. 2010; 66: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). The structure was solved using the SAD protocol of Auto-Rickshaw, the EMBL-Hamburg automated crystal structure determination platform (26Panjikar S. Parthasarathy V. Lamzin V.S. Weiss M.S. Tucker P.A. Acta Crystallogr. D. 2005; 61: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The input diffraction data were prepared and converted for use in Auto-Rickshaw using programs of the CCP4 suite (27CCP4 Acta Crystallogr. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Structure factors were calculated using the program SHELXC (28Sheldrick G.M. Hauptman H.A. Weeks C.M. Miller R. Uson I. International Tables for Crystallography. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2001: 333-345Google Scholar). Based on an initial analysis of the data, the maximum resolution for substructure determination and initial phase calculation was set to 3.2 Å. All of the heavy atoms requested were found using the program SHELXD (29Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. D. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar). The correct enantiomorph space group for the substructure was determined using the programs ABS (30Hao Q. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2004; 37: 498-499Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and SHELXE (31Sheldrick G.M. Z. Kristallogr. 2002; 217: 644-650Crossref Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Initial phases were calculated after density modification using the program SHELXE (31Sheldrick G.M. Z. Kristallogr. 2002; 217: 644-650Crossref Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry operator was found using the program RESOLVE (32Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. D. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). Density modification, phase extension to 2.4 Å, and non-crystallographic symmetry averaging was performed using the program DM (33Cowtan K.D. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1996; 52: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). At this stage, around one-third of the protein complex was built using the program ARP/wARP (34Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar, 35Morris R.J. Perrakis A. Lamzin V.S. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 229-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). This model together with sequence information was used as a starting model for the subsequent MRSAD (SAD combined with molecular replacement) protocol of Auto-Rickshaw (36Panjikar S. Parthasarathy V. Lamzin V.S. Weiss M.S. Tucker P.A. Acta Crystallogr. D. 2009; 65: 1089-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The resulting electron density map was improved further by density modification using DM (33Cowtan K.D. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1996; 52: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The resulting phases together with the SoxCD sequence were used as input for model building with PHENIX autobuild (37Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G. Chen V.B. Davis I.W. Echols N. Headd J.J.

D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar), the water molecules were manually removed from the Phenix-generated autobuild model. This resulted in the first SoxCD1 model at 2.4 Å. A high resolution data set was collected from a second crystal up to a resolution of 1.33 Å. After integration using XDS, the data were scaled by XSCALE and converted into CCP4 format using XDSCONV keeping the same reflections marked for Rfree assignment as in the SAD dataset. The amplitudes from the high resolution data set and phases calculated from the 2.4 Å model were used as input for ARP/wARP (35Morris R.J. Perrakis A. Lamzin V.S. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 229-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), also providing the SoxCD sequence. The resulting model was examined, cofactors were built, and water molecules were added using Coot (39Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar) followed by refinement using REFMAC5 until no further interpretable features in the electron density map were visible. The refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. Final model analysis, imaging, and ray tracing were performed using the program PyMOL (40DeLano W.L. Drug Discov. Today. 2005; 10: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The search for structurally related proteins in the protein data bank (PDB (41Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G.

Open table in a new tab The structure represents the SoxCD1 construct in which the heme-2 domain has been deleted on the cDNA level, as it was observed that only the first heme domain is essential for sulfur oxidation activity (7Bardischewsky F. Quentmeier A. Rother D. Hellwig P. Kostka S. Friedrich C.G. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7024-7034Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As determined by analytical size exclusion chromatography and multiple angle laser light scattering, SoxCD1 forms a heterotetrameric complex of around 130 kDa (2 × 43.9-kDa SoxC and 2 × 24.1-kDa SoxD1) (data not shown). The crystal structure of SoxCD1 resembles a tight α2β2 complex with internal 2-fold symmetry. It is composed of two molybdenum-containing SoxC domains forming the core of the complex and two heme-containing SoxD1 domains sitting at the exterior of the complex (Fig. 2). The two SoxD1 subunits are positioned at the edge of the SoxC dimer and do not contact each other. The C-terminal peptide of the SoxD1 subunit displays an extended loop with two short α-helical and one short β-stranded conformation that embraces its closest SoxC subunit. SoxD1 represents a cytochrome-c-like-fold with 8 helices and 5 strands. SoxC contains 6 α-helices and 23 β-strands organized in five β-sheets with the molybdenum binding site in the center and a C-terminal immunoglobulin-like fold. The two SoxC subunits of the tetramer form a large interior interface (3939.3 Å2 interface area, determined using SURFNET (43Laskowski R.A. J. Mol. Graph. 1995; 13: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar)) in a head-to-tail arrangement. The N-terminal part of SoxC (residues 42 to 75) builds additional contacts with its non-crystallographic symmetry mate (Fig. 2). Due to the high resolution of the final electron density map, the type of the molybdenum-containing prosthetic group (Fig. 3A) could be unambiguously identified as the sulfite oxidase-type molybdenum cofactor (44Hille R.

As proposed in the literature (45Schwarz G. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 2792-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), the molybdenum-containing prosthetic group will be subsequently referred to as molybdenum cofactor. Molybdenum cofactor binding domains are highly similar in their central architecture and form a distinct family (48Wootton J.C. Nicolson R.E. Cock J.M. Walters D.E. Burke J.F. Doyle W.A. Bray R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1057: 157-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Eight residues are highly conserved and function as a coordination sphere (Fig. 5 and supplemental Table 1). Among these eight residues, one cysteine residue (Cys-160 in SoxC) is found in all molybdenum cofactor-containing structures as one ligand for the molybdenum ion (Figs. 4A and 5). The molybdenum ion in SoxC displays a distorted square pyramidal coordination geometry where two thiolates from the molybdopterin heterocycle, the thiol group from cysteine residue Cys-160, and one water/hydroxyl oxygen are the equatorial ligands, and the terminal oxo group occupies the axial position (Fig. 3A and 5).

https://openalex.org/W2087436338,"The hexameric AAA-ATPase, Cdc48p, catalyzes an array of cellular activities, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD), ER/Golgi membrane dynamics, and DNA replication. Accumulating data suggest that unique Cdc48p partners, such as Npl4p-Ufd1p and Ubx1p/Shp1p (p47 in vertebrates), target Cdc48p for these diverse functions. Other Cdc48p-associated proteins have been identified, but the interplay among these factors and their activities is largely cryptic. We now report on a previously uncharacterized Cdc48p-associated protein, Ydr049p, also known as Vms1p, which binds Cdc48p at both the ER membrane and in the cytosol under non-stressed conditions. Loss of YDR049 modestly slows the degradation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator but does not impede substrate ubiquitination, suggesting that Ydr049p acts at a postubiquitination step in the ERAD pathway. Consistent with Ydr049p playing a role in Cdc48p substrate release, ydr049 mutant cells accumulate Cdc48p-bound ubiquitinated proteins at the ER membrane. Moreover, YDR049 interacts with genes encoding select UBX (ubiquitin regulatory X) and UFD (ubiquitin fusion degradation) proteins, which are Cdc48p partners. Exacerbated growth defects are apparent in some of the mutant combinations, and synergistic effects on the degradation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and CPY*, which is a soluble ERAD substrate, are evident in specific ydr049-ufd and -ubx mutants. These data suggest that Ydr049p acts in parallel with Cdc48p partners to modulate ERAD and other cellular activities."
https://openalex.org/W2092872199,"Free fatty acid (FFA) transport across the cardiomyocyte plasma membrane is essential to proper cardiac function, but the role of membrane proteins and FFA metabolism in FFA transport remains unclear. Metabolism is thought to maintain intracellular FFA at low levels, providing the driving force for FFA transport, but intracellular FFA levels have not been measured directly. We report the first measurements of the intracellular unbound FFA concentrations (FFA(i)) in cardiomyocytes. The fluorescent indicator of FFA, ADIFAB (acrylodan-labeled rat intestinal fatty acid-binding protein), was microinjected into isolated cardiomyocytes from wild type (WT) and FAT/CD36 null C57B1/6 mice. Quantitative imaging of ADIFAB fluorescence revealed the time courses of FFA influx and efflux. For WT mice, rate constants for efflux (∼0.02 s(-1)) were twice influx, and steady state FFA(i) were more than 3-fold larger than extracellular unbound FFA (FFA(o)). The concentration gradient and the initial rate of FFA influx saturated with increasing FFA(o). Similar characteristics were observed for oleate, palmitate, and arachidonate. FAT/CD36 null cells revealed similar characteristics, except that efflux was 2-3-fold slower than WT cells. Rate constants determined with intracellular ADIFAB were confirmed by measurements of intracellular pH. FFA uptake by suspensions of cardiomyocytes determined by monitoring FFA(o) using extracellular ADIFAB confirmed the influx rate constants determined from FFA(i) measurements and demonstrated that rates of FFA transport and etomoxir-sensitive metabolism are regulated independently. We conclude that FFA influx in cardiac myocytes is mediated by a membrane pump whose transport rate constants may be modulated by FAT/CD36."
https://openalex.org/W2073878770,"The xeroderma pigmentosum group A protein (XPA) is a core component of nucleotide excision repair (NER). To coordinate early stage NER, XPA interacts with various proteins, including replication protein A (RPA), ERCC1, DDB2, and TFIIH, in addition to UV-damaged or chemical carcinogen-damaged DNA. In this study, we investigated the effects of mutations in the RPA binding regions of XPA on XPA function in NER. XPA binds through an N-terminal region to the middle subunit (RPA32) of the RPA heterotrimer and through a central region that overlaps with its damaged DNA binding region to the RPA70 subunit. In cell-free NER assays, an N-terminal deletion mutant of XPA showed loss of binding to RPA32 and reduced DNA repair activity, but it could still bind to UV-damaged DNA and RPA. In contrast, amino acid substitutions in the central region reduced incisions at the damaged site in the cell-free NER assay, and four of these mutants (K141A, T142A, K167A, and K179A) showed reduced binding to RPA70 but normal binding to damaged DNA. Furthermore, mutants that had one of the four aforementioned substitutions and an N-terminal deletion exhibited lower DNA incision activity and binding to RPA than XPA with only one of these substitutions or the deletion. Taken together, these results indicate that XPA interaction with both RPA32 and RPA70 is indispensable for NER reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2024815454,"In unstressed cells, the p53 tumor suppressor is highly unstable. DNA damage and other forms of cellular stress rapidly stabilize and activate p53. This process is regulated by a complex array of post-translational modifications that are dynamically deposited onto p53. Recent studies show that these modifications orchestrate p53-mediated processes such as cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Cancer cells carry inherent genetic damage, but avoid arrest and apoptosis by inactivating p53. Defining the enzymatic machinery that regulates the stress-induced modification of p53 at single-residue resolution is critical to our understanding of the biochemical mechanisms that control this critical tumor suppressor. Specifically, acetylation of p53 at lysine 120, a DNA-binding domain residue mutated in human cancer, is essential for triggering apoptosis. Given the oncogenic properties of deacetylases and the success of deacetylase inhibitors as anticancer agents, we investigated the regulation of Lys120 deacetylation using pharmacologic and genetic approaches. This analysis revealed that histone deacetylase 1 is predominantly responsible for the deacetylation of Lys120. Furthermore, treatment with the clinical-grade histone deacetylase inhibitor entinostat enhances Lys120 acetylation, an event that is mechanistically linked to its apoptotic effect. These data expand our understanding of the mechanisms controlling p53 function and suggest that regulation of p53 modification status at single-residue resolution by targeted therapeutics can selectively alter p53 pathway function.

https://openalex.org/W2063787654,"Yeast cells begin to bud and enter the S phase when growth conditions are favorable during the G(1) phase. When subjected to some oxidative stresses, cells delay entry at G(1), allowing repair of cellular damage. Hence, oxidative stress sensing is coordinated with the regulation of cell cycle. We identified a novel function of the cell cycle regulator of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Swi6p, as a redox sensor through its cysteine residue at position 404. When alanine was substituted at this position, the resultant mutant, C404A, was sensitive to several reactive oxygen species and oxidants including linoleic acid hydroperoxide, the superoxide anion, and diamide. This mutant lost the ability to arrest in G(1) phase upon treatment with lipid hydroperoxide. The Cys-404 residue of Swi6p in wild-type cells was oxidized to a sulfenic acid when cells were subjected to linoleic acid hydroperoxide. Mutation of Cys-404 to Ala abolished the down-regulation of expression of the G(1) cyclin genes CLN1, CLN2, PCL1, and PCL2 that occurred when cells of the wild type were exposed to the lipid hydroperoxide. In conclusion, oxidative stress signaling for cell cycle regulation occurs through oxidation of the G(1)/S-specific transcription factor Swi6p and consequently leads to suppression of the expression of G(1) cyclins and a delay in cells entering the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2039918551,"Eukaryotic cell cycle progression is mediated by phosphorylation of protein substrates by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). A critical substrate of CDKs is the product of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene, pRb, which inhibits G(1)-S phase cell cycle progression by binding and repressing E2F transcription factors. CDK-mediated phosphorylation of pRb alleviates this inhibitory effect to promote G(1)-S phase cell cycle progression. pRb represses transcription by binding to the E2F transactivation domain and recruiting the mSin3·histone deacetylase (HDAC) transcriptional repressor complex via the retinoblastoma-binding protein 1 (RBP1). RBP1 binds to the pocket region of pRb via an LXCXE motif and to the SAP30 subunit of the mSin3·HDAC complex and, thus, acts as a bridging protein in this multisubunit complex. In the present study we identified RBP1 as a novel CDK substrate. RBP1 is phosphorylated by CDK2 on serines 864 and 1007, which are N- and C-terminal to the LXCXE motif, respectively. CDK2-mediated phosphorylation of RBP1 or pRb destabilizes their interaction in vitro, with concurrent phosphorylation of both proteins leading to their dissociation. Consistent with these findings, RBP1 phosphorylation is increased during progression from G(1) into S-phase, with a concurrent decrease in its association with pRb in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. These studies provide new mechanistic insights into CDK-mediated regulation of the pRb tumor suppressor during cell cycle progression, demonstrating that CDK-mediated phosphorylation of both RBP1 and pRb induces their dissociation to mediate release of the mSin3·HDAC transcriptional repressor complex from pRb to alleviate transcriptional repression of E2F."
https://openalex.org/W2086876220,"Substrate inhibition by ATP is a regulatory feature of the phosphofructokinases isoenzymes from Escherichia coli (Pfk-1 and Pfk-2). Under gluconeogenic conditions, the loss of this regulation in Pfk-2 causes substrate cycling of fructose-6-phosphate (fructose-6-P) and futile consumption of ATP delaying growth. In the present work, we have broached the mechanism of ATP-induced inhibition of Pfk-2 from both structural and kinetic perspectives. The crystal structure of Pfk-2 in complex with fructose-6-P is reported to a resolution of 2 Å. The comparison of this structure with the previously reported inhibited form of the enzyme suggests a negative interplay between fructose-6-P binding and allosteric binding of MgATP. Initial velocity experiments show a linear increase of the apparent K0.5 for fructose-6-P and a decrease in the apparent kcat as a function of MgATP concentration. These effects occur simultaneously with the induction of a sigmoidal kinetic behavior (nH of approximately 2). Differences and resemblances in the patterns of fructose-6-P binding and the mechanism of inhibition are discussed for Pfk-1 and Pfk-2, as an example of evolutionary convergence, because these enzymes do not share a common ancestor.

IntroductionIn Escherichia coli, the glycolytic step of the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of fructose-6-P is catalyzed by two different phosphofructokinases, Pfk-1 and Pfk-2. Kinetic evidence indicates that these enzymes are subject to regulation by high concentrations of ATP (1Atkinson D.E. Walton G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 757-763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kotlarz D. Buc H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 117: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It has been elegantly demonstrated for Pfk-2 that this regulation is important for avoiding a futile cycle of ATP hydrolysis under gluconeogenic conditions (3Torres J.C. Guixé V. Babul J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 675-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Because Pfk-1 and Pfk-2 do not share a common ancestor, they pose an intriguing case of convergence in the evolution of kinases because not only do they recognize the same phosphoryl acceptor substrate, but also each has independently evolved a mechanism for inhibition by the phosphoryl donor ATP.Pfk-2 belongs to the ribokinase family of sugar kinases. Other phosphorylated sugars are recognized as substrates by members of the family such as tagatose-6-phosphate kinases and 1-phosphofructokinases, which form a monophyletic cluster with Pfk-2 (4Cabrera R. Babul J. Guixé V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2010; 502: 22-30Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Within this group (the PfkB subfamily), inhibition of the enzymatic activity by MgATP has so far only been reported for Pfk-2. The kinetic mechanism of Pfk-2 has been characterized to consist of an ordered sequential addition of substrates where fructose-6-P binding to the active site is required for the catalytic binding of MgATP. However, it has been observed that, in the absence of fructose-6-P, MgATP is able to shift the state of aggregation of Pfk-2 from dimer to tetramer, leading to the proposal of an allosteric site for this nucleotide (2Kotlarz D. Buc H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 117: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Recently (5Cabrera R. Ambrosio A.L. Garratt R.C. Guixé V. Babul J. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 383: 588-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), our group reported the crystal structure of Pfk-2 in its tetrameric form bound to two ATP molecules and two Mg ions per monomer (the Pfk-2·(ATP)2 complex). One ATP corresponds to the phosphoryl donor substrate of the reaction and shows a singular interaction with a second ATP, which, we conclude, must be acting as the enzyme inhibitor.For Pfk-1, several mechanisms have been discussed in an attempt to explain the kinetics of substrate inhibition. Wang and Kemp (6Wang X. Kemp R.G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3938-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) proposed that ATP inhibition results from substrate antagonism coupled with a steady-state random mechanism wherein the high rate of catalysis does not permit equilibration of the binding of the substrates.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9237-9242Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) proposed a model based on the displacement of a pre-existing R-T equilibrium by means of the presence of an allosteric site for MgATP. According to this model fructose-6-P 2The abbreviation used is: fructose-6-P or F6Pfructose-6-phosphate. binds preferentially to the relaxed state “R,” which predominates in the absence of MgATP. Large concentrations of MgATP shift the population toward the T state, which presents a very low affinity for fructose-6-P. Both mechanisms have been challenged by Reinhart's group using the principle of allosteric linkage (9Wyman J. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 11: 631-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 10Weber G. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 864-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). According to their proposal, MgATP inhibition is originated by the allosteric communication between the active sites of the homotetrameric enzyme. Substrate binding antagonism is manifested when MgATP in the active site of one subunit acts to lower the affinity for fructose-6-P in the active site of another subunit (11Johnson J.L. Reinhart G.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11510-11518Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Fenton and Reinhart (12Fenton A.W. Reinhart G.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12676-12681Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) demonstrated through the use of hybrid oligomers that a tetramer of Pfk-1 with only one functional active site is unable to show substrate inhibition, highlighting the importance of intersubunit interactions for the regulatory mechanism of the enzyme. The crystal structure of Pfk-1 from E. coli in complex with its products, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate and MgADP, was solved by Shirakihara and Evans (13Shirakihara Y. Evans P.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 973-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Each subunit contributes with complementary parts of two active sites and two allosteric sites, being the complete tetramer required to form all eight sites. The allosteric site in Pfk-1 is not involved in the MgATP inhibition but rather binds other effectors such as ADP and GDP as activators and P-enolpyruvate as an inhibitor. At the active site, the fructose-1,6-bisphosphate molecule is bound mainly by polar groups, and its 6-phosphoryl group is held by two arginine residues that belong to a neighboring subunit.In the case of Pfk-2, inhibition occurs at low concentrations of fructose-6-P and high concentrations of MgATP (2Kotlarz D.

Although the increment of the fructose-6-P concentration decreases the inhibitory effect of MgATP, no kinetic mechanism has been proposed to model this phenomenon. A mutant Pfk-2 in which Tyr-23 has been replaced by Asp at the allosteric site ablates a crucial interaction with the adenine moiety of the inhibitor ATP, leading to a highly decreased inhibitory effect (5Cabrera R.

We compared this structure with the Pfk-2·(ATP)2 complex searching for insights into the conformational changes that originate substrate inhibition. Furthermore, a kinetic characterization of the ATP-induced inhibition is presented. The initial velocities, as a function of the concentration of fructose-6-P and MgATP (within noninhibitory and inhibitory ranges), were adjusted to different conceivable mechanisms by means of global fitting. A complex behavior was observed that may involve intersubunit active site communication.

To search for and define an interior ligand migration trajectory, we chose to use the neuronal mini-hemoglobin from Cerebratulus lacteus as a model globin system to examine its long apolar tunnel that leads from the distal portion of the heme pocket to an exit point between the C-terminal regions of the E and H helices of the tertiary fold, a pathway that is roughly 180° opposite the E7 channel and appears to be a major route for ligand entry (2Salter M.D. Nienhaus K.

Among these, the nerve Hb from the nemertean worm C. lacteus (CerHb) is the smallest functional globin known, being composed of 109 amino acids instead of the ∼140–160 residues typical of most monomeric globins (4Bolognesi M.

Analysis of the three-dimensional structure of CerHb has shown a markedly edited 3-over-3-globin fold with deletion of the N-terminal A-helix, extension of the GH region, and reduction of the C-terminal H-helix (6Pesce A.

Both sequence and fold comparisons indicate that CerHb is equally distant from all known globins, suggesting a specific mini-Hb family within the Hb superfamily. The affinity of CerHb for O2 is very similar to that of mammalian Mbs, and its function appears to be O2 storage and then release to axons and brain tissue during periods of burrowing under anoxic conditions (5Vandergon T.L.

The evolution of a storage function in a highly altered globin structure has made CerHb an excellent model for testing biophysical mechanisms involved in the regulation of O2 affinity and reaction rates (2Salter M.D. Nienhaus K.

Several distinct structural features make CerHb of interest for understanding structure-function relationships. First, the distal portion of the heme pocket contains Tyr-11(B10) and Gln-44(E7), which stabilize heme-bound O2 by hydrogen bonding in many invertebrate globins with high O2 affinity (11Draghi F. Miele A.E. Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Vallone B. Brunori M. Gibson Q.H. Olson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7509-7519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, unlike most of the globins containing this Tyr-Gln motif, CerHb also contains a polar Thr-48 residue at the E11 position, which in most globins is Val, Leu, Ile, or Phe. In CerHb, the non-bonded electrons of the Thr-48(E11) Oγ atom “pull” the proton on the Tyr-11(B10) hydroxyl group away from heme-bound O2, causing marked 1000- to 100-fold increases in the rate and equilibrium constants for O2 dissociation, respectively (6Pesce A.

The second unusual structural feature of CerHb is a long apolar tunnel that connects the heme pocket to solvent through an exit pore between the C-terminal ends of the E and H helices. This tunnel is correlated with an unusually large association rate constant for O2 binding to CerHb (k′O2 = 230 μm−1s−1) when compared with those of other invertebrate globins containing the Tyr-Gln active site motif, which normally show bimolecular association rate constants on the order of 1–5 μm−1s−1 (11Draghi F.

The cause of these high rates appears to be a wide, ∼10 Å long channel that traverses the interior of the globin matrix, allowing relatively unhindered access to the heme pocket. The CerHb tunnel has roughly the shape of an hourglass, is located between the E- and H-helices, is directed from the solvent to the heme pocket, and terminates at the active site as an aperture, which is circumscribed by the side chains of Val-7(B6), Phe-10(B9), and Thr-48(E11). This channel is lined by small hydrophobic residues and has a diameter that varies from 6.9 to 5.5 Å at the narrowest segment, which is close to residue Leu-86(G12) (6Pesce A. Nardini M. Dewilde S. Geuens E. Yamauchi K. Ascenzi P. Riggs A.F. Moens L. Bolognesi M. Structure. 2002; 10: 725-735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Diatomic ligands are thought to enter and exit the tunnel through an opening between the E and H helix, which appears to have evolved by the complete loss of the N-terminal A-helix that is found in almost all other globins. Obstructing the tunnel entrance by increasing the size of Ala-55(E18) to Phe or Trp causes an ∼4-fold decrease of both k′O2 and kO2 and a 5-fold increase in the fraction of geminate recombination due to restriction of both entry into and escape from the apolar channel (2Salter M.D. Nienhaus K.

In contrast, mutagenesis of Gln-44(E7) to either smaller or larger amino acids has little effect on internal rebinding after photolysis or bimolecular binding from solvent, suggesting strongly that the E7 gate for ligand entry/exit found in mammalian Hbs and Mbs (13Scott E.E.

Apolar cavities and tunnel systems that could support ligand diffusion to and from the heme have been observed in selected globin families, although relative to CerHb, some of these channels are structurally and topologically distinct within the overall tertiary fold (15de Sanctis D.

However, in most cases there has been little experimental proof that these tunnels are used by diatomic ligands. Cavities large enough to accommodate xenon atoms have been found in most globins, including sperm whale Mb and Scapharca inaequivalvis HbI; however, in both of the latter cases, xenon binding has little effect on either the fraction of geminate recombination or on overall rates of ligand binding or release (13Scott E.E.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11909-11917Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), implying that these internal spaces are not part of the route for ligand entry and escape. In this work we have focused our attention on providing both direct experimental and theoretical evidence for ligand access to the heme pocket through the tunnel in CerHb and estimates of what fraction of the ligands use this route versus the E7 gate pathway, which dominates in mammalian Mbs and Hbs that contain a distal histidine. We have shown that xenon atoms can be accommodated within the CerHb tunnel by x-ray crystallography, examined the effects of xenon binding on CO geminate recombination, measured the effects of changing the width of the channel with Leu-86(G12) to Ala, Phe, and Trp mutations, and complemented these experiments with molecular dynamics simulations of how Leu-86 mutations modulate the tunnel shape, size, and energy barriers to ligand migration. Our results demonstrate that there is a strong correlation between tunnel size and observed rates of ligand binding to CerHb. More importantly, CerHb is the first example of a globin in which xenon binding markedly increases geminate recombination and slows bimolecular ligand entry. Wild-type (wt) and mutant recombinant CerHbs were expressed and purified as described previously using a synthetic gene with codon usage optimized for expression in Escherichia coli (6Pesce A.

When necessary, the unstable mutants were pre-reduced with dithionite, quickly passed through a Sephadex G-25 column, and eluted with buffer equilibrated with 1 atm of CO. All reactions were measured in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 1.0 mm EDTA, 20 °C. CO association time courses were measured after complete laser photolysis of 50 μm CerHbCO samples containing various CO concentrations under pseudo first order conditions, and CO dissociation was measured by mixing CerHbCO with high concentrations of NO (2Salter M.D. Nienhaus K.

For experiments with xenon, a 0.3-ml sample of CerHbCO was transferred to a stainless steel pressure cell with a gas volume of ∼4 ml. The cell was equipped with anti-reflection-coated sapphire windows and had a path length of 1 mm as previously described (19Scott E.E. Gibson Q.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11909-11917Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Data were first collected with 1 atm CO over the sample, and then the required pressure of xenon was introduced through a three-way valve attached to the top of the cuvette. The sample was then equilibrated with the CO-xenon mixture for several minutes by shaking the cuvette to expose the solution to the gas space. The fraction of geminate recombination (Fgem) and the rate of geminate recombination (kgem) were determined as previously described (2Salter M.D. Nienhaus K. Nienhaus G.U. Dewilde S. Moens L.

Elongated prismatic crystals (about 0.05 × 0.05 × 0.2 mm3) grew within 1 week.

L86A CerHbO2 crystals are isomorphous with those of the wt protein. High resolution data (1.60 Å) on the L86A CerHb mutant crystals were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (beam line ID14-1, Grenoble, France) (Table 1). To promote xenon diffusion within the protein matrix, selected L86A CerHbO2 crystals in their cryoprotectant solution were exposed to 10 bar xenon for 5 min in a high pressure chamber (Xcell, Oxford Cryo-system).

Xenon atoms were initially refined at 100% occupancy together with the protein structure. At the end of refinement, inspection of difference Fourier maps indicated that the xenon occupancies were overestimated. To obtain better values, the fractional occupancies were systematically decreased until no residual difference signal was detected. The relevant data collection and refinement statistics are reported in Table 1. The programs Procheck (26Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl.

Atomic coordinates and structure factors for the L86A CerHbO2, xenon-bound L86A CerHbO2, and wt aquomet CerHb have been deposited with PDB accession codes 2xkg, 2xkh, and 2xki, respectively (28Berman H.M.

All systems were solvated with water molecules leaving 10 Å between the protein surface and the system limit. Histidine protonation was assigned to favor H-bond formation. All simulations were performed with the parmm99 force field (29Wang J. Cieplak P. Kollman P.A. J. Comput. Chem. 2000; 21: 1049-1074Crossref Scopus (3508) Google Scholar) using Amber8 (30Pearlman D.A.

The equilibration process was performed by slowly heating the system to a final temperature of 298 K. The oxygenated and deoxygenated heme model system charges were determined by using restrained electrostatic potential charges (31Bayly C.I. Cieplak P. Cornell W. Kollman P.A. J. Phys.

Biochem. 2006; 100: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To study the properties of the wt CerHb tunnel cavity system, the diffusion free energy profiles for O2 along the tunnels were calculated by performing constant velocity MSMD simulations using the Jarzynski inequality (33Jarzynski C. Phys. Rev. Lett. 1997; 78: 2690-2693Crossref Scopus (3631) Google Scholar), which relates equilibrium free energy values with the irreversible work performed over the system and proceeds along a reaction coordinate from reactants to products. In the present study the reaction coordinate was chosen as the iron to O2 distance. Calculations were performed using a force constant of 200 kcal mol−1 Å−1 and a pulling velocity of 0.05 Å ps−1. To reconstruct the free energy profile of ligand migration along the tunnel, a set of MSMD runs was performed starting from equilibrated MD structures with the ligand (i) in the distal pocket, (ii) in the crystallographic xenon-binding sites, and (iii) outside the tunnel. Ten MSMD simulations were performed in each direction (forward/exit and backward/entry). In cases in which two overlapping profiles were obtained (from entry and exit sets), we confirmed that they matched. The free energy profiles for the transition between the in and out conformations of Gln-44(E7) were obtained with Umbrella Sampling techniques (34Leach A.R. Molecular Modelling Principles and Applications. 2nd Ed. Pearson Education Limited, Edinburgh Gate, England2001: 581-582Google Scholar). In this method the potential function is modified so that the unfavorable states are sampled sufficiently. The modification of the potential function can be written by adding a bias harmonic potential according to E′(r) = E(r) + k(r − ξ)2, where E(r) is the potential energy of the protein for a given configuration r (i.e. the force field equation), and k is the force constant. The harmonic potential is centered at some point along the reaction coordinate (ξ). The corresponding profile was computed using the Gln-44(E7) Nϵ2-iron distance as the selected reaction coordinate, and 12 different 2-ns runs were performed varying the center of the harmonic potential along the reaction coordinate. In-silico L86A, L86F, and L86W mutant structures were generated using the Modeler program (35Martí-Renom M.A. Stuart A.C. Fiser A. Sánchez R. Melo F. Sali A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

https://openalex.org/W2019847265,"The Golgi apparatus undergoes extensive fragmentation during apoptosis due in part to caspase-mediated cleavage of its structural proteins. Significantly, the Golgi-vesicle-tethering protein p115 is cleaved at Asp(757) early during apoptosis and the nuclear translocation of its 205 amino acid C-terminal fragment (CTF) precedes observable Golgi fragmentation. Nuclear localization of the p115 CTF induces apoptosis. The regulation of CTF nuclear translocation and the mechanism of its apoptotic activity however, remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that nuclear translocation of the CTF is regulated by SUMOylation. CTF-induced apoptosis is transcription dependent and mediated by the tumor suppressor, p53. Expression of the CTF led to the phosphorylation and stabilization of p53 and results in the expression of PUMA, a pro-apoptotic target of p53. CTF-induced stabilization of p53 is sensitive to the MEK/ERK inhibitor U0126. Co-immunoprecipitation studies indicate that the p115 CTF can bind to both p53 and ERK1. The CTF is also able to form dimers and its dimerization is dependent on residues 859-884, previously determined to be required for apoptosis. Indeed, CTF expression promotes p53-ERK interaction, which is diminished upon deletion of residues 859-884. Together, our results indicate a conserved tethering function of the Golgi protein p115 CTF which promotes p53-ERK interaction for the amplification of the apoptotic signal."
https://openalex.org/W2009074251,"The stability of p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, is highly regulated by various protein molecules through the cell cycle and in response to extracellular signals. One of the p21 regulators is MDMX, which can directly bind to p21 and mediate its proteasomal degradation in an ubiquitination-independent fashion. The fact that 14-3-3γ binds to the MDMX domain adjacent to p21 binding suggests that this 14-3-3γ may affect MDMX-mediated p21 proteasomal turnover. Indeed, we found that overexpression of 14-3-3γ increased the level of both endogenous and exogenous p21 in p53-null cells by extending its half-life, leading to p21-dependent G1 arrest. Also, 14-3-3γ excluded p21 from binding to MDMX in a dose-dependent manner as determined by co-immunroprecipitation in vitro using purified proteins and in cells. In response to DNA damage, the level of the 14-3-3γ-MDMX complex increased whereas that of the MDMX-p21 complex declined as detected by co-immunoprecipitation assays, leading to the induction of p21 in p53-null cells. Knockdown of 14-3-3γ inversely alleviated the induction of p21 levels by DNA damage. Hence, our study as presented here unravels a new role for 14-3-3γ in protecting p21 from MDMX-mediated proteasomal turnover, which may partially account for DNA damage-induced elevation of p21 levels independent of p53."

Early diagnosis ensures inexpensive and effective treatment and prevents stunted growth and developmental disabilities in children and bladder cancer or other organ damage in adults (3). But the standard method of detecting the disease, microscopic identification of eggs in urine or stool, requires patients to visit a hospital laboratory, something not practical for many people living in rural Ghana."
https://openalex.org/W1967242578,"Serine-threonine kinase receptor-associated protein (STRAP) functions as a regulator of both TGF-β and p53 signaling. However, the regulatory mechanism of STRAP activity is not understood. In this study, we report that B-MYB is a new STRAP-interacting protein, and that an amino-terminal DNA-binding domain and an area (amino acids 373-468) between the acidic and conserved regions of B-MYB mediate the B-MYB·STRAP interaction. Functionally, B-MYB enhances STRAP-mediated inhibition of TGF-β signaling pathways, such as apoptosis and growth inhibition, by modulating complex formation between the TGF-β receptor and SMAD3 or SMAD7. Furthermore, coexpression of B-MYB results in a dose-dependent increase in STRAP-mediated stimulation of p53-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest via direct interaction. Confocal microscopy showed that B-MYB prevents the normal translocation of SMAD3 in response to TGF-β1 and stimulates p53 nuclear translocation. These results suggest that B-MYB acts as a positive regulator of STRAP."

The spoIISAB operon of B. subtilis was identified as a locus whose mutation leads to increased activity of the first sporulation-specific sigma factor, σF.

Toxin-antitoxin (TA) 3The abbreviations used are TA, toxin-antitoxin; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; SPR, surface plasmon resonance. modules encoding a stable killer protein and a labile protein antidote were originally discovered through their association with the phenomenon of plasmid maintenance in bacteria (1Ogura T. Hiraga S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1983; 80: 4784-4788Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 2Gerdes K. Rasmussen P.B. Molin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1986; 83: 3116-3120Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). In these systems, the toxin component has a longer cellular half-life than the antitoxin so that the host becomes addicted to the continuous expression of the antitoxin, and plasmid retention is driven by post-segregational cell killing. TA systems were subsequently found to be encoded on bacterial genomes where their biological function and physiological role have been the subject of widespread discussion and speculation (3Masuda Y. Miyakawa K. Nishimura Y. Ohtsubo E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6850-6856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Buts L. Lah J. Dao-Thi M.H. Wyns L. Loris R. Trends Biochem.

According to one line of thought, subpopulations of cells undergo altruistic toxin-mediated cell death for the benefit of the population as a whole. This might be a mechanism to contain the spread of phage infection or, under starvation conditions, to provide food for the survivors. A more widely accepted idea is that TA toxins induce a state of bacteriostasis rather than cell killing, enabling cells to survive temporary bouts of adversity such as starvation or to persist through exposure to antibiotics. In support of this idea is the observation that the actions of some toxins can be reversed by later expression of the antitoxin (6Pedersen K. Christensen S.K. Gerdes K. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) and the finding that TA systems are most prevalent in organisms that are associated with slow growth and dormancy (4Buts L. Lah J. Dao-Thi M.H. Wyns L. Loris R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 672-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). SpoIISA-SpoIISB is a chromosomally encoded TA system in Bacillus subtilis discovered as part of a study of cell differentiation in this organism. In sporulation, the cell division septum forms not at mid-cell as during vegetative growth but instead at a polar location dividing the cell into two compartments of unequal size: a larger mother cell and a smaller forespore. The two cells follow different patterns of gene expression orchestrated by cell type- and stage-specific RNA polymerase sigma factors. The mother cell goes on to engulf the forespore and nurture the latter as it matures into a resistant spore that is released upon mother cell autolysis. The spoIISAB operon was discovered following a screen for B. subtilis mutants in which sporulation is blocked after the formation of the polar septum (7Adler E. Barák I. Stragier P. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3574-3581Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Inactivation of spoIISB decreases the sporulation efficiency of wild type cells by 4 orders of magnitude, whereas inactivation of spoIISA in the same background has no effect on sporulation. In contrast, spoIISA inactivation in a spoIISB null mutant background fully restores sporulation, indicating that SpoIISB is required only to counteract the negative effect of SpoIISA on sporulation (7Adler E. Barák I. Stragier P. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3574-3581Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Cells synthesizing SpoIISA in the absence of SpoIISB exhibit lethal damage of their cell envelopes shortly after asymmetric septation. It appears that the SpoIIS proteins are normally expressed in the mother cell because the defects associated with spoIISB deletion are corrected when SpoIISB is synthesized in the mother cell but not if it is synthesized in the forespore. Forced expression of SpoIISA in exponentially growing cells or in the forespore compartment during sporulation leads to similar morphological defects and cell death. Again protection is conferred by simultaneous synthesis of SpoIISB. These observations led to the conclusions that SpoIISA is a cell killer protein and that SpoIISB is its specific antidote (7Adler E. Barák I. Stragier P. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3574-3581Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). TA systems, which have widespread distribution, have been grouped into families, with prominent examples being the CcdA-CcdB, HigB-HigA, MazE-MazF, ParD-ParE, PhD-Doc, RelB-RelE, VapB-VapC, and YoeB-YefM families (4Buts L. Lah J. Dao-Thi M.H. Wyns L. Loris R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 672-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) with new members continuing to emerge. SpoIISA-SpoIISB appears to define a new family of TA systems that is conserved among Bacilli. spoIISA encodes a 248-residue protein containing three putative transmembrane segments at its N terminus with the C-terminal two-thirds of the protein predicted to be located in the cytoplasm (7Adler E. Barák I. Stragier P. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3574-3581Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The full-length protein is required for cell killing because neither the transmembrane domain nor the cytoplasmic domain, when expressed alone, are toxic. spoIISB encodes a basic hydrophilic protein of 56 amino acid residues, and neither SpoIISA nor SpoIISB has significant sequence similarity to proteins of known structure or function. As a step toward elucidating the biological role of the SpoIIS proteins and the mechanisms by which (i) SpoIISA mediates toxicity and (ii) this toxicity is overcome by SpoIISB, we describe here the characterization and structure of the complex between the cytoplasmic domain of SpoIISA and SpoIISB. All bacterial strains, plasmids and PCR primers used in this study are listed in TABLE 1, TABLE 2. Unless otherwise indicated, Escherichia coli and B. subtilis cultures were grown in LB medium (8Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York2003Google Scholar). Transformation of B. subtilis and assays of sporulation efficiency were performed as described previously (9Harwood C.R. Cutting S.M. Molecular Biological Methods for Bacillus. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, UK1990Google Scholar). Sporulation was induced by nutrient exhaustion in liquid Difco sporulation medium. After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, aliquots of the culture were serially diluted and plated on to LB plates before and after a 15-min incubation at 85 °C. The sporulation efficiency was defined in terms of colony-forming units.TABLE 2Plasmids and bacterial strainsPlasmidDescriptionSource or referencepBAD24AmpR araC; PBAD promoterRef. 51Guzman L.M.

Open table in a new tab All of the PCR primers used in this study are listed in Table 1. Unless otherwise indicated, chromosomal DNA isolated from B. subtilis strain PY79 was used as a PCR template. The plasmid pET15-H-C-IISA was constructed by inserting the 518-bp PCR fragment generated using the primers IISBamS and IISABamE. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and captured at the BamHI site of pET-15b. This plasmid encodes a His6-tagged fragment of SpoIISA (His6-CSpoIISA) encompassing the cytosolic domain. The plasmid pET26-C-IISA was prepared by cloning an 818-bp NdeI/HindIII fragment from partially cleaved pET15-H-C-IISA DNA into the corresponding site of plasmid pET-26b(+). For overproduction of SpoIISB (without a His6 tag), the 321-bp spoIISB PCR fragment generated with the primers IISBNcoS and IISBHindE was ligated at the NcoI/HindIII site of pET-15b to produce the plasmid pET15-IISB. For co-expression, pET15-H-C-IISAB was constructed by inserting the 767-bp fragment amplified by PCR using the primers IISBamS and IISBamE, into the BamHI site of pET-15b. The cloned fragment encompasses the coding sequences for the soluble domain of spoIISA and spoIISB. Because spoIISB appeared to be underexpressed from this construct, we switched to the pETDuet system. First, the plasmid pET-Duet-IISB was prepared by inserting the 346-bp NdeI/EcoRV fragment from pET15-H-IISB into NdeI/EcoRV-digested pETDuet-1. The plasmid pET15-H-IISB was constructed by inserting the 210-bp PCR fragment (generated with primers IISBNdeS and IISBamE) into NdeI/BamHI-cut pET-15b Second, the 1127-bp NcoI/HindIII fragment from pET15-H-C-IISAB was ligated to correspondingly digested pET-Duet-IISB to generate pET-Duet-IISASB. For constructing a B. subtilis spoIISB null mutant, the plasmid pUS19-ΔIISB was prepared as follows. A 577-bp sequence upstream and a 624-bp sequence downstream of spoIISB were PCR-amplified using the primer pairs PIISAS/PIISAA and PfrIISBS/PfrIISBA, respectively, and cloned into the EcoRI/BamHI and PstI/HindIII sites of plasmid pUS19, respectively, creating the plasmid pUS19-FRIISB. A 1541-bp fragment encoding resistance to kanamycin was PCR-amplified from the plasmid pUK19 (10Ju J. Luo T. Haldenwang W.G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1673-1681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the primers PKnS/PKnA and subsequently cloned into PstI/BamHI-cut pUS19-FRIISB to obtain pUS19-ΔIISB plasmid. Plasmid pUS19-ΔIISB was then integrated by double homologous recombination into the chromosome of B. subtilis PY79 giving rise to strain IB1252. Integrative plasmids for assessing the ability of truncated SpoIISB proteins to cure SpoIISA toxicity were prepared in two steps. First, a 771-bp EcoRI/PstI DNA fragment encoding spoIISA was excised from plasmid pBAD24-IISA(Pst) and ligated into the corresponding sites of plasmid pUS19, resulting in plasmid pUS19-IISA(Pst). Plasmid pBAD24-IISA(Pst) was constructed by cloning a 756-bp PCR fragment encompassing spoIISA (using the primers IISANcoS and IISAPstE) into NcoI/PstI-cut pBAD24. In the next step, eight PCR fragments generated from the spoIISB gene using either the sense primers IISB22PstS, IISB31PstS, IISB46PstS, and IISB56PstS and the antisense primer IISBHindE or the sense primer IISB56PstS and the antisense primers IISB40HindE, IISB44HindE, IISB48HindE, and IISB52HindE were introduced into the PstI/HindIII sites of plasmid pUS19-IISA(Pst), giving rise to the plasmids pUS19-IISAB22, pUS19-IISAB31, pUS19-IISB46, pUS19-IISAB56, pUS19-IISB40, pUS19-IISB44, pUS19-IISB48, and pUS19-SB52. These pUS19 derivatives were integrated into the chromosome of the spoIISB null mutant by single homologous recombination. For production of the His6-CSpoIISA, CSpoIISA, and the His6-CSpoIISA2·SpoIISB2 complex, respectively, overnight cultures of E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring appropriate plasmids were diluted into fresh LB medium and incubated in 500-ml flasks with shaking at 37 °C until the culture reached an A600 of 0.6, when isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. The cells were shaken for a further 3 h prior to harvesting by centrifugation. For production of the selenomethionine-substituted protein complex, E. coli B834(DE3) cells harboring pETDuet-H-C-IISASB were grown in M9 minimal medium containing selenomethionine as described previously (11Ramakrishnan V. Biou V. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 538-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Prior to the isolation of proteins, the cells pellets were resuspended in appropriate solubilization buffers (the same buffers, which were used for equilibration of chromatography columns in the first purification step), and cells were lysed by sonication and clarified by centrifugation. After purification, protein fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining, and their purity was judged by visual inspection. For His6-CSpoIISA purification, the clarified supernatant was loaded onto a HisTrap HP Column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 50 mm imidazole, and the proteins were eluted with a 50 to 500 mm imidazole gradient in the same buffer. Further fractionation on a HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-100 HR (GE Healthcare) gel filtration column did not improve the sample purity. The sample was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl and concentrated to ∼1.5 mg/ml. The protein was 95% pure with the overall yield ∼40 mg from 0.25 liters of culture. For purification of CSpoIISA (His6 tag-free), the supernatant was loaded on HiPrep 16/10 Q XL column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer containing 20 mm Bis-Tris-HCl, pH 6.0, 50 mm NaCl, and after washing, the proteins were eluted with a 50–1000 mm NaCl gradient in 20 mm Bis-Tris-HCl, pH 6.0. The pooled CSpoIISA containing fractions were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 150 mm NaCl and concentrated to ∼20 mg/ml and loaded onto a HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-100 HR column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated in the same buffer. The resulting protein sample was found to be ∼95% pure and was dialyzed against 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl. The final protein concentration was ∼1.5 mg/ml, and the overall yield was ∼20 mg from 0.25 liters of culture. The clarified cell lysate-containing SpoIISB protein was loaded on HiPrep 16/10 SP XL column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, and after washing the proteins were eluted with a 50 to 1000 mm NaCl gradient in 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0. The pooled SpoIISB-containing fractions were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 150 mm NaCl and concentrated to ∼5 mg/ml and loaded onto a HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-100 HR column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in the same buffer. The resulting SpoIISB sample was judged to be at least 95% pure and was either supplemented with Tween 20 to final concentration 0.005% or dialyzed against 20 mm potassium buffer, pH 7.8. The overall yield was ∼20 mg from 0.5 liters of culture. Supernatant containing the His6·CSpoIISA·SpoIISB complex was loaded on to a HisTrap HP Column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 9.0, 50 mm NaCl, pH 9.0, and 40 mm imidazole. After an extensive wash, the proteins were eluted with a 40 to 500 mm imidazole (pH adjusted to 9.0 to avoid complex precipitation) gradient in the same buffer. CSpoIISA·SpoIISB-containing fractions were pooled and passed through an HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-100 HR (GE Healthcare) gel filtration column equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, although this step did not noticeably improve the purity. The sample was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl and concentrated to ∼20 mg/ml. The yield of complex was ∼40 mg from 0.25 liter of culture. The selenomethionine-substituted His6-C-SpoIISA·SpoIISB complex was purified using the same procedures as for the native complex yielding ∼40 mg/ml/0.5 liters of cells culture. Circular dichroism spectra were recorded at 20 °C on a Jasco J-810 CD spectrophotometer using a 0.1-cm-path length quartz cell. The experiments were carried out in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8. The protein concentration in the samples varied from 0.1 mg/ml (for His6-C-SpoIISA) to 0.23 mg/ml (for His6-C-SpoIISA·SpoIISB at a molar ratio of 1:4). Random error and noise were reduced for each spectrum by averaging of three scans in the wavelength range 260–190 nm. The signal acquired for the buffer used for dilution of the proteins was subtracted from the spectra acquired for the proteins. A BIACORE 3000 instrument (GE Healthcare) was used for the surface plasmon resonance experiments which were carried out with a CM5 sensor chip. Amine-coupling reagents (N-ethyl-N′-(dimethylamino-propyl) carbodiimide, N-hydroxysuccinimide, ethanolamine pH 8.5), P20 detergent, and 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0, were obtained from Biacore AB, other chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich. As we observed oligomerization of a His6-tagged form of C-SpoIISA, for the SPR experiments, we used protein without the His6 tag. As judged by its mobility on size exclusion chromatography, SpoIISA exists as a dimer in solution (data not shown), and this dimeric preparation of SpoIISA was used for immobilization on the SPR chip. A C-SpoIISA stock solution in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl was diluted to 15 μg/ml with sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0. Subsequently, 850 response units of C-SpoIISA were immobilized via primary amines by 5-min injection of diluted protein over the activated analytical flow cell surface, and any remaining free active sites were blocked by ethanolamine. A reference flow cell was activated and blocked without protein coupling. Kinetic experiments were performed at 25 °C in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, with 0.005% P20 (PBS-P). Duplicates of SpoIISB (diluted from a stock solution containing 0.5 mg/ml protein in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% Tween 20) at concentrations of 4.7, 18.8, and 75 nm together with a PBS-P control were injected at a flow rate of 100 μl/min over the sensor chip, with 120 and 150 s of association and dissociation time, respectively. Regeneration of the surface was accomplished by injection of 20 mm NaOH. Kinetic binding curves were double referenced (12Myszka D.G. J. Mol.

Rate constants were approximated globally, maximal responses and mass transport were fitted locally, and the bulk response was set to zero. Crystals of the native and selenomethionine-substituted CSpoIISA·SpoIISB complex were obtained in hanging drops at 20 °C by mixing equal volumes of protein solution (20 mg/ml) with precipitant solution containing 0.4 m MES, 0.2 m malic acid, 0.43 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, and 21% polyethylene glycol 1500. The crystals belonged to space group P212121 with unit cell parameters a = 54.0 Å, b = 59.5 Å, c = 112.4 Å, and α = β = γ = 90° (Table 3). The crystals contain two heterodimers in the asymmetric unit, and the calculated Matthews co-efficient is 2.55 Å3 Da−1, which corresponds to a solvent content of 52%. The crystals were soaked in a solution of mother liquor containing 25% (v/v) glycerol for 10 s and then flash-cooled at 120 K in a stream of nitrogen gas.TABLE 3Data collection and refinement statisticsNativeSelenomethioninePeakInflectionRemoteData collectionX-ray sourceCoppery rotating anodeEuropean Synchrotron Radiation Facility Beamline ID29European Synchrotron Radiation FacilityBeamline ID29European Synchrotron Radiation Facility Beamline ID29Wavelength (Å)1.541890.97890.97900.9763Collection temperature (K)120120120120Resolution range (Å)50.00–2.5050.00–2.5050.00–2.5050.00–2.50Space groupP212121P212121P212121P212121Unit cell parameters (Å)a, b, c54.12, 61.15, 112.8454.03, 59.47, 112.3554.03, 59.47, 112.3554.03, 59.47, 112.35a = b = g90°90°90°90°Number of unique reflections, overall/outer shellaThe outer shell corresponds to 2.59–2.50 Å for native and 2.54–2.50 Å for peak, inflection, and remote.11,829/47012,777/52412,353/35812,529/403Completeness (%), overall/outer shellaThe outer shell corresponds to 2.59–2.50 Å for native and 2.54–2.50 Å for peak, inflection, and remote.84.6/34.196.9/82.892.0/55.794.0/64.2Redundancy, overall/outer shellaThe outer shell corresponds to 2.59–2.50 Å for native and 2.54–2.50 Å for peak, inflection, and remote.6.2/2.311.9/8.55.7/3.45.6/4.4I/s(I), overall/outer shellaThe outer shell corresponds to 2.59–2.50 Å for native and 2.54–2.50 Å for peak, inflection, and remote.16.8/1.321.6/2.322.6/1.222.4/1.6RmergebRmerge = ΣhklΣi|Ii − <I>|/ΣhklΣi <I>, where Ii is the intensity of the ith measurement of a reflection with indexes hkl, and <I> is the statistically weighted average reflection intensity.

https://openalex.org/W1990636799,"Pathogenic Streptococcus agalactiae produces polysaccharide lyases and unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase (UGL), which are prerequisite for complete degradation of mammalian extracellular matrices, including glycosaminoglycans such as chondroitin and hyaluronan. Unlike the Bacillus enzyme, streptococcal UGLs prefer sulfated glycosaminoglycans. Here, we show the loop flexibility for substrate binding and structural determinants for recognition of glycosaminoglycan sulfate groups in S. agalactiae UGL (SagUGL). UGL also degraded unsaturated heparin disaccharides; this indicates that the enzyme released unsaturated iduronic and glucuronic acids from substrates. We determined the crystal structures of SagUGL wild-type enzyme and both substrate-free and substrate-bound D175N mutants by x-ray crystallography and noted that the loop over the active cleft exhibits flexible motion for substrate binding. Several residues in the active cleft bind to the substrate, unsaturated chondroitin disaccharide with a sulfate group at the C-6 position of GalNAc residue. The sulfate group is hydrogen-bonded to Ser-365 and Ser-368 and close to Lys-370. As compared with wild-type enzyme, S365H, S368G, and K370I mutants exhibited higher Michaelis constants toward the substrate. The conversion of SagUGL to Bacillus sp. GL1 UGL-like enzyme via site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that Ser-365 and Lys-370 are essential for direct binding and for electrostatic interaction, respectively, for recognition of the sulfate group by SagUGL. Molecular conversion was also achieved in SagUGL Arg-236 with an affinity for the sulfate group at the C-4 position of the GalNAc residue. These residues binding to sulfate groups are frequently conserved in pathogenic bacterial UGLs, suggesting that the motif “R-//-SXX(S)XK” (where the hyphen and slash marks in the motif indicate the presence of over 100 residues in the enzyme and parentheses indicate that Ser-368 makes little contribution to enzyme activity) is crucial for degradation of sulfated glycosaminoglycans.

Glycosaminoglycans (e.g. hyaluronan, chondroitin, and heparin) are mammalian extracellular matrix polysaccharides with a repeating disaccharide unit that consists of a uronic acid residue, such as d-glucuronic acid (GlcUA) 2The abbreviations used are GlcUA, d-glucuronic acid; IdoUA, l-iduronic acid; GlcN, d-glucosamine; GlcNAc, N-acetyl-d-glucosamine; UGL, unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase; ΔGlcUA, unsaturated GlcUA; BacillusUGL, Bacillus sp.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2009: 219-228Google Scholar). These extracellular matrices, which are present in various mammalian tissues, play an important role in cell signaling, growth and differentiation, and cell-to-cell association to maintain the architecture of connective tissues (3Gandhi N.S. Mancera R.L. Chem. Biol. Drug Des. 2008; 72: 455-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). A large number of glycosaminoglycans, with the exception of hyaluronan, are frequently sulfated (4Lindahl U. Höök M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 385-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar), and the sulfate groups together with uronic acids enhance the negative charge of the polysaccharides. For instance, chondroitin has sulfate group(s) at the C-4 and/or C-6 positions of the GalNAc residue and/or at the C-2 position of the GlcUA residue (5Lauder R.M. Complement. Ther. Med. 2009; 17: 56-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Degradation of glycosaminoglycans has been studied previously from the viewpoint of bacterial infections and neural regenerations. Bacterial pathogens, such as streptococci, degrade glycosaminoglycans to invade host cells by producing polysaccharide lyases (6Jedrzejas M.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2007; 64: 2799-2822Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Distinct from polysaccharide hydrolases, glycosaminoglycan lyases recognize the uronic acid residue, cleave the linkage between sugars through the β-elimination reaction, and produce unsaturated oligosaccharides, resulting in the unsaturated uronic acid residue having a C=C double bond at the nonreducing terminus (7Linhardt R.J. Avci F.Y. Toida T. Kim Y.S. Cygler M. Adv. Pharmacol. 2006; 53: 187-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1A). Many pathogenic streptococci produce hyaluronate lyases as a spreading factor; these enzymes are capable of degrading both sulfated and unsulfated chondroitin as well as hyaluronan (8Paton J.C. Andrew P.W. Boulnois G.J. Mitchell T.J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 89-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 9Gase K. Ozegowski J. Malke H. Biochim. Biophys.

Lin B. Willingham T.R. Baker J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Researchers have extensively studied the structure and function of streptococcal hyaluronate lyases to ultimately facilitate the development of therapeutic agents for inhibition of the lyases (13Li S. Kelly S.J. Lamani E. Ferraroni M. Jedrzejas M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1228-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 14Mello L.V. De Groot B.L. Li S. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36678-36688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). On the other hand, bacterial polysaccharide lyases (e.g. chondroitin lyase ABC) have been demonstrated to promote neural regeneration (15Bradbury E.J. Moon L.D. Popat R.J. King V.R. Bennett G.S. Patel P.N. Fawcett J.W. McMahon S.B. Nature. 2002; 416: 636-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar). Neurons, especially their axons, experience difficulty in regeneration due to the presence of some inhibitory molecules, such as chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (16Kwok J.C. Afshari F. García-Alías G. Fawcett J.W. Restor. Neurol. Neurosci. 2008; 26: 131-145PubMed Google Scholar). Enzymatic degradation of chondroitin sulfate at the site of an injury enables neurons to regenerate axons and to restore postsynaptic activity. Therefore, elucidation of the bacterial mechanism underlying glycosaminoglycan degradation is important for establishment of therapy against bacterial infections and neural injury. Unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase (UGL) acts on unsaturated glycosaminoglycan oligosaccharides that are produced by polysaccharide lyases and catalyzes the hydrolytic release of unsaturated GlcUA (ΔGlcUA) from saccharides (17Itoh T. Akao S. Hashimoto W. Mikami B. Murata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31804-31812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1A). UGL is peculiar among general glycoside hydrolases in that it triggers hydration of vinyl ether groups specifically present in unsaturated saccharides but not of glycoside bonds (18Itoh T. Hashimoto W. Mikami B. Murata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29807-29816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). On the basis of its primary structure, UGL was categorized as a member of the glycoside hydrolase family 88 in the CAZy database (19Mori S. Akao S. Nankai H. Hashimoto W. Mikami B. Murata K. Protein Expr. Purif. 2003; 29: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 20Cantarel B.L. Coutinho P.M. Rancurel C. Bernard T. Lombard V. Henrissat B. Nucleic. Acids Res. 2009; 37: D233-D238Crossref PubMed Scopus (4193) Google Scholar) after we first identified the gene for Bacillus sp. GL1 UGL (BacillusUGL) (21Hashimoto W. Kobayashi E. Nankai H. Sato N. Miya T. Kawai S. Murata K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 368: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The putative genes for UGL are present in the genome of various pathogenic bacteria, such as streptococci, enterococci, and vibrios. We recently clarified enzymatic characteristics of UGLs from pathogenic streptococci, including Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes, and determined the crystal structure of S. agalactiae UGL (SagUGL) (22Maruyama Y. Nakamichi Y. Itoh T. Mikami B. Hashimoto W. Murata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 18059-18069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The enzyme gene is inducibly transcribed in S. agalactiae cells grown in the presence of glycosaminoglycan, indicating that the bacterium produces UGL as well as polysaccharide lyase for complete degradation of glycosaminoglycans. All of the streptococcal UGLs that have been characterized to date actively degrade unsaturated chondroitin and hyaluronan disaccharides and exhibit a preference for sulfated chondroitin disaccharide, especially for Δ6S, an unsaturated chondroitin disaccharide with a sulfate group at the C-6 position of the GalNAc residue. This study deals with the identification of loop movement for substrate binding and structural determinants for substrate specificity in streptococcal UGL through x-ray crystallography of SagUGL in complex with Δ6S, kinetics of site-directed mutants, and molecular conversion of bacterial UGLs with altered substrate specificity. Unsaturated glycosaminoglycan disaccharides were purchased from Seikagaku Biobusiness or Sigma-Aldrich. Silicagel 60/Kieselguhr F254 TLC plates were obtained from Merck. DEAE-Toyopearl 650M was from Tosoh. HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75pg and Mono Q 10/100 GL were from GE Healthcare. Restriction endonucleases and DNA-modifying enzymes were from Toyobo. Other analytical grade chemicals were obtained from commercial sources. For expression of SagUGL and BacillusUGL, Escherichia coli strain HMS174(DE3) cells transformed with pET21b-SagUGL (22Maruyama Y. Nakamichi Y. Itoh T. Mikami B. Hashimoto W. Murata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 18059-18069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and E. coli strain BL21(DE3) cells transformed with pET3a-BacillusUGL (19Mori S. Akao S. Nankai H. Hashimoto W. Mikami B. Murata K. Protein Expr. Purif. 2003; 29: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) were aerobically cultured at 30 °C in LB medium (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) supplemented with sodium ampicillin (0.1 mg/ml). When the turbidity at 600 nm reached 0.3–0.7, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to the culture at a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and the cells were further cultured at 16 °C for 44 h. E. coli cells harboring pET21b-SagUGL or pET3a-BacillusUGL were grown in LB medium, collected by centrifugation at 6,700 × g and 4 °C for 5 min, and resuspended in 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0). The cells were ultrasonically disrupted (Insonator model 201M, Kubota) at 9 kHz and 0 °C for 5 min, and the clear solution obtained by centrifugation at 28,000 × g and 4 °C for 20 min was used as a cell extract. SagUGL and BacillusUGL were purified from the cell extract to homogeneity by several steps of column chromatography (19Mori S. Akao S. Nankai H. Hashimoto W. Mikami B. Murata K. Protein Expr. Purif. 2003; 29: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 22Maruyama Y. Nakamichi Y. Itoh T. Mikami B. Hashimoto W. Murata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 18059-18069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, SagUGL and BacillusUGL were purified by anion exchange chromatography (DEAE-Toyopearl 650M) followed by gel filtration chromatography (HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 pg) and finally by anion exchange chromatography (Mono Q 10/100 GL). The degree of purification was checked by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207522) Google Scholar). The products derived from unsaturated glycosaminoglycan disaccharides through the reaction of bacterial UGLs were separated by TLC using a solvent system of 1-butanol/acetic acid/water (3:2:2, v/v). The products were visualized by heating the TLC plates at 130 °C for 5 min after spraying with 10% (v/v) sulfuric acid in ethanol. Purified SagUGL enzymes of wild type (WT) and mutant D175N with Asp-175 replaced by Asn were concentrated by ultrafiltration using Centriprep (10,000 molecular weight cutoff) (Millipore) to 10 and 5 mg/ml, respectively. Both WT and D175N were crystallized by sitting drop vapor diffusion. The 3 μl of proteins were mixed with an equal volume of a reservoir solution. The reservoir solution for WT crystallization contained 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 200, 1% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3000, and 0.1 m Hepes (pH 7.0). WT crystals grew up at 20 °C for a week. The reservoir solution for D175N crystallization included 40% (w/v) ethylene glycol, 5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3000, and 0.1 m Hepes (pH 7.5). D175N was crystallized at 20 °C for a month. To prepare a complex form of SagUGL and Δ6S, the D175N crystal was soaked at 20 °C for 10 min in a reservoir solution containing 0.2 m Δ6S before x-ray diffraction experiments. Crystals were placed in a cold nitrogen gas stream at −173 °C. X-ray diffraction images of crystals were collected using a Jupiter 210 charged-coupled device detector (Rigaku) for the WT crystal or a Quantum 210 charged-coupled device detector (Area Detector Systems Corp.) for D175N crystals with synchrotron radiation at a wavelength of 1.00 Å at the BL-38B1 station of SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan). The data were processed and scaled with the HKL2000 program (25Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38609) Google Scholar). The structure was determined through molecular replacement with the Molrep program (26Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4174) Google Scholar) supplied in the CCP4 interface program package (27Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) by using previously determined coordinates of SagUGL WT (Protein Data Bank code 2ZZR) as an initial model. Structure refinement was conducted with the Refmac5 program (28Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13911) Google Scholar). Randomly selected 5% reflections were excluded from refinement and used to calculate Rfree. After each refinement cycle, the model was adjusted manually using the winCoot program (29Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23605) Google Scholar). Water molecules were incorporated where the difference in density exceeded 3.0 σ above the mean and the 2Fo − Fc map showed a density of more than 1.0 σ. The structure of the enzyme-sugar complex was refined using the Refmac5 and the winCoot program with the chondroitin disaccharide parameter file constructed using PRODRG (50Schuettelkopf A.W. Van Aalten D.M.F. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (4356) Google Scholar). Protein models were superimposed, and their root mean square deviation was determined with the LSQKAB program (30Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1976; 32: 922-923Crossref Scopus (2379) Google Scholar), a part of the CCP4 program package. Final model quality was checked with the PROCHECK program (31Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Figures for protein structures were prepared using the PyMOL program (32DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific LLC, San Carlos, CA2004Google Scholar). Electric charge on the molecular surface of bacterial UGLs was calculated using the APBS program (33Baker N.A. Sept D. Joseph S. Holst M.J. McCammon J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 10037-10041Crossref PubMed Scopus (5903) Google Scholar). Coordinates used in this work were taken from the Protein Data Bank of the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (34Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic. Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27906) Google Scholar). Thr-235, Ser-365, Ser-368, and Lys-370 of SagUGL were substituted with Ala, His, Gly, and Ile, respectively, and His-210, His-339, Gly-342, and Ile-344 of BacillusUGL were substituted with Arg, Ser, Ser, and Lys, respectively. UGL mutants were constructed using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The plasmid pET21b-SagUGL (22Maruyama Y. Nakamichi Y. Itoh T. Mikami B. Hashimoto W. Murata K. J. Biol.

Purif. 2003; 29: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) was used as a PCR template, and the synthetic oligonucleotides used as sense and antisense primers are shown in supplemental Table S1. PCR was carried out using KOD-FX polymerase (Toyobo) in place of Pfu polymerase. Mutations were confirmed by the dideoxy chain termination method (35Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52766) Google Scholar) using automated DNA sequencer model 3730xl (Applied Biosystems). The cells of the E. coli host strain (HMS174(DE3)) were transformed with the mutant plasmids. Expression and purification of the mutants were conducted by using the same procedures as for SagUGL or BacillusUGL WT as described above. DNA manipulations such as plasmid isolation, subcloning, transformation, and gel electrophoresis were performed as described (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Kinetics parameters of SagUGLs (WT, T235A, S365H, S368G, and K370I) and BacillusUGLs (WT, H339S, G342S, and I344K) toward Δ6S or sulfate-free unsaturated chondroitin disaccharide (Δ0S) were determined as follows. The activity of UGLs was assayed at 30 °C by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 235 nm arising from the double bond (molar extinction coefficient ϵ235 = 4,800 m−1 cm−1) in the substrates. The reaction mixtures consisted of substrate, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and enzyme. The range of substrate concentration was fixed at 0.05–1.0 mm because the absorbance at 235 nm of the substrate at over 1.0 mm exceeded measurement limitations on the spectrometer. Km and kcat were calculated using the Michaelis-Menten equation with KaleidaGraph software (Synergy Software). In our previous studies (21Hashimoto W. Kobayashi E. Nankai H. Sato N. Miya T. Kawai S. Murata K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 368: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 22Maruyama Y. Nakamichi Y. Itoh T. Mikami B. Hashimoto W. Murata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 18059-18069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), Bacillus and streptococcal UGLs have been identified to degrade unsaturated chondroitin and hyaluronan disaccharides. Both chondroitin and hyaluronan include β-GlcUA as a component, whereas α-IdoUA, a C-5 epimer of GlcUA, is predominant (ratio in uronates, >70%) in heparin molecules (3Gandhi N.S. Mancera R.L. Chem. Biol. Drug Des. 2008; 72: 455-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). There is also a difference in glycoside bond pattern between chondroitin/hyaluronan and heparin/heparan sulfate. The 1→3 glycoside bond is present between uronate and amino sugar residues in chondroitin and hyaluronan, although both heparin and heparan sulfate contain the 1→4 glycoside bond between uronate and amino sugar residues. Thus, the enzyme activity of SagUGL was investigated using unsaturated heparin disaccharides with and without sulfate group(s) as a substrate. The sulfate-free unsaturated heparin disaccharide was completely degraded to unsaturated uronic acid and GlcNAc by SagUGL (Fig. 1B, lane 5). In combination with previously reported data, this result indicates that the enzyme acts on unsaturated α-IdoUA (ΔIdoUA) as well as unsaturated β-GlcUA residues in substrates and cleaves both glycoside bonds 1→3 and 1→4. The formation of a double bond between C-4 and C-5 atoms leads to loss of epimerization in GlcUA and IdoUA. In fact, C-3, C-4, C-5, and C-6 atoms of ΔGlcUA were determined to be located in a single plane through structural analysis of UGL and unsaturated glycosaminoglycan disaccharide (18Itoh T. Hashimoto W. Mikami B. Murata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29807-29816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, the degradation of both unsaturated chondroitin and heparin disaccharides by UGL was chemically appropriate because each nonreducing terminus showed the same conformation. The activity of UGL on ΔGlcUA- and ΔIdoUA-containing glycosaminoglycan disaccharides suggests that each glycosaminoglycan in mammalian extracellular matrices is first depolymerized to unsaturated disaccharides by a specific polysaccharide lyase, and the resultant unsaturated disaccharides are degraded to the constituent monosaccharides by a single enzyme, UGL. Sulfate-bound disaccharides, such as unsaturated heparin disaccharides with sulfate group(s) at either or both the C-6 position of the GlcNAc residue or the nitrogen position of the GlcN residue, were also degraded by SagUGL (supplemental Fig. S1). Similar to chondroitin and heparin, heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate include IdoUA and/or GlcUA and sulfate group(s) in their molecules (3Gandhi N.S. Mancera R.L. Chem. Biol. Drug Des. 2008; 72: 455-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Therefore, streptococcal UGLs are considered as one of the key enzymes for degradation of all uronate-including glycosaminoglycans, chondroitin, hyaluronan, heparin, heparan sulfate, and dermatan sulfate after reactions of polysaccharide lyases. Streptococcal UGLs, including SagUGL, showed a preference for sulfate-bound unsaturated disaccharides from glycosaminoglycans (e.g. chondroitin and heparin) (22Maruyama Y. Nakamichi Y. Itoh T. Mikami B. Hashimoto W. Murata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 18059-18069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Because this preference of streptococcal UGLs was thought to be dependent on substrate binding, catalytic action, or both, SagUGL and BacillusUGL were kinetically analyzed using sulfate-free (Δ0S) and -bound (Δ6S) unsaturated chondroitin disaccharides as substrates (Table 1). We interpreted the kinetic parameters listed in Table 1 as follows. We treated kinetic parameters with higher Michaelis constants (Km over 1 mm) as estimations because kinetic studies of bacterial UGLs with the higher concentrations (over 1 mm) of substrate were difficult to perform because of their high absorbance at 235 nm. We determined kinetics parameters of SagUGL toward Δ0S and Δ6S. The Km value (1.27 mm) toward Δ0S was over 10-fold higher than that (0.100 mm) toward Δ6S, whereas turnover number (kcat) toward Δ0S was about 3.8-fold smaller than that toward Δ6S. In comparison with the great difference in the affinity for substrate (Km), the difference in kcat was considered to be insignificant. This result indicates that the enzyme exhibits a higher affinity for Δ6S than Δ0S, and its substrate specificity mostly depends on substrate binding. In contrast, BacillusUGL showed a preference for the unsulfated substrate rather than the sulfated substrate because of its high affinity (around 50-fold), although the differences in kcat of the enzyme toward Δ0S and Δ6S were less than 4-fold.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters of bacterial UGLsΔ6SΔ0SKmkcatkcat/KmKmkcatkcat/Kmmms−1s−1 mm−1mms−1s−1 mm−1SagUGLWT0.100 ± 0.028310.2 ± 0.6621021.27 ± 0.09412.69 ± 0.1282.12T235A1.75 ± 0.3443.96 ± 0.5542.26NDaND, kinetic parameters could not be determined due to the very low activity.NDNDS365H2.36 ± 0.1603.85 ± 0.1991.630.763 ± 0.2151.69 ± 0.2552.21S368G0.191 ± 0.026924.8 ± 1.121301.40 ± 0.33210.8 ± 1.717.71K370I1.47 ± 0.19141.6 ± 3.8428.20.371 ± 0.06923.97 ± 0.29710.7BacillusUGLWT18.6 ± 6.6154.9 ± 18.32.950.381 ± 0.039414.1 ± 0.62536.8H339S7.19 ± 1.5424.5 ± 4.703.410.861 ± 0.14716.9 ± 1.4019.6G342S7.00 ± 2.6520.9 ± 7.092.990.504 ± 0.040518.2 ± 0.66536.1I344K2.20 ± 0.10539.8 ± 1.4118.10.566 ± 0.092823.8 ± 1.8642.0a ND, kinetic parameters could not be determined due to the very low activity. Open table in a new tab Based on the kinetics of SagUGL and BacillusUGL, we conclude that the activity on the sulfated substrate was mainly dependent on the affinity for the substrate rather than turnover number. This lesser effect of kcat on substrate specificity was likely due to the multiple actions of UGL strictly on ΔGlcUA but not on amino sugar (18Itoh T. Hashimoto W. Mikami B. Murata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29807-29816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), i.e. (i) proton donation to the C-4 atom of ΔGlcUA, (ii) deprotonation of the water molecule, (iii) addition of the water molecule to the C-5 atom of ΔGlcUA, (iv) cleavage of the glycoside bond, and (v) conversion of ΔGlcUA to α-keto acid. Hereafter, substrate specificity was analyzed based on the affinity (Km) for the substrate. The substrate specificity of SagUGL is suggestive of its structural features for specific binding to sulfate groups in the substrate. To clarify structural determinants for sulfate binding, we performed x-ray crystallography of the enzyme-substrate complex. In a previous study, SagUGL was crystallized in a drop solution using ammonium sulfate as the major precipitant, and the crystal structure of the ligand-free enzyme was determined at 1.75-Å resolution (22Maruyama Y. Nakamichi Y. Itoh T. Mikami B. Hashimoto W. Murata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 18059-18069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In this study, we conducted many experiments to prepare the enzyme-substrate complex through a soaking treatment of crystals in the substrate solution but failed to obtain the complex. Thus, crystallization conditions were rescreened to accommodate the substrate at the active site of the enzyme. Another crystal of SagUGL WT formed in a drop solution using polyethylene glycol as th"
https://openalex.org/W2063604452,"Mono-ADP-ribosylation is a reversible post-translational modification that can modulate the functions of target proteins. We have previously demonstrated that the β subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins is endogenously mono-ADP-ribosylated, and once modified, the βγ dimer is inactive toward its effector enzymes. To better understand the physiological relevance of this post-translational modification, we have studied its hormonal regulation. Here, we report that Gβ subunit mono-ADP-ribosylation is differentially modulated by G protein-coupled receptors. In intact cells, hormone stimulation of the thrombin receptor induces Gβ subunit mono-ADP-ribosylation, which can affect G protein signaling. Conversely, hormone stimulation of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRHR) inhibits Gβ subunit mono-ADP-ribosylation. We also provide the first demonstration that activation of the GnRHR can activate the ADP-ribosylation factor Arf6, which in turn inhibits Gβ subunit mono-ADP-ribosylation. Indeed, removal of Arf6 from purified plasma membranes results in loss of GnRHR-mediated inhibition of Gβ subunit mono-ADP-ribosylation, which is fully restored by re-addition of purified, myristoylated Arf6. We show that Arf6 acts as a competitive inhibitor of the endogenous ADP-ribosyltransferase and is itself modified by this enzyme. These data provide further understanding of the mechanisms that regulate endogenous ADP-ribosylation of the Gβ subunit, and they demonstrate a novel role for Arf6 in hormone regulation of Gβ subunit mono-ADP-ribosylation."
