https://openalex.org/W2117581782,"An electron in a solid, that is, bound to or nearly localized on the specific atomic site, has three attributes: charge, spin, and orbital. The orbital represents the shape of the electron cloud in solid. In transition-metal oxides with anisotropic-shaped d-orbital electrons, the Coulomb interaction between the electrons (strong electron correlation effect) is of importance for understanding their metal-insulator transitions and properties such as high-temperature superconductivity and colossal magnetoresistance. The orbital degree of freedom occasionally plays an important role in these phenomena, and its correlation and/or order-disorder transition causes a variety of phenomena through strong coupling with charge, spin, and lattice dynamics. An overview is given here on this ""orbital physics,"" which will be a key concept for the science and technology of correlated electrons."
https://openalex.org/W2123128601,"Junctions consisting of two crossed single-walled carbon nanotubes were fabricated with electrical contacts at each end of each nanotube. The individual nanotubes were identified as metallic (M) or semiconducting (S), based on their two-terminal conductances; MM, MS, and SS four-terminal devices were studied. The MM and SS junctions had high conductances, on the order of 0.1 e(2)/h (where e is the electron charge and h is Planck's constant). For an MS junction, the semiconducting nanotube was depleted at the junction by the metallic nanotube, forming a rectifying Schottky barrier. We used two- and three-terminal experiments to fully characterize this junction."
https://openalex.org/W2160091872,"The tau mutation is a semidominant autosomal allele that dramatically shortens period length of circadian rhythms in Syrian hamsters. We report the molecular identification of the tau locus using genetically directed representational difference analysis to define a region of conserved synteny in hamsters with both the mouse and human genomes. The tau locus is encoded by casein kinase I epsilon (CKIepsilon), a homolog of the Drosophila circadian gene double-time. In vitro expression and functional studies of wild-type and tau mutant CKIepsilon enzyme reveal that the mutant enzyme has a markedly reduced maximal velocity and autophosphorylation state. In addition, in vitro CKIepsilon can interact with mammalian PERIOD proteins, and the mutant enzyme is deficient in its ability to phosphorylate PERIOD. We conclude that tau is an allele of hamster CKIepsilon and propose a mechanism by which the mutation leads to the observed aberrant circadian phenotype in mutant animals."
https://openalex.org/W2111214371,"The high-temperature copper oxide superconductors are of fundamental and enduring interest. They not only manifest superconducting transition temperatures inconceivable 15 years ago, but also exhibit many other properties apparently incompatible with conventional metal physics. The materials expand our notions of what is possible, and compel us to develop new experimental techniques and theoretical concepts. This article provides a perspective on recent developments and their implications for our understanding of interacting electrons in metals."
https://openalex.org/W2114911095,"Redistribution of postsynaptic AMPA- (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid-) subtype glutamate receptors may regulate synaptic strength at glutamatergic synapses, but the mediation of the redistribution is poorly understood. We show that AMPA receptors underwent clathrin-dependent endocytosis, which was accelerated by insulin in a GluR2 subunit-dependent manner. Insulin-stimulated endocytosis rapidly decreased AMPA receptor numbers in the plasma membrane, resulting in long-term depression (LTD) of AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission in hippocampal CA1 neurons. Moreover, insulin-induced LTD and low-frequency stimulation-(LFS-) induced homosynaptic CA1 LTD were found to be mutually occlusive and were both blocked by inhibiting postsynaptic clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Thus, controlling postsynaptic receptor numbers through endocytosis may be an important mechanism underlying synaptic plasticity in the mammalian CNS."
https://openalex.org/W1984200080,"Metasedimentary rocks of the Greater Himalaya are traditionally viewed as Indian shield basement that has been thrust southward onto Lesser Himalayan sedimentary rocks during the Cenozoic collision of India and Eurasia. Ages determined from radioactive decay of uranium to lead in zircon grains from Nepal suggest that Greater Himalayan protoliths were shed from the northern end of the East African orogen during the late Proterozoic pan-African orogenic event. These rocks were accreted onto northern Gondwana and intruded by crustal melts during Cambrian-Ordovician time. Our data suggest that the Main Central thrust may have a large amount of pre-Tertiary displacement, that structural restorations placing Greater Himalayan rocks below Lesser Himalayan rocks at the onset of Cenozoic orogenesis are flawed, and that some metamorphism of Greater Himalayan rocks may have occurred during early Paleozoic time."
https://openalex.org/W1993027053,"Major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) molecules capture peptides within the endocytic pathway to generate T cell receptor (TCR) ligands. Immature dendritic cells (DCs) sequester intact antigens in lysosomes, processing and converting antigens into peptide-MHC II complexes upon induction of DC maturation. The complexes then accumulate in distinctive, nonlysosomal MHC II+ vesicles that appear to migrate to the cell surface. Although the vesicles exclude soluble lysosomal contents and antigen-processing machinery, many contain MHC I and B7 costimulatory molecules. After arrival at the cell surface, the MHC and costimulatory molecules remain clustered. Thus, transport of peptide-MHC II complexes by DCs not only accomplishes transfer from late endocytic compartments to the plasma membrane, but does so in a manner that selectively concentrates TCR ligands and costimulatory molecules for T cell contact."
https://openalex.org/W2006851823,"Cerebellar long-term depression (LTD) is a cellular model system of information storage that may underlie certain forms of motor learning. While cerebellar LTD is expressed as a selective modification of postsynaptic AMPA receptors, this might involve changes in receptor number/distribution, unitary conductance, kinetics, or glutamate affinity. The observation that GluR2-containing synaptic AMPA receptors could be internalized by regulated clathrin-mediated endocytosis suggested that this process could underlie LTD expression. To test this hypothesis, we postsynaptically applied dynamin and amphiphysin peptides that interfere with the clathrin endocytotic complex and found that they blocked LTD expression in cultured Purkinje neurons. In addition, induction of LTD and attenuation of AMPA responses by stimulation of clathrin-mediated endocytosis occluded each other. These findings suggest that the expression of cerebellar LTD requires clathrin-mediated internalization of postsynaptic AMPA receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2063067007,"We propose a novel parameter, namely, the skewness, or asymmetry, of the shape of a receptive field to characterize two properties of hippocampal place fields. First, a majority of hippocampal receptive fields on linear tracks are negatively skewed, such that during a single pass the firing rate is low as the rat enters the field but high as it exits. Second, while the place fields are symmetric at the beginning of a session, they become highly asymmetric with experience. Further experiments suggest that these results are likely to arise due to synaptic plasticity during behavior. Using a purely feed forward neural network model, we show that following repeated directional activation, NMDA-dependent long-term potentiation/long-term depotentiation (LTP/LTD) could result in an experience-dependent asymmetrization of receptive fields."
https://openalex.org/W2000816728,"p53, the most commonly mutated gene in cancer cells, directs cell cycle arrest or induces programmed cell death (apoptosis) in response to stress. It has been demonstrated that p53 activity is up-regulated in part by posttranslational acetylation. In agreement with these observations, here we show that mammalian histone deacetylase (HDAC)-1, -2, and -3 are all capable of down-regulating p53 function. Down-regulation of p53 activity by HDACs is HDAC dosage-dependent, requires the deacetylase activity of HDACs, and depends on the region of p53 that is acetylated by p300/CREB-binding protein (CBP). These results suggest that interactions of p53 and HDACs likely result in p53 deacetylation, thereby reducing its transcriptional activity. In support of this idea, GST pull-down and immunoprecipitation assays show that p53 interacts with HDAC1 both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, a pre-acetylated p53 peptide was significantly deacetylated by immunoprecipitated wild type HDAC1 but not deacetylase mutant. Also, co-expression of HDAC1 greatly reduced the in vivo acetylation level of p53. Finally, we report that the activation potential of p53 on the BAX promoter, a natural p53-responsive system, is reduced in the presence of HDACs. Taken together, our findings indicate that deacetylation of p53 by histone deacetylases is likely to be part of the mechanisms that control the physiological activity of p53."
https://openalex.org/W1992890665,"Small changes in an external parameter can often lead to dramatic qualitative changes in the lowest energy quantum mechanical ground state of a correlated electron system. In anisotropic crystals, such as the high temperature superconductors where electron motion occurs primarily on a two-dimensional square lattice, the quantum critical point between two such lowest energy states has non-trivial emergent excitations which control the physics over a significant portion of the phase diagram. Non-zero temperature dynamic properties near quantum critical points are described using simple theoretical models. Possible quantum phases and transitions of the two-dimensional electron gas on a square lattice are discussed, including phases with spin-charge separation and their experimental signatures."
https://openalex.org/W2004937932,"In the hippocampus, interneurons provide synaptic inhibition via the transmitter GABA, which can activate GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors (GABA(A)Rs and GABA(B)Rs). Generally, however, GABA released by a single interneuron activates only GABA(A)Rs on its targets, despite the abundance of GABA(B)RS. Here, I show that during hippocampal rhythmic activity, simultaneous release of GABA from several interneurons activates postsynaptic GABA(B)Rs and that block of GABA(B)Rs increases oscillation frequency. Furthermore, if GABA uptake is inhibited, even GABA released by a single interneuron is enough to activate GABA(B)Rs. This occurs also on cells not directly contacted by that interneuron, indicating that GABA has to overcome uptake and exit the synaptic cleft to reach GABA(B)RS. Thus, activation of extrasynaptic GABA(B)Rs by pooling of GABA is an important mechanism regulating hippocampal network activity."

https://openalex.org/W2062469063,"In eukaryotes, dozens of posttranscriptional modifications are directed to specific nucleotides in ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) by small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). We identified homologs of snoRNA genes in both branches of the Archaea. Eighteen small sno-like RNAs (sRNAs) were cloned from the archaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius by coimmunoprecipitation with archaeal fibrillarin and NOP56, the homologs of eukaryotic snoRNA-associated proteins. We trained a probabilistic model on these sRNAs to search for more sRNAs in archaeal genomic sequences. Over 200 additional sRNAs were identified in seven archaeal genomes representing both the Crenarchaeota and the Euryarchaeota. snoRNA-based rRNA processing was therefore probably present in the last common ancestor of Archaea and Eukarya, predating the evolution of a morphologically distinct nucleolus."
https://openalex.org/W1968640414,"The GDNF family ligands (GFLs: GDNF, neurturin, persephin, and artemin) signal through RET and a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored coreceptor (GFRα1–α4) that binds ligand with high affinity and provides specificity. The importance of the GPI anchor is not fully understood; however, GPI-linked proteins cluster into lipid rafts, structures that may represent highly specialized signaling organelles. Here, we report that GPI-anchored GFRα1 recruits RET to lipid rafts after GDNF stimulation and results in RET/Src association. Disruption of RET localization using either transmembrane-anchored or soluble GFRα1 results in RET phosphorylation, but GDNF-induced intracellular signaling events are markedly attenuated as are neuronal differentiation and survival responses. Therefore, proper membrane localization of RET via interaction with a raft-localized, GPI-linked coreceptor is of fundamental importance in GFL signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2094016999,"This study shows that a corpus of proto-word forms shares four sequential sound patterns with words of modern languages and the first words of infants. Three of the patterns involve intrasyllabic consonant-vowel (CV) co-occurrence: labial (lip) consonants with central vowels, coronal (tongue front) consonants with front vowels, and dorsal (tongue back) consonants with back vowels. The fourth pattern is an intersyllabic preference for initiating words with a labial consonant-vowel-coronal consonant sequence (LC). The CV effects may be primarily biomechanically motivated. The LC effect may be self-organizational, with multivariate causality. The findings support the hypothesis that these four patterns were basic to the origin of words."
https://openalex.org/W2035655456,"Susceptibility to murine and human insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus correlates strongly with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II I-A or HLA-DQ alleles that lack an aspartic acid at position beta57. I-Ag7 lacks this aspartate and is the only class II allele expressed by the nonobese diabetic mouse. The crystal structure of I-Ag7 was determined at 2.6 angstrom resolution as a complex with a high-affinity peptide from the autoantigen glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) 65. I-Ag7 has a substantially wider peptide-binding groove around beta57, which accounts for distinct peptide preferences compared with other MHC class II alleles. Loss of Asp(beta57) leads to an oxyanion hole in I-Ag7 that can be filled by peptide carboxyl residues or, perhaps, through interaction with the T cell receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1969067601,"Animals in complex environments must discriminate between salient and uninformative sensory cues. Caenorhabditis elegans uses one pair of olfactory neurons called AWC to sense many different odorants, yet the animal can distinguish each odorant from the others in discrimination assays. We demonstrate that the transmembrane guanylyl cyclase ODR-1 is essential for responses to all AWC-sensed odorants. ODR-1 appears to be a shared signaling component downstream of odorant receptors. Overexpression of ODR-1 protein indicates that ODR-1 can influence odor discrimination and adaptation as well as olfaction. Adaptation to one odorant, butanone, is disrupted by ODR-1 overexpression. Olfactory discrimination is also disrupted by ODR-1 overexpression, probably by overproduction of the shared second messenger cGMP. We propose that AWC odorant signaling pathways are insulated to permit odor discrimination."
https://openalex.org/W2043068492,"In the mammalian olfactory bulb, signal processing is mediated by synaptic interactions between dendrites. Glutamate released from mitral cell dendrites excites dendritic spines of granule cells, which in turn release GABA back onto the mitral cell dendrites, forming a reciprocal synaptic pair. This feedback synaptic circuit was shown to be mediated predominantly by NMDA receptors. We further utilized caged Ca2+ compounds to obtain insight into the mechanism that couples NMDA receptor activation to GABA release. Feedback inhibition elicited by photo-release of caged Ca2+ in mitral cell secondary dendrites persisted when voltage-gated Ca2+ channels were blocked by cadmium (Cd2+) and nickel (Ni2+). These results indicate that Ca2+ influx through NMDA receptors can directly trigger presynaptic GABA release for local dendrodendritic feedback inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2035568334,"Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a major neutrophil protein and may be involved in the nitration of tyrosine residues observed in a wide range of inflammatory diseases that involve neutrophils and macrophage activation. In order to clarify if nitrite could be a physiological substrate of myeloperoxidase, we investigated the reactions of the ferric enzyme and its redox intermediates, compound I and compound II, with nitrite under pre-steady state conditions by using sequential mixing stopped-flow analysis in the pH range 4–8. At 15 °C the rate of formation of the low spin MPO-nitrite complex is (2.5 ± 0.2) × 104m−1 s−1at pH 7 and (2.2 ± 0.7) × 106m−1 s−1at pH 5. The dissociation constant of nitrite bound to the native enzyme is 2.3 ± 0.1 mm at pH 7 and 31.3 ± 0.5 μm at pH 5. Nitrite is oxidized by two one-electron steps in the MPO peroxidase cycle. The second-order rate constant of reduction of compound I to compound II at 15 °C is (2.0 ± 0.2) × 106m−1s−1 at pH 7 and (1.1 ± 0.2) × 107m−1s−1 at pH 5. The rate constant of reduction of compound II to the ferric native enzyme at 15 °C is (5.5 ± 0.1) × 102m−1s−1 at pH 7 and (8.9 ± 1.6) × 104m−1s−1 at pH 5. pH dependence studies suggest that both complex formation between the ferric enzyme and nitrite and nitrite oxidation by compounds I and II are controlled by a residue with a pK a of (4.3 ± 0.3). Protonation of this group (which is most likely the distal histidine) is necessary for optimum nitrite binding and oxidation.

Moncada S. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (2516) Google Scholar). Induction of NO⋅ synthesis during inflammatory processes represents a defense mechanism against invading microorganisms, although excessive formation of NO⋅ has been implicated in host tissue injury (2.Moncada S. Higgs A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 329: 2002-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (5758) Google Scholar, 3.Beckman J.S. Koppenol W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1424-C1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it has been demonstrated that myeloperoxidase can oxidize nitrite to a species capable of nitrating tyrosine and tyrosyl residues in proteins (4.Van der Vliet A. Eiserich J.P. Halliwell B. Cross C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7617-7625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 5.Eiserich J.P. Hristova M. Cross C.E. Jones A.D.

Biophys. 1998; 356: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). This is one of the most intriguing developments in the biochemistry of MPO,1 because nitration of tyrosine residues in proteins occurs in a wide range of inflammatory diseases involving activated neutrophils and macrophages. Since nitrite is observed to accumulate upon nitric oxide synthase activation in many inflammatory diseases (7.Evans T. Buttery L. Carpenter A. Springall D. Polak J. Cohen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 93: 9553-9558Crossref Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and nitrite concentrations can be locally higher in tissues than those measured in plasma (8.Torre D. Ferrario G. Sperenza F. Orani A. Fiori G. Zeroli C. J. Clin. Pathol. 1996; 49: 574-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 9.Farrel A. Blake D. Palmer R. Moncada S. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1992; 51: 1219-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar), nitration mediated by MPO could be an additional defense function. Myeloperoxidase (MPO, EC 1.11.1.7) is a member of the homologous mammalian peroxidase family and is the most abundant protein of neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes) (10.Klebanoff S.J. Gallin J.I. Goldstein I.M. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1988: 391-443Google Scholar). In activated neutrophils during phagocytosis, MPO has been shown to form hypochlorous acid (11.Hazen S.L. Hsu F.F. Mueller D.M. Crowley J.R. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1238-1289Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 12.Jiang Q. Hurst J.K. J. Biol.

CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 1-35Google Scholar). MPO catalyzes both one- and two-electron oxidations. Thus principally, oxidation of nitrite (NO2−) could result in the formation of either NO2· (nitrogen dioxide) or NO2+ (nitryl ion). Generally, ferric or native myeloperoxidase reacts with hydrogen peroxide forming compound I (MPO-I) (Reaction 1). This redox intermediate is known to oxidize halides via a single two-electron reaction to produce the respective hypohalous acids and regenerate the native enzyme (Reaction 2). Alternatively, stepwise reduction of compound I by two donor-derived electrons produces compound II (MPO-II) and subsequently the resting ferric state (Reactions 3 and 4). MPO+H2O2↔MPO­I+H2O REACTION 1 MPO­I+X−↔MPO+HOX REACTION 2 MPO­I+AH2→MPO­II+AH• REACTION 3 MPO­II+AH2→MPO+AH• REACTION 4In the present paper we have investigated the direct reaction of the ferric enzyme and both redox intermediates with nitrite by using multimixing sequential stopped-flow spectroscopy. We show that nitrite is an excellent substrate for compound I (MPO-I) but reacts slowly with compound II (MPO-II). Nitrite oxidation occurs during the peroxidatic cycle of MPO in two one-electron oxidation steps (Reactions 3 and 4) and yields nitrogen dioxide. Nitrite not only acts as electron donor for compounds I and II but also forms a low spin complex with the ferric enzyme (15.Cooper C.E. Odell E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 58-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) (Reaction 5). MPO+NO2−↔MPO­NO2− REACTION 5For the first time the actual bimolecular rate constants for Reactions 3–R5 in the pH range 4–8 are reported. The consequences for MPO-mediated nitration in vivo are discussed. -Purification of myeloperoxidase from human leukocytes to a purity index (A 430/A 280) of at least 0.85 and determination of its concentration and that of hydrogen peroxide was performed as reported previously (16.Furtmüller P.G. Burner U. Obinger C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17923-17930Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Hydrogen peroxide and nitrite solutions were prepared shortly before use. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma at the highest grade available. The sequential stopped-flow apparatus (model SX-18MV) and the associated computer system were fromApplied Photophysics (UK). For a total of 100 μl/shot into a flow cell with 1-cm light path the fastest time for mixing two solutions and recording the first data point was about 1.5 ms. Formation of the low spin MPO-nitrite complex was followed at its Soret maximum at 447 nm. In a typical experiment one syringe contained MPO (1 μmheme) in 5 mm phosphate (pH 7), and the other contained various concentrations of nitrite in 200 mm phosphate buffer (pH 5–8) or 200 mm citrate/phosphate buffer (pH 4 and 5). The bimolecular rate constant of complex formation (k on) was derived from a plot ofk obs versus varying nitrite concentrations. The finite intercept of this plot representedk off, and the ratio of the rate constantsk off/k on resulted in a dissociation constant of the MPO-nitrite complex. Complex formation was also studied with a diode array detector (PD.1. Applied Photophysics). Typically, the heme concentration used in these experiments was 2 μm. Because of the inherent instability of MPO compound I (16.Furtmüller P.G. Burner U. Obinger C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17923-17930Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), sequential stopped-flow (multimixing) analysis was used for determination of rates of the reaction of compound I with nitrite. The kinetics of compound I formation and its stability were as described previously by Furtmüller et al. (16.Furtmüller P.G. Burner U. Obinger C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17923-17930Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). To determine the pH dependence of the reduction of compound I, sequential stopped-flow experiments were performed at different pH values from 4 to 8. The reactions were followed at the Soret maximum of compound II (456 nm). In a typical pH-jump experiment MPO (2 μm heme) in 5 mm buffer (pH 7) was premixed with 20 μmH2O2 in distilled water. After a delay time of 20 ms, compound I was allowed to react with varying concentrations of nitrite in 200 mm phosphate buffer (pH 5–8) or in 200 mm citrate/phosphate buffer (pH 4 and 5). The final pH after mixing was measured at the outlet. Reduction of compound II by nitrite was performed as recently described by Burner et al. (17.Burner U. Obinger C. Paumann M. Furtmüller P.G. Kettle A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9494-9502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In a typical pH-jump experiment MPO (2 μm heme) in 5 mm buffer (pH 7) was premixed with 20 μm H2O2 and 1.8 μm homovanillic acid in distilled water. After a delay time of 40 s, compound II was allowed to react with varying concentrations of nitrite in 200 mm phosphate buffer (pH 5–8) or 200 mm phosphate/citrate buffer (pH 4 and 5). The reactions were followed at 456 nm (disappearance of compound II), 430 nm (formation of ferric MPO), and 440 nm (isosbestic point between ferric MPO and its nitrite complex). At least three determinations (1000–2000 data points) ofk obs were performed for each substrate concentration, and the mean value was used in a plot ofk obs versus substrate concentration. The final nitrite concentrations were at least 10 times in excess of the enzyme to ensure first-order kinetics. All reactions were performed at 15 °C. Reduction of both compound I and compound II was also studied with the diode array detector. Typically, the heme concentration used in these experiments was 2 μm. The activity of MPO in the presence of nitrite was measured by continuously monitoring hydrogen peroxide concentration with a YSI 2510 oxidase probe fitted to a YSI model 25 oxidase meter (Yellow Springs Instrument Co.). The electrode was covered with a single layer of dialysis tubing and calibrated against known concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (18.Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 502-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). All reactions were started by the addition of myeloperoxidase. Addition of nitrite to native myeloperoxidase induces both a reduced absorbance and a red shift of the Soret peak from 430 to 447 nm as well as formation of a new peak at 627 nm (Fig.1 A). The isosbestic points between native MPO and its nitrite complex are found at 440, 498, 594, and 650 nm. Since nitrite is a strong field ligand, a typical low spin iron complex is formed as has been confirmed by EPR spectroscopy (15.Cooper C.E. Odell E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 58-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Under conditions of excess of nitrite, the pseudo first-order rate constant, k obs, was obtained from the exponential time course at 447 nm. The inset of Fig.1 B shows a typical stopped-flow trace for the complex formation displaying monophasic exponential character. The second-order rate constant (k on) at pH 7, obtained from the slope of the plot of k obs versusnitrite concentration is (2.5 ± 0.2) × 104m−1 s−1at 15 °C (Fig. 1 B). The intercept of this plot, (60 ± 2) s−1, represents the dissociation rate (k off). The ratio of the rate constants,k off/k on, gives a value for the dissociation constant (K diss) of the nitrite complex to the native enzyme and nitrite of (2.3 ± 0.2) mm. Previously, K diss, calculated from the changes in optical spectra following titration with nitrite, has been reported to be 1–2 mm at pH 7.0 (15.Cooper C.E. Odell E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 58-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The nitrite affinity was also determined between pH 4 and 8. Fig.1 C plots the apparent bimolecular rate constant for the complex formation (k on) and the dissociation constant for the complex (K diss) between pH 4 and 8. At lower pH k on is dramatically higher ((2.2 ± 0.7) × 106m−1 s−1at pH 5). Since the k off rate shows no significant dependence on pH, the calculatedK diss decreases by about 3 orders of magnitude from 8 to 4. At pH 5 and 4 K diss is 31.3 and 2.6 μm, respectively. The slope of the pH dependence indicates the involvement of either a protonated form of the enzyme or HNO2. The pK a value of HNO2 is 3.3 at 25 °C,i.e. at pH 5 only 2% are in the protonated form. The following Reactions 6 and 7 are based on the assumption that the pK a originates from an ionizable residue of the enzyme and that only the protonated form of the enzyme binds the ligand in its anionic form: MPO+H+↔MPO­H+ REACTION 6 MPO­H++NO2−↔MPO­H+−NO2− REACTION 7which leads to Equation 1, kon,app=(kon,int×[H+])/[Ka+[H+])Equation 1 where k int is the intrinsic or pH-independent second-order rate constant for complex formation andK a is the dissociation constant of an ionizable group of the enzyme. The experimental data were best fit with the values of pK a = 3.9 ± 0.1, kon(int) = (2.8 ± 0.1) × 107m−1 s−1. These data suggest similarities in complex formation of MPO with both nitrite and chloride, since the pH dependence of chloride binding exhibits a similar pattern with a pK a of about 4 (19.Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11688-11696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since binding of both nitrite (15.Cooper C.E. Odell E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 58-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and chloride (19.Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11688-11696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) influences the spin state of the iron, it is reasonable to assume that the amino acid involved is the distal histidine, which, upon protonation, allows such a direct interaction between these two anions and the iron. By using the sequential stopped-flow technique (16.Furtmüller P.G. Burner U. Obinger C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17923-17930Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 17.Burner U. Obinger C. Paumann M. Furtmüller P.G. Kettle A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9494-9502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we monitored the spectral changes upon reaction of compound I with nitrite. Fig.2 A unequivocally demonstrates a direct conversion of compound I into compound II, which exhibits maxima at 456 (Soret) and 625 nm. Isosbestic points are found at 431, 489, 570, and 664 nm. These data suggest a one-electron oxidation of nitrite to nitrogen dioxide. The absorbance change monitored at 456 nm can be fit to a single exponential function (inset to Fig.2 B), and the observed pseudo first-order rate constants are proportional to the concentration of nitrite (Fig. 2 B). The second-order rate constant calculated from such a plot is (2.0 ± 0.2) × 106m−1s−1 at pH 7.0 and 15 °C. There was a finite intercept of (10.1 ± 2.6) s−1. This is a similar value as determined for the reactions of compound I with peroxidase substrates (17.Burner U. Obinger C. Paumann M. Furtmüller P.G. Kettle A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9494-9502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It includes the rate of reduction of compound I by excess hydrogen peroxide. The rate constant of compound I reduction by nitrite is comparable to that by tyrosine (20.Marquez L. Dunford H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 270: 30434-30440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and benzoic acid hydrazides (17.Burner U. Obinger C. Paumann M. Furtmüller P.G. Kettle A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9494-9502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) which indicates that nitrite is an important electron donor for compound I in vivo. Compared with chloride (16.Furtmüller P.G. Burner U. Obinger C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17923-17930Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), which is thought to be the physiological substrate of MPO, the reaction of compound I with nitrite is even about 2 orders of magnitude faster. Fig. 2 C shows the pH dependence of the apparent second-order rate constant for the reaction of compound I with nitrite. Similar to the complex formation outlined above, the pH dependence suggests the existence of an acid-base group, which, when protonated, favors reaction between compound I and nitrite. Similar findings were obtained recently in a study of the pH dependence of the reaction of compound I with halides and thiocyanate (16.Furtmüller P.G. Burner U. Obinger C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17923-17930Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). One mechanism that could account for the pH dependence is shown in Reaction 8 and 9. MPO­I+H+↔MPO­I­H+ REACTION 8 MPO­I­H++NO2−→MPO­II+NO2• REACTION 9which leads to Equation 2, kapp=(kint×[H+])/[Ka+[H+])Equation 2 where MPO-I-H+ is the protonated form of compound I,k int is the pH-independent second-order rate constant of the reaction between compound I and nitrite, andK a is the dissociation constant of an ionizable group of the enzyme. The use of Equation 2 in the nonlinear least square analysis yields a pK a of 4.6 ± 0.2 and a k int value of (4.2 ± 0.5) × 107m−1s−1. The pK a value is very similar to that published for halide oxidation by MPO compound I (i.e. 4.6) (16.Furtmüller P.G. Burner U. Obinger C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17923-17930Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) and to that of the acid-base group involved in the formation of the nitrite complex from the native enzyme. Apparently, the distal histidine is involved in both ligand binding by the ferric protein and the oxidation of small anions by compound I. However, as Fig. 2 C demonstrates, the data points could not be fitted very well by the computed curve based on Equation 2. Specifically in the neutral pH region the actual rate constants were larger than the theoretical values. One explanation for this deviation could be the strong oxidizing capacity of MPO compound I (21.Burner U. Jantschko W. Obinger C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The data suggest that the binding site of nitrite in compound I is the same as in the ferric enzyme and that to some extent nitrite is also oxidized by the unprotonated form of compound I. Fig.3 A demonstrates that nitrite also acts as one-electron donor for compound II. At pH 7 with 500 μm nitrite the direct conversion of compound II to the resting enzyme can be followed with an isosbestic point at 442 nm. With 5 mm nitrite the subsequent reaction of the ferric protein with nitrite was monitored (Fig. 3 B). This was consistent with the determined complex dissociation constant of 2.3 mmat pH 7. At neutral pH, the reduction of compound II by nitrite is relatively slow. The reaction was followed at 440 nm (the isosbestic point between the ferric protein and its nitrite complex). At this wavelength the time course was monophasic and exhibited a typical single exponential behavior (inset to Fig. 3 C). The total increase in absorbance did not vary distinctly in the pH range investigated (about 0.010–0.012 absorbance units with 1.0 μm heme in the cuvette). The bimolecular rate constant determined at pH 7 is (5.5 ± 0.4) ×102m−1 s−1(Fig. 3 C) and 15 °C. The intercept (k off) at (0.1 ± 0.02 s−1) is the sum of rate constants leading from compound II to other enzyme species. As shown in Fig. 3 D, there is also a distinct effect of pH on the apparent second-order rate constants for the reaction of compound II with nitrite. Similar to compound I reduction by nitrite, compound II reduction increases with decreasing pH. The bimolecular rate constant at pH 5 is (8.9 ± 1.6) × 104m−1 s−1(Fig. 3 D). Thus, in the acidic pH region nitrite is as a good electron donor of compound II. The reaction is best described by Reactions 10 and 11 where MPO-II-H+ is the protonated form of compound II, MPO­II+H+↔MPO­II­H+ REACTION 10 MPO­II­H++NO2−→MPO+NO2• REACTION 11By using Equation 2 in the nonlinear least square analysis (withk int being the pH-independent second-order rate constant of the reaction between compound II and nitrite) yields a pK a of 4.1 ± 0.3 and ak int value of (8.2 ± 0.3) × 105m−1s−1. Interestingly, in all three reactions investigated (i.e.complex formation and the reduction of compounds I and II) the same amino acid appears to participate in nitrite binding and oxidation. Both formation of compound I by hydrogen peroxide as well as the binding of chloride to the native ferric enzyme and its kinetics of oxidation by compound I involve a group with a similar pK a value (16.Furtmüller P.G. Burner U. Obinger C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17923-17930Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). When one averages data from this work one finds a pK a value of 4.3 ± 0.3, in agreement with the literature (16.Furtmüller P.G. Burner U. Obinger C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17923-17930Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 19.Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11688-11696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We suggest that the distal histidine is not only involved in the cleavage of hydrogen peroxide but is also the binding site of these small anionic substrates. Unprotonated distal histidine favors compound I formation, whereas its protonated form enhances the reactivity toward nitrite and halides. We also measured the ability of myeloperoxidase to catalyze the oxidation of nitrite by monitoring the loss of hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 4). There is minimal activity at neutral pH but a sharp increase in activity below pH 6. These results are consistent with the stopped-flow data and indicate that nitrite will be readily oxidized by myeloperoxidase at acidic pH. Since the turnover of compound II determines the rate at which peroxidase substrates are oxidized by myeloperoxidase, nitrite can be regarded as a poor substrate for the enzyme in the neutral pH region. It is also apparent from this study that when a good substrate is available to recycle compound II, the reduction potential of the compound I/compound II couple can be exploited to oxidize nitrite to a larger extent even in the neutral region. Phenols and anilines with one-electron reduction potentials between 1.05 and 1.2 V are oxidized by compound I but not compound II and thus trap the enzyme in the compound II form. Nitrite, which has a one-electron reduction potential of 1.04 V (22.Stanbury D.M. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1989; 33: 69-138Crossref Scopus (719) Google Scholar), has been shown to be a poor substrate for compound II at pH 7, whereas better electron donors (e.g. tyrosine) can be expected to increase nitrite oxidation by MPO in the neutral pH region and thus exploit the high reduction potential of the compound I/compound II couple. In a similar way, it has been shown that reducing agents such as ascorbate or superoxide enhance the chlorination activity of MPO/H2O2/Cl− by reducing compound II (which is unable to oxidize chloride) to the native ferric enzyme (23.Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 957: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 24.Marquez L.A. Dunford H.B. Van Wart H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5666-56670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Summing up, for the first time transient state kinetic investigations of the reactions of nitrite with human myeloperoxidase have been performed. Although we cannot absolutely exclude that to some extent MPO compound I is oxidizing nitrite by two electrons to directly yield peroxynitrite (6.Sampson J.B. Ye Y.Z. Rosen H. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), our findings demonstrate that nitrite is oxidized mainly in one-electron steps by both MPO intermediates in the pH range 4–8. The data suggest that the reaction yields NO2·, although we present no direct evidence for NO2· as a product. This conclusion is based on several facts as follows: (i) the observed spectral transition that is typical for a direct conversion of compound I to compound II, and (ii) there was no spectral evidence for a MPO-peroxynitrite complex. Recently, the spectroscopic data of a methemoglobin-peroxynitrite complex was published (25.Herold S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It was shown that the complex exhibited characteristic absorption maxima in the visible region. We never observed an intermediate with similar spectral features in the course of reaction of compound I with nitrite. (iii) Moreover, from a thermodynamic point of view nitryl ion formation from nitrite mediated by MPO compound I is unlikely to occur (26.Koppenol W.H. Moreno J.J. Pryor W.A. Ischiropoulos H. Beckman J.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 834-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). The bimolecular rate constants presented here indicate that nitrite is a poor substrate for myeloperoxidase mainly because it is a bad electron donor for compound II. Thus, at physiological concentrations of nitrite, its oxidation and the nitration reactions should be inefficient because the enzyme lingers at compound II and is turned over slowly. This is in accord with recently published findings that high concentrations of nitrite are required for MPO-mediated nitration of tyrosyl residues (27.Van Dalen C.J. Winterbourn C.C. Senthilmohan R. Kettle A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11638-11644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), bovine serum albumin (6.Sampson J.B. Ye Y.Z. Rosen H. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), and low density lipoproteins (28.Podrez E.A. Schmitt D. Hoff H.F. Hazen S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1547-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). However, in the presence of better electron donors for compound II (e.g. tyrosine) nitration reactions are enhanced (27.Van Dalen C.J. Winterbourn C.C. Senthilmohan R. Kettle A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11638-11644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Thus, one can expect that at sites of inflammation myeloperoxidase will mediate nitration reactions because co-substrates like tyrosine will be available to facilitate the turnover of MPO and thus the formation of the powerful oxidizing species NO2· (29.Huie R.E. Toxicology. 1994; 89: 193-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), which oxidizes and nitrates many cellular constituents. With increasing concentrations of nitrite, nitration reactions become more and more independent of co-substrates. It was shown that above 250 μm nitrite, a co-substrate was no longer required to promote nitration reactions (27.Van Dalen C.J. Winterbourn C.C. Senthilmohan R. Kettle A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11638-11644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Such high concentrations of nitrite have not been detected in vivo, but they may be feasible at localized sites where there are high fluxes of nitric oxide. It is known that high levels of nitrite are present in the rheumatoid joint of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (9.Farrel A. Blake D. Palmer R. Moncada S. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1992; 51: 1219-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar) and in synovial fluids of rheumatoid arthritis patients (30.Kaur H. Halliwell B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it was recently reported that NO⋅ synthase is induced in cytokine-stimulated human neutrophils and found to be co-localized with MPO in primary granules (7.Evans T. Buttery L. Carpenter A. Springall D. Polak J. Cohen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 93: 9553-9558Crossref Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Thus nitrite may play a role in phagocyte-mediated oxidative reactions at sites of inflammation and infection, and formation of NO2· may represent an additional mechanism of host defense."

At metamorphosis, a subpopulation of EphB-expressing RGCs in the ventrotemporal retina begin to project ipsilaterally. However, when these metamorphic RGCs are grafted into embryos, they project contralaterally, suggesting that the embryonic chiasm lacks signals that guide axons ipsilaterally. Ephrin-B is expressed discretely at the chiasm of metamorphic but not premetamorphic Xenopus. When expressed prematurely in the embryonic chiasm, ephrin-B causes precocious ipsilateral projections from the EphB-expressing RGCs. Ephrin-B is also found in the chiasm of mammals, which have ipsilateral projections, but not in the chiasm of fish and birds, which do not. These results suggest that ephrin-B/EphB interactions play a key role in the sorting of axons at the vertebrate chiasm."

We report that the selective group III metabotropic receptor agonist L(+)-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid (L-AP4) depresses GABAergic transmission to interneurons more than to pyramidal neurons. The L-AP4-induced depression is accompanied by changes in trial-to-trial variability and paired-pulse depression that imply a presynaptic site of action. Brief trains of stimuli in Schaffer collaterals also depress GABAergic transmission to interneurons. This depression persists when GABAB receptors are blocked, is enhanced by blocking glutamate uptake, and is abolished by the group III metabotropic receptor antagonist α-methylserine-O-phosphate (MSOP). The results imply that GABAergic transmission among interneurons is modulated by glutamate spillover from excitatory afferent terminals."

Using chimeras constructed from these two NR2 subtypes, we show that the N-terminal LIVBP-like domain of the NR2A subunit controls the high-affinity Zn2+ inhibition. Mutations at four residues in this domain markedly reduce Zn2+ affinity (by up to >500-fold) without affecting either receptor activation by glutamate and glycine or inhibition by extracellular protons and Ni2+ ions, indicating that these residues most likely participate in high-affinity Zn2+ binding."

Interestingly, the mechanism by which Dkk-1 does this is the ability of Dkk-1 to antagonize the Wnt signaling pathway. Wnt, itself a proto-oncoprotein, can promote cell proliferation and transformation when mutated or overexpressed, leading to tumor formation. p53 is a tumor suppressor and loss of p53 function accelerates mammary tumorigenesis by Wnt. In this study, we found that Dkk-1 is induced by wild-type p53 but not mutant p53(R249S). In addition, DNA damage upregulates Dkk-1 in cell lines that harbor an endogenous wild-type p53 gene but not in cell lines that are p53-null or harbor an endogenous mutant p53 gene. We also found a potential p53 responsive element located approximately 2100 nucleotides upstream of the Dkk-1 transcription start site and we show that p53 binds specifically to this element both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we have established several cell lines derived from H1299 lung carcinoma and U118 glioma cells that inducibly express Dkk-1 under a tetracycline-regulated promoter. We found that Dkk-1 has no effect on proliferation of cells that are not transformed by Wnt. Taken together, these results suggest that Dkk-1 may mediate p53 tumor suppression by antagonizing the Wnt signaling pathway."

While the identity and location oddballs preferentially activated ventral and dorsal brain regions respectively, each oddball type activated both pathways.

https://openalex.org/W1977330771,"B-ATF is a nuclear basic leucine zipper protein that belongs to the AP-1/ATF superfamily of transcription factors. Northern blot analysis reveals that the human B-ATF gene is expressed most highly in hematopoietic tissues. Interaction studies in vitro and in vivo show that the leucine zipper of B-ATF mediates dimerization with members of the Jun family of proteins. Chimeric proteins consisting of portions of B-ATF and the DNA binding domain of the yeast activator GAL4 do not stimulate reporter gene expression in mammalian cells, indicating that B-ATF does not contain a conventional transcription activation domain. Jun/B-ATF dimers display similar DNA binding profiles as Jun/Fos dimers, with a bias toward binding TRE (12-O-tetradecanolyphorbol-13-acetate-response element) over CRE (cyclic AMP-response element) DNA sites. B-ATF inhibits transcriptional activation of a reporter gene containing TRE sites in a dose-dependent manner, presumably by competing with Fos for Jun and forming transcriptionally inert Jun/B-ATF heterodimers. Stable expression of B-ATF in C3H10T1/2 cells does not reduce cell viability, but does result in a reduced cellular growth rate when compared to controls. This effect is dominant in the presence of the growth promoting effects of the H-Ras or the v-Fos oncoproteins, since expression of B-ATF restricts the efficiency of focus formation by these transforming agents. These findings demonstrate that B-ATF is a tissue-specific transcription factor with the potential to function as a dominant-negative to AP-1."

In view of clinical features related to the type of EBV latency, LMP1 may influence invasiveness of EBV associated tumors categorized as types II and III as represented on nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). To screen for genes associated with invasion of epithelial cells transformed by LMP1, Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells were transformed by LMP1. Stable transfection of a LMP1 gene into MDCK cells induced morphological change from cobblestone to a long spindle-shape, reduced cell-cell adhesion and caused high cell motility. Parental MDCK cells, which form spherical cysts in three-dimensional collagen gel matrix, form branching tubules following exposure to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). MDCK cells transformed by LMP1 showed invasive growth to form branching tubules into collagen gel without HGF-treatment. mRNA differential display and Northern hybridization identified plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA) and ets1 as genes upregulated during transformation by LMP1. Expression of a dominant negative type of Ets1 in LMP1-transformed cells downregulated uPA expression and cell motility. Deletion of LMP1 cytoplasmic carboxy-terminal activating region 1 (CTAR1) domain abolished transformation, but a deletion mutant lacking CTAR2 domain still retained transforming and uPA-inducing ability. Expression of Ets1 was immunolocalized in tumor cells of NPC tissue which frequently express LMP1.

In particular, GTPases of the ARF1 family act as molecular switches to trigger the assembly of the coat proteins. The ARF-dependent oligomerization of coat proteins has been shown to be sufficient to deform the membrane into a vesicle bud (3.Bremser M. Nickel W. Schweikert M. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Hughes C.A.

Despite this progress, many details have yet to emerge regarding the mechanisms of cargo packaging, the regulation of vesicle formation, and the nature of interactions with molecular motors and other cytoskeletal proteins that allow directed movement. Although ARF is best characterized for its role in vesicle formation, recent studies suggest it may serve additional functions in the cell. One role for ARF may be to regulate the activity of the phospholipid-modifying enzymes phospholipase D, phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase, and phosphatidylinositol 5-kinase (5.Roth M.G.

This regulation may play a role in vesicle release and/or be part of signaling pathways not directly related to transport. A second role for ARF may be in directing the assembly of the actin-based cytoskeleton. ARF has been shown to regulate the binding of spectrin, ankyrin, and actin to the Golgi membranes (8.Godi A. Santone I. Pertile P. Devarajan P. Stabach P.R. Morrow J.S. Di Tullio G. Polishchuk R. Petrucci T.C. Luini A. De Matteis M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

ARF6 has been implicated in rearranging the actin cytoskeleton at the plasma membrane (7.Honda A. Nogami M. Yokozeki T. Yamazaki M. Nakamura H. Watanabe H. Kawamoto K. Nakayama K. Morris A.J.

There is considerable evidence that the actin cytoskeleton and myosin motors are important for Golgi function in the cell (13.Holleran E.A. Holzbaur E.L.

In this study centractin, tropomyosin isoforms, and myosin isoforms were found to be selectively associated with distinct classes of Golgi-derived vesicles. Some isoforms of spectrin and ankyrin localize to the Golgi apparatus, suggesting that this is a site of their action (9.Beck K.A. Buchanan J.A. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1239-1249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Devarajan P. Stabach P.R. Mann A.S. Ardito T. Kashgarian M. Morrow J.S. J.

Kok J.W. Renau-Piqueras J. Egea G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Here we present evidence that at least two distinct pools of actin are assembled on the Golgi membrane upon ARF activation. This actin affects the release of COPI-coated vesicles from the Golgi and regulates the association of spectrin and the actin-binding protein drebrin with the membrane. The implications of these findings for the ability of COPI-coated vesicles to mediate multiple trafficking steps and for the role of the cytoskeleton in Golgi function will be discussed. Rat liver Golgi membranes and bovine brain cytosol were isolated as described previously (20.Malhotra V. Serafini T. Orci L. Shepherd J.C. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1989; 58: 329-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used in this study: M3A5 (21.Allan V.J. Kreis T.E. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2229-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), anti-actin (Sigma), anti-drebrin (Medical & Biological Laboratories Co.), anti ε-COP (22.Hara-Kuge S. Kuge O. Orci L.

The final reaction conditions included 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 15 mm potassium chloride, 0.2 m sucrose, Golgi membranes (0.2 mg/ml), bovine brain cytosol (1.0 mg/ml), and an ATP-regenerating system. The incubations were carried out for 20 min at 37 °C, and the final reaction volume was 1 ml. When specified, brefeldin A, cytochalasin D, or latrunculin A was added at the indicated concentration. For reactions containing brefeldin A, the membranes and cytosol were preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C with the toxin or with a solvent control. For “float-up” binding assays, the membranes were isolated following the incubation by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C in a refrigerated microcentrifuge. The membranes were then resuspended in 50 μl of 45% (w/w) sucrose in 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 25 mmKCl and placed into a 7 × 20-mm ultracentrifugation tube. The sample was overlaid with 125 μl of 35% (w/w) sucrose in 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 25 mm KCl and then 25 μl of 15% (w/w) sucrose in 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 25 mm KCl. The sample was spun at 100,000 rpm for 30 min in a TLA-100 rotor (Beckman Instruments). A 100-μl sample containing the Golgi membranes was removed from the top of the step gradient, and the membrane proteins were precipitated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid to 10%. The pellet from the step gradient and the TCA precipitate were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. For two-stage incubations the conditions were just as described above except that following the first incubation, the membranes were reisolated by microcentrifugation and incubated with a second reaction mixture prior to the float-up centrifugation. Unless otherwise indicated, the final budding reaction conditions were identical to those used for binding reactions except that the reaction volume was 2.0 ml. Following the incubation, the Golgi membranes were isolated by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min and washed one time with LSSB (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 2.5 mmmagnesium acetate, 50 mm potassium chloride, 0.2m sucrose). The vesicles were stripped from the membrane by incubating in HSSB (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 250 mm potassium chloride, 0.2 m sucrose) for 10 min on ice. Following the incubation, the membranes were centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 15 min. Where indicated, the pellet containing the Golgi remnants was resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer for Western blot analysis. The supernatant was loaded onto a 35% (w/w) sucrose cushion (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 250 mm potassium chloride, 35% (w/w) sucrose) and centrifuged at 350,000 × g for 30 min. The 35% sucrose pellets were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. Proteins were fractionated using SDS-PAGE and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using standard protocol for the Bio-Rad minigel and blotting apparatuses. Following the transfer, the membranes were dried and incubated with appropriate dilutions of the indicated primary antibodies. The signal was visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad) and ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Where indicated, the signals were quantitated using densitometry. Identification by mass spectrometry was done by cutting protein bands from SDS-PAGE gels and digesting the material with 0.2 μg of trypsin (24.Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Gonez J. Heldin C.-H. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). The resulting peptide mixture was then loaded onto a 2-μl bed volume of Poros 50 R2 (PerSeptive Biosystems, Foster City, CA) reversed-phase beads (packed into an Eppendorf gel-loading tip) and eluted stepwise with 4 μl of 16% (and then with 4 μl of 30%) acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid (25.Erdjument-Bromage H.

The “16%” and “30%” peptide pools were each analyzed twice by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry in the presence and absence of peptide calibrants (25.Erdjument-Bromage H.

Spectra were obtained by averaging multiple signals. After recalibration with internal standards, monoisotopic masses were assigned for the most prominent peaks, and a peptide mass list was generated to search a protein non-redundant data base (National Center for Biotechnology Information, Bethesda, MD) using the PeptideSearch (26.Mann M. Højrup P. Roepstorff P. Biol. Mass Spectrom. 1993; 22: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) algorithm with an accuracy requirement of 40 ppm. For the identification of the 280-kDa band, 35 of 63 experimental masses matched human α-spectrin, and 15 of the remaining 28 masses matched human β-spectrin (random matches, 12 of 63). For the identification of the 120-kDa band, 8 of 13 experimental masses matched human drebrin (random matches, 4 of 13). While characterizing the protein components of Golgi-derived transport vesicles, we observed that non-muscle actin is a major GTPγS-dependent protein constituent of both Golgi membranes and the Golgi-derived vesicles following incubations with cytosol (data not shown). This finding, together with recent reports indicating that ARF regulates the levels of actin, spectrin, and ankyrin on Golgi membranes (8.Godi A. Santone I. Pertile P. Devarajan P. Stabach P.R. Morrow J.S. Di Tullio G. Polishchuk R. Petrucci T.C. Luini A. De Matteis M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8607-8612Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and that actin-binding proteins associate with vesicles (15.Heimann K. Percival J.M. Weinberger R. Gunning P. Stow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10743-10750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 16.Valderrama F. Luna A. Babia T. Martinez-Menarguez J.A. Ballesta J. Barth H. Chaponnier C. Renau-Piqueras J. Egea G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1560-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), led us to begin dissecting the nature and role of actin on the Golgi apparatus. As a first step, cell-free Golgi binding assays were used to characterize the conditions for GTPγS/ARF-dependent actin association with the Golgi membranes. We developed a float-up binding assay that allowed actin polymerization to be assayed independently of Golgi binding (Fig.1, see “Experimental Procedures”). In short, Golgi membranes were incubated with cytosol under conditions known to promote coated vesicle formation. Following the incubation, the membranes were resuspended in 45% sucrose and then overlaid with 35% sucrose in a centrifuge tube. Because Golgi membranes have a buoyant density equivalent to about 30% sucrose, they float to the top of the gradient during ultracentrifugation (Fig. 1 A, G fraction). By contrast, large cytoskeletal polymers pelleted at the bottom of the centrifuge tube (Fig. 1 A, P fraction). The presence of the Golgi membranes in the G fraction is confirmed by blotting for the cis-Golgi marker, KDEL receptor (Fig.1 A). In the absence of GTPγS, the Golgi membranes bound neither to G-actin, present in the cytosol (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1and 2), nor to F-actin, assembled by the addition of the actin-polymerizing toxin phalloidin (Fig. 1 A, lanes 5 and 6). In the presence of phalloidin, the F-actin was completely resolved from the Golgi membranes on the step gradient. By contrast, when GTPγS was included in the incubation (Fig.1 A, lanes 3 and 4) 50–80% of the actin was present in the G fraction. The GTPγS-dependent binding of actin to the Golgi was completely inhibited by the addition of brefeldin A, indicating that the GTPγS effect is mediated by ARF (Fig. 1 B). Brefeldin A inhibits nucleotide exchange for ARF1 but not for ARF6 or the rho family of GTPases (27.Cavenagh M.M. Whitney J.A. Carroll K. Zhang C. Boman A.L. Rosenwald A.G. Mellman I. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21767-21774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 28.Meacci E. Vasta V. Moorman J.P. Bobak D.A. Bruni P. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18605-18612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), indicating that the brefeldin A-sensitive actin binding we observe is distinct from the modifications of the actin cytoskeleton involving these GTPases. If either cytosol or the membranes are omitted from the reaction, no actin appears in the G fraction (Fig. 1 C). These findings suggest that actin is assembled directly by Golgi membranes upon activation of ARF with GTPγS. As a more definitive test of the model that ARF activation leads to changes on Golgi membranes that subsequently allow them to assemble actin, we used two-stage binding reactions (Fig.2). In the first stage, cytosol, GTPγS, and membranes were incubated either with or without the actin monomer-binding toxin latrunculin A to block actin assembly. Fig. 2shows that upon reisolation of the membranes following the first stage, actin bound in a GTPγS-dependent manner and that this binding was completely blocked by the presence of latrunculin A. If the reisolated Golgi membranes were then incubated with cytosol in a second stage without GTPγS and latrunculin A, actin was found to be present on the membranes provided that GTPγS had been included in stage 1. Actin assembled on the Golgi without GTPγS in stage 2 even though actin assembly had been blocked by latrunculin A in stage 1. This result supports the model that actin assembles directly on the Golgi in the presence of membrane-bound activated ARF, as opposed to a model whereby the Golgi membranes associate with actin that had been previously assembled through a membrane-independent but GTPγS-dependent mechanism. Because the 21-kDa ARF proteins are the major small GTPases to associate with the Golgi membranes when incubated with GTPγS (29.Serafini T. Orci L. Amherdt M. Brunner M. Kahn R.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1991; 67: 239-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) and no additional G proteins are activated in stage 2, this result also provides strong additional evidence that the observed GTPγS effects on actin assembly are ARF-mediated. Because ARF triggers coated vesicle assembly and the conditions used above for ARF-dependent actin binding are known to bud COPI-coated vesicles from the Golgi, we wished to examine whether the ARF-dependent actin pool was involved in vesicle assembly or release. Following cell-free budding reactions, COPI-coated vesicles are typically stripped from the membrane with 250 mm KCl and then purified using an isopycnic sucrose gradient (20.Malhotra V. Serafini T. Orci L. Shepherd J.C. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1989; 58: 329-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) or by pelleting through a sucrose cushion (30.Sönnichsen B. Lowe M. Levine T. Jamsa E. Dirac-Svejstrup B. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). We find that much of the ARF-dependent actin is extracted from the Golgi with 250 mm KCl (as are COPI-coated vesicles) and pellets through a 35% cushion during ultracentrifugation (Fig.3). This finding could indicate that the ARF-dependent actin is directly associated with the vesicles. In addition to the actin that cofractionated with the vesicles, we observed that some actin is resistant to the salt extraction and remained on the Golgi membranes left behind after removing the vesicles (Fig. 3, Golgi remnants). Surprisingly, although the appearance of actin in the vesicle-enriched 35% sucrose pellet was completely blocked by the addition of the plus-end-binding toxin cytochalasin D, the levels of actin on the Golgi remnants were largely unaffected by the presence of this toxin (Fig. 3). Blotting for the vesicle marker ε-COP revealed that the levels of Golgi membrane and vesicles were unaffected by the toxin treatment. Tubulin levels, both on the Golgi remnants and in the 35% sucrose pellet, were also unaffected by GTPγS or cytochalasin D, indicating that these reagents did not have effects on microtubule assembly or disassembly. The actin monomer-binding toxin latrunculin A reduced the levels of actin in both the 35% sucrose pellet and the Golgi remnants (Fig. 3 B). These results indicate the presence of distinct pools of actin with unique toxin sensitivities on the Golgi membranes following incubation with ARF. In an effort to identify factors that may confer these distinct properties to Golgi-associated actin, we examined the protein composition of the ARF-dependent salt-extractable actin pool. Fig. 4 shows that when GTPγS-assembled actin is extracted from the Golgi and pelleted through a cushion, a remarkably simple set of abundant proteins is present (Fig. 4, lane 2). Besides actin, two proteins of 120 and 220 kDa disappeared when cytochalasin D was added to the reaction (lane 1), indicating that these proteins are actin-associated. This was an unexpectedly small number of actin-bound proteins, given that these incubations were carried out with a whole cytosol preparation. To rule out that our cytosol was devoid of additional actin-binding proteins, we incubated cytosol alone under the identical conditions used in the budding reaction in the presence (lane 3) or absence (lane 4) of phalloidin to polymerize the actin. The phalloidin-polymerized actin was extracted with the 250 mm high salt stripping buffer using the same conditions as for the standard budding reaction. The phalloidin-polymerized actin contained several additional major actin-binding proteins not found on the ARF-dependent actin. Whether or not the 250 mm KCl wash was carried out on the phalloidin-polymerized actin had no effect on the levels of actin-binding proteins, ruling out that actin-binding proteins are lost during the vesicle/actin extractions (data not shown). Thus, based on the salt extractability, the toxin sensitivity, and the protein composition, the ARF-dependent actin in the 35% sucrose pellet is distinct. To identify the putative actin-binding proteins, the tryptic fragments of the 120- and 220-kDa polypeptides were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Using mass fingerprint analysis, the identity of these proteins was determined to be drebrin and a mixture of α- and β-spectrin, respectively. Spectrin has been previously identified as part of an ARF-regulated cytoskeleton on the Golgi and Golgi-derived vesicles (8.Godi A. Santone I. Pertile P. Devarajan P. Stabach P.R. Morrow J.S. Di Tullio G. Polishchuk R. Petrucci T.C. Luini A. De Matteis M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8607-8612Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar,9.Beck K.A. Buchanan J.A. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1239-1249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Drebrin has mostly been characterized as a protein involved in neuronal differentiation (31.Toda M. Shirao T. Uyemura K. Dev. Brain Res. 1999; 114: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 32.Shimohama S. Fujimoto S. Sumida Y. Akagawa K. Shirao T. Matsuoka Y. Taniguchi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the yeast homolog of drebrin, ABP1, has been implicated in endocytosis, suggesting that this family of actin-binding proteins could play a role in trafficking (33.Wesp A. Hicke L. Palecek J. Lombardi R. Aust T. Munn A.L. Riezman H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2291-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). We confirmed that drebrin binding to the Golgi membranes is GTPγS- and ARF-dependent using a Western blot analysis of the vesicle-budding reaction. Drebrin appeared in the 35% sucrose pellet and on Golgi remnants in a GTPγS-dependent manner (Fig.5). The addition of brefeldin A completely blocked the appearance of drebrin in both fractions, indicating that drebrin is ARF-dependent. When cytochalasin D was included in the incubation, actin and drebrin completely disappeared from the 35% sucrose pellet. The cytochalasin D resistant pool of actin is observed on the Golgi remnants (lane 7) and is found to be ARF-dependent. Interestingly, drebrin is not associated with this pool of actin. Together these data suggest that ARF activation leads to the assembly of at least two pools of actin on the Golgi. The first pool is cytochalasin D-sensitive, salt-extractable, and contains drebrin. The second pool is less extractable with salt, is cytochalasin D-resistant, and does not contain drebrin. Because the same small GTPase, ARF, triggered vesicle formation and the assembly of actin on the Golgi and because actin may be directly associated with the Golgi-derived vesicles (Fig. 1) (15.Heimann K. Percival J.M. Weinberger R. Gunning P. Stow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10743-10750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 16.Valderrama F. Luna A. Babia T. Martinez-Menarguez J.A. Ballesta J. Barth H. Chaponnier C. Renau-Piqueras J. Egea G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1560-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we reasoned that the ARF-dependent actin assembly could play a role in vesicle assembly or release. Therefore, we examined the effects of adding the actin-binding toxin cytochalasin D on COPI vesicle formation using the cell-free budding reaction. Addition of the toxin had no effect on the binding of ARF and coatomer to Golgi membranes, suggesting that actin does not play a role in these early events of COPI-coated vesicle assembly (data not shown). Effects were observed, however, on the release of vesicles following the incubation. Typically, vesicles are extracted from the Golgi membranes following cell-free budding reactions by a high salt wash (20.Malhotra V. Serafini T. Orci L. Shepherd J.C. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1989; 58: 329-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). At the standard salt concentration (250 mm KCl), cytochalasin D had little effect on the release of COPI-coated vesicles (Fig.6). Studies on the giantin/GM130/p115-mediated docking of COPI-coated vesicles revealed that the effects of disruption of this complex on vesicle release could be observed when lower salt concentrations were used for extracting vesicles (30.Sönnichsen B. Lowe M. Levine T. Jamsa E. Dirac-Svejstrup B. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Because some aspects of vesicle docking and release are salt-sensitive, we examined the effects of cytochalasin D on COPI-coated vesicle release at lower salt concentrations. Fig. 6 shows that when vesicles were stripped at the lower salt concentrations, 150 and 75 mm KCl, significantly more β-COP and KDEL receptor were found in the 35% sucrose pellet when cytochalasin D was included in the incubations. Therefore, the salt-dependent vesicle release appears to be facilitated by interfering with actin assembly on the Golgi membranes. These results indicate that ARF-mediated changes in the cytoskeleton could play an important role in regulating vesicular trafficking through the Golgi. We describe an ARF-dependent salt extractable actin pool assembled from whole cytosol with a remarkably simple protein composition. One of the two major actin-binding proteins of this complex was identified as a mixture of α- and β-spectrin, confirming previous studies showing an ARF-mediated interaction between spectrin and the Golgi (8.Godi A. Santone I. Pertile P. Devarajan P. Stabach P.R. Morrow J.S. Di Tullio G. Polishchuk R. Petrucci T.C. Luini A. De Matteis M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8607-8612Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The second protein was identified as drebrin. Previously, drebrin had been characterized as a neuron-specific protein that may play a role in neuronal development. In particular, it has been localized to dendrites and may play a role in dendrite outgrowth. If drebrin were restricted to neuronal dendrites, it would be unlikely that it plays a general role in Golgi transport or other vesicular trafficking steps. Several findings indicate that this is not the case. First, we find by Western blot analysis that a protein identical in size to brain cytosol drebrin is recognized by the drebrin antibody in Chinese hamster ovary cells (data not shown), indicating that drebrin or a closely related isoform is present in non-neuronal cells. Second, other recent studies have found drebrin to be present in several non-neuronal tissues (34.Peitsch W.K. Grund C. Kuhn C. Schnolzer M. Spring H. Schmelz M. Franke W.W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 767-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 35.Keon B.H. Jedrzejewski P.T. Paul D.L. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 325-336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, a homolog of drebrin, ABP1, is present in the yeastSaccharomyces cerivisiae. ABP1 interacts genetically with genes encoding proteins required for endocytosis (33.Wesp A. Hicke L. Palecek J. Lombardi R. Aust T. Munn A.L. Riezman H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2291-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). This finding, together with the results we report here, raises the possibility that drebrin is involved in vesicular trafficking. Additional studies will be required to determine the precise role of drebrin or drebrin-related proteins in these processes. The effects of cytochalasin D on the salt-dependent extraction of COPI-coated vesicles could indicate a role for actin in the fission reaction or vesicle release. It is, however, equally likely that actin plays a role in a vesicle tethering or docking event that is not directly related to the fission reaction. In this respect, it is interesting that similar results have been obtained when the function of the GM130/giantin complex is compromised. This complex is thought to tether vesicles to the Golgi after they are formed (36.Orci L. Perrelet A. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2279-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) or to dock vesicles to a target organelle prior to SNARE-mediated fusion (37.Cao X. Ballew N. Barlowe C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2156-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 38.Shorter J. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Although additional studies will be required to establish the precise role of actin in these trafficking steps, the cytochalasin D effects indicate that the ARF-dependent actin plays a role in the interaction of COPI vesicles with the Golgi and therefore is likely to function during COPI-mediated trafficking to, from, or within the Golgi. It is of interest to speculate why pools of actin with distinct properties are assembled on the Golgi. One possibility is that the different pools of actin reflect different classes of assembling vesicles. ARF triggers the assembly of both COPI-coated and AP1/clathrin-coated vesicles on the Golgi apparatus (39.Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 999-1005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 40.Traub L.M. Ostrom J.A. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). It is possible that ARF directs the assembly of distinct actin pools for different classes of vesicles. Additional evidence supporting this model comes from the recent finding that different classes of Golgi-derived vesicles associate with distinct actin-binding proteins (15.Heimann K. Percival J.M. Weinberger R. Gunning P. Stow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10743-10750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). A second possibility is that ARF directs the assembly of different actin pools on different types of membranes. For example, actin assembled on cis-Golgi membranes may have different properties from actin assembled on trans-Golgi membranes. Assembling actin with specific properties on each type of membrane or at each class of vesicle assembly site could direct the overall organization, positioning, or morphology of these organelles. Alternatively or in addition, it could be involved in conferring cytoskeleton-dependent directionality and targeting to the transport process. Targeting proteins in the cell almost certainly requires specific interactions with molecular motor proteins and cytoskeletal elements to move them in the proper direction to the correct location in the cell. In some instances, the same class of vesicle coat can be used for multiple transport steps; for example, COPI-coated vesicles appear to be used for anterograde and retrograde trafficking from Golgi cisternae as well as in the endocytic pathway (41.Orci L.

Cell. 1995; 83: 703-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is highly probable that there is cellular machinery in addition to the coat proteins that specify interactions with the cytoskeleton. The ARF-mediated changes in the actin cytoskeleton may be part of this machinery. Thus ARF-regulated vesicle assembly may not only involve the directed oligomerization of coat proteins but also additional complex regulation of cytoskeletal components to ensure that the assembled vesicle moves along a specific cytoskeletal filament with the correct molecular motor and thus arrives at the proper destination in the cell."

We report two studies of this computationally intractable task of ""satisfiability."" The results show that as the number of possibilities compatible with the assertions increases, the difficulty of the task increases, and that reasoners represent what is true according to assertions, not what is false.

https://openalex.org/W2069592072,"In Caenorhabditis elegans three pairs of neurons, AFD, AIY, and AIZ, play a key role in thermosensation. The LIM homeobox gene ceh-14 is expressed in the AFD thermosensory neurons. ceh-14 mutant animals display athermotactic behaviors, although the neurons are still present and differentiated. Two other LIM homeobox genes, ttx-3 and lin-11, function in the two interneurons AIY and AIZ, respectively. Thus, the three key thermosensory neurons are specified by three different LIM homeobox genes. ceh-14 ttx-3 lin-11 triple mutant animals have a basic cryophilic thermotaxis behavior indicative of a second thermotaxis pathway. Misexpression of ceh-14 in chemosensory neurons can restore thermotactic behavior without impairing the chemosensory function. Thus, ceh-14 confers thermosensory function to neurons."

The data demonstrate that c-N-Ras may play a functional role in the regulation of steady-state phosphorylated Akt and serine 136-phosphorylated Bad (Ser136-pBad). Immortalized N-Ras knockout fibroblasts possess nearly undetectable levels of steady-state Ser136-pBad.

Recombinant murine TNFα (Calbiochem) was dissolved in 0.2-μm filtered PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. We have found that the TNFα potency varied with the number of freeze/thaw cycles. In general, each aliquot was used only twice. Activation of the Fas receptor was achieved by incubation of cells for the times indicated in complete medium containing 1 μg/ml murine anti-Fas receptor (Pharmingen, clone Jo2, form NA/LE) and 0.5 μg/ml recombinant protein G (Sigma). Staurosporine (Sigma) was dissolved in Me2SO and used at 75–100 nm. N-Ras knockout cells stably expressing wild-type c-N-Ras (N−/−wtN cell lines) were generated by transfection of N−/− cells using Lipofectamine Plus (Life Technologies) with c-N-Ras/pIBW3 (a gift from Angel Pellicer, New York University), which has the c-N-Ras gene under the control of the thymidine kinase promoter, and selection in G418 (Fisher). Stable clones were maintained in complete medium containing 200 μg/ml G418. N-Ras knockout cells stably expressing Bcl-2-FLAG (a gift from Alex Almasan, Cleveland Clinic Foundation) were generated by the same protocol. K(A)-Ras was cloned by polymerase chain reaction (Expand High Fidelity PCR System; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) from a bacterial expression vector containing the sequence of c-K(A)-Ras (gift from Berthe Willumsen, University of Copenhagen). Primers corresponding to the N-terminal region of c-K(A)-Ras (forward, 5′-AAGCTTCCCGGGGCGGCCGCGGATCCATGACGGAAT-3′) and the reverse complement of the C-terminal region of c-K(A)-Ras (reverse, 5′-ATCGATGTCGACGAGCTCTCTAGATTACATTATAACGCATTT-3′) were prepared by Life Technologies, Inc. Following the polymerase chain reaction, the product was ligated into pTargeT (Promega) containing a cytomegalovirus enhancer and promoter and the ligation product used to transform JM109-competent Escherichia coli cells. Colonies were selected on LB plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) and screened for the presence and direction of the transgene by restriction digest. Positive, forward clones were used to transfect N-Ras knockout fibroblasts by the method described above. A similar procedure was used to clone c-K(B)-Ras from G12V-K(B)-Ras/pZip (gift from J. Gibbs, Merck) where the forward N-terminal primer was extended beyond the 12th codon to back-mutate the valine 12 to the wild-type glycine (5′-ACACCATGACTGAATATAAACTTGTGGTAGTTGGAGCTGGTGGCGTA-3′). The reverse complement or the C-terminal region of c-K(B)-Ras was used for the reverse primer (3′-AGATCTCCATGGGTCGACTATTTACATAATTACACACTTTG-5′). The resulting c-K(B)-Ras/pTargeT was transfected into N-Ras knockout cells as described. Prior to transfections, the c-K(A)-and c-K(B)-Ras plasmids were sequenced to confirm their identity with the sequences of mouse c-K(A)- or c-K(B)-Ras in the GenBank data base. All transfected clones were tested for the presence and level of expression of the transgene by Western analysis. All lysis buffers contained the following phosphatase inhibitors: 30 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mm each of phosphoserine and phosphothreonine, 0.2 mm phosphotyrosine, 100 μm sodium vanadate, and the following protease inhibitors: 50 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin, 25 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. For Western analysis of Ras expression, serine 473-phospho-Akt (pAkt) levels, total Akt levels, and phospho-MAP kinase (pMAPK levels), cells were harvested by scraping into PBS, and the resulting cell pellet was resuspended in p21 buffer (20 mm MOPS, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 200 mm sucrose, pH 7.4) containing 1% CHAPS (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) and incubated for 20 min on ice. The lysate was centrifuged again at 13,000 ×g, and the supernatant was retained. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (50.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). For Western analysis of total Bad or phospho-Bad levels, cells were harvested by trypsinization, combined with their medium, and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. The cells were washed once in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 20 mm Tris, 140 mmNaCl, pH 7.4) and solubilized in TBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40 (Igepal, Sigma) and phosphatase and protease inhibitors as described. After 20 min on ice, the lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 ×g, and the supernatant was retained for protein measurements and Western analysis. Lysates containing equal amounts of protein were loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Following electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) (Hybond P; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blocking was performed in 5% nonfat milk containing 5% newborn calf serum (Life Technologies). Blots were incubated with primary antibodies for 2–3 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C followed by washing in TBS, 0.1% Tween. The blots were incubated with either goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories) or anti-rabbit HRP (Transduction Laboratories). After washing, the blots were developed, as indicated, with ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposure to film (Hyperfilm ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or with ECL-Plus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and detection with a Molecular Dynamics Storm Imager. Untreated cells or cells treated for the indicated times were harvested by trypsinization and combined with their medium (to collect any detached cells), centrifuged, and washed once in cold PBS. The cell pellets were resuspended in 1% paraformaldehyde (EM Science) in PBS and incubated on ice for 15 min. The fixed cells were centrifuged and washed once with PBS and resuspended in cold 70% ethanol. TUNEL analysis was performed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting using the APO-BRDU flow cytometry kit for apoptosis according to the manufacturer's directions (Phoenix Flow; Pharmingen). Untreated or treated cells in 12-well cluster plates were scraped in their medium and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of lysis buffer supplied by the manufacturer (Cell Death Detection ELISA Plus kit; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 20-μl aliquots were used in the analysis that measures the appearance and relative amounts of cytoplasmic histone-associated-DNA fragments (mono- and oligonucleosomes) with detection by a microtiter plate reader at 405 nm, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Incubation was performed overnight at 4 °C instead of 2–3 h at room temperature as suggested by the manufacturer. The reading from the negative control (buffer only) supplied by the manufacturer was subtracted from all sample values. Expression of c-N-Ras is absent in all immortalized N-Ras knockout cell lines (N−/−) (Fig.1, top). The expression levels of c-N-Ras in the N-Ras knockout cells ectopically expressing c-N-Ras (N−/−wtN) are similar to that observed in the control N+/+ cells (Fig. 1, bottom). All cell lines, except K(i)-Ras knockout cells, express K(i)-Ras (see below), and none express detectable levels of Ha-Ras (data not shown). Since the N-Ras knockout cells express only c-K(A)- and c-K(B)-Ras, they present a unique system to examine signaling systems that might specifically require c-N-Ras. We chose to test for changes in either phospho-MAP kinase or phospho-Akt levels, since each of these is regulated through a distinct Ras signaling pathway (Raf-1 and PI 3-kinase, respectively). Differences between N-Ras knockout cells and control cells in the level of activated MAP kinase or Akt were examined both at steady state and following agonist stimulation. We examined phospho-MAP kinase (p42 and p44) levels under steady-state growth and following treatment with TNFα in the presence of cycloheximide (Fig.2 A). The N-Ras knockout cells, control N+/+ cells, and N-Ras knockout cells stably expressing c-N-Ras at control levels possessed similar levels of phosphorylated MAP kinase at steady state and following treatment with TNFα. There was a small increase in the level of phospho-MAP kinase at 1 h that decreased to steady-state levels after 4 h. This is consistent with the report that both Jun N-terminal kinases and extracellular signal-related kinases (ERKs) are activated in a Ras-dependent manner following Fas ligation in SHEP cells (51.Goillot E.

Recently, two groups reported that phosphorylation of Bad on serine 112 is regulated by the MAP kinase pathway (31.Scheid M.P. Schubert K.M. Duronio V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31108-31113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 52.Fang X., Yu, S. Eder A. Mao M. Bast Jr., R.C. Boyd D. Mills G.B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6635-6640Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The results from these studies suggested that the MAP kinase pathway is necessary for Ser112 phosphorylation and inactivation of proapoptotic Bad, similar to Ser136 phosphorylation of Bad by Akt (32.Datta S.R.

While our laboratory has demonstrated that c-N-Ras preferentially binds to Raf-1 in G12V-Ha-Ras-transformed C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts, it is possible that as a result of continuous culturing of the N-Ras knockout fibroblasts in serum-containing medium, these cells may have adapted alternative mechanisms that lead to MAP kinase activation. Unlike MAP kinase, Akt can be activated by a Ras/PI 3-kinase-dependent pathway (3.Malumbres M. Pellicer A. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 887-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 18.Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that, at steady state, the N-Ras knockout cells possess minimal levels of pAkt in contrast to control cells (Fig. 2 B,upper panel). Ectopic expression of c-N-Ras in the N-Ras knockout cells significantly restores the level of pAkt to levels comparable with those observed in the control cells. The differences observed in pAkt are not a result of differences in the total amount of Akt (Fig. 2 B, bottom panel). The N-Ras knockout cells, control N+/+ cells, and the N-Ras knockout cells ectopically expressing c-N-Ras (N−/−wtN) possess similar levels of total Akt protein both at steady state and following treatment with TNFα. This implies that activation of the c-N-Ras/PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway may be impaired in N-Ras knockout cells. Bad can be phosphorylated on position 136 by Akt (32.Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S.

https://openalex.org/W2320866051,"EBNA-3 (also called EBNA-3A) is one of the EBV encoded nuclear antigens that are necessary for B-cell transformation. EBNA-3 is known to target RBPs, nuclear proteins that also interacts with EBNA-2, EBNA-4 and EBNA-6. In order to identify additional EBNA-3 targets, an EBV-transformed human lymphocyte cDNA library was screened in the yeast two-hybrid system with N-terminus truncated EBNA-3 that cannot interact with RBP-Jkappa. A clone, encoding Xap-2 protein, a cellular partner of Hepatitis B virus X-antigen was isolated. This protein is also known as the p38 subunit of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor complex (ARA9). The specific binding to EBNA-3 was confirmed by showing that the GST-Xap-2 precipitated EBNA-3 from CV1 cells that were infected with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing EBNA-3. Deletion of the C-terminus of Xap-2 eliminated the binding. Fusion with green fluorescent protein showed that Xap-2 is preferentially cytoplasmic but translocates to the nucleus upon expression of EBNA-3."
https://openalex.org/W2020110300,"T cells from patients who had received chemotherapy for B-lineage acute lymphocytic leukemia were studied to determine whether genetic instability, a principal characteristic of cancer cells, can also occur in nonmalignant cells. Consistent with expectations for a genetic instability phenotype, multiple mutations were detected in the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) reporter gene in independently isolated mutant T cells expressing identical rearranged T cell receptor beta (TCRbeta) gene hypervariable regions. These results indicate that cancer treatment can lead to genetic instability in nonmalignant cells in some individuals. They also suggest a mechanistic paradigm for the induction of second malignancies and drug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2029636219,"Postsynaptic dCBP (Drosophila homolog of the CREB binding protein) is required for presynaptic functional development. Viable, hypomorphic dCBP mutations have a approximately 50% reduction in presynaptic transmitter release without altering the Ca2+ cooperativity of release or synaptic ultrastructure (total bouton number is increased by 25%-30%). Exogenous expression of dCBP in muscle rescues impaired presynaptic release in the dCBP mutant background, while presynaptic dCBP expression does not. In addition, overexpression experiments indicate that elevated dCBP can also inhibit presynaptic functional development in a manner distinct from the effects of dCBP loss of function. Pre- or postsynaptic overexpression of dCBP (in wild type) reduces presynaptic release. However, we do not observe an increase in bouton number, and presynaptic overexpression impairs short-term facilitation. These data suggest that dCBP participates in a postsynaptic regulatory system that controls functional synaptic development."
https://openalex.org/W2051907463,"Megakaryocytes become polyploid by entering a truncated cell cycle, consisting of alternate S phases and abortive mitoses. We have investigated the regulation of the G1/S transition by comparing two megakaryoblastic cell lines, HEL and K562, which respectively do or do not become polyploid in response to phorbol esters. A pronounced downregulation of cyclin A, and to a lesser extent of cyclin E, occurred in K562 cells during the first 24 h after TPA treatment, in contrast with re-replicating HEL cells, in which both cyclins were present in individual G2/M cells. Transactivation experiments suggested that the absence of cyclin A in differentiated K562 cells could be due to a TPA-mediated inhibition of its transcription. To investigate the potential role of cyclin E in the establishment of re-replication cycles, we isolated K562 clones constitutively expressing cyclin E. The resulting clones, and also K562 cells transiently expressing cyclin E, entered re-replication cycles when treated with TPA. The transcriptional activity of the cyclin A promoter was not inhibited after TPA treatment, and although the levels of cyclin A fluctuated during further re-replication cycles, they never decreased below S phase levels. We conclude that the presence of cyclin E in megakaryoblastic G2/M cells determines cyclin A expression and allows the entrance into an extra S phase."

https://openalex.org/W2331955450,"The v-ets oncoprotein and its progenitor Ets1 belong to a family of transcription factors that are related by an 85 amino acid conserved DNA binding domain, the ets domain. Ets1 plays important role(s) in control of cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Abnormal expression of Ets1 could lead to disruption of these processes and contribute to development of malignancy. Retinoic acid (RA) inhibits proliferation, induces differentiation and regulates apoptosis in many different cell types. Here, we demonstrate that RA treatment increases the expression of Ets1 mRNA, but not that of Ets2, Elk1 or Fli1 in MC3T3-E1 cells. Ets1 induction is detectable after 4 h, can be maintained for at least 14 days, and is inhibited by Actinomycin D, which suggests that RA regulation of Ets1 occurs at the transcriptional level. The promoter region of Ets1 contains four retinoic acid response element (RARE) half sites located at -94, -152, -1765 and -2252 from the translation start site. We show that RARbeta is expressed by MC3T3-E1 cells in the presence of RA and demonstrate that it binds to the -94 RARE half site. Furthermore, RA induces transcription of Ets1 promoter-reporter constructs containing this RARE half site."

https://openalex.org/W2323748055,"Germline mutations in genes encoding several components of the retinoblastoma pathway have been linked with inherited predisposition to melanoma. Most commonly, such mutations involve CDKN2A, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor of two kinases, CDK4 and CDK6, which phosphorylate the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) and thereby promote passage through the G1/S cell-cycle restriction point. Less frequently, germline mutations in the CDK4 gene have also been linked with an increased risk of melanoma. Despite the sequence and functional homology between CDK4 and CDK6, the role of germline mutations in CDK6 in melanoma predisposition is unknown. We detected no CDK6 mutations within the p16 (CDKN2A) binding domain in index cases from 60 melanoma-prone kindreds that lacked germline mutations in the coding regions of either CDKN2A or within the entire CDK4 coding region. We conclude that germline mutations in CDK6 do not make a significant contribution to melanoma predisposition."
https://openalex.org/W2318762568,"The role of intracellular Ca2+ pools in the regulation of growth factor signal transduction pathways and mitogenesis is not well understood. We have examined the roles of basal and transiently mobilized Ca2+ in the regulation of MAP kinases by EGF. To assess the influence of Ca2+ transients we utilized Plcg1-/- and Plcg1+/+ mouse embryonic fibroblasts, while BAPTA/AM was employed to chelate total intracellular Ca2+ in the same cell lines. The MAP kinases erk-1, erk-2 and erk-5 exhibited similar patterns of activation in wild-type and Plcg1-/- cells treated with EGF. However, pretreatment with BAPTA/AM significantly increased and prolonged erk-1 and erk-2 activation in both cell types. In contrast, BAPTA/AM prevented the EGF activation of erk-5 in wild-type and Plcg1-/- cells. These data indicate that basal Ca2+, but not growth factor provoked Ca2+ transients, has a significant influence on the activation of these MAP kinases. AG1478, a specific EGF receptor kinase inhibitor, abolished the prolonged erk-1 and erk-2 activation produced by EGF in cells pretreated with BAPTA/AM. This indicates that the prolonged activation of erk-1 and erk-2 produced in the presence of BAPTA/AM requires continuous signaling from the EGF receptor kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2327769001,"The apoptosis-inducing Fas receptor has been shown to be down-regulated in various types of tumors, while its ligand (FasL) appears to be frequently up-regulated. Here we provide evidence that there is a strong selective pressure in vivo against Fas-expressing, tumorigenic NIH3T3 cells, favoring survival, proliferation and eventually tumor formation by Fas-negative cells. Importantly, re-expression of Fas in these cells results in either the complete abolishment of tumor development, or in a significant extenuation of the latency period of tumor outgrowth. In addition, we found that environmental conditions which prevail during tumorigenesis, such as limiting amounts of survival factors and the lack of cell adhesion, are markedly sensitizing tumor cells to Fas-mediated suicide. Our data suggest that in addition to T cell-mediated immune responses, mechanisms of Fas-dependent tissue turnover are also centrally implicated in tumor cell clearance."
